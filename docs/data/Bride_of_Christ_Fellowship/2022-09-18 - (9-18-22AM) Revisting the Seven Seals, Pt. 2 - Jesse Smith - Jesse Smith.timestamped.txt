[0:00] seals i realized i didn't finish all of
[0:01] them i just got to the first four
[0:03] so i'd like to continue a little longer
[0:05] on those by god's grace
[0:18] revelation chapter 6 verse 9 10 and 11
[0:21] revelation 6 9 10 11.
[0:41] of course we know the holy spirit loves
[0:43] this type of worship and
[0:46] loves this subject praise god because
[0:48] the holy spirit saved this subject to
[0:50] the seventh church age
[0:52] and brother iran said i've been in
[0:53] meetings where i've seen people healed
[0:55] and saw visions of healing even the dead
[0:56] rays but nothing compares to the holy
[1:00] spirit coming in his room fellowshipping
[1:02] with him and revealing the truth of the
[1:03] scripture praise god
[1:05] think about that we would rejoice in
[1:06] healings we'd shout if we we'd scream if
[1:08] we saw a dead person raised but the
[1:10] revelation the spirit was even greater
[1:12] than that
[1:13] because god is giving us a thus saith
[1:15] the lord
[1:17] so thank god for his mercy in his grace
[1:19] revelation 6 verse
[1:21] 9 10 and 11. we read this a couple weeks
[1:23] ago
[1:24] it's like to pick up here by god's grace
[1:29] why don't we all just read verse nine if
[1:31] we can we'll all read verse nine and
[1:32] then i'll read ten and eleven myself
[1:34] here let's read verse nine one two three
[1:37] and when he had opened the fifth seal i
[1:40] saw under the altar the souls of them
[1:43] that were slain for the word of god and
[1:46] for the testimony which they held i'll
[1:48] read verse 10 and they cried with a loud
[1:50] voice saying how long o lord holy and
[1:52] true
[1:53] dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[1:55] on them that dwell on the earth
[1:58] and white robes were given unto every
[2:00] one of them and it was said unto them
[2:02] that they should rest yet for a little
[2:03] season until their fellow servants also
[2:06] and their brethren should be killed as
[2:09] they were
[2:10] should be fulfilled
[2:13] this gives us this also insight into how
[2:16] souls in heaven can
[2:19] desire for things to happen in scripture
[2:21] to be fulfilled on the earth
[2:24] they're aware they're in heaven they're
[2:26] aware that their uh the revenge hasn't
[2:28] been taken upon those that killed them
[2:30] they're aware
[2:32] so those in heaven can be aware of
[2:33] certain things upon the earth may god
[2:36] has blessings to bring his word you may
[2:37] be seated here praise god
[2:39] of course we're not sure how much
[2:40] they're uh aware of but they were aware
[2:43] that their blood had not been avenged by
[2:46] god
[2:49] so let's pick up here we'll uh i have
[2:51] just a few uh scripture a few slides i'd
[2:53] like to show here
[2:55] by god's grace
[2:58] we'll see how the holy spirit is
[2:59] directing here today
[3:06] just
[3:07] awesome real quick what time you got to
[3:08] go 12.
[3:10] oh we work at three well glory
[3:12] thank you
[3:13] i want to make sure if we had any
[3:15] special prayer time you could be here so
[3:17] you'll be here
[3:18] don't gotta worry about that
[3:20] okay praise the lord so uh i'd like to
[3:22] continue on this thought you know when i
[3:24] was talking to my wife this week and i
[3:26] realized when i preached this
[3:27] i think only bang was here i think when
[3:29] i preached on the seven seals my wife my
[3:32] family and
[3:33] vancouver was in 2010.
[3:36] we probably don't remember too much
[3:37] about 2010 other than god was gracious
[3:40] to us that year of course he's gracious
[3:42] every year but
[3:43] it's been a while i thought well here
[3:44] let me take a little i just think maybe
[3:46] one more service here we'll see it i'll
[3:48] try to
[3:51] show more about the revelation of the
[3:53] seven seals so i found this picture
[3:55] online i thought was pretty beautiful
[3:57] you know the
[3:59] their souls under the altar this is of
[4:00] course the altar of incense
[4:03] in heaven it seems the altar of incense
[4:05] would be in the seventh dimension uh
[4:07] because it's near the throne of god
[4:12] so i don't know if if this is the
[4:14] seventh above or this is the sixth below
[4:17] you know i'm not quite sure that's a
[4:18] whole other topic brother william i'm
[4:20] sure we could discuss he's that's the
[4:22] reason i say him because he's heard all
[4:23] the sermons down through the years
[4:24] brother bran you know different
[4:25] preachers and trying their best to
[4:27] understand the seventh seven dimensions
[4:29] right
[4:29] and where each one goes you know we know
[4:31] sinners go to the fifth dimension but
[4:33] the band tells us the fifth dimension is
[4:34] in the heart of the earth and
[4:35] brotherhood says that believers after
[4:37] they die go to the sixth dimension
[4:39] which that seems to be true but one
[4:42] thing for sure we know there's 24 elders
[4:44] in the seventh dimension
[4:46] because they sit around the throne of
[4:48] jesus christ the throne of christ would
[4:50] be the seventh dimension
[4:52] and so we know that some souls are
[4:54] privileged
[4:55] to sit
[4:56] in the seventh dimension we believe 12
[4:58] of those were old testament souls
[5:01] right the 12
[5:03] leaders of the tribes of israel 12 sons
[5:05] of jacob and then 12 of them would be
[5:07] the 12 apostles of christ jesus course
[5:10] someone taking probably matthias or paul
[5:12] taking
[5:13] judas is scared's place but
[5:15] so there's a great mystery even in this
[5:16] picture well is this the end of the
[5:18] sixth dimension and now to get up to the
[5:19] seventh i don't know
[5:20] all i can say is i just want to be there
[5:22] praise god lord help me to do everything
[5:25] i can do to be there by god's grace
[5:27] hallelujah and again this is a minor
[5:29] right this is a minor and that's why i
[5:30] don't spend a lot of time on you know
[5:32] things like that i'll take we take
[5:33] questions about it we want to i don't
[5:35] choose to preach full sermons on that
[5:36] because it's such a minor
[5:38] i want to major on getting people saved
[5:40] and filled with the holy ghost praise
[5:42] god and then while after you're saved
[5:44] and filled with the holy ghost i want to
[5:45] strengthen you praise god
[5:47] you can be a mighty man or woman
[5:49] almighty in the faith praise god
[5:50] hallelujah so we just try to major on
[5:53] what's a major and then you know minor
[5:54] on what's a minor
[5:56] by the grace of god and even brother
[5:57] braham said divine healing's a minor now
[5:59] that's
[5:59] shocking to me sometimes when i hear
[6:01] that but that's the reality of it you
[6:03] know but you know he had so many healing
[6:05] services so there's a time for a minor
[6:07] there's definitely time for minors
[6:10] and minors are important when you're
[6:11] sick how many would say men to that
[6:13] when you're sick you want the minor to
[6:14] be a major don't you
[6:17] that's how i feel if i'm sick i want god
[6:19] to heal me in a major way
[6:21] so um you know it's just a great balance
[6:23] in other words we're looking at the time
[6:24] and season when god is going to move
[6:26] praise god we need god to move in the
[6:28] time and season of our lives
[6:30] so the scripture plainly says we read
[6:31] that these were slain for the word of
[6:33] god
[6:35] now if you go to revelation 1 verse 2
[6:37] brother man brings out this beautiful
[6:38] revelation and this could have been i
[6:40] don't know if this was from larkin or
[6:41] the holy spirit listed brother branham
[6:43] or from another of the historians we'll
[6:45] get into a little bit of that today
[6:47] uh it seems like brother ram got most of
[6:49] his uh
[6:50] uh thoughts that were not revelations he
[6:52] got most of his just teaching thoughts
[6:54] from larkin uh uriah smith
[6:56] and charles tays russell and so i'll
[6:59] show you pictures of them you know they
[7:01] at the end of the 1800s early 1900s
[7:05] and god gave some of them some
[7:07] revelation they had some revelation
[7:10] but it wasn't time for them
[7:12] to receive the full revelation the
[7:13] mystery of god finishing would come just
[7:16] a few short might would just come 60 or
[7:18] 80 years after them
[7:20] it was so close i mean they were so
[7:22] close to that season no wonder they were
[7:23] probing right no wonder they were
[7:25] probing into the seven seals they were
[7:26] probing into the seven church ages no
[7:28] wonder because that season was right on
[7:30] them praise god the same thing happened
[7:32] in jesus day before the messiah come
[7:33] there was numerous men gamaya said that
[7:35] rose up and said follow me i'm the
[7:37] messiah and went out to the wilderness
[7:39] and to see people you know because it
[7:41] was time
[7:42] satan sends that time it was time for
[7:44] the messiah so he raised up people to
[7:46] try to
[7:47] get people uh off the beaten path and
[7:49] distract them from the real reality of
[7:51] the messiah
[7:52] and that's how it was in this day as
[7:54] well you know with uriah smith and
[7:56] charles uh charles hayes russell and
[7:58] clarence larkin now larkin seems to be
[8:00] the one who lived the best life as far
[8:01] as a cleanest life
[8:03] but they were they sensed that god was
[8:05] doing something god was finishing up the
[8:07] seven churches they sensed god was gonna
[8:09] finish the mystery of
[8:10] god unbelievable and that you know think
[8:13] of it now even uh charles says russell's
[8:15] book was called the finished mystery
[8:17] well where did he get that phrase from
[8:19] that's from revelation 10 7.
[8:21] he even wrote a book about the entire
[8:23] book of revelation
[8:25] uh because he felt there's a pull i feel
[8:27] the pull the mystery some i feel like
[8:30] these scriptures have been laying here
[8:31] for two thousand years but i feel the
[8:33] spirit of god like god wants to reveal
[8:34] it praise god oh my hallelujah man he
[8:38] was so close just 80 years away
[8:40] for when god was actually going to pour
[8:41] out these revelations praise god but in
[8:43] revelation 1 verse 2 he said
[8:45] john he who bear record of the word of
[8:48] god and of the testimony of jesus christ
[8:52] and of all things that he saw so john
[8:54] has both testimonies he has a testimony
[8:57] for the word of god and for the
[8:58] testimony of jesus christ
[9:01] hallelujah and so we see that these are
[9:02] two different testimonies
[9:05] the word of god of course would be the
[9:07] old testament we call it uh the torah or
[9:09] the the law of moses
[9:11] the first five books of the bible but of
[9:13] course then there was many books added
[9:14] the prophets and the law and poetry
[9:16] after that of course
[9:18] but it makes up the old testament that's
[9:20] the testimony of the word of god
[9:22] but after john the baptist jesus christ
[9:24] came amen
[9:26] and he the bible said that all the law
[9:28] and the prophets were until john amen
[9:30] hallelujah
[9:31] and then jesus christ was here
[9:32] hallelujah and since then the bible said
[9:35] the kingdom of god is here hallelujah
[9:37] and the kingdom of god is in you
[9:39] hallelujah by the anointing of the holy
[9:41] spirit and now we have the testimony of
[9:43] jesus christ praise god
[9:47] you know yesterday i met a young man and
[9:48] he was a look like a spanish he looked
[9:51] like 100 percent spanish i looked 50
[9:53] right uh but he looked 100 and he asked
[9:55] hey what is that john three fit what is
[9:57] that john 3 16 on your hat and i was
[9:59] just
[9:59] i was just you know going throughout the
[10:01] day
[10:02] and uh
[10:03] i was kind of shocked
[10:04] i had to kind of get my words you know
[10:06] because i wasn't ready to witness
[10:08] but i like how god helps me to witness
[10:10] that's why i wear that hat
[10:12] and i had i said oh that's right uh
[10:14] john
[10:15] john 3 16 for god so loved the world and
[10:17] i quote in the scripture
[10:19] and
[10:20] i said have you ever read your bible do
[10:22] you have a bible no you had no bible
[10:25] and
[10:27] he i said well you should get a bible i
[10:29] said i've written two books about god i
[10:31] said would you like my card and so you
[10:33] know eventually he took my card there
[10:35] and uh
[10:36] and i said god heal my mom a cancer i
[10:38] gave her that whole testimony you know
[10:39] what i said jesus christ is alive i just
[10:42] kind of bowed his head and said okay you
[10:43] know
[10:44] and he walked away i thought maya was
[10:46] just a shock to me like we have the
[10:48] testimony of jesus christ amen amen
[10:51] and i gave my card hopefully he'll text
[10:52] me he hasn't yet you know so i don't
[10:53] know you know how it is
[10:55] but i thought wow it was so sad he's
[10:57] probably 20 and he's never even read
[10:59] john 3 16.
[11:01] fine god help us to be lights amen god
[11:03] help us to we ought to be thankful that
[11:04] we've heard john 3 16. thank god for
[11:07] that old rugged cross hallelujah
[11:09] i opened that door i i walked out there
[11:11] to do the finances and somebody opened
[11:12] the door i thought everybody was
[11:13] screaming and shouting old rugged cross
[11:15] hallelujah amen that sounded good in
[11:18] here i like that kind of worship
[11:19] hallelujah hallelujah glory
[11:22] we have the testimony of jesus christ
[11:25] and we share his testimony praise god
[11:28] but these on the altar have no testimony
[11:30] of jesus
[11:32] they're under the altar they're not even
[11:34] on the same level as the altar and
[11:37] they're not above the altar
[11:39] so there must be some in heaven there
[11:41] must be some type of ascension of levels
[11:43] you know you must you can be below it
[11:45] but there must be some type of a uh
[11:47] incline or something into the higher in
[11:49] the presence of god there must be
[11:51] something like that
[11:52] because they're under the altar
[11:55] uh they're not in a higher dimension
[11:57] like the 24 elders
[12:00] isn't that what isn't that what the holy
[12:02] spirit told john come up higher
[12:04] hallelujah he opened he said open
[12:07] there's a door open in heaven and the
[12:08] voice said come up hither amen
[12:10] hallelujah amen thank god hallelujah
[12:13] and then brother brown brought this out
[12:15] to us that they're crying out for
[12:17] revenge on their for their blood
[12:20] and in acts 7 verse 60 stephen's being
[12:22] stoned
[12:24] now look look at this interesting look
[12:26] at it interesting how the holy spirit
[12:27] anointed him to say you stiff-necked and
[12:30] uncircumcised the heart look at that
[12:32] it just struck me right now i haven't
[12:33] even thought about that he rebukes him
[12:35] and name calls him you're stiff-necked
[12:38] but then when he dies he says god don't
[12:40] lay it to their charge for being
[12:41] stiff-necked now look at that
[12:44] look at that how you can be so direct to
[12:46] the holy spirit and name call somebody
[12:48] which they deserve it's not a negative
[12:50] thing it's not like a personal thing
[12:51] it's just a spiritual thing you're stiff
[12:53] neck and then in a few moments later say
[12:56] father forgive them they don't even know
[12:57] what they're doing
[12:58] right that's what jesus prayed on the
[12:59] cross is that is that just isn't that
[13:01] striking
[13:02] that one moment the holy spirit can be
[13:04] so uh direct
[13:07] and so strict and the next moment cry
[13:09] out for mercy
[13:11] and the church said yeah
[13:13] procedure sometimes when we're critical
[13:15] against the nomination or sometimes when
[13:16] i preach or a preacher or you will be so
[13:19] critical against someone but in the next
[13:21] breath we can say god be merciful to
[13:22] them
[13:24] i thought wow i've never seen that
[13:25] before until right now
[13:28] just how the holy spirit is what is it
[13:31] it's a warning of the holy spirit
[13:33] don't be stiff-necked
[13:35] don't harden your heart that's what the
[13:36] bible says in hebrews chapter 3 don't
[13:38] harden your heart like in the days of
[13:40] the provocation don't harden your heart
[13:42] like israel when you see those giants
[13:44] don't harden your heart and say we can't
[13:46] possess god's promise have a tender
[13:48] heart toward god know that god calls you
[13:50] to overcome giants amen say it like that
[13:52] amen
[13:54] god called you to take the promises of
[13:56] god hallelujah
[13:57] god called us to overcome these giants
[14:00] and these obstacles in our life you are
[14:02] called to overcome because god sent you
[14:04] god's with you god is for you how they
[14:07] do god cannot fail hallelujah
[14:10] if god sent you to do anything then he's
[14:12] going to equip you to overcome
[14:14] hallelujah amen
[14:17] one moment that we can be so critical
[14:20] and the holy spirit says yes you will
[14:21] get revenge
[14:23] jesus tells them they will get revenge
[14:26] and again notice that i know it's
[14:27] something we taught in passing
[14:30] but when a holy ghost-filled person i'm
[14:32] sorry when a person who doesn't have the
[14:33] holy ghost goes to heaven six dimension
[14:36] or to the heart of the earth they still
[14:38] have their human understandings
[14:40] they have not been perfected
[14:43] they have not entered into that
[14:44] theophany or that perfect that perfect
[14:47] theophy they haven't entered into that
[14:49] so they still have their own thoughts
[14:51] lord revenge me
[14:53] or like like the rich man in hell oh
[14:55] send
[14:56] if my if my brothers just saw five
[14:58] people raised from the dead they would
[14:59] believe
[15:01] or if my brothers just saw one person
[15:03] raised from the dead that's what it was
[15:04] they would believe but that's a human
[15:06] thought
[15:07] the word of god alone i believe it was
[15:09] david who said the law of god is perfect
[15:11] converting the soul amen
[15:13] hallelujah you can take the ten
[15:15] commandments and convert the soul praise
[15:17] god amen because you can start listening
[15:19] off take the name of the lord god in
[15:21] vain worship him only right honor your
[15:23] mother mother and father i should not
[15:25] lie they shall not murder commit
[15:26] adultery bear false witness you can take
[15:28] all these things and it will so convict
[15:31] the person that they can repent and
[15:33] receive eternal life right there praise
[15:35] god
[15:36] the law is perfect converting the soul
[15:38] praise god
[15:42] church let us
[15:43] let us have humble hearts and and say
[15:45] lord help me not to need anything other
[15:48] than what you you've already given to
[15:50] receive your word for my life praise god
[15:52] in other words help me not to rest upon
[15:54] a sign or help me not to wrestle upon a
[15:56] wonder or something like that help me
[15:58] just to trust your word and believe it
[16:00] praise god
[16:02] i'm talking about like a sinner you know
[16:05] but we get tempted too like i got to
[16:06] have a sign or i've got to have a
[16:08] miracle or i've got to have this or that
[16:09] i've got to have this or that really
[16:11] when it all comes down to it jesus said
[16:13] you've got the word believe the word of
[16:15] god hallelujah
[16:16] amen
[16:22] so they're crying out for revenge these
[16:24] jews
[16:26] and uh
[16:28] the bible said they're given white robes
[16:29] now in the church age book brother man
[16:31] says they're giving them at the white
[16:32] throne judgment
[16:34] so it doesn't say that in the text but
[16:36] that's what brother branham alludes to
[16:37] because that's when the people who were
[16:39] not born again remember the dead the
[16:41] dead lived not again until the thousand
[16:42] years were finished and then they're
[16:44] given white robes so it seems they're
[16:46] given white robes later after the
[16:48] millennium and after the white throne or
[16:50] at the right throne judgment they're
[16:51] given the white robes but church we have
[16:53] robes now
[16:54] jesus says when you get the holy ghost
[16:56] you're endued with power from on high
[16:59] that means clothed with power praise god
[17:01] and then hebrews 13 14 says put ye on
[17:04] the lord jesus christ
[17:06] and give not provision to the flesh amen
[17:09] amen in other words you can put on his
[17:10] anointing like a garment praise god and
[17:12] then jude 1 23 says hating even the
[17:16] garment spotted by the flesh
[17:18] praise god he's not talking about
[17:20] natural clothes
[17:21] he's he's not telling them well you
[17:23] should wash your clothes more you come
[17:24] to church with stains on your clothes
[17:26] that's not what he's talking about now
[17:27] if you do try to wash it you know just
[17:28] if you can but he's talking about
[17:30] spiritual things in other words don't
[17:32] get your life contaminated by sinful
[17:34] things amen
[17:36] hallelujah praise god
[17:38] so we can see these revelations that god
[17:40] gave to brother branham now there's more
[17:42] he said the voice said rest yet for a
[17:44] season now if you if you read revelation
[17:47] 12
[17:49] the bible said the jews are out in the
[17:51] wilderness and they hid from the from
[17:53] the dragon for a time
[17:55] times and half a time that's three and a
[17:57] half years
[17:59] a time is a year
[18:01] in that in that particular context
[18:03] so there's a little season in a little
[18:05] three and a half year season that they
[18:07] have to rest this is after the rapture
[18:09] now the fist seals after the rapture
[18:11] because there's no more horse riders
[18:13] there's no more beasts
[18:15] right
[18:16] like we said last week we got the flying
[18:17] anointing flying eagle anointing praise
[18:20] god
[18:21] we watch and pray amen we're watching
[18:23] and praying for that glad millennial day
[18:25] praise god
[18:27] but the jews
[18:29] when they're crying out after the
[18:30] rapture the lord says you have to wait a
[18:32] little season
[18:34] so there's some more jews that have to
[18:35] die after the rapture now does that fit
[18:37] with everything we've been taught that
[18:38] the foolish virgin have to give their
[18:40] lives or take the mark of the beast
[18:43] some of the faithful jews will have to
[18:45] give their lives or they'll take the
[18:46] mark of the beast
[18:47] it lines up perfectly with what the
[18:49] bible says in hebrews 13.
[18:52] i'm sorry in revelation 13 because it
[18:54] talks about the mark of the beast in
[18:55] revelation 13.
[18:56] and he said your fellow servants and
[18:58] their brethren should be killed as they
[19:00] were
[19:01] and now these were all the blinded jews
[19:03] the thing about this this is all the
[19:04] blinded jews that couldn't see jesus as
[19:06] messiah that were martyred
[19:09] for their faith from jesus's time to the
[19:11] present think about that
[19:14] 2000 years almost a martyred jews and
[19:17] this includes over the 6 million
[19:19] holocaust victims
[19:21] and then the jews yet to die in the
[19:24] tribulation period my this is quite a
[19:25] multitude of people here
[19:28] this is quite a group and they're all
[19:30] crying out to god avenge our blood
[19:32] avenge our blood and god said it will
[19:34] come you'll be given white robes i hear
[19:37] your prayers but you've got to wait
[19:38] praise god oh isn't that something like
[19:40] sometimes we cry out to god and god said
[19:42] you must wait first
[19:44] we don't like doing it but god tells us
[19:46] sometimes we must wait praise god
[19:50] we don't get everything we want right
[19:51] away
[19:53] sometimes we've got to wait
[19:56] and sometimes there's other people that
[19:57] must give their lives there's other
[19:59] people that must
[20:01] give a testimony of jesus christ
[20:03] until all things be fulfilled now the
[20:06] sixth seal is very uh uh
[20:08] very simple uh in fact clarence larkin
[20:11] this is the only seal that brother
[20:13] branham agreed with clarence larkin on
[20:16] so what's one divided by seven i don't
[20:18] think i have my phone up here but you
[20:20] could do the
[20:21] you could do the math there real quick
[20:24] anybody got it
[20:26] who's this who's the smart guy
[20:28] 14 so so think about that
[20:31] brother branham got 100 of the seals
[20:33] right and larkin just by guessing got 14
[20:36] percent right
[20:38] and that's something he got 14 right
[20:40] because it wasn't his age it wasn't his
[20:42] time for the revelation of the seven
[20:43] seals
[20:45] and so when you probe see when we probe
[20:47] we're going to get a little bit of
[20:48] things right but not everything right
[20:50] that's why we should wait upon the lord
[20:52] for everything
[20:54] hallelujah
[20:55] god help us to wait
[20:57] now the symbols are the great earthquake
[20:59] now
[21:00] the worst earthquake in revelation
[21:01] actually i forgot to look that one up
[21:04] yeah so i actually forgot to update this
[21:06] slide yeah i'm sorry i forgot to update
[21:07] this slide
[21:09] uh it speaks when the sixth seal hits
[21:11] there's a great uh earthquake and
[21:13] brother adam says it's the
[21:15] two prophets that bring out the sixth
[21:17] seal they start the sixth seal because
[21:19] it's called the tribulation seal
[21:21] now as we've looked at i believe the
[21:23] first three and a half years uh are just
[21:25] the plagues that moses and elijah or two
[21:28] men with moses and elijah's spirit will
[21:31] bring forth upon the earth
[21:33] but i believe the trumpets and the viles
[21:35] and the woes are for later in the second
[21:37] half of the three
[21:39] so the second half of the seven weeks
[21:42] okay
[21:43] and that's because the bible says in
[21:44] revelation 7 that there the no tree can
[21:47] be hurt no grass can be heard nothing
[21:50] can be hurt until the 144 000 are sealed
[21:53] with the holy spirit
[21:55] amen
[21:56] that's what the bible says it's
[21:57] impossible so the great earthquake i
[21:59] believe this could be the los angeles
[22:01] earthquake this could be another
[22:02] earthquake there's a great one spoken of
[22:05] in revelation uh the bible says there's
[22:08] never been an earthquake like that
[22:10] nor since the time let me look it up
[22:12] here real quick anybody got it
[22:13] anybody been reading the revelation
[22:15] lately
[22:18] that's okay
[22:20] i don't have it either so it would be uh
[22:29] revelation 16. yeah okay revelation 16
[22:31] 18. there it is
[22:32] okay and this is speaking of the
[22:35] vials okay vials seven vows
[22:38] okay 16 18.
[22:40] got seven vows so vows are after the
[22:42] trumpets
[22:43] uh 1618 and there were voices and
[22:45] thunderings and lightnings there was a
[22:47] great earthquake such as was not since
[22:49] men were upon the earth so mighty
[22:51] earthquake and so great
[22:55] okay and then the great city that's got
[22:56] to be jerusalem was divided into three
[22:58] parts and the cities of the nations fell
[23:00] cities of the nations fell so cities are
[23:03] going to fall because this earthquake is
[23:04] going to be the greatest
[23:05] earthquake there ever was so i believe
[23:07] that's what it's speaking of that great
[23:08] earthquake and the sixth seal
[23:10] could be los angeles
[23:12] and then the bible said every mountain
[23:13] island were moved
[23:15] uh and there's a vile about that as well
[23:19] the bible said the islands fled away or
[23:21] fled away
[23:22] it's revelation 16 20. yes the two
[23:24] verses after that and every island and
[23:27] fled away and the mountains were not
[23:28] found
[23:30] so we see how the the sixth seal has to
[23:32] apply to all of that all of the
[23:35] destruction during the seven year great
[23:36] tribulation period
[23:38] here's the thought i had just briefly
[23:40] i'm starting to believe that the spirit
[23:42] of moses and elijah will just be a
[23:43] spirit on two men
[23:45] who are not moses and elijah and the
[23:47] reason i think that is because then
[23:48] moses would have to die twice
[23:50] and the bible says it's given for men
[23:52] once to die
[23:54] so that just scripture just came to me
[23:55] i'm just passing along just some food
[23:57] for thought okay
[23:59] i just thought i never thought about
[24:00] that before he's gotta die twice
[24:02] uh well maybe because the word was
[24:04] crucified twice maybe that would work
[24:06] too right it was crucified naturally and
[24:07] spiritually that's what the bible says
[24:09] in hebrews chapter six
[24:10] they crucify afresh the lord jesus
[24:12] christ spiritually so it could be it
[24:15] could be but it seems like it's just uh
[24:17] for men to die once okay so i'm just not
[24:19] gonna throw that little nugget out there
[24:20] we'll see if the lord ever you know if
[24:22] he terry's ever opens anything up about
[24:23] that but the bible said every free man
[24:26] hid the great men the mighty men or the
[24:28] common man
[24:30] because the great day of wrath has come
[24:32] and brother man tells us armageddon is
[24:34] the beginning of the lord's day he said
[24:36] this is the day of men now men exalt
[24:39] themselves now women exalt themselves
[24:40] now but when jesus comes back there will
[24:42] be no more exalting men or women praise
[24:45] god amen men and women will not control
[24:47] the events in the news oh thank god they
[24:50] won't control this governments and news
[24:52] but jesus christ will restore everything
[24:54] amen he'll control everything it'll be a
[24:56] new government a holy government praise
[24:59] god amen it'll be the lord's day praise
[25:01] god amen of course we know that day can
[25:03] represent a thousand years as one day
[25:05] with man is one day with the lord is a
[25:07] thousand years with man so it could
[25:09] represent that millennium coming in
[25:11] after the great battle of armageddon
[25:13] praise god i can represent that as well
[25:15] now the seventh seal i've always loved
[25:16] this picture since i've seen it a few
[25:17] years ago in the rapture you have all
[25:19] these people meeting in the air really
[25:20] they they kind of form up the one bride
[25:22] of jesus christ so it's like it's one
[25:24] group that represents i'm sorry it's a
[25:26] major huge group that represents one
[25:28] church
[25:29] one bride one wife praise god many
[25:31] members one wife
[25:33] hallelujah
[25:35] so i get jesus you get jesus too praise
[25:37] god we all get jesus hallelujah
[25:40] amen and of course this is revelation
[25:42] chapter eight no longer chapter six
[25:44] they're silent in heaven for half an
[25:46] hour
[25:47] i don't understand the half an hour
[25:48] apart but the only way it could be
[25:50] silence was if the four beasts uh would
[25:53] stop crying holy holy holy because the
[25:56] bible said they rest not day or night
[25:58] but they cry holy holy holy the lord god
[26:01] almighty
[26:02] so jesus's body would have to leave the
[26:05] seventh dimension and the four beasts
[26:07] would stop crying holy holy holy because
[26:09] he wouldn't be there
[26:11] and then jesus would come down to meet
[26:13] his bride in the air now
[26:15] i have to work that out if you had a
[26:18] thousand years
[26:19] was a day
[26:21] right so a thousand years is a day how
[26:23] much would half an hour of a day
[26:25] represent in years that's something i
[26:27] have to work out there i've done that
[26:28] before
[26:30] just kind of presuming all right
[26:32] so
[26:34] you know you'd have to kind of work that
[26:35] out by math i'm kind of unfamiliar with
[26:37] that math right now but
[26:39] if you look now if you look at the next
[26:41] there's that's the only symbol you're
[26:42] given but if you look at the next four
[26:44] verses after the seventh seal
[26:47] angels start preparing trumpets
[26:51] right right after the seven seals open
[26:54] and then the bible said all the prayers
[26:56] of the saints will be poured out
[26:59] so i believe all the uh all the bible
[27:02] evidence points to the seventh seal is
[27:04] the rapture of the bride of jesus christ
[27:07] and then as soon as soon as the rapture
[27:09] takes place then the angels start
[27:11] getting ready for the trumpets and the
[27:12] vials because it's a short time and then
[27:14] all the wrath of god is going to be
[27:16] poured out
[27:17] so i believe the context fits perfectly
[27:20] okay
[27:21] and of course there's lots of quotes
[27:23] like this i preached this a
[27:24] number of months ago but brother man
[27:26] said the seventh seal hasn't opened yet
[27:27] you know that's his coming and i'm just
[27:29] going to skip
[27:30] here's another one broken cisterns
[27:32] that last trumpet like the last seal
[27:35] will be the coming of the lord it shall
[27:37] sound and the dead in christ shall rise
[27:38] first the speaking of course of first
[27:40] thessalonians chapter four i'm not going
[27:42] to spend a lot of time because i
[27:43] preached these recently feast the
[27:45] trumpets
[27:46] to the seventh seal was the silence no
[27:48] one knew that was the minute or hour
[27:50] that christ was come as he revealed it
[27:52] to us
[27:53] the minute and hour glory amen the
[27:55] seventh seal is the moment of the
[27:57] rapture praise god
[27:59] it's the moment of the body change
[28:01] hallelujah
[28:02] okay
[28:03] that's the one i already showed you then
[28:04] he says it again
[28:06] the seventh seal the mystery of going
[28:09] it's the going it's when the bride is
[28:11] drawn up she's taken up the seventh seal
[28:13] is the rapture you'd be surprised how
[28:15] many preachers don't believe the seven
[28:16] seals the rapture you'd be surprised
[28:20] a lot of people believe it's already
[28:21] happened that's what that's what people
[28:23] are influencing today like it happened
[28:24] in 1963 well
[28:26] it just it doesn't make any sense praise
[28:28] god our lives are so wonderful sometimes
[28:31] there's no way this could be the
[28:32] tribulation period right there's no way
[28:35] but that's what some people believe
[28:36] because they're just trying to make all
[28:38] these quotes fit okay
[28:39] because remember each seal has three
[28:41] forms you have the symbol form
[28:43] and that was the silence in heaven
[28:44] that's the only real symbol given it's
[28:46] not really a symbol
[28:48] you have the reality form of the seven
[28:50] seal that's what we're waiting for
[28:51] that's the part of the seventh seal that
[28:53] hasn't opened up yet
[28:55] when is the day and the hour but the
[28:56] father keeps that to himself amen
[28:59] because he wants to find a bride who
[29:00] loves him so much he's waiting for
[29:02] they're waiting for his son to marry his
[29:04] son they're ready at any time hallelujah
[29:07] that's the kind of wife he wants for a
[29:09] son amen
[29:11] a lady who's just she's waiting and
[29:13] ready any time you come it's fine with
[29:15] me lord i'll be ready i'll be watching
[29:17] amen i'll be watching and praying with
[29:19] that evil anointing amen
[29:22] now the revelation of the seven seal's
[29:23] already been given
[29:24] it's the rapture
[29:26] it's already been revealed to us as
[29:28] brother adam said in march 24th
[29:30] it's the day and hour of the coming
[29:32] okay that's the revelation because jesus
[29:34] said but of that day and hour knoweth no
[29:36] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[29:38] father only
[29:41] souls that are imprisoned now the
[29:42] seventh is always the mystery watch that
[29:44] seven that's the finish that was the
[29:45] coming of the lord heaven was quiet
[29:47] silent nobody moved because jesus said
[29:49] not even an angel of heaven knows when i
[29:51] return i don't even know myself what
[29:53] time the father has put that in his own
[29:55] mind god alone knows that the spirit
[29:57] said i didn't know it then it wasn't
[29:58] revealed
[30:00] he said it wasn't give away what would
[30:02] take place
[30:04] hallelujah
[30:06] souls in our prison again remember he
[30:08] hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't
[30:10] do it when the angel stood day by day
[30:11] telling
[30:12] telling it but then he wouldn't do it he
[30:14] said there were silence in heaven no one
[30:16] knew it it was the coming of the lord
[30:19] okay we just went through that why is
[30:20] there silence in heaven oh yeah here's
[30:22] the quote from 1960. this just gives me
[30:23] the best insight that i can find jesus
[30:26] comes from heaven with ten thousand
[30:28] times ten thousand of his saints and the
[30:29] bible says the heavens was empty for the
[30:31] space a half hour where is this big
[30:33] fellow god then uh see he's in christ
[30:37] sure
[30:38] hallelujah praise god
[30:40] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[30:41] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[30:43] he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing
[30:45] about it even the angels didn't
[30:46] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[30:48] that's the reason under our seventh
[30:50] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[30:52] there was silence jesus when he was on
[30:54] the earth they wouldn't know when he
[30:55] would come he said it's not even the son
[30:58] himself don't even know what's gonna
[30:59] happen see god has this all to himself
[31:03] it's a secret that's the reason there
[31:04] was silence in heaven for the space half
[31:06] an hour and seven thunders under their
[31:08] voices and john was even forbidden to
[31:09] write it see the coming of the lord
[31:11] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[31:13] of how he will come and when he will
[31:15] become it's a good thing that he does it
[31:17] no
[31:18] can you imagine if all the catholics
[31:20] knew when he would come
[31:22] they'd be getting their prayer beads out
[31:24] right and thinking
[31:25] but see at that time they they'd be
[31:27] rejecting the revelation that god sent
[31:29] through his prophet
[31:31] they would try to get ready their own
[31:33] man-made way hallelujah praise god
[31:35] if they knew the coming they would try
[31:36] to get ready their own man made way they
[31:39] kiss the feet of the statues they look
[31:41] for blood to come out of the statues of
[31:42] mary they look at all these things
[31:44] they'd be get ready the wrong way but
[31:46] god keeps it a secret because he says
[31:48] those who have an ear to hear amen those
[31:51] who have the spiritual ear will hear
[31:53] what the spirit is saying praise god and
[31:55] the spirit will be telling them i'm
[31:57] coming soon i'm coming to get you i'm
[31:59] coming to catch you away it's a season
[32:01] of you're going away
[32:03] oh
[32:04] just like eliezer told rebecca it's the
[32:07] season of you're going away will you go
[32:10] away she knew it was soon and so it is
[32:12] with us god has sent us a prophet to
[32:14] tell us it's the soon going away you're
[32:16] going to meet isaac soon hallelujah
[32:19] glory hallelujah
[32:21] and the power of the camel has taken us
[32:22] there the power of the holy spirit
[32:24] is taking us to our isaac hallelujah
[32:27] oh it's beautiful
[32:28] now the coming lord is in mystery we
[32:30] don't know when he's coming how he's
[32:32] coming but we know he is coming
[32:35] and he said he never gave his mystery in
[32:37] full
[32:38] in other words he never told us the day
[32:40] of the hour okay so i'm going to skip
[32:43] past that now i want to read this one
[32:44] from the seventh seal
[32:49] now he says no angels no praises now
[32:51] speaking of the seventh seal no altar
[32:52] service no nothing there was silence
[32:54] hush deadly silence in heaven for half
[32:56] an hour all the hosts of heaven was
[32:58] silent for this half hour when the seven
[33:00] seal mystery in the book of redemption
[33:01] was broke open think of it but it's
[33:03] broke the lamb breaks it you know what
[33:05] they were all about i believe they
[33:06] didn't know there it was they just
[33:08] stopped why what is it
[33:10] now none of us know but i'm gonna tell
[33:12] you my revelation of it
[33:15] seven god's perfect number seven just
[33:17] right in a row seven thunders utters
[33:19] straight together like that they're
[33:20] spelling out something notice at that
[33:22] time john started to write and he said
[33:24] don't write it jesus never spoke about
[33:26] it
[33:27] john couldn't write it angels know
[33:30] nothing about it what is it it's the
[33:32] thing that jesus said even the angels of
[33:34] heaven didn't know nothing about it see
[33:36] he didn't know it himself he said only
[33:39] god would know it praise god
[33:42] you'd be surprised how many people can
[33:43] listen to sermon and not get the same
[33:45] conclusion we are
[33:47] and yet it's plainly stated right there
[33:50] only god would know it that's the day
[33:52] and the hour of the rapture that's the
[33:54] only thing that jesus didn't know as far
[33:56] as the scripture right
[33:57] that tells us in the scripture now of
[33:58] course he didn't know some people would
[34:00] be healed like the woman with the blood
[34:01] issue certain things the father didn't
[34:03] make known to jesus
[34:05] but he said but he told us when we begin
[34:07] to see these signs coming up now you're
[34:09] getting somewhere notice we notice we
[34:11] can see these signs coming up now
[34:13] brother is talking about all the signs
[34:14] in his ministry like the experience with
[34:17] the sword of the king
[34:18] right and the junior jackson's dream of
[34:20] the white rock and the pyramid maybe i
[34:21] have to go back over that again another
[34:23] all these things just point to brother
[34:24] random getting the revelation the seven
[34:26] seals and speaking the revelation with
[34:28] thus saith the lord i'm just doing a
[34:30] quick summary praise god
[34:32] he has all these signs he's to go out
[34:34] west and meet the seven angels and the
[34:36] whole and the seven angels send him back
[34:38] to open the seven seals right to preach
[34:40] the revelation of seven seals all those
[34:43] dreams all those signs were to let us
[34:45] know that jesus is getting his bride
[34:47] ready the mystery of god is being
[34:49] finished revelations are being unveiled
[34:51] and we're the ones we're the
[34:52] beneficiaries we're the ones who enjoy
[34:54] the finished mystery of god
[34:56] amen my
[34:58] there's the scripture again but of that
[35:00] day in that hour no man no not the angel
[35:03] who's in heaven neither the son
[35:06] but the father only the father knows
[35:08] that day and hour
[35:10] hallelujah
[35:12] now i just want to take a few minutes on
[35:14] this i've only been preaching for half
[35:15] an hour so
[35:16] i'm trying to preach an hour and a half
[35:18] today by god's grace
[35:20] so this week i've been studying on
[35:23] the seven seals and of course you know
[35:25] there was
[35:27] you may know because i told you
[35:29] the group that's left the message the
[35:30] most well-known one i don't like to call
[35:32] their names anymore cause i don't have
[35:33] nothing against them
[35:34] i just don't like to call their names so
[35:35] much anymore
[35:37] if they're watching i love you guys as
[35:38] always god bless you
[35:40] but
[35:41] they made videos in april uh that said
[35:44] brother man stole all the seven seals
[35:46] now that fired me up so i went and
[35:47] studied uh charles days russell and
[35:50] larkin and showed how brother ram did
[35:51] not plagiarize him i got a podcast on it
[35:53] i asked amen can i record that one alone
[35:55] he's like sure brother yeah cause i just
[35:57] wanted to get it out as soon as possible
[35:59] but uh
[36:00] it's clear god gave brother brown the
[36:02] revelation of the seven seals i just
[36:04] want to just go through these now here's
[36:06] the accusation on the first video
[36:08] they say uh brother graham did not have
[36:10] a special revelation
[36:12] they said he stole it from larkin and
[36:14] charles says russell now larkin was a
[36:16] baptist preacher charles tays russell
[36:18] eventually his followers became the
[36:20] jehovah's witnesses they're the ones
[36:21] that go door to door
[36:23] okay and they're say they'll say did you
[36:25] know jehovah
[36:27] god's name is not jesus we met one
[36:29] member brother we went a giant eagle up
[36:30] there in that place before cloven
[36:32] he's like do you remember he said he
[36:34] said do you know his name's not jesus
[36:36] i'm like okay i know this guy is
[36:41] so you know what remember i remember
[36:42] where i took him i took him to
[36:43] philippians chapter two
[36:44] the name above all names is jesus christ
[36:47] so i said you can call him jehovah but
[36:49] jehovah means jehovah is our salvation
[36:51] right
[36:52] i'm sorry jehovah's self-existent one
[36:54] joshua is jehovah's our salvation and
[36:56] that's what i shared with him and then
[36:57] he walked away because he don't want to
[36:59] hear he's just got his own
[37:00] denominational thought now they're the
[37:01] ones that don't take miracles either
[37:04] they won't my wife told the testimony of
[37:07] my mom being here with cancer and they
[37:08] walked away from our house
[37:10] that was kind of good in one way but i
[37:11] was another way i wish they'd receive it
[37:14] and they just said well i don't know if
[37:15] that was god or not can you imagine
[37:17] not believing god does miracles
[37:19] and they have to earn their salvation i
[37:22] was listening to a former jehovah's
[37:24] witness say if they're not constantly
[37:25] going door to door they're not assured
[37:27] of their salvation because they say then
[37:29] you don't have any works you have no
[37:30] real faith now think about that
[37:32] that's a works based salvation
[37:34] now they st how come they stopped going
[37:36] door to door now that covet hit
[37:38] see they're scared
[37:39] right
[37:40] they haven't come to our door anymore i
[37:42] don't see them walking around anymore
[37:43] like they used to uh but anyways that's
[37:45] charles says russell eventually his
[37:48] followers started uh jehovah's witnesses
[37:53] and brother man was accused of stealing
[37:55] it
[37:56] but we know he got it directly from god
[37:58] and i'm just gonna choose today just for
[38:00] time's sake i'm just gonna do the first
[38:01] seal
[38:02] just to show you and i got the pictures
[38:05] like i told you i've got my receipts
[38:07] emma
[38:08] i made sure i get my receipts right
[38:10] lydia
[38:12] i just like to i'd like to know what i'm
[38:13] talking about praise god
[38:15] and so these guys can make they make a
[38:16] four-minute video about the first seal i
[38:18] made like an hour long video about this
[38:20] the seals not being plagiarized now
[38:22] which which and they have like one
[38:24] sentence and i've got all these
[38:25] different quotes which one are you going
[38:26] to believe who did in other words who
[38:28] did more research
[38:29] we did more research
[38:30] in other words
[38:32] so it just it burns me up but that's
[38:34] okay
[38:36] deceivers must come the bible says
[38:38] those that bring offenses must come but
[38:40] we'll stand for the truth praise god
[38:42] so let me just give you a brother brahm
[38:44] said the timing when was the timing of
[38:46] the first seal he said it started in the
[38:48] first church age and that's an exact
[38:49] quote
[38:50] now there are quotes i don't know if
[38:52] william knows this there are quotes
[38:53] brother graham said the church ages
[38:54] started at jesus's resurrection
[38:57] so there are quotes that say the church
[38:58] the first church age started in 80 30. i
[39:00] don't know if you knew that
[39:01] uh
[39:02] but the church age book says it started
[39:04] in 53 a.d now to me it doesn't matter
[39:06] it's just 23 years difference
[39:08] i tend to believe it did start in 30 a.d
[39:09] because that's when they were the church
[39:10] they were filled with the holy ghost
[39:12] that's that's my thought
[39:14] but whatever reason in the church age
[39:16] book brother ramsey started in 53 a.d
[39:19] doesn't matter
[39:21] but anyways this uh the timing was this
[39:24] white horse rider rode from the first
[39:26] church age until he had power to kill
[39:28] with the sword then brother ramsey said
[39:30] he jumped off his white horse imagine he
[39:31] jumps off his white horse and he climbs
[39:33] up on a bloody red horse he throws his
[39:35] leg over and now he's a bloody red horse
[39:37] rider with a great sword
[39:41] so when i studied history at edward
[39:43] broad that's the name of that historian
[39:44] brother brandon actually read him too
[39:46] he said the first time the catholic
[39:48] church with united church and state
[39:50] killed a martyr was in 385 a.d
[39:54] see they got the power through
[39:55] constantine remember around 325 the
[39:57] nicean council
[39:59] they actually rejected the humanity of
[40:01] jesus they actually rejected that
[40:03] because arius was there and he was
[40:04] saying jesus body was a creative being
[40:07] and these catholics shut him out and
[40:08] said no he's the eternal son we preach
[40:10] that on wednesday night he's the eternal
[40:11] son he
[40:13] and eris is just he's standing up for
[40:14] the humanity of christ christ did have a
[40:16] human side
[40:18] he said i'm the beginning of the
[40:19] creation of god amen
[40:21] so aerys was standing up but these
[40:23] catholics with constantine they kicked
[40:25] him out and they said oh jesus we're
[40:26] just going to call him the eternal son
[40:28] well five years after that constantine
[40:31] moved the headquarters
[40:33] from his headquarters from rome to
[40:35] constantinople he made his own city
[40:37] named it after himself
[40:39] a real humble and he called himself the
[40:40] 13th apostle
[40:42] can you believe that he called himself
[40:43] the 13th apostle after you know peter or
[40:46] whatever
[40:47] and then he killed his son and his
[40:48] mother
[40:49] this man he saw the vision of the cross
[40:51] got a victory but then
[40:52] it shows he never really had a real
[40:54] conversion you should i'm going to
[40:54] preach on constantine pretty soon well
[40:56] whenever i get to that chapter seven
[40:58] oh it's such an example of judas is
[41:00] scared or like balaam you can have the
[41:02] anointing for specific things but if you
[41:05] don't continually feed on the word of
[41:06] god if you don't daily confess your sins
[41:09] that satan's going to take you farther
[41:10] than you want to go praise god
[41:13] you've got to daily confess these things
[41:14] i don't you might have some great
[41:16] beautiful testimonies but if you don't
[41:17] continue in the word then you'll fall
[41:19] from the word
[41:21] the bible jesus said you'll fall from
[41:22] your your own steadfastness
[41:25] right you'll fall from that
[41:27] so you must continue in the word of god
[41:29] you might had a good start but he had an
[41:30] awful end
[41:32] and so when he moved the capital of of
[41:35] italy from rome to continental
[41:38] he was separating the civil from the
[41:40] religious and then the focus and
[41:42] you know rome only lasted about 200 more
[41:44] years after that
[41:46] the pagan rome but then the focus came
[41:49] on the church of first church of rome
[41:51] which eventually became the catholic
[41:52] church
[41:53] and 300 years later the first pope came
[41:55] out of there boniface
[41:57] pope boniface was the first pope in 606
[42:00] a.d
[42:01] okay so there's a lot of history in
[42:03] there i'm just kind of pouring it in
[42:04] there praise god but that's what brother
[42:06] brown did when the holy ghost was on him
[42:08] hallelujah preach those seven seal
[42:10] messages hallelujah
[42:12] so the first seal was about 30 a.d or 53
[42:14] a.d which is about 385 a.d
[42:18] and who is that writer
[42:19] brotherham said he was the nickel lane
[42:21] spirit to begin with or the antichrist
[42:23] spirit in other words the spirit of
[42:25] death
[42:27] and then he become incarnate in a man
[42:29] and when he was crowned he received a
[42:31] throne and was crowned
[42:34] okay
[42:35] so at some point the bishop of rome
[42:38] uh became the of the he the bishop is
[42:41] the pastor the pastor of the first
[42:42] church of rome eventually got a crown
[42:44] during this time
[42:46] eventually got a crowd
[42:48] okay now here's clarence locker nice
[42:50] looking fellow there he's a guy that can
[42:52] draw he's a really good draw he's going
[42:54] to drew the future home that i love so
[42:55] much
[42:56] so what was his now
[42:58] that's what the video says brother adam
[43:00] plagiarized clarence larkin well let's
[43:02] look
[43:03] what did he say
[43:04] in other words this white horse rider is
[43:06] the antichrist did brother ram say that
[43:08] yeah but he said the spirit of the
[43:09] antichrist
[43:11] he said he is the prince who is to come
[43:13] of daniel's vision of 70 weeks who will
[43:15] confirm for one week the last or seventh
[43:19] week with daniel's people the jews
[43:21] daniel 9 27 did you catch that
[43:24] is the timing the same
[43:26] as brother branham's and larkins
[43:28] no
[43:29] it's a two thousand year difference
[43:32] his his antichrist white horse rider
[43:34] hasn't even rode yet according to his
[43:36] understanding
[43:38] praise god that's that's what happens
[43:40] when a man tries to guess he gets 14
[43:42] right
[43:43] right
[43:45] the only one he got right larkin got
[43:47] right was the sixth seal
[43:49] he didn't get any other ones right
[43:52] 14 right on a man's guessing uh
[43:55] percentage on uh can you guess prophecy
[43:57] can you can you guess fulfilled prophecy
[43:59] man gets it right 14 percent of time now
[44:01] he's a good man as far as i know he's a
[44:02] good man
[44:03] so what's the conclusion brother
[44:05] branham's first seal started 2 000 years
[44:07] before larkins
[44:09] and brother man said the writer was a
[44:11] spirit let me say this a universal
[44:13] spirit
[44:14] a universal spirit in other words all
[44:16] the evil churches
[44:18] the antichrist spirits in those churches
[44:20] brother ram said that was the white
[44:21] horse rider in all the churches
[44:24] but larkin said it's just one man it's
[44:26] one man once the tribulation starts who
[44:29] be in other words the pope who becomes
[44:30] the antichrist
[44:32] so see brother brown had a greater
[44:33] understanding and that matches up with
[44:35] what john said john said even now there
[44:37] are many antichrists entered into the
[44:39] world praise god remember that many so
[44:42] brother man recognized it was a spirit
[44:43] that was upon many many false preachers
[44:46] that were anointed with the false
[44:47] antichrist spirit
[44:49] larkin said it's just one man and it
[44:50] hasn't even happened yet
[44:53] and those liars are getting on there i'm
[44:55] going to call them liars like the holy
[44:56] spirit can rebuke you but then give give
[44:58] you love right i just said like stephen
[45:01] it was liars to say brother man
[45:03] plagiarized from larkin he didn't play
[45:04] jurassic rock
[45:08] and i stand by my research
[45:11] because it was god leading me there just
[45:12] like god led brother graham to the books
[45:13] god led brother to certain parts of
[45:15] research
[45:16] larkin said the writer is a literal man
[45:18] uh of the antichrist during the great
[45:20] tribulation so is there plagiarism there
[45:21] no sir
[45:23] all right here's the one who uh charles
[45:24] says russell he started the uh his
[45:27] people founded that jehovah's witnesses
[45:28] so no miracles group door-to-door group
[45:31] uh the title of the book was the
[45:33] finished mystery so he believed he was
[45:35] revelation 10 7. is that something look
[45:37] 1917
[45:39] eight years after brother branham uh was
[45:41] born
[45:42] elijah was getting ready to come on the
[45:44] scene and this guy caught the revelation
[45:46] the mystery of god's going to be
[45:47] finished he was getting caught up around
[45:48] that spirit of prophecy and he said i
[45:50] must be
[45:52] the elijah he called himself the elijah
[45:54] in church you know his pyramid i'm sorry
[45:56] his tomb is a pyramid just like brother
[45:59] adams
[46:00] do you know that
[46:02] you should look it up it's a pyramid
[46:05] he was so caught up in this oh the
[46:07] mysteries of god are going to be
[46:08] finished i got to preach daniel i got to
[46:09] preach revelation
[46:11] i am i am
[46:13] i'm the elijah messenger to fulfill
[46:14] revelation 10 7.
[46:16] he got so caught up in it
[46:18] that he even had himself uh he had the
[46:20] revelation the future holds the pyramid
[46:21] he had that
[46:23] see because it was the time for it
[46:24] church it was the time for it remember
[46:27] there was people in jesus day that were
[46:29] not with jesus casting out devils
[46:32] right and the disciples said you got to
[46:33] follow us you got to come to our church
[46:35] what happened they got under the same
[46:36] anointing it's a time for miracles glory
[46:39] it was a time for devils being cast out
[46:41] it was time for the dead to be raised
[46:43] and so the people can feel this is time
[46:45] prophecy is being fulfilled and they
[46:47] fell under it praise god
[46:49] ah god help us to feel what anointing
[46:52] what prophecy is being fulfilled right
[46:53] now praise god
[46:56] to take this gospel it's the revelation
[46:58] 10. amen eat this book and prophesy
[47:01] again hallelujah
[47:02] tell the nations tell the people praise
[47:04] god that's why internet's been a great
[47:06] help to us to spread the message praise
[47:07] god
[47:11] so when was his timing
[47:13] uh his timing was his own epoch which is
[47:16] the church age that of smyrna
[47:20] and who's his writer now look his writer
[47:23] is just one man it's the bishop of rome
[47:25] in other words the pastor of the first
[47:26] church of rome
[47:28] his bishop means bastard overseer
[47:31] the embryo pope so in other words the
[47:33] baby form of the pope
[47:35] so the pope was eventually going to be
[47:37] formed but it was going to happen in 606
[47:39] a.d he became the universal pope
[47:42] but the bishop there who was there at
[47:44] the beginning
[47:45] of the bishop of rome the pastor he was
[47:47] the he was the white horse rider in the
[47:50] embryo or the baby form
[47:53] now look at this here this is
[47:54] unbelievable and this is the part that
[47:56] the
[47:57] accusers
[47:58] left out of their video
[48:00] he said the white horse look he said the
[48:02] white horse was the doctrine
[48:05] and teachings of the lord and the
[48:07] apostle
[48:09] can you imagine that
[48:11] a bishop of rome is writing and he's
[48:14] writing on the true teachings of the
[48:17] lord and the apostles that's not what
[48:20] brother branham said
[48:22] a little brother said a horse is a
[48:24] charger it's a power in other words the
[48:26] white horse was an evil spirit
[48:29] and here he says no the white horse was
[48:32] actually the right spirit
[48:35] see that's the part they leave out of
[48:36] the video and i'm like
[48:37] i just want i just want to write a
[48:39] comment this is some of the weakest
[48:40] research and with all broadly love this
[48:42] is the weakest research i've ever seen
[48:46] and they always pat themselves on the
[48:47] back we're the great researchers we do
[48:48] research we take everything back to the
[48:49] bible well you should have read on a few
[48:51] more sentences
[48:53] and i say that in love
[48:58] and here's the receipt here's the
[48:59] screenshot
[49:01] behold a white horse this is charles
[49:03] says russell jehovah's witness the
[49:04] doctrines teachings of the lord the
[49:06] apostles recognized as the one and only
[49:07] rule of faith and practice of god god's
[49:09] church the bishop of rome is writing
[49:12] jesus and peter's
[49:14] uh teachings no he wasn't
[49:16] he wasn't propagating the true facts
[49:18] they they uh the history says they
[49:20] instituted uh infant baptism there's no
[49:23] infant baptism in the bible
[49:26] history says they put the father son
[49:27] holy ghost in there that's not what the
[49:29] apostles taught that's not what jesus
[49:31] taught jesus told peter it's in my name
[49:33] praise god
[49:34] hallelujah
[49:36] and he that sat on him the bishop of
[49:38] rome the embryo pope the
[49:40] personal representative of satan
[49:45] okay and here's more
[49:48] uh russell said john's epic or church
[49:50] age was from smyrna age which lasted 73
[49:53] to 325 so here's where he saw the voice
[49:56] of thunder and i saw john behold the
[49:58] vision of the first strange wonderful
[49:59] feature of the divine plan for the
[50:00] permission of evil as it relates to the
[50:02] epics
[50:03] of the church or church ages of the
[50:05] church beyond his own epic that of
[50:07] samurai so john saw the first white
[50:10] horse rider and it was going to be the
[50:11] the time period of the summer church age
[50:14] which he said was 73 to 325 a.d
[50:19] all right
[50:21] so i'm giving you the timing so i'm
[50:22] going to do these conclusion slides so
[50:23] you i know it's a lot of information but
[50:25] you can see it
[50:26] so let's look at the conclusion brother
[50:28] brandon's first seal started either 20
[50:30] or 40 years before russell's and lasted
[50:33] 60 years longer
[50:35] that's the first difference is that
[50:36] plagiarism no
[50:39] plagiarism is copying and stealing
[50:41] somebody else's thought and presenting
[50:43] it as yours
[50:45] and failing to mention them
[50:47] and brotherhood said the writer was a
[50:49] spirit and then became a pope russell
[50:52] said it was just a man
[50:54] russell missed this whole thing about
[50:56] the many antichrists because he wasn't a
[50:58] bible-based prophet amen
[51:01] but a bible-based prophet has got to
[51:02] teach you the bible praise god
[51:05] and he left out john's words how there's
[51:07] many antichrists already entered into
[51:09] the world he left that out and he just
[51:11] singled it down it's one man
[51:13] but man said no it's one evil spirit
[51:15] impacting the eterna i'm sorry the
[51:17] entire universal church
[51:19] that's falling away of course not the
[51:20] true church they were rebuking that
[51:21] devil they were they were casting out
[51:23] that devil amen in jesus name hallelujah
[51:28] and church russell never even mentioned
[51:30] the nicolaitan spirit in that in that
[51:32] whole page those two pages you never
[51:34] mentioned the nicolaitane spirit
[51:37] and brother ram never used the words
[51:39] bishop of rome in the entire first seal
[51:41] look it up you get a chance
[51:43] he never even used it brotherhood did
[51:45] not even quote this right here the
[51:46] bishop of rome brother i never recorded
[51:48] that in the first seal
[51:50] bill abraham said the white horse was a
[51:52] deceiving spirit russell said it was the
[51:54] doctrine of the lord and the apostles
[51:57] that's you can't get any different from
[51:59] that
[52:00] right what's the opposite of good evil
[52:04] what's the opposite of holy evil
[52:07] brother man said the horse is evil
[52:09] russell said the horse is holy who's
[52:10] right the man who's got thus saith the
[52:12] lord hallelujah
[52:14] is it evil white horse praise god oh
[52:16] church aren't you glad the accusation is
[52:18] the main accusation is that brother man
[52:20] plagiarized him and i just showed you
[52:22] with just
[52:23] two little snippets of one page two
[52:25] little snippets brother ram did not
[52:26] plagiarize we are standing on truth
[52:29] they're attacking our god-given face
[52:30] hallelujah
[52:32] let me just share this and i showed you
[52:34] this before the reason they do this is
[52:36] because they don't love the doctrine
[52:37] that we love
[52:40] remember i showed you this months ago
[52:43] the people that leave the message
[52:44] there's at least 14 or 15 doctrines they
[52:47] deny
[52:49] the reason they're attacking us is not
[52:51] because they don't like brother braham
[52:52] so much it's because they don't love the
[52:54] spirit of truth they don't want to live
[52:56] a holy life
[52:59] see they want to allow people to be
[53:00] homosexuals they would allow them to
[53:01] remarry like one of the most famous
[53:03] pastors remarried his daughter two or
[53:05] three times
[53:06] fornication murder through birth control
[53:08] pills they allow women preachers
[53:12] substance abuse viewing sinful content
[53:14] like there's this one man he's the he's
[53:16] one of the leaders now against brother
[53:17] branham and you know what he says he
[53:18] likes watching all these dirty movies
[53:20] ocean's 11 you can name it murder movies
[53:23] all these things he said he hopes he can
[53:25] dress up like dracula for halloween this
[53:27] year and watch the movie dracula blood
[53:30] sucking demonic power
[53:32] uh
[53:34] that's what he said and he says he's
[53:36] free in christ he's not free in christ
[53:38] we're free in christ amen
[53:40] we've got the holy spirit we believe in
[53:42] holiness the bible said i was sent no
[53:44] wicked thing before my eyes praise god
[53:47] and he said he's gonna he's gonna let
[53:48] his children watch dracula the movie and
[53:50] then dress up like dracula he said put
[53:51] on the blood on because it's just having
[53:53] fun i just heard it this week on the on
[53:54] the podcast and these are the people
[53:56] that attacking us we're trying to live
[53:58] holy
[53:59] and they're trying to enjoy the things
[54:01] of the world and say they're right and
[54:03] promote themselves as some greater uh
[54:05] greater revelation and accuse brother
[54:07] bam uh hallelujah but jesus said by
[54:09] their fruits you shall know them
[54:11] ah i just gotta examine the fruit but
[54:14] we've got some fruits out there we've
[54:15] got some vegetables out there right how
[54:16] do you know how do you know you're gonna
[54:17] eat it well just flip it over look it
[54:19] over
[54:20] see the people that don't examine these
[54:22] people that leave the message if you
[54:23] don't examine it you're not going to see
[54:24] their evil fruits now you know they're
[54:26] wrong but when you start examining their
[54:28] fruits you say oh that's rotten oh
[54:29] there's a rotten spot oh there's some
[54:31] there's some worms in there church
[54:32] that's what we see there's some worms in
[54:34] their doctrine now they let women
[54:35] preachers come in now they watch
[54:36] wickedness now they believe there's only
[54:38] one work of grace now that their women
[54:40] dress sexy but we will stand on paul's
[54:42] gospel amen that's what all those
[54:44] millions were shouting brother william
[54:46] those millions were shouting we're
[54:48] resting on the fact brother branham
[54:50] preached paul's gospel amen that's what
[54:52] i'm resting on hallelujah
[54:54] thank you jesus
[54:56] they believe god's three persons now
[54:58] like we saw on wednesday he wasn't
[55:00] lonely because he could always talk to
[55:01] the dove
[55:02] and then he could talk to his father
[55:03] jesus was never lonely because if want
[55:05] to talk you dove can you cool on my
[55:06] shoulder can you give me some fellowship
[55:08] father can you give me a hug i just need
[55:09] some fellowship you see this is
[55:11] ridiculous
[55:12] that's what they believe amen
[55:15] and then cross-dressing
[55:17] which they wouldn't answer that on my
[55:18] debate well they said it's always wrong
[55:21] but they wouldn't condemn crossdressing
[55:23] on the debate
[55:25] because they said oh everything's just
[55:26] wrong
[55:28] and they didn't some of them deny like
[55:30] the jehovah's witnesses the gifts of the
[55:32] holy ghost they want the holy ghost come
[55:33] in there
[55:34] now that's just 15 right there 14 now
[55:37] this one's not in crossdressing is not
[55:39] in the new testament but we know by
[55:40] revelation abominations carry over to
[55:42] the new testament
[55:44] we know that by revelation
[55:46] we can see it i've got a whole video on
[55:47] that if you want to know about that
[55:50] so see what are they're getting under
[55:51] the jezebel spirit
[55:53] all right we're all the same we're all
[55:55] we're all christians there's and they're
[55:57] they're they're they're sure there's no
[55:59] such thing as wise and foolish virgin
[56:01] well then why did jesus put in the bible
[56:03] then why did paul why did john say the
[56:05] rest of the dead live not to the
[56:07] thousand years we're finished why the
[56:08] bible say that
[56:10] why did paul say i will do anything that
[56:12] by any means i might attain to the first
[56:15] resurrection praise god
[56:17] in other words there's something a human
[56:18] glory has to sacrifice if he wants or
[56:21] she wants to be a part of the first
[56:22] resurrection praise god you've got to
[56:24] sacrifice all your thinking all your
[56:26] sinful desires all your your sinful
[56:28] paths all that must be sacrificed and by
[56:30] any means you must press on toward the
[56:32] mark of the high calling and god will
[56:34] give you a place in the rapture and the
[56:36] first resurrection amen
[56:38] you've got to love god with all your
[56:40] heart soul mind and strength and this is
[56:42] what we're standing on the unchanging
[56:44] body word of the son of man in other
[56:46] words we're standing on the thus saith
[56:48] the lord of jesus christ hallelujah amen
[56:52] hallelujah
[56:54] when i heard that about dracula i jumped
[56:56] out of my seat i'm like
[56:58] i like to tell these guys something
[57:01] did they ever watch the dragon i mean i
[57:02] was a sinner i watched dracula movies
[57:05] wickedness i would watch some of those
[57:07] horror movies by the way and i'd be
[57:08] scared for the next month
[57:10] i'd be peeking out of the showers like
[57:11] anybody out there to kill me with a
[57:12] knife
[57:15] right every time i was in the uh at
[57:17] night park in the car be like looking
[57:18] out anybody in the back of my seat they
[57:20] might jump in my car they're going to
[57:21] kill me while i'm in the back of my car
[57:23] like a spirit of fear fear that's not
[57:26] fun that's called fear
[57:28] as soon as you let the first one in then
[57:29] you go to a more wicked one
[57:31] and then that that that type isn't
[57:33] enough for it just like pornography
[57:34] right
[57:35] one little picture and then a video and
[57:37] then movie it just goes and same with
[57:39] this one
[57:40] this doesn't scare me anymore now i got
[57:41] to go further and further and pretty
[57:43] soon they dress up like freddy krueger
[57:44] or whatever
[57:46] you see little kids dressing up like
[57:47] chucky that dow
[57:50] i hope you don't know that one but
[57:51] i did
[57:53] he used to watch those awful things
[57:55] but see they fall under all these evil
[57:57] spirits
[58:00] see they're getting full of all these
[58:01] unclean spirits but you and i are called
[58:03] to be filled with the holy spirit
[58:06] glory
[58:07] and not let all these demons lust
[58:09] unclean spirits cross-dressing
[58:11] lying spirits deceiving spirits pride
[58:14] spirits right we see that the message
[58:15] pride lust
[58:17] all these things they fall under these
[58:19] seducing spirits but you and i are kept
[58:21] free from that jesus says if you keep
[58:23] the word of my patience i will keep you
[58:25] from the hour temptation that will come
[58:28] upon the whole earth praise god
[58:30] keep the commandments of the lord how
[58:31] many will do it by god's grace
[58:33] is it already okay we had a long song
[58:35] service right so that's why the time
[58:36] changer
[58:38] okay let me try to finish up here my
[58:39] contest
[58:41] everybody enjoying the word of god today
[58:45] and somebody asked me on the they were a
[58:46] young christian they said i'm a young
[58:48] christian but can you explain to me i
[58:50] don't think we're supposed to defend the
[58:51] gospel
[58:53] i said well go to philippians chapter
[58:55] one brother
[58:57] twice paul says i am set in other words
[58:59] god ordained me to defend the gospel
[59:01] and the word defend means to give a
[59:03] verbal argument
[59:05] that's what it means
[59:07] give a reason with your words for the it
[59:09] means an answer give an answer for the
[59:12] hope of calling of jesus christ in your
[59:14] life we're supposed to have answers for
[59:16] these lying devils we're supposed to
[59:18] have answers
[59:19] that's how you defend the gospel
[59:21] that's how you tell the devil you know
[59:23] it is real
[59:24] oh yeah
[59:25] he does he is the same yesterday today
[59:27] and forever
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:29] there is a spirit of truth amen you can
[59:31] find truth god can show you revelations
[59:34] god's here to teach us more god wants to
[59:36] take us deeper in the things of god god
[59:38] is real
[59:39] amen
[59:42] so
[59:43] it wasn't the white horse wasn't the
[59:45] doctrine of christ
[59:47] and the apostles
[59:49] wasn't
[59:50] it was an evil power it was a demonic
[59:53] power
[59:56] so the this is the this is the first
[59:58] seal and they're already saying brother
[1:00:00] man plagiarize him anybody with any
[1:00:02] ability to read i'd say a fifth grade
[1:00:04] education could read these pages
[1:00:07] and see brother brown did not plagiarize
[1:00:09] that
[1:00:10] see the radical church here's what i
[1:00:12] believe too these people when before
[1:00:13] they left they never even studied and
[1:00:16] prayed
[1:00:17] about the message like they should have
[1:00:19] and this is the danger like i told you
[1:00:20] about a few weeks ago
[1:00:22] going to church on sunday and wednesday
[1:00:24] is not enough for anybody you have to
[1:00:26] seek god every day of your life
[1:00:28] these guys that one guy went to church
[1:00:30] brother for 40 years and that one
[1:00:32] preacher preached for 33 years before he
[1:00:34] left the message
[1:00:35] at some point they stopped confessing
[1:00:37] their sins they stopped seeking god for
[1:00:39] truth they started being swayed by other
[1:00:40] people that one pastor that was there
[1:00:42] for 33 years he even admitted i started
[1:00:44] preaching about just what people were
[1:00:46] saying around the internet instead of
[1:00:47] feeding the sheep
[1:00:49] and then he eventually that was jeff
[1:00:51] jenkins and then he eventually called
[1:00:52] brother brandon a liar he calls him a
[1:00:54] liar now
[1:00:55] he got away from feeding the people the
[1:00:57] word of god he got away from feeding
[1:00:59] them and just want to try to solve all
[1:01:00] these problems
[1:01:02] now church
[1:01:03] we're unique we have the internet right
[1:01:04] so we can
[1:01:05] by god's grace i can defend that and
[1:01:07] then i can also feed you at the same
[1:01:08] time i believe that hallelujah that's
[1:01:10] what i believe because i've done it all
[1:01:12] these years praise god i've done it and
[1:01:14] if you're not fed let's come come talk
[1:01:15] to me about it and show me i'll try to
[1:01:17] point you where i preach here i try to
[1:01:18] preach there
[1:01:19] by god's grace to do the best i can amen
[1:01:23] i got to defend it but i also got to
[1:01:24] teach and feed the flock the people of
[1:01:26] god
[1:01:27] and i like this this series was from by
[1:01:28] the men's request right
[1:01:30] so see the people need to feed on some
[1:01:32] of these revelations so we're bringing
[1:01:34] them out to teach the people
[1:01:35] hallelujah praise god so did he did he
[1:01:38] the brother man plagiarized him not even
[1:01:39] close it's this now this just you know
[1:01:41] this is the second closest
[1:01:44] of all the seals the closest was the
[1:01:45] larkin where larkin brother brother ram
[1:01:47] and larkin agreed completely on the
[1:01:49] sixth seal this is probably the second
[1:01:50] closest but it's still such a big
[1:01:52] difference the timing's not the same
[1:01:55] the horses are not the same and the
[1:01:57] writer is not the same
[1:02:01] also this brother branham's first seal
[1:02:03] showed the early church was anointed by
[1:02:05] the lion anointing and said it was thus
[1:02:07] saith the lord
[1:02:09] brother ram said the lion anointing
[1:02:10] empowered the early saints to save the
[1:02:12] world
[1:02:13] how did you understand that church in
[1:02:15] other words their anointing saved the
[1:02:16] believers for that day that means our
[1:02:18] anointing is going to save the world for
[1:02:20] this day hallelujah
[1:02:22] don't leave yourself out of there put
[1:02:23] yourself in the seals we're in the
[1:02:25] fourth seal the anointing on you will
[1:02:27] save the world praise god
[1:02:31] it'll save those souls that are elected
[1:02:33] to salvation
[1:02:34] it'll save austin it'll save elena
[1:02:36] praise god
[1:02:38] it'll save a jesse smith amen they'll
[1:02:39] say but kristen smith he'll save a bang
[1:02:41] yang amen put your name in there it'll
[1:02:43] save you praise god amen
[1:02:46] this anointing of the holy spirit saves
[1:02:48] you it's a prophetic anointing you can
[1:02:50] understand for prophetic revelations
[1:02:52] because you're an eagle praise god
[1:02:55] hallelujah jesus said where the carcass
[1:02:57] is let the eagles be gathered there amen
[1:03:00] he said this is an enzyme revelation
[1:03:02] eagle's feast on the rape revealed word
[1:03:04] of god the fresh word of god this is
[1:03:06] fresh revelation it's been hidden for
[1:03:08] 2000 years but it's been freshly
[1:03:10] revealed to us in our day hallelujah
[1:03:13] there's my hour
[1:03:15] okay i'm almost done
[1:03:20] now look what look what look what uh
[1:03:21] russell said
[1:03:23] yeah
[1:03:24] yeah brother ram said the anointing
[1:03:26] saved the world russell said god forsook
[1:03:28] his church
[1:03:32] he said when
[1:03:33] russell said the line anointing was
[1:03:36] infinite justice
[1:03:37] and he said god forsook his church or
[1:03:39] the lying beast was defeated by the
[1:03:41] ecclesiastical system look at that see
[1:03:43] what was he doing brother he was
[1:03:44] exalting himself as look i'm i've got
[1:03:46] the greatest anointing i'm finishing the
[1:03:48] mystery of god
[1:03:49] charles russell was exalting himself
[1:03:51] greater than all those early apostles
[1:03:53] because he said they failed
[1:03:55] and he actually said god failed i'll
[1:03:56] show you the quote god forsook his
[1:03:58] church jesus said jesus said god forsook
[1:04:01] me so you don't have to be forsaken amen
[1:04:04] hebrews 13 verse 5 said god cannot leave
[1:04:07] us nor forsake us hallelujah but yet
[1:04:10] this guy says god forsook the early
[1:04:12] church
[1:04:13] impossible
[1:04:15] see that's why don't these people these
[1:04:17] accusers don't they keep reading
[1:04:19] are they just trying to find one little
[1:04:21] thing against brother brahm to make him
[1:04:22] look bad
[1:04:23] that's what they're doing
[1:04:25] here it is
[1:04:26] thus we he said he went forth conquering
[1:04:28] in the conqueror that's the first seal
[1:04:30] thus we see the apparent defeat of
[1:04:31] infinite justice in this first epic
[1:04:34] apparently god forsook his church having
[1:04:36] jeopardized all its interest by placing
[1:04:38] the power in the hands of the
[1:04:40] self-seeking ecclesiastical system but
[1:04:42] worse things are coming look at that
[1:04:43] brother can you believe that
[1:04:44] what man in his right mind what man led
[1:04:46] of the holy spirit would say god's word
[1:04:49] failed
[1:04:50] what man led by the holy spirit would
[1:04:52] say god forsook his church
[1:04:54] god can never forsake his church amen
[1:04:57] god can never forsake you god can never
[1:04:59] forget about you the bible said god
[1:05:01] can't even forget about israel because
[1:05:03] he's engraved in the palms of his hands
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:08] the bible said jesus was crucified for
[1:05:10] the joy that was set before him and what
[1:05:12] joy was that the joy of your love amen
[1:05:15] the joy of your worship praise god he
[1:05:17] shall see his seed isaiah 53 says you
[1:05:20] are the seed of god the bible says
[1:05:21] you're born again of the incorruptible
[1:05:23] seed the word of god
[1:05:26] oh my
[1:05:27] hallelujah
[1:05:32] thank god hallelujah
[1:05:35] and they call me a heretic
[1:05:37] and they say i'm not a good researcher
[1:05:39] we're not we don't know how to research
[1:05:41] well here's the research
[1:05:45] either me or i'm asking you guys can you
[1:05:47] go on that
[1:05:48] that video of theirs and leave a comment
[1:05:50] say this is you need to look at brother
[1:05:51] jesse's research on this so
[1:05:54] anyway if any of you want to help me out
[1:05:55] today you can do that
[1:05:58] i'll bring some real trials on me too so
[1:06:02] okay here's uh uriah smith
[1:06:04] i like that name smith that's pretty
[1:06:05] good news
[1:06:08] now his book was called daniel and the
[1:06:11] revelations that's like a acronym daniel
[1:06:13] in the revelation his was before both of
[1:06:15] them before larkin and uh russell
[1:06:18] now this guy would eventually become the
[1:06:20] leader of the seventh day in venice they
[1:06:21] believe he got a worship on saturday
[1:06:23] they have some things that are right but
[1:06:24] they have some false prophets like ellen
[1:06:26] white and some different other false
[1:06:27] prophets
[1:06:29] they actually follow a woman prophet
[1:06:30] like her teachings they really major on
[1:06:33] ellen white's prophecies
[1:06:35] okay so when did he say did brother man
[1:06:37] plagiarized from uriah smith
[1:06:40] brother admits on tape he read uriah
[1:06:42] smith
[1:06:44] but he said when the holy spirit came in
[1:06:46] it was totally different
[1:06:48] hallelujah so he said the god the timing
[1:06:51] of the first church age or the first
[1:06:53] seal was the gospel in the first century
[1:06:57] he said the identity of the writer was
[1:06:58] the earliest ministers of the gospel
[1:07:00] look at that
[1:07:02] in other words the white horse rider was
[1:07:04] the ministers and the holy spirit riding
[1:07:07] conquering the world for christ
[1:07:09] that's totally opposite of what brother
[1:07:11] ram said
[1:07:13] totally opposite
[1:07:14] and they say brother man plagiarize him
[1:07:17] it's polar opposites
[1:07:19] and there's uh so here what's the
[1:07:20] difference brother branham's first seal
[1:07:22] started the same as uriah's but brother
[1:07:24] rams lasted much longer
[1:07:27] he said it was only for the first
[1:07:28] century so 30 a.d to 100 a.d brother
[1:07:31] rams laughter lasted around 385 around
[1:07:33] 385 when the church and state had power
[1:07:35] to kill
[1:07:36] and brother said the writer was a spirit
[1:07:38] and then became a pope larkin said the
[1:07:39] writer is a literal person or man of the
[1:07:41] antichrist during the great tribulation
[1:07:43] period
[1:07:45] here's the quote this is right from his
[1:07:46] book you can get it online you can
[1:07:48] download it online
[1:07:49] let me skip ahead here
[1:07:52] yeah
[1:07:53] he said he goes forth concreting the
[1:07:55] conqueror is a fit emblem of the
[1:07:56] triumphs of the gospel in the first
[1:07:58] century of this
[1:08:00] dispensation he said oh the white horse
[1:08:02] rider is the gospel conquering and
[1:08:04] brother branham said it's actually satan
[1:08:06] conquered
[1:08:07] totally
[1:08:08] opposite completely opposite so
[1:08:11] plagiarize no
[1:08:16] yeah he said it was the zeal and the
[1:08:17] success with which the truth was
[1:08:19] promulgated by its earliest minister so
[1:08:21] the white the writer actually represents
[1:08:23] all the ministers of the first century
[1:08:25] program said no it was the antichrist
[1:08:26] spirit
[1:08:28] the nicolaitan spirit
[1:08:31] all right
[1:08:32] now let me uh
[1:08:34] try to close here by god's grace
[1:08:39] now church there's been numerous people
[1:08:41] you know uh in the message
[1:08:43] you can you could know the symbols you
[1:08:44] can know all these symbols of the seven
[1:08:46] seals but miss a relate a relationship
[1:08:49] with jesus christ
[1:08:50] but don't forget this jesus christ gave
[1:08:52] us these symbols to know
[1:08:55] and the church said
[1:08:57] jesus christ gave brother ram these
[1:08:59] symbols and told the revelation so that
[1:09:01] what we could withstand the antichrist
[1:09:04] spirit that's why we're given these
[1:09:06] revelations
[1:09:08] so we can know them through personal
[1:09:10] revelation
[1:09:11] and the experience of meeting jesus
[1:09:13] because the bible said the mystery of
[1:09:15] god must be finished someone has to come
[1:09:17] sometime that's why i told sam at my
[1:09:19] house i said brother i said the bible
[1:09:20] says the mystery god's got to be
[1:09:22] finished i held up my book i said
[1:09:23] there's 12 that are finished six of them
[1:09:25] have thus saith the lord
[1:09:27] to see you can tell somebody right to
[1:09:29] their face and either they're hungry for
[1:09:30] or not
[1:09:32] see the seed will fall on one type of
[1:09:34] four grounds
[1:09:36] what was the difference were you what
[1:09:37] was the difference for you you were
[1:09:39] hungry for the word of god it fell on
[1:09:41] good ground
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:43] hallelujah it fell on good ground you
[1:09:46] started watering that ground you started
[1:09:47] watering that seed and pretty soon good
[1:09:49] for good fruits come forth hallelujah
[1:09:51] from that seed
[1:09:52] amen but don't forget this this is what
[1:09:54] we've seen the message here people can
[1:09:56] understand all these mysteries of the
[1:09:57] seven seals but if they don't have love
[1:10:00] they're nothing
[1:10:02] love for what the entire word of god
[1:10:06] the gospel of jesus christ
[1:10:10] let me skip ahead to this i got a lot of
[1:10:12] thoughts i never got to
[1:10:18] so i've just showed you he brother did
[1:10:19] not plagiarize russell larkin or uriah
[1:10:22] smith
[1:10:23] and look what he said
[1:10:26] he says this is the first seal he's
[1:10:27] getting ready to preach he said he's got
[1:10:29] it he said christ has a book in his hand
[1:10:31] he's starting to reveal it and oh i
[1:10:33] would have absolutely today i hope that
[1:10:34] people are spiritual i would have made
[1:10:36] him a horrible mistake on that if it
[1:10:38] hadn't been about 12 o'clock in the day
[1:10:39] and look at it it's 1205 right now glory
[1:10:43] when the holy spirit came in the room
[1:10:45] and corrected me on something i was
[1:10:47] writing down to say
[1:10:49] brother iran was going to miss the
[1:10:50] revelation of the first seal but the
[1:10:52] holy ghost that glory the holy ghost
[1:10:54] that met him out in arizona amen with
[1:10:56] seven angels sent them back and said you
[1:10:58] go back i'll be with you to open the
[1:11:01] seven seals to reveal them to my bride
[1:11:03] i'm finishing the mystery of god this is
[1:11:05] the time and season this is the place
[1:11:06] this is the saint the lord
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:10] and to keep someone from a mistake
[1:11:12] and to keep his profit from a mistake
[1:11:14] the holy spirit came in and swept the
[1:11:15] room and showed him a vision
[1:11:17] and you can go through all we'll go
[1:11:18] through these maybe later but you can go
[1:11:20] through all
[1:11:23] yeah he says this later
[1:11:25] he says about 12 o'clock in the day the
[1:11:27] holy spirit swept through the room the
[1:11:28] whole thing just opened up of this first
[1:11:30] seal being opened
[1:11:35] now for the second seal he said the
[1:11:36] first thing you know something happens
[1:11:38] it's all together different then i grab
[1:11:40] me a pencil real quick and start writing
[1:11:41] down just as fast i can while he's there
[1:11:44] so brother man would be studying and the
[1:11:45] holy ghost would sweep in the room he
[1:11:48] would see a vision and then try to write
[1:11:50] down what he sees
[1:11:51] sound familiar sound like john the book
[1:11:54] of revelation
[1:11:55] because jesus christ is the same
[1:11:56] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:59] and he did not plagiarize uriah he did
[1:12:02] not plagiarize larkin or russell
[1:12:04] can i say this he got it from god
[1:12:06] hallelujah he was sharing the revelation
[1:12:09] that jesus christ gave to him hallelujah
[1:12:12] in the third seal he said
[1:12:15] uh
[1:12:16] the holy spirit came to where i was and
[1:12:18] this other seal opened up just exactly
[1:12:21] i love this as soon as the brotherham
[1:12:22] saw it vision what'd he do he said i
[1:12:24] went quickly to the scripture
[1:12:27] it was revealed to me early in the
[1:12:28] morning before daylight then i went
[1:12:29] quickly to the scripture and began to
[1:12:31] look to search it up
[1:12:35] he said the fourth seal finally did come
[1:12:37] he said i took my bible he said so help
[1:12:39] me i never know before none of these
[1:12:41] things have ever known before i got up
[1:12:43] there and take the bible sit down there
[1:12:44] when it goes to breaking forth like that
[1:12:46] i stick i just pick up my pen and start
[1:12:48] writing and stay there maybe for hours
[1:12:50] until it gets finished
[1:12:52] so the holy spirit would come in and
[1:12:53] brother man would write down all the
[1:12:55] things in the vision about the white
[1:12:56] horse rider the red horse writer the
[1:12:58] black horse rider the pale horse writer
[1:13:00] he write it down while he's there and
[1:13:01] then he said i spend the rest of the day
[1:13:03] searching the bible to make sure the
[1:13:05] revelation is right because paul said
[1:13:07] even if we or an angel preached anything
[1:13:10] different than what we've already
[1:13:11] received let him be a curse amen
[1:13:14] it's the gospel of jesus christ
[1:13:16] let's stand to our feet
[1:13:20] hallelujah
[1:13:22] church i'm convinced now more than ever
[1:13:24] that jesus christ visited brother
[1:13:26] branham and brother brahm was god's
[1:13:27] prophet
[1:13:30] see all these lies and attacks they
[1:13:31] always bring out the truth
[1:13:34] brother brown said heresies i'm sorry
[1:13:36] paul said heresies must come in to
[1:13:37] approve the true ministers of god
[1:13:40] that's why these lies come in that's why
[1:13:42] heretics come in that's why false
[1:13:43] accusers come in because it shows who's
[1:13:45] the real believer and who is it
[1:13:48] musicians can come brother amen you got
[1:13:50] are you led for a song
[1:14:00] praise god i know i did a lot of
[1:14:02] teaching today but i did some preaching
[1:14:03] in there too by god's grace
[1:14:05] first we must have a experience we must
[1:14:07] have a personal experience with jesus
[1:14:09] christ
[1:14:10] some of these men that left they knew
[1:14:11] these revelations for years or maybe
[1:14:13] they didn't know it i don't know what
[1:14:14] something happened to them
[1:14:16] they thought they knew it
[1:14:19] can't say can i say like this they were
[1:14:20] listening to the tapes but they weren't
[1:14:22] hearing what the spirit said
[1:14:24] it's two different things
