[2:33] Christ's name amen
[2:35] amen praise God let's take our Bibles
[2:37] here this morning
[2:38] I'd like to go to the Book of Esther
[2:39] it's been a while since I preached on
[2:40] Esther so I kind of wanted to revisit
[2:42] that
[2:43] I heard A good sermon on it uh last or
[2:46] this month earlier this month and then I
[2:48] got a text from Zur about Esther so I
[2:50] thought well that's pretty uh pretty
[2:51] interesting you know you look for
[2:53] Witnesses in your life you know and so
[2:55] I've been studying on this a little bit
[2:56] and I trust the Lord will
[2:59] speak to us here today by God's grace I
[3:01] just want to show there's there seems to
[3:02] be three different uh types with
[3:05] Esther's life here so we'll look at
[3:07] those three today
[3:10] and I'm probably gonna use the mic is
[3:11] that okay occasions that every everybody
[3:14] can hear me better if I use the mind
[3:15] okay and I want the live streamers to be
[3:17] able to hear so God bless the live
[3:18] streamers hopefully brother bang sister
[3:20] see you God bless you we pray for you
[3:22] and brother Jose God bless you love you
[3:24] brother look forward to seeing you
[3:25] sometime soon here by God's grace
[3:28] Esther chapter 2
[3:31] I'm not going to have any slides today
[3:33] because there are so many different
[3:34] thoughts that I had to write down that I
[3:36] just didn't have time for
[3:38] actually maybe I'll have just a couple
[3:39] slides in just a moment but let's read
[3:41] our text here so we could
[3:45] see what the Lord would speak to us here
[3:49] we're sorry about that pardon me
[3:52] I thought I'd turn that off
[3:55] Esther chapter 2 verse 15 Esther 2 15.
[4:00] of course this is the moment Esther is
[4:02] brought into the king
[4:06] and just a beautiful type here of the
[4:08] bride and Christ Hallelujah
[4:14] I'll read 15 and 16 and then we can all
[4:16] read 17 about the grace of God now when
[4:20] the turn of Esther the daughter of
[4:22] abahale the uncle Mordecai who had taken
[4:25] her for his daughter was come to go in
[4:27] unto the king she required nothing but
[4:29] what haggai the king's Chamberlain The
[4:32] Keeper of the women appointed and Esther
[4:34] obtained favor in the sight of all them
[4:36] that looked upon her so Esther was taken
[4:39] unto King ahaziwaris into his house
[4:42] Royal in the 10th month which is the
[4:45] month of Tibet in the seventh year of
[4:48] his reign
[4:49] so let's read verse 17 ready one two
[4:51] three and the King love Esther above all
[4:55] the women and she obtained grace and
[4:58] favor in his sight more than all the
[5:01] virgins so that he set the Royal Crown
[5:04] upon her head and made her Queen instead
[5:07] of ashtime Amen may God has blessings
[5:09] his reading of his word you may be
[5:11] seated
[5:12] see I do have a few slides here just to
[5:15] show a couple things
[5:21] so I would like to look at Esther types
[5:24] of the Gentile bride and the squeeze
[5:26] before the rapture
[5:28] um
[5:29] I just thought you know I saw this this
[5:30] week I thought I would update the church
[5:32] a little bit you know from time to time
[5:33] we talk about end time events and this
[5:35] looked like another sign of The Binding
[5:37] of the tares we know it's been going on
[5:40] of course whether Ram saw the world
[5:41] economical Council the war council of
[5:43] churches you know he saw Pentecost who's
[5:46] uniting with them when he was alive he
[5:48] talked about that he warned demon
[5:50] shakarian
[5:53] was a prominent leader of the
[5:55] Pentecostals he was United with the
[5:57] Roman Catholics in his day brother man
[5:59] worn them on tape called his name and
[6:01] then he apologized for calling his name
[6:04] the next service
[6:05] but he kept warning the people after
[6:07] that don't yoke up with denominations
[6:10] and of course we saw I think back in
[6:12] 2015 right when Tony Palmer was a
[6:16] Catholic priest I think of a charismatic
[6:19] Catholic church and then he helped unite
[6:21] Kenneth Hagin who was the successor of
[6:24] Oral Roberts he helped unite them to the
[6:27] pope and then uh brother Stewart Tony
[6:30] Stewart died in a motorcycle accident
[6:33] just months after that he was hit
[6:35] head-on and he
[6:38] Tony claimed to be Elijah
[6:41] and so I've always thought I just said
[6:42] well that seems to be like a warning
[6:43] from God he claimed to be coming in
[6:46] Elijah uniting the the Protestant
[6:48] Catholic but God had already sent Elijah
[6:50] through brother Branham to warn us not
[6:53] to unite with Catholicism
[6:55] so that was just you know what eight
[6:57] years ago
[6:58] but I saw this week I was a you know I
[7:01] always listen to sermons and I heard a
[7:03] sermon from a Ministry called the good
[7:04] fight Ministry which I liked they do a
[7:07] lot of updates with culture
[7:09] they did the video they sold their souls
[7:11] for rock and roll I don't know if you've
[7:12] seen that but that was quite a video
[7:14] so anyways uh the uh a man named Bill
[7:18] Johnson he runs a Bethel Church which is
[7:20] a heretical church it's a it's like a
[7:23] Pentecostal church but I believe they
[7:25] actually impart demons into people I
[7:28] believe I can prove that you know if I
[7:29] showed you the video you'd see it and of
[7:31] course they're Doctrine
[7:33] they pray for people until like they do
[7:35] all kinds of flipping and flopping and
[7:37] uh they speak all this all these things
[7:39] and I believe it's actually human
[7:41] possession that that's I believe that's
[7:43] provable
[7:44] because they're so off the word of God
[7:46] anyways he's a very prominent uh a
[7:49] preacher
[7:51] his wife is the one that would lay she
[7:53] died of cancer this year but she was one
[7:55] that would lay on Graves and try to soak
[7:57] in people's anointings that's that's one
[7:59] example of how we know their demon
[8:01] possessed you don't get anointings by
[8:03] laying on people's Graves that's demonic
[8:07] anyways he put out this post uh for
[8:09] Catholics and Protestants to come
[8:11] together on August 4th in Portugal it's
[8:13] a million dollar event they've raised
[8:15] almost a million dollars to have this
[8:17] and the whole point is uh well there's a
[8:21] scripture the scripture says Jesus says
[8:23] Gather ye together at first that tears
[8:25] and bind them in bundles before the we
[8:27] is gathered
[8:28] so we have to see The ecumenical move
[8:30] unite first before the rapture
[8:34] and of course we know they will brother
[8:35] Branham said
[8:36] um
[8:37] the church is in America will Unite with
[8:39] American politicians to change the laws
[8:42] in order to kill Christians that's the
[8:44] simplest way to say it I believe that'll
[8:45] be the sign the squeeze is on when the
[8:47] United States the Beast of the land gets
[8:50] the power to kill Christians but we
[8:52] don't know when that will be we see we
[8:55] see birth pains right we see coven where
[8:57] they almost mandated vaccines you know
[8:59] now they're going after Trump he's just
[9:02] a conservative but they're trying to
[9:03] arrest him
[9:04] so we can see the process right
[9:07] mandates and arresting anyone who stands
[9:10] against the policies of the government
[9:12] so we can see it getting closer and
[9:13] closer
[9:15] um
[9:16] but Jesus said they must be bound first
[9:18] and it's a possible I just you know when
[9:21] whenever they have an event like this
[9:22] and music is involved it's a possible
[9:25] type of Daniel 3 15 right with Shadrach
[9:27] Meshach and Abednego you know that story
[9:30] is a type as well
[9:32] right where all the Believers are I'm
[9:34] sorry everyone had to bow down to the
[9:36] one image now that's very similar to the
[9:39] image of the Beast which is the Pope
[9:41] right there's one image everyone has to
[9:43] bow down to or they die that's the Pope
[9:46] and brother random of course use that
[9:48] example the program thought that image
[9:50] might be uh
[9:51] might have been Daniel well it could
[9:53] have been but we're not told in the
[9:55] scripture
[9:56] um and then that's an interesting type
[9:58] you know uh some people say brother
[10:00] Branham is that image and everyone has
[10:01] to bow down to brother random and that I
[10:04] don't know it could be I I personally
[10:05] believe though the image is the pope
[10:06] that's personally my opinion I could be
[10:08] wrong
[10:09] but the uh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[10:12] they all had to bow down
[10:14] when the music was playing so I just
[10:16] think it's interesting you know that
[10:18] this is what it says it says join join
[10:20] us for this transformative worship and
[10:23] evangelization event where Catholics and
[10:25] Protestants together will unite the
[10:28] flame of Faith unite the body of Christ
[10:30] and bring the message of the Gospel to
[10:32] every person don't miss this opportunity
[10:34] to be a part of the change
[10:37] and then they have a list of speakers
[10:39] down there I didn't zoom in I'm not real
[10:42] familiar with any of them other than
[10:44] Heidi Baker she's the one that preaches
[10:46] at Bethel she has her own Ministry but
[10:48] she preaches at Bethel and she prays for
[10:49] people and they get this
[10:52] this uh painful anointing on them
[10:55] and I believe it's a demonic anointing
[10:58] because of the way they they act and we
[11:00] oh yeah the man from Jesus from the
[11:02] chosen is in there Jesus from the chosen
[11:03] that Catholic guy who I never watched
[11:05] chosen but he's a speaker there
[11:08] so just interesting you know as we uh as
[11:11] we get closer we're going to see more of
[11:12] this likely more and more uh the people
[11:14] coming together
[11:16] Matt Mayer we saw him at the concert at
[11:19] mayor
[11:20] so he wasn't singing about Mary so
[11:21] that's okay with me
[11:24] but uh
[11:26] you know they're they're trying to unite
[11:28] together uh and of course we know Church
[11:30] they're not a part of the body of Christ
[11:32] until they're born again right
[11:34] or if you're predestinated to eternal
[11:37] life then you're part of the body of
[11:38] Christ but
[11:39] um Catholics who deny the word of God or
[11:41] deny the baptism Holy Ghost we know any
[11:43] Catholic would not be born again because
[11:45] they're staying in denomination and the
[11:47] Holy Ghost is saying come out of her my
[11:49] people
[11:50] so we believe it's impossible for anyone
[11:52] in a Catholic church or Baptist to be
[11:54] born again I believe it's impossible
[11:56] because the Bible says come out of her
[11:58] right yeah and all the children of God
[12:00] all the elect of God will come out of
[12:01] organization but there could be people
[12:03] in there that would be saved
[12:05] um and just you know another man uh I
[12:07] can't think of his name now but he was a
[12:09] prominent he's a friend of Bill Johnson
[12:12] Louis Engel Louis angle I think that's
[12:14] his name
[12:15] a couple years ago they had another
[12:17] meeting like this with Catholics and the
[12:19] Protestant preachers bowed down and kiss
[12:21] the feet of the Catholic priests I've
[12:23] got the video I could show it to you so
[12:25] I'm just letting you know this that's
[12:27] worship
[12:28] that's man-made worship they were
[12:29] apologizing yeah the Protestant
[12:31] preachers were apologizing for blasting
[12:33] the Catholics and so he actually got
[12:35] down on his face and kissed the feet of
[12:37] those Catholics and so that's absolute
[12:40] worship that's heresy that's sinful and
[12:44] I'm just just a reminder just was a
[12:45] reminder to me this week
[12:47] um that The Binding of the tares has to
[12:49] happen first I know Simon preached that
[12:51] a few weeks ago I preached that years
[12:52] and years ago because I've been a pastor
[12:54] all these years
[12:55] um but just an interesting
[12:57] um sign about how this is getting closer
[13:00] all the time
[13:02] and also you know before I read this
[13:03] quote from about the seven Thunders
[13:06] there was a uh an article I I read a
[13:09] couple weeks ago I saved it for a while
[13:10] it was on Newsmax and uh it said the
[13:13] Catholic church is doing studies to see
[13:16] whether they could include
[13:18] lgbqt whatever all that include them
[13:20] into the ministry and they also want to
[13:23] include women becoming priests and so I
[13:26] just thought it was another sign you
[13:28] know we're wondering is the Catholic
[13:30] Church going to unite with all the
[13:31] homosexual agenda
[13:33] I don't know it would seem like they
[13:36] would have to if they're going to
[13:37] convince the whole world to follow the
[13:39] pope that's what it would seem like to
[13:40] me
[13:41] but also Jesus said it's got to be so
[13:43] close it might deceive the very elective
[13:44] or possible how close would that be so
[13:47] we don't know but just I'm just giving
[13:48] you a couple of those are two updates
[13:50] right just two recent news events on
[13:54] Prophecy like brother random preach
[13:55] modern events made clear by prophecy
[13:57] right
[13:58] so we can see those now last week for
[14:00] some reason I forgot to read this quote
[14:01] so I'm sorry I preached on the uh just
[14:03] revisiting the seven Thunders last week
[14:05] because we had two questions in the
[14:06] church about it and uh
[14:08] the sermon is now online yeah I think
[14:10] this term is now on YouTube but they
[14:12] asked brother Branham you know about a
[14:13] year and a half before he died
[14:15] uh someone said brother brown with your
[14:17] experience the Lord has given you for
[14:18] his people
[14:19] would you be eligible to write a Bible
[14:21] yourself if God manifests it I said well
[14:24] that might be true but see he was trying
[14:26] to catch me
[14:27] so the devil anointed some man to try to
[14:30] say brother do you want to write your
[14:31] own Bible now that's what the Mormons
[14:33] have done
[14:33] that's what the Jehovah's Witness had
[14:35] done they've taken and that's what
[14:36] really every other Bible translation has
[14:38] done it's a different Bible because they
[14:40] have different Scrolls
[14:42] I don't go too hard on that but uh
[14:45] it's the truth
[14:47] and uh
[14:49] I'm not like a King James only I'm gonna
[14:51] rebuke you if you're not King James only
[14:53] I'm not like that but uh it's the facts
[14:56] you know every other Bible translation
[14:58] uses different Scrolls and so they get a
[15:00] different translation it's always a
[15:01] shorter translation they're always
[15:03] taking out of the word of God
[15:05] is always shorter because they have to
[15:07] have a copyright they've got to have a
[15:08] different certain percentage to make a
[15:10] copyright
[15:12] but look it's it's the enemy trying to
[15:14] tempt brother Brandon write your own
[15:15] Bible
[15:16] write your own Bible
[15:17] and I said but you see I couldn't do
[15:19] that he said why couldn't you you have
[15:21] all the qualifications you have signs
[15:23] wonders Miracles you speak in the name
[15:24] of the Lord you prophesy but look one
[15:27] word cannot be added or taken away
[15:30] I love these stories where they
[15:32] challenge brother Branham but brother
[15:33] Adam always goes back to the word of God
[15:35] Amen 11.
[15:37] he said well then them seven Thunders
[15:39] you see winning them seven Thunders
[15:40] blasting about won't the won't that be a
[15:42] revelation be give to some man this is
[15:45] why I believe that seven Thunders are
[15:47] already revealed
[15:49] I said no sir it would be adding
[15:51] something to it or taking something from
[15:54] it it's all revealed in there and the
[15:57] Seven Seals opened up the revelation of
[15:59] what that was
[16:00] so this quote goes along with the
[16:02] questions and answers quote uh from
[16:05] August of 64 where brother random said
[16:07] the seven Thunders were already revealed
[16:09] in the Seven Seals
[16:10] okay he said that's what it was see it's
[16:13] still in the word you see you can't get
[16:15] out of that word it won't leave that
[16:16] word and God's spirit will never leave
[16:18] that word it'll stay right with the word
[16:20] blinding some and Open the Eyes of
[16:22] others it'll always do that
[16:25] so that's one I'm sorry I left that out
[16:27] for some reason I forgot to leave that
[16:28] out I was listening to a sermon this
[16:29] week and uh the brother Danny steaman
[16:32] from Florida and he mentioned that quote
[16:34] okay so I'm going to detach there just
[16:35] because I don't have all my thoughts
[16:36] organized I kind of need them open on a
[16:38] couple different screens here
[16:40] by God's grace
[16:43] okay so let's preach a little bit here
[16:44] on Esther
[16:46] um and I look at the types of the bride
[16:48] and The Squeeze
[16:50] by God's grace
[16:54] so I was listening to a sermon from July
[16:57] from brother Donnie Reagan's church and
[16:59] the brother preached on Esther it was a
[17:01] tremendous service it was a really
[17:02] anointed service I really enjoyed it I
[17:04] was listening to it while I was moaning
[17:05] and I got a text from Sir about Esther
[17:07] and I started studying again I'm like
[17:09] well I'd like to preach that again so we
[17:11] like to do that today that's kind of
[17:13] like the background of it that sermon
[17:15] that I heard was from July 2nd and the
[17:17] brother had a lot of good points now the
[17:19] reason I want to preach it just because
[17:20] he had he he taught it he preached it in
[17:23] a different way I'd never seen him
[17:24] before and so I want to explain his way
[17:27] and then away brother Branham typed it
[17:29] and then the way that I would uh that I
[17:32] I preached as well by God's grace so
[17:34] maybe have your Bible handy and we'll
[17:35] read through Esther uh just we'll hit a
[17:38] few highlights from the book
[17:40] by the grace of the Lord
[17:43] okay so for the first type this is a
[17:46] brother random quote brother random said
[17:47] you are like Esther
[17:49] and vashti is a person that's ashamed of
[17:52] Jesus and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:56] so this is a different quote or this is
[17:58] a different type because you alone are
[18:00] Esther you're the one who goes in there
[18:02] not the whole bride of Christ but just
[18:04] the individual
[18:05] okay which that you you could use that
[18:08] right because we know the Bible says we
[18:10] should be married to the Lord Jesus
[18:11] Christ in Romans chapter 7. so brother
[18:14] Ram says this in Phoenix 1962. now we
[18:16] find out she vashti now if Ashley means
[18:19] beautiful right so let's keep that in
[18:20] mind she's a beautiful woman
[18:22] right and uhuris or Xerxes wanted to
[18:26] show her beauty to all the men that were
[18:28] part of his his Feast she was beautiful
[18:32] but beauty without character is Satan
[18:35] hallelujah amen so no matter how
[18:37] beautiful or how handsome or how strong
[18:39] you know you can be or how whatever we
[18:42] can accomplish physically that means
[18:43] nothing what God wants is obedience to
[18:46] the word of God Amen right we found out
[18:48] vashi commits spiritual fornication
[18:50] going out with the world professing
[18:52] something living something different
[18:53] that won't never work what the church
[18:55] ought to do is like Esther did Esther
[18:58] refused the adorning of the world
[19:01] he says now we know that little Book of
[19:02] Esther how that Mordecai his uncle had a
[19:04] daughter and he was and he was down
[19:06] during the times of the Reigns and the
[19:08] medes and Persians there's a very
[19:09] beautiful type there the king one of the
[19:11] greatest kings in the world that day he
[19:12] had a a great feast and he called the
[19:14] queen to come set by him and she didn't
[19:16] want to do it she refused to do it so
[19:18] what did he do he was so humiliated
[19:20] didn't know what to do that his own wife
[19:22] wouldn't come
[19:25] okay so think about that uh it's a it's
[19:27] humiliating to Jesus
[19:29] right it's humiliated to Jesus the Bible
[19:32] also says in Psalm chapter 2 kiss the
[19:34] sun lest ye be angry
[19:36] so it makes the Lord angry in other
[19:38] words the wrath of God comes on people
[19:39] that won't worship God the way he wants
[19:42] to be worshiped
[19:44] that includes shouting right crying
[19:46] weeping rejoicing signing and crying for
[19:48] the Abominations speaking in tongues
[19:50] prophesying Hallelujah in other words
[19:52] you giving all your emotions to God
[19:55] anyone that won't worship God that way
[19:57] the Pentecostal way it angers God
[20:00] it upsets God
[20:02] said I think that's a whole lot like
[20:04] Christ today
[20:06] Christ has invited us a set in Heavenly
[20:08] places with him he said and we're
[20:11] ashamed to do it now not us but the
[20:13] denominations right we're not ashamed we
[20:15] love the prince of God Amen he said many
[20:17] people are ashamed to say that they got
[20:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:21] Pentecostal people that's right they're
[20:23] ashamed to say it he said we're ashamed
[20:25] of him not speaking of Pentecostal not
[20:27] brother Branham
[20:28] okay so it means a lot church for us to
[20:31] be able to uh to enjoy the prince of God
[20:34] it really is a blessing church when you
[20:36] can be free in the holy spirit amen
[20:38] right it really is something when you
[20:40] can raise your hands and when you can
[20:42] shout or when you can praise God or you
[20:44] can scream or you can dance around the
[20:46] church amen
[20:47] it really is a victory praise God
[20:50] because that's what Jesus wants Jesus
[20:52] wants you know all your love right amen
[20:54] he wants you fully surrendered to him
[20:56] and as I said before if you can't uh
[20:58] surrender your wallet to God how's he
[21:00] going to get into your soul how are you
[21:01] going to surrender your soul that's
[21:02] right if you want to surrender and Let
[21:04] Jesus into your your bedroom and and uh
[21:06] you know keep keep your your life clean
[21:08] in your bedroom
[21:09] you know how how is he going to get into
[21:11] your soul if you can't get into your
[21:12] bedroom
[21:13] if you can't get into you using a cell
[21:15] phone how's he going to get into your
[21:16] soul
[21:17] right if you can't get into my preaching
[21:20] I'm bringing me in this now if he can't
[21:22] get in my preaching how's he going to
[21:23] get into my soul
[21:25] but I know he's in my preaching amen
[21:26] because he proves it over and over again
[21:28] it just as an example uh uh Thursday we
[21:31] went to the Amish community or the
[21:33] former Honors Community The Junction
[21:34] City Saints it's gonna take me a while
[21:35] to get over that
[21:38] um and I preach on the anointed ones at
[21:39] the end time we had a great time now Kai
[21:40] went with him he had a wonderful time in
[21:41] the Lord
[21:44] um and one of the sisters named Ruth
[21:45] came up and she said brother Jesse I
[21:46] just want to tell you I was wondering
[21:48] about that all day about the anointed
[21:49] ones the end times and how can people
[21:51] get the anointing and she said you came
[21:53] and preached exactly what I was
[21:54] wondering about amen and the elder
[21:56] brother Irvin got up there and said he
[21:58] said I almost thought about uh asking
[22:00] Jesse to preach on a certain topic but I
[22:02] said no I'll let the Holy Ghost preach
[22:04] I'll let the Holy Ghost decide what we
[22:06] have needed amen amen and he said to
[22:08] answer all of our questions and helped
[22:09] us so much so I just thought that was
[22:11] another good example of how I want to
[22:13] yield my gift to Christ we all want to
[22:14] yield Our Lives to Christ amen praise
[22:17] God that's we had a great time in the
[22:18] Lord there uh and Lord willing that
[22:21] tonight I'll teach on can Satan heal and
[22:23] of course the answer is no but I ended
[22:25] the sermon with that on Thursday night
[22:26] so I'll teach the little ones that if
[22:28] they want to sit up front and we can do
[22:29] it like that again
[22:31] or if you all want me to preach you can
[22:33] all have you preach if you want
[22:37] I know they like to sit up front by
[22:38] God's grace
[22:40] but uh that's the first type so that's
[22:42] the interesting type I actually never
[22:43] saw that until yesterday only said
[22:46] Esther 15 times so he didn't use it a
[22:48] whole lot and most of the times we're in
[22:50] that sermon uh the marriage supper the
[22:52] lamb from 1962.
[22:55] okay now the second type was this was
[22:57] the new one I'd never heard before
[22:58] either and this is the one the brother
[23:00] preached from earlier this month
[23:02] wonderful brother like I said it was a
[23:04] tremendous sermon but there's a few few
[23:06] things I didn't agree and church as we
[23:09] go on there's types in this story that
[23:11] they they don't make sense yeah Yeah
[23:13] okay or they're not in the right order
[23:16] okay
[23:18] um so we got to just keep that in mind
[23:19] and and again it's always they're just
[23:22] types and shadows they're not a perfect
[23:24] realization
[23:26] as we'll see you know some of these
[23:27] things are a little out of order or not
[23:29] quite sure who more for me I'm not sure
[23:30] who Mordecai represents or Hagee eye or
[23:32] I'm not quite sure how this uh works out
[23:35] but we can definitely see numerous types
[23:38] in there
[23:39] okay so the brother uh earlier this
[23:41] month preached and his type was the New
[23:44] Testament bride just of laodicea so from
[23:46] Brother branham's day on to us so from
[23:49] Brother man's day to us we are the Bride
[23:51] of Esther
[23:53] so that means none of the other six
[23:54] Church Ages were Esther
[23:56] now that's interesting I don't agree
[23:58] with that but it's just interesting I
[23:59] never thought of that before
[24:01] um and uh vashti then would be the
[24:04] denominations of the legacian church age
[24:06] who wouldn't move on with Christ
[24:09] now they do have a quote for this
[24:11] uh this is marriage and divorce uh 1965.
[24:16] this is the first sermon I let Kristen
[24:17] listen to
[24:19] I don't advise you if you're witnessing
[24:20] to
[24:21] share that to be the first sermon for
[24:24] somebody
[24:26] it shows God's grace is with me that's
[24:28] all I can say
[24:30] and I guess you know I guess I shared
[24:32] with her because we were one to be
[24:33] married and I wanted her to see uh the
[24:36] true revelation of it but there's a lot
[24:38] of hard statements in there
[24:39] and some of them I just I honestly think
[24:41] brother random just misworded there are
[24:43] a few things he said like he said uh
[24:46] brother man said Satan was Eve's
[24:48] designer well some people take that well
[24:51] how could Satan create E's physical body
[24:53] well that's not what program was meant
[24:55] he meant Satan was influencing Eve's
[24:58] mind
[25:00] right to disbelieve God's word but Satan
[25:03] didn't design Eve God designed
[25:06] right in her body and everything like
[25:07] that
[25:08] so you have to rightly divide everything
[25:11] or else you're going to end up with some
[25:12] evil spirits right people the devil will
[25:15] take a thought of brother Brown that was
[25:16] just his own idea or he missed said
[25:18] something and the devil will take that
[25:19] and run with that yeah so we have to be
[25:21] very careful to rightly divide the word
[25:23] of Truth
[25:24] I love that sermon though it's a
[25:25] beautiful sermon but again maybe not the
[25:27] best thing to send to somebody or their
[25:29] first time here brother randbridge or I
[25:32] could use it you know either one
[25:34] so brother man says in marriage and
[25:35] divorce any woman that refuses a man is
[25:37] child has no right to be a wife to him
[25:38] you remember the Bible when the King
[25:40] married Esther because the queen bashed
[25:42] he now he didn't save actually but
[25:43] because the queen refused he just got
[25:45] him another one what happened when she
[25:47] refused to come out with the King and
[25:48] Obey him the same thing it is with a
[25:50] woman that refuses to be wife to her
[25:52] husband so speaking of vashti
[25:55] he says now now he does the type and so
[25:57] it is with the church that refused to
[25:59] become pregnated in the age that we now
[26:01] live in to bring forth children of this
[26:03] age
[26:04] we are not lutherans we're not Wesley's
[26:06] neither are we Pentecostals we got to be
[26:09] the children of this age through the
[26:11] pregnancy of the word of God
[26:14] Amen to bring forth a child of this age
[26:18] the sea child
[26:19] amen I hope you understand could it be
[26:23] pregnant and no so what'd he do he put
[26:24] her away in divorcement that's right but
[26:26] she theresent put him away he put her
[26:30] away
[26:31] so we again see that type that nobody
[26:33] can put Christ away right because he's
[26:35] God of the universe amen man right
[26:37] but it's Christ who could put a church
[26:40] away
[26:41] all right so there's the two types there
[26:43] uh no they're interesting
[26:47] and uh now I'm going to go through the
[26:49] way I preach it before and the way I
[26:51] taught it I'm going to bring in a few
[26:52] new thoughts then I really have never
[26:53] seen some of these thoughts and they're
[26:54] really beautiful uh by the grace of the
[26:56] Lord
[26:58] okay so Esther chapter two here verse
[27:00] one let's go to Esther two verse one we
[27:02] know Esther chapter one is all about
[27:03] vashti the beautiful church that's put
[27:06] away
[27:08] so we're familiar with that so Esther 2
[27:10] verse 1.
[27:13] and we'll read verses one and two
[27:16] after these things when the wrath of
[27:18] king of azureus was a piece he
[27:20] remembered vashti and what she had done
[27:22] and what was decreed against her then
[27:24] said the king's servants that ministered
[27:26] unto him let there be fair
[27:29] young virgins sought for the king
[27:32] and let the king appoint officers and
[27:34] all the provinces of his kingdom that
[27:36] they may gather together all the fair
[27:38] young virgins under shushan the palace
[27:40] to the house of the women under the
[27:42] custody of haggai the king's Chamberlain
[27:45] Keeper of the women and let their things
[27:47] for purification be given them
[27:51] okay so the first thought I found out I
[27:52] hear was
[27:53] there were many virgins right many
[27:57] virgins were brought in to be royalty
[28:00] Hallelujah but there's only one of them
[28:02] that became the bride Hallelujah
[28:04] and so I believe this is a beautiful
[28:05] type of the wise and foolish virgins
[28:08] amen amen don't you they're all virgins
[28:10] that none of them nobody could say Well
[28:11] they're not virgin
[28:13] they were all proven to be but only one
[28:16] could become Queen Hallelujah and so
[28:18] that's a the first type there a
[28:20] beautiful type I thought I'd bring out
[28:21] there I've never seen that one before
[28:22] until this when I started studying this
[28:25] now I believe though the vashti though
[28:27] represents
[28:29] and because there's uh scripture on this
[28:31] now I'm going to read Esther 1 verse 10.
[28:34] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[28:35] King was married with wine he commanded
[28:37] me human bista harbona big thought
[28:41] there's some big names here and abagtha
[28:43] and zethar and
[28:45] car cash the seven chamberlains that
[28:47] serve in the prince of hazardous the
[28:49] king to bring vashi the queen before the
[28:51] king with the Crown Royal to show the
[28:54] people and the princes are Beauty for
[28:55] she was fair to look upon
[28:58] okay so notice she's brought in on the
[29:01] seventh day
[29:02] okay now I believe that 7 types the
[29:06] seventh Old Testament Church age
[29:09] okay now as I said the brother would
[29:12] type that the Seventh Day represent the
[29:13] seven Church age
[29:15] so I could maybe see that but I see more
[29:18] types that work in the way that I've
[29:20] preached it and taught it before seven
[29:22] represents completion
[29:24] so the Old Testament was completed after
[29:27] vashti was put away and the King started
[29:30] a new covenant actually switched back up
[29:32] here I'd have a couple more slides to
[29:34] show
[29:36] I just hate to flip back and forth
[29:37] because of some of the notes I have I
[29:39] didn't get a chance to put them up there
[29:40] so I preached this uh was it two years
[29:43] ago
[29:44] uh brother Brandon did say there was Old
[29:46] Testament Church ages and it's a really
[29:48] beautiful type four of these ages type
[29:50] out perfectly as far as I can see or
[29:53] near perfect
[29:54] so the Old Testament First Church age
[29:56] was Solomon and that's a beautiful type
[29:58] he wrote the Bible Paul wrote the Bible
[30:00] uh he was a he was a builder Paul laid
[30:03] the foundation I mean it's a beautiful
[30:04] type that's an absolute beautiful type
[30:06] now I don't know about Joseph at uziah
[30:09] Hezekiah but I can clearly see Luther
[30:11] represents Josiah because Josiah found
[30:14] the word of God and it transformed his
[30:16] heart so did Luther he found the just
[30:18] shall live by faith and it totally
[30:19] transformed his heart it's like he never
[30:21] knew the Bible before right and now he
[30:23] knew the Bible and started a great
[30:24] reformation and then Ezra was typed by
[30:27] uh Wesley I forget the types in that one
[30:29] but clearly clearly we can see how the
[30:31] Old Testament ended with Elijah yes amen
[30:34] hallelujah the Old Testament ended with
[30:37] Elijah that was on John the Baptist
[30:38] right and the New Testament ends with
[30:40] the last messenger brother Branham who
[30:42] is Anointed with the spirit of Elijah
[30:44] praise God
[30:45] okay so to me vashi being put away
[30:49] on the seventh day uh represented
[30:54] God putting Israel away on the seventh
[30:57] and final Old Testament Church age now I
[30:59] have a few scriptures for this
[31:01] now here in the Old Testament their
[31:03] Church age was about a thousand years
[31:05] their Church ages our church ages are
[31:08] about 2 000 years
[31:10] I don't know why what did I do oh yeah
[31:11] those last two were missing there okay
[31:14] so it's just interesting you know uh
[31:16] John the Baptist at about a three and a
[31:18] half year Ministry there
[31:19] no I'm sorry I had a six you had a six
[31:21] month Ministry but yeah then it lasted
[31:23] three and a half years Jesus died that
[31:25] started the New Testament right so that
[31:27] John's Ministry and Jesus ministry about
[31:29] three and a half or four years however
[31:31] long doesn't really matter the exact
[31:32] number of years but anyways it was a
[31:34] short Church age and of course our
[31:35] church age our church age is now tied
[31:37] with
[31:38] um Ephesus for being 117 years long
[31:43] it's hard to believe I did that seven
[31:45] years ago my goodness
[31:47] so anyways you can clearly see there are
[31:49] Church ages in the Old Testament and the
[31:51] New Testament
[31:52] and uh some people question us on that
[31:54] but remember the Bible said in Ephesians
[31:56] and Colossians that there were ages in
[31:58] the past and there'll be aged in the
[32:00] future so if there's ages in the past
[32:02] and age in the future there's got to be
[32:04] ages right now in the church Angels
[32:05] there's always been ages praise God
[32:07] so anyone that says their churches
[32:09] aren't in the Bible they don't they
[32:10] haven't read the Bible they need to read
[32:11] the Bible and they need to get studied
[32:13] up by God's grace
[32:14] if you draw that to God God will draw an
[32:16] eye to you amen that's right
[32:19] now after the Jewish Queen uh of the
[32:22] Persian King Xerxes types the New
[32:24] Testament bright church so I believe
[32:26] astrotypes from Paul or the the church
[32:30] ages all the way down to us
[32:32] Esther is a type of the entire bride
[32:35] Church
[32:36] right but especially we see it at the
[32:37] end time
[32:38] you know with the two Banquets we see
[32:41] there with the former latter rain
[32:43] and I believe Israel uh is the type of
[32:47] vashi being blinded and put away you
[32:49] know why because we have a scripture for
[32:50] that
[32:52] we have a scripture she was actually
[32:54] Queen she actually received seed from
[32:57] the King right she actually was had the
[32:59] personal experience with the King
[33:01] but she had to be put away by divorce
[33:04] and we actually have scripture for that
[33:06] so I'm going to read that Isaiah 50
[33:07] verse 1.
[33:09] I'll read that for you by God's grace
[33:11] some people don't know this and then
[33:13] they get kind of confused and mixed up
[33:15] on uh understanding
[33:18] Israel's place
[33:19] Isaiah 50 verse 1.
[33:23] did I put it in here no I didn't okay so
[33:25] that's why I want to read it Isaiah 51.
[33:35] turn it with one hand is a lot slower
[33:37] than two so pardon me about that Isaiah
[33:39] 50 verse 1. thus said the Lord where is
[33:42] the Bill of your mother's divorcement
[33:43] whom I have put away or which of my
[33:46] creditors is to whom I have sold you
[33:48] behold for your iniquities have you sold
[33:50] yourselves and for your transgressions
[33:52] is your mother put away now look at this
[33:54] it's plain God only put Israel away
[33:57] because they transgressed against the
[33:59] Covenant
[34:00] that'll be encouragement to us we're
[34:03] going to always be always be the Bride
[34:04] of Jesus Christ because we're always
[34:06] going to keep the Covenant praise God
[34:07] yes we're going to have little uh minor
[34:10] sins brother says we're gonna have we're
[34:12] going to sin daily but if we do what
[34:14] Paul says if we die daily Jesus won't
[34:16] put us away Hallelujah we'll always be
[34:18] his bride hallelujah amen Christians
[34:20] have struggled that for 2 000 years but
[34:22] here as as we get towards the end we see
[34:25] all the scriptures they're all pointing
[34:26] to God always forgiving us and we're
[34:28] God's beloved and God's word never fails
[34:31] uh uh there's no charges against us
[34:33] there's no condemnation to the Bride of
[34:35] Jesus Christ we must understand and
[34:37] believe we're God's beloved praise God
[34:39] Amen
[34:40] remember it's Satan's job to discourage
[34:42] you
[34:43] is Satan's job to think well God maybe
[34:45] hasn't God maybe God hasn't forgiven you
[34:47] right
[34:48] right or maybe uh maybe you're a Judas
[34:50] like the brother was telling me
[34:53] is that the
[34:55] mower guy now guy can you go
[34:58] tell him I'm not sure what he needs
[34:59] there
[35:01] that doesn't happen very often does it
[35:03] Hallelujah yeah I told him the wedding
[35:06] was on the uh the 12th I told him
[35:10] I told him to come earlier so I gave him
[35:12] a note with the date on it and
[35:14] everything
[35:17] we'll just see if he needs anything
[35:20] cars uh you need your car your car moved
[35:24] off the grass or just say sorry about
[35:26] that it was polite
[35:29] sorry about that Saints
[35:31] that's already does come on Sunday
[35:34] oh that's right no one comes on set
[35:35] that's right
[35:38] yeah sorry about that
[35:42] uh Jeremiah let's go to Jeremiah 3 verse
[35:44] 8.
[35:54] Jeremiah 3 verse 8 and I saw when for
[35:57] all the causes whereby backslitting
[36:00] Israel committed adultery I had her put
[36:02] away and given her a bill of divorce yet
[36:05] her treacherous sister due to fear not
[36:07] but went and played the Harlot also
[36:11] so again we see Israel committing
[36:14] spiritual adulteries against God
[36:16] they're backslidden
[36:18] and notice again no fear of the Lord
[36:21] now church I don't encourage us there
[36:24] are certain sins we'll just never do
[36:25] right why because we fear God
[36:27] so see the presence of the fear of God
[36:29] in your life the reason you won't go so
[36:31] far the reason you you'll never do those
[36:33] things the reason you have that is to
[36:35] protect your life praise God yes and
[36:38] that again proves you're the Bride of
[36:39] Jesus Christ amen Israel could be
[36:42] divorced because they lost the fear of
[36:44] God
[36:45] they committed constant adultery
[36:47] constant backslidings and church
[36:49] remember their backslidings lasted years
[36:51] right Simon back said so much he built
[36:54] all those altars I'm sorry all those
[36:57] authors all those houses of worship for
[36:59] all the other gods it lasted years our
[37:01] backside you might last a day hopefully
[37:03] it's a day
[37:04] it might last a week a month hopefully
[37:06] not much Beyond a month or two
[37:08] but what I'm saying is that see we
[37:10] always come back to God hallelujah and
[37:12] church member even Peter baxton and
[37:14] wouldn't eat with the Gentiles
[37:16] right Paul said I die I do the things I
[37:19] hate he backsitted and did things he
[37:21] hated but they were still the Bride of
[37:23] Jesus Christ they were still forgiven
[37:25] they still had the Holy Ghost in their
[37:26] Souls praise God Amen they were just
[37:28] fighting awful mind battles so it says
[37:30] if we can just keep coming to God and
[37:32] get the victory over their mind battles
[37:34] well then surely God will prove to us
[37:35] that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[37:37] hallelujah amen like that's what brother
[37:39] Brook said what meant so much to him out
[37:41] there where
[37:42] God had to prove to Abraham that his
[37:45] word was true right right God had to
[37:48] prove it Abraham was laughing Sarah's
[37:50] laughing yeah right us us have a body
[37:52] change but God came to prove the word to
[37:55] them and God proved it was true God is
[37:57] going to do the same for us God's going
[37:59] to prove we're going to have a body
[38:00] change
[38:01] he has to because we don't have any
[38:03] ability of ourselves to believe the word
[38:05] of God faith is a gift rapturing faith
[38:08] is a gift everything is a gift and so
[38:10] God's going to prove his word to us and
[38:12] we will believe all of God's word
[38:13] hallelujah amen amen
[38:15] so this notice the difference here
[38:17] between a divorced woman and Esther
[38:20] Hallelujah this means Esther had to fear
[38:22] the lord
[38:24] this means Esther didn't backslide
[38:26] right inner soul I'll say like that we
[38:29] don't backsided our soul because our
[38:31] soul cannot sin praise God
[38:33] First John 3 verse 9. we're familiar
[38:35] with that one
[38:36] I've been laboring on that one Lately by
[38:37] God's grace
[38:38] now the second type is mordecai now
[38:40] Mordecai the Hebrew means little man so
[38:42] I'm not sure how the type works out
[38:44] there that's interesting it means little
[38:45] man so Esther had a little man not a big
[38:48] man a little man guiding her
[38:52] so I don't know if that means like a
[38:53] little still Small Voice I don't know
[38:55] I'm trying every Wham like all these
[38:57] last few days like how can I make this
[38:58] type does this work does that work I
[39:00] just come to the conclusion uh at this
[39:01] point I don't know maybe we'll get more
[39:03] Revelation as time goes on
[39:05] but Esther 2 verse five I'll read that
[39:07] here
[39:12] and now in shushan the palace there was
[39:14] a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai
[39:15] the little man the son of jair or the
[39:17] son of shimiah the son of Kisha Benjamin
[39:20] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[39:21] with the Captivity which had been
[39:23] carried away with jeconiah king of Judah
[39:25] whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[39:28] had carried away and he brought up
[39:30] Hadassah that is Esther Esther means
[39:32] star
[39:33] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[39:36] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[39:39] and beautiful who Mordecai when her
[39:41] father and mother were dead took for his
[39:43] own daughter interesting star the Bible
[39:45] says if we overcome we get the Morning
[39:47] Star right amen so there's something
[39:49] there's some connection there and I
[39:51] don't even know how to explain that what
[39:51] does that mean do I carry a star around
[39:53] in my pocket or what how do I get the
[39:55] Morning Star
[39:57] I would just say I just maybe Shine Like
[39:58] Jesus maybe maybe my glorified body
[40:00] shines like a star just like Jesus I
[40:03] don't know but if he wants to give me
[40:04] hidden Mana a star I'll take all that
[40:06] I'll take off I must have pockets in my
[40:09] glorified body or something like that I
[40:11] can put it here I'll eat that and it
[40:13] must refresh every day I'm not sure but
[40:15] if Jesus Promised it I believe I'll get
[40:17] it praise God now no notice Mordecai
[40:19] brought up Esther and then he directed
[40:22] her to Christ
[40:24] right and remember Mordecai isn't the
[40:27] bride but he's related to her
[40:30] now in the other the brother types
[40:32] Mordecai to brother Branham which could
[40:34] be
[40:35] uh brother Ram's message you know
[40:37] and brother man was a little man
[40:39] gotta open it up here
[40:42] I don't know there might be some overlap
[40:44] too
[40:45] but you know if you look at the type
[40:47] though that means brother random wasn't
[40:49] in the bride
[40:51] so that doesn't seem to work there and
[40:53] then brother random after
[40:55] uh all the Jews were saved then brother
[40:57] Brown becomes second in command in
[40:59] heaven
[41:01] and I don't know there's 24 elders
[41:04] I'm not a brother by worshiper so you
[41:06] know I'm I'm not gonna side with that
[41:07] one
[41:08] I know John the Baptist was the greatest
[41:10] in the old judgment though
[41:11] but I'm not quite sure how to type that
[41:13] out so you see how you see when you
[41:15] start really thinking about the types
[41:16] now this was a real shouting sermon
[41:18] there in July which there's a lot of
[41:20] beautiful types in there for some of
[41:21] them I think they're shouting without
[41:22] understanding and that's okay I do the
[41:24] same thing
[41:25] sometimes I shout at things and actually
[41:27] I never really thought about that too
[41:28] far
[41:30] so I just want to preach through through
[41:32] this again here and then you know even
[41:33] for me I have to change my type because
[41:35] here I believe Mordecai is the Old
[41:37] Testament law but how does the law
[41:39] become second in command in heaven
[41:42] right so then so then you know later I
[41:44] changed Mordecai Mordecai would be the
[41:45] 144 000 because they're not the bride
[41:48] but they're servants to the bride so I
[41:50] you know I've got to change my types
[41:52] because I can't see how the type works
[41:54] here
[41:55] does everybody understand yes so it's a
[41:57] little bit difficult to type
[42:00] another one is the brother type you know
[42:01] when when uh
[42:03] when Esther came in uh to the king
[42:06] because uh the Jews were gonna die you
[42:09] know the King extended his scepter and
[42:12] the brother who typed the scepter to
[42:13] Jesus Christ well isn't the King Jesus
[42:15] Christ
[42:16] you know so how can that work you know
[42:19] it's just there's just some types that
[42:21] just don't seem to fit praise God okay
[42:24] but uh
[42:26] Mordecai directed Esther to Christ and
[42:30] the Bible says that the scriptures
[42:32] direct us to Christ
[42:34] eternal life right amen
[42:35] from a child Timothy knew the scriptures
[42:38] that which were able to make him wise
[42:40] unto salvation through faith which is in
[42:43] Christ Jesus
[42:44] now I don't know all of you had it but
[42:46] we ought to be thankful we had a Godly
[42:48] mother father that was pointing us to
[42:50] the word of God right even like my mom
[42:52] you know she wasn't really uh
[42:55] maybe heavy on teaching us to work but
[42:57] at least she took us to church I thank
[42:59] God for that
[43:00] right
[43:02] um because it was I was able to at least
[43:04] memorize John 3 16.
[43:07] that might have been the only one I
[43:08] memorized
[43:09] but now we got Revelation 10 7 Luke 17
[43:12] 30 memorized and all these good
[43:13] scriptures praise God hallelujah
[43:16] my mom also help me remember I memorize
[43:18] second Timothy 1 verse 7. for God has
[43:20] not given us a spirit of fear but a
[43:21] power of love and a sound mind
[43:24] Hallelujah
[43:25] and so Mordecai here points Esther
[43:29] to Christ and the uh once Israel is put
[43:32] away now Christ could find a people for
[43:35] his namesake to be his new bride
[43:38] Mordecai Esther's cousin urges her to
[43:41] enter the contest to become Xerxes new
[43:43] wife Mordecai the Elder a staunch Jew
[43:45] again types the holy law of Moses as a
[43:49] school Master to point us to Christ
[43:51] I've also thought maybe Mordecai
[43:53] represented Saint Paul
[43:55] and Saint Paul was pointing the bride to
[43:57] Christ I don't know
[43:59] but the Bible says wherefore the law was
[44:01] our school Master to bring us unto
[44:03] Christ that we might be justified by
[44:05] faith
[44:07] Hallelujah
[44:08] and remember John calls Jesus the
[44:11] increasing bridegroom
[44:13] right now that's a thought we want to
[44:15] keep in mind right John the Baptist said
[44:17] I must decrease I must die so that Jesus
[44:19] may increase amen we see the same in
[44:22] brother Adams Ministry God has allowed
[44:24] him to decrease he's passed off the
[44:25] scene so our our focus should be on
[44:28] Jesus amen right but we can't understand
[44:30] Jesus message without the prophet Jesus
[44:33] sent right
[44:34] right
[44:35] so we have to look at the scripture
[44:36] brother and pointing us to Hallelujah
[44:38] that's why when they send anointed ones
[44:39] at the end times that's why we listen to
[44:41] those sermons because program this
[44:43] ministry points us to the Bible like
[44:45] well Ram was the one that pointed out
[44:46] the tares are bound first
[44:48] I never heard that in denomination I
[44:50] never heard that at the chapel
[44:52] they had no idea about that Parable but
[44:55] we have a great idea about it praise God
[44:57] why because the Mysteries are given to
[44:59] us hallelujah because we are the
[45:01] children of the of God hallelujah
[45:04] John said he that hath the bride is the
[45:06] bridegroom but the friend of the
[45:08] bridegroom was standeth in here then
[45:09] rejoices greatly because the
[45:11] bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore
[45:13] is fulfilled he must increase but I must
[45:17] decrease
[45:18] and I've heard preachers say it too
[45:19] church I believe a program came to our
[45:21] church he would be so happy in our
[45:23] church
[45:24] because he's seeing people live out the
[45:27] message that he preached
[45:29] amen I believe he'd be happy at a master
[45:32] churches that at least I listen to
[45:33] online as well because the people aren't
[45:35] worshiping brother Branham they're
[45:37] pointing the people to Jesus Christ
[45:39] they're having Youth meetings to get
[45:40] people filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[45:42] amen they're having worship services to
[45:44] worship and exalt Jesus Christ
[45:46] Hallelujah they're making videos to
[45:49] teach people the message of the hour
[45:50] praise God
[45:51] said teaching he said lays your
[45:53] foundation Hallelujah it put your roots
[45:56] down Hallelujah in other words you can't
[45:57] be shaken because God's revealed your
[45:59] position to you already amen amen
[46:03] and brother random said it's Jesus
[46:04] behind the Bible Ministry
[46:06] brother answer the fivefold ministers
[46:08] are God's dress wear so when God when
[46:11] Jesus wants to speak to you he comes and
[46:12] anoints the pastor and he stands behind
[46:14] the veil of the pastor and preaches to
[46:16] you
[46:17] like they say the pastor is the voice
[46:19] behind the voice you have to listen for
[46:21] Jesus voice behind my voice
[46:23] same thing for the Evangelist same thing
[46:25] for the Apostle right the teacher
[46:28] Hallelujah all the fivefold ministry the
[46:30] prophet Minor Prophets only now but you
[46:32] got to look for Jesus voice behind the
[46:34] dress where behind the veil look behind
[46:37] the skins look behind the badger skins
[46:38] Hallelujah and listen to the voice of
[46:40] God hear God's voice it's Jesus talking
[46:42] to us is Jesus increasing today praise
[46:45] God Amen like I told you that one Pastor
[46:47] from Florida
[46:49] he had two witnesses a message pastor
[46:51] and a Catholic woman said witches are in
[46:53] your church trying to get you to play
[46:54] tapes and he found it to be right
[46:56] because witchcraft is the sin of
[46:58] rebellion against the word of God that
[47:01] was back in 2016. so think about how
[47:03] they've Advanced yeah
[47:05] but I thought I would tell you that no
[47:06] wonder I've been blasting that all these
[47:07] years no wonder praise God I go around
[47:10] and he didn't realize why was I blessed
[47:11] in denomination why was I blasting it
[47:13] and then the Holy Spirit showed him if
[47:14] the Deeds of nickelators it's the
[47:16] doctrine of Balaam Hallelujah
[47:18] it's it's uh it's the Jezebel religion
[47:21] he said all these years he said Ed it's
[47:22] going to come into the mark of the beast
[47:24] praise God he said no wonder I've lasted
[47:26] all those years because it will be the
[47:28] mark of the beast no wonder see God's
[47:30] spirit always guides Us in the right
[47:32] path Hallelujah
[47:33] Amen in other words if you're growing in
[47:36] Grace and now is your lord you won't be
[47:37] too far off the beaten path you'll be
[47:40] right down the middle of the road praise
[47:41] God amen amen so Jesus is the bridegroom
[47:46] but he's got a bride Hallelujah and when
[47:48] there have been much disputing Peter
[47:50] rose up and some of them men and
[47:51] Brethren you know how that a good while
[47:53] ago God made Choice Among Us that the
[47:55] Gentiles by my mouth should hear the
[47:57] word of the gospel and believe
[47:59] and God which knoweth the hearts better
[48:00] than witness giving them the Holy Ghost
[48:02] even as he did unto us
[48:04] sending hath declared how God at first
[48:06] did visit the Gentiles to take out of
[48:09] them a people for his name
[48:11] isn't that beautiful when I got married
[48:13] I said I want Kristen to be a Smith
[48:16] I want her to be a Smith with me I took
[48:19] her for my name praise God it's a lot
[48:21] shorter than hesterman too it's a pretty
[48:22] I mean estherman's pretty good name but
[48:24] I wanted to take her for my day I want
[48:26] her to be associated with me same thing
[48:28] Jesus did for us praise God Amen he
[48:30] wants us to be associated with the true
[48:32] Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah with
[48:35] his name the name of Jesus praise God
[48:37] not fathers but holy ghost but the name
[48:39] of Jesus the name of of all names praise
[48:42] God
[48:43] he took us out for his name
[48:47] now their type is Esther's virginity
[48:49] this means you're justified by faith
[48:52] because foolish virgins are saved as
[48:54] well
[48:55] let me get your Bible go to uh Matthew
[48:58] 25 I don't have this one written down
[48:59] but I want to review it just so uh maybe
[49:02] the newcomers here
[49:03] can see it
[49:06] Matthew 25 in the parable of uh the
[49:11] great white Throne judgment Jesus Calls
[49:13] the foolish virgin
[49:14] they were predestinated and foreknown
[49:17] before the foundation of the world too
[49:19] Hallelujah
[49:21] think about that any person who's saved
[49:23] God has a place for them in his future
[49:26] Kingdom
[49:27] now they're not born again so they won't
[49:29] have a part in Jesus's spiritual Kingdom
[49:32] right now
[49:33] right they won't have a part in it right
[49:34] now because the kingdom of God is within
[49:36] you now but they'll have a part in the
[49:38] future home
[49:40] right that Kingdom
[49:42] that's right Matthew 25.
[49:48] okay let's read 31. when the son of man
[49:50] shall come in his glory all the Holy
[49:51] Angels with him then shall he sit upon
[49:53] the throne in his glory or Throne of his
[49:55] glory
[49:56] and before him shall be gathered all
[49:57] nations he shall separate them one from
[49:59] another as a shepherd divideth and sheep
[50:01] from the goats
[50:02] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[50:04] hand but the goats on his left think
[50:06] about that Donald Trump Joe Biden
[50:09] zielinski
[50:11] Putin they'll all be gathered there and
[50:14] they're either on one side or the other
[50:16] right
[50:17] right but we'll be seated with Christ
[50:19] amen because do you not know that Saints
[50:22] shall judge the Earth
[50:25] but they'll all be standing there I'll
[50:27] be looking up to Jesus right now we're
[50:28] all looking up to them they're the great
[50:29] one they got all the power they only
[50:31] have power of God allows in their power
[50:32] that's right and God can tear them down
[50:34] and raise up somebody else
[50:37] but all nations will be standing there
[50:40] and Jesus Will separate sheep on my
[50:42] sheep on my right hand and goats on the
[50:44] left hand
[50:45] verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on
[50:48] his right hand and go to the left here
[50:49] it is then shall the king say to them on
[50:51] the right hand Come Ye blessed on my
[50:53] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[50:55] you from the foundation of the world
[50:58] this is the white Throne judgment so
[51:00] only thing that's left right is casting
[51:02] all the the devils and the sinners in
[51:04] the Lake of Fire and then the future
[51:05] home
[51:06] but he tells these that that get saved
[51:09] and they're surprised to me say think
[51:10] about that they're surprised to be saved
[51:12] he says I prepared it from the
[51:14] foundation of the world Hallelujah that
[51:16] beautiful God's got two sections of his
[51:19] book right he's got a Lamb's Book and
[51:21] he's got a book of life yes we know in
[51:23] the Lamb's Book of Life we're so we're
[51:25] so special you know we're beloved
[51:27] Hallelujah but also the ones that remain
[51:29] in the Book of Life they're special to
[51:31] God too they believed in God too they
[51:33] got a place in heaven too praise God
[51:35] hallelujah
[51:38] that's why we never want to belittle
[51:39] anyone that's not in the message
[51:42] people ask me this week numerous times
[51:44] can someone get the Holy Ghost in the
[51:45] nomination well I said only if
[51:48] there's like I think I might do this too
[51:49] only if there's an exception like
[51:52] some of some exception but generally the
[51:54] Bible says they they've got to hear a
[51:56] holy ghost Bill preacher to get the Holy
[51:58] Ghost like Acts chapter 19.
[52:01] right
[52:02] now there's some people uh not a part of
[52:05] our church that say they got the holy
[52:06] ghost out of denomination well maybe I
[52:08] don't know maybe it's possible
[52:10] but for me I gotta stay with the Bible
[52:12] praise God yeah the Bible says you get
[52:14] the Holy Ghost when another person with
[52:16] the Holy Ghost preaches the word of God
[52:17] to you praise God
[52:20] that's just my opinion
[52:22] and at least I got some Bible to back it
[52:24] up but there could be some exceptions
[52:27] who's going to see that
[52:28] uh
[52:30] and then they're they're surprised
[52:33] they're surprised in verse 37.
[52:34] eventually the righteous answer Lord
[52:35] when saw we the hungered and fed thee or
[52:38] thirsty and gave the drink the winds all
[52:39] we could be a stranger and took the in
[52:41] or naked and clothing or when saw we
[52:44] these sick or in prison and came to see
[52:45] thee and the Kings shall answer and
[52:47] saying to them Veritas in you ends as
[52:49] much as you have done it it's unto one
[52:51] of the least of these my brother and
[52:52] you've done it unto me praise God so
[52:54] these people didn't even know when they
[52:56] visited brother Jess or when they
[52:58] visited brother amen in the hospital
[52:59] right or whatever they didn't even know
[53:02] we're like brother Levi in prison
[53:06] they didn't even know when they were
[53:07] visiting that they didn't know I'm
[53:09] visiting a portion of the body of Christ
[53:11] and they realize
[53:13] like your parents maybe brother I don't
[53:14] know we'll just trust God for his Mercy
[53:16] I don't know
[53:18] they didn't even know wow this person is
[53:21] a part of Christ yeah yeah they're part
[53:23] of the spiritual body of Jesus Christ
[53:25] and like you've heard said I don't care
[53:27] if I'm the pinky I don't care if I'm the
[53:29] knee I just want to be a part of that
[53:31] body praise God and then every serpent
[53:33] is under my feet praise God hallelujah
[53:35] even if I'm the skin on the bottom of
[53:36] the feet Hallelujah I'm still far and I
[53:39] believe I believe I'm the lowest of
[53:40] those but I'm still part of Christ how
[53:43] do I know because I believe God's word
[53:45] amen
[53:46] I live God's word
[53:49] I'm not perfect but the reality is no
[53:51] man is perfect that's right but I want
[53:54] to grow in Grace I want to be diligent I
[53:55] want to be faithful as the Bible says I
[53:56] want to be all these things the Bible
[53:58] tells us to be so I believe Esther's
[54:00] virginity and I think we already read it
[54:02] there in Esther chapter two yeah
[54:05] so this this virginity types out you're
[54:08] saved right God's not there's no
[54:11] condemnation Hallelujah
[54:13] to the believer
[54:14] right there can't be because Jesus just
[54:16] said it right here if ever he's going to
[54:18] judge him it's right here and he says I
[54:20] I I've saved you I've already prepared
[54:23] the kingdom of the world the kingdom of
[54:24] the Future King is for you I've already
[54:26] saved you there's no sins all the
[54:28] charges have been dropped Hallelujah
[54:31] amen
[54:33] see when we got saved Saints when we got
[54:35] saved we're versions of the word
[54:39] amen hallelujah
[54:41] and this is the power of the blood of
[54:43] Jesus Christ think about this church
[54:45] again God set for Jesus to be a
[54:47] perpetuation a wrath taker through faith
[54:50] in his blood the Wrath that we are or do
[54:53] is already been paid for
[54:56] Jesus can't send me to hell because
[54:57] Jesus already went to hell for me
[55:00] he already paid the punishment for my
[55:02] sins so I got nothing to worry about
[55:04] praise God I can be anxious for nothing
[55:07] but as the Bible says but when
[55:09] everything be be prayerful and thankful
[55:11] with Thanksgiving in my heart making
[55:13] singing making melody in my heart with
[55:15] joy to the Lord praise God
[55:19] Hallelujah
[55:21] because I have faith I Believe In The
[55:23] Blood thank you Jesus for the blood of
[55:25] life I've just seen that after service
[55:27] amen
[55:29] he says because Jesus declared his
[55:32] Holiness his righteous for the sending
[55:34] away of my sins and your sins
[55:37] through the grace of God
[55:40] isn't that you know let's be honest
[55:43] what's the often most battle Satan
[55:45] fights us with every every week you're
[55:46] not worthy
[55:47] right you didn't do enough this week
[55:51] you weren't good enough this week
[55:54] all those sins have already been paid
[55:55] for devil right amen they've already
[55:57] been paid for the fact is I'm still
[55:59] standing praise God Amen the fact is I'm
[56:02] obeying God's word by coming to church
[56:03] today amen right right and that's that's
[56:07] often what we're gonna battle oh well
[56:09] yeah you're going to church but you're
[56:11] just not good enough I wasn't saved by
[56:13] my goodness praise God I'm not going to
[56:15] be raptured by my goodness Hallelujah
[56:17] let me raptured because I've got the
[56:20] Holy Ghost praise God because he gave me
[56:22] the gift of the Holy Ghost because I
[56:23] kept marching all the way to the ark
[56:26] took me in back over Jordan and I'm in
[56:28] the promised land praise God Amen I just
[56:30] followed Joshua I just followed Jesus
[56:32] amen and the Ark opened up the way I
[56:35] just believe God's word hallelujah amen
[56:38] amen
[56:41] so see she had to be she was required to
[56:43] be virgin that's what the blood of Jesus
[56:44] Christ makes us makes us virgin to the
[56:46] word
[56:47] so The Virginity types complete Devotion
[56:50] to Christ with no worldly intercourse
[56:51] right
[56:52] now what's amazing not one evil word is
[56:55] recorded about Esther's character amen
[56:57] who shall lay any charge to the account
[57:00] of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it's
[57:02] God that justifies his people
[57:05] thank God Amen nobody can lay an account
[57:09] to your charge praise God Amen
[57:11] nobody can do it because that's what the
[57:14] blood did it was a substitute for all
[57:16] your sins and you get all his
[57:18] righteousness praise God Amen
[57:20] it's a gift
[57:22] a gift of Grace and now look remember
[57:25] this scripture this is a church that at
[57:28] one time was so backsplitted they were
[57:30] they were okay with a man sleeping with
[57:32] his stepmom they didn't even mourn over
[57:34] everybody knew the sin was in the church
[57:36] but nobody said nothing about it
[57:38] right they were okay with that they were
[57:41] they were they had people in the church
[57:42] Ali that were going to take someone else
[57:44] to the core and sue them
[57:46] imagine that
[57:48] Emma's gonna Sue Ally
[57:51] or Lydia is going to sue her dad please
[57:55] you're sitting right there in the church
[57:58] and yet he tells them
[57:59] when you got saved he says I espoused
[58:02] you I engaged you as a chaste Virgin of
[58:05] Christ
[58:07] hallelujah look at that
[58:09] see when you get saved your version of
[58:11] Christ
[58:14] now I don't we don't know all the
[58:15] details but the Bible said uh in The
[58:19] Exodus a mixed multitude came out so
[58:22] that in that in this church they might
[58:23] have had a mix of altitude
[58:24] some people might have believed Paul's
[58:26] message but not really believe in it
[58:28] right they might have come out they
[58:29] might come to church but they're not
[58:30] living it God help us to live the word
[58:32] of God Amen
[58:34] right Paul was jealous why are all these
[58:36] simple things happen when I when you got
[58:38] saved when you got baptized you were a
[58:41] chaste Virgin of Christ
[58:43] now Chase means totally pure is that
[58:45] awesome the blood makes us totally pure
[58:47] praise God in other words your past is
[58:50] away Satan can't bring up your past it's
[58:52] been paid for praise God Amen Hallelujah
[58:55] and all I got is a bright future brother
[58:57] awesome praise God because my past has
[58:59] been forgotten praise God
[59:02] all you have to live for is a great
[59:03] present and a great future
[59:05] right but my past sinful life has been
[59:08] put away praise God hallelujah amen
[59:11] and he sees me as pure like I've never
[59:13] done anything in the first place
[59:15] Glory praise God
[59:17] it's as if as though I never did it in
[59:20] the verse boys I know I did it
[59:21] but it wasn't the soul praise God
[59:27] now this is a new type I had thought a
[59:30] thought out here Esther as an orphan
[59:32] represents the Gentiles with no Covenant
[59:34] she had no father mother
[59:36] right she had no headship and what the
[59:39] Bible say about the Gentiles we are
[59:40] without Christ he's the real head
[59:44] right and Melchizedek had no father
[59:45] mother because Melchizedek was God right
[59:47] so Christ is God
[59:49] we are without Christ we were aliens
[59:51] from the Commonwealth of Israel
[59:54] right and Esther was out of Israel
[59:55] that's interesting type there too and
[59:57] strangers from the covenants of Promise
[59:58] having no hope and without God in the
[1:00:00] world so Esther was basically an orphan
[1:00:02] but somebody took her in
[1:00:05] no it could be the Old Testament law I
[1:00:07] even thought about it just could be the
[1:00:08] holy spirit for justification it could
[1:00:11] be that
[1:00:12] so these men could represent stages of
[1:00:14] Grace So Mordecai might represent
[1:00:17] justification haggai might represent
[1:00:19] sanctification so I'm not sure
[1:00:22] but the main thing is to see the story
[1:00:24] but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[1:00:27] were far off are made nigh unto the
[1:00:30] blood of Christ
[1:00:31] so Esther had no hope no parents but now
[1:00:34] she's brought nigh to the king oh my God
[1:00:37] Amen oh my and George whether she was
[1:00:39] received or not she was gonna have all
[1:00:41] her needs taken care of the rest of her
[1:00:43] life church all of our needs to be taken
[1:00:45] care of by Jesus Christ
[1:00:47] even your foolish person praise God
[1:00:49] right your sins are done away with
[1:00:52] praise God yes your faith has got to be
[1:00:54] tested it's got to be tried but
[1:00:55] everything's gonna be taken care of God
[1:00:57] he's already called you into Heavenly
[1:00:59] places praise God he's already got a
[1:01:01] name he's got he got your name on The
[1:01:02] Book of Life in heaven he's already got
[1:01:04] a portion for you in the Kingdom of
[1:01:06] Heaven praise God Amen he foreknew you
[1:01:08] would come he foreknew you'd be virgin
[1:01:10] to the word
[1:01:11] and you've already got a place you're
[1:01:14] seated amongst royalty brother
[1:01:15] hallelujah amen this one this royalty in
[1:01:19] that Palace and that's where we are
[1:01:20] we're seated in the Heavenly places with
[1:01:22] the royalty of Heaven hallelujah amen
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:27] you don't think that you don't think
[1:01:28] you're sitting with some royalty around
[1:01:29] here
[1:01:30] aren't you Kings Embrace unto God right
[1:01:33] amen Hallelujah
[1:01:36] you don't think there's a great reward
[1:01:37] for Beatrice leaving the denomination
[1:01:39] coming the message dedicating your whole
[1:01:42] life to the message these last 40 some
[1:01:43] years you don't think there's a great
[1:01:44] reward for 40 years of service
[1:01:46] I would say there's a great reward
[1:01:49] amen don't you think so
[1:01:51] Hallelujah
[1:01:53] there's got to be some royalty around
[1:01:55] here somewhere this is right we're
[1:01:58] sending the most heavily royalty here by
[1:02:00] God's grace Hallelujah
[1:02:05] she was taken in now she's got a
[1:02:07] covenant
[1:02:08] Hallelujah now she's got a future
[1:02:12] why because she's virgin and she's
[1:02:14] beautiful
[1:02:15] amen your version by justification
[1:02:19] you're beautiful because character's
[1:02:20] beautiful
[1:02:21] character
[1:02:23] that's what God's looking for character
[1:02:27] now I'm gonna let's go to chapter two
[1:02:29] verse eight you got your Bible there
[1:02:30] this is the one I kind of want to Major
[1:02:32] on here by God's grace
[1:02:42] thank you
[1:02:47] all right
[1:02:48] um Esther 2 verse 8.
[1:02:53] no it's all came to pass when the king's
[1:02:55] commandment and his decree Was Heard and
[1:02:57] when many maidens were gathered together
[1:02:58] under shoeshine the palace to the
[1:03:00] custody of hagian that Esther was
[1:03:02] brought also onto the King's house to
[1:03:04] the custody of haggai Keeper of the
[1:03:06] women
[1:03:08] and the Maiden pleased him and she
[1:03:10] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[1:03:12] gave her things for her purification
[1:03:14] with such things as belong to her and
[1:03:17] seven maidens which were meat to be
[1:03:19] given her out of the King's house and he
[1:03:21] prepared her and her Maids under the
[1:03:23] best place of the House of the women
[1:03:25] this is awesome
[1:03:27] immediately as she comes into the the
[1:03:30] the Royal Chambers she gets favor with
[1:03:33] haggai
[1:03:34] immediately right and of course we know
[1:03:38] this is sanctification now here's a new
[1:03:40] thought I never had this before but all
[1:03:42] these churches I just about to church
[1:03:43] this week that said come as you are I
[1:03:45] think it was right on this road right on
[1:03:46] here Turkey Foot Road let's see where we
[1:03:48] uh yeah took the road out there
[1:03:50] and it said come as you are right I
[1:03:52] thought oh that's a nice sign you know
[1:03:53] Come As You Are
[1:03:55] but if you apply that spiritually that's
[1:03:57] true
[1:03:58] Esther came as she was but she couldn't
[1:04:01] stay that way
[1:04:02] hallelujah it's true come as you are but
[1:04:07] now you're going to go through a
[1:04:08] purification process
[1:04:13] always come as you are but then you if
[1:04:17] you want to come before the king amen if
[1:04:19] you want time with the King amen if you
[1:04:21] want your turn church this is our turn
[1:04:23] this is our generation to be with the
[1:04:25] King praise God
[1:04:27] this is our turn we won't get another
[1:04:30] turn before this won't get one after
[1:04:31] this is our turn so we got to be
[1:04:34] purified to have a turn with Christ
[1:04:35] hallelujah amen amen
[1:04:40] so we can come we're virgin and thank
[1:04:43] God we're forgiven but we still got to
[1:04:45] be purified and the word sanctification
[1:04:47] means purification right amen
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:51] all of our sins are forgiven God don't
[1:04:53] hold any of our past to us thank God
[1:04:55] Hallelujah nothing in my past gonna be
[1:04:57] late to me Hallelujah
[1:05:01] but he still needs me to be pure
[1:05:03] Hallelujah
[1:05:06] this is the great scripture
[1:05:08] where they say oh Esther put on makeup I
[1:05:11] beg to I beg your pardon
[1:05:13] where does the bible ever say paint in
[1:05:15] this verse
[1:05:16] the Bible doesn't say paint
[1:05:19] the Bible said Jezebel painted Israel
[1:05:21] painted uh and then Judah painted as
[1:05:24] there's three types two of them were
[1:05:25] Nations one of them was Jezebel the
[1:05:27] Bible never said Esther painted anything
[1:05:29] she might have paid in some beautiful
[1:05:31] landscaping scenes in her free time or
[1:05:32] something like that
[1:05:33] you sure that pain in her face yeah
[1:05:37] yeah but notice she pleased her she
[1:05:39] beats him he
[1:05:41] types sanctification now some people
[1:05:43] will type that as brother Brandon oh
[1:05:45] yeah I forgot to type in your notice
[1:05:46] what'd she get she got seven maidens
[1:05:50] now he may not understand you may not
[1:05:52] agree with me on this but I believe she
[1:05:54] had to have seven babies before she
[1:05:55] could go into the king
[1:05:57] pardon me
[1:05:59] seven helpers
[1:06:00] before she went into the king okay
[1:06:03] Hallelujah Why seven why why she needs
[1:06:07] seven before she goes into the King
[1:06:08] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:06:11] well she had to help her she couldn't do
[1:06:13] it alone praise God and church we can't
[1:06:15] do it alone we've got to have help to go
[1:06:17] in the presence of the king praise God
[1:06:18] Amen so I believe those sit on some
[1:06:20] people may say Seven Seals maybe could
[1:06:23] be
[1:06:24] but I believe it's those seven uh
[1:06:26] attributes of a stature perfect man
[1:06:28] seven helpers that will be right there
[1:06:30] to help her out how many know that Faith
[1:06:32] helps you out when you when you need
[1:06:33] when you need Faith amen when you invert
[1:06:36] you when you need some uh knowledge some
[1:06:39] patience it's right there to help you
[1:06:41] out isn't it amen hallelujah
[1:06:44] and I'll say like this it was given to
[1:06:45] you yes Glory so seven maidens were
[1:06:49] given to you and also wisdom is typed
[1:06:52] out as a woman in the scripture she has
[1:06:54] building her house
[1:06:56] so the attributes of the Holy Spirit are
[1:06:59] feminine in designation
[1:07:01] and so she's given seven maidens this is
[1:07:03] going to help you be accepted with the
[1:07:05] King
[1:07:07] Hallelujah
[1:07:09] that's a freshman that came yesterday by
[1:07:11] God's grace I I think it's fresh
[1:07:13] Hallelujah and notice she was preferred
[1:07:16] Above All The Virgins
[1:07:19] Esther gets the preference she gets uh
[1:07:23] she gets favor verse 10. Esther had not
[1:07:27] showed her people nor her Kindred for
[1:07:29] Mordecai I'd charge her that she should
[1:07:31] not show it now I don't really fully
[1:07:33] understand the Revelation behind this
[1:07:35] but as I said everybody thought Esther
[1:07:38] was a gentile everybody thought she was
[1:07:40] from shushan
[1:07:42] however you say that doesn't have to say
[1:07:43] wrong and to me that's a beautiful type
[1:07:46] of the Gentile Church
[1:07:48] right and us
[1:07:50] and so we can clearly see her lineage
[1:07:53] was a secret her DNA was a secret
[1:07:56] Hallelujah nobody knew where she really
[1:07:59] came from
[1:08:00] Hallelujah but she knew where she come
[1:08:02] from
[1:08:06] right even the devil the devil didn't
[1:08:07] really know where she come from until
[1:08:09] the time of the rapture
[1:08:11] Hallelujah I like that
[1:08:14] verse 11 and Mordecai walked every day
[1:08:16] before the court of the women's house to
[1:08:18] know how Esther did and what should
[1:08:20] become of her
[1:08:22] so again if you talk to his brother
[1:08:23] random how does brother random check
[1:08:24] every day before she's born again I
[1:08:27] don't know see that's why to me it looks
[1:08:29] like maybe the Holy Spirit or the first
[1:08:31] work of Grace or something I don't know
[1:08:33] some of these types are hard to see now
[1:08:35] verse 12 is what we're going to get to
[1:08:36] now in every Mage turn was come to go
[1:08:38] into King Azure after that she had been
[1:08:40] 12 months according to the manner of
[1:08:41] women
[1:08:42] for so were the days of our
[1:08:44] purifications accomplished two at six
[1:08:47] months oil myrrh and six months with
[1:08:49] sweet odors and with other things for
[1:08:51] the purifying of women
[1:08:54] okay anybody see any makeup in there
[1:08:57] no any Max Factor in there did I miss
[1:08:59] Max Factor in there what's the
[1:09:01] Maybelline maybe it's Maybelline is that
[1:09:03] what they call it
[1:09:05] that really dates me back in the 80s
[1:09:08] but this is sanctification she's already
[1:09:10] Justified she's already virgin of the
[1:09:12] word thank God Hallelujah but you got to
[1:09:15] be purified Hallelujah there's no makeup
[1:09:17] here but I like how there's oil
[1:09:19] Hallelujah and oil represents the Holy
[1:09:22] Spirit praise God hallelujah
[1:09:24] and sweet odors of the Bible say our
[1:09:27] prayers and our worship is like sweet
[1:09:29] odors to God
[1:09:30] amen the Bible says that when you say
[1:09:32] praise the Lord think about that sister
[1:09:34] sir you know when you just say praise
[1:09:35] the Lord when you're driving home or
[1:09:36] praise the Lord that's a sweet odor
[1:09:38] going up before God right
[1:09:40] right and this is what's given to her oh
[1:09:42] she's taught how to pray brother she's
[1:09:44] taught how to worship she's taught how
[1:09:46] to praise God and she
[1:09:49] she gets it poured in there notice it's
[1:09:51] a whole year
[1:09:53] a whole year
[1:09:55] the Bible calls that a time time and
[1:09:57] times and times and Seasons so she gets
[1:09:59] a whole year of sanctification now mine
[1:10:01] lasted longer than one year but you
[1:10:04] understand the time Hallelujah
[1:10:06] also this meant I like this the brother
[1:10:09] brought this up also 12 months meant it
[1:10:12] proved she had no other man's seed right
[1:10:15] could have she'd have known another man
[1:10:17] it would have manifested by there by
[1:10:19] that time so I love it this this woman
[1:10:22] she has no other life except the King's
[1:10:25] life praise God Amen that's what we got
[1:10:28] in the soul praise God the Bible said
[1:10:30] we're sealed to the king we're sealed to
[1:10:32] his sea unto the day of our Redemption
[1:10:34] no other life just eternal life the life
[1:10:37] of Christ hallelujah amen amen thank God
[1:10:41] Hallelujah for sealing your love into me
[1:10:43] praise God Amen in other words thank you
[1:10:46] Lord for protecting the womb of my soul
[1:10:48] hallelujah amen until the Holy Ghost
[1:10:50] could come and seal it hallelujah amen
[1:10:53] that's good I like that my name is
[1:10:57] yeah sanctify means to purify so to me
[1:11:00] that's a beautiful type
[1:11:03] of Esther having to go through
[1:11:04] sanctification
[1:11:06] Hallelujah so oil is the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:09] sanctification odors prayers worship
[1:11:12] before God and church doesn't that
[1:11:14] purify you
[1:11:16] who feels more pure when you leave out
[1:11:17] of church and you've danced or you've
[1:11:19] shouted or you've cried or you've begged
[1:11:21] God at the altar or you worship who
[1:11:22] feels more pure right here so did Esther
[1:11:26] that's the sweet owners
[1:11:28] you were given sweet or odors you're
[1:11:30] given a way to worship God and it
[1:11:33] purifies you right

[1:14:17] Esther only a Adorn adorned herself with
[1:14:20] haggy eyes requirements and nothing more
[1:14:22] now we've heard this preach many times
[1:14:23] but just bear with me
[1:14:24] hege I was a king's Chamberlain and The
[1:14:27] Keeper of the women and type
[1:14:28] sanctification the second work of Grace
[1:14:30] and see we don't need anything from the
[1:14:32] world added to our walk with God
[1:14:36] now for us it's going to be
[1:14:38] um you know worldly music we don't need
[1:14:40] that we don't need makeup we don't need
[1:14:41] high heels
[1:14:43] right
[1:14:46] for a Temptation for men is we don't
[1:14:48] need big muscles
[1:14:50] you don't have to have big muscles to
[1:14:52] get the Holy Ghost
[1:14:54] right you don't have to have it so
[1:14:55] you're just Temptations
[1:14:57] you don't have to have a Mercedes-Benz
[1:14:59] now okay
[1:15:00] you have to go to college you get a
[1:15:01] four-year degree to know you God loves
[1:15:04] you you don't do that that's not part of
[1:15:05] sanctification right it's whatever the
[1:15:07] Holy Ghost requires and God's
[1:15:09] requirement is in the word of God praise
[1:15:10] God Amen
[1:15:11] amen nothing nothing added to it like I
[1:15:14] made a video I had uh is there a good
[1:15:15] text to me yesterday
[1:15:17] and I sent her the video I made a video
[1:15:19] about getting the Holy Ghost and you
[1:15:21] just it's very simple all you do is
[1:15:22] daily pray and Obey that's all you got
[1:15:25] it I'm sorry daily read pray and Obey
[1:15:27] just I made up a little rhyme it's that
[1:15:30] simple to get the Holy Ghost because the
[1:15:31] Bible says seek me first every day right
[1:15:34] right so daily read your Bible
[1:15:37] pray and Obey that's all I gotta do yes
[1:15:41] yes whoever hungers and thirsts at the
[1:15:43] Rises shall be filled praise God
[1:15:45] I even told zero I said brother brother
[1:15:47] amen knew the season of his holy ghost
[1:15:49] falling I didn't
[1:15:51] he knew it was coming and he said I'm
[1:15:53] not leaving the church so it's coming up
[1:15:55] that's Faith right there yes I was just
[1:15:58] married I was so happy I got my woman
[1:16:01] after my name aren't you Gladys Smith
[1:16:13] I didn't even know it was coming that
[1:16:15] day but that service was anointed the
[1:16:17] music and the preachings shouting you
[1:16:19] you know what the Holy Ghost is there
[1:16:20] praise God yes right I stood up and I
[1:16:23] saw that Vision I shouted I screamed I
[1:16:24] cried and I walked out there I was a new
[1:16:26] person I was full of the love of God
[1:16:29] Amen
[1:16:30] right I knew it no did that love leave
[1:16:33] in my mind yes I had to renew it yeah
[1:16:35] but I knew something happened there and
[1:16:36] the devil couldn't take that away from
[1:16:37] me that's right he still can't take it
[1:16:39] away from me
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:41] praise God
[1:16:45] so notice Esther lived by every word of
[1:16:48] haggai the second work of Grace
[1:16:50] in preparation for her marriage
[1:16:52] that's an hour already my goodness
[1:16:55] are you kidding me
[1:16:57] um
[1:16:57] I'd already read that one at the bottom
[1:17:00] and there's another application that she
[1:17:02] had to endure the test of time
[1:17:04] God wants to see that you'll sit through
[1:17:06] the entire time of purification and just
[1:17:09] take what he likes yes
[1:17:12] right
[1:17:13] like we like we looked at music you know
[1:17:15] I could use that
[1:17:17] it doesn't whatever I like it has to be
[1:17:19] what God likes if not I need to get get
[1:17:22] rid of what I like yes that's right
[1:17:24] that's right amen
[1:17:26] amen and church when I got the Holy
[1:17:27] Ghost I got rid of all my rock and roll
[1:17:29] like I told you I made a few mistakes
[1:17:31] I'll download a few songs I shouldn't
[1:17:32] have downloaded so I deleted them last
[1:17:33] week Ali
[1:17:34] disco and I hardly ever listen to him
[1:17:36] like I was telling brother amen I just
[1:17:38] make mistakes
[1:17:39] I got the Holy Ghost by just doing what
[1:17:42] Jesus liked right right but then when I
[1:17:44] make mistakes I got to go back thank God
[1:17:46] there's still purification hallelujah
[1:17:48] thank God
[1:17:51] but we all got to go through the test of
[1:17:53] time we ought to go through that
[1:17:54] purification time
[1:17:57] and just remember I've got favor
[1:17:59] remember she was treated better than
[1:18:01] everybody else during sanctification
[1:18:02] that's right yeah she was given all the
[1:18:05] secrets of the word of God this is what
[1:18:07] God likes God doesn't like this God
[1:18:09] don't like denominational ideas you
[1:18:10] don't like Creeds and bylaws he just
[1:18:11] likes this Bible right here
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:16] that's how you get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:20] Bible a read uh pray obey sorry
[1:18:24] it's been a couple years since I made
[1:18:25] that video
[1:18:26] forgot that
[1:18:29] no that's important to see that by God's
[1:18:31] grace that this is what purification is
[1:18:34] it's oil it's sweet odors and there it
[1:18:36] is sweet orders prayers
[1:18:37] pray worship God
[1:18:40] Hallelujah give God the glory
[1:18:42] all right
[1:18:44] now these are scriptures on
[1:18:46] sanctification you're Sanctified by what
[1:18:48] you're Washed by the spirit of God so
[1:18:50] just take picture in your mind God just
[1:18:52] washed me over these this time until I
[1:18:54] get the Holy Ghost I'm just being washed
[1:18:55] this whole time I'm getting cleaner all
[1:18:57] the time amen every service I'm getting
[1:19:00] cleaner even every service I'm getting
[1:19:01] closer to God hallelujah amen
[1:19:05] like I said have prayer meeting that's
[1:19:07] what I have prayer meetings in your own
[1:19:08] house with just you and God just to
[1:19:10] invite God to a prayer meeting yes
[1:19:12] that's right I was expecting angels to
[1:19:14] come never seen them but I know there's
[1:19:16] an angel that surrounds us right amen
[1:19:18] you fear God there's an angel there amen
[1:19:20] right invite God to the prayer meeting
[1:19:22] Hallelujah
[1:19:24] God wants us to be Sanctified holy or
[1:19:27] completely and God has chosen us he's
[1:19:30] chosen us to be saved because we want to
[1:19:33] be purified through sanctification
[1:19:35] through purification of the spirit and
[1:19:36] belief for the truth that's why God
[1:19:38] chose you he knew you let him sanctify
[1:19:40] you and he knew you wouldn't believe
[1:19:41] fathers and holy ghost or three persons
[1:19:44] yeah or Ebay to Apple or you can marry
[1:19:47] and divorce as many times as you want he
[1:19:48] knew you'd believe the truth that's why
[1:19:50] he chose you praise God
[1:19:52] Hallelujah
[1:19:54] remember all those other Christians
[1:19:55] Christians are going to unite with the
[1:19:56] Pope
[1:19:58] right who's the most wicked of all
[1:20:00] that's right
[1:20:02] that's why they get deceived they get
[1:20:04] deceived because they love unrighteous
[1:20:06] he lets them keep sinning
[1:20:08] he lets them live a worldly life but
[1:20:10] heck yeah I don't let you do that
[1:20:11] hanging out it tells you the secrets
[1:20:13] here's how you please Xerxes here's how
[1:20:15] you please the king just do what I tell
[1:20:17] you to do praise God amen amen
[1:20:21] now the wedding day is Esther 2 16-17
[1:20:24] and we read that for our text that's the
[1:20:26] wedding day
[1:20:29] yes
[1:20:33] now
[1:20:34] yeah I just want to read verse 14 at the
[1:20:36] bottom of the Bible said she came in
[1:20:38] unto the king no more except the king
[1:20:39] delighted her and that she was called by
[1:20:41] name
[1:20:43] so teachers this proves if we're the
[1:20:45] bride of Christ he Delights in our
[1:20:47] prayers
[1:20:48] Jesus didn't put us away right we have
[1:20:51] been blasting the holy ghost or
[1:20:53] something like that we are part of the
[1:20:55] Bride he Delights in our worship he
[1:20:57] loves when we pray he loves when we come
[1:20:59] to church he loves to hear our voice in
[1:21:01] the morning praise God Amen
[1:21:03] he Delights in us that's what Psalm says
[1:21:06] God Delight remember Psalms 149 and 150
[1:21:08] God Delights in the timbrel god Delights
[1:21:11] in the dance Hallelujah he Delights in
[1:21:13] the worship
[1:21:15] and this is why don't put us away
[1:21:16] because he Delights in our worship and
[1:21:18] we Delight to worship him praise God
[1:21:19] Amen amen we both have joy we both have
[1:21:22] Delight in the presence of Christ amen
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:26] so the wedding night is the type of the
[1:21:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:32] I love this as soon as she started
[1:21:34] walking the in the courts everybody
[1:21:35] looked on her and had favor on her
[1:21:38] Hallelujah and that awesome God God says
[1:21:41] all the angels to give us favor praise
[1:21:42] God all the Heavenly Angels favor us
[1:21:46] they do Hallelujah they do they give us
[1:21:49] protection the Bible said they're
[1:21:50] ministering Spirits sent to The Heirs of
[1:21:52] Salvation praise God
[1:21:54] if you've ever been helped
[1:21:55] supernaturally that angel gave you favor
[1:21:58] amen that's right
[1:22:00] now no notice she went in uh she went
[1:22:03] into
[1:22:04] the king in verse 16 on the 10th day of
[1:22:07] the seventh year that sounds familiar so
[1:22:10] the brother used that 10-7 as Revelation
[1:22:12] 10 7.
[1:22:14] now I'll go with you a little bit on
[1:22:15] that one because the mystery of God is
[1:22:18] finished right and what's one of the
[1:22:19] Mysteries it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:22:20] glory
[1:22:22] right so the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:23] is part of the mystery that's mentioned
[1:22:25] the Mysteries are all mentioned of
[1:22:27] course all the mysteries in Revelation
[1:22:28] 10 verse 7.
[1:22:31] but I personally believe it better fits
[1:22:33] to the damn atonement because the day of
[1:22:35] atonement took place on the 10th day of
[1:22:38] the seventh month
[1:22:39] Hallelujah and what's the day of
[1:22:41] atonement it was a day when all the sins
[1:22:43] of the nation were washed away right
[1:22:46] imagine that you can think of all all
[1:22:48] the sins from the past 365 days now
[1:22:51] let's not let the devil bring them all
[1:22:52] up but think of all the sins you've done
[1:22:54] the last three try to think about the
[1:22:56] number at least 365 right
[1:22:59] all those sins but you can come to that
[1:23:01] church service and if you stayed all the
[1:23:03] way and if you believe you could walk on
[1:23:05] that church service and know
[1:23:06] everything's forgiven I have a clean
[1:23:08] slate I'm walking fresh praise God and
[1:23:11] that's what the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:12] Ghost is for your soul
[1:23:15] your soul never stand in the birthplace
[1:23:17] all the sins are gone all the unbelief
[1:23:19] is gone and now you're just forgiven and
[1:23:22] now your slate is clean Hallelujah now
[1:23:24] you have the life of God and there's no
[1:23:26] charges against you praise God Amen
[1:23:32] Hallelujah that makes me happy
[1:23:36] thank you Jesus wherefore my brethren
[1:23:39] you also become dead to the law by the
[1:23:41] body of Christ that you should be
[1:23:42] married to another even to him who's
[1:23:43] raised from the dead that we should
[1:23:45] bring forth fruit unto God
[1:23:49] all right
[1:23:51] now
[1:23:53] Esther's wedding night types the
[1:23:54] Christians Born Again experience First
[1:23:56] Peter 1 23 being born again not a
[1:23:58] corruptible seed but of the encryptal by
[1:24:00] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:24:03] forever
[1:24:04] Hallelujah so again we see New Birth
[1:24:07] seed
[1:24:09] see Born Again New Birth C so a wedding
[1:24:12] night receive seed that's where we get
[1:24:14] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost also
[1:24:17] a Song of Solomon Solomon went to the
[1:24:19] shulamite for the wedding night in
[1:24:21] chapter 4 verse 16 and chapter 5 verse
[1:24:23] 1. he said he went into my garden and
[1:24:25] wasn't Eva Garden
[1:24:27] right every woman's a garden right
[1:24:29] so it goes into the garden you can see
[1:24:31] the uh the type there
[1:24:34] now ask her secret identity I already
[1:24:36] went through this already but Christians
[1:24:37] are the spiritual Jews and the soul
[1:24:39] now this is not replacement Theory just
[1:24:42] so you know there's a lot of churches
[1:24:43] not in the message but denominations
[1:24:45] that say that they understand Israel's
[1:24:47] divorce but they think God is not going
[1:24:49] to bring her back
[1:24:51] and so they they actually teach we are
[1:24:53] the spiritual Israel and the natural
[1:24:55] Israel is not coming back now that's the
[1:24:57] sin to do that that's wrong to do that
[1:25:00] all you got to do is read Romans chapter
[1:25:01] 11 right that's all you got to do and
[1:25:02] listen to the fifth seal if they just
[1:25:04] did that they would know God is going to
[1:25:07] bring her back God's going to graft her
[1:25:08] back in it yes God's going to take off
[1:25:10] the blinders God's gonna take out the
[1:25:12] blindfold and she's going to see that
[1:25:14] Jesus they got to read Zechariah 2 amen
[1:25:16] that the nation reborn in one day a
[1:25:19] fountain will be opened in the House of
[1:25:20] David hallelujah amen amen
[1:25:23] so just just say no church we are not
[1:25:25] replacement theology we're a replacement
[1:25:28] Theory
[1:25:29] we are the Gentile bride right not the
[1:25:33] Old Testament bride where the Gentile
[1:25:34] and New Testament bride
[1:25:36] and that's because of Romans 2 29 the
[1:25:39] Bible said we're spiritual Jews we have
[1:25:41] the circumcision not necessarily the
[1:25:43] flesh but it's a circumcision of the
[1:25:45] Soul
[1:25:47] the soul right the spirit the Bible says
[1:25:49] all right
[1:25:51] so that's your secret identity right
[1:25:53] everybody thought she's Gentile Gentile
[1:25:54] everybody says we're Gentile right we
[1:25:56] know we're Gentile but really we're
[1:25:57] spiritual Jews because we have the
[1:25:59] circumcision of the Soul
[1:26:01] all right although she was Jewish her
[1:26:03] Israeli identity was at first unknown to
[1:26:05] the king and all shushan in other words
[1:26:06] everyone considered her a virgin Gentile
[1:26:08] Esther never even lived a day in
[1:26:10] Jerusalem these facts about Esther type
[1:26:12] today's spiritual virgin the bride
[1:26:15] Church he's Jew and Gentile but inwardly
[1:26:17] she's a spiritual Jew her heart has been
[1:26:20] circumcised by the Holy Ghost now see
[1:26:22] let me just stop there remember
[1:26:23] circumcision is a permanent surgery
[1:26:25] right that's why I was telling a brother
[1:26:28] uh Thursday night at the meeting I said
[1:26:30] you can be permanently done with this
[1:26:31] sin that you're battling
[1:26:33] because that's what circumcision is
[1:26:37] like I'm permanently done
[1:26:39] with the filthy magazines and movies
[1:26:41] permanently done
[1:26:43] with chewing tobacco and smoking
[1:26:44] permanently right
[1:26:46] right and I don't really want to name
[1:26:47] this apparently done with the sports
[1:26:49] idolatry see there's got to be a
[1:26:51] circumcision so you stay with Christ
[1:26:53] right you stay faithful like Joshua you
[1:26:56] stay faithful to the ark and pretty soon
[1:26:57] you'll cross over Jordan and there'll be
[1:26:59] a circumcision ceremony praise God but
[1:27:02] in Joshua represents the one the same
[1:27:04] thing praise God Amen you crossed over
[1:27:06] you're circumcised these habits gonna
[1:27:08] race and I told the brother I said you
[1:27:09] got Authority by the word of God to say
[1:27:11] Satan I cast you out and you can never
[1:27:13] enter again praise God amen amen that's
[1:27:17] exactly right praise God we have that
[1:27:19] Authority that's the word of God amen
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:23] Hallelujah
[1:27:25] that's a great scripture to use you have
[1:27:27] that Authority and you just wait for
[1:27:29] God's timing to use it praise God or
[1:27:31] like whatever answer or you can use it
[1:27:32] until it happens
[1:27:33] brother I said even if you don't feel
[1:27:35] your healing just say I'm Healed until
[1:27:37] the Revelation comes right amen
[1:27:40] right it's better to be positive than
[1:27:41] negative right right better be positive
[1:27:43] than wondering and scared or you know
[1:27:44] nervous right that's right it's a good
[1:27:46] idea and amen
[1:27:48] now there's some unknown types like
[1:27:51] Mordecai Saves The King's life so how
[1:27:53] did the Old Testament law say Jesus life
[1:27:55] during the church ages yes there are
[1:27:56] some types that I just don't know how to
[1:27:58] type them out the other side is how did
[1:28:00] Brothers save Jesus life if Mordecai
[1:28:02] saved the King's life how did Brother
[1:28:03] Adam say Jesus life and brother Adams
[1:28:05] indictment sermon he said Jesus was
[1:28:07] crucified afresh
[1:28:10] so see it's interesting like how do you
[1:28:12] type this out I don't know
[1:28:14] I'm just telling you I can only type
[1:28:15] certain things
[1:28:17] Mordecai refused about a Haman and that
[1:28:20] lead to led to the decree to kill all
[1:28:22] the Jews so maybe this is the Jew
[1:28:24] that you send representing the Polish
[1:28:26] virgins but also the virgins inside the
[1:28:28] reversion inside the palace that
[1:28:30] represent the foolish virgins
[1:28:32] as they are not Esther the bride so
[1:28:34] again I don't know I don't know how all
[1:28:35] these types of the story work
[1:28:39] Mordecai and the Jews fasted and mourned
[1:28:42] and it moves as sort of fast and pray
[1:28:44] for three days
[1:28:46] now Church the way I can see this this
[1:28:48] could be
[1:28:49] you know the Bible said all nations are
[1:28:51] going to come against Israel at the end
[1:28:52] time how many know that right
[1:28:55] right and during the tribulation all the
[1:28:56] armies will actually gather I appreciate
[1:28:58] it months ago right and showed you in
[1:29:00] Ezekiel 38 and 39 how all the nations
[1:29:02] are going to come against Israel
[1:29:06] so this this could mean before the
[1:29:08] rapture we start seeing the Jews even
[1:29:10] more uh attacked or abused and so we'd
[1:29:14] have to intercede for them we have to
[1:29:15] pray for them
[1:29:17] right it could mean that
[1:29:20] but I've always I've always used it you
[1:29:22] know before the rapture we got to have
[1:29:23] more fasting and praying
[1:29:26] that's what I'm saying that's right we
[1:29:28] gotta have some fasting and pray
[1:29:30] right because that that's what the Bible
[1:29:32] said uh in Isaiah 58 that's what brings
[1:29:34] healthier about you want to get healthy
[1:29:36] fast
[1:29:37] amen you want to be a blessing to
[1:29:39] somebody fast skip a meal go go serve
[1:29:41] somebody
[1:29:42] all right go do something for somebody
[1:29:43] else and God will bless you
[1:29:45] Hallelujah uh in some cases you want to
[1:29:48] be healed gotta pass yeah
[1:29:50] yeah right if we want to see somebody
[1:29:51] else here we gotta fast for them
[1:29:54] that's right
[1:29:56] and of course remember there's a lot of
[1:29:57] incomplete ties like Joseph 30 pieces uh
[1:30:00] and uh Jesus was sold out I'm sorry
[1:30:03] Jesus was sold out for 30 pieces Joseph
[1:30:05] was 20 pieces I got a typho there and
[1:30:08] then Sodom was remembered was destroyed
[1:30:10] before Isaac's birth or before the
[1:30:12] rapture so there's some unknown types in
[1:30:14] here okay now heyman's plot of laying
[1:30:17] down the physical mark of the beast this
[1:30:19] is the type of the USA BEAST's decree to
[1:30:21] kill all who don't receive the mark of
[1:30:22] the beast
[1:30:23] now to me this is a very beautiful type
[1:30:25] I'm going to read this out of uh
[1:30:27] Revelation 13. let's remember this
[1:30:30] Revelation 13 16-17
[1:30:40] now since we're Revelation 13 let me
[1:30:42] show you this verse just see how people
[1:30:43] can misinterpret
[1:30:45] oh yeah go to Revelation 13 3 and I saw
[1:30:47] one of the heads as it were wounded to
[1:30:50] death and his deadly wound was healed
[1:30:51] and all the world wandered after the
[1:30:52] Beast
[1:30:54] now this is Imperial Rome turning into
[1:30:57] papal Rome
[1:30:58] around 500
[1:31:01] 500 A.D
[1:31:04] but this verse was used by a famous
[1:31:06] preacher not the message to say that
[1:31:08] Satan can heal
[1:31:10] because the wound of the Beast was
[1:31:12] healed
[1:31:13] I said no sir so you gotta need to go
[1:31:16] read Matthew chapter 12. I'll teach it
[1:31:18] to the kids here tonight and it'll be a
[1:31:19] good review for the adults Jesus said
[1:31:21] Satan cannot cast out Satan
[1:31:24] The Impossible Satan cannot heal I'll
[1:31:27] unlock some of the secrets here tonight
[1:31:28] my guys Grace wink wink
[1:31:31] there's some really good scriptures I
[1:31:32] never knew I preached him on Thursday
[1:31:34] night Malik I was there there's some
[1:31:35] scriptures I've never really seen before
[1:31:36] but go down to verse 16 now 16 brother
[1:31:39] man uses verse to say the bride will be
[1:31:42] forced to stop preaching before the
[1:31:44] rapture
[1:31:46] that was in pick up your pen and write
[1:31:47] from spoken word Original Seed 1962. I
[1:31:50] know it's a little bit of review but
[1:31:51] thank you for bear with me verse 16. and
[1:31:53] he causes all both small and great rich
[1:31:55] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[1:31:57] in their right hand or their foreheads
[1:31:59] so that's everybody
[1:32:00] right and you saw how bind
[1:32:02] Administration is moving towards
[1:32:03] electronic currency right saw that
[1:32:05] that's picking up steam they got to be
[1:32:07] able to wait to shut down all your money
[1:32:09] think about that you we wouldn't be able
[1:32:11] to go to the store and buy something
[1:32:13] they wouldn't take our cards wouldn't
[1:32:15] take our cash
[1:32:17] that's really something
[1:32:19] we don't know how it's going to work out
[1:32:21] right we know the mark of the beast is
[1:32:23] actually a spiritual Mark first when
[1:32:25] someone turns out the Holy Ghost it's
[1:32:26] called the reprobate mind but then it's
[1:32:28] begun to come into a natural Mark as
[1:32:30] well yes or you can take the mark of his
[1:32:33] name or the number of his name there's
[1:32:34] different ways to take the mark of the
[1:32:36] beast that's in the book I wrote there's
[1:32:37] different ways to take a mark of the
[1:32:38] piece just going along with the Beast
[1:32:40] and not speaking against it that's
[1:32:41] taking the mark of the beast right
[1:32:42] there's lots of there's there's I think
[1:32:44] three different ways to take the mark of
[1:32:45] the beast according to the scripture
[1:32:48] verse 17 and that no man might not by
[1:32:51] herself say that he had the mark yeah
[1:32:52] here's the mark the Mark or the name
[1:32:54] the Pope
[1:32:56] or the number 666 because that day
[1:32:59] instead of the son of God
[1:33:02] so there's three three different ways
[1:33:03] they can take the mark of the beast
[1:33:05] here's wisdom let him that have to
[1:33:07] understand and count the number of the
[1:33:08] Beast for it is the number of a man and
[1:33:10] his number is 603 score and six
[1:33:13] right it's a vicarious Philly I die I
[1:33:16] can never say it the right way but maybe
[1:33:18] one day I'll get that right
[1:33:20] but it's a number that adds up to the
[1:33:22] Pope the instead of the Son of God in
[1:33:24] the place of the Son of God it's the
[1:33:26] Pope's uh title
[1:33:28] the Vicar of Christ there is the Vicar
[1:33:29] of Christ he's called the Vicar of
[1:33:31] Christ
[1:33:32] and he's in place of Christ
[1:33:34] okay so we can clearly see uh the
[1:33:36] Gentile bride will come to a time where
[1:33:39] she could be killed for what she
[1:33:40] believes she can be killed for her
[1:33:42] Heritage amen
[1:33:45] for her DNA praise God hallelujah our
[1:33:48] spiritual DNA is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] heyman's bought to kill the Jews
[1:33:54] including Mordecai Esther types the very
[1:33:55] end of the times of the Gentiles this is
[1:33:57] when the beasts of the Earth in
[1:33:58] Revelation 13 plaster kill both small
[1:34:01] and great rich and poor abandon free who
[1:34:02] do not take his Antichrist mark
[1:34:04] now his theme remember the theme of the
[1:34:06] Antichrist is peace and safety what do
[1:34:08] we have in a lot of cities today that
[1:34:10] are liberal a lot of crime right New
[1:34:13] York uh Cleveland is one of the worst
[1:34:15] places to be that's one of the highest
[1:34:17] murder rates I think it's in the top
[1:34:18] five in the nation Cleveland it's just
[1:34:19] 40 40 minutes north of us
[1:34:22] since all this uh coveted stuff happened
[1:34:24] and the Democratic leaders that don't go
[1:34:27] to Cleveland
[1:34:28] but I mean you go to Cleveland just pray
[1:34:29] before you go
[1:34:31] I want to be hanging around there in the
[1:34:32] wrong wrong uh alleys at night time
[1:34:35] don't go there night time
[1:34:38] but what's he gonna say I'm gonna give
[1:34:40] you peace I'm Gonna Give You safety
[1:34:41] while outlawing true Christianity
[1:34:43] insulting unionized I'm sorry and
[1:34:45] instituting unionized religion
[1:34:48] just as haman's plot was spoiled by
[1:34:50] Esther's prayerful humble intercessions
[1:34:52] so will the Beast plot be foiled by the
[1:34:55] bride Church's prayers
[1:34:58] a church and brother Branham said the
[1:35:00] Rapture will be an easy thing
[1:35:03] if Enoch walked off this Earth under the
[1:35:06] blood of bulls and goats if Elijah
[1:35:08] jumped on a chair brother amen right
[1:35:11] and the elect cannot be deceived I
[1:35:13] believe will be fully ready for the
[1:35:15] Rapture it won't be a hard thing I
[1:35:17] believe even easy thing praise God
[1:35:19] now we don't know what we'll endure
[1:35:21] during the squeeze but look at this we
[1:35:24] know it's going to happen they're going
[1:35:25] to Outlaw our form of Christianity
[1:35:27] they're going to stop us from preaching
[1:35:29] yeah we will know the time and season I
[1:35:32] believe that squeeze will push us into
[1:35:34] rapturing Faith praise God Amen
[1:35:36] we have so many details
[1:35:39] Glory brother Rams are the seven CEOs
[1:35:41] from Genesis to Revelation now let me
[1:35:42] just explain that in other words we can
[1:35:44] look at Esther and we can see the
[1:35:46] seventh seal the day and hour of the
[1:35:48] rapture we can see the squeeze we can
[1:35:50] see the coming Lord in Enon praise God
[1:35:52] we can see it there in Genesis praise
[1:35:54] God
[1:35:55] we get all these little Clues Glory we
[1:35:57] get it in Daniel with the three Hebrew
[1:35:59] children music might be involved right
[1:36:01] right
[1:36:03] right that is such an amazing statement
[1:36:06] brother and me the seventh seal the
[1:36:08] coming Lord is from Genesis to
[1:36:09] revelation
[1:36:12] we're given so many Clues we cannot be
[1:36:14] deceived by Satan hallelujah praise God
[1:36:16] though he gets more deceptive we get
[1:36:19] more truth praise God
[1:36:21] Hallelujah
[1:36:23] I feel like it just gets unfolded more
[1:36:26] and more clearly every year we're in
[1:36:27] this thing
[1:36:30] because now we know it's not Russia
[1:36:31] that's going to be the Rapture right
[1:36:32] last year last year the preachers
[1:36:34] thought oh it's Russia and Ukraine war
[1:36:35] that's the sign of the rapture
[1:36:37] no other man was still right yeah right
[1:36:40] Hallelujah
[1:36:41] they had no quote for that they had a
[1:36:43] quote they misunderstood
[1:36:45] but they didn't have the quotes like we
[1:36:46] got quotes right no no I love those
[1:36:48] Brothers I believe they're filled with
[1:36:49] Holy Ghost I believe they're saved I
[1:36:50] believe they're called The Rapture I
[1:36:51] believe they're Zealand ain't up their
[1:36:53] wisdom just like mine sometimes
[1:36:55] sometimes my Zeal is up my wisdom
[1:36:58] and I look there wasn't a lot of amens
[1:36:59] all that thank you thank you
[1:37:01] because you know it was true but you
[1:37:03] didn't want to feel embarrassed no one
[1:37:04] embarrass me
[1:37:06] Hallelujah he'll Outlaw true
[1:37:09] Christianity
[1:37:10] but look Satan's plot to put down the
[1:37:13] mark of the beast gets spoiled by
[1:37:15] Esther's prayerful humble intercession
[1:37:18] so will the Beast soul of the Pope's
[1:37:20] plot be foiled by the bride church amen
[1:37:24] praise God hallelujah
[1:37:27] see we're gonna have to and I love this
[1:37:29] we're going to have to go boldly before
[1:37:32] the king
[1:37:33] Hallelujah we have to like like the
[1:37:36] Bible said she fast and prayed she got
[1:37:38] on her most Royal garments
[1:37:40] in other words she was living really
[1:37:41] close to God
[1:37:42] Hallelujah
[1:37:44] the Bible says put you on the Lord Jesus
[1:37:46] Christ
[1:37:48] that you will not make uh you would not
[1:37:51] make uh something for the flesh you want
[1:37:53] to make opportunity for the flesh to sin
[1:37:55] what was it
[1:37:56] provision for the flesh thank you yes
[1:37:59] Hallelujah
[1:38:01] so we're giving all these Bible Clues
[1:38:03] we're giving all these types and shadows
[1:38:04] surely we'll be ready surely we'll see a
[1:38:07] praise God surely God will not leave his
[1:38:09] people without a witness Hallelujah he's
[1:38:11] given us so many witnesses down to these
[1:38:13] scriptures through these sermons
[1:38:15] Hallelujah
[1:38:17] so many
[1:38:20] all right I'm almost done
[1:38:22] let me see how long
[1:38:25] wow okay all right I'll go faster some
[1:38:28] of this is a lot of this is reviewed now
[1:38:30] notice Haman gets
[1:38:35] I also thought about this that was a
[1:38:37] good type when Haman became second in
[1:38:39] command that's a lot like how Satan had
[1:38:41] his power the prince of the air
[1:38:44] over this Earthly Kingdom right
[1:38:47] and he got he got the king's Ring he got
[1:38:50] he gets permission to do things
[1:38:52] did he not get permission to attack job
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:56] did he not right
[1:38:58] but he's got to be taken down and
[1:38:59] someone else has to get that permissions
[1:39:01] I don't know about that one I don't know
[1:39:03] the type there
[1:39:06] but remember God recommended job be
[1:39:08] tested
[1:39:10] you know why because God needed some
[1:39:11] Modern Day jokes to be encouraged now
[1:39:16] is their health God needed God need a
[1:39:19] joke lose his health to encourage us
[1:39:20] today when we get sick right or God
[1:39:23] forbid we should lose loved ones in
[1:39:25] accidents
[1:39:27] God forbid
[1:39:28] but God needed a job to go through that
[1:39:30] so we could overcome as well
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:32] God said go ahead do it but don't touch
[1:39:35] his life
[1:39:36] the Bible said we're all given tests but
[1:39:38] we'll always be able to overcome every
[1:39:40] single one that we go through amen
[1:39:44] the Bible says the Bible says you can
[1:39:46] endure any tests because God won't give
[1:39:48] you a difficult test that you can't
[1:39:49] handle and then he says flee from
[1:39:51] idolatry
[1:39:53] in other words don't run into the
[1:39:55] Temptations don't put yourself in a bad
[1:39:57] situation run from Idols in your life
[1:40:00] man then right
[1:40:03] because that would be that would be a
[1:40:04] test that we pull ourselves into right
[1:40:08] that's exactly right we're gonna put
[1:40:09] Idols in our lives and we we give things
[1:40:11] too much attention or praise more than
[1:40:12] the Lord Jesus Christ we're all guilty
[1:40:14] but we all get forgiven by God's grace
[1:40:25] to test the bride the whole world
[1:40:29] Esther A.A says the king's Proclamation
[1:40:31] sealed with his ring is irreversible
[1:40:34] But First Corinthians 10 13 promises God
[1:40:36] won't give us something we can't handle
[1:40:38] why because God's love is shed abroad in
[1:40:40] our hearts by the Holy Ghost it's a seal
[1:40:42] unto the day of your Redemption amen
[1:40:44] remember Church the whole purpose of
[1:40:45] this
[1:40:46] the whole purpose of
[1:40:48] [Applause]
[1:40:50] other kind Esther the whole purpose was
[1:40:52] so that Esther would realize she was
[1:40:54] called to be Bride for such a time as
[1:40:57] this
[1:40:58] the whole purpose of this is so a little
[1:41:01] virgin woman formerly an orphan formerly
[1:41:04] outside of the palace Hallelujah she
[1:41:06] would know her position she would go
[1:41:08] before the king and she'd find favor in
[1:41:10] the sight of the king hallelujah amen
[1:41:13] that's what it was all about
[1:41:14] so she would know she was called to
[1:41:17] serve God for this time and season
[1:41:20] that's always that's the whole point of
[1:41:22] that
[1:41:23] all that God was Never Scared all of my
[1:41:25] people are going to die I was never
[1:41:26] scared because he had a woman there he
[1:41:28] had a bride there who was chosen to
[1:41:30] overcome
[1:41:32] Glory praise God hallelujah oh it's a
[1:41:35] beautiful type
[1:41:37] that's their fasting is a type of us
[1:41:39] fasting in the squeeze perhaps
[1:41:42] and it closed us with Christ's
[1:41:44] righteousness kind of already going over
[1:41:46] that one
[1:41:47] she put on a royal apparel stood before
[1:41:49] the king it could have cost her life
[1:41:51] she's willing to die to save her people
[1:41:53] so here's where we see maybe the squeeze
[1:41:55] has some some aspect where we we might
[1:41:57] be close to death because Esther
[1:42:00] could have died
[1:42:02] right
[1:42:03] the law the law said you can't come at
[1:42:05] this time
[1:42:06] right the law said you can't come unless
[1:42:08] you're summoned now that's totally
[1:42:09] different from the New Testament because
[1:42:11] the Bible tells us to come boldly before
[1:42:13] the throne of grace yes amen right so
[1:42:15] see some of these types don't work so
[1:42:17] maybe that law was a type of legalism or
[1:42:19] maybe it was just a spirit of fear or
[1:42:20] something
[1:42:22] in other words Church in our darkest
[1:42:24] moments if God should allow us to live
[1:42:25] in dark moments we know we've only got
[1:42:27] one thing we can do seek God pray fast
[1:42:30] and cry out to our King praise God right
[1:42:34] cry out to our husband that's our only
[1:42:36] step
[1:42:37] there's life or death will stand with
[1:42:40] the truth life or death we're standing
[1:42:41] with Christ Hallelujah
[1:42:43] amen amen it's a beautiful type
[1:42:46] she knew she was ordained for this the
[1:42:48] people that go in the Rapture they're
[1:42:50] going to be born for that
[1:42:52] anybody can say I'm going to Rapture but
[1:42:54] let's see who lives to actually take the
[1:42:56] Rapture yes let's see who actually and
[1:42:58] then lives a Godly life all the way up
[1:43:00] to it
[1:43:02] right like I told you Joseph Coleman he
[1:43:03] told all his people that he he'd get the
[1:43:05] revelation of the Thunders and then that
[1:43:07] would be rapturing faith when I look at
[1:43:08] their church now
[1:43:10] it's all broken up it's proven to be
[1:43:12] wrong
[1:43:13] see let's wait let's live a Godly life
[1:43:15] let's Point people just to the Bible
[1:43:17] let's not add to the word let's not take
[1:43:19] from the word let's let's be a real
[1:43:21] queen for Christ and let's recognize
[1:43:23] that we're born for this time and season
[1:43:30] this has to be for us hallelujah
[1:43:33] oh it's beautiful
[1:43:35] this type's uh Esther going before the
[1:43:38] king types us prayerfully approaching
[1:43:41] Christ the Bible says we have access by
[1:43:42] faith into the grace wherein we stand
[1:43:46] okay I'm gonna skip that
[1:43:48] so Esther had political pressure right
[1:43:50] we have a squeeze coming on
[1:43:54] the political leaders in America will
[1:43:56] change the laws requiring all churches
[1:43:57] to join an evil ecumenical Union
[1:44:01] but we'll be kept from The Mark of the
[1:44:02] Beast the time was actually laid down
[1:44:04] will be kept from that because we've
[1:44:06] kept God's word and his patience
[1:44:09] now someone asked me on a text from
[1:44:10] South Carolina last night they said
[1:44:12] brother Jesse how can you prove uh Rome
[1:44:14] is behind all the world governments so I
[1:44:16] said I can't prove all of them
[1:44:18] um but I have a lot of Bible proof
[1:44:20] remember Daniel's Vision the feet were
[1:44:23] partly iron and partly clay
[1:44:25] right so that's the Antichrist spirit is
[1:44:28] in Rome and romance said it's Roman
[1:44:30] Catholicism and protestantism the Clay's
[1:44:32] Protestants
[1:44:33] so the satanic kingdom is standing on
[1:44:35] Catholics and Protestants right now
[1:44:37] think of that
[1:44:38] Satan is in the Catholics and
[1:44:40] Protestants that's his feet right now
[1:44:43] thankfully Jesus comes and smite that
[1:44:45] right right Armageddon The Rock The
[1:44:47] Stone comes the mountain smites it at
[1:44:48] the feet
[1:44:50] but right now
[1:44:51] the Antichrist spirit is standing by
[1:44:53] United Roman Catholicism
[1:44:56] and protestantism like I showed you
[1:44:58] and then I sent a brother I said did you
[1:45:00] realize the latest
[1:45:02] data on our Congressman in Washington DC
[1:45:05] 88 are Christians
[1:45:09] no I'm sorry maybe that
[1:45:12] no yeah 88 are Christians 59 are
[1:45:15] Protestant and then 29 are Catholics
[1:45:18] and I said well who is funding the war
[1:45:20] in Ukraine that's killed over half a
[1:45:22] million people already and that's just
[1:45:23] what they think they don't even know
[1:45:24] there's 3 000 men that are in hospitals
[1:45:27] they'll never fight again
[1:45:29] because they're so maimed who's
[1:45:31] responsible for those half million who
[1:45:33] funded this war America
[1:45:37] right
[1:45:40] and they all love the pope remember the
[1:45:42] pope came back in 2015.
[1:45:44] so there's proof right there
[1:45:46] there's some little proof that the the
[1:45:48] pope and the Catholic church is behind
[1:45:50] all of this
[1:45:52] okay now then you got to start studying
[1:45:54] who owns everything who owns all the
[1:45:56] banks we talk about that we gotta Dig
[1:45:58] Down
[1:45:59] they're probably Catholics right or some
[1:46:01] type of connection to the Catholic
[1:46:02] Church all right let me let me finish so
[1:46:05] the so Esther
[1:46:06] the king says what do you want Esther
[1:46:08] odia
[1:46:09] she said I want a banquet I want a wine
[1:46:11] banquet praise God and this types the
[1:46:14] former and latter rain Hallelujah
[1:46:17] and this will empower the bride to
[1:46:19] expose Satan in his cowardly plot and
[1:46:21] that's something
[1:46:22] these wine Banquets so us being with the
[1:46:26] King having wine amongst the king under
[1:46:28] the anointing of the Holy Ghost it will
[1:46:30] Empower us to finally expose Satan
[1:46:33] and notice at that second mango what is
[1:46:36] Satan do he tries to touch the bride now
[1:46:38] that might be a type of the squeeze too
[1:46:40] he actually lays a hold on her and once
[1:46:43] the king knew he walks back and says no
[1:46:44] you're not touching my wife
[1:46:46] isn't that something yeah so there might
[1:46:49] be some a little pressure the bride's
[1:46:51] got to go through she's in the grip of
[1:46:52] Haman
[1:46:54] but at the right time Jesus always comes
[1:46:56] it might be four days late but he's
[1:46:59] right on time hallelujah
[1:47:01] amen hallelujah
[1:47:04] and Jesus saves her right at the last
[1:47:06] moment
[1:47:08] isn't that beautiful
[1:47:10] you're familiar with that
[1:47:12] remember the scripture this is the
[1:47:14] rapture of scripture Paul quotes Isaiah
[1:47:16] 25 in First Corinthians 15. the
[1:47:20] mountains shall this mountain shall the
[1:47:22] Lord of hosts make unto all people a
[1:47:24] feast of bad things a feast of wines of
[1:47:27] the leaves of fat things full of marrow
[1:47:29] of wines of the leaves less or well
[1:47:31] refined and he will destroy in this
[1:47:33] mountain the face of the cover and cast
[1:47:34] over all people and the veil that is
[1:47:36] spread over all nations
[1:47:39] he will swallow of death and victory and
[1:47:42] the Lord God will wipe away tears from
[1:47:44] off all faces and the rebuke of his
[1:47:46] people shall he take away from off the
[1:47:48] Earth the Lord hath spoken it praise God
[1:47:51] look at this all the pressure on the
[1:47:53] bride all the Mind battles all the
[1:47:55] trials that have been on you they'll all
[1:47:57] be taken away when death is swallowed up
[1:47:59] in Victory when Haman is swallowed up by
[1:48:02] the king's order hallelujah amen it's
[1:48:04] all taken away praise God but how do we
[1:48:06] get there we've got to have a feast of
[1:48:07] wine we got to get more into the holy
[1:48:10] spirit amen I don't even want to be more
[1:48:13] in the holy spirit amen more free to
[1:48:15] worship more freedom Hallelujah
[1:48:17] more worship of God more sweet owners
[1:48:20] Hallelujah more oil more wine Hallelujah
[1:48:23] see we've got to draw closer to God much
[1:48:25] more as we see that day approaching
[1:48:27] praise God
[1:48:34] yeah some of these I'm just going to
[1:48:35] skip over because I'm trying I've
[1:48:36] already been an hour and a half
[1:48:39] okay
[1:48:40] all right
[1:48:41] a musicians can come I'm going to just
[1:48:43] do a couple more things musician's gonna
[1:48:45] come let's stand here
[1:48:48] so those are the ones I prepared the
[1:48:49] other day and these are the ones I
[1:48:50] prepared here on a different document
[1:48:51] from yesterday
[1:48:56] Hallelujah
[1:49:06] I want to go back and read Esther 217. I
[1:49:09] just want to remind you this
[1:49:10] pastor 217.
[1:49:14] and the King loved Esther above all the
[1:49:16] women
[1:49:17] and she obtained grace and favor in a
[1:49:19] sight more than all the virgins so that
[1:49:21] he set the Royal Crown upon her head
[1:49:23] and major Queen instead of bashti just
[1:49:26] remember the Bible calls you beloved
[1:49:29] you are God's special beloved people
[1:49:32] that doesn't mean he's going to do
[1:49:34] whatever you want I'm sure it has you
[1:49:36] heirs didn't do everything but uh Esther
[1:49:38] wanted to do
[1:49:39] right
[1:49:41] but she had access to him
[1:49:44] we have access to Christ amen he's not
[1:49:47] gonna do everything we want but we know
[1:49:48] we can approach him with the right
[1:49:50] garments on
[1:49:51] in his righteousness right
[1:49:53] right in the Holy Spirit
[1:49:55] so don't forget that you have favor
[1:49:57] above others
[1:49:59] you're the top choice of the king you're
[1:50:01] chosen elected ordained
[1:50:04] Hallelujah
[1:50:10] oh yes the last one if you would go to
[1:50:13] you got your Bible I was going to Psalm
[1:50:14] 138
[1:50:16] verse 2.
[1:50:20] I'm going to end with this here
[1:50:25] as you know Esther never mentions the
[1:50:27] name of Jehovah not even one time
[1:50:30] you've never just leave that up there
[1:50:31] just for a minute you never see Jehovah
[1:50:33] you never see God you never see Lord in
[1:50:35] there
[1:50:36] Yahweh is not in there Jehovah
[1:50:39] Adonai Lord nothing
[1:50:42] the name of God is missing and so some
[1:50:45] Scholars say well because God's name in
[1:50:47] there it's not in there well we're not
[1:50:49] going to use that book
[1:50:51] remember this is a gent a woman they
[1:50:53] thought was Gentile they become king I'm
[1:50:56] sorry become Queen and then she saves
[1:50:59] her people from from total death total
[1:51:01] annihilation
[1:51:04] now I want to read a couple reasons here
[1:51:06] there's a couple reasons her name may
[1:51:07] not be mentioned
[1:51:10] first Esther shows how God works behind
[1:51:14] the scenes
[1:51:16] right it doesn't record any Miracles
[1:51:18] we'd say
[1:51:20] no Supernatural like in the fire you
[1:51:23] know a fourth man in the fire or
[1:51:24] anything like that it just shows God
[1:51:25] working through common people behind the
[1:51:29] scenes isn't that what we are seriously
[1:51:30] aren't we a common people no don't don't
[1:51:33] say brother Jesse don't believe
[1:51:34] Americans I believe in miracles
[1:51:36] but this book in particular shows how
[1:51:38] God works through humble means of
[1:51:40] Believers right God does a miracle
[1:51:43] through their prayers
[1:51:45] right through their fasting God does
[1:51:47] miracles
[1:51:54] also it's possible God didn't mention uh
[1:51:58] his name because of the circumstances a
[1:52:01] lot of people believe Mordecai wrote
[1:52:02] this book and if he wrote it in Persia
[1:52:04] under Xerxes
[1:52:06] he would probably have to leave God's
[1:52:09] name out because of all the multiplicity
[1:52:11] of gods that were in Persia
[1:52:13] that might be one reason
[1:52:17] so he was trying to protect the people
[1:52:19] from any harm
[1:52:23] and then the another reason may be
[1:52:25] because uh we wanted to emphasize God's
[1:52:28] Providence
[1:52:31] right notice the Bible said if Esther
[1:52:33] remains silent in Esther 4 14
[1:52:36] Deliverance would come through another
[1:52:38] way
[1:52:40] right
[1:52:41] but Esther was called for such a time as
[1:52:43] this in other words Mordecai is showing
[1:52:45] God is Sovereign God's going to save us
[1:52:47] one way or the other
[1:52:48] so it shows God's Providence God already
[1:52:51] knew they were going to be brought out
[1:52:53] Hallelujah
[1:52:55] now here's the last reason here's the
[1:52:56] reason I think so I'm closing with this
[1:52:58] you've been a good audience here
[1:53:00] the reason I think
[1:53:02] there's no mention of God's name is
[1:53:04] because the name of God is in Esther's
[1:53:07] character
[1:53:09] in other words
[1:53:12] we see the word living out in Esther in
[1:53:15] her character she has become the word
[1:53:18] we see the word in Esther's life and
[1:53:21] what does the Bible say the Bible says
[1:53:22] I'll worship toward thy Holy Temple and
[1:53:24] praise thy name for thy loving kindness
[1:53:26] and for thy Truth for thou Hast
[1:53:27] magnified Thy word above all thy name
[1:53:32] now don't misunderstand this we always
[1:53:34] use the name of Jesus right
[1:53:36] but it's clear God if anyone looks
[1:53:39] around if people don't know the name of
[1:53:40] Jesus where they know they see it in
[1:53:42] creation they see God in creation that's
[1:53:44] what this is saying
[1:53:45] you we may not hear the name of Jesus
[1:53:48] people may not hear that Jesus actual
[1:53:49] name but they cannot deny his word
[1:53:52] because his word is everywhere right
[1:53:55] every the heavens declare the glory of
[1:53:58] the Lord
[1:53:59] and the firm and it declares this
[1:54:00] handiwork praise God
[1:54:02] amen so even though the name of Jehovah
[1:54:04] wasn't in Esther God's word was manifest
[1:54:06] through Esther
[1:54:08] hallelujah how many know the Bible says
[1:54:10] that Eve was flesh of Adam's flesh word
[1:54:13] of his word right what does brother
[1:54:14] random say we're flesh of his flesh
[1:54:16] we're bones is bone he says we're Spirit
[1:54:18] of Jesus spirit amen hallelujah that's
[1:54:21] about our history word of Prayer
[1:54:24] father we thank you for today Lord God
[1:54:25] we thank you for this word that we've
[1:54:26] heard today
[1:54:27] father I appreciate Lord God sensing
[1:54:30] your spirit Lord God thank you for
[1:54:31] emphasizing the points Lord that you
[1:54:33] want to emphasize I trust the people's
[1:54:35] heart
[1:54:36] receive the word of God that they needed
[1:54:38] for today Lord God hallelujah thank you
[1:54:40] God for this opportunity
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:43] lord it's such an encouragement Lord God
[1:54:45] to see Esther's testimony Lord God
[1:54:49] Hallelujah
[1:54:50] thank you that we're spiritual virgins
[1:54:53] by the blood of Jesus Christ thank you
[1:54:55] Lord that you're purifying us Lord God
[1:54:59] thank you Lord you're bringing us into
[1:55:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:03] and thank you God you're bringing us the
[1:55:04] Lord God to a place of Consecration and
[1:55:07] intercession with you that we will need
[1:55:10] in order to be delivered
[1:55:13] right at the time of the Rapture Lord
[1:55:15] good
[1:55:18] you so inspired your Prophet brother
[1:55:19] random to say the seventh seal is
[1:55:22] prophesied from Genesis to Revelation
[1:55:23] here we see it prophesied the unknown
[1:55:25] day in our Lord God
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:31] and Lord may you use us Lord God to draw
[1:55:33] Close to You Lord God draw us closer
[1:55:36] more than we've ever been before Lord
[1:55:37] God somehow I know you'll do it Lord God
[1:55:40] somehow I know it's possible Lord Jesus
[1:55:44] and like Esther help us to always expose
[1:55:46] the enemy at every one of his tricks
[1:55:50] Hallelujah
[1:55:53] let us remember we were called to be the
[1:55:55] bride of Christ for such a time as this
[1:55:59] many times I would have loved to watch
[1:56:01] Jesus do miracles
[1:56:07] Paul in prison said you have any new
