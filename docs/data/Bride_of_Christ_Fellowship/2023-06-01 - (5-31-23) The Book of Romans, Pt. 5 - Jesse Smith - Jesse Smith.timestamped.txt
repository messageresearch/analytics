[0:00] sir let's go to Romans chapter 3 verse
[0:02] one I'd like to continue on the book of
[0:03] Romans
[0:04] here by the grace of God
[0:11] Romans chapter 3 verse 1.
[0:19] Romans chapter 3 verse 1.
[0:46] Romans chapter 3 verse one praise God
[0:49] of course we're still in the section
[0:50] here that the whole world is guilty
[0:54] before God but by God's grace by then
[0:55] the chapter we'll get to the next
[0:57] section how
[0:58] we are justified by faith as brother Ram
[1:01] said it's as though we never did it in
[1:03] the first place because that speaks of
[1:05] the righteousness of Christ Christ's
[1:07] righteousness being shared with us or
[1:10] given to us as a gift of love praise God
[1:13] how can we not love in church for all
[1:15] that he's done amen just in that given
[1:17] us his righteousness what more could we
[1:19] ask for
[1:19] praise God Hallelujah Romans 3 verse 1.
[1:27] we'll just read verses one and two I
[1:29] think on my notes I had we'll read verse
[1:30] one two and three but let's just read
[1:32] verses one and two I think we can all
[1:33] read that verses one and two by God's
[1:35] grace so let's read that on three one
[1:37] two three what advantage then hath the
[1:40] Jew or what prophet is there of
[1:44] circumcision much every way chiefly
[1:47] because that unto them were committed
[1:51] the Oracles of God Amen let's have a
[1:53] word one more word of prayer if you have
[1:54] a need on your heart let's make a note
[1:55] into God somehow God seems every heart
[1:57] tonight
[1:58] we know God's word is eternal Hallelujah
[2:01] we know it was forever so in heaven and
[2:03] we know this day was ordained and
[2:05] predestined
[2:06] for God to feed our hungry Souls the
[2:08] word of God so father God we thank you
[2:10] for tonight Lord God take these words
[2:11] now Lord anoint them to our hearts that
[2:14] we might understand Lord God hallelujah
[2:16] we know there's joy in Revelation Lord
[2:19] there's stimulation my Revelation
[2:21] stimulate is here tonight God in your
[2:23] divine presence bless the ones that come
[2:25] out to the house of God thank you for
[2:26] these faithful Saints the Lord Minister
[2:28] those who might be working tonight like
[2:29] brother amen and brother vangan and
[2:31] sister Sia probably at home watching the
[2:33] children so father God minister to each
[2:34] one every one of them I'm sure Jose's
[2:36] working tonight Lord
[2:38] I pray God you minister to him as well
[2:40] Lord God anyway I've forgotten Lord I
[2:41] pray you remember them Lord God I know
[2:43] you will because you're faithful Lord
[2:45] Jesus do not forget one Lord because you
[2:48] care so much so Lord anoint this word
[2:50] now I pray in Jesus Christ's name and
[2:52] the Saints said
[2:53] amen God bless you as you're being
[2:55] seated there praise God I have a few
[2:57] slides here we'll show here tonight by
[2:59] God's grace
[3:03] I'm going to try to watch my time I
[3:04] think you know the last few weeks I've
[3:05] been preaching like an hour and a half
[3:06] on Wednesday so
[3:08] forgetting to set my watch so here let
[3:09] me set my watch here
[3:12] it's got a big we've got a busy night
[3:14] tomorrow night so it might have a late I
[3:16] don't have two late nights in a row
[3:19] we're trying to just watch our time
[3:21] we'll try to preach 45 minutes tonight
[3:22] here
[3:23] so let's look at this here now for
[3:25] schofield's outline we're still on part
[3:26] part one after the introduction uh we're
[3:29] seeing how the whole world is guilty
[3:31] before God but I wanted to finish
[3:32] chapter three hoping to get through
[3:34] chapter three tonight here by God's
[3:36] grace and then that will take us into
[3:38] the second section justification by
[3:40] faith as the solution for our guilt and
[3:43] shame
[3:44] Hallelujah so I think we'll we're able
[3:46] to gain a lot of great things out of
[3:47] this chapter here as I was going through
[3:49] it you know some of these verses are
[3:50] very important to us especially as
[3:54] Believers as Christians but also as
[3:56] message Believers here at the end time
[3:57] they're important for us as well
[4:00] so I know you'll be blessed here tonight
[4:02] by the grace of the Lord
[4:05] so let's look at our first verse here
[4:07] verse one what advantage is then hath
[4:09] the Jew or what prophet is there of
[4:11] circumcision
[4:13] because as we as we saw in chapter one
[4:15] and two you know all three groups are
[4:17] condemned whether you're the Gentile
[4:18] Pagan or the Gentile moralist or the the
[4:22] Jew that has the law all three are
[4:24] condemned right under sin but is there
[4:26] advantage to being a Jew Paul says yes
[4:29] in every way
[4:31] now every way that's quite a statement
[4:33] every way so think about your emotions
[4:35] right think about your relationships
[4:37] now think about worshiping God think
[4:40] about uh your feelings and and all your
[4:43] associations your friendships in every
[4:45] way possible having the law is better
[4:47] than not having it
[4:49] why because the Bible said the main
[4:51] reason is because God gave to the Jews
[4:54] the Oracles of God
[4:58] so it's much better it's better in every
[5:00] way to have thus saith the Lord
[5:03] right it's always better to have thus
[5:04] saith the Lord than to not have thus
[5:06] saith the Lord praise God and so this is
[5:09] the great Advantage though that the Jew
[5:10] had over the Gentile moralist and the
[5:13] Gentile Pagan Hallelujah
[5:16] and now he gets into this thought he
[5:18] says for what if some of the Jews did
[5:20] not believe
[5:22] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[5:24] God
[5:25] without effect and now of course the
[5:27] answer is no it's on the next slide
[5:30] can can the Unfaithful ones
[5:33] um
[5:34] make God's word ineffective
[5:36] and Paul says no
[5:39] amen so it doesn't matter so it is like
[5:41] in this day can the can those who fall
[5:43] away from the message can can they hurt
[5:45] our faith in any way no right can the
[5:48] Muslims today hurt our faith in any way
[5:50] of course not can The Sinner who gets
[5:52] drunk tonight and goes out to the bar
[5:54] and lives immorally can they can they
[5:57] hurt our face somehow no there's no way
[5:59] to do it praise God Amen why because
[6:02] it's an individual Affair praise God
[6:03] thank God for that now here's why God
[6:06] forbid see God God would forbid this
[6:09] from happening that that the Sinners
[6:11] would would in some in some way uh
[6:14] impact the believer God forbid God God
[6:17] will always in other words anyone who
[6:19] wants to obey the word of God God will
[6:20] always stand with you hallelujah amen
[6:24] so he says yes let God be true but every
[6:27] man a liar
[6:28] as it is written now we're going to look
[6:30] at this in a moment what scripture he's
[6:32] talking about scriptures talking about
[6:33] David David wrote this in other words
[6:35] David wrote that thou mightest be
[6:37] justified in thy sayings and might us
[6:40] overcome when thou art judged
[6:44] okay so Paul says God forbid right God
[6:47] forbid that a sinner uh their unbelief
[6:51] in the law could could hurt a person who
[6:53] believed the law right because each one
[6:56] of us stand alone right like I always
[6:58] love what brother Adam says you know
[7:00] none of you will be able to stand there
[7:01] like my wife won't be able to stand with
[7:03] me I won't be able to stand with her
[7:05] when we stand before God now when
[7:07] rewards are given out I think we might
[7:08] Stand Together
[7:09] Hallelujah but but when we're being uh
[7:13] when we have to be accountable for our
[7:14] actions ultimately we stand alone praise
[7:17] God we've got to answer for the Deeds
[7:18] Done in our body praise God
[7:21] Hallelujah
[7:23] and so that you know that uh and I'm
[7:25] just I think I'll just share this
[7:27] thought you know some people feel so bad
[7:29] for the like the people that follow
[7:31] false teachers and and I do too I feel
[7:34] uh I feel bad for the you know like the
[7:36] 900 that follow Jim Jones
[7:38] to their deaths but at the same time
[7:40] they're responsible for their own
[7:42] decisions
[7:43] right and yes yes uh false teachers will
[7:46] have a greater punishment but at the
[7:48] same time if you're the elect of God you
[7:51] cannot be deceived
[7:52] in other words if you really want the
[7:54] truth then God will give you the truth
[7:56] praise God
[7:58] there's no one that can deceive you how
[7:59] many want to be saved praise God then
[8:01] there's no way the devil can make you be
[8:03] lost amen hallelujah praise God there's
[8:06] no one if you want the truth God is
[8:09] obligated to give you the truth praise
[8:10] God if you want to follow a real man of
[8:13] God if you want to follow a real
[8:14] ministry that's from God then God will
[8:16] give that to you praise God
[8:18] Hallelujah so I just want to make sure I
[8:20] say that as well you know we feel bad
[8:21] for those followers of the false
[8:24] teachers but at the same time they want
[8:26] it alive the Bible said they wanted
[8:27] teachers that would itch their ears
[8:30] they wanted to come to church and always
[8:31] have a tickle oh that that's funny that
[8:34] that's sweet that's cute that's what
[8:36] they want when they come to church which
[8:38] are sometimes not everything we hear is
[8:40] going to tickle our ears right in fact
[8:42] most times it's not right
[8:44] uh we want we want preachers who tell us
[8:47] the truth of God's word right we want
[8:50] ears that can hear praise God we want
[8:52] eyes that can see Hallelujah
[8:55] and so we thank God that we hear the
[8:57] true word of God
[8:59] now Paul here is citing David's
[9:03] repentant heart
[9:05] God forbid that Sinners would be able to
[9:07] impact the faith of believers
[9:10] and he says God is true but every man is
[9:13] a liar now here's where this comes from
[9:15] how we know where it comes from
[9:16] Psalm 51 it comes from David after his
[9:19] sin with Bathsheba
[9:21] now look what he says for I acknowledge
[9:23] my transgressions right the murder the
[9:26] adultery lying hiding it without I mean
[9:29] how many sins were in there many
[9:31] and my sin is ever before me David says
[9:35] but he says against thee and thee only
[9:38] have I sinned
[9:40] right and done this evil in thy sight
[9:45] now I just want you to catch us here now
[9:48] he quotes what he quotes this quote that
[9:50] Paul later used in Romans that thou now
[9:53] he's not you're not talking about him or
[9:54] somebody else he's talking about God
[9:57] he acknowledges sin before God that God
[10:00] might be justified when God speaks
[10:03] now God is always going to be justified
[10:05] right God's always going to be right
[10:07] God's always going to be true
[10:09] but but David's saying
[10:12] but David's saying I'm going to
[10:14] acknowledge my sin so that I never make
[10:16] God look like he's unfair
[10:19] right he's going to acknowledge that I'm
[10:21] the guilty one God is not the guilty one
[10:24] like the devil didn't make me do my sin
[10:27] right
[10:28] my husband didn't make me do it my wife
[10:30] didn't make me do my children didn't
[10:32] make me do it like Moses could say the
[10:34] people didn't make him Smite The Rock
[10:36] Moses did it
[10:37] he should add control over himself right
[10:41] so in other words we must take full
[10:44] responsibility for our sin and not blame
[10:46] anybody else David is saying well I'm
[10:48] not going to blame Bathsheba
[10:50] why was she a bathing outside well
[10:52] that's not the point he could have
[10:54] turned his head
[10:56] right
[10:57] and so does with each one of us
[11:00] and and Paul's saying we must take
[11:02] responsibility for our sin that God is
[11:05] always looked at as being just and God
[11:08] is God is righteous in all his judgments
[11:11] right God is just and fair
[11:15] so in other words we must always
[11:16] recognize our sins God is always right
[11:19] and man is always wrong
[11:21] right when it comes down to judgment
[11:24] right so Paul is saying here that God is
[11:29] always right and we must always take
[11:31] responsibility for our sin and not pass
[11:34] it off on anybody else
[11:36] now the difficult part is when you're
[11:37] hurt as a child or you're hurt and
[11:39] innocent and you're innocent that's a
[11:41] difficult part
[11:42] but that's not a sin that you have to
[11:44] confess
[11:46] right because it's not you didn't it
[11:48] just happened to you right
[11:50] but what what happens is the enemy tries
[11:53] to get you bitter over what happened and
[11:55] he tries to get a root of bitterness to
[11:57] work in us and we've got to overcome the
[11:59] root of bitterness
[12:02] the Bible said we must offer forgiveness
[12:04] as freely as we want Jesus to forgive us
[12:08] that's a special kind of a test that's a
[12:10] very difficult test when you're really
[12:11] innocent
[12:12] right but somebody hurts you
[12:16] but the it's God has allowed that for a
[12:18] test to to let you be like Christ amen
[12:22] that's why amen so you can be like
[12:23] Christ and you can offer forgiveness to
[12:25] those who don't deserve it because
[12:27] really you and I don't deserve
[12:28] forgiveness either
[12:30] that's a hard thing that's but that's
[12:31] true it's a hard thing especially when
[12:33] children are heard and or innocent
[12:35] adults are hurt which is awful it's
[12:37] awful but
[12:39] we must remember that that we've got a
[12:42] we've got a responsibility to go to God
[12:44] in prayer and God as we said God can
[12:46] meet all of our needs
[12:48] right and we must remember we go through
[12:50] difficult trials to make us more like
[12:52] Christ
[12:53] Hallelujah and also to express the love
[12:56] of Jesus Christ amen
[12:59] now this this this phrase has another
[13:01] application so this phrase let God be
[13:04] true Every Man a liar it has it has the
[13:07] application with David that we have to
[13:08] own up to our sins and we can't push our
[13:11] sins on somebody else
[13:12] We're not gonna do that in heaven we're
[13:13] not going to say well he made me do it
[13:15] or that preacher made me do it or that
[13:17] sister made me do it we're not gonna be
[13:18] able to point our fingers anybody else
[13:19] we're only going to point our fingers at
[13:21] ourselves
[13:24] so that's the first application now
[13:26] another application is I like how
[13:28] brother I'm uses this
[13:30] that the word of God is always right and
[13:33] every man or woman that tries to trip or
[13:36] twist of scripture is wrong
[13:38] so in this case he's using Catholicism
[13:41] in this in this chapter chapter 3 of the
[13:44] church age book and he says that is
[13:46] exactly what nickelatinum has come to
[13:47] they say never mind what God's word says
[13:50] you can't understand it we have to
[13:51] interpret it for you furthermore the
[13:53] Bible's not finished it has to change
[13:55] with the times and we will tell you what
[13:57] the changes are now that's what the
[13:59] whole lesbian and gay movement is doing
[14:01] right well the Bible doesn't really mean
[14:03] it's an Abomination it doesn't really
[14:05] mean that
[14:06] right it's trying to change the Bible
[14:08] for the times that we're in but brother
[14:10] Graham says that that's contrary to
[14:13] God's word because the Bible said God is
[14:15] true and every man is a liar
[14:19] whenever there's a conflict with the
[14:21] truth
[14:21] whenever we're not sure what's truth we
[14:23] must be trained always to go back to the
[14:26] scripture what does the Bible say that's
[14:28] a great question praise God
[14:29] my dad when he was first seeking God in
[14:31] 1983 which is foremost 40 years ago
[14:33] because it was October
[14:36] he was uh he was raised in a Catholic
[14:39] Church he was kind of a bullied by the
[14:40] the nuns he was thrown up against the
[14:42] lockers by the nuns I don't know if he
[14:43] told you that but he's really bullied by
[14:45] the nuns but when he when he first got a
[14:47] Bible
[14:49] he looked at it and then he said he
[14:50] heard a voice and said what did Jesus
[14:52] say
[14:53] and that's when he started reading the
[14:54] Bible I thought what a good lesson that
[14:56] is for all of us praise God right
[14:58] when we want to know about God I believe
[15:00] the holy spirit will say what did Jesus
[15:02] say about it praise God
[15:04] because Jesus said the Holy Ghost will
[15:06] speak of me Hallelujah
[15:08] right the Bible said the Holy Ghost will
[15:10] bring all things to remembrance and it
[15:11] will help us remember what Jesus said
[15:13] praise God
[15:15] well anyways this reminds me of my dad
[15:16] to hear that testimony he said Heaven
[15:19] Earth will pass away but not one word of
[15:21] God will fail so the people are led by
[15:23] people who presume to be what they are
[15:26] not they say they're Vickers of Christ
[15:28] it doesn't have to be a pope or a priest
[15:29] it can be any preacher right but what
[15:31] they are is Antichrist so anyone who
[15:34] changes the gospel in order to fit the
[15:36] the world or the culture is an
[15:39] antichrist
[15:41] Hallelujah we got to change our lives
[15:43] away from the culture to match the
[15:45] culture of the Bible hallelujah amen
[15:47] praise God and then he goes on to say in
[15:49] chapter six let God be true with every
[15:51] man a liar if you take away or add to
[15:53] that book God has promised that he will
[15:55] add plagues to those who add and take
[15:57] away from their part from The Book of
[15:58] Life if they dare to subtract from it
[16:01] revelation 22 18-19 now this quote
[16:04] reminded me of another quote I went
[16:05] looking for this today I just want to
[16:07] just emphasize this again and the reason
[16:09] I want to read this is because there's
[16:10] so many uh testimonies dreams or visions
[16:13] brother random had
[16:15] and sometimes the interpretation of them
[16:17] is unclear for example with the seven
[16:20] Thunders right we talked about that some
[16:21] of our precious friends believe seven
[16:23] Thunders one way I might believe it
[16:25] another way right or the seventh seal
[16:28] right or or any uh when is La going to
[16:31] sink in the ocean when is America going
[16:32] to be bombed all these questions we
[16:34] don't even have the answers on some of
[16:35] them right some of them we do some of
[16:37] them we don't
[16:38] but either way no matter what story from
[16:40] other Branham or what Vision he had or
[16:42] what dream or what sermon you're reading
[16:44] or listening to everything we we believe
[16:46] has to be taken back to the Bible
[16:50] right that's uh and that's you know when
[16:53] I talk with brothers and and I have
[16:55] questions what I ultimately do sister
[16:57] lead is I try to get them to say well
[16:59] what verse now do you have to back this
[17:02] up
[17:03] amen
[17:04] oh you leave well brother said this yeah
[17:06] I see brother said that but what Bible
[17:08] verse
[17:10] are you ultimately resting your
[17:12] understanding on
[17:14] and if they got a verse praise God well
[17:15] that might be right but if they don't
[17:16] have a verse and I'll say well okay
[17:19] you're allowed to have your opinion
[17:22] but if we're going to trust in something
[17:23] we got to trust in the word of God
[17:26] look what brother I said now someone
[17:28] said well that Seven Seals then brother
[17:30] Brown that will be revealed on the last
[17:31] day some great mystery how do we get
[17:32] closer to God no sir it can't be now
[17:34] what he's talking about is someone
[17:35] saying oh there's something outside the
[17:37] Bible that we need to know in the last
[17:39] days brother I said no sir we can't
[17:41] enter the Bible whosoever shall take one
[17:43] word from this Bible or one word to it
[17:45] his part will be taken the Book of Life
[17:47] what it is the Seven Seals is a
[17:50] revelation what has been missed back
[17:52] there to bring
[17:53] it's already wrote here it's in here
[17:55] it's to reveal what already has been
[17:57] written see because you can't add one
[17:59] thing to it or take one word from it
[18:03] the first chapter of the Bible in the
[18:05] beginning Genesis one woman didn't
[18:07] misbelieve it she just misinterpreted
[18:08] let Satan misinterpret her one word
[18:10] surely see and then from that caused all
[18:13] this trouble that was God speaking God's
[18:15] word and the last chapter of Revelation
[18:17] look brother man goes from Genesis with
[18:19] Eve to revelation
[18:21] what was the problem in Genesis Eve
[18:23] added to the word what's the warning in
[18:25] Revelation at the end don't add or don't
[18:27] want to take one word away I like that
[18:29] don't you like how the Bible does that
[18:30] it circles back to the beginning praise
[18:33] God right we all love stories that
[18:35] Circle back right and oh this is what
[18:37] happened in the beginning ah yeah we got
[18:39] the same theme from the beginning to the
[18:41] end oh I love movies like that good
[18:43] movies like that you know Godly movies I
[18:45] love books like that oh the same thought
[18:47] from the beginning is now at the end
[18:49] what a great way to end the book or what
[18:50] a great way to end the story
[18:52] same thing in the Bible the Bible starts
[18:54] off by saying don't add one word and the
[18:56] Bible Ends by saying don't add one word
[18:58] and if you don't add one word then
[19:00] there's a place for you in the New
[19:02] Jerusalem praise God oh what a promise
[19:05] amen if we just stay with what the Bible
[19:07] said then we're guaranteed a mansion in
[19:10] heaven or a room in heaven praise God
[19:12] we're guaranteed a place in that Holy
[19:14] City because we just said what the Bible
[19:16] said Hallelujah
[19:17] and we didn't take away from what the
[19:19] Bible said
[19:22] glory in the last chapter of Revelation
[19:25] Jesus himself the same God said
[19:27] whosoever shall take one word out or add
[19:30] one word to it the this is the complete
[19:33] revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven
[19:35] Seals had the Mysteries hid of what it
[19:37] all was and it's supposed to open it in
[19:40] the last day at the later scene age at
[19:42] the end time thanks be to God that
[19:45] finishes the message to the church that
[19:47] finishes it when they look back and see
[19:49] what has been and see where it's all
[19:51] brought up to that finishes it the age
[19:54] of the church
[19:56] so laodicea is the last Church age right
[20:00] Hallelujah and the Bible is the complete
[20:02] revelation of Jesus Christ
[20:05] so let's apply that to today then we
[20:08] need to read Romans 3 and we need to
[20:10] find the revelation of Jesus Christ
[20:12] but what is the revelation of Jesus
[20:14] Christ so far we've seen that Jesus
[20:16] Christ cannot lie praise God every man
[20:19] lies but Jesus Christ can never lie
[20:22] praise God
[20:24] Church Jesus said before he left he said
[20:27] my peace I leave with you
[20:30] he also said my joy I leave with you
[20:33] he said because you're going to need it
[20:34] in this world
[20:37] so it is no lie it is the truth if you
[20:40] need peace Jesus's peace is here if you
[20:42] need Joy Jesus said I'm leaving my joy
[20:45] you can have joy here praise God Amen
[20:47] it's not a lie it's the truth Jesus
[20:50] always tells the truth hallelujah
[20:53] if someone takes away that Joy if
[20:54] somebody or the enemy tries to take away
[20:55] your peace or take away your joy you can
[20:58] rebuke the enemy and you can say Jesus
[21:00] said I can have peace Jesus said I can
[21:03] have joy I can live an overcoming life
[21:05] because God cannot lie Hallelujah
[21:08] oh thank God amen hallelujah thank you
[21:12] Jesus amen glory to God Amen now moving
[21:15] on to Romans 3 verse 5.
[21:18] but if our unrighteousness commends or
[21:21] demonstrates the righteousness of God
[21:24] what shall we say
[21:26] is God unrighteous who taketh Vengeance
[21:29] okay so in other words the our sin
[21:33] demonstrates that God is Holy right
[21:36] when someone sins all that shows is that
[21:38] God is Holy
[21:40] right this guy if there's Unholy there's
[21:41] got to be holy right and then is it okay
[21:45] for God to take vengeance
[21:48] the Bible said God forbid
[21:50] for then how should God judge the world
[21:52] so in other words God is righteous to
[21:54] judge the world in Vengeance because the
[21:57] wages of sin is death every action must
[22:00] have a consequence
[22:01] praise God God is Holy and anyone who
[22:04] sins against the holy God should be
[22:06] condemned because they broke God's law
[22:09] right that's what Romans 6 23 says
[22:12] praise God now Paul's answer for this is
[22:14] coming up it's almost three entire
[22:16] chapters
[22:18] it's the part of chapter 3 chapter 4 and
[22:21] part of chapter five
[22:23] how shall God judge the world well you
[22:25] all know it he'll judge it in
[22:26] righteousness we already read it in
[22:28] Chapter 2 as well he said when God will
[22:31] judge the secrets of men's Hearts
[22:33] according to my Gospel According to my
[22:35] good news Paul's letters are good news
[22:38] some people call Paul a woman hater some
[22:40] people call Brother Branham a woman hate
[22:42] her but that's not true they were a
[22:45] Bible they were Bible lovers praise God
[22:46] brother Adam said I love my Christian
[22:48] sisters
[22:50] right we're Christian sisters were were
[22:52] uh uh we're women lovers as long as
[22:55] they're Christian women praise God even
[22:56] we love our enemies praise God
[22:58] it's never it's never okay to hate our
[23:01] enemies we should love our enemies
[23:02] praise God
[23:04] so we're lovers of Sinners we're lovers
[23:06] of men that are sinners lovers and women
[23:07] with Christian love
[23:10] we don't want to see anybody lost
[23:13] right Hallelujah
[23:15] so we know God judges God will judge
[23:18] Everybody by the same gospel Hallelujah
[23:20] and each person has given a chance to
[23:22] repent of their sins and come to Christ
[23:24] but God is righteous by his Vengeance
[23:27] against sin he's righteous to judge it
[23:31] just like brothers says what if there
[23:33] was uh what if there was no laws
[23:35] right what if there was no law and
[23:37] people could drive 90 miles per hour
[23:39] down the road and run over children or
[23:41] run over whatever run over adults and
[23:43] there's no punishment for it what kind
[23:44] of place would that be
[23:46] what would that cause that would cause
[23:47] chaos right that would be ever that
[23:50] would mean everybody's a bounty hunter
[23:51] right if somebody did that to me I'm
[23:52] pain there'll be no justice
[23:55] but God is a God of Justice praise God
[23:57] we can trust in God God will give
[24:00] everybody what they're due God will pay
[24:02] everybody back either good or bad and
[24:04] that's a God that we love that's a God
[24:06] that we can trust that's a God I can
[24:08] serve praise God
[24:10] amen because he will give to every man
[24:12] and woman whenever they have invested in
[24:15] whatever they've done whatever they
[24:17] poured themselves into God will pay them
[24:19] back and it will be a fair thing
[24:21] amen
[24:23] now here's quite a statement here
[24:26] for if the truth of God hath more
[24:28] abounded through my lie unto his glory
[24:32] in other words when people lie it
[24:34] magnifies how true God is when there's
[24:37] all these lies in the world especially
[24:38] in the media and politics when there's
[24:40] so many lies that actually makes the
[24:42] truth abound unto more Glory like wow
[24:44] God's word is so much better than the
[24:46] politicians
[24:48] right listen to preaching is so much
[24:50] better than listen to politicians and
[24:51] the church said
[24:53] because they lie all the time
[24:55] they rep they misrepresent the truth but
[24:58] their lies make God's truth abound wow
[25:00] So Glorious it's so wonderful
[25:03] but Paul says because of that why yet am
[25:07] I also judged as a sinner
[25:09] so if my lie abounds to his glory and
[25:12] judgment why am I judged well we know
[25:13] the answer we're judged because sin has
[25:16] wages or sin has consequences
[25:20] right
[25:21] so we're getting into some deep things
[25:22] here by God's grace
[25:25] now look at this here now here's what
[25:26] some people say
[25:28] some people say let us do evil that good
[25:30] May Come
[25:32] well in other words like brothers said
[25:34] some people say oh I'm so saved now that
[25:36] I'm so saved I can never be lost they
[25:38] say now I'm going to go paint the town
[25:39] red brother random said
[25:42] so brother I knew some people that said
[25:43] I'm saved and I'm I'm never going to be
[25:45] lost so I'll just go get drunk and have
[25:47] adulteries and fornications I'll live
[25:49] like a devil because I'm going to be
[25:50] saved anyway
[25:52] and that is the Bible said that's that's
[25:54] sin right the Bible said that that's
[25:57] unrighteousness
[25:58] that's what the Bible says here here's
[26:00] what here's how Paul says it and not
[26:03] rather as we be slandishly reported and
[26:05] as some affirm that we say so some
[26:08] people are relying on Paul think about
[26:09] that you're the prophet of God and
[26:11] people are lying on you have you ever
[26:13] had a lie told on you
[26:16] and somebody said something that you
[26:18] didn't say how did it make you feel
[26:20] betrayed I've had numerous lives told on
[26:23] me I never said that
[26:25] that's not what I said that's not what I
[26:27] preached that's not what I taught on the
[26:28] video that's not what I said
[26:30] and you feel betrayed well join the club
[26:33] right because if you're speaking truth
[26:35] people are going to speak evil against
[26:37] you
[26:39] Hallelujah
[26:40] so they spoke against Paul and Jesus
[26:43] said if they hated the master how much
[26:45] more are they going to hate the Servants
[26:46] of the master
[26:48] they hated Jesus they're going to hate
[26:49] us sometimes right people are going to
[26:51] hate us because we're Christians
[26:54] but some people lied on Paul and they
[26:56] said Paul says let us do evil that good
[26:58] May Come
[27:00] and church that goes completely contrary
[27:03] to God's law we just preached on last
[27:04] Wednesday you reap whatever you sow
[27:08] so Paul some people lied on Paul and
[27:10] said well you can plant bad stuff and
[27:12] get good things
[27:14] Paul said God forbid that's not what I
[27:16] believe
[27:18] right and Paul said if anybody says that
[27:20] they'll be damned and their damnation is
[27:23] just
[27:24] anyone that says well I'm going to get
[27:26] good things because I sin so much
[27:28] they're they deserve to be judged
[27:31] anyone that says God doesn't care how I
[27:33] live I'm still going to get Grace anyone
[27:35] who says that they're Damned
[27:38] and the church said
[27:41] a lot of churches say that not message
[27:42] but a lot of churches say that
[27:45] they say you could live however you want
[27:46] and God's grace is always going to
[27:48] God's grace is always going to extend
[27:49] you God's grace extends to you as you
[27:51] trust in it and as you receive it the
[27:53] right way
[27:55] right
[27:56] now this reminded me of
[27:58] the scripture Jude 1 verse 4.
[28:02] remember damnation is deserved for all
[28:04] those who rejoice in evil
[28:07] now church we might get we might get
[28:09] tempted and actually enjoy partaking
[28:12] into sin but at some point when we get
[28:14] in the presence of God and we humble
[28:15] ourselves we feel bad for our sins
[28:19] right we shouldn't rejoice in our sins
[28:21] we should feel bad eventually I believe
[28:23] if you pray long enough or read your
[28:25] Bible long enough or close your eyes and
[28:27] talk to God long enough have communion
[28:28] with God you're going to feel condemned
[28:30] for your sin and you're going to feel
[28:32] bad that you did it
[28:35] because rejoicing in evil shows a sinful
[28:38] heart
[28:39] right here's what Jude 1 verse 4 says
[28:41] there are certain men crept in unawares
[28:44] look at that
[28:46] that means some people are going to try
[28:48] to creep in our church and we're not
[28:50] going to recognize it at first
[28:53] but they're going to try to creep in or
[28:54] into your life
[28:55] friends are going to call themselves
[28:57] Believers and they're going to try to
[28:59] creep into your life and try to get you
[29:02] to come under the condemnation of saying
[29:05] uh that Grace means you can do whatever
[29:07] you want
[29:09] right that's what's what Paul said
[29:11] that's what they said about Paul oh
[29:12] let's sin more so more God more of God's
[29:14] glory can come upon us God can show more
[29:16] Glory
[29:17] Paul said you deserve condemnation for
[29:19] that kind of thought
[29:20] don't continue sin that Grace May abound
[29:22] he says it later in chapter six should
[29:24] we continue and sin that Grace May
[29:26] abound should we keep sinning so God's
[29:28] grace is greater of course not God
[29:30] forbid
[29:31] as soon as you receive God's grace it
[29:33] should motivate you not to want to sin
[29:35] praise God
[29:37] all right praise God
[29:39] but can I say it like this men ordain
[29:42] the condemnation
[29:43] in other words they're serpent seed
[29:45] people right we don't know who they are
[29:48] at first but they will creep into
[29:50] churches and change Grace into
[29:52] lawlessness that's what that word means
[29:54] lawlessness there's no law but Church
[29:56] we're not under the law of Moses we're
[29:58] under the law of the spirit
[30:00] which is a better law praise God
[30:01] hallelujah it's still a law though if
[30:04] you plant good seeds you're going to
[30:06] reap spiritual blessings
[30:07] right that's the law of the Holy Spirit
[30:09] but if you grieve the Holy Spirit God's
[30:12] spirit will pull away from you That's
[30:14] the Law of the Holy Spirit and you
[30:15] repent and God's spirit comes back on
[30:17] you amen
[30:20] amen and so now we know people that say
[30:23] oh you can live however you want you're
[30:24] still going to heaven they're Lawless
[30:26] and they deny God now they they're
[30:29] probably saying Jesus loves you so
[30:31] they're not denying Jesus by name
[30:33] they're denying his word they're denying
[30:35] the Bible praise God
[30:37] they're not going to creep and no one's
[30:39] going to creep in here saying there's no
[30:41] Jesus and you guys need to follow me and
[30:42] you can you can do whatever you want
[30:44] and send it
[30:46] they're not going to deceive anybody
[30:47] like that
[30:50] they're going to creep in here like they
[30:51] have in other message churches saying
[30:52] Brothers it's okay to uh
[30:55] it's okay to smoke
[30:57] it's okay to cuss it's okay to uh it's
[30:59] okay to divorce and remarry another
[31:01] woman
[31:02] and you're still forgiven
[31:04] right or sisters it's okay for you to
[31:06] wear makeup or trim your hair wear the
[31:08] concealer or whatever they say
[31:10] or paint your finger or fingernails now
[31:12] that's going more towards worldliness
[31:14] right
[31:16] they're going to make it seem like all
[31:17] these things are okay and slowly going
[31:20] to try they're trying to slowly convince
[31:22] you and I that it's okay to sin
[31:25] and it's okay if you sin because God
[31:28] will show more grace
[31:31] we know better than that
[31:32] Hallelujah
[31:34] we got more mature people than that
[31:36] don't we
[31:37] Hallelujah
[31:38] we got some meat eating Christians in
[31:41] here today
[31:42] we got some meat eaters or we got a
[31:44] bunch of babies on bottles tonight which
[31:45] one do we got here
[31:46] are we message babies just drinking
[31:48] bottles and well I can do anything I
[31:50] want I still go to heaven
[31:52] nonsense no give me that stake of the
[31:55] word of God give me that steak and let
[31:57] me put my let me put my spiritual fork
[31:59] in there I'm going to chew on the word
[32:00] of God
[32:01] no my sin does not make grace abound
[32:04] right
[32:06] I want to crucify sin in my life that
[32:09] God's grace can abound hallelujah amen
[32:11] that God's spirit can manifest more in
[32:13] my life by crucifying the the lust of
[32:16] the Flesh and the pride of life and and
[32:18] all those three areas
[32:21] see they're going to deny God's word
[32:23] they're not going to deny the name of
[32:25] Jesus they're going to deny God's word
[32:27] Hallelujah
[32:30] verse 9.
[32:32] what then are we better than they no in
[32:35] no wise for we have before approved both
[32:38] Jews and Gentiles that they are all
[32:40] under sin in other words all are slaves
[32:42] to sin and honors Dominion
[32:45] so think about that whether the Jews had
[32:47] the law or not they were they still feel
[32:49] the same thing the Gentiles feel like
[32:52] you're constantly going to sin and fall
[32:54] short of God's glory
[32:55] you've got to constantly battle sin how
[32:58] many ever get tired of battling sin
[33:00] just wish you had a new body
[33:02] I often think that
[33:04] praise God we're all born under the sin
[33:08] nature we're born in sin shaped in
[33:10] iniquity the Bible says right in sin did
[33:13] our mothers conceive us right in other
[33:15] words a sin nature was in us from the
[33:17] conception of of Who We Are
[33:21] and all of us are under sin
[33:24] that's why I love what the Bible says
[33:25] you know people will say oh brother
[33:27] Jesse you don't know how hard my trial
[33:29] is well in one way I don't but another
[33:31] way I do because I know what it's like
[33:34] to battle sin
[33:36] there's no temptation a given among men
[33:39] that's not common to all men
[33:41] right it's either lust of the eyes lust
[33:43] of the flesh pride of life so yeah
[33:45] there's certain things I've never maybe
[33:46] experienced that but there's probably
[33:48] things I've experienced you've never
[33:49] experienced before
[33:51] right we're all battling sin and we all
[33:54] should encourage one another to overcome
[33:56] sin praise God
[33:57] Glory
[33:59] verse 10. now we're getting here through
[34:01] the chapter here
[34:03] as it is written there's none righteous
[34:05] no not one
[34:09] think about that Enoch
[34:11] he wasn't righteous by his own merits
[34:14] he in other words Enoch took a Rapture
[34:16] but before that he was still sold under
[34:19] sin
[34:21] Enoch would still still sin
[34:24] right John the Baptist
[34:26] no man greater than John the Baptist in
[34:28] the Old Testament he still sinned at
[34:31] some time at some point
[34:32] right
[34:33] you name it no matter the man no matter
[34:35] how great he was
[34:37] he was he was not righteous of his own
[34:40] in other words each one that we have
[34:42] seem to be a real man of God or a real
[34:44] woman of God they had to learn amen they
[34:46] had to grow and righteousness just like
[34:48] we're going in righteousness praise God
[34:50] it got to grow in it
[34:53] but there's none that's righteous
[34:54] outside of Christ there's none that
[34:57] understandable brother Jesse or my
[34:59] pastor or my my mom they just understand
[35:01] everything they didn't understand it all
[35:04] on their own
[35:06] well my my brother my sister they're so
[35:09] righteous not on their own
[35:11] there's none that seeketh God well
[35:13] brother you don't understand I saw God
[35:15] so much well
[35:16] not on your own
[35:18] God Drew you to to Fellowship
[35:22] God invited you because you couldn't get
[35:24] to God unless he opened up the way to
[35:25] get to him
[35:27] because your sins kept you out
[35:29] praise God
[35:32] there's none that seeketh after God
[35:35] so none of us are righteous of our own
[35:37] none of us instantly understand God's
[35:39] word and none of us instantly seek after
[35:41] God we've all got to be taught how to
[35:43] seek after God
[35:46] Romans 3 12 they are all gone out of the
[35:49] way they're all together become
[35:50] unprofitable there's none that doeth
[35:52] good no not one
[35:55] what a statement
[35:58] and this ought to encourage Us by God's
[36:00] grace right
[36:02] we all know right in Hebrews 11 there's
[36:04] a Hall of Fame of faith
[36:07] how did they get in there did they get
[36:09] on there on their own church or they get
[36:11] in there by two words what two words do
[36:12] they get in there bye
[36:15] Hallelujah how'd they get in the Hall of
[36:18] Fame by God's faith
[36:20] they weren't automatically like that
[36:22] they had to accept God's word they had
[36:25] to believe God's word and they had to
[36:28] act on God's word just like you've got
[36:29] to act on God's word
[36:31] Hallelujah
[36:34] so no one just does good
[36:37] right they become altogether
[36:39] unprofitable this remind you know we
[36:41] would think oh brother random has so
[36:43] many visions and so many miracles that's
[36:45] true but I just heard it this week
[36:47] brother random said in the seventh seal
[36:49] he says you forget anything about me he
[36:51] said I'm a sinner saved by grace he said
[36:53] I'm not fit to live and he said I'm not
[36:55] saying that to be humble
[36:59] he says but God has let my poor dimming
[37:02] eyes amen he said look beyond the
[37:04] curtain of time praise God
[37:07] could give us the revelation of the
[37:09] Seven Seals because God had mercy on him
[37:12] and God let him look beyond the curtain
[37:15] of time amen thank God that God let you
[37:17] look in the book and you can see that
[37:19] the mystery of God is finished praise
[37:21] God and that there's one name to the
[37:23] fathers and Holy Ghost it's the name of
[37:25] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[37:28] God let your dimming eyes right one day
[37:31] there'll be dimming of God Dairies
[37:33] I asked Master McRae he's my he's our
[37:36] Taekwondo instructor he said
[37:38] most people said your eyes go out at 40
[37:41] 40 years old he said mine didn't go out
[37:43] till 58.
[37:44] I said you got 18 extra years of good
[37:46] eyes I said I'm going to take that I'm
[37:48] going to I'm gonna go beyond 18 there
[37:50] I'm gonna go to maybe 68 then my eyes
[37:52] will start dimming or something like
[37:53] that I'll take that
[37:55] Hallelujah
[37:57] bye
[37:59] but you know church we are what we are
[38:01] because God has given us I Salve that we
[38:04] can see the word of God
[38:06] we weren't just automatically good from
[38:07] our mother's womb
[38:09] right
[38:11] now here's what it goes on to say now
[38:13] remember this is this is talking about
[38:15] every person
[38:16] their throat is an open grave
[38:19] a picture just picture an animal on the
[38:22] side of the road that's maybe
[38:25] I just we drive by them every day now
[38:27] right I drove by a couple groundhogs
[38:29] today you know they're on the in the
[38:30] road
[38:31] flies all around well this is this is a
[38:34] little different this is an open grave
[38:35] where a dead body's exposed
[38:39] and that's what Paul Compares our mouths
[38:42] to and the church said
[38:45] in other words sometimes we say the
[38:47] nastiest things
[38:49] sometimes we say the grossest or the
[38:51] dirtiest things sometimes we say some of
[38:53] the most awful things
[38:56] and I'm not talking about when we were
[38:57] Sinners I'm talking about when we're
[38:59] saved
[39:01] yeah that's right I'm gonna show you
[39:04] just a few some simple examples you're
[39:05] familiar with them
[39:07] with their tongues they've used deceit
[39:10] the poison of ASP which is a Egyptian
[39:13] cobra is under their lips
[39:19] you know we sometimes we don't even
[39:20] realize that like wow we always you know
[39:22] we always bash the devil the devil's a
[39:25] liar Devil's liar well the Bible says
[39:26] you have some because your sin nature
[39:28] you have part of that nature under your
[39:30] tongue
[39:32] right if we're not careful that serpent
[39:34] that sinful nature is right under our
[39:37] tongue too
[39:39] that's why Glory that's why Isaiah said
[39:42] Lord send the coal from the altar amen
[39:45] hallelujah let your Holy Fire touch my
[39:48] tongue so I don't utter uh poison the
[39:51] poisonous uh uh the poison of Satan let
[39:55] me speak the holy things of God
[39:57] hallelujah
[39:58] amen can I say like this God send the
[40:01] holy fire tonight give us a fresh
[40:03] anointing that our mouths will speak the
[40:05] word of God hallelujah
[40:07] and not poison
[40:09] from an Egyptian Cobra as we'll read
[40:11] here in a moment now I might give us a
[40:13] lesson on this later we'll see
[40:14] maybe out in the fellowship room he'll
[40:16] tell us all about the size and the
[40:17] weight and
[40:21] how you can overcome it by God's grace
[40:23] the antidote that's what I'm thinking of
[40:24] the animal what's the antidote brother
[40:26] brother Malachi what do I got to pack in
[40:27] my
[40:28] uh my fanny pack
[40:32] but there's poison under your lips
[40:35] if we're not careful
[40:39] whose mouth is full of cursing right
[40:41] sometimes instead of blessing people
[40:43] what do we do curse them that's poison
[40:48] and bitterness instead of just freely oh
[40:50] I forgive that person I forgive that
[40:52] person that cut me off on the highway
[40:54] instead of instead of blessing them
[40:56] right or instead of being happy we get
[40:58] bitter with them
[41:02] their feet are Swift to shed blood so
[41:04] they're quickly going to get Vengeance
[41:05] I'm going to get them back
[41:08] I'm going to show them who's
[41:10] smart and who's got the right answers
[41:12] here
[41:13] here I'm going to show them who's the
[41:14] real good good who's the good person
[41:16] right I'm gonna show them who's right
[41:18] now here's here's the definition of ass
[41:20] okay so you can help us out with this
[41:21] one and Ash was the small and most
[41:23] venomous serpent the bite of which is
[41:25] fatal unless the bitten part immediately
[41:27] be cut away
[41:29] so you had to give away a body part if
[41:31] you were if you're bending on the arm
[41:32] but on the leg you ought to be an
[41:33] amputee
[41:34] apparently
[41:36] does that sound familiar America
[41:38] maybe okay
[41:41] this was probably the Egyptian cobra a
[41:44] small and very poisonous snake that
[41:45] dwells in the holes of the walls and a
[41:48] snake on which the serpent Charmers
[41:49] practice their art
[41:52] okay so anytime you're walking by a wall
[41:54] a serpent could pop out there and then
[41:57] it's life or death you better get it
[41:58] amputated or you're done
[42:00] it's going to spread all over right
[42:03] and this is what is spoken this is what
[42:06] the Bible says this is how we're born
[42:09] right we're born with poison under there
[42:11] and then every day we got to bring it
[42:13] under subjection so we don't curse
[42:15] people we don't get bitter towards
[42:17] people
[42:21] what did remember David
[42:23] David said he said I want to number the
[42:26] people he spoke that with his mouth
[42:28] and God despised it
[42:31] what did God do he killed seventy
[42:34] thousand look at the bite of the serpent
[42:36] brother awesome
[42:37] one man pridefully says I wouldn't know
[42:39] how many people are in My Kingdom and
[42:40] because he spoke that 70 000 people died
[42:44] Satan moved him to say that
[42:46] the Bible says
[42:49] now God was pouring out his judgment
[42:50] also on these the Israelites who were
[42:52] unfaithful to God
[42:54] God used that
[42:55] Sin from David to bring temporary
[42:58] judgment upon these people
[43:00] but look at that just saying I want to
[43:01] know how great I am I don't know how
[43:03] much
[43:03] I'm strong man I wouldn't know that just
[43:06] that just speaking something like that
[43:07] seems so harmless it brought death
[43:13] in church he'd already danced around
[43:14] like we said he'd already dance around
[43:16] the ark and worship God
[43:21] see so say person who's sanctified
[43:23] can still utter things
[43:26] that cause pain
[43:28] and especially preachers that's why
[43:29] they're going to be judged more harshly
[43:32] praise God
[43:33] it's almost 40 minutes all right
[43:35] goodness
[43:37] 70 000 people
[43:40] that that serpent had anointed Satan or
[43:44] anointed David and then David spoke
[43:46] death
[43:48] upon the people
[43:51] how about Peter Peter said I'll die with
[43:55] you I'll never deny you
[43:57] what happened he denied him three times
[44:00] and then when he finally realized that
[44:01] he went out and wept bitterly
[44:05] see we got to be careful I'm gonna do
[44:07] this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do this
[44:09] I'm gonna do that we better be careful
[44:11] I would never do this I would never say
[44:13] that you better be careful
[44:16] that might be the poison aspers coming
[44:18] out of our our mouth right the poisonous
[44:20] snake
[44:22] we gotta be very careful what we say
[44:25] that lie was right under Peter's tongue
[44:28] and he'd already walked on water
[44:31] he'd already had the keys to the kingdom
[44:32] I got the authority of the messiah's
[44:35] Kingdom I've got that Authority
[44:37] and yet he so quickly spoke something
[44:39] that was wrong
[44:41] may God help us praise God
[44:43] I'll never I'll never struggle with this
[44:45] I'll never have a problem with anybody
[44:47] in the church I always love everybody in
[44:49] the church
[44:52] my marriage is always going to be
[44:54] perfect
[45:01] I'm always going to be the best parent
[45:03] ever I'm never going to make my children
[45:04] ever have any trouble
[45:07] poison
[45:08] they're watching you
[45:10] they're watching me
[45:12] right you better be careful what we say
[45:15] because it might be prideful this case
[45:16] both both cases were Pride
[45:19] I'll never deny you
[45:21] right I want to know how great I am
[45:24] so see church is not just Sinners that
[45:26] sometimes say that all of us sometimes
[45:28] have a poison under
[45:30] if we're not careful
[45:33] praise God
[45:34] not a lot of shouts tonight but
[45:36] hopefully there's a couple of amens out
[45:37] there
[45:40] destruction and misery are in their ways
[45:43] everyone every person and the way of
[45:46] peace they have not known
[45:47] right so Sinners have no peace I don't
[45:50] care they try to drown it out with
[45:51] alcohol
[45:52] like I saw my uncle at the graduation
[45:54] party Austin asked me I got I get to
[45:56] witness yeah I got to witness a lot
[45:57] about Jesus at the graduation party but
[45:59] I was talking to my uncle and he said
[46:01] he said I said how you feeling I said he
[46:03] said well my hips are doing good he said
[46:04] but I'm still having pain because of my
[46:07] weight I can't lose weight I said well
[46:08] you know just came to me I said just got
[46:10] to stop eating sugar do you eat any
[46:11] sugar he's like oh yeah I drink rum
[46:15] there's a lot of sugar and rum alcohol
[46:16] he said I could never quit that I said
[46:19] yes you can
[46:21] right I said yes you can
[46:23] and you know what he said to me before
[46:24] we left he said pray for me so I've got
[46:26] to remember to pray for him so
[46:28] as a prayer request I forgot but God's
[46:30] grace
[46:31] but see he didn't have any peace he's
[46:33] never had peace since he was a young man
[46:35] he was
[46:36] in the military
[46:37] and he's running from Jesus Simon's had
[46:39] conversations with him he has no peace
[46:41] so I said drown it out with alcohol
[46:44] because he has no Peace church if only
[46:46] he could come to this service one time
[46:47] or go to Kansas one time and find his
[46:49] place at the altar brother Austin he
[46:51] never thirsts again hallelujah amen he
[46:54] never thirsts for a room again because
[46:56] he'd be satisfied with the Living Waters
[46:59] of the Holy Spirit praise God oh
[47:01] hallelujah praise God I never go back to
[47:04] Coronas brother Austin I never go back
[47:06] to chewing tobacco because I'm tasting
[47:08] something better it's the life of Jesus
[47:10] Christ it's eternal life Hallelujah
[47:13] I'll never thirst again Hallelujah
[47:16] amen praise God that woman at the well
[47:19] would never thirst for another man again
[47:21] you and I will never thirst for sin
[47:23] again Hallelujah to live in that way
[47:25] again because we met Jesus Christ
[47:27] because we received Grace Hallelujah
[47:30] amen
[47:32] there's no fear of God Before Their Eyes
[47:34] speaking of a sinner
[47:36] right when we when we have the fear of
[47:38] God what does it give us wisdom
[47:42] and then the Bible said also
[47:43] understanding if we have the fear of God
[47:45] to help us to understand our path
[47:47] understand our life
[47:51] now you know this we don't have to read
[47:53] all this
[47:54] but the Bible said in heaven they said
[47:55] who's worthy to take the book right
[48:00] and John was weeping because no one
[48:02] could take God's book of redemption and
[48:04] open it and show what the Seven Seals
[48:07] were think about that he was crying
[48:09] because he didn't he thought he'd never
[48:10] get to understand the Seven Seals but we
[48:13] understand and praise God hallelujah
[48:16] we understand him today
[48:19] right and then he's crying and all of a
[48:21] sudden they said weep not
[48:23] there's my 45 minutes
[48:24] all right
[48:28] somebody's playing around with my watch
[48:29] that's what I think it is somebody
[48:30] hacked my watch
[48:32] but he was crying and he was he was
[48:34] saying nobody's worthy now think about
[48:36] that church Noah wasn't worthy because
[48:38] he got drunk
[48:40] Adam wasn't worthy because he found the
[48:42] beginning
[48:43] Abraham wasn't worthy because he lied
[48:45] and he laughed at God thus saith the
[48:47] Lord
[48:48] he doubted God's word Isaac lied right
[48:51] Sarah laughed at God David uh murdered
[48:54] and was an adulterer Joseph even lied
[48:57] and you can go down through every Bible
[48:59] character and they were all unworthy
[49:02] nobody's worthy but finally a lamb steps
[49:05] forth as he was slain so we know the
[49:08] only one that's Worthy is someone who
[49:10] would sacrifice himself for other people
[49:13] praise God
[49:14] and church that's what we've got to
[49:16] learn to do live our lives as a Living
[49:18] Sacrifice unto Christ right
[49:21] a sacrifice unto God but we see here
[49:23] Jesus the only one Worthy is a man who
[49:27] was holy and he gave himself as a
[49:29] sacrifice praise God in other words he
[49:31] was worthy to loose the Seven Seals
[49:33] Hallelujah because he paid the price of
[49:36] redemption he met God's requirement
[49:38] praise God he took the wrath of God on
[49:41] him and therefore he's worthy praise God
[49:45] amen
[49:48] Hallelujah no man was found worthy
[49:52] there was no man even in the Hall of
[49:54] Fame of Faith there's no one Moses none
[49:55] of them Moses was a murderer
[49:59] Moses didn't circumcise his children
[50:00] right you would have died by an Angel
[50:04] no man was worthy only Jesus is Worthy
[50:08] praise God
[50:09] and he bought church he bought you with
[50:11] the price
[50:13] so therefore Church let's glorify God in
[50:15] our bodies and in our Spirits or Minds
[50:18] because they're Gods
[50:20] Hallelujah
[50:24] now Romans 3 19. I'm almost done here
[50:27] now we know that what things so ever the
[50:29] law saith is saith to them who are under
[50:31] the law
[50:34] the law had to be sent to somebody so if
[50:35] you have the law speaking to you that
[50:38] every mouth may be stopped and all the
[50:40] world may become guilty before God
[50:41] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[50:43] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[50:45] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[50:48] so the law explains what sin is and no
[50:51] flesh can keep all the law so all are
[50:54] guilty before God very simple right
[50:58] now we're done with part one now we can
[51:01] move on to part two
[51:04] we should have a little more joy now
[51:06] we're getting into part two praise God I
[51:08] appreciate it pretty hard right on the
[51:10] battles we go through
[51:12] we all battle with being a legalist are
[51:15] we all battle with uh Temptations right
[51:19] but now we move on
[51:21] here's how God is going to judge he's
[51:23] going to judge by justifying Believers
[51:25] by faith that is the solution for our
[51:28] guilt problem
[51:30] in other words sicilina none of us are
[51:33] ever going to be good enough for heaven
[51:34] we've got to believe in Christ's
[51:37] Sacrifice by faith
[51:38] well none of us can trust in our own
[51:40] Works to get there
[51:42] we've got to have confidence in the
[51:44] sacrifice of that lamb praise God
[51:47] the worthy one we have to trust in the
[51:49] worthy one praise God
[51:52] verse 21 now we're breaking this next
[51:54] section but now the righteousness of God
[51:56] without or apart from the law is
[51:59] Manifest being witnessed by the law and
[52:01] the prophets
[52:04] now all these prophets habakkuk Isaiah
[52:07] and Daniel and even uh the Psalms
[52:10] Prophet that might be David they all
[52:12] spoke that God was going to give us
[52:15] righteousness without even earning it
[52:19] all these prophets foretold God was
[52:22] going to give a gift of Grace that was
[52:25] unmerited God was going to be merciful
[52:28] and just forgive us by faith in his
[52:31] sacrifice
[52:33] amen praise God
[52:35] and it laid there for for 1500 years
[52:38] they had the law of Moses it laid there
[52:40] until Christ came and then Christ
[52:42] anointed to Paul and Paul brings out all
[52:45] these promises wow it was laying there
[52:46] the whole time I can't earn it I could
[52:49] never earn it someone had to pay the
[52:50] price for me and now I get the free gift
[52:53] of Jesus's righteousness praise God
[52:56] oh thank God hallelujah thank God
[53:03] amen
[53:04] for time's sake I don't think I'm going
[53:07] to read all those
[53:10] but also another note is the Old
[53:12] Testament also foretold the baptism of
[53:15] the Holy Ghost which was Christ in you
[53:17] the hope of glory it was foretold
[53:20] so your forgiveness was foretold and
[53:23] your feeling of the Holy Ghost was
[53:24] foretold praise God
[53:26] it was laying right there the whole time
[53:28] Joel wrote about it Jeremiah wrote about
[53:31] it and Ezekiel wrote about the permanent
[53:33] anointing of the baptism of the Holy
[53:36] Ghost Hallelujah
[53:38] Joel said it was God freely pouring out
[53:41] his Spirit upon Believers of all ages
[53:44] and Peter validated Joel by quoting him
[53:47] in Acts 2.
[53:49] so Joel said it Joel said God will pour
[53:51] out his spear like I preached that
[53:53] series I will pour out my spirit saith
[53:55] the Lord and he sure did over there in
[53:56] Napoleon but church he can still pour it
[53:58] out here tonight praise God
[54:00] Hallelujah we don't have to go back to
[54:01] Napoleon to get a fresh porn out
[54:03] Hallelujah we get a fresh blessing
[54:05] tonight praise God
[54:07] amen
[54:10] second Jeremiah said the baptism of the
[54:13] Holy Ghost was God writing his commands
[54:15] upon the hearts of his believing
[54:18] children praise God
[54:19] that's in Jeremiah 31 verse 33. he said
[54:23] in that day they won't just read the
[54:25] word he said but I will write my
[54:27] Commandments upon their hearts praise
[54:29] God
[54:30] in other words sister who you don't have
[54:32] to memorize the Bible so much it's
[54:34] already memorized in your soul praise
[54:36] God Hallelujah right right brother right
[54:39] sisters it's God's spirit wants to write
[54:41] it on your soul
[54:43] Hallelujah and yes we need to rehearse
[54:45] in our minds but the main thing is get
[54:47] God's word in your soul so that your
[54:49] nature is the nature of Christ
[54:51] Hallelujah
[54:52] and that your mind wants to agree with
[54:54] the nature in your soul your mind wants
[54:57] to do what you know is right in your
[54:58] soul praise God
[55:00] the Old Testament wrote about this it
[55:02] was laying there for 1500 years
[55:05] oh thank God and lastly Ezekiel 36
[55:09] is mentioned in Hebrews 8 10.
[55:12] where God's spirit within you would
[55:15] cause you to walk in God's statutes to
[55:18] keep them and do them
[55:21] so church it's not you and me it's not
[55:24] our strength that's obeying the word
[55:25] every day

[55:42] blessing what a tremendous anointing
[55:44] that we can have praise God what a what
[55:47] a reward that we have praise God just by
[55:49] surrendering and letting God have his
[55:51] way in our lives praise God
[55:53] oh what a blessing it was all foretold
[55:57] Hallelujah
[55:59] thank God
[56:01] how many more I got to go
[56:09] okay
[56:11] even the righteousness of God which is
[56:13] by faith of Jesus Christ upon all let's
[56:16] all say all ready oh and upon all say
[56:20] all again all it's unto and it's upon

[56:30] Hallelujah then God's grace God's rights
[56:34] is sent to you and God's righteousness
[56:37] is on you praise God
[56:39] amen that's why when our sister who was
[56:42] singing at the job those years ago she's
[56:43] singing about Jesus and then those two
[56:45] guys want to come to church
[56:47] see that's the righteousness of Christ
[56:49] on you sister that's God's righteousness
[56:52] and people see it
[56:53] praise God
[56:55] Hallelujah
[56:56] When We believe We glorify God when we
[56:59] believe we hear God's word hallelujah
[57:02] like we just had friends over last night
[57:04] and they said like so many people say
[57:06] they say your house is different that
[57:08] brother said I feel peace here
[57:10] he said I've been to a lot of homes he
[57:12] said I don't feel peace
[57:14] they only got two kids he said you got
[57:15] eight and I feel peace
[57:17] I said well that's just the grace of God
[57:18] I said that's my wife give my wife
[57:19] credit for that
[57:23] but he said your children are different
[57:24] he said you've done something different
[57:26] so I tried to tell him I said God sent
[57:27] brother Brandon
[57:29] I preach Brothers message it's a bible
[57:31] message
[57:32] I don't know if you heard that but try
[57:34] to tell me about it
[57:36] he said you wrote that book with a
[57:38] thousand Pages it's not a thousand it's
[57:40] 800.
[57:42] I said you wrote that I said yeah and I
[57:44] had to shorten it
[57:46] the guy had me I had to shorten it I'd
[57:49] take out numerous pages
[57:51] because the binding wouldn't fit
[57:53] and I said brother that's what brother I
[57:55] said that's what brothers Revelation did
[57:57] it tied the whole Bible together
[58:00] and now I can understand the Bible you
[58:02] know why because the Bible said the
[58:03] mystery of God had to be finished praise
[58:04] God so somebody's got to finish it
[58:07] hallelujah amen
[58:09] somebody had to do it
[58:10] and it's been revealed to me it's been
[58:13] revealed to you amen our eyes can see
[58:16] blessed are your eyes blessed are your
[58:18] ears for you can see and hear God's word
[58:21] amen
[58:22] there's no difference between Jew and
[58:24] Gentile
[58:26] right all all can have God's
[58:28] righteousness on them sister Emma you
[58:30] can have God's righteousness just like I
[58:32] can
[58:32] we both can
[58:34] you were raising the message I wasn't we
[58:36] can both have God's righteousness
[58:37] because we both we both fall short of
[58:39] God's glory and God knew that so God had
[58:41] to send one person to take all of our
[58:43] sins away
[58:44] because we both fell short I could have
[58:47] said that to anybody right
[58:49] doesn't matter it doesn't matter there's
[58:52] no difference
[58:53] we're all Sinners we've all sinned and
[58:56] the church said
[58:57] we've all sinned and we've come short of
[59:00] the glory of God
[59:01] there's no difference really between any
[59:03] of us we've all sinned and God made a
[59:06] way that you can be righteous
[59:10] being justified freely that's a free
[59:13] gift Hallelujah a free gift amen
[59:16] how many free gifts have we received
[59:18] brother Austin
[59:19] these last few years
[59:20] we've received a lot of free gifts
[59:23] well even better than the gifts we've
[59:25] received has been the grace of God we've
[59:27] received Hallelujah
[59:29] it's just freely given
[59:32] like this woman keeps email me I'm going
[59:33] to email her tonight again she asked can
[59:35] I wear this under my skirt when it's
[59:36] cold can I wear this can I wear that she
[59:38] said I just don't want to go to hell I
[59:39] just want to like
[59:40] share the sermon with her
[59:43] one sin is not going to keep you out of
[59:45] heaven
[59:46] faith is going to get you to heaven
[59:48] praise God
[59:50] and if you love God he'll guide you into
[59:52] all truth praise God
[59:56] and yes we want to dress modestly yes we
[59:58] don't want to cross dress yes we want to
[1:00:00] uh live holy we want to present
[1:00:02] ourselves as a holy way
[1:00:04] but one little mistake is not going to
[1:00:06] take away Jesus righteousness
[1:00:10] and if you're really sincere and ask God
[1:00:12] God's going to show you about that one
[1:00:14] question in your life
[1:00:17] one sin is not going to send me to hell
[1:00:19] because Jesus paid for all my sins
[1:00:21] brother Austin
[1:00:23] he didn't pay for 99 of them but he
[1:00:25] prayed for a hundred percent of them
[1:00:27] praise God
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:29] it's unto all and it's upon all who
[1:00:32] believe Jesus righteousness is upon your
[1:00:35] life praise God
[1:00:37] I'm trying to encourage you tonight by
[1:00:38] God's grace
[1:00:42] you are Justified freely
[1:00:44] without any cost you paid
[1:00:46] by his grace
[1:00:48] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[1:00:50] Jesus
[1:00:53] what a blessing
[1:00:56] whom God has set forth to be a
[1:00:57] propitiation a mercy seat
[1:00:59] through faith in his blood
[1:01:01] see Church we've only got to trust in
[1:01:03] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:05] have you ever seen that sometimes we
[1:01:07] have a song service or maybe amen
[1:01:09] usually it's with mine
[1:01:11] you know some of my songs we might not
[1:01:12] be into it but sometimes we'll turn to a
[1:01:15] song that's about the blood
[1:01:17] and that'll just change the whole thing
[1:01:21] there's a reason the songs about the
[1:01:23] blood to change the atmosphere
[1:01:25] because that's what we're saved by
[1:01:28] we are saved through faith in the blood
[1:01:31] when we sing about the blood all of us
[1:01:33] can say oh that's right I can't earn
[1:01:35] salvation Jesus paid for it
[1:01:38] and I can be happy about that because
[1:01:40] brother Jesse had to have the blood of
[1:01:42] Jesus shed for him just like I do praise
[1:01:44] God or brother random or Martin Luther
[1:01:47] or John Wesley whoever it is
[1:01:49] Donnie Reagan or whoever Cadre Diggs
[1:01:52] everybody everybody can rejoice in one
[1:01:55] thing the blood of Jesus Christ praise
[1:01:57] God
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] thank God
[1:02:01] and the blood declares Jesus's
[1:02:03] righteousness for the remission of sins
[1:02:05] that are passed through the fair
[1:02:07] forbearance of God
[1:02:10] see all your pastors think about that
[1:02:12] think about your past now what have you
[1:02:13] done that you're ashamed of in your past
[1:02:16] you don't have to worry about it trust
[1:02:18] in Jesus confess your sins and Jesus
[1:02:20] already paid for it
[1:02:22] he remits the sins of your past
[1:02:26] Hallelujah
[1:02:28] I love that song and goodness of God
[1:02:30] brother Austin my past sins are not
[1:02:32] running after me God's Mercy is running
[1:02:34] after me
[1:02:36] I'm not scared on one day my past is
[1:02:38] going to catch up with me or one day
[1:02:40] they're going to find what I did as a
[1:02:41] sinner online because it was 1999 you
[1:02:43] know or 2001.
[1:02:46] even if of course I would feel ashamed
[1:02:48] of my past
[1:02:50] but I've already got I've already
[1:02:51] promised a great future praise God
[1:02:54] my past has already been erased in the
[1:02:56] mind of God brother Austin it's already
[1:02:58] been forgiven praise God there's no
[1:03:00] record of it who can lay charge to me
[1:03:03] praise God Amen amen who can lay any
[1:03:05] charge to God's elect how many chosen by
[1:03:08] God today the word elect means chosen if
[1:03:10] God chose you there's no charge that
[1:03:12] Satan can put on you because Jesus
[1:03:14] righteousness already purchase your
[1:03:16] forgiveness praise God
[1:03:18] oh my
[1:03:20] Hallelujah
[1:03:22] thank you Jesus we ought to say
[1:03:24] hallelujah together let's say hallelujah
[1:03:25] can we Hallelujah
[1:03:28] to declare I say at this time there's my
[1:03:30] hour

[1:03:33] and the justifier of him which believeth
[1:03:35] in Jesus where is boasting them
[1:03:38] where's the preacher that's going to say
[1:03:40] I'm the greatest preacher of all time
[1:03:42] or I'm among them that's what they say
[1:03:44] today
[1:03:45] they haven't said it lately so I think I
[1:03:47] might have brought some correction to
[1:03:48] that I think I think I helped bring some
[1:03:50] correction out because I emailed one of
[1:03:51] the brothers and I haven't heard the
[1:03:53] other brother say it
[1:03:54] where's the boasting then it's excluded
[1:03:57] by what law can we boast on or what
[1:03:59] works no but by the law of Faith let's
[1:04:02] stand our feet I better stop I'm going
[1:04:03] to keep going I'll never stop it
[1:04:06] it's gonna be hard to stop musicians can
[1:04:08] come

[1:04:23] church I didn't get to it but I just
[1:04:24] want to just I'll just say it briefly
[1:04:27] we serve a god who's rich in Mercy
[1:04:32] we serve a God who pardons
[1:04:35] remember that scripture he's ready to
[1:04:37] part it

[1:05:14] own
[1:05:15] you can never pay that yeah that price

[1:05:25] who forgives
[1:05:28] we're talking about the God let me
[1:05:30] remind you
[1:05:33] who forgave the Gibby nights sister Emma
[1:05:35] of 400 years of sins
[1:05:38] God said I'm going to kill every
[1:05:41] nation in the Promised Land
[1:05:44] and I'm going to do it because I've let
[1:05:46] the cup of iniquity come up for 400
[1:05:48] years
[1:05:50] and God was ready to destroy them with
[1:05:52] Joshua but then they tricked Joshua
[1:05:56] and Joshua said you won't die by the
[1:05:58] name of the Lord
[1:06:00] and because Joshua spoke in the name of
[1:06:03] Lord and offered forgiveness of the
[1:06:05] giving nights God was so quick to Pardon
[1:06:07] I'll take 400 years think of all the
[1:06:09] sins I'll take 400 years of all you give
[1:06:11] me nights and I'll just toss him in the
[1:06:13] sea and forgetfulness that's the God we
[1:06:14] serve
[1:06:16] 400 years brother Austin of sins and
[1:06:20] iniquities

[1:06:36] that he said I'm ready to Pardon praise
[1:06:38] God
[1:06:43] we're talking about the God
[1:06:45] who resurrects
[1:06:47] Saints like like Moses
[1:06:52] we're talking about The God Who
[1:06:54] who took Moses's body from the Devil the
[1:06:57] devil said where is he sinned where's
[1:06:59] his body Michael where's his body
[1:07:02] Hallelujah
[1:07:03] and Michael just said the Lord rebuke
[1:07:06] you Satan
[1:07:07] God don't got to tell you what he did
[1:07:09] with Moses body
[1:07:11] but the devil's like well I tricked all
[1:07:13] Adam's race and I just that body's mine
[1:07:15] and and Michael said the Lord rebuke you
[1:07:19] we're talking about the God who don't
[1:07:21] have to give Satan what he wants amen

[1:07:52] all their sin brother sister and toss in
[1:07:55] the sea of forgetfulness
[1:07:57] he said and separate it as far as the
[1:08:00] East is from the West
[1:08:02] next time you find the East you let me
[1:08:04] know
[1:08:06] and then you go find the West you let me
[1:08:08] know where it's at
[1:08:11] right that's what the Bible says as far
[1:08:13] as the East is from the West
[1:08:15] can never find it really
[1:08:17] it's just Polar Opposites
[1:08:19] in other words God has separated your
[1:08:21] sin so far from you you'll never have to
[1:08:23] deal with it praise God
