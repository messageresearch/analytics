[15:05] I dread praise God thank you Jesus
[15:48] let's take a few prayer requests tonight
[15:51] by God's grace let's pray for little
[16:07] lily Anna's family
[16:08] she's a six year old who passed away
[16:10] this week from cancer we prayed really
[16:14] sincerely I know when we were up at
[16:18] brother Samuel we had all the ministers
[16:20] come up and pray for the cloth and if we
[16:22] if I ever prayed a sincere prayer that
[16:24] was the time we prayed a sincere prayer
[16:26] and just kept getting worse than she had
[16:29] seizures last week right and then passed
[16:31] away on Sunday was his Sunday night
[16:35] Sunday seven times so that was really
[16:38] hard I can't imagine how hard at his
[16:42] six-year-old passed away but let's
[16:43] remember her family in prayer heard her
[16:46] father was raising the message but
[16:48] doesn't follow it but let's pray that
[16:50] he'll you find the Lord through this
[16:54] situation
[17:00] any other prayer requests let's pray for
[17:23] the both the father and the son that the
[17:32] idea there goes hey a man is pretty for
[17:36] Christopher
[17:36] I haven't heard back from bang where we
[17:41] prayed Sunday night but let's remember
[17:43] he and James in prayer brother bang had
[17:46] back pain again
[17:47] he's pray for his back pain there was an
[17:56] unspoken request from a brother it was
[17:58] text me he doesn't know this church but
[18:00] it's kind of a personal situation so
[18:02] let's remember an unspoken need in
[18:05] prayer I told him I'd pray for him
[18:07] there's someone he was concerned about
[18:09] within his church who hasn't been coming
[18:10] to church and so I reached out to that
[18:13] individual it seems like everything's
[18:17] okay but let's just remember them in
[18:18] prayer tonight by God's grace a
[18:28] testimony seems like we had a testimony
[18:30] this week or something seem like a it's
[18:33] really encouraged about something I
[18:34] can't remember I have to think about
[18:39] let's bow our heads here praise the Lord
[18:41] we'll just thank the Lord for the
[18:42] testimony of serving the Lord this week
[18:44] praise God God is so good so merciful we

[27:29] crazy let's stand and get right to the
[27:31] Word of God I want to be careful time
[27:34] here by God's grace let's go to John
[27:36] chapter seven like to continue on
[27:39] understanding the so I'll just call it
[27:40] the soul tonight we looked at part four
[27:43] on Sunday night and then I looked to
[27:45] like to look at par five tonight by
[27:47] God's grace John chapter
[28:01] verse 37 familiar scripture here John
[28:20] 7:37 well I'm sorry we got to our memory
[28:24] verse pardon me so let's go to you
[28:25] yeah is this you're not working really
[28:28] it's not working
[28:32] I've got the green light on and
[28:34] everything okay okay so it's not the mic
[28:37] it's that all right thank you yeah I'm
[28:42] sorry so let's go to Revelation 3:20
[28:44] sorry that's the relation 3:20
[28:58] [Music]
[29:08] revelation 3:20 praise God is trying to
[29:11] memorize this all right let's read that
[29:18] on three one two three
[29:21] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[29:25] any man hear my voice and open the door
[29:29] I will come in to him and will sup with
[29:33] him and he with me praise the Lord let's
[29:36] go to John 7 then 37 sorry about that I
[29:48] always look at the soul tonight I kind
[29:50] of wanna look at this thought about how
[29:53] the baptism of Holy Ghost could not be
[29:55] given till Jesus was glorified and I'm
[29:57] gonna look at some other examples I
[29:58] don't know I don't have any quotes or
[30:01] slides so case you don't worry about
[30:02] that maybe just pulling up scripture
[30:04] would be good John 7:37 the Bible says
[30:08] in the last day that great day of the
[30:10] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[30:12] any man thirst let him come unto me
[30:14] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[30:19] scripture has said out of his belly
[30:20] shall flow rivers of living water but
[30:25] this spake he of the spirit which they
[30:27] that believe on him should receive for
[30:30] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[30:32] that Jesus was not yet glorified amen
[30:36] let's have a word of Prayer if you have
[30:37] a need on your heart let's just raise
[30:38] our hands to heaven or our hearts to
[30:40] heaven let's ask the Lord to minister to
[30:42] our needs help us tonight
[30:43] father we bow our heads we love you have
[30:46] any father we ask you bless this reading
[30:47] of thy word you're the only one that can
[30:49] interpret it so Lord break it to our
[30:51] hearts and nor let it feed our souls
[30:53] tonight Lord as we saw Lord where we're
[30:56] feeling thirst from both sides nor the
[30:58] flesh and then the soul tonight's the
[31:00] time Lord to feed that thirst in the
[31:02] soul let us pull upon the word believe
[31:04] the word receive the word and Lord let
[31:07] it go to action our lives it's quick
[31:09] it's powerful it's more active than
[31:12] anything Lord it's sharper than a
[31:14] double-edged sword
[31:15] so father let the word of God be quick
[31:17] and powerful in our lives tonight and we
[31:19] thank you for your mercy and grace bless
[31:20] each and every heart in Jesus Christ's
[31:23] name the church said Amen god bless your
[31:26] being seated praise God so we like to
[31:38] look at this thought here and continue
[31:43] looking at the soul and I want to just
[31:47] start with John 7 and I got some notes
[31:50] here as I said on Sunday I'm preaching
[31:53] from the chapter I wrote on this already
[31:56] and I think it's really helpful because
[32:00] a lot of it was new to me
[32:02] there are still a scores of Old
[32:06] Testament Scriptures that I want to
[32:08] preach and get through where it talks
[32:10] about the soul specifically about the
[32:12] soul and they would seem confusing
[32:15] without the revelation of the baptism of
[32:17] the holy ghost today and so as we read
[32:20] them Lord willing in the future they'll
[32:22] be able to give us a better
[32:23] understanding because remember you have
[32:25] three parts and you and I in our minds
[32:27] tonight right now
[32:28] in the human spear right where we're
[32:30] conscious were awake right are human
[32:33] spirits active right now are not our
[32:36] subconscious but our conscious is active
[32:37] right now and we feel a thirst if you
[32:39] didn't get enough to eat before service
[32:41] and you're feeling the hunger of your
[32:43] body but if you're satisfied there then
[32:46] then we should feel the the thirst of
[32:49] our soul praise God
[32:50] David had that thirst and he said I
[32:52] thirst for the Living God in the
[32:54] sanctuary of God and so we want to feel
[32:58] that bout by God's grace we want to feel
[33:00] the thirst in the soul and we got to
[33:02] feed that if we don't feed it it becomes
[33:05] quieter and quieter and quieter right
[33:07] just like if you fast or if you don't
[33:10] eat right you know people can go days
[33:11] and days and days and you know my wife
[33:14] was telling me about a woman who was
[33:15] doing it online and fasting for days and
[33:18] days and days just drinking water and
[33:20] it's hard the first few days but after
[33:22] that person got used to it because it
[33:25] gets quiet that that thirst that cry
[33:28] gets quiet and we don't want that to
[33:30] happen in the soul we don't want to miss
[33:32] one day I know there's days we have hard
[33:34] days but we don't want to miss one day
[33:35] where that voice gets a little a little
[33:38] more quiet we don't want that we want to
[33:40] hear that urge oh I need to spend time
[33:42] with the Lord today I need to pray and I
[33:44] need to sing to God I've been doing that
[33:46] more this week I've been singing in my
[33:47] prayer closet and it's been a good
[33:49] encouragement throughout to start the
[33:51] day because David said in the morning
[33:53] you'll hear my song praise God
[33:55] so I've been singing little songs my
[33:57] voice doesn't sound any better in the
[33:59] morning it sounds worse it sounds bad if
[34:01] you think it sounds bad during song
[34:02] meaning boy sounds a lot worse than the
[34:05] morning in the prayer cause but I know
[34:06] in my heart I know God's not looking at
[34:08] that he just wants to hear something
[34:10] from my heart praise God he wants that a
[34:12] burning fire of incense that prayer that
[34:15] song that love and devotion to come up
[34:17] praise God to heaven and so we hear both
[34:21] both tonight we hear or we feel the the
[34:24] cries maybe the flesh but we also hear
[34:26] the thirst or the needs of the soul
[34:29] tonight that nature and we saw on Sunday
[34:32] night that the nature actually directs
[34:35] your way so you look at the last decade
[34:38] of your life or the less whenever you
[34:40] say you got born again that soul
[34:42] well nature should be pointing your
[34:45] direction it should be guiding you and
[34:47] Jesus said if you're born again it'll
[34:49] guide you into all truth so your path or
[34:53] your walk with God should be getting
[34:55] more to the scripture all the time if
[34:58] you're born again because the nature it
[35:00] directs your way it points your way and
[35:03] so that's what we should see in our
[35:05] lives now I want to start there in John
[35:10] 7 again because I think there's full
[35:13] Bible authority to say that John 7 39 it
[35:19] it creates a dividing line between the
[35:22] temporary anointing of the Old Testament
[35:25] which is on the flesh and the spirit
[35:27] only but now we get the permanent
[35:31] anointing in the New Testament and that
[35:33] creates the dividing line because Jesus
[35:35] said or the Bible said it was not yet
[35:37] given till Jesus was glorified so that
[35:41] is the great dividing line once the day
[35:43] of Pentecost come now the believers
[35:45] could have more than a temporary noin
[35:47] ting now they could have a permanent
[35:49] that's what a lot of people still to
[35:51] this day don't understand like I told
[35:54] you there's many different preachers I
[35:55] like I listen to that their teachers but
[35:58] they don't believe the message and I and
[36:00] I'll listen like their thoughts on you
[36:02] know the will of God or the soul of God
[36:03] or different or the covenants of God and
[36:06] I'll get great inspiration but even
[36:08] great men like this that are followed by
[36:10] millions of people even they can't
[36:12] understand that there's three parts to
[36:15] man and even they even they can't
[36:19] understand these words in the Bible that
[36:22] plainly say the New Testament something
[36:25] different the New Testament had to be
[36:27] something more and what it had was more
[36:31] power what I had was more anointing and
[36:35] a permanent increse God that's what the
[36:38] New Testament had that the Old Testament
[36:40] lacked so John 739 says the Holy Ghost
[36:46] is not given till Jesus was glorified
[36:47] acts 1:5 Jesus said you'll receive power
[36:52] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[36:54] you praise God
[36:56] he's telling his disciples some of them
[36:58] Peters walked on water already right
[37:01] they've all cast out devils they've all
[37:03] healed the sick they've all gone in the
[37:06] cities and preached he's telling them
[37:07] I'm gonna give you power and when you
[37:10] get that power he said I'll be in
[37:11] Jerusalem and you'll be power you have
[37:13] power to be a witness unto me because
[37:16] before that they would run when it came
[37:18] to being arrested when they were gonna
[37:20] get arrested they would run away and
[37:21] they wouldn't be arrested for the Word
[37:23] of God when Jesus was being arrested but
[37:29] after get they get the Holy Ghost they
[37:32] have the power to stand up and let me
[37:34] say this carefully if God wanted them to
[37:37] be arrested right because not every time
[37:41] to God want them to be arrested remember
[37:43] the Bible said they fleed out of I think
[37:46] Jerusalem right and God was using
[37:49] persecution to drive spread them out
[37:52] right so not every time does God want
[37:55] Christians be arrested sometimes he
[37:57] wants them to escape arrest like member
[37:59] Paul many times was he was kept from
[38:01] being arrested he was kept by being
[38:03] caught by the Jews one time is his
[38:05] nephew helped him to get out of the the
[38:08] castle from the basket right out of the
[38:10] window but then there was times where he
[38:13] did get arrested and it was the will of
[38:14] God and some of those times he got the
[38:16] right part of this Bible that we read
[38:18] tonight by God's grace because all
[38:20] things work together for good to them
[38:22] that love the Lord and then on the day
[38:27] of Pentecost acts 2:4 the Bible said
[38:29] they were all full of the Holy Ghost and
[38:32] began to speak with tongues as the
[38:33] Spirit gave them utterance so if you
[38:39] take those three scriptures John 7 39
[38:41] acts 1:5 and acts 2:4 you can clearly
[38:44] see that the dividing line of the
[38:47] temporary and permanent anointing was on
[38:49] the day of Pentecost now Jesus plainly
[38:52] says this again so go to John 12 23 can
[38:55] you pull it up there acacia John 12 23
[39:01] so Jesus
[39:03] just could not send the holy ghost so he
[39:05] was glorified in a glorified body John
[39:08] 12:23 now we're gonna read 23 24 and 25
[39:11] and jesus answered them saying the hours
[39:13] come that the Son of man should be
[39:15] glorified and this is right before his
[39:18] arrest
[39:19] verse 24 verily verily I say to you
[39:24] except the corn of wheat fall into the
[39:25] ground and dies what's he speaking of
[39:27] his own death in a bite of the loan but
[39:30] if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[39:31] next Scripture for he that loveth his
[39:36] life shall lose it and he that hateth
[39:38] his life in this world shall keep it
[39:40] unto life eternal praise God so that's
[39:44] beautiful right Jesus saying when I die
[39:46] I'm a seed and I'm gonna rise again amen
[39:51] huh me know you are too when you die
[39:54] when a Christian dies it's like a seed
[39:57] being planted praise God and that seed
[40:00] has to die in rot until it's quick and
[40:04] praise God now we'll get to this later
[40:06] but it's not the seed in it's not the
[40:08] the nucleus of the seat it's the outside
[40:11] that has to die and rot the shell amen
[40:15] praise God it's the shell that's got to
[40:17] die and rot this body right that's the
[40:21] part that Jesus says it's got to die and
[40:23] rot and then when the seed has brought
[40:26] forth when its quicken it becomes so
[40:28] much more beautiful praise God amen
[40:31] hallelujah thank the Lord Jesus saying
[40:34] I've got to die it's almost my time to
[40:37] be glorified praise God
[40:40] now there's two more scriptures that
[40:43] place
[40:44] Jesus's glorification after his
[40:47] resurrection
[40:49] so John 1216 let's read that one there
[40:54] John 1216 earlier in the same chapter
[41:01] now verse
[41:03] these things understood not his
[41:05] disciples at first this is speaking of
[41:07] when when they were saying Hosanna
[41:09] Hosanna in the highest but when Jesus
[41:13] was glorified then remembered they that
[41:16] these things were written of him and
[41:17] that they had done these things unto him
[41:21] so see there's other scriptures that
[41:23] prove the disciples didn't understand
[41:26] many things Jesus said till after the
[41:28] resurrection so Jesus was not glorified
[41:31] or putting a glorified body till after
[41:33] his resurrection see the Holy Ghost
[41:36] cannot be given till Jesus's body was
[41:39] glorified amen
[41:41] now John 2:22 that says the same thing
[41:43] here John 2:22 John 2:22 can you pull it
[41:51] up there hon thank you when therefore he
[41:55] was risen from the dead his disciples
[41:56] remembered that he had said this unto
[41:59] them and they believed the scripture and
[42:01] the word which Jesus had said praise
[42:04] gods that proves again that Jesus they
[42:08] understood Jesus words after he was
[42:10] raised and in a glorified body there's
[42:12] one more Acts 3:13 I'm gonna give you a
[42:14] good workout tonight acacia your fingers
[42:16] and wrists are gonna get a good workout
[42:18] acts 3:13 here the Bible says that Jesus
[42:23] had already been glorified the God of
[42:27] Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob the god
[42:29] of Our Fathers hath glorified His Son
[42:31] Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied
[42:33] him in the presence of Pilate when he
[42:35] was determined to let him go praise God
[42:37] so here the Bible said God glorified His
[42:41] Son Jesus how'd he do it by raising his
[42:44] body from the dead and give him a
[42:46] glorified body that's how he did it
[42:49] praise God
[42:53] thank the Lord now if you would case you
[42:57] pull up Luke 3:16 now Jesus gave the
[43:03] promise he said you shall be baptized
[43:05] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[43:07] in acts 1:5 and this is what this is
[43:12] what John the Baptist was talking about
[43:13] he said John answered and sang unto them
[43:16] all I indeed bat
[43:17] you with water but one mightier than I
[43:20] come at that the latchet of whose shoes
[43:23] I'm not worthy to loose he shall baptize
[43:25] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[43:28] amen
[43:29] sowhat's which baptism is John talking
[43:32] about the flesh no is he talking about
[43:35] the human spirit
[43:36] no because they already had that
[43:37] remember BES allele remember Micah said
[43:39] I'm full of the Holy Ghost see Jesus had
[43:43] to have a greater baptism than anything
[43:46] John could give what by water and of
[43:48] course anything greater than the Old
[43:49] Testament or else why would we need a
[43:51] New Testament what good is a New
[43:53] Testament the Old Testament already had
[43:55] the Holy Ghost baptism so see it had to
[43:58] be John was saying Jesus is gonna give
[44:01] you a soul baptism you've already got a
[44:03] mind baptism right like Bezalel and
[44:06] Joseph and all the ones we went through
[44:07] on Sunday you've already got that he
[44:09] said but I'm gonna give you a soul
[44:11] baptism now I'll pull up x-15 there
[44:13] Acacia 10 days before the Holy Ghost
[44:18] fell jesus said for John truly baptized
[44:21] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[44:23] the Holy Ghost not many days hence Amen
[44:27] I love this Jesus is the one who started
[44:29] the doctrine on the baptism of the Holy
[44:31] Ghost praise God he's the one those are
[44:33] actually red letter words and your Bible
[44:35] praise God Jesus that other you know
[44:38] some people are so scared to use it
[44:39] especially denominational they don't
[44:40] like to talk about they just talk about
[44:42] people getting saved and baptized in
[44:44] water but Jesus saying I'm giving you
[44:47] more than water baptism I'm giving you a
[44:49] soul baptism I'm gonna baptize your
[44:53] nature with my life amen
[44:55] hallelujah that's what get to next time
[44:57] maybe we're willing next Wednesday it's
[45:01] the nature that needs baptized praise
[45:05] God
[45:05] it's not the flesh the flesh gets
[45:07] baptized and it still corrupts it still
[45:10] dies it's not even the human sphere does
[45:12] get baptized from time to time right our
[45:14] thinking's got to be renewed should get
[45:16] baptized I guess everyday but then it
[45:18] backsides right I was I mean so
[45:22] disappointing the last few years of my
[45:23] life I used to be so zealous I would
[45:25] just love this study right away because
[45:26] in my mind I would love it but in the
[45:29] last year's I get older and tired
[45:30] and sometimes doesn't want to study I
[45:32] used to I used to never have that
[45:34] problem but now I got that problem
[45:37] because I got getting older and getting
[45:39] tired and and my mind is weary
[45:42] maybe I don't rest enough that's
[45:43] probably it but the point is I not I
[45:47] didn't always have that problem it now
[45:48] it's part of something I have to battle
[45:50] but Jesus saying I'm gonna I'm gonna
[45:53] give you a baptism in your soul praise
[45:55] God and this baptism your nature will be
[45:59] quickened by the Spirit of God
[46:04] now that's Bible truth now if you would
[46:08] let's go to Colossians 2:16 now I'm
[46:11] gonna read 16 to 22 Colossians 2:16 2:22
[46:14] I want to follow up on this
[46:16] I didn't read all of it on Sunday night
[46:17] because I wanted to preserve the time
[46:18] and I'm glad I did because I was really
[46:21] tired this week cuz I had to song Lee
[46:23] both services and preschool services the
[46:25] boy was I tired on Monday Colossians
[46:27] 2:16 so that confirmed to me I need to
[46:29] be careful now Colossians 2:16 I told
[46:40] you I had a good quote I want to read
[46:41] with you so let's read this first here
[46:43] let no man judge you in meat or in drink
[46:46] or in respect of a holy day or of a new
[46:49] moon or of the Sabbath days now let's
[46:52] stop right there
[46:52] all these are Christian liberties some
[46:55] people eat meat some people don't some
[46:56] people drink wine some people don't I
[46:59] would say no but that's me
[47:01] some people have holier days than others
[47:03] some people are more in the message
[47:05] they're more sincere about Easter than
[47:06] maybe Thanksgiving or maybe Christmas if
[47:11] some people have more respect for
[47:12] certain days the new moon or Sabbath
[47:16] days right some people are real zealous
[47:17] about the Sabbath but those things are
[47:20] shadow of things to come but the body is
[47:25] of Christ now verse then let no man
[47:28] let's go to verse 18 there then no man
[47:31] beguile you of your reward and voluntary
[47:33] humility see they're so humble with the
[47:35] right people can seem so humble and
[47:38] worshipping of angels of the paw even
[47:41] saw people that were so humble maybe
[47:43] Jews here they were
[47:44] so humble supposedly but yet worshipped
[47:47] angels intruding into those things which
[47:50] he have not seen vainly puffed up in his
[47:52] fleshly mine eyes that hum that
[47:54] interesting they got voluntary humility
[47:56] fake humility yet they're puffed up in
[47:58] their minds they just act so humble but
[48:01] if you get on their program sounds like
[48:03] a cat if you pet a cat the right way oh
[48:05] he likes it but if you go against his
[48:07] hair he hates it you go backward against
[48:10] his hair
[48:11] Lauretta that's how that's how it is
[48:12] when you attack certain attacking their
[48:14] doctrine he said in the fleshly mind and
[48:19] not holding the head from which all of
[48:22] the body of joints and bands having
[48:25] nourishment ministered and knit together
[48:27] increase with the increase of God so see
[48:30] they hold up their own Creed's and are
[48:32] their own ideas rather than holding up
[48:34] Christ the word wherefore if you'd be
[48:37] dead with Christ from the rudiments of
[48:38] the world why as next verse though
[48:42] living in the world are you subject to
[48:44] ordinances touch not taste not handle
[48:46] not see heirs of Liberty which are to
[48:49] perish with the using after the
[48:51] commandments and doctrines of men next
[48:54] verse I'm gonna read this in the whole
[48:57] context you can see it xx yeah which
[49:01] things have indeed a show of wisdom in
[49:03] here's where I want to go will worship
[49:05] and humility and neglecting of the body
[49:08] not in any honor to the satisfying of
[49:11] the flesh now the whole point of that
[49:15] whole thing was to get the context of
[49:17] will worship so worshipping angels or
[49:21] thinking you're more holy because you
[49:23] you know you're taking Easter more
[49:25] seriously or let's say oh it's another
[49:28] day I know message people that celebrate
[49:31] a feast of tabernacles in September and
[49:33] they get real spiritual or the feast of
[49:38] Pentecost in May right piece of
[49:39] Pentecost is in May or they get real
[49:41] spiritual on the feast of Pentecost
[49:43] that's the day the Holy Ghost fell but
[49:45] the Bible says that's that's their own
[49:48] Liberty right but they'll receive the
[49:50] reality is every day should be holy for
[49:53] a Christian now I know there's certain
[49:55] days yeah you might consider a more
[49:57] spiritual but that's
[49:58] fine you got your own liberty but Paul
[50:01] says you know the people that go wrong
[50:02] they worship angels you know they make
[50:05] false commandments and all these things
[50:07] see they have a wisdom in will worship
[50:10] and this means they're worshipping
[50:13] according to their own will right like I
[50:18] believe a common example is like we've
[50:20] seen lately is people that will worship
[50:22] brother Branham or they'll send their
[50:25] ties only to Jeffersonville that's their
[50:27] own will the Bible doesn't say that the
[50:30] Bible says to pay it to the pastor right
[50:32] the fivefold ministry 1st Corinthians 9
[50:34] says that but see it's their own will
[50:36] and God will let you worship however you
[50:39] will right
[50:40] God's not gonna force you to worship
[50:42] according to the commandments of God he
[50:45] was gonna he's going to offer to you but
[50:47] he as Paul says he lets them worship
[50:49] according to their own will because the
[50:51] will is in the soul that's what I want
[50:55] to say I want to just make that plain
[50:57] your will because Jesus had not my will
[50:59] that's flesh but thy will be done so
[51:04] you're in your human spirit and you got
[51:05] to do either the will the flesh or you
[51:07] got to do the will of the soul right of
[51:10] God's will and you want to do the will
[51:12] of God from your soul but Paul says they
[51:17] would have will worship they worship
[51:19] according to what they want to do now
[51:21] here's the court I want to read from
[51:23] victory day this is what I mentioned on
[51:26] Sunday night biting a chance to read it
[51:28] but man never gives the inside man a
[51:31] chance to explain what is right
[51:33] therefore that's what causes the trouble
[51:35] watch we find if he doesn't do it then
[51:39] what happens we find that his temper
[51:41] like Cain got up see right quit now we
[51:44] better be careful we got tempers he was
[51:48] jealous he didn't like God to offer his
[51:51] to accept Cain or Abel sacrifice instead
[51:54] of his he wanted to go to he wanted his
[51:57] own sacrifice he wanted his own way see
[52:00] now he cuts this fear instead of coming
[52:04] over to Abel and saying oh my brother
[52:06] I'm so happy that God has accepted you
[52:10] now we got away
[52:12] that we know that Jehovah accepts this
[52:14] way because he's proved it by receiving
[52:17] our sacrifice wouldn't that bend the
[52:19] thing to be done instead of that he got
[52:22] jealous now don't you see the same thing
[52:25] today in men it's just his way see now
[52:28] instead of accepting the way that God
[52:31] vindicates to be the truth
[52:33] hey man isla de hija in that beautiful
[52:37] cane should have looked over saw the
[52:40] fire fall and he should have follows
[52:42] knees and said praise God we know how to
[52:44] worship the right way all they got to do
[52:47] is worship like my brother but instead
[52:50] he got mad and he did his own will he
[52:53] said I'm gonna worship with fruit and
[52:55] vegetables because it was will worship
[52:57] right it was his own will that he
[52:59] worship with he should have got happy
[53:02] and searched we should get happy when we
[53:03] see somebody get blessing the Holy
[53:05] Spirit we should get happy and we hear
[53:07] about a church having signs wonders and
[53:10] miracles we should be happy for them
[53:11] praise God if you if you hear a
[53:14] revelation or something like that
[53:15] somebody cares a revelation you should
[53:17] be happy for them not jealous
[53:19] you should be happy praise God that
[53:20] should make you want to say praise God I
[53:23] want to study that out a little bit more
[53:25] I've seen it numerous times over the
[53:27] course of being a message believer
[53:29] here's one example like I'll see brother
[53:32] Donny Reagan talked about the two kinds
[53:34] of the word one was the Rhema of the
[53:36] revelation word and I can't remember the
[53:38] other one well after he preached at
[53:40] church
[53:40] I heard all kinds of different preachers
[53:42] preaching that thought but that's a good
[53:44] thing to do
[53:45] I like that instead of getting mad that
[53:47] you know God gave brother Donnie
[53:48] revelation they they started preaching
[53:50] it and they started enjoying it
[53:51] themselves
[53:52] hey I like that praise God that's a good
[53:55] thing to do if someone gets a revelation
[53:57] say praise the Lord God wanted it for
[53:59] everybody not just for one church but
[54:02] God can use that revelation to encourage
[54:04] other people praise God amen we should
[54:07] be so happy if we see God accepting
[54:10] other worshipers praise God and if our
[54:12] lives are not a worshipping according to
[54:15] the will of God let's get our lives
[54:17] lined up praise God amen like the Bible
[54:21] says if we're a body of believers we
[54:23] should be sad with those who are sad and
[54:25] then
[54:25] but we should rejoice with those who
[54:27] rejoice hallelujah so that was a good
[54:34] thought I really love that quote that's
[54:35] from a Victory Day 63 he should have
[54:40] been happy if someone gets a revelation
[54:43] if someone gets saved we should be happy
[54:45] for them praise God somebody gets the
[54:47] Holy Ghost don't be sad about be happy
[54:48] thank the Lord praise God someone was
[54:51] born again they got a revelation praise
[54:54] God all right now let's pick up next I
[55:03] want to go back to Luke 1 where John the
[55:09] Baptist his mom and dad all got filled
[55:11] with the Holy Ghost but we know that
[55:13] could not have been the soul because
[55:15] Jesus was not yet glorified so I want to
[55:18] go back to that thought cuz I never
[55:19] finished that one now if we weigh those
[55:24] things I believe it was Luke 1:15 I said
[55:31] and he shall be filled with the Holy
[55:32] Ghost even from his mother's womb the
[55:35] Bible said that about John now that
[55:38] could have been in his mind right that
[55:39] could have been on his body but it could
[55:42] not have been on his soul because his
[55:43] sins weren't yet forgiven by the blood
[55:45] of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was not
[55:48] yet glorified so John the Baptist as a
[55:51] baby could not have been sealed yet
[55:54] because it wasn't given yet because
[55:56] remember Jesus even said he that's least
[55:58] in the kingdom the New Testament is
[56:00] greater than John how many more that
[56:02] scripture every one remember that
[56:03] scripture he that's least in the New
[56:07] Testament is greater than John and Jesus
[56:09] said up to that point nobody greater had
[56:11] been born than John so Jesus wasn't
[56:15] talking about as far as like someone's
[56:17] greater but someone was that nobody
[56:19] whatever they weren't forgiven in the
[56:21] way that we're forgiven by the blood of
[56:23] Christ amen
[56:24] they're under the blood of bulls and
[56:26] goats but we're under the spotless blood
[56:28] of Jesus Christ amen that's what that
[56:31] means
[56:31] not that we're better than John who do
[56:34] you think you're better than John you
[56:35] think you've got the wilderness and live
[56:36] closer to God than John the Baptist
[56:39] I doubt it that's a that's quite a thing
[56:44] it's quite a thing to say that so we
[56:48] have to weigh all these you know Luke
[56:49] chapter one a baby getting the Holy
[56:51] Ghost
[56:52] Elizabeth getting the Holy Ghost
[56:54] Zacharias get the Holy Ghost bezu Leo
[56:56] all Joseph all these ones you gotta
[56:58] weigh them with that dividing line of
[57:01] John 7 39 acts 1:5 and acts 2:38
[57:04] I'm sorry acts 2:4 sorry and then when
[57:10] you weigh that with that you can see
[57:12] that the Holy Ghost cannot be given
[57:14] until acts 2:4 let's go to Matthew 11 -
[57:20] okay sure Matthew 11 verse 2 this is
[57:25] probably familiar but let's read it
[57:27] again now when John had heard in the
[57:32] prison the works of Christ he sent two
[57:34] of his disciples next verse and said
[57:37] unto Him art thou he that should come or
[57:40] do we look for another
[57:42] here is a prophet a man of God right
[57:46] John the Baptist a man of God who saw
[57:49] the Holy Spirit descend and remain on
[57:53] Christ he told his disciples go follow
[57:56] him he's the Messiah he said behold the
[57:58] lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[58:00] the world but he gets in prison and
[58:02] because of the probably the beatings and
[58:03] the starvation and the stress of prison
[58:06] life he asked his disciples said goats
[58:09] see Jesus and ask him is he the Messiah
[58:11] or should we look for another so see
[58:14] Church that proves the stress of life
[58:17] the pain and agony and suffering of life
[58:19] sometimes is enough to make a prophet
[58:22] even doubt his experience with God so
[58:28] see know that this and this is important
[58:30] because experiences can never be placed
[58:32] above the word he had experienced he saw
[58:36] it he had experience he baptized God's
[58:38] son he baptized his cousin but he
[58:41] couldn't put experience above the word
[58:43] amen that's what a lot of people do
[58:46] today they put experience above the word
[58:47] well because I went down to the altar
[58:49] and I prayed I know I'm okay with God
[58:51] it's okay that I
[58:53] continue going this direction in my life
[58:54] and it might be the wrong direction well
[58:58] I know my mom was a good person know my
[59:00] dad was a good person I know my brother
[59:01] he's a real man of God so I so I and
[59:04] I've had experience and he told me I was
[59:06] saved and my grandma told me I was
[59:08] filled the Holy Ghost so I must be no
[59:10] you can't put an experience above the
[59:11] Word of God we must line up all of our
[59:15] lives we must examine ourselves to see
[59:17] whether we're in the faith even a
[59:22] prophet could doubt his experience his
[59:25] vision he could doubt his vision as we
[59:27] said with brother Branham he could doubt
[59:29] that the vision was even fulfilled
[59:31] because of the stress and pains of life
[59:39] now remember acts I'm sorry not acts
[59:41] Matthew 7:21 jesus said many so say Lord
[59:47] Lord have we not cast out devils done
[59:49] mighty wonderful works in your name and
[59:51] cheese will say I never knew you depart
[59:53] from me ye that work iniquity so this
[59:56] scripture shows God's anointing is was
[59:59] temporary and that was eventually lost
[1:00:03] they had the anointing to do miracles
[1:00:06] but they eventually lost it because they
[1:00:08] worked iniquity so this proves their
[1:00:14] anointing was only temporary
[1:00:16] it wasn't permanent it wasn't in the
[1:00:18] soul he imagined being so anointed of
[1:00:24] God in your mind and your body and see
[1:00:25] miracles let's let's just say they saw
[1:00:29] people come out of wheelchairs they saw
[1:00:31] the paralyzed walk they would see that
[1:00:33] and yet sell that out so they could
[1:00:35] enjoy the pleasures of this life can you
[1:00:38] imagine that how awful that would be but
[1:00:42] it proves that it was just temporary see
[1:00:46] they'd seen the power of God but let me
[1:00:47] say like this they'd never been to the
[1:00:49] cross of Christ they'd never seen that
[1:00:52] Jesus paid for their sins they saw Jesus
[1:00:54] power they saw Jesus's might but they
[1:00:57] never really went to the cross and
[1:00:59] really never confess their sins like
[1:01:01] they ought to they never really died out
[1:01:04] to themselves all the way
[1:01:10] Hebrews four I'm sorry Hebrews six let's
[1:01:15] just go over these because again because
[1:01:16] they're important for us and especially
[1:01:19] the children I know they need to hear it
[1:01:20] too Hebrews 6:4 it is him for is it
[1:01:24] impossible for those who were once
[1:01:26] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:01:28] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:01:30] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:01:32] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:01:33] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:01:36] them again unto repentance seeing that
[1:01:38] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[1:01:41] God afresh and put him to an open shame
[1:01:44] I what's-what's thus what's striking
[1:01:49] words once they've crucified the word
[1:01:54] and they they they walk away from the
[1:01:57] word despite seeing miracles the Bible
[1:02:00] said it's impossible for them to come
[1:02:01] back Hebrews 10:26
[1:02:22] we must make sure we constantly stay
[1:02:24] under God's anointing these are examples
[1:02:27] of people that get under the anointing
[1:02:29] just once in a while just at the
[1:02:31] beginning and they sell it out later and
[1:02:33] fall away we've got to constantly be
[1:02:36] under God's anointing these people only
[1:02:39] wanted a temporary anointing and then
[1:02:41] they were okay after that they're okay
[1:02:43] with that living in iniquity continuing
[1:02:46] to sin 10:26 for if we sin willfully
[1:02:53] after that we've received the knowledge
[1:02:55] of the truth there remaineth no more
[1:02:56] sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful
[1:02:59] looking for of judgment and fiery
[1:03:00] indignation which shall devour the
[1:03:02] adversaries he that despised Moses law
[1:03:04] died without mercy under two or three
[1:03:07] witnesses so what's the example Moses's
[1:03:10] people were brought out they were
[1:03:12] justified they were sanctified brought
[1:03:15] all the way up to the borderline but
[1:03:18] then they turn around they said oh we
[1:03:19] can't take the Holy Ghost we can't be
[1:03:21] born again and they complained and died
[1:03:23] and God said they're all dying the
[1:03:25] wilderness and that's the example we get
[1:03:29] verse 29 of how much sorer punishment
[1:03:31] suppose ye shall he be thought worthy
[1:03:33] who hath trodden under foot the Son of
[1:03:36] God and hath counted the blood of the
[1:03:38] Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an
[1:03:40] unholy thing and that done despite unto
[1:03:43] the spirit of grace not so see this is
[1:03:51] what this is what I learned I think last
[1:03:53] year was a fresh revelation to me people
[1:03:55] can be genuinely genuinely justified and
[1:03:57] sanctified but then fall away because
[1:04:00] the Bible said wherewith he was
[1:04:02] sanctified just like Israel could be
[1:04:05] genuinely left Egypt and genuinely come
[1:04:08] up to the promised land but then turn it
[1:04:10] down they could taste summer they could
[1:04:12] taste the grapes they could do all they
[1:04:14] could go over and cross over and taste
[1:04:17] to those things but they sell it out
[1:04:19] because they do despite the spirit of
[1:04:21] grace and again this again highlights
[1:04:25] how Jesus said if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:26] you'll keep getting more into the Word
[1:04:28] of God amen
[1:04:30] Israel did not write those Israelites
[1:04:32] they did not press into the things of
[1:04:34] God they just kept going around
[1:04:35] the same thing same thing that's what I
[1:04:38] believe is happiness message the same
[1:04:40] people just keep going over God sent a
[1:04:42] prophet God sent a prophet God sent a
[1:04:43] prophet God sent a prophet to get our
[1:04:45] souls born again of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:48] in fact I heard more reports this week
[1:04:50] of message pastors committing adultery
[1:04:52] and all kinds of other things like that
[1:04:54] people that were highly esteemed and all
[1:04:58] kinds of things Church why does that
[1:04:59] happen because they get to the they get
[1:05:01] up to Kadesh Barnea but they don't cross
[1:05:03] over they don't get born again they
[1:05:05] truly not die out to sin because if they
[1:05:07] died out to sin the Holy Spirit would
[1:05:09] keep them from that if they truly died
[1:05:11] out God would quicken that seed and that
[1:05:13] seed would spring forth and it would
[1:05:16] bring forth new life amen glory see its
[1:05:24] judgment and fiery indignation for those
[1:05:27] who only want a temporary noin ting I
[1:05:29] want more anointing I want my anointing
[1:05:32] to continue into my 40s I've had it in
[1:05:35] my 20s I've had my 30s I wanted to
[1:05:37] continue in my forties amen
[1:05:39] hallelujah I don't want to see my life
[1:05:43] get further away I don't want to see me
[1:05:46] uh.this disagreeing with grace I want to
[1:05:49] see me obeying grace and God giving me
[1:05:52] more grace to overcome my trials let's
[1:05:56] see this group came all the way up and
[1:05:58] said oh we're not going the Holy Ghost
[1:05:59] now groups today I'm saying we'll come
[1:06:02] up and say oh we can't make a rapture we
[1:06:05] can't have the book of Acts see we don't
[1:06:07] want that in our church we want
[1:06:08] believers say we can have the book of
[1:06:10] Acts
[1:06:10] we'll keep pressing we'll keep believing
[1:06:12] we want all God's promises perhaps we're
[1:06:15] the generation that takes the rapture
[1:06:17] praise God hallelujah well what you see
[1:06:27] is a
[1:06:27] people especially around the message
[1:06:28] they just get real complacent they don't
[1:06:30] want to pray no more for the Holy Ghost
[1:06:32] they want to pray no more for revival
[1:06:34] they don't want to pray no more for lost
[1:06:36] souls they want to pray for anything
[1:06:39] like that they don't want to pray at all
[1:06:41] I just want to come to church and hear
[1:06:43] good things and people it's their ears
[1:06:47] right but see if we are listening to our
[1:06:51] soul our soul it tells tonight we're
[1:06:53] thirsting for now to pretend God or
[1:06:55] historical God we're thirsting for a
[1:06:57] Living God see that's what David said my
[1:07:01] soul thirsts for a living God that's why
[1:07:04] real Christians that our Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] filled come to church wanting to hear
[1:07:08] from the Living God amen that's right so
[1:07:15] see that's how we we understand and
[1:07:18] that's the temporary anointing people
[1:07:22] that taste of it but don't continue in
[1:07:24] it
[1:07:25] and I know by God's grace you want to
[1:07:27] continue in it don't you praise God I
[1:07:29] want to continue in it you want to
[1:07:31] continue in it by the grace of the Lord
[1:07:34] now I got a few more minutes here good
[1:07:38] praise God any time all right now let me
[1:07:41] go through a couple more examples now
[1:07:42] got your Bibles here on Sunday I showed
[1:07:49] how Joseph was filled Holy Ghost bezu
[1:07:52] Leo Caleb Micah
[1:07:55] Joshua all these other examples had the
[1:07:59] Holy Ghost now there was three examples
[1:08:01] I want to look at again a little more
[1:08:03] closely
[1:08:06] let's do Samson and Saul I just want the
[1:08:10] especially the children to see these now
[1:08:12] us adults we've read these before but
[1:08:14] they were really good when I was reading
[1:08:16] over them
[1:08:17] I go to judges 16 20 if you would here
[1:08:25] can you pull out up to education
[1:08:27] whenever you're ready judges 1620
[1:08:33] I want you to notice here humming Oh
[1:08:39] Samson did mighty works of God mighty he
[1:08:45] moved in great ways killing thousands we
[1:08:49] know with just uh with bones right old
[1:08:52] bones but here's where the holy spirit
[1:08:55] left Samson and she said the Philistines
[1:08:58] be upon thee Samson and he woke out of
[1:09:00] his sleep and said I will go out as at
[1:09:02] other times before and shake myself and
[1:09:04] he wished not that the Lord was departed
[1:09:07] from him his man we noted great things
[1:09:12] let me turn to judges 1325 judges 1325
[1:09:27] you're faster than me
[1:09:29] thank you and the spirit Lord began to
[1:09:31] move him at times in the camp of Dan
[1:09:34] between zorah and eshtaol samson was a
[1:09:37] man who knew the leading of the Holy
[1:09:39] Spirit next judges 14:6
[1:09:56] and the spear Lord came mightily upon
[1:10:00] him and he ret him as he would have rent
[1:10:02] a kid and he had nothing in his hand but
[1:10:04] he told not his father's mother what he
[1:10:06] had done so Samson did great miraculous
[1:10:11] things right he ripped a lion here he
[1:10:15] rips a lion that roared against him like
[1:10:20] he'd rent a little kid or a little baby
[1:10:23] goat or maybe lamb he had such power but
[1:10:29] when he told a secret right to Delilah
[1:10:32] the Lord left him because he broke his
[1:10:35] covenant promise he broke his Nazarite
[1:10:38] vow now what's extremely sad as judges
[1:10:48] 16-1 here's another scripture then went
[1:10:52] Samson to Gaza and there and saw there
[1:10:55] and harlot and went in unto her and it
[1:10:58] was told the GAT guy site saying Samson
[1:11:01] has come thither and they come past come
[1:11:03] past him in and laid wait for him all
[1:11:05] night in the gate of the city and were
[1:11:08] quiet all the night saying in the
[1:11:10] morning when it is day we shall kill him
[1:11:12] and Samson late so midnight and arose at
[1:11:14] midnight and took the doors of the gate
[1:11:17] of the city and the two posts and went
[1:11:19] away with them bar and off and put them
[1:11:21] upon his shoulders and carried them up
[1:11:23] to the top of a hill that is before have
[1:11:25] rod look at this Samson goes and commits
[1:11:30] fornication right lays there till
[1:11:37] midnight he hears the enemy come in he
[1:11:39] picks up the gates which we'd say we'd
[1:11:42] be hundreds if not thousands of pounds
[1:11:44] and he walks up a hill with hundreds of
[1:11:47] thousands of pounds and he sits down and
[1:11:50] he does it by the Spirit of Lord praise
[1:11:54] God look at that church and then as we
[1:11:59] saw when he broke the vow of the Spirit
[1:12:02] of God left him now it's hard for us to
[1:12:04] understand is how come the Spirit of God
[1:12:05] didn't leave him
[1:12:06] when he went in that harlot there but
[1:12:10] God had a promise as long as he kept
[1:12:12] those certain things you know anything
[1:12:13] would stay with him how do we know the
[1:12:16] Bible says the gifts and callings of God
[1:12:19] are without repentance the gifts and
[1:12:24] calling of God are without repentance
[1:12:26] that's why some of these televangelists
[1:12:28] can do great miracles right with the
[1:12:30] anointing and then go do evil things
[1:12:31] that night with all the money they took
[1:12:32] from the people right and they got it on
[1:12:35] tape people it's all over YouTube and
[1:12:37] the TV and everything but look at this
[1:12:41] it wasn't the Lord's anointing causing
[1:12:44] him to go to the prostitute right but
[1:12:50] see part of it was he didn't have the
[1:12:52] baptism of the soul where if he had the
[1:12:55] baptism of the soul he would not have
[1:12:57] went into a prostitute he would not have
[1:13:00] married outside the faith right and he
[1:13:03] would not had a girlfriend named Delilah
[1:13:05] who was outside the faith because he
[1:13:08] would have had the power of the Holy
[1:13:10] Ghost inside of him to be a witness
[1:13:12] praise God amen
[1:13:14] a witness in Gaza a witness wherever he
[1:13:17] went praise God but he lacked that power
[1:13:21] yet he had a temporary noin ting what if
[1:13:27] what a striking character Samson is and
[1:13:33] it's amazing once his hair grew out
[1:13:36] church all she had to do was say O Lord
[1:13:37] God remember me I pray thee and
[1:13:40] strengthen me I pray the only this one
[1:13:41] so God that I may be at once avenge of
[1:13:45] his Philistines for my two eyes and God
[1:13:49] came back and the anointing came back
[1:13:53] now that ought to teach us a lesson to
[1:13:56] church if we don't feel the anointing
[1:13:58] let's humble ourselves ask God to
[1:14:00] forgive us let's say Lord once more let
[1:14:03] your anointing come upon me praise God I
[1:14:06] want to feel your power I want to feel
[1:14:08] your glory I want to see you move in my
[1:14:09] life forgive me lord I humble myself and
[1:14:12] God once more let me feel your anointing
[1:14:15] come upon my life
[1:14:25] now
[1:14:27] let's look at a Saul's life go to first
[1:14:31] samuel 10 especially want the children
[1:14:37] to see this so they can understand it
[1:14:44] first samuel 10
[1:14:46] I got verses 1 to 10 that's a whole lot
[1:14:50] of reading verse 10 first samuel 10 10
[1:14:59] and when they came thither to the hill
[1:15:02] behold a company of prophets met him and
[1:15:03] the Spirit of God came upon him and he
[1:15:05] prophesied among them remember Saul was
[1:15:09] head and shoulders above everybody else
[1:15:11] right they said where's our king he was
[1:15:14] hiding in the baskets where is our great
[1:15:17] king our great big man he was hiding
[1:15:19] from the position that should have been
[1:15:21] a clue but they called him out they
[1:15:24] anointed him and then as soon as they
[1:15:26] anoint him the Spirit of God came upon
[1:15:28] him and he started prophesying I wonder
[1:15:29] what his prophesy
[1:15:32] but he started rebelling against God and
[1:15:35] an evil spirit came upon him because of
[1:15:41] his jealousy right he got jealous of
[1:15:44] David but when David played the harp the
[1:15:47] evil spirits left so malachi lydia keep
[1:15:50] playing the piano evil spirits will lead
[1:15:52] people in the church amen hallelujah
[1:15:55] keep playing for jesus amen
[1:15:57] it'll cause evil spirits to leave this
[1:15:59] place people can find rest for their
[1:16:02] souls right here praise God after David
[1:16:08] slew Goliath the evil spirit returned to
[1:16:10] Saul because he was jealous when dancing
[1:16:13] women proclaim that David was the better
[1:16:16] warrior
[1:16:17] right Saul tried twice to murder David
[1:16:21] in 1st Samuel 19 but then Church saw and
[1:16:25] his servants went to Rhema to dispose of
[1:16:27] David but instead they all prophesied as
[1:16:30] the Spirit of God came upon them ah a
[1:16:35] church this is not the kind of
[1:16:37] Christians we want to be one day where
[1:16:39] curse and message believers
[1:16:41] the next day we got the anointing on us
[1:16:43] we don't want to be that way praise God
[1:16:46] once one Saturday night were we're doing
[1:16:49] evil things then Sunday morning praising
[1:16:51] God with the anointing on us now there's
[1:16:53] gonna be times - where yeah we might
[1:16:55] fall short but church we don't want to
[1:16:57] be that kind of a believer we want to be
[1:17:00] like brother Anderson we looked at
[1:17:01] brother Neville he's the same Christian
[1:17:03] he's just more in love with God all the
[1:17:05] time every day is the same praise God
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] he's got that same testimony just a real
[1:17:10] faithful servant to Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:14] in other words if we are born again we
[1:17:17] shouldn't see these big flip flops in
[1:17:19] our lives we shouldn't be living it's
[1:17:22] gonna say like this we shouldn't be
[1:17:23] living so much outside in the holy place
[1:17:26] or the outer court we should be living
[1:17:29] in the Holies of Holies amen oh thank
[1:17:33] god but see that's what as as time goes
[1:17:38] on we're seeing more more people bear
[1:17:42] their fruits right like we said with the
[1:17:47] message preachers committing adultery or
[1:17:50] leaving the message or stealing money or
[1:17:52] hoarding up ties or whatever they would
[1:17:54] do selfishly greedy as time goes on the
[1:17:59] seeds are gonna determine what they are
[1:18:01] right they're gonna be riping right the
[1:18:04] seeds are coming to fruition it's coming
[1:18:07] down the wheat and the tares are both
[1:18:09] maturing we should mature in the Word of
[1:18:11] God amen
[1:18:12] hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:18:16] but seesaw didn't have the soul baptism
[1:18:18] so he's flip-flopped sometimes he's off
[1:18:20] sometimes he doesn't want to love God
[1:18:23] doesn't want to love God's people next
[1:18:25] time he does next time he doesn't oh my
[1:18:27] god help us praise God how many want to
[1:18:31] be a solid believer amen now the flip
[1:18:34] flopper back and forth from evil things
[1:18:36] they're good things evil things are good
[1:18:37] things let's say and the good things the
[1:18:39] good things of God
[1:18:41] praise God then
[1:18:48] all spent almost the rest of his life
[1:18:50] trying to kill David and chase him down
[1:18:52] after Rhema God grew weary of saws
[1:18:59] disobedience taken both his mercy away
[1:19:02] from Saul and the Kingdom of Israel
[1:19:05] that's Rita that's familiar to me first
[1:19:09] Chronicles 1713 yep first Chronicles
[1:19:20] 1713 we were faster than me hon good yep
[1:19:24] I will be his father speaking of David
[1:19:26] and he shall be my son and I will not
[1:19:29] take my mercy away from him as I took it
[1:19:31] from him that was before thee God
[1:19:36] actually took his mercy away from Saul
[1:19:38] how did it manifest the way he died God
[1:19:43] did not let Saul died and mercy right it
[1:19:45] would look there's an awful death so our
[1:19:51] obedience will produce God's mercy in
[1:19:54] our life my Saul was back and forth evil
[1:20:02] spirits good spirit evil spirits holy
[1:20:05] spirit evil spirit Holy Spirit we want
[1:20:07] to be holy spirit all the time praise
[1:20:09] God 24/7 as much as we can praise God
[1:20:13] let's walk in the holy spirit now see
[1:20:20] Christians like Christians will harbor
[1:20:23] murderous spirits like Saul did in other
[1:20:26] words let me say that this church we
[1:20:28] shouldn't hold grudges if we've got
[1:20:31] grudges and complexes it's our fault it
[1:20:35] might be a sign we're not born again
[1:20:37] it's like if we can't control our lust
[1:20:39] of our eyes or our sexual things like
[1:20:41] Samson if we can't control our anger and
[1:20:44] bitterness and relationships like saw
[1:20:46] these are things that are proving
[1:20:48] whether we're born again or not if we
[1:20:51] can flip-flop from sexual sin or evil
[1:20:54] evil things or a bitterness or anger all
[1:20:58] these things and then go to the
[1:21:00] anointing and back and forth some
[1:21:02] is wrong with that praise God because
[1:21:11] remember murderers were not inherit the
[1:21:13] kingdom of God right Saul had a
[1:21:16] murderous spirit and he would have done
[1:21:19] it if he could have he tried to throw
[1:21:20] the javelin Church he imagined a javelin
[1:21:24] going through that the drywall there I'm
[1:21:27] gonna kill you David
[1:21:29] right and preachers do it all the time
[1:21:31] people sent their congregations and
[1:21:32] they're basically killing them right
[1:21:34] they're bashing them and hurting their
[1:21:36] faith they got a personal conflict with
[1:21:41] them instead of talking them one-on-one
[1:21:42] the preachers will do it over the pulpit
[1:21:44] I know Beatrice has seen that right I
[1:21:47] know I've seen it preachers instead of
[1:21:50] talking to people and handling outside
[1:21:52] the pulpit they they won't talk about
[1:21:54] outside like Jesus said she said go to
[1:21:56] them one on one they'll try to take care
[1:21:58] of it over the pulpit that's wrong
[1:22:00] that's not how you fight your battles
[1:22:02] you fight your battles on your knees and
[1:22:04] you go talk to them one on one like
[1:22:05] Jesus said and remember the Bible said
[1:22:12] no fornicator will inherit the kingdom
[1:22:14] of God so see that's why Samson could do
[1:22:17] that because he wasn't born again now of
[1:22:19] course we believe he was saved you know
[1:22:21] just like we know Saul was saved too but
[1:22:25] see they couldn't have the permanent
[1:22:26] anointing because their sins weren't
[1:22:28] paid for by a perfect spotless lamb the
[1:22:32] blood of Jesus Christ let's close with
[1:22:38] David we're real familiar with Bathsheba
[1:22:40] but let's look at some of these other
[1:22:41] scriptures here the Bible said God's
[1:22:45] anointing came on David
[1:22:46] when Samuel poured the oil on him just
[1:22:49] like Saul right he pronounced in the
[1:22:54] next king and David of course was called
[1:23:00] the man after God's own heart David
[1:23:03] loved God's anointing and you can read
[1:23:05] about it all through the Book of Psalms
[1:23:07] right a lot of the Psalms prophesied of
[1:23:11] Jesus Christ in Psalm 16 Psalms 22
[1:23:14] Psalms 110
[1:23:19] the Holy Spirit took David so deep in
[1:23:23] the anointing that he even said these
[1:23:25] words my God my God why hast thou
[1:23:27] forsaken me all my bones they look and
[1:23:30] stare upon me they part my garments
[1:23:32] among them and cast lots
[1:23:33] upon my vesture David never had that
[1:23:38] David never was forsaken by God David
[1:23:41] never saw his bones and was pierced
[1:23:44] David never went through that but he got
[1:23:46] so anointed by the Holy Spirit he
[1:23:49] prophesied what Jesus Christ was going
[1:23:51] to go through a thousand years in the
[1:23:53] future praise God he got so under that
[1:23:56] anointing that his words prophesied of
[1:24:00] God's Son God's Messiah he never went
[1:24:04] through that that's how great the
[1:24:07] anointing was upon David David said in
[1:24:12] 2nd samuel 23:2 the Spirit of the Lord
[1:24:15] spake by me and His Word was in my
[1:24:18] tongue 2nd Peter 1 verse 21 said about
[1:24:23] David and the prophets holy men of God
[1:24:25] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:24:28] Ghost
[1:24:28] my that's beautiful praise God he was so
[1:24:33] devoted to God even under the law the
[1:24:35] Spirit of God spake by him and he spake
[1:24:38] thus saith the Lord and wrote hundreds
[1:24:43] of songs but then we know the awful that
[1:24:49] he did with Bathsheba a member church
[1:24:53] the Bible said that his sin with
[1:24:57] Bathsheba was the one time he turned
[1:25:00] aside from the commands of God all the
[1:25:02] days of his life that was the one time
[1:25:05] that means most of all the other times
[1:25:08] maybe he was tricked into it but the one
[1:25:10] time he turned aside the Bible said he
[1:25:14] despised the commandment of the Lord was
[1:25:17] with Bathsheba and then your eyes
[1:25:20] setting up your ride to be lost think
[1:25:23] about that he said my bone step my bone
[1:25:26] stare at me he prophesied of Jesus
[1:25:28] Christ he said my
[1:25:29] god my god why is that forsaken me so in
[1:25:32] anointing but then he that anointing
[1:25:34] left him and he got under the Loess
[1:25:36] anointing from one extreme to the depths
[1:25:41] of the other we don't want to flip-flop
[1:25:45] like that Church all do with all due
[1:25:47] respect to David probably well well more
[1:25:50] remand than me and all of us here a man
[1:25:54] after God's own heart yet he went from
[1:26:00] that extreme the proper sign of Jesus
[1:26:02] Christ thousand years before hand to
[1:26:05] committing adultery and having the
[1:26:07] woman's husband killed
[1:26:13] look Church with God's anointing he
[1:26:15] could have cast down that temptation the
[1:26:17] Bible said cast down anything that
[1:26:19] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[1:26:21] God with all that anointing he could
[1:26:23] have broke out the heart sister Beatrice
[1:26:24] he could have started playing the harp
[1:26:26] and he could have cast out on that or
[1:26:28] later have sent a message of grace he
[1:26:30] could have had that passion and he could
[1:26:32] have went and had it with his concubines
[1:26:34] or his wives he had two options there
[1:26:37] could seek as God always makes a way out
[1:26:40] in times of trouble he's faithful he'll
[1:26:43] always make a way of escape in
[1:26:44] temptation he had at least two options
[1:26:47] but yet he he despised those things and
[1:26:51] he went and took Bathsheba anyway my
[1:26:57] Nathan said you have despised the
[1:27:00] commandment of the Lord in second Samuel
[1:27:02] 12 verse 9
[1:27:09] did you know Nathan put the sin of David
[1:27:13] or the sin of your eyes death on David
[1:27:16] he says thou has killed Uriah the
[1:27:19] Hittite with the sword and has taken his
[1:27:22] wife to be thy wife and has slain him
[1:27:23] with the sword of the children of Ammon
[1:27:26] Nathan put it rightly on David and when
[1:27:30] David repented he said I have sinned
[1:27:32] against the Lord
[1:27:38] remember some of the effects remember
[1:27:41] some of the consequences to this I want
[1:27:42] to read this because I want our church
[1:27:44] to know about it because of his sins
[1:27:50] Nathan said the sword will never depart
[1:27:53] from your house how many know that he
[1:27:56] and Bathsheba's first child died and
[1:27:58] then David's daughter Tamar was raped by
[1:28:00] her half-brother Amnon who's then
[1:28:03] murdered by Absalon two years later
[1:28:07] David's son yeah
[1:28:09] Davison and then Absalon steals the
[1:28:11] hearts of the people from his own father
[1:28:13] forcing his dad in the Exile Absalom
[1:28:16] then lays with his father's concubines
[1:28:18] publicly as a divine retribution for
[1:28:22] David's secret adultery because of that
[1:28:26] Absalon had public adultery with David's
[1:28:29] wives because the Bible says whatever
[1:28:32] you reap that's what you'll so if you
[1:28:35] reap secret sins then you're gonna so
[1:28:37] public shame right because jesus said
[1:28:42] everything that's done in secret he said
[1:28:44] will be shouted from the rooftops oh god
[1:28:47] help us to have live pure lives in
[1:28:49] secret when we're in secret by ourselves
[1:28:51] god help us to live righteously amen
[1:28:54] because our secret unconfessed sin if we
[1:28:57] don't confess it it'll be shown publicly
[1:28:59] oh god help your people praise God I
[1:29:05] know he was so faithful and then later
[1:29:12] his other son Adonai Jia is slain after
[1:29:18] David dies and AB Solomon has Adonai
[1:29:22] just slained because he's a traitor God
[1:29:27] is not mocked whatsoever Manzo's that
[1:29:30] shall you reap
[1:29:31] I want to show this especially so the
[1:29:33] children know this is the consequence of
[1:29:35] flip-flopping from one anointing to the
[1:29:37] other amen we got to be like those in
[1:29:40] the house of stephanas the Bible said
[1:29:43] they dicted themselves to the ministry
[1:29:45] of the saints amen in other words we got
[1:29:48] to be addicted to the Holy Ghost praise
[1:29:49] God
[1:29:50] amen now
[1:29:52] flopping from one anointing to another
[1:29:54] we've got up a solid testimony all the
[1:29:56] time we're staying in the Holy Spirit
[1:29:58] we're living the right life we're being
[1:30:00] obedient we're walking in the Holy
[1:30:02] Spirit praise God amen
[1:30:05] I'm closing in Psalms 51 David said that
[1:30:13] mighty prayer he said cast me not away
[1:30:16] from your presence and take not your
[1:30:18] Holy Spirit from me see just like Samson
[1:30:21] just like Saul the anointing was on them
[1:30:23] but then it left on him then it left and
[1:30:26] we should be able to live longer under
[1:30:28] God's anointing because we've got it in
[1:30:30] our souls that's right
[1:30:35] David's anointing was temporary and he
[1:30:40] said God restore the joy of my salvation
[1:30:42] now that the the deep part is that on
[1:30:46] our minds we need our joy restored right
[1:30:48] here this is where we need the
[1:30:50] restoration today restore the me the joy
[1:30:53] of my salvation right here our soul is
[1:30:55] sealed
[1:30:55] right it's got God's anointing but we
[1:30:58] need it right here we need to remember
[1:30:59] the blessings of God and have the joy of
[1:31:02] God and all that God's done for us
[1:31:05] hallelujah thank to the heart I thank
[1:31:08] you Jesus
[1:31:12] remember adulterers will not inherit the
[1:31:15] kingdom of God
[1:31:15] so Samson was fornicators one of the
[1:31:18] Herot saw was murders 1 inherit and
[1:31:21] David's adulterers won't inherit it but
[1:31:24] see they didn't have access to the Holy
[1:31:26] Ghost like we have it praise God
[1:31:32] let's read pull up this lets us stay on
[1:31:35] our feet and in case you pull up first
[1:31:37] Peter 1:5 let's just do two more
[1:31:44] scriptures as we close here first Peter
[1:31:49] 1:5 look at this beautiful text here
[1:31:51] tonight I tried to preach just the
[1:31:53] Howerton I hope that's okay praise God
[1:31:57] Church who's keeping you tonight whose
[1:32:00] power is keeping you tonight
[1:32:02] it's God's power and we are so blessed
[1:32:06] sister Beatrice that we have access to
[1:32:08] this power praise God they didn't have
[1:32:11] access to the sole power in the Old
[1:32:14] Testament but we have access to it
[1:32:16] tonight if we want to live above sin we
[1:32:19] can do it because we have access to it
[1:32:22] who are kept by what do we kept by the
[1:32:25] power of God through faith through
[1:32:28] Revelation unto salvation ready to be
[1:32:31] revealed in the last time
[1:32:33] who's that word keep means guard who's
[1:32:36] guarding your soul tonight the Holy
[1:32:38] Spirit God's power is protecting your
[1:32:41] soul your nature right so you don't
[1:32:43] choose the wrong thing you don't go the
[1:32:45] wrong direction who's keeping you who's
[1:32:47] guarding you the Holy Spirit hallelujah
[1:32:54] second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the
[1:32:58] foundation of God standeth sure having
[1:33:00] this seal here's the seal the Lord
[1:33:03] knoweth them that are his and then
[1:33:05] everyone that name at the name of Christ
[1:33:07] depart from iniquity uh-oh yeah 2nd
[1:33:12] Timothy 2:19 what's the seal of a
[1:33:15] Christian you depart from iniquity that
[1:33:20] sound familiar
[1:33:20] he said depart from me ye workers of
[1:33:23] iniquity right so the seal of God is we
[1:33:26] will depart from iniquity hey man look
[1:33:28] at that man Jesus tells workers of
[1:33:31] iniquity depart from me he tells
[1:33:33] Christians depart from iniquity Amen
[1:33:36] thank the Lord hallelujah that's the
[1:33:42] Word of God if David had been born again
[1:33:47] he would have cast down that lust if
[1:33:50] Samson had been born again he would have
[1:33:52] never got involved with Delilah
[1:33:53] he never would've went to that
[1:33:55] prostitute if Saul had been born again
[1:33:57] he would
[1:33:58] happy for David hey can you imagine what
[1:34:01] could they have done sister brothers
[1:34:03] what could they have done if they had
[1:34:05] David and Saul under the anointing what
[1:34:08] could they have done they could have
[1:34:11] tore up that place without anointing of
[1:34:14] the Holy Spirit Jonathan they had
[1:34:16] Jonathan - hey Jonathan and David and
[1:34:19] one Accord and Saul one Accord they
[1:34:20] could have mighty things but they didn't
[1:34:23] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:34:25] what can we do we can save souls for the
[1:34:27] kingdom of God we know it's fewer and
[1:34:31] fewer gonna be saved I go that all the
[1:34:32] time that's true it's that coming to the
[1:34:34] headstone there's fewer and fewer but we
[1:34:37] can do a great thing by saving souls
[1:34:39] from the air of their way that's our
[1:34:43] desire tonight musicians if you'll come
[1:34:54] remember that last Scripture Ezekiel 36
[1:34:57] 27 he said I'm gonna give you a new
[1:34:59] heart new spirit and my spirit he said
[1:35:04] my spirit will cause you to keep my
[1:35:07] commands that's what David was lacking
[1:35:10] Sampson was lacking saw they were all
[1:35:13] lacking God's Spirit that would cause
[1:35:15] them to keep the will of God now this is
[1:35:19] powerheads every Holy Ghost filled
[1:35:24] believer knows this is true there's
[1:35:26] times where you're tempted and you feel
[1:35:28] like you're gonna do something awful but
[1:35:30] what causes you to obey it's the Holy
[1:35:33] Spirit it's the seal of God it's the
[1:35:37] nature of not in your soul
