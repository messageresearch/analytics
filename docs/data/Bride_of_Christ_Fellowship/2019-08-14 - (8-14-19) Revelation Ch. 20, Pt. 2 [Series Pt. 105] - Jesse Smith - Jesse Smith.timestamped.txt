[21:10] message but my wife did remember you
[21:13] know growing up my grandma would sit
[21:15] there at the Tate or her grandmother
[21:16] would sit there at the table and teach
[21:17] her memory verses and they were staunch

[34:35] where the Brooks keeps telling me one of
[34:36] the brothers there got the Holy Ghost
[34:37] when I prayed for him last time he said

[34:59] wonderful that's what we live for you
[35:01] know eternal life you know that's what
[35:04] Jesus was talking about when he said

[35:11] thank the Lord praise God God is so
[35:14] gracious and it's all by acts 2:38
[35:17] amen thank the Lord that's the keys to
[35:20] the kingdom praise God revelation 20
[35:22] verse 4 like to look at the Millennium
[35:28] tonight a little bit by God's grace I
[35:30] don't think I have time to finish it
[35:31] there's just so much on it I like to
[35:35] since we're in Revelation chapter 20 I
[35:37] like to look at the Millennium and look
[35:39] at quite a few quotes here from the
[35:41] prophet of God
[35:43] so revelation 20 verse 4 and I saw
[35:49] Thrones and they sat upon them and
[35:51] judgment was given unto them I noticed
[35:56] Thrones multiple throne this name this
[35:58] at least means Jesus's throne and the
[36:01] twenty-four elders throne but I believe
[36:03] it could be more maybe in the Millennium
[36:05] prayer I'm sorry maybe the Menem Christ
[36:07] will have us your separate Thrones for
[36:09] all the bride members I don't know the
[36:12] Bible says we'll sit with him in the
[36:13] throne but we're not sure when that
[36:15] exactly is in his throne or it is just
[36:17] all the Thrones up there represent his
[36:19] throne we don't know exactly but one
[36:21] thing's for sure if we overcome we'll be
[36:23] in that throne that's the one thing we
[36:25] know that overcome the Beast
[36:27] and his mark today because overcome all
[36:30] that by the blood of the Lamb amen word
[36:32] of our testimony and I saw the souls of
[36:36] them that were beheaded for the witness
[36:39] of Jesus and for the word of God and
[36:43] which had not worshipped the Beast
[36:45] neither His image neither had received
[36:47] his mark upon their foreheads or in
[36:50] their hands and they lived and catch us
[36:54] reigned with Christ a thousand years I
[37:00] and the word reigned there in the Greek
[37:02] means to exercise kingly rulership so
[37:08] they just they just don't live with
[37:09] Christ they reign with him and remember
[37:14] the scripture the Bible said Jesus has
[37:15] the rod of iron that rules all nations
[37:17] but he told the overcomer in Sardis that
[37:20] the overcomer gets a round of iron to
[37:23] rule over nations so what does he have
[37:26] he's the great leader he's the Messiah
[37:28] and were the Messiah
[37:30] we're little rulers under the big rule
[37:33] praise God
[37:35] that's right church verse fine but the
[37:38] rest of the Dead the foolish virgin and
[37:40] all the lost live not again until the
[37:43] thousand years were finished this is the
[37:46] first resurrection verse 6 blessed and
[37:49] holy is he that hath part in the first
[37:51] resurrection see how a church and a lot
[37:55] of people want to be blessed today but
[37:57] we don't want to just be blessed we want
[37:58] to be blessed but we also want to be
[38:00] holy live a sanctified separated life
[38:04] lesson holy is he they have part in the
[38:06] first resurrection on such the second
[38:08] death hath no power but they shall be
[38:11] priests of God and of Christ and shall
[38:13] reign with him a thousand years let's
[38:17] have one more word of Prayer Heavenly
[38:18] Father we love you tonight we thank you
[38:20] again for this word help me Lord God
[38:22] I've prepared all these scriptures and
[38:24] in quotes but just Lord guide me by your
[38:26] grace and mercy you're able to to move
[38:29] me however the the people have a need
[38:31] Lord so just use me I'm nothing I know
[38:34] that I'm just reporting here for you for
[38:36] your call my life for my duty I'm just
[38:39] at my post of duty just like everybody
[38:41] else we're all in our post of duty we're
[38:43] happy to be here Lord God and father we
[38:45] ask that you just move by your Holy
[38:47] Spirit as you always do Lord God let's
[38:49] be humble enough to recognize your
[38:51] presence here tonight we give you the
[38:53] glory you promised to be here in Jesus
[38:55] Christ's name the church say Amen god
[38:58] bless yous B&C - praise the Lord so
[39:02] let's look to the Lord here I think I'll
[39:04] just jump right ahead to these
[39:05] scriptures I like to show ya smack I do
[39:09] have some quotes I got a lot of quotes
[39:11] actually then we'll look at these
[39:15] tonight by God's grace so I'm just
[39:24] bringing this scripture up here I want
[39:26] to look at this thought again how John
[39:29] sees Souls this is striking again my
[39:34] that are all in the Thrones right you
[39:37] sees Thrones and then he sees here souls
[39:41] that were that were there for many
[39:44] right not just one reason they're there
[39:46] for many reasons because there's ends in
[39:47] there there's ands so those that were
[39:50] beheaded for Jesus and for the word of
[39:53] God the Old Testament in the New
[39:55] Testament and which had not worshipped
[39:57] the Beast neither His image neither had
[40:00] received his mark upon their foreheads
[40:02] or in their hands and they lived and
[40:04] reigned with Christ a thousand years
[40:07] praise God
[40:08] now they asked brother Branham about
[40:09] this in 64 they say could you please
[40:12] explain the group in Revelation 20 verse
[40:14] 4 are they part of the Bride of the past
[40:17] or in the future he says they are the
[40:22] bride completely both past and now amen
[40:29] not just the past that got beheaded it's
[40:32] the bride now as well they're the bride
[40:35] completely because they're living in the
[40:37] Millennium all right amen and now they
[40:42] ask him another there's more to the
[40:43] question they say so it's puzzling
[40:44] because the persecution of the bride but
[40:47] who else could they be in reign with
[40:49] Christ a thousand years would they be
[40:50] the 144,000 no they are the bride
[40:54] he said while they are beheaded for the
[40:56] witness now you say for they worship not
[40:58] to be sure but you say the Beast is yet
[41:01] to come the beasts has been all the time
[41:04] let me know that right because we know
[41:07] he's had four forms the Beast has a men
[41:11] the Beast has been all the time the
[41:13] Beast that was the one that fed them
[41:15] back there and then Lions dens fed them
[41:17] back there in the arena there in Rome so
[41:19] he's going back you know to the the turn
[41:22] of the first century there he says and
[41:25] that was the Antichrist that was the
[41:27] Beast right there set up a form of
[41:28] religion just exactly like almost a
[41:31] pattern the Roman Church was taken right
[41:33] out of the Bible when what when they did
[41:36] that they organized the thing and made
[41:37] an institution I made a universal Church
[41:39] out of it and all wouldn't bow down to
[41:41] it had to be destroyed it was amen and
[41:46] then he says and then in the part of the
[41:49] body that was then now the body has
[41:51] grown just like a tree till it's coming
[41:54] to the head see we all both
[41:57] martyr and persecuted and so forth so
[42:01] anyone who's in that Holy Ghost filled
[42:03] Church both martyr persecuted or those
[42:06] who just have to fight and contend with
[42:08] the Antichrist spirit they're all going
[42:10] to be on there on the throne amen
[42:12] now I just this I just caught this just
[42:14] familiar thought but I just want to give
[42:16] you a visible visual here the body has
[42:19] grown up to like a tree to that's coming
[42:22] to the head and I just thought of these
[42:23] two pictures so I thought I'd show it to
[42:25] you here's a restoration of the bride
[42:27] tree they start on the day of Pentecost
[42:29] there's all these Nicolaitans bugs
[42:32] remember the four bugs no man talks
[42:34] about cankerworm caterpillar there's all
[42:36] these bugs and as a tree grows you know
[42:38] the bugs eat away but here we are you
[42:40] know there's Pentecostalism you PC I was
[42:42] raised in some believe God Mormons
[42:44] Jehovah's Witnesses but here we are
[42:46] we're supposed to be we're a part of the
[42:49] book of Acts church that's putting forth
[42:51] a new branch and it's at the head of the
[42:54] trade praise God the Bible said in
[42:56] Romans 11 that we were grafted into the
[42:59] holy tree amen hallelujah so God made us
[43:03] one of those branches here awareness
[43:04] branch that's branched in this Gentile
[43:07] branch but he said don't get take heed
[43:10] that you don't get prideful he said
[43:12] because God is able to cut you off and
[43:14] graft in the jet the Jew branch right
[43:16] back into the holy tree and he will do
[43:19] that amen but as long as we're bringing
[43:21] forth the real fruit of Christ then we
[43:23] went when were grafted off we'll be
[43:25] raptured up to heaven amen that's a word
[43:29] to be work to be the bride
[43:30] that's reproducing the very same life of
[43:33] Jesus Christ amen at the very beginning
[43:36] and that reminded me again of the statue
[43:39] Berkman I just always liked this picture
[43:41] I'm just always reminded of it how
[43:43] Christ is the headstone no doubt he's
[43:46] the cornerstone as well we know that
[43:47] he's both the corner and the head he's
[43:49] the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the
[43:51] end of her sin the last they meant but
[43:54] here he is he's the head of this as well
[43:56] he's the head of the pyramid hallelujah
[43:59] so I just want to give those again as a
[44:01] just a little visual there that
[44:03] everybody can see that just as a
[44:06] reminder I thought that was just so so
[44:08] beautiful the way brother Adam laid that
[44:10] out that is
[44:11] coming to the top of the tree praise God
[44:13] we're growing up into the top of the
[44:16] tree hallelujah amen now let me go back
[44:19] here and get a few scriptures I want to
[44:21] start back up here I wanted to start on
[44:23] some quotes about the the Millennium
[44:26] program said there's three comings to
[44:28] Christ to redeem the bride to rapture
[44:31] the bride and then to rule in the
[44:34] Millennium so you can always remember
[44:35] it's three comings by the three r's
[44:36] right redeem rapture rule praise God bro
[44:41] man tells us in blasphemous names I'm
[44:43] gonna skip down to the blue he makes
[44:45] itself perfected in three comings first
[44:48] time is to redeem his bride second time
[44:50] receive his bride third time in the
[44:53] lynnium with his bride and everything is
[44:56] perfected in threes praise God
[44:58] hallelujah now let's look at some Bible
[45:01] teaching from Isaiah 65 about the
[45:04] Millennium I'm just gonna put the exact
[45:06] quotes in here from future homes now in
[45:10] the book of Isaiah now you want to put
[45:11] these scriptures on Isaiah 65 17 Isaiah
[45:16] speak of the millennium that thousand
[45:17] years of rest for the people of God
[45:19] Isaiah spoke of it and said all the
[45:21] former things has passed away and how
[45:23] they'll build houses and habbit them
[45:25] maybe we just take time he said Isaiah
[45:27] 65 now begin uh Isaiah 65 17 I'm gonna
[45:30] turn there my Bible so I got it right
[45:32] laying right in front of me Isaiah 65 17
[45:38] Church that's what the message came to
[45:40] do not to give us the ideas the human
[45:42] ideas of brother Branham but to direct
[45:44] us to the inspired ideas of the Bible
[45:46] amen
[45:48] and to restore all of the mysteries had
[45:51] been all the loose ends that we'd say of
[45:54] all the the laces have all been loosed
[45:56] but brother Ram came as a prophet to tie
[45:58] them all together praise God and that's
[46:01] what we thank the Lord for so verse 17
[46:03] and behold I create a new heavens and
[46:05] earth and the former should not be
[46:07] remembered nor come into mine at some
[46:12] point we're not even going to remember
[46:13] the former world we're just going to be
[46:17] all caught up all filled up all soaking
[46:20] in the beauty of perfection amen
[46:23] other than because the Bible said Jesus
[46:25] will wipe away all the tears from their
[46:27] eyes amen and the former things shall
[46:30] never be remembered again I know there's
[46:33] a scripture I believe there's a
[46:34] scripture about that maybe I can find it
[46:38] real quick if I've marked it off I'm not
[46:40] sure if I have I don't have it marked
[46:44] off that I can find right now so verse
[46:46] 18 be glad to rejoice forever in that
[46:49] which I create for behold I create
[46:51] Jerusalem our rejoicing and her people a
[46:54] joy and I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and
[46:56] joy my people and the voice of weeping
[46:59] shall be no more heard in her nor the
[47:01] voice of cry alright now let me read
[47:03] this quote and III say I wrote the
[47:06] Prophet he said one of the prophets
[47:08] wrote exactly the entire Bible on his
[47:10] prophecy he starts out with the creation
[47:12] in the middle of the book about the for
[47:14] a chapter comes around John the Baptist
[47:15] the New Testament winds up there in
[47:17] Revelations in the Millennium there are
[47:19] 66 books in the Bible 66 chapters Isaiah
[47:22] he wrote a complete commentary now we
[47:24] find out he's getting the 60 here now
[47:27] we're getting the 60 bit chapter one
[47:28] more chapter and he speaks to the money
[47:30] 'm notice how beautiful behold I create
[47:32] new heaven and new earth and the former
[47:33] things should not be remembered or
[47:35] coming to mind it's to pass away be glad
[47:38] be glad and rejoice even in that which
[47:40] I've created for behold I create
[47:42] Jerusalem I'll rejoice and her people a
[47:44] joy now he reads all this scripture that
[47:46] we've already read and they shall not
[47:49] build and another and a habit that is
[47:51] your farm your son fall heir to it or
[47:56] some of your heirs they shall not plant
[47:59] nor eat another there they do their own
[48:01] planting and remain there they got
[48:04] eternal life amen so in other words mean
[48:07] Walter worry about writing a will in the
[48:10] Millenium praise God I'm not gonna give
[48:12] that land to any if I'm there I will
[48:14] give that land to anybody else it'll
[48:16] always be mine amen there's no more
[48:19] wheels there's no more giving away what
[48:21] you've labored for what you've worked
[48:22] and passing it on to someone else know
[48:25] that possession is yours amen hallelujah
[48:28] because they got eternal life hallelujah
[48:30] now and he goes on to read the rest of
[48:33] this here for is the days of a tree are
[48:35] the days of my people
[48:37] but Alexa long enjoy the works of their
[48:39] hands they shall not labor in vain nor
[48:41] bring forth for trouble for their the
[48:43] seed of the Blessed Lord their offspring
[48:46] is with them so Malachi there's another
[48:48] core I don't know if I'm out here the
[48:50] Bible said he won't give I won't give my
[48:51] land to you but you'll have land right
[48:53] next to me if we both got the Holy Ghost
[48:57] you won't be spread out from your family
[48:59] you'll be with your family amen because
[49:02] it says the Ospreys with them praise God
[49:05] so my offspring if I got it if their
[49:08] they got the Holy Ghost they'll be right
[49:10] there with me amen I don't know you
[49:12] notice here's where I'm gonna get after
[49:14] a while and it shall come to pass now
[49:19] let's see what Scripture is he reading
[49:20] here let's skip ahead oh he's good to
[49:26] verse 24 and this should come to pass
[49:28] that before they call our answer while
[49:30] they're yet speaking out here and the
[49:32] wolf and the lamb shall feed together
[49:33] and the lion shall eat straw like a
[49:35] Bullock thus shall be the Serpent's meat
[49:38] and they shall not hurt or destroy in
[49:41] all my holy mountain saith the Lord he
[49:43] said what a promise of these prophets
[49:45] and the great sages teaches of the Bible
[49:47] way back in ancient day seeing this
[49:49] glorious day come hey man all right now
[49:56] okay yeah that's right so yeah he did
[49:58] read those all right no actually not
[50:04] verse 20 actually for some reason either
[50:06] he didn't read verse 20 or I didn't
[50:08] write it down verse 20 Isaiah 65 20
[50:10] there should be no more offense and
[50:12] infant of days nor an old man that hath
[50:16] not failed his days for the child shall
[50:18] die a hundred years old
[50:21] but the sinner being a hundred years old
[50:23] shall be accursed
[50:25] now that's striking there's another
[50:28] quote I don't have it up here but I saw
[50:29] it earlier today I didn't have time to
[50:31] put up there my brother says it looks
[50:33] like there may be dying in the Millenium
[50:35] looks like there might not be but one
[50:38] thing's for sure after the money um's
[50:39] over and Satan is loosed there is dying
[50:42] after the Millenium
[50:44] so this scripture may be referring to
[50:47] after the Millenium what relief says it
[50:50] like see see how the scripture is it
[50:52] just mixed right in with all the
[50:53] millennium scriptures so that's why
[50:55] Miriam says you know it looks like it
[50:56] could be looks like it might not be but
[50:58] Ram said I don't know he said if I would
[51:00] if I knew I would tell you hey man thank
[51:04] the Lord for that hallelujah praise God
[51:10] okay now let's move on here I did those
[51:14] now by Madison just so you know I'm just
[51:17] gonna do a real quick review the new
[51:19] earth is not the Millennium but the
[51:21] madam says just as God create the earth
[51:22] in six days made the earth in six days
[51:24] or six thousand years as he said be not
[51:27] ignorant we read in the scripture one
[51:29] thousand years is one day praise God
[51:34] Peter says that in 2nd Peter 3:8 one day
[51:38] is with the Lord as a thousand years and
[51:40] a thousand years as one day praise God
[51:43] now there's the scripture we read
[51:45] earlier read that now notice though this
[51:48] millennial reign the thousand years is
[51:50] not the new earth see the millennial
[51:53] reign is a different reign that's what
[51:54] we go into the Millennium but it that
[51:57] isn't the new earth and new heaven no no
[51:59] that's just a rest play see a rest
[52:01] spirit that all the new heavens of the
[52:04] new earth for you see in the money and
[52:05] we have things that we would not go into
[52:08] that it's a type of the old seventh day
[52:12] out of Eden the seven day after he made
[52:14] the world the seventh day he rested and
[52:16] the Millennium praise God
[52:18] glory the Millennium is not the end of
[52:21] it there will still be time after the
[52:24] Millennium the my name is a space of
[52:26] time but not the new earth no indeed
[52:29] notice in that we'll get to it after a
[52:31] bit now I made this a long time ago I'm
[52:33] just going to go through real fast from
[52:36] what I understand this is how brother
[52:37] Ram teaches creation and then the seven
[52:42] church ages all right so the Millennium
[52:49] there is a seven-day so we have six days
[52:52] here of 6,000 years right now we're
[52:55] finishing the last six day the church
[52:57] ages right and then the eighth day will
[53:01] be the the New Jerusalem praise God the
[53:03] newer
[53:04] that's a new heavens and the new earth
[53:06] and I just got that little yeah I just
[53:09] got that little animation there that's
[53:10] so that's what it is Jesus is gonna he's
[53:12] gonna cap off the earth with a a pyramid
[53:16] home
[53:16] we know called as the New Jerusalem and
[53:18] nothing or her or destroyed and no
[53:21] abomination will enter that city amen
[53:23] hallelujah let me know homosexuality
[53:25] amen let me know fear amen there'll be
[53:28] no murders IV no defilement there'll be
[53:31] no cross-dressing amen
[53:33] there'll be nothing there it'll only be
[53:34] holiness and purity hallelujah nothing
[53:37] evil will enter in that place so we see
[53:41] that this the money of now is the
[53:43] seventh day and program caused another
[53:46] place I don't know if I just quote he
[53:47] calls it the Sabbath that's our Sabbath
[53:49] praise God
[53:50] hey we are gonna have a Sabbath day man
[53:53] a thousand years of rest no work or we
[53:56] say no no sin that's what it is - you
[53:58] are gonna work we're gonna build but
[54:00] there's gonna be no sweat to it amen
[54:01] glory sees that now the world has now
[54:05] almost 6,000 years old every 2,000 years
[54:08] it has a destruction and I'm just gonna
[54:09] pull it up here as you know this Christ
[54:12] returning to rapture his bride
[54:14] all right so every 2,000 years God does
[54:17] something great so we're looking for
[54:19] something great by God's grace amen the
[54:21] rapture amen
[54:22] now that's the seven church Aegeus
[54:25] praise God now then he burns are off and
[54:27] claims it for his own he puts his own
[54:28] back on it I noticed the perfect word
[54:30] this millennium it's a type of the seven
[54:32] day then comes the white throne judgment
[54:34] see we still have judgment we're still
[54:36] in time in the Millennium it's a day
[54:38] 1,000 years it's a time element now
[54:40] don't get that mixed up with the new
[54:41] earth no because it's not now
[54:45] I want to add this - I forgot to name
[54:47] this but Road Ram tells us in 1960 and
[54:50] the adoption series brother says the
[54:52] promised land that Israel went into does
[54:56] not type the millennium you'll hear
[54:58] people say oh we're going to get to our
[54:59] promised land in the Millennium well I
[55:02] guess in one way it is a promised land
[55:04] like it's promised to us but as far as
[55:07] the time with Israel coming out of Egypt
[55:08] going to the desert and taking the
[55:11] promised land Rivera said the Millennium
[55:13] and said the Millennium does not type
[55:14] the Promised Land the promise they had
[55:17] types
[55:17] or battle in the baptism of the holy
[55:19] ghost race got you coming out of Egypt
[55:22] represents crossing through the Red Sea
[55:24] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[55:27] Christ sanctification is the proving
[55:29] time God said I took you through the
[55:31] desert to prove you to see whether you
[55:34] would obey the Word of God amen and then
[55:37] acts 5:32 says God gives the Holy Ghost
[55:39] to all that obey Him amen so see the
[55:43] only people get the Holy Ghost are those
[55:45] who obey Him and all the elements of
[55:48] sanctification praise God and then they
[55:51] cross over into the promised land the
[55:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[55:55] where they really fight battles amen
[55:58] that's where they really wore a man and
[56:00] they drive out those seven nations
[56:02] hallelujah that's the spiritual type so
[56:06] the Millennium is not the promised land
[56:08] in fact what's interesting is program
[56:10] called Solomon he calls that a type of
[56:13] the Millennium which there's a huge gap
[56:16] between you know Josh were taking the
[56:18] promised land and Solomon there's a huge
[56:20] gap so that's interesting thought now I
[56:23] don't know how that all works out I
[56:24] haven't studied on that but he said
[56:26] because Solomon had a Golden Age there
[56:28] was time of Solomon's reign where it was
[56:30] total peace that was when the Queen of
[56:32] Sheba came remember it didn't last too
[56:34] long he only reigned 40 years but at the
[56:37] end of it the Bible said God got upset
[56:39] with Solomon I've been many times but
[56:41] just to remind you we have to watch out
[56:43] for the Solomon syndrome and we can't
[56:45] get lazy on God Simon got lazy on God
[56:48] because the love of women in other words
[56:50] he started spiritually fornicating right
[56:53] actually naturally and spiritually but
[56:55] we've got to make sure we don't
[56:57] naturally fornicate and make lots of
[56:59] things of the world right but ramstad
[57:02] denominations he said they can live so
[57:04] far from most sins he said but when they
[57:07] when they stick to their Creed's he said
[57:10] they're miss like they're making love to
[57:12] like a dead corpse so see like like
[57:15] Catholic priests for example or Lutheran
[57:17] priest they can live they can live pure
[57:20] sexually some of them might be able to
[57:22] but if they if they cling to their Creed
[57:25] rather than the true baptism the Holy
[57:27] Ghost but man says like that person is
[57:29] hang on a dead corpse making love to a
[57:32] dead corpse that's how much they love
[57:33] their traditions and their Creed's of
[57:35] men but we are Spade supposed to make
[57:37] love to Jesus Christ the word a living
[57:43] we must be we're dead to our old law and
[57:47] we're married to another that is Jesus
[57:49] Christ amen
[57:50] so see judge we're gonna be making love
[57:52] to somebody amen either a Creed the
[57:55] world or to Christ let's make love to
[57:57] Christ amen
[57:59] kiss the son lest he be angry amen we
[58:02] give all the kisses all the worship I
[58:04] love you Jesus we should give all the go
[58:08] because we gotta make love to somebody
[58:10] and we would have loved Christ they
[58:12] gonna make love to somebody
[58:14] hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord
[58:18] now see now the foolish virgin now look
[58:22] look at her she's a virgin so she does
[58:27] not fornicate
[58:28] she doesn't have intercourse with Devils
[58:32] because she's pure she's justified right
[58:36] and she must be pretty sanctified as
[58:38] well right but she never makes love to
[58:43] Jesus Christ nowhere she never gets born
[58:47] again she never gets really under the
[58:49] anointing of the baptism of the Holy
[58:51] Ghost I wish she doesn't make love to
[58:56] Hollywood doesn't make love to the music
[58:58] industry
[58:59] doesn't make love you know to sports and
[59:01] then famous individuals doesn't make
[59:03] love to that but she he's really giving
[59:06] our love all of our love to Jesus Christ
[59:09] amen let us enter into that chamber
[59:11] praise God uh they like Rebecca Isaac
[59:15] amen
[59:15] like the high priests and the hoist of
[59:17] Holies we got to enter in there and we
[59:19] got to know him in the power of his
[59:21] resurrection that's exactly right
[59:24] then there's no shame because that now
[59:26] you're clothed with power praise God
[59:28] you're in do with power from on high
[59:30] praise the Lord thank the Lord amen
[59:34] now so just so you know Israel coming
[59:37] out water baptism the desert
[59:40] signification crossing the land the
[59:43] promise
[59:43] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[59:46] the millennium because there was fights
[59:48] in the batches of Holy Ghost there was
[59:51] fights in the promised land there's no
[59:52] fights in the Millennium if you're one
[59:56] of those on the throne then there's
[59:57] gonna be no argued if you let's say
[59:59] you're on the throat let's say brother
[1:00:00] raised on the throne he's really low a
[1:00:02] certain portion of the earth and some of
[1:00:05] his constituents come up and say yes sir
[1:00:07] ruler brother ray we would like to take
[1:00:11] this land and plant this or that and Ray
[1:00:14] says no I want you to do something else
[1:00:17] I want you to do color or strawberries
[1:00:21] or whatever it is there'll be no arguing
[1:00:24] back and forth because this person
[1:00:28] brother ray or whoever be has a
[1:00:30] glorified body amen they have the glory
[1:00:33] of God upon them amen and all these
[1:00:36] people are predators multiplying and
[1:00:38] growing up they will not have that same
[1:00:40] type of then I haven't same type of
[1:00:42] authority a minute they'll not have the
[1:00:44] same type of authority and power that
[1:00:47] the believer has there'll be no arguing
[1:00:50] there there'll be no debating there
[1:00:51] it'll just be complete obedience it'll
[1:00:54] be the real true government the
[1:00:55] government of the throne of David amen
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] it'll be glorious it'll be a golden age
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:04] the Bible says your rule with a rod of
[1:01:07] iron power over Nations that's where the
[1:01:10] real Holy Ghost fell people not now
[1:01:15] there's cleansing now here's the
[1:01:17] cleansing before the money I'm now just
[1:01:19] so you know there's quotes on both sides
[1:01:20] but rod said there's cleansing before
[1:01:22] the money in which there has to be
[1:01:23] quarter Malachi 4 but then brother I've
[1:01:26] also said there's cleansing after maybe
[1:01:29] after the white throne judgment or
[1:01:30] something like that right so just so you
[1:01:33] know there's there's there's quotes on
[1:01:35] both so some of the scriptures may apply
[1:01:37] to you know before the money some may
[1:01:39] apply you know after the the white
[1:01:41] throne judgment so program talks about
[1:01:45] the sixth seal and then he talks about
[1:01:48] Armageddon now we've been through this
[1:01:51] I'm not gonna go this but this is where
[1:01:53] all stars fall from heaven you know the
[1:01:55] sixth seal with the two prophets
[1:01:57] oh you know nature breaks forth and I
[1:02:02] forget the exact units not much done
[1:02:04] right now but but the power over nature
[1:02:05] we know that now revelation 19 arm again
[1:02:08] went over that a few weeks ago remnant
[1:02:10] slain with the sword
[1:02:11] now rogram says in the Victory Day when
[1:02:14] she comes to the bow room again that'll
[1:02:16] settle the whole thing just before the
[1:02:17] great millennium arm again is going to
[1:02:19] clean off the earth so what cleans the
[1:02:22] earth the simpler the sword of the word
[1:02:24] amen what cleans out your life the sword
[1:02:27] of the word amen as long as the word is
[1:02:30] in your mouth it does the cleaning amen
[1:02:32] right because that's where Christ where
[1:02:34] it is it comes right out of his mouth
[1:02:36] and the word will do the cleaning
[1:02:38] she purifies herself with this atomic
[1:02:41] blowing and the volcanic ash and thing
[1:02:44] sinks this soaked blood of men upon the
[1:02:47] earth and sin and crime she sinks
[1:02:49] beneath the earth the volcanic breaks
[1:02:51] out again and renews and cleans the
[1:02:54] earth for the great millennium he cleans
[1:02:57] his church during that time for people
[1:02:59] to live here Amen I say I like that I
[1:03:02] imagine we'll just be up in there after
[1:03:05] the sore goes out you know the birds get
[1:03:07] done with their great supper right
[1:03:09] sometime after that you will feel the
[1:03:12] starch the earth start shaking all of a
[1:03:14] sudden we'll see explosions and volcanic
[1:03:17] ash will fly up in there all over the
[1:03:19] world and hot magma will come out and
[1:03:22] lava will cover over the earth and every
[1:03:25] single burn and we'll just be standing
[1:03:27] there behind Jesus watching this and
[1:03:29] it'll burn in Oh cleanse and we'll see
[1:03:32] they'll be fire in his eyes Amen huh
[1:03:34] yeah because there's fire cleansing the
[1:03:36] earth just like the fire of the baptism
[1:03:39] of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:03:40] that's what the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:03:42] does to you right it burns out
[1:03:44] it burns out all your desires it
[1:03:46] cleanses your soul your soul is a new
[1:03:48] place for Christ enjoy hell amen
[1:03:51] come on and we watch a volcano after
[1:03:55] volcano it breaks out he says cleaning
[1:04:00] the earth wonder how long it'll be there
[1:04:03] brothers how long we watch the lava flow
[1:04:07] cover all the you know not down
[1:04:11] the force how long will we watch it the
[1:04:16] seventh seal says the millenniums coming
[1:04:18] up and see everything that it's got any
[1:04:19] filth in it is to be purged during the
[1:04:22] sixth seal now do you notice I'm opening
[1:04:24] the seven seals also three for mystery
[1:04:26] this one I'll speak I've spoken is a
[1:04:27] mystery the seven thunders the seven
[1:04:29] thunders in heaven will unfold this
[1:04:30] mystery let me write the coming of
[1:04:32] Christ because Christ said no one knew
[1:04:34] what he returned now church none don't a
[1:04:36] lot of people stumble over this but
[1:04:38] don't stumble of this the RAM later says
[1:04:40] on tape the seven thunders were this
[1:04:42] were the seven revelations contained in
[1:04:44] the seven seals so see some people are
[1:04:47] really concerned about this like all we
[1:04:48] got to hear the thunders we got it I I
[1:04:51] believe we've already heard it we just
[1:04:52] gotta live it we just gotta live it
[1:04:55] that's real it's gonna come down to I'm
[1:04:57] not looking for maybe a new revelation
[1:04:59] I'm looking for just living what Hardy's
[1:05:02] been healed that's what I'm looking for
[1:05:05] praise God another looking for anything
[1:05:06] separate maybe a different met eight
[1:05:08] messenger some like that I'm not looking
[1:05:10] for that I'm looking for the bride to
[1:05:11] get a squeeze because that's what's
[1:05:14] gonna make us live the right way amen
[1:05:17] it's got to come in America it's God
[1:05:19] because that's the Beast out of the land
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:22] it has to come out of here because the
[1:05:25] Spirit of beasts has migrated and who
[1:05:28] hears it of this land and raised up out
[1:05:30] of the land so it's got to come here and
[1:05:33] we'll see the bride get ready amen
[1:05:35] hallelujah now Jesus will sit on the
[1:05:41] throne of David in the money now my man
[1:05:44] tells us and is not jesus the son of
[1:05:46] David according to the fact that he will
[1:05:47] sit upon the throne of David in the
[1:05:49] millennium and reign and rule over us
[1:05:51] heritage surely so the key of David
[1:05:53] signifies it is Jesus who will bring in
[1:05:57] the Millennium the key of David amen
[1:06:00] so Jesus has the key to take us into the
[1:06:03] millennium praise God Hey Oh
[1:06:06] because he has the keys to death and
[1:06:08] he'll will raise up his own paradis
[1:06:11] reign of the righteousness upon the
[1:06:13] earth praise God amen now mighty God
[1:06:18] available for us I'm skipping down the
[1:06:19] blue button the Millennium he comes as a
[1:06:21] son of David to set the throne on the
[1:06:23] throne of David Kay
[1:06:24] he was to take the throne of David he's
[1:06:26] on the Father's throne now and then he
[1:06:29] said he had overcome and shall sit with
[1:06:30] me on my throne as I've overcome and set
[1:06:32] on my Father's throne so he and the
[1:06:34] meriem he'll be the son of David what is
[1:06:37] it the same God all the time just
[1:06:39] changing his mask so I just found this
[1:06:42] pictures online I love this picture this
[1:06:44] is how I imagined when I pray you know
[1:06:46] right now he's on the father's from the
[1:06:49] Bible said he's on his Father's throne
[1:06:51] but in the Millennium he'll be on the
[1:06:53] throne of David or his throne and we'll
[1:06:56] call him son of David amen praise God so
[1:07:01] we see these three sons on a man when he
[1:07:04] was on the earth as prophet son of God
[1:07:06] son of David praise God so there is
[1:07:10] earthly ministry now he's in the
[1:07:12] intercession ministry but in the
[1:07:14] millennium East son of David praise God
[1:07:17] Amen thank the Lord
[1:07:19] now the foolish virgin will miss the
[1:07:21] millennium it is greater importance and
[1:07:23] wonder then imaginable look what he says
[1:07:27] here now I'm gonna just get just give me
[1:07:30] a minute here I'm gonna pull up these
[1:07:31] notes I wasn't really planning on it but
[1:07:33] I think I'll pull it up so I want you to
[1:07:35] see something here just a few scriptures
[1:07:41] all right yeah here we go it is the
[1:07:45] second and sorry it is the second
[1:07:47] resurrection we're in the five foolish
[1:07:49] virgins come up notice that they were
[1:07:51] virgins they did not have the Holy
[1:07:52] Spirit so they miss being in the bride
[1:07:55] while the five wise who had oil became a
[1:07:58] part of the bride but these people being
[1:08:01] is separated God loving people and
[1:08:03] trying to abide in the word I look
[1:08:05] they're always trying they're trying to
[1:08:07] live what the preacher says I don't want
[1:08:09] to try reaching should not be preaching
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:21] where's the post margin they just try to
[1:08:24] do that brother Jesse I'll try to do
[1:08:27] that brother Samuel like you know ready
[1:08:28] I'll try to that brother Isaiah anyone
[1:08:32] who is just trying to do it they got to
[1:08:37] get past a try
[1:08:38] they got to achieve the word that the
[1:08:40] promise they got to receive the promise
[1:08:44] right there's more than just trying in
[1:08:48] fact there's a church age book corn I
[1:08:50] don't have it in front of me but but
[1:08:51] that says the only way you know you are
[1:08:53] an overcomer
[1:08:58] so church we gotta just not come to
[1:09:01] church we've got a look at our lives and
[1:09:03] say what do I need to overcome next hey
[1:09:06] we overcome what one step at a time
[1:09:10] foot steps are right possession so what
[1:09:13] steps is God asking you to take right
[1:09:15] now
[1:09:16] it's not just coming to church that's a
[1:09:18] good thing you got that step down if
[1:09:20] you're a faithful church member thank
[1:09:21] God for that
[1:09:22] amen but see those things that God is
[1:09:25] trying to lead you into praise God
[1:09:27] there's maturity there's ministry God is
[1:09:32] trying to lead us into that's what
[1:09:33] programs the - and programs life story
[1:09:35] the more I realize so so guilty and quit
[1:09:51] he just kept moving on with God he won
[1:09:53] the quit a couple times through his
[1:09:55] mother-in-law one time we listened to
[1:09:57] preachers one time in South Africa he
[1:09:59] listened everybody else but pretty soon
[1:10:01] he got to the point where God said you
[1:10:03] have to walk alone with me and mother
[1:10:05] said that's fine I'll be happy to walk
[1:10:07] with you Lord amen that's what we've got
[1:10:10] to do praise God see where God is
[1:10:12] calling us to walk into now I think for
[1:10:16] myself I think it's each person has to
[1:10:18] recognize the gifts in their life and be
[1:10:20] devoted and like my mentor said be just
[1:10:23] as interested in getting your gifts in
[1:10:26] their place in the house of God as the
[1:10:28] pastor is I believe that's what the Holy
[1:10:33] Spirit's calling everyone to do I
[1:10:34] believe that at least in our church
[1:10:36] because if not then we come to church
[1:10:39] and it's nickel late ISM where only the
[1:10:42] anointing is in the pulpit alright
[1:10:45] but what programs say God is the god of
[1:10:47] the pulpit he said God is the god of the
[1:10:49] audience
[1:10:51] right so see that's right that's truly
[1:10:54] my heart's revelation I'll be the guys
[1:10:56] show me through the scripture now that
[1:11:00] is the true spirit of the Holy Spirit is
[1:11:02] calling everybody higher to find your
[1:11:04] place and to be faithful with those
[1:11:06] talents he gave you or the pound which
[1:11:11] we'll get to that in a few weeks Lord
[1:11:12] willing remember they're 16 parables for
[1:11:15] the kingdom of heaven so we have to look
[1:11:17] at all 16 and we look at all 16 we'll be
[1:11:19] able to see what the kingdom of heaven
[1:11:21] is all about amen the baptism of the
[1:11:23] Holy Ghost is what it's all about
[1:11:25] amen right Church see try bush burn
[1:11:31] you're just trying to stay in the word
[1:11:34] according to what they knew of it and
[1:11:36] being a help and the work of the Lord
[1:11:38] will come up at the end time they will
[1:11:41] miss the millennium which you can begin
[1:11:44] to see by these truth is much more
[1:11:46] important and wonderful than we have
[1:11:49] ever thought or believed or they're
[1:11:53] going to miss the time where the saints
[1:11:54] will sit on Thrones judging nations and
[1:11:57] all the world but they're going to come
[1:12:06] up to the ruler of the nation they're
[1:12:09] going to the bush birds are going to
[1:12:10] miss that all because see the reason God
[1:12:19] can trust us to reign there is because
[1:12:22] we let Christ reign now amen
[1:12:25] Christ reigns in our life now and it's
[1:12:29] more important can you imagine Branson
[1:12:31] when Jesus steps into that Millennial
[1:12:35] temple program said that's the moment
[1:12:37] where the most holy is anoying today I
[1:12:40] didn't even let the 6-volt purpose of
[1:12:42] Daniel the last one is anoint the most
[1:12:45] holy aim and the holy heavenly anointing
[1:12:50] comes down to heaven and it sits in a
[1:12:53] throne as the son of David in the money
[1:12:55] of Jesus Christ takes his road and we
[1:12:58] we'll be right there if we're born again
[1:13:00] amen oh and they're gonna miss that all
[1:13:04] because they were foolish foolish to up
[1:13:07] being born again praise God that's the
[1:13:11] only thing they miss I was being born
[1:13:13] again right now we know some will be
[1:13:16] closer than others right like there are
[1:13:17] six things you can do to get salvation
[1:13:19] at the white throne judgment right
[1:13:20] you can close a Christian you can give
[1:13:24] them water give them meat you can take
[1:13:26] them in your house give them shelter you
[1:13:28] can visit him in prison or you're
[1:13:29] visiting when they're sick Jesus will
[1:13:31] give salvation to anyone that does those
[1:13:33] things to a Christian praise God so some
[1:13:36] will be closer than others amen we'll
[1:13:41] see we have to understand this that the
[1:13:43] foolish virgin misses it now here's why
[1:13:48] they're not responsible with their time
[1:13:51] they're not devoting their time to the
[1:13:53] kingdom of God like they ought to
[1:13:55] so it's patience 5 you just not some you
[1:13:58] know this have recall as I preach it a
[1:14:01] few times is right now you know I'm
[1:14:04] working on the next YouTube script I'm
[1:14:06] working on the wise and foolish virgins
[1:14:07] her brother Aaron brother Aaron
[1:14:10] suggested I do predestination I did that
[1:14:12] and it's been really a good video but a
[1:14:14] lot of people are liking us I've got
[1:14:15] some good feedback on that so thank the
[1:14:18] Lord for that now now this is so
[1:14:22] beautiful visions 5:14 it's perfectly in
[1:14:25] line with the parable of the ten virgins
[1:14:27] look at Ephesians 5:14 where for he says
[1:14:31] Oh wake now that sleepeth and arise from
[1:14:34] the dead in Christ shall give thee light
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] remember the parable they're all
[1:14:37] sleeping why isn't foolish and all of a
[1:14:40] sudden the midnight cry went out behold
[1:14:43] the bridegroom cometh behold Jesus
[1:14:45] Christ is coming the rapture it's the
[1:14:47] message of William Branham wake up and
[1:14:49] get ready for the rapture amen that's
[1:14:51] what it was that was the shout it's the
[1:14:55] crying to go out and meet him trim your
[1:14:57] lamps and go out to meet Christ verse 15
[1:15:01] see then that ye walk circumspectly now
[1:15:04] look that's exactly not as fool's but as
[1:15:09] well but they don't know
[1:15:11] they're not really knowing what they're
[1:15:13] supposed to do maybe I should do that
[1:15:17] and instead of giving their time and the
[1:15:20] Bible says later that they understand
[1:15:22] the will the Lord
[1:15:23] yes verse 17 wherefore be not unwise but
[1:15:26] understanding what the will the Lord is
[1:15:28] amen they're just kind of something here
[1:15:36] stepping there but circumspectly means
[1:15:38] exactly or precisely so a wise virgin
[1:15:42] knows exactly what God wants them to do
[1:15:51] they know where their phones and they
[1:15:54] walk in that perfectly they know exactly
[1:15:56] they're not wandering from here to there
[1:15:58] and they don't waste their time the
[1:15:59] foolish virgin wastes their time not
[1:16:02] understanding the will of God what about
[1:16:07] RAM say he said to understand the seals
[1:16:10] to understand the symbols you have to
[1:16:12] take the rest of the Bible to understand
[1:16:14] the symbols I remember that we preset
[1:16:16] that's the same thing we're doing here
[1:16:17] to understand the foolish version the
[1:16:19] wise the 10 versions you gotta look to
[1:16:21] the rest of the Bible and that
[1:16:22] interprets it for you amen hallelujah
[1:16:26] praise God now acts 5:32 also the Holy
[1:16:31] Ghost whom God has given to those that
[1:16:33] obey Him so there's certain things about
[1:16:35] the foolish version they don't obey the
[1:16:38] directions to get the oil they don't
[1:16:41] obey that they're free from interacting
[1:16:46] and then loving the world they don't
[1:16:47] make love to the world but they still
[1:16:50] don't obey all the Word of God
[1:16:52] especially the baptism Holy Ghost now
[1:16:55] they go to Luke 11:9 let's look at this
[1:16:57] real quick here this was so beautiful
[1:17:01] precious I hope the Lord will reveal
[1:17:03] this to your heart maybe that's the
[1:17:04] purpose of tonight's message hope the
[1:17:07] Lord revealed TR Luke Luke 11:9 and I
[1:17:09] say unto you ask and it shall be given
[1:17:11] you seek and ye shall find knock
[1:17:13] initially open you work remember that
[1:17:14] verse 10 for every one that asketh
[1:17:16] receiveth every one and he that seeketh
[1:17:18] findeth and him that knocketh it shall
[1:17:20] be opened if a son shall ask bread if
[1:17:22] any of you that's a father
[1:17:24] will he give him a stone or if he ask a
[1:17:26] fish will he for a fish give a serpent
[1:17:29] or if he asks it shall ask an egg will
[1:17:32] he offer him a scorpion have ever given
[1:17:34] you a scorpion for breakfast maokai okay
[1:17:37] I got an eggs this morning though that's
[1:17:41] that's right verse 13 if ye then being
[1:17:45] evil those Pharisees know how to give
[1:17:48] good gifts unto your children how much
[1:17:50] more shall your heavenly Father give the
[1:17:52] Holy Spirit to them that ask him what no
[1:18:10] man say about the boys bhurji said the
[1:18:11] wise a good say go pray up is that right
[1:18:15] man see they just don't as they know
[1:18:19] they like being around the Holy Spirit
[1:18:21] you know the Bible says that you the
[1:18:23] bush version out of reach of message
[1:18:24] hell is the wise and foolish message I'm
[1:18:26] sorry the wise and foolish message
[1:18:28] believers I just want to make it so
[1:18:31] complain to everybody so they can see
[1:18:33] like the Buddhist version are right
[1:18:35] there to read or Lance for safe
[1:18:37] occasions understand they're knocking
[1:18:38] off the carbon off their wicks and
[1:18:40] they're pulling up their wicks but
[1:18:42] they're unavoidable they're sanctified
[1:18:45] they're not gonna have any little dress
[1:18:48] others not too tight not too short I'm
[1:18:51] pretty good you're pretty good looking
[1:18:54] good everything's nice for segregation
[1:18:57] right and they're hanging around I think
[1:19:00] and they like being around the lies they
[1:19:02] say can you give me some what you got si
[1:19:06] o si they're going to the wrong person
[1:19:08] again they don't want to make love to
[1:19:10] Jesus and now they're going to the
[1:19:12] believers
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:26] see there's a lot of message people that
[1:19:28] are around that like other people got
[1:19:31] the Holy Ghost but you ain't gonna get
[1:19:33] it for me to round them you got to ask
[1:19:35] Jesus in prayer
[1:19:38] don't forget Acts chapter 1 Church the
[1:19:41] Bible said they went up there for 10
[1:19:42] days to pray 10 days they went up there
[1:19:46] to pray of supplication and have godly
[1:19:49] fellowship before the Holy Ghost come
[1:19:50] and then a lot of people say well I
[1:19:53] believe God sent a prophet I got the
[1:19:55] Holy Ghost no you don't you might got
[1:19:57] the anointing on your on your flesh
[1:19:58] might been baptized you might have a
[1:20:00] safe occasion anointing but you don't
[1:20:02] get it just by believing God's in a
[1:20:03] profit you've got to talk to Jesus about
[1:20:06] that amen so CHR Jesus says if if you
[1:20:12] know how to good gifts good give good
[1:20:14] give good gifts how much more will I
[1:20:17] give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him
[1:20:19] they just don't ask right they just
[1:20:23] don't get down here like there's the
[1:20:24] court I want to bring out yeah let me
[1:20:27] bring it out and this is what a lot of
[1:20:30] people really stumble on there's a quote
[1:20:37] where he says no more agonizing in
[1:20:40] prayer and it's after the seals
[1:20:44] agonizing in prayer yeah
[1:20:49] politics voting in and out saying this
[1:20:52] or that or the other like people
[1:20:54] politics and messy churches and the Holy
[1:20:56] Spirit has no more right away in the
[1:20:58] church than nothing no more prayer
[1:21:00] meetings no more agonizing with God to
[1:21:02] fulfill his word no more believing that
[1:21:04] the word is still the same yesterday
[1:21:06] today and forever
[1:21:06] they just vulture eyes down God
[1:21:09] denomination put their name on a book
[1:21:12] got lazy and soft and sets better
[1:21:14] gloating ha ha on some kind of dead
[1:21:17] carrier ha ha ha
[1:21:18] they're gloating about it princes
[1:21:20] they're going that I got a dead old word
[1:21:23] God sent a prophet
[1:21:24] now that's current word what I'm saying
[1:21:26] you've got
[1:21:27] to go past the gods and a prophet and
[1:21:29] find out what he said amen and receive
[1:21:32] the same Christ that he received how do
[1:21:35] you know it'll guide you into all truth
[1:21:37] amen that's how you know but see that's
[1:21:42] where we get a lot of message are just
[1:21:43] gloating I'm all right I'm okay and then
[1:21:47] supposed to be at least a honk that's a
[1:21:49] similar brother to the eagle the Prophet
[1:21:52] that brought the true word and
[1:21:53] manifested relies on the half ride
[1:21:56] man-made theology oh my goodness check
[1:22:00] let's see what I'm saying
[1:22:01] no more agonized no more asking the
[1:22:04] father right people in other words
[1:22:08] nobody a lot of people don't want to die
[1:22:10] out to the things of the world they
[1:22:12] still will love the things of the world
[1:22:14] see they don't really want to have
[1:22:15] prayer meetings and our prayer meeting
[1:22:18] is every Wednesday night 30 minutes
[1:22:20] before church every service and every
[1:22:22] Sunday morning at 10:30 our prayer
[1:22:24] meeting just so everybody knows we have
[1:22:27] to prayer meetings every week amen
[1:22:29] everybody's welcome to come but see this
[1:22:33] is the scripture we got to look to the
[1:22:35] scripture now go to Matthew 5:6 I know
[1:22:39] you like this one huh huh so this is all
[1:22:43] just striking me today as I was going
[1:22:44] through these scriptures she misses the
[1:22:47] millennium why she's virgin like she is
[1:22:50] not out there making love to Beyonce's
[1:22:53] songs she's not after watching The
[1:22:56] Rock's movies and making love to
[1:22:58] Hollywood she's not well then why don't
[1:23:01] she just enter in and make love to
[1:23:02] Christ she's foolish sure because she
[1:23:09] wants to do other things
[1:23:12] Matthew 5:6 well
[1:23:14] so they hunger and thirst after
[1:23:18] righteousness for they too busy on other
[1:24:10] things now the best illustration I think
[1:24:13] the easiest one for us is Abraham and
[1:24:15] lot right lot was a silver dollar
[1:24:18] I'm sorry Abraham was a silver dollar a
[1:24:20] lot was a penny what was law when
[1:24:23] Abraham said which way you want to go
[1:24:25] out what was he attracted by ah
[1:24:27] Sodom the plains near sound looked like
[1:24:33] he's attracted by money and then pretty
[1:24:36] soon he wanted political power because
[1:24:38] the Bible says at the gate and anyone
[1:24:41] that reads the Bible knows that the
[1:24:42] gates were they were the elders and
[1:24:44] judges the city right boys went to the
[1:24:47] games that bring me ten witnesses I'm by
[1:24:49] Naomi and Ruth all right ten I need any
[1:24:53] elders right here at the gate because
[1:24:54] that was the courthouse amen
[1:24:56] so luck got really caught up into the
[1:24:59] sodomite court system and politics and
[1:25:02] the money but the Bible said he was a
[1:25:05] righteous man see he took a little bit
[1:25:10] too much on the politics we like talking
[1:25:13] about politics in but we don't go too
[1:25:14] far right like we're like you're
[1:25:17] supposed to do to what you do you went a
[1:25:20] little too far on the money he kind of
[1:25:22] compromise to make a little more money
[1:25:26] he the by
[1:25:28] said he hung around the sodomites so
[1:25:30] much that every day affects his soul
[1:25:33] every day was the work he was just
[1:25:35] tormented tormented every day whenever I
[1:25:38] went to work it was glory what I had to
[1:25:48] do is just ask the Lord Lord I want to
[1:25:51] be there when the promised son comes but
[1:25:53] brother Ram said lot forgot about the
[1:25:55] promise see he was thirsty and hungry a
[1:26:13] little more for just the cares of the
[1:26:15] world I need to make a little more money
[1:26:17] to feed my children I need to make a
[1:26:22] have a little bit better job because I'm
[1:26:25] smarter right now I'm not telling you to
[1:26:31] take the lowest paying job I'm not
[1:26:32] telling you to do that
[1:26:33] what I'm telling you is to spiritually
[1:26:37] live so far away from Sodom that you can
[1:26:39] be like Abraham who had a trained army
[1:26:42] live separated and the son of man
[1:26:45] convicted him a man huh remember the son
[1:26:49] of man he said I'm not even going down
[1:26:51] in the sodomy I'm gonna send my angels
[1:26:53] or Robertson Billy Graham down there son
[1:26:58] of man ministry it's out there in the
[1:27:00] learners with Abraham because he's
[1:27:01] separated he's a friend of God amen
[1:27:04] he's hungry and thirsting for
[1:27:07] righteousness you know I was looking up
[1:27:09] Billy Graham and over obviously know
[1:27:11] Billy Graham and his wife cut her hair
[1:27:12] she wore dresses all her lives except I
[1:27:15] saw one picture where she had pants on
[1:27:16] right in the life she cut her hair she
[1:27:18] wore makeup but yet he fills stadiums
[1:27:24] that were so great hi sir he shook Bill
[1:27:29] Clinton's hand and Bill Clinton was a
[1:27:31] clear pure fornicator adulterer I wonder
[1:27:35] if he rebuked in church probably not
[1:27:39] but you can believe there are somebody
[1:27:41] rebuking Jacqueline Kennedy and now JFK
[1:27:45] you can believe that church amen when
[1:27:48] they heard they're not there's a manual
[1:27:51] and rebuking the fashions of the world
[1:27:53] the sanctification issues rebuking those
[1:27:56] because he knew if the people don't take
[1:27:58] care of those they'll never get born
[1:28:00] again you'll never get to the algebra if
[1:28:04] you don't get your ABCs right ha ha you
[1:28:08] know I found out to Billy Graham believe
[1:28:10] and he talked when you said I'm sorry
[1:28:12] Lord forgive me I'm repenting I'm
[1:28:14] becoming a Christian for the first time
[1:28:16] he said you're feeling all Dios Oh
[1:28:18] then he proves he wasn't perfect right
[1:28:21] man bruised he wasn't a prophet or
[1:28:23] albert's and bulldoze faith he prayed
[1:28:26] for 500 million just prayed to 5 right
[1:28:29] cuz he just bulldoze me
[1:28:31] bulldozing bulldoze me both ugly and
[1:28:33] people criticized brother ran for not
[1:28:35] praying for more feet height and burn
[1:28:37] actually go oh yeah me doing the angel
[1:28:39] says you're seen I think it was better
[1:28:47] his brother his gift was to reveal the
[1:28:49] power of arson my gift can't even hear
[1:28:52] you you've got to believe to be healed a
[1:28:54] man
[1:28:56] it's about touching Christ I knew it uh
[1:29:01] but you know Billy Robert same thing he
[1:29:04] thought his wife cuz then or cover her
[1:29:06] wear makeup sir and you know he talked
[1:29:09] about the only ghost you got to speak in
[1:29:10] tongues to get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:12] oh that's all the trouble with those men
[1:29:16] they're wrong on all these major
[1:29:18] doctrines and that's why they can never
[1:29:19] get born again praise God and church I
[1:29:25] appreciate a couple years ago
[1:29:26] I know six preachers that left the
[1:29:28] message and they're all wrong on the
[1:29:30] baptism the Holy Ghost some of them said
[1:29:33] you got it as soon as you as soon as you
[1:29:36] saw like a card like the man bro Graham
[1:29:38] story some of where we spent eternity
[1:29:40] some people took that quote and went too
[1:29:42] far with it some people said well you
[1:29:44] get it as soon as you turn that's just
[1:29:46] another Billy Graham doctrine some
[1:29:49] people said oh you got the Holy Ghost as
[1:29:50] long as you believe God sent a prophet
[1:29:52] and
[1:29:52] six preachers let's say that and all of
[1:29:56] them are on that side that side of the
[1:29:58] Holy Ghost without sensation but they
[1:30:00] never finished the quote but the Spirit
[1:30:03] of Christ doing the works in you the
[1:30:05] same works that he did in Christ so the
[1:30:15] foolish virgin doesn't really hunger
[1:30:17] enough for the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:30:19] is it thirsty enough for it doesn't
[1:30:23] really ask enough and you know our
[1:30:28] preachers recently you know Jesus
[1:30:30] offered the Holy Ghost to whosoever will
[1:30:32] twice twice let's read it
[1:30:36] John seven thirty nine thanks 38 so it
[1:30:44] is the you know church think about does
[1:30:48] Jesus invite the foolish version to get
[1:30:50] the Holy Ghost yes yes yes the food the
[1:30:54] foolish virgins were invited out sure
[1:30:56] they're invited out to them the
[1:30:59] bridegroom coming just like everybody
[1:31:00] else just like the five wise john 7:38
[1:31:04] i'm sorry let's go thirty-seven in the
[1:31:06] last day that great day of the feast
[1:31:08] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:31:10] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[1:31:12] what do you say any man praise God that
[1:31:15] means me amen
[1:31:18] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:31:19] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:31:21] rivers of living water but this he spake
[1:31:23] he of the Spirit which they that believe
[1:31:25] on him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:27] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[1:31:29] not yet glorified that means David John
[1:31:32] the Baptist he not everybody else the
[1:31:34] most was the baptism in their human
[1:31:37] spirit not in their soul praise God they
[1:31:41] could never have the Holy Ghost in their
[1:31:43] soul because it could not be given until
[1:31:46] Christ is glorified why is that because
[1:31:48] the sins weren't really paid for amen oh
[1:31:51] but once Jesus brother William I said he
[1:31:54] said touch me not let me a sin to my
[1:31:56] father
[1:31:56] I've gotta go up there I got this money
[1:32:00] and we
[1:32:01] gives me a new body and after that he'll
[1:32:05] your souls clean it's white as snow it's
[1:32:08] white clean by the fleet to the flood
[1:32:09] and now my Holy Ghost can feel that so
[1:32:12] lame a hey man I tried to straighten
[1:32:18] somebody on that this summer they were
[1:32:21] saying well yeah I can live a life and I
[1:32:23] can sit like David he said gosh they'll
[1:32:26] be saved like David because David
[1:32:27] commits adultery and God still loved him
[1:32:29] he was mad for God's own heart
[1:32:30] I said sir that's not what jesus said
[1:32:32] jesus said the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:32:34] till Jesus Christ was glorified I said
[1:32:38] there's a difference and the church said
[1:32:40] man amen
[1:32:43] any man that would do that today not
[1:32:45] born again cuz we've got a greater power
[1:32:49] it was so powerful that Jesus breathed
[1:32:51] arms so like my man said Jesus wants to
[1:33:00] give you the Holy Ghost more than we
[1:33:01] want it but the wise will get to the
[1:33:04] spot where they're hungry thirsty they
[1:33:07] understand the will of God they asked
[1:33:09] for and Jesus gives it to him amen
[1:33:12] revelation 22:17 so see Jesus plainly
[1:33:17] offers that whosoever any man who wants
[1:33:19] to be a wise virgin give me a wise
[1:33:21] virgin revelation 22:17
[1:33:26] and the spirit of the bride say come and
[1:33:28] let him in here say come and then him
[1:33:30] that is athirst come and whosoever will
[1:33:32] let him come let him take the water of
[1:33:36] life freely not goodness
[1:33:40] praise God that whole time Billy Graham
[1:33:43] stone you got the Holy Ghost well he was
[1:33:45] a thunder of a preacher wouldn't he I
[1:33:46] just like listening to his voice every
[1:33:48] now and then I'll turn on the turn Mike
[1:33:49] who is that Billy Ray I don't listen to
[1:33:57] him too often but he's got the voice of
[1:33:59] an archangel right when you tell them
[1:34:01] you're born again but that was an
[1:34:04] uncertain sound brother William hey if
[1:34:07] you repent you're born again and you're
[1:34:09] drinking the waters of life
[1:34:11] a little uncertain sound everything else
[1:34:13] before that was a good oh you gotta get
[1:34:15] saved got on your baptized course he's a
[1:34:17] Trinitarian he did father's with all the
[1:34:18] ghosts in that oh thank God that we
[1:34:22] don't have an uncertain stop we've got a
[1:34:24] certain sound and it's not say it the
[1:34:26] Lord how do you sometimes Billy Graham
[1:34:31] will be seven and brother I would hear
[1:34:39] that news that doesn't sound like it
[1:34:41] everyone else is like and they want to
[1:34:45] go make love to every other demons out
[1:34:47] there but Billy's thought Billy's like
[1:34:50] you already got it you already got no
[1:34:54] cry made a decision
[1:34:56] all right now my card I promise to come
[1:34:58] a hundred times a year to church sign
[1:35:01] the cards right then Burroughs that
[1:35:04] Billy Graham told him he said there's
[1:35:06] all the preachers fine thirty thousand
[1:35:08] converts I can't find thirty
[1:35:10] my dad said you ruin it wrong he said
[1:35:13] the way Paul did it went pulled in there
[1:35:15] he got three converse the next year come
[1:35:17] back he had thirty he said that's
[1:35:18] because Paul took him all the way to the
[1:35:20] baptism of the Holy but Billy was just
[1:35:25] saying you're filled already
[1:35:26] and I was they had maybe was the Red Sea
[1:35:29] they pass through the Red Sea and
[1:35:31] they're so happy ba made a decision
[1:35:33] praise God
[1:35:34] you got a long trip to go buddy there's
[1:35:37] more than trip to go and all Roberts he
[1:35:42] went over brother William he went over
[1:35:44] and he carried back the grapes and come
[1:35:45] back and said hey if you get these great
[1:35:47] oh you gotta be born together with you
[1:35:56] got a speaking tiny uncertain sound you
[1:36:09] got to repent you got to be baptized you
[1:36:12] got to be sanctified you have to hunger
[1:36:14] thirst ask and be filled with the Holy
[1:36:17] game and praise God this makes the
[1:36:21] difference between the wise and the
[1:36:24] foolish
[1:36:24] right the Y's are really hungry for it
[1:36:28] and the Y's are really thirsty for the
[1:36:30] Y's really want to make love to Jesus oh
[1:36:36] that's beautiful church oh my goodness
[1:36:44] go to uh I gotta look it up go to Luke
[1:36:52] alright I don't have it in front of me I
[1:36:54] just kind of came to my heart yeah Luke
[1:37:00] eight
[1:37:01] I'll just showed up here okay so the
[1:37:04] foolish version church is that third
[1:37:06] round not the fourth the fourth is the
[1:37:08] good grub the third one that springs up
[1:37:10] they got a start but they get choked out
[1:37:13] and they never bring forth the fruit of
[1:37:16] the Holy Ghost cuz they ain't born to
[1:37:18] the Holy Ghost yet so they can't produce
[1:37:21] the fruit of it that's right
[1:37:23] they impersonate it I like the kind no
[1:37:27] priest they impersonate it but it ain't
[1:37:29] the genuine fruit it's a human faith a
[1:37:33] human now human virtue human patients it
[1:37:36] ain't the real thing because when it
[1:37:39] comes to the word oh I need but there
[1:37:42] you said how to be read baptized they
[1:37:57] only got to talk to you about over there
[1:37:58] and they just got a look at your car
[1:37:59] praise God
[1:38:00] oh my god glory and that would spell mum
[1:38:06] thorns are they which remember these are
[1:38:08] foods versions they that have heard they
[1:38:09] heard the message go forth and are
[1:38:12] choked with the cares and riches and
[1:38:16] pleasures of this life now listeners
[1:38:20] they're not even making love to it
[1:38:22] they're not even making love to the
[1:38:24] cares or the riches or pleasures because
[1:38:26] they're virgins praise God
[1:38:28] they're virgins but they just put a like
[1:38:31] lot like what they just put a little
[1:38:33] more emphasis on the cares
[1:38:38] on the ridges on the pleasures seems
[1:38:45] like they do they just keep putting it
[1:38:46] off a little bit no I'll sleep through
[1:38:47] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:48] next well I'll take some time and really
[1:38:53] get down to business with God once the
[1:38:55] kids are grown up I'll be a prayer
[1:38:58] warrior when I'm 50 you might not live
[1:39:01] 250 right see but what does the wise do
[1:39:06] redeems the time right now I know what
[1:39:10] God wants me to do right now foolish is
[1:39:13] like I'll try this I'll try but the wise
[1:39:19] knows exactly where God wants me to walk
[1:39:21] I know what I'm called to do I'm asking
[1:39:23] I'm hungry I'm thirsty and I'm receiving
[1:39:26] a new seat but on the good ground are
[1:39:31] they which an honest and good heart so
[1:39:34] see the foolish version are not really
[1:39:36] honest with themselves having heard the
[1:39:42] word keep it and bring forth fruit with
[1:39:44] patience here go to this one go to
[1:39:50] second Corinthians 7:1 I know this is a
[1:39:54] hard message tonight but you enjoyed I
[1:39:56] am I sure enjoy bringing it it's more
[1:40:00] fun to live it no sir not for is more
[1:40:02] joyous to live it I know yeah
[1:40:04] now how many Christians will read their
[1:40:07] Bibles about booze virgin and how many
[1:40:10] watch you fulfill just verse 1 of this
[1:40:11] of this chapter Sankar than 7 1 because
[1:40:18] most people just get lazier as they get
[1:40:20] older they get more laid-back I said
[1:40:22] most at all most people just try to obey
[1:40:28] my man said just try to soak in with the
[1:40:32] preachers of preaching rather squishing
[1:40:34] it out there just trying to just try to
[1:40:38] get something to kind of to wet me up
[1:40:40] I'm so Dharana cuz I'm I'm not born
[1:40:42] again just try let me soak up a little
[1:40:45] bit of the anointing see we gotta have
[1:40:46] anointing every day praise God
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:51] singer these 71 having there
[1:40:54] affecting holiness in the fear of God
[1:40:57] which I'm not gonna say denomination
[1:40:59] which message believer you know cause
[1:41:01] the church with this attitude Lord and
[1:41:04] there's anything filthy but how many do
[1:41:12] you know that when they come out of
[1:41:14] church God's really butter and they're
[1:41:16] just they got the joy the Lord and they
[1:41:18] just they're going from glory to glory
[1:41:19] they're getting more victory they can
[1:41:21] tell you a testimony God just delivered
[1:41:23] me of this God help me with that I'm
[1:41:25] overcoming here how many got that
[1:41:26] testimony amen
[1:41:33] so see the Fouche version is not totally
[1:41:36] honest with themselves though if we have
[1:41:40] servant after servant you gotta be born
[1:41:42] again you gotta be sanctified you gotta
[1:41:46] be ready for the rapture those are all
[1:41:48] true but they're not really honest I
[1:41:57] know one time I did this but I said
[1:42:00] don't judge yourself by what used to be
[1:42:02] he said judge yourself about what you
[1:42:03] are right now
[1:42:04] don't forget you you don't dump yeah
[1:42:07] don't forget where you put your signpost
[1:42:09] down but also don't live back there but
[1:42:12] a forwarding tribe be honest with
[1:42:16] ourselves clock is a busybody as Bill
[1:42:21] Graham said oh this is good tonight amen
[1:42:25] thank you lord
[1:42:28] that whole time Billy Graham's getting
[1:42:33] over robbers to getting people wear

[1:44:02] know what I much rather take these
[1:44:07] pleasures over here then go to prayer me
[1:44:09] oh I use that quote I much rather do
[1:44:14] this it's more pleasurable than praying
[1:44:17] and seeking God how many want a good
[1:44:24] heart Church yeah that's ten or feet I'm
[1:44:27] going a good and honest heart yes that's
[1:44:29] the odds one of my greatest prayers

[1:44:32] our church I'm not responsible for
[1:44:34] everyone out there I'm just responsible
[1:44:36] for this church right that's one of my
[1:44:38] greatest prayers Lord just give
[1:44:40] everybody in the honest heart and Jorge
[1:44:45] that's what I want too mercy we just
[1:44:47] went through the seasons right we all go
[1:44:50] through seasons I lose my confidence and
[1:44:52] pray for the sick but a man lost you
[1:44:55] know he lost his confidence of some of
[1:44:57] his gifts at times even for you for
[1:45:00] disobedience he lost the ability to use
[1:45:02] some of them right remember when he lied
[1:45:04] the angel said don't lay your line hands
[1:45:05] on the baby
[1:45:06] he could even exercise his gift cuz he
[1:45:08] send see there's times we get and lose
[1:45:11] there's all these seasons but the way to
[1:45:13] know is you're hungry
[1:45:15] and thirsty after right you're asking
[1:45:18] for it good and honest heart I thank God
[1:45:25] brother ray that we got a trumpet that
[1:45:27] declares a certain sound tonight I thank
[1:45:31] the Lord for that grace God that our
[1:45:34] prophet pointed us right to the Word of
[1:45:36] God that we have to live a separated
[1:45:40] life we have to live an honest life that
[1:45:44] we can't get caught up or choked up with
[1:45:48] the cares and riches and pleasures of
[1:45:50] this life my let's just bow our heads
[1:45:59] here for a moment as I God's grace this
[1:46:02] struck me so hard this morning I just
[1:46:03] had a preacher those things weren't my
[1:46:04] notes for the sermon I didn't get half
[1:46:07] of the money I'm thinking I just
[1:46:09] couldn't avoid that when I saw that
[1:46:10] quote but I said the first person are
[1:46:12] gonna miss out and it's so beautiful
[1:46:14] they don't even know what they're
[1:46:15] missing out we don't want to miss on
[1:46:19] that we need to redeem the time and just
[1:46:23] church the thing to do if you want to
[1:46:25] redeem it just act just do something
[1:46:27] just do five extra minutes tomorrow or
[1:46:29] just do five extra minutes tonight just
[1:46:31] start acting and pretty soon keep it
[1:46:54] right there and pretty soon like this
