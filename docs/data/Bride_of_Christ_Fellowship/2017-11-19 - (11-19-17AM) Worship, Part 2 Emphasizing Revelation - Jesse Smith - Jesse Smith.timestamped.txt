[33:54] blood ready to atone for us O God to
[33:57] declare us righteous to forgive us as
[34:00] through the blood of Jesus Christ that
[34:02] we common it's the everlasting covenant
[34:04] Lord we know there come a time lord when
[34:07] we won't need the thought anymore will
[34:08] be completely changed how he longed to
[34:11] be of those bodies Oh God Lord until
[34:14] then we're grateful for this a lot of
[34:15] the everlasting covenant and no doubt
[34:18] will sing about the blood for all
[34:20] eternity hallelujah that you paid the
[34:23] price for our sins not only ours but for
[34:26] all men and all women or God we're
[34:29] grateful this morning take this word
[34:31] Lord break it to us now Lord Jesus
[34:33] minister to us by the Holy Spirit and
[34:35] Jesus Christ
[34:37] sure say I'm a standard pickup I was
[34:40] here to Matthew 16 knows I was preparing
[34:44] this week yesterday I just kind of went
[34:46] back to that worship I was suddenly did
[34:48] last Sunday night and I just wanted to
[34:50] go a little bit further with that so I'd
[34:52] like to become worship part to it I just
[34:55] want to have a subtopic as I told it on
[34:57] my sake emphasizing revelation just want
[34:59] to preach on that this thing I want to
[35:01] emphasize revelation because the Prophet
[35:05] said you can never overemphasize
[35:08] revelation I can never preach on it too
[35:11] long well Jess you've been preached on
[35:13] this for a year I know I've been
[35:14] preached on the church ages for a year
[35:16] but I could start a message I could
[35:18] start a series on Revelation and preach
[35:20] to the rapture and I would not preach it
[35:22] too much because you cannot
[35:24] overemphasize how important it is to
[35:27] have revelation I think we'll see why
[35:29] here to today just since a few simple
[35:32] examples Lord just I felt directed me to
[35:35] as I prepared yesterday I wasn't
[35:36] thinking about these examples I just
[35:38] felt like the Lord directed me to them
[35:40] I'll try to be mindful the time as well
[35:42] try to preach just an hour because I
[35:45] know we have communion in I know the
[35:46] little kiddies get hungry and everything
[35:48] like that and I know I know the pregnant
[35:51] moms get hungry too so I know my wife
[35:53] and sister Naomi I know they they get
[35:56] hungry so of course because they're
[35:58] bringing forth life amen
[36:00] preparing that body of that soul amen
[36:03] so let's go to Matthew 16 13 through 19
[36:06] will be our text Matthew 16 just so so
[36:09] familiar text but it's the text the
[36:12] Prophet uses in the church age book when
[36:13] he's when he makes a statement about you
[36:15] can never overemphasize Revelation so I
[36:19] want to just briefly read over that
[36:21] again and just make a few comments and
[36:23] we'll get to the bulk of the message you
[36:27] know we'll watch and see how the Holy
[36:28] Spirit Guides this you know my my desire
[36:31] my thought was to focus on Hannah
[36:33] and Abraham and Sarah this morning so
[36:35] we'll see how the Lord directs you know
[36:37] I always have my thoughts and I think
[36:39] this is the most important thing so
[36:41] we'll see what the Lord does this
[36:42] morning and how many know you're in
[36:44] control of the direction let me know
[36:45] that you're in control because you if
[36:47] you pull on God God will meet your need
[36:50] amen
[36:51] Matthew 16:13 for their say men
[36:57] I'll read 13 through 16 and then I'm
[37:03] sorry I read 13 to 17 and I think we'll
[37:05] all read 18 if that's okay so when Jesus
[37:08] came into the coasts of Caesarea
[37:09] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[37:11] whom do men say that I the Son of Man
[37:15] him and they said someday say thou art
[37:18] to John the Baptist some Elias and
[37:21] others Jeremias or one of the prophets
[37:22] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[37:25] I am and Simon Peter answered and said
[37:27] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[37:30] Living God and she's answered and said
[37:33] unto him blessed art thou simon barjona
[37:35] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[37:38] unto thee but my father which is in
[37:41] heaven now let's read verse 18 together
[37:44] one two three and I say also unto thee
[37:47] that thou art Peter and upon this rock I
[37:51] will build my church and the gates of
[37:53] Hell shall not prevail against it now
[37:56] read verse 19 and I will give unto thee
[37:58] the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[38:00] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[38:02] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[38:04] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[38:07] loosed in heaven amen may God add His
[38:10] blessings to the reading of his word you
[38:11] may be seated so I want to take a
[38:15] subtopic of emphasizing revelation this
[38:18] morning because you can never
[38:21] overemphasize it so I just want to make
[38:28] a few comments and observations you know
[38:29] I was actually listening to a sermon
[38:31] from Donny Reagan and he went over some
[38:32] of these things and I was reading the
[38:34] church age book and and so I thought my
[38:36] I heard for both I had both the sources
[38:38] here so I had I to witnesses you know on
[38:41] that and so I want to just make a few
[38:42] comments on emphasizing
[38:45] revelation in this passage here Matthew
[38:48] 16
[38:50] we know Simon Peter gives the right
[38:53] response he said the right thing praise
[38:55] God because he said thou art the Christ
[38:58] the Son of Living God most people that
[39:01] day didn't really believe he was the
[39:03] Christ they
[39:05] they were receiving miracles they were
[39:06] being blessed but they didn't really
[39:08] really believe he was that Messiah that
[39:11] was prophesied since the Garden of Eden
[39:14] they enjoyed the healings they enjoyed
[39:17] the revival atmospheres but they really
[39:20] didn't believe that he was what God said
[39:23] he was
[39:23] amen or what he claimed to be and so
[39:27] Peter had this special revelation or
[39:29] this special faith God had revealed to
[39:33] Peter that Jesus was indeed the Messiah
[39:35] the Christ and that's how it is today
[39:38] people like atmospheres of revival they
[39:42] like good feelings they like big groups
[39:43] and and signs wonders miracles we all
[39:46] like that Peter like that but Peter
[39:49] wanted all that the Messiah had amen he
[39:53] wanted the full Ministry of the Messiah
[39:54] not just a partial ministry of the
[39:57] Messiah and that's what we want today
[39:59] we're thankful when God heals and God
[40:01] saves and and so forth but we want all
[40:03] that the Messiah has for us today praise
[40:07] God because remember Jesus told Oum mber
[40:13] they picked it up in Acts chapter 3
[40:15] let's go there I believe was Peter
[40:18] picked it up in Acts chapter 3 and he
[40:22] said that Christ was a the anti-type of
[40:26] Moses so let's go to Acts chapter 3 and
[40:28] all that dot did not hear Christ would
[40:32] be destroyed remember that in the
[40:33] scripture and so people want some of
[40:36] what Christ says but if they don't take
[40:38] all of it then there's a chance they
[40:40] might be destroyed right and God is only
[40:42] judged God is one who knows so let's go
[40:48] to verse 21 now acts 3:21 is our famous
[40:50] message Scripture it's the message of
[40:53] our day scripture which I love this is
[40:55] this the scripture is so beautiful whom
[40:58] the heaven must receive until the times
[41:00] of restitution or restoration of all
[41:05] things so Paul's right there so heaven
[41:07] is going to hold the body of Jesus
[41:10] Christ until everything is restored back
[41:14] to the Apostolic Way
[41:15] praise the Lord somebody asked me on
[41:17] YouTube are you want to
[41:18] apostolic and everything like that and
[41:21] you part of that denomination I said
[41:22] absolutely not but I do hold the faith
[41:24] of the Apostolic fathers I'm not a part
[41:27] of that organization but I'm a part of
[41:29] the faith I'm preaching the same thing
[41:31] Paul preached amen I'm preaching the
[41:34] same thing Peter preached by God's grace
[41:37] hallelujah well see heaven must hold the
[41:40] body of Christ until everything's
[41:42] restore once everything's restored then
[41:44] Jesus can come right come back that's
[41:46] why we still believe there's power to be
[41:48] restored how many know that there are
[41:50] souls to be won there's work to be done
[41:53] we know there's still more restoration
[41:55] to come that's why our face should grow
[41:57] Church as we see that Day approaching
[42:00] amen because we know God will bring his
[42:02] true bride back to all that they were at
[42:05] the beginning amen that's why we don't
[42:07] get discouraged you if we go through a
[42:08] little cold times brother Branham said
[42:10] he and brother Neville would would join
[42:12] arm and arm there before Christ at the
[42:15] at the time when rewards are driven out
[42:17] he said we would stand there and be so
[42:20] happy that we stood for Christ in the
[42:21] hot and cold times amen
[42:25] how they know you're not so we are we're
[42:26] standing here amongst hot times a
[42:28] revival cold times of struggle and trial
[42:31] we stand here in the hot and cold
[42:33] knowing that there's a great reward to
[42:35] those who faithfully serve the Lord
[42:36] Jesus Christ amen it's exactly right and
[42:39] as we go there we know that the people
[42:42] of God are going to fall under the
[42:43] expectation of the hour they're gonna
[42:45] fall under the influence of the prophecy
[42:48] of this scripture that all things must
[42:50] be restored Christ will stay there until
[42:53] the restitution of all things and I'm
[42:55] part of the restitution of all the word
[42:58] amen we are a part of that amen
[43:01] so while the effects get more and more
[43:03] honest that doesn't discourage we just
[43:05] pressed through that and we look for God
[43:07] to do more in our lives amen because
[43:09] that's the time we're living in darker
[43:11] and darker more deception more deception
[43:13] but when as we gather in the house of
[43:15] God we get more and more truth amen
[43:17] now which God has spoken by the mouth of
[43:21] all his holy prophets since the world
[43:22] began now here we go
[43:24] for Moses truly said unto the father's a
[43:26] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[43:28] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[43:31] him shall ye hear in
[43:32] what all things whatsoever he shall say
[43:36] unto you and that's what makes us
[43:39] message believers and that's what makes
[43:41] everybody else foolish virgin who saved
[43:44] because the message believer the true
[43:46] believer in Christ wants to obey obey
[43:48] all the Word of God and they don't get
[43:51] to the spot where I've had enough well
[43:53] right I think I've done enough I think
[43:55] God's happy with me no they are
[43:56] constantly hungry for more and more
[43:58] righteousness because the Holy Spirit in
[44:02] them is hungry for more of the Word of
[44:04] God to be more like Jesus amen
[44:07] they want to obey all the word of Christ
[44:11] now 23 and it shall come to pass that
[44:14] every soul which will not hear that
[44:16] prophet didn't say that you know
[44:18] wouldn't not be healed or something like
[44:20] that you have to hear hallelujah you
[44:22] must hear shall be what destroyed from
[44:26] among the people the people loved to say
[44:30] oh jesus is son of God he's he's our
[44:32] salvation but they forget about this
[44:34] that you must hear everything the
[44:36] Prophet said two million people heard
[44:38] Moses but most of them were destroyed
[44:40] because they didn't go all the way
[44:43] showing they really didn't believe the
[44:45] Word of God but you and I are going all
[44:47] the way how do you know because we're
[44:49] gathering here in the name of Jesus
[44:51] Christ were receiving the Word of God we
[44:53] see God restoring his word to our lives
[44:55] amen it's exactly right hallelujah and
[44:59] while others fall away our hearts are
[45:01] distressed for them and as they flirt
[45:04] with the world we pray for them we we
[45:06] plead with them we do everything we can
[45:08] to try to bring them back but ultimately
[45:10] you and I will answer for ourselves amen
[45:13] and we know if we hunger and thirst we
[45:15] shall be filled we must be those that
[45:17] are part of that restitution amen that's
[45:20] our burden for our lives amen
[45:22] everybody has to make that decision for
[45:24] themselves are they gonna be lukewarm
[45:26] and said I have enough of God or are
[45:28] they gonna hunger for more and we want
[45:29] to be a part of the restitution amen so
[45:33] there you go that's that's that
[45:33] scripture right there and I want to just
[45:36] you see that is that a blessing to you
[45:38] sometimes we forget about those and the
[45:40] Holy Spirit brought that to me that was
[45:41] that was not my notes I was the Holy
[45:43] Spirit preaching that so see we must
[45:44] obey all that the law
[45:46] has for us amen now Jesus said let's go
[45:51] back to Matthew 16 here I want to just
[45:53] make a couple more comments on this
[45:55] before we move on he says thou art the
[46:05] Christ the Son of the Living God
[46:06] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[46:09] and blood hath not revealed unto thee
[46:10] but my father which is in heaven you
[46:15] know that ought to be our desires be
[46:17] able to look somebody in the face and
[46:18] say you know no no preacher talked me
[46:20] into being in the message my family
[46:23] member talked me into this the heavenly
[46:25] father revealed that this was the truth
[46:28] because even Jesus Jesus had not even I
[46:32] I'm not the one who gave this revelation
[46:34] God gave you this revelation and when we
[46:37] can locate the time of our life when the
[46:39] father revealed that and the father
[46:41] dropped that down it was no longer our
[46:44] effort or our I'm hanging on to my mom's
[46:46] testimony and she's gonna pull me
[46:49] through but when it became your
[46:50] testimony when the revelation became
[46:52] yours that's the moment the father gave
[46:55] you the revelation of this word amen
[46:57] it's not built upon your well about your
[47:00] previous pastor or for me my previous
[47:03] pastor that's not where the revelation
[47:05] is the revelation came from your
[47:06] heavenly pastor amen
[47:08] your heavenly father Jesus Christ amen
[47:11] and I thought I heard about Donnie say
[47:14] that really helped me out he said up
[47:18] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[47:21] the gates of Hell will not prevail
[47:22] against it the word will which was
[47:25] showing that he Jesus Christ had not
[47:27] built the church yet I thought what a
[47:30] good thought I never I never really
[47:31] thought about debt because he started
[47:34] building his church on the day of
[47:35] Pentecost Laurie that was the birth of
[47:39] the church because now they're already
[47:42] called now they're called out amen and
[47:44] they're into the land right they got
[47:46] called out out of Egypt their to go
[47:48] through justification to the Red Sea
[47:50] sanctification wilderness but once they
[47:52] got in the land now they could say we
[47:54] are the called out ones because the
[47:56] redemption has been completed amen
[47:59] Redemption wasn't good
[48:00] when they got to the Red Sea it wasn't
[48:02] completing the wilderness they had to
[48:04] get in the Promised Land and get
[48:06] circumcised and then the redemption was
[48:08] complete amen and that's what we see
[48:11] Jesus saying I'm going to build my
[48:12] church I haven't built it yet and that's
[48:14] what we're saying today when we get
[48:16] filled with the Holy Ghost now we're a
[48:18] part of the church that Jesus is
[48:20] building amen and he's building it step
[48:23] by step with Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum
[48:24] Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and he's
[48:28] finishing with you and I in the
[48:30] Laodicean Church age amen he's finishing
[48:32] building his church upon those who are
[48:35] filled with the holy spirit it's exactly
[48:37] right
[48:38] hey man and that just was a blessing to
[48:40] me he will build it and then he said the
[48:45] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[48:48] that great that word gate in the Greek
[48:50] means councils
[48:52] did you know that hell has a council
[48:55] against you hell wants to destroy Adam
[48:57] Rigo hell wants to destroy Jesse Smith
[49:01] let me know that the Bible said the
[49:03] accusers of the Brethren accused you
[49:05] before the throne of God day and night
[49:08] they have plans to destroy your life
[49:11] they have plans to try to kill you to
[49:13] steal kill and destroy you but when
[49:16] you've got revelation those gates and
[49:18] councils of Satan cannot prevail against
[49:22] you amen
[49:23] they cannot pull you no man she'll be
[49:26] able to pluck them out of my father's
[49:27] hand amen the gates of Hell cannot
[49:31] prevail against the revelation that the
[49:33] father gave you that's why the father
[49:35] gave me that revelation amen so the
[49:37] gates of hell couldn't conquer against
[49:39] you you have nothing to fear as
[49:41] believers we've just got to remember and
[49:44] that our minds be stirred up by
[49:46] remembrance amen remember what you
[49:48] received remember where you came from
[49:50] remember whose side you're on
[49:52] remember where you got that revelation
[49:53] remember where you got the Holy Ghost
[49:55] amen and stand up on that word and
[49:58] believe it with all your heart amen
[50:00] exactly right it wasn't built upon Peter
[50:05] as the Prophet said because God couldn't
[50:07] build it upon a backsliding cussing
[50:09] preacher he couldn't build it upon that
[50:12] but he built it upon the
[50:14] Rock of Revelation the rock of faith
[50:16] amen now I that that faith that because
[50:20] faith means assurance so upon that
[50:22] assurance of thus saith the Lord amen
[50:25] now remember the word worship we looked
[50:27] at last Sunday means to kiss like a dog
[50:32] licking his master's hand to fall in her
[50:37] Crouch to to prostrate oneself is that
[50:41] how you came in today like like a dog
[50:43] would approaches master I love you Jesus
[50:45] I love you Jesus
[50:46] I'm here to praise you that's what
[50:48] worship is its cuts running to the one
[50:51] you want to worship and just pouring out
[50:53] your praise and adoration I hope that's
[50:54] how you came to the house of Lord this
[50:56] morning that's worship and that's a true
[50:59] worshiper and God is seeking someone
[51:01] that will worship Him in that manner so
[51:05] like my question that Sunday who's truly
[51:06] worship me I'm truly worshiping you're
[51:08] truly worshiping if you're coming to
[51:10] Christ wanting to kiss him wanting to
[51:12] bless him wanting to love him wanting
[51:14] everyone to know that you love Jesus and
[51:16] Jesus only exactly right and remember
[51:22] the Prophet said this I'm gonna read it
[51:24] from the worst sinner in the city 1956
[51:26] the woman woman at Simon's house poured
[51:29] all the praise on him he said she didn't
[51:31] spare nothing she poured it all on him
[51:33] that's the way you got to come give him
[51:36] all the praise pour out all the glory on
[51:40] him did you know you have glory this
[51:41] morning you've got glory you got praise
[51:44] you've got feelings you've got emotions
[51:46] and he said you got to pour all your
[51:49] glory on Christ yeah lay everything down
[51:54] he said hallelujah that's why we can't
[51:57] have a revival it's because we're stingy
[51:59] with it
[52:00] our sister sang about revival this
[52:02] morning I thought that's so perfect we
[52:05] cannot have a riff we can't revive the
[52:07] life of God if we won't give God
[52:09] everything inside of our life amen
[52:11] right we got to give everything inside
[52:14] of us and then we can avert a vile
[52:16] because we got to pour all that he
[52:18] deserves all of our praise he deserves
[52:21] all of our worship and we all have glory
[52:23] that we must pour out upon him amen
[52:28] the Prophet said in all the days of our
[52:30] life I believe the Christian life is a
[52:31] continual sacrifice so see you have to
[52:34] learn to do that all every service week
[52:36] after week month after month let your
[52:38] life continually be a sacrifice he that
[52:42] come after me let him deny himself daily
[52:44] not every day not 46 days but every day
[52:47] take up his cross and follow me
[52:49] Christian life is one continually Lenten
[52:52] now lintons in the spring but he's
[52:54] taught he's kind of preaching on how
[52:55] they only sacrifice for forty some days
[52:57] instead of all year he said oh how the
[53:01] Christian loves to do it
[53:03] do you love to sacrifice do you love to
[53:06] not give your flesh what your flesh
[53:08] wants do you love to shut in with God
[53:10] and give God all your love in time the
[53:13] Christian loves to do it he doesn't do
[53:16] it with a grudge I guess I got to come
[53:19] to church alright I guess I got to fast
[53:21] I guess I better pray he said he does it
[53:24] with a feeling that he loves God and
[53:26] he's glad he can do it it's a joy to
[53:30] serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to
[53:34] sacrifice it's a joy to worship the Lord
[53:36] it's a joy to be called a fanatic for
[53:38] the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to
[53:41] take a stand for the right amen
[53:43] hallelujah and move against the wrong
[53:46] roof from the wrong he said it's a joy
[53:48] to praise him it's a joy to abstain from
[53:50] the things of the world now this is
[53:51] brother Branham it's not me it's brother
[53:53] Branham he says it's in their heart it's
[53:57] a perfect Lenten Lenten all the time
[53:58] God's Spirit comes into you and changes
[54:02] your desire a man beautiful thirsting
[54:06] for life in 1960 says it's my last one I
[54:09] move on if only men and women loved God
[54:13] as much as the world loves their
[54:14] pleasures the pleasure of a Christian
[54:18] brother man said is serving the Lord at
[54:21] the house of God and that's special to
[54:24] me because I'm a pastor I'm here every
[54:25] service and I love to see you here the
[54:28] pleasure of a Christian is serving the
[54:29] Lord at the house of God so if it's not
[54:32] a pleasure to come to church you got to
[54:33] check and see if you're backslidden or
[54:35] if you're not born again because this is
[54:37] the pleasure of a Christian you
[54:41] have to sign no cards he thought about
[54:43] the woman who signed to didn't have to
[54:45] sign a card to be down at the rock and
[54:46] roll concert you know because he was
[54:50] talking to a pastor and said well we put
[54:52] out a thousand invitations who will who
[54:54] will sign the card and say I'll be there
[54:55] every Sunday he said we got a couple of
[54:56] one or two cards back out of a thousand
[54:58] he said but a woman that loves rock and
[55:00] roll she don't have to sign her she
[55:02] don't have to sign a card the promise
[55:03] she'll be at the rock and roll concert
[55:04] that night he said because the love of
[55:06] rock and roll's in her and he said if
[55:08] only we could get the love of Christ and
[55:10] every believer Amen you want the sign of
[55:13] card he says you don't have to sign no
[55:15] cards you can't open the door quick
[55:17] enough I thought about that church door
[55:21] out there that church door out there we
[55:23] can't open it quick enough the Prophet
[55:25] says and if the members of the church
[55:27] love one another enough instead of a put
[55:30] up a little clicks and pulling away from
[55:32] the church brother if you love one
[55:34] another so much that it just hurts your
[55:36] heart until you got to get together
[55:37] again that's the way it should be I love
[55:41] those and I'm so glad they're not my
[55:43] words they're the prophets words
[55:45] hallelujah now let's go a little bit
[55:48] further let me read this quote now
[55:53] emphasizing revelation now I want to get
[55:55] to this stuff this is in page 13 of the
[55:58] church age book I preached us I think
[55:59] maybe last year now listen the
[56:02] importance of revelation by the spirit
[56:05] to a true believer can never be over
[56:10] emphasized I can never put too much
[56:13] emphasis on you must receive revelation
[56:16] you've got to receive the word you've
[56:17] got to have faith every see that you've
[56:20] got to receive faith I've got to receive
[56:22] faith
[56:22] I could never overemphasize that and he
[56:25] says revelation means more to you than
[56:27] perhaps you realize how many can say
[56:29] amen to that now I'm not talking about
[56:32] this book of Revelation in you he's not
[56:34] talk about just the book of Revelation
[56:35] he says I'm talking about all Revelation
[56:39] let's say already all revelation I'm
[56:41] talking about all revelation it can
[56:44] never be overemphasized it is
[56:47] tremendously important to the church do
[56:49] you remember Matthew 16 where Jesus
[56:51] asked the disciples the question of
[56:52] course we just read it
[56:54] the Roman
[56:55] like say the church is built upon Peter
[56:56] and that's really carnal how could God
[56:58] build the church upon a man so unstable
[57:00] that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed
[57:04] while doing it
[57:05] God doesn't notice Church upon unstable
[57:08] things he builds it upon stable firm
[57:11] things and the only firm thing we have
[57:14] is the Word of God that's what he builds
[57:17] his church upon it wasn't Peter unstable
[57:19] its upon the word upon Christ God can't
[57:23] build his church upon any man born in
[57:25] sin aren't you glad our church doesn't
[57:26] build upon brother branham aren't you
[57:29] glad it's not built upon John Wesley or
[57:30] Martin Luther they're all men they have
[57:32] sinned they could be unstable at times
[57:34] but the church is built upon the Word of
[57:37] God amen
[57:38] Jesus Christ and it wasn't some rock
[57:41] laying there as though God had hallowed
[57:43] the ground at that spot and it isn't as
[57:45] the Protestants say that the church is
[57:47] built upon Jesus it was the revelation
[57:50] he says of who Jesus was flesh and blood
[57:53] hath not revealed it but my father a
[57:55] tribunal and upon this rock revelation I
[57:58] will build my church the church is built
[58:00] upon revelation on the thus saith the
[58:04] Lord so now we know what revelation is
[58:07] it's thus saith the Lord from the Bible
[58:09] and that was one of the things the
[58:11] churches that when they voted out
[58:12] brother Stephen they didn't even believe
[58:13] women shouldn't cut their hair the end
[58:18] and the brother brother said he pointed
[58:20] them to the Word of God not to us we
[58:23] look at first Corinthians 11 and that's
[58:24] thus saith the Lord to us I'm not gonna
[58:27] let my hair grow up and put it in braids
[58:29] and dreadlocks and try to be like some
[58:30] of these other guys you know I'm not
[58:32] gonna do that because the word says it's
[58:34] a shame for men have long hair just as a
[58:37] shame for a man or a woman to be shorn
[58:39] if she's shorter trim she might as well
[58:41] be shaving the Bible says and so see to
[58:45] to certain people these words are not
[58:48] thus saith the Lord but to a woman or
[58:50] man who really believes the word and
[58:51] gods revealed that that's the word it's
[58:54] a revelation to that it's now saith the
[58:56] Lord and if God tells him something and
[58:58] it straight from God they're gonna obey
[59:00] and because they're filled with God's
[59:01] love to see those things you see when
[59:06] people struggle with these things they
[59:07] never had the revelation they never
[59:09] I really thought it was the say at the
[59:11] Lord to begin with aren't you glad you
[59:13] know is the say the Lord
[59:14] hey man remember Bram said thus saith
[59:18] the Lord of woman cuts her hair I don't
[59:19] care how much he dances and sings she's
[59:20] not born again she's dead and I'm dead
[59:24] too the holy ghost dead too being born
[59:25] in the soul because that's what the Word
[59:28] of God teaches us the Prophet said how
[59:32] did Abel know what to do in order to
[59:34] offer proper sacrifice to God by faith
[59:38] he received the revelation of the blood
[59:40] oh wow hallelujah the revelation of the
[59:45] blood Abel had a revelation of the blood
[59:48] of the Lamb God let him know that you
[59:52] got to bring the blood of an innocent
[59:54] humble spotless pure creature that's the
[59:58] only sacrifice I'll accept for your sins
[1:00:01] and God revealed that to him - Abel it
[1:00:04] wasn't like oh I guess I better go get
[1:00:05] my lamb - Abel it was I love to get the
[1:00:08] lamb because God revealed to me that's
[1:00:10] the only way he'll forgive me that's the
[1:00:12] only way to fellowship with God is
[1:00:14] through the bloody lamb don't you
[1:00:17] appreciate that amen that's what Abel
[1:00:19] had he knew what properly sacrificed to
[1:00:23] God but he said Cain didn't get such a
[1:00:26] revelation even though he had a
[1:00:29] commandment so Cain had the commandment
[1:00:30] but it never became a revelation see how
[1:00:33] that you can hear the preaching can hear
[1:00:35] the commands you can hear him hear him
[1:00:36] here but until they become yours until
[1:00:39] the father lets it drop down in your
[1:00:40] heart it's not really a revelation to
[1:00:42] you and so he couldn't offer the right
[1:00:46] sacrifice came because it never became a
[1:00:48] revelation it never became a faith like
[1:00:50] all this is God he thought of just rules
[1:00:53] you got to go through rules gotta
[1:00:55] grudgingly do this okay okay and he
[1:00:58] compromise on it he said it was
[1:01:01] revelation from God that made the
[1:01:03] difference and gave abel eternal life
[1:01:05] you might take what the pastor says or
[1:01:08] what the seminary teachers and though it
[1:01:09] might be taught to you with eloquence
[1:01:11] until God reveals it to you that Jesus
[1:01:14] is the Christ and that it is the blood
[1:01:16] that cleanses you and that God is your
[1:01:18] Savior you will never have eternal life
[1:01:21] amen
[1:01:23] did everybody see Wednesday when I put
[1:01:25] that Eve Angie came up there did anybody
[1:01:26] get to watch it you get to watch it okay
[1:01:29] it's just this little cube it's a
[1:01:31] cardboard cube with pictures on it and
[1:01:33] it has seven steps of the gospel and you
[1:01:36] might think that's pretty carnal but
[1:01:37] Church the first time I started teaching
[1:01:39] that to the children I started crying
[1:01:41] and the other kids are just like you
[1:01:44] know that's pretty cool yeah and you
[1:01:47] know we've got to be careful that the
[1:01:50] gospel doesn't lose its personal value
[1:01:55] I'm a grown man I'm 37 now almost 40 I'm
[1:02:01] a grown man and I can look at little
[1:02:02] cartoons of Jesus dying on the cross and
[1:02:04] it makes me cry makes me weep because I
[1:02:07] so appreciate what Christ has done
[1:02:10] because it wasn't a pastor that put that
[1:02:13] in my heart it wasn't my life it wasn't
[1:02:16] my brother
[1:02:16] it was the Heavenly Father who revealed
[1:02:19] to me that Jesus died for me amen
[1:02:22] and I'm saved by the grace of God I am a
[1:02:26] new creature I'm not the old person I'm
[1:02:28] a new creature all things are become new
[1:02:31] let me say it again all things all my
[1:02:33] life has become new praise God part of
[1:02:36] my life shouldn't feel old and new part
[1:02:38] of my life should feel new in Christ
[1:02:41] they knew it yeah it does amen but
[1:02:44] that's what we're talking about when it
[1:02:45] becomes a personal revelation to you the
[1:02:48] spiritual revelation said it's the
[1:02:50] spiritual revelation that does it all
[1:02:53] right now we know the scripture
[1:02:59] go to Romans chapter 10 I want to spend
[1:03:03] a little bit this is my main direction I
[1:03:07] thought like I like to go by God's grace
[1:03:08] revelation 10 revelation 10 revelation
[1:03:19] 10 about faith cometh by hearing let's
[1:03:22] just read over that again now if you
[1:03:26] know verses eight down to 15 God God
[1:03:32] tells Paul that this is how you become a
[1:03:35] Christian you cannot heat you cannot
[1:03:36] believe unless you hear a preacher
[1:03:38] there's another way to receive salvation
[1:03:41] you've got to believe the word that's
[1:03:43] being preached and then faith comes by
[1:03:45] hearing that's the context now look at
[1:03:48] verse 16 after how blessed are the
[1:03:50] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:03:51] preach the gospel verse 16 for they have
[1:03:53] not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah
[1:03:55] said Lord who hath believed our report
[1:03:59] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:04:02] hearing by the word of God
[1:04:06] verse 18 but I say have they not heard
[1:04:09] yes verily their sound went into all the
[1:04:11] earth and their words unto the ends of
[1:04:13] the world but I say did not Israel know
[1:04:16] first Moses say that I will provoke you
[1:04:18] to jealousy by them
[1:04:27] you
[1:04:30] if all day long have I stretched forth
[1:04:32] my hands unto disobedient and gainsaying
[1:04:34] people what a thought the gospel
[1:04:39] revelation only comes when you hear a
[1:04:41] preacher and believe the Word of God if
[1:04:44] you can accept that word and you don't
[1:04:46] accept that word then the Bible says
[1:04:48] right here it's a spirit of unbelief
[1:04:51] praise God and it can be in any service
[1:04:53] they don't have to be just when you're
[1:04:54] not saved it can be when you're saved it
[1:04:57] can be when you've been called out like
[1:04:58] Israel they come out of Egypt but when
[1:05:00] they heard it then they stopped
[1:05:01] believing it they stopped moving on with
[1:05:04] God we must keep moving on with God it's
[1:05:06] so important faith comes by hearing and
[1:05:08] hearing by the Word of God amen we
[1:05:11] should receive some precious portion of
[1:05:14] faith this morning amen
[1:05:16] we should receive some revelation some
[1:05:19] thus saith the Lord some word to us we
[1:05:21] should receive something this morning
[1:05:23] that's why we gather so the gifts of God
[1:05:25] can minister to us and raise our faith
[1:05:27] to another level amen absolutely and
[1:05:31] that's what will overcome the gates of
[1:05:34] Hell the counsels of hell that are
[1:05:36] against you and I hallelujah it only
[1:05:38] comes by hearing the Word of God now the
[1:05:42] Prophet tells us how to get in the
[1:05:44] spirit in order to hear from the spirit
[1:05:46] because revelation 1:10 says I was in
[1:05:49] the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard
[1:05:52] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:05:55] he was in the spirit and he heard the
[1:05:57] voice of the Lord talking behind him and
[1:06:00] he had a turn look at the voice
[1:06:02] hallelujah and the voice was a person it
[1:06:04] came from a person Jesus Christ the
[1:06:07] Prophet says he said I was in the spirit
[1:06:12] isn't that just beautiful
[1:06:13] you could call those words the whole of
[1:06:16] the Christian life I read this last year
[1:06:19] but listen again when someone says I'm
[1:06:21] walking the spirit they have they have
[1:06:26] placed themselves in the most important
[1:06:29] place they could possibly you understand
[1:06:32] what forgive me if I'm not saying the
[1:06:33] right way when you're when you can say
[1:06:36] I'm walking the Holy Spirit this morning
[1:06:38] brother Jesse when you can say that you
[1:06:40] know you're in the perfect will of God
[1:06:43] the whole of the Christian life that is
[1:06:44] the whole purpose of the Christian life
[1:06:46] is to say I'm walking in the spirit
[1:06:48] right now I'm not following the things
[1:06:51] of the flesh I'm walking I'm led by the
[1:06:53] Holy Ghost right now when you can say
[1:06:56] that you have reached the perfect will
[1:06:59] of God and the importance of that can
[1:07:02] never be overemphasized so many people
[1:07:05] are just content to walk in the
[1:07:06] permissive will of God but if you're not
[1:07:08] careful the permissive will of God often
[1:07:10] leads names to be blotted off the book
[1:07:13] like Balaam like Judas when they get
[1:07:17] comfortable and the perfect permissive
[1:07:18] will of God we cannot walk in the
[1:07:20] permissive will of God very long we've
[1:07:22] got to say God forgive me and let me go
[1:07:24] back to the place where I left you
[1:07:29] because we know there's cases in Abraham
[1:07:31] member there's cases he was in the
[1:07:32] perfect will of God
[1:07:33] and he stepped out and went down to
[1:07:35] Egypt you remember that what do you have
[1:07:36] to do we had to come right back to where
[1:07:38] he left God praise the Lord and only
[1:07:42] then could he say now I'm in the perfect
[1:07:45] will of God now walking the spirit
[1:07:47] before he wasn't and see people will
[1:07:50] spend weeks years decades in the
[1:07:52] permissive will of God but they need to
[1:07:54] go back to where they left the word
[1:07:56] where they're stopped obeying the
[1:07:57] commands go back there and when they get
[1:07:59] there they can say now I'm in the spirit
[1:08:02] on the Lord's Day amen
[1:08:04] they're not in the spirit until they
[1:08:07] repent of their sins and get back to
[1:08:09] where they left Christ exactly right
[1:08:12] that is the whole of the Christian life
[1:08:17] so that is the the goal the Christian
[1:08:19] life is to say I'm in the spirit I'm not
[1:08:21] disobeying any word I'm in the spirit on
[1:08:23] the Lord's Day
[1:08:25] if we're gonna live as Christians we
[1:08:27] have to be in a spirit the Prophet said
[1:08:30] it has to be the Spirit of God with us -
[1:08:33] or all of our efforts in vain Paul said
[1:08:38] I'll pray in the spirit I'll sing in the
[1:08:39] spirit I'll live in the spirit if
[1:08:41] there's anything good that will come -
[1:08:43] Jesse Smith it has to be revealed by the
[1:08:46] Holy Spirit
[1:08:47] he said confirmed by the word and made
[1:08:50] manifest by the results that it bears
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:53] that's why we should rejoice when we get
[1:08:54] results from praying for the sick
[1:08:56] get results from preaching or results
[1:08:58] from people being blessed or saved or
[1:09:00] delivered that's why we're here e joyce
[1:09:02] because we can look back and say i was
[1:09:03] in the spirit amen i was not walking by
[1:09:06] the flesh i was in the spirit on the
[1:09:08] lord's day i was doing the whole desire
[1:09:10] i was in the perfect will of God I did
[1:09:13] all that God wanted me to do I was
[1:09:14] walking in the spirit and that can never
[1:09:17] be overemphasized are you walking the
[1:09:22] spirit are you walking in the permissive
[1:09:23] will of God the Prophet said as John
[1:09:32] needed to be in the spirit to receive
[1:09:33] these tremendous revelations fresh from
[1:09:35] Jesus we need to be in the spirit to
[1:09:37] understand the revelations that God has
[1:09:39] given to us to live by his word for it
[1:09:41] is the same spirit and then he quotes
[1:09:43] acts 2:38 repent be baptized and you
[1:09:45] shall be through what the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:47] said why don't people get filled only
[1:09:48] ghosts because they don't get in the
[1:09:49] spirit of the scripture first if you got
[1:09:53] in the spirit nobody said you would
[1:09:54] repent of all your sins you would live a
[1:09:56] sanctified life and then the Holy Ghost
[1:09:57] would fill you so they don't get in the
[1:10:01] spirit how many times have we seen that
[1:10:02] how many people we baptized that we
[1:10:05] think they're in the spirit I talked to
[1:10:06] them and they can answer every question
[1:10:08] correctly
[1:10:09] yes I've repented yes and then you
[1:10:11] baptize them there stay there alive for
[1:10:13] a few weeks or months or whatever and
[1:10:14] then pretty soon they fall away see they
[1:10:16] never had the revelation of repentance
[1:10:18] in the first place they never did for
[1:10:22] those of us who have we had it I got it
[1:10:26] I got it from Jesus amen I got it from
[1:10:28] the Heavenly Father he did reveal to me
[1:10:30] and now my life is totally different
[1:10:31] because I'm walking in the spirit now
[1:10:33] glory hallelujah program said they never
[1:10:39] got in his spirit or it would happen to
[1:10:41] them exactly as the word says he said
[1:10:44] pray to God for revelation by his Spirit
[1:10:46] that is the first step get in the spirit
[1:10:49] what is the first step to walk in the
[1:10:51] spirit pray until you get in the spirit
[1:10:54] of the scripture he says
[1:11:00] to get in the spirit and then things
[1:11:02] will be done don't go through the acts
[1:11:04] first get in the spirit and then go
[1:11:06] through the acts and watch what God will
[1:11:08] do so what's the first step if if I'm
[1:11:13] emphasizing revelation what's the first
[1:11:15] step for revelation prayer prayer
[1:11:19] reflection examining your life which we
[1:11:22] have communion in a few minutes here let
[1:11:23] me set a timer I'll go half give me half
[1:11:25] an hour more but it's only 12:10 here
[1:11:28] examining your life am I in the
[1:11:30] permissive will am i down in Egypt or am
[1:11:32] I in the promised land am i sacrificing
[1:11:34] at the right altar am am I where God
[1:11:37] wants me to be hallelujah and I know I
[1:11:45] am like my own personal testimony I've
[1:11:47] asked God if you want me to go for me
[1:11:49] leave Akron you know open doors you want
[1:11:51] me to stay give me do these in these
[1:11:52] signs and gods always give me the sign
[1:11:54] so I can stand there like Guinean I know
[1:11:56] where I'm supposed to be I know I'm in
[1:11:58] the perfect will of God
[1:11:59] but it has to be a revelation it has to
[1:12:01] be revealed to you and we've got to get
[1:12:03] in the spirit of Prayer so once we're in
[1:12:05] the spirit of prayer the Holy Spirit can
[1:12:07] reveal to us the thus saith the Lord for
[1:12:09] you and I it's quite quite plain Roger
[1:12:12] just want to bring these out again and I
[1:12:15] can never overemphasize this I'm gonna
[1:12:16] keep saying that I can never preach too
[1:12:19] long on this that you and I need to get
[1:12:23] in the spirit and pray for the
[1:12:24] revelation of God for thus saith the
[1:12:26] Lord and then God will start doing
[1:12:28] things now aren't you glad for the
[1:12:30] things he has done I'm not taking away
[1:12:33] from what he's done the past but we're
[1:12:34] all looking what's he gonna do in 2018
[1:12:36] right if he tarries what's gonna do this
[1:12:38] year we're thankful what he did last
[1:12:41] year what is the next year hold we're
[1:12:43] all looking toward that and the way we
[1:12:45] prepare for is to clean out our lives
[1:12:47] getting the perfect will of God get in
[1:12:50] the spirit then things will begin to
[1:12:51] happen
[1:12:52] I'll some roast even last night I said
[1:12:54] this last year has been a very difficult
[1:12:55] year and there's different things that
[1:12:57] have happened that really discouraged me
[1:12:59] in different things I don't understand
[1:13:00] I said this last year God has really
[1:13:02] raised up my children to really be a
[1:13:05] strength and encouragement for me so in
[1:13:07] the midst of the trial the midst of the
[1:13:09] storm there's always light in the midst
[1:13:12] of the cloud I think there's a scripture
[1:13:13] in Psalms about that
[1:13:14] there's always light in there God God
[1:13:17] always puts a little blessing in there
[1:13:19] if you're willing to go through the
[1:13:20] storm so we must get in the spirit
[1:13:24] prayer is the first step to getting in
[1:13:27] the spirit now I have three examples of
[1:13:29] this I preached them over
[1:13:31] you know I preached them a couple times
[1:13:32] I think but let's go through let's go to
[1:13:34] Joshua 6 verse 1 the first example of
[1:13:39] this prayer before the word the prayer
[1:13:41] has to come before the word is even
[1:13:43] preached that's why you should pray
[1:13:46] before you even read your chapter in the
[1:13:47] morning or chapter night we should pray
[1:13:49] before that say God opened this up if
[1:13:51] you just got a few moments God opened
[1:13:53] this up to me speak to me and church
[1:14:00] this is something I didn't get to but
[1:14:02] the Bible says there's something called
[1:14:04] the supply of the spirit he said his
[1:14:06] gift would supply the spirit for the
[1:14:09] people in other words you have a supply
[1:14:13] of the anointing on you never say amen
[1:14:16] to that
[1:14:16] you have some anointing on you but Paul
[1:14:20] says when the gifts of God in operation
[1:14:22] he said walk he said be filled with the
[1:14:24] spirit
[1:14:25] but don't be filled drunk on wine but be
[1:14:27] filled with the spirit and he's talking
[1:14:29] about not just her so he's talking about
[1:14:31] in your human mind the gifts of God will
[1:14:34] supply the amount of Holy Ghost
[1:14:36] anointing you need in your mind in your
[1:14:38] thoughts and how many know this is the
[1:14:39] greatest battle ever fall in your mind
[1:14:41] and this is the time to feel like our
[1:14:42] minds are being attacked more than ever
[1:14:44] but this is the time when we need to
[1:14:46] supply the spirit in our thinking and in
[1:14:48] our minds if we're gonna overcome if
[1:14:50] we're gonna be conquerors in this label
[1:14:52] to see an hour if we're going to get
[1:14:55] revelation if we're going to enjoy the
[1:14:56] preaching of the word if we're gonna
[1:14:58] fulfill that scripture that faith cometh
[1:15:00] by hearing the word of church don't you
[1:15:02] want to leave church and say God spoke
[1:15:04] to me today well there's the first step
[1:15:06] you got to do is pray in the spirit
[1:15:08] that's the first step Robert says it you
[1:15:11] must pray in the spirit first before the
[1:15:14] word is even preached that's the power
[1:15:15] of prayer and that's why we got to have
[1:15:17] a praying Church the Prophet said don't
[1:15:20] want to be a praying Church that prays
[1:15:21] the blessings down and I said yes my
[1:15:23] heart my heart says yes and I'm helping
[1:15:26] God's helping me bring my whole face
[1:15:28] and I in this objection to that that
[1:15:30] that that command absolutely Joshua
[1:15:35] chapter six now these are the
[1:15:39] instructions here now Jericho was
[1:15:42] straightly shut up because of the
[1:15:43] children of Israel verse one none went
[1:15:45] out and unque min and the Lord said unto
[1:15:46] Joshua see I've given into thine hand
[1:15:48] Jericho and the king thereof and the
[1:15:50] mighty men of valor and you shall
[1:15:51] compass the city all men of all ye men
[1:15:54] of war and go round about the city once
[1:15:56] thou shalt thou do six days the seven
[1:15:59] priests shall bear before the ark seven
[1:16:01] trumpets of rams horns and the seventh
[1:16:04] day he shall compass the city seven
[1:16:05] times and the priests shall blow with
[1:16:08] the trumpets and it should come to pass
[1:16:11] that when they make a long blast with
[1:16:12] the ram's horn and when you hear the
[1:16:14] sound of the trumpet all the people
[1:16:15] shall shout with a great shout and the
[1:16:17] wall of the city shall fall down flat
[1:16:19] and the people shall send up every man
[1:16:22] straight before him so see God is
[1:16:23] prophetic God tells them what's going to
[1:16:25] happen if you obey the word the
[1:16:27] deliverance is coming that's what it is
[1:16:29] for us if we the obey this word this
[1:16:31] morning the victory is coming that's
[1:16:33] exactly right and Joshua the son of nun
[1:16:35] called the priests and send them take up
[1:16:37] the Ark of the Covenant and let seven
[1:16:39] priests bear seven trumpets of rams
[1:16:42] horns before the Lord so see that the
[1:16:44] priests with the music went before the
[1:16:46] word how many understand that verse
[1:16:48] seven they said unto the people pass on
[1:16:50] and compass the city and let him that's
[1:16:52] armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord
[1:16:56] so we have armed soldiers with weapons
[1:16:59] plus priests with trumpets that go
[1:17:01] before the Ark I preach us when I
[1:17:04] preached on the the full armor of God if
[1:17:07] you remember verse eight and it came to
[1:17:08] pass when Josh had spoken on the people
[1:17:10] that the seven priests bearing the seven
[1:17:12] trumpets of rams horns passed on before
[1:17:15] the Lord and blue with the trumpets and
[1:17:18] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[1:17:19] follow them now verse nine is this is
[1:17:21] the point I want to make and the armed
[1:17:23] men went before the priests that blue
[1:17:26] with the trumpets and the reward came
[1:17:31] after the Ark the priests going on and
[1:17:33] the blowing of the trumpet so you have
[1:17:35] armed priests with swords first then you
[1:17:38] have priests with horns with trumpets
[1:17:42] then you have the ark then you have more
[1:17:44] priests with horns because you have a
[1:17:47] rear award yeah so the word is right in
[1:17:49] the middle but you've got soldiers
[1:17:51] fighting before that you've got singing
[1:17:53] going before the word then you've got
[1:17:55] the word then you've got singing after
[1:17:57] the word sounds like a good Holy Ghost
[1:17:59] service to me Church right this is the
[1:18:03] pattern was he so often we forget that
[1:18:06] the armed men were before the songs and
[1:18:08] the armed men we know represent those
[1:18:11] who had the full armor of God and I go
[1:18:14] to Ephesians 6 just quickly remember
[1:18:17] that we don't want to forget that Church
[1:18:18] I'm trying to stir up your minds by way
[1:18:20] of remembrance if we want revelation our
[1:18:22] church my God spoke to us at church
[1:18:24] today we've got to get in the spirit
[1:18:26] first vision 6 there's no other way and
[1:18:32] there's and if you really think about it
[1:18:35] no wonder the prophets said we must pray
[1:18:37] for revelation more than anything else
[1:18:38] what do you and I need more than a
[1:18:40] personal thus saith the Lord that's all
[1:18:44] we need like that's all I need I just
[1:18:46] needed a thus saith the Lord that I'm
[1:18:47] supposed to be an Akron I can be happy
[1:18:49] am I gonna struggle time sure am I gonna
[1:18:51] here have mine battles of course but
[1:18:53] once God gives me a sign or thus saith
[1:18:55] the Lord that I can let my life just
[1:18:57] fall into line with whatever he allows
[1:18:59] amen and just trust his word because I'm
[1:19:03] not basing upon my thoughts but I'm
[1:19:05] basing up on what he's revealed to me
[1:19:07] for me in His Holy Word amen on the
[1:19:11] state the Lord feeding 6 now remember we
[1:19:15] have to go through all these but we're
[1:19:16] not wrestling against flesh and blood
[1:19:18] not wrestling against the people here at
[1:19:20] the church you know make believers here
[1:19:22] in our church or because you have you
[1:19:23] have three kinds every Church I'm not
[1:19:25] wrestling against that I'm not wrestling
[1:19:26] against you know anyone that speaks bad
[1:19:29] about me I'm not wrestling against that
[1:19:30] it's the spiritual wickedness behind it
[1:19:32] but remember I'm all these
[1:19:34] principalities powers all these things
[1:19:36] will not prevail against you and I Amen
[1:19:39] it's impossible the gates and councils
[1:19:41] the principalities hell should not
[1:19:43] prevail against you and I Amen but we
[1:19:46] will prevail over satan's attempts to
[1:19:48] thwart out our lives and to discourage
[1:19:51] us and to steal from us and to kill us
[1:19:53] we overcome by the revelation of God
[1:19:55] and hallelujah and we will stand like he

[1:20:36] shield of Revelation that's what
[1:20:39] protects me the revelation of the hour
[1:20:41] that protects me against all the fiery
[1:20:44] darts of Satan's lies what about this
[1:20:47] and what about brother Bram said this
[1:20:48] and what about Jesus didn't exist all
[1:20:50] these things my revelation of him
[1:20:52] extinguishes all those darts they just
[1:20:55] fizzle out they just fall right before
[1:20:57] me I don't even consider that why
[1:20:59] because the father showed me he's alive
[1:21:01] the father showed me he's the Messiah
[1:21:03] the father showed me he's the son of man
[1:21:04] for this hour the father showed me that

[1:21:39] lord help me be a prayer warrior that's
[1:21:42] what I want to be a prayer warrior
[1:21:43] praying with all prayer let's see all
[1:21:46] kinds of prayers whether it's just
[1:21:47] blessing the Lord whether it's
[1:21:49] supplications which are special requests
[1:21:51] no matter what kind of prayer it is we
[1:21:54] pray always with all prayers
[1:21:57] supplication the spirit and watching
[1:21:58] thereunto with all perseverance and
[1:22:00] supplication for All Saints that's why
[1:22:03] we pray for the family in Ghana right
[1:22:05] pray for All Saints okay
[1:22:09] that's the first example the Prophet
[1:22:11] said if you want revelation he said pray
[1:22:12] first that's the first example prayer
[1:22:15] warriors full armors of God they go
[1:22:18] first before the word even comes can
[1:22:20] anybody see that okay second one now
[1:22:22] hope I got a whole
[1:22:23] I got a whole sermon on this one but
[1:22:26] I've got to be mindful forgive me I got
[1:22:28] to be mindful the time here I'd I might
[1:22:30] just preach that was separate but let me
[1:22:33] just go to this one let's go to Exodus
[1:22:36] please Exodus I believe it's 25 I'm
[1:22:39] scrolling here cuz I got a skip I feel
[1:22:41] like I got a skip a little bit that's
[1:22:42] access 27 forgive me forgive me and this
[1:22:46] is beautiful because this one ties it
[1:22:47] with Hannah this is beautiful oh you got
[1:22:49] I hope you enjoyed this this really
[1:22:51] blessed my heart yesterday it just kind
[1:22:53] of the thought just came mine that's
[1:22:54] just like Hannah X is 27 20 so see
[1:23:01] prayer always comes before thus saith
[1:23:03] the Lord prayer you've got to get in the
[1:23:05] spirit
[1:23:06] or else God's Word is going to take any
[1:23:07] effect XS 27 20 and thou shall command
[1:23:14] the children Israel that they bring thee
[1:23:17] pure olive oil beaten for light to cause
[1:23:23] the lamp to burn always in the
[1:23:26] tabernacle of the congregation without
[1:23:28] the veil which is before the testimony
[1:23:29] Aaron and son shall order from evening
[1:23:31] the morning before the Lord it should be
[1:23:33] a statute forever unto their generations
[1:23:35] on behalf of the children of Israel now
[1:23:38] remember in the holy place there was
[1:23:39] three things there was altar of incense
[1:23:41] the shewbread and the lamp stand so the
[1:23:46] priests couldn't do their work they
[1:23:47] couldn't serve God in the holy place and
[1:23:50] they couldn't go in the Holies of Holies
[1:23:52] without the oil that the people brought
[1:23:54] and oil represents the properties
[1:23:58] cameras preacher a few weeks ago we know
[1:23:59] it oil represents the baptism of the
[1:24:01] Holy Ghost so the people have to bring
[1:24:04] their token the people have to bring
[1:24:08] eternal life with them the people have
[1:24:10] to bring the Holy Spirit with them
[1:24:13] if the people bring the holy spirit then
[1:24:15] the priest can order the service the
[1:24:17] right way but the people all of us
[1:24:20] including me my wife my family we've all
[1:24:22] got to bring oil to the house of God and
[1:24:25] notice it was pure like our heart should
[1:24:29] be pure before God in other words you
[1:24:33] got to filter out that oil hot in India
[1:24:36] and gods word is always his filter amen
[1:24:39] God's Word is the thinking man's filter
[1:24:42] so before you come to church before you
[1:24:44] come to see God move our all of our all
[1:24:46] of our lives must be filtered through
[1:24:48] the Word of God pure word pure lives
[1:24:51] perfect will of God or else there's
[1:24:53] gonna be no light in this holy place you
[1:24:57] understand and it had to be beaten there
[1:25:01] to take those olives and they had to
[1:25:04] beat it some of them you know just if
[1:25:06] everybody brought a little bit they'd
[1:25:07] have little bowls there they just beat
[1:25:08] it they just beat it and smash it and
[1:25:11] smash it down until all the oil came out
[1:25:13] it had to be beaten and this was very
[1:25:16] expensive oil according to this
[1:25:17] historian matthew henry said that this
[1:25:19] was the very expensive oil pure oil was
[1:25:22] the most expensive so it's going to take
[1:25:25] the biggest sacrifice for you to have a
[1:25:26] pure life right for your oil is shine
[1:25:29] it's going to take the biggest sacrifice
[1:25:31] it's gonna be the most expensive thing
[1:25:33] it has to be the most important thing
[1:25:34] for you and I to bring pure oil before
[1:25:36] God and it had to be beaten pounded
[1:25:40] pounded pounded pounded there and I'll
[1:25:43] say like this your life has to be pound
[1:25:45] you got to pound out the sin out of our
[1:25:47] lives
[1:25:47] glory day after day pound out say God
[1:25:52] take this from me God deliver me God
[1:25:53] purify my heart take this temptation
[1:25:55] away it's got to be beaten and pounded
[1:25:57] lord help me to endure this temptation
[1:25:59] help me to go through help me not to
[1:26:01] give up give me strength as you pound
[1:26:04] out my life let me manifest your love
[1:26:06] amen let me bring up your heart to the
[1:26:08] house of God and then the ministers can
[1:26:12] work with the light because the oil has
[1:26:15] been brought by the people Oh hallelujah
[1:26:19] glory so it's got to be the burden of
[1:26:26] the people too
[1:26:27] the Holy Spirit beat out grind out the
[1:26:29] the trials of your life so you can bring
[1:26:31] forth a pure life to the house of God
[1:26:34] that's the second one the third one this
[1:26:36] is the one I have about four pages of
[1:26:38] quotes on so I'm not gonna be able to
[1:26:39] preach this and I'm at the pre just on
[1:26:41] another time and a separate sermon but
[1:26:43] go to Matthew here 21 Matthew 21 7 now
[1:26:59] given you two witnesses that the prayer
[1:27:01] and the Holy Ghost prayer always comes
[1:27:03] before the word okay before they could
[1:27:07] get the holiest of Holies the people had
[1:27:08] to be praying bring an oil before Joshua
[1:27:11] brought the word the armed man with with
[1:27:15] with swords of faith right I'm sorry
[1:27:17] swords of the word and shields of faith
[1:27:18] they had to come before the singers and
[1:27:20] before the Word of God and now Matthew
[1:27:25] 21 7 how many want to see prophecy
[1:27:35] fulfilled in our day I don't want to see
[1:27:36] that how many want to be a part of the
[1:27:39] good prophecy I do too
[1:27:42] Matthew 21 7 this scripture is all about
[1:27:44] prophecy being fulfilled in their day
[1:27:48] let's see the people let's see what the
[1:27:50] people were doing who were part of the
[1:27:52] good part of the prophecy there were
[1:27:55] people that didn't like this and they
[1:27:56] were the bad part of the prophecy but
[1:27:58] there's people that were the good part
[1:27:59] of the prophecy amen and brought the ass
[1:28:04] and the cult and put on them their
[1:28:06] clothes and they set him thereon and a
[1:28:09] very great multitude spread their
[1:28:10] garments in the way others cut down
[1:28:12] branches from the trees and strawed them
[1:28:15] in the way and this is of course Jesus
[1:28:18] coming in on Good Friday
[1:28:20] I'm sorry not Good Friday Palm Sunday
[1:28:22] and the multitudes that went before that
[1:28:25] followed cried saying Hosanna to the son
[1:28:28] of David blessed is he that cometh the
[1:28:31] name of Lord hosanna in the highest does
[1:28:33] everybody see that
[1:28:33] here's the word riding a beast right
[1:28:36] riding a power into the city that's
[1:28:39] going to ultimately reject him
[1:28:40] but you had singers before and singers
[1:28:43] after just like Joshua Amen singers
[1:28:47] before the word singers after the word
[1:28:50] but before even the singers what were
[1:28:52] the people doing they were throwing
[1:28:54] their palms down to the ground they were
[1:28:57] throwing their clothes down to the
[1:28:58] ground all that I have all my all my
[1:29:00] ability all my covering I throw it down
[1:29:03] everything that's clothing me or these
[1:29:05] things of course there they had other
[1:29:06] clothes but they were throwing their
[1:29:07] their garments my garments are not
[1:29:09] worthy my my palms are not worthy and
[1:29:13] all this had to happen before the
[1:29:15] singing and before the word came palms
[1:29:18] had to hit the ground in church if we
[1:29:19] could have some palms hit this altar if
[1:29:21] we could have palms hits the ground in
[1:29:23] your prayer closet then we'll see the
[1:29:25] word come and we'll see the word
[1:29:27] fulfilled the prophecy fulfilled in this
[1:29:29] our glory palms fell first and if we
[1:29:33] could put our faces falling down to the
[1:29:35] ground and pray and seek God then we'll
[1:29:37] see God's work fulfilled in our lives
[1:29:39] it's the pattern I just given you three
[1:29:42] examples and I that's all the time I had
[1:29:44] to study was those three and I could go
[1:29:45] down through the quotes I'm not going to
[1:29:47] today because of communion what was the
[1:29:51] attraction on the mountain the Prophet
[1:29:52] said God fulfilling his word glory and
[1:29:56] so the palms had to fall the clothes had
[1:29:59] to fall all of our works had to go we
[1:30:01] had to sacrifice everything then the
[1:30:04] praise has come then the word comes then
[1:30:06] more praise has come that sounds like I
[1:30:08] said a good Holy Ghost service amen
[1:30:10] hallelujah the praise is we want to sing
[1:30:12] praises he deserves to be praised today
[1:30:17] they came with palms of trees and we
[1:30:21] come with palms a praise hands praising
[1:30:24] him faces down worshiping the Lord
[1:30:27] there's a special connection the Jews at
[1:30:30] the first coming had palms that they
[1:30:32] threw down but the Gentiles brother Bram
[1:30:36] says after the rapture the Gentiles in
[1:30:38] Revelation 7 the Bible said our waving
[1:30:41] palms in heaven because the king has
[1:30:44] come to the Gentiles when the King first
[1:30:47] came to the Jews they threw down their
[1:30:48] palms they rejected him but at the
[1:30:51] rapture Jesus catches his bride away and
[1:30:54] they rejoice with palms because they
[1:30:57] receive the Messiah
[1:30:58] hey man beautiful I thought I was
[1:31:01] powerful the Gentiles show the palms
[1:31:04] after a second coming
[1:31:05] hallelujah they received him the Jews
[1:31:08] rejected him but both times God was
[1:31:12] going to bring forth palms of praise
[1:31:13] palms of worship sacrifices of praise
[1:31:16] and number all the preachers got upset
[1:31:19] they said tell these children the
[1:31:21] children were running around the temple
[1:31:22] saying Jesus is Messiah Hosanna
[1:31:25] the king of David's come the children
[1:31:27] were worshipping God that's what we need
[1:31:29] we need children that are filled with
[1:31:30] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:31:31] we need adult says that her Philip the
[1:31:33] Holy Ghost run around singing to save us
[1:31:35] that's what Hosanna means save us
[1:31:37] deliver us minister to us and that's
[1:31:41] exactly what Jesus did on that day amen
[1:31:43] Jesus came and saved them the next week
[1:31:45] on the cross hallelujah on Gau gothis
[1:31:48] hill they said save us and Jesus said I
[1:31:50] will praise God then they rejected him
[1:31:54] but he went to a people that didn't know
[1:31:56] he was coming the Gentiles and they'll
[1:31:58] sing with palms as well they'll say
[1:32:00] Hosanna hallelujah
[1:32:02] blessed is he that came in the name of
[1:32:04] the Lord exactly right that's beautiful
[1:32:09] I don't know if you ever saw this but
[1:32:12] Hosanna was actually from the Book of
[1:32:14] Psalms do you ever know that Psalms 118
[1:32:18] let's read a I think you might be
[1:32:18] blessed by that so I was one 1825
[1:32:22] Hosanna means save now right now see
[1:32:28] something urgent Hosanna something
[1:32:29] urgent save us right now
[1:32:33] in other words he says save we beseech
[1:32:37] you we plead with you we beg you and
[1:32:40] jesus said these are the cheerin he said
[1:32:43] I can't shut up these children if the
[1:32:44] children are shut up the rocks will cry
[1:32:46] out that means all of heaven was wanting
[1:32:49] to be saved amen all of heaven was
[1:32:51] wanting to be redeemed amen save us if
[1:32:54] the children would not a shot of that
[1:32:55] the rocks would have cried out said save
[1:32:58] us we beseech thee plead with us God let
[1:33:00] your blood be shed for our sins because
[1:33:03] we're desperately wicked sinners we need
[1:33:05] new hearts we need a news
[1:33:07] spirit and we need your spirit oh the
[1:33:11] rocks would have cried out because the
[1:33:13] tremble when Jesus died amen and
[1:33:15] the creatures of God are groaning now
[1:33:18] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:33:20] ha ha

[1:33:55] prosperity of God I'm not talking about
[1:33:57] prosperity preaching even if I get poor
[1:34:00] financially I can still get richer
[1:34:02] spiritually there are seasons of our
[1:34:05] lives or seasons brother Bram's life we
[1:34:07] had more money more support and a
[1:34:09] dwindled toward the end it looked like
[1:34:10] he was defeated but he was a victor in
[1:34:12] Christ he was an overcomer because he
[1:34:14] stayed true to the Word of God same
[1:34:17] thing we must be but look what he's
[1:34:18] saying he says it twice that's where
[1:34:19] they were shouting Hosanna save us son
[1:34:21] of David save us save us that was God
[1:34:24] fulfilling prophecy God wanted people
[1:34:27] shouting save me save me save me
[1:34:30] and so God anointed some children and
[1:34:32] some adults to throw down their palms
[1:34:34] and say save us save us and only elect
[1:34:37] caught the revelation of that hour that
[1:34:40] this is the son of David amen this is
[1:34:42] the Messiah and he's coming to be a lamb
[1:34:44] he's coming to be sacrificed that you
[1:34:46] and I might be saved
[1:34:48] hey man glory Jesus love that God loved
[1:34:53] that Jesus I'm not gonna make them shut
[1:34:55] up let them shout save me let them cry
[1:34:57] out to me that's what babies do when
[1:34:58] they need something they cry out amen
[1:35:00] and this is where it came from this is
[1:35:03] the scripture save us now if you look at
[1:35:06] the Greek or the Hebrew words you can
[1:35:07] put them together and it says Hosanna
[1:35:09] now it sounds different in Hebrew but I
[1:35:11] put them together it's like host Shawn
[1:35:13] na or something like that if you put
[1:35:14] those two words this is Hosanna save us
[1:35:17] Jesus save us Jesus how many would say
[1:35:19] Hosanna today amen
[1:35:21] I say that they save us from Laodicea
[1:35:22] save us come quickly Lord Jesus amen so
[1:35:28] see that the branches were done first
[1:35:31] the clothes were laid first the
[1:35:33] sacrifice went first
[1:35:35] then came the singers then came the word
[1:35:38] then came more singing can every see how
[1:35:41] it's the perfect perfectly scriptural
[1:35:45] all right now let me finish here I think
[1:35:50] I just maybe yeah I'll just have to do
[1:35:51] this so now we have three clear examples
[1:35:54] from the Word of God let's go to First
[1:35:58] Samuel chapter one now my clock I got
[1:36:01] five minutes
[1:36:02] I just wish you had more time I don't
[1:36:07] want to go too long like I said I know I
[1:36:09] know there's things to do first say I'm
[1:36:11] a chapter one
[1:36:24] now for this church you've got to read
[1:36:27] read between the lines a little bit if
[1:36:30] you read between the lines you'll see
[1:36:32] exactly and I'm gonna read a quote after
[1:36:33] this so read the scripture first and
[1:36:35] read the quote and watch and see what
[1:36:38] the what the prophet of God pulls out by
[1:36:39] the Holy Spirit from this sermon called
[1:36:42] faith cometh by hearing 1954 I really
[1:36:45] want to go through I just listened to I
[1:36:46] just read the first maybe twenty minutes
[1:36:49] of this I didn't even check the time but
[1:36:51] I'm gonna go through all the examples he
[1:36:52] gives in here because he gives a
[1:36:53] beautiful example of Abraham Sarah and
[1:36:55] Hannah as faith comes by hearing hearing
[1:36:59] by the Word of God
[1:37:01] so revelation comes by hearing the
[1:37:03] preaching but not after you pray in the
[1:37:06] spirit first you have to get in the
[1:37:07] spirit first praise God then comes the
[1:37:10] word then comes us to the Lord then you
[1:37:13] thank God for the word that you heard
[1:37:14] afterwards and you worship and thank him
[1:37:17] so first name in Chapter 1 now we know
[1:37:20] the scripture we know Elkanah had two
[1:37:23] wives in verses 1 and 2 she had no
[1:37:25] children it's interesting in verse 3 God
[1:37:27] shut up her womb I'm sure that was verse
[1:37:30] 5 God did it God allowed her to be
[1:37:33] barren so she could manifest this
[1:37:36] attribute of God the attribute of
[1:37:38] hearing the word and believing Oh Jess
[1:37:42] why is my life like this brother Jesse
[1:37:44] you know why is well God did it so you
[1:37:46] could manifest a specific attribute of
[1:37:49] God to glorify God can you imagine and
[1:37:55] the Bible never said no the Bible said
[1:37:57] God shut it up it wasn't like you know
[1:37:59] Hannah was bad as a girl you know you're
[1:38:01] not going to have children
[1:38:02] it wasn't like that it was God that did
[1:38:04] it God knew what was in Hannah's life
[1:38:07] God knew Hannah's desires and see your
[1:38:09] trials bring out your desires glory your
[1:38:14] trial will show when you get down that
[1:38:15] trial you'll find out what you really
[1:38:17] desire in life that's why I'm people go
[1:38:20] through trials and they pull away from
[1:38:21] God and pull away from the message and
[1:38:22] bow away from the word it shows their
[1:38:24] desires were wrong in the first place
[1:38:27] but God allows to try on your life to
[1:38:30] manifest either what manifests what's in
[1:38:32] there whether it's the seat of God or
[1:38:35] whether it's not your try
[1:38:38] will show your desires remember they
[1:38:46] went up yearly to sacrifice look at
[1:38:49] verse 5 but unto Hannah he gave a worthy
[1:38:51] portion that's talking about Elkanah for
[1:38:53] he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up
[1:38:54] her womb and I like that one thing about
[1:38:58] Hannah although her husband loved her
[1:39:00] the most that wasn't the greatest desire
[1:39:02] of her heart she wanted to be loved by
[1:39:03] God most like we can't we should be
[1:39:06] happy if people love us you know we
[1:39:08] should be happy but really we shouldn't
[1:39:10] want things from God more we should want
[1:39:12] God's love and God's will more than we
[1:39:14] want human attention human affection she
[1:39:19] could not say well God you didn't give
[1:39:21] me a husband that loved me she couldn't
[1:39:23] say that her husband loved her more than
[1:39:25] her his other heart wife but see that
[1:39:28] was enough for her she wanted God's will
[1:39:31] for her life more than everything that's
[1:39:34] what you and I need to remember above
[1:39:36] all things we want God's will we want
[1:39:38] God's will to be done more than
[1:39:40] everything else now look at that not
[1:39:45] here's here's the part verse 6 and her
[1:39:46] adversary also provoked her sore for to
[1:39:49] make her fret because the Lord had shut
[1:39:51] up her womb oh you're just some barren
[1:39:54] woman God doesn't love you you're no
[1:39:57] good what kind of wife are you yeah okay
[1:39:59] I loves you more than me but I born him
[1:40:01] children you haven't done nothing for
[1:40:03] the kingdom of God you haven't brought
[1:40:04] forth any children for the kingdom of
[1:40:06] God and this vector what was the church
[1:40:09] it was the beating of the oil day after
[1:40:12] day after day this other wife would beat
[1:40:15] down and what did it produce and produce
[1:40:17] a pure godly desire going up to the
[1:40:19] house of God in a man beating after
[1:40:23] beating after beating after beating
[1:40:26] after day after day all the pressure oh
[1:40:29] your failure you never do anything for
[1:40:32] God you can never produce an offspring
[1:40:34] you can never produce the son hallelujah
[1:40:36] and that's what Satan tells us but we
[1:40:38] are producing the son amen Christ no
[1:40:42] matter how much pounding we got to bring
[1:40:44] forth these trials are gonna show that
[1:40:46] we want to bring forth the Son of God
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:49] there is in Christ in our lives
[1:40:51] hallelujah
[1:40:52] it's got to be beaten oil it's got to be
[1:40:55] pure it's got to be pure holy ghost oil
[1:40:58] pure holy ghost word of god desire you
[1:41:01] understand I'm just throwing words in
[1:41:03] there that's what it is it's the perfect
[1:41:06] will of God we desire God's will
[1:41:09] year by year verse seven they did this
[1:41:11] every year and so she provoked her and
[1:41:14] verse seven therefore she wept and did
[1:41:16] not eat so now it comes down to fasting
[1:41:18] time
[1:41:20] I'm so hungry for God's will that I'm
[1:41:23] not gonna eat anything because I'm
[1:41:24] hungrier for the Word of God o God help
[1:41:27] us to be there I'm more hungry to hear
[1:41:29] God's Word then eat natural food and
[1:41:32] there's my time so give me a couple more
[1:41:34] minutes I'll set five minutes more now
[1:41:41] look at verse nine so Hannah rose up
[1:41:42] after they had eaten in Shiloh and after
[1:41:44] they had drunk naughty lie the priests
[1:41:46] at upon a seat by the post of the temple
[1:41:47] of the Lord now look she gets to watch
[1:41:50] her whole family she gets to watch her
[1:41:51] adversary eat there and like the Bible
[1:41:54] said you'll set the table before in the
[1:41:56] presence of your enemies look at that my
[1:41:58] goodness it just struck me right there
[1:42:00] she's watching all them eat and she's
[1:42:02] just eating on the Word of God I know
[1:42:04] God's gonna answer me I'm going to the
[1:42:05] house of God expecting I've got a pure
[1:42:07] heart hallelujah I'm seeking God I need
[1:42:11] the Word of God so she was feasting on
[1:42:12] the word in the presence of her enemies
[1:42:15] of our enemies were eating the food I've
[1:42:19] had that before I fasted where there
[1:42:21] were some of the best foods out in front
[1:42:22] of me I wasn't even hungry for them I
[1:42:23] mean they smell good but I was more
[1:42:25] hungry to do God's will and I'm talking
[1:42:28] good Mexican food I was talking about
[1:42:30] and I'm Mexican half of at least and
[1:42:33] when you're under the anointing of God
[1:42:35] and you've been beaten down all those
[1:42:37] times and you really want the will of
[1:42:38] God there's no temptation Satan can lay
[1:42:40] before you that won't be easy to turn
[1:42:43] down because you're walking in the
[1:42:44] spirit you're not walking the flesh now
[1:42:50] look at verse 10 and she was in
[1:42:52] bitterness of the soul and praying to
[1:42:53] the Lord and wept sore see that's how
[1:42:55] bad she wanted this desire God did this
[1:42:57] to her to bring out what was really on
[1:42:59] the inside and she vowed to violence and
[1:43:02] O Lord of Hosts if I would indeed look
[1:43:04] upon the affliction my handmaiden
[1:43:05] me and not forget nine handmade but will
[1:43:08] give unto me thine handmaid a man-child
[1:43:10] then I will give him unto the Lord all
[1:43:12] the days of his life and there shall no
[1:43:13] razor come upon his head and it came to
[1:43:18] pass her she continued praying over the
[1:43:19] Lord that Eli marked her mouth now
[1:43:21] Hannah she spake in her heart only her
[1:43:23] lips moved but her voice was not heard
[1:43:25] therefore Eli thought she had been
[1:43:27] drunken cuz he was so drunk of the Holy
[1:43:30] Ghost right this is where we get it
[1:43:31] right here she was so praying so
[1:43:34] desperate so sincere fast and she looked
[1:43:36] she looked drunk and that's what they
[1:43:38] had the day of Pentecost new wine Amen I
[1:43:40] don't know yeah because they're in
[1:43:41] prayer but prayer came first before the
[1:43:44] word we can never overemphasize the
[1:43:48] importance of revelation it comes by
[1:43:51] praying first I love what he says here
[1:43:57] Eli said there how wilt thou be drunken
[1:44:00] put away that wine from these that shows
[1:44:02] how he was back slidden he wasn't here
[1:44:03] under the anointing he couldn't catch
[1:44:05] that she was under the anointing you're
[1:44:07] just drunk and she could have said
[1:44:09] you're right I am drunk on the Holy
[1:44:10] Ghost I'm so filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:13] right now I brought pure oil to the
[1:44:15] house of God and Hannah said an answer
[1:44:19] said oh no my lord I'm a woman of a
[1:44:22] sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither
[1:44:24] wine nor strong drink but I poured out
[1:44:26] my soul before the Lord count not thine
[1:44:31] handmaid for a daughter of Belial for
[1:44:33] out of abundance of my complaint in
[1:44:35] grief have I spoken there too then I
[1:44:37] answered and said go in peace and the
[1:44:38] God of Israel grant thee thy petition
[1:44:40] that thou has asked of him and she said
[1:44:43] let thine handmaid find grace in thy
[1:44:45] sight and the woman went her way and did
[1:44:47] eat and her countenance was no more sad
[1:44:49] so what changed her the word of the
[1:44:52] priest in the temple was what changed
[1:44:55] her but God had to bring her through
[1:44:57] prayer through poundings through
[1:45:01] beatings God had to bring her through
[1:45:02] years and years of disappointment at the
[1:45:04] house of God beating after biddy and she
[1:45:09] finally receives the revelation for her
[1:45:11] life she finally receives the Word of
[1:45:13] God for life after years of being beaten
[1:45:16] down she hears it through the priest
[1:45:18] in the temple so the revelation doesn't
[1:45:21] come until the prayer has gone the
[1:45:24] praises have gone and then the Word of
[1:45:26] God came us and our feet the next verse
[1:45:34] I'm skipping down a little bit but it
[1:45:35] says they return and eat Elkanah knew
[1:45:38] his wife port the son that got allowed
[1:45:55] this to come to pass their life to
[1:45:57] produce a desperation to show all of us
[1:46:00] what desperation in prayer really
[1:46:03] produces what years of trials I love

[1:46:59] God there's like just prophesies
[1:47:01] circling he's ever anybody ever feel
[1:47:03] like that like something do you feel

[1:47:08] to move there's just something about my
[1:47:09] life I'm not here for no purpose I'm
[1:47:14] here to fulfill God's prophecy I don't
[1:47:18] always know what it's about I believe
[1:47:19] it's tied to the rapture though I
[1:47:21] believe that because of all the prophets
[1:47:22] taught us and if I don't go in the
[1:47:26] rapture and I got to go to the grave
[1:47:27] first and then I go in the rapture it
[1:47:29] doesn't matter but I feel like there's
[1:47:30] just prophecy surrounding
[1:47:32] Scot is gonna move there is more to come
[1:47:34] there's something I must do but I must
[1:47:36] go through year after year after the
[1:47:38] beating the pounding and one of these
[1:47:41] old days you and I are gonna get in the
[1:47:43] spirit and God is gonna bring his word
[1:47:45] to pass in our lives not just a maybe a
[1:47:49] hope it's a dust sayeth the Lord
[1:47:52] how's it gonna happen first you got to
[1:47:55] pray got a beat in pure oil gonna have a
[1:47:57] pure life beaten down through years of
[1:48:00] trials years molded shame then she
[1:48:03] brought this oil to the house of God she
[1:48:04] brought this desire this Holy Ghost full
[1:48:06] desire pray got in the spirit of prayer
[1:48:09] she hears the Word of God and brother
[1:48:13] Branham said faith came by hearing
[1:48:15] hearing by the Word of God the Librium
[1:48:21] said as she was praying eli stomped out
[1:48:23] and said woman will you always be drunk
[1:48:26] on strong drink and she said my lord I'm
[1:48:27] not drunk on strong drink but I'm
[1:48:29] praying that the Lord take away my
[1:48:30] reproach and he said the Lord grant it
[1:48:33] to you he said the Lord bless thee and
[1:48:35] that's all she wanted to know there was
[1:48:39] God's priests God priests had pronounced
[1:48:41] the blessing on her and she was at the
[1:48:43] house of God amen
[1:48:46] thank you Jesus amen he said God put
[1:48:52] could have put a baby right in her arms
[1:48:53] if he wanted to but he has a way of
[1:48:56] doing things it don't make any
[1:48:57] difference whether it happened there or
[1:48:59] not she had God's word so sunk in her
[1:49:02] heart that faith came by hearing hearing
[1:49:04] by the Word of God she accepted it right
[1:49:06] then and went home or joy seing how we
[1:49:09] ought to do that too if something that
[1:49:11] struck our heart we ought to go home
[1:49:12] rejoicing and say hallelujah God's Word
[1:49:15] spoke to me at the house of God I've
[1:49:17] received what I've asked for amen praise
[1:49:21] God they're gonna have the baby nine
[1:49:22] months later little Samuels born why
[1:49:24] because she took God at his words she
[1:49:26] believed faith comes by hearing hearing

[1:51:40] and divide it among yourselves for I
[1:51:42] saying you I will not drink of the fruit
[1:51:43] of the vine until the kingdom of God
[1:51:45] shall come and he took the bread and
[1:51:49] gave thanks and brake it and gave unto
[1:51:51] them saying this is my body which is
[1:51:52] given for you this too and remember to
[1:51:54] me likewise also the cup after supper

[1:52:04] with me on the table and truly the Son
[1:52:06] of Man goeth as it was determined but
[1:52:09] woe unto that man by whom he has
[1:52:11] betrayed and they began to enquire among
[1:52:13] themselves which of them it was that
[1:52:15] should do this thing let's bow our heads
[1:52:17] in word of Prayer here now let's just
[1:52:18] examine ourselves just for a moment but
[1:52:20] Loras if you could come to the piano and
[1:52:23] just play that song sister when he's
[1:52:24] saying search me O God and know my heart
[1:52:26] today try me o Savior you know one thing
[1:52:34] we know about this portion Judas really
[1:52:36] didn't stop to examine his life church
[1:52:38] but the rest of the eleven did if we'll
[1:52:40] examine our lives today we know we can
[1:52:43] be pure before him we've got to examine
[1:52:45] and say am i bringing forth purity to
[1:52:49] the house of God am i taking this
[1:52:51] communion in purity but in your Lord's
[1:53:08] flowing the faith just felt such a
[1:53:10] freedom to preach it wasn't hard at all
[1:53:12] thank you for the faith that you give
[1:53:15] your people work out faith comes by
[1:53:17] hearing you've heard the word this
[1:53:19] morning I've received it this morning
[1:53:24] I'm falling under the prophecy of this I
[1:53:30] don't know when like Hannah
[1:53:32] I don't know when Lord I believe if you
[1:53:35] do a quick mighty work as your prophet
[1:53:37] said we don't know how many years it'll
[1:53:43] be we don't know how long nor one thing
[1:53:46] we're interested in is your revelation
[1:53:48] shaping our lives

[1:53:55] testimony she wanted to bring forth the
[1:54:00] son who would be a priest who would
[1:54:03] always be a church or that's our desire
[1:54:06] that we could bring forth a life of
[1:54:09] Christ that will always keep us in
[1:54:11] church keeping us in the house of God
[1:54:13] keeping us in the love of God bringing
[1:54:15] more Souls to the house of God finishing
