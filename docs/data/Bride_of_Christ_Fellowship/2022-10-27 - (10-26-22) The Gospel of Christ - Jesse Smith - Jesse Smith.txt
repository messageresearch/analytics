kind of we can line them all up [Laughter] it was beautiful just just absolutely beautiful just uh just stunning you know we're just so thankful Hallelujah all we can say is thank you Jesus praise God Hallelujah so thank the Lord listen to both sermons there from Brother cam so it was a wonderful wonderful weekend of services praise God and I was so blessed to hear that and my favorite thought of all the thoughts and the messages from the Holy Spirit was the one about uh John in the bosom of Jesus and how that was a fulfillment of the type of Solomon set me as a seal upon thine heart I thought wow that was so beautiful so I I told Brother cam that's a beautiful I wish I would have had that back in January and I was preaching on that that was a beautiful thought and I just thoroughly enjoyed it and uh just happy to see that man so blessed and we had a great time there in Pennsylvania you know we had a marriage banquet on Saturday night God was gracious to me that night I was in the shower and I fell and hit my head on the back of the shower and had this huge bump and I had a headache you know so I was I was a little nervous about Sunday you know but I just prayed over it went to bed and woke up better and now I don't even feel it now so I just healed pretty fast but I felt like the enemy was trying to discourage me you know I I think they I think they sprayed oil on the bathroom floor if I'm not mistaken I think I think the enemy anointed somebody to spray some oil on there maybe some banana peels maybe I didn't see it or something but we just had a wonderful time you know in the morning I preached on uh the doctrine of the Saints you know uh brother Ram said thus saith the Lord Elijah shall turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic Doctrine so I looked at the basically that series on doctrine that I preached here we had a few people come up couple Brothers come up for deliverance and then the evening I preached on Mighty Men I kind of put all those sermons into one and just hit the highlights and we had a lot of people it was a four-hour service just one after another mostly sick people mostly sick people and some of it was pretty pretty humbling to see people come up for prayer um one in particular I prayed for an older sister she has Parkinson's she was she was shaking and you know they were asking for a miracle and we prayed and we just prayed for five or ten minutes and I looked at an idea and I'm crying and my sister will just see what God does and she said it's already done brother Jesse like I felt she was rebuking me you know because her such faith and so we'll see you know I've never seen a Parkinson heal but she said it's already done so in other words her her heart is in the right place and of course I preached there how you have to find the will of God first but you know we'll see what the Lord does we'll keep tabs on them but it was just a wonderful wonderful weekend so I'm glad you had a great weekend and we had a wonderful weekend as well so I just thought I'd give you a quick update on that so uh let's take a few prayer requests here tonight by God's grace oh I can't forget our visitors we have first-time visitors here tonight I'm sorry uh sorry sage and Jordan let's give them around pause praise God praise God hallelujah so we've been hearing all about you for all these uh 11 months now so it's so wonderful to meet you both by the grace Lord we've been praying for you both and uh it's so wonderful to meet you by the grace of the Lord so there they'll be with us for a week Lord willing is that right brother amen about a week so we're we're so happy or two or three yeah laughs I think I asked the sage how you like it she's like I think I want to stay here or something like that like we couldn't arrange it but

praise God since we have Jordan and Sage at such a special occasion I just thought I would preach the introduction to the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and uh try to present the gospel just as plain as I know how by the grace of God Hallelujah thank you Jesus Mark chapter 1 verses 14 and 15. we'll start here by the grace of God praise God so our context here is the Lord Jesus Christ begins preaching here after John's arrest and we just want to focus on what he says here I'll read verse 14 and then we all re all can read 15 together pardon me now after that John was put in prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God let's read 15 together one two three and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repet ye and believe the gospel amen praise God let's have a word of prayer if you ever need on your heart here during The Sermon Just acknowledge it by the raising of a hand let's pray together father God we're happy again to be in the house of the Lord It's a joy to be in your house dear God and we thank you for this red letter day Lord and we're so thankful Lord Jesus for all you've done here today amongst our church Lord God and it's here we feel your presence here tonight we thank you God for that thank you for your word thank you for your Holy Spirit Lord thank you for the songs of Zion Lord that lift our Spirits Lord God they encourage us hallelujah they get us focused Lord on the right thing Lord God they straighten us up dear God they fill us with Power Fill us with courage and strength father and we thank you for this opportunity to be here tonight Lord just help me Lord to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ and and just the most plain simple format we can Lord and may your spirit back it up we pray Lord Jesus that your spirit will speak to each and every heart and father Lord each person will know Lord God the Gospel of Jesus Christ the good news and so we give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so by God's grace we'll just do a little bible study here tonight on the Gospel of Jesus Christ just to update you know we put out a video today I put out the Nephilim video today so if you're interested in that topic I think I started a couple Sundays ago if I'm not mistaken but got that one out today by the grace of the Lord so hope that'd be a blessing here to the Saints so we want to look at this here this first verse I'm sorry this first verse I use here tonight Mark chapter 1 14 and 15. if you could pull it out there again thank you hon so John the Baptist was the Forerunner who introduced Jesus Christ and notice Jesus came preaching the gospel now the god word gospel means good news so he was preaching the Good News of the kingdom of God and the kingdom is a Dominion it's a government it's a rulership of God so he's preaching the Good News of God's government praise God and he says the time is fulfilled the kingdom of God is at hand and he says repent ye and believe the gospel Hallelujah so the first step in being a part of the Kingdom or the government of Jesus Christ is repenting of all of your sins Hallelujah and of course this is not a physical Kingdom yet and that's a big word yet hallelujah it's going to be a physical Kingdom eventually but it's not a physical Kingdom yet right now it's a spiritual Kingdom praise God where the the people of this government are ruled by the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and so Jesus comes and he says he starts preaching there's good news there's good news and he said the way to get into the kingdom of God is repent and believe the gospel praise God now I want you to go to Luke here let's this reminds me also of Luke chapter 4 18 the Lord Jesus also describes this Kingdom of Heaven in another way or the kingdom of God in another way Luke 4 18. Luke 4 18. well you're faster than I can turn there so you're going to get a raise like I told you I'm going to give you a raise Jesus is quoting Isaiah 61 verse 1 and he says the spirit Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor most people that like real Christianity are not the rich people mostly it's the poor people and he has set me to heal the brokenhearted he hath sent me to preach Deliverance to the captives in other words you don't have to be a slave to sin you don't have to be captive to an addiction or a bad habit you don't have to be addicted you can be delivered and Jesus Christ came that's the good news he will deliver you from all addictions praise God and he recovers the sight to the blind now we can read in the Bible numerous blind people that receive their sight you know I prayed for a sister or sister uh a sister in Napoleon what's her name I prayed for her she couldn't see out of one eye and I prayed for her and she got the sight back right right when I prayed for her Megan there it is Megan she's the same one that got healed of cancer she had cancer on her leg and they just kept praying and it just shrunk away and then was gone so just a real woman of Faith there and she said I couldn't see out of my eye he said she said then when you pray for me the the sight came solely back I don't know what the condition was I don't know if it's a tumor I don't know what the issue was but the fact was we prayed and the Bible said or we prayed and she got her sight back Jesus says I come to give sight to the blind praise God now natural sight is beautiful but even more beautiful than that is spiritual sight so you can see the kingdom of God praise God the kingdom of God is not a physical building right it's not a physical building the kingdom of God is a spiritual building and the Bible says you are one of the stones in the building what a privilege praise God Amen that we are part of that building Hallelujah I'm just one of the stones you are just one of the stones in this beautiful building praise God hallelujah Maybe by God's grace we'd be a pillar Stone Hallelujah because he said you'll be a pillar in the house of my God hallelujah but you but really the the kingdom is a spiritual house it's a spiritual government like you know brother cam can come here and he can feel the prince of God here he can see the people all obeying the word of God I can go to Cam's church I can go to Albion two hours away I haven't seen these people for three or four years and they're still walking in Step Living the same life that I'm living praise God and we don't even talk why because we're all ruled by the spirit same spiritual King Jesus Christ the righteous one praise God oh it's beautiful and he Jesus said I come to set Liberty them that are bruised Hallelujah so Jesus heals uh from Jesus heals bruises praise God he sets the captives free Hallelujah this is what he come to do and only the spirit of God can do this Satan will want to keep people brokenhearted Satan would want to keep people uh chained up as captives Satan wants to keep people bruised but God's spirit is here to heal praise God hallelujah how many can say God's healed you some way or another praise God physically or spiritually Hallelujah and for me both Hallelujah I'm sure for you too both Hallelujah this is what the good news this is good news doesn't sound like bad news or good news sounds like good news but the first requirement is to repent praise God it's the very first requirement and to repent means to turn away from it means actually has a threefold definition it means to hate your sin uh it means to change your mind and it means to make amends for your sins that's all by the memory of the holy spirit because I didn't have that in my memory so I thank God the holy spirit will bring all things to your remembrance praise God that you have need of so when you really repent you say I hate this that I used to do I hate the sin and the second thing I'm going to change my mind about this sin I'm not going to keep doing this uh I got to now think it's wrong and I got to think of I got to think of a way by God's help to not do it anymore and then third if you've hurt anybody and you possibly can you go to them and make it right you say I'm sorry I sinned against you I'm sorry I was I said that I'm sorry I did that will you forgive me and they'll have to know wow something happened because they never apologized before it was never this sincere before why the spirit of the Lord is now upon you praise God hallelujah it's upon you to set you free from your guilt set you free from your shame hallelujah it's there to help your broken heart be healed praise God that's the gospel Hallelujah the good news of the Gospel but it comes by repentance Hallelujah now like if you go since we're in Luke right here I believe if I can find it real quick I believe it's chapter 15 if I'm not mistaken let's find that uh of Zacchaeus now somebody can find that real quick this was not my notes I just thought I'd go to it can somebody anybody seen that yet there it is it's Luke Luke 19. so I was going the wrong way I was going to less verses I knew it was right around here Luke 19. so Zacchaeus of course was a man uh not liked he was not well liked he was a tax collector and and perhaps he he took extra money from the people uh and he was not a well-liked person but Jesus sees him in verse 5 Luke 19 verse 5 and Jesus came to a place he looked up and saw him and said to him Zacchaeus make haste come down for today I must abide at thy house now this was unheard of you know a holy person would never go into a tax collector's house because they were known to be Thieves they were known to be dishonest and and no one liked them they didn't have good reputations but you see earlier in verse 4 he ran before and he climbed up so we see he had a desire to see Jesus right so when you have a desire you make extra effort to see Jesus praise God hallelujah he ran ahead he climbed a tree when was the last time you climbed a tree some of you adults right it's been a long time since I climbed a tree and a good thing too because I might fall out and break a leg but he climbed a tree and all these it was I said he was a little man as a little man and he climbed up and he just wanted to see Jesus and Jesus stops and looks up and calls him out he said I'm coming to your house today so there must have been something in Zacchaeus you know because Jesus won't invite himself over Jesus is always knocking at the door Hallelujah right he want to bite himself over but if you open the door he'll come in praise God so he must have wanted to have this desire to see Jesus and so he does that in verse 6 and he said he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that that he was gone to be the guest with a man that's a sinner so the religious people didn't like that he was going to a sinner's house and Zacchaeus stood and said in the Lord behold or behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold so if I saw a hundred dollars I'm giving him back 400. talk about interest this is the opposite kind of Interest right not charging it but giving it right my and Jesus said to him this day what day was it this day praise God look as soon as you make that decision I'm tired of sinning I'm tired of doing people wrong and I'm going to do something about it I'm going to make amends for my sin that's the day you're saved praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God because before you won't do it you'll just let your your mistakes you know live in the past you'll try to drown it out with uh you know food or or alcohol or something you'll try to drown that out with entertainment or something like that but as soon as you repent you'll do everything in your power to make it right because you're a part of a new government praise God your king told you to make it right and so you'll do it even four times the amount praise God that's a repentant heart right there if I did you wrong I'll restore you four times what I did to you Hallelujah Jesus said this day this person got saved this day Zacchaeus finally repented of his sins and he'll make it right Hallelujah I love this because this is so beautiful this day salvation come to this house for as much as he is also a son of Abraham so that proves you are a spiritual uh descendant of Abraham when you make your wrongs right ah it proves you're a part of that that historical family amen that family that's going to be blessed Hallelujah all the world will be blessed through Abraham praise God and when you repent and make things right and you make your wrongs right you make amends the Bible said that proves you are Abraham's seed praise God in other words you are a friend of God just like Abraham was praise God oh Hallelujah he is also a son of Abraham what a beautiful scripture verse 10 for the son of man has come to seek and save that which is lost it doesn't look like Zacchaeus is seeking Jesus right he's running ahead he's climbing the tree but really Jesus was seeking Zacchaeus Hallelujah that's how it is the Bible said God God reaches out to each person and draws them unto him so Jesus was drawing him unto him Jesus was actually seeking him out the Holy Spirit would go to Zacchaeus and so I want to I've heard the testimonies I want to hear about him I got to see him I know he's passing by today praise God oh that's how we should come to church I know the spirit of God will be there Lord Don't Pass Me By touch me today praise God Hallelujah that's exactly right so here's a beautiful example if you when you get saved you will make amends for your wrongs and that's operating according to the kingdom of God the spiritual kingdom of God and that starts with repentance praise God all right go to Acts 2 38 by the grace of God Hallelujah Acts 2 38 very familiar scripture this is the first one I memorized when I come in the message then Peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so 50 days after Jesus went to heaven I'm sorry 50 days after the resurrection rather 10 days after Jesus went to heaven Peter preaches on the day of Pentecost and he says if you want to be a part of this Kingdom you must repent of your sins and you must be buried in water as the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is called Over You Hallelujah and then if you do that the Bible said he'll remit your sins he'll send your sins away what a beautiful promise praise God and brother Adam said this if there ever was a Creed to the apostles this was their Creed amen hallelujah this will always be up my Creed as well by God's grace Creed means I believe so I believe Acts 2 30. how many believe Acts 2 38. Hallelujah I believe this is My Confession so here we see this is the way into the kingdom repent of all your sins Jesus will send your sins away he'll remit your sins send them away and then he'll send you also the gift of the Holy Ghost praise God which is God's Spirit dwelling in your soul right we have three parts we have the body we have the mind and the Soul praise God and so God's spirit comes upon the Mind first to repent of all the sins and then the Holy Spirit keeps repenting after you're baptized you baptize in water the spirit of God keeps dealing with your mind giving you a new spirit the Bible said new heart new spirit praise God he cleans out your mind and then when your mind is clean and you have new habits and a new life then the Bible said he gives you my spirit praise God he puts the holy spirit in your soul and then it's constantly living abiding praise God and then you don't have to have anybody tell you about Jesus Jesus lives inside of you praise God hallelujah amen he's now living inside Paul would call it Christ in you the hope of glory Paul would say that Jesus Christ Works in me mightily praise God how many feel the mighty power of Christ work in your life amen it works mightily to save you Works mightily to sanctify you and works mightily to fill you with the Holy Spirit praise God and then Works mightily to help you humble yourself and make it through your trials praise God and give you a testimony teaching you to obey teaching you to suffer praise God because if you suffer with him you shall reign with him amen oh Hallelujah beautiful now this remission of sins reminds me of Isaiah 53. let's go to Isaiah 53 . reminds me that song I love to tell the story to them who know it best Hallelujah Isaiah 53. of course is speaking of Jesus I'll start at verse 3. he is despised and rejected a man a man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despise and we had esteemed him not speaking of every person basically was not worthy of Salvation even Jesus's own disciples ran from him when he was arrested except John came there at the cross right but the Bible said all the Sheep were scattered everybody said they'd stand up and I'll die for him I die from but when the soldiers came with swords they all scattered and so the Bible foretold this 800 years in advance that he would be rejected by all men verse four now here's verse 4 we're really getting the beautiful work that the cross accomplished surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrow so Jesus took your griefs jesus carried your sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed what a beautiful picture jesus takes all the punishment for all of our sins for every iniquity Every Lie we told every evil thing we did every Angry thing we did all the all the stealing all the blasphemies that we did all the Abominations that we did all the wicked things that we could name but we'd never want to name but all those things that shouldn't even be spoken Jesus Took the punishment for all those the Bible said he was wounded for you he stood in your place he got the whippings you should have got praise God he got the chastening and the and the the punishment that you should have got and but the Bible said with each whip that was bringing more and more healing praise God oh so all 39 Stripes praise God all 39 each time he was slapped each time he was spit on each time it was him bringing you more healing all the punishment of all mankind of all time was placed on this all-time great one praise God the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen he was God's lamb Hallelujah God's lamb verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of who of us oh every single person from the 4 000 years before Jesus and now the two thousand years after Jesus all the sins of six thousand years were poured out on Jesus on Mount Calvary that's why I was singing about it that's why we sing about The Old Rugged Cross amen because that's where he took all the punishment for all of our sins praise God and all we got to do to receive salvation is repent and say God I'm changing my mind I'm hating sin and I'll make amends for the wrong I've done praise God what a beautiful gift praise God it's a gift God put all the punishment on Jesus and then the Bible says all the righteousness of Jesus comes on you and I what a story praise God it was it was prefigured by the Jews on the day of atonement the priest would lay his hands on the head of the goat and all the sins of all Israel would go on the head of that goat and then that goat would die for all the sins of Israel and they'd send another goat away with all the sins on it and the Goat would just be lost in the wilderness probably ravished it represented something had to die for everyone's sins and then God in his grace would send our sins completely far away from us praise God we can't even see our sins anymore is that how you see yourself today you can't see your sins because of the blood of Jesus Christ praise God that's the power of the Gospel Hallelujah sending our sins so far away well so it was on the cross God put all the sins of Jesse Smith all the sins of Kristen Smith all the sins of Cam Smith all those sins of each one of us all of that was put on Jesus amen and he said father forgive them they don't know what they do praise God oh it's a beautiful testimony Hallelujah the testimony of the cross thank you Jesus the iniquity of all of us was laid upon him this is the cross this is the message this is the good news Hallelujah thank you Jesus sorry that's a little too close whenever I wear the sweater I got trouble with that verse five he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth Hallelujah so he went to the Cross as a lamb praise God and he took all the sins upon him that he might forgive us praise God now I want to show you the church this is a free absolute free gift salvation is a free gift you don't have to earn it you just have to repent praise God so let's go to Romans 6 23 Romans 6 23. oh the Bible could not be more clear truly these men were anointed by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah I mean who doesn't want a gift today in the natural who wouldn't like you we heard a story about last night about a man who who was gifted a brand new truck we'd all want that gift right oh yeah give me that truck here even if you don't like trucks you can sell it get a pretty good car right we all wish I wish my name got Porter which would listen Church your God name pulled for a way better raffle than that praise God hallelujah amen because you're because your prize won't break down amen your prize won't rust Hallelujah because you have eternal treasure where neither rust nor moth can get it and Destroy praise God Amen Hallelujah my name was pulled on the Heavenly raffle amen predestined chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world Hallelujah don't get me wrong I'd like to win a truck myself but but there's nothing like being chosen to Salvation Hallelujah the joy the peace that passes all understanding amen the wages the payment for your sin is death in other words we deserve a paycheck of death because of our sin that's the paycheck like you work you get a paycheck well we sin we deserve the payment of death that's the paycheck for sin but the gift of God okay so we in other words this is not a paycheck now this is a free gift there's not it's not the wages because you didn't work for it you couldn't earn it I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it still you gave your life away so I'm familiar the precious love of God but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord and the church said the gift of God is eternal life we deserve death we deserve punishment but Jesus Christ paid the price for our sins and when we repent and trust in him for salvation and Believe on him by faith the Bible says we're given the gift of eternal life my life I have tonight this life will end but the life of my soul can never end praise God in other words you're looking at a soul that will never die Hallelujah I'm looking at Souls out there that will never die will live age after age uh Lord hallelujah generation every generation through the Millennium the future home from eternity to Eternity praise God Hallelujah you just see the outward shell but behind the shell is a soul and that Soul has eternal life praise God this shell is going to crack from dried from dry skin too right we're just going to crack and bleed and get broken and all these things but the soul can never be touched by the devil Hallelujah because Jesus said you have been passed from Death unto life praise God Jesus took our payment Jesus Took the punishment Jesus Paid the wages amen Jesus Took the wages praised God that we might have the gift of eternal life praise God oh that's how we get saved so everybody ought to know how to get saved repent of your sins trust in Jesus Christ hate sin make amends for your sin change your mind and the church said amen what a beautiful beautiful salvation plan praise God now the amazing part is very few people will even be saved Matthew 7 14 I believe if I'm not mistaken it seems like there's lots and lots of churches lots and lots of so-called Believers but no nobody really knows only God knows how many are saved out of those Romans 7 I'm sorry Matthew 7. let's read 13 as well Hans you since you're really good at that let's put up 13 up there even doing it with a toddler on your lap praise God I appreciate that entering in at the Straight Gate for wide as the gate and Broad is the way that lead it to destruction and many there be which go in there stay right there so back to 13 there on you so before you were a Christian it was very easy to be a sinner how many could say Amen to that it's easy to sin it's easy to cheer or cheat steal lie lust fornicate all these things it's easy to do that it's a broad Road everybody does it but then when the Holy Spirit comes he says you've got to get off this wide Road and you've got to walk a narrow road in other words not many people are walking on this road praise God next verse Jesus said go in the Straight Gate go in the narrow road don't take the way everybody goes you go the narrow way praise God where very few people will walk that road because straight is the gate and narrows the way which leadeth unto life and few ever say few few not a lot very few people find the way to eternal life but yet Jesus Paid the price for every every sin now why won't people do it because of John 3 19 Jesus tells us himself why won't people receive salvation it's because they love sin more than they love righteousness Jesus Christ said this this is the condemnation that light has come into the world in other words Holiness the gospel is coming to the world and Men love sin or Darkness more than they love the gospel right tonight we can get one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 34 56 70. about 20 people on a Wednesday night I'm preaching about eternal life which can never be taken away which you cannot put a price tag on and there's 20 people here right Sunday they had NFL game there in Cleveland or whatever and they had what 50 000 people there it's because it's easy to get them there because there's rock and roll there's drunkenness there's sexy dress cheerleaders and all these things it's easy to get people there that's the broad road but God is saying leave all that and come down to the narrow road but see they love that they love Darkness well the same is true about us and God we love God we love the narrow way we love the truth we love Holiness that's why we live it praise God but there'll be very few of us and we ought to be thankful to God that we're one of those few that will believe it praise God Hallelujah I'm one of the few I thought about singing that song Tonight by God's grace I'm one of the few praise God there's very few people that want to actually be saved that actually want to repent of their sins change their thinking hate sin and make amends for their sin very few my goodness uh let's go to Romans 1 here uh let's show how all men are without excuse there will be no excuses on the day of judgment yeah verse 20. Romans 1 20. no one would be able to say well I didn't know I didn't know God had a law I didn't know about Jesus Christ no one will be able to say that the Bible said all men are without excuse God preaches the gospel to them not just with preachers not only does are there men preachers but there's also the creationist preaching to them imagine that the son that they see every morning is preaching the gospel to them the seasons are preaching the gospel death and Resurrection amen it's just the gospel is everywhere praise God and also even in their even in their own being they can look at their own being in their own mind and realize there's someone that gave me this ability I was not just a an accident someone brought me here someone sent me here someone gave me all these blessings someone gave me all these organs at work somebody gave me this brain that worked praise God somebody's greater than me and so I must come from somewhere I need to find out where I come from God put that gospel right inside of them praise God for they are all without excuse actually let's read 19 too I keep and scripture hunt I'm sorry because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God has showed it unto them so in other words things that can be known about God is actually seen in your body right in your being right you know things you understand things you can grow you can learn so much you learn all this God put all this knowledge inside of you so you can learn all this and it helps you to understand God Hallelujah verse 20. for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse Hallelujah so there be no excuses on the day of judgment praise God and then the Bible now go to the next chapter Romans 2 verse 16 and then this new testament Paul says actually I'll just use Paul's letters from Romans from Romans on the chapters in the book of Acts Paul says all these letters that the Holy Spirit gave to Paul all these think of this all the world will be judged by Paul's gospels look at that small little trip of paper God's going to judge every person by this much paper right here the contents on that paper how many one know it's on that paper I want to know that's my greatest desire what is on that paper what do I got to do what does God what does god require me in that day when God shall judge the secrets of men's hearts by Jesus Christ according to my gospel that's why we must know Romans and First Corinthians and second Corinthians and Galatians and Ephesians and Philippians and Colossians and the church said and Seth Thessalonians and Timothy and Philemon and Titus we must know these because that is the Judgment standard that's what God is going to say didn't she do this why didn't you do this it was placed right there in front of you but thank God we can say I did it by your grace amen I did it because the spirit of God was anointing me to do it praise God hallelujah oh it's beautiful what a beautiful story Hallelujah now there's a few more I want to get to here by the grace of the Lord Ephesians 2 verses 8 9 and 10 honey Ephesians 2 8 9 and 10. again we go to this idea of God's salvation is a gift to you for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves how are you saved by grace that's an unmerited gift God gives you a gift you don't deserve that saves you and that not of yourselves it wasn't because I'm good or because I did something it is the gift of God so again we see this idea of gift when you don't deserve it how many know you don't deserve it praise God not of Works us any man should boast every no woman bragging in heaven there'll be no man bragging in heaven there's only one to be one person we're all bragging on and that's Jesus Christ praise God for we are his workmanship we were created in Christ unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so God Saves you by giving you a gift and then once you get saved you're so happy you think Lord you gave me this gift now what can I do for you what jobs do you want me to do in life what assignments do I have what's my destiny what do you want me to do in life and then the Bible said if you love God and you receive that gift you will go out and find God's Destiny for your life nothing will stop you because you know what God's done for you and you'll be happy to do a little work for God praise God because of all that he's done for you Hallelujah oh it's beautiful and not only that but God ordained you to do it in other words there's nobody else that can do it except you right there's like sister who can reach people that I can't reach I can reach people that she can't reach right God has specific jobs and assignments for you that only you can do and God actually created you specifically just to do it praise God oh my God Austin was built to do the works of God but only the works that he can do God had to all ordained all lined up all about growing up in Akron all about Arizona all about getting lean out there all about coming back God's got to all ordained being a light and a witness to Jeannie and all these all these different ones by God's grace God had it all lined up praise God and all we had to do is receive the gift and say Lord what do you want me to do and God will show us what to do hallelujah oh thank God what a beautiful what a beautiful salvation Hallelujah few though actually want this I'm sure if if you're like me you feel I'm Chomper at the bit Lord just show me what to do and I'll do it that's that's my desire I'm just so hungry I'm so I'm so longing Lord just show me what to do and I'll do it praise God Lead Me inspire me how many how many pray that Lord open the door if you want me to do something for you just show me just show me that's what I prayed on Sunday I was praying with those Brothers at the altar I said Lord I'm just such a uh uh an unintelligent person I said make it so plain I can't miss it because if I'm if I miss it if I'm smart or something I might miss it but if I if I say how hum if I'm humble and I just make myself little and if I just keep repenting and keep keep loving and serving you surely I won't miss what you're showing me praise God then the Bible say God will give you some ice out so you can see that's what the Bible says Jesus said come to me and buy of me I Sal that you can see now see before you couldn't see the kingdom but now when you get the eye Salve on you can see praise God I got these glasses last year and they had to give me one of those uh tests and they squirt that stuff in your eye you know you can't see I'm driving home I got those I got those sunglasses on I can hardly see I'm like I don't want to die in a car accident Lord please have mercy on me I'm just squinting and you know you're so sensitive to the light they put that iodine I don't know but I can't remember what it is but I would you know but you can't even see you're like how in the world am I going to get home how is this possible but then eventually it wears off you get your eyesight back and you can see it again you feel safe that's how it is with Jesus without Jesus you feel blind you're going to die there's it's all bad news but with the Holy Ghost you can see you know exactly what to do you know exactly where you're going and you know exactly what Christ did for you praise God oh Hallelujah what do we got to do church we just gotta walk in the works that God has ordained for you Hallelujah that makes each of us thankful it makes each of us excited well I wonder what God is going to do in this next phase of my life Hallelujah that's why I look at my life by God's grace I bought some big old paper the other day you know you ever seen those big Post-it notes they're like this tall you ever seen those postiness and you can hang them up on the wall do you ever see the you know the school we use them in school you know big huge papers and they got posted noted the sticky stuff I bought some of that and I've been writing out my goals because I like to look up there I like this I I I like I'm like a visual learner so I wrote up my goals now I got my soon goals my long-term goals my prayer requests I got it all up there and the next I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like a whole timeline of my life well this season in my life was you know for for pastor at the beginning and all these different things this is my season for being saved this was the season for you know writing books and YouTube videos and I just want to see so I can know what is God doing in my life right now I don't want to miss what he has done praise God I want to thank God for every season because the Bible says as long as I'm planted in Christ I'm like a tree and my leads won't wither praise God and in every season I'll bring forth fruit praise God so every season I wonder about when Austin got saved I want to put that because that was the season of My Life when brother amen got saved and sister that was a season of my life and God gave me fruit for each season I can't wait to get it done I can't wait actually to have time to start on it actually but October is the busiest year or month of the whole year for me so and we have a parent-teacher conferences I have all these meetings one of these days by God's grace I'm gonna get that but I got the first one done see I want to know the works that God has ordained me to walk in I want to know that and I want to do exactly what God's called me to do Hallelujah so all men are without excuse God Saves Us by grace Hallelujah and then he ordains God has something for you to do so don't let the devil tell you oh you're hopeless and there's really nothing for you no there is something specifically for you to do praise God like I'll use my mom as an example I don't know if Sage or Jordan or about my mom so my mom and dad had six kids right my dad divorced my mom when I was in the seventh grade and so she chose to stay at home and and just stay with us she says many days you don't even know how she made it through the day didn't even know but every morning she would pray with the kids before we go to school and every night she'd Corral all these crazy Broncos and bring them into the room for prayer about at night time and she didn't even know how she did it but see God had or Works ordained for her to do so all by herself with six kids she would drive all six kids to church every Wednesday night every Sunday every Sunday that was her work and she and she said all I did I hardly had any Energy washing dishes cooking for six kids imagine that cooking for sixes has anybody done that before that's a lot of every single day well my wife does it for for 10 you know that's why I think my mother-in-law respects my wife so much you know which is good God ordained that God ordained those good works but you know my mom told me she said uh she said I had so little energy I just just trying to get to the end of the day she said all I could do when I prayed at the end of the day was just say Lord save my children can you imagine having no energy but the last words before you collapsed on the bed Lord save my children and she did that for 20 years so all the kids were raised but that was her work to do she was ordained to that work and now all six have repented and been baptized how many moms can say that all six of your kids are actually serving Jesus Christ and she's got three preachers in there too not just love Jesus Christ but actually called into the service of Jesus Christ to be leaders in the in the government in the kingdom of God three so you think oh you know divorced woman she hardly asked what place does she have what good works does she have she can take them to church and tell them about Jesus that's a good word say like this it's better than the good work that's a great work amen hallelujah I praise God and God ordained that from before the foundation of the world that she would do that and she would do those good works Hallelujah so never think God doesn't care or God's not watching your life God watches every detail of your life he wants to bless every detail of your life I told his testimony in Albany they were really blessed so my mom you know my mom and dad divorce my dad eventually they get to the age where they get retirement my mom got no retirement because they divorced my dad get all the money of the Social Security and so my mom was that nothing but then she took care of a 90 year old guy and the 90 year old guy passed away and he he was going to donate all of his giving away to like Bob Jones University and the Republican Party but right before he died he said no give all the money to my mom and now my mom has way more money than Social Security could ever give her does God know you does God know your needs absolutely does God see you even when no it looks like nobody cares or nobody see you does God see you is God keeping track you better believe God is keeping track nobody can tell me God doesn't keep tracking God doesn't see the divorced woman God don't see the single mother God sees and he cares and he'll back up his word amen he has works for you to do praise God he's ordained ordained my mom to take us to church I hate church when I was little and now I love church there's nothing better to me than church amen who would have thought that I never thought to be a preacher never ever not one time in my whole life I hated singing I don't know I just but now I love it by God's grace it was some gift laying in there it's hard to see as a rough just a rough situation praise God but God had a pastor in there God had a preacher God had a teacher in there of all the things you know just see but God created now even a divorced woman even a low-income woman God's watching your Works God's ordained you to do something do it with all your heart keep all the word of God love Jesus Christ with all your heart amen Hallelujah I'm a witness I've seen it firsthand no I can't deny it I've seen it too many times Hallelujah I wish wrote down a few more things I'm going to try it's already eight o'clock here so I'm going to try to if I can try to bring this down here now let me go to Galatians 6 here so to summarize Galatians chapter 6 let me just summarize I believe Paul does a beautiful job summarizing what what matters most in a Christian Life uh Galatians 6 14 and 15. what matters most in a Christian Life after you're saved you got the free gift of God you know you've received God's gift and now you want to you want to walk in God's ways for your life what matters most Paul tells us what matters most God forbid that I should Glory or boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me so for me the world the world was smoking cigarettes chewing tobacco drinking alcohol watching sports all day Sunday Thursday night football Monday Night Football dirty movies right bad magazines cussing all these wicked things that was the world to me but when I came to Christ I crucified every one of those I killed him in other words they don't influence my life anymore they have no control over me praise God because God came to heal my broken heart praise God Amen well the reason I was into those things because my heart was broken that my dad left me right that's the only reason but the Bible says in Christ we can boast in the cross of Jesus Christ and we crucify the things of the world I love this for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision a Jewish tradition avails anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature let's say new creature ready new creature avails or prevails or has power the only thing that has power is a new creature god making a new person out of Austin Laramie or Lena Goodwin or Malachi Smith the only thing that prevails the only thing that has any power is you letting God make you a new creature he builds you up this is what the Bible says he builds he gives you Faith then he gives you virtue These Are Spiritual Powers you get the power of Faith power virtue power more power of temperance more power more power more power and then he Seals All That Power into you praise God he locks it up and seals it in and all that power sealed in there by the love of God Hallelujah that's what counts now of course we all want to be saved but if God gives us time to be saved then he wants to fill us with power he wants to make us new creatures praise God this is what prevails in a Christian's life how many appreciate that by God's grace this is the only thing Paul says that that avails that prevails that has power or weight is the new creature God make me brand new make me say things that people thought they never hear come out of my mouth I used to cuss or blaspheme or or ridicule or tease or anything Lord just brings blessings out of my mouth make it brand new praise God Lord let me meditate uh let the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy side oh God Amen Hallelujah Let The Works of my hands be honest before everybody everything I do let everything I do testify of Jesus Christ let me be a new creature let me sing the right songs instead of the wrong songs praise God let me read the right books let me go to the right websites instead of the wrong ones Hallelujah let me buy the right things and say the wrong things let me give away money instead of hoarding it all for myself because you can't take it with you anyway praise God Hallelujah thank you Jesus well there's so much that could be said has has it seemed like this a good presentation of the Gospel praise God this is the good news the good news is Jesus Christ came to die for our sins and then now that we're saved he's created us under good works his spirit is going to keep working with us and help us to become new creatures in Christ Jesus and the Bible said that newness can be every single day you can be a new person I can be actually more I can I can be better than yesterday thank God I can have a better day today than I had yesterday and the church said Hallelujah as a church we can actually grow closer to God this service than we did even last service we can keep growing closer to God because we come new creatures and we feel this presence and we know he's with us praise God and we see him having Mercy with us we see him guiding us we see him strengthening us praise God we see him answering our prayers praise God we see him speaking to us through his word we see the reality of his presence we see God on the scene of Our Lives praise God member Church he's in every detail of Our Lives every he was in every detail of my mom's life because I always use that because that's my experience I didn't see him in every detail now I see him in every detail Hallelujah oh that was all for this all all these things like I was telling that testimony how God's got Austin out of debt I told that Albion they surely loved that one too they were shouting on that one I said it's easy to give away money because I never had any at the beginning I just knew what it was like not to I just live like that you just live like you don't have much money so when something somebody gives you a large sum it's easy to give away because you're not you're not in love with it you live without it you know it doesn't bring happiness praise God I had lots of rich friends I had the friends but awesome that had the Reebok Pumps the first time they come out those must have been 200 shoes you know you pump them up I'm like how in the world do you afford that you know my shoes got holes in them my shoes were so bad I stepped through a nail one time and the nail went right through my shoe because it was so and then I had to go get a tetanus shot in the back of the building right there it was just flimsy shoes you know I go I see go I go watch my Center friends my rich friends they get the brand new shoes and they're they're cussing swearing they just you know they're living that kind of a life I just live the poor life we needed God we had to pray to keep the heat on in the wintertime we had to pray to keep the water on and make sure the water bill gets paid praise God a single mother with six kids we had to pray for food we had to pray for money for the the football uh cleats and the football jerseys and all that it was constantly praying for those things that Naomi knows what I'm talking about you got to pray you know you got to pray and when you see these things it's you know when you see God's grace on your life then it's easy to extend Grace to other people praise God God ordained all these works in your life it was in every detail to make you what you are today but don't stop where you are today let it make you new for tomorrow praise God and we're almost there 2023 I might as well say it already here we're almost there these months are flying by praise God making you new for next year look at this year bro look at all the testimonies of this year sisterly look at all the testimonies
