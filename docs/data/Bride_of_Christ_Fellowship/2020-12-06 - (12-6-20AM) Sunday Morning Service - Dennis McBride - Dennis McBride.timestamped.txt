[30:20] i can't play praise the lord
[30:25] well it's good to be here
[30:28] i didn't send that link yet because i
[30:31] got to get straightened out on it
[30:33] i got a new phone that was on my old
[30:35] phone
[30:37] and i went to try to look up the actual
[30:41] app and i i couldn't find it so when i
[30:44] get straightened out i'll send it to you
[30:47] hey man okay
[30:51] uh so i don't want to keep you standing
[30:53] long this morning
[30:57] let's see here um
[31:05] we thank god for his word on last night
[31:07] amen
[31:08] amen amen
[31:13] i said what i said because uh
[31:17] you know the lord really does minister
[31:18] to me
[31:21] uh and i can only express what he speaks
[31:24] to my heart
[31:25] hey man that's that's why it's so real
[31:30] you know because he he's dealing with
[31:32] you and
[31:33] and so you it just kind of is able to
[31:35] come forth from that clarity just
[31:37] because of what he's showing you
[31:40] uh let's go to psalms chapter 86.
[31:59] psalms 86 and verse 15.
[32:11] it says but thou o lord ought a god
[32:14] full of compassion amen and gracious
[32:18] long-suffering and plenteous in mercy
[32:21] and truth
[32:22] amen how many appreciate that
[32:26] [Music]
[32:27] yes that's exactly right
[32:30] yeah i know i appreciate it uh let's go
[32:34] also
[32:34] to hebrews uh chapter
[32:40] five
[32:46] actually let's go to hebrews chapter
[32:48] four
[32:50] and we'll start here verse 14.
[32:57] hebrews 4 starting at verse 14 it says
[33:02] seeing then that we have a great high
[33:05] priest
[33:06] that is passed into the heavens
[33:09] the son of god let us hold fast
[33:13] our profession for we have not
[33:16] and high priest which cannot be touched
[33:19] with the feeling of
[33:20] our infirmities but was in all points
[33:24] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[33:28] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[33:31] throne of grace
[33:33] that we may obtain mercy and find
[33:36] grace to help in time of need
[33:41] let's bow once more heavenly father lord
[33:44] please help us
[33:46] in the name of our lord and savior jesus
[33:48] christ we ask it
[33:50] amen amen god bless you sir
[34:08] although there were you know
[34:12] additional things that came to my heart
[34:13] in regards to the message on last night
[34:16] um when i woke up this morning
[34:21] it's kind of what my little spiritual
[34:23] antennas are
[34:24] like lord which way should i go which
[34:26] way what would you have me to speak on
[34:30] and almost immediately this is something
[34:34] that i spoke on before
[34:37] but this just seems like it was it so um
[34:41] we're not going to deal with the portion
[34:43] that we deal with dealt with on last
[34:45] night this is a different subject but i
[34:48] believe it's very important
[34:51] it's it's something that uh
[34:54] i know that uh well i pray to god help
[34:58] me with more so
[35:00] and again i believe that's the reason
[35:02] why he laid it on my heart initially
[35:05] when i initially administered on it
[35:06] because it was just something he wanted
[35:08] to
[35:09] to bring to my mind so
[35:13] uh as a topic this morning we want to
[35:15] deal with
[35:16] uh effective prayer
[35:21] effective prayer and as a subject
[35:23] compassion
[35:26] amen um
[35:30] you know the bible exhorts us to to pray
[35:34] always
[35:36] and it it you know god always teaches us
[35:40] to to pray for one another
[35:44] uh
[35:47] but it does matter how
[35:50] you pray for someone not so much so
[35:54] what you say but where you are
[35:57] spiritually where your heart is where
[35:59] your mind is toward the individual
[36:03] because many times i mean we all like in
[36:06] this room right now
[36:07] there are many prayer requests
[36:11] majority are unspoken right
[36:14] uh but nonetheless there are prayer
[36:16] requests and there are times in which
[36:18] uh people feel compelled in their hearts
[36:23] to maybe ask a certain person hey you
[36:26] know
[36:26] do you mind praying with me right
[36:30] and when a person does that uh for the
[36:34] person that's being asked
[36:36] it shouldn't be taken lightly because if
[36:39] they
[36:40] if they voiced it that means that it was
[36:43] uh important enough to them you know
[36:47] because many times we keep things to
[36:48] ourselves
[36:50] for me i'm a very private uh person i
[36:54] disclose very little about the very deep
[36:57] things that's in my heart
[36:59] uh unless it's somebody that the lord
[37:01] just allows me to have a confidence and
[37:04] a trust in
[37:06] because i don't say this to uh to any
[37:09] negative slant
[37:10] but you really have to be careful who
[37:12] you share the thoughts of your heart
[37:14] with
[37:16] not that they're bad people or anything
[37:18] like that it's just that
[37:20] their spiritual maturity level
[37:23] is not quite where it needs to be
[37:26] so sometimes things might get mishandled
[37:30] they might not be able to hear you in
[37:31] the right way
[37:33] you see and then if they're a person
[37:36] that's maybe
[37:37] prone to speaking things
[37:40] they might take what you shared with
[37:42] them in confidence
[37:43] and speak it to someone else so you
[37:46] really have to be led
[37:48] who you allow yourself to like i said
[37:50] speak the the depths of what's in your
[37:52] heart too
[37:53] uh it has to be somebody that the lord
[37:56] has shown you you can have confidence in
[37:58] not that you can have confidence in the
[37:59] flesh of a man it's just that where he's
[38:02] he's he's where he's brought them up to
[38:06] they're in a place and a position to
[38:08] where
[38:09] their prayer for you if you ask them to
[38:12] pray
[38:13] it can be an effective prayer because of
[38:15] where their heart is concerning you
[38:18] right so um
[38:21] when you talk about effective prayer
[38:25] the reason why i feel this is so
[38:27] important to god is because
[38:30] um
[38:33] if you pray for somebody in a very
[38:36] surface manner
[38:37] you know somebody will pray for me i'll
[38:39] pray for you
[38:40] you know lord bless so and so yeah yeah
[38:46] i remember okay yeah i prayed
[38:49] and sometimes we'll do it sometimes just
[38:51] to tell the person tonight well did you
[38:52] pray for me yeah i prayed for you
[38:54] because you don't want to say i didn't
[38:55] pray for you
[38:56] but when you pray for it's like you
[39:00] weren't really able to enter into that
[39:02] place
[39:04] see there is a place that you can enter
[39:06] into
[39:08] to where it can be really an effective
[39:10] prayer
[39:12] and it's connected with compassion
[39:15] okay so now
[39:19] let's go if you don't mind let's let's
[39:21] go here to uh
[39:24] luke chapter seven because
[39:29] many times amongst church and and you
[39:31] know
[39:33] amongst the ranks you know of of the
[39:36] church
[39:38] um you know if the lord don't help us
[39:43] we can take on a lot of like religious
[39:46] ways
[39:48] you know and and and and the reality of
[39:52] what we're really a part of in the
[39:54] reality of the life that god
[39:56] is leading us into uh it it is
[39:59] it's uh it's not seen correctly um so so
[40:03] god wants us to be able
[40:05] to uh to really have his mind and his
[40:08] heart that's what it's really all about
[40:13] to really have his mind and his heart
[40:16] toward his people not just the saints in
[40:20] the church
[40:22] but to anybody because how many realize
[40:25] that god the bible says god is even kind
[40:27] unto the wicked
[40:29] right you understand that
[40:34] in his word he told us to love our
[40:37] enemies
[40:40] that's contrary to human nature
[40:43] a naturally born man if you have an
[40:46] enemy
[40:47] amen that means that somebody that has a
[40:49] great dislike for you maybe even a hate
[40:51] for you
[40:52] isn't that right but god threw his
[40:55] prophet in this hour
[40:57] he came to us and he told us that hey
[41:00] you just can't give your life for
[41:03] somebody that you feel is a good person
[41:05] worthy of it
[41:06] right you see when i say give your life
[41:08] i'm not so much so talking about death
[41:10] but
[41:10] he said that eternal life is living your
[41:12] life for others
[41:14] isn't that right and many times people
[41:17] that
[41:18] are that maybe or within our family or
[41:21] somebody that we look upon and say man
[41:23] that's a real good person
[41:24] very sweet very kind very generous i
[41:27] don't mind helping them or doing
[41:28] whatever for them
[41:30] that's not how god thinks he causes his
[41:33] reign to fall upon the just and the
[41:35] unjust
[41:37] amen so to really get to where we need
[41:40] to be
[41:41] it we have to have more of his spirit
[41:44] point blank
[41:46] because he has to be the one he has to
[41:48] be the one
[41:49] living it he has to be the one loving
[41:51] through us
[41:54] when we talk about agape love that's not
[41:56] a love you can just go and learn
[41:58] how to love like it's not a learned
[42:00] behavior it's actually
[42:02] a love that comes from a person and if
[42:04] that person is in your heart
[42:05] and that love is able to be expressed
[42:08] his love from within you goes
[42:10] out
[42:13] you understand what i'm saying so that
[42:15] takes it beyond just religion that can't
[42:17] that takes it much much further beyond
[42:20] just conformance to the message
[42:24] but now the very person of the message
[42:26] the word itself
[42:29] is now residing on the inside of us and
[42:32] and we who we were in our ways and our
[42:35] habits and our makeup
[42:36] it begins to diminish and then now he
[42:39] begins to increase
[42:43] and that's what this is really all about
[42:45] the more we the further we go on our
[42:47] journey with god
[42:49] we are dying more and his presence is
[42:51] increasing more
[42:53] brother branham said god wants to grow
[42:55] up into your mouth
[42:57] he wants to grow up into your eyes
[43:00] meaning he wants to control more of your
[43:02] sight and what you look at
[43:03] he wants to control how you speak
[43:06] he wants to control what you listen to
[43:09] he want to control the whole house
[43:11] is his house you understand and the more
[43:15] that begins to happen like i said
[43:17] you don't have to toot your own horn for
[43:19] nothing
[43:20] as a matter of fact that's the furthest
[43:22] thing from your mind talking about
[43:24] tooting your heart
[43:25] you don't want to you don't even want to
[43:26] be known like that
[43:29] you get to a place where you're just
[43:30] like lord have your way
[43:33] even he being god in the flesh when he
[43:35] would do different
[43:37] miraculous things he'll tell the
[43:39] individual see you tell no man
[43:43] amen he didn't go around proclaiming all
[43:46] the miraculous things he had done
[43:48] that's not his nature
[43:51] so when that same god is on the inside
[43:54] of us
[43:56] you understand when it's him when it's
[43:57] the person
[43:59] that same nature is automatically there
[44:02] you don't have to remember to try to be
[44:04] humble you would just be humble
[44:12] luke chapter 7 starting at verse 36
[44:16] it says that one of the pharisees
[44:18] desired him that that he would
[44:20] eat with him and he went into the
[44:23] pharisees house and sat down to meet
[44:25] and behold a woman in the city which was
[44:28] a sinner
[44:30] when she knew that jesus sat at meat at
[44:32] the pharisees house brought it brought a
[44:34] alabaster box of ointment
[44:36] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[44:40] and began to wash his feet with tears
[44:42] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[44:44] head and kiss his feet and anointed them
[44:47] with the ointment
[44:48] now when the pharisee which had been now
[44:50] watch this carefully watch his
[44:52] watch his mind this was a religious man
[44:56] right dedicated to the things of god to
[44:58] the work of god
[44:59] knew the word of god and in his own
[45:03] opinion new god
[45:07] but he lacked many things yes sir
[45:11] many vital things yes watch his mind now
[45:16] now when the pharisee which had bid him
[45:18] saw it
[45:19] he spake within himself
[45:24] didn't our prophet tell us your thoughts
[45:26] are heard louder in heaven
[45:28] than your words are upon the earth
[45:44] he said within himself saying this man
[45:48] if he were a prophet would have known
[45:51] who in what manner of woman this is that
[45:54] touches him
[45:56] for she is a sinner
[45:59] i'm talking about it effective prayer
[46:03] here he is a pharisee
[46:06] you're supposed to be there as a servant
[46:08] to the people
[46:09] you supposed to be there to be able to
[46:11] help the people
[46:13] but how can you help the people when
[46:15] you're so critical
[46:17] [Music]
[46:20] your mind and your heart ain't even in
[46:22] the right place
[46:23] look at how you're viewing this woman
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] and right now at this moment as you're
[46:29] thinking this simon
[46:31] you're forgetting about your own sins
[46:33] brother
[46:36] [Music]
[46:39] the thing you had to ask god to forgive
[46:41] you for
[46:44] it may not be the same act but brother
[46:47] it's in the same pot
[46:49] pot can't call kettle greasy or whatever
[46:51] he say
[46:53] amen it's the same thing but somehow
[46:56] people get this religious spirit upon
[46:58] them
[46:58] and it causes them to be blind to their
[47:01] own faults and failures but be able to
[47:03] look upon somebody else
[47:04] and magnify
[47:08] he should have been in his feet
[47:13] he was so pious
[47:16] so religious by his own works
[47:20] his own righteousness that was filthy
[47:24] filthy rags in the sight of god
[47:27] somehow he thought he was cleaner he was
[47:30] better
[47:34] and here god is in the flesh the god he
[47:37] said he served
[47:38] sitting right there in front of him and
[47:40] he was blind to who that was
[47:43] yes he thought he was serving god
[47:46] he thought god was on his side he had
[47:49] god's thoughts
[47:51] that same god sitting right there
[47:54] the one and this woman is worshiping
[47:59] he couldn't pray for that woman right
[48:03] he could pray but it would be empty
[48:07] all right because his thoughts toward
[48:09] her wasn't even right
[48:13] watch this saints we're going to go back
[48:15] there but watch this the word compassion
[48:19] it means sympathetic awareness
[48:22] of others distressed together watch this
[48:26] or sympathetic awareness of
[48:29] others distressed together with a desire
[48:33] to alleviate it
[48:40] if he knew what kind of a woman this was
[48:42] that touches him
[48:48] some filth look at her look at her he
[48:51] don't even know
[48:51] he's not if he was a pro he's not a
[48:53] prophet problem he don't even know who
[48:54] this woman is
[48:56] he's allowing her to touch him
[49:00] did he have a desire to help that woman
[49:03] to alleviate her out of her situation
[49:06] you recognize she's a sinner brother
[49:09] what you understand
[49:13] and you recognize that you're speaking
[49:15] it but yet where's your heart concerning
[49:18] her
[49:18] you don't care about her soul
[49:24] you don't have sympathy to water the
[49:26] word sympathy means
[49:27] feeling of pity or sorrow for someone
[49:30] else's misfortune
[49:34] i'm talking about effective prayer
[49:39] this is a place saints that only god can
[49:43] all take us right all right we're
[49:44] hearing it this morning but you can't
[49:46] take yourself to this place i'm talking
[49:48] about
[49:49] we got to labor in prayer and lay before
[49:51] god and allow and then allow god to take
[49:53] us up into his realms
[49:57] the brother asked for the brandon
[49:58] brother branham how you get out there
[50:00] like that he said only god can put a man
[50:02] here
[50:04] amen but it's a place that god is
[50:09] requiring
[50:11] that we come to he he wants us to be
[50:14] like himself
[50:16] we read in the bible the bible says that
[50:18] he's what he says
[50:19] i'm going to read it again you ain't got
[50:20] to turn there it says but thou
[50:22] o lord ought a god full of compassion
[50:26] all of the word compassion up in the
[50:28] bible and there's so many scriptures
[50:30] both old and new testament
[50:33] where it speaks of the compassion of god
[50:36] amen
[50:36] amen he's a compassionate god watch this
[50:39] now
[50:40] compassion again means sympathetic
[50:42] awareness of others distressed together
[50:44] with the desire to alleviate it
[50:46] that's why the bible says that we have
[50:48] not a high priest who cannot be touched
[50:51] but he can be touched in the right way
[50:55] he cares he cares about where we are
[50:59] and what we're going through in our
[51:00] struggles and our trials
[51:03] he cares about our weaknesses and our
[51:05] sins and failures
[51:07] he really cares about that but his care
[51:10] is coupled together
[51:11] with the desire to alleviate it
[51:15] amen that's why the bible says now
[51:17] because we have that kind of a high
[51:19] priest let us go
[51:20] boldly before his throne of grace
[51:23] that we might find help and grace to
[51:26] help in a time of need
[51:30] meaning when we go to him we ain't
[51:32] serving a cold
[51:33] guard that's sitting there ready to
[51:34] judge us and and condemn us and things
[51:37] of that nature that's not how he is
[51:39] but that's the kind of picture satan
[51:40] tries to paint
[51:44] he's just sitting back waiting for you
[51:45] to make every mistake and rather wait
[51:47] waiting
[51:48] to get down on you and to make you feel
[51:50] bad about what you did wrong
[51:53] he wants you to feel the guilt of it but
[51:55] at the same time
[51:56] he wants to help you to be free from it
[51:59] he cares so in hot remember he told
[52:03] israel he said now only if you knew the
[52:06] thoughts i thought towards you
[52:09] you being taken captive this enemy i
[52:12] allowed this enemy to come in
[52:13] a gentile king come in and take you why
[52:17] because you're doing wrong see you not
[52:18] obeying my voice
[52:20] and i'm sending through my prophets
[52:23] amen that was his service isn't that
[52:25] right he did nothing except he revealed
[52:27] his secret through his service to
[52:29] prophets
[52:29] and they came out and proclaimed the
[52:31] word of the lord and here jeremiah was
[52:33] the mouthpiece of god listen
[52:36] god called him a physician
[52:41] he said is there no bomb in gilead is
[52:44] there no physician there
[52:48] the great physician was in his earthly
[52:50] physician
[52:52] speaking his medication and what he
[52:55] prescribed
[52:56] to his bride to bring her health up to
[52:59] make a hole again
[53:01] to looser from the grips of the devil
[53:03] the head abound
[53:07] lord let's see he ain't having a white
[53:10] coat see
[53:12] they didn't recognize him to be a
[53:14] physician
[53:15] but he was god's gift to them
[53:18] and they slapped him and wanted to kill
[53:20] him why
[53:22] because of the medication that god was
[53:24] administering
[53:27] see it wasn't it it didn't have a cherry
[53:29] or strawberry flavor
[53:32] it had a brussels sprout kind of taste
[53:34] to it
[53:36] hey man it wasn't
[53:39] it wasn't flavorful to take down but if
[53:42] you take it down
[53:43] it'll do everything you need you need to
[53:45] get done it'll heal you it'll
[53:47] get you right again it'll heal the
[53:50] wounds and the sores
[53:53] it'll make you sound again
[53:57] when it comes to god's word you got to
[53:58] eat the whole thing
[54:01] god ain't got this ministry up here just
[54:02] for no reason just killing time this
[54:04] ain't no ritual
[54:06] almighty god from heaven is here
[54:09] amongst his people ministering to his
[54:12] people the unsearchable riches of god
[54:14] giving us what we need for us to make it
[54:17] out of here
[54:18] and the devil comes by and gets people
[54:21] to treat things
[54:22] commonly it's the enemy it's not the
[54:24] people
[54:25] nobody in their right minds will
[54:26] mishandle god
[54:29] that's why jesus said on the cross
[54:31] father forgive them
[54:32] for they know not what they do and in
[54:35] this same hour for as many people that
[54:37] are crucifying christ afresh
[54:42] denying the only lord god coming in the
[54:45] form of his holy ghost and his revealed
[54:47] word
[54:49] they don't know what they're doing if
[54:52] they knew they would stop they would run
[54:54] from and they would repent
[54:56] but they're blind
[55:01] what you do with a blind man he can't
[55:02] see
[55:05] the pharisees asked jesus are we blind
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] he said if you were blind and you would
[55:11] be in a better position
[55:13] physically blind but because you say you
[55:16] see
[55:19] you in a bad situation now
[55:22] praise the lord so god looks upon
[55:26] us with compassion
[55:29] he's here to help us yeah don't you
[55:32] appreciate that saints
[55:35] he's not just this god of judgment
[55:37] waiting to judge and
[55:38] no he loves us that's why he exhorted us
[55:42] in his word as husbands and husbands
[55:43] love your wives even as christ also
[55:46] loved the church
[55:51] hey man not looking down upon our wives
[55:53] and ridiculing and this and that and the
[55:55] other but no
[55:56] having this sexy you you can't love your
[55:58] wife right unless he's in you
[56:01] that's right that's right that's the
[56:02] bottom line
[56:04] that's why for the sisters that ain't
[56:05] married yet you ate weight
[56:07] praise sincerely and the lord gave you a
[56:10] husband full of the holy ghost
[56:13] but you also pray and ask the lord to
[56:15] fill you with the holy ghost
[56:17] so he ain't got no work on his head
[56:21] it makes a difference when you have
[56:24] somebody that can be pricked by the
[56:26] spirit of god whose heart is tender
[56:29] they make mistakes they might even speak
[56:30] in the wrong spirit about something when
[56:32] the holy ghost get done with them
[56:34] they coming right back to you honey i'm
[56:35] sorry forgive me
[56:38] why god is grooming now making it look
[56:42] it's one thing to enter into the
[56:43] ministry and brother jesse knows this
[56:46] the lord might call you to be a pastor
[56:48] evangelist uh
[56:49] whatever the case might be it's one
[56:51] thing to be called that and enter into
[56:53] the ministry but then god has to
[56:55] actually grow you up he has to season
[56:57] you into the maturity of that ministry
[57:01] so as soon as a man steps out into the
[57:03] ministry he's not
[57:05] he's not he he doesn't he doesn't have
[57:07] the fullness of what he's supposed to
[57:09] there's elements that god is going to
[57:11] add to him along his walk
[57:13] and then once it gets to a right place
[57:15] then that
[57:16] season ministry is able to really be or
[57:20] be a
[57:20] be more of a blessing to the people than
[57:22] what it was when it first started
[57:24] i say that because likewise for a family
[57:26] when a man and a woman get married
[57:28] amen when you get married everything is
[57:30] not everything is not where it's
[57:32] supposed to be in the beginning
[57:33] but god works with both of you to grow
[57:35] you into where you need to be so you can
[57:37] be a more of a blessing to one another
[57:39] and to your children
[57:41] that's just how it works praise the lord
[57:43] let's go back to luke 7.
[57:46] is that where i was luke 7 yeah all
[57:48] right so now this pharisee
[57:52] his heart wasn't in the right place his
[57:54] mind wasn't in the right place
[57:55] concerning his woman
[57:56] so he was able to look at her at the
[57:58] angle that he did which was the angle of
[58:01] the devil
[58:05] i want to make sure that's clear
[58:08] this pharisee's view of that woman
[58:11] was the view that satan wanted him to
[58:13] have
[58:16] how many understand that he was
[58:20] religious
[58:21] seemingly serving god but under the
[58:24] anointing of an evil spirit
[58:34] and we're not exempt from that
[58:41] and god knows that so within our course
[58:44] of life he has
[58:45] things already set that's going to help
[58:49] to
[58:51] is going to help us to die completely to
[58:54] everything that's not like him
[58:56] and cause what is of him that's already
[58:59] inside of that seed
[59:01] to come to life and to begin to manifest
[59:04] itself
[59:05] it's a process yes
[59:11] praise the lord so now in verse four
[59:14] this is in jesus answering because
[59:16] remember he spoke that within himself
[59:19] but jesus heard it clearly as though he
[59:22] said it with his words out of his mouth
[59:26] and you can imagine how simon felt that
[59:28] oh lord
[59:30] you're addressing what i spoke in my
[59:32] heart
[59:34] he may he may or for a moment recognize
[59:36] he was in the presence of something more
[59:38] than what he thought
[59:40] and jesus answering said unto him simon
[59:42] i have somewhat to say unto thee
[59:46] and he saith master say on there was a
[59:49] certain creditor which had two debtors
[59:51] and one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[59:55] and when they had nothing to pay he
[59:57] frankly forgave them both
[1:00:00] tell me therefore which of them will
[1:00:02] love him most
[1:00:04] simon answered and said i suppose that
[1:00:06] he to whom he forgave most
[1:00:08] and he said unto him thou has rightly
[1:00:10] judged
[1:00:11] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:00:13] simon sia style this woman
[1:00:16] i entered into thine house thou gave us
[1:00:18] me no water for my feet but she hath
[1:00:21] washed my feet with the tear
[1:00:22] with with tears and wiped them with the
[1:00:24] hands of her head
[1:00:26] thou gave this me no kiss but this woman
[1:00:28] since the time i came in has not
[1:00:31] ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil
[1:00:34] thou didst not anoint
[1:00:35] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[1:00:37] with ointment wherefore i say unto thee
[1:00:40] her sins which are many
[1:00:43] are forgiven for she loved
[1:00:46] much but to whom little is forgiven the
[1:00:49] same
[1:00:50] lover
[1:00:53] and he said unto her thy sins be
[1:00:55] forgiven and they that said and meet
[1:00:57] with him began to say within themselves
[1:01:00] who is this that forgive of sins also
[1:01:03] and he say unto the woman thy
[1:01:04] faith have saved thee go in peace
[1:01:12] his view of the woman is the correct
[1:01:14] view
[1:01:16] and this is the mind remember let this
[1:01:18] mind be in you which was also in christ
[1:01:20] jesus
[1:01:23] is more than just having power or
[1:01:25] understanding of the word and things of
[1:01:27] that nature it's actually a life that
[1:01:29] we're pursuing
[1:01:32] it's his person paul said that he didn't
[1:01:35] count himself to have already attained
[1:01:37] but he was
[1:01:38] actually pressing forward that he might
[1:01:41] apprehend that in which he was
[1:01:42] apprehended by
[1:01:44] so god got a hold of him but in paul's
[1:01:46] heart he didn't think himself to be
[1:01:48] high anything like that he said look i'm
[1:01:51] i'm
[1:01:52] pressing forward i'm trying to get a
[1:01:53] hold of what's got a hold of me
[1:02:01] watch this
[1:02:05] hebrews chapter 5 starting at verse 1.
[1:02:13] it says for every high priest taken from
[1:02:16] among men
[1:02:17] is ordained for me so meaning they're
[1:02:20] they're taken out from men to be
[1:02:22] servants to me
[1:02:24] all right it says in things pertaining
[1:02:27] to god
[1:02:28] that he may offer both gifts and
[1:02:31] sacrifices for sins but watch how god
[1:02:33] narrows this down
[1:02:35] it says who can have compassion notice
[1:02:38] this now
[1:02:39] because we're taught when we're talking
[1:02:41] about having compassion for somebody
[1:02:43] there's a certain element that god must
[1:02:45] that
[1:02:46] must be established in your heart a
[1:02:48] certain aspect in view of yourself
[1:02:50] that god must have there in order for
[1:02:53] you to really be able to have an
[1:02:54] effective prayer for someone else
[1:02:56] watch it says who can have compassion on
[1:02:59] the ignorant
[1:03:00] and on them that are out of the way for
[1:03:03] that he
[1:03:04] himself also is confessed with
[1:03:08] infirmity
[1:03:11] so the reason why he should be able to
[1:03:13] have compassion
[1:03:15] is because he should be able to realize
[1:03:17] hey i need help myself
[1:03:23] i love how god operates man he has
[1:03:26] balanced this thing perfectly
[1:03:31] that's why with the true ministry of god
[1:03:33] they don't preach at the people
[1:03:36] they realize i'm in this with you we all
[1:03:39] need the grace of god we all need the
[1:03:41] help of god we all need healing
[1:03:45] but if he's blind it'll always be
[1:03:49] preaching at the people you people need
[1:03:51] to get right you need to do this you
[1:03:53] need to do that
[1:03:54] never including himself never confessing
[1:03:57] where he
[1:03:58] is
[1:04:04] in verse 3 it says this and by reason
[1:04:07] hereof what reason he sees that he's
[1:04:11] also accomplished about with infirmity
[1:04:14] and by reason hereof he art asks for the
[1:04:18] people
[1:04:18] so also for himself
[1:04:22] to offer for sins so this is what the
[1:04:26] priesthood
[1:04:28] this is the mind they should have
[1:04:31] those that were called to be servants of
[1:04:33] god and here this man was claiming to be
[1:04:36] a servant
[1:04:36] but yet he was forgetful
[1:04:41] somehow that religious spirit had a hold
[1:04:44] on
[1:04:45] and he didn't even realize that he was
[1:04:47] being controlled by something different
[1:04:49] by an enemy of god can we say praise the
[1:04:53] lord sayings
[1:04:55] watch this now
[1:05:00] okay there was a scripture here that i
[1:05:01] came across this morning i wanted to
[1:05:03] make sure i shared with you guys because
[1:05:05] it was such a blessing to me
[1:05:08] it's bad with me for one moment here
[1:05:14] well actually i'ma touch on this
[1:05:16] scripture first galatians chapter six
[1:05:20] galatians six we're not going to keep
[1:05:21] you much longer
[1:05:23] galatians 6 starting at verse 1. now
[1:05:26] keeping in mind what we just read about
[1:05:28] the requirement of the high priest as
[1:05:30] far as god's requirement where god
[1:05:32] wanted that high priest's mind to be
[1:05:35] now that's not just for the high priest
[1:05:38] when you come over into the new
[1:05:39] testament that same requirement is
[1:05:41] translated down to the laity
[1:05:43] amen i'm talking about effective prayer
[1:05:47] yes sir yes i'm talking about if you're
[1:05:49] not able to be able to see yourself
[1:05:51] and realize the help you need of god if
[1:05:53] somehow you're blinded to that
[1:05:54] you will never be able to pray for
[1:05:56] somebody in it and get and get the real
[1:05:58] results
[1:06:02] that it could bring if you were in the
[1:06:04] right heart and mind frame
[1:06:07] galatians 6 verse 1 says brethren if a
[1:06:09] man be overtaken in a fault
[1:06:12] ye which are spiritual
[1:06:17] that's more than just this funny
[1:06:19] spiritual thing you know
[1:06:22] looking for stuff seeing little lights
[1:06:23] flashing and all kind of stuff like that
[1:06:26] it's just god being present in your life
[1:06:29] you being yielded and god is there he
[1:06:31] can just move
[1:06:32] through you you've died to a point to
[1:06:34] where he can just move through you at
[1:06:36] will
[1:06:39] that's how christ was right isn't that
[1:06:42] right
[1:06:43] now when he said the works that i do
[1:06:45] shall ye do also
[1:06:47] that's included
[1:06:50] being in the same condition the same
[1:06:52] state the same relationship
[1:06:56] having the same fullness of love
[1:07:00] i do nothing except my father showed me
[1:07:02] first did not god give us an example of
[1:07:04] that in this hour
[1:07:06] that's what the success of the prophet's
[1:07:08] ministry was all about
[1:07:10] he was able to die he was able to get
[1:07:12] out of god's way
[1:07:15] he now we're not trying to say we want
[1:07:17] to be like a prophet but at the same
[1:07:18] time we're within that same caliber
[1:07:22] we will call me he's our brother what we
[1:07:25] see god doing in him to a certain degree
[1:07:27] he's here to do it in us that's his
[1:07:29] desire
[1:07:31] watch this if a man be overtaken in a
[1:07:35] fault which
[1:07:36] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[1:07:39] one
[1:07:39] watch this is god is emphasizing this by
[1:07:42] the holy ghost in the new testament
[1:07:44] he says restore such a one in the spirit
[1:07:47] of
[1:07:48] meekness how considering
[1:07:52] thyself yes
[1:07:55] oh i heard so and so and so and so
[1:07:58] fell off and seeing they're backsliding
[1:08:00] or whatever okay okay well
[1:08:02] okay first of all where is your words
[1:08:03] coming from are you speaking are you
[1:08:05] speaking about the situation in the
[1:08:07] right spirit
[1:08:10] you understand because this matters it
[1:08:13] matters to god
[1:08:14] god is listening god pays attention to
[1:08:16] these things because he said here
[1:08:18] if you see a brother's overcoming a
[1:08:20] fault he said we're supposed to go to
[1:08:21] that individual in
[1:08:23] meekness considering yourself not
[1:08:26] thinking about somebody
[1:08:27] else allowing somebody else's thought to
[1:08:31] be magnified in your mind know you
[1:08:33] look at your own sin right now so that
[1:08:36] when you go
[1:08:36] you'll be able to go in the right mind
[1:08:39] not in a condemning spirit or
[1:08:41] i'm higher than your spirit but you're
[1:08:43] right down on their level
[1:08:44] you're coming to help you're coming to
[1:08:46] alleviate
[1:08:48] because you care from the heart you want
[1:08:52] to see them restored
[1:08:55] amen amen sayings he says
[1:08:59] praise god considering thyself lest thou
[1:09:02] also be tempted so when you go to
[1:09:04] somebody else in the wrong spirit you
[1:09:06] know what god will do sometimes
[1:09:08] god will let you fall flat on your face
[1:09:12] he'll let some overpower you and take
[1:09:14] you
[1:09:16] and while you're in that state bring me
[1:09:18] your remembrance look at this situation
[1:09:20] here
[1:09:20] now you see how you should have went to
[1:09:22] that person because now you see yourself
[1:09:24] need help
[1:09:26] you need somebody to pray for you now
[1:09:28] you think how do you want somebody to
[1:09:29] come to you
[1:09:35] you understand yes
[1:09:38] man god is perfect in all of his ways
[1:09:42] praise god hallelujah he says bear ye
[1:09:45] one another's burdens
[1:09:47] and so fulfill the law of christ
[1:09:50] for if a man think himself to be
[1:09:52] something when he is nothing
[1:09:54] he deceiveth himself was simon deceived
[1:09:59] when he was sitting there judging that
[1:10:01] woman in his heart
[1:10:03] if he knew if he was a prophet he would
[1:10:05] know what manner of a woman that was he
[1:10:06] deceived according to the scripture
[1:10:09] yes he was he was quite deceived
[1:10:12] amen didn't even realize it though
[1:10:15] all right that deception is something
[1:10:17] else
[1:10:18] eve didn't know she had become deceived
[1:10:22] she just thought it was the continuing
[1:10:23] of a thought i don't know
[1:10:26] but the lord knows but you understand
[1:10:28] you see it
[1:10:30] so now let's touch upon these few other
[1:10:32] scriptures here
[1:10:36] all right
[1:10:42] in proverbs chapter 24.
[1:10:45] we're going to go to verse 17.
[1:10:50] proverbs 24 and verse 17 it says
[1:10:54] rejoice not when thine enemy falleth
[1:10:57] and let not thine heart be glad when he
[1:11:00] stumbleth
[1:11:08] read that again amen rejoice not when
[1:11:11] thine enemy falleth
[1:11:13] and let not let not thine heart be glad
[1:11:15] when he's stumbling
[1:11:18] so notice in this situation that god is
[1:11:20] bringing out right here
[1:11:23] you have somebody that has done you
[1:11:24] wrong
[1:11:26] and remember you reap what you sow so
[1:11:29] god has seen that this person has
[1:11:31] mishandled my son or my daughter
[1:11:34] so guess what repayment comes from god
[1:11:39] and now god is allowing a situation to
[1:11:41] come upon this person
[1:11:43] but now as you're watching and you're
[1:11:46] god is saying now
[1:11:47] when i begin to deal with this person
[1:11:49] based off of
[1:11:51] something that they've done wrong and
[1:11:53] you see me dealing with this person be
[1:11:55] careful how you allow yourself to think
[1:11:58] about this situation
[1:12:01] because if you begin somehow to have
[1:12:03] some sort of an enjoyment
[1:12:05] because you see somebody else going
[1:12:07] through something that you might feel
[1:12:09] deserves it
[1:12:11] notice what he says here now amen
[1:12:15] rejoice not when not an enemy falleth
[1:12:17] and let not thine heart be glad when he
[1:12:18] stumbled up
[1:12:19] lest the lord see it see what see your
[1:12:22] frame of mind
[1:12:24] see you rejoicing or somehow getting
[1:12:26] enjoyment out of seeing somebody else go
[1:12:28] through hardships
[1:12:30] regardless of what kind of person it is
[1:12:32] regardless of what they've done
[1:12:35] amen praise god he says let the lord see
[1:12:39] it and it displeases him
[1:12:42] and he turn away his wrath from him
[1:12:46] now from there i want to go to zechariah
[1:12:48] chapter seven
[1:12:51] because i believe these go in continuity
[1:12:53] they kind of go parallel one to the
[1:12:55] other
[1:12:56] zechariah chapter seven and it says here
[1:13:00] starting at verse eight
[1:13:01] of zechariah chapter 7
[1:13:05] it says in the word of the lord came
[1:13:06] unto zechariah saying
[1:13:09] thus speak of the lord of hosts saying
[1:13:11] execute true judgment
[1:13:13] and show mercy and compassion he says
[1:13:16] to every man of every man to his brother
[1:13:20] it says and oppress not the widow nor
[1:13:22] fatherless the stranger
[1:13:24] the stranger nor the poor and let none
[1:13:26] of you imagine evil against his brother
[1:13:29] in your heart
[1:13:32] this is old testament teaching
[1:13:36] you see how god expresses himself in the
[1:13:38] old testament you see the mind
[1:13:40] he wants us to have toward one another
[1:13:44] or toward anybody for that fact
[1:13:48] i love this saints because so often
[1:13:51] especially in this time here science
[1:13:52] people are becoming offended all over
[1:13:54] the place
[1:13:56] and they're becoming uncareful and very
[1:13:58] loose with how they speak about their
[1:14:00] brothers or senses or whatever the case
[1:14:01] might be
[1:14:03] and the bible says it displeases god
[1:14:07] even if you feel like a person deserves
[1:14:09] that god is saying remember yourself
[1:14:11] if it wasn't for my grace that could be
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:17] god knows what's going on but hey man
[1:14:20] he's calling
[1:14:21] he he has a high requirement for his
[1:14:23] bride see we we have a higher calling
[1:14:26] hey man we're called to royalty we're
[1:14:28] called to be just like him
[1:14:30] he called us brethren amen
[1:14:35] you understand that this is more than
[1:14:37] just
[1:14:38] like i said seeking gifts and power and
[1:14:41] stuff like that i'm talking about
[1:14:42] character
[1:14:44] the character of god that comes from the
[1:14:46] heart of god in the mind of god
[1:14:48] that comes inside of the individual at
[1:14:51] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:53] and all the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:14:55] is god bringing to life was already in
[1:14:57] you
[1:14:59] can we say amen to that the life of god
[1:15:02] was already in you the whole time
[1:15:05] it was just encapsulated
[1:15:08] amen the same life that's in the seed is
[1:15:11] the same life with the holy ghost
[1:15:13] that's why the prophet said god came
[1:15:17] the word came to the word that was in
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:20] you're the word already you were the
[1:15:23] word when you were born
[1:15:24] how many believe that
[1:15:28] amen this is powerful saints
[1:15:32] all right so now let me
[1:15:35] just touch upon a few things here for
[1:15:37] you
[1:15:39] notice how brother branham speaks of
[1:15:40] this
[1:15:43] this particular message here is called
[1:15:45] uh
[1:15:47] god projecting his love right
[1:15:57] brother branham prayed for many people
[1:15:59] yes
[1:16:02] but the level of success
[1:16:06] that came out of all those prayer lines
[1:16:08] was wrapped up into what i'm talking
[1:16:10] about right now
[1:16:12] it testified of his relationship with
[1:16:14] god
[1:16:15] it testified of his new birth
[1:16:18] amen it testified of his glooming and
[1:16:21] his molding of the hands of god by the
[1:16:23] holy ghost
[1:16:25] amen and it just brought him to a place
[1:16:30] to where he had become so surrendered
[1:16:32] and so yielded
[1:16:34] that god which is able to have great
[1:16:36] that's why that's the only reason why he
[1:16:38] was able to say
[1:16:39] that christ had more success in his
[1:16:41] ministry
[1:16:42] than he did in his own he made sure he
[1:16:46] was careful in saying that it was christ
[1:16:48] that had more success not him amen
[1:16:51] because he knew he couldn't do nothing
[1:16:53] isn't that right but he said christ had
[1:16:56] more success in his
[1:16:57] own in in his ministry brother than he
[1:16:59] did in his own many
[1:17:00] between the two christ did more but it
[1:17:03] was christ in both cases
[1:17:05] had nothing to do with brother branham
[1:17:07] we understand
[1:17:09] notice what he says here now god
[1:17:11] projecting his love
[1:17:12] the message is from 1957 august the 6th
[1:17:17] right he says and i thought after all
[1:17:20] that
[1:17:21] and then nature now he's talking about
[1:17:23] this old blind man that was from mexico
[1:17:26] i believe it was
[1:17:28] he didn't even know the man but god knew
[1:17:30] the man
[1:17:33] so when that man came see brother
[1:17:35] branham was yielded to the holy ghost
[1:17:37] now god had full control so now god
[1:17:40] stops was being expressed and he can
[1:17:42] feel god's heart
[1:17:44] so this this just wasn't brother branham
[1:17:46] in a human compassion like that
[1:17:49] watch this now that's very important you
[1:17:51] understand that
[1:17:52] you understand what i just said it was
[1:17:55] brother branham under the full
[1:17:57] leadership of the holy ghost god stalks
[1:17:59] his heart
[1:18:00] everything now he was sensitive to that
[1:18:02] and god was just expressing himself
[1:18:04] through that prophet
[1:18:05] amen and i thought after all that
[1:18:10] and then nature the devil has given him
[1:18:13] has given him
[1:18:14] evil to blind his poor old blinded eyes
[1:18:19] how cruel it was to him and i began to
[1:18:22] enter into
[1:18:23] something listen very carefully
[1:18:26] i began to enter into something i can't
[1:18:29] express it
[1:18:30] it was a love of sympathy
[1:18:35] amen remember now what does sympathy
[1:18:38] mean
[1:18:40] for the kids praise the lord sympathy
[1:18:43] means a feeling of pity or sorrow for
[1:18:46] someone else's misfortune
[1:18:48] and again compassion means sympathetic
[1:18:51] awareness
[1:18:52] of others distressed together with a
[1:18:55] desire
[1:18:56] to alleviate it to make them go free
[1:19:00] from it
[1:19:01] right so then brother branham he's
[1:19:04] speaking about something that listens
[1:19:05] saints was out of his control
[1:19:08] this wasn't anything that he could just
[1:19:10] bring himself into
[1:19:13] he found himself entering into this
[1:19:15] place watch
[1:19:17] and i began to enter into something i
[1:19:19] can't express it
[1:19:21] it was a love of sympathy and as the old
[1:19:25] fellow come
[1:19:26] and laid his head over on my shoulder
[1:19:29] and i hugged that old ragged coat
[1:19:32] i said merciful god help help his poor
[1:19:36] old blinded that this poor blinded daddy
[1:19:39] if my dad would have lived he'd have
[1:19:42] been
[1:19:43] my about that age will you help him
[1:19:47] but look at what he entered into first
[1:19:51] look something pulled him into this
[1:19:53] place see what i'm saying
[1:19:55] it ain't something you can do right i'm
[1:19:58] preaching it but this
[1:19:59] this lets us know we got to dig deeper
[1:20:02] we got to pray more we got to die
[1:20:04] more we got to labor for god
[1:20:07] so that we can become saturated with his
[1:20:10] spirit
[1:20:11] he can just do whatever he wills we
[1:20:14] don't know
[1:20:14] what he want to do on any given day on
[1:20:16] any given occasion
[1:20:18] or we just want to be in a place and a
[1:20:19] state
[1:20:21] he can just flow
[1:20:28] praise god
[1:20:34] and i heard him holler with that simple
[1:20:36] prayer
[1:20:38] he wasn't
[1:20:42] that don't get no results like that
[1:20:44] cause you make a lot of noise
[1:20:46] and all these sounds and all
[1:20:50] right this brother was just standing
[1:20:52] there
[1:20:54] and because of his love for god and his
[1:20:56] relationship with god
[1:20:57] and his care for god's people
[1:21:00] something just took over amen
[1:21:05] that's it and i heard him hollering
[1:21:08] with that effect of prayer he said
[1:21:10] gloria adios
[1:21:12] or deals i don't know spanish son
[1:21:15] it says and the man could see as good as
[1:21:18] i could
[1:21:19] the people began screaming everywhere
[1:21:22] what was it
[1:21:23] it was entering into that fellowship of
[1:21:26] his suffering
[1:21:27] in his blindness he said you must
[1:21:31] do it
[1:21:35] if ever i had a time of success of
[1:21:37] praying for anyone
[1:21:39] is when i could enter into the
[1:21:41] fellowship with them
[1:21:43] feel their infirmities you see the
[1:21:45] disconnect with simon and
[1:21:47] and mary he wasn't able to feel for
[1:21:53] he was in another place a dark place
[1:21:56] and he didn't realize it if ever i had a
[1:21:59] time of success of praying for someone
[1:22:02] is when i could enter into the
[1:22:03] fellowship with them
[1:22:05] feel their infirmities feel their
[1:22:08] conditions amen
[1:22:11] he says then something in you goes down
[1:22:13] beyond
[1:22:14] reasoning and prays the prayer of faith
[1:22:16] for the sick now he brings in the
[1:22:18] scripture
[1:22:19] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:22:22] isn't that right
[1:22:23] praying according to your most holy face
[1:22:25] in the holy ghost
[1:22:27] you see it that ain't nothing you can
[1:22:30] just do
[1:22:32] but it's something that just brings you
[1:22:33] into that place
[1:22:36] he says you've got to feel for a man
[1:22:39] you've got to
[1:22:40] you've got to sympathize with him
[1:22:43] you've got to be with him before you can
[1:22:46] help him
[1:22:47] amen i'm stopping after i read this
[1:22:51] because y'all
[1:22:52] get the point it's been plain he says
[1:22:54] then you enter into some sort of a
[1:22:56] deepness it's the love of god it's
[1:22:59] beyond human love
[1:23:07] let me read one more
[1:23:10] it's a little nugget i believe ricky but
[1:23:13] i believe you understand
[1:23:15] by the grace of god this message here is
[1:23:19] demonology
[1:23:21] brother branham says this is 1953.
[1:23:26] uh this is june the 9th
[1:23:30] he says i thought oh god now this is
[1:23:32] this is me and brother jesse was talking
[1:23:34] about this briefly the other night
[1:23:38] he was having services the lord was
[1:23:40] using him
[1:23:42] that's why i say we're not exempt
[1:23:46] then he was able to come out and then go
[1:23:50] over to this cafe
[1:23:53] and as soon as he walked into this cafe
[1:23:55] listen to this very carefully
[1:23:59] as soon as he walked into this cafe
[1:24:01] saints
[1:24:03] he took on the same mind of simon
[1:24:09] you understand that yes yes he took on
[1:24:12] the same that means an evil spirit
[1:24:14] clouded the prophet's mind
[1:24:16] yes and i thought oh god look at how
[1:24:20] look at how now his his language is
[1:24:23] under the anointing of a wrong spirit
[1:24:25] that's not
[1:24:25] some other prophet that had the holy
[1:24:28] ghost we're not exempt
[1:24:33] i thought oh god god why don't you just
[1:24:35] wipe the thing off the map who was he
[1:24:37] talking about
[1:24:38] he was talking about an elderly woman
[1:24:41] that was in the life of sin
[1:24:43] two younger men were by her immorally
[1:24:47] a cop was at the slot machine
[1:24:51] and in that instance in that moment
[1:24:53] their lives meant no more to him than a
[1:24:55] roach crawling on the ground
[1:24:59] because he said god why don't you just
[1:25:03] wipe the thing off the thing
[1:25:07] wipe the thing off the map why don't you
[1:25:12] does does my little sharon my little
[1:25:15] baby my little sarah my little rebecca
[1:25:17] have to be raised up
[1:25:18] in that generation to come to face with
[1:25:21] such stuff
[1:25:22] as that
[1:25:26] i thought look out here in these parks
[1:25:28] and things and what goes on
[1:25:30] i thought oh god my i'm glad
[1:25:34] you took sharon if it if it was your
[1:25:36] will
[1:25:37] does my little rebecca my little sarah
[1:25:39] have to be raised up under such
[1:25:41] stuff like that which which he says
[1:25:44] which and them
[1:25:45] people call seeing in the choir and
[1:25:47] everything
[1:25:48] it says and i thought isn't that a shame
[1:25:51] i thought god how can your holy
[1:25:53] righteousness
[1:25:54] stand it
[1:25:57] speaking about people bound
[1:26:00] look at where his mind was saints how
[1:26:03] can your holy righteousness stand it
[1:26:05] look like that your righteous
[1:26:07] indignation would fly out there
[1:26:09] and blow this place up
[1:26:14] simon didn't even talk about the woman
[1:26:16] like that
[1:26:21] but notice god listening to his prophet
[1:26:24] that was still his son
[1:26:25] that didn't make him any less of a
[1:26:27] prophet right right
[1:26:29] just because you get caught up in a
[1:26:31] wrong spirit sometimes
[1:26:33] that don't make you any less of a son or
[1:26:34] daughter of god
[1:26:39] but because he loved him and he realized
[1:26:41] that my son has gotten caught up in a
[1:26:43] wrong spirit let me go down and help him
[1:26:45] out
[1:26:47] he says and i heard the angel of the
[1:26:49] lord say come aside
[1:26:54] you sitting there thinking like that
[1:26:56] yeah hold on for a second
[1:26:58] you don't got beside yourself son you
[1:27:00] know how it is with parents we got to
[1:27:02] deal with our children so
[1:27:04] hold on now why are you talking i can
[1:27:06] hear my kids in the other
[1:27:07] in the other room having a conversation
[1:27:09] and a tone and that just bothers me
[1:27:12] i gotta say hold on now i want y'all
[1:27:13] talking to one another like that
[1:27:15] change your tone i wanna hear some
[1:27:17] sweetness i wanna hear some love
[1:27:20] i tell them that all this fustering and
[1:27:23] digging well
[1:27:24] no no no no no i don't thank god like
[1:27:26] that i don't like that
[1:27:29] he says come aside i walked over there
[1:27:32] and when i got
[1:27:33] looked when he got through with me i
[1:27:36] felt like a different person
[1:27:38] he says what are you condemning her for
[1:27:42] i said i said look at that the way she
[1:27:44] is and here and here's what he
[1:27:47] he says and then i thought yes that's
[1:27:48] right and i seen one day because now god
[1:27:51] began to correct him he says now
[1:27:53] why are you acting like that why are you
[1:27:55] condemning her like that
[1:27:58] and the way god corrected his prophet
[1:28:00] remember that we read in the old
[1:28:01] testament
[1:28:02] where the priest can only be an
[1:28:04] effective priest to do his role
[1:28:06] right to please god if he realizes first
[1:28:09] that he has his own infirmities that
[1:28:11] he's confidence with
[1:28:13] encompass with this isn't that right
[1:28:15] because then he can realize in his mind
[1:28:17] okay
[1:28:17] i need help too brother branham he had
[1:28:21] become blind to that for that moment and
[1:28:23] so god came to begin to deal with him
[1:28:25] and the way that he corrected his
[1:28:26] prophet
[1:28:28] was by showing him his own sin
[1:28:32] and then i thought yes that's right and
[1:28:34] i seen one day i crawled up to him
[1:28:37] i seen my old book laying there a sinner
[1:28:40] there laid everything on it i see my
[1:28:43] sins is what was doing it
[1:28:45] i said because remember in the vision he
[1:28:47] saw christ and he saw his head being
[1:28:49] jawed
[1:28:50] and he saw blood shooting off amen
[1:28:54] and while that was happening christ was
[1:28:56] asking for forgiveness for him
[1:29:01] so he says why are you condemning her
[1:29:04] why are you acting like that
[1:29:06] that's not my mind that's not my heart
[1:29:11] and i seen one day i crawled up to him
[1:29:13] and i seen my own my old book
[1:29:15] laying there at center there laid
[1:29:17] everything on and i seen my sins as what
[1:29:20] was doing and i said lord will you
[1:29:21] forgive me
[1:29:23] he took his hand in his side and got
[1:29:25] some blood out
[1:29:26] rode across it at the top and said
[1:29:28] pardon
[1:29:29] throwed it back in the sea of
[1:29:31] forgetfulness and remember and
[1:29:32] remembered it no more
[1:29:34] it was gone forever he said i forgive
[1:29:37] you but you are condemning her
[1:29:43] he says that changed my idea i said lord
[1:29:46] have mercy
[1:29:48] you see how god changed now how
[1:29:52] he showed him himself
[1:29:56] and you know what happened after that
[1:29:57] saints he went over there
[1:30:01] and the atmosphere was totally different
[1:30:03] now he was coming with an atmosphere of
[1:30:05] love
[1:30:06] now that woman began to realize she was
[1:30:08] in the presence of god
[1:30:10] and she began to pour out her heart
[1:30:12] concerning her story
[1:30:15] now he was able to enter into a
[1:30:16] compassion and have a sympathy
[1:30:19] and they shook that place in prayer
[1:30:23] he ended up saying that was a daughter
[1:30:25] of god
[1:30:31] you understand you see how important
[1:30:35] this is to god
[1:30:39] so god is working with us saints he's
[1:30:41] bringing every one of us into this place
[1:30:43] because he wants us to be just like him
[1:30:45] it's within us that's our father so it's
[1:30:48] within us all ready to grow up to be
[1:30:50] just like him
[1:30:51] not just in the demonstration of power
[1:30:53] and miracles
[1:30:55] but in a demonstration of his life and
[1:30:57] his character
[1:30:58] we talk about adoption this is what
[1:31:00] everything is wrapped up in
[1:31:02] this is why it doesn't matter if you're
[1:31:04] a minister or a housewife
[1:31:07] it's you being in your position in
[1:31:08] christ the way he can just have his way
[1:31:11] that his person can be freely expressed
[1:31:13] that's that's that's the whole thing
[1:31:15] that's the seals and everything
[1:31:18] in simplicity it's the thunder that
[1:31:21] shakes the devil what is that
[1:31:23] it's christ walking in flesh
[1:31:29] i thank god for your patience and for
[1:31:32] your time this morning
[1:31:35] i believe it was the will of god for me
[1:31:37] to
[1:31:38] share this particular thought
[1:31:42] i pray god help each one of us
[1:31:46] because i'm preaching it but i need help
[1:31:51] hey man i want to be able to see people
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:56] at all times i i don't want my own way i
[1:31:58] don't want my own mind
[1:32:00] i really don't regardless of how people
[1:32:03] treat me and handle me
[1:32:05] lord help me in my heart to satisfy your
[1:32:08] desire and your will
[1:32:11] regardless that's real growth
[1:32:16] that's what it's all about and he's
[1:32:18] doing it
[1:32:20] he's doing it so god bless each one of
[1:32:22] you don't be discouraged in any kind of
[1:32:25] a way
[1:32:26] amen because he has sympathy
[1:32:29] amen he's here to deal with his uh deal
[1:32:32] with us in our issues but
[1:32:34] free us from it as well

[1:50:05] sister wendy has decided to change
[1:50:08] churches and she's going to be going to
[1:50:11] bible believers
[1:50:12] in lima she goes there during the
[1:50:15] midweek is that correct
[1:50:16] so that's like the midweek service or
[1:50:18] church rather
[1:50:19] she goes to and that was her former
[1:50:21] church actually right
[1:50:23] um so she's been making this decision
[1:50:25] over the last few months or so
[1:50:28] and uh so by god's grace you know when
[1:50:31] people leave we'd like to
[1:50:33] greet them when they leave and i wish
[1:50:35] them god's best upon them
[1:50:38] and we're so thankful for sister wendy i
[1:50:40] looked it up you know on my phone
[1:50:41] a few minutes ago sister it's 193 miles
[1:50:45] from here
[1:50:45] to her house just 193.
[1:50:51] i'm just joking just it's a lot so
[1:50:53] that's just one way
[1:50:56] so you know our sister's been with us 10
[1:50:57] years and uh it's been a
[1:51:01] i can't even count the number of miles
[1:51:04] there
[1:51:06] could guess uh but we appreciate the
[1:51:08] sacrifice our sisters made and
[1:51:11] the love she's shown to us i think how
[1:51:12] many times you know she's giving us a
[1:51:14] birthday gift or
[1:51:16] you know something her sister has such a
[1:51:18] generous heart
[1:51:20] and so we're so grateful for that our
[1:51:23] church has been greatly supported by
[1:51:24] sister wendy
[1:51:26] um so from that we're
[1:51:29] eternally grateful we're eternally
[1:51:31] grateful by god's grace
[1:51:33] and uh you know sister wendy and i've
[1:51:35] recently talked a little bit sent me an
[1:51:36] email and we talked a little bit today
[1:51:38] and
[1:51:39] um she feels a burden uh to
[1:51:42] to do certain things in her life and
[1:51:44] that can be accomplished by going to
[1:51:46] that church
[1:51:47] so as with always with all of us we want
[1:51:51] to find the perfect will of god
[1:51:53] and we're happy that our sister believes
[1:51:56] you know she's
[1:51:57] going into the perfect will of god and
[1:51:59] we want to support her in that
[1:52:00] and ask the lord to bless her in that
[1:52:05] and we can just rejoice in the time that
[1:52:07] we've had with her by god's grace
[1:52:09] we will do that we'll certainly do that
[1:52:12] and rejoice
[1:52:13] you know god has blessed us with our
[1:52:16] sister
[1:52:17] so we're so grateful um and uh
[1:52:21] it's just you know it's just a hard
[1:52:23] thing you know when
[1:52:24] people leave but we do it with god's
[1:52:27] love and we know god is
[1:52:28] uh going to lead her and bless her
