by God's grace uh I'll just go to the scripture here and we'll just read it up you know for those mothers that don't have it or have their Bibles handy let's go to Matthew 5 by God's grace there we go there's technology for you let's try Matthew 11 here well we'll just keep it up here we'll just read out of our regular Bibles but so sorry mothers there something always goes wrong with technology Matthew 5 praise God how many appreciate the Beatitudes from the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we saw a great um introduction from the Holy Spirit on Sunday morning praise God and we'll look we'll try to finish that tonight by the grace of the Lord now let's start we got through the pure in heart so let's go go to number nine verse 9 rather Matthew 59 I'm going to do a brief review of the other ones you know I have some different scriptures that I studied it more this week I came across some different scriptures so we're definitely going to just do a quick review of the other ones how many want to be blessed and happy praise God Amen bless means the state of bliss the Beatitudes are the states of bliss that we can live in praise God the states of Happiness amen amen and church i' this week I was able to show some mercy to different individuals and I felt so good while doing it so how many know it's a reality praise God these are realities when you live in these things it's a reality praise God verse n you there say amen amen let's read nine and 10 together ready one two three blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven now I'll read 11 and 12 bless blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you so Christ puts us any anyone who's persecuted Christ puts them on the same reward as a prophet praise the Lord anyone that would suffer persecution God doesn't you know give different rewards it's all based upon Faith praise the Lord he doesn't as not a respector of persons amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer have need on your heart just make a note unto God let's just pray Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you for amazing love amazing grace and mercy dear Lord father thank you for the songs that have been sung in your time Lord you make all things Beautiful Lord God we believe that song is a scriptural promise out of a Ecclesiastes Lord and Lord as we sang as we came to the pulpit we hail you Lord we respect you we honor you we worship you tonight we admonish you we look to you we focus on you tonight oh King oh God Emmanuel oh Lord who came down in flesh God With Us and Lord now it's Holy Ghost Christ in US Lord so we thank you oh God for coming so close to us Lord that you even live in US father help us this evening as we look at Beatitudes to see exactly why it was so important Lord why uh why you took the time to preach these things on the earth 2,000 years ago and yet Lord if if people would just live one of these out of these 10 just live one of them what a blessedness they would what a peace they would have that past all understanding Lord God so we thank you that we can live in these Lord and we just pray You' help us to manifest these in our lives Lord Through Your Grace lead us into Lord the character that would manifest these types of uh States Lord these types of conditions Lord and we know you do it because we ask and you said if you ask anything in my name I'll do it so Lord have your way have free course in our lives do it Lord in our lives tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you being seated praise God that was not going to cooperate let's just go right to the uh slides here tonight um so we want to look at again the Beatitudes by God's grace and uh remember this is the state of uh being having Bliss the state of having complete happiness praise God and we have it tonight in Christ Jesus any man or woman that's in Christ Jesus ought to have the Beatitudes in their lives they would by God's grace just like anyone who's baptized with the Holy Ghost has put on the full armor of God and they're a soldier on the front lines for Jesus Christ amen front line in their home front line in their family front line in the church front line in the job wherever they go they're on the front lines for Christ Jesus they're fighting for Christ amen so our text you know we we didn't read all that text but that is of course the the the uh recognized text of the Beatitudes so let's just quickly re review here by God's grace before we get into uh some of these other texts here tonight uh by God's grace the rest of the Beatitudes so we looked at on the first blessed are the poor in spirit now the poor in spirit inherit the kingdom of God Amen theirs is the kingdom of God it belongs to them so God is going to give uh the Kingdom of Heaven to those who are destitute or poor of the wealth of learning and education of schools God's gonna give the kingdom to those who aren't trained by man's Wisdom but by God's wisdom because it is the foolishness of preaching to save them that would believe amen it's foolishness now uh these scriptures are familiar to us I mentioned this John 7:15 we're not going to read these but the Bible said they looked at Jesus and said when has Jesus learned any letters God bless you Brothers uh when is when did Jesus go to school and learn any Hebrew uh they kind of rebuked him and Jesus just shook it off and that's what any Christian does any criticism they just shake it off now if it's real criticism and they need a rebuke the Christian appreciates that because the Bible said A wise man will love you if you rebuke him amen praise the Lord but Jesus was being unjustly criticized for not having going gone to school so it was just like water off a duck's back he just shook it off and he lived above the criticism that was on his life praise God brother Brandon when he preaches on the poor in spirit he mentions uh Mary out of Luke 148 let's read that by God's grace let's go to Luke 148 let's read that by the grace of the Lord and we'll see how Mary brother Ram said she was poor in spirit she was not a a wealthy woman in any in any stretch of the imagination uh she was just a a poor virgin girl we'd say a common Israelite girl and here's her own testimony I like I like and now notice the spirit is just anointed her praise the Lord and look at verse 46 Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord amen and my spirit have rejoiced in God my savior verse 48 for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed so when the angel came to her and told her about the promise of God she started magnifying God she started rejoicing in God and she started thanking him for looking to her lowest State and if God has revealed anything to us we ought to thank him we ought to Magnify Him Praise the Lord anything at all now look she she manifested Christ uh In the Flesh she manifested the word in flesh we manifest the word in the spirit praise God Amen she birthed the natural word but we ought to birth the spiritual word praise God now don't get me wrong in the day of Pentecost she birthed the spiritual word as well she birthed both amen she had a birth of both the natural word and the spiritual word amen and her soul magnify God she rejoiced because she had a Sav amen and that's the promise that we have today so brother BR said she was the poor in spirit so hers would be the kingdom of God Amen you remember brother Bram had an interview with a newspaper reporter as a woman who was Catholic and she was uh reporting an evil report against brother R's Revival meetings and she was trying to criticize the shouting and the screaming and the crying some of you might remember the story and uh she said uh she said that's just a bunch of fanaticism and uh and brother Bram said no those people that are shouting and rejoicing he said will rule in heaven so she said if those kind of people that are screaming and making noise and praising God if they're going to rule in heaven I don't want to go brother BR said don't worry you won't go with that kind of attitude praise God and he said what's that little uh what's that little uh what do they call the Mary's prayer beads what do they call those Rosary he said what's that Rosary you got around your neck he said I'm cath she said I'm a Catholic I pray to Mary and he said let me tell you the very one you pray to she in order for her to go to heaven she had to get drunk in the spirit speak in tongues and praise God Amen before God would let her in heaven and he said you won't get into heaven unless you come the same way and brother said neither will we unless we come the same way Hallelujah by the baptism of the Holy Ghost a moment of birth a moment of freedom and worship and surrender and your life afterwards proves that you got the goods amen amen proves that you've got the Life of Christ amen uh Luke 16:23 I'm just going to read that because I don't remember that from my study so just bear with me I know I'm reviewing a little bit the blessed are the poor in spirit oh and this is the other one yeah this other one brother B reads he talks about the poor man Lazarus not the one that was raised from the dead but the poor man who had sores and begged and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham AAR off from Lazareth in his bosom brother Bram said the uh the the Lazarus was poor in spirit uh and look what happened to him although he was poor physically although he was poor and didn't have the riches like the the rich man he inherited eternal life praise God the kingdom belonged to him because he was poor in spirit now look now look at this church now make sure you catch this the right way but listen didn't the Bible say my seed will never beg bread how many know that right but wasn't Lazarus asking for crumbs that fell from the master's table and wasn't he saved praise the Lord didn't the Bible say if you honor God you live a long life upon the Earth but yet sometimes those that honor God God takes them early so what do we saying we saying that sometimes God has to let things happen in order to have a witness on the earth sometimes God uh does things a little different those promises are still true they're still true but what we have to see is that God sometimes does things a little out of the ordinary to try to get people's attention are you with me and he allows them to go through trials in this case to beg a little crumb to see if he wouldn't uh if Satan wouldn't try to discourage his faith you understand God allowed the trial to come praise the Lord amen Jesus died at 33 did anybody ever live a more pure life than Christ he didn't even get the 70 years that was promised in the Bible three score and 10 how many know the scripture in Psalms that was giv us three score and 10 he didn't even get half of that right but yet he lived the most Godly life so we understand we must understand that God works according to his will not to our will don't get me wrong if you're so poor you're you're begging bread you cry out to God and say God you promis and watch God come on the scene and and give you food amen hallelujah if he allows us to go through a little suffering in our lives so be it if we suffer for righteousness sake happy are we the Bible says amen now acts 4:13 that's the apostles after they' raised the crippled man the Bible said who are these ignorant unlearned men but the Bible said they've been with Jesus why because the power of Jesus rested upon them amen hallelujah so blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are they that mourn number two because they will be comforted now I'm taking this uh the way of the Holy Ghost that's the way I'm taking the morning the mourning over sin the morning for the Holy Ghost now two weeks ago we read Ezekiel 9 verse4 how God said I'll put a mark upon all those who sigh and cry for the Abominations done the city blessed are those who mourn over sin that's the approach I'm taking uh with this scripture now you can take it blessed are those who mourn you know when when when the when righteous people die and so forth and they're sorrowful no doubt God Will Comfort them amen but I think don't you think the more important one is those who mourn to get the Holy Ghost don't you think so I would think that's more important because that's eternal life praise God that's uh the Rapture that's the first resurrection that's the Millennium amen all that is involved in the Born Again experience I think that's a little more uh of more importance than just uh mourning for people or Christians when they die which is good God Will Comfort you but I'm taking comfort as the comfort of the Holy Ghost now let's read John 12:24 because I did not read this on Sunday like I said Just A Brief Review maybe 10 or 15 minutes by God's grace John 12:24 verily verily I say un you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit praise God brother random uses this scripture you must die to your will your own will before you can be born again and then you'll bring forth the fruit of the spirit hallelujah amen that's exactly right you must fully die out see you must mourn for your sin you must feel sorry for your sin that's what's so lacking today you don't see people repenting of their sin very often they just feel bad but they don't really repent and try to change their lives we must repent and try to change our lives amen and try to do different the next time because when the next Temptation comes if you obey you'll feel such a purity when you obey amen you'll feel a purified sensation my C or I should say that but somebody called me yesterday on the phone last night I was so happy to talk to them they they called just to thank me for just being a Christian they called just to thank me for the inspiration uh of just being a Christian and they said thanks for all your prayers and all over the years and and all the the life that your family lives they said they struggle with addiction for 30 some years and they said they prayed last night or the night before so is it was Monday night they prayed that they would wake up uh uh when Tuesday morning and be delivered from all their addictions now this is a person who would get high three times a day or go have cocaine three times a day and they were praying and and they said my sermons kept he only heard one a couple of my sermons and he said my sermons kept coming to his mind and the person don't even believe the message they just know that I believe the message and they've heard me preach one message sermon that's all they've ever heard me and they said he woke up on Tuesday morning and he was free and he and he went all through the day he said anoint of the Holy Ghost got a witness to numerous people and he called me just to thank me for the testimony that I held for Christ Jesus and he said don't you ever be discouraged if people you're not seeing the results he said you just keep living the life because even when I was addicted to cocaine and all these things and all these drugs he said I would still think of you I would still testify about Christians he said go hug your children tonight and he said go tell your wife you love her he said keep living for Jesus Christ amen amen I thought praise the Lord you know that you see we've got to die and I told him I said now that your house is cleaned out now that those demons are gone can you imagine 30 years of drug addiction and I said ow that your house is empty fill it with the word amen I said when God delivered me from my chewing tobacco which I never thought I'd get rid of that demon I never thought I never had the courage to think I'd ever get rid of it but once I did I gave myself fully to Bible study I cut off the football I cut off the TV I gave all myself two Sunday Services every Wednesday night studying the Bible every time there was a Bible study I was there and then pretty soon I was leading Bible study God just want so somebody that will serve him as a servant amen he said the Harvest is great but the laborers are few amen and I told him I said you make yourself like that and we'll see he didn't text me back today but I was uh telling him I said these are the steps you need to go to get rid of the football get rid of the TV get rid of the drugs get rid of all this and fill your life with the Lord Jesus Christ I said find the most faithful Bible teacher you know and go sit under them and beg them for the word of God and write down every scripture you know and fill your life with the word and watch if you don't transform into a new creature in Christ Jesus amen glory and he said well maybe I'll go see cam tomorrow night I said you better amen see blessed are those happy are those who lament and cry over their sin hallelujah amen for theirs they have their reward amen number three blessed are the meek the meek inherit the earth God will only let those rule the Earth who rule over sin right now now amen glory who are so humble and so Meek that they let God rule their lives right now that's the only person that God will let rule in the Millennium Glory so here's another way to put Meek these are the other definitions I read so blessed are those who are Meek who those who are not self-interested praise God they are not disputing against God's will they're not resisting God's will they just take everything is God's will unless it was their fault amen glory now there's many many scriptures the Bible said uh meekness is a fruit of the spirit so when you when you have a fruit of the spirit you're blessed because you'll continue to be me Meek and remember fruits don't come all the time they come in Seasons as you serve God longer longer I'm sure brother Jose would know he served God and sister beatric served God all these years I was I would imagine they've gone through seasons of their life where they can see fruits of longsuffering I used to not have this fruit I didn't used to see this fruit of being Meek but now I can see the meekness now I can actually see the fruit of God in my life want it make you happy church amen don't it make you happy when Harvest time comes and you got beautiful fruits there to harvest don't you like that glory amen that's how a Christian is you put in the time you put in the season you go through hard Seasons you go through rainy you go through droughts you go through snowstorms you go through freezes but you stay planted in Christ and in God's season you bring forth Holy Ghost fruit amen glory the Bible said when someone's wrong you got to have meekness to correct them so see you can't be interested in well you got to repent come to my church or it's got all about me you got to repent and pay your ties to me that's not the interest of a of a of a real Christian now you should go to church you should pay your ties but that can't be my interest well it's just more about me and more about getting my church bigger and it ain't my church it's God's church amen God can take me out and you should still move on and pray and get another Pastor in here amen and serve God with all your hearts but you correct me people with meekness the Bible says I want to read these other ones 1 Timothy 611 bear with me because uh for some reason I just can't remember some of these been a busy day by God's grace but uh we're in the right place now Hallelujah 611 but thou oh man of God got any uh men of God in here praise the Lord amen he said flee these things so a real Christian will run from the Love of Money this is the actual context we're talking about a real Christian runs the word world says oh he's tucking his tail like a no he's running away in wisdom he's running to the holy Prince of God and he's running away from demons that's real honorable that ain't a that's a real Christian praise the Lord flee evil run From Evil and run to Christ amen the name of the Lord is a strong tower right in a time of War would you say someone's a who runs in a tower for protection absolutely not I would say they're wise because they won't stand out there and just say shoot me or or get me with a bow and arrow or come slice me up no they they have protection and they use the protection that's a Christian amen he runs from the evil runs from uh Satan and he runs to Christ and he stands there and he's protected as long as he stays in the tower as long as he stays behind the name of Jesus Christ glory for thou man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness follow that we should pursue that we shouldn't follow so many people on Facebook or Instagram or follow so many blogs we should follow Jesus Christ amen and follow people that do these things the Bible says fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life it's going to be a fight to lay a hold on of eternal life but it's the only thing worth fighting for Hallelujah where unto thou also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses amen meekness now here's here's how you receive the word go to James 1:21 let's all read this this is so critical for tonight's service every service if we could just get this uh more and more in our lives we'll we'll experience more blessings of the Holy Spirit James 1:21 brother amen when you get that brother can you read that wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your Souls praise God so and this is how you receive the word at church with meekness which is I'm not interested in myself I don't care how hard it hurts when we preach against sin I'm not interested in me I'm interested in what God's doing praise the Lord and that's not I'm not interested in what I want I'm interested in what God wants for my life that's receiving the word with meekness yes I'll take that because that's God's word no matter what it says no matter how it corrects me or rebukes me or shows me I'm wrong I say Amen to that I believe that and God will help me to live it amen that's how you receive the word lay part all your sins confess all your sins when you come in that door right confess your sins as you come in that door say God forgive me I'm laying apart all naughtiness all filthiness all my mind battles all my sins all my iniquities I'm laying aside all my transgressions and let me receive the word of God tonight and let me not fight against your will help me just to accept your will for my life and I don't want to resist it I don't want to fight against it I want to open my arms to it oh yes amen 1 Peter 3:4 1 Peter 3:4 these are the people that are blessed on the earth it ain't the millionaires it ain't the rich guys it ain't the athletes it ain't the movie stars they're not blessed if they're not in Christ Jesus they're actually cursed the Bible says hallelujah they're cursed if they're not in Jesus Christ Hallelujah Jesus said very few rich people will even be saved it's so hard God God God be praised that we're not rich amen 1 Peter 3:4 Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price this is for our sisters sisters should Manifest this meekness as well a Meek and quiet Spirit praise God Meek and quiet so it's not a spirit that wants to uh exort its own interests oh a sister spirit is a spirit that's wants the interest of her husband because her husband's following Christ Jesus amen and she doesn't dispute against God's will through her husband she just accepts it and that's a Meek and quiet Spirit how many love the Lord amen blessed next number four blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled it's a blessing you're happy when you're hungering thirsting because you be filled with God's presence now I just want to show you the opposite this is clearly speaking of the baptism of the Holy Ghost clearly brother brah mentioned it everybody knows it by God's grace it's a blessing to even hunger for the Holy Ghost now go to Jude 1:12 I just want you to notice this the world is hungry for everything else except God how many can say Amen to that they want they're hungry for everything else anything else anything other than Christ in the word they're hungry for that and the Bible said they'll be filled with all demons and wickedness and Powers that's what they're filled with but you and I aren't filled with that we're filled with righteousness amen we're filled with Holiness we're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Jude 1:12 look at what there these uh people are filled with all right now go to verse 11 woe unto them for they've gone the way of Cain and ran greedily after the he of balam for reward so see they're greedy they're filled with greed and perish in the gain sayings of Kora these are spots in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds that are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withth without fruit twice dead plucked up up by the roots Raging Waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever look how look at that Cain remember Cain was a Wanderer he wandered from that place to that place to that place we need to find where God wants us God doesn't often give people wandering Spirits are you with me Church evangelists have a traveling Spirit but not a wondering spirit amen these are wondering Stars just trying to find some place but a real Christian knows where he's supposed to be amen he or she knows where God wants them amen well look they feed themselves without fear they'll sit in a church service right the Bible says among you there there spots in your Feast of Charity they'll feed themselves uh without fear and what are they feeding on Greed rewards Hees that's what they're feeding when they hear the preaching it's all about just giving the blessings the physical blessings is that right they have no character they're clouds Without Rain they have nothing to give out to anybody else but a real Christian has virtues to give out amen just like a flower has the nectar to give out Hallelujah to the be that's what brother Ram said that's what we should have virtues we should have such love and such a a giving and such a a power that we can give out what we have because we got it from him amen we filled up on him and so we can give out strength and virtue to other people amen you can be strong for other people hallelujah Romans 1:29 let's go there notice again they're filled filled with all the wrong things like tonight they're getting filled with the Cleveland Indians playoff game they're getting filled with that I wonder how many churches are empty tonight because well they probably just have the party right there in the church that's what one of my churches used to do when I instead of just you know the tenants would go down during Super Bowl Sunday so they just had a Super Bowl party at the church what a rebuke what a rebuke that's not the way a Christian should live a Christian puts Christ above everything Hal Hallelujah that's all vanity there'll be no reward for that in heaven no no part of that in heaven amen Romans 1:29 well they're getting full on natural wine but I'm getting full on spiritual wine hallelujah amen glory all right now look look at verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to repr probate mind to do those things which are not convenient so see they didn't want to get filled with God's word so what they get filled with demons vers 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy they envied each other murdered debate they debated a people deceit they deceived people malignity Whispers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents amen we'll stop right there you understand the picture you're blessed to hunger and thirst for a righteous life Hallelujah let me read this quote brother b i got this quote right here hopefully it'll come up you might be filled with a bunch of malice here let me where my there it is hopefully it gets bigger I'm sorry it's so small you can close your eyes I don't want to strain your eyes here all right where is it here there it is okay here's what brother B says he said you might be filled with a bunch of malice you might be filled with a bunch of prejudice so full that you can't even sit and hear one sermon preached you might be filled with a lot of hatred you despise everybody that don't agree with you you might be filled with a lot of nonsense too you might be filled with a lot of Arthur Arthur Godfrey's dirty jokes so much that you think to so much of that that you don't go to church on Wednesday night or something you might be filled with Elvis Presley's rock and roll that's true but you're filled with something and your own life Bears you record of what you're filled with by their fruits you shall know them you're filled with something you you might be filled with a bunch of laziness just too lazy to do anything about it well you don't have to try to be that you don't have to you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleansed from all those things you might be filled with a bunch of Creeds you might be filled with a bunch of denominations but God don't want to be you to be filled with that God made a place in there to put himself in God wants you to be filled with himself what takes place when you're filled with God when you're filled with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with what church power he says you're filled with love with joy with peace with longsuffering with goodness with meekness with gentleness and worship you're filled with joy and the church said that's you're fill with something tonight amen but we got to hunger for the right if we hunger for the word and hunger for Holiness and hunger for righteousness we'll be filled with it amen we just got to not be filled with the other thing we got to hunger and thirst more for God than the things of the world how many believe that he said you're filled with something well let me just finish that quote or you're filled with something and when you're filled with man's ideas if you're filled with church anity I don't want church enity I want Christianity if you're filled with Creed you're only building yourself a Babylon that's got to fall if you fill yourself with a modern world if you fill yourself up with lust if you fill yourself up with pride if you fill yourself up with denomination you're lost there's only one way to endure that is to put the original thing that God made that compartment in your heart to be filled with and that was the Holy Ghost amen beautiful praise the Lord all right next blessed are the merciful see I'm trying to go a little bit faster here but is that still good is it good to review these I would think so I would think it'd be powerful blessed are the merciful because they shall obtain mercy so this this beatitude uh is the on the beatitude of what you seow is what you reap this is specifically about sowing and reaping if you live a life of giving Mercy instead of judging somebody and damning them to hell or criticizing them and all these things without meekness and so forth like that the Bible says God will reward you and let Mercy return unto you all right now in Matthew 18:32 now none of these I remember so I'm just going to briefly read over these so pardon me because I don't think I actually mentioned these on Sunday Matthew 18:32 let's look at that by God's grace blessed are the merciful for they shall be shown Mercy oh yeah this is the parable of the man who has forgiven the 10,000 talents I looked that up one time that was over a100 million in today's uh Society remember the king forgave him uh100 million and then he found some that owed him only like a thousand or something like that and he wouldn't forgive him and the Bible said in verse uh 32 then the Lord then his Lord after he had called him and said unto him oh thy Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servants even as I had pity on the the praise God see pity and compassion it goes a long way praise God because he didn't give it he didn't get it you understand that because that that forgiven man didn't extend forgiveness to his his debtor God didn't forgive him and Jesus said if you don't forgive others he won't forgive you blessed are the merciful for God will show them Mercy praise God Luke 10:37 we must forgive I don't care what someone's done to you you can forgive them you can there might there always may be human feelings there but you can forgive them how many know that's the truth if Christ could forgive if if Stephen could forgive even those killing him we can forgive praise God because we have the same power Hallelujah not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost amen yes sir all right now this is the parable the Good Samaritan look at verse 37 and he said he that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise remember the story the two Jews Jewish men passed it by uh but the Good Samaritan stops and he shows mercy and Jesus said who's they said who's my neighbor Jesus he said the one that showed Mercy praise God let's have let's have mercy on denominational people and the church said amen praise God because at one time guess what I was a denominational person yeah I hope nobody was persecuting me when I was in denomination because I came out I was one of his children amen come out from them my people I'm one of his people amen I came out of Babylon Hallelujah we shouldn't be unmerciful we should be merciful praise God the neighbor when you're a neighbor to someone you show Mercy to them even when they don't deserve it that's real Christianity right there show mercy and God will have mercy on you didn't Jesus say however you judge the situations that's how you'll be judged praise God that's right and the Bible says they judge themselves the Jews judge themselves Unworthy of everlasting life that's why God blinded them they judge themselves so their own judgments was what God used to judge them praise God all right now Luke 1:50 I like this is just an encouraging scripture this is what Mary's rejoicing yeah we almost read it and his Mercy is on all them that fear Him from generation to Generation Now what's fear again brother Austin you remember what's fear again to hate what evil that's one of the first things he quoted after a sermon God bless you sir to fear the lord is to hate evil but the Bible said God's Mercy is on them who fear the lord or those who hate evil so you put those pieces together now I must hate evil I must hate that I must hate evil and then God will have mercy upon me Glory second Timothy 1 let's go there second Timothy 1:15 2 Timothy 1:15 Let's Have Mercy that's why when people leave the message I never condemn them I you know I say that I give warnings and things like that but I never condemn them because I don't know what they're going to do I don't know where their Soul's gonna go I wouldn't want somebody condemn me if I made a mistake I want someone to show me mercy that's why I show Mercy to people 2 Timothy 1:15 and 16 look at this this is powerful this know I'm sorry this thou knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me of whom are falous and hermogenes now did you catch that all the churches in Asia at the end of his ministry rejected him so one point brother Austin brother Benjamin this Prophet walked in there he did all these Miracles all the churches in Asia loved him he left he came back and they said the doors not open you can't preach in our church anymore and yet God had done all these Miracles amongst him and amongst them and they turned him down all the churches in Asia rejected him because every Prophet is always rejected is that right look at the next scripture though God shows Mercy Paul says God's going to show Mercy to one man in all this Asia the Lord give Mercy unto the house of onap forus for he ha of refreshed me he was not ashamed of my chain or the fact that he was in prison or a prisoner of Christ but when he was in Rome he sought me out very digly and bow me the Lord grant unto him that he may find Mercy the Lord in that day and in how many things that he ministered unto me at Ephesus thou knowest very well so while everybody else rejected him and turned down the preacher one man sought him out to find him say can I help you can I help you and Paul says may God have mercy on that one man who showed me mercy praise God blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy amen number six blessed are the pure in heart the pure in heart shall see God blessed are the pure in heart which means the blameless in heart there's no blame you can put on their lives they repented of everything they know also means genuine blessed are the genuine in heart what you hear them say in one room they say in another one praise God what what what what the way they treat one person is a same way they treat the other person they're pure in heart they're not defiled there's no mixture of sin and unbelief it's just love the love of God in their hearts amen I'm not I'm not going to spend much time on this because I want to get moving on by God's grace but these scriptures all about purification this one says Peter says if you obey you purify your heart I mentioned that earlier we read this one on Sunday all those who have the hope of seeing a body change and seeing Christ seeing his face the Bible said he purifies himself amen hallelujah thank you Jesus now blessed are the peacemakers now I think this is where we left off if I'm not mistaken the peacemakers if not forgive me peacemakers shall be called the children of God According To Jesus now I want you to know this God is the author of Peace that's what 1 Corinthians 14:33 says so whenever peace comes to a situation I'm talking about real peace Christ is the one who constructed that Christ is the one who created that Christ is the one who desired that Christ loves peace how many like some more peace in your homes how many like some peace on the job praise God how many like some peace in the church amen not Wars and not fightings and we want peace God is the author of Peace amen the ones who start wars not God Amen God loves peace amongst his children blessed are the peacemakers now of course there are times to balance us out yes where God starts where God brings out a war to bring forth a judgment like Joshua you know different ones like that Moses where they were kicking Sinners out of the promised land because they wouldn't repent by the Bible said the cup of the Wrath was filled up for the amorites and so they got to go in there and kick them out it was judgment time so that's why they had War but we're talking about peacemakers amongst the family of God Amen James uh 41 says that uh why where do Wars come amongst you because of the lust in your flesh that's why you have wars with this person that person this is why there's war and hatred and evil feelings between people because of lust praise God somebody lusts over something somebody wants something usually it's over physical desires or money or something like that right something along those lines some type of Pride or some power something like that that's where the wars come from let's read Romans 16:17 because I want to read this one sometimes the only way to have peace is to kick out the leaven out of the love in other words excommunicate people from the church sometimes that's the only way to have peace and the Bible says there are times for that when you when you go through all the steps Jesus said if there's someone Sinn against you go to them if they don't repent take somebody with you or two people with you they don't repent and take you to the church that's local that's called Church order church discipline and now look in in The Book of Romans 16 verse 17 the Bible says now I beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them so this must line up with what Jesus said if somebody's dividing the church or somebody's dividing the family somebody's dividing the home that shouldn't be we need peace in the church don't we we need peace we need love we need Mercy forgiveness all these things we need God amongst us but if there comes a time when someone won't repent of dividing people and dividing homes and churches the Bible said they can put them away now look at Verse 18 why do people divide and cause Wars It's because they're serving themselves they have become their own God that's what verse 18 says for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but what do they serve their own belly when people start wars with the wrong intentions and lust and fights between people they have become their own God it's self- worship because it's their way it's Pride praise God pride has risen up in them and they become their own God they're serving themselves it's all about me there's no meekness in that is there there's no meekness there's no humility it's Pride it's greed it's a power struggle it's hungering for uh things of the world the the the three Temptations the pride of life the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh amen glory but how do they do it let's 18 how they do it with good words my and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple so they're just so uh so kind with their words and so deceptive and all these things like that make sure we stay with the word of God stay with the doctrine that you've been taught can you Church Say Amen the doctrine brother Bram taught I I try to teach the same very Doctrine he taught anything that's contrary to that get it out of the church tell us tell me about it we must do that we must stay with the doctorine that God has given to us amen blessed are the peacemakers amen for they uh I'm sorry what was I'm sorry what was that blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God so God's children are known for making peace amen number eight we're getting there by God's grace we're getting there slowly but surely blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake not for your sin sake but for righteousness sake you did something righteous and people persecuted you my for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven did you notice when you're persecuted or if you're poor in spirit did you notice you get the same reward both of them if you're poor in spirit what what's the reward theirs is the kingdom of heaven what's the reward for those who are persecuted there's the kingdom of heaven so there's something that goes along with just not Desiring man's Wisdom and also being persecuted there's some connection between those amen if you reject man's Wisdom you'll be persecuted amen I used to feel embarrassed because I was a little you know young in the faith people say what you're preacher okay what school did you go to I used to be ashamed of that now I'm not ashamed at all I said we don't there's I say well Peter never went to a school and he was a preacher right we have nothing to be ashamed of I've been the presence of Christ amen it don't matter what school or diploma they've been the presence of or what college President we got to be in the presence of the burning bush hallelujah amen that's the president we must have a diploma from Hallelujah a degree in theology amen not theology Glory so what do you get if you're persecuted for righteousness sake the Bible said there is the kingdom of heaven now I want to read this let's go to Revelation 2:10 because this is new and then second Timothy 31 Malachi can you get second Timothy 311 can you get Revelation 2:10 we'll get them reading here by God's gra thank you for doing that children I appreciate that so uh Lydia I like you to read first revelation 2:10 whenever you're ready it's kind of a long scripture but listen to the end about the [Music] [Music] reward days fath and I will a crown of Amen so the Holy Spirit foretells them you're going to be put in jail you might be persecuted but endure to the end and you'll receive the reward of eternal life you'll receive a crown amen a crown for being faithful despite being p cuted how many believe the Bible's true Hallelujah Malachi 2 Timothy 311 sir soth praise God maybe I wrote down the wrong one second Timothy 3:11 maybe I wrote down the wrong thing I'm gonna go I'm gonna try 1 Timothy 311 that does just does sound right oh oh I'm sorry is it yeah did you do the different one that's okay buddy came what pers but out of Amen so all the persecutions Paul went through who delivered him the Lord delivered him who's going to deliver you when you get persecuted trust in the Lord and the Lord will deliver you when you get persecuted amen who delivered Israel out of the persecution of the taskmasters God sent a prophet amen God s us a prophet amen we've got the word of God the pillar of fire Hallelujah the Holy Spirit we're talking about will deliver you out of all your persecution stand for the word of God because Christ stood for us hallelujah number nine now this is the last one in this portion of scripture blessed are they which are reviled persecuted and spoken against falsely for Jesus he said for my sake so I just put it for jesus' sake why because the Bible said great is your reward reward in heaven let's go to 2 Corinthians 1 we'll read that by God's grace second Corinthians 1 verse3 I just thought I thought this was a nice portion of scripture here praise God Amen so perhaps God's allowing us to go through these because maybe we got some persecutions coming on don't fear it just cling to the Lord during that time sayl deliver me from my persecutors praise the Lord the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy praise God so perhaps there are persecutions coming we know it as far as the nation we know it's coming for the nation but I'm talking about in your personal life by God's grace second Corinthians 1 verse3 blessed be the god even father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who comfort in Us in all of our tribulation all the tribul let's say all ready all all your tribulation all your trouble he comfort you in all of it but the Holy Ghost is the comforter that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble now look now he goes to us you'll be comforted but then we will comfort those who are being troubled as well you see that we may be able to comfort sometimes God wants to use Amen to comfort somebody praise the Lord sometime God wants to use each one of us to comfort somebody else so you got to be a source of comfort got to be a source of strength a source of love a source of Mercy as we're talking about amen finishing verse four by the Comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God Amen so see the only way you can Comfort somebody's el else is if you've experienced the comfort of God yourself Hallelujah and that's why many times you have to go through hard trials so you can help somebody who goes through the same trial praise God remember the story brother I told about praying for that baby that was sick it took another mother's Faith who could feel the pain of that mother with the suffering baby her baby had suffered and so she was a mother she knew what it felt like so she goes over and lays hands and the Holy Spirit says it was because of her prayer not because brother Rams she was already healed praise God but because she could relate to that the Bible said she could comfort she could pray for that baby because she felt that same Comfort amen that's right verse five as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ amen so even though we're suffering a lot Christ consolation or Christ Comfort is in US amen just like he was comforted by God Amen verse six and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and your salvation so if I go through hard trials guess what it's for your consolation praise God when you go through hard trials it might be for my my consolation you go through hard trials so that you can comfort and help other people praise God Amen which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted is for your consolation and your salvation so if somebody has a good testimony if God answered my prayer you know what you're supposed to share that with somebody so they can rejoice and know that God's gonna answer their prayer amen hallelujah you get a testimony you fill out one of those sheets put it right here on the pulpit so we can see it we that might Comfort somebody Church praise God that's what the Bible says right there when we get comforted it's for your comfort and your salvation amen that's why I shared that testimony about my cousin call last night amen because that ought to comfort you praise God people are watching your testimony people remember your Godly words I must have preached that sermon brother amen about seven years ago at brother Camp church and I didn't know the whole time my cousin sit there how I know he bring it up seven years later how do I know I don't know but what we got to do we got to leave footprints on the sands of time and people will see our lives and see our testimonies and the if we're salt and if we're light they'll want to be like us amen if we're real Christians they'll want to live like us amen hallelujah amen verse seven and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the suffering so shall ye be also of the consolation oh Hallelujah so if you partake of the hard stuffff you also partake of the Comfort amen for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in in as much that we desired even our life or despaired even our lives they were so comforted they actually were having despair about living it was hard to live verse nine but we had the sense of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us amen let's just stop right there by God's grace praise God okay now we've been through the nying Beatitudes but brother ran makes a statement in 19 19661 and he says he said there's a forgotten beatitude how many many know he said that he said that here's what he says he was typing Moses exact Moses type was a type of Christ and we're all acquainted with those types of what Moses was and what Jesus was teaching on the Beatitudes but this beatitude is on over in the 11th chapter and the sixth verse and if you don't watch you'll read right over the top of it and you won't get it it's wedged in between other words but it is a beatitude so let's go to Matthew 11 by God's grace let's go there I've never preached on this so uh it's fresh for me hope it's fresh for you by the grace of the Lord Matthew 11 now if you remember church if you remember the story here's the scripture let's all read that together ready one two three and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me brother ra said this is another beatitude this is another state of Happiness this is another state of bliss when we're not offended in Christ Jesus you remember the story in the chapter 11 John the Baptist was put in prison and he brother ra said his eagle eyes got filmed over and he was he said Satan was trying to kill him and discourage him so he said he would talk to his you know his visitors in prison and he'd say go ask Jesus again is he the Messiah or not I don't know now he'd already said he already said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world he'd already said that he already had a revelation Church it shows how low we can go sometimes times when the devil puts a trial on us the very one he would testified had a vision of he's doubting a little while later because of all the hardships oh my aren't you glad for things like this in the Bible aren't you glad to know that these men were not perfect they weren't spiritual Supermen all the time now they were sometimes right by the grace of God Amen but not all the time and here Jesus tells his disciples of John he said go show John the things you see and hear in my campaign Hallelujah the blind receive their sight the lame walk lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them amen he said to answer your question watch what the Holy Ghost is doing in my Ministry and go tell John what happens in my Ministry then he'll know by my fruits I'll be known and by your fruits you'll be known by my fruits I'll be known what kind of a life what kind of fruit do I produce the fruit of the spirit or the fruit of unrighteousness corrupt fruit or righteous fruit amen a tree is known by its fruit Hallelujah so this is the 10th beatitude brother random said blessed is he who's not offended in the word of God praise the Lord now this thought came to me as I was studying this and this is where I'm going to try to close the next maybe half hour or so by God's grace perhaps there's some other forgotten Beatitudes now brother man never said this but here's my thought there's more red letter scriptures about being blessed how many know that Jesus lists a bunch of them we're not going to read all of them we're gonna read a few of them there's a lot more blessed scriptures and they're all red letters and brother said if you're not careful you'll miss that forgotten one blessed is he who's not offended in me blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are the meek blessed are those that are persecuted for righteous sake blessed are the the poor in spirit all these things blessed is he who's not offended me but Jesus also said blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear that's the first one amen so we're not gonna read that one this is where Peter Jesus asked Peter who do you say am some say I'm Jeremiah some say I'm I'm Elijah some say this or that who do you say he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah amen Simon bar amen because he said the go man has not revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you amen so it's a blessing to receive Revelations from the father amen now in Matthew 24 blessed is the servant who watches for the return of his Lord Jesus said that red letter words that's why we watch we look for the coming of the lord we keep our lives in order because we know Christ can come at any moment praise God Matthew 25 Jesus said blessed are they on the right hand praise God blessed are the those that are separated as sheep from the goats praise God I got through that Bible Study last night so I Mal I had a good Bible study there in copi by God's grace and it was a wonderful Bible study got to pray for a sick woman I'm looking forward to hearing a a testimony of healing by God's grace I'm praying for that with all my heart amen had a real good Bible study and I got to mention that how they they said nobody can be saved without knowing Christ I said well that's not exactly the full truth if they're good to a Christian Jesus will grant them eternal life praise God that's what that that's the scripture right here blessed are they blessed are those who were good to the Brethren praise God blessed are those who visited a Christian in prison blessed are those who gave clothes to a Christian right who didn't have clothes blessed are they who fed a Christian who had no food praise God Jesus said blessed are they so are there some more red letter blessings there are I'm not going to call them Beatitudes but there's some more red letter blessings because brother R didn't say that so I don't want to say that let's go to Luke 11 I want to read this one for sure I put a little Aster by the ones I want to read for sure Luke 11:27 amen so now you can see am I happy am I happy in Christ if not now you know why you gotta live the right kind of life then you be happy in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Luke 11 27- 28 I have oh yeah I love the scripture praise the Lord amen glory they they try to bless they try to kind of butter up Jesus a little bit and they kind of try to uh uh praise his flesh you know look at this I'm sorry praise his mother look at this verse 27 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said to them blessed is the womb that bear thee and the paths that gave thee suck this woman start starts blessing Jesus's natural mother starts blessing her womb and blessing her her breast right that that gave suck to baby Jesus so it's blessing uh the natural mother like the Roman Catholic church right right Church blessing the woman bless the woman and Jesus do Jesus doesn't agree with her he says yay rather which means no rather means no rather no rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it amen anybody can bring forth a baby can I say like that yes that it's a blessing to that but it ain't the same level blessing as it is to keep the word of God to hear it and know it Jesus said so we don't exalt the flesh we exalt the spirit Hallelujah we exalt the spiritual bird not the natural birth amen because the natural birth produces death but the spiritual birth produces life in Christ amen glory I like that Glory Luke 12:36 since we're right there since we're one chapter Way Church let's just read that Luke 12 I think this is again about watching if I'm not mistaken Luke 12:36 yes look at verse 35 yeah let your loins be GED about and your lights burning remember the full armor of God the loins was the belt that kept all the armor on did you know that the belt there it kept everything together if your belt got loose your armor will start falling off your breast plate would start falling off then you had then you really couldn't hold your Shield the right way because you're trying to pull up your your belt there your girdle try to get it but the girdle had to be strapped on and you had to have your your armor tucked in all these things and that's the where you started as a Christian that's where a Christian starts with a girded mind a prepared mind you got to get up in the morning and you got to get your mind right on Christ start with your mind on Christ praise God that's what a real full armored Christian does amen get that girdle going and it's got to be gir about with truth you must know the truth of God's word hallelujah get your mindset on Truth get your belt buckled in and get it tight I know what I believe I know what the Bible says I know what the truth is and I'm standing on it I'm ready to fight amen get your mind right is the first part of that Holy Ghost filled Armor of God get your mind right get it focused on Truth get it prepared with the truth of God's word that's why I told that cousin of mine I said if you now that you're all empty go get filled with Tru truth fill your life with truth get your mind filled with truth and watch the rest of the armor will come amen I'm a witness amen glory verse 36 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding Glory that when he cometh and knocketh that they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching ver I say un you that he shall G himself and make them sit down to me and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or the Third Watch and find them so blessed are those servants that church you know what that meant you know what the second watch of the night was you know what that was the last the first watch was 900 P PM second watch was midnight a day went from 6:00 AM to 6 PM in Jewish time from sunrise to sunset how many you know that so he might come at 900 p.m. you got to wait up he might come at midnight but you got to be watching waiting for our Lord to return you can't go to bed early on the Lord you got to watch and pray for the Lord to come amen what the Bible say blessed are those servants who stay up late into the night watching for the Lord I'm talking about spiritual night spiritual night all right let's go to John 20 verse 29 I honestly thought I personally feel like this could be called a beatitude John 20 because straight from the lips of Christ but again I'm not going to call it beud but I feel like it it seems really like it is um but anyway it's true either either way my thoughts don't matter what matters is God's word uh John 2029 brother Austin can you read that John 20:29 Jesus sayth unto him Thomas because thou Hast seen me thou Hast believed blessed are they that have not seen oh blessed are they that have that have not seen and yet have believed amen I that by God's grace Jesus gives Another redl Blessing blessed are they that have not seen yet they still believe praise God you know sometimes when I go to this certain Church well I'll just say it when I go to Pennsylvania there's a brother who sat in one of brother Ram's meetings and I go there and preach and he would meet me afterwards he's an old brother he's probably like 80 you know a real short brother he comes up and name brother Jack he'll come up and slap me on the shoulder he said you know brother Jesse said you're more blessed than I am I'm like no I am the first time I'm like no I'm not brother what do you mean we're all blessed in Christ Jesus he said ' no he saidou more blessed than I am Jesus said so he said because I saw brother brandom and I believe he said' but you never saw brother brandom and yet you believe he is God's Prophet I said well you got me on that one I'm not sure what to say but I know church when I turn on that tape or I watch that video something stirs me I feel like I'm right there Hallelujah it feels like I am there amen hallelujah why because it's the same Spirit the same Holy Spirit I feel here I feel it when I listen to the tape or when I put on the video why is it because it's the same gospel producing the same effects to the same believers who believe the word of God hallelujah amen blessed are those who have not seen the mighty Miracles or seen a prophet of God yet they still believe praise God amen glory let's close with this the greatest blessing brother B said the greatest blessing was something so let's look at this we read it on this is where I was trying to close on Sunday but I never got to it this is in my text on Sunday morning Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God we pick it up again the next chapter blessed and whole holy is he that have part in the first resurrection that's the Rapture that's where only the bride or the dead in Christ are raptured and the the the those that are alive are quickened and changed in the twink of an eye the second Resurrection is when all Sinners and anyone foolish Virg anyone else comes up for the resurrection to the white Throne judgment on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen here's where the quot that inspired me on this one brother R said it takes the Holy Spirit no man can come to me except my father draws him first all the father ha given me will come to me there you are so when you have the least little tinkling in your heart to come to Christ you do it right away church I hope somebody has a tinkling tonight to come more into Christ a tinkling just a little tinkling a little sound a little bit of a little bit of desire to draw closer to Christ he said you do it right away because that's the greatest thing that ever happened to you praise God is for God to call you to the wedding supper of his son I don't know anything greater how many can say Amen to that amen there's nothing greater that you've ever had in your life other than to hear the gospel preach and it calls you to go to a marriage supper with Jesus Christ in the air amen bless blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb Hallelujah blessed are those who are part of the first resurrection amen one time I heard something a little bit different than this somebody said the greatest blessing I ever had in my life was to meet brother brandom I said no that's on borderline on worshiping a man don't get me wrong I would love to meet brother brand I'd love to meet John the Baptist but there's something greater than meeting a man it's meeting God hallelujah it's meeting Jesus Christ and they put it on the website well the greatest was Meet brother Ram that's not true brother Ram's a man he can't give you the Holy Ghost but Jesus Christ can give you the Holy Ghost amen that's the greatest blessing we ever had is to know Christ and to hear him invite us out of the world out of sin out of Destruction out of misery into a holy relationship into a wedding with himself amen the Bible said in these two Parables he calls many to the wedding the Bible said many were called to the wedding but you've got to to put the wedding before everything the ground the ax and the wife remember the story Jesus said one man said oh Jesus I I can't oh servants I can't come to Jesus wedding I got to go look at the ground that bar so look he was talking he was more interested in his future investments in money than he was about going in the Rapture praise God he more interested in his potential income out there on the ground more interested in the ground and the next thing was The Oxen was the vehicle that was going to get him the money and the investment that he thought he would wanted so much so the first thing is that big old ground that potential and then the ox I got to go test my oxin I gotta make sure they're strong so I can plant my seed and go to work and invest all this time and the last thing was a wife a relationship well no I can't come to the m Rapture because I gotta take care of my husband I gotta take care of my wife I gotta do this first and instead of putting Christ first they put relationships before Christ or they put money before Christ or all these jobs and things like that church we need to put Christ first amen and now this is how this is how strict it is church this is how powerful it is and then when they got to the marriage supper then they had to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be a part of it if not they were bound up because they didn't have a wedding garment on and tossed in the outer Darkness how many remember that look at the look at the levels of sacrifice it takes to be a part of the Rapture but it's for those who are blessed hallelujah it's for those who know it's actually their wedding as well the Rapture is their wedding Hallelujah that is they're not interested so much in the natural wedding they're interested in the spiritual wedding amen it's my wedding that's why I'm forsaking all I'm leaving all that I know in order to be a part of that Rapture let's stand to our feet by God's grace amen you and I are fortunate we've heard the call haven't we we've heard there's a Rapture coming many in the world have heard it but who will leave the ground who will leave The Oxen who will leave their relationships and gather with all the Saints at the wedding supper and then who will stop at the door because remember you had to go in the door and you had to change your garments you had to put off your natural garment and put on a wedding garment now who will get the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that you gathered there I feel like the message uh the message here is like the wedding or the wedding Gathering here you you hear the word of God you come in but you got to the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen then you can strengthen your brethren how many want to strengthen other people I do I had a good testimony about it last night praise God I'm thankful for that I'm thankful that God's grace I can look back in my life and see God's grace help me to strengthen people I don't even know I mean I don't even spend much time with but when you're converted you can strengthen your brethren yes Hallelujah that's just such a blessing amen that the it's a reality of a Christian Life people look at your life and say that's if there's a Christian it's brother sister a brother sister so and so that's the kind of life we got to live if we live the Beatitudes we'll live that kind of Life praise God Amen well that's all I got here tonight for by God's grace that's one of my shortest sermons in a long time you love the Lord tonight let's sing a song here as brother amen comes and then brother amen you're just leading a few songs there he did songs for us there we really appreciate that by God's grace let's sing a song Here by the grace of

happy to pray for you but the thing to do is let's let's hear the call and let's leave everything else behind praise God how many want to be poor in spirit how many want to be a peacemaker how many
