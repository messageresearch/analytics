first Corinthians chapter 4 like to preach on the mystery of the rapture part 3 read our text and then we'll do our memory verse by the grace of the Lord first thessalonians 4:16 Lord willing tonight we'll be looking at how the rapture will 16 what a promise here let's read up on three one two three for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first praise God let's go to Philippians for seven and eight and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things let's have a word of Prayer you like the Lord like beer shouldn't we have one desire that's your presence your spirit your will for our lives speak to us now tonight Lord let your Holy Spirit give us our daily portion for today in Christ's name we pray the church said Amen god bless yous be seated praise God so Lord willing tonight we'll do another installment here in the rapture series it's been a blessing to me I hope it's been a great blessing to you remember part two we looked at the times and seasons of the rapture then we looked at where the rapture takes place of course in Christ it's universal worldwide raptures some people will be working some in the field some in the bed but Christ will take all those who he is one with praise God why will takeplace Christ has to rescue his bride he wants fellowship with his bride he's given the Gentiles two thousand years to repent okay so let's start here tonight by God's grace just want to make sure I didn't miss any of your prayer requests or any text or any updates or anything like that so Lord willing we'll be doing another Bible study so I've got my readers ready liddie and Malachi by God's grace so let's look at how will the rapture now this is a beautiful revelation as far as I know brother Branham was really the first one to teach this three-step process of the rapture now it occurs how does it take place it is by the power and authority of Jesus Christ's spirit and it's done through a three-step process shout voice and Trump we now let's look at the Greek meaning for the word shout it means an order or command or stick out something that stimulates you something that moves you to action so Jesus descends first with a shout and it stimulates the bride it stimulates his people to get ready for the wedding the departing of the rapture praise God now this show or cry it must be the same midnight cry through 25-6 God so they've got to go out to meet the bridegroom which we know represents Jesus Christ in John chapter 1 John the Baptist season but he wasn't the great eternal light Jesus Christ is the eternal light any man or woman of God would say the same praise God I'm just I'm just reflecting his light but Jesus Christ is the eternal light praise God now that cry woke up two kinds of virgins wise and foolish and it gave them the opportunity to trim their lamps which means their wicks but we know the parable only one of them had extra oil to pour into their lamps and that to the our get ready he's coming he's coming and so the preaching today the preaching in the last 50 to 60 years has been telling the people get ready get ready the shout is going out it's still going out right around the world to every nation under heaven and it's her lamp of course the bride does to the wise does too but she has made preparations she's taken extra time to make sure she has oil that will take her and I think her I think it was in the parable I think it was some type of lamp they would take out a torch rather let's take out some type of torch they'd have to have that they can carry out a torch light their torches as well from their lamps and go out to the wedding procession so that's what having the Holy Ghost does it gives you a light it gives you a position in the wedding in the rapture praise God now now we teach and believe that God's ministry through brother Branham the late Reverend Branham was the shout or cry that awakened the Christian Church worldwide and brother Adams daughter Rebecca found a great resource in a it was a bhisma rock ulis healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the Pentecostal movement which was to move to Main Street USA by the 1950s and give birth to the broader charismatic movement in the 1960s which currently affects almost every denomination in the country praise God so even dictionaries encyclopedias recognize that the Ministry of brother Branham started a worldwide revival and if you look at the dates his ministry to started a few months before Billy Graham praise God and then you know shortly after the way back to Abraham and Sarah and the promised son Isaac we'll get to that in just a moment build and we're still believing God to do that as well in our own lives but even there's a there's a very beautiful testimony a sister from no way and they scanned her anyway and the cancer was gone praise God and so it's just a beautiful testimony on Facebook that are diffused from tuberculosis is the same power healing today in our church in other churches because it's the same revelation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his healing power remains the same we must only believe we must get into God's will for healing God's anointing for healing praise God this ministry they say can a rally to obey it praise God [Music] now we'll get to that a little bit by God's grace we see that because in math Matthew 20 10 11 so there's two particular scriptures where Jesus says the whole world must hear hear the message the whole world must hear the gospel then comes the end and we know there's places there's many languages that still don't have the message the Bible based teachings of brother Branham in their language nor have they heard it preached so that's it's God's long-suffering it's God's mercy that's allowing time to continue on so preachers will will soon get anointed to take the message and preach it to them so they have a chance to hear God's Word okay so Malachi can you read that for us praise God so the end doesn't come until every nation Gentile nation right because this is the gen the time of the Gentiles every Gentile nation was happy because the dead in Christ rise first according to 1st Thessalonians 4:16 this is the same voice that raised Lazarus from the dead and John 11 43 and then one day before the living Saints bodies are changed and swelled up in life the dead in Christ who faithfully served Jesus Christ for the last 2,000 years they will rise first and we believe we can't necessarily say it's thus saith the Lord but we believe we'll see them alive for a month or 40 days or 50 days some type of time period that will cause our faith to be so raised that we'll be ready for God's holy spirit to change our bodies because we know we can't do it ourselves it has to be God's anointing that will swallow up death alpha nice if the Alpha knees are going to come down here to pick up their natural bodies which we swelled up in glorified bodies and then after so again we look at Matthew 27 52 and 53 we're not going to read it but in it we find how the Old Testament Saints many of the Old Testament Saints were raptured and resurrected when Jesus resurrected and that's why we believe that many of the wise virgins will raise from the past now those that have passed on that are dead beyond the curtain of time will come back and raise and we'll see them because it's a scriptural precedent according to Matthew 27 52 and 53 that first Corinthians 15 15 52 praise God so see this is the third part of the three step rapture process according to the scripture and that changes our bodies and gathers all the saints the first and dead in Christ and then the living Saints gathers to the sky to meet Jesus Christ in the air oh that's one time we're gonna finally know what it feels like to fly praise the Lord it'll be a trend or some describes coming back aren't you glad he cleanses your life now he purges you now he washes you free from all your sin now that you'll be happy to see him you won't be sad to leave this world you'll be happy you'll be elated praise God you'll be full of the joy of the Lord praise God hallelujah bodas the last trump signal the union for the bride of Jesus Christ with her bridegroom in the sky praise God so the last Trump is like the music you hear at a wedding ceremony here comes the bride she hears that shout she hears that last Trump it's a spiritual sound praise God it's well it causes life to swallow up death and causes us to rise to meet the Lord in the air oh we won't be the first ones that didn't praise God Enoch minute I lied you did it praise God the chariot swung low and we won't need the chair because our bodies will be swallowed up in life and our bodies will be the chariot praise God amen someone's going to do it whether it's our generation or the next generation or the following someone's going to experience it who's born again may it be us by God's grace if not let's live like it praise God so we'll be the dead in Christ that rise first amen hallelujah now the shop voice Trump is all formed by the Holy Ghost case should you want to get a scripture it's gotta be my faith we have to understand all faith is is just anointing of the Holy Spirit right we look at that on Sunday with Abraham when he when he was justified by faith that was a portion of the Holy Spirit a small anointing of the Holy Spirit wasn't the fullness that comes in the baptism Hey praise God what caused Jesus's dead body to rise the Holy Spirit praise God amen and all promises if you've got the Holy Spirit it'll do the same thing for your body praise God in a quickened walk with God everyday walk with Him talk with him pray to him love and sing to him worship Him read his word Enoch he just had to take the next step so will be for you and I will just have the anointing on us just to take the next step into the body change not by our power not by our might but by the Holy Spirit say at the Lord amen thank the Lord now you know there's six father and then three new Testament after Jesus tension four days later Jesus and the Old Testament Saints took a rapture for the time of the jet for Christ's bride to take her away from the Great Tribulation to snatch her away catch her up in the sky defeated by the Satan himself they lay in the streets for three and a half days and then in the presence of other enemies the Holy Spirit comes upon them quickens their mortal bodies and they raised to heaven in the sight of other enemies and an earthquake hits the city of Jerusalem and a tenth part of the city falls and yet there's the 144,000 shouting and praising God for his great power the Bible says the remnant rejoices amen how do they all by their gonna see great things but by God's grace we'll see it from Heaven's corridor because we won't be here we'll be enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb praise God hallelujah the seven seal are the seven thunders and life and death in the power of the tongue I couldn't go back to beds last Trump is the last seal and that yeah it is the last seal so the last trump is the seventh seal via one through three and now four five six so let's read that again now it's a little mysterious but member God hides these things from the eyes and the wise and prudent Church maybe you haven't studied it in which you don't have to but I've studied so many different teachers and they teach that the seven seals are chronological and order the Gentiles according to Roman's 11 so that's why this revelation this message is so important God will hide it from the eyes of wise and prudent but he'll reveal that the deal because the seals deal with the New Testament church and of course they also review all the mysteries for Israel as well so Lydia revelation eight one two three and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came in to look at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto Him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints now that is so important because revelation 4:8 says that the beasts around the throne see not to cry holy holy send it down to the sky to rapture and snatch away his bride it has to be that's the only thing that makes sense in the scripture now let's and then they begin then heaven all the angels that are still up there not Jesus Jesus is down there to snatch his bride away then all the Angels start getting ready to pour out all the wrath of God to all those who rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ so Malachi 4:5 6 in the center that's what the Seventh Seal does it sends Christ down to earth and then it prepares heaven for all the judgments to be poured out upon the unbelievers on the earth that's quite plain I hope everybody can see that by the grace of God so see it's a little bit out of order the Seventh Seal opens up the Seventh Seal just finishes the book right just finishes everything all the rebel are spoken of in Revelation 4 5 & 6 the lamb comes forth no ones worthy to loose the revelation 6 and then all the images and though all the symbols go forth writing and then we see that all the seals are revealed the seventh seal is opened as well and then in Revelation 10 a mighty angel comes down and he brings the open book down to earth to a seventh angel who's on the earth and he finishes the mystery of God so this open book which means the open revelations of God's Word are given to a seven church age messenger and they never did that during his life so that's prophetic John representing the believer is to go and take the gospel as Jesus said in Matthew 24:14 it has to go around the world now occasional let's go to Roman's 11 19 the tilde he's done with all the Gentiles so this proves that revelation 10 is going on right now we're living and fulfilling through 24 14 so okay so can you read rut romans 11 19 20 and 21 this by faith be not high-minded but here for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not see good know that he are you there understand that they think God just blinded them just so he could save and you know and it wasn't the Jews fault no it was the Jews choice God foresaw that they were going to reject Christ because they didn't want to leave their Pharisee sad you see denomination Herodian denomination they want to leave that they're going to reject it so that's why it all worked into God's plan to put a spirit of blindness and slumber on them because they already disbelieved that's what the Bible says so God cut off the Israel branch or the Jewish branch from the holy tree right so they stopped living Isles 25 and 26 Romans 11 [Music] praise God just makes cash out thank you Jesus praise God blindness has happened until Haitian amen thank God oh it's so true the last Trump is the last seal trust everybody can see that by the girl all Israel shall be saved whose Israel the ones that are the Bible said wise and they're virgins as well praise God those 104 four thousand who get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen praise God so that thought just kind of came to me thus more starts dealing with the Jews and that's right according to scripture that doesn't disagree with anything in the scripture okay now let's go so I want to go over the last sign before the rapture very strange scripture to use for the last sign before the rapture but the reason we use your Paul used to say the body changes will be changed at the last Trump and death will be swallowed up in life the scripture he used for that remember was from Isaiah 25 a scripture that was dealing with Jews Paul pulls out that one scripture in Isaiah 25 and brings it to the New Testament to be a thus saith the Lord prophecy for the rapture so brother am in a prophet form a prophet characteristic just like Paul goes to the old tent he just said it consistently he said it frequently and he said it with the authority and with the vindication and break that up are you there okay so let me just background in verses 1 to 8 God visits Abraham and Sarah history that Jesus Christ exercised to the Jew and the Samaritan now gets brought to the Gentile and that of course is fulfilled in Luke 1730 we'll get there in a moment but that's the revelation we mentioned earlier so they have three messengers come down to Abraham and Sarah God represents the son of man ministry gift through brother Branham to the bride and the two messengers represent Billy Graham supernatural vindicated around the world over and over even those even the retractors even the doubters who have left brother Graham's ministry cannot deny the supernatural sign that God gave through that ministry praise God that's because it's thus saith the Lord aim so let's read verses 9 now can you read 9 10 11 and 12 and they said to him where Sarah thy wife and he said Behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return an age it seems to me therapy the manner of women therefore Sarah laughing finish so saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old awesome Keysha can you read 13 14 15 I'm Abraham why would she marry China if anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life Sarah shall have a son then Sarah's and I'm saying I left not then God instantly discerns her doubt in questions Abraham about Sarah's laughter and says is anything - to lie to God saying she didn't laugh but God says nay you did laughs no look at that that's chapter 18 chapter 19 Lots escape from Sodom and Gomorrah and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah chapter 20 Abraham has a second lapse he lies about Sarah being his wife to Abimelech and also shows the restoration of Sarah back to Abraham but then in chapter 21 of Genesis God keeps his word church God will always keep his word amen visit Sarah in Genesis 21 and Isaac is born so this is this so this event foreshadows the arrival of Jesus Christ Isaac represents Christ the promised son arriving for the rapture so before Isaac can arrive what it needs to happen a body change has to happen praise God because Abraham was dead and the Bible said Sarah's womb in a sea so a body change from infertility to fertility had the happen and that foreshadowed the body change that will experience so because we shall all be changed just as they had a body change we have a body change praise God but ours is in a moment so what was God's last sign to Abraham and Abraham and Sarah before the embody change it was the man God discerning Sarah's doubting heart through a supernatural gift of discernment you can say discernment the last sign was God's discernment to Abraham and Sarah because God is the word in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart according to ice that proves it had to be God amen so this is a repeating biblical pattern of God in a flesh body discerning the thoughts intent when Philip called him in John 149 and we call this the son of man ministry because son of man just means a prophet but Jesus gets a capital S because he's divine son of man praise God every other son of man deserves a lowercase now Philip I'm sorry Nathanael is a spiritual person he instantly realizes that Christ knows about his previous conversation with Philip and he instantly cries out and said you're the Son of God the king of Israel praise God Amen man a true believer the one who's in the Word of God and knows the Word of God will be able to recognize God's Son of man ministry right when they see it praise God amen the Stern's of thoughts and tents of a Samaritan woman the woman who had five husbands and was living with us six she told Jesus she had no husband but Jesus agreed and said she's had five and the current one is not her husband so notice she's convinced that because of this special discernment knowledge that Jesus Christ is a prophet sir I perceive that thou art a prophet amen we only must listen to the testimonies of those people who knew brother Branham - to know this same true is putting out videos about the testimonies of Ed Bissell so timely for this message even tonight - but it goes into the story of when brother Bisco had brother Branham come and hold meetings with his Indian Church the Native Americans that he was ministering to think Nathaniel just like the woman at the well at Bisco say Florence Hughes Tom Brown all these individuals as soon as they saw the gift operate they said this is the different this is a special ministry I perceive that this is a prophet praise God because they know the thoughts and intents of the heart so Jesus used it with the Jews in John one with the Samaritans in John 4 but he never uses it with a jet so liddy whenever you're ready luke's 1730 unraised god now going back up we should buy read 26 27 28 and 29 a man or the final coming of the Son of Man before destruction so he says that societal conditions when the neck when he comes as second time as a son of man they must match the conditions of Noah and lot and we looked at that last time with the times and seasons of the rapture they bought they sold we also know the times of Noah was a time where sons of God were compromising they were marrying women outside the faith just because of their attractiveness we see that happening today as well of course lots time was homosexuality and we can all see the rise of that since the Supreme Court legalized it in 2015 so rather have supernatural son of man ministry is the fulfillment of Jesus's the words in Luke 7 19:30 have a video on my youtube channel you can watch it it's from 1954 brother Bram tells a patient 15 secrets imagine that 15 secrets about her life that brother Ram can't know and then tells her she's going home to be well pray Scott and the congregation erupts because no one had at no one had ever seen this live they've read about in the Bible but the Bible was becoming fulfilled prophecy was being fulfilled right before their eyes in the 40s 50s and 60 he's were commonplace like the Bible says just like Jesus's ministry in Paul's ministry this was not done in a corner this gift of discernment was the last sign to the Gentiles before the rapture based upon Genesis chapter 18 in bloomington illinois said remember let me tell you the say that the Spirit of God that's on me this is the last sign to the Gentile church before the rapture three days later he said remember thus saith the Holy Spirit this is your last sign write it in your Bible if something rises beside this and greater than this call me a false prophet and we'll keep standing on that praise God I heard about programs ministry in 2001 so for 19 years I've stood on that patient that no one else knew Paul says when that happens in a church people should fall down and say truly God is among you praise God next May 19 1961 in British Columbia brother Branham said just remember thus saith the Lord you will never in any no more gentle 62 in Grass Valley California brother Branham said you'll never receive another son this is it thus saith the Lord would a prophet of God make a statement like that if it wasn't true you're receiving your greatest sign and your last sign before the appearing of Christ I encourage anybody if you're listening it was so different from others it had to be it was the son of man ministry before the rapture on April 11 64 in my heart that speaks that this is the truth I believe it praise God and you've seen it now we watched it in our lives for almost 20 years no sign has ever gone greater to the Gentiles than the sermon God gave to William Branham praise God I meant two people that had this discernment Tom Brown and Tom Browns testimony he had an interview with brother Branham and brother Graham slid the paper and then sister Florence Hughes I met her I believe in 2010 God brother man told her go away yourself the next two Monday's you'll see you'll gain weight that's assigned to you that I told you the truth so her tuberculosis was discerned and then the prophetic power the Holy Spirit foretold her healing and she lived many many years afterwards so this discernment gift of brother Branham was at the correct time just as God in flesh appeared to Abraham and Sarah at the right time it appeared before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Isaac's birth the son of man ministry of brother Branham appeared before the rapture and the Great Tribulation let me try to find a place to close here yes many of us obviously most of us alive today we did not experience brother branham's son a man ministry firsthand but we need not be discouraged praise God as we said earlier most prophetic gifts are rejected and then God after a prophetic gift leaves then God gives the people still time to repent afterwards remember John the Baptist was sent to the Jews but rejected by the majority right and then Jesus came the greatest prophet that ever lived Jesus Christ came and then after he died in AD 30 they still had 40 years afterwards in which to repent before Titus brought destruction and destroyed Jerusalem and the temple and so God always gives time afterwards for people to receive that last sign so we don't have to be discouraged thank God there was tapes to record brother branham's of Abraham and Sarah today praise God more here so in the book the that chapter is basically finished and then I end each chapter with the rewards for Rossio and then just a short conclusion and then action steps you know some people like lists of things to do so just give a quick action steps on how they can receive the revenue and I have to use our imagination the channel this is where God wants to use your imagination not to daydream about evil things or plan and imagine plans to to feed the flesh but this is where God once used the channel of imagination to try to fathom the immensity of Christ rewards for his bride now we already talked about a few rewards at least four more rewards patient can you go to scripture for me first Thessalonians 1 verse 2 yeah let's just do the first reward and then we'll be done tonight by God's grace what a blessing my love going over these things don't you it solidifies us in the fundamental truths and revelations that we have to know but I am said if there's a mystery of God we have to know it praise God because the mystery of God is finished according to revelation 10 7 and Deuteronomy 29:29 says the mysteries of God belong to his children that they may obey them and keep the ways of the Lord praise God were the only ones that are going to keep the ways of the Lord because we've got the revelation of the mystery everybody else don't want all of it but we want all of it so we can live you are part of Christ's bride now this is a great reward but honestly something we wrestle with so much because of the battlefield of the mind remember you're three parts your body spirit and soul so in case you can you read that first Thessalonians 1 verse 5 raised God so the Thessalonians were Gentile heathens some of them didn't want to work some of them said the rapture is our Holy Ghost because it's the power in the Holy Ghost and much assurance because what is a seal in the Greek a seals security from Satan so remember of fusions 1:13 Ephesians 4:30 you're sealed by the Holy Spirit to the day of your Redemption so where is that security things are secure we wonder about things the security the assurance the safety the much assurance is in your soul your nature so when you when you shut out the battlefield of the mind and just meditate and let the nature of God be your meditation that's when you feel God's blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine amen it is a seal it's a mark upon by the impress of a seal or stamp God has impressed your soul right are you impressed upon yourself or he's God amen your soul is impressed with God's nature with God's power God's assurance amen that's what it means not so much your mind your mind is needs transformed every day but the soul was impressed by the power of God amen the boat was called a token to Noah which we still see today we benefit from that covenant right we preach on that lately the circumcision to Abraham's males and his sea was called a token and leave it's Genesis 17 the Passover lambs blood upon the doorpost was a token in exodus 12 Aaron's rod that budded in numbers was called a token and the scarlet cord in John lamb and Rahab scarlet cord the public display of the Passover lambs blood was required for Israel's exodus out of Egypt in fact without the blood publicly displayed the death angel destroyed the firstborn of every house whether Jew or Egyptian in the same way the life of Jesus Christ must be publicly displayed in the lives of Christians in order for them to make an exodus or be snatched away by Christ from the great tribulation in the rapture praise God amen it's another Exodus praise God we know there's three Exodus a--'s right the first one was Israel out of Egypt the second one was Israel out of the law into the baptism the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2 and the third Exodus is the eternal the seal believer exit made it making an exodus out of this natural world into the heavenly realms praise God amen wrath so the Scarlet Court represents a public testimony of the red blood of Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit because the Bible said the life is in the blood in Leviticus 17:11 see these Old Testament symbols represent the life of Jesus Christ which is the Holy Spirit baptism and it must be publicly displayed by Christians because the Spirit is life Romans 8 10 praise God Romans 8 10 and let's stand to our feet here just as the boarding pass on a plane is the assurance you'll have a seat on the flight the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal or token part in that a beautiful reward the first reward we want to mention there is the blessed assurance let's sing that blessed assurance Jesus is mine we kind of already sealed my soul so that I have a ticket I have a place in the rapture procession amen go get it by God's grace Jesus said all those who seek shall find all those who ask it will be given to them all those who knock the glide or mark [Music] Heavenly Father thank you for the blessed assurance as Paul said Christian life hallelujah we know a co security it's assurance impressed God they're not thoroughly impressed with the Word of God Babel although they they get it may they seek it and find it more but they stop fount of every blessing and seal the hearts of our children our loved ones our family our
