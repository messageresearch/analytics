refresh us in thy divine presence stir our minds by way of remembrance today and we ask all these things in jesus christ's name and the saints said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do have some quotes i'd like to share today so uh today's actually the finally i'm going to get to this picture of what the jordan looked like before they uh they kind of damned it off a number of years ago this is kind of what it looked like years years ago quite a mighty rushing river there but we'll get to that a little bit i just want to pull the screen up in case i got any quotes i like to look up i can't find so let's take a few moments here and we'll preach on god's word today very happy to be in the house of lord today amen so we will look at joshua here we're part nine i believe um it's quite a rushing river there uh brother ram kind of dramatizes a little bit he said he said what a foolish thing it looked like for god to bring israel to this river in the month of harvest april we just finished april he said what a foolish thing it would seem to be uh for god to do that and no you remember no doubt jericho and everybody would would have had at least a little bit of the pressure let off because oh the the river's at its highest this year how they gonna get around that and we know they were under fear but but they knew also the river was at its highest and uh it was quite a quite an obstacle but our god specializes in overcoming obstacles amen he's the great faithful god and uh he delights we know he's so great you know he's so great he just sets up he allows these little obstacles to happen just to raise our faith right right he knows there's nothing he created all these things he know there's nothing that can stop him right we know he's he's he's undefeated praise god in battle he's he's he's almighty he's he's worthy of all praise and he sets these situations up church for our faith to grow praise god he wants to see us overcome the test of trial he wants to see us come through the fiery trials of faith and come out on the other side as gold amen now uh i'm not this is really not a future thought but i just want to bring this out you know before we get as we get started here um just as a lesson that you know as we go forward you know and if the lord tarries we're just going to have to keep growing in grace to rightly divide brother branham's quotes let me say like this i believe brother branham was a vindicated prophet with all my heart i don't dispute that at all but we have to recognize not every word he said was vindicated and that's where there's always less amens but that's true not every word he said was vindicated right he said i believe by by 1977 the earth america would just be tree stumps left he said i believe joseph is a prophet you know god will give him four or double times double everything i've got and he has yet to do one prayer line right and he said double times that's four times right he said your body's 80 petroleum now that's that's the human side but the divine side said thus saith the lord your will amen the divine said these seven seals are thus saith the lord with history with revelation with interpretation that's thus saith the lord amen and we know that was right praise god and he's a vindicated prophet but not every word is vindicated and that's where it takes a lot of maturity but that's what this joshua bride's all about maturity amen we'll get to that hopefully lord winning you this week or next week by god's grace this is what she's all about she's a mature army she's not a baby army anymore she's not a uh a fearful army anymore she's strong right all the voices have told her be strong be very courageous amen walk in the ways of the lord just meditate on the word meditate on what you know is the word of god and i'll bring you into the land amen and no man no woman no church no denomination no government will be able to stand before you all the days of your life just be strong just be courageous just believe the word just walk in obedience to the word of god and nothing will stand before your prayer amen hallelujah now i just want to lay this out that brother branham we we know and i i did it again today i was looking at some of the script or the quotes rather he went back and forth on the meaning of the promised land and we just sang about it uh i went down to the crimson river so there and and there's both types in that song i don't know if we caught that but both times there's a type of being forgiven and baptized with the holy ghost but then when i go down to the river to cross over and go to heaven you have both applications in that psalm did you get that i didn't catch it until right now you have both images of the river you have a river of well i'm going to cross here and i'm going to die to myself but then you have the river i'm going to cross the river and go to heaven right and so we have both types that are can can be used there now brother branham talked about the meaning of the promise and look at this i'm going to show you the quotes brother random called called the promised land the millennium in 1953 55 in 1960 when he preached as i was with moses he called it the promised land and when he preached the adoption series but then at the very end of his life he calls it the millennium again because there's multiple types for it right and so this proves the last teaching of brother branham isn't always the correct one right or or you could have because he at the end of his life he was still human and he could have said something which was his own opinion like martin luther king jr there in 63 right that was just he said that this is just my opinion he said i have nothing on it from the lord he said you got to be very careful what you're listening to the trouble is today we don't have very careful listeners right we and i showed it to you last week i showed you last week where the pastor of the branham tabernacle says you don't have to be careful you can believe everything on the tape that's what he told his church i just played it last week he said you can sit back and relax you don't have to be careful you know what they're doing they're opening themselves up to any kind of a spirit you have to constantly constantly be on guard because i might say something wrong i might hurt you right someone another preacher someone someone might hurt you right you got to be very careful right i'm not perfect i would never want to hurt you but i might say something wrong so you've got to be constantly on guard you got to be careful what you're saying amen to because over there in jeffersonville they're saying amen to everything and acting like everything is from the lord everything was not and so they're in church sin remember has 11 effect sin lost doctrine it's gonna be growing so see i made seven false doctrines out of jeffersonville i increased it to nine and now it's at ten it's growing as time goes on it just it's gonna keep growing until they root out the very nature or the very uh beginning of that sin they've got to go back where they left god if they're gonna get right with god and that's nothing but the truth sin always has an increasing effect if it's not repented of and look at all the brothers that have emailed them and try to get them to repent and they double down on it church we better be careful that god help us not to double down on any and of our mistakes right we've got to make sure we're constantly open to correction right here's in 53 he says when they got over to canaan did not represent heaven they had wars in canaan it represented the millennium so here in 53 the promised land was the millennium here in 55 and i believe the promised land represent the millennium a thousand years in the millennium and it may it may be a dual type now i can't see the millennium type yet but i'm growing in grace i can only see crossing jordan as a promised land of a baptism of the holy ghost type i can't see the millennium type right because there was no wars in the millennium and how many know they right after they crossed it was battle time in jericho people died right thousands of people died in jericho there'll be no death as far as well there's some quotes on that there'll be very little death in the millennium and maybe no death in the millennium now here's where i'm pulling this from now this is right this is four months but this is may 60. uh four months before he preached as it was with moses now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium so see how he was trying to grow he was he was gaining his understanding it only represents the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in canaan they killed him burned and took the cities and there will be no death in the millennium but then he says in 64 there might be death in the millennium because the bible said a child will die a hundred years old but what does the promise land to the new believer he said the promise of the holy spirit praise god that's why i like listen brother brad i'm by growing grace but i also see oh he's human and you know church had always come i always get it at a time when i need it somebody that's going to try to rebuke me or something and i got these quotes to show them well what do you say about this they don't have no answers right because they got a they got an evil spirit they don't have any answers now here's the as it was with moses oh i got to stop here many people refer to the promised land to the millennium now brother brown was one of those persons now look at him he's so he's so convinced he's right now he said many of those people refer to the promised land as a millennium i just showed you quotes where he was saying that church he's a man it is not the promised land had wars and killings the millennium won't have any wars or killings it referred to the holy spirit the battlegrounds justification they left egypt there are three stages of their journey okay if you listen to that sermon you'll hear now look in 1965 israel the old testament type type of the bride coming up out of the world marching the road to canaan or the canaan that we go to the millennium listen this prophet speak he said the friends of god he know what he was talking about he says the statutes and judgments this is moses which i teach you do them they may live and go possess the land which your lord your god given you that types are millennium so what five months before he passed he's back on oh now the crossing jordan is the millennium right so we got to be we have to be uh we have to be patient praise god and we have to grow in understanding hallelujah amen i just want to show that so you can see the clear examples how he would he would go from one he was convicted really really strongly this way and then he's really convicted the next way and then a couple years later he got a different understanding of it that makes me feel happy right because if god was constantly teaching his prophet god can constantly teach me amen praise the lord now let's get part nine here uh actually i'll change my text there sorry now we start this chapter by saying god magnifying joshua how many can say amen to that he's he's magnifying joshua in the sight as moses is successful in the sight of all israel in verse 7 he said this day i'll begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may that as i was with moses so will i be with thee now god had told him i'm going to be with you like moses i'm going to be with you just be strong just be strong but josh all those things with moses how the people ever going to respect me like moses and a lot of them didn't have respect like they should have right but this was a new generation they had a new chance to show respect to god's minister amen and so god said i'm going to magnify you in the sight of all israel and so uh robin says now joshua the new warrior only two left now that ever promised that ever left the promised land joshua caleb the new commander the leader army the second to place where a great man like moses stood it was no little task he says he said i think of a minister today that's called of god to step into the tracks where jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of god is commissioned to stand in that same place he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he would the works that i do shall you do also each minister is ordained of god is command to stand in the tracks of jesus christ and perform the duties that jesus performed that's quite a command so church we have a commission now the pope is a perversion of this because he says he's standing in jesus instead on the earth well that's a lie he's not because he breaks jesus's word but there's some truth to what he's saying we have to stand in his stead we stand in jesus instead right joshua stood in moses instead and so preachers today we stand in jesus instead right as we are ministers of the word of god and it's no small command it's no little task brother branham said the highest calling is to be a minister of the gospel that's the highest calling in the world is to be a minister of the gospel it's no small task we're not lifting up preachers but at all because we all need god's grace but they have a task to do what jesus did joshua knew that the land was there he went first and found out that they could come back as a witness god called ministers ought not to be so stuffed out with theology but to have visit the land to where we're going bring back evidence of divine and the power of jesus christ to make known to their congregations that there is a land beyond the river hallelujah so brotherhood says a preacher needs to be able to go into the land like joshua right and bring back evidence here's evidence i've been over there i've got evidence that there is a land amen right brother branham went over beyond the curtain of time and he come back and said the only way to get there is divine love amen he brought us evidence of the vision right and evidence of it and he said i'll never be the same william branham again i'll always be a different william branham he said i no longer fear death now i have a boldness going to death because i know i don't go there's a little cloud floating i've got a spiritual body i've got a theophany and i can hug the saints and i'll be with them and i'll be with you amen thank the lord now church i've got evidence too i've seen god heal the sick bodies i've seen god seal or hear or heal sick hearts and i believe on the lord jesus christ we've seen people say praise god and you can say the same if you've gone over there you know what the land is like it's a good land amen hallelujah it's a good possession praise god it's good to live in that land there's so many blessings in that land amen the land of promise all the inheritance all the spiritual blessing church each one of us should be able to say but especially ministers that they've gone over there they know what it possesses and that it contains many blessings it has everything we need for our life's journey amen amen glory oh what a blessing now go to joshua 3 7. joshua 3 7 i'll read verses 7 to 13. i just want to uh read some of these verses now we read verse 7 this day i'll be beginning to magnify you verse 8 and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan you shall stand still in jordan so the priests were to go with the word the ark and stand still in the jordan right so everybody else can pass over so the priest had to kind of camp out in the word and that's something the preacher's got to live in the word right he's got to be right in the middle of the word if the people are going to cross over the preacher's got to stay grounded in the word of god hallelujah amen verse 9 and joshua said to the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god so now josh was repeating what god had told him verse 10 and josh said hereby you shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the gergescites and the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passes over before you into jordan i'm going to 13. now i'm going to read 12 2. now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man and it should come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand up on a heap so they were gonna god was gonna cut off the waters of jordan from the waters that were above north that were flowing down jordan god was gonna cut them off now look at this joshua prophesied so how does god magnify joshua when joshua foretells what's going to happen and then it happens so god uses the spirit of prophecy in joshua to magnify joshua in the sight of the people amen right and he said this is going to be a sign the fact that god does this today is going to be a sign that you will have all the future victories amen church that's all it takes in our lives is one great miracle i hope i i hope you understand what i'm saying that when god does one great supernatural work in your life and there's something prophetic that comes to pass in your life you can take that confidence and know if god foretold this if god did this supernatural work he'll be with me all the days of my life amen amen when you've asked for something and you waited on it and god finally delivers it or something supernatural happens you can stand back and say look at that this is what god did god is with me god is going before me whom shall i fear if god has foretold me this if god prepared me for this if god put me through this he'll bring me through my entire journey i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus glory so how does god how does god magnify joshua he lets him say something in the name of the lord and it comes to pass bill maher said if you're born again like joshua he said you can be reckless in other words you can have a lot of confidence you can have a lot of zeal that as long as you're staying obedient to the word of god god will be with you here's where he says it last night preaching on jordan now we get over that river it divides us it separates us one on the other side something's happened to you i'm sorry once on the other side something's happened to you now joshua and all's knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless he could be we'd call it reckless as long as he was pointed the right way we might break up against the hill that would knock him backwards but he was headed the right way so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way praise god see as long as our lives are pointing toward christ pointing toward holiness amen pointing toward faith in god's word we can be fearless we might run it he said look at that run into a hill and knock him backwards well the only way a hill could knock you backwards is if you run into it and try to crush the hill right because you wouldn't you wouldn't you just wouldn't fall down if you walk up to a hill you've got to try to run through it right that's the only way you'd fall through it well look at the faith brother says we should have such such a faith and such confidence we should be so so free from fear that any obstacle we feel like we can run through a troop and leap over a wall praise god hallelujah amen look at the faith god tries to write upon the hearts of israel on joshua and this young generation we got any young generation saints out there praise god you just feel i'm a i'm a holy ghost filled say i'm not of this whole generation that that worship moses i'm not of this old generation that doubted the promises of god i'm an overcomer i'm going to live in that land the prophet talked about i'm gonna possess the promises of god all promises of god to me are ye and amen that's what i am i'm one of those young generation believers praise god i'm not one of those old-timers that doubted moses and wanted to go back to the world no way i'm one of those that oh give me my mountain amen give me my inheritance let me see the will of god let me see the plan of god in my life let me see it working out and i'll be happy and thankful praise god i'm not a complainer can i say it like that i'm not a complainer when everyone there's when there's struggles i'm going to confess god's word amen i might whisper a few complaints but i'll say god forgive me i'm not gonna camp around complaining they complained ten times and god said because you've done that and moses because you magnified yourself and spoke against the people and you let the people get you fired up he said you won't see the land we're not complainers we're not exalting ourselves we're worshiping christ amen we are thankful and we're giving god glory and god's power is going to take us over we're going to obey every word of god amen we're going to confess all sin we're going to keep all sin out and we're going to confess all the promises you can be reckless church you can be fearless if you're pointing the right way we talked about that reckless song the reckless love of god people didn't like that well they didn't know brother ram said it they must have not been looking the quotes too deep right we can have reckless faith because god is with us as he was in the seven as he was with paul so he's with us amen john said so john said jesus is in the middle of those seven church ages jesus is right here today amen he's right in the middle of this gathering amen because he promised to be amen amen we have nothing to doubt about it he promised we just got to recognize his presence and obey his voice amen amen he's the one that promised i'm not the one that promised that he's the one that promised that and he always backs up his word hallelujah for he said as i was with moses so i'll be with you i'll not fail no forsake you he never forsaken moses he never failed moses he will not fail joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us now i'm going to i don't have in my notes but yesterday i was listening to a little song it came back to my heart it's called your love o lord and it comes out of the inspiration was psalm 36 i'm going to go back there church just you know if you're ever discouraged just go outside sometime and look up to the clouds right psalms 36 5 says thy mercy o lord is in the heavens right so we can lift up our hands we can look to heaven and we know there's mercy for us there whether we made mistakes or whether we feel like we can't get through something and we need more strength there's mercy up there oh there's not judgment the blood of jesus took our judgment amen amen there's not judgment in heaven upon us their judgment upon the sinners in heaven but uh not on us there's mercy for us in the heavens amen look at verse five finishing verse five and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds so yesterday i was a little bit you know just tired you know i heard this song i went out there and i looked up and i said my look how high those clouds are that's how faithful god is going to be to me look at that how many hundreds of feet are a thousand feet up there that's god god is protecting me with a wall of faithfulness amen there's walls surrounding us church we have wall spiritual walls we thank god for these walls but we've got much bigger walls than these amen it's god's faithfulness protecting us amen he's with us he's guiding us and that was owned in the old testament praise god amen how much more the blood of jesus oh he's so faithful oh this covenant speaks better promises amen amen well jesse is how faithful is god to you as high as the clouds are that's how faithful he's been to me amen to that and then verse six thy righteousness is like the great mountains his righteousness his purity his integrity right his innocence is like the mighty mountains god is so pure so holy he's so true he's faithful his faithfulness is so great his integrity is so great oh what is he trying to be he's trying to show us how great he is with with all that he can the sky the mountains all these great things that's god's faithfulness to you that's god's righteousness for you we just must accept it and remember it thanking god for it he's been faithful to me like as high as the clouds he's been faithful to me all the days of my life just this week we're driving on friday we come over this little hill on eastern road i just there's something i just kind of felt like oh you better be watching the road we come up over this hill there's an intersection right there a big truck pulled out in front of us i slammed on the brakes it's almost like i was ready for it not because of me but because of god's faithfulness amen we could just my wife and i could have gotten a car accident you know the guy standing on his brakes and he just kind of waved as we drove by i was like yeah that was jesus he protected me i was holding zion walking down the stairs last week and i slipped or there was something i forget what it was something like maybe on the stairs and i thought i was going to fall and all of a sudden i just caught myself it would have been awful it was like the top step think about my weight crushing his weight just think about that and i instantly i just almost started crying say thank you jesus you just saved my life or saved his life just little things like that how faithful is he he's faithful in every one of my footsteps amen or one of my car tire tracks can i say like that he guides my footsteps he guides my tire tracks he is the faithful god and it reaches so high it reaches to the clouds amen he deserves praise for that amen he deserves thanksgiving for that amen he's faithful god how excellent is thy loving kindness in verse 7 oh god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of his wings you have such a place of safety today just crawl up under jehovah god eagle and just get close up under his wings just feel those wings sometimes right brother i'm still like this he said just get real close to that old testament new testament right just just just just curl real close up there and enjoy the wings of jehovah amen the old testament says in the new testament i'm surrounded by god's protection i'm surrounded by his power amen that's what he promised he told joshua the same thing as i was with moses so i'll be with you as god was with brother branham so he's with us amen because we're using his prayer class amen and god's he on the sick amen thank the lord for that it's just one example joshua 3 14. turn back there now i have some notes there as soon as the priest's feet touched the waters the waters stood up on a heap israel passed over on dry ground that's what we see in joshua chapter 3. now this is quite interesting notice god's power and his grace to prepare dry ground for israel's feet look how god pays attention to our needs if you took two million people across the river and it was muddy do you think they trip and fall do you think some of those little baby babies would trip and fall those two-year-olds three-year-olds but god is so kind he turns on his uh his leaf blower can i say it like that we had the leaf blower out yesterday he turns on his leaf blower and he starts blowing the river back right and he he just doesn't stop once the water's gone he actually pushes the mud back too and so the mud has moved back and i looked up yesterday on google i couldn't figure out how many feet you had to go down to get the dry ground under a river under river i don't know but you probably gotta hit clay or something like that and then you gotta just so he was so careful see he protects our footsteps he makes our footsteps sure now for us we're not crossing rivers today naturally but he gives us feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen and brethren says that is go anywhere go any place for the word of god so god is guiding your steps god wants to tell us to go witness to someone or go go pray for someone or go bless someone with a love offering or something he's guiding our steps and and our tire tracks as we said he's guiding us along and he's going to make sure every place we put our feet is protected by him he's going to make our every step that we take he's going to make it sure amen and i'll say this if we just let the word go first amen it was a thousand feet a thousand feet just keep the word ahead just make sure you're behind the word don't get in front of the word just make sure the word's going before you and every step you take will be absolute sure amen there'll be no question about it because the word already went before me amen i didn't move until i saw the word go first amen that's right now think about this brother i i think i have this quote here from brother brown later brother brown said where how did the how did the water stop brother bram said you had water millions of gallons flowing in from the mediterranean sea how did he just all make it stop because it's still flowing right so the water's still flowing but he kind of stops it right there right how did he do that we don't know he's just like he said sun stands still one of those paradoxes right because he controls nature he's able just to slow it down right there it doesn't get backed up it doesn't boil over the edges right we would think it would flow over overflow on that on the ground nope it just stays right there and he actually pushes it up and builds it up and i don't know if he stopped the mediterranean sea i don't know what he did but he's able to hand it he's able to stop it there to protect his covenant people amen oh church he'll do anything he'll cross heaven and earth to protect his people under his covenant praise god he did it with shadrach meshach and abednego he crossed heaven and earth and he went down with him not outside the fire he joined them in the fire amen god is joining us today god is with you today he wants to stay with you today if you'll just obey his word i love that as soon as the feet touched the water moved back why because god was blessing every step that they took he said he said every place the soul of your foot goes you've got it it's your possession amen and he proved it there as soon as the first priest put his foot in there the water moved back because footsteps are possession amen that's right now i like adam clark i'm just i'm gonna try to get more references right because we don't want to be plagiarists i record that video this week anyway it's gonna take me a couple weeks to get it out about larkin and brandon brother ram did not plagiarize him he just forgot on future home but i didn't cite anybody on the future home that i could find so he just forgot that doesn't mean he's a plagiarist he just forgot remember uh he said the brotherham said justification i think seven times in that sermon he said sanctification like 13 and he said baptism in the holy ghost almost 30 times in that sermon larkin clarence larkin never taught the three works of grace so brother adam's excitement was wow the earth goes through three phases the three works of grace just like a christian goes through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost he brought out lots he brought out at least eight of larkin's details but that's not what he was excited about he was excited about the revelation he preached all of his life the three works of grace was again vindicated and he said he lived off that revelation for two weeks and that's what i hope church i hope some sermon you've heard from our church or something brother branham somewhere has fed you for weeks on end oh that's right that's right hallelujah happens all the time if you're if you're in tune with the holy spirit it'll happen all the time but just keep going back to that you want to listen to that one again yeah i want to listen to that one again adam clark said god leaves no doubt as to his presence power and love for israel now i like what he said here this jordan river seems more miraculous uh than the red sea crossing because there's no wind recorded in this miracle the bible said in exodus 14 god caused a great southern wind to come up and everybody you know all the jews and moses they feel this wind and and the waters move back but when joshua went across there was no wind all there was was power of god amen just the holy ghost i said this the angel of the lord amen because as soon as they stepped in they didn't feel any wind just the power of their steps the power of their faith amen the power of the ark can i say like that the power of the word move the waters back amen and although the waters weren't as great there was no wind it looked like there was no assistance from nature it was the power of the word amen the rabbi said the ark is the word because the law was in the ark it represents the revealed word of the hour amen oh there's power in this word today praise god they'll drive back all your obstacles that's exactly right god was going to make it sure he said this day i'm going to magnify joshua in your sight as i was with moses so will i be with you by this miracle now in verses 14 to 17. as soon as that's what i was mentioning earlier i kind of got ahead of myself as soon as the feet touched the waters the water stood up israel passed over on dry ground because god said every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses now that church they had to obey right the priests had to obey the priests had to take the word and move based upon the word right and church as soon as you do that as soon as i do that many times the obstacle will start moving back if we just obey the word first is that right whether we're sick we just gotta obey the word whether we got a a debate coming up or whether we have a discussion coming up or confront somebody's sin we've got to move with the word first right and things will get better right as we move on with the word praise god but you got to step with the word and as soon as you put the word first it kind of seems like everything's going to clear up pretty good amen hallelujah the feet in the river the feet just just stepping into the promise of god just stepping into the promise of god just going forward with the word of god will cause your troubles to move back that's right so true so true now this is a beautiful message but then it goes through all the memorials god gave you know abraham moses and he talks about joshua now joshua his word was at stake see because he was prophesied he prophesied to the people his word was at stake he must cross over this river it looked like it picked the worst time that could ever be thought it was the month of april that's when the snow was melting in judea coming down through the mountains and then old jordan is muddy and spread plum in the fields to water the fields of jordan and it looked like if it would have been mathematical or educational or scientific he picked the worst time in all the year to cross jordan but the blessing was joshua didn't pick this time god picked this time right you and i we don't pick some of our trials we go through god allows them to happen amen and we must we must remember some of these things i didn't ask for you didn't ask for some of the trials you got they just come upon you well that just means god brought you to a jordan river amen and he's going to show his power and he's going to move the obstacle amen god brought you there just like god brought them there god you don't over the events of your life god orders the events of your life praise god see because god likes to take those time those kind of times to prove that he's god god likes to get bring you to difficult obstacles that he can prove how great he is to you maybe this will change the way we look at some of our trials praise god and men of god who believe god and know what god has promised is not afraid to do it because god will stick with his word just as certain as he is god he said first take the ark and go forward when those priests feet touch the jordan no matter how wild she was and how she was swelled it give away to god's eternal word for the word was in the ark said give away right he said give away the obstacle has to give away when you speak the word of god praise the lord that depression has to give way when you start worshiping jesus with joy amen praise god that doubt or that fear that has to move away as soon as you start praising jesus and tell tell him what a great god he is amen it has to move away whenever you put the word up against the obstacle the word is going to win amen you think the word's going to lose the word came to win amen it's the only thing that can win praise god it had to give way like brother said house of hell give way in the name of william branham in the name of jesus christ house of hell give way to the name of jesus amen and as long as there's faith in that word and as long as it's god's word spoken in god's season it's going to move the obstacles god is the mighty warrior amen he said heaven and earth will pass away jesus said but my word will never pass away so joshua knowing this that this word must rest upon god's word his word must rest upon god's word he put god's word first i wish you sick people god bless you brother jose it's hard being sick i wish when i was sick i'd speak god's word better wish you sick people here tonight would do that do what put god's word first he said put god's word with your confession put your confession you believe it and set it out there and call those things that are not as though they were then we're marching on do it that way god's word will take you through oh hallelujah church think about the obstacle you're going through think about the obstacle you're facing if you and i put the word of god first make sure it's first and make our confession match the word of god the word is going to go through even though it looks like it's impossible the word is going to go through because it's it's undefeatable praise god it's all powerful amen it is god's will it is god's desire and god's will must be done amen god's gonna take us through give way to the word of god hallelujah doubt fear right greed uncertainty sickness whatever it is it must give way to the word of god as the priest's feet touched the door and she just rolled back from side to side and the water stayed to realize the roaring of that river would have brought forth a bank there and 20 minutes time would have been as big as some of these modern dams that we got in colorado boulder dam out there way that was coming out of the mountains with great force she's sweeping through those valleys and then two million foot men with women and children could pass through there or what they gonna do uh what could you do with water right you guys went to the waterfall last weekend right on your little anniversary get away it's been a long time but i've been to water we went to waterfall a couple years ago out there west virginia and they said how many millions of gallons go down the waterfall every day or every minute and god said i'm stopping millions and millions of gallons oh my i'm stopping millions and millions of gallons so my people are saved god will stop traffic to protect you amen god will stop a flight from flying to let his prophet go on the right flag amen god will stop god will stop coronavirus amen from getting through your mask or whether you don't wear a mask at all god will stop it praise god because god is great and he's merciful it's all about the plan of god amen it's his plan if god can stop millions and millions and billions of gallons of water he can stop our mind battles praise god he can stop our financial trouble because he's god just take the word and go forward he said probably four or five hours do you think that river would have filled up but god stayed the stream he said stay in the streams he said oh i love that and she laid there until they passed over he said stream you just stay right there can you imagine just stay right there i wonder how many miles that went forth god said stream stay there i wonder how how many miles back god just he stopped everything he said you're just gonna stop or whatever is pushing you just stop just hold on for a few minutes i gotta take my little family across this river i knew god's going to bring your family across the river saints praise god however he does it he's going to bring you across the river because god's word is going to stay the storm praise god oh my now brother man this is for you buddy alright sister who this is for you we're gonna get to these memorials and just wait now let me get my previous slide there okay yeah almost a year ago brother bang april 19th i preached the first sermon on the book of philippians that's when we took that prayer call for the jose i'm about ready to wreck the erector memorial a memorial out there of that day anybody got any clay i'm gonna buy some modeling clay i'm gonna like make a model like this that goes all around like this i'm gonna start working on clay brother bang because after they get the victory they have to make a memorial we'll get to well god gave us a great victory on april 19th brother jose happened to have that william branham prayer cloth brother bang's dad had already been in the uh the hospital for i think a week or two weeks and uh i said brother i said brother i said brother jose go get that prayer cloth or brother bring that prayer cloth let's agree together in prayer i love how bang's hand is up in the air none of our other hands were up and they didn't have to be but i just appreciate because bang was gonna be the one that was gonna go take gonna go take the prayer cloth church the very next week i looked down i just watched these videos real quick i skipped the head i said hey i said sister how's your dad doing he's talking oh praise the lord so less than a week after vang we pray for that prayer cloth he laid it on his dad i think he laid there for two days his dad woke up less than a week later he was already talking after after dying being brought back to life for the medics right and then being in a coma less than a week later after that he was already talking praise god i skipped ahead two weeks and he's already home and he was in a coma and the doctor said take out the plug right uh unplug him let him die and bang said no see so bang come up to this river right ben came up to a river praise god amen and he brought the ark the word in that form it was a form of a prayer cloth brother jose that you felt led to get from brother uh george smith was it george smith yeah brother and son-in-law and we put the word first we just came up here we put the word first and let's see if this word will move this jordan river praise god amen i didn't have to but we prayed lord if it be your will move this river and the impossible happened amen because god's word cannot fail amen hallelujah so i just want to make a maybe i was going to hire my children maybe to make me a a model of that i'm about ready to set up oreo in this church here now i know peter said the same thing he said lord let's build three tabernacles but it's a little different in this case because we didn't see jesus in a vision right but god did bring us through a great river right sister right great faith you had that whole situation but church god does this great miracle and then he tells them build a memorial like this one from iwo jima that was the second maokai told me the second flag they raised at iwo jima and this was erected to honor all the fallen marines since the 1775 i think was but it was specifically for that picture from iwo jima where they have tens of thousands of soldiers died on the beaches right malcolm was it thousands tens of thousands yeah those men just walked into death they just they got the boats and just walked into death and it wasn't an easy battle right it was months it was weeks of taking weeks of battles maybe months until they were finally able to say we've taken over this this island and because they got victory on the island they won the war amen church if god gives us little victories you know we're going to win the war praise god i didn't hear you if god gave us these victories in our lives and and times that we get the victory you know the rest of the battle is going to be now praise god because god doesn't lose praise the lord so see in joshua 4 they get this great victory in joshua 3. now i'm not starting a memorial doctrine okay so just say you know i'm not starting to but i just think i may want to do that i might do that we'll see because i just uh here here's why i mean that i don't want to forget what god has done and that morning that sermon my whole message was on god had uh god was taking sides with jesus you know the brother man was taking sides with jesus it was all on how god's those little book of acts churches like the the church at philippi and we were one of those little book of acts churches that's what the sermon was about i kind of gave the background of how the philippian church started they cast out devils you know lydia there was the first convert you know lydia i said we are just one of those book of acts churches and then we have a need there we have one of these great mighty rivers and we apply the word of god the word goes before us and gains a great victory for us oh hallelujah praise god amen now joshua 4 1-9 we see in this that god commands a memorial of 12 stones the size a man could carry on his shoulder as a sign of his power now johnny is a great big man right but we're not all strong like him so picture about what size could he put of a stone on his shoulder i remember israel wasn't very big either right saul was the biggest one of all they were gonna and god said i've done a great thing here i've held back the waters i brought all my people through i don't want you to forget what i've done for you church because we're we're human we're gonna forget after a while right we remember how god healed banging who is dead but then we'll have a little trouble and we'll forget all about that what didn't god just do something great you ever feel like israel sometimes god brought me through the red sea but i forgot what he you know i forgot about that the next child i had now i need bread now i need water now it's hot now i need clothes you know we forget so quickly and god understands that but we must not complain we must learn to remember more praise god we must keep coming back to god so god will stir us up by way of remembrance amen now there's one of two interpretations either there's two two memorials that joshua sets up or there's a translation error so my opinion is they set up two memorials but i could be wrong because the scripture says let's look at verse uh joshua 4 1. [Music] so in verse 3 the bible said and ye command you them saying take ye hence out of the midst of jordan uh the place where the priests stood firm 12 stones you should carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night which was going to be gilgal okay verse four then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared for the of the children of israel out of every tribe of man and joshua said unto them passover before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come say what mean ye by these stones so this memorial was going to be a sign for the children but i'll say it like this i was probably good for the adults too right any honest adult would say well yeah i struggle too sometimes i forget what god has done sometimes i forget to call upon the name of the lord and the church said amen but especially for these children in other words god cared about the children amen god wanted the children to know that he's faithful and that as he was with their parents so he'll be with them verse 7 then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off from before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for memorial under the children of israel forever verse 9. yeah i'm going to skip down to verse 9 and joshua's up 12 stones see here's where it says in the midst of jordan now the translators what they say maybe they met from the midst of jordan or they took them from or so instead of the word in the translate some people say well they translate it wrong they should have put the word from it could be but uh but you know there's some statements in the church age book where brother graham said there could have been a better translation than the king james that's possible but i just tend to believe they set up two different memorials one right there at the river when they crossed over he said in the midst of jordans that must have been a pretty pretty tall memorial in the midst of jordan and then another at gilgal that's verse 9. and joshua set up 12 stone the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priest which bear the ark of the covenant stood and there i'm sorry and they are there unto this day and so vang i just you know i'm gonna go back there real quick i forgot to say this it's almost been a year brother today's may 2nd it's almost been a year since your dad got home praise god isn't that awesome just to see that here we are a year later are we still standing is god still the victorious god hallelujah he's faithful i thought wow that's so so striking today's may may 2nd we were rejoicing that he'd been brought home now see here at church they they cross and then they they went to gilgal which was in the plain before jericho so now they're going to go up to gilgal in joshua chapter four okay now in joshua 4 it's either one of the others so joshua 4 9 says they set stones in the midst of jordan where the priest's feet bear the ark of the lord but verse 20 says those 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal so gilgal wasn't the same as jordan right jordan had its own location the river so it looks like they either set up two uh memorials or there's a translation error so i just believe there's i could be wrong but i believe there's two two memorials now i don't know i've been here do you guys remember this when you went to the ark you guys remember that remember that yeah i remember that too i was like why do they got 12 stones there yeah kentucky that's right so this is the ark encounter in kentucky and i just want to i just want to kind of give you uh uh uh just a modern day kind of example okay what it might have looked like because i went online i was looking for ron ron white remember ron white he said he found the ark of the covenant and he passed away now he was a famous archaeologist well christian archaeologist he said he found uh the chariots that were in the red sea and i don't know he might have anyways i was looking on his website i couldn't find anything about the 12 stones but i just found how this ministry built up the 12 stones and just wanted to give you an idea about what that might look like now here's a comparison so here's here where's an adult uh okay here's some adults so you know this memorial is about this high you know these are children and that's at the ark there in kentucky so just just to kind of give you an idea what this uh what this memorial would have looked like and when the children walk by they say what is this all about oh this is when the lord this this reminds us the lord he moved back though he held back all the waters on this rushing mighty river and we came across in other words god made the way god was real in my generation and god is real in your generation if god brought me through my trials god will bring you son through your trials amen oh glory praise god god made sure you i want a physical reminder of what i've done don't forget now here's where clark says yeah clark believed you know clark said that may have been a translation here i'm not going to spend much time on that okay now back to this now church what's our lesson in joshua 4 1-9 we need to remember his faithfulness and verbalize it right we need to constantly testify about what god has done okay because your previous victories will be fuel for your future victories amen right that's what god said remember he said by this you'll know that i will defeat the hivites the canaanites the parasites all of these great mighty nations which are bigger than you the way you know you're going to overcome them is but by what i did on this day when i brought you through into the baptism of the holy ghost praise god amen in other words if i sealed your soul with the baptism of the holy ghost there's no complex there's no disease there's there's no temptation that can overcome you because you're more than a conqueror he brought you through he's already paved the way before you his will is for you to possess all the land amen that's his will his will is not for you and i to be defeated but his will is for us to be conquerors and overcome the gates of our enemies amen hallelujah that's what he said he said my seed will defeat the enemies in their gates praise god right you're going to possess the gates of your enemies hallelujah that's why i'm not defeated by depression like my dad because i'm possessing the gates of my enemies praise god praise the lord that's why i'm not defeated in denomination like my mothers and i love them i love them i've already told them these things you know that's why i'm not defeated because we are possessors of the promises we obey we put the word first before us amen we make sure the word of god is first in our lives and by that word we are made to conquer christ makes us conquerors in this life by the word of god go to second peter chapter one sorry i don't mean to huff and puff so loud like that if anybody knew about bad memories it was peter saints can you imagine cussing out people the night the lord was arrested imagine that you imagine not being able to testify to a little maid girl which they say was probably like a pre-teenaged girl he i don't even know jesus he preached for jesus for three and a half years and then he says i don't even know him i don't know the man he walked on water i don't know that man that saved me from drowning can you imagine that church if anybody need to know about the power of remembering the right memories it was peter just like paul satan could have just overcome him well look what you did you arrested them you brought them into the prisons there's an hour here bear with me you dragged them to prison you tried to say would say you tried to get my people or god's people to blaspheme the name of jesus and you say you're a preacher of jesus look what you did see when satan brings back all these memories we bring up his future right right when he tries to bring up your best bring up his future right but you also have to remember what god's brought you through you also got to remember your jordan river amen you got to remember that god brought you cross jordan by a supernatural move of god by the word of god amen that's right church you got to remind satan of his future but you've got to remind satan of what god did for you in the past as well that's how you overcome the hivites the parasites the temptationites the greedites the lustites praise the lord the pride ites there we go pride the lazy ice hallelujah the the fearites the scaredy-cat heights all these things the angerites right as we start on wednesday uh the discriminates discrimination right like peter's discriminated against the gentiles sometimes we treat the rich people or the nice looking people we treat them better than people that aren't so nice looking or not not so rich sometimes we do that but we've got a great power to overcome those devils praise god amen amen peter ii peter chapter 1 13. now look at the next look at the definition of stir stir is to wake up from your sleep like jesus waking up jesus on in the boat remember that one buddy i remember you enjoyed that sermon that's why i said i'm sure everybody else enjoyed it too but i remember we talked about it so he said stir up your minds wake up your mind in other words we're kind of sleeping to what we should be thinking about right we should we should have alert minds i should be purposely thinking about the memorials of god but instead it's like my my spiritual mind is asleep and i've forgotten all the great things god has done anybody guilty of that don't say amen don't say amen we all get guilty of it that's why a holy ghost to a man like peter would say stir your minds up by way of remembrance i hope the holy spirit is speaking to somebody today by god's grace i trust that if you're going through you have a river before you some travel for you you are more than a conqueror church you put the word first put the word first only be strong and very courageous ii peter one now this is of course the most what a beautiful chapter one of my favorite chapters the statue perfect man it's a tremendous revelation we know that verse 13. now don't don't forget though verse uh i want to back up a little bit look at verse 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins see when people feel like well maybe i'm not saved they've stopped adding the anointing of the holy ghost to their life when they stop adding those anointings when they stop adding more knowledge god give me more knowledge god give me more patience god give me more temperance more self-control when they stop adding those things they lose the anointing and they start thinking i'm not even saved peter says it right there because he went through it oh that's right he went through it praise god he didn't just get sad the bible said he went bitterly when he denied the lord he bitterly wept he was crying it was so it was such an awful thing how could i do this he realized that he lost the power of god now look at verse 10 wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall that's a great revelation with the mystery of godliness how much effort is required to be godly all of it i'm going to say that again i like that how much of your effort do you need to be like christ all of it you're not saved by your effort you're saved by repenting right you're saved by grace through faith but you become like christ by your effort by surrendering by giving all of your heart soul mind and strength jesus said love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength that's what you are overcoming by by purposely choosing to let god's spirit lead and guide you by putting the word first first in your thoughts first in your word first in your hope first in the car first everywhere put the word of god first he'll bring you through that's right if you do these things you'll never fall like joshua if you keep the word first you're never going to fall short look at verse 12 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things remember peter's he's going to keep returning to the statue of man he's going to keep returning you need more anointing amen you need more of god's power in your life i'm going to keep reminding you because i know what it's like to lose power and make myself ashamed right to shame myself i know what it's like to let down the bars and lose the power of god and i will i don't want you to do that i want you to be overcoming i want you to constantly grow the bible said grace and peace be multiplied you he said every promise of god is given by promise that we can inherit all things praise god he said though you know them be established in the present truth yeah i think it me as long as i'm in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance so hot peter says how do we stir people up make them remember what god has done make them remember what god has done hallelujah how many want faith that's awake and not sleeping amen i'm talking about faith now faith we're all awake today by god's grace but sometimes i put those little kids asleep back there my own my own and some other ones sometimes i put them asleep but the bible said he said stir up your faith by way of remembrance and he says in verse 14 knowing that i must put off this tabernacle i'm going to die soon even as our lord jesus christ has shown me verse 15 moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have all these things always in remembrance so church that's one reason we come to church for more faith and the church said amen you come here for more faith i trust you got a little faith injection today by god's grace for more virtue for more knowledge right for more temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness more charity amen he said always remember to do this if not you'll forget the power of god you'll forget what god has done he said but constantly add more power to your life and an entrance will be made for you in the kingdom of god and of his christ thank you lord chapter 3 verse 1. i don't know there's something about the last few months but the more i read i'm in john right now i have john and acts and i've read the bible again a whole time so i've read the whole bible and i'm in john and i got to go to acts after that i've highlighted the whole bible i'm going to move on to a new bible i always like that because i can get a brand new fresh vibe on i'm going to i'm going to actually this one's running out so i'm going to put all my marks from here that's my plan at least i'm going to try to put all my marks in there so i can put in the next bible and carry on these these things that have touched my heart over the years but i'm always amazed especially this week reading and john of all the things i've forgotten about jesus and i love reading them again like the man i read this man this morning about the man that was born blind they said who sinned this man or his parents jesus said none of them he said this was done for the glory of god hallelujah and the parents were like hey we don't know that's him he's of age and the the they said oh well jesus is of the devil he said how can a man that's of a devil open my eyes amen and how do you not know where he come from praise god he see he had the man with the miracle had the faith amen he had faith build up because look what jesus has done for me he's overcome my great jordan river praise god he's brought me through the blindness he's brought me through uh this denominational church criticism amen and i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus hallelujah chapter 3 peter ii peter chapter 3 verse 1. this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that these they shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and this was our text from last week right with the false prophets and false teachers i'm sorry that was chapter two that's chapter two sorry now look at that church did you catch that that you may be mindful of all the prophets in verse two that's all the old testament and he said all the words of our lord that's new testament and uh the apostles that's new testament too so peter's saying i'm going to stir you up by remembering all these old testament prophets plus jesus's words plus paul's words you got to remember all of it and the church said we got to remember all of it amen remember all the word of god he said that will stir you up about the last time you felt oh my faith was stirred up oh it's awake it used to be asleep but now it's awake render active when was your faith active right when was the last time you were ready to go pray for somebody that was sick remember when was last time your faith was really active and ready to go correct something that was wrong see that's active faith this is what uh peter's calling us to faith that's active remembering and that stirs us up to action like i was telling you out in iowa i preached that little message on sunday morning somebody was live streaming they said instantly after the service they called up two people to make things right that they'd done wrong with business some money or something like that on church that's active faith right that is a mind that is stirred up i'm ready to act amen in other words i won't waste another day praise god i won't race another church service amen i'm going to make this right my faith is going to act upon the word of god i'm putting the word first and the water's got to be pushed back brother man talks about a backslidden church here in tennessee he said he said oh the spirit of god comes and shows his presence these people just set quiet and never seem to be thrilled about your spirit just falls he said what's entered their church this tennessee church greed selfishness ministers at each other's throats can you imagine that oh what a condition be merciful lord what can we do so what what can they what can brother brahm do he said we pray lord that this call now may there souls that can remember a former day how is brother i'm going to help a church that has preachers at their throats remember the previous days that can read the bible and know that god's in his sanctuary may their soul so thirst to be like that lord to see the great power displayed again how can we fix these church problems these preacher problems remember what it was like before the problems happened pretty simple very simple men and women here have come so cold and indifferent until they really seem to think they're doing all right is that is that true lukewarmness when people are lukewarm they think they're all right but their faith is asleep they need stirred up because there's problems there's greediness there's selfishness there's fights among the preachers or people shake their souls tonight lord shake wake them up wake them up and may they smell the breeze from a cooling stream of peace again long and satisfy their thirsting and surrender their lives to thee lord stir them up like the eagle does her nest what's the eagle do they take out everything that's comfortable in their life the eagle takes out all the soft uh branches and then it's just the the pokey ones right and then that makes the eagles want to get out make it so easy for them you make next time i pray for you churchill next time you pray for me let's be let's let's listen how what what what words we use but man i said make it so miserable for these backslidden people that they'll be willing no matter who's sitting there they'll be willing to come raise their hands and say wash me lord try me if there be any false in me take it away and purge me oh god while there's time for purging while the fountain is open granite lord how about that see if god loves you and you're backslidden or you know somebody's backslidden god's gonna make it miserable for them we we want to do everything we can to try to ease the burdens and church sometimes we might but god is like an eagle mother right eagle father he's going to make it miserable until that drives them to remember what they used to have and repent and say wash me lord i'm the guilty one see god works different from us doesn't he in chapter 4 verses 10 to 19 everyone passes over as god magnifies joshua as he did moses israel camps and gilgal on the east side of jericho i love this let's read chapter four let's read the end of this and we'll close you that's about an hour and yeah i'm at hour 15. good joshua 4. when god makes a memorial church it's it's for his people yes it's for his people but it's also for the world when god does something great he means for you yes to tell your children and their children but he also means for the whole world to know of his power and to testify of his glory yesterday i went to aldi you know and i was had my jesus hat on i got i got a hat that just says jesus on it now people are looking at my clothes like money i got jesus on my shirt and i'm just i'm

left social media back in january but i might go back there just to testify about jesus i'm i'm going to pray about it just to tell them i know my last post was a post about jesus christ repenting and giving giving your life to the lord i didn't plan that but then i just deleted my facebook account after that back in january but the whole world needs to know what god has done in our lives right
