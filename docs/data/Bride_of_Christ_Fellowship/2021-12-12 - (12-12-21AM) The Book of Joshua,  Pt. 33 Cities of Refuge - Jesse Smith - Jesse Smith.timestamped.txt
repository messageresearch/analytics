[37:22] thank you brother appreciate that buzz
[37:23] david joshua chapter 20 verse 1.
[37:31] and we'll
[37:33] let's look at this book of joshua here
[37:34] this morning and
[37:38] the thought is we like to look at the
[37:39] thought of the cities of refuge
[37:42] so we'll look at that as like our
[37:43] sub-topic the cities of
[37:48] refuge okay
[37:55] all right joshua chapter 20.
[38:00] all right verse
[38:01] verse one and we'll read down here i'll
[38:03] read down to verse
[38:07] 6
[38:08] verses 1 to 6 and then we'll read this
[38:10] we'll have a word of prayer then we'll
[38:11] have everybody be seated
[38:12] by god's grace
[38:15] now let's all read verse six together
[38:18] after i read one through five so i'll
[38:19] read one through five then by myself and
[38:21] then verse six we'll all read out loud
[38:23] okay so the lord spake unto joshua
[38:25] saying
[38:26] speak to the children of israel saying
[38:28] a point out of you cities of refuge
[38:32] whereof i spake unto you by the hand of
[38:34] moses
[38:35] that the slayer that killeth any person
[38:37] unawares
[38:38] and unwittingly may flee thither and
[38:42] they shall be your refuge from the
[38:43] avenger of blood.
[38:46] verse 4 and when he that doth flee into
[38:49] one of these cities shall stand at the
[38:52] sorry she'll stand
[38:57] i'm sorry i lost my spot
[39:00] i'm going to go back in verse 4 and when
[39:02] he that doth flee unto one of those
[39:04] cities shall stand at the entering of
[39:06] the gate of the city and shall declare
[39:08] his cause in the ears of the elders of
[39:10] that city they shall take him into the
[39:12] city unto them and give him a place that
[39:14] he may dwell among them
[39:17] verse 5 and if the avenger of blood
[39:20] pursue after him
[39:21] then they shall not deliver the slayer
[39:24] up into his hand because he smote his
[39:26] neighbor unwittingly
[39:28] and hated him not a four time
[39:31] now let's read verse six together so can
[39:33] you put thank you honey let's read this
[39:35] on three one two three and he shall
[39:37] dwell in that city until he stand before
[39:41] the congregation for judgment and until
[39:44] the death of the high priest that shall
[39:47] be in those days then shall the slayer
[39:50] return and come unto his own city and
[39:53] unto his own house unto the city from
[39:56] whence he fled amen let's have a word of
[39:58] prayer before we're seated here and ask
[40:01] god to help us to
[40:03] understand the spirit of god's teaching
[40:05] from this this scripture here heavenly
[40:08] father lord we just bow our heads to you
[40:09] we thank you again for these songs lord
[40:11] god we thank you for the prayer request

[40:38] father and lord we give you all the
[40:39] glory we give you all the praise be
[40:41] magnified in the preaching of the word
[40:42] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[40:44] said
[40:45] amen god bless you as you're being
[40:46] seated praise god you can switch over
[40:48] here i have some notes i like to
[40:51] share i like to use like a powerpoint it
[40:52] kind of just slows me down and helps me
[40:54] to
[40:55] kind of clear out my thoughts a little
[40:57] bit
[40:59] so we're looking at part 3 or 33 today
[41:02] so since february we've been looking at
[41:04] the book of joshua we preached all the
[41:06] way through this now we haven't preached
[41:07] every single verse but we preach the
[41:09] main thoughts of this
[41:11] and
[41:12] i trust to be a blessing to you so
[41:14] here's just a little picture church if
[41:15] you wanted to just i'll reference this
[41:17] again but
[41:18] the point of this passage is that god
[41:20] set up cities in israel
[41:23] where you could
[41:25] flee to if you were in trouble
[41:28] if you accidentally murdered somebody
[41:30] and you didn't do it on purpose
[41:32] god had a place that you could go to to
[41:35] find mercy
[41:37] because in the old testament it was eye
[41:40] for an eye
[41:41] tooth for tooth in other words if you
[41:43] took out somebody's eye your eye had to
[41:45] be plucked out
[41:46] if you knocked out somebody's eye i'm
[41:48] sorry knocked out somebody's tooth
[41:50] rather you had to get your tooth knocked
[41:52] out
[41:53] it was uh it was there was it was law it
[41:55] wasn't grace it was law but even in this
[41:57] law god had some grace hiding in there
[42:01] god was hiding this as a place it was
[42:04] show for it was showing forth the grace
[42:06] to come in the new testament
[42:07] and we'll look at that so we see in the
[42:09] picture it looks like a woman here is
[42:10] running and you know these men have been
[42:12] chasing her like the arrows flies here
[42:14] and falls in the ground right before
[42:16] she reaches her uh her destination in
[42:19] other words it's a it's a drama right
[42:22] it's a dramatic experience
[42:24] i've done wrong and and uh and people
[42:27] are after me to kill me
[42:29] and rightfully so
[42:31] because i've killed someone else
[42:33] right
[42:34] but if i didn't do it on purpose there
[42:36] was a place i could run to
[42:38] it was called a city of refuge so we'll
[42:40] look at this thought here and
[42:42] we'll bring it down and how it applies
[42:44] to us in the new testament today
[42:48] now let me just background i want to
[42:49] background this here uh just real
[42:51] briefly
[42:52] uh that joshua
[42:54] was an old testament
[42:56] figure he was the prophet after moses so
[42:59] moses uh moses brought israel out of
[43:02] egypt through the exodus
[43:05] and and then uh
[43:07] moses brought them through the red sea
[43:09] god brought them or moses brought them
[43:11] all the way
[43:12] to we'd say like the edge of the
[43:13] promised land but then he died because
[43:16] he glorified himself moses glorified
[43:18] himself and so god would not let him in
[43:20] the promised land
[43:22] so god let moses die and then god raised
[43:24] up joshua
[43:25] and joshua was the next leader and
[43:27] joshua actually brought the people into
[43:30] all the promises
[43:32] that god had promised them amen
[43:35] and so you know moses of course
[43:38] was a type here of the old testament and
[43:41] jesus christ is the type of joshua in
[43:43] fact the name joshua means jehovah is
[43:47] our salvation
[43:49] okay
[43:50] and the name jesus is actually the greek
[43:53] form of joshua so joshua jesus's real
[43:57] name is joshua
[43:59] okay but in the greek you say joshua by
[44:02] jesus and so when they interpret the
[44:04] bible they didn't want to keep calling
[44:05] jesus joshua joshua they want a
[44:07] distinction between the old testament
[44:08] joshua and the new testament joshua amen
[44:12] so jesus christ is the new testament
[44:14] joshua
[44:15] the hebrew word is actually yeshua
[44:18] yeshua is how you say jesus name in
[44:20] hebrew or joshua's name in hebrew
[44:22] so joshua was a foreshadow of jesus
[44:25] christ how the holy spirit was going to
[44:27] bring us into the promises of god amen
[44:31] hallelujah that's why joshua's such an
[44:32] amazing person
[44:34] brother austin he defeated 31 kings
[44:37] 31 kings he defeated joshua did and that
[44:41] and he defeated all the kings that god
[44:43] had him that god had called him to
[44:45] defeat and that's a type of jesus christ
[44:48] jesus christ spirit will cause us to
[44:49] defeat every enemy before us amen
[44:52] every foe shall be defeated in the name
[44:55] of joshua amen in other words the name
[44:58] of jesus christ amen
[45:00] every every enemy will be defeated by
[45:03] the holy spirit praise god amen
[45:06] part of me
[45:07] so joshua fulfilled the third step in
[45:10] this exodus so i gotta uh
[45:14] remember the scripture deuteronomy 6
[45:16] verse 22 22-23
[45:18] god shows us an exodus requires it
[45:21] requires coming out of egypt but it also
[45:24] requires going into the promised land
[45:26] amen
[45:27] and the lord showed signs and wonders
[45:29] and great and sore upon egypt upon
[45:32] pharaoh and upon all's household before
[45:34] our eyes he brought us out from fence he
[45:37] brought us out of egypt that he might
[45:40] bring us in
[45:41] to give us the land which he swear unto
[45:43] our
[45:44] fathers so i just want to show this here
[45:47] as a beautiful this is a type church
[45:50] this is a three-step type
[45:52] so here's egypt moses brought israel out
[45:56] of egypt but he just didn't bring them
[45:58] out to stay in the wilderness god wanted
[46:00] to take them somewhere
[46:03] right so that's the first step was
[46:04] bringing them out the second step was
[46:06] bringing him through the red sea
[46:08] and the wilderness and then the third
[46:10] step is what joshua accomplished there's
[46:12] basically three steps coming out
[46:14] going through the wilderness and then
[46:16] entering in praise god
[46:18] and so moses did the first two
[46:21] he brought him out and he brought him
[46:22] through the red sea to the wilderness
[46:24] but then god had to raise up joshua to
[46:26] bring them into the third step
[46:28] which we know is a type of the baptism
[46:31] of the holy ghost amen
[46:33] so let me
[46:34] in other words god always uses three
[46:36] steps to do something
[46:39] right just like a baby's born first the
[46:41] water breaks
[46:43] and then there's blood and then there's
[46:45] the breath of life there's always three
[46:47] steps praise god
[46:49] i'm going to skip down here israel what
[46:51] we're talking about israel left egypt
[46:53] that was the first step
[46:55] next they went out in the wilderness and
[46:56] the third step they took the promised
[46:58] land
[46:59] that's what joshua did joshua took him
[47:01] to the promised land now that was a
[47:03] representation of us being born
[47:05] spiritually
[47:07] we're all born naturally but god wants
[47:09] us to be born spiritually praise god so
[47:12] the first thing is we get justified we
[47:14] get saved that's what the word justified
[47:15] means saved and forgiven praise god
[47:18] that's when you get baptized
[47:20] that's when you come out of here so so
[47:22] right here's where they cross the red
[47:23] sea they think at least i know it's a
[47:25] great debate
[47:26] about where they crossed it but they
[47:28] come out and they cross through the
[47:30] water this water represents their
[47:31] baptism
[47:33] so see that's when you get saved you
[47:34] repent of your sins and when you go take
[47:36] him and baptize you in the lake praise
[47:38] god in the name of jesus christ because
[47:40] you're deciding i'm leaving the world
[47:42] i'm being i'm living a new life i'm
[47:44] making an exodus from the sinful life
[47:47] that i used to live i'm leaving that and
[47:49] i'm going forward in the promises of god
[47:52] so that's where we get water baptism
[47:54] from
[47:55] they cross through the waters as a water
[47:57] baptism unto moses amen and that's in
[48:01] the first corinthians chapter 10 praise
[48:03] god
[48:04] now the second stage was sad you know
[48:06] they went up there to cadiz barnea
[48:08] but then they turned down the
[48:09] opportunity to go into the promised land
[48:11] so they wandered back out here wandered
[48:13] around here for 40 years and after moses
[48:16] died they finally were able to go up to
[48:18] uh
[48:19] jordan river and cross into jordan
[48:22] so this represents a christian life
[48:24] first we got to come out we got to leave
[48:26] our sinful life we got to get saved
[48:29] baptized in water and then we start
[48:31] going through the wilderness praise god
[48:33] all the tests of faith all the trials of
[48:36] faith
[48:37] right all the all the battles they had
[48:39] they'd battled numerous kings amalek
[48:41] moab yeah moses fought numerous battles
[48:44] and so did joshua
[48:45] they had to fight numerous battles in
[48:47] order to get to the promised land but
[48:50] once they got to the promised land the
[48:51] ark took them over can i say like this
[48:54] the bible takes you over amen
[48:56] the bible the ark of god the presence of
[48:58] god right this represents god's word
[49:00] god's presence the ark of god if you put
[49:02] it first if you put it on your shoulders
[49:04] if you exalt the word of god god's word
[49:06] will take you into the promised land
[49:08] amen
[49:09] it'll take you into the baptism of the
[49:10] holy ghost just put god's word first
[49:13] just carry god's word amen exalt it lift
[49:15] it high amen live it carry it and let
[49:18] the word of god take you into what god
[49:20] has planned for your life
[49:22] amen
[49:24] hallelujah
[49:26] now there was also three steps to
[49:28] cleaning out the tabernacle outer court
[49:31] holy place holiest of holies
[49:34] god cleans the earth through three steps
[49:36] noah's flood jesus's blood and then the
[49:39] fire that burns the earth after the
[49:42] battle of armageddon so then god can
[49:44] bring his people down in the millennium
[49:45] and live on this uh cleaned off earth
[49:48] now
[49:49] there's all and there's here's another
[49:50] way to look at the three steps of grace
[49:53] new heart ezekiel said i'm going to give
[49:55] you a new heart new spirit and then my
[49:57] spirit will cause you to keep my
[49:59] commands
[50:00] that's again justification
[50:02] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[50:04] ghost jesus said it's the three works of
[50:06] grace are like a wheat plant first you
[50:09] have the blade right that first little
[50:10] blade out of the ground then you have
[50:12] the ear and then you have the full corn
[50:15] hallelujah
[50:17] and then jesus said there's three steps
[50:18] to heaven i am the way i am the truth
[50:21] and the life he said sanctify them
[50:23] through the truth thy word is truth amen
[50:27] and then he says the life is the baptism
[50:29] of the holy ghost so three steps i hope
[50:31] that helps you understand now
[50:34] now
[50:36] scripture is clear church that people
[50:38] sometimes can fall short of god's
[50:40] promises because god's promises are
[50:42] conditional
[50:44] in other words all israel church 2
[50:46] million people were promised to make it
[50:48] here but only 2 out of those 2 million
[50:50] did
[50:51] did you know that
[50:52] moses brought two million people out
[50:54] brother but they all died except
[50:56] joshua and caleb they're the only ones
[50:58] that went over
[51:00] see so in other words god's promises are
[51:03] conditional they're only going to be
[51:04] fulfilled by those who believe them amen
[51:09] right
[51:10] two million people came out only two
[51:12] made it now what as the two million died
[51:14] there rose up another generation
[51:17] so there was about two million people
[51:18] that actually went in but they were
[51:20] younger people in other words the older
[51:22] generation that didn't obey all the word
[51:24] of god they died god let them die
[51:26] because they didn't believe it
[51:28] they were scared of the giants they were
[51:29] scared of the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:31] but we can't be scared of it amen
[51:33] we we should fear no man we should only
[51:35] fear god amen
[51:37] we should not fear any man or any
[51:39] situation and we should not fear any
[51:41] problem we should just trust god and
[51:43] know that god is going to bring us
[51:45] through amen
[51:46] hallelujah how's that how's that volume
[51:48] sound back there some okay pretty good
[51:50] hopefully it sounds good for our you our
[51:52] live streamers because it looks like we
[51:53] got a lot of sick people today in the
[51:54] church
[51:55] we're almost empty amen
[51:57] uh
[51:58] so hopefully they're enjoying it and can
[52:00] hear it
[52:02] so this is our life god brings us out of
[52:04] egypt right out of our sins we get
[52:07] baptized and we we we progress we make
[52:09] our way into the promised land and then
[52:11] once we're in is life easy no we're not
[52:14] really life starts getting more battles
[52:16] praise god because once they got in
[52:19] that's when joshua started really
[52:20] fighting
[52:22] but you've got power to overcome amen
[52:25] hallelujah
[52:27] so joshua fought a couple battles out
[52:28] here but he thought he fought 31 kings
[52:32] inside his baptism of the holy ghost
[52:34] experience
[52:35] at church that's what we've done too
[52:37] we've had we'd have battle off pride we
[52:39] have to battle off arrogance and and
[52:41] complexes and mind battles and lust
[52:43] spirits and greed spirits but god has
[52:47] brought us through every single one just
[52:49] like joshua said the holy spirit said no
[52:52] man will be able to stand before you all
[52:54] the days of your life if you just
[52:56] meditate on the word and that's what we
[52:58] found in church we're able to have a
[52:59] church we're able to have uh believers
[53:02] and the devil can't defeat him because
[53:04] they meditate on god's word and all
[53:06] their foes bow at their feet all the
[53:08] foes bow and all the foes flee because
[53:11] jesus is fighting our battles amen
[53:14] hallelujah
[53:15] praise god amen
[53:18] and that's what we do we put our trust
[53:19] in jesus christ and he'll make every
[53:21] enemy fall before our feet
[53:24] amen
[53:27] that's the beauty of being a christian
[53:28] praise god he makes you more than a
[53:30] conqueror in christ jesus now here let
[53:32] me show you those these three scriptures
[53:33] though
[53:34] these scriptures show that people can
[53:36] start in the promises of god but if they
[53:38] don't get born again they can fall away
[53:40] and be lost
[53:42] just like just like this one there was 2
[53:45] million people that died before they got
[53:46] here 2 million
[53:49] right now some of them were believers
[53:50] like moses and miriam and aaron good
[53:52] believers but the majority of them the
[53:54] bible said were unbelievers and died
[53:58] so let me prove it to you okay the first
[53:59] one now here's a very serious scripture
[54:02] here
[54:04] of how much sore punishment in hebrews
[54:06] chapter 10 verse 29
[54:08] suppose ye shall he be thought worthy
[54:11] who hath trod and under foot the son of
[54:13] god and hath counted the blood of the
[54:15] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[54:18] an unholy thing and hath done despite
[54:20] unto the spirit of grace
[54:24] so the example of this is judas iscariot
[54:27] judas iscariot preached with jesus for
[54:29] three and a half years he cast out
[54:31] devils he raised the dead but at the end
[54:33] of jesus ministry he
[54:36] he found a plan can i sell out jesus
[54:38] i'll bring jesus to you if you give me
[54:39] 30 pieces of silver
[54:42] so he started right he started with a
[54:43] sincere heart but then he sold out jesus
[54:46] for money
[54:49] but see the the what we're supposed to
[54:51] do is sell out the world for jesus amen
[54:53] hallelujah that's what austin did when
[54:55] he got rid of all those music see you
[54:57] sold out the world and now you're
[54:58] serving jesus amen
[55:00] see that's exactly what we have to do we
[55:02] have to sell out the world he desires
[55:05] and follow jesus but judas did the
[55:07] opposite he started good but then at the
[55:10] end of his life he he stopped going on
[55:12] he stopped progressing towards the
[55:14] baptism of the holy ghost
[55:16] and he turned on jesus at the end and
[55:18] said i'd rather have 30 pieces of silver
[55:20] than jesus and it's it's as if he took
[55:23] jesus's blood and threw it on the ground
[55:26] and stomped on us and i don't want this
[55:27] anymore i want the money
[55:29] and the bible said this kind of person
[55:31] that does this will have a sore
[55:32] punishment in hell
[55:34] because they started off leaving egypt
[55:36] but they never got to jericho oh god
[55:39] help us to get to jericho help us to get
[55:40] in the promised land so we can really
[55:42] fight for god live for god and we can
[55:45] find our place of rest amen because once
[55:48] they defeated all the enemies the bible
[55:50] said now it's time to rest amen now it's
[55:52] time to rest and enjoy the land enjoy
[55:54] your families enjoy your homes enjoy the
[55:56] good land that god has given you and
[55:58] praise the name of the lord all the days
[56:00] of your life
[56:04] so see there are great punishments for
[56:06] despising god's gifts
[56:08] or god's covenant
[56:11] so let me go back to this and just let
[56:12] me just give a picture again so it's
[56:14] like judas got saved the bible said
[56:16] judas iscariot baptized people the bible
[56:19] said jesus baptized nobody but his
[56:21] disciples baptized people so judas came
[56:23] all the way here can i say like this
[56:25] judas came to kadesh barnea
[56:27] and said well i can't i don't want to
[56:28] get born again i'd rather get money
[56:31] whatever it was fearful he was probably
[56:33] fearful because remember he gave the
[56:34] money back
[56:35] he was probably fearful about his future
[56:37] and if jesus was going to be king or not
[56:39] so he sold out jesus for money and then
[56:41] he died he never made it into the
[56:43] promised land
[56:44] oh but thank god even though some people
[56:46] made mistakes like peter peter denied
[56:48] christ but yet peter found a way to
[56:50] repent and say i'm sorry lord forgive me
[56:53] and then he found himself going into the
[56:54] promised land on the day of pentecost
[56:57] hallelujah praise god and he was the
[56:59] spokesman on the day of pentecost as
[57:01] well so don't be discouraged by your
[57:03] failures just say i'm sorry lord give me
[57:05] another chance and god will speak
[57:07] through you again
[57:09] hallelujah
[57:11] it looked it looked like peter was more
[57:13] uh or just as wicked as jesus because he
[57:15] denied jesus three times
[57:18] i don't know him i don't know the man he
[57:20] cussed and swear i don't know that man
[57:22] and yet god forgave him amen
[57:25] but judas just won the money and he and
[57:27] he never he never repents he never came
[57:29] back to god
[57:31] oh there's hope for us how many believe
[57:32] there's grace today for us amen there's
[57:35] grace church if you want grace there's
[57:36] grace for you praise god
[57:38] but the bible said there's people like
[57:40] judas who they they were look they were
[57:42] even sanctified they got all the way to
[57:45] the wilderness
[57:46] but then they they said this i don't i
[57:48] don't want to live this anymore i don't
[57:50] believe this anymore and they stomped on
[57:52] it and they said i'm not going to live a
[57:53] holy life they're speaking bad about
[57:54] jesus people do that today the bible
[57:57] says you can crucify jesus today
[58:00] how do you know that
[58:02] let's look at it uh
[58:04] it's hebrews chapter six if you got your
[58:06] bibles there i'll pull it up here so you
[58:08] can see it
[58:11] do you know that jesus was crucified 2
[58:13] 000 years ago but people crucify or kill
[58:16] the effects of his holy spirit today
[58:22] let me say like that that's what katy
[58:24] perry did that's what beyonce did
[58:26] they were raising church that's what
[58:28] aretha franklin did
[58:31] they knew uh whitney houston we could
[58:33] just start naming them all off they all
[58:35] started in church
[58:37] but at some point they said i'd rather
[58:38] have money
[58:40] than jesus and what they do they they
[58:42] trampled on that they sing about sex
[58:44] they sing about drugs they sing about
[58:46] immorality
[58:48] and if they're not careful what they've
[58:50] done is they've crucified the effects of
[58:52] the holy spirit in their lives and like
[58:54] whitney houston died in the bathtub
[58:58] uh high and drunk with a heart attack
[59:00] elvis presley died on a toilet stool
[59:02] saying he was the king of rock
[59:05] what a lie
[59:06] see what have they done they crucified
[59:08] the effects of the gospel to themselves
[59:12] in other words we can't crucify the
[59:13] gospel we've got to crucify our desires
[59:16] amen
[59:17] we've got to daily crucify not what
[59:18] jesse wants but i'm going to do what god
[59:20] wants to do amen that's crucifixion amen
[59:23] a daily crucifixion praise god
[59:27] look at look what the bible says this is
[59:28] just like
[59:31] this is just like the bible says
[59:33] uh and have tasted anyone who's tasted
[59:35] the good word of god and the powers of
[59:37] the world to come if they shall fall
[59:38] away to renew them again unto repentance
[59:40] seeing they crucified to themselves the
[59:42] son of god afresh
[59:44] and put him to an open shame
[59:47] see any any woman any singer any famous
[59:50] singer katy perry she started in the
[59:51] church right
[59:53] and she tried to make it with the
[59:54] christian contemporary music but she
[59:56] wasn't popular so she she actually it's
[59:58] all there's a video on youtube she said
[1:00:00] i sold my soul to the devil and now look
[1:00:02] at her now
[1:00:04] she lost her soul
[1:00:08] and what has she done she'd crucify
[1:00:09] because she couldn't get famous through
[1:00:11] the christian music she crucified the
[1:00:13] gospel and don't sing about the gospel
[1:00:14] she sings about lesbian works
[1:00:17] right
[1:00:19] and she's not careful she don't repent
[1:00:21] she'll be lost for crucifying jesus
[1:00:23] christ the effects of it not living it
[1:00:26] not believing it and not sharing it
[1:00:28] thank god that we live it we believe it
[1:00:30] we share it let's always do that praise
[1:00:32] god
[1:00:33] let's try to get people saved by the
[1:00:35] grace of god
[1:00:38] see so this is a very real picture
[1:00:40] church
[1:00:42] oh what did i have done okay there we go
[1:00:45] i actually i almost erased it now here's
[1:00:47] one that specifically says
[1:00:49] after god brought israel out he
[1:00:51] destroyed those that believe not
[1:00:55] now look he the bible says this letter
[1:00:57] was written shortly after christ for
[1:00:58] there are certain men crept in unawares
[1:01:00] they're creeping into your church who
[1:01:02] were before of old ordained this
[1:01:04] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:01:06] grace of our god into lashiviousness
[1:01:08] that means lawlessness
[1:01:09] so anybody that says oh you can be a
[1:01:11] christian it's okay to do whatever you
[1:01:13] don't have to really obey this
[1:01:14] they're turning grace into lawlessness
[1:01:17] and they'll be condemned at the day of
[1:01:18] judgment for that
[1:01:21] and denying the only lord god in our
[1:01:23] lord jesus christ i will therefore put
[1:01:25] you in remembrance that though ye once
[1:01:27] knew this how the lord listen having
[1:01:29] saved the people out of the land of
[1:01:31] egypt afterward destroyed them that
[1:01:33] believe not
[1:01:35] in other words a lot of people start
[1:01:37] serving god but you can't stop serving
[1:01:39] god you got to continue serving god amen
[1:01:43] you got to say i'm not just going to
[1:01:44] serve god for five years i'm going to
[1:01:46] serve god all of my years
[1:01:48] i'm going to give god all my strength
[1:01:50] all of my youth amen i'm glad i got
[1:01:52] saved at 19 amen i was able to give god
[1:01:54] all these years of my youth now i'm 41
[1:01:56] praise god i'm able to give god these
[1:01:58] these young years of my life i didn't i
[1:02:01] uh you know god helped me to overcome
[1:02:02] all the desires and lust that i had i'm
[1:02:04] so thankful praise god now i have some
[1:02:06] scars from before that but the scars
[1:02:09] look tiny compared to the blessings of
[1:02:11] god i see in my life amen
[1:02:13] that's what we can all say praise god
[1:02:15] the longer you serve god the more
[1:02:17] blessing you see in your life
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:21] here's another one where jesus christ
[1:02:23] now these are supposed to be red letter
[1:02:24] words i didn't have time to really uh i
[1:02:26] guess i could do it now but it's not
[1:02:28] really important these are red letter
[1:02:29] words jesus said if people do not
[1:02:32] overcome the world he's gonna blot their
[1:02:34] name off the book of life
[1:02:36] in other words there's a book in heaven
[1:02:37] that has names of the people that are
[1:02:38] saved and if people like judas if they
[1:02:42] or like some of these famous singers
[1:02:43] we're talking about if they will not
[1:02:44] overcome those sins jesus will blot
[1:02:47] their name off and their name will not
[1:02:48] be in the book of life anymore they lose
[1:02:50] eternal life
[1:02:52] look what he said jesus said he that
[1:02:54] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:02:56] white raiment and i will not blot out
[1:02:58] his name out of the book of life but i
[1:03:01] will confess his name before my father
[1:03:03] and before his angels praise god in
[1:03:06] other words if you overcome now then god
[1:03:08] will call you an overcomer he'll reward
[1:03:11] you later in heaven in front of all the
[1:03:13] angels and in front of all the believers
[1:03:16] down through the years praise god
[1:03:18] he'll look over and say you were an
[1:03:19] overcomer brother you were an overcomer
[1:03:21] sister you overcame and so your name is
[1:03:24] still on the book of life praise god
[1:03:27] hallelujah
[1:03:29] now that's a background i just want to
[1:03:30] show what joshua's really all about
[1:03:33] joshua is a foreshadowing of us coming
[1:03:36] out of the world being sanctified and
[1:03:38] then going into the baptism of the holy
[1:03:40] ghost and ready to fight battles in
[1:03:42] jesus name
[1:03:44] now we read joshua 1 to 6.
[1:03:47] now
[1:03:49] i don't think i have time to read all
[1:03:50] this but
[1:03:52] yeah
[1:03:54] now for a complete understanding of the
[1:03:56] cities of refuge god actually talks
[1:03:58] about it first in numbers 35
[1:04:02] verse 6 and verses 9 to 34. and if we
[1:04:06] don't have time to read that but if we
[1:04:07] would we would find that there were six
[1:04:09] cities in israel that god told moses
[1:04:13] tell joshua make sure these cities are
[1:04:15] cities of refuge
[1:04:19] so when anyone murders
[1:04:22] he said and they murder someone and they
[1:04:25] don't mean to do it it was not
[1:04:27] premeditated murder
[1:04:29] then the guilty person can run and
[1:04:32] escape their their their murderers or
[1:04:34] the slayers
[1:04:35] and they can have peace and safety in
[1:04:38] the city of refuge okay
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:44] once they got there so let's let's say
[1:04:46] let's say somebody was you uh i think
[1:04:48] the example is like using an axe you're
[1:04:50] using an axe and you're cutting wood but
[1:04:52] all of a sudden the axe had flies off
[1:04:55] when you go like that and it flies over
[1:04:56] at your buddy and the accent
[1:04:58] hits your buddy and he dies
[1:05:00] well all the family of your buddy is
[1:05:02] going to want to kill you because you
[1:05:03] killed them
[1:05:05] and so you drop you drop everything and
[1:05:07] you just run you you have to run
[1:05:09] and the whole time you can hear they're
[1:05:11] after you that's how i mean god
[1:05:13] god god wants people to be avenged of
[1:05:15] wrongs right god is good there's nothing
[1:05:17] wrong with wanting vengeance or wanting
[1:05:19] justice
[1:05:20] like i like to see justice like that
[1:05:23] famous guy who did that hoax this week
[1:05:24] with
[1:05:26] a racist hoax
[1:05:29] i like to see that justice is done
[1:05:32] i'd like to see that if you're wrong you
[1:05:34] should pay the price
[1:05:35] but if you're right you should be
[1:05:36] forgiven i mean you should have nothing
[1:05:38] wrong to you right
[1:05:40] who doesn't want justice on hitler who
[1:05:42] doesn't want justice on hitler over 6
[1:05:44] million jews killed shouldn't he have
[1:05:46] justice yes he will but it will be at
[1:05:48] the white throne judgment he's going for
[1:05:50] we're gonna have to wait for the justice
[1:05:51] then some people get justice now some
[1:05:54] people get justice then
[1:05:56] there's nothing wrong with wanting
[1:05:57] justice
[1:05:58] because that's what god
[1:06:00] god
[1:06:01] god cares god feels our pain amen he
[1:06:04] feels that
[1:06:07] and so
[1:06:08] they would be chasing him and he would
[1:06:09] run and the bible said
[1:06:11] once he got to the the city he he
[1:06:14] knocked on the gates and said let me in
[1:06:15] let me in and they come out and say oh
[1:06:18] what happened well i was chopping with
[1:06:20] my axe
[1:06:21] and i hit my friend and i killed him i
[1:06:23] didn't mean to
[1:06:25] and so then all the uh the slayers would
[1:06:27] come up
[1:06:28] and they'd say okay we gotta have a
[1:06:29] court trial here
[1:06:32] just one person couldn't cause this
[1:06:34] person to be killed
[1:06:36] it had to be in the mouth of two or
[1:06:37] three witnesses that every word be
[1:06:39] established
[1:06:40] and so they would have a public trial
[1:06:43] they'd say okay you tell what happened
[1:06:44] you tell what happened and then they say
[1:06:46] well if he didn't mean to do it
[1:06:48] they would say did you mean to kill him
[1:06:50] did you not like your friend do you not
[1:06:51] like your buddy he said no i loved him i
[1:06:54] i'm so sorry i did it
[1:06:55] and so the judges would stand there and
[1:06:58] either decide is he guilty or innocent
[1:07:01] if he's innocent he'd say you've got to
[1:07:03] go
[1:07:04] you can't kill him because he didn't
[1:07:05] mean to do it we let him into the city
[1:07:08] and now he's going to dwell in our city
[1:07:11] he found a place of safety amen
[1:07:15] even though he did wrong he didn't mean
[1:07:16] to do it
[1:07:17] so he found a place of safety and god
[1:07:20] made a way for a place of safety if you
[1:07:23] don't if you didn't mean to do god
[1:07:24] that's what god calls integrity god
[1:07:26] loves integrity amen
[1:07:28] when you have no i have no intent to
[1:07:30] hurt anybody i have no intent to do any
[1:07:32] wrong that's called integrity just like
[1:07:34] king abimelech remember
[1:07:36] hallelujah
[1:07:38] king abimelech took sarah and he's like
[1:07:40] oh i can't wait to marry sarah and god
[1:07:42] says if you marry her you're like a dead
[1:07:43] man
[1:07:44] he's like what do you mean he said you
[1:07:46] know my heart
[1:07:47] she don't have a husband he god said yes
[1:07:49] he does yes he does have a husband it's
[1:07:51] abraham and he lied to you
[1:07:53] but abraham's got to pray for you
[1:07:55] because he's my prophet
[1:07:56] now that just about blows my mind
[1:07:59] a lying prophet yet he's got to pray for
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:02] right because remember not all their
[1:08:04] wombs were were cursed
[1:08:06] after abimelech took sarah she already
[1:08:08] had a husband all the wombs in his house
[1:08:11] were cursed he said what's going on
[1:08:14] he said lord you know the integrity of
[1:08:16] my heart and god said yes because i knew
[1:08:19] your integrity that's why i kept you
[1:08:21] from taking sarah another man's wife and
[1:08:23] that's what we should rejoice in that if
[1:08:25] we don't want to sin god will make a way
[1:08:28] where we are vindicated as being
[1:08:30] truthful praise god
[1:08:32] amen god loves a heart that wants to
[1:08:34] live holy amen and doesn't want to do
[1:08:36] wrong and once i do ride god loves that
[1:08:38] kind of heart that's a heart after the
[1:08:40] heart of god
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:46] now that's pretty beautiful
[1:08:49] this man had to live in the city if he
[1:08:51] was if he accidentally killed his friend
[1:08:53] he had to live in the city until the
[1:08:54] high priest died
[1:08:56] and then he could go free
[1:08:59] now it's interesting church
[1:09:01] if he left early and said you know i
[1:09:04] really gotta go see mama i really need
[1:09:06] to see daddy
[1:09:08] if he left early and his buddy's family
[1:09:10] saw him they could kill him on the spot
[1:09:12] and it was okay
[1:09:13] because he was not allowed to leave that
[1:09:15] place of safety for him
[1:09:19] see because god god feels what people
[1:09:21] feel when they lose loved ones right
[1:09:24] and god god knows that every heart needs
[1:09:26] to feel justice when they lose someone
[1:09:28] especially if it's it's an evil way
[1:09:30] right it's a very sad way
[1:09:34] because church the bible says this blood
[1:09:37] defiles the land
[1:09:38] the shedding of blood and the killing of
[1:09:41] people it defiles a land
[1:09:44] remember when the first murder in the
[1:09:46] bible was two brothers
[1:09:48] cain
[1:09:50] tried to offer god a plant sacrifice and
[1:09:52] god said i don't want it he said i
[1:09:55] require a blood sacrifice remember that
[1:09:59] abel his brother brought a lamb and god
[1:10:01] said i like that that's my sacrifice
[1:10:04] but god didn't receive canes and so cain
[1:10:06] got mad he went out with his brother and
[1:10:08] killed his brother in the field
[1:10:10] and then cain went away and god said
[1:10:12] cain where's your brother abel
[1:10:16] uh
[1:10:17] he said cain where's your brother abe he
[1:10:19] says i don't know am i my brother's
[1:10:20] keeper and he lied to god
[1:10:23] and what did god say cain your brother's
[1:10:26] blood cries to me out of the ground
[1:10:30] see when people are murdered or killed
[1:10:32] that blood cries up to heaven for
[1:10:34] justice justice give me justice
[1:10:37] people want justice god's going to have
[1:10:39] justice
[1:10:41] now church think about this over 60
[1:10:43] million abortions have been done in this
[1:10:44] land
[1:10:45] that means there are 60 million voices
[1:10:47] crying out god judge america god judge
[1:10:50] america but you just keep praying we
[1:10:52] might get a victory here uh overturn
[1:10:54] abortion pretty soon
[1:10:56] texas already got that big uh uh 15-week
[1:11:00] abortion thing and they estimated that
[1:11:02] saves over a hundred babies lives every
[1:11:04] day
[1:11:05] amen hallelujah that's a step in the
[1:11:07] right direction amen
[1:11:09] i don't know yet god doesn't want
[1:11:11] anybody to die
[1:11:13] right and we we would we'd like abortion
[1:11:16] to be banned but we should pray for god
[1:11:18] give us victories give us victories
[1:11:20] that lord you can forgive people and if
[1:11:23] the woman did it and she didn't know god
[1:11:25] will forgive her she can still be saved
[1:11:28] it's going to it's going to bother her
[1:11:29] the rest of her life and but she can
[1:11:30] still be saved she can still experience
[1:11:33] forgiveness
[1:11:34] david was a murderer moses was a
[1:11:36] murderer and yet they still serve god
[1:11:38] amen you know
[1:11:40] god can say he can forgive he can still
[1:11:42] use us if we're willing to say i'm sorry
[1:11:44] it was my fault forgive me lord
[1:11:49] but the bible says jesus christ he was
[1:11:52] killed but the bible said his voice
[1:11:54] speaks better things than that of abel
[1:11:56] hey in other words jesus voice says
[1:11:58] father forgive these murderers they
[1:12:00] don't know what they're doing amen oh
[1:12:03] hallelujah praise god
[1:12:05] abel's blood said avenge me god avenge
[1:12:07] me avenge me but the blood of jesus says
[1:12:10] forgive them they don't know what
[1:12:11] they're doing have mercy on them amen
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:16] oh it's a beautiful story church i wish
[1:12:17] i could
[1:12:18] uh i hope you're getting it by the grace
[1:12:20] of god
[1:12:22] now in verse 4
[1:12:24] the bible said he had to stand at the
[1:12:26] gate
[1:12:27] and declare his cause in the ears of the
[1:12:29] elders of that city
[1:12:31] in other words they had to
[1:12:33] give all the witnesses here's what
[1:12:35] happened i was chopping with my ex my
[1:12:38] axe had flew off
[1:12:40] and killed my friend
[1:12:43] and if he said the truth they would take
[1:12:45] him in the city and give him a place to
[1:12:47] dwell among them
[1:12:48] now here here we see the importance of a
[1:12:51] public testimony
[1:12:53] such as water baptism
[1:12:55] when you get when you get saved we take
[1:12:57] you out to the lake and we baptize you
[1:12:59] in the name of jesus christ you go under
[1:13:01] the water and you come up and
[1:13:02] everybody's there and you're declaring
[1:13:04] to everybody that i'm dying to my old
[1:13:06] life and i want a new life in jesus
[1:13:08] christ
[1:13:10] god always wants a public testimony amen
[1:13:13] because jesus said whosoever is ashamed
[1:13:15] of me and my words and the adulterous
[1:13:17] and sinful generation
[1:13:19] of him also shall the son of man be
[1:13:21] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[1:13:23] his father with the holy angels
[1:13:27] that's why we've got to learn no matter
[1:13:28] where we are we can't be ashamed of
[1:13:30] jesus that's why i wear that jesus hat
[1:13:32] i want everybody know i love jesus amen
[1:13:35] i'm not ashamed of him he saved he
[1:13:37] healed my mama cancer praise god he
[1:13:39] saved my soul
[1:13:41] he filled me with the holy ghost praise
[1:13:42] god he's changed my whole life i'm not
[1:13:45] ashamed of him i want everyone to know
[1:13:46] the jesus that i know
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:51] but see sinners many times are unashamed
[1:13:53] of their sin so just like we're
[1:13:55] unashamed of jesus sinners are unashamed
[1:13:58] of their sin
[1:14:01] like here's when the bible says the
[1:14:03] homosexuals in the days of
[1:14:05] isaiah which was about 800 years before
[1:14:07] christ
[1:14:09] the bible said their faces their
[1:14:11] countenance witness against them they
[1:14:13] declare their sin is sodom they hide it
[1:14:15] not woe unto their soul for they have
[1:14:17] rewarded evil unto themselves
[1:14:19] you know that in akron every year they
[1:14:21] have a gay a gay parade every year in
[1:14:23] akron
[1:14:24] we pass it when a couple years ago we
[1:14:26] passed the gay parade what are they
[1:14:28] doing out there they're just declaring
[1:14:29] we're breaking god's law we're against
[1:14:31] the law of god we hate god's laws
[1:14:34] basically what they're saying
[1:14:36] and so see they're unashamed of their
[1:14:38] sin
[1:14:39] they ought to be ashamed of it but see
[1:14:42] we're unashamed of of the gospel of
[1:14:44] jesus christ because it is the power of
[1:14:46] god under salvation to us amen
[1:14:49] it is god's power in our life to make us
[1:14:52] live holy and make us live pure
[1:14:54] and make us live the way god wants us to
[1:14:56] live
[1:14:58] see there's three great sins on that
[1:15:00] homosexual spirit
[1:15:03] first it's like this it's this gay pride
[1:15:06] right they call it gay pride but it's
[1:15:07] actually it's a public declaration of i
[1:15:09] love sin
[1:15:11] that's how you recognize the spirit of
[1:15:13] homosexuality they're proud of it
[1:15:16] right and god said because of that
[1:15:18] they'll be judged
[1:15:20] because they're unashamed of their sin
[1:15:24] second
[1:15:25] this spirit is aggressive and violent
[1:15:29] right if you don't agree with it they
[1:15:30] call you a hater right they say
[1:15:33] you're wicked or you
[1:15:35] you're the oppressor
[1:15:37] right so it's they're not afraid of it
[1:15:39] as the first type of the sin the second
[1:15:41] part of this they're aggressive in
[1:15:43] violence towards us right
[1:15:47] and they target people uh that
[1:15:50] speak the truth in love and third
[1:15:53] it's an unnatural spirit
[1:15:56] the bible says they've left the natural
[1:15:58] use of the human body parts and done
[1:16:01] done went to the unnatural part
[1:16:05] see and the bible said they're actually
[1:16:07] abusing their own bodies when they
[1:16:08] partake in these homosexual acts
[1:16:12] so that's three characteristics they
[1:16:14] boldly proclaim it they're aggressive
[1:16:16] against you and they're unnatural they
[1:16:18] like things that are unnatural god
[1:16:19] didn't make them that way
[1:16:21] but they're so into their lust that they
[1:16:23] now enjoy things that they should
[1:16:25] actually despise and hate
[1:16:27] and abhor yeah brother amen brother uh
[1:16:29] allison all right you know i actually
[1:16:31] found something out there so you know
[1:16:43] wow
[1:16:44] yeah it is brother yep there it is
[1:16:47] there it is pride month yes sir yeah i
[1:16:50] appreciate that
[1:16:51] that's right total demon that's what the
[1:16:52] demon is right
[1:16:54] demon has those characters that's very
[1:16:55] good brother very good i like that
[1:16:57] yeah it's hidden right in there
[1:16:59] that's good
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:02] that's yeah the bible says demon powers
[1:17:05] in other words like a demon tempts them
[1:17:07] and say you should try this this is good
[1:17:09] and pretty soon that demon enters into
[1:17:10] their mind and now that's all they think
[1:17:12] about right that's how they live their
[1:17:14] lives and they're possessed with evil
[1:17:15] spirits
[1:17:16] very good brother very good
[1:17:19] also you must have a public testimony of
[1:17:22] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:24] rahab had to display her red core
[1:17:26] remember she her record had to hang
[1:17:28] outside publicly for all the world to
[1:17:30] see
[1:17:32] so it is with jesus christ in our lives
[1:17:34] we have to have a public testimony that
[1:17:36] i'm serving jesus christ his blood was
[1:17:38] shed for me now i'm living for him
[1:17:42] now
[1:17:44] notice this beautiful type here churches
[1:17:46] of just a beautiful type
[1:17:49] in verse 6 of joshua chapter 20 the
[1:17:52] unintentional slayer was set free from
[1:17:54] the city of refuge after the death of
[1:17:55] the high priest
[1:17:57] now this preacher named fb meyer said
[1:17:59] this
[1:18:00] he said this was a type of our lord
[1:18:03] and thus the death of each high priest
[1:18:06] pre-signified that the death by which
[1:18:08] captive souls are freed and the
[1:18:11] remembrance of sin made to cease
[1:18:14] so in other words
[1:18:15] this this foreshadow when a high priest
[1:18:17] would die
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:20] the unintentional murders were set free
[1:18:23] this this foreshadowed the high priest
[1:18:26] that was going to come named jesus
[1:18:28] christ and when jesus christ died for
[1:18:30] our sins every captive was made free
[1:18:32] praise god and then his sins his
[1:18:35] previous sins were no more remembered
[1:18:37] because the high priest paid for those
[1:18:39] sins amen
[1:18:40] hallelujah it's a beautiful picture
[1:18:42] church of jesus christ amen
[1:18:47] oh hallelujah in other words i have to
[1:18:49] be in this place and say thank god it's
[1:18:50] a peaceful place but i'm in this place
[1:18:52] until the high priest dies and then i'm
[1:18:55] set free and my sins and my iniquities
[1:18:57] are remembered no more thank god that
[1:19:00] jesus christ died and we are set free
[1:19:02] through his blood and forgiven
[1:19:06] beautiful
[1:19:09] joshua seven
[1:19:12] one through nine
[1:19:14] now in the in these verses joshua seven
[1:19:16] uh
[1:19:17] 27-9
[1:19:20] these cities
[1:19:22] of refuge were for both israelis and
[1:19:25] strangers or gentiles that sojourned
[1:19:27] among them
[1:19:30] and these cities of refuge they
[1:19:32] magnified god's grace and compassion
[1:19:35] upon mankind
[1:19:37] isn't that so kind of god
[1:19:39] that if you make a mistake and you do
[1:19:41] something now listen church if you
[1:19:42] accidentally killed somebody think about
[1:19:44] that you'd have to live with that pain
[1:19:45] the rest of your life
[1:19:47] can you imagine i remember there's that
[1:19:48] football player i don't remember his
[1:19:49] name he was a retired football player i
[1:19:51] don't know you might know his name
[1:19:51] brother
[1:19:53] no i'm gonna go different one yeah yeah
[1:19:54] he did an awful thing i think
[1:19:56] we think he was probably guilty of that
[1:19:57] one
[1:19:58] yeah i mean everything everything in
[1:19:59] match i don't know how he got out of
[1:20:00] that one
[1:20:02] sure looked like it but there was a
[1:20:04] tight end a few years ago he retired and
[1:20:06] it was a really sad case
[1:20:07] he was in a hurry in his in his driveway
[1:20:10] and he got in his truck backed out and
[1:20:11] he hit his own child
[1:20:13] and the child passed away can you
[1:20:15] imagine i mean he's a millionaire right
[1:20:17] multi-millionaire
[1:20:19] but now he'll never have that daughter
[1:20:22] and he'll have to live with that the
[1:20:23] rest of his life all because he didn't
[1:20:25] take a few seconds and look before he
[1:20:27] he backed up
[1:20:30] and that's what we're talking about
[1:20:32] but see god is so compassionate he knew
[1:20:34] people would make mistakes or maybe the
[1:20:36] ox the oxes uh maybe they had the big
[1:20:39] horns they would they would uh
[1:20:41] horn somebody and they'd die
[1:20:42] accidentally
[1:20:44] god had a way and if you did something
[1:20:47] on accident
[1:20:48] god had a way to protect your life as
[1:20:50] well because god cares and god is so
[1:20:53] merciful
[1:20:55] in church
[1:20:56] let me just say this like i was telling
[1:20:57] brother amen yesterday
[1:20:59] his sickness is just a test of faith
[1:21:02] we prayed and if god doesn't heal a
[1:21:04] miracle then we just got to wait it out
[1:21:07] god could do a miracle we know god's
[1:21:08] done miracles before for us before
[1:21:11] but if he doesn't then it's a test of
[1:21:12] faith in other words god in heaven
[1:21:14] allowed anew i'm gonna allow this
[1:21:16] brother or this sister be tested for two
[1:21:17] weeks or three weeks or a month or
[1:21:19] whatever job went through the test for
[1:21:21] months the bible said
[1:21:23] where he had boils on his body for
[1:21:25] months and it was all a test he you know
[1:21:28] he had done things wrong but we all do
[1:21:30] things wrong right we and he confessed
[1:21:32] his sins he killed the sacrifices the
[1:21:34] animals he was forgiven but yet god let
[1:21:37] him be tested and so so it is in this
[1:21:39] case too sometimes god will let
[1:21:40] accidents happen
[1:21:42] or things happen in your past and it's a
[1:21:44] test will you overcome that sorrow or
[1:21:48] or not or you give in to that sorrow
[1:21:51] will you live into depression despair or
[1:21:53] will you rise above that and say thank
[1:21:55] god that he kept me thank god that he
[1:21:57] still forgives me thank god there's
[1:21:59] still hope in my life amen amen
[1:22:01] hallelujah that's what god wants you to
[1:22:03] do god i want you to rise up and say
[1:22:05] though i made mistakes god has a future
[1:22:07] for me i can still be free amen
[1:22:09] hallelujah i can still be afraid because
[1:22:12] the high priest died amen and now my
[1:22:15] sins iniquities are remembered no more
[1:22:17] praise god amen
[1:22:21] do you know the bible said that let's go
[1:22:22] to romans here you've got your bibles
[1:22:24] new testament romans
[1:22:28] let's just well i'll put it up here too
[1:22:29] romans chapter 4
[1:22:32] church the bible says when you confess
[1:22:34] your sins god does not remember your
[1:22:36] iniquities anymore
[1:22:43] yep romans chapter 4 sir yes sir uh
[1:22:48] let's go to verse
[1:22:50] verse four now these are really
[1:22:52] uh these are really wise and
[1:22:54] sophisticated words we'll say right so
[1:22:56] we'll just try to make it as simple as
[1:22:57] we can
[1:22:58] and that's great because paul was a very
[1:22:59] wise man
[1:23:01] romans 4 verse 4 now to him that worketh
[1:23:04] is the reward not reckoned of grace
[1:23:06] but of debt in other words if you're
[1:23:08] trying to earn salvation you'll never
[1:23:09] get it because you can never pay off
[1:23:11] your sin debt you're not holy enough to
[1:23:13] pay off your sin debt
[1:23:14] but if it's grace look at verse 5 but to
[1:23:17] him that worketh not in other words the
[1:23:19] people that just trust in god
[1:23:21] but believe on him that justifies the
[1:23:23] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:23:26] righteousness
[1:23:28] so let me encourage brother austin and
[1:23:29] sister lena you can never earn salvation
[1:23:32] you just have to accept the free gift
[1:23:34] you'll never earn it because you can't
[1:23:35] you can't pay off all your sins what
[1:23:37] good because you'll keep sinning
[1:23:39] you can never earn salvation it is a
[1:23:41] free gift of god
[1:23:43] and then when you believe that that's a
[1:23:45] free gift the bible said righteousness
[1:23:47] comes upon you amen i know when you
[1:23:49] believe that god wants to freely forgive
[1:23:51] you his righteous anointing anoints you
[1:23:54] your anointed with faith praise god
[1:23:56] because you're saved by grace through
[1:23:57] faith
[1:23:58] hallelujah there it is right there amen
[1:24:01] verse 6
[1:24:02] even as david also described the
[1:24:04] blessedness of this kind of man unto
[1:24:07] whom god imputes righteousness without
[1:24:09] works
[1:24:10] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:24:12] are forgiven whose sins are covered
[1:24:14] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:24:17] not impute sin
[1:24:19] praise god so when you just believe god
[1:24:21] and say god forgive me my sins i'm
[1:24:23] guilty i want to be saved and you accept
[1:24:26] that then you are no longer guilty god
[1:24:29] doesn't remember those sins you are now
[1:24:31] saved and
[1:24:33] your sins went on jesus and jesus
[1:24:35] righteous went on you amen
[1:24:38] hallelujah where's that scripture about
[1:24:39] free gift let me look it up here
[1:24:42] i preached on a few months ago
[1:24:45] yeah go to chapter 5 verse 15.
[1:24:54] romans chapter 5 verse 15 but not as the
[1:24:56] offense so also is the what the free
[1:24:59] gift
[1:25:01] for if through the offense of one many
[1:25:03] be dead that's adam much more the grace
[1:25:05] of god the gift by grace which is by one
[1:25:08] man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
[1:25:12] in other words the work of jesus christ
[1:25:14] his work on the cross has caused many
[1:25:16] people to be saved adam's sin caused
[1:25:18] everybody to die right but jesus victory
[1:25:21] over sin on the cross caused all
[1:25:23] believers to live and no more have to
[1:25:26] deal with their sin because god
[1:25:27] remembers their sin no more hey that's
[1:25:30] what the bible says praise god let me
[1:25:32] look up the other free gift yeah verse
[1:25:33] 16 yes the next verse
[1:25:36] and not as it was by one that sin so is
[1:25:38] the gift for the judgment was by one to
[1:25:41] condemnation adam but the free gift is
[1:25:43] of many offenses unto justification
[1:25:47] praise god there's one more verse about
[1:25:49] the free gift
[1:25:51] verse 18. so three times church in the
[1:25:54] same chapter god says it's a free gift
[1:25:56] it's a free gift you just have to accept
[1:25:58] it
[1:25:59] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:26:00] judgment
[1:26:01] came upon all men to condemnation even
[1:26:04] so the r by the righteousness of one the
[1:26:07] free gift came upon all men unto
[1:26:10] justification of life praise god in
[1:26:12] other words god is offering this free
[1:26:14] gift to every person here today and of
[1:26:16] course most of you have received it
[1:26:17] right you've accepted that it's a free
[1:26:19] gift god just offers you the gift and
[1:26:21] say i'm off i'm giving you eternal life
[1:26:23] if you repent of your sins and believe
[1:26:24] in me and all you have to do is say yes
[1:26:26] lord i'm repenting of my sins i believe
[1:26:28] in you and then god no more imputes
[1:26:30] those sins unto you god totally forgives
[1:26:33] you it's a free gift of grace we call it
[1:26:36] amazing grace
[1:26:39] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:26:42] so see these cities are types of being
[1:26:45] saved
[1:26:47] right you're guilty of sin you and i are
[1:26:49] guilty of sin but god has a place amen
[1:26:52] for those people that want to be saved
[1:26:55] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:26:57] so look at look at the map here church
[1:26:59] if you read joshua 20 there were six
[1:27:02] cities where they could run
[1:27:04] six cities
[1:27:07] they have kedish way up here not katish
[1:27:08] barnier kanesh barney is way down here
[1:27:10] they have kiddish golan ramoth gilead
[1:27:14] shechem
[1:27:15] bezer and hebron
[1:27:17] and notice god places them out god
[1:27:19] spreads them out
[1:27:21] praise god
[1:27:23] sick cities god said i know there's
[1:27:25] going to be accidents
[1:27:26] i'm going to allow people to be tested
[1:27:28] with trials and difficulties in life but
[1:27:31] if they want to be free i'm going to
[1:27:32] make a place where they can be safe
[1:27:35] but it's their choice in church so it is
[1:27:37] our choice today too
[1:27:38] do we want to be saved do we want to be
[1:27:40] lost what do we want god god's going to
[1:27:42] allow us to have whatever we want right
[1:27:44] god's not going to force us to do
[1:27:46] anything so if you want to be saved
[1:27:48] there's a place for you to be saved it's
[1:27:50] in the city of refuge it's in jesus
[1:27:52] christ
[1:27:53] hallelujah
[1:27:55] now here's what my home and bible study
[1:27:58] says at home
[1:28:00] these three cities were west of jordan
[1:28:04] and three on the east of jordan
[1:28:07] they were spread out across the land so
[1:28:09] that a person was never far from one oh
[1:28:12] can i say it like this church we need to
[1:28:14] learn that we are never far from jesus
[1:28:17] christ
[1:28:19] we're never too far there's always a
[1:28:21] place amen there's always a place that
[1:28:23] we can run to and find god's grace can i
[1:28:26] say it like this it's a place of prayer
[1:28:28] it's a place of worship amen it don't
[1:28:30] have to be at the church it can be in
[1:28:31] your home on the job but you've got to
[1:28:34] run to jesus he's never far from us he's
[1:28:36] very close to us he just wants us to
[1:28:38] escape
[1:28:40] escape the devil that's chasing us right
[1:28:42] amen that's that's a beautiful thought
[1:28:44] church satan's the bible says satan
[1:28:46] comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:28:48] so who's the one chasing you satan's the
[1:28:50] one chasing you saying i'm going to kill

[1:28:54] saying that but you got to run you got
[1:28:57] to run the race set before you you got
[1:28:59] to run until you reach that city amen

[1:29:42] never far from you
[1:29:44] he's oh don't let the devil tell you
[1:29:45] he's so far
[1:29:47] yeah you might have grieved the lord but

[1:29:50] have offended him you just wait he's
[1:29:52] waiting there for you to accept him i'm

[1:30:32] to dwell on the earth on the face of the
[1:30:33] earth and have to determine the times in
[1:30:36] other words god knew he'd live in the
[1:30:37] 21st century
[1:30:40] before appointed and the bounds of their
[1:30:41] inhabitation god knew where you would
[1:30:43] live god placed you in akron or
[1:30:45] california or arizona or mansfield god
[1:30:49] placed you there why
[1:30:51] so you would seek after god
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:55] and feel after him and try to find him
[1:30:58] because he's not far from you in other
[1:30:59] words god god put you close to a real
[1:31:01] believer praise god there's somewhere in
[1:31:03] your life where god placed you close to
[1:31:06] a believer so you could feel after god
[1:31:08] and say do you believe in jesus you
[1:31:09] really worship god the bible says that
[1:31:11] god placed you in the right spot in
[1:31:13] other words he's not far from you amen

[1:31:46] sometimes i preach two hours brother so
[1:31:47] just bear with me here
[1:31:49] once once you get all in this you start
[1:31:50] seeing all this i mean it's hard to stop
[1:31:52] because you see of all i see oh i see
[1:31:54] jesus christ everywhere and joshua in
[1:31:55] genesis he's everywhere praise god
[1:31:58] you just get so caught up in this it's
[1:32:00] beautiful jesus is the city of refuge
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:04] he's our city
[1:32:05] and all we've got to do is run to him
[1:32:09] here now i read this on wednesday night
[1:32:11] at the end of the service
[1:32:12] now if you want to do right how many
[1:32:14] want to do right in their life
[1:32:15] i don't want to do wrong i don't want to
[1:32:16] go to hell right on my hands up too if
[1:32:18] you want to do right i'm so glad tonight
[1:32:20] to tell you there's a city of refuge
[1:32:24] that's jesus christ
[1:32:26] oh thank you lord
[1:32:28] he's my city of refuge amen he's where i
[1:32:31] run to him prayer when i need him praise
[1:32:33] god
[1:32:35] if you don't want to do wrong
[1:32:37] see the enemy's after you
[1:32:39] then there's a way of escape and that
[1:32:41] escape is jesus christ
[1:32:44] there's a place where you can come and
[1:32:45] let off the steam
[1:32:47] see can you imagine church running all
[1:32:49] those miles and you've got people
[1:32:50] chasing you oh you can hear the swords
[1:32:53] clanging you know you can hear the
[1:32:54] arrows you'd be tired you've got so much
[1:32:57] pressure but once you got there to the
[1:32:58] gates you could grab ahold of the gates
[1:33:00] and say i'm safe i'm safe that's what
[1:33:03] he's saying when you run to jesus christ
[1:33:05] all the pressure goes off because you
[1:33:07] know you're in his nail scarred hands
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:10] hallelujah
[1:33:12] you know he's holding you in the palm of
[1:33:13] his hand the bible says
[1:33:16] glory
[1:33:19] he said but if you love sin and you
[1:33:21] don't want god then the enemy is going
[1:33:22] to overtake you somewhere like we said
[1:33:24] we saw the enemy overtake elvis we saw
[1:33:26] the enemy overtake judas iscariot
[1:33:29] right whitney houston we saw the enemy
[1:33:31] overtake them
[1:33:32] they thought they could run them from it
[1:33:33] by drinking and they found out you can't
[1:33:35] get away from the devil by drinking you
[1:33:37] got to get rid of the drinking and run
[1:33:38] to jesus amen
[1:33:40] you got to drink on the holy ghost wine
[1:33:43] that's right amen
[1:33:44] you got to get drunk on jesus amen
[1:33:46] that's what you really need to get drunk
[1:33:47] on hallelujah that's what the bible says
[1:33:52] the bible calls it new wine amen
[1:33:55] hallelujah praise god amen you get drunk
[1:33:57] on that you you don't know how you might
[1:33:59] act amen you might just be crazy because
[1:34:02] god has filled your heart and soul
[1:34:04] you're a new creature you're stimulated
[1:34:06] you're moved to act differently because
[1:34:08] you've drank down his goodness amen
[1:34:10] you've drank down his love you drank
[1:34:12] down his grace so you act crazy amen
[1:34:15] crazy to the world
[1:34:17] amen but you act just fine to god
[1:34:20] hallelujah
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:25] you can't come to christ because the
[1:34:27] people don't want to
[1:34:29] and when this man comes to christ this
[1:34:30] place of refuge when a man come in the
[1:34:33] old testament the first thing pardon me
[1:34:35] he had to come upon his own free will
[1:34:37] and that's the way you have to come to
[1:34:38] christ
[1:34:40] see if the man
[1:34:42] killed his friend he could he could he
[1:34:43] could stay there and be killed
[1:34:45] but if
[1:34:46] he could give up in the depression right
[1:34:49] he could have gave up and depressed and
[1:34:50] say oh my life's never going to amount
[1:34:52] to anything
[1:34:53] or he could go find a place of escape
[1:34:55] eventually be free and then raise his
[1:34:57] family amen
[1:34:59] or that may be saved and then maybe work
[1:35:01] on tools to make sure that don't happen
[1:35:02] again
[1:35:03] right just like you see some of these
[1:35:05] parents you see some of these parents in
[1:35:06] america whose kids have overdosed on
[1:35:08] drugs what do they do a lot of them
[1:35:10] start up speaking engagements to try to
[1:35:12] train the next generation don't get
[1:35:14] started on drugs
[1:35:16] see
[1:35:16] but what if they would have gave up and
[1:35:18] quit and
[1:35:19] committed suicide they wouldn't be able
[1:35:20] to help the next generation
[1:35:23] so if we suffer if we make a major
[1:35:24] mistake we must learn from that and then
[1:35:27] the rest of our lives try to urge people
[1:35:29] not to commit that same mistake
[1:35:32] and that will honor god that will save
[1:35:35] lives and maybe church save souls as
[1:35:37] well praise god if you can get them to
[1:35:39] know jesus christ
[1:35:43] hallelujah
[1:35:46] he said another thing you must be
[1:35:47] satisfied while you're there remember
[1:35:49] the bible says if that man left the city
[1:35:51] before the high priest died he could be
[1:35:53] killed
[1:35:55] because he left the place of protection
[1:35:58] brother brahm says you can't hang around
[1:36:00] every day crying i'd like to get out of
[1:36:02] here i like to get out of here they put
[1:36:04] you out
[1:36:06] you must willfully want to stay it must
[1:36:09] be that you must come you want to stay
[1:36:11] in that city and when you come to christ
[1:36:14] you can't look back to the world the
[1:36:15] bible said he that puts his hand on the
[1:36:17] plow and turns look back is not worthy
[1:36:20] of plowing
[1:36:22] now there's where now there's where many
[1:36:24] so-called christians make their mistake
[1:36:26] see they act like they're going to plow
[1:36:28] but the first little thing comes up they
[1:36:30] blow up about it
[1:36:32] so see church
[1:36:34] as you start serving god don't let
[1:36:35] anybody try to turn you back into your
[1:36:37] life your life of sin
[1:36:40] brother rahm told a story in this in
[1:36:42] this sermon letting off the pressure and
[1:36:43] i'll just tell briefly
[1:36:45] he met a man
[1:36:46] uh he was going out hunting and a man
[1:36:49] uh somehow they they met uh some i think
[1:36:52] they met some prisoners who were like
[1:36:54] cleaning up the roadside
[1:36:56] brother i talked about they were they're
[1:36:57] on their way to hunt and they came
[1:36:58] across these guys that were uh
[1:37:00] cleaning up the roadside i believe
[1:37:03] and the brother man said you're such a
[1:37:04] nice-looking young man what happened to
[1:37:05] you why were you in prison
[1:37:07] he said i'll tell you the story i
[1:37:09] started off as a good man my wife and i
[1:37:10] had a baby they called me holy bishop
[1:37:13] because i loved god he said but then i
[1:37:15] got mixed up with the wrong friends
[1:37:17] he said these friends took me to the
[1:37:19] dance halls and i would leave my wife
[1:37:21] and girl at home
[1:37:24] and one day i was at home and wife said
[1:37:26] come in for dinner and he said okay but
[1:37:28] then those guys that took him to the
[1:37:29] dance hall came up and said hey can you
[1:37:30] take us down to get groceries

[1:39:40] hallelujah
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:45] thank the lord
[1:39:47] how many i think it was like five guys
[1:39:49] when i went to college five guys
[1:39:52] that i went to college with for football
[1:39:54] quit within the first year
[1:39:56] they didn't get their degrees they had a
[1:39:58] full-ride scholarship
[1:40:00] and i realized later that could have
[1:40:02] been me
[1:40:03] if i would have started drinking like
[1:40:05] they did because i started drinking
[1:40:06] those first few years because i wasn't
[1:40:08] saved
[1:40:09] and they had pictures of me drinking
[1:40:10] with them but i never liked it
[1:40:12] i was still a sinner
[1:40:14] but it was a few months after that i got
[1:40:16] saved
[1:40:17] and then the guys would say hey you're
[1:40:19] saved right i said well yeah i love
[1:40:21] jesus christ they say hey i got a
[1:40:22] picture of you drinking and smoking
[1:40:24] at college i said fine i said keep it
[1:40:26] that's the last time you're ever going
[1:40:28] to see that
[1:40:29] because i serve jesus now and they made
[1:40:31] fun of me but by the end they respected
[1:40:32] me
[1:40:33] but i saw had i not run to jesus in
[1:40:36] college that would have been me i could
[1:40:37] have wasted over a hundred thousand
[1:40:38] dollars but thank god i had it for my
[1:40:40] scholarship
[1:40:41] thank god i didn't waste it
[1:40:44] and these other guys go off and they
[1:40:46] they miss out on these great
[1:40:47] opportunities church we gotta run to
[1:40:49] jesus amen we got to make a decision if
[1:40:52] you feel the enemy chasing you leave
[1:40:54] leave the enemy leave that situation run
[1:40:56] to christ get some help jesus will be
[1:40:58] your help
[1:41:00] amen
[1:41:01] brother i said oh sinner friend let me
[1:41:03] warn you
[1:41:04] flee from the wrath that is to come
[1:41:06] there's only one hiding place and i'm
[1:41:08] glad that god made a city of refuge
[1:41:10] jesus christ we can run in
[1:41:12] and be safe
[1:41:17] oh my hallelujah
[1:41:21] brother bran talks about let's go to
[1:41:23] blue words here how can we think of
[1:41:25] those great cities built of refuge when
[1:41:28] the pursuer after the man he got into
[1:41:30] the tower he was safe nothing could
[1:41:32] touch him oh god let us run and make
[1:41:35] haste to the lord today for he is our
[1:41:37] refuge and strength a very present help
[1:41:41] in time of trouble
[1:41:44] so church do you see yourself in this
[1:41:46] scripture let me see yourself in this
[1:41:47] scripture
[1:41:48] i see myself in this scripture be when i
[1:41:50] got saved
[1:41:52] the devil was after me
[1:41:54] but i knew i had to serve god and i went
[1:41:56] to that i went to that conference and i
[1:41:58] saw that big six foot three guy raised
[1:42:00] his hands and that's when i said i
[1:42:02] repented right there i said jesus
[1:42:03] forgive me if this six foot four guy
[1:42:06] who goes to ohio state he plays football
[1:42:08] if he can raise his hands forgive me i'm
[1:42:11] ashamed of myself and that's when i
[1:42:12] first started raising my hands for jesus
[1:42:14] that's when i ran to that city of refuge
[1:42:17] amen
[1:42:18] i always remember when i entered that
[1:42:20] city hallelujah i've been safe ever
[1:42:22] since amen
[1:42:24] i didn't i've had protection god has
[1:42:25] protected me and i've been safe and i've
[1:42:27] been forgiven ever since that day
[1:42:30] i repented of my sins and ran to jesus
[1:42:32] christ
[1:42:33] i remember that day for you praise god
[1:42:36] oh you'll never forget that day when
[1:42:38] satan was on your trail but god gave you
[1:42:40] strength to run and god opened the doors
[1:42:43] of heaven amen god opened the doors of
[1:42:45] the church and you got saved hallelujah
[1:42:51] so see church really ask yourself this
[1:42:52] question when you were sinning did you
[1:42:54] really want to blaspheme jesus's holy
[1:42:56] name
[1:42:58] no
[1:42:59] of course not
[1:43:01] how many of us used to cuss so we don't
[1:43:02] have to raise our hands but
[1:43:04] every time we would cuss we had to blast
[1:43:06] me you just say oh my oh my god or you'd
[1:43:08] say you you'd use jesus name in vain
[1:43:10] that's blasphemy
[1:43:12] that's disrespecting god that's using
[1:43:14] god's name as a curse
[1:43:16] but now we look back did we really mean
[1:43:19] that do we really mean the curse to
[1:43:20] curse the god who gave us life of course
[1:43:22] not
[1:43:23] i didn't mean to do that i was just
[1:43:25] caught in a bad spirit
[1:43:27] so now we see ourselves we're like the
[1:43:29] ones that unintentionally did it right
[1:43:32] we're like the unintentional slayers now
[1:43:34] because i really wouldn't want to curse
[1:43:35] the god who made me just like you
[1:43:37] wouldn't use your mom's name as a cuss
[1:43:38] word why because she loved you she
[1:43:40] brought you to this world she she nursed
[1:43:42] you she fed you you wouldn't use your
[1:43:44] mom's name as a cuss word
[1:43:46] neither do we use jesus name as a
[1:43:47] customer because he gave us our
[1:43:49] spiritual life amen
[1:43:53] did you really want to defile your body
[1:43:55] with sexual sin
[1:43:59] and yet jesus purchased that body on the
[1:44:01] cross
[1:44:03] the bible said you were bought with the
[1:44:04] price look at this the bible says you
[1:44:06] are bought with the price therefore
[1:44:07] glorify god in your body in your spirit
[1:44:09] which are god's
[1:44:13] right any sexual sin we may have done
[1:44:15] before we were married that's sin
[1:44:17] do we really mean to defile
[1:44:20] jesus's blood
[1:44:21] you know and the body that he purchased
[1:44:23] no
[1:44:25] so this is how we relate church to the
[1:44:27] cities of refuge
[1:44:29] we may not have murdered somebody
[1:44:30] accidentally but we certainly may have
[1:44:32] blasted god's holy name
[1:44:34] we may have cursed other people we may
[1:44:36] have defiled this temple god give us
[1:44:40] but through the blood of jesus christ
[1:44:42] through repentance
[1:44:44] god now forgives us forgives us of our
[1:44:47] sins he protects us and now we can
[1:44:49] glorify god in a safe place
[1:44:55] let me close with this go to john
[1:44:56] chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:44:58] john chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:45:01] matthew mark luke john it's the fourth
[1:45:03] book of the new testament
[1:45:11] john chapter 8 verse 1. i'm almost done
[1:45:13] here
[1:45:14] my 15 minutes i got one minute left in
[1:45:16] my 15 minutes so
[1:45:18] i'm almost done i'll be out about an
[1:45:19] hour and hour hour and a half this is
[1:45:21] just hour and a half today
[1:45:25] and i just want this verse to encourage
[1:45:26] your church i just wanted to encourage
[1:45:27] you
[1:45:30] i'm going to pull that picture up here
[1:45:31] real quick again
[1:45:35] what a beautiful picture that is
[1:45:41] okay john chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:45:45] then went i'm sorry jesus went under the
[1:45:47] mount of olives and early in the morning
[1:45:48] he came again in the temple and all the
[1:45:50] people came unto him and he sat down and
[1:45:51] taught them and the scribes and the
[1:45:53] pharisees brought onto him a woman
[1:45:55] taking adultery and when they had set
[1:45:57] her in the midst they said master this
[1:45:59] woman was taken in adultery in the very
[1:46:01] act now moses in the law command us that
[1:46:04] such should be stoned but what saith
[1:46:06] thou
[1:46:10] this they said tempting him that they
[1:46:11] might have
[1:46:12] to accuse him
[1:46:14] but jesus stooped down and with his
[1:46:15] finger wrote on the ground
[1:46:19] as though he heard them not
[1:46:21] so jesus ignored their accusation
[1:46:23] and he stooped down and started riding
[1:46:24] in the dirt
[1:46:27] verse 7. so when they continued asking
[1:46:29] him that he lifted up himself and said
[1:46:30] to them he that is without sin among you
[1:46:32] let him first cast the stone at her what
[1:46:35] a statement
[1:46:37] oh you want her to die okay well the
[1:46:38] first one can throw the stone if you
[1:46:40] never commit a sin before
[1:46:43] who are you to kill her when you deserve
[1:46:45] in other words how can you kill her when
[1:46:46] you deserve to be killed
[1:46:48] you're an unintentional murderer as well
[1:46:50] is what he's saying
[1:46:51] right she had unintentionally got an
[1:46:54] adultery
[1:46:55] she didn't mean to do that
[1:46:57] really
[1:46:58] right we wouldn't mean we why would we
[1:47:00] want to break our marriage vow why would
[1:47:02] we we told everybody we're going to keep
[1:47:03] our marriage vows why would we want to
[1:47:04] break it she didn't mean to do that
[1:47:08] and jesus said well if you've never done
[1:47:10] wrong go ahead and stone her
[1:47:13] and yet church the bible says she should
[1:47:14] have been stoned but not just her the
[1:47:16] man too
[1:47:18] and that's that's what i believe jesus
[1:47:19] is writing in the ground i believe jesus
[1:47:21] was writing the scripture that they were
[1:47:22] breaking
[1:47:23] the bible says take the man and the
[1:47:25] woman and stone them
[1:47:28] so jesus was showing how can you condemn
[1:47:30] her when you're not even keeping the
[1:47:31] word of god you're just trying to tempt
[1:47:33] me
[1:47:35] because jesus was the word
[1:47:37] you couldn't trick him because he was
[1:47:39] the word you couldn't make him forget
[1:47:40] the word because he was the word amen
[1:47:43] hallelujah
[1:47:48] and look we did in verse 8. he said
[1:47:50] again he stooped down and wrote on the
[1:47:51] ground and they which heard it being
[1:47:53] convicted by their own conscience went
[1:47:55] out one by one beginning at the eldest
[1:47:57] even to the last this show they still
[1:47:59] had hope
[1:48:00] right because the older people were more
[1:48:01] wise and they realized
[1:48:03] my
[1:48:04] he's right i am quite a sinner now think
[1:48:07] about that if you're older person you
[1:48:08] can think of all the times you've sinned
[1:48:10] over the course of your life
[1:48:12] so the oldest ones were like oh yeah i'm
[1:48:13] a sinner i sin all the time
[1:48:15] they left first finally the younger ones
[1:48:19] they're not so wise right
[1:48:21] yeah i guess i've sinned too
[1:48:23] i got caught up in the moment
[1:48:26] and look now who's left just jesus and
[1:48:29] the adulterous woman praise god
[1:48:32] hallelujah and when jesus lifted himself
[1:48:35] up he saw none but the woman and said
[1:48:37] her woman
[1:48:38] where are thine accusers
[1:48:40] hath no man condemned thee
[1:48:45] glory
[1:48:46] and she said no man lord
[1:48:49] not anymore right they were condemning
[1:48:51] her but now there's none here
[1:48:54] and jesus said to her neither do i
[1:48:56] condemn thee go
[1:48:58] and sin no more
[1:48:59] that's what i was telling lena with that
[1:49:00] good question she said should people
[1:49:02] come as they are to church absolutely
[1:49:04] this woman came as she was i mean she
[1:49:06] was forced to it but she came to jesus
[1:49:08] anyway what did jesus say i don't
[1:49:10] condemn you
[1:49:11] just go and sin no more in other words
[1:49:14] recognize you're forgiven and don't do
[1:49:16] that again
[1:49:18] and that's how we should come to christ
[1:49:19] that's what jesus if jesus said that
[1:49:21] once he has to say it every time
[1:49:24] because he can't change the bible says
[1:49:25] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:49:28] and forever so if we're guilty of sin
[1:49:30] all you have to do today is say jesus no
[1:49:33] man accuses me forgive me my sins and
[1:49:35] he'll say you're forgiven go and sin no
[1:49:37] more don't do it again amen
[1:49:39] and you're forgiven praise god although
[1:49:41] you should die you're worthy she was
[1:49:43] worthy of death
[1:49:44] but because jesus took away the accusers
[1:49:47] amen because jesus takes away satan's
[1:49:50] accusations amen we can be forgiven and
[1:49:52] there's no accusation there's no
[1:49:54] condemnation to them that are in or with
[1:49:58] jesus christ in the city of refuge
[1:50:01] amen that's awesome man
[1:50:05] hallelujah
[1:50:07] see she really didn't want to do it her
[1:50:09] and her lover should have been stoned
[1:50:11] but jesus was bringing in mercy jesus is
[1:50:14] bringing a new covenant i'm bringing in
[1:50:15] grace
[1:50:17] i'm bringing in forgiveness
[1:50:20] see church no man no devil can accuse
[1:50:23] you because they're all guilty of
[1:50:25] themselves
[1:50:26] how can satan accuse you he's guilty
[1:50:28] himself
[1:50:30] so we don't listen to satan here we
[1:50:32] listen to the bible here amen
[1:50:34] hallelujah
[1:50:36] don't listen to the devil listen to
[1:50:37] christ praise god we should receive our
[1:50:40] forgiveness receive our part and say
[1:50:42] thank you jesus i'm forgiven and i'm
[1:50:44] going to sin no more i'm going to live a
[1:50:47] life showing my love and gratitude i'm
[1:50:50] going to show my thanksgiving by making
[1:50:52] every life or every day of my life
[1:50:54] glorify jesus
[1:50:56] and brother stephen did you ever see
[1:50:57] this type here brother i preached this
[1:50:59] years ago do you see the son of man
[1:51:01] stoop twice to the earth did you see
[1:51:02] that
[1:51:04] look this is a beautiful type brother
[1:51:06] you'll catch it maybe austin alina might
[1:51:08] be able to catch it they're kind of new
[1:51:09] to some of the the types and shadows
[1:51:14] you see that verse 6 brother it says but
[1:51:15] jesus stooped to the ground and rode on
[1:51:18] the ground
[1:51:19] and then look at verse 8 and he again
[1:51:21] stooped down and rode on the ground so
[1:51:23] twice he stooped so brother catches the
[1:51:26] son of man
[1:51:27] come down to earth twice
[1:51:29] two visitations of the son of man
[1:51:31] touching
[1:51:32] earth hallelujah the first stooping was
[1:51:36] jesus's first coming
[1:51:38] right
[1:51:40] the second stooping was luke 17 30 in
[1:51:43] the days of the voice right i'm sorry
[1:51:45] the son of man right it's luke 17 30.
[1:51:48] i'm having a hard time quoting that
[1:51:49] right now
[1:51:51] so see the second stooping was the son
[1:51:53] of man he stooped down the earth jesus
[1:51:55] christ in the ministry of brother
[1:51:56] branham stooped down and told us you
[1:51:58] never did it
[1:52:00] you have no accusers you're forgiven in
[1:52:03] other words brother jesus came the first
[1:52:04] time declared it and jesus came in
[1:52:06] brother ramsey's ministry and declared
[1:52:08] it he said you don't have any accusers
[1:52:10] praise god you're forgiven go and sin no
[1:52:13] more to that guilty woman what are we
[1:52:15] we're a guilty church right we're a
[1:52:17] guilty woman but jesus makes us free and
[1:52:20] we go and sin no more
[1:52:22] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:52:24] musicians can come
[1:52:28] i hope you can see that my preach at
[1:52:29] about 10 years ago it came came to my
[1:52:31] mind this morning
[1:52:33] let me read luke 17 30. there's two
[1:52:36] comings of the son of man
[1:52:39] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:52:41] the son of man is revealed
[1:52:43] so jesus stooped down to earth one time
[1:52:46] he raised back up and said ye without
[1:52:48] sin cast the first stone they left he
[1:52:50] stooped down again
[1:52:51] he touched the earth again
[1:52:54] and god touched the earth through the
[1:52:55] ministry of brother branham he touched
[1:52:57] the earth he expressed the word on the
[1:52:58] earth there it is right there
[1:53:00] he expressed his written word
