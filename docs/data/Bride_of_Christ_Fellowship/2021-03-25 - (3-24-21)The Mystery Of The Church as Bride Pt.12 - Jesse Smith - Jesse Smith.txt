verse brother bang's supplied us here with ephesians 5 32 praise god there's a little quote i was thinking of i just want to look it up real quick okay i got it it's from the church age book all right ephesians 5 32 let's read that together on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church praise god let's go to ecclesiastes 12 verse one [Music] all right let's read this together ecclesiastes 12 verse 1 1 2 3 remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in the amen may god add the blessings the reason this word you may be seated if you like by god's grace all right so lord willing we'll uh continue look at this subject i think we're on part 12 tonight yet we're looking at the the type the mystery of the church as the bride i just like to uh real briefly read this quote it just kind of came to my mind here as i was uh praying um brother brahma was teaching in the authority or church age and he's talking about the two kinds of women he's talking about you know mystery babylon and he's talking about the bride of christ and he said uh the woman is brought to a very peculiar position before god in his word she's the type of all things vulgar foul and lowsome on one hand but on the other hand she's the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptive receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god on one hand she's called the who's drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other hand she's called the bride of christ amen praise god on one hand she's called mystery babylon the abomination before god on the other hand she's called the new jerusalem our mother on one hand she is so fouled wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast in the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen ah let's thank the lord for that praise god amen bye that's beautiful i just want a really quick review all these women we preached on it uh you know we looked at eight women that type uh the gentile bride right and i just wanna real quick go over them real quick think about the character of these women sarah think about the character that she had to have to receive the seed uh and receive a body change rebecca to leave her husband leave her family for her husband on the drop of a hat notice azinath right to marry joseph the gentile she was gentile to marry joseph and bring forth his seed rahab to believe as we looked at sunday to believe the word of god and to want to be saved we want to be found in god instead of with the world samson's bride from timnath right ruth esther solomon's wife look at all those uh godly women look at the lessons that you can learn there and now uh since then we jumped into other women uh specifically eve the lessons we can learn there keeping all the word of god praise the lord uh jochebed uh trusting god to uh protect our children praise god what beautiful lessons deborah getting in the spirit the spirit of prophecy praise god uh macau of course we learned a good lesson from her on the what not to do never make fun of the holy spirit praise god and rejoice in the holy spirit amen love the lord and enjoy worship and then last week we looked at hannah the lesson of cherishing life above all else right being desperate for natural life and spiritual life we learn a great lesson and notice church all these lessons are from women right they're all from women of course you can learn a lot of good lessons from men but i think it's just amazing that god types even men uh you know as part of his bride part of his church because we've all got to submit to the holy spirit and i just thought we'd just quick just briefly just review those what uh what wonderful character god has placed in these women and he says this is the very in other words the the godly woman is the epitome of holiness right she's the very epitome of everything beautiful that you'd want to find right in nature right or in creation um just an amazing uh thing now i've heard one preacher say i think he went a little too far he said the woman was the height of all creation because she was the last one i don't know about that i would just say man overall because remember she was in man right uh when adam was created when he had his own body uh because i i don't know if brother brown said that i'm not i have to look that up um but the last thing that was brought forth was a woman right and she has the choice to be both uh she has a choice to be either uh the lowest or the highest right and jesus of course is uh the husband but she's the type of everything beautiful as a bride amen and so we learned these great lessons and i was just thinking that you know there's so much to her character look at there's so much to the golly woman's character we'll keep reviewing that you know we'll go back to uh proverbs 31 but just think about that for a moment remember all those things there are so many attributes to the godly woman in proverbs 31 just look at all that list look at all that she can accomplish praise god i just think come on look what god uh all the blessings god has put in a godly woman and uh it's it's exalted brother man said she's exalted to share the throne of heaven praise god i just you know want to remind us here that the scripture came to my mind i think i'll just uh look it up real quick you know we're not worthy of salvation but we are worthy of the rewards of heaven let's say it again we're not really worthy of salvation because christ took our place but we are worthy of the rewards after salvation because jesus said so amen so revelation chapter 2 i'm sorry it's revelation chapter 3 verse 4 you are worthy because of your walk i'm going to say that again you're worthy because of your walk amen verse 4 revelation 3 verse 4. if you got that case you can pull it up thou has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy how are they worthy how could the bride and sardis this is the the church age of martin luther how could they be worthy because they chose to walk in the right path right right we're not worthy of salvation we're saved by grace but we are worthy according to jesus you're worthy of rewards because of the walk you choose to walk amen hallelujah so we thank the lord for that and i just want to bring that out just real briefly remember your walk is so important praise god the walk your daily walk if you keep your garments undefiled if you keep them clean if you keep them white then jesus looks down from heaven he says you're worthy to sit with me on the throne amen oh just what a blessing that is praise god your walk makes you worthy of the eternal life rewards not of eternal life right that's my grace that's a gift for anyone who will believe anyone who will surrender you're you're given that as a gift of grace but the rewards and the position as the bride of christ is given because you're worthy of that because you walked you crucified the lust of the flesh you crucified the cares of this world you crucified all that and jesus said you'll walk with me in white because you're worthy amen now tonight i want to get now to abigail mary the mother of jesus and the perhaps we'll get to anna the prophetess so i want to look at these women here tonight by the grace of the lord what great lessons we can learn so abigail we don't have time to read of course everything in here but abigail is uh it's called beautiful and wise in the scripture in first samuel 25. uh she had though a really awful husband named nabel right his name means fool i mean who would what kind of parent would name their child fool but he must i don't know i don't know what happened but anyways he's named fool well he was rich right so apparently abigail's uh father must have married you know arrange the marriage right because he had a lot of money well he'll take care of her he's got a lot of money well she ends up and just has an awful husband right uh and you know the story you know david took care of uh you know nabels shepherds out there then he's he said mabel i'd like some help could you help me out and uh nable said who is david now everybody knew and history said they were all singing about david a few years earlier right all the women were danced around and said saul's killed his thousands david's killed his ten thousand everybody knew about david right he delivered them from the philistines right but a few years later nabel's like who who cares who's david and david said i'm gonna go kill this guy and every male in his house and uh abigail gets the uh the revelation i gotta go stop it right now and she watch your approach although she's got an awful husband uh she wants to save his life and look at that she wants to save his life right uh so she she packs up the camel's full right of all the all the uh the oil the wine and she takes all the figs and all the food and the bread and everything like that and what we learned from her is she has the right approach she stands in the gap for her husband right you don't deserve it but she tells david let his sin be upon me now how could god resist that kind of character praise god where she said put his his wickedness on me and don't do it and she has such wisdom she she doesn't rebuke david because david was going to do something awful right but she uses such wisdom to say no the lord is going to keep you from this david and she's able to uh she's able to dismantle david's rage now that's such a now think about that he's a man after god's own heart he's so passionate and you know good he's in good ways he's passionate but some ways it's bad right if he doesn't keep that and what can slow down a man what's the one thing that can slow down a man who's gonna go kill uh passionately kill these men what can slow him down a godly wise humble woman what what can stop this guy the only thing that can stop him is a woman who's led by the holy spirit praise god a man after god so not a mighty warrior who took down the giant goliath what can stop this man another giant no one's like this giant character can stop him amen hallelujah amen the character of a godly woman stops him from going to do the rage that had filled his heart so one thing is just like one thing got to him and he snapped right david just snapped he said i'm going to go destroy this guy all because he wouldn't give us a little bit of food you know wouldn't help us out a little bit because we'd helped him he snapped but then the wisdom of gabagail stops him uh from doing some awful things now she's such a wise woman now she's wise and beautiful the bible says right and uh we know the story she goes home she waits till uh nable's done getting drunk the next morning he tells her all that happened listen hon listen hon david was going to kill you last night but i went and gave him some of that and what the bible say she he instantly turned like stone and died you know 10 days later so look at this he's a he's a stone-hearted person but uh he's shocked by the love of god and the grace of his wife and and then he dies right after that like a temporary judgment right on his foolishness and look how it works out uh she's able now to marry in uh to david right married to david marian to the royalty right all because of her humble approach so she's in this awful situation but because she approached david the right way and waited on the lord in wisdom and and even stood up for this man her husband honored her vibes look at that she honored her vows she honored everything because she honored the lord in every area god is able to separate her from this past life this this this awful man and give her a a a husband who's after the heart of god oh man what a story all because of her wisdom and her approach now you know the story remember she fall down so it's a type of like coming to christ right just fall down just and bring an offering amen bring some worship amen bring some love approach jesus in the right manner praise god amen and so what does she do she offers a pleasing sacrifice to the husband i'm sorry to her future husband right and then she's accepted so we see this is a great type of romans 7 4. casey can you pull it up there romans 7 4. so she gives us this idea of a woman she stays in her position no matter what situation she's in you've got an awful husband or awful or opposite even a a wife i'm sorry a husband who's got an awful wife and you like paul said stay in that situation amen yeah there we are first corinthians 7 wherever you're called stay in that position your life will either sanctify their life or something will work out god will work it out you just honor the lord your life amen wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god now like this the bible said we were married to the law right and the bible said the law was a slave master it wasn't a good it wasn't a good marriage right but we're separated from that and now we're married to another praise god and so when i look at abigail i see that she's got a she's got a bad marriage to start but she keeps serving she approaches christ the right way and keeps the word honors the word and then god fixes it and god brings her into the best marriage possible praise god amen i think it's a type of spiritual things amen so we can see that god honors our approach our approach must be pleasing sacrifice uh we we must uh uh we must not try to fight our own battles amen glory we gotta let the lord fight our battles amen like that's what that's what david was gonna say there uh david said he was gonna work out his own salvation but god uh he didn't he didn't pray to god about that right so the lord allowed he sent a humble messenger right to stop him from trying to fight for himself and that's what that's what we need to learn constantly that the battles the ours the battles the lords amen he was going to try to fight his own battles and win his own wars and and he didn't pray about this one beforehand right he just he snapped right thank god church thank god when we snap god's mercy is there for us praise the lord but we we might we might think oh i'm going to do this now or well i can't i'm sure they're going to do that but the lord is merciful and he keeps us from doing greater evil praise god amen just a beautiful lesson there from a woman now look how she's just look who who's really the powerful one there he was we'd say oh david he's got the anointing he's but who's the powerful one that humble sweet woman that humble sweet woman who was obeying the lord and and used wisdom and grace and honored every she honored everyone in every situation she didn't try to do anything she let god do everything for her amen oh my so we see the the we see a woman's wisdom exalted in her approach unto god at church that's all we got to do in every situation we got to you know before we make any big decisions we got to go to the lord in prayer give him praise give him worship make sure we we're not a respecter of persons amen we don't respect persons praise god uh we oh we honor everyone with the word we respect everyone with the word and watch god he'll just work everything out amen abigail is a great teacher of this now for some reason i got a scripture on here revelation 19 16 and i'm not familiar with that right off hand so let me go check that out revelation 19 16 oh it says and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh name written king of kings and lord of lords okay as the type of christ or david as king and then christ is the true king of kings and lord of lords okay i see that all right now let's go to bathsheba he wrote real quickly like i said i'm going to go a little bit faster through these bathsheba i never set my timer here so let me set a timer here oh boy bathsheba now she was a disgraced a woman by adultery uh before legally becoming david's wife was forgiven by god and that blessed with think about that macau was cur right all is because she didn't like his day in the spirit all because she didn't like that worship and that that real holy ghost emotional worship she didn't like that she's cursed with no children but bathsheba we know she doesn't fight against it you know as far as david coming together on that awful night but yet she's forgiven by god and her womb is blessed think about that her womb is blessed so it makes us think that the thought was mostly with david that's what it makes me think right because if michael did that and she has not nothing coming out of the womb then it makes me think that she was you know bathsheba was just an awful place you know she really couldn't do much about it remember the bible said remember the bible said about david he obeyed the lord in everything except in the case of uriah's wife so it makes us think that she was just you know as a woman you know what in the day bible days she was a woman's value was little above property in other words the men would be more just as excited about having land as having a wife that's awful that's that's awful uh of course that's before the holy ghost came amen the baptism of the holy ghost but what was god saying the whole time she's far above rubies i don't know these men just gonna get the picture sister so i'm sorry and you little ones i don't know what it just it was the time in season sorry they just it wasn't their time and season to know that but sisters you little sisters remember that your value is more than rubies amen hallelujah you know just wasn't the time for it now she was so forgiven that she's blessed with four sons and remember her son nathan is in the lineage of christ right her son nathan and of course uh solomon too no no it's nathan it's nathan yeah it's nathan yeah nathan her uh she had four sons one of them solomon nathan is in the very lineage of jesus christ praise god it's amazing what god does uh his mercy and grace to these uh precious women now remember and then she helped secure solomon's succession to the throne right when david's other son was trying to take the throne without her you know solomon might not have got on the throne so let's read that that's first chronicles three verse five first chronicles three verse five i'll turn there if you can get up there but okay that's right first chronicles three verse five everybody glories in solomon which we know in his glory he was a mighty man of god but so often we forget that he might not have got there it's except god used bathsheba to do it and i know there's prophecy i know it all been fulfilled but look who god uses to carry out his will in other words look who look who god writes into the drama look at the parts that god writes in here this woman bathsheba and these were born unto him in jerusalem shimaya and shobab and nathan and salman 4 of bashua the daughter of amiel okay that shows the four sons there okay but through the story we learned that bathsheba she went to she went to david and ensured that solomon was on the throne in other words she made sure the word of the lord was carried out amen in other words she did everything in her power to make sure the word was obeyed and make sure that the word came to pass that's what we can do as well amen make sure we do our part to help the word of god come to pass amen right in other words the bride has made herself ready well in order for the rapture to take brace the bride's got to get ready so let's make ready praise god let's do our part to make it come to pass right and i love this she gave she made sure solomon got to the throne uh in other words we've got to make sure christ rules with preeminence both in the church and in our hearts right she she gave solomon the preeminence she worked to give solomon the throne and that's what we got to do we got to labor to give christ preeminence both in the in our church right here and in our hearts amen because colossians 1 verse 18 said that christ might have the preeminence in all things praise god so this godly woman we see her we see her in disgrace it looks like it's mostly david's fault but she's being able to be forgiven and bring forth sons right have great fruit to her life oh what a blessing church that great fruit can come out of our lives no matter what wickedness we've been we've been trapped in can i say like that no matter what wickedness we've been trapped in or guilty of ourselves great fruit can come out of our lives amen god is the god of grace god is the god of forgiveness amen and he's looking at our hearts right he's looking uh he's looking at our heart reaction like david every time he got caught in a lie what'd he do he said i'm sorry lord forgive me i you know that's what we got to do judas said i'm guilty threw the money away what rhett and hung himself but david didn't do that that wasn't david went back to god and he laid in the house of god amen he laid in the house of god until you know until he just had hope that god would do something right he had hoped for that baby that was lost but he he was looking for god's mercy he would always trust in god he knew god was a god of grace amen what great lessons we can learn from abigail bathsheba let's go now to mary the wife of joseph mother of jesus she is the epitome of childlike faith right she just humbly received the angel gabriel's promise that she would conceive the christ child in her virginity and then uh decades later she received uh the baptism of the holy ghost in the upper room is that something she received the seed of god she received the natural seed of god that everybody else might receive the spiritual seed of god she received the natural seed of god first when jesus was conceived in her womb but then on the day of pentecost her soul received the spiritual seed of the holy ghost amen i didn't see that until right now praise god what a blessing right she received the seed the natural seed and then she received the spiritual seed on the day of pentecost amen because of her childlike faith she said i rejoice in god my savior amen oh my praise god what a testimony mercy and church look at this so her testimony inspires us to live as chase virgins she just did everything in her ability to stay a virgin right natural and spiritual and she just you know so not only was she we always think about virgin mary natural but really she was just as much virgin spiritually praise god right she wasn't taking the lies of the enemy she wasn't believing lies she just believe the word receive it praise god amen because she wasn't going to receive anything from the devil right she was in the cast out and everything that satan brought and remember brother and said that that word from isaiah 9 a virgin shall conceive brother said that prophecy circled the earth until it confined a virgin that would receive it amen and then it struck her because she had a virgin heart to the lord amen that's what brother have said eve lost her spiritual virginity first before the natural because she received the wrong seed in the womb of her mind brother brahm said that's true that's very true but see this virgin was different praise god natural and spiritual she only receives the virgin word of god because she's the epitome of a child like faith glory she just quickly accepted it in one conversation just quickly accepted being unto me whatever you say whatever god's angel would say whatever god's messenger says amen to that praise god look at the faith that mary gives us now brother said it like this i love this quote so i'm going to read this quote this is just an awesome quote but man said i want you to look at the difference between mary and zacharias zacharias that minister that gossip minister or preacher church look at this man this guy's 60-something he's probably 50 or 60 years old he's been a fine scholar priest all these years and here's a 15 or 16 year old lydia right lydia 16 right so it's like a real adult you know man a warrior of the faith you know he's just rugged soldier god comes to him and then god comes to a 16 year old and who do you think would receive it better huh brothers just maokai knights brothers on the internet who's going to receive it this wise seasoned preacher man gospel preacher or a 16 year old girl who's got the real virgin heart to receive the word of god goodness gracious oh god help us praise god that's why church like we said a few weeks ago that's why we could expect some of our virgin daughters to prophesy in here because they don't don't take just because you're a man the word can come to you the prophesied word can come to any woman in here praise god because it don't matter if you're marrow female as far as the gifts of god just the preachings that's the only one that's separate but the branson that woman can do everything else except take the pulpit right everything else that gospel minister brother said a preacher as it was in that day priest in the temple he had known all kinds of things that happened before of all the miraculous power of god this man studied all the all the all the quotes can i say like that he said in all the scriptures he knew about all the powerful things of god and brother man said when the angel came to him he doubted it but mary he said said behold the handmaid of the lord she didn't question what could be or so forth so let's just remind our sisters and our brothers here tonight that god wants to give us promises but we've got to be humble enough to receive them praise god god is not a respecter of persons yes i hope god as the pastor i hope god gives me many revelations to help our church but i want to encourage our sisters god can reveal many things to you as well he said look how much more she had to believe than what he had to believe hannah had had a baby before when she was past that age sarah had had a baby before she was past that age but that had already happened many times but mary had to believe something that had never happened before right no other woman had ever brought forth a child like that into the world by knowing a man but she had to believe more than zac zacharias did so therefore she didn't question god she just took god at his word amen i like that take god at his word believe it anyhow no matter how impossible it looks to be believe god and he will bring it to pass praise god god help us praise the lord amen that's my prayer he will help us he's faithful he's a good and gracious king as we say amen but let me tell those our sisters tonight don't ever think you're too low that god can't give you a revelation because he can he can give you great revelations because the revelation of god's own son the coming of the messiah right the revelation of god in flesh it came to a 16 year old girl praise the lord right the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen that revelation came to a 16 year old girl and it bypassed the preachers oh what is this what's going to happen in this rapture praise god i wonder i wonder who's going to catch that revelation verse in the body change the i said i'll sweep from one church to another you know i'm not sure but it's going to get the people ready and then the moment twinkling of an eye they'll be changed in a moment in tweak never night but the season of the rapture it'll be it'll sweep it'll start going around the world to small or maybe some big some big bride churches around the world no doubt but it's going to go to those who have childlike faith just to believe the word amen he said just take god at his word i like that no matter how impossible it looks to be believe god and he'll bring it to pass and the church said amen amen what a promise of god this is mary's testimony natural and spiritual virginity to bring forth the word of god amen the word and flesh let's look at anna here anna anna was an elderly widowed prophetess she served god with fastings and prayers night and day and gave witness a baby jesus being the promised messiah redeemer at the same instant simeon prophesied of jesus's mission that was in luke 2 verses 22 through 38. now look at this woman she was married for a short while but then her husband died and she just said i'm not going to try to well i don't know what happened exactly but she found herself she said i'm just going to serve god in the temple day and night i wonder who was paying her bills but somehow god was able to provide for anna she didn't have a husband so god became her husband amen of course god always was right the spiritual husband but she she had such a love for god she said my ministry is to pray and fast for the church of god amen she said i don't have a husband i uh uh uh i'm widowed but i'm gonna devote my life to prayer and fasting you know that was in the book of titus as well paul says uh women he said women that are real widows have piety in the home and they don't go run off with young men that got money of course widows can remarry in the lord but it was a it was a it was a major thing in that day to be a widow because you had no way to get a job you had no way to make money and so god god elevates anna for her faithful service her prayers and fasting for the nation of israel in the house of god amen and brother and the bible said it was lifelong it was a lifelong ministry of prayer and fasting now think about that church he was i think 80 years old look and when does she when does she get the reward for all this when does she get the reward for all the praying fasting she gets it at the end of her life after decades and decades of faithfully serving god you know uh no one no one knew when the messiah was going to come but here her life her life is a testimony that if you serve god decades and decades and decades there will be rewards god sees our prayers and our fasting god sees our love and our praises and god's going to honor that he's going to pour out a great blessing upon us amen hallelujah like i told you about that brother herb who died last year but before he died his 60 year old daughter got healed of cancer and came in the message when she was out of the message i mean to me that's just a great example of just serve god faithfully week after week year after year decade after decade just like anna's testimony shows and god will bless you now for her she got to see god in the flesh so few people got to see god in the flesh she saw the word made flesh in church she'll be a witness praise god that god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hallelujah amen that's right praise god amen so what does diligence mean it means faithfulness decade after decade and if you diligently seek god he'll reward you with seeing god in flesh amen now to me i apply like this if we're diligent we'll see god in the flesh of our children right we'll see the word made flesh in our children or we'll see new souls saved or we'll see in other words we'll see people baptized with the holy ghost praise god amen and if and if god is really gracious to us then we'll meet jesus in the air he's the real one that was the word made flesh praise god we'll see him at the rapture just like she saw him at the first coming we'll see him at the second coming amen oh my that's beautiful god's rewarder of those that diligently seek him keep reading your bibles in the morning keep praying keep coming to church keep giving god everything that you have right give him everything you have he'll reward you as you diligently seek his face he's faithful and one example of a widow who don't have nothing she throws herself on the mercy of god the house of god and god lets her see the holy one of israel amen oh the the one that all they all wrote about for four thousand years they just wrote about him wrote about him wrote about it she got to see him face to face amen hallelujah faithful widow that just dedicated all of her life to praying and fasting for the people of god amen what a testimony i'll say like that i want my life to be like that too i want to have decades and decades of giving myself to the things of god praying and fasting right uh having a ministry serving god in uh faithfully at his house how many want that testimony oh my what a beautiful testimony that is mary magdalene i'll go to the next one here was healed from seven demons the bible said healed from seven demons healed from seven demons by christ then faithfully followed and supported his ministry and she was even present at the cross notice that while all the men all the big time preachers i'm not i'm not bashing them i would have done the same thing so i'm just trying to encourage our sisters well all the big-time preachers left that were sent out and had campaigns and miracles and they they these women just stayed there they just made sure jesus had food and they took care of him and clothes and a place to lay his head they made sure that you know could find a place to sleep at night just to take care of him she was one of those but she stayed with jesus and went to the cross right and saw jesus die what a powerful testimony jesus rewarded her faith remember she had the choice she could have went back to prostitution right bible said she had made a lot of money right she could have went back to that but she forsook all of it to support the ministry of jesus christ so jesus rewarded her by making her the first to see him after the resurrection my wedding something right there goodness gracious a prostitute who had seven demons is the first one to see the resurrected christ amen and what lesson it is for us that we were uh we were uh we were adulterers with the world the bible said we are adulterers and whoremongers and liars and stealers all these things right but god blesses us we get to see jesus one day praise god that's the great promise that we have in fact the dead in christ will see him first amen hallelujah and then we which are alive and remain shall be called together to meet the lord in the air amen so see we get the same the same idea we get to see the resurrected christ right if we're faithful with him if we if we follow his ways if we're we're dedicated to him and we don't run from him and we thank him and we live our lives in gratitude for his healing power praise god then he will let us see him uh face to face at the rapture praise god now church look at that we should be thankful right we can enjoy the same freedom from devils as mary magdalene right some of us you know thankfully the children hopefully haven't had demon possession right thank the lord for that praise god there was things things i did i'm sure there was at least one demon inside of me you know at least one but she you know after being healed by jesus she comes out of that right she comes out of that and she's like i know what it's like to be bound by seven of them and this man he's a great man he's he's the greatest man ever he drove these demons out of him i'll never go back to those things i'm gonna follow this man amen this man speaks with authority praise god he this man's got power and she dedicated her life to that she knew what it was like to be free and so she stuck with stuck with him throughout all the trials of life amen and that's what we must do we must be devoted to christ in gratitude for our freedom in the lord amen hallelujah we once were chained up right and unbelieved for our sins but we've been set free and so we must thank god for our freedom that we have be devoted despite our trials and one seat one day we'll see the messiah at his second coming amen we'll see the resurrected christ where do we get all these great lessons from women because the church it's a mysterious but she's actually the bride of christ the highest calling in the bible brother graham said the highest calling is to sit on the very throne with christ how am i doing on time all right good got by six more minutes praise god looks like our close to this one the samaritan woman well we'll see we'll see how it goes here the samaritan woman meets jesus at jacob's well instantly recognizes jesus's prophetic gift when he reveals her secrets oh that's just like me the first time i saw brother ram's gift i knew that was a prophet amen i don't know i seen it on a video i seen him discerning the thoughts and tense of the heart i've never seen anything like that praise god and it caused her to boldly testify to her city making many more converts to christ believers experience the same discernment ability of the living word today right the holy spirit discerns the thoughts and intents of our heart and women in particular learn the power of testifying to others about jesus without preaching right so that's what our sisters can do our little sisters right uh our adult women they have all the author or power or authority to testify right women can testify come see with a man come see a man that told me all the things i ever did right here's a woman who shows the power of a testimony and this is what priscilla must have done with apollos right because the bible said priscilla and aquila talked to apollos and showed him a more excellent way the baptism of the holy ghost because all he knew was john the baptist so apollos must have been teaching the word and priscilla must have been testifying one of the holy spirit did this the holy spirit did that then the holy spirit did that and she was testifying and it was such a testimony that uh it it allowed apollos to enter into the holy ghost baptism amen and notice it was it was a team aquila and priscilla worked together to help apollos it wasn't just aquila it was priscilla right and that's what we asked to be our prayer for our sisters that their testimonies can be so powerful it will turn others to love jesus right without even preaching she'll have to say any well this means this in the bible she have to interpret anything she just has to say come see what jesus did for me praise god they can testify and it has powerful effects that's what we learn from her recognizing the prophetic gift right instantly we see that and we go make others known of what we've seen praise god amen mary the mary of bethany a sister of jesus's close friend lazarus she's a powerful example of hearing the word and acting upon it right despite her sister's objection mary chose to sit and listen to jesus rather than complete the housework and christ approved of mary's decision is there ever an end to housework sisters is there ever brothers well there's just two of us here that's right brothers is there ever end of your to-do list no i wish there was sometimes i really wish there was but you know she mary had work she could have done right martha said master i'm doing all this by myself but christ approved of mary's decision saying she chose the better thing and all that she heard would never be taken away from her so that's where we learned that the revelations we receive are eternal and the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we've got to put revelation above all our worldly duties we've got to put uh sacrificing uh things we've got to report sacrificing the cares of the world amen we got to sacrifice the cares of the world and put the revelation of the word high above that that's the lesson we learn from her and it can never be taken from us praise god hallelujah yeah we go we could all go make another buck right i mean we tonight we could we could get a part-time job we could have gone made another dollar right could have worked a little harder you could go get a part-time job you could fill out a survey and win something you know you could you know earn some cash some kohl's cash actually i don't know where that came from goes cash but just you can earn cash right we could all do that but we choose to set aside the things of the world that we might gain the spiritual treasures amen that's right and i'll close with priscilla who i kind of mentioned earlier the wife of aquila she showed diligence in the faith by working alongside her husband to help paul she hosted church services in her house remember the bible said uh send greetings to aquila and priscilla and the church in their house remember that scripture that's first corinthians uh i'm sorry romans 16 3 they had a house church and they also testified to apollos about god's further revelations the message of the hour so here we see the importance from priscilla we've got to stay in our position right she didn't become a preacher but her testimonies help the preachers hallelujah she wasn't a preacher but her testimony helped the preachers that's beautiful and of course opening your home to the gospel right and the power of testimonies we learn all this from priscilla all right a woman's home is her domain right that's her nest right but she was willing to be flexible open up that home in order that the word of god might be preached there's my hour where's yeah there's my hour let's stand to our feet praise god the bride of christ is the type of all things clean and beautiful holy she is a womb for the seed of the holy spirit and the all the receptor of all the blessings of god by she's the bride of christ she's so worthy that she's exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen musicians you can come how many like those queens they've heard about tonight priscilla mary sister of lazarus the samaritan woman at the well mary magdalene anna mary mother of jesus bathsheba and abigail all these lessons we learned now you little sisters you got a lot of great role models in the bible now there's and plus the ones in your home too the ones that are your mothers and your grandmothers you got some real good characters to look at and i think there'll be times in your life when these each of these women sisters will speak to you and you can pull such power and such uh uh such encouragement from them like when i first started pastoring hezekiah was my favorite guy he was 25 when he took the kingship i was 25 when i took the pastor here you know i just i gained so much strength from that at that moment in my life you know last year paul became really important to me because he was set for a defense of the gospel i felt like i was defending this message last year and so i you know as we go through life you know david you know before that it was david a man after god's own heart he served god for his generation i want to be i want to serve god in my generation i want to do god's will for my generation praise god and each each stage of my life there's someone who speaks to me more and more and i want to tell our little sisters find one of those pray find one of those sisters that we just read about tonight or one of the other ones that can be your inspiration because what the bible say all scriptures written for what are admonition our edification instruction and doctrine use these women as examples that you can try to imitate by god's grace thank the lord praise god let's have our heads for word of prayer here [Music] heavenly father we're just grateful for your word tonight lord god teach us through their lives dear god lord i don't want to forget that even me as a physical man spiritually i need to be submissive like a woman and to be part of the bride of christ so lord i can draw inspiration from these like mary i want to be a spiritual virgin in my mind dear god i only want to receive the promises of god in my thoughts what a testimony from a 16 year old or so young lady and bypass the preachers who should have believed it oh god but you went to a humble heart that just said i believe everything the word says feed unto me according to what the word [Music] thank you lord god for such powerful testimonies and i pray you'd encourage our young sisters in here and of course our mothers all the sisters listening grandmothers lord i pray you to encourage them tonight lord god that the holy spirit is looking for someone to receive the word [Music] share the word by testifying i prophesy by humbly staying in position and keeping people from doing evil like abigail talk david out of the wickedness he was going to do by wisdom by the power of a godly woman and her godly character oh god bless our young little sisters with this kind of anointing it's such a mystery god the most despised people of the old testament these women were honored in such marvelous ways by the holy spirit we see some of the greatest character lord god pouring out of these women that were hardly more valuable than land just a little bit above slaves oh god but lord to you they were worth ten thousand worlds you were teaching us lord about the slave master of the law you were teaching us things [Music] yet your grace was sufficient lord to all those sisters [Music] lord we thank you for these revelations lord how they tie with the rapture lord god may we be inspired by these things here tonight as we leave lord god quicken some of these thoughts to our our hearts that will meditate them as mary as mary did she kept these things and pondered them in her heart lord may we keep some of these thoughts in our hearts this week help me especially lord sometimes life seems like it's going 100 miles per hour [Music] i can't remember what i preached a few days ago lord help me god to hide these things and keep them in my heart dear god like my brother encouraging me to only be strong and courageous i'd forgotten all about it and it really helped me lord it encouraged me help me jesus to keep these words in my heart [Music] and i pray lord you'd reward all of our faithful sisters in our church of course our brothers too but as we look at women here remind them that you're a rewarder of those who diligently seek you bless them lord reward them we thank you for the honor lord as the bible says the men should honor the women as weaker vessels yet lord we understand the honor of the holy spirit the christ-like character thank you jesus hallelujah we love you lord god we're gonna keep these things jesus christ [Music] in all the ways [Music] um [Music] and [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] bye [Music] oh [Music] and you thought [Music] we got to see the mary song beat unto me according tonight over here for a while that's the kind of faith we want praise god [Music] me [Music] is [Music] free [Music] oh
