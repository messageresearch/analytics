========================================

series uh Souls that are in prison I preach one sermon on it I like to continue I forgot to finish that I only preached the first part of that so I appreciate that reminder sister was really timely that's God that's God here see here staying in that word I love that stay in the word yeah that's awesome wonderful so I'd like to get back to that one and preach that so maybe we'll look at that Sunday uh Monday I put out the video on are there church ages you know so thinking about that this week of course they're T All Through the Bible um so that's been a good video there okay so I want to type this out here I just SE another U gift so now this would be the uh eighth out of nine gifts of the holy spirit we'll see it at the end of this chapter here uh the gift of knowledge operates through Philip's life and Ministry acts 8 verse1 we'll read that and then we'll have you see here actually let's just read it together just one verse let's begin there on three one two three and Saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles so we'll see later why the apostles had to stay in Jerusalem we'll see that later I think chapter 15 uh but may God add his Blessing to the read of his word may be seated praise God so I'm just going to review real quick by God's grace uh We've uh seen tongues interpretation in chapter 2 verse 4 prophecy dreams and Visions mentioned in 2 17 and 18 we saw Doctrine and 242 we saw the miracle the lame man leaped and walked and had faith in his name so the miracle of faith and I'm sorry the miracle of the lame also the gift of faith in Acts three and acts 4 in Acts 5 Peter has discernment of the LIE of ananas and saf and also in Acts chapter 5 the miracle or sign and wonder of the of the sick being healed in the shadow of Peter and other healing so the gifts of healing uh chapter 5 ver 21 they taught in the temple again teaching in Acts 610 wisdom Steven's wisdom could not be withstood he was so wise uh he gave all the right words at the right time and then in here in chapter 8 Philip will give the word of knowledge because the the unic asks uh who is this speaking of in other words I don't have understanding who is this speaking of and Philip preaches Christ unto him amen so now we're at already eight out of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit uh here in the first eight uh chapters of the book of Acts praise God so uh verse one says Saul was consenting unto his death I'm not mistaken this is the first mention of St Paul uh in the entire Bible if I'm not mistaken and the word consenting is quite a word it means uh to approve together with others it means to agree to applaud so uh Saul had such an evil spirit on him it was like he was applauding the death of stepen this martyr and just it's amazing to think about how he can go from one extreme to the other but that's the power of the Gospel I love that I love that he was I love the change this is the change that Christ does and this is the proof of the gift of of of the Holy Ghost this is the proof of the book of Acts church when someone that hates the truth will then eventually love the truth praise God Amen someone will rejoice in Christians being mocked and made fun of but then becomes the one that is mocked and made fun of praise God it is proof of the power of the resurrected Christ amen he was consenting unto the their death uh the Bible says hallelujah and now I want to uh read this quote here because the Bible says uh in verse one then they were scattered so a persecution comes against the church I notice for the first few we'd say weeks or months or years of the church there's not really a persecution other than they were arrested twice remember we saw that they're arrested one time they're just arrested the next time they're beaten though beaten and arrested but now a great persecution comes and what does the persecution do it scatters them abroad except the apostles so the apostles kind of hide out in Jerusalem uh but all the other non- Apostles or many of the non- Apostles are scattered abroad and brother makes a statement in investments in 1963 I found this quote today of course I'd read it before he says uh sometimes he says the very facts of evidence that you failed he said uh he said how different the Pentecostal group is today from what it was in that day speaking of the day of Pentecost when they got the Holy Ghost they got rid of what they had to start the ministry remember earlier in chapter 4 uh they sold what they had in order to help out the Saints he says today we try to say we got millions he said and all like this here he said now that is right it sure is truth we call ourselves Pentecostal he said I said one time at one of the meetings I heard some of the preachers testifying he said uh I said you men I'm among you because I love you I think you've got something but I'm here to help you to do everything I can I hope you understand me tonight all you done was tell me about how many Cadillacs you got think about that he says and he said that man has got more Cadillacs than you could ever have tell about how to get rid of something they got of this worldly stuff and get something in their heart God's word to vindicate it amen he says there was a f little Pentecostal brother he may be sitting here now nothing against him he raised up and many of the businessmen sitting here knows this is exactly the truth he said but brother Bram that's where the great mistake was made so brother Ram says you know when they first got the Holy Ghost they sold what they had but these preachers are saying but now we got the Holy Ghost and we get more and and and one of those preachers was the rich preachers raises up and he says that was a mistake that they sold everything they had and brother said I said what mistake did God make amen hallelujah God doesn't make mistakes Hallelujah right in other words the early Apostles when they did this when they sold things to help out people but R says God wasn't making a mistake in the apostles amen amen and then the preacher said why those people that sold their goods and divided amongst the poor like Jesus told this rich man to do divided amongst the poor they made a mistake for as soon as a persecution arose they had no home to go to so that was the argument of the rich preachers see persecution came they had no homes to go to and brother says he said my brother you claim to be Pentecost and think that the Holy Ghost can make a mistake God's word ever Remains the Same amen amen he said well they didn't have any place to go so see this is just one perspective so the rich people look at this verse and say oh the the Saints got scattered see that was a mistake they had no place to go but brother Rand looks at it and sees persecution plays into the plan of God Amen difficult times in our lives trials in our life times we persecuted it's not a mistake of God God's using it for his glory hallelujah amen and brother tells us the purpose of this they said well they don't the apostles didn't have any place to go brother said that's exactly what God had them to do it for in other words God allowed persecution God will allow tests in our lives to get us to do something we wouldn't do on our own praise God hallelujah he said they went from place to place scattering the gospel they didn't have any place else to go see he said but he said but today we're so different amen so carinal M looks at this and said oh the poor Apostles they should have sold their their houses and they should have had more money and they wouldn't have to leave Jerusalem but brother R looks at it and says no this is God this is God scattering the word of God amen hallelujah look at verse two and devout men carried Steven to his burial and made great lamentation over him notice devout men devout men buried stepen what's devout mean it means uh reverencing God Pious religious so I I think we can go to that scripture how can two walk together except they be agreed when a man of God when a real man of God dies The Devout ones the religious ones the ones that are pure are saddened by it right Hallelujah so see devout people people that love the Lord people that have gifts people that believe in the Holy Ghost they all hang out together praise God right amen that's right the Bible said they went out from us because they were not of us hallelujah that's right so we know those of us who hang around here we're birds of the same feather Hallelujah we got eag feathers hallelujah amen dve feathers amen hallelujah amen because we stay with the word of God hallelujah amen nobody can drive us out because this is the truth of God's word amen amen in other words I'd rather stand with you than anybody else no matter how close to me or what family members might not agree with the word of God I'd rather stand with you because you stand with God HJ amen praise God Amen devou men hallelujah we're the ones that cared about stepen now notice Church those devout men would have saw they would have seen with their eyes saw holding the coats applauding yes kill him they would have seen that man remember they had trouble when he come back remember right we're going to get to that they had trouble receiving this preacher because they saw him stand right there again shows the power of the resurrected Christ hallelujah amen praise God and so notice great lamentation so Saints we understand this Holy Ghost filled people even though they know they they they would have heard that stepen saw Jesus right before he died even though they know he's in heaven it's okay for Holy Ghost filled people to weep and mourn over saints that they've lost hallelujah amen didn't Jesus weep at the the grave of Lazarus and how much Holy Ghost did Jesus have the fullness amen the fullness the full authority of the godhead bodily dwelt in Christ and he went for his friend so Church don't ever feel bad you know if you miss your friend ra says we we love God but sometimes we need god with skin on him sometimes you want to hug a brother or shake their hand or sister right sometimes you need god with skin on it so I just love how the Bible records these religious men these holy ghost filled men they wept over their friend their brother maybe their Mentor maybe their leader you know and some ways as a deacon and as a a miracle worker they wept over him and the Bible records it it's acceptable it's a Godly thing to weep at a man or a a sister a servant of God who passes away that's a good sign they a real Christian praise God Amen oh it's a beautiful story verse three and as for saw he made Havoc of the church entering into every house now listen this is how he would go into house mes and hailing men and women committed them to prison now the word Havoc means to dishonor to defile it means to ravage ravage it means to devastate or ruin so every house Saul would go into he would ruin the house I don't know if that means spiritually or naturally but this is a a man who would become the first church age messenger who was a prophet of God think about this my a man who is lifted up to the third heaven praise God and God said don't talk about it it's too holy now later John was allowed to talk about it because you can't get no higher Heavens than the Throne of Jesus and the church said amen so Jesus forbid Paul don't you talk about it but before that he was guilty of going into every house and he would blaspheme the name of the savior he would blasing them and he would Bring Havoc he would try to destroy their house anybody ever tried to destroy your your friendship with somebody your or your family relationships that's what Saul that was his full-time job I'm going to try to destroy this church destroy this family I'm going to try to bring fear upon them and God turns this man around hallelujah praise God this is the one that God chooses amen sometimes we you know the one God chooses wouldn't be our first choice but God has the right choice amen you got to trust God and remember this man then worked harder than all the other Apostles of course because his past would haunt him right right and then he would want to prove the Bible said uh I believe Peter said that we should make our calling an election sure he wanted everyone to know I'm a changed man hallelujah amen I'm not the saw I used to be I'm a new man Paul all old things have passed away all this has all passed away amen I used to destroy Christians homes but now I destroy the house of hell of Hell give to the name of [Applause] Jesus a man would tear down destroy a Christian family but then he would go to tell husbands love your wives as Christ love the church destroying the hold of Satan hallelujah amen this is a man of God but beforehand he was a a creater of Havoc he would destroy and devastate and ruin Christian homes and families it would seem like right and the Bible said he would hail them which means to drag now last time I laid hands on Malachi a couple Services ago he would drag them out of their homes to the prison drag them and the Bible said he did this in every house that he went into is that right that's what verse three says he would hail them men and women he would drag them men and women committed them to prison imagine he loved to see free people lose their freedom and become slaves imagine uh the children he'd probably take the adults right where would the children go he'd break up mothers and children and fathers and children and he would just be so happy afterwards he W he was against Christ he destroyed families so see how he'd be so motivated to never do this again he he would just have so much motivation I'll give everything I have I'll get whipped and look God and remember Jesus said I'm going to show him how much he must suffer for my name sake right because he brought suffering upon the people of God my goodness right and then God had him write the majority of the New Testament for us the holy words of God amen amen the words that we all be judged by this is the man Christ chose how many how many of you Christ chose the right guy let's go over to First Timothy chapter 1 this was in my notes there don't want to forget to read this I mentioned this over the years you know numerous times but I think I want to read it again just to encourage you 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 11 according to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God which was committed to my trust so the gospel was committed to Paul the good news was committed to his trust even though he persecuted and jailed the people and applauded when stepen died about this gospel it was committed to his trust and I think Christ Jesus our lord who ha enabled me for Heath counted me faithful putting me into the ministry this man's faithful to Jesus yeah see church this is why some people have to have this is why Moses needed a burning bush experience this is why Paul had to meet Jesus in Arabia because he done so much evil Moses murdered a man right right I think the sight sound did a good job it was just this this weak old man and he murdered him like so Moses would not have felt good about it and how could he ever forgive himself amen sh how could he ever move past his failures God has a way of moving you past your failures I put that quote out today where uh brother said what a consolation to Joshua because God told Joshua as I was with Moses despite his failures I'll be with you hallelujah amen amen amen and that way I know even if I fail God won't leave me because he knows I'm trying Hallelujah and God's looking at your office or your position as a Christian that's what he's looking at but he's not looking at your failures cuz you confess them Hallelujah that's a Joshua commission and we're the Joshua church amen as God was with Jesus as God was with Paul as God was with Martin Luther John Wesley and we so God Is With Us amen God With Us the same way he is no different he's the same yesterday today Hallelujah that's the Joshua commission what a consolation Hallelujah Joshua could look and say praise God as God was with the murderer ter Prophet so he'll be with me praise God Amen God didn't leave him when he didn't circumcise his boys and he should have been killed by an Angel God didn't leave him amen church God God wants us to learn from our mistakes but he doesn't want us guilty over all of our mistakes amen he wants our mistakes to motivate us to Future obedience amen hallelujah God counted me faithful a man that wed havoc on the church a man that applauded the death of Christians that's who God chooses of course he repented verse 13 who is before a blasphemer again so Paul or Saul would blaspheme this Lord Jesus but then Jesus would look past it because God Jesus knew he had a purpose for this manen Hallelujah he would blashe he would call Jesus the devil be elab but God knew he did it as the Bible said in ignorance he was ignorant of it he just been taught the ways of the law the ways of the law he hadn't actually met him praise God oh Church it makes all the difference when you meet Jesus hallah I was raised in the chur I saw am for my mother but I hadn't met him but once I met him let me tell you I became a new man you became a new woman a new man because you met [Applause] Hallelujah just need to me US each one of your children all the te whoever it is each one just needs to meet Jesus it makes all the difference [Applause] amen he was a blasphemer no longer a blasphemer though who was a persecutor an injures and I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief hallelujah thank God for Mercy amen how many can say tonight I obtained Mercy I got it amen not something I'm hoping for I got Mercy amen I get it every morning amen hallelujah yes I know there's more the future but I got it right now praise God because what what I did I did it in ignorance if I would have know now or then would I know now I would not have done it that's what the Bible says about Saul Saul would not have done it if he would actually had the personal experience thank God for a real experience God amen amen like I told you before I used to come to church as a teenager and just sit like this the whole time in Sunday school I was just thinking about sports and everything like that what would make what would take me from that to a preacher who dances and praises the Lord that's the church and praise God I met somebody I never met before that's what Happ amen cigarette smoker whatever you know all kinds of things like that what happened I met somebody I never met before amen I met Jesus am sad to say I used to make fun of Christians in high school I even texted one this we I was on my knees praying on Monday morning and this young man his name is Daniel he came on my heart I texted him out of nowhere I said how you doing he said thanks we're not forgetting about me I'm going to keep texting him by God's grace he would try to call encourage me to be a Christian I'd make fun of him and now he's left he's battl on homosexuality and look who God has play look who God has running after him now he was running after me now I'm running after him praise God Amen Hallelujah I said don't you want to leave California I sent him that video I made brother R said it's going to fall California is going to fall in the ocean so you might want to consider moving he said well thanks for sharing we'll see how it goes by God's grace but God takes the the those that are ignorant and gives them an experience so we're not ignorant anymore amen hallelujah aren't you glad Church you're not ignorant anymore amen amen you know there's a God you know his name is Jesus Christ you know he's the way the truth and the life praise God amen yes amen yeah now he says verse 14 and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world what do you do to save Sinners of whom I am chief oh thank God amen hallelujah amen he said he's the chief of Sinners then he also said I'm the least of all the saints amen right Hallelujah look how he now look and think how great he was in the eyes of God but in his eyes he was the lowest of the low may God help us to always see ourselves as the lowest of the low if this man is a chief of Sinners and yet God used him in such a mighty way Hallelujah right that the Bible said he heal his prayers healed everybody on the island of Mita we'll get to that right every person that was sick the one with the bloody flux just the blood wouldn't stop flowing he lays hands on it and the blood dries up amen hallelujah yet the chief of Sinners he realized there's nothing good in me if anything is good in me it's going to be Christ May the Christ that's in Our Lives May It Flow out to others praise God Amen oh I love that yeah now church that's how we should see it Jesus Christ came into the world to save us sinners of whom we could say we are chief praise God verse 16 how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first now look first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to everlasting life now this is such a beautiful thing this is the I believe this is a proof text that Paul was the first church age messenger because brother Adam said Paul sets the pattern for all preachers to follow in other words every preacher is going to try to be like the Apostle Paul Hallelujah so diligent so dedicated so hardworking so humble amen I'm the chief of Sinners I'm not the greatest Christian of all time I'm the chief of all Sinners amen I'm the pattern the pattern of longsuffering God was very patient with me God waited a long time for me praise God right amen God waited 19 years until I finally surrendered till I laid down all my crowns of sports crowns or whatever my medals or whatever Pride I had 19 long years he waited but God was patient hallelujah amen amen God was patient Hallelujah Paul had to lay down all of his previous thinking all this he said oh I was a Hebrew of Hebrews I was the Pharisee of Pharisees I was the most legal of all the legalists but I was the pattern that God would show mercy on me and then God would show Mercy to all of us hallelujah amen that's the pattern he's the pattern if God was merciful with a man applauding killing Christians and bringing havoc and Destro destroy and ruining Christians homes if God will be merciful on that then God will be merciful on you and I that's the pattern amen God sent Jesus to save Sinners of whom you and I were pretty bad Sinners I guess I can't say Chief Paul said he's Chief and I'm not going to argue with the Bible but I must be like maybe one or two above him if he's the chief I'm of course I'll have no rewards near his because he had those three missionary trips and but I just want to be there praise God I just want the Holy Ghost I just want to be in the Millennium praise God I just want to be with Jesus am I'm the lowest of the low you know I just want to be with Jesus amen that's what I live for amen amen that's why we preach the gospel so he's the pattern notice a blasphemer but he did it ignorantly I told you this before I used to make fun of people that spoke in tongues when I was a teenager my brothers and I would Snicker and laugh we'd be like this I'd be going like this to cam and Sam like hear them right in the middle of it all and how many times did I blasting the Holy Ghost but God was merciful to me amen now I pray for God to speak in tongues now I pray God send us the tongue send us the interpretation give us America I want more of God I love you God I did it ignorantly I never would have done it had I met you before hallelujah amen amen that's the pattern pattern is unworthy unworthy dirty filthy Destroyer Destroyer but I'll make you a son and daughter amen that's the batter amen I'll forgive all your unbelief all your ignorance I'll forgive all that and I'll make you a real child of God hallelujah Hall he Lydia's got a lyia gave me a good thought this week I didn't get to it but after David brought the ark up the first time good good observation Lydia remember us touched it I just read it this week he died David's like how do I bring up the ark God's like go read the Bible we all make mistakes we all got to read the Bible sometimes I'm not put David down he's way more man a man of God than I ever will be but then the Bible said Lydia pointed out the ark went to a Philistines house and God blessed the Philistine I said a Philistine you know that's like uh Goliath people Goliath people right so this Philistine either he was a proelite to Judaism like maybe Uriah the hittite notice he's a prite but they still call him the hittite Hallelujah he ignorantly was a hittite but then he became a real believer praise God and he became a mighty man of God Amen I like this once the word of God once the ark once he had experience amen once OED Edom had experience and he was no longer this Philistine worshiping the Philistine Gods God blessed his house because the ark came in the house amen God had mercy God was showing a pattern of Mercy I don't care if you're Goliath's family I don't care if your Goliath's people if you love me I'll have mercy on you I'll bless your home amen CU that's the pattern amen we're all Sinners we all fall short we all ignorant ridiculous things sinful things but if you humble yourself I'll bless you H the AR of God our homes bless my bless my church bless my school bless my job wherever I go Bless Me Jesus amen amen hallelujah praise God I thought that's a beautiful thought OD OED Edom three months that house was blessed I would if I been odm Edom i' been real have a real hard time seeing that AR C are you sure David that you don't feel led to have it stay with me I've been blessed these last three months but the beautiful thing is now God don't live in a box anymore God lives in a vessel hallah God you got lots of temples of the Holy Ghost amen therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are God Amen this body really isn't mine I'm just a manager Hallelujah I just got to manage this thing Hallelujah and then if I do that then God will bless me for taking care of his creation his property praise God I'm not my own I am I belong to Christ amen that's why I got to beat this guy in this objection amen toey God's word more Hallelujah you don't like it I still got to read my Bible I got to force him to read the B I got to force him to get in the closet I got to force him to get on his knees cuz he don't want to right that's fine I'm the manager praise God I'll make him do it praise the Lord amen hallelujah hard to get to verse four here all right now let's go back now uh acts 8 Acts chapter 8 I really enjoying go through the book of Acts this is really fresh and to me church again the purpose of this is to show us we we can't be discouraged you know about the gifts of the holy spirit that's kind of my purpose behind this because we are a continuation of the book of Acts right as long as we're trying in our best if we're doing our best to be like the book of Acts then God is pleased with us hallelujah right the the book of Acts covers 32 years according to uh Scofield so we don't know all that God did did but God did things over the course of our lives that were so wonderful right Hallelujah over the course of their lives so many wonderful things and how many of those one time I have to do this one of these servants coming up I'm going to place each one of them our our testimonies how it's just like the book of Acts hallelujah amen glory I look forward to that by God's grace but it's it's that simple that we are continuation who else is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right who else is fasting and praying and giving to the poor you know who else is doing that who else has the doctrine of the Apostles right amen hallelujah amen like I went last time I went through those 14 doctr that's just 14 there's way there's way more who else is keeping all of those commands it's got to be us because of God's mercy hallelujah it's got to be us because we're the ones keeping the pattern all right amen hallelujah like brother I just heard brother say he said to if I ever saw a church uh that was more uh with the word he said I'd shut these doors down and we go support that church but he hadn't seen it if we'd find anything better we' go support it praise Goden and so we haven't seen anything better yet so we stay right here we we know it's going to be better it's going to be rapturing Faith that's going to be better God amen amen and also we must look for revivals in our church we must pray for revivals in our lives amen amen amen hallelujah amen you must look for those things and if there would ever be anything better we would just run and back it up immediately praise God amen amen verse four now that's look at the Havoc that Saul caused Havoc verse four therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word of God scattering so when people get scattered they spread the message now I'm going to drop this thought on you I don't know if you ever thought about this when I first started preaching I was one of about six preachers in our church at Lima brother Brooks brother Craig brother cam brother Tim Myers brother Randy verton brother Simon did I say Simon again and myself talk about a church if we' have stayed together brother malol that been a real church or preachers is that right I think look at the gifts of God in that church right there and we were just you know all young in the faith we didn't know who's going to preach or not I I didn't know for sure you know right at the beginning but sometimes you know brother BRS and I have talked to they we talk wow I wish we really would have enjoyed that because I didn't know you know God was going to spread Us wish we really would have enjoy what we had there and then we we talked about it what if we all would have stayed together right what would that look like brother Brooks preach every Sunday morning you know then we rotate you know right but look at all the preachers there and that's just like the the book of Acts here God had to scatter them because they got 3,000 baptized on the first day I don't want 3,000 just at one church right amen hallelujah God wants to scatter the message praise God amen amen hallelujah but look what we got now because God has scattered the message say we got a lighthouse lighthouse we got a lighthouse in this dark leoan Wicked age we got a lighthouse in Napoleon amen a lighthouse in a amen a lighthouse in Massachusetts with brother Craig amen hallelujah got a lighthouse out in Iowa there was no Pastor out there they were streaming Jeff Jenkins church for years just streaming wish we had a pastor wish we had a pastor they kept praying for a pastor and brother Brooks came in there some I forget the super natural whether it was a dream or a prophecy and he said the Lord has told me to come here and it was Vindicated I forget all these different details but now there's a Ministry out there and now second church is kind of sprung out of there but now maybe they're coming together but God wants to spread this word amen thank God God didn't keep us all Li cuz now amen gets to hear the word of God do you too he one of us God has to scatter sometimes how do I leave my precious place but you must leave whoever God's called you to leave in order to serve God's purpose amen amen right amen hallelujah the very thing that might be dear to you like Isaac and Abraham the very dearest thing to Abraham was Isaac and God asked you to sacrifice that for me the very dearest thing to your life think about what's the most dearest thing you would say God please don't take that if you took that I'd really be hurting now for most of us supposed to be our family right our family but God said that's the thing I need to test you do you love me more than this right you love me more than that as much as I love my fellowship with brother Brooks he's a real man of God a real Pastor a real friend I he calls it the Buddy days I miss those buddy days right brother Craig just sitting and listening and teaching in Bible I take all these notes I love those days oh those are the Golden Days brother Bram says those Golden Days oh my but God had to do something else praise God God had to spread the word of God Amen and so see church we can't be discouraged no matter how small we are right because God set each one of us here amen I didn't ask to come here amen you didn't ask to come here God called you am God determined the bounds of your habitation God scattered you from wherever you started cuz God wanted you right here hallelujah so we must stay encouraged we must keep the fire burning amen we must keep looking uh at the book of Acts and said I'm trying to be like that with all my heart I want to be like that hallah I want the power of the Resurrection I want the doctr of the Apostles I want the faith the original faith that was given to the fathers hallelujah amen yes amen amen you had to scatter them Allelujah so see more scattering is more testimonies more ministry right brother say I preach maybe once a month or twice once every two months and here I preach as much as I want sometimes too much no I appreciate that brother he said no no thank you brother I appreciate it love you no you you are very loving people I I would have it no other way I need at least one break a month and I feel pretty good if I can get one break a month I feel good enough because the because the atmosphere is what refreshes me yes it's the atmosphere usually your songs buddy and then all the testimonies of people and the prayers afterwards it just brings the when the presence of God comes in and I start weeping and praising God or dancing like M like Sunday I'm dancing up here with a great testimony that brings refreshment praise God Amen it's the joy in the house of the Lord and the joy is my strength amen amen that's what makes me strong praise God Amen because I have the joy of the Lord amen the victory of the Lord the victory of the Lord is here the victory of the Lord is here I can feel in the atmosphere the victory of the Lord is here s that afterwards Hallelujah so more scattering means smaller groups but more Ministry more lives can be impacted amen the Bible said they preach everywhere this is what Jesus said he said go you into all the world and notice they wouldn't go on their own right God had to drive them yeah sometimes church we won't go talk to that person unless God drives us to talk to that person Hallelujah but see God's in it God's in everything amen God's in persecution God's in difficult times God's in scattering you to places I I didn't want to really go here didn't really know what I I didn't know what i' find Abraham when I went out Hallelujah but as I know is that he sent me praise God all I knows that he told me to go so I'm just obeying my heavenly father I'm a child of Faith just like Father Abraham praise God Amen I'm going out I don't know where I'm going I'm just going because he told me to go praise God Amen and I'll find out when I get there his purpose for me amen remember the Bible said you have no Greater Joy than to see your children walk in the truth now that applies naturally but Also spiritually because Paul had no children but he said all you Thessalonians he said you're my joy and my crown amen amen he said I he said I cherish you as a nurse cherishes her sick amen or a nurse cherishes her children so see the people Paul Had No Greater Joy than to preach the people and see them believe what he preached amen hallelujah church we get No Greater Joy than to see the word of God being received am the word of God being eaten the word of God as your daily bread hallelujah amen that's why I really encourage you she sent me these texts and I love those texts because she's in the word of God she sends me a quach from brother Brandon I like that sister not everybody has to do that but I like that she feels led to do that praise God I like that Cas is finished in that church age are you almost done with that church age book I'm very close very close oh you can taste it the victory of finishing the church age book that's the first book I read after the Bible amen that's been the foundation of my Ministry is that church age book just like Tim fruit Tim br after brother died they just sat in their house and read the church age book until God raised that church up now I don't know what God's going to do with me but what I'm saying is that I'm standing on the Bible revelations God gave to his Prophet because God will do nothing amen God surely will do nothing except he Reveals His secrets to his service the prophets hallelujah hallelujah I love that amen well we don't need a prophet we don't need a prophet nonsense God won't even do nothing except he shows it to a prophet first amen it's exactly right he scattered them brother ra said he scattered them and I'm coming down to close here let's see go to Matthew 13:47 1347 it's interesting I mentioned this uh scripture on Sunday I didn't even mean to but I you like that's why I inspired as I was studying today this quote came up from Brother brand about God scattering the the church I tell you church sometimes it's hard I don't get to see my mom on Christmas I don't going to see my dad on Christmas I miss my dad I cry about my dad I miss cam and Simon I now I get to see them more than anybody but I like that I kind of have control over that I can see them kind of if I just invite them anytime I want you know I I miss him but you know God scatters us for a purpose in that though we find God's purpose amen and God separating us from family separating us from friends God sending us here there God got we find God's will for our lives amen amen so acts uh Sor Matthew 13:47 sorry Matthew 1347 and again the Kingdom of Heaven is like into a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to Shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away so shall be at the end of the world this is the end of the world Parable the gospel will bring in all kinds of people like I said we've seen it now we don't know the end of some of the people that have left us but we know the current fruits they're manifesting right the angels are come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them in the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth here's what brother says brother said see that's the way it always goes the first few years of the the Pentecostal Church ausa Street it was wonderful right right away there was a persecution come in the second year and Scattered the everywhere third and fourth years they began to find the church just a little bitty groups there was like five men besides four or five women that was a church amen I'll read it again brother said it always goes that way and the church said am day of Pentecost 3,000 adding adding adding all of a sudden persecution God scatters them everywhere they go from a big mega church right down to small little bitty groups that's how God always does does it amen hallelujah right God doesn't want you to trust in the numbers God wants you to trust in him God wants me to trust in him not in any other source God wants me to look to him God wants me to trust in him God wants me to know that he scattered me for a purpose amen amen just like the pattern of St Paul Paul cannot just stay in one place well let's just grow our ministry let's how great and see how great we can become no God had to send them out on three missionary Journeys as they went through and then he spent the last 10 years of his life from prison to prison right from from uh house arrest to house arrest to prison and finally to prison in Rome that's how God orchestrated his life and he said I'm a pattern for all believers after me to show the long suffering of God how many thankful for God's mercy am man said see how it is this is testimony 1953 it's always that way God just sends out a great gospel net the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man he went to the Sea and threw in a net and when he drew the net in he had everything that wed up in the sea he had it in the net he had fish Turtles water spiders serpents he had everything now it's not our business as preachers to say this is fish and this is that right so it's not our business to say that so I got to be careful what I say right we just pull the gospel net and then it isn't long when you see a Revival go on many people get saved and praise the Lord but see some of the some of those are fish and some of them are we'd say turtles Right it isn't very long to you say well I didn't believe there was anything to it after all and here he goes running right on back into the puddle again now church we I'll just use this as example from this year this year we've had young men and young men dancing in the spirit with us and within a few months they're out in the world right aren't you glad you're still here it proves you are a rainbow trout Hallelujah whatever to call yourself it proves you're the right kind of catch for the gospel net praise God Amen never wered away I don't know he's a fanatic such fanaticism you know like a spider Car Land I didn't never like that to begin with you're not that kind you just Slither away like a serpent like some of these women do today right they walk like serpents or I guess they walk like pigs cuz they got the high heels you they walk like pigs walk and they walk away and say I didn't believe that in the first place he's a Holy Roller anyway you didn't do that because you're the right kind of specimen amen you're just what God wanted God made that net so it would catch you and God made that net so he would keep you in his arms amen I'm not walking away this is what I was born for praise God right I finally feel like I'm at home amen hallelujah I wonder ay into that Wonder into that there's got to be more there's got to be more I found more hallelujah amen I found what I was looking for praise God I found my heart's desire I'm SE I'm seated at the master's table praise God amen amen that's what that's what fishermen do they bring in the catch so it can go to the master's table and here we are sitting at the master's table feasting on the body word of the son of man oh Hallelujah that's how it always is that way Malachi Victoria that's how it always is God scatters the church right he sends out the net pulls it in and whatever is of god stays with God stays with the message message of the hour glory amen the preacher don't have the right to say this is fish this isn't fish he said it isn't very long to you say well I believe there's nothing to that anyway that old water spider you know plop plop plop told you that wasn't right after all well he goes back to the water PL PL see I knew brother Jesse wasn't right there I knew brother Aman wasn't right there I knew that sister was off the word that old serpent will start hissing and said I don't like the way they do do things I don't like how they run that church I don't like how they they preach I don't like how they pray I don't like how they sing or dance right on back to the water it goes let it go let it go now do we give warnings before they go sure do we try to text them and call them tell them come back sure we try but a snake's going to go back where it came from the snake ain't going to the master's table Master don't want snakes at the table but there's some fish in in there too God knows let me say like this few there be that find the master's table so most of the catch is the wrong kind of creature right but a few of them will be kept for the Master's care hallelujah amen the Master's desire God knows they're fish by nature and that guy's a spider by Nature he's a serpent by Nature aren't you glad you're a fish by Nature amen hallelujah and God is the one who does the election and the calling and it's just our business to preach the gospel is that right God does the calling one plants another Waters and God takes the increase amen right let's read that as we get ready to close here they went everywhere preaching the word of God that's 1 Corinthians uh chapter three if I'm not mistaken I didn't have time I just thought about looking that one up here I guess I thought about it but I didn't have time to get to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 yep uh 35 so in verse yeah in verse three though Paul says they're carnal because there's strife and divisions and one saying well I'm of this preacher I'm of that preacher they were too much looking at preachers don't don't get me wrong the Bible said give double honor to preachers but these guys were arguing too much about preachers right right we just we give honor to like like I said you know I made a video about uh brother random uh give honor to him honors do there's a poem that a sister wrote in 1962 it's a beautiful poem there's nobody like our brother Bill I've made that YouTube video last week it's a it's a beautiful poem we thank God for our brother Bill brother Bill Billy Bram Hallelujah but that you just give honor you don't give worship right but you can give honor give double honor Hallelujah but see they arguing verse four for one while one sayith I'm of AP another I'm of Apollos are you not carnal m now it's not a sin to say I go to akan or I go to Sheffield or I go to De Mo Iowa that's not the sin that's not the way they were saying it they were saying it by Strife other words they were saying I'm a little more spiritual than you because I go here they're arguing about it brother said God does the calling amen one plants one Waters but it's God who gives the increase Hallelujah in other words you and I can't really save any Soul it's God giv the increase of the Soul all we can do plant water or the other illustration all we can do Saints is cast out the gospel net right let it sink in there when it looks like it's got some trying to pull it in but it's God who allowed those fish to come around and get caught in the net right it's God's net hallelujah amen amen God does the calling God does the increase Hallelujah verse five who that is Paul and who is Apostles but ministers by whom you believe now remember what's a minister a servant preachers have to be servants right I like when uh sister B just I'll say sister can I take out the trash or I already got the trash she'll say I say no no can I take out the trash please she'll be like okay something like that you know I just like that please let me be a minister praise God let me be a servant let me not become so prideful let let me just see if I can humble myself more praise God amen amen because this is the kind of preachers in the Bible they're the ministers who are we're just servants yes we should have faith like Stephen now Steph was a preacher we should have faith like Paul we should have faith like wonderful Faith but at the core we should be servants to the body of Christ amen who are they who's Paul and Apollos we're just ministered but yeah my brother Apollo said he knew the scriptures he was might in the scriptures that's true but that's just his ministry that he's just a servant in other words the way he serves God Is by memorizing the scriptures preaching the scriptures knowing all the script that's how he serves God he was born to memorize the scripture he was good at memorizing the scripture some of us aren't so good at memorizing the scripture that's right but that's okay that you weren't called to that you were called to minister in another way praise God Amen and God will be pleased God will accept you praise God as long as you been the pattern of God's longsuffering amen amen as long as you keep the pattern of God's word I'm serving God out of gratitude because I was a sinner but Jesus came to save Sinners Hallelujah of whom I was awful I wasn't the chief but I was awful and but because of that God had mercy on me and now I can live a new life in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen I'm here to be a servant I have planted Apollo water so Paul put the seeds of the original word is that beautiful the spoken words Original Seed he put the Original Seed he spoke the word of God wrote the written word in the Bible he planted and then Apollo come around and water that I'll just water that see church I can't do it all right brother Diggs can't do it all brother samel brownie can't do it all but we all play our special part amen Amen brother Samuel might have planted a seed here now I got to come watering praise God Living In God's Presence amen hallelujah Authority in the presence of God hallelujah amen and same thing I I planted some seeds out in Iowa about dancing now they got to water it right God come around and watered our dancing with brother Jim shoe he watered it I planted it he watered it but it's God that gives the incourage it's God that makes that word live Hallelujah that's right see we all see God is the one who gives the increase amen so we don't go pat on the back oh you're a good planter you're a good water you're the one that gave an increase no no it's actually God that gave the increase amen look at verse seven see I'm not done so that neither is he that planteth anything so see really we're all nothing right right because you can plant seeds all day but if they don't get the right conditions they'll never have an increase you can water your garden all day but if it don't get warm you ain't getting any increase Hallelujah so let's remember we have to work we have to do something for God we have to do our ministry but that doesn't make us anything other than just saved and grateful for the word of God right just make Us Faithful Servants just makes us ministers neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his labor for we are labor together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation see plant the seed and another builth thereon but let every man take heed upon how he builth thereon now church I believe this fits also uh for a local ministry right so some of you you know some of you I I might be the first message preacher you ever heard right but so see I planted the water I'm sorry I planted the seed we got to have guest preachers come around and water that seed right first first preach I heard was on tape but really is brother Simon I guess you know you need to listen to this brother you need to listen this I'm glad I listened to it praise God finally I I got time to listen to it he might have play that se but I need brother Craig to water I need brother Brooks to water I all and then and then in God's time it brings forth the increase and then Simon is one with brother Brooks I'm one with brother Craig we're all one with each other we're all one the Bible said we're all nothing but it's God who gave you the new life it's God who brought you to life amen amen amen amen it was Jesus who brought Paul to life amen amen it was Jesus said sa sa why do you persecute me praise God Amen God brought the God brought him to life hallelujah amen and want to close to brother mentioned the us stre remember church when they first started in 1906 there was an initial surge remember this preach this last I'm sorry beginning of this year they had a surge for two years surge hundreds thousands coming all the time remember even seven months into the Revival Charles parum came and Charles said oh uh he said there's there's not enough segregation here right he was a real he must have been a real Rascal and they kicked him out but it caused some people to get upset and leave the movement that was just seven months into it and then in in 2008 remember some of the women they they took they went to uh the man's office Seymour they stole all his addresses of his uh newsletter that he sent out and took them I think they went out uh I I think they went North to Washington they stole all his source of income because he was sending out he was he just needed help he couldn't afford that he didn't have a job he was a blinded a oneeyed blinded preacher he only had one eye he wasn't working he was just praying and preaching all the time so look at that two years in the Revival these great things happen what was God doing brother said God was scattering those preachers right don't keep it all here and say well we got it here we're never going to lose it well one thing for sure if you got the Holy Ghost you're never going to lose it amen in other words don't be like you got to stay in one spot follow the leadership of God hallelujah amen God had to scatter them out and he allowed trials to come in remember why those women left they they left because the preacher got married they said the Rapture is too soon we shouldn't get married and they called a false Doctrine ain't that something but see God allowed it to allow the message to be spread hallelujah amen they they hit a second surge they had a second Revival or was it it was a 1911 they had a second Surge and then lo and behold World War I started in 1914 and that caused many of the brothers to have to leave so really this this revival lasted seven years but there was three years in the middle from 1908 to 1911 where it died down so what can we learn here church we we're going to be on fire at times and other times we just have to get through some difficult Seasons right but I'll say like this Our God can restore amen hallelujah amen two wonderful years of Supernatural and then a decline for three years but then it raised back up for three more years praise God Amen all things are possible with God God had to spread them out they couldn't all just be at brother Seymour's church God wanted them to go to China right God wanted them to go across the sea to Germany Russia God had to send them out there God didn't want them all in one place God wanted others to hear the message that's our feet praise God hallelujah bless you how many enjoy the word of God tonight amen this is the book of Acts church and I'm thankful to be a part of it amen hallelujah God had to scatter me out now church I never want to put I never I never want to put a period after what God is doing in my life until I cross the over side the other then I know he's done with me but said God won't let Satan take you or death even take you until he's fully done with you so while you're here you still got something to do amen so I never even even in myself I never want to put a peer and say well I'll always be an AC I hope I'm Bo here because I love all of you so much I know you love me and my family but I never want to put that there in case God is going to spread us out God's going to scatter us so we can go do some other work for the glory of God Hallelujah you never know remember brother uh Nathaniel SC told us it was last year at this time remember he said God put on my dad's heart to resign his Pastor after 40 Years of pastoring I'm at 17 and a half I'm not even halfway there and all of a all of a sudden he said you know brother brother Randy told told the testimony at cam church he asked God for different signs God gave him every sign and when he resigned Nathaniel it was on his heart to be become the pastor and now brother Randy's traveled over to Europe and he has all these testimonies of people being encouraged helping the ministers in other words God has a time and season for everything yes amen and church we are to be servants we're to be ministers amen and we're to work together as one to spread the gospel Hallelujah that people might look at Paul's life and say that's the pattern in other words God's going to forgive me of all my foolish ignorance amen God's not going to hold my past against me right I might have to suffer for my past but God is going to form Christ in me the hope of glory like Paul said even though he suffered he said it was Christ working in me mightily praise God I hope you can see that that God works in your life mightily he works in your life more mightily than denominational churches look at the Catholic church this week did you see what the pope said the pope put out the letter and he said all you priests you need to bless homosexual marriages he said but at the same time we're still we are still uh our our our Doctrine is still one man and one woman but we can bless homosexual marriages and you know what the preachers said about this they said this causes so much confusion and the church said who is Mystery Babylon what does Babylon mean confusion in the same letter God blesses homosexual marriages oh but yet we're still one man and one woman that's total confusion right and I was shocked I was listening to this pres I was listening to a presbyterian preacher read through the article that they put up and he's like this is so much confusion he said maybe some of our Catholic friends will come out and he kept using the word confusion aren't you confused confused confused I'm like Lord the Lord's like smacking me waking me up that's what Babylon is right it's confusion but not here we have the right divided word of truth it's is clear to me night and day God wants one man and one woman the rest is an abomination in notice she's the mother of Abominations the mother of all that but what do we have our mother is the New Jerusalem praise God in other words our motherland is heaven that's going to be my Mother's Day message I think but I'm going to preach on the future home I think so just don't probably forget about till I'll probably forget about it too how we thankful for the grace of God today amen I'm thankful that God's grace was rich unto me his Mercy was abundant to me praise God when I didn't deserve it when I didn't act like it he saw the seed of God he saw a minister in my heart pra he saw a servant in my life aren't you glad God saw something that maybe you couldn't see praise God Amen I'm glad he knows the beginning from the end brother amen I'm glad he didn't judge me by the first 19 years of my life I'm glad he was able to look past my faults and see my needs praise God let's bow our heads here for word of Prayer of course if anyone has a need of pray morning welcome to come up for pray but let's bow our heads here as we approach the Lord father God we're thankful for tonight Lord what an encouragement to look in the word of God lord I can truly see my life in Acts chapter 8
