sister see ya there Lily hi Lily god bless you you're looking all nice and combed lookin fresh mice had a good nap revelation 4 I want to just pull out a few thoughts I had you know in preparation yesterday I'll be honest I didn't have as much time to study on this as I like to I may devote more time to it but I just want to bring out a few thoughts that the Lord I felt the Lord placed upon my heart here I hope they'll be a blessing to you by the grace of the Lord let's go to verse 4 what is we revelation 4 verse 4 I'll read that for us I'll just read it myself verse 4 and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold amen may God has best seen as reading his word you may be seated here by God's grace you know last week I thought oh I got so much energy I can preach to services then I feel all worn out you know from this week of work so I give as much as I can tonight by the grace Laura I was hoping to preach about 45 minutes so I know Lydia is gonna say wow you up daddy he only preached 45 minutes so last time she was surprised can he do that of course and I wanted to I'm gonna put a little picture I want to put a few visuals up here if I can so I switch over here okay when you're ready I just want to review a few things here like I said I'm just trying to focus on the 12 tribes so it's the par 5 and I like to focus on the lives of the elders just as much as the scripture can give us you know there's not a whole lot about details about the lives of the 12 sons as as I search in the Bible dictionaries to try to get more information on their lives but I just want to look at their lives and as a as an example of the grace of God how many love the grace of God oh my after this morning you know even after this morning as we see how just a few hours before Jesus was crucified his disciples are arguing about who's greater think of the grace of Christ you know to extend mercy to us and then he you know fills him with the Holy Ghost and he makes them these twelve outers that sit right next to the his own throne what a what a merciful God we serve you know we're very elated about the grace of God for us so so I just want to only use this for a little bit I want to show this again I showed this before then I'm gonna jump to the the tribes that look like this I spend most of my time on this yesterday with this thought but I'll come back to that the different how the tribes change I'm gonna go through that a little bit tonight by God's grace but let's first look at these lives of the the 12 sons but you know of course Jacob you know I'm sorry Joseph had two sons ephraim and manasseh that took part in the twelve tribes and we'll go through that - we'll go through all all of them by God's grace oh really I'm looking at 14 tonight we're looking at 14 cos Levi comes out Joseph comes out for a while dan and then I'm sorry Ephraim and Manasseh come in and then Dan Ephraim go out and so you have this this interesting addition and subtraction of the tribes so it's quite a thought and like I said I haven't had as much time to devote to it as I like to but from what I would have gained the last week or two out I do want to preach that so let's look at the first one let's look at Reuben and Reuben is surprisingly one of the sons that we have the most information about of course Joseph would be the most but we have quite a bit about rubra now Reuben means behold a son he was the oldest son of Jacob and Leah as we looked at last Sunday now let's go to Genesis 35 let's just take our Bibles and yeah let's do a little bit of just a little bit of Bible study here Genesis 35 22 and I'm last week but I didn't really you know touch on it as much I just kind of want to emphasize it here and I hope this encourage you you know I know David could relate you know to Reuben because here Reuben makes a really awful sexual mistake and yet later church this is the grace of God this is the whole point of this message later he's given a crowd in a robe and he's right next to the throne of Jesus Christ himself now church is at mercy or what that is tremendous mercy that shows you the power of the blood of Jesus Christ so Genesis 35 22 malachi can you read that for me you got it now of course you know Jacob was awful upset about this will we're not gonna I don't have much time to look at that but this also reminds us you know he laid with basically his brother's mother right a half-brother laid with a woman that also his father laid with now this kind of reminds us of that remember that man in Corinthian the Church of Corinth who had up with his father's wife or stepmother kind of reminds us of that situation and so you know when someone makes a sexual mistake we just can't necessarily say they're going to hell we can say that because in both cases they knew better Rubin would have known better you know he was of the lineage of Abraham you know he would have known better and of course the Corinthian believer would have as well he came out of the church that Paul started and there's no way Paul would have started the church and then not left them the Word of God to know how to behave sexually so he would have known better but Paul said we kick him out but admonish him as a brother let him know he's still brother if he repents so Reuben is guilty of this awful sexual sin and you know his father Jacob even remembers it when he pronounces the the kind of the prophesies of their lives let's go to Genesis 48 verse 448 actually 48 for yeah so this thing was always remembered by father and that's what proverbs says I've been looking at proverbs again and the Bible says those sexual sins like adultery and some of those awful sins they impact everybody and they're hard to get over there they're so they're so hurtful so 48 verse 4 Lydia can you read that for me yeah 48 4 all right I think that's the Joseph yeah I'm sorry the Joseph in verse 3 it says that I'm sorry I must have the wrong one Oh 49 okay thank you yeah I do have that one too I have both of those that's strange yeah 49 3 & 4 yeah Lydia you read 3 & 4 in chapter 49 all right now so see his the father still remembers this at the end of his life and caused him unstable as water does that remind you of anybody else reminds me of Peter how Peter was so unstable before the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know one day he's walking on water give it a few more years he's like I'll fight I'll die for you and then he runs at a maid you know who's trying to accuse him of being a follower of Christ which he was now this is the we'd say the hard part of Ruben or the the sins or the weaknesses of Ruben but later you know of course we know he redeemed himself we don't have time maybe it's go - lets go - 37 yeah maybe we have time Genesis 37 21 and 22 37 21 22 something must have happened to Reuben so even though we had sexual sin even though you know he didn't he actually loses as the Bible dictionary says he loses the honor of the firstborn he loses that honor because of what he did with his father's made in there or is he yeah made woman handmade that's kinda what I'm looking for so 37 21 and 22 I'll just read a and Reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him and Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again so Reuben at some point must have had a heart change right because first he was kind of did something awful to his father unstable well now he's so stable he stands up for a brother that's not even his full brother right this is Rachel's son so the some of the writers said you know he laid with Bilhah to kind of get back at his father but then here he stands up for the the son of Rachel and his father and so obviously he showed kindness to Joseph he was willing he wanted to save his life and he would go to great lengths to do that and he had a plan to bring him back so now Reuben has a heart to restore before I had a heart you know to do evil sexual sin now he's got a heart to save life and to restore life amen and that beautiful and then church remember when they were down in Egypt remember when he went down into Egypt he come back to Jacob his father and he's like if we don't bring Benjamin back he said you can add my two of my sons he was so willing to to stand up for life and he was so willing he was so sincere after that I'll just say it like that his sincerity really increased so of what we know about Reuben he had a really unstable start a really awful kind of start with his sexual sit and but then by God's grace he kind of got caught the redemption of God God was able to redeem his heart can I say like that so Reuben forfeited by his crime he forfeited the rights and honors of the firstborn but God does redeem in later did you know that the Prophet Hosea came out of Rubens lineage and Hosea was calling back the people remember he said return to the Lord return and so we see a lot of Reuben in that Reuben left through sexual sin but then he returned to the Lord and member in such a way that Jesus Christ gives him a crown and a white robe and said you sit up here you sit right here with the elders oh my that's beautiful okay next like I said I he's one of the ones we have the most information on now Simeon was the next one Simeon was the second son of Jacob by Leah he was associated with Levi in the terrible act of vengeance against Haymore and the sheet you might remember when they defiled their sister he was one that it was an awful thing it was a really evil thing he was detained by Joseph and Egypt as a hostage his father when dying pronounced malediction against him so let's read ed forty-nine five through seven forty-nine five through seven genesis forty nine five through seven Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of Cruelty how would you like your dad to say that about you Oh son you were such a great son you were an instrument of evil this was his word that Jacob speaks about him and in their habitations oh my soul come not now into their secret under their assembly mine mine honor be not thou United for in their angers through they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I would divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel in that striking that's what we know about Simeon he was cruel but one thing to encourage you I think I'll just start briefing this he was there when they went down Simeon was there when he went down into Egypt this is the these are the tribes going down in the Egypt here's the tribes coming out Simeon still there of the 144,000 this is the 404,000 simians still there and in the millennium simians still there as well so we know for sure Simeon was one of those 12 that sits right next to Jesus I don't know which of the 12 they were I don't know if it's the 144,000 twelve I don't know if it's the millennium 12 I'm not sure I mean if you know help me out after service you know because I need to study that out but Simeon although called khru by his father he must have had a good sacrifice right he must have presented the right kind of sacrifice because again he's given a crown as a ruler right and he's given white robe of righteousness of eternal life amen so see that's this that's what part of this message is I wanted to bring this out I wanted to show you there they're strong points but also they're failures so we can be encouraged about how God can redeem our lives and your family right your family you can think oh how could God ever redeem their lives but God can if God redeemed a Reuben from his sexual sin and Simeon from his cruel heart and his murders I mean that's what he did he murdered those men they murdered them after remember these circumcise him first and then while they were circumcised he had them murdered this I mean look at this cruel he's that's a very cruel thing to do but yet somehow the blood of the sacrifice was able to Humble him he had to repent because Christ gave me eternal life amen amazing aren't these things amazing like to me this is so amazing the love of God these are the ones God chose to sit on the throne the 24 elders my striking okay Levi Levi the third son of Jacob by Leah his name means join or adhesion he's mentioned as taking a prominent part in vengeance sister Dinah he and his three sons went down with Jacob into Egypt where he died at the age of 137 years once we - one about Dinah well did we just read that one I'm sorry yeah we got to read that one okay yeah we did said Simeon and Levi our brethren instruments of Cruelty are there in their habitation so again Levi was there at the beginning remember he went down there into Egypt did he come out oh no he was serving them now when they come out okay because he was getting he was separated then later on by Moses and he was gonna serve the rest of the the tribes now remember Levi is inserted now so now Levi's been abhi accepted by God very soon when the hundred forty-four thousand are filled with the Holy Ghost so God is putting that tribe back in at the time of 144,000 so currently Levi's being gathered by God or the RAM said they might have lost all their records but God knows the record Amen God knows the genetic dejenne the necks of all the tribes and he's bringing him back together praise the Lord but then he's out so Levi's out in the Millennium so he must be out serving again or something like that I'm not sure but he said there at the beginning he's there at 244,000 but then remember the original that came out of Egypt and if you notice these two right here are the same these two are the same because they both have a ephraim and manasseh and they both have Dan and ephraim back in so we'll get to that more in a little bit by God's grace okay Judah was the fourth the fourth son of Jacob by Leah and his name of course means now I'll praise Jehovah Judah also interposed in behalf of Joseph so that his life was spared not only did Reuben stick up for Joseph so did Levi is it interesting that you know elyes remember he was he was one of the reasons that the priesthood went to the Levites because remember he stopped the plague when the Midianites were sleeping with the Jews or I'm sorry Moses the people remember he went in and Eleazar took the spear and thrust it through the man and the Mobin Irishwoman and of course he was of the tribe of Levi I'm sorry I'm speaking of Judah I'm sorry I got the wrong one there sorry about that Judah interposing behalf of Joseph okay so Judah did okay yeah sorry that was wrong forgive me that was wrong that was wrong I got those mixed up that was Levi now let's go to this I want to read this here Genesis 43 verse 3 so I got your Bible with Genesis 43 verse 3 here's where he helps out with with Joseph verse 3 Genesis 43 3 and Judas spake on him saying the man did soundly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you in other words he was gonna make sure they saw Joseph again he's gonna make sure he said if I don't come back with Joseph I'm not coming back either in other words I'm gonna die before I'll die if Joseph can't come back I'm putting my life on the line I'm gonna make sure with my life Joseph you see Joseph your son all right now go to Genesis 46 here let's go there 28 she happens 4628 and he sent Judah before Monday Joseph direct his face unto Goshen and they came into the land of Goshen amen so Judah went before them right to make sure everything was all right with Joseph now go to Genesis back to Genesis 49 verse 8 and 9 here's where Judah Judah takes the firstborn prominence of the family because Reuben lost it because he slept with Billa so Reuben lost the the firstborn and that's why Judah is listed first I don't know if you caught that but they're listed in all kinds of different order their lists I listed them in the order they are in the Bible so in Genesis 35 Reubens listed first they're listed by age here coming out of Egypt they're listed by I'm not sure but Jude is listed first because the rulership was with Judah and this is where it says it right here so Judah basically takes over the firstborn status although he was the fourth born son so that's in verse Genesis 49 verse 9 and 10 Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up now here's where it is the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be alright see that so now he's got the scepter Reuben lost the scepter because of his sin and now Judah becomes the leader of the family right and we know who is the line of the tribe of Judah the Lord Jesus Christ amen so see you can see how that ties in perfectly the scepter shall not depart from Judah because Jesus is still ruling today amen but all we just have a heavenly kingdom and soon it'll be an earthly Kingdom praise God ok Dan is the fifth son of Jacob his mother Billa that's the one that Reuben slept with and he's also called the his name means judge because God hath judged me and the Bible dictionary says he's probably kind of foreshadowed as a judge because Samson was one of the greatest judges of Israel and Samson came out of Dan so let's see that's the main thing about Dan there's no like I said as we get to some of these later sons there's not much given about their lives so the ones that we are given the most on we just emphasize those but Dan was such a godly man he was there here here now his tribe his tribe lost we'll get to that in a little bit the tribe lost their position because of sin we'll get to that in just a moment here but he himself would have been a godly man and there he is back in the millennium praise the Lord he's back in his position in the Millennium alright Naphtali not much known about him individually although he had four sons he means my wrestling so I believe Naphtali stays the whole time yeah the whole time so God recognizes his righteousness the entire time by the grace of Lord and I just put a little note in there some of them we don't we know very little about but God saw their works and gave them a robe in a crowd right there's not much known about you and I may be right we might not be very famous people but God sees every one of our works amen and we can earn a robe and crown as well praise God although not much is known not much is written about Naphtali not much is known about him but God is watching every one of our works amen that's an encouragement to me praise the Lord dad he was the father of many sons his name means fortune God has given us fortune also means a troop cometh so he's as a great group and he's the father of many sons that's really all that's known about dad but I believe he stays the whole time as well yep dad live such a godly life he remains there and he'll be one that has a robe in the crown praise the Lord amen eighth was Asher Asher again we don't have much on him he was Jacobs eighth son his mother was Zilpah Leah's other hand or Leah's handmade and as the dictionary says of the tribe founded by him nothing is recorded beyond it's holding a place in the list of the tribes it increased in numbers 29% from Genesis 35 to Exodus chapter 1 during the thirty-eight years wanderings the place of this tribe during the march was through the desert between Dan and Naphtali okay so see oh here's a good thing about it Anna the prophetess was of the tribe of who was that Asher okay so remember Hanna the one who prophesied of Christ and it's all Mary there in the temple that was from the tribe of Asher an Asscher means happy happy praise the Lord all right we're up to the ninth one already I told you this wasn't gonna be very long it's a car is the car was there the whole time as well yep praise the Lord the godly man instacart not much recorded in our books but no doubt in God's books his name means hired God hath given me my hire said Leah Leah birth Tim the ninth son and he had four sons at the going of the going down into Egypt he had four sons at this point he had four sons going down into Egypt okay so there's a blessing pronounced upon him let's read that Genesis 49 14 so he actually had a good blessing pronounced upon him okay Genesis 49 14 it's the car is as strong I'm sorry is a strong ask couching down between two burdens and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute okay so he's a type of a servant there but it's a blessing upon him and in fact there's a lot more blessings I could have preached down there but I didn't go through that chapter very well chapter 49 that'd be a good one to follow up on okay so that's not a whole lot about it's a car that I found Zebulon the actual Bible Dictionary says little is known about his personal history although he did have three sons Zebulon but I believe he stays the whole time as well the godly man yep godly man Zebulon yep there he is Zebulon he was the youngest son of Leah all right now the 11th RUP the eleventh joseph we know a whole lot about him there's a whole he as these one we know the most about right the eldest of Rachel and Jacob and he was a perfect type of Christ praise the Lord so I don't want to I don't really need to preach too much on him other than he was a perfect type of Christ he went down of course or I'm sorry he was there before they went down to Egypt went down to Egypt ahead of all of them and then his sons replace him when they come out which is interesting and then he's back in at the 144,000 and then he's taken back out in Ezekiel here in the Millennium so again I'm not sure why that is like that let's look at Benjamin little is known about Benjamin it means the son of my right hand so Benjamin was right last week when we looked we talked about that other died Rachel died when giving him birth and his last at her last breath named him son of my pain but Jacob changed it to son of my right hand one thing that's interesting about Benjamin is they were very famous for being good archers and slingers so they were warriors they were fighters from the tribe of Benjamin and so it looks like Benjamin stays the whole time yeah so he's one of the twelve godly man Benjamin type in the hundred forty four thousand praise the Lord Amen now Ephraim now Ephraim and Manasseh a member are the two sons of Joseph okay so remember the first incident recorded about Ephraim is that along with his brother Manasseh before their grandfather Jacob that he might bless them the intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder the two but Jacob set ephraim the younger before the brother okay so ephraim remember got the blessing member when Joseph or when God crossed his hands remember God had Joseph crossed his hands and Jacob gave the blessing to the younger one ephraim so Manasseh was offset heating at the blessing the blessing went to the younger and member brother Aaron tight that as the blessing coming through the cross the cross of Jesus Christ the RAM typed Ephraim as the Gentiles and Manasseh as the Jews where the RAM typed it that way and the blessing came to us even though we're we weren't the first ones the Jews were before us right but the blessing come to us through the cross of Jesus Christ amen and so we don't that we don't have a whole lot on Ephraim his personal life other than that and before Joseph died Ephraim family had reached the third generation that's really all we know about Ephraim not know we don't know a whole lot about him other than later that they fell away which we'll get to just a moment okay the last one so this is the fourteenth one right because there's 12 and then there's two added in the two taken away this is the fourteenth one Manasseh Manasseh God hath made me forget is what his name means oh and it says he married a Syrian which is interesting I'm not sure if that was good or bad I didn't read that scripture but it says the only thing afterwards recorded of him is that his grandchildren were brought up upon Joseph sneeze amen so at least we know his first descendants were brought up in the right place at the knees of Joseph and that would be a good place to be brought up okay so why we're Dan in the Ephraim deleted let's go to Deuteronomy 29 we'll review this this was in the church age book but also preached in the 7co 1963 Deuteronomy 29 16 so why were Dan and Ephraim deleted under heaven twenty nine sixteen to twenty twenty nine sixteen to twenty maokai can you read sixteen seventeen eighteen lady kiniry nineteen and twenty Deuteronomy 29 and could you read sixteen seventeen eighteen please okay twenty-nine yeah [Music] hey Liddy can you do 1920 please there it is so God would take out their names under heaven if they were mixed up in the idolatry of the false nations and just another point I'm gonna add something in here it just struck me do you know brother Branham said when Catholics or Lutheran's do you know Father Son Holy Ghost whatever they do or the RAM said their blessing themselves and that's what the Bible says right here a Kurt the curse of nations bless themselves in their heart right they say they continue to live in sin abominations right they'll evil things but then they still bless themselves because the Bible never said bless yourself in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost whatever they're doing I'm not sure what things are connecting I'm not sure but brother Ram said they do that he said he had friends that would program said they would drive by the Catholic Church and they would bless themselves so see we're not trying to bless ourselves we want to be blessed by God and we want to stay away from anything that's accursed but see people try to bless themselves and have the curses of sin but you can't have both you got to have one or the other amen thank you okay okay Lydia so that's the pronunciation here Lydia read that okay I'm right let's go to first Kings 1225 first Kings 1225 and let's this is where Dan commits the sin of idolatry and he gets blotted out from under heaven so he he gets kicked out of the the tribes for this sin right here bless you or bless you bless you again yes sir first Kings 1225 first Kings 1225 and church this is good remind remember Jesus can blot out names today my friend and my friends and I at the Bible Club were talking about that and he said what do you think about this I said well Jesus Christ Himself I said it's red letter words Jesus Christ said he's gonna blot out names out of that book and then remember Paul said he told the beloved he said my beloved Corinthians he said flee from idolatry run from it don't let anything become more important or more lovely in your heart than Jesus Christ amen because that's why their names are removed from for idolatry for idolizing something other than God okay first Kings 1225 then Jeroboam be built Sheetz him in the mount ephraim and dwelt there and went out thence and built Penuel and Jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of David if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house the lord of jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord even unto ray of bone king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to Raya bone king of Judah now let's stop right there in that interesting this King knew Jeroboam knew if they get to God's provide a place of worship their hearts are gonna turn to God amen doesn't say no the same thing today if you actually come to the house of God with the right attitude your hearts going to be turned to Christ so so Satan tries to do anything except except come to church don't come to church anything you can do to keep them out of church err or make them not enjoy Church err or do something to pervert the church experience Satan knows he can keep their hearts away from the Lord oh my that's striking verse 28 whereupon the King took counsel and made two calves of gold and said then it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem oh it's too hard to go to church here I'm making you your own church behold thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan so see Dan allowed this the tribe of Dan allowed this Idol to stay there this false worship place and because of that God removes their name so after that moment well this was the time okay this is a thousand years before Christ right Salman was a thousand years this is right after Solomon so nine hundred or so years dan gets his name removed and his tribe will not be here in the hundred forty-four thousand that's striking okay now let's go to Hosea 4:17 so we see Dan remove because they went to a false church right they went to church that was actually an idol instead of true worship when they should have went to God's provided place of worship Hosea 4:17 Daniel Hosea that's good good way to get a Daniel Hosea Joel Amos Hosea 4:17 now sixteen talks about Israel slide it back as the backsliding heifer now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone so God literally says have nothing to do with Ephraim Strieber they're so deep in idolatry now what's striking again church what's striking is that that man and that tribe itself the man will probably be there you know I'll probably be there or unless that's here but his tribe will be represented in the Millennium so God is gonna again forgive idolatry God can forgive idolatry God can forgive sexual sin God can forgive violence and murder God is the great forgiving God amen and that's what this lesson teaches us the love and mercy of Jesus Christ amen so now let me just explain this again so these are the families when they went down into Egypt okay those are the families represented here's the families coming out so Joseph and Levi are taking out Levi Levi is taken to be the priesthood and then Joseph's two sons are brought and that's what the yellow are Joseph's two sons yeah yeah because Ephraim was removed here okay and then Ephraim and Manasseh are back okay and then these two asterisks are the two that transgressed against God they had idolatry they're removed and so I put a reminder up there that's why they're not here in the 144,000 and you have Levi and Joseph back and inserted back in there to always have 12 and then those two are taken out here in the time of restoration and again we see the grace of God somehow God is able to block blot their names out under heaven but he still forgives them in heaven I can't explain that I just know the Bible says that but I can't explain that somehow God can still forgive them in heaven but under heaven there's a temporary judgment against them okay so that's something that is very striking and must we must remember that by the grace of God let me see if I've got anything else on that topic there okay I think that's it okay so I did all this to say these last few things despite their failures and sins Christ granted 12 of these eternal life and not only that but he gave them white robes crowns and Thrones so in the in that case think of the Crown's why do you get a crown because you're a ruler you overcame something so all 12 of these sons despite their shortcomings at some point they had to overcome it now church I hope that encourages it encourages you with and I whenever we're struggling with God is gonna help us overcome it whether he's got a humble us whether he's gonna set us down in the hospital till we make something right whatever he's got to do he's gonna help us overcome because we have to be overcomers we have to rule over sin on this side in order to rule on that side so these are ones that overcome and a throne course represents judgment so they these twelve have had to have the righteous judgment of God God had had to teach them this is how you judge this is how you rule this is how you're supposed to live the right kind of life and remember all these things are taught by God's grace God graciously has patience with us and we must have patience with one another how many know that God wants us to be a family and sometimes families go through how seasons they have times where it's hard to love each other there's certain situations it's hard to deal with imagine you know haven't known your brother Ruben slept with this woman you know your mother he slept with your mother you know can you imagine that or your two brothers were really cruel and murderers and all these things and can you imagine all of Joseph's brother and most of them wanted to see him killed let's go back there most of them wanted to see Joseph killed most of these except for maybe Reuben and Judah all the other ones went to see him killed and but because of God's grace and Joseph's forgiveness they must have repented of that at the end time oh my Oh think about how God church we ought to have confidence God will orchestrate every part of our lives in order to purify us and make us just like Christ amen if we are if we're the bride and if we are gonna rule some day Jesus will orchestrate every part of our life to drive out every part of our sin that we might rule on this side amen oh my that's beautiful merci so again all these failures are able to be redeemed by the blood of Christ and notice this this is the last thing I think I think I'll say before I finish and I preached about 40 minutes each of these 12 so the 12 sons and the 12 apostles they have the same reward did you notice that they have the same rewards they all get the crowns they all get robes right and they all have Thrones and this is because they overcame the trials of their own day as leaders in their day right they both overcame so Jesus gives them all those same rewards but the remember there's a special reward for Peter and the 12 apostles because they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they left everything to follow Jesus their position is a little more special with a few more promises but other than that as far as eternal life they're both given the same rewards because they overcame in their day an hour amen let's stay on our feet praise the Lord and I hope that's an encouragement because we just have to overcome for our day we've got to overcome what's what's what's the difficult part of our age you know we know it's nervous tension we know it's the pressures of riches and nervous tensions of life we've got to look and see my arse all these obstacles obstacles in our lives but we can overcome by the power of the Holy Spirit and we must overcome by the grace of God amen hope that was a blessing like I said that didn't have as much time as I wanted to study on that but I got a good start and perhaps we'll look about more about that on Wednesday night by the grace of the Lord we'll see what the Lord has in the store I hope that was encouragement for you and if you want a copy of that one let me know it was very helpful for me I could I searched the internet I couldn't find anything that showed it so I had to create my own I spent about two hours on this yesterday typing everything out and put it in the right order because no one else had it because it's a special revelation for the message of the hour God gave that to a prophet and I believe there's more things that God can teach us in there are just we just got to keep digging in the scripture but so so encouraging to know that despite their sins despite their failures God could redeem their life amen praise the Lord I sing that song Reidy Reidy redeemed by the blood of the lady and ridi ridi is child and forever I am for I am ridi ridi ridi by the late Reidy Reidy hate his child and forever first versity how I love to proclaim him redeemed by the blood of Reedy Prue is in the mercy is shout and forever I ridi ridi by the blood of the late
