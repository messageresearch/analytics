long in Chapter four I think I'm out of battery now cuz I was seen if I got every done can you get me two batteries Malkin oh I'm good okay but it says read can you after this after we pray can you get me two batteries sorry I think I'm running low today alright but uh I'm sure you know but brother have reached two and three hours on a couple sermons on Revelation chapter four so there's so much revelation in these long messages that we're just going through nice and slow and it's a little heaven to us by God's grace it's a little heaven amen revelation 4 verse 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God and before the throne there was a sea of glass like a new crystal and the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before him behind let's reverse seven together ready one two three and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle now I'll just read verse eight myself and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty what which was and is and is to come amen let's have a word of Prayer if ever need on your heart make it known unto God hear heavenly father were so happy to be in your house again Lord God hallelujah Lord this is the house the judgment house Lord this is where we're declared righteous by our advocate Jesus Christ and we're happy to be gathered here Lord God in your precious name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless us here now regret reread your word Lord just take it break it to your people thank you for sending your prophet Lord to interpret it for us as we rightly divided anointest so God to receive every word raise our faith O God to meet the challenge of this salary we know the standard of God will be raised against the enemy in our lives and so we give you glory and honor for that Oh God we worship You Father and we say thank you and we ask you to speak now in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen God Bester's B&C to praise the Lord I guess okay thank you sir or she didn't okay so we like to look at revelation 4 here again and this is part 7 of this chapter I got slides and everything like that I had plenty of time to study so I'm sure enjoying summer break and enjoying all the free time here by the grace of the Lord I guess while we're waiting just reminders again we have brother Ben Neriah coming this Sunday so we're looking forward to that let me go through the other preacher since we've got a minute here thank you sir thanks buddy for she did thank you in July will start having 4 p.m. services every Sunday to do outreach and so we're looking forward to that thank you buddy there you go thank you sir sorry about that so every Sunday in July we'll have outreach services will be ministering we'll just basically be introducing the message to anyone that will come if no one comes we'll just sing and pray and perhaps I'll preach out because I'm going to by people do live stream as well brother Adam had a good idea to bite people on Facebook I thought that'd be a good idea I got like 800 friends on Facebook I don't know if they're all my friends but but I do want to invite them and perhaps if just one or two or whatever if anybody hears the Word of God will be happy about that and we're so thankful for any opportunity I was reading today member and Colossians and and the the Apostle Paul st. Paul said pray for me that God will open doors so I can speak the Word of God with boldness how many want open doors I do I just want open door so I can share my faith in Christ Jesus and the message and so that's that should be we're always on the lips you know on the front of our lips here in our prayer God open doors open opportunities help me to share my faith with anyone who listened by God's Jim shoemaker beer July 29th Heath Randolph August 18th and 19th and then brother Diggs on September 30th okay all right how we do it okay thank you maokai okay so we're on chapter four part 7 okay so we read our text here basically that is I'm just probably get to one thought tonight the four beasts I'm gonna have a look at the four beasts a little bit tonight and all these revelations is just it's just like it's like a how did I say it's like a contract that brother Bram sermons are like concentrated when he's doing this teaching like that there's so much scripture there's so many revelations he just lays them out and he keeps asking the people can I go a little further and then they say yes and he's always the men shouting yeah but man was just like let the beans burn he said this is we're gonna feast on this word you know this is this is more important than your regular beans you keep saying beans so I don't know if you have beans planned for tonight but I don't think I'll keep you that long by God's grace but we do want a feasts on the Word of God we got plenty time here and let me set my timer so I don't wear myself out let's look at this here now the first thought brother branham brings out is he shows the difference between the four beasts and all the other beasts in the book of Revelation so this is the first thought he brings out Oh nature's back let's give nature of applause amen god bless you nature glory everybody missed you nature my daughters missed you so i'm sided even see her there but bless her heart good to see her eight and we're just at home you know it's just they were home we're home folks here you know but praise the Lord Amen just so happy to see the little little nature by God's grace so I just did a few pictures like I said so brother BAM he shows the difference between the four beasts and their before the throne and then the other beast that is in the book of Revelation so there's a great difference there brother Branham brings out their heat I'm sorry they're Greek definitions so he brings out the fact that the suit though the four beasts are actually soon in the Greek the word beast means oongh' and it's a different meaning just means a creature okay but when you read about the beast how the woman rides the beasts and all those who worship the Beast and take his image that beast is the same English word beast but it's a different Greek word and that's the word a theory on which has a striking definition it means wild untamed savage oh my god is so true Eve God is God's Word is so powerful it's just so powerful you know and I had one thought yeah well there's one thought give me just a moment here there's a there's a scripture I read I ran across when I was reading proverbs and I forgot to put on this sermon I'm sorry but in Proverbs you know the Bible says that men without wisdom are beasts so let me look up beasts just you know it kind of goes along with our proverbs series and I think I'll pull that up in just a few seconds I mean just bear with me yeah I'm sorry it's Ecclesiastes okay so why don't you go to Ecclesiastes 3:18 if you got your Bibles let's go there Malachi can you read that when you got that buddy please ask these 318 not proverbs Ecclesiastes 3:18 so this is a prayer of Solomon Solomon's praying Lord would you manifest to all these men and women that they're nothing but beasts remember this is before the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so the motor a lot of times Solomon would see people living below the holiness standard that we enjoy today right we should when we're around each other we should say my this brother this sister this sister this brother no they live such a godly life and we should be able to maintain it because the seal of God the anointing of God should never leave our souls if we're born again it'll leave our minds you know we got to go praying in our minds right and the Bible said stir up your minds my way remembers and transform your mind you know by the renewing of your mind through prayer but we should live such a godly holy life that we could should be able to honestly say we are Saints raise God like if you watched my live you should say mine this man has separated unto God because that's what Saint means Saint means you're separated from the world you're not a part of the world but you're a part of the kingdom of God amen well Salman didn't see that Simon was saying Lord you know show these men that they're beasts oh my and so brother man brings us out and the the beasts were kind of dealing with here is these wild untamed savages this is the sinful Beast and program says this he said Zune means a creature for living Zune creatures not the beasts of wild theory on but Zune living creatures and thier iana's wild untamed savages in other words if you watch the 11th chapter the Beast of Rome the 13th chapter United States the 17th chapter both the United States and Rome how many know that in Revelation 13 the United States is in Revelation 13 it is the Beast spirit in United States and that's where we're living right now the Beast is operating through the United States government can the church say Amen that is actually scriptural program says that's thus saith the Lord that the be started out in the beginning you know the beginning of Revelation 13 it started as Rome but then it came to a land right and those beasts came up out of the land instead of the waters the waters as many people ancient Rome but the land is America North America and the beasts came up out of the land which is North America and that's where we are today and so program says see it's the beasts of the denominational churches consolidated with Catholicism makes them an unconverted untamed to the gospel hey then glory so when the Antichrist spirit is anointing Roman Catholics or denominational or even message churches that don't have the Holy Ghost and they're they're living under Crees and they're not born again they are untamed to the gospel the gospel cannot tame them the gospel cannot control them but you and I should be controlled constantly by the gospel of Jesus Christ so we should be we should be controlled by the holy spirit power not the power of the enemy amen and so that's what we're seeing here there's two anointings either stairs two beasts here there's anointing of the soon creatures the four beasts but then there's the anointing of Satan the beast or the Antichrist spirit amen now bohtan says these four beasts are throne guards they're not angels and they're not elders so let's read it so you got it now they were not angels neither were they elders they were living creatures at the throne oh don't you love this living creatures they're not angels because this proves it right here and he reads the scripture I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the outer so that scripture points out three groups there's living creatures angels and then there's elders now there's three different categories here I hope you got this system down here now I want to show you there's three different categories of it three different species around the throne species there's three different species around the throne did you catch that so I just put it out here so you can see it there's three categories you have the throne and around the throne there's the four beasts there's 24 elders then there's angels like seraphim's and the regulars ark angels and there's other different kinds of angels as well so you have program says there's three categories around the throne does that sound like God that God would do God would be perfected in three that sounds like it to me Father Son Holy Ghost three works of grace justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost love faith and charity right you know that's just hope faith and charity rather goes together this is just like God God is always perfected in threes amen now he said let's leave that for a minute let's just hold it they're living creatures brother Benson what are they if they're not angels they're not redeemed men what are they would you like to know here's my interpretation he said I hope it's right I believe it is they are god's guards of his throne now we're going to erase this a little bit he said they're not angels doorman they're not wild beasts they're creatures living creatures alright somebody got it these creatures are living creatures they're throw their guards to God's throne now brother Brad embracing the thought of how the four beasts of Revelation are slightly different from the four beasts of Ezekiel however in the Book of Ezekiel as your head spin after you read Ezekiel mine usually does it's quite it's quite interesting there's such deep deep visions that Ezekiel goes through but they're they're the same they're the same beasts but changes happen to them after the New Testament how many know that the beasts of Ezekiel are different slightly than the beasts of Revelation because they've changed this positions amen the beast under the Old Testament were slightly different but when the blood of Jesus Christ was shed and Jesus Christ went to sit on the throne in heaven then there's some change that happened to the beasts amen and you'll see brother Branham bring it out here now when Ezekiel saw the glory of God he saw the same thing that John saw you remember last Sunday how we got the glory of God and got the picture where he had it taken with us that was the picture of brother branham's picture with the pillar fire you remember that the glory God the same thing as he Kia saw same thing John saw here it is today makes Jesus Christ the same in Ezekiel side same thing was here on earth the same God that's here with us today same yesterday today and forever he that was which is and shall come the entrance to the soul body spirit the brazen see the word the SEC sanctify our soul and the filler with the Holy Ghost the same thing see just the same all right now here's the difference so if this if you listen to the sermon you'll hear brother BAM say this here's the difference these same beasts were in Ezekiel before the blood of Jesus Christ and now we see the four beasts it which is actually after the rapture if you understand what I'm saying because John was raptured and caught up to heaven right and that's why the the glassy sea was crystal clear there was not firing it because it wasn't the tribulation time yet but the church had been pure a purge by the RAM says so whether man shows in Ezekiel the Bible said in Ezekiel that the four beasts didn't turn he said they couldn't go backwards he said they rolled on wheels and that's what the Bible says well brother have said now that John's been raptured he said they're stationary they don't roll on wheels anymore all right I mean we know what I'm talking about honey listen this lately is anybody listening to it lately okay look if you know if you haven't go back and listen to it you'll really enjoy it he said what's the symbol here brother branham what is it it means that these guards was God's ark they were in journey rolling on wheels when Ezekiel saw them but when John saw them they'd already come into their right position in heaven amen the Ark of God was on earth rolling on wheels as they took it from place to place a man had glory met it was in travel they took it all the way up through the wilderness and all the way into the temple and so forth so how many know in the day in the Old Testament that the ark was placed on the shoulders of the Levites and there was times the other instruments were placed on carts right and they were rolled and so during the Old Testament these four beasts were on wheels to symbolize that the Ark of God was constantly moving but brother they've said now that were after after the rapture he said now that Ark has received up because the church age is over and it's received up into glory see it's stationary now in heaven with all the angels and things around it amen only a prophet can pick that up church you and I reading that we would not have picked that up but the Old Testament beasts had wheels on them because the ark was moving on the earth but now that the church the blood of Jesus Christ has been shed the body of Jesus have been brought to heaven and the church has been raptured now those beasts are stationary they're not moving anymore they're in one place they're not going anywhere amen that's the throne of God that's the the presence of God and it's not going anywhere amen Church and you and I have access to it by prayer hey okay we had access to this throne the stationary beasts are there the angels the cherubims are saying though there and we can access the throne of God by prayer amen through the blood of Jesus what a privilege that we have amen now so hopefully that makes sense does that makes sense everybody so they were on wheels before because on earth the ark was constantly moving from place to place but now they're stationary because the throne of God has been established as that location in heaven amen all right now the next thought brother branham gives is that number four is the number of deliverance amen and just know that all numbers most numbers have good meanings too okay sometimes people say like I've heard people say well six is a bad number well not necessarily yeah it can it can mean a bad number right but it's a good number it was first a good number because I'm the sixth day God made a perfect man and who knows how many pieces of honey pieces of armor does the Christian have six look it up read it in Ephesians chapter six it's in Ephesians six see there are six pieces of armor so six is not always the bad number now it's bad when it's six six six that's when it's bad but six can be a good number God made everything on the sixth day he said that's good six was good and so for as good as well enough or can be bad we know that before can be a good number as well so let's look at this program says how four is a good number in this sermon and four is the number of the earth because remember the earth has four corners right the four corners the four winds of the earth did you know that huh me knows now before we have to go into it four is an earthly number sure like the four it's the number of Earth deliverance deliverance now keep that in your mind deliverance because I'm gonna strike it just a minute real hard I'm gonna strike it real hard see deliverance now there was three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace but the fourth one come it was deliverance praise the Lord Lazarus was in the grave three days but when the fourth one come he was deliver amen for is God's number of deliverance amen so it showed that these beings must have been something about the earth so there's four beings these four zoon creatures these four living creatures these four beasts and therefore represent deliverance on the earth amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen if you know that you know I'm excited if you know the message amen cuz look because member one defeat read Revelation 4/7 say and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf third like a face of man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle so so see my note there the flying eagle as as an anointing it's a power it's our delivering power today so that flying eagle represents the delivering power that we have today to be delivered amen we have the power God has given us power to be set free from all bondage amen we don't have to say that I'm going to be bound my whole life by this we don't have to say that now it may be God's will but you know test us there try us or chasing us or something like that but we don't have to always feel like that because the anointing today is to deliver us amen like brother man remember what is the stomach problem when he gives that testimony the wings of us so I dove every seven years it came back so every seven years he had deliverance but finally at the end of the life he got full deliverance amen hallelujah so we got to keep believing that we got to keep trusting at some point God is going to fully deliver me because that's the hour we're living it is the hour of deliverance amen so we must pray for the anointing to fly above sin which is our deliverance on this earth praise God and members not a stable or sitting eagle or a sleeping eagle it's a flying eagle right it's a flying eagle well look at that just a moment now brother have said every time a religious power now this is an Easter seal so he's going back five years or I'm sorry going forward five years to show what he preaches about this eagle anointing every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and when and when and then when the come the sacrifice our the ox went because he's the sacrificed beast of the Lord then come the reformers down through the church ages come the face of a man and the Reformers had been since Luther Wesley Oh Calvin and on down Pentecostal age so for each hour they had a power brother man said the lion power was the the Apostles they were so fierce the Bible said the righteous are bold as a lion so no no age will be as bold as that lion age as far as I understand I can be wrong but they look at Paul settings he says Oh death where is your sting he said I've ran the course I'm ready to be offered I'm ready to be a martyr how many people would say that today that probably not many people but that's the anointing that he had there Steven he's being stoned and he's not even afraid he's just got like a face like a angel he's got a face of a messenger he's saying stole me if you want God will put me to sleep he's bold as a lion right and then of course we know the Roman Catholic Church slaughtered millions and millions of Christians but they willingly went to the stake because they were anointed as an ox as a calf the Bible said they were like a young calf not really aware what's going on and just kind of go with the float and given themselves as sacrifice to Jesus Christ oh my and then the Reformers Martin Luther John Wester we just got through the church ages their anointing was wisdom to know their wisdom man to know that these false doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church are nothing but tommyrot and God gave them the wisdom to point out in the scripture that the just shall live by faith that believers must live a sanctified life they meant God gave him wisdom to point out in the word amen and now we're innocent but in the last in the last message he went forth there come a flying eagle programs and it's eagle time I mean no it's Eagle time got any Eagles out there tonight it's eagle time which is reveal time the Word of God made manifest that means manifest means appeared so eagle time is when the word appears to you it's revealed and now appears to us glory and he says the Word of God proved old children walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart God will fill you amen so see this is why I made my note your revelation from the Father is invincible that's the invincible army brother I was talking about in the church age book that you have to have the anointing of the flying eagle then you're invincible you fly way above the Beast the Beast is way down here the woman's riding the Beast but if you're an eagle you can catch a thermal and you can just fly and just with ease go up way up high and that beast can't touch you because you're flying on the wind and the Holy Spirit amen it's exactly right and what causes what does that witness the revelation of the Holy Spirit where God is he reveals his word to us and it lifts us up way from the earth and the Bible said the gates are the counsels of Hell cannot prevail against revelation Amen huh glory the there's no that that demon power the pale horse rider today cannot prevail against the flying eagle anointing because he can't even no he can't even throw is he can't even throw his death that high whatever he's got here whatever weapon he's got he can't throw it that high because the Eagle is so high up in heavenly places amen that's exactly right look at this this is what an Solomon I'm sorry King Eggar caught this revelation did you know that he caught this revelation he caught he caught a little glimpse of a flying eagle and remember there are sixty kinds of eagles on the earth so I don't think the bald eagles actually in Jerusalem I don't know for sure but I don't think it's in I don't think that's the one in Jerusalem but King agar somewhere saw one of the sixty kinds of eagles and maybe there was more even during that day but he says there be three things which are too wonderful for me yeah for which I I don't know the way of an eagle in the air is the first one he lists I like that so see and of course you see the other ones are serpent on a rock the ship in the midst of the sea and then the way with the mate alright I was looking I was looking for the four beasts because I saw a man and then I saw an ego I was looking for the ox and the line but I didn't see you don't understand brother William you see that oh man did I miss something there but no yeah you always looking for revelation from the Holy Spirit you know but look he you know King Eggar was anointed by the Holy Spirit in mind when I watching the Eagle fly it is way too wonderful I don't even understand how he flies well science has studied them a little bit and I was reading today on a on a an organization website learner org has had two scientists found that Eagles only spend about two minutes out of each hour flapping their wings because flapping takes all the energy you ever feel like you hardly have any spiritual energy you know Eagles they're just supposed to flat for about two minutes and then for like 58 minutes they just get their relax now church humming I mean I mean I've gone through a week and you feel like all you're doing is flapping I'm just trying to make it through the week brother yes huh I could get the church and I'm so tired I have weeks like that - I feel like all I'm doing is flapping alright with me we feel like that but the real eagle anointing when we get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost we're not supposed to feel like all we're doing is flapping we're supposed to feel like we're resting upon the Word of God amen we're supposed to do it just a little bit of work amen and that's how we know and we're under the anointing the church the Christian life doesn't feel like work it feels like rest hallelujah amen so these scientists studied for all these months and they found out that egos really only flat for two minutes out of 60 what's that 99 98 percent what is that in 95 percent most of their life most of their time in the air and what's our anointing is not the Eagle in the nest anointing we've been pushed out of the nest we've got the flying eagle anointing amen that's what we've got and he says the energy needed to maintain a bird in flat soaring or gliding as much as perhaps a twentieth or less the power needed for flapping therefore Eagles will always choose to soar or glide when possible I think that's what you would choose too wouldn't you would you choose a week where I was doing I'm just trying to be a believer I'm just this devils wearing me out or would you rather have a week where I'm just sailing the heavenlies oil as well oh praise the Lord God is so good I'm just riding the power of the Holy Spirit oh man that's the coronoid thing and we need more of that amen because wind tides Holy Ghost right jesus said the Holy Ghost is like a win you don't know when it's coming when it's good but Eagles find the wind hallelujah that's called a thermal as why I mentioned earlier a thermal is when there's a huge gust of wind and that thermal lifts the Eagle up amen now this goes on to say that is why when Eagles are flying long distances especially on migration they often saw on thermals until they reach a great altitude and then use the gliding and soaring method of flying to cover the longest distance when the Swift the smallest amount of energy so church I hope I can do this the right way an eagle has to do a little work at the beginning can I say like this you got do a little bit of prayer right you do a little bit of prayer you're working up and praying you praise the Lord but pretty soon if you're working and praying pretty soon you should hit the anointing you should hit the sweetness of the Holy Spirit how many like they hit the sweetness of the Holy Spirit well now the Spirit has taken over and now I'm just resting now I'm enjoying the sweetness of God amen and then that spirit will take us higher right and higher where we can love people at church we can love people in our hope we're expressing the love of Christ on the job and the Christian life just seems like such a rest from Anderson why are people so tossed about today he says because they come out of the holiest of holies in other words they leave the presence they leave the wind they leave the power of God but see we've got a flap so the hard part is just getting started right and we got to flap the old test we got to quote the Old Testament we got to quote the New Testament and we got to keep quoting them and quoting them right and working with that inquiry than the just shall live by faith the judge shall live by faith there's power in the brother by His stripes I'm healed we got to keep flapping and flapping until God anoints us and then we've got to ride the anointing are you with me that's the anointing for this hour is the flying eagle anointing remember it's not our power we do a little bit of power but then the Holy Spirit lifts us up into heavenly places hey man don't you love that I don't know we're just such a easy it's an easy illustration to show how we get under this anointing and how this anointing is so powerful this anointing should take us a long distance right this anointing should take us far away from our troubles Oh glory yeah it should take a so far away because the Spirit is leading us and guiding us away from the trouble oh right away from the drama or the fear or the temptation it leads us way far away from that and we find a better position we find the position God wants us to be in oh that's beautiful praise the Lord now there's other various ego scriptures I had prepared but I wanted you to see that again the flying ego noin thing look how easy look how simple it is for the ego to get under that anointing he's just got to do a little bit of work and then the spear will lift him up amen how many want God to lift you up tonight I'm sailor lift me higher take me higher help me just to press my wings out there and catch your anointing praise the Lord no glory and you all could understand it right like with water baptism all the chickens are down there saying Father Son Holy Ghost well you just had to take the Old Testament and the New Testament and just believe that be baptized and God lift you way up above that right well you you whatever temptation whatever chicken denominational attitudes are down you're on the ground we just got to catch both the Old Testament New Testament and let God take us up and rest in the thus saith the Lord out of the Bible amen and that will lift us up in the heavenly places haha yes I believe it now let's look at a few scriptures here when God I'll just say like this when God is stirring you up he's leading you when God is pudding when God is putting a passion in your heart I just got to do something I really feel like I let me do this I just got to move and I got to get out of this place I've got to do something different for the Lord when God is stirring you up God's leading you you look at the Bible 732 God found him Israel in a desert wind and the waste howling wilderness he led him about and instructed him and kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest flutter a--the over her young spreadeth abroad her wings to see she's got to stir up her nest she's got a flap her wings on the Eagles right kind of shake him up get some wind blowing on him get some anointing in their face amen if the Holy Ghost moving in their lives spread about her rings Wow look how God's Word is Old Testament New Testament look at those great big wings of the word of God taketh them and bear them on her wings I've never seen that in the video but the Bible said that the mother Eagle Bears the little ones on her wings so God gives us a little ride we just ride his power amen this must be at the beginning I cuz I've never seen it there's other things about Eagles I've heard but I haven't seen any but that's okay because though if the Word of God says it then it has to happen I know somewhere there Samet eagle these 60 kind of eagles that one of the babies are little ones they ride the wings of mother right and look at the Bible said so the Lord alone did lead them so all this interaction right here is leadership of the Holy Spirit and there was no strange God with him so see Church God leads us by stirring us up and carrying us on his power oh you know God I just feel like God is gonna do something in my life pretty soon things are stirring up there's a little bit of trouble or there's a little bit of shaking going on it's God leading you if you'll say if you'll hang to the word you'll stay in the perfect will of God but see sometimes when troubles happen people choose the easy way out and that might not be the Word of God they might just jump out of the nest instead of jumping on mom's wings amen I said we got new his jump on mom's wings jump on the Word of God amen and that's God leading us oh why is life so hard why is my life all stirred up why is things blowin wire why is all this a movement happened it's God leading his Eagles it's God leading you by the Holy Spirit that's right now here's another one I just want to put in here briefly Fresno Fresno Lightning cometh out of the east and shines even under the west so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered now if you know the context of these scriptures this is talking about the 144,000 if you know the context look at the next verse immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened doesn't that remind anybody of the sixth seal and the church said I can prove it if you want to go to your Bible I'll go to you say yeah we'll say your original revelation 6 the Sun gets darkened now under the sixth seal so this is Jesus talking actually about the Eagles of the 144,000 but why the Eagles because they get the seal of the Holy Ghost why are you an eagle because you get burned again amen hallelujah that's what makes us Eagles as got the baptism with all the girls like brother and said eagle time reveal time story so I'm gonna read it revelation six you have to turn there but I'm gonna just read to you so you know you got it it's revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree kathas her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places all right so can anybody see that in verse 29 a meeting after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened that's what we just read in verse 12 the Sun is darkened the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth see all the tribes of the earth that's not the rapture that's that's Armageddon and then all shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and the Church said that's that's that's the Battle of Armageddon when they see him coming back just as he came that's Armageddon but the point I want to make is that Eagles will always be around the fresh word of God and that's the Word of God that you and I have received do you love the Word of God still you still enjoy water baptism in Jesus Christ's name you still enjoy all the seven seals praise the Lord of course now some people preach them wrong and and it's not anointed but when you teach any word of god that's anointed it's life to the people amen holly like I said when brother him preaches seven seals he said these were the greatest services he ever preached because the the Holy Ghost came every day and revealed the Word of God to him in a vision he said this is greater than any healing so we know revelation of the word of God is the greatest thing we can have happen that we know thus saith the Lord so whether you're teaching or pre you're casting out Devils whatever you're doing it's the same Holy Ghost doing it all and the Holy Ghost gives life amen hallelujah that's what I tell the devil you know it's the devil whispers in my hair well you're just a teacher and and the people can't be anointed for faith and I say nonsense brother Branham had so much faith leukemia was healed when he was teaching the seven scales and it don't matter it's this the Holy Spirit it's the faith of the people it's what God is leading you to believe you and I can't speak squirrels unless God tells us to do it nor can brother Adam Branson God let me do that so we must find the leadership of today what is God leading us to do if maybe just leading us to keep up the fight and keep Oranje maybe he's leading us to get off the ground and so in the heavenlies amen stop beating your wings and using all of our human energy right and just get up and fly get an anointing and catch the anointing of the Holy Spirit to fly far away from this temptation to fly far away from this sin that's what he wants us to do is be flying Eagles amen that's right church but see the eagle is always around the fresh Word of God now I don't know I saw an article today about Eagles from popular science so I don't know but they that they said they were saying how American Eagles American Eagle American message believers they were just saying American Eagles though are getting trained because of how the world has changed they're getting trained to basically watch to another animal gets food and then bully that animal away and then take their food so this article this scientific article it said that American Eagles are kind of little they're kind of bullies they're not really working real hard I don't want to be like that I don't want to take somebody else's victory I want my victory praise God I want to be a soldier I want to be an overcomer a my don't want to be a lazy Christian I'm gonna be someone that's on the battlefront praise God like the Bible said let every man prove his ministry amen and the church said you need to have a ministry you have a ministry I have a ministry and we need to prove that the devil that this is our ministry and we're going to be victorious in our ministry amen that the let no man take your crown you got a crown to win you got something to do you've got a minister you've got to fulfill so go win it brother and sister amen don't let anybody take your reward don't anybody take your crown find what God's called you that's what we looked at on Sunday the perfect win of God a man after God's own heart that's what a real Christian is that's what a real Holy Ghost filled flying eagle is somebody that is after the heart of God and when they get the heart of God they get the will of God and then they know what God wants them to do and they do with all their heart they don't let anything be distracting they stay in the perfect will of God and they get a reward ha ha amen now didn't get this next one I think it did study some of us get past that one a little bit all right let me close up here let me finish up I got 20 minutes glory amen that's good they're full of eyes revelation 4:6 brother Ram brings this thought out they're full of eyes now I'll be honest I never once thought I could preach seven sermons on just chapter four there's so much revelation in here revelation 4:6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass remember the sea of glass represent what the washing of the water of the word that's what the sea of glass represents the washing of water by the word the bride John was washed they were washed it was like unto crystal there wasn't firing it wasn't the tribulation it was pure it was a complete blood washed Church amen and the midst of thrown around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind so they have eyes before them eyes behind them and this is a pretty simple revelation brother mem don't spend a whole lot of time on it but he says the throne right up next to God living creatures next thing to God standing there their intelligence of eyes represent intelligence Branham says they know what was which is and what shall come they had eyes without showing what they could see what was to come they had eyes within knows everything now and eyes in the back which no what was sober man says which was which is which shall come reflecting through the church ages that he was he that was which is and shall come it's reflecting that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hey though she loved the simplicity of God's Word see the that those beasts represent the anointings so it represents how the Holy Spirit knows which was which is and which is to come God sees everything God saw you before you were born he sees you now that you are the age you up and he sees you in the future and I'll tell you the future we're going to be in eternity with Christ Jesus that for my future is I hope that's where yours is is to be with Christ for all eternity amen that's one thing I know about my future I'm not sure if God will keep me in Akron forever I don't know where God will take me I don't know what job will give me but one thing I know about my future it's with Jesus Christ hey man that's what is to come for me well Jessie what's your life gonna be like in 10 years I know but I know an eternity I'll be with Christ amen which is to come that is to come because the Bible said when I die I'll receive a body and I my body will be just like unto his glorious body hey man how do I know you that's exactly right now now this is interesting now I don't have all the answers to this because memmer bromance of the living creatures were not angels but now by Bram calls him living creatures cherubims I thought a cherub was a angel so I don't know I'm just saying you know what bro Graham said okay I don't have this one figured out but I'm saying you know he takes a lot of time and goes into this he said that's exactly what John saw in heaven these four cherubim so now the living creatures or beasts these zoon creatures are now called cherubims on the fore side the arc of the throne in heaven they were the guards of the ark cherubims guards at the mercy seat don't you love the word now there's actually a lot of scripture to prove this if you go if you got you don't have to turn ever I got up here at zekiel 10 proves this this is beautiful I never saw this till today and everyone had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub now this I don't know why this is not a calf but anyways you'll see you'll see the four okay ii was the face of a man the third the face of lion and the fourth of the eagle so see the only one that's missing is a calf i don't know if a cherub looks like a calf or not i don't know i would imagine it did that's the fourth one unless there was some change right like after the blood of christ maybe there was some change i don't know because we saw a change with the wheels and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river of Chebar to memory talks about their faces this is this is a chair boom now and then he says in verse 20 this is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar and I knew that they were the cherubims how many how many how many happy when the Word of God proves itself the Bible tells us the creatures were cherubims and prevent tells us their cherubims I'd like to be right with the word don't you Amen so he takes a little bit of time on that spends over time here and he goes through and reads these so we got on by the scripture but I finish it up there so just so you know again let me go back there just so you know the living creatures are cherubims that's what bro Ram said and that's what the Bible tells us here in Ezekiel 10 now brother Branham shows us where the cherubims are first mentioned the Bible is in Genesis chapter 3 verse 24 so these cherubims these four beasts were actually cherubims program shows us their throne guards they guard the throne because there's three groups by the throne and then he said their first mention in Genesis he said let's go back just a minute to be sure that we got these fellows right the first time that these guards was mentioned is in Genesis now remember everything that we preach has got to come from Genesis through revelation that hallelujah I love that any time that you want to be questioning come ask me see it must be the whole Bible not just part of it because God don't change what he was in Genesis he is today he was in the middle age he's always the same see now in Genesis when these cherubims that's how I come to find them had to go back to 5 doubt what they was at the beginning all right so here's the scripture you know it and so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life now the word keep in Hebrew means to guard so it's perfect program calls him throne guards it's perfect their throne keepers beautiful I love how the Word of God is so pure and so Chairman's are called throne guards my brother branham he said in these chairs first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways there's the Garden of Eden and this is the gate right here opens up swings out and at this gate there was the cherubims cherubims and remember doesn't say are cherubim it said cherubims cherubs was placed there to guard what the Tree of Life that's what they was to guard the way of the Tree of Life the way and who is the way Jesus where is it reflected from here is the holy place here are the cherubim so the throne of God where's the way reflected at at the throne of God now here I just put this picture so you can see it here so here's the cherubims now I don't know if this pictures right it was the most modest picture I could find so that's why I use this one all the other ones you know they got them half-naked and the Bible said they wore coats of skin and if you look up coats it actually means a cloak it means a whole entire cloak like a whole tyre piece of clothes not just you know I'm half naked like the worldly people you know that's how they think so behind the chair behind the throne guards you had the holiest of Holies so these are on the east side and you'd have to go you're going west but the first thing you meet going west in the Holies of Holies will be the throne guards they're placed at the eastern gate right north east south west here so they're at the east and then you go further west and you go into the holiest of Holies here buddy say Amen Brinson so this is the same thing we have in the days of Moses so you the there's protection here on the east side before you come into the Holies of Holies here's the holiest of holies and it's the same idea in the Garden of Eden they're the the presence of God here they had cherubims here at the east to protect as you went in okay and brother Branham says the protection of Israel look like this I love this picture this is one of the most beautiful pictures I think I've ever seen in my life outside of you know this and the pillar of fire everything like that don't you love this this is how here's the Friends of God here's the hallways of always and here's East and West North is this way Dan he had the flying eagle anointing over here he had the Eagle standard but Miriam said Israel over here was protected this was the guard to the mercy seat God always has protection to the mercy seat that's what the brother man taught there so you had to go west if you're going west here you have to go through the guard here to get to the holiest of Holies and this is what Balaam saw when he looked down he said I see he said I see Israel as a unicorn in her power he said he said how can I curse whom God is blessed and we looked down he saw the cross of Jesus Christ hey men who can curse the cross of Christ nobody can't because it was the cross that took our curses amen he took the curses upon him that take our curses that we might be blessed amen that's exactly right so brother Aaron says so the Ark of the Covenant the Friends of God always had a guard around it I love that hmm hallelujah I just thought this makes you want to shout glory glory amen glory God always protecting is no matter where you come there's always protection look there's four groups right four camps there's four beasts right always protecting the throne of God amen throne guards hallelujah now Berta said why brother I said now watch put all this down here's the holiest of Holies Holies voice this is the holy place here's the sea and here is the light candles he said the seven that's reflect the light from here in here now brother I was going to the earthly through I'm sorry the heavenly throne which is this picture but I'll come back to it sober man's coming to this pick sure how you got to come last here from the they have protection on the east now remember they're stable now they're not moving anymore they're not rolling around they're stable and so to get to God's presence you had to go west but God has protection throne guards in the east there Barry see that all right now that was the best picture I could find there for the the four beasts let's finish this quote nah didn't finish this quote he said here he said here here here where where it were I'm sorry why are they reflect they are guarding and reflecting with the fire of God the way to the Tree of Life amen see it can't come from over here Presbyterian seminary Pentecost Caesarea it's got to come from here reflecting the light alright so see the light has to be reflected from the throne of God not from a seminary but from the throne of God amen glory and so the protection again is on the east going west the protection is on the east now it's stationary now okay so now you notice these cherubs that John saw here must have been interested in keeping the way of the Tree of Life so they must be interested in human beings amen I'm glad the holy ghost is interested in me Church aren't you glad aren't you glad the holy ghost came to you brother brother Bruce aren't you glad the Holy Ghost came aren't you glad he was interested in you and he brought the anointing with him he is the anointing so you can find the way to the Tree of Life hey he's interested in us before is the earthly number God's anointing and for different time periods kind of anointings come down interested in delivering us from the kingdom of darkness and placing us into the kingdom of light hallelujah oh I'm so glad to be a part of the kingdom of light Corey he's interested in me little old me when the world's not interested in me but God's interested in me thank you Jesus is all I can say that's all I can say the world thinks I'm nothing the world laughs at me makes fun of me rejects me all these things like that that's fine but God's interested in me amen he loves me he died for me hallelujah he said or Regenesis getting back to the Genesis again they kept the Tree of Life guarded the way of life the way of life how is the way Jesus said I am that way I am that bread that come from God out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever now there is a way back to that tree of life you get it is ever to get it here tonight there's a way back to the tree of life the baptism of the Holy Ghost now this I want to show now and make this shirt it's an altar so the presence of God is an altar now this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I'll tell you I do you remember both Cain and Abel come up here to worship so that shows God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you are again see back to Eden through the altar and they were to keep that way their guard it and they couldn't get back there until the altar was covered with blood oh my he said Oh God can't people see it see nothing but the blood a man had nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this altar if the blood is lifted there will stand on that date Judgment Day the fire of God's wrath to guard that tree again only one thing will enter into this gate to eat again will be through the blood of Jesus Christ do you see it glory now notice let's say our feet I'll stop right here he said now notice yeah here's Cain here's Abel all right now both boys come up to this gate to worship is that right so it must have been God's altar is that right and before this altar they built stationery another altar but he said here's the true altar of God is in the heart of man this is the altar he wants to live in now we went through this a few weeks ago that altar in heaven stationary that's the true altar but God wants a true tabernacle he can live in today and that's the heart of man glory then there's another altar down here which was representing the holiest of Holies in the holy place to see all these other altars were just representing the real altar of God remember man tells the true altar now is in the heart of man that's the altar for the New Testament is in the heart of man let's go one more thought here I got one more thought here let me bring it I just I will preach on these later by just I love all these pictures I just I don't lie to you but I'm a visual learner when I see this I just get excited you see the cross again you know with the tabernacle the holiest of all ways I just love that that's not let's end with this stuff this last thought program said that that these cherubims are tireless and all they do is they cry holy holy holy unto the Lord Ram said they were tireless they never grew tired they couldn't be anything connected with man he grows tired anybody tired today been flapping your wings awfully hard battled the devil yeah you have days like that you have days where the wind doesn't seem to blow like it like it does some days yeah I get tired to church he said they couldn't anything connected with man he grows tired but they were tireless and they sang holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy all day and all night through every age holy by he managed that since brother BAM died what 50 some years ago they're still crying holy every night all day holy holy holy since Saint Paul was here 2,000 years ago they still been crying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty God the loves to hear how he's holy you know Church I know about you but when I pray and I started talking about how whole praising God for His Holiness I started to feel really release I started feeling really sincere I start feeling the sweetness of the Holy Spirit as anyone ever felt that before because you recognize how unholy your flesh is and it places God in the right position it humbles you to realize well I thought bad thoughts I said bad things I did some evil things I should have done this you start it starts humbling you placing you in your spot and it actually starts helping you to worship God and reminding you how holy he is that's exactly right that's how I've noticed that my prayer life over the last you know 18 years or 16 years or so when I start praising God for his holiness and say I'm nothing I'm dirty forgive me you know wash me all these things it just brings me the presence of God because God loves to hear holy holy holy is his name he said let's go let's go back I got a scripture Isaiah 6 watch he said Isaiah saw the same thing exactly you memorize this and the year that King Uzziah died I also the Lord I also saw the Lord sitting on a throne high lifted up and his train for the temple above it said the seraphim's now remember seraphim's were the burners they're the ones that took the coals off the altar now it's what's amazing to me is that Isaiah seeing a vision here and in the vision he gets a supernatural touch of the Holy Ghost he gets a coal on his is that it's theophany what is that what what is that because it wasn't a natural call it was a spiritual call or some some type of eternal call are you with me how does that happen all's I know is Lord let that coal touch me amen I believe it already has but I'm saying if I need a fresh touch then Lord send another coal from the altar amen and let me feel the presence of the Holy Ghost amen but now seraphim's each was six weeks so now you have cherubims of six wings and now you got seraphim's have six wings and with twain he covered his face and twain he covered his feet we remember that from influence and with 20/20 did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory so now we both have cherubims crying holy holy holy and we have seraphim's crying holy holy holy so God has even more angelic angels just praising him for his holiness how much should we praise him for his holiness so see seraphim's and chairman's both cry holy because the Bible said these four beasts and my man said their cherubims corn Ezekiel 10 both chairs cherubims and seraphim's crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty amen let's close with that about the grace of God how many want to say how many one a fresh anointing to fly above the temptation in the world Amen my hands are up too let's pray for that let's just all reach up to God Oh God and father and haven't we come you now in prayer Lord we know prayer changes things we know prayer is the greatest weapon God ever gave to man father I pray in Jesus Christ's name Lord our hands are raised our wings are lifted Oh God we've been flapping all day or perhaps flapping all week and we need your anointing amen
