[34:57] it was gonna be a way around it if one
[35:00] technology fails there's got to be
[35:01] another one thing to make it work
[35:04] revelation 13 and church God knows I've
[35:07] always wondered about the first few
[35:09] verses of Revelation 13 by feel like the
[35:11] Lord of this recently opened up to me as
[35:13] I've studied the message of brother
[35:15] branham more and more and I feel like I
[35:18] know who these beasts are praise God and
[35:20] we're going to look at that here tonight
[35:22] by God's grace revelation 13 1 & 2 is a
[35:26] particular beast and then something
[35:28] changes in verse 3 and we'll be bringing
[35:31] that out here
[35:32] by God's grace in just a moment recently
[35:36] we preached on you know the showdowns
[35:38] that we know Revelation 13 16 is where
[35:42] the prophets said they're brought to be
[35:43] forced to stop preaching but we want to
[35:45] look at the previous verses in that
[35:48] chapter and it's a real blessing I trust
[35:51] you'll be able to understand these
[35:52] symbols how to understand the symbols of
[35:54] God amen Ram says we can understand all
[35:57] the symbols and everything a revelation
[35:58] you've got power over Satan amen because
[36:02] you can recognize Satan and in the world
[36:04] and our lives and overcoming by the
[36:06] power of the Holy Spirit amen revelation
[36:10] 13 verse 14 there say men let's read
[36:13] verses 1 2 & 3 oh sweet him together 1 2
[36:17] 3 and I stood upon the sand of the sea
[36:20] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[36:24] having seven heads and ten horns and
[36:27] upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his
[36:31] heads the names of blasphemy and the
[36:34] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[36:36] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[36:39] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[36:41] lion and the dragon gave him his power
[36:44] and his seat and great Authority and I
[36:48] saw one of his heads as it were wounded
[36:50] to death and his deadly wound was healed
[36:53] and all the world wondered after the
[36:57] Beast what attacks they met I'm never
[36:59] eat I before but don't look at it here
[37:01] tonight let's have one more word of
[37:02] Prayer Heavenly Father we bow our heads
[37:04] to you lord do what only you can do
[37:06] break the word to us bring Revelation
[37:09] Lord God and Lord we know if you do Lord
[37:12] the gates of hell would not prevail
[37:13] against your revelation dear God the
[37:15] counsels of hell to to seek out our
[37:18] lives as to steal from us kill and
[37:20] destroy they will not overcome us but we
[37:22] will have life and life more abundantly
[37:24] in the Holy Ghost thank you for this
[37:26] morning's message in worship thank you
[37:28] for tonight the wonderful song special
[37:30] in the testimony Lord were just more in
[37:32] love with you father speak to us here
[37:34] tonight it Jesus Christ's name the
[37:36] church said amen god I should be in
[37:38] senior so we got it all right now when
[37:42] you when you when you go from platform
[37:45] a platform like we went from the Apple
[37:47] platform to Microsoft sometimes it
[37:49] doesn't turn out right but hopefully it
[37:51] turns out right by God's grace ok
[37:53] brother bank next one here let's look at
[37:54] symbols the book of Revelation this is
[37:57] part 2 like I said we want to look at
[38:00] revelation 13 next one brother so I want
[38:04] to look at the revealed symbols of
[38:06] Revelation 13 how many would say this is
[38:09] new to them they not really studied
[38:10] revelation 13 anybody say they're kind
[38:12] of new to that okay just few of us okay
[38:14] praise the Lord if you have anything
[38:16] could be real blessed by gods grace I
[38:18] think you like I said I didn't even
[38:19] understand this first his first few
[38:21] beasts here I didn't even know that was
[38:23] so a few weeks ago and now the Lord has
[38:26] shown us you know through the message of
[38:27] the prophet and uh trust it'll be a
[38:31] blessing to here tonight to understand
[38:33] this how do you know how many of
[38:35] America's in the book of Revelation 13 I
[38:37] know that amen revelations in there so
[38:40] we want to we definitely want to know
[38:42] where we stand in Scripture Trey Scott
[38:44] so next one brother bang let's go this
[38:47] one I just want to start by saying this
[38:49] revelation 13 1 & 2 is Imperial peg and
[38:55] roll okay so this is before Constantine
[38:57] no Constantine was around 300 AD but
[39:01] before that you know Road ruled the
[39:02] earth right and so revelation 13 1 & 2
[39:06] is imperil pagan Rome you know such as
[39:08] under Julius II but Caesar before that
[39:10] you know hair it even in the days of
[39:12] Jesus and so forth all the time Rome was
[39:16] ruling up until rock on steam use
[39:18] because Constantine mary church and
[39:20] state how many know that in the third
[39:22] church age he married church and state
[39:23] so revelation 13 1 and 2 is imperial
[39:29] pagan Rome so let's let's look at that
[39:31] the next side brother depend here's the
[39:32] scripture and I stood upon the sand of
[39:34] the sea and I saw a beast rise up by the
[39:36] earth or out of the sea having seven
[39:38] heads ten horns and upon his horns ten
[39:40] crowns and upon his heads the name of
[39:43] blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was
[39:46] like a leopard ok so it's one beast but
[39:48] he's like a leopard his feet are the
[39:50] feet of a bear and his mouth as a mouth
[39:53] of a lion and the dragon gave him his
[39:55] power he's seen the thorn I don't know
[39:57] who the dragon is Satan's the
[39:59] okay so I don't have it on here but
[40:01] revelation 12 if you read revelation 12
[40:03] Satan is the dragon that tries to devour
[40:05] the woman and the child right and then
[40:08] also the remnant of the woman's seed
[40:09] which is 144,000 program tells us so
[40:12] Satan tries to devour them but God
[40:15] raises up a standard amen he annoys does
[40:18] to protect his people praise God next
[40:20] one brother it's a little picture here
[40:21] so this will just look at this just for
[40:23] a moment here's a beast coming up out of
[40:25] the sea it's got the seven heads it's
[40:27] got ten horns I think this one has some
[40:29] extra horns there you'll see it's like a
[40:32] leper but it's got feet like a bear it's
[40:34] got heads like a lion sorry this is just
[40:37] one authors you know Photoshop version
[40:40] of it you know the best they could do
[40:41] without drawing it just kind of computer
[40:43] animation and so for like that and of
[40:46] course behind it or where this beast
[40:48] gets his powers role that's the Vatican
[40:50] right and then behind that has Satan you
[40:52] know the dragon he's in charge of Rome
[40:54] and so forth like that so in Revelation
[40:57] 13 1 and 2 here we have Imperial pagan
[41:01] Rome stepping out stepping out of the
[41:04] sea now we're going to go through each
[41:06] of these symbols here by the grace of
[41:09] God and brother branham's quotes will
[41:12] tie this all together so we can
[41:13] understand it by the grace of God so
[41:16] next I brother van so let's focus on the
[41:18] Beast let's focus on the Beast part of
[41:19] this the first symbol will be the Beast
[41:21] part of it alright let's look at this
[41:23] here praise God next one so in the
[41:26] scripture a beast is in kingdom it's a
[41:27] human Kingdom power who family says the
[41:30] Beast is a power I've never heard him
[41:31] say that well the power is actually a
[41:33] kingdom human government power right
[41:35] that's what it actually is neck
[41:37] scripture and this proves are right here
[41:38] scripture proves it so no matter what
[41:40] people say we hobo the Rams just you
[41:42] know they say be program saying things
[41:44] he's not he's actually interpreting the
[41:45] Word of God to us so Daniel 7 23 next
[41:48] one brother thus he said the fourth be
[41:52] shall be the fourth Kingdom don't you
[41:54] love that a beast is a kingdom praise
[41:56] God upon earth which shall be diverse
[41:59] from all kingdoms and shall devour the
[42:02] whole earth and tread it down and break
[42:04] in pieces praise God now the fourth
[42:08] beast has to be rolled okay the force be
[42:12] fourth beast has to be roll so that's
[42:15] what we're looking at here we're seeing
[42:17] a Roman power rise up out of the sea
[42:20] okay and it has to be the the kingdom of
[42:23] role but it's got other attributes in it
[42:25] that we may have heard before so brother
[42:28] man just pause them right here don't
[42:30] worry about this I want you to turn your
[42:31] Bibles to Daniel 7 let's go to your
[42:33] Bibles to Daniel 7 I've got to lay this
[42:36] in here this is where now you know more
[42:39] Horrors time goes on we're understanding
[42:41] more about the Book of Daniel which is a
[42:42] mysterious book but through the prophet
[42:45] of God through another prophet prophets
[42:46] always interpret other prophets words
[42:47] we're starting I'm sorry to understand a
[42:50] whole lot better praise God so Daniel 7
[42:54] verse 1 I want you to look at here the
[43:00] division and worry verses one through
[43:02] eight in the first eight verses you see
[43:05] four kingdoms or four beasts if you've
[43:08] ever read lately just so you know first
[43:11] one and the first year of Belshazzar
[43:13] king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and
[43:15] visions of his head upon his bed then he
[43:18] wrote the dream and told the sum of the
[43:20] matters Daniel spake and said I saw my
[43:23] vision by night and behold the four
[43:25] winds of the sea strobe upon the Great
[43:26] Sea and four beasts came up from the sea
[43:31] diverse one for another another
[43:34] different one for another so what Daniel
[43:35] sees this vision therefore diverse there
[43:39] four separate beasts but when John saw
[43:41] they're all in one beast how many did
[43:43] you anybody catch that here Daniel sees
[43:45] it and they're separate four separate
[43:47] beasts but when John sees that they're
[43:49] all mixed up into one of your brother
[43:52] have tell us about that isn't just a
[43:53] moment now verse for the first was like
[43:57] a lion and had eagle's wings I be held
[44:02] to the wings were plucked and it was
[44:04] lifted up from the earth and made stand
[44:07] upon the feet as a man and a man's heart
[44:09] was given on who does that sound
[44:11] familiar the man's heart and the beasts
[44:12] heart that's Nebuchadnezzar remember
[44:14] that one he was given a beast heart
[44:16] praise the Lord so this first beast lion
[44:20] represents Babylon it represents the
[44:22] king of
[44:23] kezer all right we'll show this later my
[44:25] brother branham's quotes you'll see it
[44:27] now notice their diverse they're
[44:29] different and they rise up verse 5 i've
[44:32] always wondered what the lion the bear
[44:35] and the leopard where but now we know by
[44:37] God's grace now we don't burst fun and
[44:39] another and beheld another beast a
[44:42] second like to a bear and it raised up
[44:44] itself on one side and they had three
[44:46] ribs in the mouth of it between the
[44:48] teeth of it and they said the Sun to
[44:51] arise devour much flesh okay so the
[44:55] second piece the bear is the Medes and
[44:57] Persians the Medes and Persians they
[45:00] came immediately after the Babylonian
[45:02] Kingdom after the Babylonian Kingdom
[45:04] rose up the Medes and Persians fact
[45:07] rated there in Daniels time next piece
[45:10] verse 6 and after this I beheld and lo
[45:12] another like a leopard which had upon
[45:15] the back of it for wings of a file the
[45:18] Beast had also for heads and Dominion
[45:21] was given unto it hey this is the
[45:24] Grecian kingdom led by Alexander the
[45:26] Great if you know the scripture there
[45:29] we'll get to it also in Daniel chapter 2
[45:31] now verse 7 is now the Roman kingdom
[45:35] after this I saw the night visions to be
[45:37] held a fourth beast dreadful and
[45:39] terrible and strong exceedingly and it
[45:41] had great iron notice that iron teeth
[45:43] this beast has ayran teeth if you know
[45:46] anything about Daniel's vision in Daniel
[45:48] chapter 2 the fourth part of the beast
[45:50] was legs of what iron and then the feet
[45:53] were iron and clay mixed together right
[45:56] so again this shows this fourth piece
[46:00] was a symbol of the Roman Empire it
[46:04] devoured him break in pieces and stamped
[46:06] the residue with the feet of it and it
[46:08] was diverse from all the beasts that
[46:10] were before and it had ten horns doesn't
[46:13] that sound forbidden from revelation 13
[46:15] and had seven heads and ten horns amen
[46:18] now go to Daniel chapter 2 Daniel
[46:24] chapter 2 believe it's 31 if i'm not
[46:26] mistaken or 36 this is
[46:31] Daniel gives the interpretation my
[46:34] brother ban can you skip ahead you might
[46:36] have 2x out but can you skip ahead to
[46:38] slide 128 it's got the picture of the
[46:42] image that in King Nebuchadnezzar saw if
[46:44] you can skip ahead of that then we'll
[46:46] read here in Daniel chapter 2 there it
[46:49] is thank you but hey praise God
[46:50] wonderful now if you haven't seen this
[46:53] before this is what Nebuchadnezzar dream
[46:55] remember and his men could have figured
[46:57] out and daniel said just give me some
[46:58] time give me some time alone with the
[47:00] Lord and the gift will start working
[47:01] praise God that's how every gift works
[47:04] right spend time with the Lord the gift
[47:06] of God will go to work in your life
[47:07] whether it's tongues interpretation
[47:09] prophecy whatever it is give God some
[47:11] time I'm really sorry this is small but
[47:13] i can email to everybody the Babylonian
[47:15] Empire was the head of gold that was
[47:17] Nebuchadnezzar Daniel tells this the
[47:20] Nebuchadnezzar is the state the word of
[47:21] God the chest hair breasts of silver was
[47:26] the Medes and Persians ok there's the
[47:28] bear so there's the lion bear okay the
[47:31] thighs here was the Grecian Empire
[47:33] Alexander the Great from 3 30 12 146 BC
[47:37] I forgot to read the years up here so
[47:41] here's the years of Nebuchadnezzar and
[47:42] King Darius now once you get down to the
[47:45] legs of iron you get into the Imperial
[47:47] pagan Roman Empire that's before the
[47:50] Holy Roman Empire knots not wholly just
[47:52] they call it holy all right it's not
[47:55] holding but down here at the feet you
[47:57] have Catholicism and Protestants a
[48:02] Protestantism iron represents
[48:04] Catholicism because they're iron they
[48:06] won't Bend and they go into all the
[48:08] world and then convert everybody as
[48:10] proselytes right so that's what program
[48:13] teaches us the iron and clay mixed
[48:15] together now keep that up there brother
[48:17] bang now if you would Daniel 236 here's
[48:21] where Daniel gets thus saith the lord
[48:23] and he gives it to King Nebuchadnezzar
[48:26] no does that start to make sense a
[48:28] little bit by God's grace in Daniel 7 he
[48:30] saw the east for diverse from each other
[48:33] they were separate from each other but
[48:34] John sees that revelation 13 and they're
[48:36] all combined into what beasts praise the
[48:39] Lord all right you might be thinking why
[48:42] they combined brother man tells us it's
[48:44] very
[48:45] very simple but let's just hold on this
[48:46] to Daniel 236 this is the dream and we
[48:50] will tell the interpretation they're up
[48:51] for our they're up before the king the
[48:54] owl King aren't a king of kings for the
[48:57] God of heaven have given the Aquino
[48:58] power and strength to glory and where's
[49:00] over the children of men well the beasts
[49:02] of the field and the fowls of the heaven
[49:04] hath he given into that hand and have
[49:06] made thou the ruler over up them all
[49:08] thou art this head of gold so in church
[49:11] isn't it now said the Lord from a profit
[49:13] Babylon is the head of gold can really
[49:15] see that by God's grace he said you came
[49:17] through the king of the babla you're the
[49:19] head of gold he's the lion that was
[49:20] talking about right there he's the line
[49:22] that was talked about all right now next
[49:25] one verse 39 and after these shall rise
[49:29] another Kingdom inferior to thee and
[49:31] another third kingdom of grass which
[49:34] shall bear rule over all the earth brass
[49:36] again what is the Grecian Empire but one
[49:38] that was lesser was the needs and
[49:40] Persians and history backs us up as well
[49:43] versed for nelligan verse 40 remember
[49:46] what we read in Daniel 7 and the fourth
[49:48] kingdom shall be strong as what iron and
[49:51] we just read that that horned beast here
[49:53] strong as iron now it says I'm sorry
[50:00] missed my part for as much as iron
[50:01] breaketh and pieces and subdue with all
[50:03] things and as iron that breaketh all
[50:05] these shall break in pieces and brews
[50:07] and whereas thou sawest the feet and the
[50:10] toes part of potters clay and part of
[50:12] iron the kingdom shall be divided but
[50:14] there shall be in it of strength of the
[50:16] iron for as much as thou saws the iron
[50:18] mixed with miry clay and as the toes of
[50:22] the feet were part of iron apart or clay
[50:24] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[50:25] and partly broken and whereas thou
[50:28] sawest iron mixed with miry clay they
[50:30] shall mingle themselves with the seed of
[50:32] men you only know brother Graham said
[50:33] that was he said that was Catholics
[50:36] intermarrying with Protestants now I can
[50:39] show you the quotes if you want to see
[50:40] them they shall mingle themselves so the
[50:42] iron was trying to mingle right with the
[50:44] Protestants that's why if a Catholic
[50:46] marries a loser who who could hook it
[50:48] hurts the loser right I see that's
[50:52] happened to my family right Luther
[50:54] American Catholic Lutheran converts to
[50:56] Catholicism because they mean
[50:58] Oh their seat brother branham said but
[51:02] they shall not cleave one to another
[51:03] even as iron is not mixed with clay okay
[51:07] so look at today are the Catholics and
[51:09] Protestants mingling together not really
[51:11] right but they will become united at the
[51:15] end time right we know that but they're
[51:16] not mixed fully they're not they're
[51:18] still separate numbers 44 here's where
[51:21] we look here's where I look forward to
[51:23] this is Armageddon in the days of these
[51:26] Kings shall the God of heaven set up a
[51:27] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[51:29] amen no ending that can only be Christ's
[51:32] millennial reign right and then the same
[51:34] rain that goes into the future home and
[51:36] the kingdom shall be I'm sorry shall not
[51:39] be left to other people but it shall
[51:41] break in pieces and consume all these
[51:43] kingdoms and it shall stand forever amen
[51:45] for as much as I saw that the stone was
[51:48] cut off the mountain with hands without
[51:50] hands but let it break in pieces the IRA
[51:54] at the brass and the clay the silver and
[51:55] the gold the Great God have made known
[51:58] to the king why shall come to pass her
[52:00] after and the dream discern and the
[52:02] interpretation thereof sure praise the
[52:05] Lord remember brother random dramatized
[52:08] when Christ went down into paradise
[52:10] after he was crucified he said he
[52:13] dramatized each of the Saints looking
[52:15] out and saying what what what they saw
[52:17] Jesus like Ezekiel Johnson hey there's
[52:19] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[52:20] remember that and he said Daniel looked
[52:22] out they said there's the stone that was
[52:25] cut out of the mountain today man so
[52:27] Daniel saw Christ come back and
[52:30] Armageddon and he went down the Bible
[52:32] said he went out and struck that image
[52:34] at the feet and where was the feet the
[52:37] feet was Roman Roman aslam and cooks are
[52:40] catholicism protestantism that's what
[52:42] christ is going to smash when he comes
[52:44] back at Armageddon everybody with me by
[52:46] God's grace amen hope hope you are by
[52:48] God's grace uh I think you'll get it
[52:52] here by the grace of the Lord now you
[52:56] see this here now let's go brother bang
[52:58] if we can let's head back back up a
[53:01] little bit let's go up to 112 now 112
[53:03] you don't know how he did that he did
[53:04] pretty good all right so we got the
[53:07] first symbol okay so the first symbol in
[53:11] Revelation 13
[53:12] I was imperial pagan Rome coming up out
[53:16] of the sea that was the legs of brass
[53:18] those legs of brass that's what it was
[53:21] that was manifesting so this is the legs
[53:23] of rafts coming up this is impaired of
[53:25] paying your own coming upon the earth
[53:26] now you wonder why does have the other
[53:28] beast in it hopefully we'll get to that
[53:30] soon brother branwell taos exactly right
[53:32] but let's first look at the see why is
[53:34] it coming out to see next one brother
[53:36] bang seer waters represents multitudes
[53:39] of people so when you read the Bible you
[53:42] have to understand if it's a vision from
[53:43] a prophet sees represent many many
[53:46] people brother may next one here's where
[53:48] it says it and he said unto me the
[53:50] waters which style sauce where the hopes
[53:52] sitteth are people's and
[53:54] multitudes and nations and tongues amen
[53:56] so that pagan Rome Imperial pagan
[54:01] government came out of many many people
[54:03] right it was a worldwide rain all roads
[54:07] led to Rome let me know that on time to
[54:10] go on the history I don't even have it
[54:11] in front of me to do that but that's how
[54:13] it was all roads lead to Rome they rule
[54:15] the horse look at the time of Jesus you
[54:17] know they try to control everything
[54:19] that's the spirit of rome next my
[54:21] brother man so this piece that came out
[54:23] revelation 13 12 is pagan Rome's kingdom
[54:27] with combined demon powers of the first
[54:31] three Gentile kingdoms all right now
[54:38] brother man can you go down to verse
[54:40] herbs I'm sorry to slide 122 let's see
[54:43] where the prophet said that then we'll
[54:44] head back up here's where broadband says
[54:47] this so you understand it now in Daniel
[54:49] 7 there's four separate ones right and
[54:51] now in John observe Revelation 13 John
[54:54] sees them all combined okay next one
[54:56] here's the prophets revelation listen to
[54:58] it its mark of the beast 1954 amen
[55:01] Church he was always a profit even
[55:03] before the seals on NVIDIA he's always a
[55:06] profit and he had revelations from God
[55:08] amen he spoke thus saith the Lord now we
[55:11] got two things under consideration i
[55:13] watch this beast it has four different
[55:15] characters in it the one we just saw if
[55:18] you'll take daniel 7 you who are
[55:21] marketed down to no.7 Daniel saw the
[55:23] same vision 800 years
[55:26] before this all the vision he saw those
[55:29] beasts separate from one another in the
[55:32] beginning of the Gentile ruling alright
[55:34] next one all right here's where I opened
[55:37] up to meet your dope won't go catch you
[55:39] right here and here they are John sing
[55:42] it and the end of the Gentile really so
[55:45] John sing the end of that Gentile
[55:46] statute are you seeing the legs of the
[55:48] feet all four of those beasts
[55:52] represented in one beast now here's
[55:56] where it is them save old Devils demons
[56:00] that possessed each kingdom of the
[56:02] Romans down through in the Greeks and so
[56:05] forth down to the Gentile dispensation
[56:06] has come right down and all met up in
[56:10] one beast and you say amen to that so
[56:14] before when Daniel sought a hundred
[56:16] years before the four beasts were
[56:18] separate but after each kingdom went out
[56:21] after Babylonian Kingdom went out those
[56:23] same demons came into the Medes and
[56:25] Persians Kingdom and then when Alexander
[56:29] came in the same demons that were there
[56:31] in the and the beads of Persians came
[56:34] into the Grecian Kingdom amen and then
[56:36] with the creation kingdom without the
[56:38] same old Devils came in the Roman
[56:40] kingdom are you with me Lori that
[56:43] beautiful and then open up the Bible to
[56:45] you I daniya always wondered what was
[56:48] the leper but Mr bear all these things
[56:50] well God has revealed it through a
[56:52] profit a man there it is now we can see
[56:55] it by God's grace beautiful now probably
[56:59] I go back up to 116 if you can I really
[57:01] appreciate your help but really I'm just
[57:03] kind of trying to follow follow the
[57:06] leading of the Lord here now what are
[57:07] the seven heads represent the seven
[57:09] heads are seven mountains of ancient
[57:11] Rome because even ancient Rome was still
[57:13] build on that's in fact where that's in
[57:15] fact where the Seven Hills actually are
[57:16] in the old city of ancient Rome the old
[57:19] part of a chiral not the current Vatican
[57:21] location but they call it ancient Rome
[57:23] now that's the next one by the bank
[57:25] revelation 17 9 here's the mind which
[57:27] hath wisdom the seven heads of the set
[57:28] melons on which the woman sitteth praise
[57:31] the Lord next one by the bank one of the
[57:34] ten horns the Bible tells us there are
[57:36] 10 earthly kings now these are still
[57:38] future but wait
[57:40] Daniel and both John thought they had
[57:42] ten horns to show that at one time this
[57:44] kingdom is going to have the power of
[57:46] ten Kings upon the earth right now we
[57:49] might call them dictators we've not calm
[57:51] other things around the world but
[57:52] there's going to be ten kings or
[57:53] dictators upon this earth that give
[57:55] their power unto the Roman Catholic
[57:57] Church that's right that's the scripture
[57:59] next one brother may at least in 1712
[58:02] and the ten horns which thou sawest are
[58:04] ten Kings which have received no Kingdom
[58:07] as of yet but receive power as kings one
[58:11] hour with the Beast it was the Beast
[58:13] there's spirit of Rome in that hour so
[58:17] they're going to rip these ten Kings
[58:18] around the world are going to receive
[58:20] powder with the Roman Catholic Church
[58:21] for only one hour remember that our they
[58:23] get destroyed it doesn't last very long
[58:25] these have one mind and shall give their
[58:28] power and strength unto the peace so the
[58:32] Catholic Church is going to add backing
[58:33] from all the kingdoms right and backings
[58:35] from all 10 of these Kings he's going to
[58:38] have all that there she's going to have
[58:39] all that power okay next one brother
[58:41] baby verse 16 and the ten horns which
[58:44] thou sawest upon the Beast these shall
[58:46] hate the and shall make her
[58:48] desolate and naked and shall eat her
[58:50] flesh and burn her with fire neck
[58:52] scripture for God has put in their
[58:54] hearts to fulfill his will to agree and
[58:56] give their Kingdom unto the Beast until
[58:59] the words of God should be fulfilled so
[59:01] they're going to have a love-hate
[59:02] relationship with this with this woman
[59:04] they're going to love her for an hour
[59:05] give her a power but after that they're
[59:08] gonna are going to hate her the Bible
[59:09] says right all right my brother bang if
[59:14] you can skip down to berk 126 slide 1 26
[59:20] now if you got your Bibles revelation 13
[59:24] 3 to 10 is the current holy Roly hold up
[59:32] holy roman empire now holy rollers a
[59:34] holy roman empire pardon me my
[59:42] revelation 13 verse 3 now I'm going to
[59:48] leave it brother bang we're just leave
[59:50] it there for a little bit here I'm going
[59:52] to read some quotes from and talked
[59:53] about this in the church
[59:53] change book okay now verse 3 revelation
[59:56] 13 3 now what happened to verse 3 memory
[1:00:01] read this and I saw one of the heads as
[1:00:03] it were wounded to death and his deadly
[1:00:04] wound was healed and all the world
[1:00:06] wondered after the Beast alright let me
[1:00:10] read my brother man told about this here
[1:00:12] on the church age book just a moment
[1:00:19] here all right now he's talking about
[1:00:29] the third church age so this scripture
[1:00:31] Revelation 13 3 happened during the
[1:00:33] third church age you looked like it
[1:00:35] looked like this beast that rose up was
[1:00:37] killed but then it got healed so it
[1:00:40] didn't he never died it got healed I
[1:00:43] wrote down says this he said in right in
[1:00:47] this age of the Pergamum program only in
[1:00:50] church age he says when the Beast of
[1:00:53] Revelation 13 3 that was wounded to
[1:00:55] death the pagan Roman Empire came back
[1:00:59] to life and power as the holy roman
[1:01:02] empire so papal rome lost some of its
[1:01:08] power but that life that evil Antichrist
[1:01:12] spirit got life again through working
[1:01:14] and marrying to the catholic church all
[1:01:17] right that's what ba-bam says it was
[1:01:19] married he says it actually says this
[1:01:21] not only was this day in church wet in
[1:01:24] this age but the babylonian religion was
[1:01:26] officially joined to the first church
[1:01:27] say you now have access to the name of
[1:01:29] Christ and he was enthroned as God and
[1:01:31] worship and with the help of federal a
[1:01:34] the churches fell heir to beautiful
[1:01:35] buildings which were lined with altars
[1:01:37] of white marble and images of the
[1:01:39] departed Saints honey know the history
[1:01:41] of Constantine that happened when
[1:01:42] Constantine was ruling memory had a
[1:01:45] dream and he saw he saw a cross so he
[1:01:48] said if you if you paint this cross on
[1:01:50] the shelves of your men do get victory
[1:01:53] and so he did that the next morning he
[1:01:55] painted it and he got the victory they
[1:01:56] rename the city constant oh boy named it
[1:01:59] after himself there but after that he he
[1:02:04] married church and state and then as
[1:02:06] program says
[1:02:07] through history they took those pagan
[1:02:09] temples and they just changed the names
[1:02:11] of the gods to Christian names that's
[1:02:13] all they did and they married church and
[1:02:15] state now what's a sad thing is that
[1:02:17] most inama nations rejoice over
[1:02:19] Constantine today because Constantine
[1:02:21] made christianity the official religion
[1:02:22] and they stop persecuting them and for
[1:02:25] example some family members of our
[1:02:27] church that used to be Baptist sent us
[1:02:29] some books about church history and the
[1:02:31] books recover all church history from
[1:02:32] the time of Christ till now and the book
[1:02:35] about Constantine they rejoice they
[1:02:37] celebrate Constantine because Christians
[1:02:40] were no longer persecuted and so there
[1:02:42] to see than they think oh that was a
[1:02:44] good thing now don't get me wrong it's a
[1:02:46] good thing of Christians ought to be
[1:02:47] persecuted but it's a bad thing to marry
[1:02:49] paganism with Christianity praise God so
[1:02:53] that's how to see most denominations are
[1:02:55] today they think oh that's a good thing
[1:02:56] he saw a cross and brother Graham said
[1:02:59] he wasn't converted just as much as a
[1:03:00] great can be converted or something like
[1:03:02] that he said he wasn't convert he wasn't
[1:03:04] even a real Christian he was just
[1:03:06] following the dream and he never got
[1:03:09] baptized everly got saved and see what
[1:03:11] the Holy Ghost so he was a man that was
[1:03:13] still a worldly man and he just united
[1:03:15] church and state all right now here's
[1:03:19] brother Brandon describing chapter 13
[1:03:21] verse 3 Rome as a material nation had
[1:03:25] suffered much depletion and soon would
[1:03:27] suffer completely but it mattered not
[1:03:29] now for her religious Empire would keep
[1:03:32] her on top of the world governing from
[1:03:34] the inside where she would not appear to
[1:03:37] be doing soap from the outside now to
[1:03:41] prove this brother man goes back to
[1:03:44] Daniel too but we already read that
[1:03:45] right that's what I want to read that
[1:03:46] earlier to prove this boat man said let
[1:03:49] me show you the exact script truth of
[1:03:51] this and he goes back to Daniel to 31 to
[1:03:53] 45 which we already read and he proves
[1:03:56] it there and it reads it lists all those
[1:03:58] scriptures in the church age book now he
[1:04:00] says this here it has revealed an exact
[1:04:08] account of future unfilled history that
[1:04:10] was prophesied to come upon the earth
[1:04:12] from the time of Daniel until Jesus
[1:04:14] would come and reign as a son of David
[1:04:16] this is known as the times of the
[1:04:18] Gentiles well then can you go back to
[1:04:21] that slow
[1:04:21] i D let me give you the number here so
[1:04:24] everybody conceding in 128 so it's two
[1:04:26] more slides thank you now look at this
[1:04:29] while you listen to what brother branham
[1:04:31] said programs and this is the times of
[1:04:32] the Gentiles so when Daniel here started
[1:04:35] it you know he was prophesied this is
[1:04:37] the time the Gentiles would rule the
[1:04:38] earth right in Christ of course he
[1:04:42] smashes it here at Armageddon then no
[1:04:44] longer our Gentiles ruling then Christ
[1:04:46] is ruling at that point amen but Bob
[1:04:50] answer this is the times of the Gentiles
[1:04:51] it had within it for historical
[1:04:54] divisions which were known by the
[1:04:56] dominating empire in each division
[1:04:57] Babylonian means and Persians Grecian
[1:05:00] Roman the greatest and most absolute
[1:05:03] monarchy was babbling which was typify
[1:05:05] daz ahead of gold the next thing glory
[1:05:07] was the Medes and Persians which has
[1:05:09] history barat was truly less glorious
[1:05:10] and was typify daz the breasts and arms
[1:05:12] of silver then their father Grecian age
[1:05:15] whose king was the most period of all
[1:05:17] military leaders the world has ever
[1:05:19] known so it was fittingly type typify
[1:05:21] daz the belly and thighs of brass
[1:05:23] finally came the last kingdom which was
[1:05:25] the Roman Empire typify daz the legs and
[1:05:27] feet but where the former kingdoms were
[1:05:30] simplified as pure materials this last
[1:05:33] Empire was pure iron only in the legs
[1:05:36] for when it came to defeat it was a
[1:05:37] mixture of iron and clay amen and he
[1:05:42] said now be not only is this so but most
[1:05:45] amazing this last Roman Empire he said
[1:05:48] would last right up until Jesus returns
[1:05:51] praise God that's why brother BAM can
[1:05:54] say how can rush or rule he said
[1:05:56] Russia's not going to rule he said
[1:05:58] Rome's going to rule thus saith the Lord
[1:06:00] how do we know that what's he basing
[1:06:02] about he's basing it on Daniels vision
[1:06:04] and the interpretation Russia is not
[1:06:07] going to rule Rome was going to rule but
[1:06:09] how does Rome ruling out through the
[1:06:11] church right and she rules now even
[1:06:15] through the United States is where this
[1:06:16] beast advances to as we'll see in just a
[1:06:19] few moments here alright oh brother have
[1:06:23] said since the Roman Empire iron
[1:06:25] signifying power great destructive force
[1:06:28] against opposition was to be made of two
[1:06:30] main opposition's east and west so see
[1:06:32] this is roland empire east and west
[1:06:36] both of them very powerful crushing all
[1:06:39] before them he said but as the glory and
[1:06:41] power of all empires fail so this Empire
[1:06:44] began to fall off so thus Rome fell in
[1:06:47] peril pagan Rome was no longer iron she
[1:06:49] crumbled she was wounded to death Rome
[1:06:52] could not not rule it was all over so
[1:06:54] thought the world see that stuff thought
[1:06:56] the world but how wrong the world was
[1:06:59] for that Headroom the wounded was not
[1:07:02] wounded unto death revelation 13 three
[1:07:05] people look at Rome they look at the
[1:07:08] nation of Italy and as they look they do
[1:07:10] not realize that Rome with her strict
[1:07:12] confines where the Pope as an actual
[1:07:14] area as his domain is literally a nation
[1:07:17] within a nation and she has ambassadors
[1:07:19] and receives ambassadors papo Falls
[1:07:22] Christian Rome now controls by religion
[1:07:25] even more aptly than when pagan Imperial
[1:07:28] Rome controlled by pure iron of force
[1:07:31] amen he said Rome took on a new lease of
[1:07:34] life when Constantine joined church
[1:07:36] mistake and back the Union by force the
[1:07:40] spirit that motivated pagan Rome is the
[1:07:41] same spirit that now motivates false
[1:07:43] Christian Rome you can see that is so
[1:07:45] because you now know that the fourth
[1:07:47] Empire never went out of existence it
[1:07:50] just changed its outer texture how many
[1:07:53] can say amen to that so prophet just
[1:07:56] interpreted for us this is East and West
[1:07:58] Roman Empire but now down here is their
[1:08:01] Holy One holy roman empire i'll say like
[1:08:04] that that's true all right now this one
[1:08:08] has to exist remember until the time
[1:08:12] when Jesus returns after the tribulation
[1:08:14] this Gentile kingdom will rule that loan
[1:08:17] ok Bango the next slide 129 there it
[1:08:22] warned now next one verses 11 to 18 is
[1:08:27] the power of the Holy Roman Empire
[1:08:29] United States how many we're aware that
[1:08:31] a men's let's go there revelation 3 i'm
[1:08:36] sorry 13 11 13 11
[1:08:54] all right revelation 13 11 now remember
[1:09:00] what did John see John and verse 12
[1:09:01] John's Ontario pegatron rising up out of
[1:09:05] the sea right he saw rising up and it
[1:09:10] had all the heck of a demon spirits of
[1:09:12] the first three previous kingdoms the
[1:09:15] Babylonian Kingdom head of the demons of
[1:09:17] that one demons of the Medes and
[1:09:19] Persians and the demons of the Grecian
[1:09:21] walk uniting in this power now it's the
[1:09:23] Roman power pagan Rome but in verse 3
[1:09:26] imperil pagan Rome dies so don't robot
[1:09:30] the Romans any more naturally our
[1:09:31] government elite but now the Roman
[1:09:34] Catholic Church pagan papal rome now
[1:09:36] rules the world by her religion or
[1:09:39] deception alright and then she rules
[1:09:41] from her street on the verse 10 now we
[1:09:44] pick it up at verse 11 I got this this
[1:09:47] is from again brother man preaching on
[1:09:49] this in 1954 the mark of the beast if
[1:09:52] you want to look at it a wonderful
[1:09:53] message here all right now verse 11 and
[1:09:59] I beheld
[1:10:01] beast coming up out of the earth and he
[1:10:03] had two horns like a lamb and he spake
[1:10:06] as a dragon and he exercises all the
[1:10:10] power of the first piece before and
[1:10:12] causes the earth and them which dwell
[1:10:16] therein to worship the first beast whose
[1:10:17] deadly wound was healed so this beast
[1:10:22] causes everybody to worship the Beast
[1:10:24] the earlier beast how is it because it's
[1:10:28] the same demon spirit right it's the
[1:10:30] same demon power as we said here is the
[1:10:33] power of the Holy remanent Roman Empire
[1:10:35] through the United States how did the
[1:10:37] Roman Empire get the United States they
[1:10:38] elected chafe cable around said they
[1:10:40] elected the wrong guy right through
[1:10:43] popular vote of women he said when women
[1:10:47] of course we got the remote avoiding
[1:10:48] three years but now they back side and
[1:10:50] through the popular vote of women they
[1:10:52] erected the law or elected the wrong man
[1:10:54] amen and now Roman Empire now has a
[1:10:59] leader here in the United States that's
[1:11:02] right now verse 13 and he do with great
[1:11:08] wonder so that he maketh Fire come down
[1:11:10] from heaven on the earth in the sight of
[1:11:13] men and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[1:11:16] earth by means of those miracles which
[1:11:17] he had power to do in the side of the
[1:11:19] beast saying to them that dwell on the
[1:11:21] earth that they should make an image to
[1:11:23] the Beast which had the wound by a sword
[1:11:26] and did lives there so the United States
[1:11:29] somehow is going to have some part in
[1:11:30] this image under the Beast I know with
[1:11:32] the images over after the image is the
[1:11:35] World Council of Churches remember that
[1:11:37] the image under the Beast of em of the
[1:11:39] Beast is invisible demon spear by the
[1:11:41] spirit of Rome but they need an image
[1:11:43] for the beach so that image of the beast
[1:11:45] is the Royal counts of churches program
[1:11:47] said they don't mean to do if I at one
[1:11:49] point though unite with the Roman
[1:11:50] Catholic Church and the Pope will be
[1:11:52] head of it all human though they did not
[1:11:53] envision it that way that's right all
[1:11:56] right now brother bang I don't have the
[1:12:01] quotes was just stay right here but
[1:12:02] madam said this is mark of the beast
[1:12:03] 1954 this United States is rotten to the
[1:12:06] core he says he says will redound here
[1:12:09] in Revelation the fifteenth verse they
[1:12:12] said I want to go back to 11th okay now
[1:12:14] brother BAM
[1:12:14] the eleventh verse and I beheld another
[1:12:16] beast coming up on the earth a problem
[1:12:19] says out of the earth that the thickness
[1:12:22] and multitudes of people's water then
[1:12:24] this is where there was no people the
[1:12:27] United States praise God so in verse 11
[1:12:30] that earth right there is North America
[1:12:33] or United States can you say amen to
[1:12:35] that Lauren this beast did not come up
[1:12:38] out of the water like Imperial pagan
[1:12:40] Rome this feast or the spirit of Rome
[1:12:42] came up on the United States the earth
[1:12:44] that earth program said is united states
[1:12:48] now look and he had two horns like a
[1:12:51] lamb and he spake as it dragged him
[1:12:55] listen what his brother Adam call the
[1:12:57] two horns I don't know what he calls it
[1:12:59] he said what is it it's our American
[1:13:01] Buffalo did you know that this lens like
[1:13:08] a lamb right that's a description says
[1:13:09] but I said it wasn't a lamp it was like
[1:13:11] a layer I program said like a lamb beans
[1:13:15] just like freedom of religion he says
[1:13:18] that's what he says sure then there's
[1:13:20] two horns like a lamb but what did he do
[1:13:22] he had freedom of religion first he
[1:13:24] acted like a leaner but he spoke he said
[1:13:28] he would snow goggle haven't remember he
[1:13:30] never did become an old ram he was the
[1:13:31] lamb this country is only a hundred and
[1:13:34] fifty years old you know just a lamb so
[1:13:36] human road app says a lamb represents a
[1:13:38] young country so the Edit so the spirit
[1:13:41] of Rome rises up in the earth rises up
[1:13:43] by the united states are with me looks
[1:13:46] like a lamb looks like freedom of
[1:13:48] religion but it speaks like a dragon it
[1:13:50] speaks like Satan with the power Satan

[1:14:43] United States on ouya the Bill of the
[1:14:48] result of a lobbying effort from
[1:14:49] conservationists the files a long
[1:14:52] history that saw the Bison here we go
[1:14:54] extinct in the 19th century I said the
[1:14:57] Bison often called the buffalo has
[1:14:59] appeared on everything from a famous us
[1:15:01] nickel to Tuesday flags the seal the
[1:15:03] Department of Interior and even the

[1:16:33] beast which is that Roman spirit praise
[1:16:37] God's make it really obvious the Roman
[1:16:39] Empire right America is going to cause

[1:18:45] governments we're trying to unite to
[1:18:47] Christ Jesus and we can't say we have
[1:18:49] been told we've been told amen we've
[1:18:52] been told all right now brother bang
[1:18:57] next slide here let's go next wonder all
[1:19:04] right here's where he says again like
[1:19:09] the angel told John I'll show you this
[1:19:11] judgment that's coming to the great
[1:19:12] church now watch now this is speaking of
[1:19:15] revelation 17 so it carry me away in the
[1:19:17] spirit of Lourdes and I saw a woman
[1:19:18] setting upon a scarlet coloured Beast
[1:19:20] scarlet the bottom represents royal the
[1:19:23] colour scarlet means red and beast
[1:19:25] represents power next slide did you
[1:19:27] notice the bees that come about a seed
[1:19:28] that was in the revelation the 13th and
[1:19:31] when you see the beast coming up out of
[1:19:33] Assiut met that this power was raising
[1:19:36] up among the people but in Revelation 13
[1:19:40] when this lamb came up he came up on the
[1:19:43] earth no people united states praise God
[1:19:48] so everybody see that by God's grace
[1:19:50] earth in Revelation 13 11 represents the
[1:19:53] United States and this beast this Roman
[1:19:56] spirit rises up where there's not many
[1:19:58] people just Native Americans right he
[1:20:00] rises up out of here all right now the
[1:20:02] out of the earth which is United States
[1:20:04] next one and then after that he had two
[1:20:07] little horns look the horns represent
[1:20:08] something so the symbols even have a
[1:20:11] representation so it's a buffalo rifle
[1:20:14] guess it's a buffalo a young muffled up
[1:20:18] garden which is that comes the country's
[1:20:21] mammal official mammal his two horns
[1:20:24] represent civil and ecclesiastical
[1:20:26] powers there's the marriage of church
[1:20:29] and state are you with me and then he
[1:20:33] received power and spoke like the dragon
[1:20:34] in perform so you just got to mark it
[1:20:37] down so these these horns represent
[1:20:39] symbol and ecclesiastical powers
[1:20:42] and state powers he said mark it down
[1:20:45] were coming into religious persecution
[1:20:47] with the same things they didn't pagan
[1:20:49] Rome many years ago for its what they'll
[1:20:52] say the Lord I'm not giving you my ideas

[1:21:00] ought to rejoice I knew you amen this is
[1:21:04] thus said the Lord hallelujah the earth
[1:21:08] is the North America United States Rome
[1:21:11] rises up looks like a little lamb but
[1:21:14] it's actually a buffalo it's got two
[1:21:16] horns church and state it's going to
[1:21:18] unite those powers and they're bringing
[1:21:21] a persecution it's thus saith the Lord
[1:21:25] how is up the message of the hour Oh

[1:23:42] sprint another time next slide now let's
[1:23:47] go to verse 16 them remember verse 15
[1:23:52] they're going to start killing people
[1:23:54] the United States is going to start
[1:23:55] killing people robinsons religious

[1:24:00] state the Lord is coming to America and
[1:24:04] only the Holy Ghost will keep us ready
[1:24:06] and prepare ssin and help us to escape
[1:24:08] by God's grace verse 16 now revelation
[1:24:12] oh yeah right you're right there with a
[1:24:13] revelation 13 16 is the squeeze right
[1:24:16] followed by the laying down of the mark
[1:24:18] of the beast next slide brother bang
[1:24:20] thank you remember I just rather stay a
[1:24:22] few weeks ago I believe a corner
[1:24:24] revelation 13 16 that the bride wife to
[1:24:27] stop preaching does the squeeze for the
[1:24:30] Beast is demanding the mark in the right
[1:24:32] hand or forehead a permission to be
[1:24:34] preached be granted denominations will
[1:24:37] take the mark or be forced to quit
[1:24:38] preaching then the land will come first
[1:24:41] bride and judge the great harlot amen
[1:24:45] remember he said I never rode this he
[1:24:47] said he wrote it so I'm taking brother
[1:24:49] ran him at his word I just believe that
[1:24:50] because that's what he said next time
[1:24:56] this be
[1:24:57] has the same number of heads and horns
[1:25:00] as the Scarlet beast of revelation 17 3
[1:25:02] s let's turn your Bibles weekend
[1:25:06] revelation 17 remember who is revelation
[1:25:13] 17 it's Mystery Babylon right the woman
[1:25:16] who rides the Beast this is the same
[1:25:17] beast just start a colored now
[1:25:22] revelation 17 3 so he carried me away in
[1:25:25] the spirit into the lunas and I saw a
[1:25:27] woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast
[1:25:28] full of the names of blasphemy member
[1:25:31] names of last a chapter 13 the name of
[1:25:34] lasting doubts names of blasphemy having
[1:25:36] seven heads and ten horns praise God now
[1:25:45] got your Bibles I'm gonna close this
[1:25:47] let's go back to Revelation 13 back
[1:25:50] there to verse 17 I'm sorry verse 16
[1:25:55] let's read this relation 13 16 again I
[1:25:57] didn't read all that so now you see that
[1:25:59] same beast that was in Revelation 13 is
[1:26:02] the same be sets of revelation 17 which
[1:26:04] was the same beast i was in Daniel 7
[1:26:07] amen that's how I was telling brother
[1:26:09] Austin those brothers you know the you
[1:26:11] have to interpret the Bible by the Bible
[1:26:13] right we don't do with go to any other
[1:26:15] book the Bible interprets itself and we
[1:26:19] can know thus saith the Lord we can know
[1:26:21] what the leopard is we can know the
[1:26:22] Bears we can know what the beast is
[1:26:24] where you know who the woman is we can
[1:26:26] know who everybody is praise God because
[1:26:28] the Bible interprets itself it just
[1:26:30] needs a prophet to bring the light to us
[1:26:32] amen now verse 16 I'm closing and he
[1:26:36] causes all both small and great rich and
[1:26:38] poor free and bond to receive a mark in
[1:26:40] their right hand or their forehead so
[1:26:42] remember that scripture brother Graham
[1:26:43] said they have to stop the bride from
[1:26:45] preaching and then Christ has got to
[1:26:47] come and get his wife before they kill
[1:26:49] anybody or before the bride is killed of
[1:26:52] course verse 16 I'm sure I just read
[1:26:55] that verse 17 and that no man might buy
[1:26:58] or sell save he that had the mark or the
[1:27:01] number of the beast or the number of his
[1:27:03] name to look into or you ever see that
[1:27:05] or so he can deceive in many ways he can
[1:27:08] deceive uh
[1:27:11] mark or the name so somebody just trust
[1:27:14] in the name right it's a are you can
[1:27:17] either take the mark or the name or the
[1:27:21] number of his name what's the number of
[1:27:22] thing but Karis filling day it means a
[1:27:25] God's vicar that's what it means that I
[1:27:27] did the Google translation if you go to
[1:27:29] Google translation if you type in
[1:27:31] mccarren spill a day that's what it
[1:27:32] means the vicar I think it's victor of
[1:27:34] God's if they're not mistaken so if you
[1:27:36] just trusted the name of the Pope that's
[1:27:38] why you watch the Pope brother Madison
[1:27:39] watched a purple curtain yes he said von
[1:27:41] scheele Russia he's these things but
[1:27:43] later he says watch the purple curtain
[1:27:45] he said that's your enemy that's what
[1:27:46] you got to fight his man-made
[1:27:48] denominations and religion amen glory so
[1:27:53] don't we don't confess in the mark which
[1:27:56] is number the well the mark is later on
[1:28:00] a verse 18 or we don't confess the name
[1:28:02] of the beast or the number of his name
[1:28:04] all right role in the Holy Roman
[1:28:07] Catholic Church and all that nonsense
[1:28:08] and things like that I'm not bashing
[1:28:09] them like a priest a son and I'm not
[1:28:11] name calling I'm just saying I'm talk
[1:28:13] about the spirit behind it to bring with
[1:28:15] me the spear behind it remember brother
[1:28:16] man had his complexes any name called
[1:28:18] Ricky Turkish I'm not I'm not name
[1:28:21] calling the people I'm just saying
[1:28:22] that's the system all right now verse 18
[1:28:25] here is wisdom let him that hath
[1:28:27] understanding count the number of the
[1:28:29] beast for his number of a man and his
[1:28:32] number is 603 score and six that's the
[1:28:35] number 666 which that's where we get if
[1:28:37] you take the vicarious be like day into
[1:28:39] the Roman numerals on then you get 666
[1:28:43] alright alright last thing i want to say
[1:28:45] here um let's see let's go to Revelation
[1:28:50] 18 relation 18 for
[1:29:02] relation 18 4 and I heard another voice
[1:29:04] from heaven saying come out of her my
[1:29:06] people that ye be not partakers of her
[1:29:08] sins that you receive not of her plagues
[1:29:10] for sins have reached unto heaven and
[1:29:12] God hath remembered her iniquities
[1:29:14] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[1:29:17] double unto her double quarter her works
[1:29:18] in the cup of have failed sort of
[1:29:21] filled fill to her double yeah we should
[1:29:24] have filled filled to her double how
[1:29:27] much she have glorified herself and
[1:29:29] lived deliciously see church guy live a
[1:29:31] humble life the spirit of the Roman
[1:29:33] Catholic churches to live a real relaxed
[1:29:35] rich kind of life that's why we'd all
[1:29:37] riches we want spiritual riches not
[1:29:39] natural juice remember there's one great
[1:29:41] gain in Christianity where remember that
[1:29:44] great gate is its godliness with
[1:29:46] contentment Paul said his great game are
[1:29:50] you content tonight with the things you
[1:29:51] have are you living a godly life if you
[1:29:54] can you can achieve great things in
[1:29:56] Christ if you live godly and I'll
[1:29:59] content with things that you have not
[1:30:02] covetous or greedy or gain for other
[1:30:04] things like that so much torment and
[1:30:07] sorrow give her for she say that her
[1:30:09] heart I sit a queen and no Widow and
[1:30:11] shall see no sorrow crazy a let's stay
[1:30:13] in our feet to that by God's grace you
[1:30:19] see that voice in verse 4 saying come
[1:30:20] out of her my people see that voice
[1:30:23] program said that was the voice of the
[1:30:25] seventh angel come out of her my people
[1:30:28] as you be not partakers of her sins and
[1:30:31] plagues and receive not of her plagues
[1:30:34] that's why we said that on this tight
[1:30:36] and right with last Sunday night serving
[1:30:37] about name column we don't name-call got
[1:30:40] to a brother man don't call then Ricky
[1:30:41] Ricky and ricotta because I've got

[1:30:51] names the names are written in heaven
[1:30:52] praise the Lord he knows everything we
[1:30:54] don't know it so we shouldn't name call

[1:31:00] to come out of any denominational spear
[1:31:02] even amongst us as we preach this
[1:31:04] morning how many want the real freedom
[1:31:05] of the Holy Ghost in the church us my
