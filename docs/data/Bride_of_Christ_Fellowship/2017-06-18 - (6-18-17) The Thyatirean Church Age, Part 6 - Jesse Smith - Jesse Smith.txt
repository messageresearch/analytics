parks it or really Wednesday March 7 or may people feel that to do another thought but forget part 6 here the school in relation to 22 I do want to wish all the fathers happy Father's Day praise the Lord he kind of forgot about that but happy Father's Day 12 apotres increases our relation to 22 last week I got to preach about mothers and fathers so that was kind of our My Father's Day message I just use that that Sunday with that strong mail last week strong father strong leader of the home and also a submissive wife what did that last weekend of course the false churches have the dominating female spirit you don't have that here we have the Holy Spirit and that's what's dominating us is a nice fear he strings us out he empowers us he delivers us he heals us he gives us grace to stand revelation 2:20 - we'll probably get down to verse 26 but we'll just going to read verse 22 start there I think it will just be best to save time we have the fellowship today I just want to conserve time revelation 2:20 - let's read just that verse together ready one two three behold I will cast her into a bed and that neck commit adultery with her to Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds such as Howard prayer if you eat on your hearts they can go to God that's just right Heavenly Father we love how great you are Lord oh we look in to your holiness and we worship you dear God you are the master of the wind Lord all these songs here on our hearts and minds we know the master of the wind we're grateful to know you Lord the fact that you humbled yourself so that we could know you you're how great you are Lord that's what makes you so great is your humility lord help us to be humble this morning Lord God help us to try to let your greatness live through us by being humble nor in looking to the Word of God or Direction father we just give you honor and praise and need every need we again ask you touch the Walker children thank you for the faithful prayers Lord Jesus and any other need were not aware of Laura for you minutes for those needs of us to be set if the Holy Spirit this morning that's the father is Lord they can occur though the hours they've invested in the lives of their children Lord and then their wives their families Lord how they labor less them or let them be more sensitive to the Holy Spirit that need Lord at each of the leaders of the holman mark as the leader of the church let me be sensitive more sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit let me hear your still small voice Lord God we love you Lord minister now to us by thy spirit as only you can do in Jesus Christ's name and I bet you'd be in more willing we'll look at part six here today that's grace maokai whenever you're anybody we can switch you over here got some quotes you know to go through hope you're enjoying it if you are enjoying it it means you would have enjoyed it in nineteen sixty when it was preached praise God and I'm not enjoying it you probably not enjoyed it at night to the 60 minute was preached so we really enjoy brother branham said I could have preached fifty sermons on each church age and he just hit the highlights one night so that means there's probably forty nine left and I preached seven or eight of those so you know without more than that but God bless you let's look at this church age which is still looking at the tire tear in church age by the grace of Lord mesengeros Columba and this is a number though this is the the time that comma live a member if you get your horse riders from the seven seals in here the anointings of the the Antichrist yet the white horse rider black horse rider wrote about right here I'm sorry red horse rider wrote about right here to right here and then from here on to a little bit right there is where we're at right now but the Dark Horse or the black horse rider because it started off with white deception of false teaching and then from ready to killing his church and state are united and then it went to black which is a Dark Age the darkest age of persecution and capturing the wealth from the world as he had his pair of balances in his hands and we saw Wednesday those those beasts and those horse riders aren't just interpretations they're thus saith the Lord so we're very thankful to have those by the grace of God now remember the importance of this series on the church age please don't forget this the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist fear would come into the church and defile it making a lukewarm formal powerless so Satan is not trying to get you to be cold singing just trying to get you to be lukewarm right you say amen to that that's always trying to do is just try to make the church the church church lukewarm right with your salt Wednesday every denomination milligrams that we'll take the mark of the beast the save the Lord so on Wednesday night I reached out to somebody denomination never heard back from them that's okay it's on my heart to do it and I reached out and felt led of the Holy Spirit to do that give them a warning but they never got back to me that's five because it's off my heart phrase when I would I gave as a person i ministered to many many times I just got a burden to get expressed that I said are you going to come out of your denomination now are there any signs of revival and so forth yeah thus saith the Lord but no reply that's all right perhaps they're busy I don't know but I know what I could do I've reached out and that's what I'm called to do so we got to keep from becoming lukewarm the book of Revelation exposes Satan unveiling his works his attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he's tested like a fire he fights that he cannot stand that he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she'll be invincible army if they got a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her that's the purpose of all the sermons on the book of Revelation that's what Ron Graham said is so you and I can have a revelation in other words an unveiling unban okay this is the true spirit and this is the false fear and then discern that and then withstand it cuz sometimes Church we know what sin is but we still fall into it right so if you morally just unveil it all that scent but we've got to overcome that by God's grace amen we've got to catch that down we've got to overcome that by the grace of the Lord that's the whole purpose of these so don't ever try to let yourself get maybe tired of the church ages are tired of the seals it meant so much God had to sent a prophet to give it to us and that we can withstand and understand I'll get this to the church spirit this is a false spirit and I hope that's what you've been able to see through Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira up to this point I hope that's what you've been able to see the true spirit of the church at the pulse spirit and I believe every family and every individual if you look through your lives this will help you these sermons will help you to see are you at your first love it's taking cooling you off are you doing already doing all the works are increasing your works for God where are you at in this you see how you can apply every word of God to your life well Graham says the church Facebook we are such a blessed people that at any moment in our lives we can see where we stand with God we know where we stand through the three works of grace through you know the stature perfect man here now the church ages gives us another view of that we can see where we said where are we are we going through an accurate time of great persecution where we act and we want to find ourselves in the love of God now wherever we are we have power to overcome midnight if we're in a little water state in faretta or wherever we are we've got power to come out of it and that so if we get that if we can understand the true spirit at the false spirit will definitely for Satan today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them you say then to that see the Christian life is prevailing and then keeping that prevailing over sin you've got the once overcome it and then you've got to keep prevailing over that's what the word coat means we look at that at the end of the service the word coat Co be the Radisson we must have we have to coat with all our trials and that means to keep the battle going that's what Kofi st. ahem if I'm coping with this hardship I'm keeping the battle going that that hasn't defeated me but I'm able to cope with it I'm going able to have success over I'm able to get the victory over amen that's what the word coat means and we only do that by the Holy Spirit that's why if we go to anything else to code to find coping a comfort will be disappointed will keep falling back into the city we've got to go to Christ for he is our hope hope has a name peace has a name love has a name and that Dave is Jesus Christ amen it has a day it's Jesus Christ and he is the word of God glory now let's go through this and working my way towards like I said verse 20 26 I'm working my way there we're skating the highlights like I said because some of these things I've already preached on like Wednesday we preach living on Jezebel and that was a great message for me because that's what I lied to decide to get baptized amen got baptized right after that law that's a great time in my life for that quite vividly now we finish Wednesday night by showing how Jezebel had daughters that's what we close with and we showed how this was even a great point brother branham brought up even said we even yelled whoa when he breached in 1960 said did you catch that the mother Roman got the church has daughters in other words denominations that came we know that we end with that and we showed how Jezebel's literal daughter married into Judah Judah had been going good for a long time then many numerous godly kings but once that marriage took place once the daughters married into Judah it was all downhill after that Jew didn't last much longer after that and that's a beautiful type of warning I should say beautiful type of warning to us not to marry to any organization and the organizational spirit member just comes in real innocent right oh do you have to keep doing that Trump to keep doing that oh it's okay if we do a little bit this the worldliness and it pretty much comes in and then when people fail to move on with the holy spirit and they've already denominated you have to write anymore bylaws we can keep our bylaws and everybody had a chance to read through a couple years ago everybody had a chance to read those bylaws those bylaws don't contradict God's Word that's fine but listen if we don't keep the Spirit of God here which means humility and repentance and obedience then the Holy Spirit will leave us and we don't have to write bylaws because we've already denominated because that's the works ain't trying to make us cold formal powerless we've got to have power over sin right we don't have to write over the bylaws that's just that's a later that's a later fruit of what's already having in people's lives when they don't want anymore of god so god help us have the spiritual law in our hearts a man that will keep us hungry two thirsting after God a bad Lord that's right so brother now goes into the punishment of these daughters and the mother so the Roman Catholic Church and all dumb denominations even if they're not officially denominations anyone who limits the Holy Spirit what will be the punishment the heart and her children well it's going to be twofold mercy said on caster Nevada Court in the last part of verse 22 it's a better tribulation of Great Tribulation that's exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 we know the parable of the ten virgins remember they were locked out of foolish virgins weren't locked out of the wedding they couldn't go in now that scripture doesn't say weeping and gnashing of teeth but the other parable Matthew that Matthew does let's go to that let's go back through 20 to 25 just says they're sad you know that they're not in the they're not the wedding you know they're trying to get in but both a pair will speak of a wedding and people missing out on a wedding so in Matthew 22 the chapter begins with this story it's 2:20 to 1 to 14 remember the foolish virgins story just today say Lord Lord open to us he said I know you not so the door going to be open to the marriage supper right and you said just watch therefore you don't have to dare it out but in Matthew 22 verses 1 is 14 you have a parable of the great the King making a supper for a son his wedding and number they send out three messengers and so for like that but at the end somebody got into there without a garment on and they treated respectfully they call it a friend the King comes in the king now look at this I love this type member this type of adverse 2011 I purchased up two years ago I did the King comes in one last time before they start the wedding I like that because the king is going to come into his bride one more time before the wedding hallelujah and he's going to pull out anything that doesn't please God anyone who doesn't have a wedding garment anyone who's not baptized with the Holy Ghost the King what am I talking about a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost was going to visit the fight one more time hallelujah Loran accosted the latter rain he's going to visit one more time than all those who are born again we'll have to leave the gathering of the bride it's a worldwide Universal Katherine it's a gathering in heavenly places amen it's exactly right and verse 11 the King comes in one more time there's I believe that's the latter rain I think that's the part of the third pole for the bride verse 12 he says friend how K misses her image that are not having a wedding garment he said he was speechless he said nothing he was speechless now verse 13 then the king said the servant I have handed foot and taken away has some in outer darkness nursery weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen see that some of the foolish version are going to hang around the bride for a while but when the King comes into the last time when that really filling of the Holy Ghost comes the foolish virgins still put it on they still put they'll see the move of God and they'll be content just to be church members rather than have Christ that being Christ members amen glory we say like that we want to be Christ's members more than just church members you should be a church member but you need to be a christ members and that's how the rebel said that's how Satan the highest he said there's tactic was to reject the holy spirit that is this daughter and her her mother their tactic is to deny the Holy Spirit yet remain church members and we'll get to that a bit of the message they got the court of the earth message that's been attracted and the only weapon they have is argument they just want to argue about this that rather need humble brothers if you watch the Holy Spirit when the person's really got the Holy Ghost when the word comes to them they submit to it obey it they don't want to argue about it they submit to it and obey God bless this church for obey the Holy Spirit man it's a real privilege to be a pastor of a church like this that will be sweet and humble and all my interactions with every even never that's remained and stay true to God's Word they've been so submissive to the Holy Spirit thank God for that even last Sunday was a nice little example there in our office just to see someone so submissive to the Holy Spirit we appreciated that but Ransa the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that's what will happen to all who did not go up in the rapture that is what will come upon the harlot and her children in dollars that's the first fold the first fold of being an organization is a tribulation the second he said it will kill them with death as the literal translation says let them he put the death with them he said that's a strange saying death itself is the cause of their death - taken so here was Jezebel with her pegan ISM which Minos Romek on the church over there's Judah properly worshiping God and living under the word so Jezebel marries her daughter to jail Ram the minute that happens jom causes the people to become idolaters the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead spiritual death came in the minute that first her to Rome organized and was dead see the minute Whitchurch will organize and say no more leadership with a Holy Spirit no more leadership boy sure can't take us any further we're content we don't want to go any further with God the man that happens that's that's it that means no revival right know more about it that's all that's the spirit of organization I'm not going any further with the Lord brother Jesse you're preaching cannot move any further well I'll let you go my preaching can't move anybody but if the Holy Ghost you get a hold on that we'll move somebody amen right but if you've crucified some people that's what the Bible says they crucified the effects of the Holy Spirit they will obey God any further that can't be taught anything new they can't learn anything about God they can't grow the grace of knowledge of God we must be humble disciples of Christ amen and I'm not talking denomination I'm talking about a humble learner because that's what a disciple is someone who can learn the Word of God I just so I just so you know Church of S is for years but I'm still practice I'm praying to God to help us to learn to come to church early and pray before services appreciate that I know it's not something you can turn on like a light bulb I know that you have to plan ahead you have to learn discipline the church said and that you have to learn that that's one of my prayers now Church if we can't learn that what are we learning praise the Lord or if you just can't do it then I need to make the decision is OK than once we'll start a prayer service at 11:00 right and I will pray for 20 minutes half hour wherever we feel that to do but see that's the reason program says that the Holy Spirit don't move people will sacrifice time for God it's not by money that the Holy Ghost moves it's my time like Daniel they said oh we're going to kill Dan we Ricola magicians magicians because Nebuchadnezzar in a dream yeah I said just give me one with it give me time don't give me money don't get me necklaces don't get me gold silver just give me time and God will give the revelation that's what every child of God needs just more time with God and I upgrade your hand I know that's what you need to we all need that I need that we all need more time with God I didn't that's why we appreciate the time that we have together the minute the Lutheran's organized that came in they died the Pentecostals came along last and they organized the spirit left go they don't believe it look at that they still don't believe the skirt them but he did that marriage brought death and see that's what I wanted to stop there I can say that the spirit hasn't left us but I could be deceived any church could do that you can say oh I still got the spirit on my desk but you could be to see because all the churches today say they have the Holy Spirit moving among them and this in church they might in justification but most of them have no sanctification there may be if you have the solids out there that got a little bit of segregation but most the Pentecost but I've been do it I visit last year in my home church that was racing but they have no sanctification it's dog-eat-dog is you never you won't just come to church and scream and shout and get in the spirit and somebody's seeking tons or somebody doing a word or prophecy or so if I got that I just seen it last year I was out Virginia that's all it's all they desire they won't pee up their lives it won't obey the Word of God but we are interested in obeying the Word of God and what you obey proves the Spirit is with you if you obey all the word the spirits with you if you're holding back then you've back sit on the Holy Spirit and you might just be saying this goods with you don't give your own God if you're child of God God will continue to stay with you I'm talking about this organization is denominated people to nominate their lives they sent offenses and we said we can go no further in Christ we're not going to give any more effort we're not going to give any more service to God where I can make any more sacrifices this is as far as I go brother Jesse this is all I want out of my church experience and this is what we should say this is this is what we want to have our church experience all the Word of God and whoever God leads us hallelujah he's leading us into heart dedication right here I'll be getting ahead of myself and all the reservist for the message now here's what he does he says I want to he puts he puts revelation 13 the whole chapter he injects into the church age book it takes up about two pages he puts the whole chapter in there because he said I want to show you organization what's going to happen through it I'm just going to go this briefly his last fought preached a whole sermon on the whole book of Revelation 13 I preached a whole sermon showed all the symbols and I'll put it on YouTube pretty soon by God's grace well my man said this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic Church and what she will do through organization remember this is the false life let it name the name of Lord does so only in a lot its headship is not the Lord but of Satan and finally ends up completely identified with the Beast the horatii of the starlit beast distinctly shows her power is the god of for Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ now in 1317 so this is a beast chapter this is this is the America chapter this is a verse about America because America begins in 1311 and goes to the end in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control over the Commerce of the earth her no man can by herself part from her this is born out of Revelation 18 9 through 17 which shows her involvement with kiddies the other rolling down the churches of all the kings these merchants all who have to do with Rome and commerce in revelation 13:14 we learned the Beast spreads his influence through the image which was no print that image that is made as a worldwide Academical Council where to all the organized churches will get together with the Roman Catholics they're doing it up it is white us for this union will come in order to stop the power of communism oh brother lays with autumn here this temptation is going to be very lucrative if you don't join with the Catholics that you're really not fighting against Isis or you're not fighting against Iran or North Korea if you don't join with us and you're really not fighting against two or three and other nuclear missiles you see how you're not really fighting against this you're not really a Christian you drop fighting Isis or whatever this in whatever the enemy is at the ends but I said it might be I mean ISM it might be you see how what a temptation is or you should take a bigger stand on Facebook or you should write more about this or you should you should do more your church brother Jesse take up a cassette the only one I'm standing with is Jesus Christ a hat I will not stand with false churches and denominations and the daughters of Jezebel I will love individuals in those churches but those churches are daughters of the is that right and those churches will never repent they'll never change their bylaws I'm not standing with them understand with Christ I'm saying come over my people that you be not partakers of her sins in her plague say then that's what I'm doing that's what you and I should do as well that's right and anybody that don't understand that is not reading the message deep enough or not reading the Bible deep enough my brother couldn't when I when I have a condemned the Catholic Church under the condemn that I'm not talking about individuals it's the sphere behind that and any spirit that would get mad at that is not the Spirit of God that's exactly right because look how the Bible condemns that over and over and over and over that's the trailer surfer right it started a servant and then it changed form and now it's the spirit of Jezebel now it's a Mystery Babylon now Babylon as a woman is that right who's the dominating female she dominates over all their lives but the word is what dominates us amen it's exactly right see how it's going to be such a temptation they're going to control your money they're going to freeze my bank account they're going to freeze this if you don't join in with that well the rabbit says we might see a little bit that temptation he says but before that Christ will come and raptures brought out the earth exactly right then brother man I'm not going to go through this program with legs Oh a few paragraphs about this I preached on that very thoroughly especially on Sunday nights I preached through daddy I'll preach that thoroughly I learned Daniel 11 like for next week Lord willing I'm going to skip down to here we bender that it's the same beast that came out of the sea it's the same dragon that tries to devour that woman with the Sun overhead that was Israel right you got the 12 stars 12 tribes of Israel now verse 8 this is 13 a revelation 13:8 speaking of this is the Holy Roman Empire unholy war thrown in fire and all the 12 long years all whose names are not written a book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation world shall worship Him thank God I just thought I put this in here so we can thank God a little bit during service okay thank God the sheet cannot worship but I pursued everyone but the very life would be to see but they will not be to see for they hear the Shepherd's voice and they follow we just have to look at all those names or another book of life will worship the Pope and her daughters yeah the mother in regards they'll be deceived by that the shirt you gave us a leash you're a Buddhist virgin but actually let's press up into the wise version a name cause it basically is I just kind of pray off and get the oil a day that's right right you're guaranteed that because if you will not worship that system you're already guaranteed to be able sergeant let's just go a little higher Christ a man and I just want to go higher I want to go higher Oh more Friday and I pray this numerous tiny last few months God if I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've given to me but I'm keeping this because this is coming this far and this is better than anything I've ever experienced before I'm keeping this until something else comes in here now my daily walk what I tell us say hi so say I'm born again I'm baptized with the Holy Ghost I'm filled with all he goes P side and follow me amen that's what I said but before God I say God if I don't have what I professed that then I know you'll bring it because I'm asking parting and hallelujah it's exactly right like I told you whatever I can heal myself the Holy Spirit get somebody to believe me now moves on the scene it's like with any true gift of God now I'm going to see this that when we've been trying to show you this seed of death to start in the first stage the seed of organization has finally grown into the tree in which every foul bird is lodged I want to skip that remember this I preached this last year programs and services at the end time preach to 12 Bible mysteries remember that 1200 mysteries the first mysteries the kingdom of heaven creases parallel mysteries so brother Branham said that the Satan's Spirit is white horse rider that was like a seat and it grew up is like a mustard seed and it grew up to the end of the church age we're at right now right and now Satan seed is grown up now and now we're seeing the fruits of denomination praise God now we've seen the fruits of the mother harlot and her daughter's we're seeing the fruits but its total compromise it's going to church but not obeying the Word of God that's what it is they've added their fruits of unbelief fruits of disobedience remember the Bible said uh that Hosea said he told Israel he said you've eaten the fruit of lies remember that just like the fruit of the garden eating something teaching on sufferance eat I got I got this on my mind here I'm gonna make a video and does it be done now I'm just going to end it but the fruit they partook of was the fruit of adultery it started off as a seed in ease mind Oh surely you won't die and that seed rapidly grew until they partook of the fruit of adultery that's what it is every saint tries to attack every person to play see I believe a seed of doubt a seed of some type of CID and if they obey that we saw that that luck versus lust then gloves conceives and thats it now has life in their life and then it brings for sin or unbelief and then it brings forth death hallelujah see that's what's happening that's rappin to people's lives that's one of the mysteries this foolish can't see that right uh the daughters of Jezebel can't see that but the bride sees it a man the children of God see you hallelujah they understand the mysteries of God exactly right Church hmm Kingdom of Heaven the second one is the New Testament body of Jews and Gentiles third is the church as the Bride of Christ in Ephesians 5 this was a features 2 and 3 and Romans 11 I have all the scriptures like I said I've got priest I actually saved a sermon on YouTube so it's on YouTube that's going to watch it I would watch TV Scott I was blessed by verse 4 now the fourth mystery isn't catching up or rapture of the church the fifth one is the will of God the six mystery is the mystery of godliness which I believe to be the stature Birdman morongo net the set of the mysteries of seven stars and golden candlesticks in the hand of Christ I've got the candlestick Sunday number eight the mystery of the Godhead got the father in Christ in flash in chapter 2 pursuit many of the mystery of iniquity in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 then you got Mystery Babylon the revelation 17 then you have the finest of Israel romans 11 and the mystery of christ in you which is Colossians chapter 1 a bit of the Lord over the Bible said the mystery of God would be finished at the end time and all 12 Bible mysteries have been revealed to us by God's prophet 8 I know you were living in the days of the prophecy of the prophets amen the fulfillment of all the properties we're living in that day that's the one right there state lights to get if you can just get a little different yellow see that's what the book of Revelation does it helps you discern by obeying the holy spirit for the spirit of iniquity if you're real born again think of God you're able to discern and withstand the spirits and walking obedience to the word amen I didn't idiot I ain't had it thank you Jesus now the seven parable mystery the one we just read brother Graham brings out was number three the grain of mustard seed now I believe there's a dual interpretation of that I believe faith is like a mustard seed I believe that but when brother Branham preaches it here and he preaches it also in the 1960 sermon Thyatira he uses this as an example of sin if you plant a little sin seed as small as a mustard seed it will grow up and then you have every bird and birds represent demon powers and demon spirits and habits right evil spirit habits if you let a little iniquity grow and grow and grow pretty soon the person still with sinful acts it's exactly right amen but of course faith is the same weight you plant faith in your heart and don't dig it up what are you going to save my family or not or God am I going to go on the rapture that or God gonna do this or that matter see don't give it up believe God's Word let it grow and it will grow into a great blessing amen so the 7 parables of the four grounds four kinds of states my best revelation 20:2 he that's holy holy still he that's righteous righteous still he that's filthy filthy still he's got unholy son holy still we're gonna come to our still spot at some point we're going to still be holy we're going to seal the righteous I would be holy church hey man that's the only times will come to a standstill said the rapture you know that that's the only time you'll come to up a stand those out of the rapture because he that's holy will be holy still amen now that reminds me of this church go to Ezekiel 46 9 this was not in my power point but it was in my reading this week when I was reading here at the church z-bo 46 not I've been preaching this over and over rather church age through quotes or other grab I never realized how scripture was and I think this is a little nugget forests on the Holy Spirit I notice it up you from the host group DQ o 46:9 you know the officer sometimes you're a zq oh I'm having a hard time reading through there some of the chapters 237 I get roadside about the dry bones and in chapter 9 goes at side private abomination if you're real excited about some of those some of them a little bit tough to understand exactly zq only exactly as he saying but as I was reading chapter 46 this week the first time now this is the worship of the prince and the people of course I think in this case Christ is the prince I'm not mistaken the look at verse 9 church what have I been saying what I've even read from quotes about brother Branham about church attendance right maybe a faithful the house of God have been say and we've been reading those quotes where the Bible or romance that you can't you can't leave the same way you came in and that's what we're talking about organization people can nominate and still come to church and they're not getting closer to God well how is that scriptural right here's where the type is I want to go under we're so tired of this how can we not leave the same way now if you know this chapter it's about a feast day God is giving the zekiel thus saith the LORD on how to organize the feasts with all these tubes coming in and having their feast and sacrifice and coming into the outer core and holy or not one is just outer core now look at verse 9 I was Lee this is view but one of the people the land shall come before the Lord and the solemn feast I know st. Paul said that word a feast right now I mean know that that's the first finish chapter 6 we're keeping the feasts right now and holiness and something since they are t let me know that remove enough read that nothing to it you might read a let's read verse 9 no first I don't know you know we're in a feast right now every that's why every service is so important I'm keeping the feasts that Christ commanded me to keep a because I know it's important because all feasts are important it's a time you shut out yourself from the world and focus on the Lord Jesus nice when you char come before Lord of Southeast he the entereth by the way of the north gate to worse shall go out the way of the south gate but he that entered by the way the south gate should go born by the way in the north gate he should not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go forth over against it and the church said there is two waves hallelujah amen there's two ways to come into the outer for either the north case or the South's game but God commanded he said he'll tell Israel Ezekiel go save the Lord whatever way you come in you're not going out that same way oh yeah amen you can't come in and out the same way the church says Amen don't let the word we don't Calvin to his church just a little nugget brothers telling them I'm shining up and showing the people you cannot come in hey boss the same way we're going to coming better or worse my desire is if I'm telling the south let me go north they let me go hired Christ does he go out the north wind up going northward brother ever saying man it is really crossed over land had to go northward amen so we seen we must we cannot come in and go out the same way you can't say well I left Church just the same condition I was when I came to know you did it you either started back siding more you grew closer to Christ is that right but we have some when you go to church it's your chance to express yourself you down or show God how much you love him that's why you come to church and my man said also to stay under the anointing and the pouring out before the ghost that's why you come you like that little you know the Nugget there what a beautiful time you get on down it's a feast day now let me show you the feast maybe you know that first for the n6 let's go there we're keeping a feast you say well we're not having special services well just every service is a specialist tray that's a revelation of our church gets to amen that's what we want to grow into every service is a special service it's another chance for the Holy Spirit to clean us out and draw closer to you now remember I'm sorry chapter five Saints forgive me I'm sorry it's chapter five verses 1 to 6 and 7 deal with this a brother of the church ease of brothers who use that times but never said he was only go spill but he was having fornication with his stepmother so of course then she would been commit adultery but he was committing fornication so both committing whoredoms which is any unlawful sex rectum now verse says purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen where did I feel like I'm missing the scripture that I read over so fast I missed it no there is I'm sorry yeah we're selling yeah for even Christ our Passover sacrifice for us so we're at a feast praise the God we're serving the Lord and our peace must be kept with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth hallelujah so you say well protest that Ezekiel asks about Old Testament feast but the Bible said we're in a feast and you cannot leave the same way you came you got to get closer to God yeah how do that agree with the Word of God if you can't understand this though this isn't the case but if this is so deep you counters in it just say Amen to what you know I really don't think I'm at D but make up too fast Dave that's not maybe that's not air in life you know forgive me Lord for that but then just say lord help me to agree with everything I can help me to feast on everything I can here I know that you know this because ripping apart little steak feast and giving a Victoria just real slog the rest of my children I'm sorry this roast it wasn't steak more aggressive I'm sure they can just take a big huge hunk and I can take a big huge hunk about what I can hand a lot of heavy meat but the baby it just makes you learn your own stand on the first just a little bit and church whatever you can handle enjoy it by God's grace don't spit it out enjoy it don't feel about why can't eat as much as that person I can't shout like that person I get anything like that one don't be discouraged just enjoy whatever you can handle they then just keep feeding on the things of God that's exactly right we can tears grain of mustard seed let it hit the three measures realize that Roman Catholic woman cooking up those three Trinity persons there and give it out to the people feed it to the people are that deceptive woman the treasure in the field Christ the pro great price Christ the net has to see how my dad gave different interpretation some time consent Christ sometimes you said the church was the probate process do such you know there's there's a few different quotes on that in other words Christ wanted to get his bride out of the whole world but it's also a type of one Christ a net program said one day I would see the Pearl great price you said that baptism and Holy Ghost all right now I'm gonna do it on time I got about 22 minutes I'm going to preach an hour I think I'm doing good I think I'm doing good okay okay so let's go to the final warning this is a section of the church age book going against Authority and again if you aren't reading the book luckily I plead with you read the book read the book you'll go closer to God right away that's the next book we're going to read in our family after we finish the Bible we did the we the what's it called the family altar with Tim Tim Dodd you did both those books for a while then we just ran into different devotional books and now we're almost through the whole Bible we read all the New Testament chapter in Psalms right now okay and then once we finish the Old Testament will be done after that more willing we're going to read the church age books our family's devotional every night so I want my children know that that's how Jim fruit was raised Jim Crow is race is my rather than church age book every morning he's a real man of God so I know that this thing that's real powerful trying to they then it'll take effective public believer that's right now verse 23 and I'll cure of German death you preach off that all the churches should know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but ever said God looketh on the heart that has never changed neither will never change here as though all the ages there are two groups both proclaiming their revelation from God and the relationships you go so program code 2nd Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth show or having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his the Lord searches the reigns the word search means to track and follow up you like how the Holy Spirit does that the Holy Spirit will track your life what was this right and then don't maybe you follow let me go let me follow but see if that was the right decision I made back there that's what the word search means to track it to write it down and go back and follow up was that the right decision God tracks down our thoughts which are called the reins and the scripture range means thoughts God track sounds our thoughts was I thinking the right thing he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us I remember last two Wednesdays about for each of them I know that works and in the bow member that lives over here I know that works your works the very things you do or don't do for God is the manifestation what's inside of me works if I save you but you do it in a grant and an act of gratitude toward God amen you want to do something for God it's exactly right like you know I was raised in denominations like I tell you this you know all the time of raising the dalmatian church yeah they had a lot of ungodly standards but I am still thankful for all the prayers they paid for my poor family we had look at sit we probably a 10 or 15 bucket 5 gallon buckets at our house growing up that would catch the rainwater and maybe they'd be orange by the Lord they're just full of rain you're melting snow we were really poor but this church this denominational Church this I say like this this daughter of a harlot this church had such tightness they would pay to fix art or to turn our heat and water backbone you see because it's not the people it's the organization that's the harlot there's good people in there right right but if the system and they're under the influence of that system I'm very thankful for that but it's left me such gratitude the last time I visit there some others day prime ops eight years ago by now five years ago and I miss it there one time I get all the Sunday night after preaching the camp I drove up an hour and a half and went to the sin the night service that there might be over there I was so thankful for these people and how they prayed for me and even though the woman said she said thus saith the Lord serpent seed of the devil though she said that I still have grace in my heart for because uh I just said like just there God forgive them they don't know what they're doing I just say that God have mercy all blasting and God knew he was ignorant God in mercy on so my prayers God have mercy on that bless that's just way I approach that but I was so thankful I just I was overflowing with love not these are people that prayed for me these are people that treated me right and never abused me they never hurt me that and all these years of teaching me in Sunday school you know coming to my games and and paying for Wendy's meals after church on Sunday you know they would just treat us so good I just had all my I went to Walmart and I bought a fifty dollar gift card for Outback I think and a bunch of flowers I took them over the pastor's house and I said thank you now and they are their owners when I walk in every girl I know pop I believe the message now you know I know Oh Jesse's had just a goatee and then really they're really kind of shaded give me a hundred of my head my eyes go give the pastor up god bless you Pastor he's I just want to give you this take you write it out - nice to meet I just want to thank you for praying for me all those years thank you for preaching to me I still remember when he got anointed he jumped so high his feet were like this high of the air like he did one of these where he jumps up at his feet come up and he was so annoying for the Holy Spirit God would move and it was a great atmosphere enjoy the atmosphere there many times many times I want to repent give my heart to God who doesn't love the Spirit of God who doesn't love to see the Spirit of God moving Church be loving to see the Spirit of God boo and then I went to give the flowers to his wife and she could hurt my heart already look me in the eye but there was something to get you I'm just going to brush it off a little bit and thank you note but there was something inside of me and this is what we're saying the works you do or don't do show what's in your heart praise the Lord whatever you do or don't do you can show gratitude if you can't show Thanksgiving if you can't show these things that something's wrong with your heart the works show it's in your heart a net and I could do that to someone who blasting the message why because I love them I'm not looking at their sin I'm looking at my love for them which I believe is the manifestation of Christ's love in me you see that by God's grace I don't what let me to say that but I just want to say that your works are definite add a station of what lies within us so if you don't if you don't pray for the poor you might not know anybody for that need you you might want to give alms I'm not going to ask you raise your hands now I'm sure some of you want to give alms I'm sure some of you want to do other works but you need to pray it's a God show me someone that I can do almost for because those will be a memorial in heaven how many want to store riches in heaven you don't raise your hand but how many want to store which is have well the Bible said Cornelius did that by giving alms and prayers praise God and if you don't do that something's wrong with your heart if you don't pray that God show me somebody for I prayed that last Wednesday and I preached on that I know that works and additive order I said and I prayed actually God showed me somebody for I can give alms to and I turn on Facebook at home later and and somebody went my friend said I really need a money right now I could use some work so I said the text he didn't respond to me one day two days I kept Exxon's I want to do so I wouldn't I would help out the par and the reason I've done this because nothing came out of it I finally got a hobby so thanks for the message I said can we bring you over groceries can we do some steel help you out he said no I just got our check from the government we're okay and I said as far as work and you do you want to become your landscaping at my house I'll pay you to work and he said I'll give that John that and you never got back to the three on that church so what I'm letting you know is that we want to do good works I'm afraid I'm pleading with God show me somebody that's hurting show me somebody that I leave me to help somebody than the people I find don't want to help so what can I do keep waiting upon the Lord so you and I we're not doing these works if we're not praying like we ought to if we're not getting all those I could giving the poor people like we ought to something wrong with our hearts we just searched a gospel for that how many can say men today I'm just giving examples because there's no rewards I didn't do anything but God knows I prayed for it I'm literally praying on my knees your Lord show me some I want to do something for that kingdom of my eyes to be open so sometimes our eyes all we see as are our needs all we see is our lives instead of seeing having eyes and compassion seeing the needs of others riding it God's eyes it is out of the heart that proceeds either righteousness or wickedness our motives so why did we do that why do we do our what we do our purpose what's the purpose behind this all that are known unto him as he watches every action as a pastor I very thankful for that that God knows the motives I don't know people smartest we try to help you try the preaching right all these things I don't know that I don't know the motives but God does and God knows my vote if Amen God knows our motive is just to do the will of God and he watches every action we do aren't you glad at every action everywhere shall be brought to judgment when the accounting part lives is given there was no fear of God before the false fine and dearly shall they paid look at that there's no fear of God they didn't fear God they just did things and someone's upset that it's okay I love God I go to church the false find doesn't fear God we should have the fear of God in our lives now let all who name is named so let us become a Saints we might not we might fool the people but we will never fool the Lord so see if you want to fool people and don't let the truth be known that sounds like a foolish virgin to me or works right we don't we want to fool anybody because a real Christian is so close to God they feel the conviction when it happens that's right and I want to inject this in here this is from a different part of the church age but I already preached this chapter knowing true believer is any stronger and spiritual healthy and alive I don't want to be alive I would be healthy I don't be strong in Christ here's how you do it then your knowledge of and here's to the pure Word of God in other words you have to be learning how's he learning more about the word reminder the word and then you have to obey the Word of God you'll never be a strong you never be as healthy you never be more alive than your adherence to obey the word and learning more about the Word of God as seen by multiple examples that Old Testament gives the examples of Kings like Solomon David all those kings Abraham Jacob Isaac you both Rob so he must know the word if I go to church and you must obey the Word of God when you're not in church but obey it when you're in church - grace guy I know that works if a man fears that he might not believe he's got anybody ever battle that I doubt that often I'm just a real nervous person I'm my own worst critic sometimes I think I'm doing an awful job as a passion and Kevin's wife emailed me on Monday saying brother Jesse we just love you as a pastor we love what you're doing I said well thank the Lord I really urge because I really battle sometimes I did anything good I know I am again we go through battles praise the Lord and God knows that if you fear you're not pleasing God then let him fulfill the Word of God let him obey if a man wonders and I get to hear those words well done good and faithful servant then let him fulfill the word of God his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise remember the parable if God gives you one talent invest that talent God gives you three invest that tell you find five invest that town find what God blesses your life and give everything you have in hand hey man hallelujah I'm just giving ahead now this is back to our church eh and then I'm almost done yeah almost done he's overcometh and keepeth got us back to verse now this is the verse 26 I mean Fisher I'm there that's you yeah I skipped a little bit I skipped 24 that's what that's okay I'm going to skip to 25 because this thought of works came up this thought of works and this is something we can all relate to women then grandpa or grandma children all of us can relate to this because we all do works every day praise God like with my children my children related because their works are abated mommy and daddy praise God that's all they have to do they just have to obey let the children what honor their mother and father that's the main object of their life is to honor me and my wife adults we got more works that we can do praise the Lord Jesus says he's overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end so his words so we have to find God's will and do God's works in our lives it is very evident from the remarks of the Spirit on works that the Lord is trying to get his own people to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentioned words that you catch that in this church age four times he mentioned your works what you do for God right what are we doing for God verse 19 I know that works instead I works we see that my the other ones real quick yeah verse 23 I'll give everyone a coordinator works and then in verse 26 he don't come in the keepeth my works to the end he keeps mentioning works because we got to add works work should flow out of a life that loves Christ man they should just flow out praise God amen I love my wife is my pleasure to help her out I love to help out my wife I love to call the pizza shop when I don't know my wife can't cook I love to do that or what's more realistic is I love to do spaghetti when my wife don't want to come that's more of what I can do a little bit easier or make eggs or something like that I love you - that's not a burger that because I love my wife and if you love Christ let the Jews work four times Christ mentions works and now he says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully into the end will be given power over nations and will be a strong capable unbending ruler ëletís this is what you'll be Church if you can do keep working for God everyone work for God if you keep working for Christ on there but not Christ works not your works Christ's words if you keep doing that Christ will give you power over the nation's and be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation isn't that beautiful that even the most desperate editing will be broken if need be goodness numbers God wants you to so obey the Holy Spirit that he doesn't have to give you an e bus for disobeying anything right look I've got a Phoebus for disobeying the Holy Spirit right over now in South Africa he should have said hey Todd I believe it was not mistaken er but I just listened to it on the we listened to that our band uh God had to give amoebas because he kind of bent he bent a little bit let the ministers have their schedule but he should have took the schedule the Holy Spirit amen how many of you taking the schedule the Holy Spirit it's more motion are you coming to church you don't have the schedule now the other half is receiving the word amen now just company that's half the battle they got to that but the next part is leaving out a different way that you came in a fear of God doing the works of God that's a real Christian amen so we have to learn to that now be so unbending in other words nothing is good movie brother Kevin off my convictions of the Holy Spirit but I had nothing to get a movie off this word that I know to be true to keep my family in the faith and keep myself in the bait nothing's going to move me I'll be so unbending the devil has no power over me amen and if we have that this lecture CH surely will have the next life but make us rulers over nations now let me show you the word cope can I just show you the word cope just a minute I thought I had on here well there's our page by the way see this is my this is my missionary work right now I got we have thirteen hundred eighty subscribers almost a 150,000 views that's my missionary work right now the brothers asked me to go overseas I said I can't go right now I said I got to stay home with my wife for a few more years that I'll be back on the mission field by the grace of God the word code where was it yeah here's the word coat the bird we're trying to be able to cope with the situation to cope means to maintain and contest or combat usually on even terms or with success that's what we want to be don't want to even fight with the devil I want to beat the devil hey sister I want to beat the devil out and I would have put him under my feet because the Bible says that Romans 16 we can put Satan under our feet amen and that means you obey the Word of God exactly right Satan's under my feet I'm really over him he's not tempting me to do what I don't want to do I'm telling him what to do exactly right get behind me Satan so seem to eat coke Christ is only going to let people rule who can cope right now if you can't cope with problems right now I get a coke as a ruler in the New Jerusalem in the Millennium I can be a ruler there I get a ruler relations if you can't rule right now that's right and then deal with and attempt to overcome for other difficulties learning to cope with the demands of the schedule right learning to cope with the demands of labor seeing how many are Co fait with success how many but how many want to cope with success by God's grace amen absolutely that's what see that's what Christ wants and your works will help you do that we can't cope unless we're doing the right works of God obeying everything to the letter and that's not legal is remember that's love because Jesus obeyed every word that wasn't legalism that was love when we cope with the situation we have we have power in every situation his demonstration of rule by power will be like under the very Sutton's Christ this is very amazing it might not have animations here now but hope it is or mad I hope it is now by God's grace this is amazing brother Branham says what's so amazing about it we have people who are more concerned with God's works than their own works and they do not bend to any temptation to get for Satan to get them off the Word of God brother Mannis said that's very amazing when you can find somebody who won't Bend upon the word and that how many of you want to comment how many want to be one of those people amen how to be one of those people a state of our feet I got one more quote here I just heard this week on our last week on this in two respects 1961 our brother Graham quote this preach it a few years ago why didn't I look conversation about it well Graham in the message respects he said over to Cleese II ask you the 12th chapter let us hear the conclusion this is part of his text I don't remember that fear God and keep his commands but this is the whole duty of man so program takes us Old Testament Scriptures said that's still to do you man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you cannot have respect until you have fear you've got to have the fear of God Solomon said in the Proverbs that the fear of God is beginning wisdom now that don't mean you're afraid of it but that means that you're giving him respects and the reference and when you respect God you fear God hey man you fear that you might displease him in some way and so you love to see what motivates that love love you love God so much and you fear his Lord I don't want to I don't want to hurt you you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to now look at this church let me say like this I fear God but I also fear all of you remember manse is the same thing you should fear everyone else perhaps that I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church so I fear I come when I see I see you guys we saw him to BOA Thursday night at Summit mall you didn't see us we saw you what is that what does that do when you see Christians out it brings a little bit of fear hope or deliver I want to be pure I want to love God I want them to see it out of the example right my right church that's my gathering is so powerful we learn to love and fear one another see because you're just a walking image of Christ so are you so is everyone you're a walking vessel you're a temple of Christ so when when you see another temple of price Oh it brings a real reverence and I love that 11 I come into some of these when we need some of some of the brothers I love when I come to the friends I can tell them and pray it I can tell them and set in their Bible because there's just the presence there I thought it's a reverence I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling-block some somehow somewhere in their way I hear the people I fear the people the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you before you can have respects you've got to have fear but after this is the whole duty of men and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respects let me appreciate that by God's grace and see if we're not working for God it's because we don't fear God we missed the whole a whole conclusion of the matter is to fear God and seek keep the commands obedience praise God the star heads how many say brother Jesse Crain for me help you don't bay the word more help my works to glorify Christ God bless my hands up to Heavenly Father what a wonderful word we've heard this morning pure God I love you chances I think about Lord though as we started with the mother and her children Lord I think about that I was in those I was in those daughter churches for so many years I was raised in him Lord then when I got saved in nineteen I remained in him for two more years all's I knew was daughters of Jezebel in there there was a few that I felt so inspired by lord thank you for their lives and their testimonies and Lord my works didn't match the Word of God when I come to this message though I've been able to see the Holy Spirit show me the two spirits in the framework of the church lord help us to withstand that evil spirit dear God and help us Lord to cope with the trials of life by adhering to the Word of God not by disobeying or thinking lightly of the word but by obeying the word and fearing you and keeping your command that's the whole duty that's the whole conclusion of our lives dear God brother Jesse our Lord O Lord some people might say brother Jesse what's the will of God for my life you can start off by Lord we can start off by doing I can tell them this fear God keep every command you know and Lord as we keep every command Lord God surely will begin walking into the perfect god the permissive will Lord we know is outside the word it's a clear disobedience to the word but the perfect will is full of beatings Lord I'm a man that wants to hear well done good and faithful servant so Lord as I leave out of here I'm going to leave a different way I'm going to leave closer to Christ I'm going to leave more enthused about Christ I'm not going to go out the same way I came in my works are going to continue to glorify you I'm going
