tonight but the children asked to do some studies in the future so uh children come up with some topics okay because i'm kind of sometimes i just forget about it and i don't think about to the last minute so i'm not prepared for it so you think one haven charis you think of one okay nature virtue if you think of a topic let me know i'll be happy to address that in the future but i just want to preach a little short little message i know i'm short you might laugh but um i'll try to keep it short by god's grace but let's go uh uh back to the vision scripture we'll look at the vision so proverbs here look a little another sermon on vision we looked at that last week and didn't quite i didn't finish it because i just want to share a few more thoughts so basically proverbs 29 18. i don't think you'll hear anything maybe new tonight um about vision i just kind of want to rehearse uh what our vision should be as we grow individually uh we should grow together right and then we should uh grow around the world we should grow believers around the world it'll be a small number right but we still have to go to every nation and make disciples of every nation so um lord willing as this coveted thing blows over hopefully there won't be any uh massive variants right brothers there's supposed to be some bearings oh my goodness we got the blood of jesus thank god we have the blood of jesus i don't fear these things anymore you know we didn't know at the beginning and the devil kind of uh put some fear maybe into me and maybe others i don't know i know i was scared at first but um by god's grace now we know there's no weapon that's formed against us that shall prosper amen praise god and if i die from the variant i'm in the presence of jesus right don't feel bad for me i don't want to die but the thing is we can't live in fear we got to have a vision for the future praise god so proverbs 29 18. i on okay yeah on all right um i just want to say thank you for your support this morning and for praying uh and pulling on the word you know just want to encourage you brother mj was here at 9 00 a.m this morning it came two hours and thank you brother bang for opening the church buddy thank you he was here praying two hours before service so i said brother i said that had a lot to do with it you know i had brothers you know jose and william and people tell me oh we really enjoyed that message this morning i did too but uh it wasn't for me it was from the lord but also a lot of that has as is the effect of prayer my brother mj was telling me yesterday i'm so excited for service you were telling me i'm so excited for a service you know that's what we got to do without it keep our enthusiasm even for tonight let's be enthused praise god as long as you can right you know we all get tired i understand that well we're growing together we're growing in love together we're raising our children our families together we got another child on the way so very thankful for that great news uh we just want to grow together in christ jesus you know he's gonna he's gonna help us to fall more in love with him love each other more by god's grace so proverbs 29 18. let's look at this thought here tonight i got a few things to show after this uh slide just a few scriptures i'd like to reiterate here tonight i like to preach on where there is a vision the people prosper part two so let's look at this here let's read this on three one two three where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he now let's have one more word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's make it known to god here heavenly father we just gather again in the mighty name of jesus we thank you for such a wonderful worship service tonight we will carry on for the good of the lord and the thrill of his glory it's a thrill when the holy ghost comes in here and moves upon us and blesses us heals our sick strengthens us give us courage hallelujah helps us to repent leads us in ways of righteousness lord it's a thrill to be a christian every time we hear of a testimony it's a thrill lord so thank you for the thrill of amen's testimonies and jose's testimony father we're just thrilled by your mercy and your love jesus may we fall more in love with you and that by doing that lord will love one another more help us to grow together and grow individually god for your glory give us clarity on our vision in the word and bless us and strengthen us in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you should be in seed i'll set the timer here for 45 minutes let's see if we can do that all things are possible all things are possible so the lord bless you richly and just one again say we thank the lord for everybody being here and appreciate you pressing out your way to the house of god tonight and i just kind of want to rehearse a little bit about you can pull up the slides here uh just a little bit about our vision um i know i've said it over the years and at some point i want to do that i want to put joel 2 23 through 26 up here some someday and put our vision uh but i'll work on that at some point you know i still want to work on some other things first uh but that's our desire our desire is to see uh the prophecy god has spoken about has come to pass okay that's what we desire because nothing's gonna happen except what's already been said in the word that's that's why i love it peter peter didn't have to guess on the day of pentecost he said this is that which joel spoke of and i imagine we'll say the same thing right before the rapture right because it's in joel right it's in the same chapter joel 2 the beginning of the bride and the ending of the bride is in joel chapter two it's amazing it's just an amazing uh prophecy from the prophet joel so uh you know that's what we're moving towards uh this time of restoration right this time of uh restoration of the word of the anointing of all god's promises you know and we're just we're we're growing into that you know i i'm very thankful you know you know uh we every church goes through seasons right but we're in a real season of victory right now i mean look god just healed johnny you know god just blessed your family your family now i mean look you know god just provided everything you know we're in a real season of victory god has given us rest from our enemies praise god as far as like major battles right we've had some major battles over the years with individuals that come against us but god has given us major victories so uh we're we're very thankful to be in the season here and i just want to look again you know last time we looked last week we looked at the vision prophetically where we are uh and i'll just rehearse that i'll just go quickly over that real quick so i can see it again uh we're at the uh end of daniel's image there the feet of daniel where iron and clay are together but not totally mixed together protestant catholic uh right at the feet of that image we're also the prophetic feast of weeks uh right we're at the lat which is the final wheat harvest right before they go into the seventh month or the feast of trumpets where the two prophets come and call israel together we're right there at the end of the harvest and we're also at the end of the seven church ages right we're at 115 years in this church age right and some people think it'll be the shortest it could be if it is we don't have long to the rapture i'll tell you that which that would be that'd be a blessing but if it tarries let's be thankful anyway praise god let's have enough endurance where we can last even if it uh tarries longer we will by the grace of the lord uh so then we ended we ended by looking at the dynamics so the latter rain will be just a refilling of the holy ghost it'll be a time of complete consecration brother ramsey will be an easy thing so just like it was easy when you first got filled with the holy ghost i remember when you two got the holy ghost we i mean my wife and i just talked about it for weeks like wow they're such different people you know they're they're really on fire really dedicated really you know so that was a so that as easy as that was for you guys as we saw in their lives in each one of our lives when we when we believe we got the holy ghost that's what the rapture will be like that same joy that same stimulation that same excitement that same reverence right that same hunger and thirst for god that's what it'll be like praise god for all the bride it'll be a refilling of the holy ghost uh and he said uh that we've worked in a small measure and that interesting we've just worked in the small measure uh but the the full measure will come down as the headstone comes down christ jesus now here's the scripture if you've got your bibles like i said i got now i got thir or 41 minutes left so i'll try to just try to stay with this here i can as much as i can so i want to just bring out just a few simple thoughts here and i think they'll be a blessing to you now the first one you don't you don't have any for that one but uh go to that one go to acts 2 42 and then while you're going there i'll read this so in the upcoming book i just have a section on in chapter 6 about the the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory i show how tongues are not the evidence of the holy ghost right thank god there were tongues we thank god there still are but we show how not all speak with tongues now right right after that section i show how there's other evidences jesus said the holy ghost would do in your life right so we know there's there's one experience of being born again but it produces all these fruits of the holy spirit right all these uh characteristics we have as born again believers okay so for the first one i have let's see i'm three four five six i have seven other characteristics uh so you have to have an emotional experience like the day of pentecost right a seeing hear experience then you have to have love for other christians because john 13 35 says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have loved one to another amen now we just had mj tell amen and i out in the hallway he just said out there before he left he said i wouldn't be where i am without your love for the amen and my love and i thought wow look i mean he's only been here what three weeks and he's already felt so much love he knows he wouldn't be where he was now if it wasn't for just our love just our stopping to talk to him right you know because we've had that opportunity not everybody's had that opportunity but we've had that opportunity and he can feel our love right he can feel the love that we all have as for him as a christian i thought that's a great testimony because that's what real christians are that's our vision to love people right to show everybody that we're jesus's disciples because we love everybody praise god also supernatural signs and wonders mark 16 verse 17 and 18 these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover praise god that's a sign of a christian amen thank god for those signs brother branham calls that the keystone of the of the church like a foundation of the church it's a necessary part to have the power of the holy ghost flowing through the church praise god thank god for that he does that next is remembering jesus's word so if you're born again you'll remember the words of christ john 14 26 the holy ghost shall bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you okay so if you're born again when you need the word god will send the word he'll make you remember the word you might not have thought about it but god will send you the word to help you remember at the right time next testifying about and glorifying jesus in john 15 26 and 16 14 he said the spirit of truth shall testify of me and he shall glorify me so if you're born again you will testify of christ hallelujah and then he shall glorify christ as well amen hallelujah that's our testimony bragging on jesus amen being convicted of and overcoming sin john 16 8 says he will reprove the world of sin when he comes the holy ghost so the fact that you get convicted of your sin is proof you're born again but then also overcoming sin for first john 5 4 says for who whosoever is i'm sorry for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world amen see we've got to be one of those overcomers in the laodicean church age overcome and will sit with him in his throne praise god amen next number six will no future events and god has given to uh us to that through brother branham john 16 13 the spirit of truth will show you things to come somebody say like this we now from my understanding we know the fourth vision's coming driving the scars we knew that was coming right a state of undress i believe a greater state of undress is coming that's just me because i believe they got to be fulfilled in order i could be wrong but that's what i believe right and then what was the sixth one the sixth one was oh the powerful woman that could be the roman catholic church right or it could be a woman in power that the nation has to bow to that woman this this nation hasn't bowed to kamala harris as much as people want to say it they haven't bowed to her as far as that's my opinion i don't believe so but there will come a woman uh she'll they'll bow to that woman okay i believe it's the catholic church uh now and then the seventh is the destruction of america we won't be here for that one there's no way there's no way uh we are kept from the wrath of god because we are the children of god and we kept the word of his patience and last number seven will listen to and believe the human messenger sent to preach during their lifetimes because john 17 20 and 21 say neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one so the fact that you believe brother branham the fact that you recognize the fivefold minister ministry today that's further proof you're born again amen amen hallelujah how can you say you love jesus and deny the stars burning in his hand you can't you can't be born again and deny the very burning light right the burning light of those seven stars in the hand of god ah thank you lord amen all right now you got your bibles acts 2 42. let's read that now here church here's see we're growing individually in those seven things right we're loving each other uh we're getting remembrance from the holy ghost we're listening to the word of god we're knowing future events we're being convicted we're overcoming so we're we're growing individually but we've also got to grow together okay now as an encouragement you know and i've said this before and i'm not downing other churches who don't have two services on sunday i'm just saying we're trying to we're we're actively trying to do our part to gather more as we see that day approaching right we're actively trying to do that by gathering twice on sunday most churches don't do that in america so we want to do that uh and then we want to have fellowships you know like we did last summer and we want to keep like we did last week we want to have fellowships like that uh and when guest preachers come you know if they're traveling from far distance i try to do a friday saturday or sunday whatever we can squeeze out of our schedules we try to make a little extra sacrifice okay but look at the book of acts church uh 2 verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine of fellowship and breaking in bread and in prayers okay and fear came upon every soul and many signs and wonders were done by the apostles and all that belief were together and had all things in common now i always remember when sister naomi told me that when she read that and she was so blessed by that being in the bible and that's how and that's one of the areas we have to grow together we have to be sensitive to each other's needs and if somebody needs a car let's help them out right we've done that before so praise god bless you your tithes have paid for that car i got for austin remember that because he needed a car to get to work in the church see uh there's other people i'm not gonna name but we've helped out right uh with with larger amounts of money because we should have all things in common everybody have food shelter clothing transportation if you've got if i got something you should have it too right that's a real christian family and if not then we're kind of like hypocrites right and we can we're not pointing fingers but we can see other churches how they're hypocritical by not following what this church had because whatever the church had we should have because we got the same spirit praise god right we got the same holy ghost the same water baptism the same love we have all the same holy spirit all these things we should have the same thing praise god amen that's right i believe that uh verse 45 they sold their possessions and goods and part of them to all men every man had need so if there's any needs church then i need to know if you know in need of someone who's a faithful tithe pair here i need to know if i'm not aware of it so you keep letting me know that way we keep we keep growing in this book of acts church because we are a book of acts church but we can grow in it so we've got to grow together right we're already growing individually we see that we've got to grow together as well we have to have the same care i have to have the same care for vang's family that i do for mine right if not i'm a hypocrite because this church had the same care they would sell can you imagine selling your house so you could take that money and then spread it out to everybody in the church can you imagine doing that i can't but i mean i i'm thankful they did thankful we thankful we haven't had to do that right we're thankful we had them do that um now they must have owned their houses because none of us really probably own our house right we're loaning it we're getting a loan from the bank to have it but this is the kind of love they had and if this is the original love there's only one kind of love and we got to have that same love okay uh now verse 246 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat was with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord out of the church daily such as should be saved because that's where we you know they met daily and that course didn't mean everybody in one gathering but they just met daily with each other so we want to make sure we try to increase our gatherings together amen it's going to be a challenge i was talking with brother amen maybe we can do like you know this is just an idea but maybe we can do supper like at vang's house what not he has work but we have to maybe do lunch or something you know we have to one night a couple weeks later have supper at naomi's house so we all bring food or something uh because if if they were constantly together then we need to get together constantly now it's a challenge because we all got children we all got work schedules but we can pray too we can pray if we really want to be together we can pray praise god which we should be doing right because we should gather more and because it's a bible command we should gather more as we see that day approaching okay that's we'll get to in a little bit that's actually the next one so see whatever this church had at the beginning we've got to duplicate it and we will because we have the same holy spirit praise god okay so see that that's our blueprint that's fresh after the church was born minutes days after the holy ghost fell and they were born again this is what this is what they did so we should do the same thing amen uh let me just say this you know when we first came in the message like my wife and i john lisa that's how we were we were always every weekend we're at each other's houses i mean during the week we lived so close to each other it was it was really nice we're actually for a couple of years we were just right down the street uh from john and lisa we're constantly over there together it was a real you know just really great times in the lord you know before we drive the lima sometimes we'd sleep at john's house remember that hunting it wasn't always easy you know just being in a different bed you know it's harder being a different bed so there were some rough times you know but we're just always together always together three hours there bang we would just drive there listen to music and talk and drive back that night you know just repeat it week in week out for a year and a half you know just always together um and that that's that's what god wants god wants his family growing together okay hebrews 10 24. let's look at that one i'm going to pull it up here because there's some greek words i want to look at real quick hebrews 10 24. yeah okay uh 10 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works now that means to this actually means to irritate right now we take that as a negative word but irritation right can be a good thing like with pearls right the pearl pearls are made through irritation right that's an ear that's a dirt irritation that gets in the oyster right and so it builds that pearl over time but so we should consider one another to irritate unto love and to good works in other words encourage them unto good works right if i irritate you forgive me i don't want to irritate you i want to be a blessing to you okay i don't want to irritate you sometimes i can't control myself so i scream and shout and cry and spit you know i i don't mean to irritate you but sometimes i just can't control it that's how it comes out like today about lost my breath i was so happy in the lord and so thankful for his mercy and his grace i just i just don't know how to control it contain it but see we we have to can look at one another and some i'll just use my brother bank i have to consider brother bang and how can i uh encourage him unto love and good works how can i be such a brother that would make him want to love and do good works how can i live in such a life where i can amen can look at my life and he'll want to be more holy and he'll want to be more like christ you know that that's that's what we have to do we have to consider others and how can we encourage them how can we uh not not how can we provoke them how can i help them to be a better christian right verse 25 here's how we do it not forsaking the summings of ourselves together as the manner of some is see there are some christians that they don't gather together more but exhorting one another now exhorting means to uh comfort it means to to call to address to speak to to admonish to beseech uh to console to strengthen okay to instruct to teach to comfort and courage okay so basically speak an encouraging way to someone and so much the more as you see the day approaching so see church uh if we're away from each other we can't encourage each other in the in the lord like i i like a text from brother amen but i like seeing him more right i like getting texts from mother vein but i sure like hugging him a lot more than that and just getting a text you know i like to hug you know i like to hug the saints and the brothers you know and there's so much more effect you can have on someone in their presence okay that's why we must assemble together more right no matter what the devil tells me when i'm about my mind battles when i get the presence of the lord and we experience the joy and the blessing of the lord we overcome all those bad all those mind battles just fade away praise god the music casts them out praise god right the music casts all those nine battles out then we don't worry about it anymore and you know we're all clean and we're all clear refreshed and everything but see when we gather together we consider how can i encourage the saints and how can i strengthen them and the bible said so much the more as you see that day approaching it's okay so it's it's it's commanded for us to get together more okay and so we've got to find a way to do that all right so just pray about that that's our vision our vision is find more ways to be together right find more ways to how can i grow to be a better christian right grow how can i grow that's my vision i'm gonna grow uh in my in my walk with the lord right i'm going to love more i'm going to do all these things jesus told me the lord's going to bring more scriptures to my remembrance praise god i'm going to love all the saints more i'm going to love other people more we're going to grow together now proverbs 27 17. this is iron sharpens iron now tell you that's really strange that they used iron because iron is always likened unto rome you know so i was thinking about that i don't quite have the revelation on that but as iron sharpeneth iron sorry i typed in the wrong thing and now it's taking me a long time to get there partner what was it 17 oh 27 oh sorry oh yeah sorry okay that's i saw talking about mj today too you know he's like wow he was just saying what the blessing the service was and i'm like brother that's why the house of god is so important a christian sharpens a christian right you're going to be a sharper christian by coming to the house of god and i hope it happens during the song service and the preaching and then i hope it happens in the parking lot or in the hallway iron sharpens iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend okay so the countenance is the face or the person the presence and the word sharpen means to make alert makes you more keen or wise okay so a wise person will make another wise person more wise right we make each other more wise by being together we make each other more keen to the enemy's attacks okay that's what we get we become more alert right he told us to watch and pray so the more we're together the more we'll be ready for us coming amen hallelujah we're more alert for the coming of the lord because i see brother bang living for the coming of the lord i see brother amen i see our sisters living for the coming lord we're all living for the coming of the lord it refocuses our sights and our focus on the things of god that's our vision is to be sharpened right uh to be more alert for the coming of the lord we sharpen one another praise god that's how we grow together we gather together more physically we try to think about how can we encourage one another and then how can i make my brother my sister more wise in the things of god right that's we want to sharpen each other make us more alert for the coming of the lord all right and then we grow the world revelation 10 8-11 this is what we know simon would do and brother jason demars brothers that do missionary work and i haven't talked to simon we're gonna have him preach out here then i can ask him so i just i keep forgetting i mean i can easily send him a text i can call him he's my brother i just keep forgetting uh revelation 10 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spaking to me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the seventh angel i'm sorry the hand of the angel i'm sorry which stand upon the scene upon the earth that's christ and i went to the angel and said give me the little book and he said to me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nation tongues and kings so we take the open book god has loosed the seals this is the book that was sealed with seven seals he loosed it in heaven brought it down to earth we've got to eat it it's got to become a part of us right it's got to become a part of the missionaries too and they've got to prophesy again before peoples nations tongues and kings what a commission i don't know how we're going to see kings i don't know how kings are going to hear this message but the bible said we've got to prophesy the kings okay that's got to be natural too this has got to be natural peoples natural tongues natural kings and nations okay god will do it god will take care of that just like god allow brother brandon to meet all those kings right that was all god's doing there's no way brother that's what brother adam told the angel how can i do this i got a 7th grade education i don't have any money and the lord said i'm going to give you signs i'm going to give you these two signs praise god amen and god did it god brought to pass for his glory okay now i'm gonna i'm gonna come back to that last scripture of course uh but remember this church remember i showed you this years ago here's all the here's our church and remember i showed you this a few years ago you guys remember this every now and then i'd like to break this out to kind of remind us so here's here's the nearest churches there's sheffield it's 63 miles north uh albion that's a johnny and then we're gonna head back there that's 112. now look at all these look at all this all these people all these souls in here dying lost going to hell or maybe foolish versions look at all these souls wholesale i preached there a couple times camden too this is uh southern pennsylvania there's a church there uh columbus now there's a couple of churches there that kind of get older or broken up um i'm not sure the state of those right now mansfield there's a church that's that's when brother aaron used to go to now he don't go there anymore but there's still a little gathering there in mansfield 65 miles and that's and that's where uh stephen now drives from he so he drives 130 miles every time he comes to church appreciate that sacrifice and so then here now here we are and i put all the green dots where there's message churches so no wonder jesus said the harvest is plenty but the laborers are few amen now jesus don't expect us to go down to every door right and knock on every door he don't expect us to do that but he expects us to pray for laborers he said pray that the son of man will send laborers into the harvest so we've got some of these boys raising up brother bang maokai zion we need some preachers and we'll see if the lord does it you know we'll see i'm no pressure guys no question i feel bad for brothers sometimes there's all that pressure to preach you know and you too brother amen bang no pressure brothers but you know as the as we pray the lord will raise up ones to go and remember the lord will only send them if he knows somebody is over there to receive it like remember he went to the maniac of gadara he sailed all the way across the ocean the sea just to save that guy and then he left and went back amen jesus went down to that uh samaria found one woman that samaritan woman at the well saved her soul priest of the city and then he left he said i need to go by samaria praise god amen in other words jesus will send us wherever he needs us to go like he sent me to chipotle with my jesus head on the fine brother mj there right right see he just he sends us wherever we need to go right a little bible study at a little college house with brother bang and devon like he'll just send us wherever we need to go but i'm just letting you know there's all this space in here and as i've told you i feel burdened this scripture says we must prophesy again amen we must tell them again what's going to come what's come is there america getting a revival no sir but there is a bride's revival praise god because it's in the word of god we must eat the open book the book is now open eat the open book and know the prophecy for this day amen all right now i'm going to go back here because i want to read this quote there are quotes where brother branham says their culture brotherham says the bride hasn't had revival yet but he's talking about the latter rain but there's other quotes like this uh you know 11 months before he died where he said the revival is going on right now it's the revival of his message but god rich of mercy has pulled us out of that chaos talking about denominations and let us see it before the thing hits here rich in his mercy send us back a revival divine healing and the coming again of the power of god according to history no revival ever lasted over three years this revival carried for 15 years it's been a burning fires around and around the world why because we deserved it god rich in mercy not because we desired it or because we deserved it rather just think what it's done so see brother abraham before he dies you know he's already telling you the revival is here there is one more latter rain revival to come but the revival divine healing the power of god the opening of the seals that's going on right now and that's the revival that's hit our church amen it brought you out of your denominations and brought you out of cma right it brought you out of there brought me out of the chapel and brought us out of pentecostalism and brought us to this revival amen the revival of the word of god the full truth restored to the church and that's what this book that's why i brought it out just if you ever want to look at it you can borrow it if you want but i put post-it notes where even the writers who wrote this book let's see what was it what year was this i think it was 1988 let me check so they wrote this pentecost so yeah 1988 so this is when my mom was healed of cancer they wrote this book they looked at the history of the pentecostal revival and all this pages so after world war ii brother branham's ministry started the revival and he said it's now affected every church in main street usa so any church in the usa that has a healing it's because of god's prophet amen hallelujah any church that's got the power of god or divine healing it's because god fulfilled revelation 10 7 amen hallelujah praise god the seals are open the mysteries of god are revealed the truth is now available as being prophesied to every nation kindred tongue in people oh thank god so see you got to balance out all those quotes people say the rival the bride hasn't been revived yet i don't know about you i've been revived i've been totally revived i was dead in denominations i'm revived i'm alive amen my eyes are open praise god it's daytime i've got the armor of god on i know exactly what's going on praise god hallelujah the holy ghost is trying to save souls in this feast of weeks this pentecostal fakes it's gleaning time hallelujah and that's what brother man tells us he said it's lamp trimming time matthew 25 it's malachi 4 time matthew malachi chapter 4. it's uniting time i'm not sure what scripture that was the move is on the bride that's a quote walking with god it's enoch's time to walk our enoch type to walk with god laying in the presence of the sun that's matthew 13 right he'll harvest out the wheat separate the wheat from the tares and then it's time for the preparing of the third pole or ladder rain he calls it a shaving down time it's all these time it's the time of all these revivals all these moves of god all described in different ways but all rolled up into one we're looking for the coming we're being prepared the bride has made herself ready for the return of christ amen hallelujah so go to joel 223 then we'll go back to this here i like that picture it just encourages me so mj lives in canton see just so just just use your imagination for a little bit he moves he lives in ken let's say some of his family gets saved you can start a little church down there right and now look then the church if the lord willing a church would pop up there you never know right you never know what's going to happen so you got to be open to that i mean there was two brothers in calgary falls we thought were going to come you remember greg smith and keith king do you remember those guys we had two guys at that mo drive church i thought for sure they lived in calgary falls i thought they were going to come the message they received everything brother they received the godhead everything william branham until the serpent seed they just couldn't get the serpent seat i'm like brothers they thought because they were so caught up on the nephilim the nephilim were fallen demons that married women i'm like demons can't marry demons can't press in the flesh you know they but you know so we were so close i mean we've been so close to having so many souls come in but then the word comes they don't like it and they draw back but just think just think you know if all these souls that we witnessed to over the years you know it's a it's been a blessing but i'm just saying you know god can do things very quickly right god raised up a church in akron there was no church before here we're an answer to stephen's prayers right stephen alexander's prayers he prayed for a church 10 years before we got here so we're an answer to his prayers now there's a message church in akron praise god okay so joel 2 23 just again this is our vision we don't want to forget it it's prophecy you and i are going to fall into this prophecy we believe it all the years that the the church has lost from pentecost it's going to be restored it's going to be restored with a unity of faith verse 23 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately that's the teaching reign brother ramsey's ministry and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month or as it was at the first so if you look at the hebrew that can also mean as it did at the beginning in other words we're at the same holy ghost power that got the beginning and the floor shall be full of wheat now i like to emphasize this we should have lots of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil so wheat represents food wine and oil wine is the stimulation the joy and the oils the baptism of the holy ghost so overflowing imagine a church overflowing with joy we're almost there right we've got great services overflowing with joy haven't we praise god i know i have amen hallelujah services overflowing with joy overflowing with people filled with the holy ghost overflowing with word like wow that was amazing word i'm full on the word of god amen this is the this is the prophecy like brother william told me after service he's like wow he's like wow he said look at the word of god that came this morning he said and notice brother brown never even preached those things he said that's god getting in the that's the holy spirit getting into his word and bringing out further revelation from the word that's what brother williams said and he's been around the message for 40 years see you don't have to always say brother and said brother i'm saying that's good for sometimes when you need to know what a prophet said but once you move on you can move on from some of those things and go into more of the word of god things maybe brother ram didn't mention but everything you bring out will line up already with what the prophet said as it lines up with the word there'll be no contradiction same spirit but brother said it's not different revelation same revelation more information hallelujah same revelation more information he teaches that in the church age book as well okay this is what god is going to restore he wants to restore this and like i'll say like brother brandon said we've experienced this in a measure in a small measure right we've experienced a third pole in a small measure some of you have spoken to things and it happened right look at bang lane laying that prayer cloth on his dad two days later the power of god comes into place you know jose and i spoke to those women who couldn't have have children just spoke the word yeah i spoke the word too with your dad you know all those times we can think of all the testimonies see we worked it in a small measure but the bible said we're going to overflow with these things oh won't it be a time won't it be a time and see i i'm pressing towards that right we're believing that's going to come to pass we don't know when but we're believing that's going to come to pass verse 25 and i'll restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you that's the demon powers right all the things they've eaten away god is going to restore back that includes fellowship praise god right like gathering more as we see that day approaching right gathering together being together sharpening the saints praise god the gifts of the holy spirit are in there brother man teaches on that in the uh the restoration of the bride tree sermon the four bugs right the four insects same insect four different stages and they they ate away the fellowship the gifts and there's two two more things i can't think of right now but i'll think of it hopefully later i'll preach it later so god's going to restore back all those things the gifts fellowship all the promises of god verse 26 and you shall eat them plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that had dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed so we have boldness coming this this former rain and latterly latter rain will produce boldness and satisfaction amen we so satisfied in the house of god and with each other praise god right and we will praise the name of god amen this will be a church that praises god hallelujah worships god gives him glory because he's been so wonderful to you oh thank you jesus bye hmm yeah i came early and prayed with mj too i got here about 9 30. so i was up here praying and uh i was i spent that first maybe 30 minutes just praising god i was weeping and crying and snotting and it just flowing like a faucet but i was just i was just so thankful just to get to church and praise god for all the things he'd done when i remembered one of the things that happened i was at the library yesterday i was thanking god i just i stopped in the library and i just raised my hand i thank god because i was i was sitting by zion here on this little they have like a little uh like a toy bus right it's like a big bus i think the girls know what i'm talking about you're on the bus okay remember zion was sitting by me on the bus he was crawling off head first and he was falling off and i didn't even see it i turned and looked and instantly my hand went like that faster than i've never moved that fast in my life and i caught him like this and his head was down here and i just had my hand on his back and he was just like he was just like pinned there by the just by the grace of god he would have fell right on his head it's concrete floor they would have been screaming crying all these things and it was just like that brother instant instant and i was like oh my goodness i and i just raised my hands right there in the library and now they're usually quiet in there but you would have heard me yesterday you'd heard me saying thank you jesus thank you god i know the angels of god were with me because if you ask my wife i'm not that way like when kids fall i'm just kind of like but yesterday it was just the lord it was just the lord i mean i look instantly and and usually i'm not that strong right to hold a child like that i just like pinned him down against the the seat and half his body his head's down here and his legs are up here yeah just it was instant and that's not me that that's not my characteristics i'm not really a quick responder like that but i just had to stop and thank god uh because i see his hand in mercy otherwise what am i saying he's been wonderful to me how could i not praise him how can i how could i not praise my god amen he's been so good to me yes i just remember that was one of the things from yesterday okay so see god is building up a church who will never be ashamed a bold church that loves the word of god that will be satisfied with the word of god that will praise and worship amen hallelujah that's what we got here amen we got praise and worship praise god hallelujah and we want to overflow with wheat wine and oil thank god and god will restore all the things the church has lost god will restore it back i believe he's doing that i believe he's doing that i can see it praise god all you gotta do church is go to denominational church that's all you gotta do or just be around denominational people watch how they act watch how they treat each other we've got real love here we've got mercy forgiveness correction you know kindness you name it we got it you just got to be around other people for a while and you'll see you'll be really thankful lord thank you for giving us a wonderful church family okay now i'm gonna try to bring this down to close i got uh oh yeah six minutes let's play that now i'm just i'm just bringing these quotes out for more outreach okay these are same quotes i had i've shared them a couple years ago but the brand says do you realize the responsibility of this city of tempe here so let's change it to akron the city of akron i believe is resting upon your shoulders so we have a responsibility to save souls in akron right i believe that god has made you lighthouses each one of you you you have the responsibility of the sins of the city it's resting upon ministers upon the church people the pilgrims as we're journey journeying through don't you believe that what you're not afraid surely you're not afraid to take god's word god keeps his word god is not a god to say that he's one thing and then another if he promises anything then that he will do god keeps his word do you believe that okay so just think about the book of acts now church if all if the responsibility of sinners is on our shoulders what they do in the book of acts they just they they did outreach right but they kept all the sin out of their church and then the lord added daily such as would be saved so we got to keep gathering together more right keeping ourselves pure strengthening one another and then god will add to the church as he sees fit but at the same time we can pray at your seat or this altar and ask god to forgive the city of its sins and forgive our loved ones we can ask god to forgive this city of all their abominations now we know we know uh not everybody will receive it but brother mj was even telling us the member today he was saying uh the reason i i was delivered out of homosexuality because somebody was praying for me to get out of it and how many times have i prayed against the homosexuality right here and wept and cried for the abominations of homosexuality right here i'm not saying it was me but i'm just saying i was one of those prayers i wasn't the only one praying but he doesn't know how he got out he said but i know people were praying for me to get out of homosexuality see so see we we're not supposed to go to every door right we don't have to go door to door god will send them here right god will send them here now you can go door to door if you feel led like i want to go church to church that's really that's what i want to do just because i see paul doing that and i thought man if paul did that he's got the holy ghost i've got the holy ghost i want to do that somehow but i just want to encourage you you know this we've got a burden we got a responsibility to the city to get the word out praise god but iran said that ought to be if we believe the coming messiahs at hand i think we ought to lay aside everything else and be concerned of getting this message to the land's yonder as fast as we can do it that's right if we're convinced but we preach that there's coming a messiah and want to put a hundred million dollars in a building and if the messiah's coming what good is that going to do i believe see if i had a hundred million dollars i believe the messiah was coming i would support a missionary program that would sweep around the country see right quick and get a church ready for him if you had 100 million dollars what would you do he said he would do a countrywide missionary meeting campaigns just to preach around the nation to get everybody ready for the rapture okay so let's just consider this let's consider these quotes you know as part of our vision we want to reach akron uh we want to reach more people for the kingdom of god we want to send brother simon and brother jason to mars when we start hearing about them going on missionary trips again we want to give them little offerings to help them out but we want to see how else can we try to spread the gospel more how how can we get the word out more because because also church you have to remember there's no condemnation to us that are in christ jesus right if we're in christ jesus there's no condemnation to us so god's not gonna look and say well you didn't do enough missionary work on the day of judgment you're condemned you're going to hell that's not that's not part of it because there's no condemnation the blood separates us from all condemnation and then as we yield to the holy spirit he teaches us how to do outreach right and so now look at our lives look at our lives we're a lot of young families here right and we got we got to raise our children we can't neglect our children we got to pay the bills god's given us jobs he's blessed us and everything so we have to say god we want to we want to do our part how can we do our part well we can do our part by us growing helping each other grow and then asking god give us labors that we can send forth into the mission field and i i'd be willing to go i'd be willing to go i just need god to send me right i'm sure some of you others would like to go too just to try to go out and find anyone just to have a program to try to get people looking to the coming of christ try to get them to look at the word of god and the gospel does everybody understand you know i'm trying to say like we just got to be have a vision to and i've preached this for years now you know over and over over the course of the years but i just want to keep our minds on that you know we got to be open to the holy spirit using us in different ways to try to reach more people which like it might be me going out witnessing and you know having a guest preacher here like i said you know that's how i i feel like that's how god could do it okay oh i like this so brother perry green had meetings in texas and he invited lots of people to come here brother brandon preach i'm grateful to perry green and these brethren that's put forth their efforts to make this meeting a success if there's anybody lost in this city in this generation it certainly won't be upon them fellows because they've turned every stone to try to make it a success feeding the people see getting them places to sleep and on television everywhere just taking the money right out of their own pockets and placing it right out so they know that the crowds that we have wouldn't be able to support such as that so they took it out of their own pockets to do it there's my 45 minutes how many more do i got so brother ram said i think it's wonderful like somebody with a vision like that i believe it was said over in hebrews 11 chapter of whom the world is not worthy and to stick their neck out in a time when the ministry is so unpopular against too many of the people that should believe it yeah let's stop let's stand on our feet there's 45 minutes right there perfect actually kept my word that time actually i shouldn't say that but actually kept my uh my limit i'll say it like that i always want to keep my word musicians you can come so church can you see the vision that i'm trying to project here by the word of god we all want to uh we want to see ourselves grow i'm going to pull that quote up real quick yeah that scripture we all want to grow individually falling more in love with jesus then we're going to grow together and i'll be honest i want to see vayne more often you know i was telling him no doubt i mean i wish he could be here every wednesday night you know i just hug him and love him and you know we hear the word of god and you know we're asking naomi okay you know we need to plan it out but can we have a play date for all the girls you know just because we need to be together more you know it's hard you know i know it's hard especially with little with young families i know it's hard on us but see that should be our vision vision for the future how can we grow individually in christ and grow together in love for one another and then grow the world as we wait this final revival we can sharpen each other make each other more wise more alert for the coming of the lord how many agree with that vision you feel like that's a good vision amen and it's got to get to the spot where we're totally bold we're satisfied we're praising god overflowing on the word overflowing on the oil the stimulation the baptism with the holy ghost like that's where we're going to back to that original church three thousand souls now i'm not saying we'll have that but lots of people born again at one time you know saved all accepting the lord jesus christ baptism my i just get happy thinking about it baptizing your dad and mom you know baptizing your stepmom and dad and mom you know or my parents i just get excited thinking about that why is that part of that part of god's plan because i know he's got to restore his church and we prayed all these prayers so church i look at the future and i'm excited for the future because we've got a vision the word has given us a vision for the future i can see it can you see it i see the vision that god has for us let's grow together let's grow in christ praise god and let's grow the world let's bar heads for a moment here heavenly father we just humble ourselves we thank you for another opportunity to hear the word of god we thank you for the saints that press their way out to the house of god they've actively chosen to assemble more as they see that day approaching lord it's a joy to see my brothers and sisters in christ how we love the children how we love each and every one here god lord just by coming lord we've strengthened one another any words will say lord it will sharpen each one dear god like i remember when vang sharpened me on the vaccines and i was related to worship human sacrifice what up what a sharpening dear god i was able to share that with brother brooks helped give out or we just sharpen one another give us wisdom and insight make us more alert things going around us dear god we want to watch and pray lord till you come so lord help us to grow individually help us to feed daily on your word and by the word of this grace we will grow up into the stature of a real christian the fullness of the standard of christ the lord help us to grow together help us to physically gather more help us to meet all the needs of the saints lord if there's something we don't know that someone needs god can you help them share with me or help me to find out so i can help them out we want everybody to have everything they need so they can serve christ they can work hard and eat their own bread not be bangers that's what your word says a man that doesn't work shouldn't eat and god help us to grow the world i pray in christ holy name you open up the traveling channels lord for brother jason for the simon we can help him out lord any other missionaries that we feel that [Music] thank you for this revival that you've set forth for the ministry of brother branham it's revive us out of dead denominations into this marvelous life lord thank you god hallelujah that the evening light is shining here tonight hallelujah
