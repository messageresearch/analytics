[17:21] know today's palm sunday you know the
[17:23] the christian world kind of supports
[17:25] uh you know they get the kids some palms
[17:27] and nothing wrong with that
[17:30] no doubt the bible says hosanna blessed
[17:32] is he who comes in the name of the lord
[17:34] many of those people were rejoicing over
[17:36] lazarus raising from the dead
[17:38] that's why the bible said many of them
[17:40] came but the sad part was within one
[17:42] week they'd all turned on him and saying
[17:44] crucify him
[17:45] crucify him we don't want to be we don't
[17:48] want to be moved like that do we
[17:50] we want our palms to always praise jesus
[17:52] praise god and
[17:53] we want to crucify the sin that's within
[17:56] us praise god
[17:57] and so i just always remember that
[17:58] that's always i love palm sunday
[18:00] the fact that they were rejoicing but uh
[18:04] i want my palms i want my hands to
[18:05] always praise the lord and i want to be
[18:07] instant in season odysseys and i want to
[18:09] be faithful
[18:10] i want to be diligent i want to be a
[18:12] true servant of jesus christ and not be
[18:14] swayed by the winds of doctrine of this
[18:15] world
[18:16] so god bless you as we come into palm
[18:19] sunday and you know the world calls it
[18:20] holy week but
[18:21] every week for us is holy after this
[18:24] after this next week they'll go back to
[18:26] all their you know chocolate and

[18:34] uh alcohol addictions they'll all go
[18:36] back to that
[18:37] but we don't go back to that praise god
[18:38] we go deeper into the word of god
[18:41] but brother man does say he said i've
[18:42] marked easter as the greatest
[18:44] week of the year and he said i've marked
[18:47] that in my heart as the greatest week of
[18:49] the year so

[24:44] saint said
[24:49] [Music]
[24:58] here
[25:12] so
[25:25] i just want to give a small testimony
[25:28] yes and
[25:33] for some reason but the prayer request
[25:38] was touching my heart because what was
[25:41] the chance you pray
[25:42] and why do you ask that's pretty much
[25:46] what my testimony has to be
[25:50] a few months ago
[25:53] a sister from my country
[25:57] because they have a financial problem so
[25:59] when she went to spain
[26:00] to work over there and
[26:04] in spain she got sick and she went to
[26:07] the hospital
[26:08] and they found that she had cancer
[26:13] the cancer was very
[26:16] advanced uh
[26:19] she kept this and the doctors and the
[26:21] doctors told him you better go back to
[26:24] your country because
[26:26] you're going to fight
[26:29] this move it's too expensive for you and
[26:32] your family to pay you
[26:34] from here take it back to your country
[26:41] so she went back to nicaragua
[26:45] and i didn't know this i just knew it
[26:48] yesterday but
[26:52] like two or three weeks ago maybe
[26:56] i feel in my heart to send a prayer
[26:58] class that i get programmed with
[27:00] or not and i couldn't like ever
[27:06] i send them
[27:09] i do believe
[27:12] there is anointing on those players
[27:18] because i've been getting healed because
[27:20] i cared in one moment
[27:23] and one of them went to this brother
[27:28] he his brother he preached and
[27:33] for almost four he said for over 30
[27:35] years he tried to get a prayer closer
[27:37] and he got it now when i sent it to him
[27:42] and that's that week
[27:45] the sister came back from spain
[27:49] and
[27:52] thirdly he went to pray for her
[27:56] because she has an appointment friday
[27:59] to check the cancer
[28:03] and
[28:10] he prayed for her friday
[28:14] she came to the hospital and they take
[28:16] the test
[28:20] i have the testimony and now the doctor
[28:26] the cancer is not there
[28:34] [Applause]
[28:43] is doing you know i think we don't
[28:46] deserve it but
[28:48] his grace his mercy is so big
[28:52] and i don't know
[28:56] how to explain this yes god put in my
[28:59] heart to send those prayer claws
[29:02] they believe that the anointing is there
[29:07] because uh that just remind me about
[29:10] what the anger taught also brother
[29:11] brahma
[29:13] you are sincere when you pray nothing
[29:16] can
[29:16] stand against your prayer not even the
[29:18] cancer
[29:20] and i i do believe brother branham was
[29:23] insane when he prayed for
[29:27] and
[29:30] when brother steve asked about his
[29:32] supervisor when i hear the other two
[29:35] i do believe the anointing still taught
[29:37] those prayers
[29:40] and
[29:44] maybe i hope that we can pray for
[29:49] for them you know i i do believe that
[29:53] god
[29:54] is the god of me
[29:57] thank you
[30:20] so

[48:34] so let's ask the holy spirit here and
[48:36] let's let the holy spirit preach
[48:37] for us here today i'll try to get out of
[48:39] god's way
[48:41] uh that's our only hope is that the holy
[48:43] spirit can come and help us praise god
[48:44] we're all
[48:45] we're all in desperate need of i'm in
[48:47] more need of the holy spirit all the
[48:48] time
[48:49] so we uh we're looking at joshua again
[48:51] and we'll start here and we're looking
[48:53] at part seven and
[48:54] uh you know it's it's palm sunday today
[48:57] but i was thinking about the real palm
[48:59] uh is when the bible says we all get to
[49:01] heaven
[49:02] there's a great multitude which no man
[49:04] can number of all nations of kindreds
[49:06] people's tongues
[49:07] stood before the throne and before the
[49:09] lamb
[49:11] and the bible says they got white robes
[49:13] on and palms in their hands
[49:15] amen and they cry with a loud voice were
[49:18] they saying
[49:19] salvation to our god which sitteth upon
[49:23] the throne
[49:24] and unto the lamb now this group is uh i
[49:27] believe this is the bride now there's
[49:28] one time brother random calls it the
[49:29] foolish
[49:30] virgin he calls it the foolish version
[49:31] and the seventh seal but i have seven
[49:33] other times he calls it the bride so
[49:35] i think it's the bride those seven i
[49:38] think seven is greater than one so
[49:40] and some of them are after the seals too
[49:42] so some people you know are curious
[49:43] about that but
[49:44] uh there's the one time he called it the
[49:46] bride so i need to look up and see if he
[49:47] got that from larkin because i've been
[49:48] studying larkin the last two weeks and
[49:50] brother and pulled numerous times of
[49:52] course from larkin he admitted it
[49:54] but i'd like to see if that one in
[49:55] particular is from larkin now this is
[49:57] the future home i believe it's the
[49:59] future hope the bible says as they're
[50:00] standing there waving the palms
[50:02] the bible said they'll hunger no more
[50:05] they'll thirst no more no
[50:07] nor shall the sun light on them
[50:10] remember the bible said in revelation 22
[50:12] 5 once we're in that future home
[50:14] we don't need the sun anymore because
[50:17] jesus christ
[50:18] is the light amen so thank god for that
[50:20] so i believe that's what it'll be like
[50:22] in the future home and
[50:23] imagine that time we're all gathered
[50:25] together every tribe
[50:27] nation kindred tongue that loved jesus
[50:30] christ that was forgiven by christ
[50:31] they're all in white robes
[50:33] a sea of what can you imagine that a sea
[50:35] of why all the way from the palm saying
[50:37] salvation to our god
[50:39] who sits upon the throne i believe
[50:42] there's a seat for me there amen
[50:44] there's a place for me to stand there i
[50:46] might be in the way back
[50:47] but i'm going to be standing there by
[50:48] god's grace
[50:50] oh that's the palm i want to wave right
[50:52] there amen
[50:54] oh that's just a great it's a great hope
[50:56] that we have is the bride of jesus
[50:58] christ praise god
[50:59] as we've been looking at the the mystery
[51:01] of the church is the bride that's our
[51:02] hope
[51:02] to be in that number right there it's a
[51:04] great number praise god
[51:06] thank the lord for that now let's pick
[51:08] up a chapter two
[51:09] now here's a few visuals here now uh
[51:12] we're looking at
[51:13] right before they take over jericho so
[51:15] the israel is camped on this side of the
[51:17] jordan
[51:17] here's the jordan there's a
[51:18] mediterranean sea there's the
[51:21] northern parts of israel and so they
[51:23] send the spies over
[51:25] you know to jericho and so we see it
[51:27] where they're talking there to
[51:28] rahab and then they're going to come
[51:30] back and then eventually go to gilgal
[51:32] before they go to jericho some people
[51:33] think gilgal is a little bit further
[51:35] south but that just gives you a little
[51:37] picture of
[51:38] the spies they you know they had to swim
[51:40] across jordan
[51:41] right they had they'd be good swimmers
[51:42] they needed some fit men to be spies
[51:46] because you know the lord didn't park
[51:47] the waters yet he only did that when
[51:48] they all went over jordan
[51:50] so they had to swim over and then they
[51:52] had a 13 mile walk imagine that
[51:54] a 13 mile walk to get to jericho and
[51:56] they had to slip in when the gates were
[51:58] open you know at the right time and
[52:00] the lord led them right to a harlot
[52:03] named rahab just what uh what a story
[52:05] isn't it story
[52:06] here's another picture just so you get
[52:08] to see how close jericho was
[52:09] bethlehem very close you know to jericho
[52:13] uh that's 13 miles i imagine you know
[52:15] probably like 20 or 30.
[52:17] um just kind of gives you an idea of the
[52:20] picture
[52:20] i don't know about you but i like to see
[52:21] it on the map i like to see it on a
[52:22] picture to kind of see what
[52:23] where were they at what were they doing
[52:25] i think i got one more oh no just two
[52:26] okay i
[52:28] i couldn't find one that i liked so i
[52:30] had to put a couple up there
[52:32] now we left off here last sunday how did
[52:35] she know the lord had given
[52:37] uh israel the land it was by revelation
[52:40] and we'll prove that by the bible the
[52:42] bible says numerous times
[52:43] rahab had faith so rahab had a
[52:46] revelation
[52:47] of the will of god how many know that's
[52:49] real faith real faith
[52:51] is a revelation of the will of god a lot
[52:54] of times church you know we operate and
[52:56] we have to
[52:57] a lot of times we have to operate in
[52:58] hope
[53:00] like we are this morning like with the
[53:01] brain tumor and you know the skin
[53:04] condition and the the cancer many of
[53:06] these situations
[53:07] we've got to operate in hope because we
[53:08] don't know god's perfect will for the
[53:10] outcome
[53:12] right but once god if he would by his
[53:14] grace
[53:15] make it known then we would have a
[53:17] revelation
[53:18] of god's will in other words a prophecy
[53:21] about what he's going to do
[53:22] praise god that's a great thing to have
[53:24] right that's amazing
[53:25] to have if you've got faith a revelation
[53:29] of god's will then you know
[53:31] undoubtedly what god is going to do so
[53:33] we've got to humble ourselves and admit
[53:35] many times we just have
[53:37] hope right we have faith we have a
[53:39] revelation we know god can do it
[53:42] but we don't know exactly is he going to
[53:44] do it
[53:45] praise god so there's nothing wrong with
[53:47] that because the bible said
[53:49] when you have real hope it maketh not
[53:50] ashamed amen
[53:52] hallelujah there is such a thing as real
[53:54] divine hope praise god
[53:56] you're unashamed of the gospel praise
[53:57] god you've got a hope you've got a
[53:59] confidence you've got
[54:00] something that you know is going to
[54:02] happen right you've got you know god's a
[54:04] good god
[54:04] you know he's faithful you know he's
[54:06] merciful you know he's a
[54:08] loving creator praise god you know he's
[54:10] the great physician amen
[54:12] amen i don't know so we've got great
[54:13] hope in god and we keep that hope
[54:16] until it's revealed by faith amen
[54:19] the will of god how many know you're
[54:20] saved today you got real faith we're not
[54:24] hoping we're saved we know we're saved
[54:26] amen
[54:27] because we've seen it cross over from
[54:29] death to life amen
[54:31] right we're witnesses of that we in our
[54:33] own lives we've seen that
[54:34] uh you know we we've got that confidence
[54:37] we've got faith
[54:38] and no it's a reality praise god amen
[54:41] and so it was revealed to her mother
[54:44] says this
[54:44] uh now in brother brahm's story he just
[54:48] he draws a picture he even admits it
[54:50] might not be right
[54:52] we know she was a prostitute she said we
[54:53] don't have much history on her
[54:55] let's let's imagine she was raised in a
[54:58] real poor house
[54:59] uh and she became ill fame a prostitute
[55:02] she's beautiful though
[55:03] she went to the streets to make her
[55:05] mother and father a living no
[55:07] way for her to work
[55:08] only sell the morals of her body right
[55:11] but i can imagine all the time she knew
[55:13] that was wrong there was something in
[55:14] her
[55:14] said now that's not right to do that she
[55:17] knew
[55:18] it wasn't so see every person has a
[55:20] conscience right
[55:21] everyone the bible said you have a a
[55:23] conscience uh conscious memory reason
[55:25] affection imagination everybody has
[55:27] these
[55:27] and god reveals himself in the
[55:29] conscience so rahab knew
[55:30] it's not right uh but i've got to do it
[55:33] i feel like i've got to do it
[55:35] and look how god was merciful because
[55:37] she knew it was wrong
[55:38] she didn't want to live in it god
[55:40] eventually sent her messengers amen
[55:43] messengers of deliverance amen glory
[55:46] praise god because she wanted that she
[55:47] knew it wasn't right she didn't want to
[55:48] be a part of it
[55:49] uh but god brought her out of it brother
[55:51] ramsey said one day she heard
[55:53] god was a movement her heart began to
[55:55] tremble she found a messenger from a
[55:57] great move
[55:58] told her that was going to take place
[56:00] what'd she say now joshua had signs
[56:02] joshua the same signs moses had exactly
[56:05] rahab didn't ask to see joshua's signs
[56:08] look at this so now remember brother
[56:10] man's talking about his his signs and
[56:12] his ministry right
[56:14] that's the whole point of this sermon is
[56:15] to show that we've got to move beyond
[56:17] the signs
[56:17] and look at the commission right so he
[56:20] said
[56:20] she didn't ask me show me one of
[56:22] joshua's signs
[56:24] he said a type of the church she just
[56:27] heard a type of the true church that's
[56:29] been pulled out of prostitution what a
[56:32] good type that is
[56:33] that's awesome we were in denominations
[56:35] and they're prostitutes to god work to
[56:37] god's word
[56:38] right they're claiming to be married to
[56:40] christ but they're unfaithful to the
[56:42] word amen
[56:43] so that's the beautiful type of rahab
[56:44] that's you and i we many of us were
[56:46] thank god if you weren't but many of us
[56:48] were in prostitute churches right
[56:50] claiming to be christians but not really
[56:52] living the life and and uh i'll say like
[56:54] this flirting with the world
[56:56] right making love to the world idolatry
[56:59] right
[56:59] but brother adam says she just heard
[57:02] uh uh he said i'm a baptist today
[57:05] methodist presbyterian
[57:07] but she pulled away out of i'm sorry
[57:09] pulled away in prostitution so rahab was
[57:12] caught in this
[57:13] and then she heard the word and she
[57:16] believed god's word
[57:17] amen but man said all of a sudden the
[57:20] little preacher enters the city now look
[57:21] he calls preacher
[57:22] another place he calls it a tape player
[57:24] a tape boy
[57:26] right another place he calls it a pastor
[57:28] i have the quotes on that brother says
[57:29] sometimes these two spies are
[57:31] pastors right so we can't just say oh
[57:34] it's a tape church you know
[57:36] he was just and he laughs after that
[57:37] when he says that in the token message
[57:39] so we got to be very careful with our
[57:41] types we remember that last week right
[57:42] be very careful with how you type
[57:45] and said there's a god that lives that
[57:46] lived yesterday it's the same today
[57:48] his power's the same he does the same
[57:50] works he did when he was on earth
[57:51] his agents are on the road amen
[57:54] thank god he's still got preachers today
[57:56] that know that jesus christ is the same
[57:58] yesterday today and forever
[58:00] amen now she knew was a harlot
[58:03] type of the believer the real believer
[58:05] she didn't say no
[58:07] i hear joshua can do signs because he's
[58:08] the successor i like to see some of
[58:10] those signs
[58:11] now in other words for for me it'd be
[58:13] like this well i know brother brown was
[58:14] a prophet
[58:15] uh i need to see that discernment
[58:17] operate in my life then i'll believe
[58:19] that was that's not what rahab said
[58:22] right rahab just said
[58:23] i believe amen i believe god's going to
[58:27] do something here amen
[58:28] she would say i've got to see a sign to
[58:30] believe
[58:31] she just looked at the commission praise
[58:34] god
[58:35] he said if i could see those signs no he
[58:37] absolutely didn't have to show those
[58:39] signs because she believed it anyhow
[58:41] she wasn't a thomas she believed it
[58:44] now remember church don't get down on
[58:46] thomas because many of us are that way
[58:48] we we wouldn't believe unless we have a
[58:50] sign but probably i'm talking about real
[58:52] faith here amen
[58:54] right brother talking about real genuine
[58:55] faith that doesn't need a sign
[58:57] amen although many of us could be thomas
[59:01] right
[59:01] many of the brothers could be thomas the
[59:03] gideon was a thomas right
[59:05] he had to see it to believe it which we
[59:08] can understand that
[59:09] but rahab didn't believe it just like
[59:11] mary amen just like mary he just she
[59:13] just said be it unto me
[59:15] according to the word hallelujah
[59:18] she believed it now he said now moses
[59:21] when he had signs he went down and
[59:22] performed the signs but
[59:23] the sign isn't the thing that took them
[59:25] to the promised land it wasn't
[59:27] the signs so so moses is signing his
[59:29] hand that wasn't what took them to the
[59:31] promised land
[59:32] the holy spirit the pillar of fire took
[59:34] them to the promised land
[59:36] amen right the leadership of god
[59:39] the leaders the daily leadership of the
[59:41] holy spirit following him
[59:43] every day is what took them to the
[59:45] promised land amen
[59:47] that's right the signs was the
[59:48] vindication of the commission
[59:50] and raya believed it without seeing
[59:52] anything she said
[59:53] we're all trembling
[59:56] like brother jack told me from albion
[59:58] the first time i preached there
[1:00:00] i said you know we preached we had a
[1:00:01] wonderful service and he come up he said
[1:00:03] brother
[1:00:03] he said i want to tell you he said
[1:00:07] he said you're a better believer than i
[1:00:09] am and i said brother no way i said you
[1:00:10] were sat in brother man's meetings
[1:00:12] and he said well i've got scripture
[1:00:13] brother no i love brother jack i'm not
[1:00:15] saying i'm saying all good things about
[1:00:16] him but
[1:00:17] you know him i'm just kind of like
[1:00:18] talking like him as a joke he said well
[1:00:20] i've got scripture to prove it
[1:00:22] i said well brother we'll share it but
[1:00:24] brother i'm no better than you
[1:00:25] he said well he said jesus told thomas
[1:00:27] blessed oh he said
[1:00:29] he said you're more blessed than i am
[1:00:30] that's what he said
[1:00:32] and he said jesus said blessed are those
[1:00:35] who haven't seen
[1:00:36] yet have believed he said i saw brother
[1:00:38] branham's gift
[1:00:40] he said and i believe but you haven't
[1:00:42] seen it and you believe so you're more
[1:00:44] blessed than i am and i started laughing
[1:00:45] i said well you got me on that one buddy
[1:00:48] but i don't believe that really in other
[1:00:50] words i'm saying god has blessed him
[1:00:52] tremendously praise god
[1:00:54] and i want to always uh humble myself i
[1:00:56] never want to exalt myself
[1:00:57] i always want to humble myself by god's
[1:00:59] grace now do i believe i'm blessed
[1:01:01] absolutely praise god and i believe i
[1:01:03] believe that's true what jesus said
[1:01:06] but i've seen god heal cancer my mom was
[1:01:08] healed right
[1:01:09] i've seen god do great things and so i
[1:01:11] never want to exalt myself or anything
[1:01:13] like that
[1:01:13] but i appreciate what he's saying he's
[1:01:15] he's and that's kind of what brother
[1:01:17] i'm saying here rahab didn't need
[1:01:19] anything
[1:01:20] she just heard and she just believed
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:24] we don't know what happened maybe she
[1:01:25] had a dream maybe she saw an angel like
[1:01:27] mary right mary did have a supernatural
[1:01:29] experience to go back on right
[1:01:31] so sometimes we we got to balance that
[1:01:33] out too well she did see an angel
[1:01:35] how many of us have seen a physical
[1:01:36] angel right or a spiritual angel i never
[1:01:38] have
[1:01:39] but she had that but she believed what
[1:01:41] the angel said
[1:01:42] but rahab somehow didn't need a sign she
[1:01:45] just believed
[1:01:46] praise god now here's what i got here's
[1:01:49] kind of what i ended with last week too
[1:01:51] she didn't have to see a sign that
[1:01:52] joshua could do this with his hand or
[1:01:54] the stick
[1:01:55] she believed she said i heard i believe
[1:01:58] now i'm
[1:01:58] asking for mercy amen
[1:02:02] that's what you and i got to come asking
[1:02:04] for we got to ask for mercy he said oh
[1:02:07] how he could put a lesson right here i'm
[1:02:09] asking for mercy for me
[1:02:12] and my house ah that's the way to
[1:02:15] approach god amen
[1:02:17] i know god's a great god i know
[1:02:19] judgments on this road
[1:02:20] but i'm asking mercy for me and for my
[1:02:23] house
[1:02:23] i want to be on god's side i don't want
[1:02:25] to be against him i want to be invited
[1:02:27] to his side amen
[1:02:30] he said look at that roman that night
[1:02:32] now he talks about the
[1:02:33] philippian jailer uh remember he's going
[1:02:36] to kill himself and paul said do
[1:02:37] yourself no harm
[1:02:38] what what can i do to be saved believe
[1:02:40] and thy in thy house shall be saved he
[1:02:42] said certainly
[1:02:43] thou shalt be say why if you've got
[1:02:45] enough faith to have yourself saved you
[1:02:47] can have enough faith for your family to
[1:02:48] be saved
[1:02:49] he said die in thy house amen
[1:02:52] he said look at rahab have mercy about
[1:02:54] me here i love this quote
[1:02:56] she in other words she said spare me
[1:02:58] spies i don't want to die
[1:03:00] with these unbelievers i don't want to
[1:03:02] die as an animal
[1:03:04] i want to die in the arms of jehovah i
[1:03:05] believe you're god because he's
[1:03:07] both god of heaven and earth he does
[1:03:09] visible things he makes things real
[1:03:12] i've never seen him do it but i but i
[1:03:14] believe it now and that's how it is
[1:03:16] today
[1:03:17] you know even if we haven't seen
[1:03:18] anything yes let's say we're new to
[1:03:19] faith or we've never seen a miracle
[1:03:21] we should still say i don't want to die
[1:03:23] in the tribulation period
[1:03:25] right i don't want to die with these
[1:03:26] sinners i don't want anything to do with
[1:03:28] sin
[1:03:28] i love the sinners but i hate their sin
[1:03:31] i don't want anything to do with them
[1:03:33] i want to serve god i want god's mercy
[1:03:35] upon my life amen
[1:03:37] i want to be delivered from the oncoming
[1:03:39] wrath of god the bible said we're
[1:03:41] appointed
[1:03:42] to be delivered from the wrath of god
[1:03:44] hallelujah
[1:03:45] and that's all she said just have mercy
[1:03:48] i don't want to be a part of this
[1:03:49] this society i know jericho is all evil
[1:03:52] and we all know judgment's coming i
[1:03:55] don't want to be a part of that have
[1:03:56] mercy
[1:03:57] may god have mercy on me what can you
[1:03:59] tell me that will
[1:04:00] that will convince me god has mercy and
[1:04:03] they said we give you our word
[1:04:04] and we give you a red cord token amen
[1:04:08] oh that's what we need today the token
[1:04:10] tells us it's a sign
[1:04:12] right it's a sign that we'll be saved
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] that's what they asked for she said i
[1:04:18] want god's favor
[1:04:19] who doesn't want god's grace i want
[1:04:22] god's grace amen that's what she's
[1:04:24] saying
[1:04:25] i've got some brethren i've got they're
[1:04:26] old and crippled i want to have faith
[1:04:28] for them
[1:04:30] how do we know she had genuine faith by
[1:04:33] her works
[1:04:34] right as soon as you have faith the
[1:04:37] bible said you receive it as a gift of
[1:04:38] god
[1:04:39] in fact it's jesus's own faith so if you
[1:04:42] have a part of jesus faith
[1:04:43] it's going to do the works of jesus
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:47] and so what the bible says see this
[1:04:49] proves that when she said i know it was
[1:04:50] a different kind of no than all the
[1:04:52] other sinners
[1:04:53] all the other the bible said their
[1:04:55] hearts melted all the other people in
[1:04:57] the city were so scared
[1:04:58] oh we're all gonna die they're on high
[1:05:00] alert you know uh
[1:05:02] they're all gonna die but she knew in a
[1:05:04] different way
[1:05:06] she knew that the god could deliver her
[1:05:08] the god that was coming and gonna
[1:05:10] pour out his wrath she also knew that
[1:05:12] god is a god of mercy
[1:05:15] and she wanted favor from that god she
[1:05:17] knew that god was loving amen
[1:05:19] she knew her society was immoral right
[1:05:21] but she also had faith
[1:05:23] and the bible said she had faith she
[1:05:26] didn't perish with them that believed
[1:05:28] not
[1:05:28] because she was a believer amen
[1:05:31] aren't you glad you're a believer this
[1:05:33] morning you won't perish with the world
[1:05:36] you're a believer praise god amen amen
[1:05:39] that's that's the confidence we have in
[1:05:40] god
[1:05:41] right and how did she have her faith
[1:05:44] she showed her faith by her works she
[1:05:47] received the spies
[1:05:48] with peace in other words she didn't
[1:05:51] battle the preachers like they're doing
[1:05:52] today
[1:05:54] oh my she didn't degrade the preachers
[1:05:56] like they did like they're doing today
[1:05:58] she received peace right
[1:06:02] so receiving god's messenger is the same
[1:06:04] as receiving god right
[1:06:06] jesus says this you gotta define your
[1:06:07] life you gotta lose it
[1:06:10] he that receives you receives me
[1:06:13] and he that receives me receives him
[1:06:15] that sent me there's that chain of
[1:06:16] command amen
[1:06:18] right there's a chain of command the
[1:06:19] believer to the preacher
[1:06:22] to christ to god amen just like god
[1:06:25] christ man woman praise god right it
[1:06:28] starts the order goes up that chain of
[1:06:30] command
[1:06:31] with authority praise god amen i don't
[1:06:34] have any authority
[1:06:35] the holy spirit's the one that's got
[1:06:36] authority praise god
[1:06:38] that's why god honors our prayers here
[1:06:39] the pulpit represents the authority of
[1:06:41] god's word
[1:06:42] but god has a man a glacier in an office
[1:06:45] and if you respect this office
[1:06:47] then you'll get fed by the office amen
[1:06:50] if you respect the office then god will
[1:06:52] honor your faith because it works in a
[1:06:54] chain of command right
[1:06:55] you've got to receive the ones jesus
[1:06:57] said because they were hand
[1:06:58] picked by him and that means they were
[1:07:01] handpicked by god the father praise god
[1:07:04] right because christ is the image of the
[1:07:06] invisible god he's the human
[1:07:08] manifestation of the invisible almighty
[1:07:10] god
[1:07:12] we know there's a reward for receiving a
[1:07:13] prophet hallelujah
[1:07:16] but abraham said it just comes in handy
[1:07:17] he said a prophet i've always
[1:07:19] always wondered what's the prophet's
[1:07:20] reward he said just comes in handy
[1:07:22] sometimes
[1:07:22] i believe it's more than that too i
[1:07:23] believe it's we get the prophecy of the
[1:07:25] prophet
[1:07:26] and that gives us wisdom in this life
[1:07:30] right we look at all the world events
[1:07:32] and who was telling me that yesterday
[1:07:33] somebody was telling me that yesterday
[1:07:35] oh brother adam i was talking about that
[1:07:37] and he was talking about all these
[1:07:38] people that you know
[1:07:40] they're all so nervous he said but while
[1:07:42] they're nervous
[1:07:43] we can just rest in christ
[1:07:46] because we have the reward of a prophet
[1:07:50] we believe the prophecy we believe thus
[1:07:52] saith the lord amen
[1:07:54] right so we get many rewards from the
[1:07:57] prophet
[1:07:58] for receiving a prophet in the name of a
[1:08:00] prophet
[1:08:02] right like i always tell you about my
[1:08:03] friends i have these preacher friends
[1:08:05] that are in denomination and all of them
[1:08:08] all of them have heirs in their life or
[1:08:10] they they jump on certain bandwagons
[1:08:12] that if they knew the message
[1:08:13] they wouldn't have done that right but
[1:08:16] because they don't accept the prophet
[1:08:18] they don't get the prophet's reward for
[1:08:21] example is they go
[1:08:22] after all these false prophets that
[1:08:24] prophesied trump is going to win and
[1:08:26] and then they follow their teachings and
[1:08:27] they get in their lifestyle they start
[1:08:29] doing the things they do like my one
[1:08:31] friend he followed joyce meyer
[1:08:33] and she always picks a word for the year
[1:08:34] like you know prosperity or health or
[1:08:37] and then he starts doing that and and
[1:08:40] and then he's
[1:08:40] then they start worshiping the way they
[1:08:42] do
[1:08:44] uh and and then they and then they start
[1:08:45] and he still believes in this day my
[1:08:47] good friend
[1:08:48] he still believes that there's going to
[1:08:50] be a national american revival
[1:08:52] but if he would accept the word of god
[1:08:54] for our day he'd know there's just
[1:08:56] a bride's revival going on and then he
[1:08:58] could be a part of it praise god
[1:09:00] you see what i'm saying but you and i
[1:09:02] saw that and we accepted it and now
[1:09:04] we're a part of it
[1:09:06] amen amen and no one's going to take me
[1:09:09] out because i've been revived i've been
[1:09:11] made alive amen
[1:09:13] and if i leave this i leave life but i'm
[1:09:15] saying with this because i know this is
[1:09:17] life amen
[1:09:19] i know what it's like to be dead right
[1:09:20] brother we know it's like being dead in
[1:09:22] churches
[1:09:22] but we know what life is like as well
[1:09:25] this is life the life of christ amen
[1:09:28] oh hallelujah the life of christ that he
[1:09:31] still heals cancer
[1:09:34] just simple humble prayers over cloths
[1:09:38] the churches say the cloth has power the
[1:09:40] cloth has no power the cloth represents
[1:09:42] the one
[1:09:43] uh who who heals praise god it
[1:09:46] represents there's anointing on that man
[1:09:48] on brother branham and those prayer
[1:09:49] claws if you don't know come from
[1:09:50] jeffersonville
[1:09:51] but they put him on brother branham's
[1:09:53] pulpit when they prayed for him
[1:09:56] because i don't have confidence in the
[1:09:57] men that prayed for them but i've got
[1:09:58] confidence
[1:09:59] in that man that preach at that pulpit
[1:10:02] 60 years ago
[1:10:04] yeah amen and that's what our confidence
[1:10:07] is in
[1:10:07] the reward of the prophet amen
[1:10:10] hallelujah
[1:10:11] god entered brother god honored brother
[1:10:13] ham's prayers god will still honor
[1:10:16] those that believe his message amen
[1:10:19] that's right and the bible said if you
[1:10:23] give a drink of
[1:10:24] water in the name of a disciple
[1:10:28] then you shall certainly have a roar
[1:10:30] nobody can take that reward from you
[1:10:32] now who are jesus disciples today any
[1:10:34] learner is a disciple
[1:10:37] so if you give a cup of water in the
[1:10:38] name of brother bang
[1:10:41] i give this in the name of brother vang
[1:10:43] in other words to honor
[1:10:44] a believer if you do if you give a
[1:10:47] something
[1:10:48] to honor somebody else's faith then the
[1:10:50] bible said you'll have a reward
[1:10:52] the love offering thomas from the church
[1:10:54] you're giving an
[1:10:55] offering in the name of the disciple
[1:10:59] right and so there's going to be a
[1:11:00] reward for that because who you
[1:11:02] associate with
[1:11:03] is very important birds of a feather
[1:11:05] flock together how can two walk together
[1:11:07] except they be agreed amen and we agree
[1:11:10] on this that jesus christ
[1:11:12] is the risen son of god amen he's
[1:11:14] finished the mysteries of god through
[1:11:16] his prophet william
[1:11:17] and we are echoing those prophecies
[1:11:20] again and may the internet take them
[1:11:22] around the world amen
[1:11:23] until simon can go again and brother
[1:11:25] craig can go again
[1:11:27] until brother ben narada can go again
[1:11:28] right they can't go now
[1:11:30] but may god use the internet so we can
[1:11:31] finish going around the world
[1:11:34] we've got to keep doing that that's the
[1:11:35] commission for today take this
[1:11:37] revelation around the world revelation
[1:11:39] 10 11.
[1:11:42] do you know that she's mentioned another
[1:11:43] time in the new testament
[1:11:46] see then how that by works a man is
[1:11:48] justified and not by faith only
[1:11:51] likewise also was not rahab the harlot
[1:11:54] justified by works
[1:11:57] now we know it's justification by faith
[1:11:59] in other words her
[1:12:01] faith went to work she acted upon what
[1:12:05] she believed
[1:12:06] works in his saver work so showed she
[1:12:09] was saved
[1:12:10] and then god did save her body right so
[1:12:12] god saved her soul first
[1:12:14] and then she worked from that salvation
[1:12:16] of the soul and
[1:12:17] she worked and then god saved her body
[1:12:19] too oh glory
[1:12:22] was not she justified by works when she
[1:12:24] received the messengers
[1:12:26] and sent them out another way
[1:12:29] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:12:31] dead so faith without works is that also
[1:12:33] this is the same chapter if you see
[1:12:35] someone cold and you don't give them a
[1:12:37] coat
[1:12:37] or you don't tell room right or they're
[1:12:39] hungry and we don't give them food the
[1:12:41] bible said how can there be faith in our
[1:12:43] hearts
[1:12:44] and the church said amen so if we see a
[1:12:48] need
[1:12:49] our faith should move us to try to help
[1:12:51] out in some way
[1:12:54] like that last time but stephen you
[1:12:55] remember that last time those people
[1:12:56] said they had car trouble
[1:12:58] i knew they didn't have car trouble i
[1:13:00] knew
[1:13:01] that woman she looked down and she said
[1:13:02] oh look how dirty his pants were he's
[1:13:04] been working on this tire all day and i
[1:13:05] thought
[1:13:08] hurt his pants weren't even dirty and
[1:13:11] that's what they do to try to get you
[1:13:12] in those drug addicts they just want you
[1:13:14] to instantly give you the money just
[1:13:15] quick right away i've worked with them
[1:13:17] before but you know what i thought my
[1:13:18] heart there i'm gonna let them use me
[1:13:21] i'm gonna let them use me i want money a
[1:13:24] little bit of money their camera's there
[1:13:25] that's right that's right whenever the
[1:13:26] cam was here last time
[1:13:28] and i pray later uh and they text me
[1:13:30] later
[1:13:31] and i say well i don't feel led to give
[1:13:32] right now because i don't know about
[1:13:34] your sincerity they never text me back
[1:13:36] that was like a week later
[1:13:38] but i gave them a bible i gave them my
[1:13:40] book i gave them the church age book
[1:13:41] i gave them all these books they're like
[1:13:44] so they're
[1:13:45] they're accountable but the bible says
[1:13:47] we've got to let ourselves be you
[1:13:49] sometimes praise god jesus said pray for
[1:13:53] them
[1:13:53] who despitefully use you
[1:13:56] amen i knew that wasn't i knew they
[1:13:59] weren't having guard trouble
[1:14:00] you can see it on their faces right they
[1:14:03] probably just go from one church to
[1:14:04] another
[1:14:05] but see but even as a christian we want
[1:14:07] to help out somehow
[1:14:09] so that's why i felt the lord leave me
[1:14:10] to go get the bibles go get the books
[1:14:12] right go get
[1:14:13] go get those first at least maybe
[1:14:14] they'll repent
[1:14:16] right i don't know why i put that in
[1:14:18] there but that's important it just came
[1:14:19] to me
[1:14:20] faith works by love rahab loved god and
[1:14:23] protected
[1:14:24] his messengers amen
[1:14:27] now verse 10 and 11 the bible says these
[1:14:30] people
[1:14:31] all have the spirit of fear their hearts
[1:14:33] melted
[1:14:35] and so that that spirit of fear is
[1:14:37] unbelief to condemnation right
[1:14:40] everybody in the city had fear even
[1:14:43] rahab was afraid
[1:14:44] right until she got the token
[1:14:48] amen because the bible said some people
[1:14:50] will go to hell because of fear
[1:14:53] which is unbelief right because you have
[1:14:55] faith or unbelief either saved or lost
[1:14:58] well most of the people in that city had
[1:15:00] the spirit of fear they were filled with
[1:15:02] demonic power
[1:15:03] of fear they rejected faith they they
[1:15:06] were fearful
[1:15:07] right and that's a type of today most of
[1:15:10] the world today is full of fear
[1:15:13] right scared someone's going to think
[1:15:14] i'm a racist or scared of the
[1:15:16] coronavirus or
[1:15:17] scared of violence or scared of all
[1:15:19] these things we should be like esther if
[1:15:21] i perish i perish
[1:15:22] because i know where i'm going i'm going
[1:15:24] to heaven to be with jesus amen
[1:15:27] i mean what are you going to do live in
[1:15:28] fear your whole life forever or what do
[1:15:30] you
[1:15:30] do we need to be children of faith
[1:15:33] praise god
[1:15:34] confidence strong only be strong and
[1:15:38] very courageous
[1:15:40] amen like boston if i die it's a
[1:15:43] blessing for me
[1:15:44] but he said i'm proud to stay for you
[1:15:45] guys to help you out
[1:15:47] right that's what philippians said he
[1:15:49] said be lot better if i died i could go
[1:15:51] be with jesus
[1:15:52] when i'm absent from the body i'm
[1:15:53] present with the lord he said but for
[1:15:55] your sakes
[1:15:55] i'll probably stay and he did he did say
[1:15:58] a few more years
[1:15:59] right it's all it's easier to get out of
[1:16:01] here right it's easier
[1:16:03] it's harder to stay and keep fighting
[1:16:04] the good fight of faith right it's
[1:16:06] harder thing to do paul says that right
[1:16:09] but the bible said they're going to say
[1:16:11] give me peace give me safety right peace
[1:16:13] and safety the antichrist is going to be
[1:16:14] satan superman the pope
[1:16:16] he's going to give them everything they
[1:16:17] want they're fearful so they're saying
[1:16:19] give me peace
[1:16:20] give me safety and we're saying the same
[1:16:22] thing you can have peace and safety
[1:16:24] in the holy ghost amen but they're
[1:16:28] offering it through you know
[1:16:29] things of the world right finances and
[1:16:31] all these things we're offering it
[1:16:32] through the holy spirit
[1:16:34] amen the love the joy the peace the long
[1:16:37] suffering
[1:16:38] the patience the holy the godliness the
[1:16:40] fruits of the spirit we're offering
[1:16:42] peace and safety
[1:16:43] so kind amen amen
[1:16:47] hallelujah see people today are going to
[1:16:51] be so willing to take the mark of the
[1:16:52] beast because they have these
[1:16:53] their hearts are melted with the spirit
[1:16:55] of fear what if i get kicked off on
[1:16:57] facebook
[1:16:58] what if i get kicked off on twitter well
[1:17:00] good their loss
[1:17:02] right it's their loss i've left all
[1:17:05] those things willingly but i still got
[1:17:06] youtube because i want to let everybody
[1:17:07] know i'm leaving but even if i get shut
[1:17:09] off tomorrow that's their loss
[1:17:10] i'm a light we're lights amen we're
[1:17:13] lights in the lost let them cancel i
[1:17:15] thought my salvation is not in
[1:17:17] technology
[1:17:18] my salvation is not in money my
[1:17:21] salvation is in the blood of jesus amen
[1:17:24] that's where my salvation is i've got
[1:17:26] faith in that praise god
[1:17:29] but they're they've got spirits of fear
[1:17:31] and they just want
[1:17:33] my money and buying i just want to be
[1:17:34] able to have money and buy things
[1:17:37] i'll sell out anything for that oh what
[1:17:40] a bunch of compromisers
[1:17:42] and they'll crucify the holy spirit word
[1:17:45] of god so they can have what they
[1:17:46] want to buy and access to their money
[1:17:49] but we sing
[1:17:50] take this whole world give me jesus amen
[1:17:54] you can take this whole world just give
[1:17:56] me jesus
[1:17:58] that's right you can take whatever you
[1:17:59] want it's all going to come and go it's
[1:18:01] all going to burn anyway
[1:18:02] take whatever you want just give me
[1:18:04] jesus but i have said the true bride of
[1:18:06] christ
[1:18:07] amen is interested in spiritual
[1:18:09] transactions amen
[1:18:11] the world is interested in natural
[1:18:13] transactions
[1:18:14] but we're interested in transacting with
[1:18:17] the holy ghost amen
[1:18:19] in other words we pray he answers we
[1:18:21] pray he answers
[1:18:22] we pray we receive amen glory
[1:18:28] and then in verses 12 and 13 she said
[1:18:31] you boys i saved your life now
[1:18:33] look at her talk like that i saved your
[1:18:35] life give me a token
[1:18:37] you promised me i saved you no

[1:19:01] red cord was
[1:19:02] to hang down the window we'll be
[1:19:03] responsible if
[1:19:05] you put them in the house so

[1:19:14] red torch with the red

[1:19:23] ghost
[1:19:24] oh that's right church amen god will

[1:20:51] thorns
[1:20:53] all right it's your crucifixion right
[1:20:54] it's your depth of self
[1:20:56] but through that there'll be many great
[1:20:58] victories amen
[1:21:00] hallelujah
[1:21:04] brethren if there ever was a time we

[1:21:26] wedding supper of the
[1:21:27] the king for his son he came down one
[1:21:30] last time

[1:22:00] by the way thank god we've got god's
[1:22:02] provided way today
[1:22:03] amen but when he asked that judas
[1:22:08] he had nothing to say yeah no testimony
[1:22:10] but we overcome
[1:22:11] by the word of our testimony oh some of
[1:22:14] you ought to have a word of a testimony

[1:22:27] i used to be dirty i dirty clothes dirty
[1:22:29] life but he's giving me his
[1:22:30] righteousness of robes
[1:22:33] that's my testimony the king gave me new
[1:22:36] robes
[1:22:38] he's got to come down one last time to
[1:22:40] make sure there are no mortgages amongst
[1:22:42] us
[1:22:43] may god hasten the day for that can i
[1:22:45] get amen
[1:22:47] that there's no more judaism amongst us
[1:22:49] praise god
[1:22:50] that's only god's children left amen
[1:22:53] only god's children are sitting right
[1:22:55] here our robe
[1:22:56] just waiting for that wedding to start
[1:22:58] praise god amen
[1:23:00] hallelujah god hasten the day for that
[1:23:04] we know he's really narrowing it down
[1:23:05] don't we yeah we've seen over the last
[1:23:08] 15 years of this church
[1:23:10] he's really narrowing it down he's
[1:23:11] really finding those who have the white
[1:23:13] garments and those who don't
[1:23:15] oh thank god for his mercy that we can
[1:23:17] have him
[1:23:19] the preacher said i'm not responsible
[1:23:21] unless you get them in the house
[1:23:24] and she made them swear they would not
[1:23:26] destroy her family
[1:23:27] he said if you'll get them in they'll be
[1:23:29] safe
[1:23:30] she let them down out of the place and a
[1:23:33] way they went so
[1:23:34] look she had something to do she had
[1:23:35] some work to do how many got some work
[1:23:37] to do today
[1:23:38] i've still got to get some people in the
[1:23:39] house praise god i'm writing them
[1:23:42] letters i'm calling them i'm texting
[1:23:43] them i'm praying for them
[1:23:44] i'm doing everything i can to try to get
[1:23:46] them in the house
[1:23:48] making videos i'm sending texts and
[1:23:51] scriptures
[1:23:52] i'm dreaming about it you know you're
[1:23:53] dreaming about it you know we're
[1:23:55] all these things just trying to get them
[1:23:57] in the house and may god give you the
[1:23:58] grace to eventually get them in the
[1:24:00] house that would be god's grace
[1:24:03] god's favor remember church some houses
[1:24:07] saw everyone save like the philippian
[1:24:09] jailers others did not jesus said many
[1:24:11] of you
[1:24:12] your greatest enemies are going to be in
[1:24:14] your house
[1:24:15] he didn't promise to save every person
[1:24:17] in your family he just said
[1:24:19] if you can get them in that's a big if
[1:24:22] but i've got a big god behind that big
[1:24:24] if praise god
[1:24:26] right i've got a great god that can take
[1:24:29] that if and
[1:24:30] if i believe it and if i can apply it if
[1:24:32] i can pray
[1:24:33] and if i can believe perhaps god will
[1:24:35] bring everybody in amen
[1:24:38] but it's all an if because remember he
[1:24:39] can't force him to come in right
[1:24:41] yeah so what do we got to do like rahab
[1:24:44] seek god for his will
[1:24:46] the best thing you can do jesus said i
[1:24:48] sanctify
[1:24:49] myself for their sakes if we want to see
[1:24:52] our family members say
[1:24:54] the way to do it is clean out our lives
[1:24:58] amen clean out our houses amen
[1:25:01] amen and then you invite your family in
[1:25:04] love and sincerity
[1:25:05] jesus said all the father has given
[1:25:08] me shall come to me that's why i said i
[1:25:10] went in i think i turned off the live
[1:25:11] stream and i
[1:25:12] named a certain person in my family and
[1:25:14] i said i've written letters to them
[1:25:16] i've text them i've called them we've
[1:25:18] talked about it
[1:25:19] i've begged them i've cried with them i
[1:25:21] pray with them i've done all i know how
[1:25:23] to do
[1:25:24] and if they eventually don't accept the
[1:25:26] message i can have peace in my heart
[1:25:28] because i know i tried i tried to get
[1:25:30] them to come in the house
[1:25:31] amen i begged them to come in the house
[1:25:34] i wrote them a letter will you please
[1:25:35] get in the house
[1:25:37] amen i said her a church age book too
[1:25:40] and my book i've done all i know how to
[1:25:42] do
[1:25:43] to get that soul in the house and so i
[1:25:45] can have peace and i know god will never
[1:25:47] let me down
[1:25:48] god will never fail me praise god god
[1:25:51] will never disappoint me if i'm
[1:25:53] disappointed it's my
[1:25:54] fault not god's fault amen and god will
[1:25:56] save all those who want to be saved amen
[1:25:59] amen all those who want to be in that
[1:26:02] house can be there
[1:26:03] amen there's plenty of room amen there's
[1:26:06] plenty of room

[1:45:17] the mystery of two separate people
[1:45:19] becoming one through the messiah
[1:45:22] and god foretells it so let's never look
[1:45:25] down on what god is doing
[1:45:27] touch not mine anointed these anointed
[1:45:31] saints
[1:45:31] do my servants no harm amen
[1:45:36] and then boaz and ruth brought forth
[1:45:38] obed obed brought forth jesse
[1:45:41] jesse brought forth david out of david
[1:45:43] and bathsheba
[1:45:44] adultery that was forgiven god brought
[1:45:47] forth
[1:45:48] nathan 36 generations later
[1:45:52] jesus was born
[1:45:55] david's great-great-grandmother was
[1:45:58] rahab
[1:46:00] look what god will do for someone who
[1:46:02] believes the word
[1:46:05] god rescued her out of the destruction
[1:46:08] the worldwide the city-wide destruction
[1:46:10] the national destruction god rescued her
[1:46:12] out of there
[1:46:13] gave her a godly husband and
[1:46:17] blessed her seed and her children so
[1:46:19] much so that out of them would come
[1:46:21] forth the promised messiah
[1:46:24] could you have a better family lineage
[1:46:26] than that church
[1:46:28] so roo god honors ray have faith and
[1:46:31] brings that brings her
[1:46:32] into the we'd say the most prestigious
[1:46:35] family in the message
[1:46:38] the family of the messiah amen
[1:46:42] yeah i'll show you what god will do for
[1:46:44] someone that loves him
[1:46:46] someone that believes him he'll bring
[1:46:47] them right into his own family
[1:46:50] i am a friend of god he calls me friend
[1:46:55] oh hallelujah david could say
[1:46:59] they could say david where'd you get
[1:47:00] your faith well it's from the lord but
[1:47:04] my great-grandma was rahab don't you
[1:47:06] know that
[1:47:10] how could you go face goliath well it
[1:47:12] was kind of built into me you know my
[1:47:14] my great grandma faced the whole
[1:47:17] destruction and she overcame
[1:47:20] she overcome by the the red cord i
[1:47:22] overcome by a sling
[1:47:25] right but it wasn't the sling it was god
[1:47:26] behind the sling it wasn't the cord
[1:47:28] it was god behind the cord amen it's the
[1:47:31] fate behind the product amen
[1:47:34] it's the faith behind our works amen
[1:47:38] it just kind of built into me that's why
[1:47:41] i could defeat goliath it was just
[1:47:43] kind of like a family thing you know
[1:47:45] aren't you glad you got that family
[1:47:46] thing going for you
[1:47:48] why are you such a christian why do you
[1:47:50] act like this i'm just part of the
[1:47:51] family and i just
[1:47:52] kind of runs in the family praise god my
[1:47:56] great grandma was rahab
[1:47:58] my grandma was ruth she left everything
[1:48:02] to follow jehovah david how do you do it
[1:48:05] how do you follow god so closely well my
[1:48:08] great grandma found her so closely
[1:48:10] my grandma found her so closely it's
[1:48:13] just kind of runs in the family
[1:48:16] people might wonder about that but
[1:48:17] that's actually scriptural
[1:48:20] paul looked at timothy and said he said
[1:48:22] i've got one son in the gospel
[1:48:24] timothy but timothy in you
[1:48:27] i see the faith that was in your mother
[1:48:31] and your grandmother think about sister
[1:48:33] sarah's was it your grandpa singing
[1:48:34] those songs is that who it was
[1:48:36] yeah look at that look how the faith
[1:48:38] gets passed down
[1:48:40] my grandpa prayed and raised my grandma
[1:48:42] from the dead
[1:48:44] my dad prayed and cast out the cancer
[1:48:47] out of my mom

[1:49:03] amen look at johnny's face sister look
[1:49:06] at look at the faith in that man
[1:49:07] all those testimonies now that faith
[1:49:11] that's in you is going to come down into
[1:49:13] children but you've got the bible said
[1:49:16] train them in the holy scripture train
[1:49:19] them up
[1:49:20] when they're old they won't depart from
[1:49:22] the faith
[1:49:24] right david where'd you get that faith
[1:49:27] um
[1:49:29] notice he didn't say great he didn't say
[1:49:30] grandpa he said great grandma
[1:49:33] huh a woman yeah god can use women oh
[1:49:36] yeah god can use women too yeah
[1:49:38] oh yeah yeah they're weaker vessels in
[1:49:42] some way but some way they got strengths
[1:49:44] that our brothers need right i need my
[1:49:48] wife to complete me
[1:49:50] i'm only half complete
[1:49:53] adam was only half of himself his other
[1:49:55] half was
[1:49:56] eve oh hallelujah
[1:50:01] i'm already over an hour aren't i yeah
[1:50:02] that's good
[1:50:06] i didn't preach very long last week so i
[1:50:08] got to preach a little bit longer today
[1:50:13] timothy where did you get such faith you
[1:50:14] follow the prophet paul so well
[1:50:17] my mom my mom taught me the word
[1:50:22] timothy you preached and you cast out
[1:50:24] devil and
[1:50:25] you prayed for the sick they recovered
[1:50:27] how did you do that well my grandma did
[1:50:28] my grandma prayed for me you know
[1:50:33] david could say the same thing how did
[1:50:36] you beat goliath well my great-grandma
[1:50:39] beat the whole nation of jericho
[1:50:42] praise the lord my grandma she took down
[1:50:45] the whole nation
[1:50:47] the great grandma took down the whole
[1:50:49] nation by faith amen
[1:50:52] by applying the token oh that's the
[1:50:55] token be applied to our lives amen
[1:50:58] apply it to your family apply to your
[1:51:00] children
[1:51:01] your home your car apply to this church
[1:51:04] let the blood be applied to everything
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:09] she just applied the token
[1:51:13] she was trusted in the holy spirit
[1:51:16] she just believed god's promise that's
[1:51:17] all she did and that same faith is in
[1:51:20] you
[1:51:21] oh hallelujah you know my aunt wrote a
[1:51:25] whole book about my grandpa's faith
[1:51:28] now they changed the names of it i need
[1:51:30] to read it but my grandpa had just
[1:51:32] tremendous faith
[1:51:34] tremendous faith the one time raising
[1:51:36] the dead
[1:51:37] one time he ran over his daughter she
[1:51:40] slipped out of the car
[1:51:41] he was in a hurry ran over her she was
[1:51:44] dead
[1:51:45] my aunt the option is their name she
[1:51:47] don't want me to stare at him
[1:51:49] they prayed for in the car driving the
[1:51:50] doctor by the time they got to the
[1:51:51] doctor
[1:51:52] the doctor was like nothing's wrong with
[1:51:54] her she's totally well
[1:51:56] she still had the mark of the car tire
[1:51:58] across her coat and dress
[1:52:01] that's a true story true story
[1:52:06] so church why do we why did joshua build
[1:52:08] up those 12 stones
[1:52:10] to remember amen to remember what god
[1:52:13] has done
[1:52:14] to let us know he's still the same if he
[1:52:16] did that for them
[1:52:18] in the 1950s he can do it for us in the
[1:52:20] 2020s amen
[1:52:22] because he's never changed the world
[1:52:25] changes but god never changes amen
[1:52:28] he's the same today now we don't want to
[1:52:31] see anybody get run over we don't
[1:52:32] see anyone get cancer but when these
[1:52:34] things happen may god raise up faith in
[1:52:36] our midst
[1:52:39] that the faith that was in our fathers
[1:52:41] and our grandmothers and our mothers
[1:52:43] will be used in us as well
[1:52:46] because some of this somehow this is
[1:52:47] passed down
[1:52:49] god's election amen god's election
[1:52:54] i just want to close with this now let
[1:52:57] me set my timer for closing here
[1:52:59] give me 10 minutes to close all right
[1:53:04] i don't want to worry about but i'm
[1:53:05] having a good time today
[1:53:08] pretty good today every place
[1:53:11] is yours if you'll fight for it
[1:53:15] now i'm preaching to myself because i i
[1:53:18] know i need to fight better
[1:53:20] right i have days where i'm discouraged
[1:53:23] don't feel real spiritual
[1:53:25] but that's what this is for praise god
[1:53:28] that's what this is for it's the romance
[1:53:30] is a hospital
[1:53:32] you come to church to get healed come to
[1:53:34] church to get encouraged
[1:53:35] amen corrected right helped out healed
[1:53:41] the bible said every place every not
[1:53:44] some
[1:53:46] every place where you step your foot
[1:53:49] any place you feel led to go the bible
[1:53:51] said i've given it to you
[1:53:56] not some every
[1:54:00] now i'm going to balance this out i'm
[1:54:01] not preaching prosperity gospel
[1:54:03] although i do believe in spiritual
[1:54:04] prosperity and the bible says if you
[1:54:06] believe the prophets you'll prosper
[1:54:07] so there's i guess there's a message or
[1:54:11] there's a real prosperity gospel that's
[1:54:12] that's a true gospel not the way they're
[1:54:15] teaching it
[1:54:16] everybody's a millionaire if you don't
[1:54:17] have a private jet you're not you know
[1:54:19] you don't have faith that's a bunch of
[1:54:20] nonsense
[1:54:20] that's from hell but i'm talking about
[1:54:23] every place because
[1:54:24] the bible says we are blessed with
[1:54:29] not some church we're blessed with all
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:33] spiritual blessings
[1:54:36] in christ jesus let that sink in for a
[1:54:38] little bit
[1:54:39] god wants to give you a blessing
[1:54:42] in every area of your life remember
[1:54:46] don't forget
[1:54:46] god still has martyrs in all this right
[1:54:48] stephen was a martyr yeah
[1:54:50] he had all spiritual blessings so that
[1:54:52] we can never forget that
[1:54:58] but all spiritual blessings
[1:55:01] are offered to us wherever you place
[1:55:04] your foot
[1:55:06] wherever you say this is mine
[1:55:12] this is mine
[1:55:15] this is mine we should get our bibles
[1:55:18] out right and go
[1:55:19] this is mine this is mine
[1:55:23] amen this is mine and i can't keep my
[1:55:25] balance
[1:55:26] this is mine every place where we place
[1:55:29] our foot
[1:55:29] every blood you want to see in our lives
[1:55:32] we can say
[1:55:33] this is mine if it be god's will
[1:55:37] if
[1:55:42] the bible said we're given all spiritual
[1:55:44] blessings see
[1:55:45] up in the heavenlies in spiritual places
[1:55:48] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:55:51] peter said god has given us all things
[1:55:55] that god has to say i'm not going to
[1:55:56] answer that
[1:55:56] because that's not going to make you
[1:55:58] godly glory
[1:56:01] but everything that will make us walk in
[1:56:04] god's life
[1:56:05] and will make us more godly i've given
[1:56:08] you all them
[1:56:09] but they're all given by promise
[1:56:16] in other words if you want it i promise
[1:56:18] it to you
[1:56:19] you're not going to get it right away
[1:56:21] but you're going to get it
[1:56:22] eventually it's a promise
[1:56:26] i promise i'll do this i promise
[1:56:29] i'll give you every good thing that will
[1:56:33] make you more godly how many how many
[1:56:35] people appreciate that promise
[1:56:39] i'm giving you every promise that you
[1:56:41] need for your life
[1:56:43] to make you more godly sometimes it's
[1:56:47] hard promises right sometimes it's hard
[1:56:48] road
[1:56:49] to get to that promise but god said i'm
[1:56:52] doing
[1:56:52] all of it to make you more godly
[1:56:56] look at brother brown what was his last
[1:56:58] major battle the complex
[1:57:01] right he had to get to a spot where he
[1:57:03] wasn't upset with the people rejecting
[1:57:05] him anymore
[1:57:06] so god had to send an angel to correct
[1:57:09] him
[1:57:10] he said if you do go up in the mountains
[1:57:12] your wife will leave you
[1:57:14] so he finally reached i said this he
[1:57:17] finally reached the promise of
[1:57:18] contentment despite being rejected
[1:57:20] he was a people pleaser he even said it
[1:57:23] you don't like to you like to please the
[1:57:24] people i read it to you out of it as it
[1:57:25] was with moses
[1:57:26] that's why he let them pull the gifts
[1:57:28] and do all the gifts rather than praying
[1:57:29] for all the thousands
[1:57:31] i'm that way some of it many of us are
[1:57:33] that way right we just want
[1:57:34] people to be happy sometimes we make
[1:57:36] mistakes
[1:57:38] but by the end he learned contentment
[1:57:41] and he would go to any church right and
[1:57:43] preach to any size crowd
[1:57:44] because he was content he wasn't going
[1:57:46] to run from the commission
[1:57:48] he was going to fulfill the commission
[1:57:51] something he had to learn it was a
[1:57:54] blessing
[1:57:56] it was a spiritual promise but it was a
[1:57:58] battle
[1:58:00] where he almost gave up a battle
[1:58:05] against the complex well if they won't
[1:58:07] hear my preaching
[1:58:08] then they don't have to hear me preach
[1:58:09] i'll just quit
[1:58:12] right but instead of giving up thank god
[1:58:16] god in his mercy sent the angel amen to
[1:58:19] correct him god will always send his
[1:58:20] children correction
[1:58:22] as many as i love i rebuke and jason
[1:58:25] thank you if you really want to be
[1:58:27] righteous
[1:58:28] church if you and i really want
[1:58:29] godliness god will bring it to us
[1:58:32] but it's going to come through a promise
[1:58:35] see we're partakers of the divine nature
[1:58:37] through the precious promises
[1:58:40] paul said he's freely given us all
[1:58:43] things that pertain unto
[1:58:45] life and godliness in other words god
[1:58:49] will not let something happen to you
[1:58:51] unless it's going to help you be more
[1:58:52] godly
[1:58:55] praise the lord amen
[1:58:59] now this is just telling us we are not
[1:59:02] lazy christians
[1:59:04] hallelujah but we follow them who
[1:59:07] through faith and patience
[1:59:09] inherited the promises praise god
[1:59:14] that should be our prayer today right
[1:59:17] because we all have promises we want i
[1:59:18] could list you
[1:59:19] about 20 promises give me five minutes i
[1:59:23] can probably list about 50 of them
[1:59:25] rapture mom save dad save you know
[1:59:28] full-time pastor i could listen to about
[1:59:29] 50
[1:59:30] things probably within five minutes but
[1:59:32] the bible says between getting the
[1:59:34] promise now some of those i got to make
[1:59:35] sure those god's promised or not
[1:59:38] right is that god did god promise me
[1:59:40] that i might be hoping for that like we
[1:59:42] said earlier
[1:59:43] but is god promising me that
[1:59:46] that's the difference that's a great
[1:59:47] difference
[1:59:50] see we are not lazy but we are going to
[1:59:53] follow
[1:59:54] those who showed faith and patience and
[1:59:57] if you've got faith you're going to have
[1:59:59] what
[1:59:59] works like abraham
[2:00:04] abraham called those things not as
[2:00:07] though they were because he had a
[2:00:08] revelation of god's will for his life
[2:00:10] don't throw away your confidence don't
[2:00:12] give up on god how many can say amen to
[2:00:14] that amen
[2:00:15] that's all say i'm not giving up on god
[2:00:16] ready i'm not giving up on god let's say
[2:00:19] it again ready
[2:00:20] i'm not giving up on god i've got
[2:00:22] confidence in god's word
[2:00:25] he's given a promise i'm believing it
[2:00:28] i'm going to be patient
[2:00:30] until he brings it to pass
[2:00:34] but ye bride of christ fellowship have
[2:00:37] need of patience that
[2:00:38] after you've done the will of god with
[2:00:40] your works
[2:00:42] you might receive the promise
[2:00:49] brother ram says every promise is yours
[2:00:53] but god will never give it to you if you
[2:00:55] lay back on
[2:00:56] bed of ease that's why we got to keep
[2:00:58] fasting and praying right we got to keep
[2:01:00] coming to church and reading our bibles
[2:01:02] and fighting against any worldly
[2:01:04] laziness right
[2:01:06] you'll fight for every inch you get he
[2:01:08] told joshua every place to sow your foot
[2:01:10] treads
[2:01:10] i've given you footprints footprints
[2:01:12] mean victory
[2:01:14] it's the same tonight if you're
[2:01:15] paralyzed and can't wiggle fingers say
[2:01:17] god i want to wiggle finger that's right
[2:01:19] you promised me i could do it i'll lay
[2:01:21] there and wiggle it
[2:01:23] till i do wiggle it that's right god
[2:01:25] made the promise
[2:01:27] me i could put my foot on the floor here
[2:01:28] it comes here comes yes lord it's coming
[2:01:31] just keep your keep on till you put your
[2:01:33] foot on the floor fight for every inch
[2:01:35] things is handed to you that's what the
[2:01:37] matter with the american people tonight
[2:01:39] got everything handed to you well fed
[2:01:42] fattened
[2:01:43] clothed everything else you don't have
[2:01:45] no need of nothing but you don't realize
[2:01:46] you're miserable
[2:01:47] wretched and bright blind that's not us
[2:01:49] right that's not we're not miserable
[2:01:50] wretched and blind
[2:01:52] we're full of faith we've got eyes that
[2:01:53] can see right we've got ears that can
[2:01:56] hear we got that eye salve on
[2:01:58] praise god we've got garments of white
[2:02:00] amen we've got
[2:02:02] gold right we got gold jesus christ like
[2:02:04] character amen
[2:02:06] we've got it but we need reminders to
[2:02:09] not get lazy
[2:02:12] then poor heathens over yonder don't
[2:02:14] have a change of clothes coming in the
[2:02:15] meeting
[2:02:16] tens of thousands perfectly nude let
[2:02:18] them set the word see the works of the
[2:02:20] holy spirit god's word made manifest
[2:02:21] they'll believe with all their heart and
[2:02:23] accept it they will accept it in virgin
[2:02:25] soil they accept in their heart
[2:02:27] because they believe it i believe that's
[2:02:28] the end let's stand to our feet
[2:02:29] musicians if you can come
[2:02:32] church we can't imagine what god will do
[2:02:35] for someone
[2:02:36] that has faith in his word
[2:02:43] what is god going to do if he tarries
[2:02:46] what is god again gonna do in the next
[2:02:47] five years
[2:02:50] if he terry's ten years imagine
