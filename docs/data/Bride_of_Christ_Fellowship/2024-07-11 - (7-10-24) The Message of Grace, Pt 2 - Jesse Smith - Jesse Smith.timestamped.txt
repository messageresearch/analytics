[1:28] can find people that post poed all the
[1:30] sermons of brother brandom and so it's
[1:32] very convenient then there's no
[1:33] commercials like on YouTube right unless
[1:35] you pay to get the commercials off uh
[1:37] it's a great place to go to get sermons
[1:39] if you want there's a certain podcast
[1:40] just look up William Brandon sermons
[1:42] there's numerous podcasts that they just
[1:43] have the the sermons from Brother brand
[1:46] without any commercials so that's that
[1:48] could be a real help to you by God's
[1:49] grace so try not to read ahead of me I
[1:51] know it's hard you know I don't I don't
[1:52] expect you to be be perfect you know
[1:54] but now you kind of see what I preach
[1:56] off of when I don't use a PowerPoint
[1:58] this is kind of what I preach off of I
[2:00] do like a a headline what I want to say
[2:02] and then uh I'll give you the quote or
[2:04] something where it's found and uh I'm
[2:07] just got to make sure I touch it I think
[2:09] every 15 minutes so it doesn't uh leave
[2:12] off of the screen Mirrors by God's grace
[2:15] so we left off last week you know last
[2:17] week we left off with brother R's Vision
[2:20] that he had right he had a vision of the
[2:21] three rainbows Austin caught it those
[2:23] three rain rainbows represent father son
[2:25] Holy Ghost Hallelujah remember that by
[2:27] God's grace he caught that I I I caught
[2:30] that right after service I was like
[2:31] wonderful brother uh that was the
[2:33] revelation of Jesus Christ Jehovah the
[2:36] Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new
[2:38] and brother remember brother said God
[2:40] gave him that to encourage him because
[2:42] the godhead teaching was so attacked and
[2:45] friends it's still attacked today right
[2:47] the people that have left the message uh
[2:49] they're so bold now to call us Heretics
[2:51] and uh but it's just ridiculous if you
[2:54] just think about it the Trinity Dogma
[2:55] wasn't even formed until about 300 some
[2:58] years after the last I'm sorry no I'm
[3:00] sorry it would have been about 200 some
[3:02] years after the last Apostle died
[3:04] because John died around 100 AD and then
[3:06] of course the Ning counil uh 3:25 but me
[3:10] remember friends the Holy Ghost wasn't
[3:12] considered a third person until 381 ad
[3:15] amen so 281 years after John died they
[3:19] finally decided the Holy Ghost is a is a
[3:21] person well we they would have known the
[3:23] whole time the Holy Ghost is a person
[3:24] it's God amen amen it's not a third
[3:27] person it's the person of God Amen just
[3:29] with us it's God uh dwelling in our
[3:32] souls and ministering to our Spirits
[3:34] it's the same God hallelujah but you
[3:36] know I've been called a heretic cuz I'm
[3:37] not a trinitarian that's fine just like
[3:39] Paul said the way they call heresy
[3:41] that's the way I worship the god of my
[3:43] fathers I'm talking about spiritual
[3:45] fathers brother William my grandpa and
[3:47] my dad didn't serve God in the message
[3:49] amen but it's my spiritual fathers like
[3:51] Paul told a grippa Hallelujah that's how
[3:54] we serve God Amen and we say just with
[3:56] the word of God every time I've
[3:58] challenged them and they have nothing to
[3:59] say they they have no other scripture
[4:01] there's no scripture that says God's
[4:02] three persons and there's two persons
[4:04] friends be encouraged we're standing on
[4:06] the word of God hallelujah always be
[4:08] encouraged that's always take it back to
[4:09] that the water baptism the godhead go
[4:11] back to the scriptures and we will find
[4:14] that our our foundation is a solid rock
[4:17] hallelujah we dig down into the
[4:19] scriptures until we find a solid rock
[4:21] hallelujah and then that's what our life
[4:23] is founded on then when the storms of
[4:25] life come we don't get toss and our
[4:27] house doesn't get torn down our house
[4:29] stands Hallelujah because we're founded
[4:31] on a rock and it's going to become into
[4:33] more play as we approach the end time
[4:36] what I mean is those that leave the
[4:37] message they might get uh they might the
[4:39] the storms of the One World System the
[4:41] storms of the World Council churches
[4:43] might blow over their house and they
[4:45] might get taken into that Pope worship
[4:47] but our houses will stand by the grace
[4:49] of God hallelujah because we know in
[4:52] whom we have believed amen hallelujah we
[4:54] know who's going to keep our souls
[4:56] hallelujah it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:58] Hallelujah because we stand on the word
[4:59] of God not bow to the we will not bow to
[5:02] the daughters of the mother hearted
[5:04] either by the grace of God and I just
[5:06] thought you know I just thought some of
[5:08] these things might encourage you I'm
[5:10] about as I've listened I think I'm about
[5:12] 35 minutes into this 2hour uh and so
[5:15] many minute
[5:16] sermon he only preaches really about an
[5:19] hour uh but then there's like uh there's
[5:21] like 30 some minutes of a preliminary
[5:24] and there's like an hour afterwards
[5:25] where he's building up the people for
[5:27] the prayer line it's quite a wonderful
[5:29] message
[5:30] uh but I just thought you might like
[5:31] this here brother BR he was brother
[5:34] tells us here he shows his Humanity
[5:36] brother brandham worried about his loved
[5:38] ones being
[5:39] lost and he had to do things to keep his
[5:42] mind off of worrying sound familiar to
[5:45] anybody right amen he had to go make
[5:48] himself busy so he didn't worry about
[5:50] his siblings being lost or his his
[5:53] uncles and ants here he tells us this
[5:54] right here he says something struck me
[5:57] I've never been able to get away with it
[5:59] to see that hour We're living I know
[6:00] it's so small again I can't zoom in this
[6:02] this app this app doesn't let me zoom in
[6:04] so I'm very
[6:06] sorry I didn't mean to do that uh I want
[6:09] to go now look I want to go somewhere or
[6:11] do something else keep it off my mind I
[6:13] got too many loved one that's
[6:16] unsaved knowing what can I do to get
[6:19] them saved what is there I can
[6:25] do now I love this because brother Adam
[6:27] loved his family so much he wanted to to
[6:29] do something to get them Sav but he
[6:31] realized there's nothing he could do
[6:33] right right unless he was directed by
[6:35] God Amen Hallelujah he says I preach the
[6:39] gospel I can say the same God has done
[6:41] great signs and wonders like he's never
[6:43] done since the world since the days of
[6:44] the Lord Jesus of course he's talking
[6:46] about the discernment right because no
[6:48] other man had that discernment like
[6:49] brother Brandon it was a Messianic gift
[6:52] right sign of the Messiah it was Jesus
[6:54] anointing brother BR to do the works of
[6:56] Jesus Amen because the Gentiles had
[6:58] never had that son of man sign before
[7:00] the Jews and the Samaritans did in John
[7:02] 1 and John 4 I taught that months ago in
[7:04] a second
[7:06] service that's kind of like an
[7:07] elementary
[7:08] teaching he says uh he says and around
[7:12] the world it's went and still the world
[7:14] continually gets worse but then I have
[7:16] to remember that we're living in leoan
[7:17] church age where they'll get worse and
[7:19] it said they
[7:21] would so brother said there's two things
[7:23] he said I got to remember it's Leia it's
[7:25] just going to get worse and second thing
[7:28] in other words I've got to commit this
[7:29] to God I get I got to get my mind I
[7:31] can't allow myself to worry and the
[7:33] church said see that's why I love this
[7:35] brother R was human he worried I shared
[7:38] that quote with the church brother R

[7:54] human nature of course that's going to
[7:56] happen to me praise God yeah because I'm

[8:00] through the trials Hallelujah I can't be
[8:02] pushed through a pipe I got to go

[9:57] this is the time so we must do that
[9:58] praise God
[9:59] amen
[10:02] amen and now brother says he told us why
[10:04] he chose to preach on Grace he said it
[10:07] was another topic he was attacked
[10:10] on he me and he mentions it later on
[10:13] we'll get to that he said I chose this
[10:15] morning being that that message was so
[10:17] attacked the the godhead message another
[10:20] thing that I'm so uh gotten after about
[10:23] is preaching Grace so I want to preach
[10:25] this morning as I read fourth chapter of
[10:28] Zechariah a p portion of it now he reads
[10:31] 1 through 7 and then he says do you see
[10:33] so I ask the church tonight do you see
[10:35] brother said the message will not come
[10:37] by great mights or Powers but by the
[10:40] spirit of God Amen right amen so The
[10:44] Headstone in other words the Rapture
[10:46] won't happen by some message movement
[10:49] right or some great message Man or some
[10:51] great message church it's going to come
[10:53] by the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God
[10:56] it's going to come by the grace of God
[10:58] by the Holy Spirit and if you're in tune
[11:00] with the Holy Spirit you'll be ready
[11:02] praise God so just stay in tune with the
[11:05] Holy Spirit the church
[11:06] said stay in tuned remember one of the
[11:09] jobs of the spirit is to bring
[11:11] conviction of sin yes what's that
[11:16] verse
[11:18] uh I don't want to risk switching
[11:24] up Jesus said maybe I can just find it
[11:29] Jesus said he would convict the and the
[11:31] word is
[11:33] conviction let me see if I can find it
[11:35] real
[11:37] quick the job of the Holy Spirit if
[11:39] anybody can find it let me know there's
[11:41] three things that he was going to do
[11:43] bring conviction there it is amen
[11:45] hallelujah I love this I love that's why
[11:47] I stay with the same Bible brother
[11:48] William because I know where it is I can
[11:49] see it in my mind but I just got to get
[11:51] to the right page John John 16:7
[11:54] Hallelujah nevertheless I I tell you the
[11:56] truth it's expedient for you that I go
[11:59] away for if I go not away the comforter
[12:01] will not come unto you but if I depart I
[12:03] will send him unto you Hallelujah Jesus
[12:06] had to leave so then that the Holy Ghost
[12:08] could be in each one of our hearts
[12:09] praise God you ought to be so thankful
[12:12] if the Holy Ghost is in your heart
[12:13] hallelujah amen amen verse eight and
[12:16] when he's come here it is he'll reprove
[12:18] the world of sin now this happened at
[12:21] the altar a number of times this weekend
[12:22] when I was preaching I told these people
[12:24] I said the the reason you feel
[12:27] conviction for your sin that's proof the
[12:29] Holy Ghost is anointing you right now
[12:33] am right because when when we sin and we
[12:36] don't make it right what happens our
[12:37] conscience gets
[12:39] seared and we don't feel that conviction
[12:42] anymore now you and I you know it just
[12:44] as well as I do if we do something wrong
[12:46] our heart's beating really hard because
[12:47] we know we shouldn't do it but if we
[12:50] don't repent of that and next time it's
[12:51] easier and easier to do it and the
[12:53] church
[12:54] said right well R said a critical spirit
[12:57] haunted him that means he knew he' been
[12:59] critical numerous times and he just
[13:01] couldn't get over it right he knew he
[13:04] knew he needed intercession from God
[13:05] Amen I think church if you need if you
[13:07] need help from God God's here to give it
[13:09] to you praise God God doesn't want us to
[13:12] walk in defeat God doesn't want to walk
[13:14] us to walk without feeling the the the
[13:16] sensitivity of the Holy Spirit the
[13:18] correction of the Holy Spirit God wants
[13:20] us to feel it and God wants us to
[13:22] correct or or receive the reproving or
[13:25] the conviction of the Holy Ghost
[13:26] hallelujah it's that simple if you you
[13:29] feel convicted of sin that's the spirit
[13:31] of God
[13:33] hallelujah that's not well that's my
[13:35] conscience well it's the spirit of God
[13:36] anointing your conscious amen
[13:40] hallelujah I told those people those the
[13:42] ones that were confessing their sin I
[13:43] said that's proof the Holy Ghost has not
[13:45] forsaken you you still feel bad about it
[13:49] right you don't got to reprobate mind
[13:50] and God's giving you over to sin and God
[13:52] just let you believe a lie that you'll
[13:53] be damned by it and the church said amen
[13:56] the very fact you feel the weight of sin
[13:58] and you feel sorry for your sin that's
[14:00] proof the Holy Ghost is with you
[14:02] Hallelujah just got to get over that
[14:04] stronghold amen just got to tear down
[14:07] that stronghold by the word of God
[14:09] hallelujah amen amen that's right we
[14:13] seen him come down this weekend by God's
[14:14] grace
[14:17] Hallelujah one I'll just share a few few
[14:19] strongholds were lies some people
[14:21] confess lies that that that they' had
[14:23] for years amongst family
[14:25] members oh another one was stealing
[14:27] money
[14:29] years another one was
[14:33] pornography right another one is uh well
[14:36] that's probably the three right there
[14:37] that I can remember by God's grace yeah
[14:39] I think that's the three but they just
[14:41] those sins would lay there for years and
[14:44] then God has to send a humble little
[14:46] preacher like who am I I'm nobody right
[14:48] I go over there and preach the Waters of
[14:49] Separation remember that from numbers 19
[14:52] if something died in your house you
[14:53] couldn't go worship until you were
[14:56] sprinkled and made clean right remember
[14:59] that that's a great Revelation yeah in
[15:01] other words you won't even get there I
[15:03] said I said spiritually people can come
[15:05] to church and they don't feel anything
[15:07] because something died in their home
[15:09] they're enjoying sin and they're not
[15:11] confessing of the sin
[15:13] amen that's a quite a revelation from
[15:15] the Holy Ghost I thank God for that
[15:17] Revelation amen because it brings people
[15:19] up in Repentance and
[15:20] tears after years of uh uh years of of
[15:25] harboring sin and not confessing
[15:28] stealing
[15:29] uh pornography and
[15:32] ly and that I said the very fact you're
[15:34] repenting of this that proves God is
[15:36] still with you hallelujah boy I tell you
[15:39] they really weep their way to the Cross
[15:40] amen I really enjoyed that I don't like
[15:43] to be too detailed but they all this not
[15:45] coming out of their nose that's just
[15:46] that's just my way of uh maybe it's too
[15:48] little gross for you but to me it's like
[15:49] that's a real sincerity right there by
[15:51] God's word unashamed amen unashamed the
[15:54] presence of God hallelujah if Jesus
[15:56] could die on the cross for us what's the
[15:58] least we can do is weep at the altar for
[16:00] him hallelujah amen if he became a mess
[16:02] on the cross we ought to become messy
[16:04] for the word of God
[16:07] hallelujah Glory so see that now I'm I'm
[16:11] I lost my or left my text uh John 168
[16:14] what is he going to do he's going to
[16:15] convict the world of sin and of
[16:17] righteousness and of judgment see the
[16:19] Holy Ghost is going to convict you this
[16:20] is righteous this is unrighteous that's
[16:22] true and then he's going to convict you
[16:24] of judgment remember Jesus said uh judge
[16:26] all things a spirit Paul said a
[16:28] spiritual man judges all things amen the
[16:31] Holy Ghost will help you judge things in
[16:33] your life is this righteous is this
[16:35] right or wrong it'll help you judge
[16:37] spirits and also convict you of sin
[16:39] hallelujah amen
[16:43] amen of sin because they believe not on
[16:46] me of righteous because I go to my
[16:48] father and you see me no more of
[16:50] judgment because the prince of this
[16:52] world is judged amen amen hallelujah
[16:55] amen brother R said I love this quote
[16:57] brother R said the foolish
[16:59] virgin is already saved he said even if
[17:02] they don't listen to me he said the
[17:03] foolish virgin is already saved because
[17:05] the word's already been judged in other

[20:28] Council
[20:29] and see they had to go through something
[20:31] in order to bring about the Exodus we're
[20:33] going to have to go through something to
[20:34] go about the Exodus hallelujah we're
[20:37] going to have to endure something some
[20:38] level of a squeeze I read you that there
[20:41] yeah this sermon has the prophecy where
[20:43] it actually says a a little persecution
[20:45] will come upon the church so whatever
[20:48] you call it pressure or persecution we
[20:50] know it's not wrath amen that's one
[20:53] thing we know we've already passed from

[21:05] no condemnation to them that are in
[21:07] Christ Jesus hallelujah amen who walk
[21:09] after the spirit and not the flesh amen
[21:12] amen hallelujah amen now this is a
[21:15] beautiful thing if you haven't heard
[21:16] this in a while a brother as a brother
[21:18] online asked me to make a video about it
[21:19] I said well I got to wait till the right
[21:21] time I don't know if this is the time
[21:24] but brother now he's read his text right
[21:27] out of Zechariah now he's start talking
[21:28] about zerubabel anybody remember
[21:30] zerubabel yeah he was the first prince
[21:33] to lead uh 42,000 Jews out of Babylon
[21:37] back to Israel crossing the desert how
[21:41] would you been like the leader of a
[21:42] family of 42,000 people zable did that I
[21:46] wouldn't like that assignment
[21:48] everybody's looking at him zable what
[21:50] you GNA do Z you know his name means
[21:52] born in Babylon that's what we were we
[21:53] were born in Babylon but God's got a a
[21:56] restoration for us amen we're born in
[21:59] Babylon but God is going to help us to
[22:01] restore and finish the temple of God
[22:04] Amen the statue of perfect man amen the
[22:07] body of Christ amen God's going to help
[22:09] us to be at the top amen God's going to
[22:11] help us to be ready for the coming of
[22:13] The Headstone Hallelujah that's what
[22:15] this quote this that's what this quote
[22:16] is all
[22:19] about brother says zable had laid the
[22:23] foundation of the building so after uh
[22:27] Nebuchadnezzar
[22:28] uh destroyed Solomon's Temple they
[22:30] didn't have a temple for 70 years right
[22:33] and then zeruel comes back the first
[22:35] thing he builds is an altar so they can
[22:37] kill animals I wonder if the Jews today
[22:40] will do that
[22:41] first because they could draw from that
[22:44] inspiration okay yeah I've always been
[22:46] told Brother William that they won't
[22:47] sacrifice until they get an actual
[22:49] Temple but they could actually draw seem
[22:51] like they could draw inspiration from
[22:54] zerubabel because they they first built
[22:56] the Altar and then they started
[22:57] sacrificing then they laid the
[22:59] foundation of the temple and then they
[23:01] had to finish the temple but they were
[23:03] already sacrificing the being that's
[23:04] interesting I never just thought about
[23:05] that right now sorry just added my
[23:07] thoughts to this sermon this is like
[23:08] extra thoughts there by God's grace he
[23:11] said now how many we do this thing I
[23:13] want you to put on your spiritual
[23:14] thinking you're anointing jacket go and
[23:16] put your anointing jackets on here all
[23:18] right that's a brother and S this
[23:20] morning as we think yeah I better put
[23:23] mine on too by way I don't want to miss
[23:25] the anointing here by God's grace
[23:27] brother said this great Prince had
[23:29] determined to rebuild the house of the
[23:30] Lord and then when he did he laid the
[23:32] foundation stone right and we know Jesus
[23:34] Christ is the Cornerstone right amen the
[23:36] Jews stumbled him over but we don't
[23:38] stumble him over him Hallelujah the
[23:40] Bible say we fall on him he doesn't fall
[23:41] on us that's right other words we our
[23:44] whole life Falls at the altar right we
[23:45] just we give Jesus Jesus take my whole
[23:48] life amen I fall on you I'm in your
[23:51] hands do with me whatever you want I'm
[23:53] all yours Jesus
[23:55] amen I fall on you Jesus amen amen
[24:01] hallelujah he said now zuub laid the
[24:04] foundation stone which he did and he'll
[24:06] also bring forth The Headstone that's
[24:08] what the vers is that we read about I
[24:10] want you to notice he never said he'll
[24:11] bring forth the Cornerstone he'll bring
[24:12] forth The Headstone now we know the
[24:14] scripture said Jesus Christ Chief
[24:15] Cornerstone he's also the headstone now
[24:18] if we'll think for a few minutes the
[24:21] seven Church age messenger was to
[24:24] restore the faith of the children back
[24:26] to the fathers amen so brother is saying
[24:29] zerubabel was a type of him that's right
[24:33] Zer was had to finish the temple and
[24:35] he's saying see the seven Church age
[24:37] messenger has to finish the mystery of
[24:39] God pretty good type right pretty good
[24:42] type now it's not a perfect type right
[24:44] because Paul laid the foundation how
[24:46] many remember that for the Bible Paul
[24:48] said I'm a wise master builder and I
[24:50] laid the
[24:51] foundation so see it's not a perfect
[24:54] type it's a partial type if it was a
[24:57] perfect type then brother Brandon would
[24:59] have laid the foundation and brother
[25:00] Brandon would have brought the the capso
[25:02] message right is that right can see that
[25:05] Amen brother BR did not lay the
[25:07] foundation brother R restored it by
[25:08] God's grac amen He restored uh the word
[25:11] the Revelation right the understanding
[25:13] of the Bible he finished the mystery of
[25:16] God so see it's not a perfect type and
[25:19] that's so if I make a video at the
[25:20] brother's request I have to say that
[25:22] this is not a perfect type it's a
[25:23] partial
[25:26] type he said in other words rebuild the
[25:29] church again under the power of the
[25:31] spirit not by power not by might but by
[25:34] my spirit sayith the Lord not by
[25:36] organization amen not by denomination
[25:39] but by the Holy Spirit God will bring
[25:40] forth the church in the last days amen
[25:44] amen now don't forget the verses there's
[25:46] in my book I wrote six verses brother R
[25:49] fulfilled okay I'll see if I can
[25:51] remember of them Malachi 45 and6 right
[25:54] he turned the hearts of the children
[25:56] back to the fathers amen John the
[25:59] Baptist turn the hearts of the fathers
[26:00] to the children right remember turning
[26:02] the heart means opening the heart and
[26:05] the heart now is open to the word of God
[26:07] you repented and now you're going to
[26:09] serve God hallelujah all right Luke
[26:12] 17:30 the son of man the days of the son
[26:13] of man Jesus uh anointing brother
[26:16] brandom in a prophetic Ministry to the
[26:18] Gentiles as it was days of lot days of
[26:21] Sodom we gone through that uh I did Amos
[26:23] 3:7 and8 when a lion roars who who who
[26:26] will but fear it's a prophet of God
[26:29] hallelujah God Reveals His his Mysteries
[26:31] to his servants the prophets amen that's
[26:34] the only one who gets a mystery amen
[26:36] amen is his servant the prophets and
[26:38] some people say brother R didn't uh give
[26:40] us any Revelation any secret things yes
[26:42] he did he gave us the Seven Seals amen
[26:45] there his his his interpretation of the
[26:47] Seven Seals was different than anybody
[26:49] else's by far it's not even close and
[26:52] I'm glad God led me to study that praise
[26:54] Goden CU now they can't deceive me
[26:56] brother William Jesus said that let no
[26:58] man deceive you amen so what do you got
[27:01] to do you got to study your self
[27:02] approved unto God Amen Hallelujah that's
[27:05] how you do it amen you know you know men
[27:08] and women are out to deceive you so you
[27:10] better study your self approved
[27:12] Hallelujah that's right no so nobody can
[27:14] deceive me on these things because the
[27:16] Lord has shown me them hallelujah
[27:18] amen all right uh the other one is uh
[27:21] Acts 3 20 and 21 the Bible said Heaven
[27:26] Must receive Jesus until the restitution
[27:29] of all things so Jesus is going to sit
[27:31] on the throne until everything's
[27:32] restored am glory amen hallelujah and
[27:35] then once everything's restored that
[27:37] brother that last name on the book has
[27:39] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:41] then Jesus will step off and'll come and
[27:43] snatch his bride off the Earth in the
[27:46] meeting of the air say honey it's time

[28:41] come and restore all things but I say
[28:43] Elias is already come already and they
[28:45] did not recognize it so he recognizes
[28:47] two Elijah Ministries there's going to
[28:49] come Elijah to restore but Elijah the
[28:52] other Elijah of Malachi 46 already came
[28:55] oh it's beautiful praise God Amen

[35:35] is you can find Zephaniah it's right
[35:37] after Zephaniah
[35:43] Hallelujah probably find uh Daniel
[35:47] numerous books after Daniel Hagi chapter
[35:52] 2 go to verse three Hagi 2:3 now I want
[35:55] to just bring this thought about zeru I
[35:56] just felt L of the Holy Spirit uh this
[35:59] has been on my heart for over I think
[36:00] maybe a
[36:03] year now you
[36:06] know we'll go back to three but let's
[36:08] read verse 9 here's the reason I'm
[36:09] reading verse n the glory of this latter
[36:10] house should be greater than that of the
[36:12] former sayith the Lord of host and in
[36:14] this place will I get peace say the Lord
[36:15] of hosts now this was
[36:18] spoken uh when zerubabel laid the found
[36:22] I'm sorry when zerubu was this
[36:23] Foundation sorry pardon me the temples
[36:29] okay so I don't remember this if this
[36:30] was the finishing of the house it might
[36:31] have been the finishing of the house
[36:33] yeah yeah yeah this the finishing of the
[36:35] house
[36:36] okay so uh you know the message people
[36:39] that call themselves the goats they'll
[36:41] use that verse and they'll say the glory
[36:44] of the latter is greater than the former
[36:47] and they're calling themselves the
[36:48] latter the latter Temple so they're
[36:52] greater in glory than every other Church
[36:54] age I've heard them say it
[36:56] church but listen I don't want to
[36:57] condemn them because I was listening to
[36:59] a sermon sister Zer shared that sermon
[37:01] with me from 2007 and a preacher said uh
[37:04] Paul couldn't live in this day cuz he
[37:05] didn't have what it takes and so we're
[37:07] stronger than Paul and I heard myself
[37:09] say amen I just told on
[37:12] myself did y'all catch
[37:14] that and I was so immature I said amen
[37:18] but now I'd
[37:19] say I wouldn't say anything I just
[37:24] smed pretend like I'm trying to agree
[37:27] okay so see I I grown I
[37:30] grown Hallelujah I grown Paul could live
[37:33] Paul could live in
[37:34] anything because he labored more because
[37:36] of the grace of God Amen Grace amen it's
[37:40] Grace amen he said not I but Grace
[37:42] Within Me praise
[37:44] God laboring grace amen hallelujah
[37:47] brother calls it so now now that you
[37:50] understand that let's go up to verse
[37:51] three who is left among you that saw
[37:53] this house in her first Glory that's
[37:55] speaking of Solomon's house amen
[37:58] now let me go to that
[37:59] picture all right got that now Solomon's
[38:03] house was large but it was nothing
[38:05] compared to this Millennial that we're
[38:06] going to get by God's
[38:08] grace it's about uh 2/3 or 34s of a
[38:13] football field pretty big pretty big
[38:17] what a
[38:18] house he says uh and how do you see it
[38:20] now is it not your eyes in comparison as
[38:22] it is
[38:24] nothing okay now we'll get to this in a
[38:26] little bit too uh
[38:28] so here's artist idea of Zero's house
[38:31] the only Dimensions we have is that it's
[38:34] 60 by
[38:37] 60 right uh yeah 60 high and 60 wides
[38:41] I'm not sure even how they drew this it
[38:42] looks like 60 high but that's not 60
[38:44] wide um but that I read that that is
[38:47] true Ezra 63 okay so the people were
[38:51] looking at this house of zual and said
[38:53] Remember the young people were shouting
[38:54] they're like praise God we got a house
[38:55] and the old people were like oh this is
[38:57] such to debacle and God said don't
[39:00] despise the day of small things God
[39:03] works in Big things and God works in
[39:05] humility too amen God can work in a
[39:08] small Church like ours amen because God
[39:11] works in small things as well as great
[39:13] things
[39:14] Hallelujah God is no respector of big
[39:17] churches let's remind ourselves of that
[39:19] I need to always remind myself of that
[39:20] amen H
[39:22] Allelujah okay so let me go back so
[39:27] Solomon's was more it was made of gold
[39:29] all these things like that clearly
[39:30] clearly zal was not made of gold because
[39:34] the old guys were crying oh man this
[39:37] doesn't look nothing like it used to
[39:39] okay
[39:41] now if you would now go down to verse 6
[39:45] for thus sayi the Lord of hosts yet once
[39:46] it is a little while now look a little
[39:48] while and I will shake the heavens and
[39:50] the earth and the Sea and the dry land
[39:52] so
[39:53] everything what I'm trying to tell you
[39:55] is that the glory of the latter house is
[39:57] the millennial house not referring to us
[40:01] because if you were paying attention or
[40:02] I'm sure you were I'm sure but if you
[40:04] remember from the Millennium sermons
[40:06] you'll understand this is speaking of
[40:08] the Millennium yeah look at the context
[40:10] we're going to look at it right
[40:12] now look at verse 7 and I will shake All
[40:16] Nations and the desire of all Nations
[40:18] shall come has Jesus come back yet no no
[40:21] has all nations be been shook yet no
[40:23] China is still standing Russia is still
[40:25] standing us is still standing M all the
[40:28] nations have not been shaken and Jesus
[40:30] has come and I'll fill this house house
[40:32] with glory sayith the lord of hosts
[40:34] that's right amen amen the house is full
[40:38] right now zuo's house this house never
[40:41] got filled with God's glory so it wasn't
[40:43] referred to that one right and if you go
[40:45] study the Bible herod's house either
[40:48] herod's was much grander this never got
[40:50] even though Jesus was there and the
[40:52] fullness of God was in him the Bible
[40:54] never said that house would fill with
[40:56] his glory cuz they grieve the Holy
[40:58] Spirit yeah do it right so see you have
[41:01] to understand the context of things
[41:04] that's right you have to have brother
[41:06] said you got to find a little detail
[41:07] here a little detail there he's talking
[41:09] about that in the Revelation series 1961
[41:11] he said you got to look at every detail
[41:13] and put it together and then you'll
[41:15] understand what it's talking about
[41:16] praise God
[41:19] Amen verse eight the silver is mine the
[41:21] Gold is mine sayi the Lord of hosts the
[41:24] glory of this latter house shall be
[41:25] greater than the former sayith the Lord
[41:27] of hosts and in this place will I give
[41:29] peace sayith the Lord of hosts did they
[41:31] have peace in her Temple no no right
[41:35] they didn't have it so this is speaking
[41:37] the glory of the latter house wasn't
[41:39] actually it wasn't actually this house
[41:42] but it was the house of the millennial
[41:44] house amen amen amen because the Lord
[41:47] hadn't come yet the Nations hadn't been
[41:50] shook yet but he is coming hallelujah
[41:53] our King is coming to shake All Nations
[41:55] hallelujah praise God glory to God amen
[41:59] amen now this just for those that love
[42:01] details Solomon's uh house was 60 cubits
[42:06] and the breadth thereof 20 and the
[42:09] height 30 so 60
[42:12] long 20 wide and then 30 high that was
[42:16] Solomon's right and Solomon's was way
[42:19] greater than this
[42:20] one
[42:22] okay now few more details here church we
[42:26] got to know the cont context and see
[42:28] without the context they'll call
[42:30] themselves we're the greatest we're
[42:31] we're the greatest Church of all time
[42:33] we're the greatest of all the church
[42:34] ages
[42:36] impossible impossible remember brother
[42:39] said Jesus didn't give one compliment to
[42:41] the L Church anybody we didn't get one
[42:43] compliment of nothing amen right because
[42:46] we know it's like to live in this this
[42:48] is a hard time to live but God's grace
[42:50] is always sufficient
[42:52] Hallelujah there's still blood for this
[42:54] age Hallelujah there's still a flying
[42:56] eagle anointing for this age
[42:58] Hallelujah but Jesus did not give it one
[43:01] compliment brother tells us that when he
[43:03] preached
[43:04] it so see Church look look at look at
[43:06] the
[43:10] context this the latter house doesn't
[43:12] apply to context is the Millennium
[43:15] because Ezekiel 43:5 says the house will
[43:18] be filled God's glory that's when Jesus
[43:20] steps in the house that's the house I
[43:22] want to be in amen when Jesus himself
[43:25] steps in the house and sits down in the
[43:27] the ho of H that's the house I Want To
[43:29] Worship in Oh Brother William All Fall
[43:32] Down and imagine for a whole year it was
[43:34] just maybe I don't know I'm just making
[43:35] that up but amen imagine we'll just
[43:37] enjoy that for days and days worshiping
[43:40] Jesus the king is on the son of David is
[43:43] on the throne of David and of his
[43:45] kingdom there shall be no end Hallelujah
[43:48] and we get to be a part of that
[43:49] hallelujah amen sorry I'm so excited I
[43:51] guess I'm kind of going on for the
[43:52] weekend Services there by God's
[43:54] grace oh my
[43:57] look her's Temple was never filled the
[43:58] glory of God no verse says her's Temple
[44:00] was filled with the glory of God I said
[44:02] somebody Pro me wrong remember the Bible
[44:04] said the spirit took me up and brought
[44:05] me in the inner Court behold the glory
[44:06] of the Lord filled the
[44:08] house
[44:11] Hallelujah Zero's Temple never had a
[44:13] glory exceed Solomon's
[44:16] Glory now look God's spirit filled
[44:18] Solomon's house so the greater glory
[44:20] would only be in the Millennium because
[44:22] the house was larger and the GL the king
[44:25] of glory himself would sit in that house
[44:28] amen so in Solomon's house the Holy
[44:30] Ghost came in but in the millennial
[44:32] house Jesus comes in who's full of the
[44:36] Holy Ghost amen and he fills the house
[44:39] amen it's the Lord of glory amen it's
[44:42] God manifest In the Flesh it's Emmanuel
[44:45] God is with us hallelujah amen amen oh I
[44:49] love the word of God brother I love the
[44:50] word of God my God's word don't lie
[44:52] hallelujah amen the shaking of the
[44:55] Nations remember isn't until HEB Hebrews
[44:57] 12:26 and 27 MH the Bible said God will
[45:01] shake All Nations he he shall Shake All
[45:03] Nations but we've got a kingdom that
[45:05] cannot be moved what do we got we have a
[45:07] portion of the kingdom of God right now
[45:09] in our souls amen the kingdom of God is
[45:13] within you praise God Amen how do you
[45:16] know brother says because you keep the
[45:17] word of the king Amen brother said how
[45:19] you going to disagree with the King and
[45:21] be in his kingdom I love that it's just
[45:23] a simple teaching right you disagree
[45:26] with Jesus how you going to be in Jesus
[45:27] Kingdom you're not going to be right but
[45:29] we will be by God's grace I don't know
[45:31] what time I started but it's almost 8:00
[45:32] I guess I'll just start here stop right
[45:34] at 8:00 Lord willing everybody say
[45:36] everybody just hear that Lord willing by
[45:37] God's grace all right just trying
[45:40] to now and then brother R takes you know
[45:43] he takes that idea of the The Headstone
[45:46] and he goes to the Pyramid of
[45:50] Giza and uh here's what he says uh he
[45:54] said The Headstone was never put on the
[45:55] pyramid I've been there
[45:57] the architecture of it can never be
[45:59] replaced till this
[46:00] day we have no machines you realize that
[46:03] you have no machines one time I watched
[46:04] a video of the Chinese they tried to re
[46:07] do a reproduction with uh with machines
[46:09] and it was only like it was like 100 I I
[46:12] don't remember the fraction it was so
[46:14] tiny in comparison and Chinese are smart
[46:17] right all the scientists in America are
[46:19] smart you know all the scientists around
[46:20] the world are smart but they couldn't
[46:22] even get close with their machines to
[46:24] building something like this and
[46:25] remember this this pyramid L it it it
[46:28] stayed still through the flood yeah it
[46:31] was Rock St I mean I how you can say it
[46:35] his foundations couldn't be moved amen
[46:37] oh my it's a type of the Holy Ghost amen
[46:40] amen my
[46:42] goodness brother said it had to have
[46:44] Atomic power to move those stones now
[46:47] I've never been there but I heard
[46:48] brother Jason dears he said you should
[46:50] he was there last year he said you can't
[46:52] believe how big it is and how the stones
[46:54] are perfectly laid together and how cut
[46:57] perfectly even to this day lasting all
[46:59] those it would have been What U let's
[47:02] see Enoch would have been about 5,000
[47:04] years ago it's lasted that long
[47:10] Hallelujah and I want you to see this
[47:11] brother says I'm going to read this
[47:12] quote down here well said I don't
[47:15] believe in there such a thing like you
[47:16] say like the Zodiac or like the pyramid
[47:18] Doctrine and things so some Churches go
[47:21] too far on the Pyramid of Giza you know
[47:23] they try to look at all the steps in
[47:24] there and they try to you know they try
[47:26] to measure like the side of the one time
[47:29] they did a side they measure the side of
[47:31] one of the the pyramid there and they
[47:33] thought well each each foot represents a
[47:35] year so the Rapture is going to be in
[47:36] 2012 you remember that you remember that
[47:39] all these people they're trying to scare
[47:41] us boy they love this the devil loves to
[47:42] put fear on the church right amen I like
[47:45] that list uh uh it goes back to the year
[47:48] 2000 uh Y2K is going to kill you and
[47:50] then for every year there's something
[47:51] was going to kill you yet we're still
[47:53] here by God's grace amen hallelujah just
[47:56] trust in the Lord amen amen neoch to
[47:59] your
[48:01] understanding and I just like what
[48:02] brother man
[48:04] says now we believe Enoch built it
[48:07] because he was a type of the Rapture for
[48:10] the
[48:11] Gentiles now we get criticized by that
[48:15] but it's it's a lot easier to believe
[48:16] that than than what these accusers say
[48:19] that men actually Build It come on they
[48:21] can't even build it today right it was
[48:23] so easy why don't they build it today it
[48:26] was built Supernatural because it's a
[48:28] witness hallelujah it's a witness of the
[48:31] Rapture it's a witness of the stature
[48:33] for of man it's a witness of the seven
[48:35] Church agents amen and that pyramid is
[48:37] going to get capped off it needs a
[48:39] headstone Hallelujah it needs a Capstone
[48:41] in other words this church needs Jesus
[48:43] Christ to come back amen and he's going
[48:46] to come back and cap out the church and
[48:48] Grace will bring him back Grace will
[48:51] make us ready hallelujah amen amen the
[48:55] Pyramid of Giza is a wh of the pyramid
[48:57] shaped new city that is to come to the
[48:59] Earth even its location is a w a witness
[49:02] amen see because it's in it's an Egypt
[49:05] it's so close to
[49:09] Israel now he talks about Enoch but I'm
[49:11] just going to skip to
[49:12] this so the Pyramid of Giza is there
[49:15] look how close it is to
[49:17] Israel it's so close even that's a sign
[49:21] there's a verse in Isaiah I don't have
[49:22] it but there's a verse in Isa Isaiah
[49:24] that says that pyramid will be a signed
[49:25] to the Nations that's right I can't
[49:28] remember it now I need to look it up it
[49:29] just came to me now I didn't think of it
[49:30] while I was studying
[49:32] today but that's what it looks like I
[49:35] mean look look at these small people
[49:36] down here so Jason dears he's a preacher
[49:38] he like you just can't believe it you
[49:40] can't how could people nobody could
[49:41] build that right right it's just so
[49:44] massive so large and look that's where
[49:47] it is I mean uh it's there right there
[49:49] by Israel right where the fut right
[49:51] right where the millennial Temple's
[49:52] going to land and right where the new
[49:54] Jerusalem's going to come down amen amen
[49:56] it's right there as a witness it's a
[49:59] pyramid showing that there's a pyramid
[50:01] coming amen is that it is that right
[50:04] there it is amen I've been waiting for
[50:05] that the whole time it's a pyramid
[50:07] showing that there's someone coming back
[50:09] there's a headstone coming back to cap
[50:11] off this pyramid and there's a spiritual
[50:13] pyramid in New Jerusalem it's the
[50:15] bride's home hallelujah it's the it's
[50:17] the home of the Heavenly bride and the
[50:19] Earthly bridegroom that pyramid's coming
[50:22] down to this earth Hallelujah and we get
[50:24] to live in the city with Jesus amen amen

[51:30] that yes yes the Freemasons were trying
[51:33] to do a new order for the ages that's
[51:34] what that word I think that's what that
[51:36] one means if I'm not
[51:38] mistaken but brother just says he says
[51:41] God oh yeah this is God has favored our
[51:43] undertaking I'm not sure which one is
[51:45] that I don't remember which one but
[51:47] brother says look it's called a seal and
[51:49] even the Freemasons They're copying God
[51:52] we know they're off the word right right
[51:54] but even They're copying God the pyramid
[51:56] needs its its
[51:58] headstone and brother R said every
[52:00] dollar witnesses that Jesus Christ is
[52:02] coming back that's what brother Ram
[52:04] said amen amen hallelujah every dollar

[53:28] beings we all need to be cut by the
[53:31] power of the Holy Spirit oh yes we need
[53:33] to be cut so we fit in with the body of
[53:35] Jesus Christ amen amen remember they had
[53:38] their rough edges remember Peter had his
[53:39] rough edges I'm not eating with you
[53:41] Gentiles I'm not eating with you I'm
[53:44] afraid that these Jewish teachers are
[53:45] going to be uh not they're going to be
[53:47] upset with me right he wasn't perfect he
[53:50] had to be cut by Paul oh my glory help
[53:53] us Jesus send us the right preachers to
[53:55] cut us amen amen
[53:57] amen with
[53:59] me help the pastor be able to preach so
[54:01] it cuts me sometimes right I want to
[54:04] build your faith but sometimes everybody
[54:05] needs cut I need cut sometimes too it's
[54:08] nothing personal thank I mean it's
[54:10] personal between you and Jesus that's me
[54:12] it's that person with me a lot of times
[54:14] I don't even know what I'm preaching
[54:16] amen usually it's just a minor thing I
[54:18] just mentioned in past and that's what
[54:19] God uses to speak to
[54:24] somebody said the holy spirit is God
[54:26] great instrument and
[54:27] Tool the holy spirit is God's tool that
[54:31] we be joined as one person the Bible say
[54:33] be in one mind and one Accord we could
[54:35] all just come to church and have one
[54:37] thing in mind amen we want the Holy
[54:39] Ghost to move amen amen that would be
[54:41] that's the most powerful times we'll
[54:42] have
[54:44] yeah we're not
[54:46] divided we should be one person and it
[54:48] goes to show that no Machinery can do it
[54:50] that way it takes God to do that the
[54:53] pyramid but also the church that's right
[54:55] amen no mechanics of organization no
[54:57] loges none of these things can ever do
[54:59] it as good as their intentions are they
[55:01] can never do it because it takes God to
[55:03] do this the holy spirit amen and I just
[55:05] thought for good measure since we
[55:06] stopped by brandom
[55:08] Tabernacle I just thought I'd bring this
[55:10] up since he mentioned machines and
[55:12] Machinery I thought I'd bring this out
[55:14] brother William oh Hallelujah God can do
[55:16] whatever he wants to do well how do you
[55:17] know that brother Ram God won't leave
[55:19] his program that's the reason we know
[55:21] this day it's got to be simple see now
[55:23] he always works in Simplicity but God in
[55:25] the beginning could have made made the
[55:26] sun preach the gospel who knows where
[55:28] I'm going anybody read ahead or the
[55:31] winds preach the gospel or an angel
[55:33] preach the gospel but he ordained men
[55:36] for that purpose amen imperfect men who
[55:40] make mistakes like brother
[55:42] Jesse who sin sometimes like brother
[55:45] Jesse God ordained men to preach the
[55:48] gospel for that purpose and he never
[55:51] changes
[55:53] it amen church we went to those two went
[55:56] to the new brand Tabernacle and the old
[55:58] brandom Tabernacle and they're ghost
[56:01] towns you realize no one has worshiped
[56:03] there for over four years no one has

[56:11] can be back in the building and here we
[56:12] are four years
[56:14] later what kind of people what kind of
[56:16] leadership would let the Sheep not

[56:20] homes yeah and keep telling them just

[56:23] preachers oh you should only listen to
[56:25] God's voice and not these men mhm well

[58:03] of a simple family and a bunch of slaves
[58:05] oh my what a God he is unfolding himself
[58:07] in Simplicity amen oh my amen and you

[58:15] to have the right projector and the
[58:17] right screen so everybody can hear that
[58:19] machine perfectly look at all that man
[58:22] wisdom but what does God what does God
[58:23] hide himself in God hides himself in

[58:26] a man who spits and shouts and whatever
[58:29] you know Simon does whatever do with his
[58:30] beard you know whatever all our
[58:32] different mannerisms God hides himself
[58:34] in Simplicity and God can never change

[58:39] never change it he's the same yesterday
[58:41] today and forever hallelujah amen amen
[58:44] amen that's right God said a church
[58:46] needs a man on fire to preach the gospel
[58:49] to the people to keep them on fire amen
[58:52] amen amen all right where am I at I'm at
[58:54] 802 okay
[59:02] all right let me
[59:05] close I'll CL I'll close with this by
[59:07] God's grace did I skip
[59:09] anything well yeah let me read this here
[59:12] yeah he talks about the dollar bill
[59:13] there in paragraph 55 then 56 now
[59:15] according to the prophecy there will
[59:16] come a headstone I want you to notice
[59:18] when The Headstone comes that Prince is
[59:19] going to cry out the message will cry
[59:21] Grace Grace for it's by Grace we are
[59:23] saved lest any man should boast M yes
[59:28] and the message of Grace has been
[59:29] tramped under feet of men until it's
[59:31] become a
[59:33] disgrace some of them runs out into
[59:35] eternal security Now what does eternal
[59:36] security mean that's Calvinism if you
[59:38] ever heard Calvin Calvinism versus
[59:40] Armenian ISM I just heard some calvinist
[59:42] this week brother Austin but I heard the
[59:44] cist and they say like we have nothing
[59:45] to do with salvation absolutely nothing
[59:47] to do didn't Peter say
[59:50] repent he didn't say do nothing he said
[59:52] repent
[59:54] amen and then he said uh give diligence
[59:59] to make your calling and election sure
[1:00:01] and then Paul said perfect Holiness in
[1:00:03] the fear of God you have to do something
[1:00:06] in other words you have to repent amen
[1:00:08] amen they these these cists swing so far
[1:00:11] the eternal security they swing so far
[1:00:13] well you can fall out a church and you
[1:00:14] can uh divorce and remarry and go to
[1:00:18] prosecution you'll still be saved let's
[1:00:20] AE you must repent Hallelujah you must
[1:00:23] repent and believe praise God Amen
[1:00:27] amen and see that that's why brother R
[1:00:30] preached the real
[1:00:31] Grace if you receive Grace then the
[1:00:33] Bible said uh the Bible said now you're
[1:00:36] one of God's workmanship created unto
[1:00:38] good works that he's already ordained
[1:00:40] for you to do that's right think about
[1:00:41] that you parents you ordained to have
[1:00:43] those children that was ordained of God
[1:00:45] and your desire your your your work of
[1:00:48] God is to raise them to love
[1:00:50] Jesus amen hallelujah and I'm just going
[1:00:54] to share this I preach this over in uh
[1:00:56] Kentucky I haven't preached you here yet
[1:00:57] so it doesn't look like I'm stopping
[1:00:58] anytime
[1:00:59] soon sorry honey I try to stop but the
[1:01:03] Holy Spirit keeps prompting me with
[1:01:04] these
[1:01:08] thoughts I read an article this or last
[1:01:10] week and it said Instagram is like the
[1:01:13] introductory app to
[1:01:16] pornography uh through Facebook right
[1:01:18] the owner of Facebook he bought it up
[1:01:20] and this one article proved if you log
[1:01:23] in and you don't even make an account
[1:01:24] within a three or four clicks they're
[1:01:26] going to show you
[1:01:28] porn so the point is children parents
[1:01:31] don't let your children on that on
[1:01:32] Instagram
[1:01:33] that's none of our children are on
[1:01:36] any uh social media right is Lydia W she
[1:01:40] probably shouldn't call names here you
[1:01:42] know love all my children
[1:01:45] my
[1:01:47] um that's what I
[1:01:50] used that's the Gateway that's that's
[1:01:52] the Gateway look what are all the young
[1:01:53] people on all the old people on Facebook
[1:01:55] all young people on Instagram and Tik
[1:01:57] Tok and Tik tok's the same I forget
[1:01:59] within how many clicks they're going to
[1:02:00] introduce porn to
[1:02:02] you I'm I'm glad I'm not I've never been
[1:02:04] on Tik Tok I'm glad for that by God's
[1:02:05] grace right but it doesn't matter I mean
[1:02:07] I was on Instagram for a few moments you
[1:02:09] know but it doesn't really matter the
[1:02:11] thing to do is now that we know we
[1:02:12] should do something about it praise
[1:02:15] God right and I told them when I
[1:02:17] preached I think it was Saturday yeah
[1:02:18] with the the
[1:02:20] death I said these uh uh I I said you
[1:02:23] know uh people give their kids the the
[1:02:26] devic is too
[1:02:28] early and they don't even know what
[1:02:30] they're
[1:02:31] doing right they don't even know what
[1:02:32] they're
[1:02:33] doing and they don't even bother up to
[1:02:35] ask what they're doing so I told them I
[1:02:38] said I'm not I didn't give my children
[1:02:39] cell phones until they were
[1:02:41] 16 you should have seen some of the
[1:02:45] people I I saw 12 years old with cell
[1:02:47] phones and they're the whole time
[1:02:48] they're like this right remember girls
[1:02:50] you
[1:02:51] saw 12 year
[1:02:53] olds 12y olds
[1:02:56] because they've been to the camps
[1:02:57] they've seen all the other 12y olds the
[1:02:59] message message
[1:03:01] camps okay all right go aad and call
[1:03:04] yourself message but the proof that
[1:03:06] you're in the message is that you got
[1:03:08] Christ in you that's the proof that's
[1:03:09] the proof you real message
[1:03:11] Believers all right I better stop right
[1:03:13] there now
[1:03:15] um so brother says he now remember you
[1:03:18] go back to brother would be the zable
[1:03:21] anti-type crying out Grace Grace The
[1:03:23] Headstone coming amen God's grace will
[1:03:27] finish this church and we'll be
[1:03:29] raptured it's got to be Grace God's
[1:03:32] grace
[1:03:34] amen he says it runs out into eternal
[1:03:36] security the calvinist some of them Runs
[1:03:38] Out in everything but the true message
[1:03:40] of Grace Remains the Same and that's
[1:03:42] there's where Satan tries to knock it
[1:03:44] out from the church but it's Grace it's
[1:03:46] but it's the grace of God that we're all
[1:03:48] saved
[1:03:50] by I'm closing with this one here I will
[1:03:53] close with this
[1:03:56] try so in the deed of Jesus Christ now
[1:03:59] that he's talking about his vision of
[1:04:00] the three rainbows so in the deed of
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ if the Lord would come
[1:04:03] there and confirm that that is the truth
[1:04:05] and not only that but by his word he
[1:04:07] confirms the truth one
[1:04:09] person in the godhead and by signs and
[1:04:11] wonders right that's what the rainbows
[1:04:13] he's talking about he
[1:04:15] confirms is the
[1:04:17] truth that also Grace is the said if my
[1:04:20] go if my teaching on the godheads right
[1:04:22] my teaching on is Right amen it's not
[1:04:24] internal security and it's not saved by
[1:04:26] works it's saved by grace and grace
[1:04:29] produces a a love in your heart that you
[1:04:32] want to do something for God but you're
[1:04:34] not saved by what you do for God you're
[1:04:36] saved by what God did for you am
[1:04:43] amen then why could anyone criticize and
[1:04:45] say that Grace is wrong that we're saved
[1:04:47] by works that's what the Catholic Church
[1:04:48] did that's why Martin Luther came out
[1:04:50] against it and I even looked up this
[1:04:52] week Jehovah's Witnesses believe that
[1:04:53] too you're sa by Grace as long as to the
[1:04:56] the conduct of the church that that's
[1:04:59] adding on you're saved by grace through
[1:05:02] faith and if you have faith what will
[1:05:04] you do you'll repent if you have faith
[1:05:05] amen amen
[1:05:07] right we're saved by grace that through
[1:05:09] faith not by works works shows that you
[1:05:12] have been saved yeah but what saves you
[1:05:15] is the grace of God grace saves you
[1:05:17] Grace is what God does for you works is
[1:05:20] what you do for God to show appreciation
[1:05:22] of what God did for you but by grace are
[1:05:24] you saved amen look at this some people
[1:05:26] thinks because I join a message church
[1:05:28] I'm adding message in there because I
[1:05:29] join a message Church put my name on the
[1:05:31] message book or I'm sorry the put my
[1:05:34] name in the the church directory that's
[1:05:37] all I have to do some people thinks
[1:05:39] because I shout that's all I have to do
[1:05:41] you better have more than a
[1:05:43] shout better make sure after you shout
[1:05:45] you keep
[1:05:47] shouting
[1:05:49] Hallelujah other things because I speak
[1:05:51] in tongues that's all I have to do some
[1:05:52] things because I got power to heal the
[1:05:54] sick that's all I have to do it's not
[1:05:55] not it's the grace of God that saves you
[1:05:58] God's Amazing Grace amen amen I cannot
[1:06:02] trust in any marage that's right you
[1:06:05] cannot trust well I've been preaching
[1:06:07] eight 20 years brother Austin surely got
[1:06:09] I'm saved because I've been preaching 20
[1:06:10] years that's a lie I'm trusting in my
[1:06:14] works well surely God will save me
[1:06:16] because I I made uh 11 years of YouTube
[1:06:18] videos no that works right everything I
[1:06:22] do is just my appreciation whenever it
[1:06:25] amount to praise God but that's not why

[1:08:32] nothing I have no
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] merits and I love that quote I don't
[1:08:38] have the quote up here but remember
[1:08:39] brother said if I have to do one thing
[1:08:41] to be saved then Jesus Christ died in
[1:08:45] vain think about that quote think about
[1:08:47] that meditate on that just for a moment
[1:08:50] if I have to do one thing to be saved to
[1:08:52] earn my salvation then the cross was all
[1:08:54] in vain what Jesus suffered it didn't
[1:08:57] mean nothing what a lie that
[1:09:03] is there's nothing we can do other than
[1:09:06] just repent right we just have to say
[1:09:07] I'm sorry Jesus I recognize you're my
[1:09:10] savior I recognize you're the brass
[1:09:12] serpent I recognize you've been judged
[1:09:13] for my sins forgive me of my sins Lord I
[1:09:17] trust in you so I can be saved Jesus
[1:09:20] that's all we can do yes not Jesus
[1:09:23] that's what saves
[1:09:24] us that's why we teach these little
[1:09:26] children get them baptized as soon as
[1:09:27] they can as soon as as Jem has been
[1:09:29] talking about being baptized and now
[1:09:30] she's resed in Christ
[1:09:32] back but when she when she can when she
[1:09:35] can speak it with her words and say
[1:09:37] mommy or daddy I'm a sinner I want to go
[1:09:40] to heaven when she can say that remember
[1:09:42] that that's amazing
[1:09:46] grace as soon as she can recognize I'm a
[1:09:48] filthy she want to say that I'm a I'm
[1:09:50] just a sinner amen there's nothing good
[1:09:53] in me I'm a Sinner by Nature nobody's
[1:09:57] got to teach me to sin right we got a
[1:09:59] sin nature and we got a divine nature
[1:10:01] yeah
[1:10:03] Divine Nature has a sin nature and a
[1:10:05] divine nature
[1:10:08] Hallelujah but if I have to do one thing
[1:10:10] if I have to make one YouTube video if I
