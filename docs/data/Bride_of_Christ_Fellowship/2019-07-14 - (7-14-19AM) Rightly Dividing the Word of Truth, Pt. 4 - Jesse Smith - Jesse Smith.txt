and the bread [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I like to preach a little bit about the rapture I kind of want to do it under this subject we looking at rightly dividing the word of truth yesterday by the Amen and who and I had a Bible study and some of these thoughts were really striking me as important you know so I like to preach some of them and then yesterday brother Simon and I had like little ministers meeting cam couldn't make it so we had a little ministers meeting and we were looking at the rapture you know and so I just want to share I just want to look at a few things Lord willing this morning so let's go to second Timothy chapter 2 you want to rightly divide the word of truth about the rapture 2nd Timothy 2:11 and bring greetings our son greetings from brother sorry Percy Denis McBride and forgive me and we're gonna try to get him to come up and minister he lives in South Carolina is a tremendous brother just so you know he he stopped pastoring back in October the Lord put it on his heart and everybody transitioned back into brother Anderson's Church and they're doing really well I said since you have all that free time maybe come up and preach for us sometime so looking forward to having him come maybe in November he just started a new job god blessed him with a really nice job and so I said well when's the earliest we could get you up here and so perhaps November so we'll look at that and hopefully we can make that happen he's just a tremendous brother what a good example of Christ second Timothy two sorry verse 11 let's just look at our scripture here the Bible says it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we should also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study the show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and that's what we're seeing today with a lot of the preaching on the rapture just a lot of fun you know babbling you make it up nonsense so we just want to be solid let's may God has blessings the ring of his word you may be seated there praise the Lord I'd like to just greet everybody name of the Lord and say we missed you last week but I just want to give a little recap we had a tremendous day of services last Sunday Brother cams sister Wendy was there we had a wonderful time in the Lord brother cam after the first service I think I preached about two hours the morning services I'm not mistaken I just said I'm not even paying attention that clock I'm just gonna preach I preached on God rewards the diligence I looked at all the thoughts I've been preaching to you about investing in your gifts being faithful and brother cam came up afterwards and he was just crying and he said God has given us a yeren Thummim he said so what that means is he said God discerned everything going on in their church so I thank the Lord for that and I want when some one person told me they're about ready to quit that morning they were they were they decided they're gonna quit with a certain decision their life and then the word came and rebuked him and then they got right back to where they need to be because the message was all about not quitting continuing to invest in your gifts and then God will give you you know blessings and rewards and there's a few more things where did I put my paper oh yeah and the brother cam said that the preaching cleared up predestination he said he's been confused on predestination but I showed how God cannot predestinate without foreknowledge so it starts with foreknowledge is what God starts with I read all the quotes her brother Branham says God can't force you to do anything and God can't force you to to sin and then condemn you to hell he gives free more agency so brother cam said that totally cleared it up for him I thank the Lord for that we had two healings I say kind of the sister with cancer hurt her she brought her son up for prayer he he struggles with what is it not asthma but allergies and so while we're praying for him she said she felt the Holy Spirit and I think her testimony was if maybe Wendy if I'm wrong you can correct me but since she had the cancer she lost like the outer part of her eyesight like she could still see fine but there was she was getting shadows around the outside you know of her eyesight and she said after we prayed for her or what we weren't him praying for her we praying for her son and after we prayed she said she opened her eyes and her eyes were completely healed so we thank the Lord for that and that's that's just like the Lord no that's just like the Lord you know like when you're interceding for somebody else you get a blessing and then brother Mike he's the one in the wheelchair and he said he just came up for prayer at the second service I think it was yeah I think of a second or first service I can't remember he said just pray for me I've got so much pain he went home he said that night he got the best sleep he's had in years so I just want to thank the Lord for that and I'd felt led you know I felt led to raise him up out of the wheelchair but I was looking for a few more signs you know that have been a tremendous thing but but I I didn't see the signs I asked God for so I asked him I said cam has that ever been done he said yes he said three brothers have come through under the anointing of the Holy Spirit raised him up but the strength never came in his legs yet but he's still believing God's gonna give it to him and like brother Graham said it takes more faith to believe God when he doesn't answer your prayer remember the German baby the stad cliff family they were gonna fly brother branham over to raise their dead child from the dead and they said pray by brother Ram he prayed a couple of days he waited the Holy Spirit said no it's the hand of the Lord and then the stand cliff family said what did we do brother branham do something wrong and program said no he said you've got more faith because you're able to love and serve God even though God chose not to raise your baby from the dead and so that's where the lutheran congregation or the lutheran seminary looked a brother branham and said we've got more respect for you now because you waited to you heard thus saith the lord before speaking something up or acting on something and so that's what we wanted that's where church I honestly believe this with all my heart that's where I believe our church and other message churches are heading our ministry has to match the Ministry of Jesus Christ before the rapture and brother Branham said well Jesus said I don't do anything except the father shows me first so that means we have to wait till we get the leadership of the Holy Spirit before we speak the word before we do something if we're not sure we just pray a blessing upon someone and ask God for his mercy like Jacob just said let your mercy be upon me you know he just prayed for the mercy of God and that's what I believe is happening with the bride I believe God is teaching us to just wait to speak it until we got the say at the Lord and let me just give you an example I think some of you might know who I'm talking about but I want you to know I'm not trying to I'm not trying to say anything negative about this person but but this person was a real dear person and they told me one time you know and I was there they told me we were at a little can we rented a little meeting and we were bothered by the mosquitoes and this person said they spoke the words of the mosquitos and they didn't get any bites by the mosquitoes yet the whole time I'm getting bitten up by the mosquitoes I'm trying to help you understand that I didn't feel led to speak to any mosquitoes was i tormented solutely well I didn't feel led but now just to kind of show you you and I don't have control over when we speak the word now the same person that spoke to mosquitos and that skills didn't touch them the same person has now gone through tremendous trials in their lives where family members are turning away from the message I just want to just bring out an observation this person has not spoken the word to bring the family person the family members back if it was just so easy we would just help and just speak the word and bring him back no you have to wait upon the Lord to lead you to speak something so you know we've had a lot of Angelus come in which I've been so grateful for and there a lot of them are preaching on speaking the word and that's true but we can't do it without God's leading it has to be God's leading like I said I've just seen it three or four times in my life the last one was when he prayed for my friend's father prayed for him and I just felt led to speak to it and he came out he's fully recovered now he almost died he was in a coma for weeks but as we spoke it I'm crying in my closet I spoke it and said he's gonna come out in Jesus Christ's name and he came out the doctor said you got one chance to come out and now church you know as I did as I felt a lot of emotion I just I felt led to pray and you know same thing with Simon so the point I'm saying is that brother Brandon tells us in the church age book God is also trying to teach us patience and if God just answered all of our requests just by speaking the word we'll just speak to work with just if he did that we'd be more impatient so just try to understand that and try to understand what I'm saying God is strengthening the bride he's he's teaching us to wait upon him because he doesn't want us to do anything except he tells us first the bride knows what he wants done with the word but she waits until he it's his time to do it like Paul remember he couldn't cast a demon out of that girl until many days later till he felt the leadership of the Lord to do that and church you and I can't do that either it's not as simple as just just speak the word it's not simple as if someone's got a problem we'll just speak the word Amen just speak the word it's not that simple it's really pray about it and find the mind of God that's the real will of God now it's different now it's different if you know you feel led to tell them to speak the word that's different you understand what I'm saying yeah and there's there's quotes brother Branham said like he says sometimes people are so under trials that he said you try to say get next to yourself but they can't because it's not the time and season for it whether you're mad in a complex or you've been so scarred from your past there's things God lets us experience years and years of suffering until a certain moment then he brings victory and deliverance like Joseph Joseph verse was at seventh note thirteen years he held that pain of being betrayed by his brothers until he saw them face to face and that was the moment to release it he didn't he didn't release an anger he released it Grace and the Bible said he wept so much that that all those in the palace could hear him crying he had to hold in there for the time and season for healing to come as ever you understand he just couldn't speak the word against to say I'm not gonna have any hurt I'm not gonna know you had to wait for the time and moment this the the healing or the season or healing so just I want to just encourage you with that that with this brother in the wheelchair I told brother amen and hooah that I every bleed out felt my heart when we see him rise I really believe and this is just could be me but I really believe that will be a time where the rapture is close I'm sure because brother Graham said the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and right after Pentecost Acts chapter 3 that he Peter grabbed that man's hand and said silver and gold I don't have but what I have I give to you and when he wrote it when he pulled him up time strength instantly came into his legs and they've tried it three times of the church and it wasn't the time and season but see at least they got the faith to do it because I was feeling it that wasn't saying Lord give me this certain sign I never got the signs I waited I talked to cam afterwards I was gonna go over there and do it because I was fast and I was praying I was I saw the movement of the Holy Spirit when he saw the move of the Holy Spirit their God moving in the great way so I just want to encourage you Church that everything's right on time with God the rapture boban said will not be a second late God's not upset with you you know guys aren't upset with me he's not upset with his bride there's no condemnation then there in the bride yes we confess our sins we keep walking the light you know he forgives us to that but there's no combination condemnation to the bride of Jesus Christ God is lengthening the time the Bible said that he might save souls account that the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation the souls because God would that no man parish church I say like this God is weeping and crying like in his heart he's grieving he wants to see people he wants to see Muslims saved and he's patient and he's revealing himself to Muslims he's patient saving souls in China praise God he's patient while they're getting thrown in jail and persecuted he's patient he doesn't want anybody to be lost and so we've got to just be patient and wait for the coming of the Lord and do our part when one person rejoices rejoiced with them when one person suffers suffer will pray with them praise God and God will work everything out but remember our life is just a vapor we're not gonna be here very long either way you look at it whether the rapture happens that were changed or whether we die when it could be here very long it's just a vapor and we got to redeem the time while we have the time so I just want to encourage you with that you know God God is really moving you know humbly brother have said that third pole which we'll get to that little bit the third pole this last stage of the bride's ministry he said it'll be so great but it'll be so humble it's just gonna be amongst the bride members I know there's a ministry to the eternal laws - I understand that don't get me wrong I understand but it's so humble it's gonna be a small little group and we just got to be faithful to Christ praise God and we can be a part of it is that a blessing that we could be a part of it Lydia switch over here I just want to just show just want to show really one thing and I'm gonna leave this slide up here most of the time I just I want to just talk about rightly dividing the word of truth for the rapture just I just want to look at a few thoughts this morning and I'll set my timer here give me about an hour by God's grace so Lord willing tonight we'll look at numerology unless we have a visitor my co-worker said he may come if he comes he wanted to Bible study on patience I got a Bible study on patience ready to go I just got to be patient maybe he'll come maybe not he's gotta be patient but I have a sermon prepared on numerology it might be the last one I'm trying to cap it off tonight I hope I can cap off that series be done with that I want to move on to another series I want to finish purpose and I want to get I want to start a series on the entire life of Jesus Christ that would be a tremendous series but I want to get started on that because our ministry has to match the ministry of Jesus Christ so the more we look at Jesus Christ the more we see how we need to be now I understand we can look at the book of Acts - yes I agree - and you know all Paul's letters and I do but I want to really get to know the ministry of Christ even better because that's what we have to come back to the capstone has to fit perfectly on the bride of Laodicea on the great pyramid it has to cap it off and so it's got to fit perfectly it's got to be just like that we got to learn to wait upon the Lord we got to learn to do always that which pleases the father always move on and sister brother sister always want to please the Lord that's quite a that's quite a life it's quite a godly life so here's my title but I just want to look at the rapture like I said we had two things about the rapture yesterday so I just thought I would and I want to just look at these terms here and I just want to just I want to clear I want to rightly divide these just as a real brief kind of reminder of some of these so that we can be solid on them and you know some of these will be the scriptures we went over yesterday with brother amen and sister who and they request that Bible study if anybody needs a Bible say let me know I'll be happy to do that usually Saturday works the best for me but summertime I got other two other times three times too so I want to just I want to see you know there's there's these are really important terms to us how many to say amen to that but like we read in our text here there are some people that just they want to strive about words to no prophet and they want to the Bible said they they they're profane and vain babble they just want to babble behind the pulpit I'm not trying to be critical you know and I'm a of churches you know I'm not trying to be critical but but Jesus said few there be that find it and Paul said evil seducers or wax worse and worse all you got to do is go on YouTube and you know type in preachers and you'll find the big name preachers out there you know not an out message I'm just talking about the world you know the nominal churches and there a lot of them are just babbling things babbling jokes and babbling they're not really preaching the Word of God but Paul says don't let that be amongst you don't wrestle and argue words under no prophet in other words we've got to rightly divide the word so the people are profited so they benefit spiritually from the Word of God so I think I'll just start with the latter rain so go to since we're here in the New Testament go to James 5 6 James 5 the latter rain has only used one time in the New Testament and this is it James 5 6 and 7 now the latter rain is a very scriptural word and fact these are the only two that are not scriptural words you won't find third Pole in the Bible and you won't find squeeze in the Bible so these three are clearly identified in Scripture and so we should know what they're about so you so you're profited by that that's what I can that's why I want to get out of this I've kind of mentioned it earlier I want you to profit from knowing the truth about these these things so there there's no one during the church I don't sit there and wondering wonder when's the third poll or what UN's the squeeze are a wonder if the seven thunders have uttered or a wonder what the Seventh Seal is in my life I don't sit there and wonder what I do wonder is that my pleasing my Lord and what does Jesus want me to do today that's what I wonder because I know I hope you can understand this I know that if I'm serving Jesus Christ with all my heart soul mind and strength all these things I'll take care of themselves ain't ahead all right now do I believe I know the truth about these yes I do but even if I'm wrong I always leave that little space out there even if I'm wrong I know if I'm loving Jesus Christ with all my heart and soul and I'm seeking first the kingdom of God all the physical things will be added and then all the spiritual things will be added as well all these mysteries remember you can understand all the mysteries and have not loved so when preachers are preaching some of these things and now I mean the message now when people have preaching these with the wrong spirit or they're trying to draw disciples after themselves it proves they probably don't have charity they probably don't have divine love because the mysteries and this is what I want to be I want to be a preacher that knows all the mysteries like first Corinthians 13 says but I also got divine love amen and that's what I believe the Bride of Christ will have I believe that with all my heart all my heart I believe that she has to because the mystery of God will be finished the Bible said in Revelation 10 7 so it's got to be finish someone's got to know that all the mysteries and some one also has to have all the divine love amen so that's what I want to be I want to be that I want to I want to preach it with God's love right which is a noise compassion remember God's love isn't always compassion God doesn't heal everybody right God doesn't do everything we want him to do but it's the will of God is the perfect love of God submitting like we run on we read it last Sunday where the RAM said the proof of God's love is that you're elected elected means called the proof that God's loves you is you heard this message he calls you that's God's love then Batman said but but God may commit you to death like he did Paul but man said God may commit you to sufferings like he did job that doesn't mean God doesn't love you it means God does love you but he wants to bring a certain testimony out of your life so he can use you as a witness on the day of judgment that's like a lot of thoughts going that way lately all of our lives are for that purpose that God can help us to testify of something to testify of some power of Jesus Christ in our lives amongst our family and friends and our communities that we can be a witness that God can use on the day of judgment I believe that's what what's happening here so the latter rain it's we used one time in the New Testament actually let's go to verse 7 James 5:7 be patient therefore brethren under the coming of Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain so James is saying church calm down be patient just like your husband men just like the owner of the vineyard is patient he's been around the block a few times before right we've been around the block a few times we know God is going to bring forth the former rain and the latter rain it's gonna happen in the season just like the farmers they don't get worried you know they know the rain eventually gonna come or you know that they know eventually the season is going to get here because they've done it before and so it is with God right just as God harvested Jesus and the Old Testament Saints haha just as he Harvard their soul harvested their souls in the heaven he's gonna do the same for the New Testament hey I didn't see that before just as he Hardison that time he's gonna harvest this time amen he's done it before it'll come in a time and season now look at 8 verse 8 but be also patients to have us your hearts for the coming of the Lord draw-off 9 and I kind of want to end it with that thought but let me ride it real big on my paper here so I don't forget I don't want to forget that let me just write it I'm a circle real big there okay because you know yesterday I was working on the numerology but now all these thoughts are coming to me this morning so I didn't have time to put them all in the notes even got up at 5:30 didn't have enough time to get him on there so we see James says be patient brethren he says it twice in a row right verse 7 verse 8 be patient brother they said be also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of Lord draws not verse 9 he says don't have grudges so against each other the judge is it before the door right it is that remind you of Jesus where he said behold I stand the door knock James says the judge is at the door and now the Bible says let her see he's knocking on the door right all you gotta do is open our hearts to him amen let him come into our lives it's all we have to do so the coming of the Lord the rapture is connected to the latter rain and we can all see that so brother bran tells us thus saith the Lord and I'm not gonna take the time to read it but you can read it's on the last three page of the church age book brother Graham said thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and he says latter rain is rapturing faith that's what we worked in looked at yesterday how do you define latter rain it's rapturing faith it's the faith God is going to give you to change your body amen it's a gift stay back it's a gift it's a revelation rogram says in the 1965 sermon he said the rapture is a revelation it's an unveiling God unveils the power God unveils the the anointing he gives us the anointing to in order to change our bodies now Jesus does it by the Trump right the Trump Paul said in first Corinthians 15 the Trump of God shall sound and that Trump will change our bodies so the anointing somehow the latter rain is somehow connected that Trump of course we know the shout already went out brother Ram sermon or messages I believe a shout still shouting around the world I believe the voice of the Archangel will be the voice of Michael now I could be wrong on this let me just say it plainly I could be wrong on this but I believe it's the voice of Michael the Archangel that will resurrect the dead Saints I believe that because Michael is connected to the resurrection of Moses in the book of Jude the voice of the Archangel but manses the voice like Lazarus heard to raise the Saints amen glory that's what I believe I could be wrong on that one but see I'm not striving about it to no profit you're still good profit but pay attention to the things that have thus saith the Lord that's how you're gonna profit you'll profit from idea but I'm saying you're gonna profit from the knowing the latter rain is thus saith the Lord now go to joel 2:23 brother Ram says the church age book twice I don't know why people so I do know why why people are against the church age book they're against it because it's got thus saith the Lord in it right Joe 2:23 lbrahim quotes this and he says it twice this these scriptures 23 to 26 is thus saith the Lord and I preaches three years ago and I said I'd like to put this and maybe I'll do it someday I want to put the vision of our church up here and the vision of our church is this right here this is the vision because the fullness of Pentecost must be in the bride and we all know we have we have part of Pentecost we got the same baptism right we're all baptized the Lord Jesus Christ we got the same in Godhead right we got the same communion we know wine feet washing but we want to see his more power right like an axe after three where they just raise up the pair paralyzed now that but that all has to be done by God's leading right so we know we're experiencing we've experienced a lot of restoration but not the fullness of it but the fullness will be in the bride and that's our vision to serve God so that God can work his fullness through us so one day maybe I like to put up here the vision and want to put this up here the former clattering that's our vision our vision is that keep serving God so he'll he'll pour out his reign amen upon his former reign upon us and his latter rain at the same time because the Bible says it comes at the same time joe 223 be glad then you choose i rejoice in the lord your god forth giving you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month program says thus saith the lord he said the fullness of pentecost will be in the bride according to this scripture and also 24 25 and 26 so 24 and the floor shall be full of wheat that represents the word and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil wine represents stimulation of Revelation and oil represents the baptism with Holy Ghost so what kind of church is this that's going to get the latter rain a church who's got the Holy Ghost amen a church that wants to be just like Acts chapter two amen that's the kind of church that's our vision is to be like Acts chapter two because brother Branham said we're going to need more than Acts chapter two for the red tells that invisible Union which is true but we've got to go back to Acts chapter two in order to go up praise God we got to go back to Acts chapter two no way that will go up praise God see in other words we got to go back to the full power the full anointing the full dedication the full diligence of the book of Acts then we'll go up now it'll happen it's time so God's gonna lead us to that verse 25 and I'll restore to you see we're still in the restoration you might say well bro jest well the bride hasn't been fully restored yet well that's true not all of it but a lot of it has a lot of our doctrine looks just like the Bible and if not you better tell me Church because I've been trying to preach this this Bible right here and if I got something wrong that's not in the Bible you need to come and let me know by God's grace our doctrine is very very close we're waiting on that power we're waiting on that power are we going in doctrine absolutely we're going in doctrine we're still learning more about the ways of God and then we've learned about the church ages the book of Revelation and and all the things that God's showing us our purpose in life we're learning all these things but God is he started the restoration process he'll finish it at the rapture see I'll restore to you the years the locust has eaten the cankerworm program said that's an antichrist spirit and the caterpillar of the poem my gray army which I sent among you through those four anointings throughout the seven church ages Satan slowly bit away and shooed away all their fellowship and all their joy we looked at that a few weeks ago or when we preached on purpose those four bugs it's the same bug in four stages right but God is going to bring back all that they lost God's gonna bring back to us amen if we live to see it amen but either way we've seen a lot of restoration so far hey I don't like you but I have I know Karen has an lndian I know we've seen this because we got the doctor and we got the when we've seen americo's at least when we see how God's moving among us we're seeing the restoration it's not finished but each day a church it's getting closer amen it is it has to be just logically but the battles raged harder each day as well and that's where I'll be honest that's where some days where Satan will discourage me I'll go through discouragement and I'll be like oh we're not the brighter how can I be the brighter or mercy our church is struggling or or this church is struggling and discourages us but God always brings us out of that discouragement because when you get under the fresh anointing or the Bible said of transformation the renewing of your mind you can live with spiritual eyesight and now you can see that you've done the perfect will of God you struggled you've got ups and downs but overall picture you're flying over the things of the world with the Eagle anointing and you're feeding on the book the body word of the carcass of the fresh word of Jesus Christ amen you're feeding oh you're an eagle amen you come out of denominations I come out of that and we're facing on the body where the current word the current prophecy which is the rapture amen it's gonna happen through the rain through the anointing all about you but I want more anointing of the Holy Spirit thanks got it because the anointing equals rain hallelujah amen when someone says oh you're just too much about the anointing no no the anointing is what's needed for the rapture praise God amen and if you ever get the right anointing it'll make you live the right way praise God see we don't want wildfire thank God wildfires better than no fire in other words some seals better than no seal but this bride is not going to heaven in a rapture with wildfire it's the eternal fire it's a consuming fire that's the fire that's taking us in the rapture amen it's exactly right ain't gonna be some wildfire play around think you might we might go through seasons like that we might have to deal with that you know I'd rather have someone who's a little more sales than someone who don't even care lays around it is new nothing for Jesus right you rather have that just trying to do something for the Lord and someone who's not even trying at all wasting around see so it's this anointing verse 26 Joel 2 26 and ye shall eat and plenty be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that adult wonder see with you my people shall never be ashamed that is our vision if you ever wondered what my vision is for the church that is it right there a church brother amen where everybody satisfied everybody's happy praising the Lord a church when you're hungry there's always wheat to eat glory a church when you're thirsty there's always wine to drink thank you Jesus amen oh ma that's the kind of church that we want to be because brother Branham says this is the fullness of Pentecost thus saith the Lord now I got a little thought here go to Jeremiah 29 just so you know in the message desperation just kind of kind of came back to me mysteriously strangely Jeremiah 29 if you listen to the token that's brother Branham preached it I believe was June 63 for not mistaken but the evening service was desperations and it was a healing service and he starts off this Sturman and then he talks about how the token was one of the highlight messages of his entire ministry he said outside the regular Commission like the seals and the church ages he said because that's what caps off all the other messages glory the Holy Ghost is the capstone Amen the anointing amen God's life God's Spirit is the capstone and brother Han reads this now if you know Jeremiah 29 this was the letter that was written to the Jews who were in captivity and God was encouraging them saying at the end of 70 years I'm gonna visit you and I'm gonna bring you back to the land right all right now go to verse 10 29:10 for thus saith the Lord that's after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I'll visit you and perform my good word unto you and causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say that the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give expected and now we love this this is one of the most beautiful passages of Scripture God has God has literally lost in the tree he spiritually kicked his people out of the land because of all their abominations and part of the reason we'll get to tonight on the number seventy part of the reason is every seventh year they didn't rest and God said because of that you've done it for seven 490 years every seven years you haven't done it because of that you're gonna wait seventy years out of here so the land can rest you wouldn't rest spiritually you kept working and trying to make more money oh my it was the look at that tonight unless the patients got comes so God said I'm will let it rest you're not touching the land for seventy years each year you didn't let it rest each year you've disobeyed and this I turn my Sabbath and look at this today they just honor the baptism of Holy Ghost they they won't rest from their sinful works and be borned again so God's gonna keep the church out of the out for me in the variety what he already did right because they won't be born again they will honor God's Sabbath amen so he kicks him out from being the bride like Vashti and he gets him a new one Esther praise God glory the shining star the moon take the lower they hit yeah this is one of the most beautiful portions of scripture he said I know how I think about you Jewish bride I think thoughts of peace not of evil see many times we think God's upset with us Church God's not upset with you you've heard the call you've come out of the world you're elected all the other chickens stay in the chicken yard but you came out your eagle right he knows the thoughts he's there good thoughts for you now he says this verse to give me and so they want everyone they all would know what's the end of our lives gonna be it's gonna be that God is gonna bring you back to your promised land God is gonna return you to your inheritance hey man boy verse 12 then you shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray to me and I will hearken unto you God is letting them know I'm not gonna prayers really now I ask you know you'll do good things there but I'm really not gonna really answer your prayers until the 70 years are up I still love you now what amazing God we serve what a loving God in other words about a minutes like this they spit in his face for 490 years they won't take any Sabbath's and he says I still love you though I'm still gonna give you a chance I'm gonna bring you back at the end of this that's love now look at verse 13 and ye shall seek me and and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart now if you listen to the desperation message brother Ram ends with verse 14 this is his text for desperation and I will be you say that the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I'll gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I've driven you say the Lord and I'll bring you again in the place where I've caused you to be carried away captive and brother Graham said back to Pentecost glory amen so see program says thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and then he preaches desperation God's gonna bring his bride back to a desperate state just like the attitudes they had on the day of Pentecost amen they're desperate we need the rain but he's got we need the Holy Ghost God's gonna bring us back to that praise God that's what this it's thus saith the Lord it's not my thought that's my vision and I share that brother Paul the Fontaine's and and he told me in the office he said I appreciate a man like you brother Jesse that can find prophecy and he said and stay with it that's what he told me because I preached it at their church to Joel chapter 2 verse 23 27 and some devoted all my life to teaching the Word of God to try to get ever to go back to Pentecost because you're not going to get back to Pentecost unless you got the right doctrine because doctrine is your instruction if you're teaching how to get back to Pentecost amen and the day of Pentecost it was repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ that was the doctrine and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen they can't the the nominal churches can now get back to Pentecost without the right doctrine on the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there's power in that name sins are remitted in the literal name of Jesus Christ amen and don't let anybody tell you that you you know we need we need a ninety more than doctrine you need we need both so go to a second John this was this was such a blessing in my heart I just want to share it with you second John chapter one don't let everyone out now church cross doctrine is always wrong you know this false doctrine is always wrong but the only that ever anyone ever tell you you know oh well don't worry so much about dr. know so what worry so much about the mysteries no no no no no yeah I mean if someone's like like let me just name a name like Geoff Jenkins let me just say okay just to if someone is on false doctrine and is pushy pointing you away from the message like Geoff Jenkins then yes you stay away from doctrines like that that's false doctrine but Jesus is very first doctrine was you must be born again according to both John chapter 3 that's a doctrine and if someone's preaching mysteries wrong and yes that's wrong but the mysteries is what God has to reveal in order to finish the Great Commission and in order to give the bride the revelation she needs to go in the rapture amen we're not you know we're not getting in the rapture without the revelation of the mysteries and without the true doctrine of Jesus Christ amen we're not getting in the rugs without that because the Roger itself is a mystery Paul said so you can't even under you're getting on the rapture without having the revelation of the mystery of the rapture and you're not getting getting the mystery of the rapture without having the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory even the Holy Ghost is a mystery so we need the mysteries yes we do we need the only thing we need to speak the word we need doctrine we need all that Jesus Christ is amen I've just heard a lot lately people saying Oh some people just go too far mysteries and go too deep on doctrine if you're a real Holy Ghost still Saint you'll never get wrong on that you'll always be right because that's the heart of Christ amen true doctrine is instruction from the heart of Jesus Christ the mysteries are what God say Moses said the mysteries are for you and your children the mysteries are God's special revelations for his family amen and the rest don't want it brother ant but we want it because it's given to us and your children and then even as many as the Lord our God shall call glory second John verse seven for many deceivers are entered in the world that's what we got today a lot of this even preachers who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist I've never heard any you know preachers say Jesus Christ didn't come in a flesh body what I think this means now I could be wrong is that they deny that Jesus Christ is living in his bride in other words like we we don't have like just an anointing we got the seal of the Holy Ghost we have a part of God in us it's in our flesh do we still battle this guy oh yeah he's my worst enemy and he beats me from time to time but Jesus Christ has come in in flesh he's in his people because no no teacher is gonna say well Jesus didn't live in a a body of flesh nobody's gonna say that everybody knows that's the truth that's not gonna deceive anybody but if he says the false teachers say well well he's not really here and a many membered bride he's in all of his church and those people that believe the the william branham message oh they don't really have the holy ghost see they're denying that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh William Branham wasn't really truly filled with the Holy Ghost God really wasn't leading him there denying that Jesus Christ was with that man how do you know he's with him he preached the word and Jesus Christ is the word hey man second John verse 8 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have robbed that we receive it would have been a full reward another very good description for last week John saying keep looking after the thing he's got and keep keep a watch over the victories you have I'm sad I just keep a watch over all the saints that God has given our church that we don't lose any of them keep a watch over your joy that Satan doesn't steal it away amen keep over keep a watch over the things you've learned in the scripture or no Satan will steal away from your heart that's why I need to go over church I'll be honest you I've been I've been going back and listen to my sermons after I preached him not because I like what I'm preaching because it helps me to meditate on the Word of God well I'll go right to brother Branham all right go to Donnie regular I'll go right to Tim present a good temper message this week I got another word Church we got to keep our mind state on the Word of God we can't come here and let the word just pass over and forget it we've got to become the word that we're hearing it's got to build our confidence like brother dig said it's got it we got to learn to stay with God speak God's Word right believe God's Word and it'll build confidence in us we got to remember what God is telling us through the fivefold ministry see for reward we don't want to lose part of our reward remember lot light lost most of his family right a lot lost his wife he lost some of his reward but Abraham didn't lose nothing glory he was so far away from Sodom and Gomorrah they saw was smoke he didn't feel the heat he didn't even feel the thunders anti-death he was so far separated oh god help us to be a separated group amen separate from the things of the world praise God where we don't lose anything verse 9 here is verse 9 this is what so bless me whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God can every see that you yeah keep the doctrine unless you got Jesus Christ you can't live the doctrine unless Christ is living in you hey Laurie that's why some of these people preach against doctrine because they can't live it they can't live it because Christ is not in them glory that's why the preacher like I mentioned earlier left the message all these preachers that leave the message they're doing that because they can't live it and after a while they get so upset and Satan will give him one little loophole program says it give them a little proposal too just to find a way out of it because they love the things in the world that preach I mentioned earlier I went on his YouTube page four years ago and he was posting Taylor Swift songs on his YouTube video or YouTube page now what kind of Holy Ghost film man would want to put a half-naked Jezebel lust machine like Taylor Swift on their YouTube page what kind of man do that see it exposes some things that are laying there some trash it never got clean out of the house oh maybe have a trash clean time a man where everything's clean up in this house amen see that's just an excuse the doctor was just an excuse cuz he can't live it because he still loves the things of the world and you watch anybody that falls away from this message go watch their life for a while and see they'll start dabbing a little more into it cuz now the churches they go to it's okay to watch those things it's okay to talk like it's okay because they love those things from the beginning but he glory that abides not the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son he's not the invisible spirit and the corporal body of Christ what's that mean that body in heaven is there to intercede for you based upon your profession amen you've got both the invisible spirit and the heart breeze as a body because you've kept the doctrine the instruction of that body Jesus Christ amen [Music] that's the reason they're so against the doctrine and holiness doctor like I wrote that book that's the reason they're against it that's reason they won't read it because it's the Holy Ghost behind it and they don't want to let the doctrine so they'll do anything they'll make any excuse to keep loving the things of the world is that true you better believe that's true the man that can't abide in the doctrine doesn't have Christ that's why they don't like doctrine that's why I say hello or about the mysteries and don't worry about the doctrine it's because they don't have Christ but the reason Jesus Christ came was to reveal his doctrine and reveal his mysteries let's go there revelation 10 let's go there Jesus Christ was the only one in heaven that could take the boat glory amen and what do you want to do brother William he wanted to take that book want to stay in heaven he wanted to come down to earth a man he wouldn't take that seven sealed book break it open and bring it down to heaven and reveal and finish the mystery of Donnie man huh bori it was another man it was Jesus Christ amen was it Mary the Virgin it wasn't Enoch it wasn't John the Baptist it wasn't William and it was Jesus Christ he's the only one worthy one amen he just gave it to the seventh angel cuz God always reveals it to the Angels because their messengers that's their name by definition of messengers angel revelation 10 now this will clear this up brother Branham said revelation 10 7 is history that's already happened so verses 1 to 7 are already history and right now 8 through 11 is being fulfilled in you and I my brother Simon when he goes to Tyler and I brother Greg when he goes to Japan it's being fulfilled right now glory amen 1 2 7 s history 8 to 11 is current right now taking the revelation to every nation kindred tongue and people amen see all I gotta do is eat the book all y'all do is live the doctrine praise God just live it the hard services yeah the hard Wednesday nights why is it there keep eating the word keep becoming the word keep keep keep making Christ more control give him more preeminence in your life because if you don't it shows you don't have Christ and that is not by the doctrine doesn't have him you know revelation 10 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven go over the cloud that's Christ and a rainbow was upon his head his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open see that was the book from heaven that was sealed with seven seals who's worthy to take that book Jesus Christ and he brought it down to earth and he has had a little book and he said his right foot upon the sea multitudes and left foot upon the earth and he cried with a loud voice is when a lion roars a lion is a prophet Amos 3:7 a lion roaring is a prophet prophecy glory and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices when the seven thunders none of their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth of things that are therein are and the sea and the things that are there and that there should be time no longer that means delay it was gonna be no more delay God is now finishing the mystery of God and it's going around the world ain't glory there's time no longer there's delay no longer this is the time for the open book to be taken around the world on him and all of the mysteries of God will be finished for the days of the voice to the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound asked me a man because God doesn't preach by angels he gives their words of instruction by angels but he don't preach mysteries the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now let me clear this up seven thunders there's a lot of quotes on the seven thunders brother Branham clears it up at the end of his ministry but if you listen before the end there's a lot of things he says like still waiting for the thunders so in the 6263 is like we're still waiting we're still waiting we're still waiting but at the end mother ram says the revelations in the seven seals are the seven thunders and that's the truth so brother man preached the first seal that was the first Thunder booming out so the revelation the White Horse and all these riders Rider and all these the the Beast that was all the first Thunder it has to be Church it has to be because lik bro they've said it's already history so the seven thunders are already under their voices and they utter their voices when the mystery of God was finished if you don't understand it then just say Lord thank you for your love thank you for your mercy help me not understand it someday but let me tell you the seven thunders uttered when Christ brought down the open seven sealed book to have a name not earth a man from heaven the seven thunders uttered when the book was brought down to the seventh angel they've already uttered they're the mysteries contained in the seven seals seven thunders seven seals it goes together and here's why it has to be that way because there's no seventh there's no mention of the seven thunders after this glory to the last time it's mention is when he brings the book down it's uttered and then the mystery of God which happens to be the voice of those thunders is taken around the world through missionaries they vary but see some people some of the quotes about the RAM says it'll be those sad of an unknown thunders that I'll get us ready for the rapture some people stumble over that and say see we don't have it you don't have it no we already got it because you can't make it something outside the Bible it has to be this right here revelation 10 that's the last mention of seven thunders see what is it doing this rightly dividing the word of truth right but even if people won't agree that's fine just keep praying for the latter rain then but I know this I do know this with all my heart the people that don't really take the seal seriously they get overthrown by Satan because Satan rides with this evil horse into their lives that's the power of the seven seals I've said it before I'm gonna keep saying it because I see it all the time now Satan rides in the people's lives we've seen people fall away we've seen people following and what happened they let Satan come in like a real deceptive way right into their life and it shows they don't they didn't hear the thunder of Christ he was thundering out beware of the light horse rider don't let him ride into your life amen glory they don't hear they just think well just learning an education it's more than that it's revelation it's recognizing Satan and every one of his tricks praise God and then it reveals your anointing to be an eagle and fly above all the horse rider down below here you Frye way above it and he can't touch you because you're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's the power of the funders each one thundered out God's will God's voice for each of the seven seals so don't be don't be don't be confused on this they already they were the revelations containing the seven seals because that's what revelation 10 says when the open books brought down seven thunders out of their voices it's already down to earth and the one the sevens already history amen does that help go to Revelation chapter 8 just so you know these are all things that we need to rightly divine revelation eight this seven seal is the literal second the rapture happens it's the day and hour of the rapture because all heaven went the seven seals loose then all heaven goes quiet because Jesus left so we have to wonder is the seventh seal open or not well part of it's not open because no one knows the day or the hour but part of it is open brother Adam said it's revealed to us we know what it is it's the hour of his coming name and he says that in feasts of trumpets he says it over and over again Christ to Mister God revealed he says it over and over again we know what the seventh seal is it's the literal day and hour is coming but no one knows that so it's still mysterious amen ah revelation 8:1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven now you got you got those chat rooms that are crying holy holy and they shut their voices cuz Christ isn't there anymore he went down to get his bride amen glory they're not gonna just keep going holy holy and holy she's gonna say hold it up stop I'll be back a little bit by God well by my grace I guess he'd say hear you guys say say right there hold on I'm gonna go get my bride there's gonna be silence in heaven and that's the moment of the rapture to see these are all closely connected and we shouldn't have confusion on them we're not wrestling enough I'm not preaching this to fight with other preachers I'm preaching this so your profit on the things of God you won't worry about this what you're worried about is being faithful to what God's called you to do you'll work until Jesus comes amen but Bram said if you stop 15 minutes before the days over you get docked 15 minutes of pay and he said it's the same thing for the rapture if you could take advantage this off the field he said if you stop your meetings you'll get docked in pay he says in other words you'll miss the rapture that'll prove your foolish version you've got to keep going keep planting he said don't change a thing keep that Holy Ghost gospel moving all on the world amen take it every nation eat the books wound up taking every nation prophesy again to every people nation tongue and kindred don't quit don't get all flustered up don't make yourself odd to be a Christian just be a solid Christian tell everybody how much you love Jesus I'm quoting mother Brandon he said don't try to figure things out he said just let the Holy Spirit do it see there's there's no confusion this is the anointing we receive right before the rapture this is the rapture the moment the thunders is the revelations that that the book art that the void that the book open book will helped us to hear all the seven voices of the revelations of the kid seven seals we didn't hear I hope you don't think that we didn't hear the voice of William Branham in the seven seals we heard the voice of Christ we are the voice of Jesus Christ that was Christ saying look I'm right here I can't be the wine horse rider John because I'm the one opening the word there can't be two persons there's only one person that was Christ bring out his voice so that we would know the revelation of the seven seals thank you Lord now those are the main things I just wrote dozens of extra notes I want to show here now the next one let's go up third pull now third pulls not in the Bible but signs is a better word three signs so go to Exodus chapter three because remember the angel said romancin how am I gonna pray for Kings and the angel said that you're just like Moses you're gonna be given three signs I don't know if he said two signs or three but we know brother I've had three poles so three signs I can't member the exact court ought to look it up I'm sorry that Exodus chapter 4 chapter 4 now in verses 1 to 5 he talks about casting the the rod down to the ground now verse 6 and the lower put further I'm starting said furthermore in him put now behind hand into thy bosom and he put his hand in his bosom when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said putting on hand in that bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again he plucks it out from his bosom and behold it was turned again as other flesh and it came to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign to the hand was the first sign or the first pole right they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it should come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs either hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take up the water of the river and pour it on the dry land and the water which they'll take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land so it looks like there's three poles in there right or three signs so I'm sorry you have rod I'm sorry rod first second you have the hand and third pour in the water turn the water to blood so as Moses but the angel said as Moses given the two or three signs so you'll be given them to believe now what was Moses the prophet of the exodus out of a natural land amen what was brother man the prophet of the exodus from a spiritual condition to an eternal condition amen glory remember there's three exodus --is the first exodus from each of the promised land the second he said from a natural land to a spiritual and spiritual condition right which was Pentecost Pentecost was the second Exodus they left the natural things and came into a spiritual Kingdom and the last Exodus program said is going from a spiritual Kingdom into eternity amen oh yeah it's so when you think of third pole just change it to sign if you don't like the word pull change it to sign three signs now the interesting thing is is that the third sign brother Graham said involves you and I because he said the third pole will be used in a major way until the squeeze comes down and that's almost a literal quote from look away to Jesus so for some reason God allows this power the three poles of the messenger to continue on in this bride now I can't explain it by scripture yeah I'm sure a trusting God will show it to me one day but that third power has to be in the bride now see that means it has to be this it has to be the same thing it has to be because the former rain is teaching it literally says that in the Hebrew the former rain is the teaching rain of brother Branham the doctrine Laury Laury and the latter rain is the harvest rate or rapturing faith the faith we need for rapturing power amen so this poll is directly connected to ladder rain so these are like the same thing the third we can only do the third sign when we have the latter rain okay these are not all these separate things I wanted you to see they they're almost all the same thing the only one that's not is the squeeze but that's the one that's program gives us two scriptures for that let's go to Revelation 3:10 that's first one now this is from the church age book which I have a lot of confidence in that I know it's not perfect I know it's not the Bible but it's the second greatest book I've ever read outside the Bible it is because if you can't understand the church ages you never gonna understand the seals if you never understand the seals Ram so you never understand the trumpets or the vows or the future home write the rest of the book of Revelation oh but I will understand all of it praise God the doctrine of it the anointing of it the rein of it the former reign of it oh my revelation 3:10 because thou hast kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour temptation which would come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth well the Baron said that was the promise that if you keep God's Word with patience you won't have to you won't have to go there and either decide am I gonna live or die to take the mark of the beast he will keep us from that our temptation because you cut this word with patience there we go over patience for tonight well see if we're gonna preach that we'll see but the squeeze is all the political and ecclesiastical pressure that's gonna come down right before the rapture right before this or maybe while that's happening I don't know that's one thing we don't know okay so the squeeze is all this political pressure now I was telling my brother and sister yesterday in the Bible saying to me it has to be like a bowling pot where it slowly boils because the world is not going to know it they're not going to be ready for the rapture the Bible said they're like and they're like people that are going to get stolen in the thief or the night they're not gonna be aware of the rapture is gonna happen so the political pressure and the ecclesiastical pressure is going to slowly increase over the next year five years ten years fifty years no one knows the day or the hour but it's gonna slowly increase now we saw a little bit with Trump which I appreciate what he's doing I appreciate that he loves Israel but we saw right we got elected I preached it to you he signed a bill that allowed churches to have more Oh to have the ability to finance campaigns and I showed it here a few years ago he was last year the year before that's when the first bills he signed churches are now more free politically and that's just what Satan once well the RAM said the way it's gonna happen the churches are going to get such political power that they can move the government people the workers there which they're all sellouts almost all of them jellyfish sellouts not being critical but that's what they are they have no backbone for the word they're all dishonest most of them are dishonest not all but they're gonna pressure the leaders to make laws to outlaw you and I it's gonna be so slow it's good to me they're just gonna be like you know remember the earthquakes a few weeks ago in California it's gonna like this your shirt up by a few minutes you're certain about then you forget about it because you have you have life to live you can't worry about California all day you got to go to work I got to change babies diapers like I can't worry about California all day with earthquakes cuz I gotta live my life what's gonna be the same thing with this they're gonna have pressure and they're gonna hear violence Tina no this alone now if you don't belong this side side churches or shut down Church oh my that's a pretty so on Facebook they're getting the jokes and they'll forget all about it oh but we won't forget about it because we really want the church is that is forced to stop preaching if we're alive at that time it's gonna blow up cuz well they made had a good thought because he said what about Jesus where he said there's gonna be two in a bed I'll take one leave one there'll be two in a field I'll take one and leave one see the bride will be going about her regular regular work because it's gonna be a slow increase we'll keep going about the things of our life will be pretty stirred up here on Wed Sunday did you see that happening things you see that praise God the rapture is gonna be soon raising our but we'll keep going back to work we'll keep meeting like brothers o co-worker you really got to come to church now o come Holy Roller leave me alone yeah yeah left me alone all these thirty years you know no really this might be the time of the rapture and will almost be like Noah right Noah's family was like it's gonna close pretty soon you need to come get in the Ark in the back I'll come on I'll have time to get saved next year come on now our arc is Jesus Christ Mary's God will be going through the same thing they did because we're walking where the Apostles have trod amen see it's just gonna slowly boil up and get more difficult for us not for them they love the things of the world they're gonna be dark it's not gonna huh Facebook I'm gonna keep scrolling like on their Facebook page yeah huh well Jeff sees no longer preaching I'm not surprised Holy Roller thought he was better than everybody honestly that's right that's how we feel like when the people get arrested that need to be arrested like it's about time they got arrested put him in jail lock him up cuz I know which side they're on and I know it's I'm on I'm on Christ siding the Lord hallelujah so see they don't really care about our side and I care about them but I just thank God God's doing justice now revelation 13 program said the Holy Spirit said pick up your pen and write and he said revelation 13:16 he said I believe according to revelation 13:16 that the true Bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the Word of God he said the Holy Spirit told me to say that now I'm not saying every word and there's a prophecy because and this is why because there's no less say at the Lord at the end but I believe there's inspired words in there so this is our second scripture for the squeeze and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads now that's I think that's a for our sermon spoken word original C 1962 I appreciate years ago I preached just a whole series on fast forward to the last or and you'll hear about them say this I believe a quarter revelation 13:16 that the bride will be forced to stop preaching doesn't say squeeze he calls a boycott they'll boycott our churches they say oh you can't have church they'll lock our doors he said because well she'll be forced to stop preaching because she preaches against all their nonsense and brother I said Jesus won't like it so he's gonna be real mad that he's gonna come take his bride and judge the see he's fighting for you praise God he wants you to overcome he's gonna blow around all those who persecute this way cuz it's his word and will his life amen any man that's half a man will stand up for his family let alone his wife his beautiful brand-new wife Lori like the mother bear will fight for her babies how much more will Christ fight for his wife what do you mean you he's saying you can't make my bride stop preaching that's fine it works in my playing anyway honey come here now I'm gonna put all judgment upon them honey come here I'm gonna snatch you oh that's what it means the word caught up means to snatch away violently he's gonna come down here and he's gonna snatch her away she's gone where'd she go where she go she went to be with her Lord she went to her wedding glory your wedding in the sky hallelujah that's right Church so that's what the squeeze is it's this tension it's gonna be very slow now could be fast but that's what I believe I bet it'll be very slow the world will be saying peace and safety peace and safety peace and safety and the Bible say you don't worry about it because you know the times and seasons hide you know the time that scene where they meant cuz brother man told us the times and seasons he told us the times the seasons we'll know we'll see them going so far too far to try to stop the bride from preaching but will see us rising up in the book of Acts type of faith yes so let me try to close now I tried to preach about everything I put on my notes here as it helped today let me say a few more things and then I'm gonna get that established thought we are not looking for a national revival because motor ham said the last call already went to the US the state the Lord we're not looking for any other sign for the rapture because program said the last sign is already given it was his discernment like God gave to a right before Isaac arrived so the son of man ministry brother branham was the last sign brother BAM said to the Gentiles thus saith the Lord so we're not looking for a sign for all the Gentiles what we're looking for is for our condition to get in the right condition where the Bible says we're looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith we're looking to Jesus Christ saying Lord make me ready Lord am I ready God washed me made me right that's what we're looking for we're looking to Christ to get us in position to go but I was looking unto Jesus remember ok Hebrews chapter 12 we are looking unto Jesus Christ the author and finisher of our faith now go to Revelation 3 this is real familiar but I want to go over this if you wonder what your condition and my condition needs to be it's right in Revelation it's the opposite of Laodicea right so whatever Jesus read there's my hour - I'll finish your instrument whatever Jesus rebukes the layers in church age we got to be the opposite of that that's the sign I'm looking for brother Aaron is from my life to be more like what Jesus wants a hot on fire life a book of Acts church life that's what I'm looking for I'm not looking I mean we look at Israel but thank God for that you know we we see that she's in her position praise the Lord you know if we get to see the temple rebuilt hallelujah that'll give us even more zeal but if we know it's okay because we're seeing the Statue of a perfect man built we're seeing God's real body be built Paul said that we were built upon the foundation of the Apostles amen Jesus Christ the chief Cornerstone he's the cornerstone and the capstone Tina - America first of the last hallelujah right revelation 3:14 now let's go down to verse 15 I know that works without neither hot or cold I would that that work called a hot so we've got to have hot works now hot means boiling we got to have like continual activity with our works that means I'm continually praying right I'm continually reading my Bible I'm continually going to church I'm content they testifying to the milk the milkman or whatever here the mailman you're just boiling you're moving all the time doing something for the Lord so because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spue thee out of my mouth they can't notice they can't be the mouthpiece of Christ they can't speak the word of Christ verse 17 because they'll say us I'm rich and increased with Goods and have you nothing now so see what do we say then we say I'm poor of spirit because blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven ha ha ha how rich we are they're bragging how rich they are we say Lord I need more of you I'm increased with Goods look how look at all my goods I got and we're like we need to get rid of it because we need to have more spiritual Goods right don't you fight I constantly fight that trying to keep my house clean people just my mother my mother will send a bag of clothes I'm like oh my she'll carry the baggage little Mike Oh increase with Goods and have need of nothing help me Jesus yeah my grandma Tammy will throw in all these new toys at my elbow here we go trying to keep the house clean because it's increased with goods we got to be the opposite try to get rid of what we can so we can serve the Lord and have need of nothing so see they say we don't need more Holy Ghost we they say we need more Holy Ghost there's one thing I need more of Jesus Christ amen more death to myself but they're saying we don't need anything we got everything we're good having our millennium right now on the earth you guys say no this is not our home we want more of the word more death to self more obedience we want more of Jesus Christ see we say that so our condition has to be the opposite I constantly me to buy me gold try the fire code is time-tested faith because Peter says you're you're tested faith is more precious than gold that perishes so we're gonna have gold faith right like deity we're to see the deity of Christ manifested through our faith right cry in other words Christ is gonna live through us and give us overcoming faith yeah the fires of affliction we had to go we have to go through fires of affliction and go through them and overcome with faith that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed now raiment mother says what is Raymond said it's eternal life so you got to be born again and it represents the righteous of saints so when you're born again with the Holy Ghost you do the right things that's righteousness of faith and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve about man see so Paul says the eyes of your and light that I Lightning of your eyes be opened so you can see spiritually so when your eyes are anointed with the Holy Ghost you can see that it's not it's not it's not nighttime for us it's daytime for us we can see it's the season of the rapture praise God we got the whole armour of God on we got the full armor of God we got the sword of the king see we can come against any lust we come against any greed any fear we can come against that sickness we come against in the name of Jesus Christ so we got iced out we can see what's happening we're not blinded the Bible said the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that don't believe as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore repent we got to be quick to repent we got to be able to be able to quickly say Lord I'm sorry forgive me now let's stand I'm gonna get a few more scriptures I stand here as I'm closing I got two scriptures well I'm one one I'm gonna read Hebrews five again what the Bible say about the latter rain it said this I'm sorry James 5 sorry oh it's been good to be the church in the hostel or today the Bible said be patient for the latter rain establish your hearts for the coming of Lord Rolf 9 that means to stabilize and strengthen what do you need to be ready for the rapture a strong heart a heart that's unmovable he said establish your hearts right now you could interpret that as your emotions or it could be the soul of man right don't let your emotions be to be swayed but you set your affection on the things of God only care about and cry about and be happy about the things of God or it could mean the soul right it could mean that establish your soul in other words be sealed to the day of redemption strengthen your heart everything that you have believe with all your heart now the last one turn there Romans 16 now this is what I wanted to bring out to close so you know the rapture ladder rain and mysteries all go together no one's going the rapture without the revelation of the mysteries I'll tell you that right now that's scriptural no one's going the rapture without the revelation of the mysteries that's why Jesus Christ came back to reveal the mysteries now look at this look at verse 25 Romans 16:25 it's scriptural it's totally totally Bible now to him that is a power to stablish you what did James say you want you're waiting for that rain what'd he say establish your heart so paul is saying the same thing years later this is 20 years later because it's all the same spirit praise God the same author really wrote the whole Bible he said but now to him that's power established you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to what what is the preaching of Jesus Christ according to according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began amen glory your heart is only strengthened based upon the revelations you receive from the Bible amen hallelujah some people go overboard on mysteries which means they inject false doctrine some people go overboard on doctrine that means they were never born again in the first place but anyone who's ever a part of the rapture will have the true understanding of the mysteries and will live the doctrine of Jesus Christ because it's God's doctrine it's God's life can I say like that it's God's life this is his way to live see but now I was made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for what why did wise is revealed to us for the obedience of the faith the bride is the only group on the earth that obeys God amen all the only ones were the only ones that really obeying Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mysteries of God That's not me Church that was where in 2,000 years ago and then a revelation 10 says a books coming down seven thunders or other voices and then a messenger takes it and finishes the mystery of God and then takes it around the world to me it makes perfect sense I don't about you if you don't you need to get some ice a bone this morning here come here I got some it's right in here let me let me rub it I'll rub it right on your eyes I know all right come over here let me put on your eyes right now it's right here it's the word it's the blocked ISM in Jesus Christ's name it's the Godhead it's the Serpent's eat it's all these things that God has revealed to us so we can live a godly life do you believe that with all your hearts he said while you're waiting for the ladder rain just establish your hearts strengthen your hearts get stronger every time you come to church it's your choice you can either lose your reward or gain your reward how many want to gain it today musicians come let's let's pray for that let's pray to God established my heart according to the revelation of the mysteries of God that were hidden God for the obedience of the faith oh my thank God amen let's bow our heads for a moment can we just let's just take a moment Church in your own way just talk to Jesus and say thank you for that your mysteries and thank you for your doctrine can we just do that just tell me your own heart lord thank you for your revelation Lord this book was sealed Lord before but now it's open to your God the Reformers couldn't understand the mysteries but we can because you came and you open the book Lord God they still wrestle not at Lord predestination and and serpent seed and doctrines and

on us which we know we've got to answer for the talents you've given to us to who much is given much revelation of him much is expected because we've been given so much revelation we no more will be

preparing for he knew that latter rain was coming so he had to plant the seeds for the latter rain to come that rain will heart that rain will Harvin or Summit surely those seeds into real original seeds of Christ I feel all message terminology today and spirituality today but this is is it true is it the Bible absolutely we hang our souls on it it's thus saith the Lord why do we hate sin because we love the Bible why can't we go to other churches because they don't love the Bible and it makes this The Exalted Word of God it makes this have preeminence above everything else because Jesus Christ is the word of God amen one day he'll ride back with a vesture on his side and it'll be the blood and I'll say the blood of Jesus Christ it'll say though his name is the word of God oh
