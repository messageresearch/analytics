[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lastly [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] let's stand here we'll take our bibles tonight by god's grace let's go back to ephesians 5. like to continue with the mystery of the church as bride ephesians 5 [Music] 32. ephesians 5 32 thank you and i don't have any slides tonight case just so you can just focus on the scriptures honey thank you very much i appreciate that let's look at part two tonight of the church as bride again the fact that jesus has a bride is commonly understood but the mystery is which group is the bride that's the mystery and it's the bride who pleases the lord in all things praise god the bride that submissive to every command of jesus amen so let's read this ephesians 5 32. then we've got to read our memory verse got to get back to that habit uh in first samuel all right let's read our our text here tonight let's read this together on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church first samuel 17 17-47 praise god this is what we want to know praise god in every battle the lord will save us not by our strength but by his let's read this on three one two three and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands let's have one more word of prayer here heavenly father lord we just come reverently before your throne lord this is the time that where lord your word is to bring life it's to impart life to the hearers faith comes by hearing so lord increase our faith tonight lord god especially with this subject that we're the bride and lord give us assurance that we're the bride because we keep your commands by your grace as we said on sunday you keep giving us more grace and let us abound in the grace of obeying your word lord and uh let us abound in the grace of of generosity lord in faith in utterance the lord with this topic let us abound in faith of obedience to all your word lord wash us in your word tonight lord with your water your living waters wash us lord that we're clean that we're obeying all your commands in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated okay so we will look at this thought here i'll set my timer here give me let's do 45 minutes actually i'll do 40 because we're a little bit over as it is all right now we looked at part one on sunday and we focused on uh what the confusion was and then we looked at uh all the scriptures where jesus and the john the baptist speak of a bride and a bridegroom how many believe that's scriptural everybody see that in the scripture i know lydia milk i did a lot of reading for me so thank you uh but it's clearly scriptural it's not something we've started it's not something brother branham started it's something jesus christ and john the baptist started right and even before that god started it with with israel praise god because he loved the fathers of the faith like abraham isaac and jacob now now with this mystery church we see how not only does jesus have a rulership position but he has a feminine counterpart in lydia that's the good words he gave me a feminine counterpart to jesus's masculine role okay so there's a feminine role to jesus's masculine role okay because remember it takes both remember when god created adam and eve he created one or both of them in his image first he created one spirit and the spirit was both male and female but then he divided the spirits and put him in separate bodies and so god has a a part that's submissive about him and a part that's very dominant about him praise god now he he gives jesus christ in this case the dominant part as husband and he gives the bride the submissive part how many will learn to be more submissive to jesus praise god when it's uh hard and we want to do what we want to do may god help us to have a submissive attitude where we do what jesus wants us to do i know he'll help us if you really desire that church i know he'll he'll help you now i'd like to uh look at a few scriptures here uh that kind of show and i put this kind of in the introduction chapter of the book lord willing the bible is the ultimate love story right we know god's love is great the bible said for god so loved the world remember church keep in mind there the bible said god doesn't delight in the death of sinners right but yet jesus wouldn't pray for the world and yet he sends the disciples into all the world to preach the gospel to every creature so we see god uh god the father he so loves all his creation and he would he would desire all would be saved because god is the ultimate source of love the best word that we can describe god is love right god is love this love was so great that he planned for jesus to be slain before the foundation of the world so before the world was even settled god already had the idea in his mind i'm going to provide a sacrifice i'm going to send my son to die for my bride's sins praise god amen the ones that i love and the ones that love me i've already got it planned out i'll send us an aw sufficient sacrifice that will pay the price of my bride's sins amen he planned this way before you got here right he already had this all set up already knew all about it he was gonna he already had a plan to take care of your sins and so that you would know you're lovely in the sight of god amen we could never be lovely with our sins on us but he pre-planned a way that oh they can be lovely they can be clean by a substitutionary righteousness i'll share my righteousness with them i'll take their filthiness and i'll put it on my righteous son and we'll trade we'll trade his his righteousness for their unrighteousness by substitution praise god and then remember the bible said god love you so much he chose you in him before the foundation of the world remember he chose you by predestination he knew you'd want to serve him and that's how he could choose you and then he predestinated the events of your life so he would be close to you and that you could seek after and find him isn't that something you know god put us in america because he knew we'd love him right and he knew there would be believers close to us praise god notice he didn't put us in a sinful nation right like that hardly going to have anybody saved in it right the bible said he'd place us so he would be close to us and we could seek after and find him amen i like that praise god god wanted to give us a chance he knew we'd love him so he gave us a chance to seek after him and find him so let me say this to our young people you know this is a great opportunity in your free time before you get busy and you got to pay your house and and before you got to serve a husband or wife this is your time to seek god now mommy and i do right in our in our humble little ways but god ordained it so you have a time to seek after the lord and find him praise god when life doesn't have as much stress on it or responsibility and i'm glad i found god in college before the all the big events happened before we started having children i'm glad uh god found me and i found him before i was even married praise god so i had that time to dedicate to seeking god and that's what our children should do amen now god sets up our lives like a hide and seek romance and it's just like uh jesus describes in the bible jesus is the bridegroom christians are the earthly bride now jesus is the pro god is the primary seeker because he says you've not chosen me but i've chosen you of course this speaks of the earthly right because in heaven he had to predestinate knowing our choice so earthly no man is going to seem like he's sought or he's chosen god god's going to seek him out and find him because paul says there's none that seeketh god right so how can we get saved well god foreknew that we want to serve him so that he can seek and save that which was lost see god it's god who seeks and gives every good and perfect gift even our faith is a gift there'll be no man that can boast for working to gain the salvation of the lord god loves to be the seeker in this romance praise god scripture says god searches for all those who will worship him in spirit and in truth see there's something even about people that aren't in the message that we love why do we love them because they love truth right because that's what god's looking for if they won't take the spirit if they want to take the anointing the holy spirit at least they'll have some truth god loves that god's searching for and then he'll take the people that love the holy spirit anointing but don't have as much truth praise god but see we ought to have both praise god we have both the spirit and truth because that's what god is seeking he comes to seek and save that which was lost remember god wanted to hover over jerusalem and protect her like her brood right but israel turned him down you know the bible says that god sought for a man in the days of noah but he only found one let's read genesis 6. can you put genesis 6 8-9 up here see god is always searching around looking for somebody to use and children that's why you get up and read your bible that's why you get up and pray because god's seeking for you to do that he's seeking you he's seeking to use you praise god even now he wants to use this so he's always seeking goes around about through all the world seeking who he can use for a work now yep six eight and nine but the noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god amen so the whole world god couldn't find too many but he found noah remember the bible said that god was long-suffering he wanted lots of people to get in the ark but they turned him down and so god had to flood the whole world so noah here and his two sons and their wives were the only ones that were seeking after god's righteousness i like that they kept hammering away right isn't that what we're doing tonight we're just hammering away praise god is our ark full of people no was noah's ark full of people no right but we keep hammering away praise god because like it was in the days of noah so shall be in the days of the coming of the son of man just keep hammering away just keep living the truth just keep living a righteous life and i like that he did it because he was saving his family the bible said amen that's why our husbands and our wives are here that's why our parents bring our children here we keep pounding away because we want our families to be saved he the bible said he did it for the saving of his house praise god in hebrews 11. so see that proves eternal life for our parents right the parents that are here that bring their children here on sundays of course it proves eternal life you're living for your children you're living for them to have another chance to hear the word of god amen that's right so god's love is constantly seeking and he found one in noah's day or three in noah's day three men and their wives and here he finds a small bride today now let's look at song of solomon just for a moment here uh let's go to song of solomon five people up song psalm in five verses six seven and eight now here's a beautiful picture uh remember solomon of course represents christ millennium son of david now here's a beautiful picture of how god likes to feel love as well right god likes to be sought as well now ultimately we know he's the main seeker he seeks after us but god likes the romantic drama as well he likes the suspense as well he likes when his children cry out to him right that's why brother ram said god made the babies with ability all they can do is cry so they cry out to their prayer and the parent hears their cry and so it is with god and his children god loves the earth children cry out and seek for his help and he loves to answer praise god i opened my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil for me i charge you daughters of jerusalem if you find my beloved that you tell him that i'm sick of his love so we get the picture of here that she didn't respond quick enough to the husband right but the husband of course he would be loving to his wife but she says make sure you tell him that i'm looking for him right and so that's how the bride is today the bride you know we're seeking after god we're calling on god god loves to be sought after god loves to be prayed to amen god loves to be worshipped amen and of course we know in the story that eventually he finds they find one another and then marriage bliss ensues right remember the bible said god is a god that hides himself the bible says it's the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honor of kings to search out a matter so see when uh when god kind of hides himself it gives us an opportunity to sow to show some godly character to show some royal blood right to show that we have royal spiritual blood inside of us amen because only king search out the truth praise god only queens seek out the truth right those who truly love god that's why god hides himself i emailed to a brother this week he was saying why does god make it so hard or why does god hide himself i said because it's going to just it's going to distinguish between the bride and the foolish right it's going to distinguish who really wants to know it praise god amen who really wants to know god who really wants to know his heart who's really after the heart of god amen praise god yes sometimes god will hide himself on purpose until we cry out in desperation that's found in uh go to proverbs 2 okay 3 4 and 5. proverbs 2 3 4 5. so see god calls him his hiding he's hiding treasures so you know how the world likes that easter egg hunt you know that's really what god wants to do with us praise god except the treasures aren't eggs the treasures are seeds of the word praise god amen see this is the wisdom book right this is we preached on this a few years ago if thou christ after knowledge and lift up thy voice for understanding why doesn't god just give us just give us what we want right away see god likes to be sought after god likes to uh hear your prayers amen god likes to be in contact with us if you seek her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then thou shalt understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god right and so if you're digging for gold or if you're digging for silver how many know that's a really in-depth process i should have pulled that up i didn't pull that up but you could pull it up easily how long is it pretty easy to find gold or silver no it's very difficult so god says this is the character of my bride the bride will dig until she strikes gold amen praise god the bride will dig until she strikes silver redemption right gold deity amen and this will separate the people that just want a a a superficial relationship with god they won't they won't dig very deep will they right they won't dig very deep but the ones that really love god they'll keep digging until they find uh the blessings of god the treasures of god because that's why they're out there they're out there to find treasure amen and god just doesn't put the treasure on the top god puts the treasure deep underneath and his bride will keep uh digging until she strikes treasure hallelujah then see after you search after you dig then you find the fear of the lord and the knowledge of god see so god hides himself because he loves to be sought and he loves to feel your love as well remember that's church that's what he died for that's what he died for he didn't die to make us robots he died for our free free moral agency love can i say it like that does that make sense that free choice where someone freely chooses to love him because of truth because of his spirit because of his character you freely choose it that's why he died on the cross to win your love the bible said for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross the joy of what the joy of your worship the joy of your love oh god that's beautiful praise god thank you jesus he loves to hear our prayers remember he said you have not because you don't ask he loves to feel the need there see god loves romantic success suspense and fulfillment so we place it in our lives both naturally and spiritually we're sought after praise god god seeks after us until we give in amen perhaps this is why everybody likes fairy tales right and heroic stories of strong men that save people save their wives save the the beautiful princesses right because it reminds us that god is heroic he's defeated all of our enemies to save us amen all of our sins all those demons jesus has cursed them jesus has overcome them he's delivered us from the power of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of light glory and he's made us a spotless glorious beloved wife all right now so that's kind of this idea here how we get the bride why is the bride so important uh because it's a special group of people that brought by their free more agency they want to please jesus their husband in everything praise god now here's how we'll identify the true bride group today of course we believe we're part of it but we can prove other groups are not part of it we'll eventually get to those we'll name each of these groups and show how they're not part of the bride because of obvious scriptures of paul that they turn down right because paul said if you change one thing you're blessed no you change one thing you're cursed so see some of them a lot of churches have short-term curses remember we talked about that permanent curses or short-term curses right we preach on that and so disobedience brings a short-term curse at least a punishment a chastisement but if totally rejected then it brings a eternal separation from god so we're going to see the attributes of the true church and she is identified by complete submission to the bible blueprint given to paul by christ amen now church here's what we can do the bible said we don't judge people's destinies we judge their fruits of their current lives right we're allowed to judge their current works we're not judging their destinies right we can say generally you know the the mother harlot church and the daughter churches they'll be lost but we don't know which persons will be in it but we are told to judge fruit praise god when you go to the grocery store you pick out some apples and oranges you just take any bag sometimes i felt like i've done that but i haven't meant to do that i want to choose the bag that's got good fruit in it praise god and that's what jesus says by their fruits you shall know them so all these groups saying their bride all these groups saying they're jesus's true people we are to judge their fruits because a tree is known by its fruit and we don't have to wonder if we're the true bride we just got to put jesus's eye salve on right and the bible says we can prove all things and hold fast that which is good if you have jesus spirit inside of you you'll discern the true spirit from the false because the bible said try the spirits whether they are of god amen and the holy spirit will guide us into all truth now on sunday we looked at the god search for a bride in israel but we didn't finish it so i want to finish it so let's go uh let's go to hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5. hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5. now we brought it up to the spot in jeremiah where god called israel a backsliding woman he said i'm married to you but you've dealt treacherously with me but i'll heal your backslidings amen now hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5. hosea i preached on this years ago was one of the first services where brother amen was there and we had a wonderful time i remember uh naomi and beatrice were there as well i remember that by god's grace over at that other tiny church there uh hoseo was used by god to show israel that he was a faithful husband and israel was an adulterous wife god told the prophet not to marry the virgin daughter of the of the other prophet right but to marry a gomer to show israel was unfaithful they have a few children but in hosea 3 verses 3 4 and 5 hosea said unto her thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will i be for thee for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without a ephod and without taraphim verse 5 afterwards shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king amen and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days praise god so this is of course speaking prophetically right hosea said he was confident gomer was now going to be faithful because he had to buy her back out of slavery right and he's confident i know she's going to be faithful now because her backsliding is what caused her to be shown to slavery but god uses this to tell israel that i'm not done with you i'm going to bring you back in the latter days praise god amen this is the 144 thousand who accept jesus christ during the tribulation period and this fulfills isaiah 54 verse 5. so okay shall pull that up there isaiah 54 verse 5. remember he said you're going to be faithful and i'm going to be faithful to you what is he speaking of he's speaking of israel in the millennium isaiah 54 verse 5. this is a beautiful scripture for thy maker is thine husband praise god and that just doesn't apply to israel right that applies to all of us as well who made you the lord jesus right he's your husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called so god is our husband our creator is our husband it's comforting to know the very one who made these hands the very one who made these eyes and the very one who gave me this head of hair the very one who gave me that is the one who wants to be married to me praise god is the one who wants to take care of me as the one who wants to love me praise god what a comfort you know why because if he did this one this good where everything works you know everything and everything seems to be working okay if he did it this well and it makes it work what about eternity if this life if this world is is this good what about each eternal life praise god it'll be even better by god's grace now say in isaiah isaiah 62 verses 4 and 5. so not only is your maker your husband but the land you're going to is called married land buila land can i say it like that so remember church this america is not beulah land unless you want to be married to the world unless you're going to be married to the god of this world no no israel once this earth is purged over with fire israel is married land praise god that's what the scripture says thou shalt no more be term forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hez or hef ziba and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married now if he delights in israel then you know he delights in the bride for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall god rejoice over thee how does jesus feel about you tonight he rejoices over your love praise god don't be discouraged church if he rejoices over the jews who's still under pursue blinded under the blood of bulls and goats which can't even have blood right they can't even have blood on this earth then he's surely rejoicing over us who are rejoicing in his blood in his sacrifice and letting him wash us with the water of his word yes god is going to have a bride a beautiful jew and gentile bride and they're going to have a thousand year honeymoon remember jesus was god incarnate in in the search for a faithful mate he was sent to israel first but they demanded his blood to be shed and they wanted him killed so acts 15 14. can you pull that up there so god paul says fine i go to the gentiles israel rejected jesus and they rejected his name so god went to the gentiles to find a bride called by his name james declared this semen hath declared how god is the first to visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name we got anyone named mrs jesus christ tonight praise god he want a people for his name mrs lord jesus christ and the righteous still run into that name and they're still saved tonight now spiritually you have your name but you're going to be given a new name after the wedding which is the rapture and the reception the marriage supper and then the millennium the honeymoon and then in the new jerusalem you get a new name once you move into that new house so that's revelation 3 12. can you go there okay i'm sorry lydia so we have the spiritual name of the lord jesus him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and i'm going to go down well i'll read this and he shall go no more out see that's the that's the bride there she don't have to go out anymore okay now here we go uh which is new jerusalem the name of my city which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i'll write upon him my new name amen speaking of marriage right we're speaking of marriage the bride getting a new name in the new jerusalem and this will be a bride that doesn't fall right like eve fell israel fail or fail rather brother brahma even says the church the bride fell the gentile bride fell down through the church ages right they turned down some truth and there was very very few at times who were born again but god never left himself without a witness now tonight let's move on to this next section i'm looking at the apostolic blueprint for becoming a bride member now paul says in second corinthians 11 2 i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband then i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ now let's look and see how paul espoused the church so let's go to acts 18 1. let's see how paul espoused the church and if paul said that he he he uh what he engaged uh christ to the people let's see how he did it acts 18 1. after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them and because he was the same craft he bowed with them and wrought for they for by their occupation they were tempt makers and he reasoned the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks where did paul go fishing he went fishing in churches right where'd he go fishing for souls remember the bible said he that wins souls is wise oh my that's interesting he that wins souls is wise where did paul go to win souls the group that had the most recent revelation that hadn't heard their true revelation verse 5 and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ now look at that see god put such a press on his heart a church that's what we've got to be looking for when god put something on our heart we got to move upon it right we talked about that with the new riot the new wine right with elihu see god pressed that upon him that that that that wine was bubbling up right and he just had to say it praise god praise god and there was results when he said it god gave him results verse 6 and when they had opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiments unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go into the gentiles and he borrowed a dents and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue and christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all of his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized so can you imagine that a whole family comes in the message right paul goes there he preaches there in the jewish synagogue but one family receives it the whole house receives it perhaps there were servants in there right imagine that a whole heart a whole house automatically one night flips for christ amen and then he baptized every one of them in that house praise god oh what a what a time of rejoicing for that family they all passed from death unto life in one night praise god they all got baptized he that wins souls is wise verse 9 then spake the lord to paul in the night by vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i much people in this city and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them okay so paul said i espoused you i engaged you to jesus christ how did he do it he preached about christ and he baptized them praise god so the people that preached to you and you believed and got baptized those are the people that engage you to jesus praise god that's why i think so much of brother brooks right and brother craig and the ones that now craig spent a lot of time teaching me individually like verse 11 says a year and six months so we thank god for those that we heard the message from simon shared the message with me and i got baptized so i was espoused to christ through the preaching of brother brooks and simon's witnessing and brother craig and paul said this is how believers become bride members they hear the word they believe they get baptized and they sit there and get taught for a long time because paul was there a year and six months so paul's just like eliezer right eliezer went to rebecca told rebecca the marriage term she said yes and she had to travel all that distance to get to isaac right same thing here with paul paul's like eliezer he preaches to rebecca the church at corinth they get saved and they got to go on a long journey till they see jesus amen praise god aren't you glad church you're on the journey to see jesus amen oh and i'm watering the camel tonight praise god amen i'm watering with my praise i praise you jesus i thank you jesus amen i'm warning the camel it's going to take me to my isaac now church remember it's important to say we're not physically married to christ right now because we're not with him and his physical body but the bible says we're engaged the bible says we should be married in romans 7 verse 4 that you should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god so see we're spiritually married to jesus by the vow in our hearts but not physically that's where all those churches get off in the message they say oh see the cloud came down in 1963. so jesus is here the rapture already took place what a bunch of nonsense and then they live like devils right yeah they say they're married to christ right they say they're married to jesus now that jesus is on earth they don't need a fast anymore i've talked to brothers in arkansas all that believe that and they live like the world you're telling me you live like the world when your husband's with you you cheat with cheat on your husband and flirt with the world while your husband's right here no sir no sir hallelujah right we're engaged to christ and this is the proving time are we going to keep the word of our vow or not amen hallelujah that's what we're doing tonight we're making sure we're keeping the vile that we made to jesus amen so when he comes back we'll be ready to meet him praise god we'll have the engagement ring on we'll have our dress on we'll be waiting there all ready to go praise god hallelujah thank you jesus yeah the bible said when we see him face to face we're changed into the wife at that moment first corinthians 13 12 then shall i know even as i'm sorry now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even also as i am known see we don't know jesus as well as we're going to know him once we get face to face then we're really going to know him better praise god we know now but it's dark it's it's dark it's it's a glass darkly it's a little bit cloudy we don't quite understand all things but when we see jesus we'll be changed and we'll know him as he knows us amen as husband and wife praise god thank the lord philippians 3 20-21 says he shall change our vile body you think jesus is going to marry a vile body no he's got to change it would you marry a vile body no you wouldn't change a dead vile body right you wouldn't marry a dead vile body he said we're going to change our vile body that we may be fashioned like unto his glorious body praise god that's the f that's the body change that's the marriage ceremony when you get the body changed totally pure he takes a bride who's pure not vile but she's holy she's just like he is praise god first john 3 2 says but when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is praise god amen so don't let anybody tell you that you're physically married to jesus already it's not true we're married but we're spout we're engaged in him by the vow we're spiritually married in our hearts right by the vow but we're not physically married yet that happens when we get the new body praise god now you know on the day of pentecost church 3 000 souls were espoused to christ so what they do they faithfully assembled they were hungry for true teaching and they were enthusiastic to help one another with their physical needs so see we have a right to question people if they're not concerned about other christians needs if they don't want to gather more with christians if they don't get excited about the word of god and teaching and praising god if they don't get excited about that we have a question to believe if they really got that that ring of engagement praise god right because the very first group that was ever engaged in jesus the bible said they continued steadfastly in the doctrine and fellowship breaking bread prayers and they had all things in common and i meant that on sunday when i said that on sunday let me know if anybody needs anything i mean that let me know if you need anything last year we had somebody take me up on that a couple times they needed some help so we helped him out by god's grace and i appreciate that that's why we're here and i love it god has provided for us again and again and again praise god we never ran out thank the lord they continued in one accord in the temple in the church see they went from house to house they were glad singleness of heart they praised god and the lord added as should be saved so anybody that wanted to be saved the lord would add them but they had no want to be saved right he's not going to force people into our church and we don't want people forced into our church we want people that want to be saved now every bride member church becomes a new creature in christ acts 26 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from the darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me so see when you when someone really becomes a spouse to christ their eyes are open they turn from the darkness see they're not they're not in love with the world anymore they turn from darkness to light they're not under the power of satan anymore they're under the power of god they're the power of holiness they're under the power of forgiveness praise god amen none of the power of victory and deliverance amen that's the power they live under praise god paul compared his previous life to being engaged with christ to dung right now what a smell dung is right imagine the smell right but then remember paul says my previous life was like dung he said but my not my life now is a sweet savor unto the lord amen praise god what a difference done and then fine spices and incense oh my there's 40 minutes already mercy goodness stop it already this this watch must be broken oh it's almost 8 o'clock my goodness ah okay well we'll have to close here let me see how much i got in this next section here okay i'll finish this section it's not too long now go to first timothy 1 13 first timothy 1 16. i'm sorry 113. now we're talking about how do you become a bride member you follow the pattern that god gave or christ gave to paul you believe the preaching you get baptized you stay in teaching you can be taught you love the word of god you love to praise god you love to worship praise god you love to take communion with the saints and you become espoused or engaged to jesus christ now paul says who was before a blasphemer so paul was a bride member but he used to blaspheme the bridegroom and the persecutor and injurious but i obtain mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus this is a faithful sin and worthy of all exception that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief how be it for this cause i obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which adhere after believe on me and life everlasting right to life everlasting did did you catch that church look at what paul said paul said i'm the chief of sinners he said i'm the least of the possible at least of the apostles and on the least of the saints praise god think about that least unto the saints right chief of sinners lisa the apostles so he considered himself the lowest of the low but because and this because of this because he considered himself so low god could exalt him so high praise god amen so let us never get exalted that's why we can't get the bride pride doctrine going on right or the lazy layer to seeing we can't just relax and do nothing paul didn't relax and do nothing paul got busy working for the lord because he realized i'm nothing i failed i've done so many sins i'm so awful i want god's grace to work mightily in me praise god and he said i'm a pattern to them which should believe hereafter to life everlasting so the pattern is think lit think low of yourself and that will cause you out of your love for being saved that will cause you to labor more for christ and other people now i'm going to write that down here because i forgot about that one he said he's the chief of sinners i i had this thought years ago i preached it i remember preaching at cams and they really liked it i just forgot about it and i just it just came back to me all tonight all three of those all four of those scriptures come back to me tonight praise god so what's your pattern your patterns like paul you were a blasphemer injurious persecutor you didn't love god chief of sinners but god had mercy on you amen and god gave you abundant faith and god gave you abundant love praise god that's his pattern that he uses to save all or to engage all of his bride members unto him praise god all right that's the pattern for all future bride members now next paul did the same thing paul did the same pattern in every bride church he went to first he'd win new converts and then he would spend significant time teaching them god's word and then he would before he left he would ordain faithful men as elders and leaders to oversee the converts okay and this is clearly seen in acts 14 21. so okay can you pull it up there acts 14 21. and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god and when they obtained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed wow look at that before they determine who who are going to be the shepherds to feed these bride members they prayed and fasted right who's going to take care of jesus's bride we better pray and fast about that to make sure we got the right choice and i just heard if it's okay i hope johnny's okay with it johnny fasted about three or four days before he uh proposed to his wife i thought what a testimony what a good example i thought here look same thing here fasting before they leave jesus's bride behind right they're fasting god give us a faithful eleazar amen give us a faithful shepherd to feed jesus's bride amen they won't harm they won't hurt jesus's bride they pray and fast to make sure that jesus bride can be fed what an example so we can see this is how the saints always acted right they always acted this way get soul saved teach them the word of god before they leave praying fast get them faithful brothers to preach them god's word amen all right let's close here now you know this is true paul only had one pattern because he told titus and timothy the same requirements for pastors and deacons in titus 1 and 1st timothy chapter 3 there's this they're almost like parallel passages he tells titus the same thing this is what a pastor must be this is what a deacon must be and it's repeated to both timothy and titus god told or sorry paul told titus he said for this cause i left the increte that you should set order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee praise god hold up second timothy 2 on verse 1. ii timothy 2 1. ii timothy 2 1-2 now there i'm sorry thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus remember because grace is going to enable you remember you saw that on sunday grace is going to help you be a better giver grace is going to help you be have more faith right so he says be strong in the grace that the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also praise god so you see the same pattern jesus sends an eleazar to preach to the people souls get converted then he stays there teaches them for a little while before the eliezer leaves he sets more shepherds there to feed their souls and this is how the bride gets called this is how she gets uh espoused to jesus christ let's stand to our feet praise god very simple but oh so life-changing my so life-changing think about that how come when i went to now when i first got saved i went to good churches you can stop the livestream god bless the livestreamers here you know my first one say god say
