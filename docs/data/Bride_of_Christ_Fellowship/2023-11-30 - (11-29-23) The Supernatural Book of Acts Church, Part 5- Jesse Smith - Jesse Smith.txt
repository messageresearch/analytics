TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Supernatural book of Acts church I think it's part five or four five I had a different thought I was going to preach a different thought tonight and I started studying like a I just start read through acts six like all these thoughts that coming to me that's normally how God works not always but I just kind of felt more inspiration here as I went to that thought tonight so acts 6 verse1 I love Acts chapter 6 because it shows here's a side of the church that we normally don't think about when we think book of Acts Church our first thought usually isn't murmuring is that your first thought when someone preaches on you're the book of Acts church it's your first thought murmuring and disputing that's usually your last thought right or my last thought but this is something to remember even amongst the people that had the full power of the Holy Ghost we'd say the people that were most yielded to God the very birth the very uh U infancy of the church There Rose up sin right there's just they're they're still Sinners saved by grace how many believe they're Sinners saved by grace yes no doubt um and so here we'll start with this and then we'll kind of see how the Lord directs here acts 6 verse one this is really I think the first if I'm not mistaken as I've preached this and been reviewing this this might be the first kind of like sin we see in the book of Acts Church other than ananas and sa fire right but of course I'm not sure if they were actually part of the church I'm I'm more inclined to think they were just like Judas they kind of sold out and they got filled with Satan like Judas did I'm more inclined to think that but either way acts 6 we'll just read verse one by God's grace just to preserve our time it's already 7:05 that's read that on three 1 2 3 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily minist God blessing ring of hisek so I my a few times please forgive me so we'll try to look at this thought here tonight here our by the grace of the Lord again it's good to see all the saints here tonight appreciate everybody coming out to the house of the Lord hopefully hope hopefully you're looking forward to Sunday where brother Samuel coming and you know I were texting back and forth he's really looking forward to coming remember he's got three boys they're kind of malkey age they're kind of malkey buddies and I thought that's another good reason to get him out here fellowship and also want to give Mali some boy time he's got amen amen also like his older brothers you know but it's nice to have those teenage buddies with him and you can have some fellowship there by God's grace so we're looking forward to it you know it's been a while since we had brother Samuel I'm looking forward to hearing him Minister I was listening to a couple of his sermons last week and really enjoyed what I was here so uh we look at this thought here the supernatural book of Acts church is part five starting in verse one but I want to review just by reading this quote again from the church age book uh brother Bram says this he says the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that is exactly rightel and so the book of Acts is our blueprint brother Rand callon I don't work with blueprints I know Simon does extensively so Simon could teach us a good lesson on blueprints he has to study the blue blueprints over and over again the length of the pipes he's talked about it briefly I'll just that's all I can really remember he's got to get all the measurements all the layers everything all the pipes all the connections and so that's church that's what I as a pastor for 17 years I've tried to always look at the book of Acts and say uh what can our church do to be more like the book of Acts that's been my pattern amen and by God's grace I believe we're following it as closely as possible as close as I know how and remember on Wednesday I said there are some things there's Liberties right there's so much Liberty in the gospel and I gave the examples of how brother brandom asked the angel how should I do prayer lines and the angel said just as you're LED you didn't tell them so there was in other words there was no specific pattern in the book of Acts for prayer lines but God allows the the liberty and the freedom of different gifts of the holy spirit remember the Bible said there's Gifts of healing so they're not just one there's different kinds brother said some people he said well have the Bulldog Faith like or Roberts I don't know I if You' seen old Roberts you know some of the old videos but he'll just he'll put his hands on the person's head and he'll just yell at the Devil brother said at the beginning he got good results because he had Bulldog faith that was just one expression now brother RAM on the other side you never hear Brother Ram yell at the de the devil do you he just says Satan you know I rebuke you Satan I jur you by the name of Jesus Christ leave the person and then he says go on your way rejoicing you're made well amen so he never had to raise his voice like that uh but then you know our Roberts would kind of have that Bulldog Faith now my Ministry I'm more of a yeller at least in the times God answered my some of my prayers um not always you know pardon me but you just look at that you know so we have a blueprint but then there's areas of freedom and areas of Liberty so we want to keep that in mind as well and I think cam did a great job when he taught on the Sunday school you know the the youth activities there's liberty in that right and so that's what we experien you know we had our first youth meeting amen did an awesome job sister who to don't to leave you out you're both do a good job on that but that that's kind of the idea there and brother Ram even said Sunday school is not in the book of Acts anybody ever seen Sunday School in the book of Acts it's not in there so what is it it's an area of Liberty but you don't want to make that uh with with each thing you don't want to make it a tradition that loses its its sincerity okay okay uh so that's how it is with youth youth events and honestly this is why I told different Brothers I said you know some of the churches that are having the message churches now that are having some good revivals if they're not careful now what it looks like to me they're eventually going to get to the spot where all the emotion and excitement dies down and they're going have to go through this cycle again yes right every church has to go through I've seen it in our church I've seen in other churches it's just going through that cycle you got to go through the cycle because with with humans we just naturally get used to it things just become common to us but thank God we can always kind of shake ourselves off go talk to Jesus and come back to the blueprint and say Lord I want this again hallelujah amen bring me back to the sincerity brother said never forget the Wonder of the book of Acts The Wonder of the Holy Ghost right Hallelujah and so there's you know with within this blueprint I love it God gives us Liberty of expression uh because there's different size churches there's big churches there's small churches thank God he loves small churches too in fact the the book of Acts church was almost all small churches so we can we can we have that you know ability to say well we're most like the book of Acts in that way although it's not you know it's not a requirement or anything just an encouragement that we should do everything we should always try to be like it was in the book of Acts praise God now I just did this today and I want to make this as I go through the book of Acts Lord willing uh sometimes I stop in the middle of my series and I leave it and I'll come back to it but I just made a list of the different nine spiritual gifts that we've seen in the book of Acts thus far okay acts 24 we had tongues and we had I guess it was interpretation right I guess it was the miracle was in the speaking and the hearing right so that tongues and interpretation oh actually want to add that because they did hear that um in chapter two uh then the Holy Ghost said you're going to have prophecy dreams and visions and we had those praise God you had those Hallelujah uh now this is not these are not the nine gifts but Doctrine was in chapter 2 verse 42 and then teaching the angel let them out of jail we saw this on Sunday the angel let them out of jail and said go teach in the temple amen right so there's teaching that's now that's the five bold ministry right but I just want to bring those out too not only did you have Miracles tongues Visions prophecies but you have teaching too uh acts 32-7 and acts 4:16 and 22 the miracle of the lame man walked and leaped he never walked before but God the Bible called it a notable Miracle right or you might even call that a sign Wonder or Miracle now to me I'm just thinking about it now I think when God heal my mom of cancer that was a sign to Liberty Center that or that local area that was a sign and look what God did God brought three preachers out of that woman maybe more we're still waiting on a couple more Lord willing if they're watching this you know I love you Brothers Hallelujah that's my desire that was a sign that was a Wonder right and it even led to my friend's dad I told you that story of brother ainson Mr ainson him being healed too because I testified of that to him right before he almost died and then Simon went and prayed for him in chapter five Peter had discernment of the lie so there's one of the nine gifts so got Tong's interpretation prophecy we have Miracles discernment Right There is five out of the nine uh and then uh people got healed just by being in Peter's Shadow which the shadow has no virtue to it the prayer cloth has no virtue to it right being baptized in water the water has no virtue to it the church that amen God just uses that as a sign Wonder or Miracle amen amen so that you and I would stand in awe of God amen hallelujah amen and that brings us up to chapter six so just in those first five chapters we already have five out of the nine gifts have already been manifested now who knows how many does anybody remember how many years does the book of Acts cover from chapter one to chapter 28 does anybody remember how many 30 was it 30 or 28 what were you goingon to say h oh you know okay I thought say you say 30 I thought it was 30 scopio talks about it I just wanted I thought it was 28 but I could be wrong on that let me go check oh yeah well Scofield says 32 so real good real good that's good that's right on because Scofield is not God so think about that so already in the first few chapters we've already got five of the nine gifts operating and I went through a couple years ago and I wrote that book we've had all nine operate here in our 17 years of ministry so where people get hung up is where brother Ram will say you know all nine gifts need to be operating in every uh every Church well that's a good thought that's a that's a great desire but even brother Bram said we don't even have those in our church two years before he died in 1963 he said we don't have too many operating in our church isn't that something you know so we can see that okay now now you know having nine nine gifts operating every service that that's that was what we would call maybe ideal I'm not even sure if that's that ever happened in the book of Acts I'm not even sure right I can't prove it in other words I can't prove it by by the Bible the Bible never says Thou shalt have all nine gifts operating every service Church said so see that see that area of Liberty now we're talking about see that so we got to be careful not to add to the word of God right or and we don't want to take away either don't want to take away but if we're going to be Bible Believers if we're going if we're really going to believe the Bible let's point back to the blueprint amen all right now chapter one I'm sorry chapter 6 verse one sorry I bet verse one uh in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring you see what brother like what they say more people more problems right less people less problems that's true cam told me that he's like wow brother Jess he said you have a smart Church than us and I have all these problems he said he said it's true even if you have a few more it's more problems church you've been a wonderful Church by God's grace wonderful group of saints here we hardly have any problems by God's Gra so what does that tell me that means you're mature in the faith right you settle your problems one onone or you settle with Jesus one on one with Jesus Hallelujah you live a holy ghost filled life Hallelujah repenting of your sins just daily dying serving God growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord oh it's a joy to be a Christian praise God and what was the first M what's the first complaint in the church did you notice it's nationalities and races isn't that something remind you of anybody reminds you of St Peter I mean I've referen that over and over G galatian is it something right holy ghost fed people the first problem that rises is nationalities now church we should feel so blessed that we have all of our nationalities here and we're such a family of God right nobody ever walked out there in the fellowship room Sunday and said I'm not eating with the Smiths because they're Americans I'm not going to sit by brother Jesse he's American I thank you for that shows you got the right Spirit right amen is that but is that something and then look at some of the the problems in message churches today right it just goes to show you know you know as Christians we're going to struggle with one thing or another but I'm glad we don't struggle with that by God's grace glad because we have love one for another other words I see as much value in you as I see in myself right you're just as valuable as I am and if you need something I'm going to help you out praise God if there's anything I can do to help you out let me know I'll do it if I can by the grace of God but here the first one once you know see once your church gets bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger here the first problem is murmuring that means complaining uh There Rose up a complaint of the grecians so the Gentiles are complaining about the Jews and that something because their widows were neglected wow so the first two uh sins we'd say in the church other than lying of Anis of was murmuring and neglected church it's easy for us to feel overlooked sometimes I'll say it like this you know one problem amongst preach or message churches is the preachers get all the respect the preachers get all the attention right so it's easy to feel overlooked right I could easily see how some Churches could feel overlooked but brother but not only the brother Ram brother Ram said the preachers are actually should be the lowest because they're the they're the they're the servants but not only that but the Bible says God honors the Lesser Parts more than the other parts remember I preached that not long ago I think last year 1 Corinthians 12 says that God will honor the less seen ones more than the scene parts right so you've got the scripture for that Hallelujah we got script so so so what I'm try trying to say is don't let the devil try to convince you you're overlooked because if you're overlooked by man you'll never be overlooked by God because God brings the H the prideful down and he exalts The Humble right so God help us all just be as humble as we possibly can be praise God Amen so Gentile widows were neglected by Jewish Christians remember what Paul says later the wall between Jew and Gentile was knocked down that's a new testament Jericho if I ever seen what does that mean we've had a new testament Jericho right in the church amen amen our church there's no wall between us we're all just children of God hallelujah that just struck me up so let's so let's be an example of true unity and love praise let's continue to be that example hallelujah amen for all those who need a good example Hallelujah so remember this is part of the book of Acts church we say we want to be like the book of Acts Church well book of Acts churches have trouble sometimes right Hallelujah so this just being part uh this is just part of being a a Christian right we're gonna we're going to have lots of Victories we're going to have the the character of Christ but sometimes we're going to be overlooked sometimes uh we're going to be we're going to murmur and complain you know have to say you don't have to raise your hand I know this is a live stream but I'll be the first who admit sometimes I complain I feel sorry for myself and I shouldn't and God always humbles me somehow I always hear about somebody else's problem and I'm like me I have nothing to complain about I have nothing complain about like I even found it this week people are asking me how is your Thanksgiving how is Thanksgiving and the one thing I was saying oh we had three sick children I'm like why like forgive me Lord why should I been bringing up I should say my wife was healthy and made us a wonderful meal like amen what why am I even saying that you know just just wrong I shouldn't I should I shouldn't say all the positive things but murmuring and complaining and then neglect was the first uh the first problems and notice you know there were so people were so poor they daily come to the Saints to get food every day they had to come right so you Mom your parents with children you know what it's like every day uh can I have breakfast few hours later or I'm sorry a few minutes later I'm hungry again you just had breakfast can I have some more food I'm still hungry especially when they get real big but every day you know they come to you every day now pretty soon people got the Flesh and they just imagine that Jewish Christians just walk by and not give them any food can you imagine that Holy Ghost build saes you imagine Peter not eating with the Gentiles just want to emphasize that this is the book of Acts church right right but I love this in every problem God gives a solution praise God so the thing to do the thing to do is not focus on the problem let's pray for a solution praise God hallelujah because we're always going to have problems we're always going to have issues we're always going to have things we got to take care of but let's ask God lord show us the right leadership of the holy spirit so we can solve this problem amen and the people that are overlooked can be seen and heard amen amen hallelujah praise God grant it Lord grant it that all the complaining can stop the the the neglected can be ministered to hallelujah amen that your people can have their needs met Hallelujah their physical needs and remember James chapter 2 says if you don't meet someone's physical needs it doesn't mean anything to try to help them spiritually just remember that we got winter coming up let's remember that here that's good reminder if you see somebody without a coat let's try to get him a coat by God's grace like and we've had that talk you might not want to give him cash I don't give him cash anymore unless I that's all I have I just give him a water bottle or something like that but you know we just got to be really careful we got to just be led by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah now verse two oh no actually we didn't read Phil let's go to Philippians 21:14 I think we got time Philippians 21415 to 16 can you put up there patient so the Bible said they had murmurings but then Paul says by the Holy Spirit do all things without burs amen but that's in the book of Acts Church yeah that's in the book of Acts church sometimes we might dispute right we might dispute about things I'll try to think of some examples oh yeah brother Jesse uh you should wear you shouldn't wear short sleeves or something like that you know I was thinking one like people might struggle oh no no I I can wear short sleeves no you can't wear short sleeves you know just think of any dispute someone might have with somebody you know that just seem this frivolous right now this is a real dispute though because people are not being fed that's God really cares about people's needs being met Amen in other words we just we just got to be careful not to let disputes rise up and try to just meet the people's needs as much as possible try not to complain try not to murmur try not to dispute about things there's got to be a peaceful solution everybody can say Amen to amen all right verse 15 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God now were were these Saints in act chapter 6 the sons of God yes right we're not de christianizing them we're just saying we should all strive We should strive to do all things without murmuring and disput that should be our goal I'll say like this that's the word I'm going to use later the ideal We should strive for the ideal right it's not always going to be ideal but we should strive to live an ideal life that that's in much IM balance with the scripture as possible hallelujah it's not always going to be perfect it's not always going to be pretty we got to strive to do the best we can yes without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world verse 16 holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the Name of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain so see Paul's saying if we let murmuring and disputes and we let these other things if we let them rise up then sometimes he could he said I could lose my reward right so kind of like lot lot was saved but he lost all's reward so Mur like murmuring and disputes can lead to what people losing their rewards so we want to be humble we want to be blameless the sons of God grant it Jesus amen all right go to back to Acts chapter 6 here verse two then the 12 called the multitude of disciples under to them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables now reason means agreeable or acceptable so for them it's not acceptable that we should leave the word of God and then serve tables Hallelujah so um so here now we're getting to the ideal situation now how many know this how many know that brother random at one time was the pastor Deacon trustee and song leader and he said everything else how many know that nobody knew that okay GL I taught you something something new there huh Eden said she knew it so you knew it Eden ah you must have listened to church order this week 1963 it is church order 1963 brother R said look years ago he says when I pastored here I had to be the pastor Deacon trustee and everything else at once see but I had to do it because there was no one else now you don't have to do it that way see because you got men to carry this out then brother said when he got men he made them ushers and then he said I made the ushers he said he said uh he said they had books piled around here at the door setting a chair or something or other and when someone come in you show them a place to hang their coat and help them give them their seat give them a song book and ask them to be in prayer so brother Church once he got men he set ushers in the back and when people would walk in they he'd say oh can you can I hang up your coat for you you need a place to sit he said you need a song book and he said can you be in prayer please how many would like a brother back there to remind you to pray before service amen can we set set somebody up there for you no we should know that brother said either either pray or read your Bible before service now I've seen message churches I'm not trying to be critical but they put all these things up on the screen like birthdays and all these things and to me I'm like I'm not going that far it's time to pray and read your Bible I believe in praying for people I'll announce your birthday when it's your birthday was joking but to me when people start getting away from prayer and reading the Bible something's a little wrong there right it's just a little bit of the sacredness uh nature asked me a good question why don't we chew gum uh in church it's it's a good question we don't want to lose the sacredness of this place right this is a meeting place with God this is a place where a life can be changed in one moment praise God Amen or an answer to a prayer can happen in just one moment hallelujah amen we never want to lose the sacredness of that now we're going to we're going have to be tested not to let it become common we're tested all the time as we go through Seas the ministry we're to be tested all the time but we got to do everything in our duty every everything in our power to keep this a sacred Place Hallelujah remember brother Kevin remember he said when he went to per green church he said he was ch gum the first time and the the Deacon come by and said spit out your gum and you had a trash can Kevin spit it out he said I realized right away they were serious people how' you like that hat you on the back spit out your gum young man but it's it's the idea of you know this we're meeting with God here right we're meeting with God and so in the early church the preacher said it's not acceptable for us to be de but that's because they could have other brothers that were deacons brother brandom started a church and he had to be Deacon and everything else sound familiar I'm glad I got some help you know with trustees and song leaders I love it I love it um but it just it's it just shows me every church is different and you got to be as ideal as po just make it as ideal as possible like I said I've asked God for I've prayed right here and cried how many times in this sday probably find some of my tear tear stains there I've asked God if I could be a full-time pastor and give all my time so far God hasn't answered my prayer that doesn't mean he's not gonna but I want to be faithful I just want to be just as faithful as I can no matter what God's called me to do and so do you praise God I know you do too you just want to be just as faithful as you can at whatever God's called you to do amen like there's something else I I was going to share oh yeah that's this one too brother Brandon started pastoring even before was Ned anybody know that that okay so did Brother Craig boore remember brother Craig boore you've had him preach a couple time he was pastoring before he was even married Hallelujah but the Bible says a bishop must be the husband of and he must have his children and subjection so see we have a we have a blueprint but there is some flexibility in here when people are led by the Holy Spirit okay amen that's going to come up this going to be important a little later here by God's grace because we got to we want to be as scriptural as possible now I never we never want to break the word of God but look how God I'll just say like this God was gracious in those areas I think I shared it with would I share with amen yeah yeah two Sundays ago in hezekiah's day they had such a Revival and so many animal being sacrificed they didn't have enough priests to kill all the animals so they had to let men that were not priests now I think they still handled I think they were the coites I think they still handled like the the Tabernacle but they were not priests but God allowed them to be priests just for that moment and then when they were done they steep back interesting somebody could have went and said oh you're breaking Moses law you're you're guilty but then they were having Revival and it seemed like God was honoring their Revival Hallelujah didn't Seymour remember Seymour didn't even have children right and yet God used him to spearhead the beginning of the leoan church age brother R said the greatest Revival since Pentecost amen remember that goodness gracious right and he pastored that church I didn't wasn't plan on saying that that was justu my memory there so we got this we got this blueprint but we got to have wisdom the Jesus also said he said the Pharisees forgot the other things Mercy was one of them that's it mercy and judgment what was the other one he said you you kept these uh uh you kept the minor things you kept all these details of every TI he said but you left off mercy and judgment maybe just mercy and judgment somebody can look that up you look it up might be helpful to us all right so that's why when I look at our church I don't see any problem with the way we're running things because brother Brandon at one point had to have this kind of setup as well with a small church until you get more more labors in the vineyard all right so he said it's not reason it's not acceptable for us but yet it was acceptable for brother Brandon right for his that short time his Myer it's been acceptable for us verse three wherefore Brethren look ye Out Among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business so what is giving food to people in the church it's called a business it's a business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word okay so in the early church they the preachers the apostles really wanted to just give themselves a prayer and preaching prayer and preaching and God honored it praise God now they had the large numbers to it remember 3,000 on the day of pagos 3,000 3,000 in your all the the related churches all right verse 5 so uh the ideal way is for each person to focus on their one Ministry but it's not always ideal right Apostles just want to focus on prayer preaching and now deacons just focus on business focus on the business of the people give them their food now for us brother tells the business now is now we have buildings we have church buildings that's the business of a of Deacon too right Deacon can take care of that truste can take really the trustee takes care of that but the Deacon is brother calls him the policeman of the church but they also they can do the business of the church they can feed the poor all right verse uh five and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stepen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and proris and nikanor and timan and par par and Nicholas a proelite of Antioch verse six whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them so now here we get the example anytime someone's ordained for an office you got to lay hands on them like when we dedicated our church brother Brooks laid hands on me and sent me out to Pastor The church here hallelujah am remember we can take brother Brooks all the way back to brother Brandon right from each one that he heard the word of God from we can take it all the way back brother Rand so uh we can see remember Paul said lay hands not on a man suddenly so brother Brooks had known me since 2001 the end of 2001 and then he ordained me as a pastor in 2006 so he knew me just about five years he knew me there so he didn't do it right away well brother Jesse got saved in a let's make him a pastor tomorrow don't give that guy a chance to preach not yet don't do it suddenly so Stephen must must been known for a while before the before the Holy Ghost fell he must have been seen as a Godly Jewish man and now he's a Godly Holy Ghost F Christian many Wonder many Bible said great Fai full of Faith signs wonders and miracles amongst all the people he had a powerful testimony among the people God had used him to do great things how many want to be used by Goden it's just like Joshua the Bible said there came a day when God magnified Joshua in the sight of the people that's what I want for our church I want God to vindicate person's gifts in our congregation I believe God's done it praise God if he hasn't he's going to do it praise God there's some way God's going to use your gift use something in your life where you just know that was God hallelujah that was God amen amen remember you got different levels of gift you got five gifts four 3 two one you know there's different levels the thing to do is just make yourself available be that glove right be that glove God can stick uh go God can anoint you a poor in his spirit and God can use use that glove Hallelujah to do something for his glory praise God just like Joshua just like the other Apostles just so Stephen gets used by God it's undeniable this is a holy ghost filled man he's full of Faith praise God it's full of power now uh verse seven and the word of God increased now look at that the preachers want to focus on the word so they they anoint men uh to be do the business work and the preachers do their preaching work and God blesses it amen hallelujah that's what God's done with us God blesses our ministry too amen whatever we feel led to do praise God we do it by the grace of the Lord hallelujah uh and the number of disciples multitude and I'm sorry multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and the great company of the priests were obedient to the faith I'm just going to try to finish chapter 6 tonight okay I'm not trying to go to chapter 7 chapter 7 is a beautiful it's not a sermon it's a beautiful testimon of rebuke from stepen uh to the the resists of the Holy Ghost so we never want to resist the Holy Ghost say holy ghost have your full way in my life I don't resist you I accept you Hallelujah I I I let you flow through my life amen let's not resist the Holy Spirit let's let him into our lives praise God more and more so the word of God increases God blesses this setup of order now you got preachers and you got deacons He blesses us but remember there's Deacon requirements years later Paul gives Deacon requirements years later okay let's go read that uh 1 Timothy 3:8 I keep my place 1 Timothy 38 now what's interesting church this thought just come to me too I'm not trying to be you know uh hard to understand anything but but if if if a if a bishop can be a pastor and not be married and have children well then can a deacon be a deacon and not be be married with Children that's interesting if we'll let the preacher do it will we let the deacon do it or do we just favor the preachers you know or favor the deacons you see so just interesting just a thought I never had before now verse eight uh 1 Timothy 38 remember the the pastor is called a bishop Bishop just means overseer Pastor is a pastor is a Shepherd he oversees the flock right so Bishop is another Bible word for pastor verse 8 likewise must the deacons be great not double Tong not given to much wine not guilty of I'm sorry not greedy of filthy lucer why because they're they're feeding the uh feeding the poor they got the money holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience have a pure conscience before the people and let these also first be proved so again you just don't lay hands on suddenly I'm making this brother a deacon tomorrow we just got saved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless so deons do to be blameless just like the bishop must be blameless that was spoken of in verse two now verse 11 now we get to even requirements for a Deacon's wife even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husband of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well that's the same thing a bishop says right but brother Bram was a bishop before he had a wife and children hallelujah it's good to think about isn't it and church you know some of these things have made people upset it's brought in murmurings and disputings what does the Bible say all these things are done to what manifest who's the True Believer Hallelujah that's all these problems are they're just manifesting they're just letting everybody see what seeds inside of you how many got the seed of God tonight amen praise God hallelujah these little disputes and little murmurings and complainings it just now can the Holy Ghost for bu person complain sure but they'll repent of it all right so we can see this here um verse 13 for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus I know message churches you can see them online they'll let the deacons come do the prayer requests you know uh in the song service and they pray bold prayers I like that that reminds me of this right here but not every Deacon has to be exactly you know have as much Faith as everyone else just like every preacher doesn't have to have the same amount of Faith right everybody's got different amounts uh of the Bible said a Measure of Faith a measure of a gift everyone has a different measure right we want we want we want to grow in the full measure that God has given to us that's what we want brother Ram said preachers and deacons are made by the word of God he said all the other offices were made by man the office of a trustee uh the office of a song leader all these other officers they're all made by man brother brother says though the Bible makes preachers and deacons and look God allowed trustees right in brother Ram's church so there's that Liberty again hallelujah how many grateful for Liberties not every church is a cookie cutter church if it would probably an eagle right Eagle cookie Eagle cookie Eagle cookie Eagle cookie not everyone's the exactly the same God loves variety amen right just like some of you rejoice or some of the kids at school rejoice when they saw snow on Tuesday not everybody did not every teacher did some people Rejoice at the rain some people Rejoice at the summer some people Rejoice it's snow God's a god of variety and in the church he allows us varet iety as well he allows even offices made by man you say that's man-made brother Jesse the truste is man-made that's exactly right it is and God allowed it God allows some of our Traditions God allow brother to set up a Christmas tree we talked about that and the church said what's wrong with the tree there's nothing wrong with the tree as long you don't worship it what's wrong with the TV nothing as long as you don't worship it R says what's wrong with the newspaper magazine nothing as long as it doesn't cause you to sin righten he said if you make the T newspaper sin and the TV's a sin and everything's a sin everything's a sin where's the room for Liberty so Church what we need is just Holy Ghost balance praise God and humility we need to be blameless Hallelujah the Sons and Daughters of God amen amen now I'm going to say something here uh in one quote brother brandom says a uh this is interesting I'm not sure how to approaches just the Lord here I'm not sure if I'll bring that one up yet I'll just read the quote and I won't get into the actual real situation I might have mentioned about I'm not sure I would mentioned it yet publicly while we're on live stream I'll tell everybody on Sunday night well two Sunday nights okay I don't want to hide nothing from the church but in this quote um in 1958 brother BR was asked about the placing of deacons that's the sermon the placing of deacons and he says the Bible requires a deacon to be a married man he must be the husband of one wife and the other he's talking about two men that both wanted to be deacons brother Ram accepted one man but he didn't accept the other man now listen why he said uh after investigating the case so see if you want to be office holder Brothers we got to investigate your lives the church said that's why I try to try to investigate uh you know if there's ever a situation you want invest you get all the facts right you would do the same thing right especially when you start having children then you see how you got to investigate things because one of them what usually the younger one will run and say well this person did that and that might be true but what did the younger one do first then he is saying amen and that's just being young right you don't tell the whole part of the story I'll just tell what was done to me I won't say what I done so you got to investigate said you got to investigate each case of a person who wants to hold an office in the church the brother had just recently come into this Faith the message his wife doesn't believe it then that disqualified the man as the office because he must have all his family in subjection they must also be in the faith because it would be a confident see how interesting see how close it is you can be a deacon you can I'm sorry you can be a preacher or Pastor without being married with children but you can't be one if your wife and children are in subjection the word of God isn't that something see how close it is see how close that is and then the Bible doesn't give marriage requirements for the other four gifts of the five full ministry it only gives it for the pastor well that leaves questions now does evangelist teacher Prophet apostle do they have to have wives and children the Bible doesn't tell us so what do we got to do have a lot of love yes and pray amen pray for God's leadership now what I normally do is I just take I take all the other four gifts right back to the pastor I just say well they all we want them to be ideal as the pastor gift okay really thinking tonight AR me good those are all good thoughts so just interesting thought I'd share that with you so you can see sometimes there's questions and we just got to pray and wait on God see how we feel led right we never want to break the word of God but I guess in this case brother brandom and brother Craig and other brothers and and this is what one brother told me one brother said well as long as that Pastor if he's not married with children as long as he wants a wife and children he can be a pastor that's a fine idea but that's not in the Bible right so what am I saying that's your that's your tradition that's your Liberty and God may have had you to do that just like brother brandom had to have had to be all the offices of the church how many glad he was how many glad he didn't quit and go to the Methodist Church how be glad God gave us brandom Tabernacle not so happy about what they do now but I'm glad they started I'm glad God started that church there good look what we got now we have all those sermons all those sermons sort up brother hallelujah praise God it's deep and rich is it tonight deep and Rich all right go back to acts 611 I'm G to try to a place to close in 15 minutes acts six sorry wrong so yeah I was studying I was studying on this other thought I was going to preach on um God saw a man among them to stand the that was I remember I showed you on Sunday Ezekiel 22 I was going to preach on that and show all the men that stood in the Gap but then as I read read this I'm like I think I want to be love to preach that tonight hopefully somebody's being blessed tonight by God's gra and I saw a few hands go up where they learn something so that's a good sign to me praise God that's a good sign okay so U the word of God increased in verse 7 the number of the disciples multiplied greatly and there was a great company that were obedient to the faith that's what we have we have a church that's very obedient to the message what I mean by message the Bible verses God has restored to us verse eight and stepen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of The Libertines and cenans and alexandrians and and of them of CIA or cissa and of Asia disputing with stepen and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake in other words stepen always had the truth I find that to be true in my debate and other things I've done the Holy Ghost always has the right answer amen the word of God cannot be defeated praise God Amen like you're never going to find a verse where a woman cuts her hair and God says that's great or a person's baptized and titles father son holy ghost or God says I am God alone and two other persons alongside of me God don't say that the Bible so what I seen is that the word of God cannot be defeated brother said the word of God will defeat Satan any time any place anywhere hallelujah praise God you cannot defeat the word of God hallelujah so neither could these legalists these Christ deniers these Antichrist men defeat the wisdom by which he spoke oh there's a wisdom gift right there I didn't have that WR down okay Glory I just seen it okay now that's uh six of them right there six out of nine in the first six chapters the church said amen I didn't even s glory to God hallelujah I might be the happiest person here tonight wisdom Stephen spoke with wisdom gory he wasn't a preacher said he was not a preacher Deon St look at that Hallelujah wow six out of nine praise God just the first six chapters verse 11 then they suborn men now that means bribe they bribed men because they couldn't win the argument they couldn't win the debate Stephen wasn't arguing he was just reasoning which is healthy debating they suborn suborned men and said we have heard him speak Blasphemous words against Moses and against God and they stir up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought to the counsel boy lter does a great job on that don't they with Titus of the Cross that's a beautiful that's a beautiful end that's probably the most beautiful ending I've heard to Audio Drama like Stephen I'll just kind of dramatize it real Stephen's talking to his friend and he's he's retelling all these things he saw Jesus did and then the guy comes in and saids the mob's coming after you and you think he got scared he said he said something alongs the line is he said I'm not afraid to be arrested he said I'm willing to die for my Jesus and then they said he said oh they're coming they're coming he said don't you know in five minutes I'll see Jesus Amen in other words today I'll be with him in Paradise hallelujah hallelujah not caring for his life and the history said he was 29 years old s Lena what are you 22 20 sorry I didn't mean to add to your age I should have guessed I should have said 16 Hallelujah 29 he's going I I'll give up everything every all the Earthly world Amen I'll give up everything in this world so that I can gain Christ today I don't care if they Li on me I don't care if they paid them off all I know is I might see Jesus today that's a real Christian right there Hallelujah in the flower of his age we'd say the the the strength the the beauty of his manhood or the strength of his manhood said I'd be happy to die for Jesus today that's real Holy Ghost poweru amen verse 14 for we have heard him say SP we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the custom which Moses delivered to us and all they that sat in the counsil looked steadfastly on him saw his face face as it had been the face of an Angel this scripture reminded me of that song where the B I'm sorry the song says I want to get so close to him so there's no real change I'm sorry so there's no big change on that day when Jesus somay Jesus will call name as days go by I hope I don't stay the same think about Stephen i w to get close that there's CH on that day Jesus look at Stephen the day he dies what does he look like Angel Hallelujah in other words he's turning so much like Christ he's almost like Christ amen he's so much like Jesus they look on him and they see a face like an angel now remember the Angels the Bible said they they made you fearful so he had brother bam said they had such a look they look like they were so Stern and he be think about this he became so much like Christ by being a deacon think about that by being a deacon by serving widows food you become like Christ isn't that beautiful praise God never seen that before amen glory amen give me alls you become so much like Christ you become like an angel to the people Sinners will look at you and think that person is just like Christ they're just like God but Jesse how can I be more like Christ um let's look at the life of Stephen let's start giving people food that need food let's start doing the business of the overlooked let's see who can we find out that might be being overlooked in the church is it the children is it the older Saints in the church is it the moms is it the young young young ones is it the teenagers who's being overlooked and nobody's being overlooked in the church let's look outside of the church prise god let's look at our friends and our family because Stephen became more like Christ through his faith of course signs wonders and miracles but also by ministering to the needs of the the needy the unfortunate the widows that didn't have a husband and there Stephen out there every day here's your breakfast are you hungry again here's your lunch you want some supper here's your supper a man so much like Christ that he's he was almost in that stage like Moses where Moses went the presence of God and he comes out off the mountain and they got to put a they got to put a sheet over his face because it was glowing with the glory of God oh is that I always thought is that possible the New Testament you better believe it's possible you better believe it's possible Hallelujah full of Faith full of the Holy Ghost about the father's business Hallelujah helping those who only have only have their daily meal is that possible in the presence of God in the New Testament absolutely in fact the Bible tells us we should have that put up 2 Corinthians 3:18 the Bible says the more you behold the word of God right Bible said you more the more you listen to the word of God the more you pray at home and also Church the more you're in the presence of God you are changed from one glory to another glory amen hallelujah can you put that up there 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass now that's a mirror the glory of the Lord changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of God so each day Stephen must have been praying you know staying in the word and then serving and each day brother amen he got more and more like an angel until that last day he was just like an angel he was so Stern he was so sincere so pure there's no hypocrisy remember what's the opposite of Purity hypocrisy he had so the Bible calls it addicted he had so addicted himself to the service of the saints that he looked like an angel said it was 6 foot tall 200 stand up buddy what are you 180 it's actually about his size except like 20 more pound so when the actual Angel brother saw look just kind of like him he had black hair but so put 20 more pounds on and brother said he'd see that angel and he would just be frightened and he would wait for that angel brother Billy Paul testimony wherever brother would go the angel only watched brother brandom in the room when Billy Paul was moving around he would just just look at me the whole time he would always turn to look at brother brand that's all he did look at brother brand you can sit down good job give him two claps there so that's about the size of the Angel of the Lord and he said I come from the presence of God hallelujah now that's what we want to do church we want to behold the word of God now you can do that in prayer too I'm just not saying read your Bible yeah we need to read our Bibles more but just like tonight enjoy the word of God say Amen believe the word of God say Lord I want that to be a part of me and you will go from Glory unto Glory now virtue would bring it up why you look so young brother Jesse maybe that's why God's gra I appreciate you say that I hope that happens for a long time but he looked like so so Heavenly he looked like an angel of God remember angels have no blemishes this is what the spirit of God produces Moses the Bible said Moses had skin that was shining like an angel you look at stepen right before he knows he's going to be he knows he's going to be Marty he knows he's going home to see Jesus and he's shining with the glory of God hallelujah he lived so close to God Satan didn't know what to do with him but Satan went before God and God said this time you can take him you can touch his life but what do we know also as soon as he took his life the Angels were there to pack his soul up to Glory Hallelujah praise God and that's something Satan said uh well I bet Stephen just serves him because uh because you're so good to him and you let him do all these Miracles right imagine what Satan was saying you he just serves you if you if you take his life he'll deny you at the last moment and God said go ahead and try I'm bragging on my son he must have had a bragging session he must had a testimony session in heaven Satan have you considered my servant Stephen good he's so much like me he turned it into an angel Hallelujah Glory praise God oh Jes just serves you because of all the blessings and he gets to beat everybody every day and just let me take his life and he'll deny you go ahead take his life take his life but he'll be with me in Paradise that something how we know that your life is in Christ's hands whatever happens he ordained and he knows you're going to overcome the testen said whether you got to go to the grave as a martyr whether you got to get sickness and die or whatever you may go by gunshot car accident brother went by car accident what's the difference between that and cancer or anything else what's the difference you still got to go but said that's God's prerogative for your life that's God's plan and purpose for your life and alls we must do is stay true to Christ and his calling for us amen and live so close to him that you start looking like Malachi but the the Holiness talk about the Hol of an Angel he told brother he said I come from the presence of God imagine that and then he comes down to give brother the Revelation SE glory amen I come from the presence of God to reveal this Bible to you like I challenged that guy was challenging me this morning I challenged him I said show me one thing I preached that was in the Bible and I don't hear back from it because that's what the angel did the angel came to show brother brand the scriptures yes remember the denomination told Brother brandom uh you're hallucinating those are demon showing you those visions and the angel said no brother R said well well then why do I get sick afterwards and the angel said turn to Daniel Daniel saw one Vision he was sick on his head for seven days that's what I love about this mess amen everything brother heard from the angel you can take it back to the Bible Hallelujah thus sa the Bible Hallelujah that's I told those guys they they're criticizing me what I preached to The Junction City Saints I said you show me one thing I preached that was in the Bible and I'll I'll repent and say I'm a I made a mistake they haven't said nothing yet Hallelujah because that's what the message came to do it came to point us back to the scriptures yes amen hallelujah R said Stephen was full of the Holy Ghost and Faith he respected no one he feared no one now that means uh he had no favorites now I know there's another quote where said you got your favorite friends so I'm just just a quote you know just a quote but look and when death was pronounced upon all who would take that name of Christ and walk in the faith of Jesus Christ Stephen took his stand with those who would not turn back that's what this all boils down to are you going to turn back like Lot's wife or are you going to press on towards the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and Satan will stand there at the Throne of God and say well I know brother amen will give up if you say this or I know brother Jesse will give up if you just do this God said go ahead he won't deny me he'll overcome he's a part of that book of Acts Church Hallelujah he and he or she they're trying everything they can do to be a just like the book of Acts Church Hallelujah sometimes you got murmurings disputes sometimes you got problems but the Lord delivers us from them all it's already 8:05 uh let me see had a little bit more left here let me just CL I'll just close with this quote here I want to read this quote um this is from the church book brother R said though Scholars may try to tell you the apostolic age is over don't believe it such a statement is wrong on two accounts now let me just stop right there there's very few Apostles like Simon is starting to get in that if Simon would actually start a church somewhere and set them up he would now be an apostle I think Jason dears might be I think he started a church in Egypt or if I'm not mistaken but if anyone goes to a foreign land and starts a Christian Church sets it up they are now an apostle okay brother says but we don't have a lot right because a lot of message well the world's been preached a lot the fields have been sewed right harvested but people could still do it like Simon and Ron feel led to do it next month um brother said now they're called missionaries not Apostles the second proof is that um they refer to the age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed but that's untrue and then he quotes Acts 238 and 39 you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you your children to all them that are far off amen even as many as the Lord Our God shall call brother said if they're still calling the apostolic age is still on Hallelujah that's a simple way brother R proves it brother R says until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease Hallelujah it will not cease there will always be that power Hallelujah and the Pentecost message what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost let's stop right there so let's stand our feet Malachi can come by God's grace I want to end with that because I want to remind everybody that this Apostolic age has not ceased Hallelujah the Bible said ordain Elders in every city that's what happened to me brother Brooks ordained me the Elder in AC I'm the only ordained Elder of the book of Acts Church in Aran as far as I know Hallelujah there's another message church here let me know we either join up with them or they can join us or we can be separate if we have to but that's the apostolic pattern ordain Elder and I didn't ask to come here God sent me here hallelujah just like Joseph Joseph didn't ask to go to Egypt God sent him there right find like find yourself in the word of God hallelujah and this Apostolic age has not ceased and I want to end with that thought everything in the book of Acts is your right now what is a right it's something that you can do right we have the right to bear arms you can do that if you want right Mal that's your right you can do it so what does that mean for us if it's in the book of Acts we can do it Hallelujah and then it boils down to what does God want done that's finding the perfect will of God hallelujah what does God want done in acurate that's what I want to know praise God I see what he's done in 17 years I want to know Lord what do you want to do for 2024 let's play that song you got a song in your heart keep your mind me just I guess I've been thinking a lot about 2024 lately you know Monday night I was just at the house I just I'm going to have a little prayer meeting I just had a little prayer meeting with God I was just praying about 2024 just kind of Hit me hard over the weekend you know with Thanksgiving I had a little more time to watch some more political videos and they started talking about you know here's 2020 could repeat I thought Lord I just want to have a little time to talk it over with the Lord by God's grace I just said Lord Whatever May Come Lord just make me ready by God's grace make me ready no matter what test might come help me to stand withstand the test and help me to overcome the test praise but I also pray God show us Mercy show us mercy and that tied into the thought I almost preached tonight God was seeking a man who would pray for the land
