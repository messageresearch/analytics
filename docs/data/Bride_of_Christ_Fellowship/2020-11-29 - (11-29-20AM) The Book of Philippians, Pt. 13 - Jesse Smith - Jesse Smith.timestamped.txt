[13:18] like every seven years I'm gonna try to
[13:20] I'm gonna try to change that though I'm
[13:21] G try to change that but since we
[13:22] haven't seen him in seven years I was
[13:24] looking it was 2013 was the last time he
[13:26] was here and that's way too long now the
[13:28] reason I didn't invite was because he
[13:29] was pastor but now he's not Pastor
[13:31] anymore he's back to just
[13:33] evangelism so um since we haven't seen
[13:37] him in seven years I'm gonna have three
[13:39] services this weekend so you could call
[13:40] it like a Revival weekend by God's grace
[13:43] it's going to be wonderful if you
[13:44] haven't heard him you're really going to
[13:46] be blessed he's a real man of God
[13:47] brother
[13:48] McBride Saturday at 6 and Sunday 11 and

[13:54] brother amen is on third shift and so
[13:58] he's not here this morning he'll be here
[13:59] this evening and it's only for a month
[14:02] so this will only affect I think Naomi
[14:04] and beatric and then my family for
[14:06] Wednesday nights we're going to try to
[14:08] do Wednesday night at 6:30 half hour
[14:11] earlier because amen has to leave by 8
[14:13] o'clock or else he's going to be late
[14:14] for work uh normally I'll preach till
[14:17] like you know 8:45 or something like
[14:19] that so I gotta really watch myself uh
[14:23] hopefully am man can give me like a wave
[14:25] you know on Wednesday night
[14:26] like gotta go brother and if we're just
[14:30] all enjoying it we'll say love you buddy
[14:31] you know we're just going to keep

[14:37] not then we'll have to go to Six the
[14:38] following week um I I'll tell amen we
[14:41] can just do like three songs you know on
[14:43] Wednesday night just to kind of make
[14:44] sure we redeem the time uh and uh so we
[14:48] were so happy to have him I think we had
[14:50] van here on Wednesday night as well
[14:51] right I think he's going to be with us
[14:53] for a few Wednesday nights as well so
[14:55] that's really special uh very special
[14:59] so just two announcements there brother
[15:01] McBride next week and then uh Wednesday
[15:03] early we'll try
[15:05] 6:30 by God's
[15:08] grace okay so some prayer requests Jose
[15:10] sick um so let's remember him he said
[15:12] he's very sick I prayed for him
[15:14] yesterday but he text this morning let's
[15:16] remember him in prayer as well he's
[15:18] still sick also that little two-year-old
[15:20] David deweer please keep praying for him
[15:22] he got better Wednesday after you know I
[15:25] think we prayed everybody was praying
[15:26] but then he the infection set back in on
[15:29] Thursday and so I think he's still in
[15:30] intensive care let's remember him and
[15:32] remember he was the one spared from
[15:34] abortion the doctors told his mother and
[15:35] father he's going to be a vegetable
[15:37] don't even have him they named him David
[15:39] because he was goingon to defeat Goliath
[15:42] uh and he he's a healthy boy can't talk
[15:44] can't walk yet um he's delayed but uh
[15:48] Satan's really fighting him so let's
[15:49] remember Little David deweer in
[15:52] prayer also Lydia had unspoken need I
[15:55] appreciate that darling and uh and
[15:57] there's a brother overse amilio he's
[16:00] translating all my YouTube videos into
[16:02] Spanish but his granddaughter is sick
[16:04] with fever and sore throat today and he
[16:07] asked for our prayers I said surely
[16:09] we'll pray for her name is Sharon Rose
[16:11] what a pretty name there very close
[16:14] closely associated with the message so
[16:16] let's remember uh him in prayer and his
[16:19] granddaughter are there any other needs
[16:20] this morning does anybody have any needs
[16:22] on their heart they like to be
[16:24] remembered okay let's remember uh
[16:26] Naomi's family in prayer as they leave
[16:28] on December December 7th Let's uh come
[16:31] against covid in Jesus name and pray for
[16:35] accurate test results let's pray for
[16:37] that that the will of God would be done
[16:40] you know Church how many times do people
[16:41] say keep this in prayer and yet we we
[16:43] pray for it one time maybe
[16:45] two it's hard to keep something in
[16:47] prayer unless it's directly affecting
[16:49] you that's why I wrote this down when
[16:51] Naomi said can you keep that in prayer
[16:52] and bang said can you pray for me I just
[16:55] I want to keep this in prayer I want to
[16:56] keep it every day just keep praying for
[16:58] these things uh I want to keep these in
[17:01] prayer so uh it's a lot easier said than
[17:04] done and the church said it's easy to
[17:07] say oh yeah I'll keep it in prayer but
[17:09] it's harder to keep it in prayer yes is
[17:12] TW oh yes yes
[17:16] yes
[17:17] okay yes yes Jackie let's remember
[17:20] Jackie in prayer for his job situation
[17:22] needs a a job by next
[17:24] month oh next week right December
[17:30] okay certainly we'll definitely pray for
[17:36] Jackie
[17:38] Hallelujah yeah I think we prayed for I
[17:40] don't know if you when you you were here
[17:41] but we prayed for Jose's family for jobs
[17:44] they lost their jobs because of covid
[17:45] and we prayed and then we prayed for
[17:47] them and then Jose said no God answered
[17:48] they just got a job so God gave them
[17:51] jobs I think just a couple weeks ago so
[17:53] just an encouragement you know as we
[17:54] pray God is merciful and faithful why
[17:57] don't we stand here and uh because we'll
[17:59] have a couple more songs of course as we
[18:01] normally do but let's remember these

[32:09] two 3 rejoice in the lord always and
[32:13] again I say rejoice may God add His
[32:15] blessings to the reading of his word you
[32:17] may be seated praise
[32:25] God so let's take a little bit and we'll
[32:27] preach here on these thoughts by God's
[32:30] grace
[32:36] um just to follow up on a few things um
[32:40] I've been trying to get in touch with
[32:41] the brother Stanley oops sorry um
[32:46] brother Stanley he watched our YouTube
[32:47] video on baptism and he got baptized at
[32:49] Cam's Church a couple weeks ago um I've
[32:51] been trying to reach out to him but he
[32:52] hasn't returned my calls he's just
[32:54] texted me and said he's real busy I
[32:55] invited him to our church but he said
[32:57] he's for a church that's closer uh down
[33:00] in nework it's about an hour and 45
[33:02] minutes south of here it's almost
[33:04] directly south of aan so anyways just
[33:06] want to give you an up update on that
[33:08] we're happy he was baptized Cam and
[33:10] Simon really enjoyed fellowshipping with
[33:12] him uh but hopefully he finds a good
[33:14] home church that's our prayer so let's
[33:16] just remember him in prayer uh if you do
[33:19] uh and also uh yesterday I recorded the
[33:22] next video I'm I'm making a video about
[33:24] Joseph Brandon is he a prophet so I'm
[33:27] going to share it with him Billy Paul
[33:28] first before it goes public I just want
[33:30] to give those Brothers another chance uh
[33:33] to uh to receive correction from uh
[33:36] their dad's message by God's grace so uh
[33:39] we working on that we'll hopefully get
[33:40] that up this week uh by the grace of the
[33:44] Lord uh so I think that's about it uh I
[33:47] just want to update you on that okay so
[33:49] I have some quotes here and some slides
[33:51] so let's move over there by God's
[33:56] grace so we're looking at uh verses 1 to
[33:59] three we'll start with this and the
[34:01] theme of the first nine verses though is
[34:03] the God of Peace uh remember this is the
[34:06] book uh Philippians is known by
[34:08] theologians as the book of
[34:11] Joy because Paul keeps saying Rejoice
[34:13] Rejoice
[34:15] rejoice and uh it's known as the book of
[34:17] joy and yet it's such a paradox because
[34:20] you know from chapter one if you
[34:21] remember Paul was in prison but even
[34:24] while in prison he found reason to give
[34:27] God praise
[34:29] that all those that are around me got to
[34:30] hear the message praise God and that
[34:33] that's that's what I hope our lives are
[34:34] as well wouldn't you say Amen to that
[34:36] that no matter what situation I'm in no
[34:39] matter where I'm at people are going to
[34:40] hear the message which is basically
[34:42] Jesus Christ right Hebrews 138 Jesus is
[34:45] still alive he's in the saving business
[34:47] he's in the sanctifying business he's in
[34:49] the filling business praise God Amen and
[34:53] so Paul was able to Rejoice uh that at
[34:56] least people were hearing the message of
[34:58] the hour and that's what we do as well
[35:00] we rejoice in that when uh people can
[35:02] hear the word of
[35:04] God so uh these first these first nine
[35:08] verses are on peace now remember chapter
[35:10] one he was he Paul was rejoicing and let
[35:13] me just go over Scofield's division
[35:15] scoffield divides this book really by
[35:17] its four chapters so he has four
[35:19] divisions and uh scoffield says the
[35:21] first division is Christ is the
[35:23] believer's pattern rejoicing in uh
[35:28] suffering all right so Paul's in prison
[35:30] he's suffering remember he was rejoicing
[35:33] even uh he was rejoicing even when
[35:35] people were preaching Christ the wrong
[35:37] way Paul was still rejoicing in it so
[35:40] I'll say like this I'll Rejoice uh if
[35:42] the believe the sign uh hope they're
[35:44] watching I'll Rejoice even if they stay
[35:46] against us I'll still Rejoice because at
[35:48] least they're mentioning
[35:49] Christ right I'll Rejoice uh no matter
[35:52] as long as Jesus is being preached I'll
[35:54] rejoice in that because there's a
[35:57] possibility somebody sitting there like
[35:59] Jose remember Jose his testimony
[36:01] remember he was he sat in the message
[36:03] church that was a return Ministry for
[36:06] years and years and he always believed
[36:08] brother Bram was going to raise from the
[36:09] dead and come back until he came to this
[36:11] church and the Holy Spirit corrected him
[36:14] in this church praise God so see he sat
[36:16] around he knew something true about it
[36:19] right he the vision of the cloud before
[36:20] he even knew about the cloud brother
[36:22] Jose God blessed him today with healing
[36:24] by God's grace but he sat around here
[36:26] long enough until he came to our church
[36:28] and God gave the rightly divided word to
[36:31] him and it set him free from the false
[36:33] Doctrine praise God Amen so we rejoice
[36:36] as long as Jesus is being preached
[36:38] There's an opportunity for Christ to
[36:40] pull and send his true seed to those
[36:43] hungry hearts and to be able to pull
[36:44] them out because he said come out of her
[36:46] my people praise God Amen remember Jesus
[36:50] is still being named in the Catholic
[36:51] church this morning is he not they're
[36:53] saying father son Holy Ghost they're
[36:56] they they preach on Jesus Jesus right
[36:59] they preach on Jesus and so uh at least
[37:02] he's being named there uh but he's not
[37:04] the highest name now Mary's the highest
[37:06] name now the Trinity three person is the
[37:09] highest name but Jesus should be the
[37:11] highest name amen and if somebody really
[37:13] loves God there they're going to cling
[37:15] to that name of Jesus and Jesus is going
[37:17] to call them out amen just like he
[37:20] called you out of your denomination or
[37:23] Creed praise God so we rejoice in that
[37:26] that the God of Peace
[37:28] uh is able to re we're able to to give
[37:30] us peace and help us rejoice even when
[37:32] we suffer or even when people fall away
[37:35] from the message you know I got
[37:37] criticized yesterday uh oh what about
[37:40] all the people that left your church
[37:41] brother Jesse that must mean that that
[37:42] you're
[37:43] wrong that don't bother me 70 preachers
[37:46] left Jesus that don't bother me I'll say
[37:48] like this 70 Miracle working preachers
[37:51] left Jesus now people that left me I
[37:53] haven't seen many miracles in their
[37:55] lives right and just because somebody
[37:58] leaves you doesn't mean you're wrong if
[38:00] that's true then Jesus was wrong but he
[38:02] wasn't wrong he was right what it is is
[38:05] God like getting separated and just so
[38:07] you know brother Stephen I was calling
[38:08] out for your brother's name this morning
[38:10] in prayer right this morning and sister
[38:12] who I was calling out your sister's
[38:13] names and your brother's names in prayer
[38:15] this morning on my face praise God
[38:17] because I believe in praying for them to
[38:19] come back and I'll keep I don't care how
[38:21] many years go by I'm going to keep
[38:22] calling out their names amen because I
[38:25] believe in that I believe God is a god
[38:27] of restoration praise God
[38:29] Amen in fact I was talking to a brother
[38:32] a pastor from Connecticut last night and
[38:35] he said he was raised message but left
[38:37] it when he was 17 and he was out of the
[38:39] message for 16
[38:42] years isn't it left it for 16 years and
[38:46] finally the Lord brought him back
[38:47] through just reading the Bible he had so
[38:49] much brother BR brother BR he just fell
[38:51] away because the the emphasis wasn't on
[38:54] Jesus but the holy spirit said read your
[38:56] Bible you read the the Bible for six
[38:58] months he said after that the holy
[38:59] spirit said now listen to the tapes and
[39:02] he said he he and his testimony was this
[39:04] he's been pastoring now 30 years so he
[39:06] must be in his 50s he said he always had
[39:08] a limp and his brother made fun of him
[39:10] he had a limp he couldn't walk and he
[39:11] said while listening to brother B's tape
[39:14] he was listening to a prayer line and
[39:16] brother and brother said oh the
[39:17] anointing is like a cloud in here he
[39:19] said the faith is so strong and the
[39:21] brother said he was praying and said
[39:22] Lord he said I wish I was there I would
[39:26] love to be in that kind of faith and the
[39:28] brother's testimony is that brother Ram
[39:30] said young man as you're sitting there
[39:32] he said receive your healing of your
[39:35] walking problem in the name of Jesus
[39:37] Christ and the brother said I talked to
[39:38] him last night he said the Holy Spirit
[39:40] knocked him off his chair and when he
[39:42] got up from the chair he was walking and
[39:44] he's completely whole amen and the
[39:48] brother said he shared that testimony
[39:49] with a brother who left the message and
[39:51] he said a pastor left a message from
[39:53] Lima and the brother said how can I
[39:55] leave the message when that's happen
[39:57] happened to me and the Pastor said you
[40:00] shouldn't because it's so real praise
[40:03] God so see that means those people that
[40:05] have left haven't had a real experience
[40:08] because they haven't sought god with the
[40:09] right kind of Faith praise God amen
[40:12] hallelujah amen see I listen to brother
[40:16] as you know and I went and preach what
[40:17] he said and God has done what brother
[40:20] Bram said but I heard brother ra say
[40:22] I've cast out Devils I prayed for the
[40:25] sick they've been healed I've seen
[40:26] miracles why because I took God's
[40:28] prophet and I took it back to the word
[40:30] and Jesus proved it was right how can I
[40:32] ever leave I can't because this is God's
[40:35] message amen and I don't want to praise
[40:38] God I want to stay right here praise God
[40:40] where we got the liberty of the Holy
[40:42] Spirit praise God and we got thus sayith
[40:44] the Lord I'm happy to do it so I'm send
[40:46] that brother my copy my book tomorrow
[40:48] he's also wrote some good articles on
[40:50] the cloud and I can't wait to get them
[40:52] so I'm looking forward to that but see
[40:56] despite suffering
[40:58] we must have
[40:59] joy the second theme is in Chapter 2 is
[41:03] the Bel Christ is our pattern and he
[41:07] rejoiced in lowly service Jesus had to
[41:10] condescend remember he had to take the
[41:12] form of a servant in able in order to do
[41:15] the will of God Church you and I will
[41:17] only do God's will when we humble
[41:19] ourselves and find our service that we
[41:21] can do for
[41:23] God not a can I say like this not a
[41:26] leoty and
[41:27] selfservice but a service to other
[41:31] people I was battl and discouraged
[41:33] recently you know I put about 50 hours
[41:35] in one of my last YouTube videos and
[41:37] only you know I'll say like this maybe
[41:38] only 200 people watched and I was
[41:40] getting a little
[41:42] discouraged I mean I put hours and hours
[41:44] into these things but I've got to
[41:46] remember that that uh the Bible says we
[41:49] must give honor to those who labor in
[41:51] Doctrine praise God and I've got to
[41:53] encourage myself by you know God if if
[41:56] the word that of truth that in there God
[41:58] is going to direct it to the hearts of
[42:00] those who really want to hear it praise
[42:01] God Amen and that brother Stanley's a
[42:03] good example that I made that video
[42:04] seven years ago the water baptism he
[42:06] heard it in 2020 s years later and was
[42:09] baptized in Jesus Christ name amen
[42:12] praise God Amen I don't know I it's just
[42:14] a time and season right we must wait
[42:16] upon God's time and season but the thing
[42:18] to do is serve people now praise God and
[42:22] be not weary in well-doing
[42:26] amen because God is Not forgetful of
[42:29] your labor of love praise God Amen in
[42:31] other words keep sharing those videos
[42:33] keep sharing those testimonies keep
[42:34] passing out books keep passing out
[42:36] Church age books keep passing out my
[42:38] book just keep doing something and God
[42:40] sees your efforts and God will reward us
[42:42] in new
[42:44] season but that was Jesus in Philippians
[42:47] 2 he had to condescend and take he left
[42:49] his glory and his theophany we'd say and
[42:52] he came down and the Word was made flesh
[42:55] and he became a man and humbled himself
[42:58] so we must ask God today Lord help me
[43:00] remember help me to humble myself so I
[43:02] can serve your
[43:04] people that's going to come in handy I
[43:06] shouldn't say handy that's going to come
[43:07] in uh uh needful as we look at chapter
[43:09] four in a moment now the third theme is
[43:12] in the third chapter Christ is our
[43:15] object uh rejoicing despite
[43:18] imperfections and remember the
[43:19] imperfections were the false doctrines
[43:21] we preached on in Chapter 3 The
[43:24] judaizers you know Paul called them dogs
[43:27] and uh the the legalism remember we
[43:30] preach on we went through all the
[43:31] message legalisms right we went through
[43:32] that short sleeves and uh no beards for
[43:36] preachers and wearing Peak behind the
[43:38] pulpit which uh none of these you find
[43:40] in the Bible no I don't wear pink behind
[43:42] the pulpit but some people might we all
[43:44] got our convictions praise God but
[43:47] making the making the gospel legalism
[43:50] rather than Freedom praise God freedom
[43:52] to obey the word of God and then uh now
[43:56] chapter four The theme Here is Christ is
[43:59] our strength as we Rejoice over
[44:03] anxiety
[44:05] stress does everybody know about
[44:08] stress anybody felt any stress
[44:12] lately that that's what chapter 4 is all
[44:14] about how do I overcome anxiety and I
[44:18] can say like this like a mental
[44:21] breakdown I've never had one but I've
[44:23] known numerous preachers that have
[44:25] because the stress gets them usually
[44:26] it's stress in the church like politics
[44:29] that that's what I've seen with my
[44:30] closest friends because of politics in
[44:33] the church they're afraid if I make this
[44:35] decision the the tithe payers and the
[44:37] the rich people they're going to get me
[44:39] here they're gonna come against me
[44:41] that's what I've seen in message
[44:42] churches that's when people have
[44:43] breakdowns oh you're going against
[44:44] established elders and they can vote me
[44:46] out I mean you'd have a breakdown too
[44:48] right if if your income was tied to uh a
[44:54] church and if you make a decision
[44:55] against a church they're going to cut
[44:57] off your income where's my family going
[44:58] to go that's a lot of
[45:00] pressure but the other side is Jesus is
[45:03] going to take care of me if I stand on
[45:05] his word and that and we all we all need
[45:07] help with that right I I'm not
[45:09] criticizing anybody who's had a mental
[45:10] breakdown uh as I found as I was talking
[45:12] to the brother yesterday it seems like
[45:14] Satan attacks men especially preachers
[45:16] as they get a little older like David
[45:19] Fell in his 50s to bash Sheba look at
[45:22] our precious brother Tim Humes uh look
[45:24] at the ones who've had different mind
[45:26] battles uh Ed bcll Perry green Donnie
[45:29] Reagan uh he had a real battle a couple
[45:32] years ago with the interracial marriage
[45:33] thing I mean think about like so it
[45:35] seems like mine's coming
[45:37] up I'm 40 now right almost
[45:43] 50 but what what I'm saying is what I'm
[45:46] saying is that uh these great battles
[45:49] are to come and we got to be fortified
[45:51] we got to be strengthened now praise God
[45:54] we can't let down the shield of
[45:56] Revelation now you got to get fresh
[45:58] Revelation and hold up the shield of
[46:00] Faith against every fiery
[46:03] Dart because if you get older you get
[46:05] tired right and you kind of get in your
[46:07] ways and you let we can't let
[46:10] down uh we can't let down the shield the
[46:12] revelation we got to keep praying and
[46:14] God give me fresh Revelation to overcome
[46:17] the recent darts
[46:19] right because we're going to get darts
[46:21] shot at us right how many know Satan
[46:23] leaves for a season right that means
[46:25] maybe the darts aren't as big right but
[46:27] when Satan comes back brother sister you
[46:28] know those darts are going to be
[46:30] ferocious and look at what these
[46:32] brothers have been through Tim and uh
[46:34] you know Ed and and Donnie uh Tim pu you
[46:37] know look at all the darts that the the
[46:39] huge darts that's been fired against him
[46:41] in church you're you're not exempt
[46:43] either that's right I'm just talking
[46:44] about preachers right now you're Dart
[46:47] fired at you right fiery big fiery Dart
[46:51] and you got to have the revelation of
[46:52] God to raise up at that time and
[46:55] extinguish it praise God
[46:58] amen so it doesn't burn you you can't
[47:00] get burned by Satan's Temptation you got
[47:03] to put out the fire praise God Amen you
[47:07] can't let yourself get burned up with
[47:08] can I say it like this burned up with
[47:10] greed or burned up with competition
[47:13] against that brother or burned up with
[47:16] lust right or burned up with insincerity
[47:19] or anger or bitterness we can't get
[47:22] burned up by that we got to be burn I
[47:24] sure will i' like to talk to him about
[47:26] that what major darts has Satan fired
[47:29] him as you get older because remember
[47:31] Solomon failed he should have just had
[47:32] that one sweet wife right the shulamite
[47:36] but instead he married woman after woman
[47:38] after woman and the Bible said they
[47:40] turned his heart in his old age see so
[47:43] as we get older we got to make sure we
[47:45] keep up our guard keep seeking
[47:48] God so we don't get hit by a dart that
[47:51] Mars Our Testimony now do I believe
[47:54] those brothers were saved absolutely
[47:55] many of them probably have the Holy
[47:57] Ghost I'm not the judge of that but the
[48:00] fact is church a dart's coming amen and
[48:03] we've got to overcome how I get on this
[48:05] we got to overcome anxiety and stress
[48:07] praise God because it's coming praise
[48:10] the Lord there's going to be stress
[48:12] that'll come right to you and you got to
[48:14] either take a stand on the word and hold
[48:16] up your Shield or you're gonna fight
[48:18] back with your human mind and your human
[48:21] understanding and your own emotions and
[48:23] feelings rather than thus say the
[48:25] Lord that's where we've seen some
[48:27] ministers fall I'm not saying which ones
[48:29] but when they try to use human reasoning
[48:31] and they're emotional uh and they try to
[48:33] figure it out themselves you can't lean
[48:35] on your own understanding church we must
[48:37] lean upon the word of
[48:43] God boy and get to my first slide Church
[48:47] everybody's pulling this morning well
[48:49] God bless you for
[48:50] that now verse one I just want this is I
[48:52] didn't cover this really heavily Paul
[48:54] said Stand Fast in the Lord so Paul
[48:57] entreats his beloved now I'm still going
[48:59] to maintain this when I preach it God
[49:01] has favorites I'm still going to
[49:03] maintain that because that word dearly
[49:05] beloved means his favorites Church you
[49:08] are God's favorite not by your not by
[49:11] your choice but by for knowledge amen
[49:14] I'm sorry let me say like not by your
[49:15] works but by God's foreign knowledge
[49:18] that you would love his word amen and
[49:21] you would love it more than the foolish
[49:23] virgin you'd love it more uh than the
[49:26] workers of iniquity you love it more
[49:28] than sinner you would love it with all
[49:29] your heart soul mind and strength that's
[49:31] why you're God's favorite because you're
[49:33] his bride it's
[49:36] relational I love my wife more than
[49:39] anybody else here sorry sisters she's my
[49:42] favorite because of relationship praise
[49:45] God Amen nothing against you
[49:49] sisters she's my
[49:51] favorite that that's all Paul is saying
[49:53] you are God's favorite you're God's
[49:55] choice to be right because the others
[49:57] were disqualified because they didn't
[49:59] love God but because you love God you're
[50:02] his favorite praise God because you love
[50:04] all the word because you love the word
[50:06] of the hour the restoration that Joel
[50:09] spoke of Hallelujah the finished mystery
[50:12] that John spoke of you love it that
[50:14] makes God that makes you God's
[50:17] favorite I still maintain that that it's
[50:19] yours favorite by his for
[50:25] knowledge so Paul says to his favorites
[50:28] now listen see people are that you
[50:31] should Joy most in
[50:33] people that's why I'm sad when I don't
[50:35] see Saints or they're discouraged
[50:37] because the Saints are my
[50:39] joy right you are my joy the ones I'm
[50:42] preaching the ones I'm feeding you're my
[50:44] joy and the ones that God's used me to
[50:46] save they're my
[50:48] crown right brother R said he said be a
[50:51] crown he said in the jewel of Jesus
[50:53] Christ right and then Paul says Paul
[50:56] tells the Thessalonians you are my
[51:00] crown so see every soul you win is a
[51:03] jewel in your crown it's a testimony so
[51:07] I have a crown but then I'm a jewel in
[51:09] Simon's Crown praise God because I
[51:13] learned from him right he save he saved
[51:15] me through the message there I'm I'm a
[51:17] jewel in his crown and so we all have
[51:20] our crowns we all got Jewels but one day
[51:23] Church we're going to throw those crowns
[51:25] at the feet of Jesus Amen
[51:27] because he's the worthy one of all of
[51:28] our crowns we wouldn't have a crown
[51:30] unless he was crowned with thorns amen
[51:33] and now he's crowned with with power and
[51:35] glory and strength and dominion and
[51:37] might forever and ever as king of kings
[51:39] and Lord of
[51:43] lords so Paul says Stand Fast in other
[51:46] words don't
[51:48] retreat and I'm glad I haven't retreated
[51:50] from believe the sign although I love
[51:51] them I know they're watching they're
[51:52] watching every every sermon
[51:54] now I I'm not going to Retreat I know
[51:57] this word's right
[51:58] Brothers he said Stand Fast like a Roman
[52:01] soldier remember if they left their Duty
[52:03] they die if a if a prisoner got released
[52:07] under their watch they
[52:09] died and history says they never
[52:12] retreated uh even though they knew their
[52:15] commanders could have them killed at any
[52:17] time remember Rome Rome was a dog eat
[52:20] dog Society it was it was the men all
[52:23] the men had the power women and children
[52:24] were just dirt bags really
[52:27] and a father could have his wife killed
[52:30] children he could sell them off into
[52:31] slavery they had all the power so did
[52:33] the soldiers the Roman soldiers they
[52:35] even the commanders could have any one
[52:37] of their soldiers killed but Paul said
[52:40] Stand Fast he said don't don't care so
[52:43] much don't don't be fearful be strong
[52:45] stand at your post
[52:48] of like solder like a fully armed
[52:52] Soldier stand there don't retreat don't
[52:54] be afraid I'm with you the Lord
[52:58] says how many are glad the Lord's with
[53:00] you how many have seen that he's with
[53:03] praise
[53:05] God he said just stand there like a
[53:08] soldier now he gets into this I'm just
[53:10] going to
[53:11] briefly Paul begs here now the word
[53:14] beseech means beg look at beg Paul's
[53:17] requesting entreating begging Paul Paul
[53:21] begs two of the women in the church to
[53:24] get God's mind about a particular
[53:27] situation which he doesn't tell us in
[53:30] other words these two women had their
[53:32] own thinking on a topic and Paul said
[53:34] can you drop your thoughts on this topic
[53:36] and can you get the Lord's thoughts on
[53:39] this and I said there could you imagine
[53:42] you're called out by name by God's
[53:43] prophet and the purpose is you're
[53:45] selfish minded now no offense because
[53:48] we're all no offense to these sisters
[53:49] but we're all selfish at times right I
[53:51] appreciate some of the amens on that one
[53:53] we're all selfish at times see Paul
[53:56] tried to mediate between them and the
[54:00] word uh means interests they had
[54:02] different interests so one sister was
[54:04] interested in doing her thing and the
[54:06] other sister wanted to do her thing a
[54:07] different way and Paul said you got to
[54:09] do God's thing what is God interested in
[54:12] doing this situation and he says I'm
[54:14] begging you sisters so see church if I
[54:17] ever beg if I ever beg or plead with
[54:19] people brother Jesse why don't you
[54:21] rebuke them well sometimes they need a
[54:22] rebuke sometimes they need to
[54:24] beg right you get somebody rebuking
[54:27] somebody all the time they're not going
[54:28] to want to be around you very much right
[54:31] all they do is
[54:33] rebuke Paul has to beg them sisters can
[54:36] you please think the same way can you be
[54:38] interested in the
[54:40] gospel instead of your own
[54:44] interest see they were in their carnal
[54:47] minds and brother M says oh and brother
[54:49] uh Nathaniel preached it really good
[54:51] didn't
[54:51] he he said uh contention only comes by
[54:55] Pride
[54:57] Satan I will I will I will I'll do this
[55:00] right so these sisters are saying I will
[55:02] I will instead of the Lord wants me to
[55:06] Pride and so he calls out these two
[55:08] sisters by name udias and cyi sisters
[55:11] can you drop your pride and can we all
[55:13] think on the same
[55:16] thing a man in prison pleading with
[55:19] three sisters can you please stop these
[55:23] fussing please he's in prison
[55:28] right and he why why didn't he write
[55:31] what you need to pray for more miracles
[55:33] and to shake down the prison again and
[55:34] have another Revival because remember
[55:35] that's what happened in
[55:37] Philippi he wasn't he wasn't praying for
[55:40] that he was praying for the unity of the
[55:42] church right and that's what we want
[55:44] here we want to be unified in the same
[55:46] mind the same interest in the Lord
[55:49] praise God we don't want to fight
[55:51] against one another we want to be United
[55:53] with one
[55:54] another and have the same
[55:58] interests see I'm interested in getting
[56:00] the message
[56:01] out I am not I've seen too many I know
[56:04] sister Wendy has to and beatric and
[56:06] different ones that have been around to
[56:07] different churches I'm not interested in
[56:09] just taking care of just making sure I
[56:11] mean I want to I want to take care of
[56:13] you but I'm not interested in just like
[56:14] focusing on us and not trying to send
[56:17] out missionary workers praise God or
[56:19] doing a part to try to in other words I
[56:22] want to give somebody else a chance to
[56:23] hear the message because this has done
[56:26] tremendous things for me this has
[56:28] transformed my life and I want other
[56:31] people's lives to be
[56:33] transformed the words I don't want to
[56:34] denominate and forget about everybody
[56:36] else I want to give them a chance to
[56:39] receive what I've received I want them
[56:41] to take a drink of this living water
[56:42] praise God because if you drink from it
[56:45] you'll never thirst again praise God
[56:47] your life will be
[56:49] changed but I know a lot of mess
[56:51] churches that that's what the brother
[56:52] was saying last night the 30 uh 30-year
[56:55] Pastor brother he's saying that's what
[56:57] he he said he started seven churches out
[57:00] near Connecticut because his church got
[57:02] too big now can you imagine this your
[57:04] church get so big instead of doing a
[57:05] building project you say brother you're
[57:07] a preacher you go start a church a
[57:09] couple cities
[57:11] down instead of saying you stay with
[57:14] me brother sister seven churches have
[57:17] come out of this one
[57:19] brother that's powerful to me that is so
[57:23] unselfish that's not his interest that's
[57:26] the mind of the
[57:28] spirit his interest is help me to get
[57:30] all the ties I can get and build a big
[57:32] church and try to just be the biggest
[57:34] message preacher I can be I told him I
[57:36] said brother that's really Apostolic I
[57:38] said that's the book of Acts amen praise
[57:42] God seven churches and brother Craig
[57:44] Pastor one of them now brother Craig
[57:46] does he took over one of those
[57:49] churches I like that what we need is the
[57:52] mind of the Lord praise God what we need
[57:55] is to be interested in what Jesus wants
[57:57] and not what we want remember brother
[58:00] Simon said last week he said brother he
[58:02] said remember he told the church people
[58:04] come into Cam's church and they
[58:05] criticize me because how small Church
[58:07] our church is remember brother Simon
[58:09] shared that last week he said all these
[58:10] preachers come and they say well Jesse's
[58:12] got such a small church he must be off
[58:14] the word so I told Simon the testimony
[58:16] about Ray Hernandez he came and told me
[58:19] thus sayith the Lord God gave me a word
[58:20] of the Lord for you why you're such a
[58:22] small church I said okay what is it
[58:25] right remember that I wonder too I would
[58:28] wonder right wouldn't you wonder things
[58:31] should grow right things more people it
[58:32] should attract more people but the word
[58:35] of the Lord is I'm trying to protect you
[58:37] from getting hurt praise God and I'm
[58:40] trying to protect you amen I'm going to
[58:42] put a hedge around you so you don't get
[58:44] hurt by the devil that you can serve me
[58:46] in your protective state in your garden
[58:49] praise God
[58:51] Amen and I told to Simon he's like wow
[58:53] brother I never heard of that and
[58:55] because of that I got 70 seven videos
[58:57] about the message I put out a book uh I
[59:00] think over 300 400 copies have been uh
[59:02] made because of that uh sent around
[59:06] around the world and because of that
[59:08] because we're in our protection we
[59:10] instead of fighting can I say this
[59:12] instead of fighting Saul like David and
[59:14] Saul instead of fighting one another we
[59:16] can fight off the enemy praise God and
[59:18] we can try to get the word out to as
[59:20] many people as want to hear uh so we
[59:22] don't care how many are here as long as
[59:24] Jesus is here praise God
[59:26] amen as long as the spirit of Truth is
[59:29] here that's what matters praise
[59:31] God so Simon's like yeah he said could
[59:34] have been a number of things he said but
[59:35] when you got thus sayi the Lord when you
[59:37] got a word from the Lord you can rejoice
[59:38] in that yes I can too praise God thank
[59:42] the lord well I needed that one well I
[59:44] tell you brother Ray and look now
[59:46] because of Co he can't come so just God
[59:48] allowed that for
[59:51] a he said every time I drive by your
[59:54] church he said I thank the Lord for a
[59:56] lighthouse in akan
[59:59] Ohio verse three I entreat thee also
[1:00:02] true yoke fellow so see there are true
[1:00:06] workers and there are false workers
[1:00:08] around the message right now what's a
[1:00:11] Yol fellow a yoke fellow is someone
[1:00:14] who's married to
[1:00:15] you so Paul says see we're all married
[1:00:18] together right we're all the bride we're
[1:00:20] engaged to
[1:00:22] Christ right all all of you yoke to me
[1:00:26] all of you Yol we have a relationship we
[1:00:27] have an office we have a labor we have a
[1:00:29] study we have a business we're yoke
[1:00:31] fellow we're Partners all of my partners
[1:00:35] are yolked in marriage to
[1:00:37] Christ but there are some of us that are
[1:00:39] false not some of us but there's some
[1:00:41] people around the message that are false
[1:00:43] yoke Yol
[1:00:44] fellow right they try to come and put
[1:00:47] their shoulders to the wheel but then
[1:00:48] they H because of this and offenses come
[1:00:50] and all these things I can't I can't
[1:00:52] labor in that anymore I'm not a partner
[1:00:54] with that anymore but Paul says thank
[1:00:57] God for the true ones and let me say
[1:01:00] that thank you for being a true yoke
[1:01:02] fellow can I just say that this morning
[1:01:04] because we don't have any Impostors here
[1:01:05] this morning praise God amen hallelujah
[1:01:09] thank you true Yol fellow who are
[1:01:11] partnered with us to proclaim the Gospel
[1:01:14] of Jesus Christ and to change this our
[1:01:17] lives our families this city to whatever
[1:01:20] extent God will have us this world this
[1:01:22] nation we're trying to promote the
[1:01:24] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:01:27] with our yoke
[1:01:28] fellow see your tithes and offerings I
[1:01:30] couldn't do it without your tithes and
[1:01:31] offerings listen without your tithes and
[1:01:33] offerings we are yolked we're Partners
[1:01:36] in the gospel of
[1:01:38] Christ I can't do it
[1:01:40] alone those Ox didn't do it by
[1:01:42] themselves they needed someone Yol to
[1:01:44] them praise God or Yol
[1:01:48] together and so Paul tells them at
[1:01:50] Philippi help those women that labored
[1:01:53] with me those true Yol fellow those true
[1:01:55] partners in the gospel help those
[1:01:57] sisters huh isn't that
[1:01:59] strange the weak women weren't getting
[1:02:02] enough attention paid to them does that
[1:02:04] sound familiar a lot of message churches
[1:02:07] they don't care about the
[1:02:08] sisters just
[1:02:10] about said can you please help those
[1:02:12] women they're just as in helping us as
[1:02:16] everybody
[1:02:17] else praise God they're they're Yol they
[1:02:22] Yol to Christ just as much as anybody
[1:02:24] else praise God see how important your
[1:02:25] prayers are
[1:02:27] Church see how important your attendance
[1:02:29] is your tithes and offerings your
[1:02:30] singing your specials I I missed your
[1:02:33] special didn't I I'm sorry I just
[1:02:36] realized
[1:02:37] that forgive me okay second service okay
[1:02:40] thank
[1:02:43] you well it happens every week I fail
[1:02:45] somehow you know so I always always
[1:02:47] forget one thing forgive me sister I'm
[1:02:51] sorry so Paul tells them help those
[1:02:54] sisters that have labored with me now
[1:02:57] not preaching but the he says later in
[1:03:00] other scriptures that have secured me or
[1:03:02] ministered to my needs in other words
[1:03:04] fed me made me clothes fixed my clothes
[1:03:07] or giving me offerings or help me out
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:10] know now this is interesting too he says
[1:03:13] he names Clement Clement was a a
[1:03:16] companion of Paul a member of the Church
[1:03:18] of Philippi he was identical with a uh
[1:03:21] CL Clement who was Bishop of Rome
[1:03:23] towards the close of the first century
[1:03:27] okay so Paul says uh let me let me read
[1:03:29] that there in verse three I entreat thee
[1:03:33] also true yoke fellow help those women
[1:03:35] which labored with me in the gospel with
[1:03:36] Clement also and with other my fellow
[1:03:39] laborers whose names are in the Book of
[1:03:42] Life praise
[1:03:44] God so Paul says help those sisters that
[1:03:47] labor with me and also the other
[1:03:49] preachers there's the five-fold ministry
[1:03:51] and and the Saints said see anyone who's
[1:03:54] helping the fivefold Ministry is a true
[1:03:56] yoke fellow praise God whether it's the
[1:03:59] prophet whether it's Pastor Clement
[1:04:01] amen whoever's helping them Paul says
[1:04:04] they're yoke F and their names are in
[1:04:07] the Book of Life praise God that's how
[1:04:11] you know your name is there you see the
[1:04:13] message you support it and you uh you're
[1:04:16] interested in getting the message out
[1:04:19] that shows you're a yoke fellow a true
[1:04:22] one praise God now I got a lot of
[1:04:25] history on met and Rome so let me go
[1:04:27] through this quickly I didn't want to
[1:04:30] put it on there and not preach it after
[1:04:33] first receiving the gospel around 36 ad
[1:04:36] so that was about three years after the
[1:04:37] Holy Ghost fell Rome got the Rome got
[1:04:39] the gospel from the apostles andronicus
[1:04:43] and Junia did you know that Paul names
[1:04:45] the brothers that left Jerusalem that
[1:04:47] went to Rome to bring the Holy Ghost
[1:04:49] there andr andronicus and Junia look how
[1:04:54] Jesus said them two by two
[1:04:58] the first church in Rome fell during a
[1:05:00] 13-year period so the Holy Ghost
[1:05:03] flourished from 30 so what's that four
[1:05:04] five years the Holy Ghost flourished in
[1:05:07] Rome
[1:05:08] until uh there was a the Jewish
[1:05:11] Christian apostles were banned from the
[1:05:13] city so the leaders in Rome banned all
[1:05:16] the Holy Ghost filled Saints and guess
[1:05:18] what all the Holy Ghost filled saints
[1:05:19] went those that weren't born again
[1:05:22] stayed because they were kind of half
[1:05:25] halfway
[1:05:26] but all the Holy Ghost filled Saints
[1:05:28] left Rome for 13 years this is legit
[1:05:32] history so they're banned for 13 years
[1:05:35] finally they get to come back but with
[1:05:38] the faithful yeah with the faithful
[1:05:40] expelled worship of Bale and asra
[1:05:42] flourish in the midst of the lukewarm
[1:05:44] church members they still came to church
[1:05:46] but they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:48] filled Saints there anymore so now
[1:05:50] little worship of baale came in ashth I
[1:05:54] idolatry slipped in the church Church
[1:05:55] without the Holy Ghost filled Saints
[1:05:58] when they came back 13 years later the
[1:06:01] Pagan infused Church repulsed them every
[1:06:05] the saints were like what is going on
[1:06:07] this don't even look like a holy ghost
[1:06:08] filled
[1:06:10] church and then the Bible said Jesus
[1:06:12] removed his Candlestick from the first
[1:06:14] church in Rome as he warned and Christ
[1:06:16] raised up a second Church of Rome the
[1:06:19] First Church of Rome is still there it's
[1:06:21] the Vatican and the Saints said there
[1:06:25] was the second Church of Rome Third
[1:06:26] Church of Rome there was all these
[1:06:28] churches because people let down the
[1:06:30] bars so God had to send a new thing
[1:06:32] praise
[1:06:34] God Satan's first tactic was to
[1:06:36] persecute the Holy Ghost filled Saints
[1:06:38] get them out of the church for 13
[1:06:43] years now beginning in 4180 the First
[1:06:46] Church of Rome slowly and consistently
[1:06:48] added Pagan Deeds to their worship until
[1:06:50] they rejected traditional holy Passover
[1:06:53] observance so where did they fall short
[1:06:55] in their holiday
[1:06:57] Services history says the first thing
[1:06:59] they compromised on was their holiday
[1:07:02] worship the Passover the
[1:07:05] resurrection history said they started
[1:07:07] embracing the Pagan Easter feast of
[1:07:10] Ishtar when polycarp arrived around 150
[1:07:14] he said the faithful Bishop also
[1:07:16] detested their wicked Deeds of idolatry
[1:07:18] with statues in the
[1:07:21] Eucharist so they started compromising
[1:07:23] when they got a day off they started
[1:07:25] acting like the world in their holiday
[1:07:27] celebrations raing rather than acting
[1:07:30] like a real
[1:07:32] Christian so we got to be very careful
[1:07:35] now I still have the same stance about
[1:07:36] Christmas Easter Thanksgiving you name
[1:07:39] it I still got the same stance there's
[1:07:41] Liberties you have but if you see your
[1:07:42] life starting to fall away because of
[1:07:45] traditions you must cut off those
[1:07:48] traditions because a a because a liberty
[1:07:51] is something you do it doesn't help you
[1:07:53] spiritually it doesn't help you any
[1:07:55] spiritual
[1:07:56] way so be careful what you allow in your
[1:07:59] Liberty because uh if if if you're not
[1:08:02] careful a false spirit will get in there
[1:08:04] to make you act like the
[1:08:08] world that's why I like uh the youth
[1:08:12] meetings in
[1:08:13] Louisiana over Easter because they lock
[1:08:16] them in there and they preach to them
[1:08:17] and you need the holy
[1:08:19] ghost man that's so different than the
[1:08:21] Easter of this world Amen God bless that
[1:08:24] brother Tim br
[1:08:26] he said he's had so much criticism for
[1:08:28] that over the years and look at how God
[1:08:29] has blessed him for
[1:08:30] that I like that praise
[1:08:34] God so see they start with just
[1:08:36] compromising on oh we just celebrate
[1:08:38] this way we just do Christmas and we
[1:08:40] just do Easter we just do Thanksgiving
[1:08:42] this way watch a few football games yeah
[1:08:44] you're on the road out
[1:08:46] brother you're gonna have a game all
[1:08:47] right you're gonna have a sell your soul
[1:08:49] to the devil kind of thing that's the
[1:08:51] kind of game you're going to get into
[1:08:56] and by the time polycarp gets there in
[1:08:57] 50 ad they have lit 150 ad they have
[1:09:00] literal statues and they're already
[1:09:01] doing
[1:09:03] transubstantiation 90 years
[1:09:06] later just because that 13-year absence
[1:09:10] now look I I love it what it says
[1:09:14] uh okay this is all about polycarp okay
[1:09:16] he learned from John polycarp couldn't
[1:09:18] bear false teachers and tried them he
[1:09:20] would not even talk with Mar marcion and
[1:09:23] Valentini who were the Great Roman of
[1:09:25] false doctrines at the time at 90 years
[1:09:28] old he traveled
[1:09:30] 1,500 miles to plead with anus the
[1:09:35] bishop of the First Church of Rome
[1:09:36] remember Clement was a bishop at Rome
[1:09:38] but 90 years later another Bishop rose
[1:09:41] up in the first church of course Clement
[1:09:43] was a good brother this is a bad brother
[1:09:45] and he pleaded with him to repent of his
[1:09:48] participation the Pagan Easter
[1:09:50] celebrations in every city he visited
[1:09:52] while approaching Rome he preached
[1:09:54] Christ and saw mirac and healings at 90
[1:09:58] years old church be encouraged no matter
[1:10:00] how old you are if you're a yielded
[1:10:02] vessel Christ can do great things he'll
[1:10:04] heal the sick and through your life
[1:10:06] praise God he'll cast out Devils through
[1:10:07] your life he'll hear your prayers just
[1:10:09] remain
[1:10:11] devoted now if he can travel 1,500 miles
[1:10:14] to correct a bishop why can't I make a
[1:10:16] video to correct a prophet's
[1:10:21] son Hallelujah
[1:10:26] oh and the prophet Sunny he's called me
[1:10:27] a make believer now not me personally
[1:10:29] but he's called anyone that doesn't
[1:10:31] believe in playing tapes make Believers
[1:10:32] he's also called us deuses for not
[1:10:35] playing tapes so anybody that'll say
[1:10:36] that about me well I got a right in
[1:10:38] Christian love to bring correction to
[1:10:39] that but that's the part people don't
[1:10:42] like to
[1:10:43] do oh you can't touch that person why
[1:10:45] why
[1:10:47] not if I'm wrong if I'm a Child of God
[1:10:49] God's going to spank me if he's a child
[1:10:52] of God God's got to correct him
[1:10:55] so poly carp said why don't God use me
[1:10:58] and so God Vindicated it amen God
[1:11:01] Vindicated his trip praise God to
[1:11:03] correct the Church of Rome but they
[1:11:04] turned him down once in Rome he visited
[1:11:06] the first church he witnessed their
[1:11:08] worship of images Peter and the
[1:11:09] Eucharist and and seus and I'm sorry
[1:11:12] anicetus refused correction picart
[1:11:14] visited the second and third churches of
[1:11:16] Rome and saw God pour out Rome's last
[1:11:18] recorded Revival around 150 ad the last
[1:11:22] Revival the sick were healed demons cast
[1:11:25] out dead were raised Al life before
[1:11:26] leaving poar also brought back the
[1:11:28] straying Val valencians and the
[1:11:31] marcionites out of false Doctrine into
[1:11:33] truth their first love and look what
[1:11:35] happened when he got home you think he'd
[1:11:36] be a hero right when he got back no when
[1:11:40] he returned to samna eventually turned
[1:11:42] himself into the pagans demanding his
[1:11:44] life in order to spare the other
[1:11:45] Christians lives when he got back he
[1:11:47] wasn't a a he wasn't a hero he was a he
[1:11:50] was a
[1:11:51] scumbag and they said you better turn
[1:11:53] yourself in or we're going to burn down
[1:11:55] found all these Christians houses and
[1:11:56] murder him and kill him so he turned
[1:11:58] himself in what a man of
[1:12:01] God he he gave his own life in order to
[1:12:04] spare the lives of other men he was
[1:12:06] burned to death as a testimony of how
[1:12:08] Christlike he was
[1:12:12] my the pagans would not allow his
[1:12:14] disciples to have his corpse look look
[1:12:16] how much he was like Christ because they
[1:12:18] said that his disciples would claim he
[1:12:20] revived and raised from the dead like
[1:12:22] Christ so they flayed his flesh and they
[1:12:25] ground his bones and cast his ashes over
[1:12:28] a running stream they wouldn't give his
[1:12:30] body back because they thought he'd rise
[1:12:32] from the dead that's how much he was
[1:12:34] like Christ God help us church God help
[1:12:37] us to be like
[1:12:39] Christ what a saint and what it start
[1:12:42] with again

[1:13:17] your name's in heaven or not I'm glad to
[1:13:19] be associated with brother Brandon
[1:13:20] praise God hallelujah although many
[1:13:23] people don't think I am I am I don't
[1:13:25] care what they say you know because what
[1:13:28] I preach praise
[1:13:29] God but see who you yoke with who you
[1:13:33] partner with shows where your name's
[1:13:40] at he said usually people that have
[1:13:43] gifts are the people who don't want
[1:13:44] gifts see Paul tried to run from the
[1:13:46] things so did Moses great leaders like
[1:13:48] to try to run from the job they know
[1:13:50] what lays before them so if you take guy
[1:13:52] that says oh Lord fill me with power
[1:13:53] I'll go out there cast out devils so
[1:13:55] never do it God knows better than to
[1:13:57] trust anybody like that see it's the guy
[1:13:59] that don't want nothing to do with it
[1:14:00] you see that's the guy that God can take
[1:14:02] him and teach him something
[1:14:06] sometime you see so what has God taught
[1:14:10] you and I
[1:14:11] lately see we want we need to be taught
[1:14:13] things church we need to be taught how
[1:14:16] to labor for the kingdom of God we need
[1:14:19] to be taught as we said with our gifts
[1:14:20] we need to be taught how to use our
[1:14:22] gifts and to focus on them that God can
[1:14:25] use us to bless other
[1:14:30] people see so let let's not add let's
[1:14:33] not ask God God I got to do a miracle or
[1:14:35] God i' I've got to cast out a devil
[1:14:38] let's say God teach me something so I
[1:14:40] can help
[1:14:41] somebody teach me how to live my life so
[1:14:43] I can be a blessing to somebody
[1:14:49] else here this is just about the book of
[1:14:51] life so brother saying he's talking
[1:14:52] about Judas right they all Rejoice but
[1:14:54] Jesus said you you need to Rejoice that
[1:14:55] your name's on The Book of Life not
[1:14:57] because you do Miracles because your
[1:14:59] name's on the book in heaven name has
[1:15:01] been recognized still doesn't mean
[1:15:02] you're Sav see you're not life that's
[1:15:05] not the blam's book of life and that
[1:15:07] records the living who are confessing
[1:15:09] salvation yet not sealed by the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost right the Bible said on that day
[1:15:14] there's Books open there's the book of
[1:15:16] life and then the Bible says books so
[1:15:18] there's many books that will be open one
[1:15:20] of those books is the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:21] Life and one of those books is The Book
[1:15:23] of Life praise God
[1:15:25] and so we know your name can never be
[1:15:27] removed off the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:29] because that's what the Bible says amen
[1:15:31] the Bible says that Revelation 13 those
[1:15:34] that don't worship the Beast their names
[1:15:36] were recorded on the book of the lamb
[1:15:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:39] praise God so it can never be removed
[1:15:42] amen that means god knew you'd be a true
[1:15:46] worshipper you wouldn't love
[1:15:47] denominational things right you would
[1:15:49] love holy things you'd love righteous
[1:15:52] things youd love the power of God Amen
[1:15:55] so God put your name on the Lamb's Book
[1:15:57] of
[1:15:58] Life and Paul said the women that work
[1:16:00] with me oh I know where their names are
[1:16:02] at they're on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:05] amen and we'll see why here in a little
[1:16:08] bit we'll see why why were they how did
[1:16:10] Paul know their names were on the Lamb's
[1:16:11] Book of
[1:16:15] Life now I'm going to get skip past
[1:16:19] that right here how did Paul know these
[1:16:22] sisters names were on the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:24] Life because for my life laid down their
[1:16:27] own necks unto whom not only I give
[1:16:30] thanks but all the churches of the
[1:16:31] Gentiles in other words they put their
[1:16:33] lives can I say like this for us it's
[1:16:35] your reputation you sisters put your
[1:16:38] reputation on the line when you dress
[1:16:40] like a modest woman is that right God's
[1:16:43] not asking you to be a martyr right now
[1:16:45] to lay your but you put your reputation
[1:16:47] on the line you some of you could put
[1:16:49] your jobs on the line i' i' been sisters
[1:16:51] have emailed me this week a sister
[1:16:53] emailed me just last night and said I'm
[1:16:56] wearing skirts now only I just quit my
[1:16:58] job I lost my job because of it I said
[1:17:00] God bless you for
[1:17:04] that now let me go back see Paul knew
[1:17:07] they were names were in heaven because
[1:17:09] they sacrificed everything to support
[1:17:11] the message of God let me go back I
[1:17:15] commend unto you Phoebe our sister
[1:17:16] here's some more fellow labors who's a
[1:17:18] servant of the church which is at uh
[1:17:21] Sentria that you receive her in the Lord
[1:17:23] has become a Saints you assist her in
[1:17:26] whatsoever business she hath need of you
[1:17:29] for she ha been a secure of many and of
[1:17:31] myself also that means a provider or an
[1:17:35] assistant or someone who ministers to
[1:17:37] your needs and Paul tells the brothers
[1:17:40] make sure you help these sisters help
[1:17:42] other people so let me say like this
[1:17:44] sisters if you have a Ministry of
[1:17:46] helping feed the poor and you need my
[1:17:48] help let me know I'll help
[1:17:51] you I just gave brother Jose a offering
[1:17:54] to help that woman down there who didn't
[1:17:55] uh in uh Columbia she didn't have any
[1:17:57] food he was supposed to mail this week
[1:17:59] or at least I'm sorry Western Union this
[1:18:01] week we are supposed to help those who
[1:18:04] are helping others praise God that's why
[1:18:07] I've always said if you know someone
[1:18:09] your neighbor somebody who doesn't have
[1:18:10] food let me know so we can help
[1:18:16] them you think this is you think we need
[1:18:19] to take this out of the Bible like this
[1:18:20] doesn't need to be
[1:18:21] preached I think it needs to be preached
[1:18:23] more
[1:18:25] right because we're in Le sea
[1:18:26] everybody's rich and we get our eyes off
[1:18:28] of those people that are hurting
[1:18:30] sometimes we forget to help the poor
[1:18:32] right we forget forget to keep our eyes
[1:18:34] open and our ears open for people that
[1:18:36] are
[1:18:37] needy I think it needs preach just as
[1:18:39] much
[1:18:40] today greet Priscilla and Aquilla they
[1:18:44] had a house church for Paul they had a
[1:18:47] church in their house not like this
[1:18:49] likewise greet the church that is in
[1:18:50] their house salute my
[1:18:53] wellbeloved EpiPen who is the first
[1:18:55] fruits of a AI unto Christ greet Mary
[1:18:59] who bestowed much labor on
[1:19:02] us how did Paul know these women and men
[1:19:05] why would Paul salute them in his letter
[1:19:07] because they put their lives on the line
[1:19:09] for the message they put their
[1:19:12] reputation on the line for the message I
[1:19:14] thank God all of you put your incomes on
[1:19:16] the line for this message don't
[1:19:21] you this is why Paul sends special
[1:19:23] greetings greet that one greet that one
[1:19:26] greet that one they've laid their lives
[1:19:28] on the line for this
[1:19:30] message and they're my partners in the
[1:19:33] gospel oh church we when we get there we
[1:19:36] ain't going to just see men on the front
[1:19:37] lines we're going to see women on the
[1:19:38] front
[1:19:39] lines praise
[1:19:42] God some of them labor more than the
[1:19:45] brothers right we all know pastors be
[1:19:48] and I were talking about it in Naomi one
[1:19:49] we all know pastors they get treated
[1:19:51] like kings and they hardly they all they
[1:19:53] do is preach they don't do anything else
[1:19:54] and that's fine for them but what about
[1:19:57] all the people laboring doing more labor
[1:20:00] and suffering more and working harder
[1:20:02] than even the
[1:20:04] preachers who's going to get the greater
[1:20:06] reward those who invested in their gifts
[1:20:09] more those who took that Talent invested
[1:20:12] in it and doubled
[1:20:13] it that's who's going to get the greater
[1:20:15] reward not those who got life on easy
[1:20:18] street now it's different if they're
[1:20:20] praying and fasting in all that free
[1:20:21] time they got that's different and
[1:20:24] they're going to got a great reward for
[1:20:26] that I'm talking about people that don't
[1:20:28] want to serve they just want to be
[1:20:31] served that's heathenism Jesus said the
[1:20:33] Gentiles just want a lord over people
[1:20:36] I'm not here a lord over you I'm here to
[1:20:37] let the Lord rule you I'm here to speak
[1:20:39] the Lord's word to help you be a servant
[1:20:42] to us all praise
[1:20:45] God to make sure we're all yolked
[1:20:48] together we're all true yoke fell we're
[1:20:51] true Partners in the gospel
[1:20:57] this man epenetus his name means
[1:21:00] praiseworthy a Christian at Rome greeted
[1:21:02] by St Paul designated his his beloved
[1:21:06] I'm sorry he's designated as Paul's
[1:21:09] beloved because he was the first saint
[1:21:12] saved see Church each person has a
[1:21:15] special testimony in the local church
[1:21:17] under Christ Paul says I remember when
[1:21:20] that brother that s first sister got
[1:21:23] saved there in Rome oh I remember when
[1:21:25] that Lydia got received the first

[1:21:31] when God met or God saved this sister at
[1:21:33] the airport I remember when this sister
[1:21:35] got the holy ghost at the altar praise
[1:21:37] God I remember when God saved that guy

[1:21:41] testimony God's writing a testimony of
[1:21:44] your life and it's going to be a witness
[1:21:46] with the Overcomers but it's going to be
[1:21:47] a witness against those who turned down
[1:21:50] Christ it's a beautiful story
[1:21:56] I've had Brothers tell me you're going
[1:21:57] to be a witness to those who had smaller
[1:22:00] families and had full-time pastorship
[1:22:02] this is what they told me and did less
[1:22:05] for the kingdom of God well my prayer is
[1:22:08] to do more for the kingdom of God help

[1:25:50] I'm going to I'm planning to leave this
[1:25:52] place
[1:25:54] right I I'm I'm living in a way that I I
[1:25:57] know Jesus is coming back praise God
[1:26:00] that's how I live my life I'm not really
[1:26:02] tied too much to the things of the world
[1:26:03] here I'm not penny pinching and all
[1:26:06] these things like that you know as far
[1:26:08] as like oh I'm gonna be here forever I'm
[1:26:10] not going to be here forever I'm going
[1:26:11] to go up to the mayor supper the lamb
[1:26:13] praise
[1:26:16] God now it's okay to Penny pinch we got
[1:26:19] different kinds you know of people I'm
[1:26:22] saying our plan is not to be here for
[1:26:24] forever is to go in the
[1:26:27] Rapture if it doesn't well then brother
[1:26:29] said we're more blessed we get to be
[1:26:31] raised
[1:26:33] first we all we all say we want to live
[1:26:36] to the Rapture and not die but brother
[1:26:38] said you're more blessed if you die
[1:26:39] because you're raised
[1:26:41] first so oh you think about that one
[1:26:43] later
[1:26:44] today because I don't want to die really
[1:26:48] but if I die I'm more blessed because I
[1:26:51] get to have a new body first
[1:26:55] now brother just says what if God would
[1:26:56] have told John the Revelator now it's
[1:26:58] going to be 2,000 years before my coming
[1:27:00] John would have come back and told the
[1:27:01] church well guess you might as well eat
[1:27:03] drink be married because there's going
[1:27:05] to be many
[1:27:06] generations oh Jesus ain't coming for
[1:27:08] 2,000 years see so see church he said
[1:27:11] the church would be
[1:27:13] loose there would have been no on the
[1:27:16] mark Or No Focus or not I'm hitting the
[1:27:19] target so many times Our Lives don't hit
[1:27:22] the target right our lives got to hit a
[1:27:25] Target I need to accomplish this and
[1:27:28] brother man says if if you're not if if
[1:27:29] you're not living like the Rapture soon
[1:27:31] your life is not it's not going to hit
[1:27:33] the target It's Gonna Miss it's gonna go
[1:27:35] over like brother said it's gonna go
[1:27:36] over top of your head right we're gonna
[1:27:39] miss the target so in other words you
[1:27:40] have to have a focus you have to have a
[1:27:43] yoke fellow you have to have a yoke you
[1:27:45] have to have a
[1:27:46] Ministry and you got to stay centered on
[1:27:49] that and hit the mark of that Ministry
[1:27:54] and you will if you think Jesus is soon
[1:27:55] to
[1:27:56] come you know that's why I tell you all
[1:27:58] all of you the numbers of videos I do
[1:28:01] it's not to brag but it's for me to know
[1:28:03] that when Jesus comes I'm going to tell
[1:28:05] him Lord I've labored for
[1:28:07] you it's so I know that I've I've not
[1:28:11] quit right I'm aiming my aim is to do
[1:28:14] more and I'm letting you know that just
[1:28:17] to keep me encouraged too so I don't get
[1:28:18] discouraged when my videos flop and
[1:28:20] nobody seems to like them but said keep
[1:28:22] me encouraged praise praise God that I'm
[1:28:25] pressing on toward the mark to spread
[1:28:27] this gospel to preach the gospel to
[1:28:29] every nation and we're doing it through
[1:28:30] the internet until this Corona virus
[1:28:33] lets up and we can send them out again
[1:28:35] praise God like we did help Craig and
[1:28:37] help Simon and we sent some to bend the
[1:28:39] rod over the
[1:28:40] years see there have been no waiting so
[1:28:43] we got to keep our focus on Jesus return
[1:28:46] brother they said brother should
[1:28:47] evangelist continue on the field of
[1:28:48] course what do they mean certainly by
[1:28:50] all means don't change the thing if
[1:28:51] Jesus come in the morning Preach Today
[1:28:53] like it was going to be 10 years from
[1:28:55] today but live like it's going to be at
[1:28:58] this
[1:28:59] hour these are familiar I just want to
[1:29:01] review them to you and let me close it
[1:29:03] this church may God help us to live free
[1:29:06] from
[1:29:07] Stress and
[1:29:10] Anxiety what a lesson sister Wendy a man
[1:29:12] in prison telling me not to get stressed
[1:29:17] out he's in prison probably been beaten
[1:29:20] diseases
[1:29:22] infections stale bread can you imagine
[1:29:26] dirty water they had to get out of the
[1:29:27] well you think they gave him the best
[1:29:29] water in in prison do you think he got
[1:29:31] the best food in prison a man who's
[1:29:33] getting treated like
[1:29:35] trash and he tells them you don't have
[1:29:38] to live with all that
[1:29:39] stress let go of your
[1:29:43] anxiety he said don't be careful for
[1:29:46] anything don't get stress out and don't
[1:29:49] get anxiety for any single cause
[1:29:54] amen who's telling me that a man who's
[1:29:57] locked up in
[1:29:59] jail who has no Freedom who is at the
[1:30:03] mercy and he could be killed any moment
[1:30:05] sister beatric but he's like I'm not
[1:30:07] worried about it I've got the peace of
[1:30:10] God in my
[1:30:12] heart well no doubt that's from the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost seal though right that only
[1:30:17] Springs forth out of a soul that's
[1:30:19] sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:22] Ghost who's telling you to not worry
[1:30:25] about anything a man who could have
[1:30:27] worried about all of his problems oh the
[1:30:30] preachers are bad mouthing me that was
[1:30:31] chapter one The Women aren't getting
[1:30:34] along in the church what happened to my
[1:30:36] is my Ministry very
[1:30:38] effective no it was very effective
[1:30:40] wherever you have this flesh you're
[1:30:42] going to have
[1:30:43] problems but may may they be minor
[1:30:49] problems do not be stressed out for
[1:30:51] anything church but in every trial use
[1:30:56] prayer and supplication is intercession
[1:31:00] with Thanksgiving and make your request
[1:31:04] known unto
[1:31:07] God well brother Jesse this person died
[1:31:10] or my my family hates me or I lost my
[1:31:14] job or this and this in everything give
[1:31:19] thanks don't let anything stress out
[1:31:22] your mind so you get your ey eyes off of
[1:31:25] Christ you're going to miss the mark
[1:31:27] right you're going to miss the Mark
[1:31:30] if if you start worrying about something
[1:31:32] else you're going to miss the service
[1:31:34] the job you're supposed to
[1:31:36] do your arrow is going to go way off the
[1:31:41] mark but he said don't let anything
[1:31:43] cause you Stress and Anxiety so you stop
[1:31:47] the the Yoke and the work and the
[1:31:48] service that you're doing together as a
[1:31:51] local church remember this is to a local
[1:31:52] church
[1:31:54] is to a little church like bride of
[1:31:55] Christ Fellowship praise
[1:31:58] God don't let anything stress you out
[1:32:01] don't worry about
[1:32:03] it but you can't just say don't worry
[1:32:05] about it you got to say go pray about it
[1:32:08] and don't worry about it
[1:32:11] yes so our question is have you prayed
[1:32:14] about whatever you're
[1:32:16] battling that will be the answer Church
[1:32:18] to every anxiety and stress that you
[1:32:21] have
[1:32:24] what does careful mean anxious troubled
[1:32:26] with cares to care for to look at to
[1:32:29] seek to promote one L it is your
[1:32:31] interest that's why we get so anxious
[1:32:33] because we want something to happen
[1:32:34] instead of wanting what God wants to
[1:32:38] happen caring or providing for oh I've
[1:32:41] got to do this I've got to care I God's
[1:32:44] going to take care of it that's right
[1:32:45] now God will give you a partnership in
[1:32:47] doing that but Paul says don't be
[1:32:49] careful for anything don't have anxiety
[1:32:52] and stress over anything see church will
[1:32:54] only be thankful and this Thanksgiving
[1:32:56] right we'll only be thankful it only
[1:33:00] comes how can I be thankful how can I
[1:33:02] make sure I I worship the right way you
[1:33:04] have to pray and make your request to
[1:33:08] God to move on your behalf even though
[1:33:12] you're content if he
[1:33:14] doesn't this is the only way to overcome
[1:33:17] the anxieties in our lives is to get
[1:33:20] alone with God In Prayer or maybe here
[1:33:22] at the church and just say God I want
[1:33:24] this to happen this but nevertheless let
[1:33:26] your will be done and I'm going to stand
[1:33:28] up and I'm going to thank you and I'm
[1:33:29] going to sing the songs and give thanks
[1:33:31] and praise God and the anxiety will
[1:33:33] leave you praise God it can't stay in
[1:33:37] the presence of Christ in the presence
[1:33:38] of thankfulness that anxiety devil can't
[1:33:41] stay he's got to flee praise God resist
[1:33:44] anxiety and it will flee from you resist
[1:33:47] stress and it will flee from you through
[1:33:50] thankful prayer and the confidence that
[1:33:52] I ask God and whatever God decides to do
[1:33:56] that's fine with me but I asked him
[1:33:57] praise God and that will keep my heart
[1:34:00] in a state of
[1:34:02] peace that even a man in a prison could
[1:34:07] experience let's stand to our feet
[1:34:11] here it's okay to ask your request
[1:34:15] church but just give God a chance to do
[1:34:17] something outside of
[1:34:19] it and then this formula has to work for
[1:34:23] its thus sayeth the
[1:34:24] Lord as long as you pray you make
[1:34:28] intercession you make your requests and
[1:34:31] you give thanks the bible promises the
[1:34:35] peace of God will come into your heart
[1:34:38] musicians if you'll
[1:34:42] come it's through prayer the peace of
[1:34:44] God overcomes all anxiety and
[1:34:48] trouble this was Sister Naomi's memory
[1:34:50] verse earlier this year right
[1:34:53] the peace of God which passes all
[1:34:57] understanding let me look up that word
[1:34:58] pass here I knew I had my computer up
[1:35:01] here for one
[1:35:04] reason the peace of God which
[1:35:07] passes all understanding it means to go
[1:35:11] higher to stand out to rise above am
[1:35:15] Eagles right Rising above the peace of
[1:35:18] God will rise up it'll be superior it'll
[1:35:20] be greater in power it'll surpass all of
[1:35:23] your
[1:35:24] understanding well all I can understand
[1:35:26] is I've got rats and mice around me and
[1:35:28] I'm getting dirty water and food and I'm
[1:35:30] in Chains that's all I can understand
[1:35:32] but Paul said I'm not going to look at
[1:35:33] that I'm GNA pray for deliverance and
[1:35:35] even if God doesn't praise the Lord and
[1:35:37] so he rose above that
[1:35:40] situation he rose Up On Eagle's
[1:35:44] Wings and if he can rise over his
[1:35:46] anxiety how many believe you can rise
[1:35:48] over it as
[1:35:49] well praise God let's play that song The
[1:35:51] Wings of Faith as we have a word of
[1:35:53] prayer here
[1:35:54] if anyone desires Prayer church you're
[1:35:55] more than welcome to come I could anoint
[1:35:57] you with oil if you feel led to do that
[1:36:00] we can pray for you let's not have any
[1:36:03] anxiety or
[1:36:07] stress this is a stressful time you
[1:36:09] probably heard the the statistics in
[1:36:11] America all the suicides and uh all the
[1:36:14] the the drug overdoses because of being
[1:36:17] locked
[1:36:18] down that's just Devils right that's
[1:36:21] just Devils but the Bible gave the way
[1:36:23] out if you're locked down you're not
[1:36:25] locked out of heaven can I say like that
[1:36:27] you might be locked out of your job you
[1:36:30] might be locked out of your family
[1:36:31] fellowship but you're not you have the
[1:36:33] Open Door to Heaven praise God Amen
[1:36:36] praise God
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:38] Amen you have direct access to the
[1:36:41] throne of God and you are promised peace
[1:36:44] don't say brother Jesse I tried it no no
[1:36:46] you must not try it the right
[1:36:48] way because Paul said it will surpass
[1:36:52] everything you understand
[1:36:56] it will keep your heart in mind that
[1:36:58] means guard it'll guard you how
[1:37:02] father we thank you for this word today
[1:37:05] how relevant your word is
[1:37:08] today my
[1:37:11] goodness Lord I just love how you lead

[1:37:38] to serve
[1:37:41] you and lastly
[1:37:45] Lord if we are stressed out and if we
[1:37:47] have anxiety may we follow the Bible
[1:37:50] remedy for that
[1:37:51] problem prayer
[1:37:54] telling God what we want to happen
[1:37:56] asking him but then yielding to him and
