[3:18] so I'd like to just preach a little
[3:20] message on the marred Visage of Jesus
[3:22] tonight as I said on Wednesday uh by
[3:25] God's grace looks like the live stream's
[3:26] working tonight so God bless the live
[3:27] stre streamers sorry it kind of went the
[3:30] last few services but for some reason it
[3:31] just started working tonight so thank
[3:33] God for that the marred Visage of
[3:36] Jesus of course we're looking at the
[3:39] cross and Calvary tonight being that
[3:41] it's good Friday I put out a video today
[3:43] with just a lot of good quotes from
[3:44] Brother brandom about how we was
[3:46] constantly trusting in the blood of
[3:47] Jesus Christ I don't know about you but
[3:49] that just makes the cross seem re like
[3:51] brand new to me when brother bram's like
[3:53] I've got to trust in Jesus Christ I he
[3:56] said uh he said I have no merits on my
[3:59] own the he said I cannot get into heaven
[4:01] on my merits only on the merits of Jesus
[4:04] Christ it's so refreshing so refreshing
[4:06] to hear that a man that never built a a
[4:08] mega church you know just a man who was
[4:11] humble and served God it's and yet with
[4:13] all these tremendous Miracles and
[4:14] Revelations and the Seven Seals and the
[4:17] mysteries of God yet he would say uh he
[4:19] would tell us uh don't look at me he
[4:21] said put all this grace on Jesus Christ
[4:24] that's our real servant of God right
[4:25] there Hallelujah so let's go to Isaiah
[4:27] 52 uh verse 13 by God's
[4:34] grace again we appreciate everybody's
[4:36] prayers and everybody's dedication to
[4:38] the house of the Lord you know these
[4:39] last few weeks here and of course the
[4:40] whole time but uh appreciate everybody's
[4:42] dedication and
[4:45] sacrifice Hallelujah uh Wednesday you
[4:47] know I preached on that little thought
[4:49] about the sun shall be darkened and I
[4:51] looked at you know eclipses in the Bible
[4:54] uh if you didn't hear that let me know
[4:55] if you'd like to hear that by God's
[4:57] grace me personally I don't see any
[4:59] connection with April 8th to anything
[5:01] significant to the
[5:03] Gentiles I mean we in one way we can say
[5:06] every eclipse is some type of a sign
[5:08] right I mean everything in the heavens
[5:09] is a sign but as far as like scripture
[5:12] and prophecy is an eclipse and there's
[5:15] four every year right around the world
[5:16] at least four sometimes there's seven uh
[5:19] is every uh Eclipse you know some type
[5:21] of sign will maybe but as far as for the
[5:24] Rapture you know we don't I don't
[5:25] personally see that in the scripture of
[5:28] course I'm open to correction by God's
[5:29] Grace but what I feel like is it's a lot
[5:31] of a fear-mongering on YouTube or you
[5:35] name it Instagram or whatever it is X
[5:37] you know a lot of people get all sred up
[5:39] and then after it happens well what
[5:41] happens to those people they just keep
[5:42] going on telling lies and trying to get
[5:44] bait clips and whatever they call it uh
[5:47] but at some point it's going to it's
[5:48] going to be real at some point but
[5:50] that's in the tribulation period that's
[5:51] what I showed you I think I think seven
[5:53] or eight scripture was even after I
[5:54] think I went off the live stream I went
[5:55] and I just typed in while we're singing
[5:57] like sun and dark and I found four or
[6:00] five more and it's all speaks of the
[6:02] time when uh Jesus Christ comes back
[6:05] speaks of the tribulation period of
[6:07] course speaks of Armageddon by God's
[6:09] grace but sorry to go so long Isaiah
[6:13] 5213 you I'm really looking forward you
[6:15] know to Brother Brian coming for all of
[6:17] you and I'm looking forward to going to
[6:18] brother cams I'm going to share some of
[6:20] our testimonies you know uh that God's
[6:22] done this last year because I don't
[6:23] think I've been to brother cam since
[6:24] last April if I'm not mistaken it's been
[6:26] a whole year it's hard to believe right
[6:29] um so I'm going to you I write down all
[6:30] of our testimonies I'm going to share a
[6:31] lot of those with the Saints try to
[6:33] encourage them by God's grace Hallelujah
[6:35] I know I I love hearing like brother
[6:37] diggs's testimonies he was telling me
[6:38] more when we drove up to the airport and
[6:40] all those were from one Church in London
[6:43] all those testimonies were in one church
[6:46] so that church has a lot of uh faith for
[6:49] Supernatural uh obviously they're gifted
[6:52] right you know no man can add one cubit
[6:53] to a stature you know uh they have these
[6:56] gifts of faith and uh these expressions
[6:58] of faith and so he he said uh it was
[7:01] just a real blessing to hear all those
[7:02] testimonies there by God's
[7:05] grace Isaiah 52 13 14 15 I'll read
[7:10] 15 um and I'm sorry I'll read 13 and 15
[7:15] we'll just we'll read 14 together okay
[7:17] so it'll be me all of us and then me
[7:19] just to save us we can kind of keep our
[7:21] voices together verse 13 behold my
[7:24] servant shall deal
[7:26] prudently he shall be exalted and
[7:28] extolled and be very high of course this
[7:32] does not come without a price if you
[7:35] want God to honor you there's always a
[7:37] price to pay yes huge Price to Pay
[7:40] Brother Ram said don't never wish you
[7:41] were a prophet because of all the
[7:43] suffering that goes along with it right
[7:46] blessings but also make a mistake
[7:48] there's great punishment especially for
[7:49] preachers now let's read verse 14 1 2 3
[7:53] as many were astonied at thee his Visage
[7:57] was so Mar more more than any man and
[8:01] his form more than the sons of men Now
[8:04] read 15 so shall he sprinkle many
[8:07] nations the Kings shall shut their
[8:09] mouths at him for that which had not
[8:12] been told them shall they see and that
[8:16] which they had not heard shall they
[8:19] consider of course that's speaking of
[8:20] the Gentiles right many nations thank
[8:23] God for the cross Hallelujah remember
[8:24] the cross knocked down the wall there's
[8:26] a great wall between Jew and Gentile the
[8:28] cross of Jesus Christ Christ knocked it
[8:30] down Hallelujah so now we get the
[8:31] blessings amen let's have one more word
[8:33] of prayer Heavenly Father Lord just
[8:35] speak to the people's hearts Lord God
[8:37] we're so encourag from our evangelist
[8:38] brother brother Diggs raising our faith
[8:40] telling us to go look in our go look in
[8:42] our contract Hallelujah and quote the
[8:45] contract make sure the contract's being
[8:47] followed hallelujah thank God for the
[8:49] Bible contract Hallelujah Lord thank you
[8:51] for Spiritual placement as he preach to
[8:53] us and Lord we stand on the word tonight
[8:55] as we look to the word of God strengthen
[8:57] our hearts Lord God and just draw us
[8:59] closer to you we ask it in Jesus
[9:00] Christ's name and everybody say amen God
[9:03] bless you as you being seated praise
[9:09] God so I want to look at this thought
[9:11] here of uh the marred Visage of
[9:15] Christ I'm going to try to watch the
[9:17] time here just because got to preach the
[9:18] next two days as well after
[9:21] today never stops me anyway but I I try
[9:24] to think of it might help by God's grace
[9:27] um we read our text here and we see that
[9:29] just these words I was reading uh or I
[9:31] was I can't remember if I was reading at
[9:33] home I think I was reading at home or
[9:34] somebody preached it and they mentioned
[9:35] this that his face was so
[9:38] marred it didn't even look like a
[9:41] man and you know so this week I was
[9:43] going online looking at face transplants
[9:45] you know that they could never
[9:46] transplant a face until
[9:48] 2005 so for 6,000 years of human history
[9:52] if someone had an awful accident with
[9:53] their face they they were just left with
[9:56] this this image that doesn't it didn't
[9:58] look like a human uh but then starting
[10:01] in 2005 they've been able to do facial
[10:04] transplants and now they got it pretty
[10:05] good I mean it can look really good
[10:07] where you know you can tell maybe it's
[10:10] something's a little different but uh
[10:12] the face looks very normal but before
[10:15] that you know and when I and I I was
[10:17] just shocked by and I thought about
[10:19] showing them tonight but with the kids I
[10:20] thought I better not do that you know I
[10:22] want to have a little bit of wisdom by
[10:24] God's grace but I just loved you know I
[10:26] just love looking at the before and
[10:28] after and I couldn't help but think of
[10:31] Jesus how as he's dying on the cross you
[10:34] would not have been able to know that
[10:35] was a man if you just looked at him
[10:38] because of his face and his form that's
[10:41] what the Bible says here his Visage was
[10:44] so marred more than any man and his form
[10:47] more than the sons of men everybody want
[10:50] you know every what I mean is everybody
[10:52] all humans they want the glory and the
[10:55] uh the rewards of verse 13 right where
[10:58] God will God will exalt you in due
[11:00] season right we all like to know that
[11:02] God's going to exalt you new season but
[11:03] we often forget about the suffering that
[11:06] must come with that Hallelujah and uh no
[11:09] one is exalted as high as Jesus
[11:11] hallelujah praise God Amen no one will
[11:13] ever be exalted he's the only way they
[11:16] can describe it is very high there's no
[11:18] other words to describe how high Jesus
[11:20] will be exalted amen but he he's worthy
[11:24] of that praise God he's worthy because
[11:26] he took the the most uh most awful
[11:30] punishment that could ever be taken you
[11:32] you think about some of the Saints you
[11:33] know the Bible says they were saw aunder
[11:36] remember in Hebrews 11 cut in half cut
[11:39] in cut in pieces and I hate to be this
[11:42] descriptive that wasn't in my notes you
[11:43] know but I'm just thinking you know
[11:45] whatever Jesus endured was far worse
[11:47] than any person's ever endured now
[11:50] remember Paul was whipped five times
[11:52] Jesus once but that it seems like Paul
[11:54] would just be whipped and then let go
[11:56] but Jesus was compounded everything was
[11:59] compounded for that whole morning of
[12:01] abuse you know leading up to the ninth
[12:03] hour when he finally gave up the
[12:05] ghost uh after three hours of suffering
[12:08] there on the cross with the the sun had
[12:09] turned off its light think of that think
[12:11] about that God was God turned off all
[12:13] the light showing I'm putting all this
[12:15] Blackness on my son I'm putting all
[12:18] bride of Christ fellowships on sins on
[12:20] my son the sins of the whole world and
[12:23] God said I'm turning off the light to
[12:25] show this is what sin looks like sin sin
[12:28] is so dark sin is so black and then the
[12:30] one that is going on you can't even tell
[12:32] that's a human
[12:34] being God was going to prove to us all
[12:37] what sin was but also what love was amen
[12:40] hallelujah praise God he showed us what
[12:42] real Sin looked like and then he showed
[12:44] us what love look like hallelujah we're
[12:47] thankful for the love of Jesus Christ
[12:48] amen I can't preach one of these
[12:50] services without showing the three
[12:51] things brother brandom said Calvary
[12:53] means to US every year you're going to
[12:54] hear me say that I think I started that
[12:56] in 2017 well just just going to keep
[12:58] continuing as long as God terries it
[13:00] settled the sin question amen Satan's
[13:03] power was broken amen and we in return
[13:07] now we do the works of Christ amen
[13:10] hallelujah and were even given power to
[13:13] impart eternal life I remember when
[13:15] brother Simon prayed for brother amen
[13:17] and he got the Holy Ghost you know he
[13:18] felt that warm hand on his back you know
[13:21] that that God by his grace allows us to
[13:24] impart eternal life to others hallelujah
[13:27] praise God what a privilege amen amen
[13:30] may God help us to live so close to God
[13:32] that eternal life can be imparted
[13:34] hallelujah amen to those that are
[13:35] hungering for eternal life hallelujah oh
[13:38] and I forgot that's right brother
[13:39] Simon's going to be ordained Sunday as a
[13:41] minister he's never been ordained all
[13:42] these years and so cam asked me what I
[13:44] thought and I was like oh of course you
[13:46] know look at the fruit you know right
[13:47] here right here is the fruit of brother
[13:49] Simon's Ministry and me you know he and
[13:51] my life my my testimony so uh I forgot
[13:55] to let you know about that Saint so I'm
[13:56] sorry about that hopefully cam told him
[13:58] if not and Hope hopefully Simon doesn't
[13:59] listen to the sermon he's going to get a
[14:01] happy happy surprise but um you know
[14:05] we're just thankful for you know uh God
[14:07] using each person's gift praise God
[14:09] whatever God's called you to be do it
[14:11] with all your heart praise God the Bible
[14:13] said do it with everything that you got
[14:14] Hallelujah but we're thankful for these
[14:16] three works of of Calvary Hallelujah I
[14:20] like how brother bam kind of just
[14:21] summarized it in those three settles the
[14:23] same question Satan's power is broken
[14:25] over our lives and then we do the works
[14:27] of Christ amen now what is Jesus's blood
[14:30] done this is again a little bit of
[14:31] review I there's this little section in
[14:33] this book I have where it talks about
[14:35] the Feast of Israel and it goes through
[14:38] all that the blood of Jesus Christ did
[14:39] so the day of atonement was the one day
[14:42] of the year in September usually when
[14:44] Israel uh would would sacrifice the Two
[14:47] Goats you know had the escape goat and
[14:50] the Goat that died and all the sins of
[14:52] the whole year would be forgiven in one
[14:54] day think about that everything all the
[14:57] sins of the whole year would be just
[14:59] done away within one day and the nation
[15:01] from that from that day they could
[15:02] rejoice and then they break into the
[15:04] next Feast the Feast of Tabernacles the
[15:06] Millennium amen hallelujah praise God
[15:08] that's what it does right Jesus's blood
[15:10] forgives us and we feel like we entered
[15:12] into a place of rest amen the soul has
[15:14] rested Hallelujah the soul is resting
[15:18] that's what brother Ram said the whole
[15:19] Christian walk he said is resting on the
[15:21] Promises of God Amen in the soul praise
[15:24] God of course we'll battle in our minds
[15:26] every day seem like the battle never
[15:27] stops right but if we can overcome the
[15:30] Mind battles we can rest in our soul
[15:32] Hallelujah and we can have the peace of
[15:35] God that passes all understanding amen
[15:37] like I was listening to brother Dennis's
[15:39] sermon from uh Napoleon last week or I'm
[15:42] sorry today I was listening to it from a
[15:43] few weeks ago and he used that scripture
[15:45] God promises if we keep him in mind
[15:48] he'll keep us in perfect peace amen what
[15:51] a promise I mean we we have the ability
[15:54] to walk in total peace every day as long
[15:56] as we keep our hearts on Jesus amen amen
[15:59] how important it is to keep our minds on
[16:01] the Lord hallelujah that we can walk in
[16:03] the peace of God of course it's not easy
[16:05] it is called the greatest battle ever
[16:07] fault because Satan knows how to how to
[16:09] uh he knows how to battle us he studies
[16:11] us his demons study us right all
[16:13] throughout the day he's like a roaring
[16:15] lion seeking whom he may devour and he
[16:17] makes his attractions more attractive
[16:20] all the time right to try to trick us
[16:23] but we got to stand with the blood of
[16:25] Jesus Christ Hallelujah we got to stand
[16:27] by the Holy Spirit and cast out anything
[16:29] that exalts itself against the word of
[16:31] God hallelujah amen I just reminded of
[16:34] this power the blood of Jesus Christ it
[16:36] lists about 13 things and I'm just going
[16:38] to go through them quickly the blood of
[16:40] Jesus Christ justifies you it declares
[16:43] you
[16:45] righteous we have communion through the
[16:48] blood of Jesus Christ that means you can
[16:49] talk to God because of the
[16:52] blood we have Redemption which is buying
[16:55] you back from a market I looked it up
[16:56] yester or today buying you back from
[16:58] from a slave market you are purchased
[17:01] out of the slave market amen I'm no
[17:04] longer a slave anymore Hallelujah I'm a
[17:06] Child of God Amen you can say I'm not in
[17:09] the slave market anymore with those
[17:11] other slaves I'm a slave to Christ now
[17:14] amen I'm a prisoner so sometimes this is
[17:16] very helpful to remember remember the
[17:18] Bible said both Paul and Peter said stir
[17:20] up their pure Minds by way of remance
[17:23] amen
[17:24] amen also Ephesians 2:13 says you have
[17:28] access to the presence of God through
[17:30] the blood amen we can know today when we
[17:33] pray we've confessed all our sins we can
[17:35] know for sure that we can go right to
[17:38] the holiest of holies and God hears our
[17:41] prayers next we have reconciliation
[17:44] through the blood Colossians 1:14 and
[17:46] Colossians 1:20 reconciliation so that
[17:49] means two parties that were uh out of
[17:52] Fellowship are now back in
[17:54] Fellowship Hallelujah in other words
[17:56] we're not fighting against God
[17:58] hallelujah we have communion with God
[18:00] we're not in a spot where we don't hear
[18:01] from God we always hear from God Amen we
[18:04] constantly hear from God hallelujah he's
[18:06] telling us how to walk he's telling us
[18:08] how to live Hallelujah he's speaking his
[18:10] love secrets to us hallelujah amen
[18:15] amen next we have remission or pardon
[18:18] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[18:20] Hebrews 9:22 the remission of sins he
[18:23] sends your sins away Hallelujah your
[18:25] sins don't lie at your door like they
[18:27] did Cain right hallelujah praise God the
[18:30] sins are not at your door the sins are
[18:32] in the sea of God's forgetfulness praise
[18:34] God GL how many was it seven miles under
[18:37] the sea seven miles under the water Amen
[18:40] to the very lowest of the lowest spot
[18:43] that's where God places your sins and
[18:45] the devil can't bring them up hallelujah
[18:47] amen brother ra said for the devil to
[18:49] bring him up he'd have to get buried and
[18:51] and baptized in the blood of Christ the
[18:52] same Hallelujah and we know he won't do
[18:55] that praise God Amen cuz remember the
[18:57] Bible said he that overcomes he takes

[22:13] the spirit of God through the blood of
[22:15] Christ is each day going to cleanse our
[22:17] minds you know Paul said I Die daily not

[22:30] that sin nature would resurrect he's got

[25:30] Hallelujah we also have a propit by the
[25:33] blood I love that word it's the wratht
[25:34] taker we have someone who's taken our
[25:37] wrath through the blood in other words

[25:58] room of God I accept their prayers I

[26:03] alms fast and pray God's God's angels
[26:06] build memorials in heaven to us amen
[26:09] amen or for us they build they the
[26:11] Angels build memorials for us in memory
[26:14] of us just like
[26:16] Cornelius that encourages me praise God

[26:27] arms whatever it is I've got some
[26:30] Memorial up there in heaven praise
[26:32] God
[26:35] hallelujah and we have a pritu through
[26:38] the blood Jesus became the wratht taker
[26:40] he took God's Wrath against us and put
[26:43] it on
[26:44] Christ and then we are Overcomers by the
[26:46] blood of the lamb and the word of Our
[26:49] Testimony that's actually speaking to to
[26:51] the 144,000 in context but what if we
[26:54] look there then at Revelation 2 and 3 we
[26:57] see the Gentile Church were to overcome
[26:59] as well right Hallelujah and so we see
[27:02] it's the same idea the 144,000 are going
[27:04] to get the Holy Ghost too they're going
[27:06] to get the sealed of the Holy Ghost
[27:07] they're going to a nation's going to be
[27:09] born in one day amen let me just drop
[27:12] this in here my wife and I were talking
[27:13] about Israel you know not all Israel is
[27:16] Israel so even in the war with Israel
[27:19] and go and Hamas we've heard that Israel
[27:22] has done some things that maybe weren't
[27:24] right on purpose well that's because not
[27:26] all of them are saved right not all of
[27:29] them are
[27:30] blinded right so we got to keep that in
[27:34] mind and there's only going to be 1%
[27:36] last time I looked up their population
[27:38] 144,000 was like 1% of the population
[27:41] only 1% of that population is going to
[27:43] be justified and Sanctified and ready to
[27:46] be born again that's a very small number
[27:49] that means 99 are not that's a big
[27:51] portion kind of like akan right we we
[27:54] got less than 1% here we got less than
[27:56] less than one tenth of 1%
[27:59] but there's going to be a small Remnant
[28:01] praise God you have to remember that but
[28:03] each one will overcome Satan by the
[28:06] blood of the
[28:08] Lamb see Satan does not like the blood
[28:11] because the blood speaks of a sacrifice
[28:13] that's covered all his
[28:16] accusations remember it's it's a battle
[28:18] of Rights each one of us are a house
[28:21] Jesus tells us in Matthew 12 right and
[28:23] if we open up our our our minds to evil
[28:26] spirits Satan can come and build a
[28:28] complex or a castle in our
[28:30] houses he's got a right
[28:32] there and the only way to get him out is
[28:35] to say I don't want this anymore forgive
[28:37] me Jesus let your spirit come in and
[28:40] clean me out amen which is basically
[28:42] saying I'm letting the blood in praise
[28:44] God Satan no longer has a right here
[28:47] Jesus died to set me free Jesus died to
[28:50] pay for that sin and forgive me
[28:53] Hallelujah and take that away and then
[28:55] fill my house with good things
[28:57] Hallelujah
[28:58] amen filled with love and joy and peace
[29:00] and longsuffering and gentleness and
[29:03] self-control
[29:04] Hallelujah all the fruits of the Holy
[29:06] Spirit he wants to fill our houses with
[29:09] all the good things of God
[29:12] Amen so that's a little review there now
[29:14] let's get to this back to this marred
[29:15] Visage here by God's grace I just can't
[29:18] help that I just every year I think of
[29:19] Good Friday what a glorious day it is
[29:22] hallelujah now John Gil he was a
[29:24] preacher in the 1800s a faithful man of
[29:26] God brother man mentioned him in the
[29:28] church age book he said the greatest
[29:30] preaching and writing came from uh the
[29:32] Philadelphian Church age John Gil said
[29:35] his Visions V I can never say that word
[29:37] his Visage was so marred more than any
[29:40] man and his form more than the sons of
[29:42] men though fairer than the children of
[29:44] men as he was the immediate workmanship
[29:46] of the Divine spirit so he must have
[29:48] been a beautiful
[29:49] baby right but then we know as he got
[29:51] older the the Pharisees said you not
[29:53] even 50 so he looked older and the and
[29:57] the and the Bible say a Man of
[30:00] Sorrows right so all the effects of
[30:03] casting out all the evil spirits the
[30:05] labor of getting up you know all H
[30:07] having prayer services and getting up
[30:09] early to go pray all that had taken an
[30:11] impact on him and the Bible said he had
[30:12] no beauty that we would desire
[30:14] him so he was low on sleep physically
[30:18] tired at times fasting often to cast out
[30:22] Devils you know he he didn't look like a
[30:25] but he was born beautiful he would have
[30:26] been because he was he was a Son of
[30:29] God so that's what that's the point John
[30:31] Gil's
[30:32] making he said but his griefs and
[30:36] Sorrows he bore and the troubles he was
[30:38] met with with the watchings and the
[30:41] fastings with laborous preaching
[30:43] constant traveling about to do good with
[30:46] what sweat and blood with buffetings and
[30:48] scourgings never was any man's face more
[30:51] marred or his form more altered than his
[30:55] was now you've heard it too with the
[30:57] cross your shoulders go out of joint and
[31:00] so his shoulders look really really
[31:04] gross right and then he was stripped
[31:06] naked whipped down you know we'll get to
[31:09] these scriptures in just a
[31:10] moment he was beautiful at Birth but as
[31:13] the effects of the ministry so he was
[31:14] look he was probably looking really good
[31:16] till about 30 you know then he started
[31:18] his ministry around 30 that's when all
[31:19] the suffering
[31:24] happened now look at Psalm 226 there
[31:27] okay if you would Psalm
[31:30] 22:6 again I was going to put a picture
[31:32] up here of this but I thought well it
[31:33] might be too tough on the
[31:38] children look what the scripture says
[31:41] David was writing by the Holy
[31:43] Spirit and he said but I am a worm and
[31:47] no
[31:48] man now picture of earthworm and as I
[31:51] was studying this I was listening to
[31:52] this I was walking in school and it was
[31:54] raining the other day and there was
[31:54] worms all around me I thought well
[31:56] that's another sign maybe I'm supposed
[31:57] to preach this
[31:59] Jesus Jesus inspired David to sayi am a
[32:02] worm I'm not even a man a reproach of
[32:06] men and despise of the people even his
[32:08] own Shepherd I'm sorry even his own
[32:10] sheep scattered from him the
[32:15] shepherd now in the Hebrew this word
[32:17] worm it means
[32:20] maggot or grub or worm now we got
[32:24] chickens and they dig up the grubs
[32:26] right they're they're pretty good at it
[32:30] that's what they're made to do but Jesus
[32:32] was made to Humble himself where when he
[32:35] was at the cross before he said it was
[32:37] finished he looked not even like a man
[32:40] more like a
[32:41] worm now I looked at some microscopic
[32:43] pictures of worm faces probably don't
[32:45] want to see them the kids they got some
[32:47] really strange
[32:50] faces but Jesus you imagine so you know
[32:53] I could have put some pictures up here
[32:54] imagine no the nose wasn't there you
[32:56] know these the distinct ly human
[32:58] elements of Christ were not noticeable
[33:01] his body was mangled and twisted you
[33:03] know uh bones out of joint or I'm sorry
[33:06] yeah bones out of joint no doubt about
[33:07] it now none none of the bones were
[33:11] broken but this is the this is the
[33:14] closest thing the Holy Spirit would give
[33:17] us to try to picture Calvary so now when
[33:19] after we've seen Mel Gibson's movie that
[33:22] that's not even that's not even a tenth
[33:24] of what Jesus would have looked like
[33:26] because you could still you could still
[33:27] tell he was a
[33:28] man right how many you seen that I've
[33:31] seen
[33:32] that and you know he still looks kind of
[33:34] like a man you know they're swelling and
[33:36] everything but it was so awful the Bible
[33:39] said his Visage was marred more than any
[33:41] other man so they took extra time when
[33:44] they're beating him they took extra time
[33:46] to hit his face on
[33:49] purpose right because face is the most
[33:51] important part of a
[33:52] person right it's just like it's like
[33:55] speaking against God right they they
[33:57] speak they BL asking God's name it's
[33:58] like uh rejecting him and saying it
[34:01] right to his face right the most one of
[34:03] the most disrespectful things in the
[34:04] Bible was spitting in someone's face
[34:07] remember they had laws about that if
[34:08] certain people dis disrespected others
[34:11] they could actually spit in their faces
[34:13] it's one of the worst things uh you
[34:14] could possibly do to disrespect somebody
[34:17] because face represents the presence of
[34:19] that
[34:20] person and so Jesus became as a worm
[34:24] like a worm more like a worm than a man
[34:32] scoffield said this uh CI scoffield the
[34:35] literal rendering is terrible so marred
[34:38] from the form of man was his aspect that
[34:40] his appearance was not that of a son of
[34:43] man not
[34:45] human the effect of the brutalities
[34:47] described in the
[34:49] gospels so these Roman soldiers were so
[34:52] brutal with him he didn't even look like
[34:55] a man it didn't look like a son of a man
[34:57] or son a man a human being that's how
[35:00] awful it was now remember Church Jesus
[35:02] knew the whole time he was going to
[35:05] this he tried to tell the disciples I've
[35:07] got to go to Jerusalem and I've got to
[35:08] be crucified and they're like oh you're
[35:10] not going to die Jesus he said get
[35:11] behind me Satan he wasn't playing around
[35:13] he wasn't laughing he's like I know what
[35:15] I've got to suffer I know the scripture
[35:17] I am the scripture he knew
[35:20] this he knew he'd have to
[35:23] suffer he wasn't oblivious to this
[35:26] that's why he begged God take this cup
[35:28] from me if it's
[35:30] possible sometimes church we want God to
[35:32] take all of our trials away it might be
[35:34] forming us into what he wants us to be
[35:36] as we heard on last
[35:39] weekend
[35:44] right it's uh it's the scripture you
[35:47] know I I never thought about these
[35:48] scriptures but as I was I heard that I
[35:49] just started thinking my that's right
[35:50] that's right that that that that all
[35:52] these things he didn't even look like a
[35:54] man now if you got your Bible Well case
[35:56] you can put up there Isa Isaiah
[36:03] 50:6 uh Isaiah 50:6 notice I gave my
[36:07] back to the smiters he didn't hide his
[36:09] back he didn't try to run from it he
[36:11] gave himself up for it he he accepted it
[36:13] willingly why for you and I amen praise
[36:16] God he didn't run from the Abus abuse he
[36:19] gave himself to the abuse so that we
[36:22] could be free from abuse praise
[36:25] God and I gave my my cheeks to them that
[36:28] plucked off the
[36:31] hair so remember Ezra did that Ezra
[36:34] Nehemiah they were pulling out
[36:36] beards but Jesus let himself totally
[36:39] just let the people pull out the
[36:42] hair I hid not my face from shame and
[36:45] spitting how many of those soldiers just
[36:47] spit right in his face the the Pharisees
[36:49] right the at the Sanhedrin Council he
[36:51] just gave
[36:53] himself and he knew what he was doing he
[36:56] was taking a upon himself Church the
[36:58] sins of the whole
[37:01] world
[37:03] Hallelujah Isaiah 532 would go 2 three 4
[37:07] and five let's remember Calvary
[37:09] Hallelujah let's remember Jesus's death
[37:11] till he
[37:13] comes for he shall grow up before him as
[37:16] a tender plant and as a root out of a
[37:17] dry ground he ha no form nor kindliness
[37:20] and when we shall see him there's no
[37:22] beauty that we would desire I'm just
[37:23] speaking of the res the crucifixion
[37:25] right because he would have been a
[37:26] beautiful baby verse three
[37:28] he's despised and rejected a man a man
[37:30] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[37:32] we hid as it were our faces from him he
[37:35] was despised and we esteemed him not
[37:37] verse five or four sorry surely a bore
[37:41] our griefs amen hallelujah amen and
[37:44] carried our sorrows remember uh three
[37:45] years ago I preached on God's receipt

[40:29] had on his back they took it off they
[40:30] beat him to a post what was it that was
[40:33] a true Royal Seed of
[40:36] Abraham so his ribs were actually now
[40:39] the passion did a good job on that his
[40:41] he could look down and he could see his
[40:42] ribs and no doubt uh maybe some other
[40:45] bones his bones were staring at him his
[40:48] tongue is cleaving to his jaw he doesn't
[40:52] even look like a

[41:15] and my bones are burned as in hear verse
[41:17] four my heart is smitten and withered
[41:20] like grass so I forget to eat my bread
[41:22] verse five by reason the voice of my
[41:25] groaning my bones cleave to my skin this
[41:29] was just an an awful condition where the
[41:31] bones are being exposed right he's been
[41:35] beaten all over his back but no doubt
[41:37] they would have missed a couple times
[41:38] like they showed in the movie and they
[41:39] would have got all
[41:41] this open and exposed and that's what
[41:44] the Lord suffered for you and I
[41:47] hallelujah thank you

[42:14] that the blessing could be poured out
[42:15] upon us praise God Amen that's a God
[42:19] I'll serve hallelujah praise God
[42:23] Amen so we see Jesus in this great
[42:27] sacrifice that he gave
[42:29] Hallelujah I want to read what brother
[42:30] Ram said in blind Bard andus he's
[42:33] talking about Jesus on the day he was
[42:36] crucified on his mind he knew that he
[42:38] was going to Calvary up that road on
[42:40] that road he knowed he was going to
[42:42] Gethsemane he was going to pil judgment
[42:43] Hall he was to be beat and mocked and
[42:46] then his great gifts of God was to be
[42:47] put at
[42:49] trial so he knew he was going to a court
[42:51] trial going to put a rag around his head
[42:53] and smack him on the head and say now if
[42:56] you know all that's in the people's
[42:57] hearts and minds tell me you hit you and
[42:59] all these things faced him he knew that
[43:01] was going to
[43:02] happen brother R said a quivering
[43:05] bittering death there he had to face a
[43:08] quivering bittering
[43:11] death he knew also hanging in his mind
[43:14] here that he was going up to have his
[43:16] hands placed around a pole his clothes
[43:18] stripped off him and lashes that would
[43:21] burn Plum into the bone was going around
[43:24] him and his blood would bathe his sides
[43:27] and a cruel thorn crown would be placed
[43:30] on his head and he'd be nailed to a
[43:32] cross and hang there bleeding bleeding
[43:34] dying as the most bloody sacrifice was
[43:37] ever offered in the
[43:39] world and remember uh David wrote about
[43:43] this a thousand years before the or 1500
[43:46] years before the Romans even invented
[43:49] crucifixion it was I mean prophecy again
[43:52] proves that God is real praise
[43:56] God
[43:59] and all of that confronting him and he's
[44:01] walking I can see him in his air of
[44:05] quietness because he's thinking about it
[44:07] brother say he's quiet as he walked
[44:09] straight and the disciples going on
[44:11] putting the people off the road so
[44:13] remember let's just recall that he was
[44:15] the bloodiest sacrifice he had to been a
[44:18] burnt offering out of the out of the
[44:20] five old testment offerings he had to
[44:22] been the Burt one because he gave his
[44:24] entire being away to God H Allelujah he
[44:28] gave everything he poured out everything
[44:30] absolutely everything was given to God
[44:33] as a sacrifice for
[44:35] us then brother Ram says this and uh and
[44:39] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[44:44] enemies brother R talks about him being
[44:46] accused in the
[44:48] courtyard he said the only thing they
[44:50] found against him was breaking the
[44:51] Sabbath day but he said I'm the lord of
[44:53] the Sabbath and he was and he they said
[44:57] he's making himself God but he was God
[44:59] Amen
[45:01] Hallelujah and there are all those false
[45:04] accusing and things and false Witnesses
[45:06] they had against him finally beaten with
[45:09] a big lash till his ribs was showing
[45:11] through and the little robe he had on
[45:13] his back they took it off beat him to a
[45:14] post what was it that was the true Royal
[45:17] seat of Abraham that's where we stand
[45:19] tonight my faith is built on nothing
[45:22] less than Jesus blood and
[45:24] righteousness when all around my soul
[45:27] gives way then he is All My Hope and
[45:29] stay amen when I lose all hope or I get
[45:32] discouraged I've got one place to go
[45:35] there's only one place I need to go
[45:36] that's the calvary praise
[45:39] God on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[45:42] other grounds is sinking sand that's
[45:45] where I take my hope right there on that
[45:48] Solid
[45:49] Rock What's My Hope For The Rapture the
[45:52] cross
[45:54] amen how do I believe I'm going to go in
[45:56] the rapture because I've been to Calvary
[45:58] amen amen I appreciate what he did at
[46:00] Calvary and that is impacting my life
[46:02] right now praise God Amen as the Bible
[46:05] said in Romans I church we are walking
[46:08] in the newness of life because of the
[46:11] cross of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the see
[46:14] the cross doesn't impact these mega
[46:16] churches I'm talking about like
[46:17] denominational mega churches it doesn't
[46:19] impact them their lives don't change
[46:21] very much just to a religious form but
[46:24] the soul the Nature has not changed
[46:26] Hallelujah
[46:27] but our nature is changed
[46:30] Hallelujah we don't have an unbelief
[46:32] nature well the Bible says a woman
[46:33] shouldn't cut her hair well that's just
[46:34] for the that was just for the old days
[46:36] we've got a nature of we believe the
[46:38] word hallelujah just one simple example
[46:41] there's 110 examples I came up with I
[46:44] asked Cam and Simon can you get me a
[46:46] more list there I like I like a bigger
[46:48] list one of these days I'll do that by
[46:50] God's
[46:51] grace now I love this brother R breaks
[46:54] into this thought of Jesus he was
[46:56] Abraham seed he possessed every
[47:01] gate even to death and
[47:05] hell I want you to see what he says here
[47:09] see him there had a mockery now he
[47:11] doesn't say the word but a mockery gate
[47:14] that woman trying to wash his feet again
[47:15] put a rag over his face and said if
[47:17] you're a prophet tell us who hit you and
[47:19] we'll believe you and on the cross they
[47:21] said if you're the Son of God come down
[47:23] and we we'll believe you they wouldn't
[47:25] believe him anyhow no matter what he
[47:26] done he didn't mind them so brother
[47:30] Braham says here Jesus had the possessed
[47:32] the Gate of
[47:33] mockery and sometimes we get really sad
[47:36] when we get mocked well I do online they
[47:39] put me in a new video this week I was
[47:40] actually the front and cover one this
[47:42] week I'm like hey I made it to the cover
[47:44] they didn't say much about me but well
[47:46] praise God that's a good sign I ought to
[47:48] leap and dance
[47:50] tonight but brother R said Jesus had to
[47:52] conquer the Gate of death hell but also
[47:55] mockery
[47:57] and we've got to and what the Bible says
[48:00] because we're Abraham's seed we can
[48:02] possess those same Gates Hallelujah the
[48:05] Gate of
[48:06] sickness the Gate of being persecuted or
[48:08] lied
[48:09] on right we can possess every gate
[48:12] because it's already been conquered
[48:14] hallelujah amen he's already conquered
[48:16] it for us we've just got to take the
[48:19] word of God and possess every footstep
[48:21] footsteps our possession and go claim
[48:24] that gate and possess that gate
[48:26] Hallelujah amen
[48:29] amen so what do he have to do to do that
[48:31] he had to love the mockers he had to
[48:33] ignore them and not curse
[48:35] them right that's how he overcame the
[48:37] Gate of being mocked that's
[48:40] right I love this quote I preached this
[48:42] a while ago but I'm going to read it
[48:43] again the infallible word of God 1956
[48:46] brother Bram said Jesus had finished it
[48:48] everything was completed Jesus would
[48:51] have not sat down in heaven if it had
[48:53] not have the completed the work no no
[48:56] man sits down until his job is over
[48:58] that's
[48:59] right he said and Jesus took his blood
[49:03] and went through the heavens of heaven
[49:05] and condemned every devil took the keys
[49:08] of death and hell and then he sat down
[49:11] in
[49:12] heaven amen I love this quote praise God
[49:16] hallelujah brother Ram said on his way
[49:18] down remember today he would already
[49:19] been crucified because it's already 7
[49:21] it's almost 8:00 he died he would have
[49:24] died at the 9th hour so that would have
[49:26] been 3:00 he would have died 300
[49:32] p.m. but here he would have after he
[49:34] died he dismissed his Spirit at some
[49:37] point after that the Bible said his
[49:39] Spirit went down and it preached to
[49:41] souls that were in
[49:43] prison but brother Ram said as he went
[49:46] down he condemned every devil on the way
[49:50] down so I can see Jesus remember I have
[49:53] this list of evil spirits I did when I
[49:54] preached the doctrines of devils I had a
[49:55] list of evil spirits
[49:57] Jesus condemned the devil of
[50:00] divination the famili The Familiar lying
[50:03] Spirit he condemned that devil he
[50:06] condemned
[50:09] jealousy he condemned lying because he
[50:12] always told the truth amen
[50:14] hallelujah he condemned that perverse
[50:16] spirit because he always did what was
[50:18] right he always walked upright praise
[50:20] God that's why I believe a lot of these
[50:22] false doctrines are there perverse demon
[50:24] Spirits perverting the right way and
[50:27] going the false way he condemned now
[50:30] this one we got to watch out too he
[50:31] condemned that hoty Spirit of Pride
[50:34] that's one I think it impacts us most in
[50:36] America I mean me too
[50:39] right he condemned that because he was
[50:42] always humble praise God he possessed
[50:45] the gates of his enemies hallelujah
[50:48] praise God there's no prideful devil
[50:49] that say well I got I cause you to sin I
[50:52] cause you to sin no he said I overcame
[50:54] and I've got I've got blood fresh up
[50:56] there on the on the cross Hallelujah and
[50:58] I paid the price for this and I'm coming
[51:00] down to get the keys of death and Hell
[51:02] Hallelujah and nobody can stop me
[51:05] amen because I possess I'm possessing
[51:08] every gate none of you could cause me to
[51:10] fall none of you have the right to stop
[51:12] me I can do whatever I please because
[51:14] I'm the Virgin born son of God
[51:16] hallelujah amen didn't have the sin
[51:18] nature Hallelujah just had a body
[51:21] likened under sin the Bible says because
[51:24] it could die it could get tired as we
[51:25] said it could be beaten but he never
[51:28] sinned he never had the sin
[51:30] nature he condemned the spirit of
[51:32] heaviness like depression that's what
[51:34] depression is he condemned that Spirit
[51:37] Hallelujah he condemned the spirit of
[51:39] whoredoms right lust of the eyes lust of
[51:42] the flesh he condemned that and he never
[51:45] had evil thoughts he never went to a
[51:47] evil club or anything like that or any
[51:48] Evil movies right or anything like that
[51:50] he condemned that he was pure
[51:53] Hallelujah he condemned the spirit of
[51:56] infirm ity the deaf and dumb Spirit he
[51:59] condemned the spirit of fear he
[52:01] condemned the seducing Spirit he
[52:03] condemned the spirit of air he condemned
[52:05] the Spirit of Slumber spiritual
[52:07] blindness he condemned every unclean and
[52:10] foul Spirit he condemned the spirit of
[52:13] bondage he condemned the spirit of the
[52:14] world and he condemned the spirit of the
[52:16] Antichrist amen that's a mighty
[52:19] conqueror church amen hallelujah and he
[52:21] rose and he gave you the right to
[52:23] conquer those Gates as well praise God

[52:28] Jesus Christ because of the blood of
[52:30] Jesus Christ I have the right to be free

[52:34] conquer this battle and I can overcome I
[52:37] can get past this I can overcome this

[52:58] it's such a tremendous blessing praise
[53:00] God what can we do church we can possess
[53:02] the

[53:10] ground I can't be a better Christian no
[53:12] you can possess those
[53:14] Gates you can be like Jaz Saints and you
[53:17] can possess more ground
[53:18] amen you can be faithful over more areas
[53:22] of your life how many want to do that by
[53:23] God's grace
[53:25] am
[53:28] brother
[53:30] random he said that day on Calvary he
[53:32] saidthe sinful world had a blackout the
[53:35] sun went down in the middle of the day
[53:36] it had a nervous prostration The Rock
[53:38] shook the graves rent and the dead
[53:40] bodies bursted from the grave what did
[53:42] do god zeroed in on Calvary he wounded
[53:46] that animal called Satan
[53:51] forever
[53:52] Hallelujah brother B said now Satan's
[53:55] been more vicious since then because it
[53:57] brought to light to the human race and
[54:00] anyone knows that a wounded animal is
[54:02] its most vicious crawling around with
[54:05] its back
[54:07] broke he said but now Satan was knocked
[54:09] out at Calvary so he's wounded and
[54:12] knocked out the Earth proved that it was
[54:14] the greatest price that was ever paid
[54:16] the one and only that could pay it come
[54:18] and done it at Calvary that's where the
[54:19] great price was paid that's one of the
[54:22] main things about
[54:23] Calvary and the scripture said after
[54:25] Jesus gave gave up the ghost the Bible
[54:27] said that the
[54:29] earthquak the Rocks rent Hallelujah
[54:33] there's such an earthquake and I just
[54:34] had this simple thought you know that
[54:37] was actually a fulfillment of what the
[54:39] Garden of Eden prophecy was the Bible
[54:42] said the seed of the woman will bruise
[54:44] the head of The
[54:45] Serpent and the Bible says Heaven is
[54:48] God's Throne Earth is my foot stool so
[54:51] when Jesus said it was finished it was
[54:53] if as it was if it was as if God took
[54:56] his heal and he crushed the head of the
[54:58] serpent and it caused an earthquake amen
[55:02] hallelujah he crushed it that's where
[55:04] the earthquake came from amen it was the
[55:06] Christ it was God bruising the head of
[55:10] that Serpent and the Bible said because
[55:12] of that Jesus was manifested that he
[55:14] might destroy the works of the devil
[55:17] church and that means and the
[55:20] influence it means to loose you it
[55:23] doesn't mean Satan's dead but it means
[55:25] you're loose from his powers hallelujah
[55:29] amen you're loose from the is it Venom
[55:31] or what is that what a snake has venom I
[55:33] always get that mixed up venom and
[55:34] poison I get those mixed up Mali
[55:36] corrected me on that years ago but I
[55:37] forgot but it looses us from that the
[55:40] effects of the Venom from the the bite
[55:42] of the serpent we all had it in us but
[55:45] when when Jesus died he crushed that and
[55:47] he says if you believe on me if you
[55:49] confess your sins I'll heal that Venom
[55:52] I'll heal that bite praise God
[55:54] hallelujah and the life of God the life
[55:55] of the Lamb will come into us hallelujah
[55:58] amen
[56:00] amen for this purpose the Son of God was
[56:02] manifested that he might destroy the
[56:05] works of the devil
[56:08] hallelujah what a promise Church what a
[56:10] promise so Satan is more Vicious he's
[56:15] wounded right brother B says he's like a
[56:17] lion without teeth he'll just roar at
[56:19] you but it gets pretty loud and the
[56:21] church said sometimes he Roars like
[56:23] you're going to die or this going to
[56:24] this awful what's going to happen next
[56:25] year with the election or this year or
[56:27] you know how close we going to get in
[56:30] the squeeze you know to uh to any
[56:32] suffering you know he tries to he tries
[56:35] to be more vicious but we've got an
[56:37] overcoming power tonight amen hallelujah
[56:42] if we keep our mind stayed on Christ God
[56:45] will keep us in perfect peace Hallelujah
[56:48] no matter what may come Satan was
[56:51] knocked out at Calvary hallelujah amen
[56:55] thank God
[56:57] it's 8:00 already my
[57:01] goodness so Jesus was
[57:05] marred in such a way that we could be
[57:09] spotless right he was totally ripped up
[57:14] mangled disfigured so we could be a
[57:18] spotless
[57:19] woman Hallelujah he was covered in his
[57:22] own blood with his bones staring at him
[57:26] look like a worm he was made to look
[57:28] like a worm a bloody beaten worm
[57:31] disfigured so we could look like a
[57:32] beautiful clean white uh purified Bride
[57:36] on her wedding day like brother Austin
[57:38] and sister Lena last year Hallelujah
[57:41] Lena was a picture of what Christ does
[57:44] for us amen
[57:48] hallelujah but it it it it wasn't what
[57:51] we did it was what Christ did hallelujah
[57:53] amen and this m church this is a gift
[57:57] hallelujah salvation is a gift
[58:00] Hallelujah but he did it because of his
[58:03] love for you and I hallelujah amen he
[58:06] did it for the joy that was set before
[58:08] him remember that was his
[58:11] people the Bible said he washes us
[58:13] Ephesians 5:27 that he might present to
[58:16] himself a glorious church not having
[58:19] spot nor or wrinkle or any such thing
[58:22] think about that I'm I'm always
[58:23] interested and I I don't want any
[58:25] wrinkles in my shirt that's that's why I
[58:26] take them to the dry cleaner my wife
[58:28] kind of rolls her eyes you know well I I
[58:30] work around a lot of rich people you
[58:31] know so I don't want to look like I'm
[58:32] you know I guess I got these
[58:35] complexes but Jesus was beaten and
[58:38] bloodied and bruised to make his bride
[58:41] where there's not even one Wrinkle in
[58:43] her clothes in her
[58:45] dress there's no spots there's not even
[58:48] one stain amen totally pure praise God
[58:52] or any such thing amen any bad thing
[58:54] that that happen to your laund Tre a
[58:56] hole sometimes they go to school they
[58:58] got holes in it they ask Mr Smith why do
[58:59] you got holes in your sweat sweater I'm
[59:00] like I didn't look I don't know I'm
[59:02] sorry that's my fault I just have holes
[59:04] I don't even see him but not Jesus bride
[59:07] there's no such thing she's completely
[59:09] purified she's completely dressed for
[59:12] the occasion because Jesus dressed her
[59:14] hallelujah amen amen
[59:18] right he said but that she should be
[59:20] holy and without
[59:23] blemish so he was Mo
[59:26] that you might be
[59:28] pure he was disfigured so you might be
[59:31] in the right
[59:33] figure
[59:37] Allelujah
[59:39] now Ephesians 5 shows it from God's
[59:41] perspective right you know so in other
[59:44] words us having no spot or blemish God
[59:47] already sees us as that
[59:51] way right but Peter gives us our
[59:54] perspective because we know our lives
[59:56] are not always without
[59:58] spot
[1:00:00] Hallelujah sometimes we know there's
[1:00:02] spots in our lives that we're guilty of
[1:00:04] we walked in some
[1:00:06] mud so second Peter 3:14 gives us this I
[1:00:10] thought as I was going through the
[1:00:10] scripture I'm like wow that's right God
[1:00:12] sees us as
[1:00:14] perfect but Peter tells now if anybody
[1:00:16] would have been known about being washed
[1:00:19] by Jesus and then defiled right
[1:00:20] afterwards was was Peter Peter said wash
[1:00:23] not just my feet wash all of me amen and
[1:00:26] then a few hours later I don't even know
[1:00:27] I don't even know
[1:00:29] him I don't know him denied him more
[1:00:32] than Judas did right as far as the
[1:00:34] number of times of verbal
[1:00:36] denials but what does Peter say
[1:00:38] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[1:00:40] for such things be diligent that you
[1:00:42] might be found in of him in peace that's
[1:00:45] why we preach on the Christian family
[1:00:47] what's the one thing we want in our home
[1:00:48] well there's three things right
[1:00:49] righteousness joy and peace peace with
[1:00:53] God Amen Hallelujah we got
[1:00:55] reconciliation with God hallelujah have
[1:00:58] peace with God and the only way to have
[1:01:00] that is to keep his
[1:01:03] commands so be diligent that you may be
[1:01:06] found of him in peace without spot and
[1:01:10] blameless but if we go back to the other
[1:01:11] verse he's the one that makes us that
[1:01:13] way he does he will if we let him
[1:01:17] Hallelujah if we'll yield him if we'll
[1:01:19] surrender he'll keep us without spot and
[1:01:22] without blemish and he'll present to
[1:01:24] himself a glorious Church without spot
[1:01:26] or wrinkle
[1:01:30] Hallelujah
[1:01:33] Glory now back to Isaiah 50:6 with this
[1:01:36] thought of being
[1:01:37] marred I gave my back to the smiters and
[1:01:39] my cheeks to them that plucked off there
[1:01:41] look he he just gave his face he just
[1:01:43] gave his face the presence think about
[1:01:45] that you're in the presence of God and
[1:01:47] you strike him you're Creator the one
[1:01:51] who gave you breath the one who gave you
[1:01:52] your lungs and your your nervous system
[1:01:54] and your your oxygen and everything
[1:01:56] everything's working the very one who
[1:01:58] gave it to you you slap him across the
[1:02:00] face but he just gave it go ahead
[1:02:03] because it was a symbol of what we all
[1:02:05] would have
[1:02:06] done right the Bible said all we are
[1:02:09] scattered like sheep right he took upon
[1:02:11] us he took upon himself the sin of the
[1:02:13] whole world we all we all would have
[1:02:16] rejected him we all would have despised
[1:02:18] him he had to pay the penalty for our
[1:02:21] sins and then he says I hid not my face
[1:02:24] from shame and spit
[1:02:26] so God wanted to show the whole world
[1:02:30] that he was willing to take all the
[1:02:31] brunt all the punishment he was willing
[1:02:34] to take all of our shame all of our
[1:02:36] guilt all of our revist words all of our
[1:02:39] Blasphemous words he was to take that in
[1:02:41] the
[1:02:43] face to show his amazing grace to us
[1:02:48] hallelujah remember the Sho bread is
[1:02:50] called the presence of the
[1:02:53] face that was God you know the it's the
[1:02:56] second step of Grace right outer Court
[1:02:58] washing water baptism blood forgiveness
[1:03:00] the second stage you got light from the
[1:03:02] church ages and you got the bread it's
[1:03:04] called the bread of his face in other
[1:03:05] words God I'm going to eat in your
[1:03:06] presence we're going to have Fellowship
[1:03:08] we're going to commune together amen but
[1:03:11] on the cross it was as it was as if
[1:03:14] every person was saying I don't want to
[1:03:15] eat from you I don't want your bread I
[1:03:17] don't want to I don't want anything from
[1:03:19] you I'm totally denying you I'm
[1:03:21] blaspheming you like Paul said I blashe
[1:03:23] you ignorantly the Bible said
[1:03:26] in other words all Humanity was showing
[1:03:28] their disrespect to God and God stood
[1:03:32] there and took it Hallelujah because he
[1:03:34] knew there would be somebody that would
[1:03:35] want his love and his Mercy as well
[1:03:37] praise God
[1:03:39] Amen Hallelujah see we all would have
[1:03:43] rejected the face of
[1:03:46] God and yet he forgives us and invites
[1:03:49] us back to seek his
[1:03:53] face Hallelujah I don't I forgot to pull
[1:03:56] up that scripture from Psalms where the
[1:03:58] Bible said uh you'll seek my face I I
[1:04:01] heard you say Seek my face and hit your
[1:04:03] face Lord I will seek I don't know if
[1:04:05] you can pull that up there somebody
[1:04:06] could find that on their
[1:04:09] phone but this proved all of us you know
[1:04:12] God opened up his face and that was the
[1:04:14] part that was
[1:04:15] unrecognizable you couldn't recognize
[1:04:17] who is that Jesus of Nazareth who is
[1:04:20] this couldn't recognize
[1:04:23] him but see he took that in his face he
[1:04:25] took all of our sin upon his
[1:04:29] face that later he could with his healed
[1:04:33] face with his face transplant Hal should
[1:04:35] I should say face transformation
[1:04:37] hallelujah amen hallelujah with his
[1:04:40] transformation then the Bible said in
[1:04:42] Revelation 223 there shall be no more
[1:04:44] curse but the Throne of God and of the
[1:04:46] Lamb shall be in it and his servant
[1:04:48] Shall Serve him Revelation 22:4 and they
[1:04:51] shall see his face and his name shall be
[1:04:55] in their foreheads amen oh my Hallelujah
[1:04:59] so we get his name here and we get to
[1:05:01] see his face Hallelujah whereas before
[1:05:05] in our sinful life we would have
[1:05:06] disrespected the face of Jesus we would
[1:05:08] have done everything despite to dishonor
[1:05:10] the face but now because of his blood
[1:05:13] now because of his sacrifice now because
[1:05:15] he allows us as brother dig says he
[1:05:17] allows us to touch him ah he made a way
[1:05:20] we could touch him amen he didn't keep
[1:05:23] us from him he invites us into him he
[1:05:25] said come unto me all you that are weary
[1:05:28] and heavy laden and I'll give you rest
[1:05:30] for your souls amen if anybody's weary
[1:05:32] or burdened tonight come to Jesus
[1:05:35] hallelujah amen come talk it over with
[1:05:38] Jesus have some communion look full in
[1:05:40] his wonderful face hallelujah
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:47] hallelujah so because he took all the
[1:05:51] all of the the sin upon his face now his
[1:05:54] face shows us Mercy when we accept his
[1:05:57] forgiveness when we love him and keep
[1:05:59] his commands now his face is changed
[1:06:01] back
[1:06:03] Hallelujah so Saints he became
[1:06:06] unrecognizable so we would be recognized
[1:06:09] praise God the Bible says now children
[1:06:13] we are the children of God hallelujah
[1:06:16] now we are the sons of God the Bible
[1:06:18] says now we're accepted in the Beloved
[1:06:20] in heaven amen
[1:06:23] hallelujah so he had to be unre
[1:06:25] recognizable so that Jesus now knows our
[1:06:28] name
[1:06:30] hallelujah what a blessing Paul speaks
[1:06:33] of it in 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we
[1:06:36] see through a glass Darkly speaking of
[1:06:38] prophecies tongues and visions and all
[1:06:40] these things we're trying our best to
[1:06:41] understand it all but then face to
[1:06:46] face how many looking forward to that
[1:06:48] time praise God Amen like we've heard
[1:06:51] brother Ram say we'll get to ask
[1:06:52] questions to Jesus all of our unanswered
[1:06:54] questions will be answered there
[1:06:57] Hallelujah I imagine a lot of the
[1:06:58] answers will be Lord why'd you allow
[1:07:00] this for your good let me show you how
[1:07:02] it worked out for your good maybe it was
[1:07:04] Generations down the road it turned out
[1:07:07] for your good to your family remember
[1:07:10] like brother di said Abraham died and
[1:07:12] only had a few descendants it wasn't
[1:07:14] like the stars of Heaven he died not
[1:07:16] inheriting the promise yet Glory but
[1:07:20] it's the power of yet God's promise is
[1:07:23] still going to come to pass Hallelujah
[1:07:25] haven't seen it yet but it's going to
[1:07:26] come to pass
[1:07:30] Hallelujah and then shall I

[1:07:36] me now that I'm already known in heaven

[1:07:41] have access in the presence of God God
