[5:34] life amen praise the lord
[5:38] god bless you brother good to see you
[5:40] william
[5:44] let's get into the word i had i was
[5:45] gonna do a song special but there are so
[5:47] many things that
[5:47] this brother just saying my favorite one
[5:49] of my favorite songs ever let it start
[5:51] in me
[5:52] and i really believe this uh study here
[5:55] is for you guys this
[5:56] brother jesse mentioned a name that i've
[6:00] never ever heard anyone even say and
[6:01] it's right on my notes
[6:04] this morning i just could not believe it
[6:06] i'm sitting there i'm going through this
[6:07] and boom he
[6:08] drops the name and right there it wasn't
[6:09] when i was like
[6:11] pretty slow so let's get into the word
[6:14] of god and we will keep you standing
[6:16] uh hopefully this will be a blessing to
[6:19] uh maybe just to further
[6:23] maybe everyone understands the breach
[6:25] i've never really understood it for 20
[6:27] years i've
[6:28] studied the message i've looked at it
[6:30] listen to sermons but i just never could
[6:31] get a real grasp of what
[6:33] what took place there at that breach
[6:34] what was going on there and uh
[6:37] dealing with some brothers there and
[6:41] through doctrinal ways and scripture
[6:44] and those sort of things and then i read
[6:46] uh we're dealing with
[6:48] a certain topic and i read a scripture
[6:50] and
[6:52] there come right there you know i just i
[6:54] just love it
[6:55] you can have a you can have a thought in
[6:56] your mind on a certain thing
[6:58] or the man gets seen you uh brother
[7:01] jose's got a beautiful beard i just want
[7:03] everybody to thank the lord for that
[7:05] beer that that lifted my
[7:07] i walked in and that my oh my heart
[7:09] caught on fire i was like oh that was
[7:12] and look at the hairs just flowing
[7:15] brothers got looks man god bless him
[7:19] i really appreciate that i took a
[7:20] picture with him
[7:22] i was so like man lord when i hit that
[7:25] age
[7:26] i got goals you gotta have goals right
[7:29] uh
[7:30] uh anyhow the the lord's uh
[7:33] been so good i lost my train of thought
[7:35] here so let's just
[7:36] that's weird okay let's go revelations
[7:38] five and one
[7:41] anyhow i i wondered a little bit about
[7:43] this the the
[7:44] the breach and what was going on there
[7:47] what
[7:48] what is significant about that and uh
[7:54] you know you read a scripture and and
[7:56] sometimes the entire revelation
[7:58] comes off one scripture and you
[7:59] understand it just you just catch
[8:01] one scripture and you can literally run
[8:04] that thing from
[8:05] genesis all the way in revelations in
[8:07] your mind
[8:08] and the picture it's like you have you
[8:11] have a puzzle
[8:12] and you have all the peach everything in
[8:14] place except that one little thing
[8:15] and just take that one little piece and
[8:17] it just finishes it
[8:19] or unlocks it however you will so i hope
[8:22] this will be a blessing today and i
[8:23] really believe the lord uh brother just
[8:25] mention that name my goodness
[8:35] yeah amazing revelations 5 1
[8:39] we'll read to verse 7 and i saw on the
[8:43] right hand of
[8:43] him that sat on the throne a book
[8:45] written within
[8:46] and on the back side sealed with seven
[8:48] seals and i saw a strong angel
[8:51] proclaiming with a loud voice who
[8:53] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[8:54] the seals thereof
[8:56] and no man in heaven nor on earth nor
[8:58] under the earth was able to open the
[9:00] book needed to look there on and i went
[9:01] much because no man was found worthy to
[9:04] open
[9:05] and to read the book neither to look
[9:08] thereof
[9:10] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[9:14] not behold the lion the tribe of judah
[9:15] the root of david
[9:17] which hath prevailed to open the book
[9:18] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[9:20] and i beheld and in the midst of the
[9:22] throne and in the four beasts
[9:24] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[9:26] lamb that had been slain having seven
[9:28] horns
[9:29] and seven eyes which are the seven
[9:31] spirits of
[9:32] god sent forth into all the earth and he
[9:34] came and took the book
[9:37] out of the right hand that has of him
[9:39] that sat upon
[9:41] the throne now
[9:45] let's just say word with prayer right
[9:47] there let's say a prayer
[9:51] dearly father lord jesus slowly
[9:55] come lord forever humbly though
[9:58] knowing we're just the fleeting shadows
[10:01] of time the last grains of sand are
[10:03] going through that
[10:04] uh time machine you've got there lord
[10:06] and lord jesus though we know this thing
[10:08] is soon it ends lord
[10:09] and well maybe not lord to the jews but
[10:11] lord the gentiles days are about over
[10:14] and lord jesus lord you know lord how
[10:16] unworthy we are even lord he would be
[10:18] uh privileged lord to call to this
[10:21] message though
[10:23] privileged lord for salvation lord
[10:25] vessels of honor lord chosen
[10:27] a forehand lord for your glory god
[10:31] and to show us your glory lord and lord
[10:33] i don't know why we're here lord you
[10:34] just ordained it
[10:36] that way you know in all my carnal plans
[10:39] though when i was younger lord we had no
[10:40] desire to be here the lord you do the
[10:43] call
[10:44] you do the choosing god in the lord
[10:46] jesus lord we are
[10:47] so thankful god lord for all that you've
[10:50] done in our
[10:50] lives where would we be without you lord
[10:54] jesus
[10:55] thank you lord so much and lord we come
[10:58] lord just
[10:58] humble lord you just take full control
[11:00] of this little service lord and
[11:02] this little vessel here lord and may you
[11:04] anoint the people here lord and i
[11:05] believe this is
[11:06] uh right in time lord for your lord to
[11:09] bring this little word lord this thought
[11:11] hello blessing people god let may have
[11:13] your weight in this service
[11:15] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[11:17] be seated
[11:19] so as we uh the last time i was here was
[11:22] a wednesday night there were seven of us
[11:24] and it was
[11:25] i felt real comfortable
[11:28] so this brother back here
[11:31] knows brother brooks and brother brooks
[11:34] is
[11:34] our i'd have to say just seriously our
[11:37] father in the faith
[11:39] he is uh our dearest compadre and
[11:44] friend and lawyer and when we prayed for
[11:47] truth
[11:48] he sent us to brother brooks's riot for
[11:50] the isaiah versus church
[11:52] and we've been with him on the
[11:55] battlefield obviously he's very gifted
[11:56] and many other things but uh
[11:58] we stand right behind him or beside him
[12:01] and uh certainly brother brooks is a
[12:03] special brother
[12:05] uh always has a special meaning in our
[12:07] hearts for jess and
[12:10] uh he was no other pastor did we have
[12:13] besides him
[12:14] that god called us under to train us and
[12:17] to feed us the word and to
[12:21] and to show us what the lord has showed
[12:23] us so
[12:24] anyhow let's uh be thankful for brother
[12:26] isaiah
[12:28] so here uh i don't know if i have this
[12:34] we even hooked up here oops there we go
[12:37] hope this will be a blessing you know
[12:38] i'm just a powerpoint guy i'm a little
[12:40] teacher
[12:41] just do bible studies and it's been kind
[12:44] of dry in the last year or so
[12:46] not too many people want bible studies
[12:49] um
[12:50] really a really it's just drying out i
[12:52] can't hardly it's hard to witness people
[12:54] you tell the truth and
[12:56] means nothing and i'm happy where i'm at
[12:58] and this and that and that you don't
[13:00] want god and this those those sort of
[13:01] things and
[13:02] it is what it is so
[13:07] so here we read uh in the scripture uh
[13:10] as uh christ here it was it was a
[13:14] certain
[13:14] now this came at a certain time this was
[13:17] just this could not take place
[13:19] in any specific time other than when it
[13:21] did take place
[13:23] and the lord uh told us that this was
[13:26] going to take place this is a book of
[13:27] prophecy here in revelations
[13:29] 5 1 to 22 however and
[13:32] it is a book of prophecy in other words
[13:35] he's god was showing that there was
[13:36] coming a time where he was going to take
[13:38] this book
[13:39] break the seven seals and then uh later
[13:42] on here then give it to
[13:43] john and give it to the bride to eat so
[13:46] um
[13:47] so if i had another scripture i'd want
[13:49] to tie in with this
[13:51] and just ask a couple questions i would
[13:52] go right here to malachi 4 and 1.
[13:55] it says and behold the day cometh that
[13:57] shall burn as an
[13:58] oven we all know this we these
[14:00] scriptures are just so common we
[14:02] uh as soon as we read them we know
[14:04] exactly what they mean we don't have to
[14:05] search
[14:06] much more uh the depths of them but but
[14:08] of course god always has more things
[14:10] hidden down in there
[14:11] uh through meanings through shadows
[14:13] through types and uh
[14:14] those sort of things um but then as we
[14:16] jump here to verse 5
[14:19] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[14:21] before the coming of the great and
[14:23] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[14:25] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[14:27] children
[14:27] and the heart of the children of the
[14:28] father lest they come and smite the
[14:30] earth
[14:31] with a curse right and as the man of god
[14:34] or prophet malachi 4 there would preach
[14:36] and preach and preach and he would say
[14:38] he says look saints this is not john the
[14:40] baptist because notice
[14:41] the world was not burned after
[14:44] john the baptist
[14:49] now malachi 4 has went off the scene the
[14:53] the
[14:54] revelations 10 70 the angel seventh
[14:56] angel has went off the scene in 65 so
[14:58] let me ask you another question
[15:00] has the earth burned yet
[15:04] why has not the earth burned yet
[15:10] if he says the day cometh and shall burn
[15:13] as an
[15:14] oven and the prophet would say time and
[15:16] time and time again he says
[15:18] he says when that man of god when
[15:20] malachi 4. when revelation 10 7
[15:22] when that angel the son of man is to be
[15:24] revealed when he comes he says
[15:26] you know right after his ministry and me
[15:28] he even said one time he says
[15:29] immediately after he says the earth will
[15:32] burn
[15:34] why is it burnt why
[15:37] are we still here
[15:40] so i guess if i had a title this morning
[15:42] it would be
[15:44] at this present time
[15:47] present time like right now where are we
[15:52] why has not the earth burned what is
[15:55] going on didn't
[15:56] was are we looking for another to come
[16:00] with greater signs with greater miracles
[16:02] with greater revelations
[16:06] have all the mysteries been cleared up
[16:09] do we understand who revelations
[16:11] uh 17 is do we understand what
[16:14] revelations 18's mean
[16:16] come out of my people be not a partaker
[16:18] over sin
[16:20] unless you receive of the plagues
[16:25] do we understand the seven church ages
[16:27] has those things brought forth do we
[16:28] understand the mysteries and depths of
[16:30] those
[16:32] do you understand the true baptism
[16:36] water baptism these all these all these
[16:39] things have been restored
[16:42] but why has not the earth been burnt
[16:47] so i want to get into this a little bit
[16:49] just a real simple thought but saints of
[16:51] god this is
[16:51] just so to me it was just so encouraging
[16:55] to see this thought so
[16:57] um i want to start here at a certain
[16:59] scripture here and
[17:02] where are we at at this present time
[17:06] at this present time where are we at why
[17:09] is this thing
[17:10] lingered and lingered and
[17:13] lingered on
[17:16] 2020
[17:18] [Music]
[17:20] from 1965 it's a long time
[17:25] most of us here were not even born then
[17:28] right except with our brother with a
[17:29] wonderful beard and mustache
[17:32] and our brother william
[17:36] our sister right there those i think
[17:39] those are
[17:39] past 65 okay yeah
[17:43] soldiers still weird
[17:46] they've seen a lot in their days so
[17:49] let's look at this
[17:52] god has a chosen man here
[17:55] and we know in the scripture
[17:58] that god said that moses was the meekest
[18:02] man on the face of the earth
[18:06] i think i taught a while back here about
[18:08] how how the the bride must become the
[18:10] meek
[18:11] because the bible says the meat shall
[18:12] inherit the earth
[18:14] and you know what the word meek means it
[18:16] means humble
[18:18] we must see ourselves as nothing
[18:23] except yielded sons and daughters of
[18:28] god and we must not have anything in our
[18:31] minds that we want to do outside
[18:33] of doing the will of the father amen
[18:37] because that is the father's business
[18:41] amen sure now there's a man by the name
[18:44] of moses the meekest
[18:46] man on the face of the earth and god
[18:48] said to him one time
[18:49] now what was special about moses god
[18:52] sent to him one time he says come up
[18:53] with me
[18:54] into the mount he says and be there he
[18:57] says
[18:57] and be there and i will give thee three
[19:00] tables of stone and the long
[19:01] commandments which i have written
[19:02] that thou mayest teach them and wrote
[19:04] moses rose up
[19:06] and his minister joshua and moses went
[19:09] up into the mount of god
[19:10] and he said unto the elders he says
[19:13] tarry ye
[19:14] here for us until we come again unto you
[19:16] and behold aaron and her
[19:17] are with you if any man have any matters
[19:20] to do let him
[19:21] come unto them but god said i want to
[19:24] speak some things
[19:25] to you moses jesus as moses went up into
[19:29] the mount and the cloud would cover the
[19:31] mount the prophet in god now being
[19:33] joined together
[19:34] communing right he says in the glory of
[19:37] the lord
[19:38] abode upon the mount sinai he says in
[19:41] the cloud covered in six days in the
[19:42] seventh day he called
[19:44] called unto moses out of the midst of
[19:45] the cloud and the sight of the glory of
[19:47] the lord
[19:48] like was like a devouring fire upon the
[19:51] top of the mountain in the eyes of the
[19:52] children of israel in other words if you
[19:53] go
[19:53] there right now today
[19:57] from where mount sinai really is that
[20:00] top of that mountain is still burnt
[20:03] it is burnt to a crisp if you can you
[20:06] can
[20:06] search it on google search it on the
[20:07] internet i believe is uh what's his name
[20:09] um
[20:12] anyone know that archaeologist ron wyatt
[20:14] found that
[20:15] he showed it he's shown actually where
[20:17] they went and rounded up those uh uh
[20:19] they had the
[20:20] altar and killed the slayed the lambs
[20:22] and slay the bullocks and all that stuff
[20:24] all that stuff's still there
[20:25] they found the very rock that all the
[20:27] water came out of
[20:29] it's like four four five was it ten
[20:31] stories tall or something it wasn't a
[20:32] small rock it was a big rock and it
[20:34] split
[20:34] completely in half by the force that
[20:37] water came out that rock
[20:41] so god calls this man up into the
[20:43] mountain he says
[20:44] and the eyes of the glory lord was like
[20:46] a devouring fire upon the top of the
[20:48] mountain the eyes of the children israel
[20:49] and moses went into the midst of the
[20:51] cloud
[20:51] and got him into the mount and moses was
[20:54] in the mount
[20:55] 40 days and 40 nights
[20:58] what were they doing what was what was
[20:59] going on at that time
[21:02] god was showing moses he was communing
[21:05] with
[21:05] moses about what now saints of god if we
[21:08] can get into the presence of god
[21:11] now look look what took place in the
[21:14] presence of god
[21:15] look at all the revelation that was
[21:17] given to moses
[21:20] if you look what was given to moses
[21:23] in that time when he was in the spirit
[21:26] of
[21:27] god why no
[21:30] we we we go like this we try and read
[21:32] the bible try and pray with us
[21:33] but if we get into the spirit
[21:37] what more can be opened up given fresh
[21:41] look at everything that took that was
[21:42] given to moses up there in 40 days and
[21:45] 40 nights
[21:46] the contributions for the sanctuary that
[21:49] order was given
[21:50] he said the ark of the covenant was that
[21:52] the the very dimensions how to build it
[21:54] was to be made out of
[21:56] all that came from being in the presence
[21:58] of god
[22:01] all that information the knowledge
[22:05] the table for bread which is brother
[22:07] jesse's book
[22:11] amen that revelation 4 that book
[22:14] was given by to moses on that day amen
[22:18] praise god yes that book started all the
[22:20] way back here but just
[22:22] somebody got into the spirit a meek man
[22:25] god in the spirit
[22:26] what and now we see you coming back at
[22:28] the end time amen
[22:30] as the 12 new testament mysteries praise
[22:33] be to god
[22:34] jesus and then what he said the golden
[22:36] lamp stands which represents the gentile
[22:38] church that's you and i that is a
[22:42] mystery
[22:44] that mystery came forth and was revealed
[22:47] to paul and to john but here first it
[22:51] was given to moses why because he was in
[22:53] the presence
[22:54] in the anointing of god for 40 days and
[22:57] 40 nights hallelujah
[22:59] what is in the mind of god we have to
[23:02] get in the presence of god
[23:04] praise god the tabernacle
[23:09] inner court holy place holy holies
[23:11] all those things
[23:14] the bronze altar the quarter of the
[23:16] tabernacle oil
[23:17] for the lamb the holy ghost
[23:24] the priests garments how we're supposed
[23:26] to conduct ourselves and dress ourselves
[23:28] amen
[23:29] consecration for the priests however to
[23:31] live the altar of incense the census tax
[23:34] the bronze basin the or the anointing
[23:36] oil and incense
[23:37] and then the holy bib and how's it
[23:41] progress
[23:42] that's allele unbelievable
[23:45] but just got memory god bless them
[23:47] [Laughter]
[23:49] and the sabbath day all this
[23:52] information was given to moses
[23:56] 40 days and 40 nights right
[23:59] because he got in with god in fact he
[24:02] was
[24:03] called and chosen to know these things
[24:06] he was called and chosen for these
[24:08] revelations
[24:09] this furthering these mystery he didn't
[24:11] even know they were mysteries
[24:13] right but these things were given to him
[24:15] that what it was
[24:16] not even really awesome he was given for
[24:18] us
[24:20] amen amen now
[24:24] all those things and when he gave unto
[24:27] moses
[24:29] and he gave it to moses when he had made
[24:30] an ending of communing with him upon
[24:32] mount sinai two table of testimony
[24:35] tables of stone written with the finger
[24:37] of
[24:38] god that's powerful stuff
[24:42] so here was one man getting in the
[24:45] presence of
[24:46] god for 40 days and 40 nights and he
[24:49] received
[24:50] all this information he received
[24:53] all all the all the pattern all the plan
[24:57] of god
[24:58] everything for his move he was given
[25:02] but what took place at that exact
[25:05] same time while one was gathered
[25:08] while one was getting all the revelation
[25:12] i think spiritually while you are
[25:15] getting
[25:15] all this revelation receiving all the
[25:18] knowledge of the mysteries
[25:19] while you're receiving the oil and the
[25:21] lamps the res the revelation of jesus
[25:24] christ
[25:25] while moses while i'll say this why you
[25:27] were getting all those things what was
[25:29] taking place
[25:30] elsewhere
[25:34] while psalm was getting in the presence
[25:36] of god
[25:37] and revelations blasting blasting
[25:40] blasting
[25:41] like brother man i said the roman candle
[25:42] goes out seven falls another sound falls
[25:44] nothing off that what was taking place
[25:48] down here
[25:52] and when the people saw the moses
[25:54] delayed to come down
[25:55] upon the mount the people gathered
[25:58] themselves together
[25:59] unto aaron and said to him make us gods
[26:01] who shall go out before us
[26:03] for as is for this moses the man which
[26:05] brought us up out of the land of egypt
[26:06] what we want not what is become of
[26:08] him while some while one person
[26:13] was called to the greatest most
[26:16] revelated time on the face of the earth
[26:18] at his day others
[26:22] were fully backsliding leaving
[26:26] the call these people came by a
[26:30] supernatural move
[26:32] called out of egypt by signs wonders and
[26:35] miracles
[26:36] and while one of them was continuing
[26:40] on into deeper greater greater things
[26:43] the others were backsliding all the way
[26:45] back to egypt they didn't go there in
[26:49] the physical
[26:50] but in the spiritual they were already
[26:52] back in egypt
[26:56] amen he says and aaron said to him break
[26:59] off the golden earrings which are
[27:00] in the ears of your wives and your sons
[27:02] and your daughters and bring them unto
[27:04] me
[27:04] and all the people break off the golden
[27:06] earrings which were in their ears and
[27:07] brought them unto
[27:08] aaron and received them in their hand
[27:10] and fashioned it with a graving tool
[27:12] whether he had made
[27:13] it a molten calf and they said these be
[27:15] thy gods of israel which had brought
[27:17] thee up out of the land of egypt notice
[27:18] false worship
[27:20] again a lie right notice the priesthood
[27:24] went off oh my god i sure
[27:27] yeah now
[27:33] but remember moses was a meek man
[27:37] moses was the prophet of god
[27:42] i'll say this one time for many times
[27:45] i'll pray to say this
[27:46] this this service
[27:49] malachi 4 behold i send you moses the
[27:52] prophet
[27:54] no it does not say moses
[27:57] right it says elijah
[28:01] john the baptist in luke 1 and 17
[28:05] he shall come in the spirit and power of
[28:08] moses no
[28:11] don't say moses
[28:14] but notice when moses is on the scene
[28:17] and he receives all these things
[28:21] all 40 communing with god
[28:24] and he comes down now from off that
[28:27] anointing off that spiritual
[28:29] hi i'll say it like that
[28:33] the lord said what unto moses in verse 7
[28:36] get thee down for thy people who shall
[28:38] brought out the land of egypt have
[28:40] corrupted themselves
[28:44] god says moses we're having a great time
[28:47] up here
[28:48] i'm showing you things i wanted to show
[28:50] somebody for all time
[28:52] i wanted to show people this for a long
[28:54] time he says but you're the chosen one
[28:56] you're going to see it and no one else
[28:58] is gonna see it until you bring it forth
[28:59] why because you are my chosen prophet
[29:01] praise be to god
[29:03] yes but he said he says your people
[29:07] the people all right people that i
[29:08] called out they're sliding back right
[29:10] now
[29:12] he said get down there and do something
[29:16] and they turn aside quickly out of the
[29:18] way which i have commanded them for they
[29:19] have
[29:20] made them a golden molten calf and have
[29:22] worshiped them and have sacrificed there
[29:23] on you and said these be thy gods the
[29:25] wisdom which have brought thee
[29:26] up out of the land of egypt and the lord
[29:29] said to moses
[29:29] i have seen this people and behold it is
[29:32] a stiff-necked people
[29:34] let me tell you something does god need
[29:35] to be three persons while god was
[29:38] up there communing with moses he already
[29:40] knew what
[29:41] was going down there he is all powerful
[29:45] he can be anywhere he can build multiple
[29:48] locations at one time
[29:52] is he omnipresent through omniscience he
[29:55] knows
[29:56] everything he is not surprised
[30:02] god goes down he sees a people they have
[30:05] totally
[30:06] stopped worshipping him went to
[30:08] something that's not even real
[30:10] brought forth idols and what he says
[30:12] here in verse 10.
[30:13] now therefore what's he telling moses he
[30:16] says let me alone
[30:19] all right meek man prophet back off
[30:25] he says that my wife my wrath may wax
[30:28] hot against him
[30:29] he says you stand back boy he says
[30:32] i'm gonna deal with these people i did
[30:34] the twelve or the ten signs what is the
[30:36] mirror i brought these people out these
[30:38] are my people
[30:39] stand back i'm going to deal with them
[30:43] then i may consume them and i'll make
[30:45] thee and i'll make thee
[30:47] make of thee a great nation he says i'm
[30:49] done with these people moses i'm going
[30:51] to use
[30:52] you under your seedline
[30:59] but god set the stage for everything
[31:02] and moses what did moses say to an angry
[31:05] god
[31:07] god said he was all around i
[31:10] am gonna wipe these people out but moses
[31:14] fresh out of 40 days in the presence
[31:18] of god wow anybody received a baptism of
[31:22] the holy ghost before
[31:25] you can feel the presence for days and
[31:27] days and days hallelujah
[31:29] and why you're just as happy and praise
[31:31] me to god brother oh hallelujah
[31:33] praise the lord i'm so happy and just
[31:35] feel the presence of god and just
[31:37] everybody looks like they're clean all
[31:40] i see is jesus look at this sister jesus
[31:43] brother jesus brother jesus sister jesus
[31:45] brother jesus absolutely that's all i
[31:47] see is clean
[31:47] saints this brother might do something
[31:51] to me that system might do something to
[31:53] you or however
[31:54] it doesn't matter we're all clean
[31:59] moses fresh off the anointing
[32:03] still probably even anointed he had to
[32:06] be anointed to save this at this time
[32:09] if he was in the presence of god the
[32:11] prayers of god would then affect him
[32:15] and the lord says he says uh and the law
[32:17] and moses besought the lord his god said
[32:20] lord
[32:20] why dost thou wax hot against thy people
[32:25] why are you so mad lord i'm not mad
[32:31] the lord's like well moses they're not
[32:32] worshiping you guys i know i know i know
[32:34] he goes i know they're not worse from
[32:35] you but i'm still not man
[32:36] [Laughter]
[32:37] [Music]
[32:39] he was a type of christ
[32:43] which has he says which has thou wrought
[32:46] uh which thou has brought forth out of
[32:47] the land of egypt with great power and
[32:49] with us mighty hand
[32:51] he said lord how can you get so mad at
[32:53] these people
[32:54] you brought them out you've done such
[32:56] tremendous work with look at all you've
[32:58] done you've done it all
[33:00] yes and then he's then he said he says
[33:02] and then moses i'm sure
[33:04] the anointing on him he
[33:07] he tries to bring the spiritual
[33:09] reasoning as well
[33:10] he says wherefore should the egyptians
[33:12] speak and say for mischief did he bring
[33:14] them out
[33:15] he says lord why would you get mad he
[33:17] says he says back your own self up
[33:19] remember you don't want yourself to look
[33:22] bad
[33:25] don't re-reproach against yourself what
[33:28] kind of god would you be
[33:30] [Laughter]
[33:34] i know you're a good god be a good god
[33:38] amen and the lord in his in the
[33:42] uh more faith
[33:45] i'm sure if in the more faith he was
[33:47] angry but on the inside he's like oh
[33:49] yes that's what i wanted to hear
[33:53] that's my boy that's my prophet he says
[33:57] for mischief did he bring them out to
[33:58] slay them in the mountains consume them
[34:00] from the from the face of people
[34:01] turn thy rat their fierce wrath or
[34:04] repent of this evil against thy people
[34:06] he said lord just forgive them
[34:10] and moses knowing that if that didn't
[34:12] touch god's heart
[34:14] moses knew god loved abraham
[34:18] isaac he went back to the covenant
[34:23] remember moses says now remember abraham
[34:27] isaac did he use jacob he did not use
[34:30] the word jacob
[34:32] but he used the word israel because he
[34:34] needed all
[34:35] the power of god
[34:38] he needed to have that pull that card
[34:40] that prince with power with god amen
[34:44] thy servants to whom thou swear thine
[34:46] own self and say to him
[34:48] i will multiply thy seed to the stars of
[34:50] heaven brings them back to what he said
[34:52] he was going to do god but you said you
[34:53] are going to use
[34:54] the offspring of these three men
[34:57] and these are the offspring of these
[35:00] three men amen
[35:03] and the lord repented of the evil which
[35:05] he thought to do unto
[35:07] his people look at the anointing of the
[35:11] spirit of moses
[35:15] look at the kind of prophet that moses
[35:18] was
[35:18] look at the kind of man that moses was
[35:23] but now look what he says here
[35:28] for moses said unto them concentrate
[35:30] consecrate yourselves
[35:31] to the day this day uh yourselves to the
[35:33] day to the lord
[35:35] even every man and upon his son and upon
[35:37] his brother that he may bestow upon you
[35:40] a blessing this day and it came to pass
[35:42] and tomorrow that moses sent unto the
[35:43] people ye have sinned a great sin
[35:45] he had to call him out he to make sure
[35:48] they knew this was wrong
[35:49] and that god was not pleased
[35:53] now think of this
[35:58] saul king saul was supposed to slay
[36:02] everything
[36:03] but uh but samuel said he was gonna be
[36:06] there
[36:06] in time and when samuel did not show up
[36:10] saul did not wait and this exact
[36:13] same thing took place right here they
[36:16] had lost
[36:17] confidence on what moses what had
[36:19] happened to moses
[36:20] and they would not be patient and wait
[36:23] to see what took place with this prophet
[36:26] they god just brought these guys out
[36:29] and now he's going to forget about him
[36:30] that's not they did not know who they
[36:32] were dealing with
[36:34] they did not know they did not
[36:36] understand the god that called them out
[36:38] of egypt they did not understand
[36:40] how much he loved him he was giving the
[36:42] prophet everything that was going to
[36:43] prosper them
[36:44] up with them with the man of god there
[36:46] and he was it was for the people
[36:48] it wasn't necessarily for the prophet it
[36:50] was for the people and they did not wait
[36:54] my and the moses returned
[36:58] under the lord said all these people
[36:59] have seen the great sin and made them
[37:01] gods of gold
[37:04] now look at this look at this man moses
[37:07] look how great of satan humble way how
[37:09] great this man moses was
[37:12] yet now if thou for will forgive their
[37:15] sin
[37:17] and if not he says brought
[37:21] me i pray thee out of the book which
[37:23] thou has
[37:24] written
[37:29] who wrote the book jesus did
[37:32] god almighty and the lord said unto
[37:36] moses now this is going to tie right in
[37:38] with the breach here as we get to it
[37:40] and the lord said to moses whosoever has
[37:42] sinned against me
[37:43] him will i blot out of my book
[37:52] if you are on the book and you are
[37:53] eternal
[37:56] and you do not so this came up in a
[37:59] certain topic as well
[38:00] another discussion with certain
[38:02] individuals
[38:03] and they said brother the man of god
[38:05] brother braham said he said
[38:07] how he said brother and said you can be
[38:08] justified sanctified
[38:11] and still go to hell they said how's
[38:14] that possible i said i sent him the
[38:15] scripture i said you tell me
[38:18] let me tell you some things this bible
[38:20] is not supposed to make logical sense
[38:24] this bible is showing you what god calls
[38:28] sense this bible reveals to you the
[38:32] mind of god we have to quit making
[38:35] trying to think of this logically well
[38:38] this doesn't make sense why would he put
[38:39] their names on the book to take them off
[38:42] it's not i don't know
[38:45] all it tells me is they were called
[38:48] and when they heard that call of moses
[38:51] when they heard the word
[38:53] and they saw those things and they
[38:54] followed their names were put on
[39:00] but there are some that were put there
[39:01] before the foundation of the earth
[39:04] [Applause]
[39:07] but one thing we're certain names can be
[39:09] blotted off
[39:12] absolutely
[39:14] now look at this man
[39:19] moses they forgot god their savior which
[39:22] had done great things in egypt
[39:24] wondrous works in the land of ham and
[39:26] terrible things by the red sea therefore
[39:28] he hath
[39:28] he said that he would uh therefore he
[39:32] said that he would destroy them
[39:33] had not moses has chosen stood before
[39:37] him
[39:37] in the breach
[39:40] amen
[39:46] moses had to stand in the breach right
[39:50] yeah now this at the end here you're
[39:52] going to see this thing flip
[39:54] it's not what you think
[39:58] therefore he said unto unto them had not
[40:01] moses his chosen stood before him in the
[40:03] breach
[40:03] to turn away his wrath
[40:08] lest he would destroy them yea they
[40:11] despise the pleasant land which is what
[40:14] the holy ghost
[40:16] they despise the holy ghost and they
[40:18] believe not his word
[40:21] praise god spirit and truth they despise
[40:23] both spirit and truth
[40:27] and what's our call for this day the
[40:28] bible says what that we're supposed to
[40:30] be true
[40:31] worshipers worship in spirit
[40:34] and in truth amen you must have both
[40:38] remember that was now paul sealed the
[40:40] deal in first corinthians 13 he says no
[40:43] i know
[40:43] all mysteries in other words not false
[40:46] mysteries not this mystery or this one
[40:48] living off
[40:48] but all mysteries you have the full
[40:51] truth but if you do
[40:52] not have charity if you do not
[40:55] have the holy ghost it means nothing
[41:01] as brother jesse just posted on his
[41:02] website
[41:04] a gifted minister preaches on the two
[41:06] seeds
[41:08] the most single most powerful teaching
[41:11] on original sin i've ever heard
[41:14] and probably could never be matched
[41:19] and that brother's not even in the
[41:21] message anymore
[41:23] you can have all the mysteries but if
[41:26] you do
[41:27] not have the very life of
[41:30] christ it means nothing
[41:33] so what what do we want we want the very
[41:35] life give me the baptism of the holy
[41:37] ghost
[41:39] and then all the rest will be given you
[41:41] seek me first seek the kingdom of god
[41:43] first and all his righteousness shall
[41:46] follow
[41:49] yes yes the holy ghost will lead and
[41:52] guide you into
[41:54] all truth hallelujah thank you
[41:57] praise the lord now notice moses was a
[42:01] big
[42:02] interceder
[42:06] but now let's look at another one
[42:10] samuel
[42:15] this is a time of
[42:20] the judges hear god send the prophet on
[42:23] samuel the prophet
[42:26] and things start happening to test
[42:28] israel
[42:29] kings foreign kings start rising up but
[42:31] they had a prophet in the land
[42:35] and samuel was a dedicated man from
[42:38] birth
[42:39] to god he was an answer
[42:42] to prayer of a woman that fasted and
[42:45] prayed and said i must have
[42:46] a man-child her husband said am i not
[42:49] more than seven sons
[42:51] and she's like give me seed
[42:56] i've got to have a son and when god
[42:58] answered supernaturally
[43:01] she says now this is the kind of woman
[43:03] that she was she said i'm giving this
[43:05] boy back to
[43:06] you lord and place him right in the
[43:10] priesthood and god
[43:12] used that man especially gifted prophet
[43:18] now as these children israel will get in
[43:20] trouble time
[43:21] and time and time again
[43:25] look what samuel says unto the house of
[43:27] israel saying if you do return unto the
[43:28] lord with all your hearts
[43:33] just like it was at the beginning
[43:37] then put away the strange gods and
[43:39] ashtroth from you
[43:40] and prepare your hearts unto the lord
[43:43] put it
[43:44] all away
[43:47] god help us and serve him
[43:51] only and he will deliver you out of the
[43:53] hand of the philistines notice the
[43:54] prophet's care and concern for the
[43:56] children of god the people of god
[43:59] then the children put away balaam and
[44:01] ashtroth and serve the lord only and
[44:03] samuel said gather all israel to mispass
[44:06] and i will pray
[44:07] for you
[44:11] sam you knew he was already set aside
[44:13] sammy was already living the kind of
[44:15] life samuel was
[44:16] all he already had favor with god
[44:19] he was a prophet of god when when that
[44:21] prophet felt the anointing of the holy
[44:23] ghost and he spoke
[44:24] what things happened so samuel said i'm
[44:26] going to get in the presence right now
[44:28] he says i'm going to find the mind of
[44:29] god and i'm going to beg and intercede
[44:31] and god is going to deliver you
[44:36] and guess what happened he did
[44:42] notice and samuel took a suckling lamb
[44:45] and offered
[44:46] a burnt offering holy unto the lord and
[44:49] samuel cried unto the lord for
[44:52] israel and the lord
[44:55] heard him did it heard
[44:59] that it didn't hear israel it heard the
[45:01] prophet who heard the man
[45:03] who what had the spirit of christ on him
[45:06] amen
[45:07] he heard the one that had soul trivial
[45:09] and the one that says
[45:10] lord these are your people what it was
[45:13] moses 2.0
[45:15] absolutely this was another man that
[45:17] could touch the heart of god and say
[45:18] don't destroy him don't let any harm
[45:20] don't let it hurt or hate danger or
[45:22] anything harm anything
[45:23] touch your people lord please deliver
[45:25] them
[45:26] yes and god heard him
[45:33] now and god delivered them
[45:39] and then it comes down to where samuel's
[45:41] sons are getting old
[45:43] well same is getting old and the sons
[45:45] were his two sons were
[45:47] backslid priests backstage ministers but
[45:50] jesse's tall and that
[45:51] extensively type shadows however
[46:02] and the people approached samuel and
[46:04] said we want a
[46:06] king just like notice they got their
[46:08] eyes off god
[46:09] and started looking i know this is
[46:11] elementary he says but start
[46:13] looking at the leaders in the world
[46:16] and other denominational churches at
[46:18] this
[46:19] at that at that king or this this pastor
[46:21] or however
[46:22] right saints of god let me tell you
[46:24] something there is only one standard in
[46:26] the bible
[46:28] on judgment day
[46:32] on judgment day
[46:35] because we all have to answer to god
[46:41] do you think this is going to hold up in
[46:42] god's court i come before the lord
[46:46] his holy presence i said lord
[46:51] i might have done this a little bit
[46:52] better than this brother
[46:54] and if he if this brother was my
[46:56] standard
[46:58] and i said i live better than this
[46:59] brother but but i i wasn't as good as
[47:01] him
[47:01] on other things but i was better him on
[47:03] this thing
[47:05] and jesus is going to say what is my
[47:08] standard
[47:11] yeah here's the thing we see here here's
[47:14] the thing
[47:14] that kind of muddles our mind sometimes
[47:16] our imagination
[47:19] whereas william might think he's better
[47:20] me than this spiritually in certain
[47:22] things in areas aspects maybe
[47:24] maybe his character is better than mine
[47:26] i said well he's
[47:27] he might say well i'm good to go
[47:30] or this sister might be more humble more
[47:32] meek than this other sister says
[47:33] i'm good i'm good at least i'm better
[47:36] than her
[47:37] or i'm better than this brother
[47:41] but what's going to be the standard
[47:45] we are all in the race
[47:51] when all of us are up there and one by
[47:53] one we have to give an account
[47:55] god have mercy we are going to need the
[47:59] holy we're going to have to say
[48:00] i've got the token do you think i'm
[48:03] going to try and make any reasons or
[48:04] this i'm just saying here's my
[48:06] talking lord
[48:10] laid at his feet the holy ghost
[48:13] every one of us is judged by this
[48:18] not by you can't compare yourself to
[48:20] anyone else we're judged by this
[48:25] there ain't no great ones among us
[48:26] because we're all judged by this
[48:35] god help us and we are going to need
[48:38] grace on that day and we
[48:40] we will have grace on that day
[48:43] because the bible said he won't have a
[48:45] wife
[48:46] and david said what he says blessed is
[48:49] the man whom god will not
[48:51] impute iniquity where did that blessing
[48:54] come from it came all the way back to
[48:56] genesis 1.
[48:58] and the bible said in genesis 1 he says
[48:59] let us make man our image in the image
[49:01] of god he created hear them he says and
[49:02] he said i bless
[49:04] them that blessing came i was already
[49:08] there
[49:14] so these people wanted a king a natural
[49:18] man to lead them
[49:23] and it hurt samuel very much
[49:27] because he loved the lord do you think
[49:29] samuel
[49:30] wanted anyone leading him outside of god
[49:32] no sir
[49:37] god samuel brought it before god and god
[49:40] said
[49:41] now therefore hearken unto their voice
[49:43] how be it
[49:44] yet protest solemnly unto them
[49:48] try to get them to change their mind try
[49:51] to let them know what decision they are
[49:53] making
[49:57] we must make
[50:00] good decisions yes starting now
[50:05] because whatever decision we made
[50:07] yesterday and last week
[50:09] and last month and years ago we can't
[50:11] change we must make good decisions
[50:13] from this moment forward
[50:17] amen how many's got false in here how
[50:20] many main beds have changed before
[50:21] right here this guy
[50:26] many of them men i could write you a
[50:28] brother jesse's book where's that
[50:30] my book of mistakes would be greater
[50:31] than that
[50:32] [Laughter]
[50:34] hallelujah yeah i'm being honest i'm
[50:37] being yeah
[50:38] it will probably 20 000 of those books
[50:40] to be all my faults and failures and
[50:41] sins and
[50:42] iniquities
[50:45] let's be honest absolutely
[50:49] but it takes just a little thin look
[50:51] like this to make it all right
[50:54] oh hallelujah this is the great
[50:55] equalizer right there this will teach me
[50:57] how to get rid of all my truckload of
[50:59] sins amen praise me the god of
[51:00] iniquities
[51:01] yes this is instructions on how to get
[51:04] rid of those things
[51:06] wanna make your way away to heaven
[51:08] praise me to god
[51:09] yes i am pounding on that
[51:14] yeah so god tells samuel he says
[51:17] don't let them do this tell them warn
[51:20] them show them absolutely samuel does
[51:24] but he said now notice if you pick
[51:28] a king he's going to do this
[51:32] he's going to do this he's going to do
[51:34] this he's going to do this
[51:37] but the moment you go into this then you
[51:40] make your final
[51:41] decision
[51:46] and ye shall cry in the day because your
[51:48] king which she have chosen
[51:51] and what god say and the lord will not
[51:55] hear you in that day
[52:02] i thought god was a god of grace and
[52:03] mercy
[52:05] but once you go into order what was what
[52:07] was samuel
[52:09] taipa or saul assault king saw a type of
[52:11] denomination
[52:12] or that organization
[52:17] organization the spirit of organizations
[52:19] before denomination
[52:21] as the prophet broke it down in the
[52:22] church age book the spirit of
[52:24] organization
[52:26] kicks out the spirit of god
[52:29] and once the spirit of god is out then
[52:31] denomination can come in
[52:33] and set up its man-made doctrines
[52:37] you got to watch how the spirit moves
[52:39] you got to watch how the antichrist
[52:40] spirit works he must get the spirit of
[52:42] god out first
[52:44] and then he can set up his kingdom so
[52:47] let us keep
[52:48] the spirit of god here
[52:51] keep it in your midst stay man
[52:54] yes wow are we okay
[52:59] sunday morning praise the lord now
[53:03] he says nevertheless the people refuse
[53:05] to obey the voice of samuel they said
[53:07] nay
[53:07] but we will have a king god is not going
[53:10] to hear them now
[53:12] when it gets tough
[53:16] you know the spirit you know the story
[53:18] of saul
[53:19] after this what took place many
[53:22] israelites died
[53:26] in battle saw himself die
[53:30] the leader of this movement would not
[53:32] even speak
[53:34] to god or god would not even speak to
[53:35] the leaders movement
[53:40] and the lord will not hear you in that
[53:41] day
[53:44] he would not hear saul
[53:47] because he went in he was the leader of
[53:49] that campaign
[53:52] all right now therefore
[53:56] but notice samuel look at the character
[53:59] and
[54:00] nature of this man much like moses
[54:03] and same with some of the people figured
[54:05] out you have done all this wickedness by
[54:07] choosing you a king
[54:10] yeah it turned out aside from following
[54:11] lord but serve the lord he says if
[54:13] you're going in it you might you better
[54:14] serve god with all your heart
[54:17] if you still want the blessings of god
[54:19] to remain you better serve god
[54:21] give him everything withhold nothing
[54:26] and turn you not aside for then should
[54:28] you go after the vain things
[54:30] which they cannot profit nor deliver for
[54:32] they are vain
[54:35] laodicea let me tell you something all
[54:38] you young men
[54:39] how many this brother here from maokai
[54:44] i don't know about this brother be very
[54:46] leery about becoming a plumber
[54:51] plumbing will take over your life
[54:54] because everybody needs a plumber
[54:57] every hour of every day
[55:01] so johnny i'm sure knows as a
[55:04] electrician
[55:05] almost exactly the same kind of there's
[55:08] a lot of electricity in residential
[55:10] houses
[55:11] there's a lot of plumbing in residential
[55:12] houses and you could you could literally
[55:14] lose your entire life
[55:16] to a job i'm a witness
[55:19] hey amen
[55:23] all vanity a lot of times i
[55:26] i help i don't even take i take the job
[55:28] just to help the people not even for
[55:29] money
[55:30] it's not even worth it it's it's so much
[55:33] vanity to it
[55:35] because this is it the will of god for
[55:36] me to run to every single
[55:38] anyhow i'm okay i'm on that now notice
[55:42] samuel that's a warning
[55:45] now they say dirty hands clean money
[55:47] sure absolutely but it's an honest
[55:48] living but
[55:49] you've got to control that thing you've
[55:51] got to control it into you john into
[55:53] your profession
[55:54] your job is not number one
[55:57] jesus christ is number one
[56:03] by the grace by the grace of god i
[56:05] missed one maybe two services
[56:07] because i had to work on a sunday and
[56:09] that's within the last year or so
[56:12] so i fought it and i fought it and
[56:13] fought it until you kind of
[56:15] anyhow now notice samuel was saying he
[56:18] says
[56:18] he says don't turn aside for vain things
[56:20] for the lord will not forsake his people
[56:22] for his great name sake
[56:24] because it please lord to make you his
[56:26] people notice god still wanted to rule
[56:28] over them though they entered into that
[56:29] denominational
[56:30] and organizational spirit now no notice
[56:33] what he says go over
[56:34] as for me as for samuel
[56:37] as for the prophet just like moses he
[56:39] says god forbid that i should sin
[56:42] against the lord
[56:43] how would he sing against the lord he
[56:46] says
[56:46] in ceasing to pray he was an interceder
[56:51] he loved the very people of god
[56:54] he he knew that god wanted to deal with
[56:56] this brother and this brother that
[56:57] sister no all he wants
[56:59] you are god's children you are god's
[57:02] people
[57:05] and samuel says i will always pray for
[57:08] you
[57:10] just like saint paul said he's playing
[57:11] paul says i've been in peril so deep
[57:13] false brother and this and this he says
[57:14] jesus but most everything constantly
[57:16] says
[57:17] praying for the churches
[57:22] paul said i've been beaten three times
[57:24] forty stripes
[57:25] slave one i've been in the deep
[57:28] shipwrecked all those things he said but
[57:30] the greatest thing he says the care of
[57:32] the churches
[57:34] he is a real man of god
[57:38] he cares about the children of the most
[57:40] high
[57:43] he says but i will steal his i would
[57:45] teach you the good and the right
[57:47] way now
[57:50] there's two mighty men right there moses
[57:53] and samuel
[57:54] people who will sigh and cry day and
[57:57] night for our sins
[58:00] for the sins of those people yes in that
[58:03] time in that hour they were the ones
[58:06] interceding
[58:10] now lotus in the days of the open book
[58:14] and the people of the land have used
[58:16] oppression and exercise robbery and have
[58:18] vexed the poor needy
[58:19] yeah they have oppressed the stranger
[58:21] wrongfully and i
[58:22] sought a man among them
[58:27] that would make up the hedge and stand
[58:30] in the gap before me
[58:32] for the land that i should not destroy
[58:35] it
[58:36] but i found none
[58:42] what is the eagle that roll that open
[58:44] book came down his eagle he ate the book
[58:46] exactly revelations 10.
[58:50] and here in those days of the open book
[58:52] much like this day
[58:54] god couldn't find a man who was fully
[58:57] interceding but he was looking
[59:00] for someone he was searching for the one
[59:04] that would make intercession but he said
[59:07] he couldn't find one
[59:11] they came to a point in israel's time
[59:16] and the lord said unto me though
[59:20] you mean god can get fed up and he seals
[59:23] the door
[59:24] shut and he closes and will not hear us
[59:27] anymore or hear his children or anybody
[59:30] he says though moses and samuel
[59:37] then saith the lord the lord calls out
[59:40] these
[59:40] warriors moses samuel who are men
[59:44] of people men have gone forth the cent
[59:47] for the protection and the profits and
[59:50] the the
[59:51] prophetic it's like profit not as like a
[59:54] prophecy
[59:54] but as far as profit for gain for
[59:57] the people these two were sent
[1:00:01] to profit the people to keep them
[1:00:04] protected
[1:00:04] safe sound but god said though moses and
[1:00:08] samuel stood before me
[1:00:09] yet my mind could not be toward this
[1:00:12] people
[1:00:14] he said you could get these two both
[1:00:16] these guys right now
[1:00:17] and they still can change one thing
[1:00:22] cast them out of my sight and let them
[1:00:25] go for
[1:00:26] there is a time when god gets fed up
[1:00:30] and saints of god let me tell you
[1:00:31] something what age are we
[1:00:33] in in this present moment
[1:00:36] we are in laodicea and the bible says if
[1:00:40] we are not
[1:00:40] called and if we are not hot he will
[1:00:42] spew us out
[1:00:45] god help
[1:00:50] and it shall come to pass if they say
[1:00:52] unto thee whither shall we go forth
[1:00:54] then thou shalt tell them thus saith the
[1:00:56] lord such are for death
[1:00:59] such as for death to death and such a
[1:01:01] sword for swords such a famine famous
[1:01:02] such as a captivity captain in other
[1:01:04] words there's no way out
[1:01:05] you're all getting it things of god
[1:01:08] let us get ready for this rapture
[1:01:11] is everyone here ready for this rapture
[1:01:14] we must be filled with the baptism of
[1:01:16] the holy ghost
[1:01:17] hallelujah because if not here
[1:01:21] is what's left
[1:01:26] run you to and fro through the streets
[1:01:28] of jerusalem and see now and know
[1:01:30] and seek in the broad places thereof and
[1:01:33] see
[1:01:34] and if you see if you can find a man if
[1:01:38] there be any that executes the judgment
[1:01:40] and seeketh truth he says and i will
[1:01:42] pardon
[1:01:45] god always gives warning before judgment
[1:01:48] and here in the very heart of god he
[1:01:50] says israel was such
[1:01:51] was all ate up in jerusalem he says go
[1:01:53] fight me one man
[1:01:54] and i'll pardon the whole thing this
[1:01:57] judgment that i've declared just like
[1:01:59] jonah
[1:02:00] jonah said 40 days you're all dead man
[1:02:05] did they get did they die no they
[1:02:07] repented because
[1:02:08] what god found one man that would go
[1:02:12] inside and cry
[1:02:13] behind abominations he says guys you
[1:02:15] better wake up
[1:02:16] judgment's on his way god pardon the
[1:02:18] entire city
[1:02:23] and though they say the lord lives
[1:02:24] surely they sweareth falsely
[1:02:26] o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth
[1:02:29] thou hast stricken them but they have
[1:02:30] not grieved thou has consumed them but
[1:02:32] they have not refused to
[1:02:33] they have had but they have refused to
[1:02:35] receive correction
[1:02:36] they have made their face harder than
[1:02:38] iraq and they refused to return
[1:02:41] saints of god this malachi 4 was sent to
[1:02:44] turn our hearts
[1:02:45] back to the father
[1:02:49] back to what the very book of acts
[1:02:52] ministry
[1:02:53] and as far as i know none of us are
[1:02:55] fully there yet
[1:02:57] but we are coming we in our hearts
[1:03:01] we desire
[1:03:05] it is our goal we are
[1:03:09] if these things come to us we say lord
[1:03:11] you said
[1:03:12] you would restore
[1:03:16] you said lord you would restore lord and
[1:03:18] lord restored upon us amen
[1:03:21] praise god that's what we want we want
[1:03:23] restoration
[1:03:24] lord no matter what it takes in my life
[1:03:26] to get these things out
[1:03:27] get them out
[1:03:30] yes
[1:03:36] isaiah 59 16 yay 15 sorry
[1:03:40] yay truth faileth and he that departed
[1:03:42] for me making themselves to pray and the
[1:03:44] lord sought and displeased him for there
[1:03:45] was no
[1:03:46] judgment there was a time where people
[1:03:49] would do things and no one would call it
[1:03:51] out
[1:03:54] there was a time when the laity would do
[1:03:56] things and no one would call out their
[1:03:58] brother and sister would just let it go
[1:04:00] there was a time when a preacher would
[1:04:02] go up and preach and preach false
[1:04:03] doctrines
[1:04:04] and no one called out
[1:04:09] and he saw that there was no man and
[1:04:12] wondered that there was no intercessor
[1:04:15] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[1:04:18] him and his righteousness it sustaineth
[1:04:20] him in other words god had to do it
[1:04:21] himself
[1:04:24] in jesus day how much false doctrine was
[1:04:27] there
[1:04:28] loads of it i taught on years ago i
[1:04:31] think a year or two ago i taught on the
[1:04:33] gibeonites
[1:04:35] if you look at that study if you wash
[1:04:38] pots and pans if you did that was a
[1:04:40] death sentence back then
[1:04:42] you could be you could be stoned for
[1:04:43] that back in that day in jesus day they
[1:04:46] held the words of the scribes and
[1:04:48] pharisees above
[1:04:49] the torah right they said the words of
[1:04:53] the sky and the pharisees are more
[1:04:55] weightier
[1:04:57] than the holy scriptures
[1:05:01] in other words a minister will get back
[1:05:03] behind his pulpit
[1:05:04] and now amen his word even if it doesn't
[1:05:07] line up with the bible
[1:05:13] bro jesse just showed me a thing
[1:05:16] a man said a minister and this message
[1:05:20] said
[1:05:23] that it's poppycock or tommy roth if you
[1:05:25] will that we need a scripture
[1:05:28] to prove a quote that we have to take
[1:05:30] the quotes back to the scripture they
[1:05:32] said that man doesn't even
[1:05:33] need behind the pulpit things of god let
[1:05:36] me tell you
[1:05:37] something even in denomination
[1:05:41] i was taught the bible is the absolute
[1:05:46] and you know what when i come to this
[1:05:47] message if you listen to malachi 4 you
[1:05:49] listen to his messenger he said the
[1:05:51] bible
[1:05:51] is the absolute and he also said the
[1:05:54] holy ghost
[1:05:55] is the north star yeah yes
[1:06:00] amen you know what the difference
[1:06:02] between jesus christ and brother graham
[1:06:03] was
[1:06:04] for the man was sinful he was
[1:06:08] a sinful man and he exaggerated
[1:06:12] and he did say things wrong
[1:06:17] much like nathaniel or nathan i'll say
[1:06:19] like this
[1:06:20] david said i want to build god a temple
[1:06:22] nathan said
[1:06:24] do whatever's on your heart son and god
[1:06:26] said
[1:06:27] you messed up nathan that's not what i
[1:06:29] want yeah
[1:06:30] good and nathan had to go and correct
[1:06:34] what he told prophet god had to correct
[1:06:36] what he said absolutely
[1:06:38] all through the scripture because the
[1:06:41] word is the absolute
[1:06:43] if there's something that takes place in
[1:06:44] this day there's always an old testament
[1:06:46] new testament type
[1:06:47] laying right there in the word of god it
[1:06:50] is proven time and time again
[1:06:51] if you are a believer bible believer yes
[1:06:54] sir
[1:06:55] now wow i've held you guys 53 minutes
[1:06:58] everybody okay still
[1:07:00] all right let's continue on here 53 i
[1:07:04] don't i don't hold you too long i want
[1:07:05] to i want i want to show you this breach
[1:07:10] and i hope this is a blessing because
[1:07:13] jesus christ did something tremendous
[1:07:14] for us
[1:07:16] he did something very very tremendous
[1:07:19] amen now
[1:07:22] hold on here let me see let's get that
[1:07:28] let's get that now
[1:07:31] continuing on here there is a time when
[1:07:34] god has done
[1:07:36] he is tired genesis 5
[1:07:40] the sons of god saw the daughters of man
[1:07:41] that they were fair and took upon them
[1:07:43] wives and this and that
[1:07:45] directly after the sons of god took on
[1:07:48] the serpent the daughter serpents
[1:07:50] god said it is done it is
[1:07:53] finished judgment is coming it's already
[1:07:56] sealed it's set and you're going to have
[1:07:58] some issues here
[1:08:00] right he was done no one moses did you
[1:08:02] notice noah did not intercede
[1:08:04] he just kept preaching and preaching his
[1:08:05] coming gay there was no saving and he
[1:08:07] said just get in the ark
[1:08:09] you're not saving this earth just get in
[1:08:10] the ark that was what is the message
[1:08:12] which is coming it's raining
[1:08:14] he says and get in the ark get into
[1:08:16] safety because out here is not going to
[1:08:18] be saved
[1:08:21] now therefore look he says god done he
[1:08:23] says and i'll cast you out of my sight
[1:08:25] even i cast out all your brother and
[1:08:26] even the whole seed of ephraim
[1:08:28] he says ephraim he says therefore pray
[1:08:30] not for this people
[1:08:33] neither lift up cry
[1:08:36] lift up cry or prayer for them neither
[1:08:39] make intercession
[1:08:40] to me for i will not hear thee saints of
[1:08:43] god we are
[1:08:44] in the most dangerous time period in all
[1:08:46] history
[1:08:50] say to god remember we all have lives
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] sisters children housework
[1:08:58] brothers work going around doing this
[1:09:00] and this
[1:09:02] but those are distractions
[1:09:05] those are just temporary things that we
[1:09:07] have to do
[1:09:08] frivolous things our jobs are frivolous
[1:09:10] things we have to do to make it
[1:09:11] to to keep afloat but we
[1:09:14] we have to be set aside for the lord
[1:09:16] jesus christ amen
[1:09:18] at all times ready ready to go we cannot
[1:09:22] have things the bible scripture says uh
[1:09:26] um because it's i don't have a memory
[1:09:30] like brother john
[1:09:31] so something like uh if
[1:09:34] you're not careful for the things of
[1:09:35] this world i'll say like that i don't
[1:09:37] know if
[1:09:37] it's um burned down or i don't know
[1:09:40] anyhow
[1:09:41] i don't have to get ended by myself
[1:09:45] he says for i will not hear thee notice
[1:09:47] for according to all the numbers of the
[1:09:49] cities where
[1:09:50] were their gods he says oh judah and
[1:09:52] according to the numbers on the streets
[1:09:53] of jerusalem have set e
[1:09:54] up altars to that shameful thing even
[1:09:56] altars to burn incense unto baal
[1:09:59] notice they went fully into baalism
[1:10:01] therefore pray thou not for those people
[1:10:03] neither lift up or cry for them brown to
[1:10:05] hear them in a time of the time they cry
[1:10:07] to me for their trouble once again
[1:10:10] once again jeremiah says then said the
[1:10:12] lord unto me pray not for this good for
[1:10:14] this people
[1:10:15] for their good when they fast i will not
[1:10:18] hear their cry
[1:10:19] and when they offer burnt offering and
[1:10:21] oblation i will not accept them
[1:10:23] there's a time saints of god when the
[1:10:24] doors shut
[1:10:26] god help us to get there
[1:10:30] now we're in a
[1:10:35] time where we're leaning
[1:10:42] in ezekiel 22 and i just got caught wind
[1:10:45] of this
[1:10:46] ezekiel 22 verse 26 notice her priests
[1:10:50] have violated my law and have profaned
[1:10:52] my holy things
[1:10:54] they have no put no difference between
[1:10:56] the the holy and the profane
[1:10:59] neither have they huge difference
[1:11:00] between the unclean and the clean they
[1:11:02] have hid their eyes from my
[1:11:03] establishment i profaned among them
[1:11:05] in other words they they allow gray
[1:11:07] areas
[1:11:11] now i just come to knowledge of this but
[1:11:12] there are a lot of sisters in this
[1:11:14] and not in this church but in this
[1:11:17] message that we
[1:11:17] are wearing pajama pants pants
[1:11:21] pants pajama pants
[1:11:25] you know there's one quote brother
[1:11:27] branham
[1:11:28] what do you think this is he says well i
[1:11:31] don't have thus said lord
[1:11:32] but he says what he says i don't see
[1:11:34] what's wrong
[1:11:36] with a c now this is dave malachi 4's
[1:11:38] opinion
[1:11:40] malachi 4 said what he said i don't see
[1:11:44] anything wrong
[1:11:45] why can't the sister just wear a nice uh
[1:11:52] nightgown
[1:11:57] and now i'm hearing that the majority of
[1:12:00] sisters i know wear these pajama pants
[1:12:03] at night
[1:12:04] and when they're not when they're at
[1:12:05] home they're still wearing them
[1:12:09] what is going on here but we will
[1:12:12] declare right here
[1:12:14] well i will declare right here i do not
[1:12:17] like that
[1:12:18] right
[1:12:21] do men wear pajama pants but jess you

[1:13:28] could you do another study on hair and
[1:13:29] dress or
[1:13:30] let's bring that book out again
[1:13:40] okay i just i heard about that and i was
[1:13:42] i was so
[1:13:44] upset and we're wondering why we're not
[1:13:47] seeing
[1:13:48] the things we need to be seeing
[1:13:51] is the things done in the darkness
[1:13:53] what's coming next in the open
[1:13:56] let me give you a story three years ago
[1:13:58] i was
[1:13:59] i had a sister i had we had flown some
[1:14:02] sisters in
[1:14:03] and one was holiness the daughter was
[1:14:06] not
[1:14:07] and as my it was in my lot to host
[1:14:11] true story this is my lot to host i took
[1:14:14] him to cedar point and
[1:14:15] the road rides now the sister daughter
[1:14:16] was still in pants
[1:14:18] and lo and behold at cedar point
[1:14:22] guess what i saw a sister
[1:14:27] an old time sister that i know from way
[1:14:30] back
[1:14:31] when i come in the message she's walking
[1:14:33] around with her daughter
[1:14:34] wearing culottes which is pretty much
[1:14:37] just
[1:14:38] baggy real baggy empty hammer pants
[1:14:44] and she thinking no one's going to see
[1:14:46] her at cedar point
[1:14:48] and boom i'm like this and my wife's
[1:14:51] like hey
[1:14:51] is that where what oh my goodness
[1:14:55] in fact when we ran into them i could
[1:14:58] not
[1:14:58] introduce this sister and say that she
[1:15:02] was a believer
[1:15:04] because i'm witnessing to this sister
[1:15:05] about wearing skirts
[1:15:10] what do i do i say huh this is one of
[1:15:12] our friends
[1:15:15] because you know what as soon as this
[1:15:17] sister and pants would see that she's
[1:15:19] like oh versailles she's not wearing
[1:15:21] skirts and i'm like
[1:15:22] i know so i had to introduce
[1:15:26] a little bit different that day
[1:15:29] caught right in the act
[1:15:34] don't fear god
[1:15:38] true story now all right let's let's get
[1:15:41] to this
[1:15:43] ezekiel 22 19 29 the people the land
[1:15:47] if anyone has a problem with that i i'm
[1:15:49] sorry that is that is the way i see it
[1:15:51] and remember
[1:15:53] when i prayed for truth he sent me to
[1:15:55] brother isaiah brooks's church
[1:15:58] and brother isaiah brooks the preacher
[1:15:59] say anything
[1:16:09] the people and have used oppression and
[1:16:11] exercise robbery and have
[1:16:12] vexed the poor needy yeah they have
[1:16:14] oppressed a stranger wrongfully
[1:16:16] he says and i sought for a man among
[1:16:18] them that would make up a hedge and
[1:16:20] stand in the gap
[1:16:20] before me for the land for i would not
[1:16:22] destroy he says but i found
[1:16:24] none
[1:16:30] now let's get into this i want you to i
[1:16:33] want to show you something here
[1:16:38] for the day of vengeance is in my heart
[1:16:40] what is the day of vengeance
[1:16:42] maokai 4-5
[1:16:45] 5-6 unless i come and smite the earth
[1:16:47] with the curse
[1:16:50] and the year of my redeemed is come
[1:16:53] there is a year coming saints whether
[1:16:56] it's this year or next year
[1:16:58] where the redeemed of god are going to
[1:17:01] be redeemed amen
[1:17:05] glory but it's going to be the exact god
[1:17:07] has two things in his heart
[1:17:08] judgment and mercy judgment
[1:17:11] and grace grace
[1:17:14] and i looked and there was none to help
[1:17:16] and i wondered there was none to uphold
[1:17:19] therefore my own arm brought salvation
[1:17:21] unto me in my period with
[1:17:22] it upheld me and i'll tread down the
[1:17:25] people in my anger and make them drunk
[1:17:27] in my fury and i'll bring down their
[1:17:28] strength to the earth
[1:17:32] we're at that time but when he brings
[1:17:34] the judgment what's supposed to happen
[1:17:36] here behold i send elijah the prophet
[1:17:38] right
[1:17:39] but what are the lies of the prophet do
[1:17:42] let me show you in the message let me
[1:17:44] show you this in the message here
[1:17:46] 6 8 62.
[1:17:50] he says if these mighty signs would have
[1:17:52] been done in russia it wouldn't be
[1:17:53] communist today
[1:17:55] these mighty signs would be on china
[1:17:56] wouldn't be communist day oh america
[1:17:58] america how oft hath god visit you and
[1:18:02] how much longer will he permit it
[1:18:04] the end time is here the evening lights
[1:18:06] are shining he said how much
[1:18:08] longer do we have 1960 and
[1:18:12] 2. we're at the end
[1:18:15] he says 1962 1962 he says how much
[1:18:20] longer do we have
[1:18:24] 1963
[1:18:28] you leave the west coast and go right
[1:18:29] back into china japan right back
[1:18:31] in again seven thousand miles across
[1:18:33] you're right back to east again so east
[1:18:34] west is matt that's all of it he says
[1:18:36] we're at the end he says there's nothing
[1:18:38] left 1963
[1:18:42] why did god have to send the spirit of
[1:18:44] elijah
[1:18:45] instead of the spirit of samuel why did
[1:18:48] god have to spend
[1:18:48] the spirit of elijah instead of moses
[1:18:52] at this time and why in this time where
[1:18:56] the seal is broken
[1:19:02] notice the man of god he says there's
[1:19:04] nothing left
[1:19:06] he said what's the matter with the
[1:19:07] pentecostal church you don't want to
[1:19:09] listen to something that that'll
[1:19:10] that'll do you good it'll make you sick
[1:19:12] to your theological gastronomics
[1:19:14] but it'll do you good it'll work you out
[1:19:16] back to the word of god and back to the
[1:19:18] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:19:19] saints and take away from all this here
[1:19:21] bible school
[1:19:22] theological seminary giving you
[1:19:23] ministers all kinds of degrees
[1:19:25] god never did hand out a handful of
[1:19:26] solid apples like that he wanted to
[1:19:28] have men of faith correct he said i know
[1:19:31] that's hard but i'm here to tell i'm
[1:19:33] here to
[1:19:34] i'm not here to baby you and make you
[1:19:35] laugh and make you shout
[1:19:37] i'm here to tell you the truth in god
[1:19:41] and you'll see someday if you don't
[1:19:43] believe it now some day will come when
[1:19:44] you'll say that was right true
[1:19:46] you've got to get back the whole thing
[1:19:48] is in this condition
[1:19:50] there's nothing left for it to come but
[1:19:52] the coming of the lord jesus
[1:19:55] 63. he said in other words he's saying
[1:19:58] we're done
[1:20:00] it's over
[1:20:04] the saints of god that was 1963 it's
[1:20:07] 2021
[1:20:09] june 18.
[1:20:12] what are the birthdays
[1:20:16] god why 18
[1:20:19] why are we still here
[1:20:26] i notice what was the spirit of elijah
[1:20:29] remember god always wanted he says give
[1:20:32] me a man that will tell the truth
[1:20:36] give me a man that can see the truth
[1:20:40] why do you have to be a prophet saints
[1:20:43] of god in 1909
[1:20:45] the end of the azusa street revival
[1:20:49] is stopped at that year the reducer
[1:20:50] street bible after three years
[1:20:52] and you know from the testimonies of
[1:20:54] those at the judiciary revival why it
[1:20:55] stopped
[1:20:56] the woman said there was so much pride
[1:20:58] in it and god
[1:21:00] shut it down and then those
[1:21:03] ministers so prideful they said they
[1:21:06] went and started their own denominations
[1:21:07] and what was the one doctrine they went
[1:21:09] up on
[1:21:10] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:21:12] the holy ghost and god
[1:21:14] sends a prophet in right at that time
[1:21:18] and nobody knows what the truth is
[1:21:20] saints of god when i was the nomination
[1:21:21] what's the truth
[1:21:23] i was studying pentecostal stuff i go
[1:21:26] over and talk to baptists and i go check
[1:21:28] the rest of the catholic church out went
[1:21:29] out to other churches whatever this
[1:21:30] church looking for more truth
[1:21:34] i was looking for something greater
[1:21:37] they're preaching about women
[1:21:39] uh marriage money
[1:21:42] uh holidays uh
[1:21:45] program in the churches and i'm thinking
[1:21:47] this is all there is to it
[1:21:51] and it was like that back then too but
[1:21:54] god had to ordain one
[1:21:56] man who would come in
[1:21:59] with the prophet gift and be able to
[1:22:02] discern
[1:22:04] what is truth and what is not
[1:22:07] by the word of god correct but now
[1:22:11] why was it not a moses or a samuel
[1:22:14] anointing
[1:22:16] it was an elijah anointing
[1:22:21] what is different about elijah and
[1:22:24] samuel
[1:22:25] what is different about elijah and moses
[1:22:28] the anointing
[1:22:31] now notice what he does here this is one
[1:22:34] of my favorite sermons called indictment
[1:22:37] some god was looking for one man to call
[1:22:39] this whole thing out
[1:22:41] he says he says no he says you mess this
[1:22:43] baptist protection lutheran pentecost is
[1:22:45] the most holy places there he receives
[1:22:48] his hardest pierces
[1:22:49] a new cavalry what is he doing
[1:22:53] he is pronouncing judgment
[1:22:58] is he bringing grace he's bringing
[1:23:02] condemnation
[1:23:05] where is he crucified at from the
[1:23:07] pastors you hear
[1:23:08] hypocrites you know better than that i'm
[1:23:10] not angry i'm
[1:23:12] but there's something inside me stirring
[1:23:13] it was the spirit of elijah stirring in
[1:23:16] him the holy ghost
[1:23:17] he says god had been thoroughly
[1:23:18] identified among you where did he get
[1:23:20] his spears at
[1:23:21] in his side where did he get his pierces
[1:23:23] on calvary where does he get it today
[1:23:25] in the pulpit he was calling god had to
[1:23:29] find a man
[1:23:31] to call the thing out and he said this
[1:23:34] is wrong this is right
[1:23:42] now why do you have to bring judgment
[1:23:45] prophet was ordained to bring a judgment
[1:23:48] and
[1:23:48] indictment an indictment is a sentence
[1:23:52] has been served
[1:23:54] they've been found guilty in the wanting
[1:23:58] in other words he says it's over
[1:24:03] but why are we still here
[1:24:09] i got a right to bring an indictment
[1:24:11] against this generation
[1:24:12] because as hard as spears points have
[1:24:14] been right from the pulpits
[1:24:16] where they've criticized and said yo go
[1:24:18] out to hear that stuff oh my goodness
[1:24:20] people within this message are
[1:24:21] criticized
[1:24:24] writing a place is supposed to love him
[1:24:28] crown from the audience by scoffers he's
[1:24:30] got a new crown of
[1:24:32] thorns he said scoffers pierced from the
[1:24:34] pulpit crowned by the scoffers
[1:24:36] if is he is he crucified again afresh
[1:24:39] stripped by man-made creeds teachers of
[1:24:42] denomination against his word they
[1:24:44] strip it in shame condemn it
[1:24:48] 1965. america america notice he said he
[1:24:51] says how much longer in 62 he's in
[1:24:53] america how much longer we got
[1:24:55] 1965 he says there's a million miles
[1:24:57] from being a christian country
[1:24:59] i don't even pray for it
[1:25:03] the spirit of god in malachi 4 told
[1:25:06] our our our prophet don't even pray for
[1:25:10] america
[1:25:11] what had taken place
[1:25:14] the indictment was served it was passed
[1:25:18] the gavel went down
[1:25:19] but saints of god why are we still here
[1:25:22] it's 2021
[1:25:25] july 18th why are we still here
[1:25:29] if judgment remember he said what in
[1:25:31] malachi 4-1
[1:25:32] that they will burn as an oven
[1:25:35] but why are we still here
[1:25:41] because god sent elijah the prophet
[1:25:45] and not moses remember shadows and types
[1:25:48] he did not send to moses
[1:25:51] anointing he did not send the same
[1:25:52] anointing he sent an elijah anointing
[1:25:55] and watch this what does the scripture
[1:25:57] say here
[1:25:59] elias was a man subject to like passions
[1:26:02] as we are
[1:26:03] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[1:26:05] reign
[1:26:06] and he prayed not on the earth and it
[1:26:08] rained out on earth for space of three
[1:26:10] years and six months
[1:26:11] he prayed again and heaven gave rain and
[1:26:14] the earth brought forth the rain
[1:26:15] brethren if any man
[1:26:17] if any of you do air from the truth and
[1:26:18] one convert him let him know that he
[1:26:20] which converteth the sinner
[1:26:22] from the air of his way shall save his
[1:26:23] soul from death and hide a multitude of
[1:26:25] sins
[1:26:25] right notice
[1:26:29] these disciples were seeing a man that
[1:26:31] wouldn't follow him
[1:26:33] and they said lord will thou command
[1:26:35] fire come down from heaven that we can
[1:26:37] sue them even as elias did
[1:26:39] he said you don't even know what matter
[1:26:40] of spirit you are
[1:26:43] they were trying to bring an elijah
[1:26:45] spirit at the come first coming of the
[1:26:47] lord
[1:26:47] the elijah's spirit was not until this
[1:26:50] day
[1:26:52] but why are we still here
[1:26:55] the key lies right here
[1:27:00] i'm going to show you a scripture this
[1:27:02] let me tell you something who interceded
[1:27:04] for you did brother branham intercede
[1:27:08] for you
[1:27:11] no i'm going to show you something by
[1:27:14] the grace of god
[1:27:16] who stepped in why is it not burnt
[1:27:20] why are you alive
[1:27:23] i know it's quite crazy question for you
[1:27:26] sister why are you still alive
[1:27:27] why are we here why was i born
[1:27:32] why were you born brother william it's
[1:27:35] 2021.
[1:27:37] 65's already this should have been burnt
[1:27:40] because the indictment already was given
[1:27:44] why are we sitting here
[1:27:50] notice the first elijah
[1:27:55] and it came and as he came through to a
[1:27:58] cave elijah and behold the word of the
[1:28:00] lord came unto him and sent to him what
[1:28:01] thus thou hear elijah
[1:28:03] what does elijah say
[1:28:07] look what elijah said
[1:28:12] he says i've been very jealous for the
[1:28:15] lord
[1:28:15] of god of hosts for the children of
[1:28:18] israel
[1:28:20] have forsaken thy covenant
[1:28:23] thrown dying down thine altars
[1:28:27] and slain thy prophets with the sword
[1:28:29] and i
[1:28:31] the spirit of elijah i i am only alone
[1:28:36] do you think anyone very few people even
[1:28:38] understood the prophet's message even in
[1:28:40] his day
[1:28:43] but notice the spirit of elijah
[1:28:47] did not bring intercession for israel
[1:28:55] he says i and i only have left and they
[1:28:57] seek my life to take it away
[1:29:00] verse 14 he says again he says
[1:29:03] i have been very jealous for the lord
[1:29:05] god thy host because of the children of
[1:29:06] israel forsaken the covenant throw down
[1:29:08] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[1:29:10] sword
[1:29:10] and i and i am left alone he says and
[1:29:12] they seek my life to take it away
[1:29:16] do you see any do you see intercession
[1:29:17] there any mercy or any grace there
[1:29:22] none
[1:29:24] but look what jesus said
[1:29:27] look what god said
[1:29:32] yet elijah
[1:29:36] yet
[1:29:41] i say that hath god cast away his people
[1:29:44] god forbid he says for i also am an
[1:29:46] israelite
[1:29:47] of the seed of abraham here we go saints
[1:29:50] of the tribe of
[1:29:51] benjamin god had not cast away his
[1:29:54] people which he for
[1:29:56] knew what united the scripture stands of
[1:30:00] a lie
[1:30:01] yes elijah
[1:30:05] how he maketh intercession to god
[1:30:07] against
[1:30:08] israel he did not
[1:30:12] make intercession for you the spirit of
[1:30:15] elijah was supposed to
[1:30:17] bring judgment
[1:30:20] not intercession
[1:30:28] he says lord they have killed thy
[1:30:30] prophets and dig down night altars and i
[1:30:31] am left alone to seek my
[1:30:33] i am left alone and and they seek my
[1:30:35] life
[1:30:36] but what did god answer
[1:30:40] i have reserved to myself seven thousand
[1:30:43] men who have not bowed down the knee
[1:30:45] the image of baal even so at this
[1:30:48] present time even so at
[1:30:51] this present time also there is a
[1:30:54] remnant according to the election
[1:30:56] of grace so malachi 4
[1:31:01] according to malachi 4-5 he was a
[1:31:03] prophet
[1:31:04] not of grace
[1:31:07] but what the prophets say he said he
[1:31:08] said
[1:31:11] moses represented the law and elijah
[1:31:14] represented justice
[1:31:18] why do you think the seals had to be
[1:31:20] broken in 1963.
[1:31:26] let me show you this quote look elijah
[1:31:29] never knew
[1:31:30] even one of them that was that way he
[1:31:32] thought he was the only one
[1:31:33] saved until god opened one of the seals
[1:31:38] and showed him the mystery in the book
[1:31:42] why are we still here because god had to
[1:31:45] open the seals
[1:31:47] because judgment was pronounced but to
[1:31:49] save you
[1:31:50] and i god had to open the seals and
[1:31:53] release
[1:31:54] that there was more in the type there
[1:31:56] were 7
[1:31:58] 000 more to be saved hey
[1:32:02] you know why the fire hasn't fallen yet
[1:32:04] saints because your names were sealed up
[1:32:07] in the seven seals and they had to be
[1:32:10] released to stop
[1:32:11] judgment
[1:32:15] that's why you're here today
[1:32:20] there's still more to come how many more
[1:32:23] need save things
[1:32:25] the fire is ready to fall
[1:32:29] but those seals had to be broken
[1:32:32] and those seals contained every name
[1:32:35] that was written from the foundation of
[1:32:37] the earth
[1:32:38] that needed to be saved what was the old
[1:32:41] testament type right here
[1:32:42] brother was talking about elijah right
[1:32:45] back here in the still small voice
[1:32:47] and he said when god spoke back he said
[1:32:49] that was the open of the seventh of the
[1:32:51] first seal
[1:32:52] or the seals
[1:32:55] until god opened one of the seals and
[1:32:57] showed him the mystery what's the
[1:32:58] mystery in the book
[1:33:07] that he had seven hundred seven thousand
[1:33:09] look you messed up on that
[1:33:10] seven hundred to never bow down to the
[1:33:12] creeds in other words
[1:33:14] you're here because you are not going to
[1:33:16] bow down to these denominational creeds
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:19] there are people past 63 they're going
[1:33:21] to be baptized
[1:33:22] they would be able to see and receive
[1:33:24] the baptism in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:26] see the one god had seen the original
[1:33:28] sin see everything and receive the
[1:33:30] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:34] brother you're going to go off the scene
[1:33:38] and i've got a whole bunch more coming
[1:33:40] [Laughter]
[1:33:43] hey man how many has passed you i mean
[1:33:46] we're saying to god
[1:33:47] we're literally the fire's just right up
[1:33:51] there waiting to fall
[1:33:52] but because you are here and you
[1:33:56] were called you were elected
[1:34:03] well maybe maybe it was better that i
[1:34:04] wasn't what you know if i wasn't born
[1:34:06] i've been okay
[1:34:08] if you would never if you would not have
[1:34:09] been born if god brought about that
[1:34:11] stuff right there you would never know
[1:34:12] the joys of salvation
[1:34:14] you would never get to taste eternal
[1:34:17] life
[1:34:19] up there with him as the bride
[1:34:22] he brought forth more bride after
[1:34:25] judgment was passed
[1:34:30] absolutely
[1:34:33] robin said what in the church book he
[1:34:35] says when she knows who she is
[1:34:39] we better start waking up to see who we
[1:34:40] are
[1:34:42] god actually prolonged the judgment of
[1:34:45] elijah
[1:34:46] he said brother brahm here brother
[1:34:47] graham said i see that's wrong that's
[1:34:48] wrong no
[1:34:49] wrong or wrong he's just passed judgment
[1:34:50] done but god said
[1:34:52] you're gonna go off now it's been judged
[1:34:56] it's been judged by a man it's been
[1:34:58] judged by a prophet but there are people
[1:35:00] coming through oh hallelujah
[1:35:03] even though she said thus saith the lord
[1:35:07] god is withholding that word from
[1:35:08] striking
[1:35:10] come and smite the earth with the curse
[1:35:12] that burning praise god
[1:35:18] i'll stand
[1:35:27] do you see who you are i hope that you
[1:35:31] see why we are still here
[1:35:35] it is the grace of god godhead well if i
[1:35:38] was never born
[1:35:40] if you were because you were born
[1:35:44] he wanted you to taste ever
[1:35:48] there is something eternal about you and
[1:35:51] god was not going to let a prophet's
[1:35:53] word stand in the way
[1:35:54] he needed that to happen god
[1:35:58] needed a man to come in and condemn it
[1:36:02] the saints of god who are you
[1:36:07] he's withheld this thing for 40 50 years
[1:36:11] waiting for you to come into position
[1:36:14] saints of god i when this thing opened
[1:36:16] up to you guys
[1:36:20] it makes all the sense you look at these
[1:36:22] sermons
[1:36:23] 63 62 64 65
[1:36:27] judgment judgment judgment then then 63
[1:36:29] brings the opening of the seven seals
[1:36:31] to save us we had to come forward
[1:36:35] because we were eternal
[1:36:37] you can't stop eternal
[1:36:41] if even the prophet could not stop
[1:36:43] eternal
[1:36:46] eternal will come forward and you
[1:36:49] are eternal it proves that we're
[1:36:52] that's why we're still here because you
[1:36:54] are eternal god cannot
[1:36:56] burn you hey man
[1:36:59] oh praise god i just to me i know that
[1:37:03] was kind of long and
[1:37:04] drawn out whatever i'm telling you
[1:37:05] what's saying to god if you catch who
[1:37:07] you are if you understand why this thing
[1:37:09] took place
[1:37:09] the reason why things hit at certain
[1:37:11] times and why we're still saints of god
[1:37:14] that's who you are it was for you god
[1:37:17] interceding for you this time
[1:37:20] it wasn't a moses it wasn't a man but
[1:37:23] one came off the throne named jesus
[1:37:25] christ hallelujah
[1:37:26] and what he was the one that stood in
[1:37:28] the gap
[1:37:29] in the breach for us today amen
[1:37:33] oh hallelujah
[1:37:37] god that natural israel
[1:37:42] being received by a natural man but
[1:37:45] spiritual israel
[1:37:48] there's only one man in heaven on earth
[1:37:51] that was worthy to take that and he
[1:37:55] interceded for us
[1:37:59] praise god let's just praise him praise
[1:38:00] praising hater
[1:38:02] hallelujah we love you lord oh we love
[1:38:04] you lord jesus thank you lord god so
[1:38:05] much

[1:38:10] lord
[1:38:12] amen thank you lord
[1:38:19] i know i took a long way around it but i
[1:38:23] i just thought that thought he just came
[1:38:25] to me i
[1:38:26] you asked your pastor that's correct or
[1:38:27] not but i'll tell you what scene
[1:38:29] that's how i see it god is so good
[1:38:32] he is so good he had to make sure you
[1:38:36] were going to
[1:38:36] be in heaven he's going to make sure you
[1:38:38] make this rapture
[1:38:41] but now he wants to use you because
[1:38:44] there's
[1:38:44] probably more names there see otherwise
[1:38:46] we'd be gone
[1:38:48] so now as god has revealed the grace to
[1:38:51] us
[1:38:52] let us go out into the fields and find
[1:38:55] those other names that were released
[1:38:57] under the seven seals
[1:39:01] there's more otherwise we'd be gone
[1:39:04] there's more saints more brothers
[1:39:05] more sisters more people that have that
[1:39:08] that will hear this word and catch it
[1:39:10] are there a few there's few
[1:39:14] but remember jesus said he'll lose he'll
[1:39:16] leave the 99 to go get that one
[1:39:18] may god use each one of you to go find
[1:39:21] one wall
[1:39:23] amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[1:39:26] father lord jesus so we love you
[1:39:29] and lord jesus certainly lord
[1:39:33] you are worthy and we are so grateful to
