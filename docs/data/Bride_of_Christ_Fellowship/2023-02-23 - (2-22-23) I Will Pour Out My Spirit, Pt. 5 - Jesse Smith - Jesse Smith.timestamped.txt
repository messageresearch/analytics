[27:37] with several like my father-in-law which
[27:40] is a minister
[27:41] and another Minister and
[27:45] others
[27:47] that God's love never changes
[27:50] you know

[27:57] acts the ask a bird they never change
[28:01] singing
[28:02] they sing
[28:04] you know
[28:06] all nature does the same thing

[28:12] you know when we fall we make mistakes
[28:17] does his love lessons you know
[28:20] his love is eternal you know why because

[28:33] what
[28:34] and
[28:37] that's this whole week I've been
[28:39] dwelling on that
[28:40] his love hasn't changed
[28:43] in the valley
[28:44] love is the same
[28:46] up in the mountain
[28:51] you know the bursts continue singing
[28:53] every day
[28:55] they sing they haven't changed their
[28:57] tune
[28:59] you know
[29:01] the howling of a wolf hasn't changed
[29:06] neither has God's love God bless you all
[29:27] let's go to Acts chapter 2.
[29:30] verse 4.
[29:36] this is definitely a verse we want to
[29:38] memorize praise God
[29:47] Acts 2 verse 4. I'm going to get there
[29:49] as well
[29:51] how many were just so blessed by the
[29:52] weekend Services praise God
[29:55] we're so blessed listen to uh the
[29:57] morning service a couple times there
[29:59] again really really was blessed by that
[30:08] Acts chapter 2 verse 4 praise God
[30:13] let's read that on three ready one two
[30:15] three and they were all filled with the
[30:18] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[30:21] tongues as the spirit gave them
[30:24] utterance
[30:25] now let's go to chapter five here by
[30:28] God's grace this verses kind of came to
[30:31] my mind here
[30:35] verse 32 acts 5 32.
[30:41] so here we see again the conditions of
[30:43] how God pours out his spirit
[30:45] after we obey praise God
[30:49] verse 32 let's read that ready one two
[30:52] three and we are his Witnesses of these
[30:55] things and so is also the Holy Ghost
[30:58] whom God hath given to them that obey
[31:02] him so simple praise God let's buy our
[31:04] heads for one more word of prayer
[31:05] Heavenly Father we thank you God for the
[31:07] word of God we read tonight we're coming
[31:09] off some wonderful Services God and I
[31:11] just pray God you Quicken your word

[31:14] opportunity to feed on your word
[31:16] Lord I remember what was preached on
[31:17] Sunday I thank you Lord God Lord and if
[31:20] we don't that's okay Lord because your
[31:21] grace is sufficient for this hour
[31:24] you see your people have made an
[31:25] opportunity they've made the effort to
[31:27] come out to the house of God they've
[31:29] obeyed your word by coming out here to
[31:30] the house of God lord surely you'll pour
[31:32] out a portion of your spirit upon each

[31:40] me Lord as your vessel and Bless the
[31:42] people Lord use them as well Lord if
[31:43] there's testimonies if there's
[31:45] intercessory prayer if there's a word of
[31:47] knowledge if there's a discernment Lord
[31:48] I pray God by the Holy Spirit you'll
[31:51] Minister now in Jesus Christ's name and
[31:53] Saint said amen God bless you as you're
[31:55] being seated praise God
[31:58] a few uh
[32:00] a few quotes to show here by God's grace
[32:09] so yeah we're so thankful for Sunday and
[32:11] appreciate brother Cam and his family
[32:12] being here
[32:14] I was just so blessed
[32:16] um
[32:19] you know I was fellowshipping there with
[32:20] brother Chris and brother Cam and
[32:21] brother Chris was saying you know there
[32:23] was so there was numerous things brother
[32:24] cam was saying that brother Chris was
[32:26] thinking
[32:28] and before
[32:30] and right after brother Chris thought it
[32:32] brother cam would say what he was
[32:33] thinking
[32:35] and I looked at for the camera and I
[32:36] said as he looked at Chris I said
[32:37] brother that's the spirit of discernment
[32:40] discernment is judging the thoughts and
[32:42] intents of your heart
[32:44] right
[32:45] now how many elves felt like something
[32:47] you were meditating on God spoke to you
[32:49] on Sunday
[32:50] well look at that
[32:51] so I told Brother cam I said look
[32:53] brother cam I said there's one of the
[32:54] nine gifts operating right there in our
[32:55] minutes
[32:56] right and even while he went up for
[32:58] prayer brother Chris went up for prayer
[33:00] and he said I have this unspoken need
[33:02] and cam prayed the exact thing that he
[33:04] was battling
[33:06] Cam said the Lord just brought it to me
[33:08] my church says that happened to us
[33:09] before of course
[33:11] but it's just a great reminder that
[33:13] Jesus is here praise God
[33:15] that's what I was trying to just
[33:16] encourage all the saints you know the
[33:18] gifts of God operate often very often
[33:21] we just got to be able to Humble humble
[33:23] ourselves really and recognize them
[33:25] praise God like that one time when Lena
[33:28] prayed for my wife and that was just
[33:29] what she needed you know but brother
[33:31] amen needed someone to pray for him and
[33:33] sister Hua and prayed for him and that
[33:35] was a direct answer to brother amen's
[33:37] request you know so many examples we
[33:39] could give right of different ones when
[33:41] God speaks to us
[33:42] when God's ministering to us it's such a
[33:45] wonderful thing it's such a blessing
[33:46] it's a confirmation of his love to us
[33:49] Hallelujah and so I believe many of
[33:53] those nine gifts operate amongst us
[33:55] quite often
[33:56] and we just got to look at each and
[33:57] every testimony when we look at every
[33:59] testimony we could we can by God's grace
[34:01] said if you're not sure he said think on
[34:02] it for a while
[34:03] he said make think on these things real
[34:06] deep and he said you'll see which one it
[34:07] is by God's grace I believe that so I'm
[34:10] just very thankful for that and there's
[34:12] numerous things you know in did you see
[34:14] how brother Cameron was preaching on
[34:15] Peter and how he you know he would be
[34:17] anointed and then Fall Away anointed
[34:19] Fall Away even after he got the Holy
[34:21] Ghost
[34:22] and how many times have I mentioned that
[34:23] the last few weeks
[34:24] you know with
[34:26] discriminating against the Gentiles
[34:28] think about that discriminating Holy
[34:30] Ghost for men discriminating against the
[34:32] entire race of people
[34:34] yet he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[34:35] and then brother cam comes in here he's
[34:37] like I don't know why I'm preaching on
[34:38] this
[34:39] well I knew I was preaching on it right
[34:42] it's to confirm what God has been
[34:44] telling us praise God and then to take
[34:46] us higher right each sermon takes us one
[34:47] step higher if we'll receive it
[34:49] Hallelujah so I'm very thankful you know
[34:52] uh and as he said in the sermon he was
[34:54] led to preach by inspiration none of
[34:56] those things were really in his notes
[34:57] just a few things were in his notes
[35:00] so that tells me it seems the Holy
[35:02] Spirit wanted us to overcome any guilt
[35:04] any shame any doubts that we're saved
[35:09] right any doubts were born again if we
[35:11] really have a real genuine experience
[35:12] right
[35:13] and then as I'm preaching through this
[35:14] I'm sure the holy spirit will bring some
[35:16] of the subjects like I said I was so
[35:17] blessed I told Brother cam afterwards
[35:19] I'm like I probably got 10 sermons off
[35:21] of your your sermon if I can just take
[35:23] the time to go back and listen to him
[35:25] so by God's grace like one of them was
[35:27] you know Adam went and hid where I
[35:29] thought well I could preach a whole
[35:30] sermon on that all the different people
[35:32] that hid from God
[35:34] think about that Believers I'm talking
[35:36] about believers
[35:38] and now what about you and I when we
[35:39] hide from God
[35:42] is it is it because we're so good we go
[35:44] back to God it's the same thing as Adam
[35:45] God
[35:48] is that right church that's just one
[35:51] I could call Isolation part five hiding
[35:53] from God right Adam and Eve isolated
[35:57] themselves from the presence of God
[35:58] so you see how I mean the word of God is
[36:01] just it's unending praise God but I just
[36:03] want to I want to keep on this just for
[36:04] a few moments and since brother Ray's
[36:06] here you know I just want to just
[36:07] briefly review this uh this age started
[36:10] with the second greatest Holy Ghost
[36:11] outpouring of all time
[36:15] the day of Pentecost was the greatest
[36:17] brother Adam said Azusa Street he said
[36:19] was the second greatest
[36:21] now think about that it was greater than
[36:24] Nineveh when two when a quarter of a
[36:25] million people repented their sins
[36:28] right think about that 3 000 souls in
[36:31] the day of Pentecost that was greater
[36:33] than a quarter million because there was
[36:35] greater power with the New Testament
[36:37] Hallelujah it was more than just
[36:39] repenting of sins it was actually
[36:40] repentance sanctification and the
[36:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God
[36:45] Hallelujah
[36:46] and then God anoints a one-eyed black
[36:48] man I had two eyes but he couldn't see
[36:50] out of one of them right couldn't see
[36:51] how the left I got anointed a one-eyed
[36:53] man a poor beggar man and through his
[36:57] love for God brings forth the second
[36:59] greatest Revival this world's ever seen
[37:01] Hallelujah now how many would say you're
[37:04] a part of that by God's grace amen
[37:06] absolutely what has what has brought you
[37:09] from death to life
[37:10] what brought you from the death of not
[37:12] really caring what the god or the
[37:14] message or the truth what brought you
[37:16] out of death and now you care so much
[37:17] you'll come on a Wednesday night after
[37:19] working hard all day praise God and some
[37:21] of you feeling sick and having flu
[37:23] symptoms you'll still come to the house
[37:25] of God whether you're rich or poor
[37:26] whether you're you're healthy or not
[37:28] healthy you'll come to God's house and
[37:29] give him praise amen what did that the
[37:32] love of God hallelujah the Revival that
[37:34] God started in your heart praise God
[37:38] and so it's a great thing we went
[37:39] through all the many of the details
[37:40] there
[37:42] but just you know just I just want to
[37:44] briefly say you know this was God doing
[37:47] a work and and God wanted to draw an eye
[37:49] to them so God Drew Seymour God Drew all
[37:52] those people unto him
[37:54] there's no man that seeks God
[37:58] right none of us seek after God God
[38:00] comes seeking after us praise God
[38:02] and so all these people did in Ebony
[38:04] Revival all they did was draw an eye to
[38:07] God because God was drawing them
[38:09] all they did was say Okay God you're
[38:12] drawing me I'll draw an eye to you too
[38:14] I feel I feel this pull I feel you
[38:17] wanted me to do this so I'll do this
[38:19] they just yielded to God's drawing
[38:21] Hallelujah and church that's what God's
[38:23] doing today God drew two people from
[38:26] Arizona right
[38:28] Hallelujah God drew our sister back
[38:30] after 12 years amen you God God Drew her
[38:33] back God drew me to him after running
[38:35] for 19 years amen
[38:37] I shouldn't say all 19 but you know
[38:39] because I wasn't even aware the first
[38:40] few years there was God you know
[38:42] 17 or 16 or whatever years you know we
[38:45] all the Bible said we're all born in sin
[38:47] shaping an iniquity come to the world
[38:49] speaking lies praise God but then God
[38:51] has a time and season where he Woos us
[38:54] he draws Us in love and we respond to
[38:56] his invitation and we start drawing
[38:58] close to him praise God
[39:00] Hallelujah
[39:02] because there will be no one that God
[39:04] will share his glory with God will not
[39:06] share his glory with any person praise
[39:07] God there'll be no boasts in her
[39:09] bragging in heaven praise God now I'm
[39:12] going to end with this there will be
[39:13] rewards but there won't be any bragging
[39:15] on that either praise God
[39:16] because it was all just responding to
[39:19] God's drawing and then once God drew
[39:21] them God gave them the power the ability
[39:23] God gave them the gifts they're God's
[39:25] talents those were God's abilities that
[39:27] was God's strength those are God's
[39:29] spirit moving that's all God hallelujah
[39:33] and the person just yielded to God
[39:36] okay now remember Church there are six
[39:39] kinds of Revival
[39:40] and this is important that we'll see in
[39:42] just a few moments I'm going to try to
[39:44] go through these uh briefly but there's
[39:46] National revivals we'll look at
[39:47] America's had at least two national
[39:49] revivals at least two maybe three
[39:52] um the church age Revival is those seven
[39:55] spirits that brother cam was talking
[39:57] about right he talked about the four
[39:58] guards but there's actually seven Spears
[40:00] Before the Throne of God
[40:01] and each spear represents the Holy Ghost
[40:04] going down to the world for each Church
[40:06] age
[40:08] and then that Spirit anoints a messenger
[40:10] preaches the message delivers a message
[40:12] and then he teaches Faithful Men and
[40:14] then other Faithful Men take that
[40:16] message around the world
[40:18] and that's the church age Revival
[40:20] Hallelujah and so if you're born again
[40:23] you are a part of that church age
[40:25] Revival praise God because the church
[40:27] age Revival never ends praise God in
[40:29] fact when this one ends it'll be the
[40:31] Rapture praise God
[40:33] because he that's holy is Holy still
[40:35] praise God
[40:37] he that's righteous is righteous still
[40:38] so we are and this is the Revival
[40:40] brother Adam said our Revival has been
[40:42] going on for 15 20 years and it's never
[40:44] stopped it was more than Divine Healing
[40:46] it was Soul healing praise God
[40:49] Hallelujah
[40:51] so that's the church age Revival is the
[40:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost from the
[40:55] spirit of God the spirit of God for each
[40:58] and every Church Hallelujah
[41:00] that's right
[41:01] now the latter rain I believe is still
[41:03] to come some people believe it's falling
[41:05] now I don't believe that I believe the
[41:06] latter rain is rapturing Faith it's the
[41:08] faith we receive right before the
[41:10] Rapture that's what I believe doesn't
[41:11] matter if I'm wrong or not because some
[41:13] rain's falling on us right now and it's
[41:15] the Holy Spirit rain praise God so
[41:17] whether I'm wrong in a slight of rain or
[41:19] whether I'm right in this form of rain
[41:20] it doesn't really matter as long as the
[41:22] rain has fallen on the right seed it's
[41:24] going to produce the right fruit praise
[41:26] God Amen praise God Hallelujah
[41:30] so it's not a it's not a point of major
[41:32] contention to me the fact is Lord Let It
[41:36] Rain On Me
[41:37] don't let me dry out praise God
[41:40] don't let me a starve for water keep me
[41:43] moist keep me producing fruit praise God
[41:46] don't let my leaves wither so people
[41:48] can't come and have Fellowship under my
[41:50] my leaves
[41:52] I don't want people to find stickers
[41:53] there and get poked by my by my flesh
[41:56] and by a bad attitude I want them to
[41:58] find leaves that are fresh I want them
[42:00] to find shade I want them to find
[42:01] Comfort I want the Divine words of love
[42:04] amen
[42:06] I want them to find words of
[42:07] encouragement like I really appreciate
[42:09] you sister keep going strong God's going
[42:11] to bless you God's with you praise God
[42:13] hallelujah God's blessing is right
[42:14] around the corner praise God you know
[42:16] just want to encourage people keep them
[42:18] uh satisfied in the things of God
[42:21] hallelujah
[42:23] now the sole Revival of course is the
[42:24] personal one-time Revival
[42:27] the soul is quick and the Bible said
[42:29] it's quick and in Ephesians chapter two
[42:31] we were dead in sins but then we're
[42:33] quickened with Christ
[42:35] okay that kind of ties you with a church
[42:37] age Revival but
[42:39] but it's on the individual level the
[42:41] personal level
[42:42] now this is what's happening in Asbury
[42:44] as far as understanding all the other
[42:46] churches they're having a human Spirit
[42:48] Revival
[42:49] right because brother Adam says a soul
[42:52] that is quick and says Amen to every
[42:54] word of God
[42:56] right and so if you told one of those
[42:57] people you know women you shouldn't wear
[42:58] pants especially sexy pants like you got
[43:00] on tight pants a real believer would say
[43:03] Amen
[43:04] right so we know we know they don't have
[43:07] the Soul Revival they don't have any of
[43:09] these it's not National this is the best
[43:11] they could have and it's even few out of
[43:13] those people
[43:15] right that are having Revival because
[43:17] Jesus said if you there be that find it
[43:19] right
[43:21] but Church you and I also need this
[43:23] daily Revival
[43:25] in other words when you leave here you
[43:27] should have a fresh love for God
[43:31] you should feel more determined to be
[43:33] faithful to God tomorrow praise God
[43:36] you should be more determined not to let
[43:39] up on God this week praise God
[43:41] Hallelujah you should be more excited
[43:43] about listening to the sermon again or
[43:45] don't listen to Sundays again or you
[43:47] should have a greater hunger for the
[43:48] things of God if not you start dying out
[43:52] we got to be revived God make it fresh
[43:54] again make it new again feed my soul
[43:56] lord I want to meditate on the things of
[43:58] God make it new praise God
[44:01] revive me
[44:03] and of course the last one is uh
[44:05] resurrecting from the dead the physical
[44:07] Revival and that's according to Romans
[44:09] 14. now
[44:12] again a little bit more on the Asbury
[44:13] Revival I put that video out on Saturday
[44:15] I've got some good feedback and some
[44:16] negative feedback we'll skip past uh
[44:20] yeah I'll get to this in a moment I
[44:21] actually did a podcast about it as well
[44:23] just a really short one if you're
[44:24] interested in that but now what's the
[44:26] sad part though is some message
[44:28] Believers are making themselves God or
[44:30] the judge over all these revivals and
[44:31] they say they they're saying nobody can
[44:33] get saved in them
[44:35] what a bunch of nonsense now Church
[44:37] they're close to blaspheming the Holy
[44:38] Ghost
[44:39] if God Saves one person out of there and
[44:42] they say there's no revivals of the
[44:43] devil they just blasting the Holy Ghost
[44:48] see and they're they're exalting
[44:50] themselves like they know the thoughts
[44:52] and intents how can they know the
[44:53] thoughts and intents of every heart
[44:55] there
[44:56] they can't they're not God
[44:58] right
[45:00] and they fail to acknowledge and this is
[45:01] what I did on the video I showed five or
[45:03] six Brothers quotes where brother Adam
[45:05] says he said if a Catholic is trusting
[45:07] in Jesus he's saved
[45:11] right
[45:12] he says if a Lutheran a Methodist that's
[45:15] good is trusting in Jesus he said
[45:17] they're saved because we're saved by
[45:19] grace Hallelujah
[45:21] now a few of them are because a lot of
[45:23] them are trusting in the pope my brother
[45:24] Adam said God's got children in all of
[45:26] out there in all those systems
[45:31] what do you do with those quotes well
[45:32] now now you see what they've done is
[45:34] they made themselves God they made
[45:35] themselves the savior they made
[45:37] themselves the next prophet and they're
[45:38] not Prophets hey man they're not right
[45:43] and so see they they think there's
[45:45] something when they're not
[45:47] okay and then they don't recognize all
[45:49] these different kinds of revivals that
[45:51] the Bible plainly teaches
[45:53] there's Bible examples for every single
[45:55] one of those
[45:56] Josiah had a national Revival Hezekiah
[45:58] had a national Revival Solomon had a
[46:00] national Revival for a while until he
[46:01] fell away with his thousand wives
[46:03] right
[46:04] yeah they they had National revivals
[46:08] okay
[46:09] but see you know I have friends that
[46:12] know friends that are at the Revival
[46:14] and friends that had similar friends
[46:17] and some of these people are genuine
[46:19] Christians
[46:21] now they're not fully Sanctified but
[46:23] they're beyond Justified and they have
[46:25] cleaned out some of their lives
[46:28] because I met them
[46:31] and so and if you do that then you do
[46:33] away with the foolish virgins if you say
[46:36] nobody's getting saved in there you've
[46:37] done away with the foolish virgins
[46:40] you're breaking the word then
[46:42] yeah but a real Holy Ghost to a person
[46:44] doesn't break the word he believes the
[46:46] word amen
[46:47] that's right see the foolishness of
[46:49] people to make statements like like they
[46:52] like they know everything God's in
[46:54] control
[46:55] even if one Soul gets saved out of there
[46:57] that one had an individual Revival
[47:00] of the human spirit
[47:03] right he said I'll give you a new heart
[47:04] a new spirit my spirit well they
[47:06] probably won't get to my spirit right
[47:08] unless they received a message and get
[47:10] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:11] Christ and sanctify their lives and cut
[47:13] off the TV cut off the evil videos on
[47:15] their phone I mean they probably won't
[47:17] get it praise God but at least they
[47:18] could get Justified and Sanctified amen
[47:21] or a little bit of sanctification
[47:25] now I just want to read this here
[47:26] brother this is the quote brother says
[47:28] America will never have a national
[47:29] Revival
[47:30] smoking cigarettes hybrid is Right
[47:33] hybrid they don't even know whether
[47:35] they're a man or woman now he said this
[47:36] in 1960.
[47:39] and now we got people today don't even
[47:40] know if they're a man or woman and they
[47:42] have surgeries to change uh their
[47:44] identities and brother bran was basing
[47:46] that just on the length of the hair as
[47:49] he says you can hardly tell what sex
[47:50] they belong to by looking at them and
[47:52] listening to them that's true friend I'm
[47:53] not saying that about you as a Christian
[47:55] woman my voice is going around many
[47:57] nations it's but it's a hybrid this
[47:59] America has become condemned and what
[48:01] did she do according to the vision she
[48:02] elected the wrong person JFK I don't
[48:04] know how long it'll take to run out but
[48:06] it will be someday thus saith the Lord
[48:08] it will she's on her downward move right
[48:10] now she'll never come back again she's
[48:12] gone that's right she's been gone since
[48:14] 1956 when she condemned and turned away
[48:16] God from the great Revival hours now
[48:19] 1956 was 50 years from 1906. what's 50
[48:23] years Jubilee
[48:25] right so brother Adam says there was a
[48:27] spiritual Jubilee available in 1956 if
[48:30] you study history that's your Elvis
[48:31] Presley rose up to fame
[48:35] that was the year and that's the Year
[48:37] rock and roll took over shortly after
[48:38] that the Beatles Rolling Stones and it's
[48:40] just been total satanic chaos ever since
[48:43] but that's a year America is going to
[48:45] turn back but they chose it Judas
[48:46] Iscariot they chose a Barabbas rather
[48:49] than Christ
[48:50] right and that's that's about the Year
[48:52] brother man I started going down less
[48:53] invitations but really in the spiritual
[48:55] he was going up amen hallelujah because
[48:58] he still had to open the seals he said
[48:59] to preach marriage and divorce anoint
[49:01] the ones of the end times praise God
[49:02] what's the attraction on the mountain he
[49:04] started to preach all these wonderful
[49:06] messages these Revelations he had to
[49:08] finish the mystery of God but even
[49:09] though America's on the way down the
[49:11] bride's on the way up praise God
[49:15] now the U.S has had at least two
[49:18] national revivals
[49:20] now the first one was before we were
[49:22] actually officially a nation Jonathan
[49:24] Edwards and George Whitefield
[49:27] and I don't have much on them but I took
[49:30] out all the details I just kind of cut
[49:31] their names out
[49:33] but
[49:34] what was shown was that the majority of
[49:37] people in the U.S were churchgoers after
[49:40] the Revival happened
[49:41] before the Revival there was a a smaller
[49:44] percentage but after the Revival most
[49:46] people got back into church
[49:48] through the preaching of the word of God
[49:50] in fact history says Jonathan Edwards
[49:52] was the first he was the first celebrity
[49:55] in America
[49:57] because he preached such powerful
[49:59] messages the people would flock there
[50:01] and of course that would be a good thing
[50:03] if he's preaching salvation
[50:05] praise God
[50:06] and the second one came in 1800 to 1840
[50:09] James McCready and you probably know
[50:11] Charles Finn he's called the father of
[50:12] Revival
[50:14] just prayer dedication to God's devotion
[50:18] now I don't know if 1906 was a national
[50:20] Revival or not I don't know if it went
[50:23] around the nation from coast to coast
[50:26] was very likely very likely it was the
[50:28] second greatest outpouring
[50:30] but I haven't read that so I don't know
[50:33] for sure
[50:34] but brother Adam said anyway whether it
[50:36] was or not brother man said 50 years
[50:37] later they had a chance to get it back
[50:39] and they turned it down
[50:41] America turn it down
[50:43] okay
[50:46] and I think I showed you the stats by
[50:47] 2030
[50:49] um
[50:50] uh it'll finally be the spot where uh
[50:53] the majority of people will not be
[50:54] Believers in God in America
[50:56] on the pace that it's at now less and
[50:58] less people are believing in God it's
[50:59] finally going down until finally
[51:01] Believers in God will for the first time
[51:03] ever be a minority in this nation
[51:07] because of the Godless Society because
[51:09] people are not coming to God anymore
[51:11] they're not hearing the preaching
[51:12] they're not uh they're not feeding on
[51:14] the things of God they're lovers of
[51:16] their own selves more than lovers of God
[51:19] Hallelujah now I want to look into this
[51:22] revival a little bit so just bear with
[51:23] me here the Welsh Revival from 1904 to
[51:25] 1906. now this I say question mark was a
[51:28] national Revival some people say it was
[51:30] others say it wasn't so I just wrote a
[51:33] question mark I personally believe it
[51:34] looks like it was a national Revival
[51:37] so there's there's the man uh who's most
[51:39] associated for the Revival Evan Roberts
[51:42] now remember this was the Revival that
[51:45] friends of William Seymour went and and
[51:48] sailed across the ocean to learn how to
[51:51] have Revival
[51:52] and church remember what that key was
[51:54] praying in your home
[51:56] house prayer meetings yeah
[51:58] Hallelujah
[51:59] that's the key in other words praying to
[52:01] God in love having more as brother Camp
[52:04] said more communion with God Amen
[52:07] Hallelujah
[52:10] and he's got he's got a really wonderful
[52:12] history he's raised by Godly Parents he
[52:15] was so devoted to God he never got
[52:16] married
[52:17] because he knew God had called him just
[52:19] to be an uh revivalist
[52:21] he knew it he never just who does that
[52:24] remind you Saint Paul
[52:27] St Paul
[52:29] he never got married
[52:30] because he knew God had called me and he
[52:32] tried working in Coal Mines he tried
[52:34] working in different places and all the
[52:35] economy went down and so he had prayed
[52:37] all these years he had visions of Jesus
[52:39] and then when all the economy went down
[52:41] he was forced just to go uh to the
[52:44] Christian college and become a minister
[52:46] but then that's where he really started
[52:48] seeking God so see how God works
[52:50] everything out in your life
[52:52] God may have the economy go down to put
[52:54] you at the right position
[52:56] or God may have the economy go up to put
[52:58] you in the right position
[52:59] right in other words God has ordered
[53:01] your footsteps God's going to do
[53:03] something with your life and if you just
[53:05] yield to it then God will be well
[53:06] pleased praise God
[53:08] is a plan for every life praise God and
[53:11] the thing to do is just surrender to his
[53:13] will praise God how do you know it's his
[53:14] will because it aligns with the word of
[53:16] God hallelujah
[53:17] very simple it's usually more simple
[53:20] than we think really
[53:22] God's will is usually way more simple
[53:24] than what we think it would be
[53:27] right
[53:28] oh so what was Paul let's look at Paul
[53:30] what was his will what was God's will
[53:31] for him to be a light to the Gentiles
[53:35] Church what if your desire what if
[53:37] you're calling is be a light to your
[53:38] family
[53:42] what if that's your call would you be
[53:43] happy with that
[53:45] Hallelujah
[53:46] or would you get mad at God for that no
[53:49] Paul Paul just said okay Lord I'm Yours
[53:51] help me to Die daily praise God help me
[53:54] to Die daily so I can be a light praise
[53:56] God
[54:00] but he had a calling from God seems like
[54:03] from the womb to bring this revival
[54:06] now these this is what their services
[54:07] were like they had powerful preaching
[54:10] intense prayer and sometimes uh that
[54:13] should be uninhibited I'm sorry I forgot
[54:15] to it's not inhibited it's uninhibited
[54:18] sorry forgive me I forgot the U.N there
[54:20] yeah it's uninhibited Worship in other
[54:23] words you don't care what anybody thinks
[54:24] you're just going to worship God Amen
[54:26] you're going to let the praise flow
[54:28] you're gonna let the Holy Spirit flow
[54:30] out of you praise God Amen
[54:32] now it actually started uh in another
[54:35] location at a different Church the
[54:37] pastor was named Jenkins
[54:39] in the spring of 1904. now Evan Roberts
[54:43] didn't get into it until later in
[54:45] September
[54:46] but here's how it started they're having
[54:49] Youth meetings and one humble little
[54:51] teenager stood up and said crying I love
[54:54] the Lord Jesus with all my heart
[54:58] and the whole church
[54:59] wept
[55:03] that started Revival
[55:07] that's why I like brother Ray's
[55:08] testimony
[55:09] God's love will never fail you
[55:11] just Simplicity God loves you
[55:15] a teenager stood up God was going to
[55:17] take his gospel to this entire nation
[55:19] and who to use a humble little town like
[55:21] Mary praise God
[55:24] humble little teenager all she did was
[55:27] surrender to the Holy Spirit and say
[55:28] Lord Jesus just tell everybody I love
[55:30] the Lord Jesus with all my heart
[55:34] and then the next week more youth came
[55:36] to the meeting next week more and more
[55:38] and more
[55:39] pretty soon these youth meetings started
[55:41] growing
[55:42] that's how it started
[55:44] nothing big nothing big but that's big
[55:47] right you understand nothing big to the
[55:49] world standards but to God that's great
[55:51] praise God
[55:52] because what did Jesus say the greatest
[55:54] commandment is love the Lord your God
[55:56] with all your heart soul mind and
[55:57] strength don't hold anything back love
[55:59] God with everything you've got
[56:00] Hallelujah
[56:03] producer Revival
[56:06] in other words all the people in the
[56:08] church
[56:09] recognized I want to love the Lord with
[56:11] all my heart
[56:13] in fact in other words all the people
[56:14] realize I'm coming to church but I'm not
[56:16] really loving God with all my heart
[56:18] I don't think that's the case here
[56:19] because some of you have stood the test
[56:21] of time you've been saved Sanctified
[56:23] filled with the Holy Ghost God's used
[56:24] you in gifts
[56:26] but I love the humility of just coming
[56:28] back to your first love
[56:30] for us it would be that it would be us
[56:32] just coming back to our first love
[56:36] I'm never going to take anything away
[56:37] from your Christian experience
[56:39] because if you're still here after all
[56:40] this preaching all this singing if
[56:42] you're still here you've got a real
[56:43] experience praise God hallelujah
[56:46] amen the Gates of Hell could not Prevail
[56:49] against your Revelation amen who gave it
[56:52] to you your father in Heaven amen I
[56:54] didn't give it to you nobody gave it to
[56:56] you God gave it to you praise God
[57:02] so in these meetings it was really
[57:03] started by a lot of teenage girls
[57:07] you see you little sisters now look at
[57:10] they're little girls right now look at
[57:11] this one two they're just four five
[57:12] right there in a row now here let's fast
[57:14] forward 10 years
[57:15] we're gonna have this row and they're
[57:17] all gonna be teenagers or maybe Beyond
[57:19] adults
[57:20] having already 11 right
[57:22] I always forget
[57:24] one of these days I'll I'll get your
[57:25] your ages
[57:27] but a whole nation was impacted because
[57:30] teenage girls
[57:32] started singing
[57:34] praying and testifying about Jesus's
[57:38] love
[57:39] and it attracted people
[57:42] Hallelujah
[57:45] this is the kind of service they'd have
[57:47] they would just break out in Praise
[57:49] like I love in our church when somebody
[57:51] would just shout in the spirit
[57:53] and it wasn't planned
[57:55] except by God
[57:57] right I love that or someone will just
[58:00] come up for prayer and I didn't even
[58:01] call for a prayer line you know you can
[58:03] do that
[58:05] Hallelujah you know this altar is open
[58:07] church I'm gonna have to buy an open
[58:09] sign right I'm gonna buy open sign I'll
[58:12] plug it in and before service I'll pull
[58:13] on that click open open open
[58:18] how about that
[58:21] God loves spontaneous things
[58:24] when you're following the leadership of
[58:26] the Holy Spirit
[58:27] Hallelujah God loves spontaneity
[58:30] spontaneity there it is sorry
[58:32] someone would come for prayer without
[58:34] even being asked
[58:36] and this is what the pastor said the
[58:37] eyes of all are filled with tears when
[58:40] the girls pray girls
[58:44] so Azusa was one man
[58:46] William Seymour with a few family with a
[58:48] few couples
[58:50] but Wales was young girls
[58:53] teenagers
[58:55] it looks like we got a pretty good
[58:57] opportunity to have a Revival here
[58:59] we have a lot of teenage girls here in
[59:01] about five or six years Hallelujah
[59:06] it would either it would be their
[59:07] generation Revival it'd be their Church
[59:08] age Revival
[59:11] because remember you can have a Revival
[59:12] of just 12.
[59:14] sure Hallelujah the Ephesian Church
[59:16] started with just 12 got the Holy Ghost
[59:19] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[59:20] you believe we didn't even know there
[59:21] was a holy ghost all we knew was Jesus
[59:23] was died for us he's resurrected he's
[59:26] alive that's all we know he said what
[59:27] were you baptized unto John's he said be
[59:30] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:31] and when Paul laid their hands on them
[59:33] they spoke in tongues and prophesied
[59:36] amen oh one of these days the Holy Ghost
[59:39] is going to fall on our little ones
[59:40] praise God hopefully on our old ones too
[59:43] amen our young ones are middle-aged all
[59:45] of us is what I'm saying
[59:48] Glory
[59:54] the girls would read psalms
[59:57] and then they would ask for certain
[59:58] songs to Be Sung
[1:00:01] history says drunkards came into the
[1:00:04] services left they came in mocking they
[1:00:07] left out praising God
[1:00:11] and I love this what they said it was
[1:00:14] always easy to pray and preach it like
[1:00:16] tonight it's really easy to preach
[1:00:18] I don't feel anything withhold of me
[1:00:20] because we had such good services on
[1:00:21] Sunday
[1:00:22] so y'all must got the Revival these last
[1:00:24] few days huh Hallelujah
[1:00:26] Glory
[1:00:28] it's easy to pray now that's the thing
[1:00:30] easy to pray now let's be honest about
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:33] I'm now just think about the battles we
[1:00:35] have how many times is it easy to pray
[1:00:38] sometimes right sometimes we'll say
[1:00:40] sometimes
[1:00:42] but this is that this is the atmosphere
[1:00:44] Revival where you're drawn into prayer
[1:00:46] right you're drawn into it you're drawn
[1:00:49] into worship drawn into the sermons
[1:00:51] you're just drawn into God
[1:00:53] you're quickly drawn into that I mean
[1:00:55] you'll have battles every day but right
[1:00:57] but you're more quickly drawn into that
[1:00:59] oh God drove us into that praise God
[1:01:02] draw us into that Hallelujah
[1:01:09] and then the one one the pastor Jenkins
[1:01:11] said 20 year old girls were prophesied
[1:01:14] so you had teenage girls and they were
[1:01:16] the 20 year olds were prophesied for a
[1:01:17] few months here this was uh what month
[1:01:20] was that
[1:01:21] well it's spring okay I think it was
[1:01:23] April actually April May June July
[1:01:25] August so about six months the little
[1:01:27] Revival went on just they would just go
[1:01:28] to service come back sometimes their
[1:01:30] service will last till 10 pm I was
[1:01:32] reading there sometimes midnight
[1:01:33] sometimes you know less
[1:01:35] but they just wanted to stay in the
[1:01:36] prince of God at church how many times
[1:01:38] have we been on a Wednesday night and
[1:01:41] brother Jess just won't close because
[1:01:42] he's got to sing another song
[1:01:44] or I preach no longer or we have a
[1:01:46] longer prayer line now think about that
[1:01:48] what are we experiencing we're
[1:01:49] experiencing Revival
[1:01:52] but it's a church age Revival
[1:01:54] thank God thank God we got that one
[1:01:56] praise God
[1:01:58] Hallelujah
[1:02:01] and that's great
[1:02:02] the main thing is that a Revival
[1:02:04] produces love for Jesus Christ
[1:02:07] and the love of God is expressed it's
[1:02:10] received from God and it is expressed to
[1:02:12] man Hallelujah amen
[1:02:18] no I'm going to make this larger I don't
[1:02:20] expect anybody to read that that's
[1:02:21] beyond your eyesight potential so the
[1:02:24] spirit though begin to fall on average
[1:02:26] Evan Roberts meetings in September of
[1:02:28] the same year now by October he learned
[1:02:31] these steps to obeying the Holy Spirit
[1:02:33] now these are just simple things we
[1:02:35] already know him but I just want you to
[1:02:36] see this is what God taught a man who
[1:02:38] went from service to service to service
[1:02:40] to Revival sir he was not married so he
[1:02:42] could just spend all his time praying
[1:02:44] and studying the Bible
[1:02:47] Hallelujah well I'll tell you what I'm
[1:02:49] glad to be married I love being married
[1:02:50] I love having kids but you know some men
[1:02:53] are called me eunuchs the Bible says
[1:02:55] born from their mother's womb amen
[1:02:59] and church I'm actually as a great
[1:03:01] reward in heaven
[1:03:03] if he was obedient I'm sure he wasn't he
[1:03:05] was obedient to God's call for his life
[1:03:06] but so can you have a great reward in
[1:03:08] heaven
[1:03:09] praise God
[1:03:11] and there's no greater reward Than Just
[1:03:12] to See Jesus
[1:03:14] like we've said that many times I don't
[1:03:16] care what it crowns I don't care
[1:03:17] anything imagine don't talk to me about
[1:03:19] that talk to me about Jesus
[1:03:20] just let me like I said let me lay at
[1:03:22] his feet for 10 000 years
[1:03:27] Hallelujah
[1:03:28] now he was talking about one Service uh
[1:03:31] he was explaining how to get the spear
[1:03:32] the spirit was clearly helping me I
[1:03:34] prayed three times during the service
[1:03:36] 16 stood up to confess Christ praising
[1:03:38] the other was a little girl the spirits
[1:03:40] working with power we come out of the
[1:03:41] meeting at 10 pm and no one was tired
[1:03:42] one very young woman remarked I thought
[1:03:44] it was only 9 pm very good the testimony
[1:03:46] of others was we have never had such
[1:03:48] meetings before
[1:03:50] this is the beginning of the Revival
[1:03:51] there in Wales
[1:03:52] the spirit's influence is already
[1:03:54] powerful over these people now think
[1:03:56] about that church how many times have we
[1:03:57] left here it's 9 30 or 10 and yet we're
[1:04:00] not tired
[1:04:01] we could have took the service a little
[1:04:03] longer
[1:04:05] anybody can say Amen to that
[1:04:07] doesn't happen all the time but
[1:04:09] that's that that's that's that's that's
[1:04:10] the joy of Revival
[1:04:13] that's the love of Revival
[1:04:15] that's the refreshing of the spirit
[1:04:17] praise God
[1:04:21] see
[1:04:23] now now here is this the planet this is
[1:04:25] from his journal this is the plan I've
[1:04:27] taken under the guidance of the Holy
[1:04:29] Spirit these four things are to be right
[1:04:30] so this is what he says if you do these
[1:04:32] things you'll have Revival
[1:04:33] there's if there's some sins or sins in
[1:04:35] the past not confess we cannot have the
[1:04:37] spirit therefore we must search and ask
[1:04:39] God to search us up
[1:04:41] brother Adam calls that thorough
[1:04:42] repentance right
[1:04:44] so if we want more of God it's just very
[1:04:46] simple just confess all your sins
[1:04:49] we know we're going to have them
[1:04:51] Paul said I Die daily that means he
[1:04:53] would sin every day
[1:04:55] he didn't say I die every once in a
[1:04:57] while
[1:04:59] he said there's two laws battling in my
[1:05:01] mind
[1:05:03] right there the law of the spirit then
[1:05:05] there's a law of the flesh
[1:05:07] he says the things I want to do I don't
[1:05:08] do the things that I hate that's what I
[1:05:10] do
[1:05:11] so I've got to die every day there's
[1:05:13] nothing to be ashamed about in that
[1:05:15] the thing to do is die amen
[1:05:18] the thing to do is die and get right
[1:05:19] with God hallelujah
[1:05:22] verse number not verse number two the
[1:05:24] Second Step if there's something
[1:05:25] doubtful in your life it must be removed
[1:05:26] that is something of which we are unsure
[1:05:28] as to it being right or wrong this thing
[1:05:31] must be removed so there's a question in
[1:05:34] someone's life they've got to answer
[1:05:35] that
[1:05:37] right the Bible said anything not done
[1:05:38] in faith is what
[1:05:40] sin the Bible says that
[1:05:42] if you're not sure it's got to be taken
[1:05:45] out of your life because it's probably
[1:05:46] sin
[1:05:48] okay now before we can move on think
[1:05:50] about the times you felt closer to God
[1:05:51] were you doing these
[1:05:54] could you look up there and say
[1:05:55] yes yes all I cared about was God all
[1:05:59] I was obedient to God how many could say
[1:06:00] Amen to that
[1:06:03] you weren't thinking about you know
[1:06:06] simple things or you weren't
[1:06:08] compromising you were just what all in
[1:06:12] you were just fully surrendered praise
[1:06:14] God
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:17] three total surrender to the spirit we
[1:06:18] must do and say all he asked us to do
[1:06:22] and then for a public confession of
[1:06:24] Christ
[1:06:26] all right uh uh I had two students I saw
[1:06:28] former students of mine I saw my Aldi
[1:06:30] last night
[1:06:32] and their dad comes up he said hey Mr
[1:06:33] Smith how you doing I said I'm breaking
[1:06:35] but this is what this was a public
[1:06:36] confession of Christ
[1:06:38] he said were you smoking out in the hall
[1:06:40] out in the parking lot no I had five of
[1:06:42] my kids with me
[1:06:43] I'm like no
[1:06:46] and uh he's like well my girl said you
[1:06:48] were smoking I'm like no I don't smoke
[1:06:50] I said I'm a Christian
[1:06:52] and he goes then he goes like this right
[1:06:53] in front right Audi he's like huh but
[1:06:55] someday you'll smoke right someday
[1:06:56] you'll smoke when you retire I said no
[1:06:58] sir I'm never gonna smoke I'm a
[1:06:59] Christian
[1:07:03] I got a public testimony for Christ
[1:07:05] right I walked into Chick-fil-A on
[1:07:08] Monday I had the day off this
[1:07:10] President's Day
[1:07:11] thank God for the presidents because I
[1:07:13] get a day off my Jesus hat on this woman
[1:07:16] walks by she's probably in 50 she's like
[1:07:17] oh I like that hat I just love her those
[1:07:20] moments right I said Jesus healed my
[1:07:22] mama cancer and she took a few steps and
[1:07:24] she said Jesus healed my husband to
[1:07:25] cancer and she walked out I said
[1:07:27] hallelujah praise God I got a public
[1:07:31] testimony for Jesus amen
[1:07:35] see and he says these four things lead
[1:07:37] us to the Grand blessing
[1:07:39] now this is what he learned you know
[1:07:41] this is before this is before laodicea
[1:07:43] church age right there's the end of the
[1:07:45] Philadelphia Church
[1:07:46] I just want to show you how simple this
[1:07:48] is in other words confess all your sin
[1:07:50] draw an eye to God and God will draw
[1:07:52] night to you praise God
[1:07:54] very simple very simple
[1:07:58] and this is what transformed a nation
[1:08:01] transformation
[1:08:03] so now church this is what I told you
[1:08:05] earlier he he was married he was not
[1:08:07] married so he gave himself fully to this
[1:08:09] revival and you should see his journal
[1:08:11] he has service almost every single day
[1:08:13] sometimes multiple times a day
[1:08:18] so in 1906 he could barely stand he had
[1:08:21] exhausted himself so much so much prayer
[1:08:23] fasting preaching praying
[1:08:25] can you imagine not being able to stand
[1:08:27] for a year
[1:08:30] you have no physical power to stand up
[1:08:33] because you've given all your strength
[1:08:35] for Christ
[1:08:37] now that's literally
[1:08:39] uh wearing out right
[1:08:42] not rusting out but wearing out but
[1:08:44] imagine I'd rather wear out than rust
[1:08:46] out that's exactly what Evan Roberts did
[1:08:48] he wore himself out until he couldn't
[1:08:50] almost stand for a whole year
[1:08:54] sir God's not asking Church God's not
[1:08:56] asking all of us to do this
[1:08:58] God's just asking us to do what he
[1:09:00] called us to do
[1:09:03] he was born for this
[1:09:05] and church this was a love for him
[1:09:08] before he started this revival he said
[1:09:10] Jesus would appear to him for four hours
[1:09:13] it was from like 12 midnight to like 4
[1:09:16] a.m and then he got a job after that and
[1:09:19] he said he wept and cried because the
[1:09:22] job made him he had to sleep and then
[1:09:24] then he only had 30 minutes of prayer
[1:09:26] with Jesus and he said he would weep and
[1:09:27] cry that he he missed out on the other
[1:09:29] three and a half hours
[1:09:31] a church that's a deep love for Jesus
[1:09:37] four hours of prayer or just reading
[1:09:39] your Bible think about that four hours
[1:09:40] just reading the Bible
[1:09:43] to God getting up and down on your knees
[1:09:45] and reading the Bible up
[1:09:47] and he would weep that he only had 30
[1:09:49] minutes to do it
[1:09:53] I'm just showing you these are these are
[1:09:55] heroes of the thing
[1:09:58] yeah Heroes
[1:10:01] I think it's beautiful now why I
[1:10:03] preached out so that it'll it'll
[1:10:04] encourage us to long just long for 30
[1:10:07] minutes with God or if you're a mother
[1:10:10] maybe long for five minutes with God
[1:10:12] before the kids wake up and come tackle
[1:10:14] you or whatever they do
[1:10:16] or ask you to put their shoes on like
[1:10:17] Zion likes to get his shoes on right
[1:10:18] away in the morning I don't know if he
[1:10:20] does that anymore
[1:10:21] he did in the summer
[1:10:25] but he so warms self out he couldn't
[1:10:27] stand for once now look at that he
[1:10:29] worked so hard for two years he had to
[1:10:31] take a year off of ministry
[1:10:33] so he missed out no no doubt the devil
[1:10:35] said see look at you you disobeyed God
[1:10:38] now you can't preach for a whole year
[1:10:41] but I I I don't think he let the devil
[1:10:43] defeat him on that he probably said This
[1:10:46] is My Season of rest this is my juniper
[1:10:48] tree time amen I'm labor for God and now
[1:10:51] I'm getting my juniper tree praise God
[1:10:54] and then
[1:10:56] a couple years later he devoted his time
[1:10:58] to prayer publishing magazines books and
[1:11:00] then about 11 years later he went for
[1:11:02] his final Revival meetings for a couple
[1:11:04] years
[1:11:05] and then church he spent probably the
[1:11:06] next 25 years just doing the following
[1:11:10] poetry writing poetry praying
[1:11:12] Publications
[1:11:14] see Revival is like like group revivals
[1:11:16] don't last forever
[1:11:18] that's why you don't feel bad about
[1:11:19] anything here tonight we don't have to
[1:11:20] feel bad about anything
[1:11:22] when and brother Brown's going to say it
[1:11:23] later brother says when God wants to
[1:11:25] sovereignly move nothing is going to
[1:11:27] stop stop God
[1:11:29] nobody here can stop God
[1:11:32] when God wants to move an amazing way
[1:11:34] with five hours of prayer or seven hours
[1:11:36] of prayer or four hours of study
[1:11:41] or two years of laboring until you can't
[1:11:43] even stand when God wants to do so that
[1:11:45] sovereignly God's going to do it he's
[1:11:47] going to find the vessel to do it and
[1:11:49] God's name will be glorified praise God
[1:11:52] it's God's Sovereign move
[1:11:54] well Graham says he says a preacher
[1:11:57] doesn't bring a Revival in his briefcase
[1:12:00] now today it's a preacher don't bring a
[1:12:01] Revival on his iPad
[1:12:04] or his laptop whatever one she's got
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:07] Revival don't come from a man Revival
[1:12:09] comes from God hallelujah
[1:12:13] it's a sovereign Act of God he died at
[1:12:15] 72. now earlier I thought he died
[1:12:17] younger but no he died at 72.
[1:12:20] this just goes to show God had a
[1:12:23] specific time and season to to fully
[1:12:25] exhaust all his energies all his
[1:12:27] strength but then he had a season of
[1:12:29] rest afterwards
[1:12:31] just like Seymour he had all in a few
[1:12:33] intense years of Revival but then he had
[1:12:35] Seasons where there wasn't three
[1:12:37] services a day
[1:12:40] there's Seasons to this God has a time
[1:12:42] how many know God has a time and season
[1:12:44] for everything
[1:12:46] how many are glad God has a time and
[1:12:48] season for everything
[1:12:49] I'm really glad especially when it comes
[1:12:51] to trials
[1:12:52] I'm glad the trials eventually end
[1:12:55] hallelujah praise God I'm glad the
[1:12:58] seasons of mourning eventually end then
[1:12:59] we get the season of Dancing again
[1:13:01] amen praise God
[1:13:07] little man now he's talking about
[1:13:09] the Welsh revivalists this was Evan
[1:13:10] Roberts Revival he talks about uh
[1:13:15] he talks about Billy Graham having a
[1:13:16] Revival she's 30 30 000 will come in in
[1:13:19] two weeks and give their hearts to
[1:13:20] Christ and go back and you ain't got one
[1:13:22] now that's not a Revival
[1:13:26] see that's an emotional plea brother
[1:13:28] Rand calls it an intellectual faith
[1:13:30] see they hear Billy Graham preach they
[1:13:32] say Okay I want to give my life to
[1:13:33] Christ I make a decision for Christ but
[1:13:35] it was never real repentance
[1:13:38] but look at you where are you guys at
[1:13:40] you're here still repenting worshiping
[1:13:42] God loving God you had a real Revival
[1:13:45] praise God
[1:13:46] you're still here and three months later
[1:13:48] or two weeks later you're still here
[1:13:50] praise God
[1:13:52] that's right
[1:13:55] see that's Billy Graham's got the
[1:13:57] mechanics he's got the preaching to
[1:13:58] bring a Revival but let God in a
[1:14:01] Sovereign Grace just speak to some
[1:14:02] little nitwit as to say a little nobody
[1:14:04] let his Spirit fall into a city and man
[1:14:06] can't go to work women can't wash dishes
[1:14:08] the maid can't make a bed of screaming
[1:14:10] and crying with their hands up in the
[1:14:11] air that's Revival that's in the will of
[1:14:13] God now notice there's never a Time
[1:14:15] brother Branham had this
[1:14:18] because that's speaking of a national
[1:14:19] Revival
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:23] we have nothing on tape where mother
[1:14:24] says well I didn't go to work because we
[1:14:26] had a national Revival there's nothing
[1:14:27] on tape
[1:14:29] Hallelujah
[1:14:31] so brother is making the point God has a
[1:14:33] sovereign time for Revival in your
[1:14:35] family
[1:14:37] God has a sovereign time for your
[1:14:39] personal Revival amen
[1:14:42] Hallelujah
[1:14:43] God has a sovereign time for everything
[1:14:45] praise God
[1:14:47] and God's going to accomplish his will
[1:14:51] our desire though is just yield to the
[1:14:53] Holy Spirit praise God
[1:14:55] Lord whatever you want in this season of
[1:14:57] my life help me to yield to it praise
[1:15:00] God
[1:15:03] see Evan Roberts for years church for
[1:15:05] years he would he said I could stay up
[1:15:08] till all the hours of the night just
[1:15:10] talking to my friends about Holy Ghost
[1:15:12] revivals
[1:15:14] for years
[1:15:16] so see church I don't mind if we're if
[1:15:18] we're on the waiting game we're gonna
[1:15:19] wait for a couple years so we really see
[1:15:20] more of God that's fine
[1:15:22] that's what I want my mind on I want to
[1:15:25] set my affections on things above praise
[1:15:28] God
[1:15:29] not things that are on the earth things
[1:15:31] that are above praise God
[1:15:33] and remember it can be as simple as a
[1:15:35] few teenage girls
[1:15:37] shout in Praise And Weep and glorifying
[1:15:39] God sing and testifying prophesying
[1:15:42] speaking in tongues filled with the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost whatever it may be that could be
[1:15:45] the Revival that we're longing for and
[1:15:47] praying for Hallelujah we got to let God
[1:15:50] interpret his word amen
[1:15:52] gotta let God have his way
[1:15:55] and you know the story brother man I
[1:15:56] said uh the Americans went over to Wales
[1:15:58] and wanted to see the Welsh Revival
[1:16:00] they got off their ship with their tall
[1:16:02] hats on round collars a little policeman
[1:16:04] was swinging his Club around like that
[1:16:06] and said my good man can you tell me
[1:16:07] where the Welsh Revival is yes my
[1:16:09] brethren you're standing in the middle
[1:16:11] of it
[1:16:13] in other words when you're standing in
[1:16:14] my presence you finally got to Revival
[1:16:17] amen church we should all be able to say
[1:16:20] that praise God when you when when
[1:16:21] people come into our presence you've now
[1:16:23] come to akron's Revival praise God
[1:16:27] hang around me for a while you'll be
[1:16:29] revived amen right
[1:16:32] see he had to go to work but he was had
[1:16:34] a song in his heart
[1:16:36] singing at work right sister who sing it
[1:16:38] over
[1:16:39] hallelujah what do I do I dance at work
[1:16:42] at bible Club Hallelujah I dance around
[1:16:43] my classroom for Jesus
[1:16:45] you just you just love God on the job
[1:16:49] you understand the Welsh Revival because
[1:16:50] the Welsh Revival is in me praise God
[1:16:55] that's Sovereign that's what God does
[1:16:57] and he alone has a right to send Revival
[1:17:00] not get the mechanics together it's pray
[1:17:03] to God to send the Dynamics
[1:17:05] Hallelujah
[1:17:07] so that's what we're looking for we're
[1:17:08] looking just for more of God
[1:17:10] and whatever God wants to bring in our
[1:17:12] church we got to let him bring it to the
[1:17:14] church
[1:17:15] praise God
[1:17:17] we've got to invite Jesus every service
[1:17:19] keep say faithful to Jesus love Jesus
[1:17:21] confess our sins thoroughly repent of
[1:17:24] everything and then let the spirit move
[1:17:25] praise God
[1:17:27] like I was telling my barber today today
[1:17:29] I walked I got a haircut right before
[1:17:30] church
[1:17:32] and it would just let a God I walked in
[1:17:34] there there's nobody in there
[1:17:36] and he said I got a lot of questions for
[1:17:38] you about God I said well this is the
[1:17:39] right time because nobody's in here it
[1:17:41] was just brother Jesse and the barber
[1:17:42] yeah
[1:17:43] so I appreciate him for the next 30
[1:17:45] minutes
[1:17:46] it was awesome
[1:17:48] he mainly wouldn't know what about
[1:17:49] people that don't hear about Jesus and
[1:17:51] the age of accountability that was the
[1:17:52] main I got to preach about the baptism
[1:17:53] Holy Ghost he's like what are the three
[1:17:55] steps of Grace what what are you talking
[1:17:56] about I didn't know that's in the Bible
[1:17:58] he said he said honestly I don't even go
[1:18:00] like going to church it's so boring I
[1:18:01] said you got to find a place where the
[1:18:02] spirit of God is moving
[1:18:05] I said some Services going to be Divine
[1:18:07] Healing
[1:18:08] some service is going to be repentance
[1:18:10] at the altar
[1:18:12] Hallelujah some service is going to be
[1:18:13] the mysteries of God are going to be
[1:18:15] revealed well I never knew that before
[1:18:16] God just opened my eyes a truth would
[1:18:19] just unveiled to me praise God
[1:18:21] some server is going to be teaching you
[1:18:22] this is how you pray do this this this
[1:18:24] this is how you get close to God this is
[1:18:27] how you have a Revival
[1:18:29] you understand
[1:18:31] some services are going to be on love
[1:18:33] and forgiveness
[1:18:35] and never one of them is boring because
[1:18:38] God's here amen
[1:18:40] God just help us to get out of the flesh
[1:18:42] for a few minutes and we all need help
[1:18:43] at times I'm not condemning to anybody
[1:18:45] I'm in there we all need it praise God
[1:18:48] but we can all feel when it starts to
[1:18:50] change to the Holy Spirit
[1:18:54] you're right the beginning middle end
[1:18:55] like brother cam was saying
[1:18:58] we can all start to feel when God starts
[1:19:00] dealing with people's lives
[1:19:02] praise God
[1:19:05] alone has the right to send Revival
[1:19:09] so I just love God
[1:19:11] and I'm just going to be waiting here
[1:19:12] for when God sends the next Revival
[1:19:13] attack
[1:19:15] Hallelujah
[1:19:17] thank you Jesus
[1:19:23] now here's one these are these are from
[1:19:25] a book by Reverend he was talking about
[1:19:27] how this revival affected the nation
[1:19:29] a story was told of how the horses and
[1:19:31] the mines were confused because once
[1:19:33] they were driven by men with use of
[1:19:35] obscenity and kicks but now there were
[1:19:37] any
[1:19:39] this revival is so powerful the animals
[1:19:41] were affected
[1:19:42] the animals are like why aren't you
[1:19:43] kicking why aren't you cussing at me
[1:19:46] because the movers the the Riders of
[1:19:48] those animals now had love in their
[1:19:50] hearts
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:54] come on Cherokee come on take us down
[1:19:56] there real gentle we said get moving
[1:19:59] horsey you know whatever I never rode a
[1:20:01] horse I don't know I don't know what I'm
[1:20:03] talking about
[1:20:05] but see it was instead of anger and
[1:20:07] cussing and swear now it's sweetness and
[1:20:10] humility
[1:20:12] I'm so thankful for this job
[1:20:14] I'm so thankful for this opportunity
[1:20:16] I'm not going to cuss and swear and
[1:20:17] complain my way through life I'm going
[1:20:19] to give God praise amen I'm going to be
[1:20:21] thankful I'm going to spend my time
[1:20:22] showing the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] praise God
[1:20:26] how many people have I come had come up
[1:20:27] to me this year with the class that I
[1:20:29] have this year how many people have I
[1:20:30] come up to me and they told me brother
[1:20:32] this is not in the brothers this Mr
[1:20:34] Smith you're a special kind of a person
[1:20:37] you're a different kind of a person they
[1:20:39] would say you have the patience of a
[1:20:40] saint I'm like well I am a saint
[1:20:43] I am separated to Christ that's what I
[1:20:46] should have but I always say it's all by
[1:20:48] the grace of God
[1:20:50] because God's not going to give glory to
[1:20:51] me
[1:20:52] we're supposed to let our light shine as
[1:20:55] a light that's a city on a hill that
[1:20:57] cannot be hidden
[1:20:58] let your light shine before men and then
[1:21:01] people will glorify the Father which is
[1:21:03] in heaven when they see the love of God
[1:21:04] in your life
[1:21:07] so animals got confused after this
[1:21:09] revival
[1:21:11] Hallelujah
[1:21:12] the Revival sees the nation that the
[1:21:14] mill published Revival editions so the
[1:21:17] newspaper started instead of talking
[1:21:19] about trash they started talking about
[1:21:20] the Revival
[1:21:21] how often does a religious news take
[1:21:24] front page in a national and secular
[1:21:26] newspaper
[1:21:27] in these editions Revival news
[1:21:29] superseded current affairs and
[1:21:31] testimonies replaced tabloid
[1:21:33] telling them how the route Welsh were
[1:21:36] more interested in God in his kingdom
[1:21:37] than the Affairs of the world this tells
[1:21:39] you the uh the reporters got converted
[1:21:42] right because they could have attacked
[1:21:43] the Revival but the reporters the
[1:21:46] newspaper reporters got converted and
[1:21:48] instead of tests writing about trash
[1:21:49] they wrote about God's treasure amen
[1:21:52] Glory
[1:21:54] it's kind of like Chris Chris was
[1:21:57] posting evil things on Facebook until he
[1:21:58] got saved when Austin invited him to
[1:22:00] church same thing
[1:22:02] the author the heart of the author
[1:22:04] changed hallelujah amen the newspaper
[1:22:07] article writers their hearts change so
[1:22:10] their posts change when you get Jesus
[1:22:12] Christ in your life your posts are going
[1:22:14] to change your interests are going to
[1:22:15] change it's all Jesus from then on
[1:22:17] praise God
[1:22:19] this is this is the effects of national
[1:22:21] Revival
[1:22:24] they even put on the back of the
[1:22:25] newspaper hymns
[1:22:28] and they put a running tick a running
[1:22:30] number of all the conversions does that
[1:22:32] remind you of covid they had a running
[1:22:34] number of all the deaths
[1:22:36] one thousand ten thousand five thousand
[1:22:38] five hundred thousand two two million
[1:22:39] four billion
[1:22:40] see when people really get saved they
[1:22:42] keep track of the good things not the
[1:22:43] bad things
[1:22:45] Hallelujah
[1:22:46] and when God revives our hearts we keep
[1:22:48] track of the good things not the bad
[1:22:50] things
[1:22:51] don't let the devil keep track of your
[1:22:53] bad things tell them it's I've already
[1:22:55] confessed it it's in the sea of
[1:22:56] forgetfulness Jesus has already forgiven
[1:22:58] me I'm only keeping track of the
[1:23:00] testimonies amen
[1:23:02] I'm not keeping track of my fails I'm
[1:23:05] keeping track of God's testimonies in my
[1:23:07] life Hallelujah
[1:23:09] Glory
[1:23:11] see it impacted the entire nation
[1:23:14] that's what it looks like
[1:23:16] now I just want to close with this here
[1:23:17] got a few minutes
[1:23:21] and I don't have slides for all these
[1:23:22] Summoner to show a few slides and I'm
[1:23:24] gonna
[1:23:27] I want to read this again
[1:23:28] I I personally believe this is Brother
[1:23:30] randoms
[1:23:32] uh how do you say it
[1:23:34] his best sermon on Divine Healing he
[1:23:36] ever preached this is my personal
[1:23:37] opinion
[1:23:40] works as Faith expressed one month
[1:23:42] before he passes he even says he says
[1:23:45] he says after all these years on the
[1:23:47] field he said I ought to have learned
[1:23:49] something about Divine Healing
[1:23:53] he says the more the more you swim he
[1:23:55] said The more smoother the stroke
[1:23:57] right whether you're supposed
[1:23:59] to whichever way you're swimming I don't
[1:24:01] swim either so I don't even know which
[1:24:02] stroke that is
[1:24:05] but he said if you're not learning
[1:24:07] things he said then you're getting
[1:24:09] further away from God
[1:24:12] and this sermon to me is the Pinnacle of
[1:24:14] his teaching on Divine Healing
[1:24:16] now he says and God promised you the
[1:24:18] same thing if you could just believe
[1:24:19] that it would happen if you can't
[1:24:21] believe it it just won't happen now I
[1:24:24] can't make you believe neither can you
[1:24:25] make yourself believe now someone ought
[1:24:27] to should someone ought to should have
[1:24:28] said amen after that
[1:24:30] you can't make yourself believe
[1:24:32] him said God has to give it to you as a
[1:24:35] gift
[1:24:37] if you want God to heal you it's got to
[1:24:39] be a gift
[1:24:41] if you want God to save a loved one it's
[1:24:43] got to be a gift you can never work it
[1:24:44] up
[1:24:45] in other words you can't twist God's arm
[1:24:48] and say God you got to do this God's
[1:24:50] going to do it when he wants to do it
[1:24:52] if he wants to do it
[1:24:54] praise God
[1:24:56] and this is growth this is growth in
[1:24:58] brother Adams Ministry
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:03] he said God has to give it to you it's a
[1:25:06] gift of God to believe not your faith
[1:25:08] it's God's faithful it's a good thing
[1:25:10] because my flesh don't have much faith
[1:25:13] that's what I needed Jesus is Faith amen
[1:25:15] that's what Paul said I don't live by my
[1:25:17] faith I live by the faith of the son of
[1:25:19] God
[1:25:23] your intellectual Faith might believe it
[1:25:25] fine but unless the faith of God's Not
[1:25:26] In Your Heart see your intellectual
[1:25:27] faith can accept it do that do that but
[1:25:30] just keep believing it with your heart
[1:25:31] until God does reveal it to you
[1:25:35] see just keep believing it until God
[1:25:38] does reveal it
[1:25:40] but then Brothers goes on to say I don't
[1:25:41] have all the quotes but I said you
[1:25:42] probably remember me preaching this a
[1:25:44] few years ago
[1:25:46] he says until God reveals that he said
[1:25:48] you can pour 50 gallons of oil think of
[1:25:50] what 50 gallons looks like
[1:25:52] you can pour 50 gallons of oil on
[1:25:54] someone for Divine Healing and they'll
[1:25:55] never get well until it's revealed to
[1:25:57] them
[1:25:58] brother I said you can baptize somebody
[1:26:00] 50 times in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:02] but until they receive salvation until
[1:26:05] it's a revelation nothing will ever
[1:26:07] change
[1:26:09] so that I'll encourage you thank God a
[1:26:12] revelation struck your heart praise God
[1:26:15] thank God God dropped a revelation on
[1:26:17] your heart to love the word of God
[1:26:19] to believe the word of God God dropped
[1:26:22] it and when God dropped it you just
[1:26:24] received it praise God it was a gift
[1:26:26] thank God for these precious gifts we
[1:26:28] have about marriage and divorce these
[1:26:30] gifts we have about Holiness these gifts
[1:26:32] we have about salvation these gifts we
[1:26:34] have about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:36] these gifts we have about Divine Healing
[1:26:38] and miracles and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:26:39] they're all gifts thank God for his
[1:26:42] gifts Hallelujah
[1:26:43] we didn't earn a one of them they were
[1:26:46] all given by Grace Hallelujah
[1:26:50] you never worked yourself up into that
[1:26:52] it was God leading you to that praise
[1:26:55] God
[1:26:56] he did it sovereignly it was his time
[1:26:59] his plan it wasn't your plan it was
[1:27:01] God's plan amen
[1:27:07] this is the climax
[1:27:09] I believe
[1:27:11] we cannot work ourselves into anything
[1:27:13] it's God drawing us to it
[1:27:18] God is drawing us all we have to do is
[1:27:21] just submit to his drawing
[1:27:25] it's God saying come have fellowship
[1:27:27] with me and all we do is say Okay Lord
[1:27:29] yeah
[1:27:30] okay I'll meet you there yeah Hallelujah
[1:27:34] I hear you drawing me to some fellowship
[1:27:36] yeah I'll meet you there
[1:27:38] now think how easy you do you do all
[1:27:40] these times for church
[1:27:42] right so if we can do it all these times
[1:27:44] we can do it outside of church too
[1:27:46] it's a great victory that we have it for
[1:27:48] church praise God a lot of people don't
[1:27:50] go to church anymore
[1:27:51] covert wiped out a lot of church
[1:27:52] attendance but didn't wipe out ours
[1:27:54] praise God
[1:27:55] Hallelujah
[1:27:57] thank God
[1:27:58] but if we can surrender thank God we can
[1:28:00] surrender in the coming to physical
[1:28:01] church but now let's also listen for the
[1:28:04] surrender of time outside of church
[1:28:08] see
[1:28:12] beautiful that's where I'm gonna stop
[1:28:13] because I don't have these notes to
[1:28:15] organize them my thoughts are all over
[1:28:16] the place okay
[1:28:17] so give me a few minutes here to finish
[1:28:19] up
[1:28:20] I didn't have time to get through all my
[1:28:21] thoughts I had so many thoughts coming
[1:28:25] with your Bible here let's get your
[1:28:26] Bible here
[1:28:30] go to revelation 3.
[1:28:32] just some of these familiar scriptures
[1:28:35] well the Cam's message was such a
[1:28:36] blessing I just want to end with some of
[1:28:37] these I want to repeat some of these
[1:28:38] familiar thoughts here
[1:28:41] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:28:45] verse 19.
[1:28:51] actually let's go to verse 18. I counsel
[1:28:53] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:28:55] in other words Jesus saying let me give
[1:28:57] you some advice come to me and buy these
[1:29:01] spiritual blessings
[1:29:04] right
[1:29:05] in other words what is he doing he's
[1:29:06] inviting you to him
[1:29:08] I'm counseling you come and buy gold
[1:29:11] trying the fire white raim it and I
[1:29:14] salve
[1:29:15] come by these blessings from me
[1:29:18] see he's drawing you to him
[1:29:21] now think about that
[1:29:23] Jesus is here in the Holy Spirit and
[1:29:25] he's got gold waiting for you and he's
[1:29:27] got a white white garment waiting for
[1:29:29] you and I sell for you
[1:29:33] if I had a stack of gold here
[1:29:34] all of you would rush up to get the gold
[1:29:36] if I said I want to share my goal with
[1:29:37] you guys
[1:29:39] I want you to have wealth I want you to
[1:29:41] be stable
[1:29:43] Jesus is here offering something so much
[1:29:45] better and the church said
[1:29:47] what is gold he said it's it's
[1:29:50] time-tested faith
[1:29:52] the fiery Trials of your faith are more
[1:29:54] precious than what
[1:29:55] gold
[1:29:57] so Jesus is saying let me take you
[1:29:59] through some trials and I will I will
[1:30:01] mature your faith it'll be more valuable
[1:30:04] than gold
[1:30:06] what's white Raymond white Raymond is
[1:30:07] the righteousness or the Integrity of
[1:30:09] Christ let me give you a garment of his
[1:30:12] Integrity Glory
[1:30:14] tomorrow yes where Mount is closed the
[1:30:15] church or to work tomorrow but also put
[1:30:17] on that Garment of righteousness too
[1:30:20] Jesus died in other words Jesus died for
[1:30:22] me and I'm going to live like it
[1:30:25] I'm going to live like somebody died for
[1:30:26] me can the church say amen amen
[1:30:28] I know I'm kind of pull for amen tonight
[1:30:30] you know it's Wednesday night
[1:30:33] God help me to live like somebody died
[1:30:36] for me and now I'm living for them
[1:30:38] and Lord give me some ice out so I can
[1:30:40] rub it on my eyes
[1:30:41] and I can really see I can get all that
[1:30:43] matter out of my eyes I can really see
[1:30:45] what's going on out there
[1:30:47] what is going on in this world
[1:30:50] help me to see with your eyes
[1:30:53] help me to see my my co-workers with
[1:30:54] your eyes help me see my family with
[1:30:56] your eyes how many want these blessings
[1:30:58] from Jesus
[1:31:00] 19. as many as I love what I rebuke and
[1:31:03] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:31:08] see we saw how brother cam showed Peter
[1:31:11] got rebuked by Paul after he was born
[1:31:13] again
[1:31:15] and the Bible says if you rebuke a wise
[1:31:17] man he'll love you
[1:31:20] so when Jesus comes and he brings us a
[1:31:22] word
[1:31:23] and it rebukes us and it corrects us we
[1:31:25] should love him afterwards
[1:31:27] praise God
[1:31:28] and he's going to offer us more gold
[1:31:30] he's going to offer us the white raiment
[1:31:32] he's going to offer us the eye salve
[1:31:35] and he says come to me and buy some of
[1:31:38] these in other words make a transaction
[1:31:40] amen I'm Trading My Sorrows amen
[1:31:43] I'm Trading My Sorrows I'm Trading My
[1:31:46] Pain amen I'm laying it down for the joy
[1:31:49] of the Lord amen
[1:31:51] Hallelujah I'm trading my my ashes for
[1:31:54] some beauty praise God
[1:31:56] I'm trading it I'm making a trade I'm
[1:31:59] trading in my complaining and getting
[1:32:01] some real strong faith praise God
[1:32:03] I know God's in control of my life I
[1:32:05] know God will bring me through this it's
[1:32:07] hard but God will get me through it
[1:32:08] praise God you just traded your ashes
[1:32:11] for for beauty praise God all right
[1:32:13] Hallelujah
[1:32:15] Hallelujah you about to come to church
[1:32:17] well I'm going to get back at that
[1:32:18] person but you can leave with the
[1:32:20] righteousness you can leave with a white
[1:32:21] robot I'm gonna go love that person
[1:32:23] praise God
[1:32:26] you can leave
[1:32:28] you can leave changed I can we all can
[1:32:31] leave change how many believe that by
[1:32:33] God's grace
[1:32:34] the church that's why I believe our
[1:32:35] Revival is greater than Asbury because
[1:32:37] our Revival is a Revival of quality not
[1:32:41] quantity
[1:32:42] it's not the number of hours it's not
[1:32:44] the number of straight days it's the
[1:32:46] quality what life is produced
[1:32:48] they're a Wesleyan Revival right we
[1:32:51] could say the same thing about any
[1:32:52] denominational Revival
[1:32:54] any denomination Revival it only takes
[1:32:56] them so far but this word takes us fully
[1:32:59] into the mind of Christ
[1:33:01] remember Church remember what
[1:33:03] Deuteronomy says the Bible says the
[1:33:05] secret things belong to the Lord and to
[1:33:08] his children
[1:33:10] we have secret things the world and
[1:33:12] domination doesn't know anything about
[1:33:15] it
[1:33:16] Hallelujah ain't amen
[1:33:20] they don't know about the 12 Mysteries
[1:33:22] they don't know about and they don't
[1:33:23] know about anything
[1:33:24] we have God's secret things that shows
[1:33:28] we're God's people
[1:33:31] you you would think you would think in
[1:33:33] 14 days a Revival Services sister Naomi
[1:33:36] you would think at some point they'd
[1:33:37] catch the mystery that God's one person
[1:33:40] his gracious all that praying brother
[1:33:42] Ray all that singing you would think in
[1:33:44] one of those songs
[1:33:46] the mystery would strike oh he's not
[1:33:49] threes one I just had a woman call me up
[1:33:50] from I forget what state she was she's
[1:33:52] like you know what she said my whole
[1:33:54] life I just I didn't talk to her but I
[1:33:55] left her a voicemail my whole life I
[1:33:56] wondered who do I pray to the father
[1:33:58] Holy Ghost she said your video seems to
[1:34:00] be right it's just one person
[1:34:02] that makes so much more sense and it
[1:34:04] would really relieve me if that's the
[1:34:06] truth I said that is the truth amen
[1:34:09] you're not praying to three people
[1:34:10] you're praying to one person amen
[1:34:14] it's the quality brother Austin it's a
[1:34:17] quality amount of guy of Revival it's
[1:34:20] not the quantity it's the quality praise
[1:34:22] God
[1:34:26] she said do I wear a veil uh a cap over
[1:34:29] my hair that's that my covering I said
[1:34:32] sister just go look at the Bible the
[1:34:34] covering is your long hair
[1:34:37] she said that makes so much sense thank
[1:34:39] you
[1:34:39] doesn't the Bible make so much sense
[1:34:44] but they can pray for all those hours in
[1:34:46] that 14 straight days and not even kept
[1:34:49] see the focus isn't on the forward of
[1:34:51] God it's on a part of the word but our
[1:34:53] focus is on all the word of God
[1:34:55] amen hallelujah
[1:34:58] Jesus said Elijah shall restore all
[1:35:01] things Hallelujah Jesus Christ said that
[1:35:03] Elijah the spirit of Elijah on William
[1:35:06] Branham would restore all things and
[1:35:07] here we are Brother Ray it's all
[1:35:09] restored amen
[1:35:10] glory to God hallelujah
[1:35:13] amen
[1:35:16] Glory says brother Cam said the word is
[1:35:19] energized by faith
[1:35:22] that when God drops that Revelation down
[1:35:25] now church for Divine Healing you need
[1:35:27] Revelation but I'ma say something right
[1:35:28] here not everything you need a
[1:35:31] revelation for
[1:35:34] let me explain
[1:35:37] if you come in here with an angry spirit
[1:35:39] you don't need a revelation that God
[1:35:41] wants you to deliver from that
[1:35:43] huh
[1:35:45] if you come in here with a lying Spirit
[1:35:46] on you you don't need a revelation oh
[1:35:48] God wants to be delivered from lying
[1:35:51] no God the Bible says it plain
[1:35:54] God always wants you free from lying
[1:35:57] and the church said amen
[1:35:58] amen you've got a lustful spirit
[1:36:01] if you got the greedy spirit
[1:36:03] if you got a bitter spirit
[1:36:06] some kind of a complex we don't have to
[1:36:08] have a revelation does God want to set
[1:36:10] me free from depression today does God
[1:36:12] want to set me free from lust does God
[1:36:14] want to uh Set Me Free uh from any sin
[1:36:18] of course he does amen I don't need a
[1:36:21] revelation for that the Bible said Die
[1:36:24] daily praise God Amen it's already in
[1:36:27] the scripture praise God
[1:36:28] so there's times church when we need you
[1:36:30] just recognize the word of God like
[1:36:32] brother Camp said the truth shall make
[1:36:34] us free praise God we gotta look at our
[1:36:36] situation what's the truth of that
[1:36:38] situation and when we look at it we got
[1:36:40] to judge it and we know the truth will
[1:36:42] set us free in that situation praise God
[1:36:46] Hallelujah
[1:36:48] that's my humble opinion there's some
[1:36:49] things we don't need to Revival on I'm
[1:36:51] sorry we don't need Revelation on
[1:36:52] because it's already been revealed to us
[1:36:55] now Church get this though we sin every
[1:36:58] day and Church Brothers said Satan has a
[1:37:00] punch one punch on us all the time
[1:37:04] so there's going to be times we feel
[1:37:05] like we're on the Mountaintop but that
[1:37:07] Mountaintop don't last so long
[1:37:10] so pretty soon he's punching at you with
[1:37:11] that envy that jealousy
[1:37:15] all right that Pride look how great I am
[1:37:17] my goodness I'm the greatest person that
[1:37:19] ever walked on the face of the Earth
[1:37:23] people think that
[1:37:25] they think that
[1:37:27] see he's always got one punch on you
[1:37:30] one punch
[1:37:32] so see we can have Revival but yet at
[1:37:35] some point when we come down from our
[1:37:36] great spiritual euphoria
[1:37:39] on that same day Satan's going to be
[1:37:41] punching us
[1:37:43] so we got to be ready to fight praise
[1:37:44] God
[1:37:46] and what do we fight with what can
[1:37:48] brother Cameron reminded said what do we
[1:37:49] fight with
[1:37:50] faith in the word of God let's all say
[1:37:51] it together ready faith in the word of
[1:37:53] God I'm not trying to trick anybody
[1:37:54] praise God
[1:37:56] Hallelujah
[1:37:58] and like brother Cam said we must
[1:37:59] remember who we are in God's sight
[1:38:03] when were you chosen sister who in the
[1:38:05] mind of God do you remember when you
[1:38:06] were chosen
[1:38:10] yes from the foundation world give her
[1:38:12] two claps
[1:38:13] Ephesians 1 verse 5. amen you are chosen
[1:38:17] in Christ before the foundational world
[1:38:20] does anybody know in Ephesians or
[1:38:21] Galatians chapter 4 why could God give
[1:38:24] you the Holy Ghost because you were
[1:38:25] always what what you always were a
[1:38:29] son
[1:38:31] the Bible said because you are Sons God
[1:38:34] gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:38:35] you already were in other words he
[1:38:38] predestinated he knew you were a Son of
[1:38:39] God son or daughter of God that's why
[1:38:42] you got it praise God that's why God's
[1:38:43] drawing you here you already were you
[1:38:45] were chosen in his mind praise God and
[1:38:47] then you always were so that's why he
[1:38:49] gave it to you praise God he foreknew
[1:38:51] you that's what the barber that's what
[1:38:53] the barber had trouble with
[1:38:54] foreknowledge I said a lot of us have
[1:38:55] troubles for knowledge
[1:38:57] right how can God have foreign knowledge
[1:38:59] and then uh allow free more agency as
[1:39:01] well because he knows the beginning from
[1:39:03] the end
[1:39:04] that's the only answer but it's hard to
[1:39:05] understand
[1:39:07] how could God give Judas a scared free
[1:39:08] moral uh agency but yet he set him up to
[1:39:11] be the Son of Perdition because God knew
[1:39:13] he would want the money instead
[1:39:15] we can understand it
[1:39:17] but someone who doesn't go to The
[1:39:18] Message Church they can't understand
[1:39:19] that mystery thank God we can understand
[1:39:21] the Mysteries
[1:39:22] hallelujah thank God
[1:39:24] and so see that barber and other people
[1:39:26] they'll wrestle with is do we have three
[1:39:28] more agency or not does it now look look
[1:39:29] what Hussein gets him oh do we have
[1:39:31] three more agency or not does even
[1:39:33] matter if I serve God or go to church or
[1:39:35] not see because they don't understand
[1:39:36] the mystery
[1:39:38] thank God our eyes are open blessed are
[1:39:40] your eyes sister for they say blessed
[1:39:43] are your ear sister for they here praise
[1:39:45] God he's looked up to heaven and rejoice
[1:39:47] and thank
[1:39:49] these things are hidden from the eyes of
[1:39:50] the wise and prudent but they're
[1:39:51] revealed unto babes such as we're
[1:39:53] learned and see Rejoice because your
[1:39:55] name's written in heaven praise God ah
[1:39:58] Hallelujah
[1:40:00] amen bye
[1:40:05] remember proverbs 31 I preached this
[1:40:07] years ago when William first came there
[1:40:09] are seasons of life for that Proverbs 31
[1:40:11] Woman
[1:40:13] when the children were there she was
[1:40:15] busy making sure they were dressed in
[1:40:17] crimson whatever that means
[1:40:20] and her lamp never went out by night
[1:40:23] she wasn't making business deals when
[1:40:25] the kids were throwing up
[1:40:28] she wasn't working with her hands sewing
[1:40:30] all those blankets and things together
[1:40:31] while the kids were throwing up or had
[1:40:33] chickenpox or whatever they had their
[1:40:35] seasons of life
[1:40:37] praise God
[1:40:40] because all these seasons are in God's
[1:40:43] Sovereign timing
[1:40:47] Hallelujah almost done
[1:40:50] I want to close to this because this was
[1:40:51] I thought was the most
[1:40:53] important thing well I got two more
[1:40:55] things
[1:40:57] it's hard to close
[1:41:05] what I what really touched me was just
[1:41:08] when brother cam was preaching about
[1:41:11] God's grace
[1:41:13] and if we make a mistake just come back
[1:41:15] to God
[1:41:19] and God if we don't do it right away
[1:41:21] then God and his love will come find us
[1:41:25] we said with Adam and Eve right
[1:41:27] he'll come find us
[1:41:29] the main thing is God really loves us
[1:41:32] amen sings that song that song is true
[1:41:35] I don't know I don't know if all the
[1:41:36] lyrics are right on that but that course
[1:41:37] is right God really loves us praise God
[1:41:41] Adam and Eve have everything right they
[1:41:43] had no reason to fall but they fell
[1:41:45] anyway
[1:41:47] God didn't say I'm done with you bunch
[1:41:48] of rebels he said bring some bring some
[1:41:51] Lambs over here let's slam let me clothe
[1:41:53] my naked children Ah that's just what
[1:41:55] they needed was their shame to be gone
[1:41:57] so God took away their shame just like
[1:41:59] he does for you and I takes away our
[1:42:01] guilt and shame praise God
[1:42:03] because words children praise God
[1:42:06] takes it away because of his love for us
[1:42:11] what was another thought in football we
[1:42:13] had a saying I don't know if Brother Ray
[1:42:15] played football or not but we had a
[1:42:16] saying it was called Turn the Page
[1:42:19] in other words if you had a bad play man
[1:42:21] I messed it up on that one
[1:42:23] Turn the Page because there's another
[1:42:24] play coming in other words you don't
[1:42:26] have time to worry about what happened
[1:42:27] the last play
[1:42:29] if you focus on that you're going to be
[1:42:31] a failure of the rest of the game and
[1:42:32] that's true I've experienced that
[1:42:35] I've had coaches cuss me out and make I
[1:42:38] made all kinds of mistakes on the
[1:42:39] football field and I had to learn to
[1:42:41] turn the page you got to forget about
[1:42:43] that you got to forget about the heirs
[1:42:44] and you got to move on and focus on
[1:42:46] right now
[1:42:47] and that's what I felt like brother
[1:42:48] Cam's message was saying Church we're
[1:42:50] all going to battle Satan's got a punch
[1:42:51] on us every day we got to come to the
[1:42:53] house of God confess our sins and know
[1:42:55] that God loves me just as much now as he
[1:42:57] always did
[1:42:59] and if God's true then he took my sins
[1:43:01] and he threw him in the sea of
[1:43:03] forgetfulness as soon as I prayed for
[1:43:04] them dinner brother Ramsay confess your
[1:43:07] sins before you come in this prayer line
[1:43:08] because if not it's going to be called
[1:43:10] out but if you confess them I can't even
[1:43:12] see them he said amen
[1:43:15] God God hides them from me because God
[1:43:17] hides it from the devil too praise God
[1:43:20] he hides them from himself in other
[1:43:22] words he he chooses to forget them he
[1:43:24] cast them to see a forgetfulness and he
[1:43:26] doesn't hold us against him in other
[1:43:27] words we have to have a short-term
[1:43:28] memory
[1:43:31] move on sincerely confess sincerely move
[1:43:34] on Turn the Page and let's move on where
[1:43:37] God wants to work right now
[1:43:42] I had to learn that football and now I'm
[1:43:43] saying wow a lot of these lessons
[1:43:45] kind of carry over to my life my
[1:43:47] spiritual life
[1:43:49] forget about the mistakes I made
[1:43:50] yesterday I gotta fight right now
[1:43:52] I can't change yesterday
[1:43:55] but I can change right now
[1:43:57] and I can change tomorrow too
[1:43:59] I can plant good seas and I can Harvest
[1:44:02] them tomorrow
[1:44:04] like we're seeing with our young ones
[1:44:06] people say well bro just how do your
[1:44:07] children get like that because we plant
[1:44:08] a lot of seeds my wife plant a lot of
[1:44:10] seeds at the house
[1:44:11] they've sat through a lot of sermons
[1:44:13] bless this guy right here he sat through
[1:44:14] a lot of the sermons he went up there

[1:45:22] foreign
[1:45:23] six very familiar scripture now getting
[1:45:26] back to all this revival bringing it
[1:45:27] first full circle back to Evan Roberts
[1:45:29] William Seymour these sisters that these
[1:45:32] young young ladies that started the
[1:45:34] Revival
[1:45:35] all they were doing was following God's
[1:45:37] leading
[1:45:39] God was drawing them for a sovereign
[1:45:41] move of God
[1:45:44] in church what does the Bible say
[1:45:46] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:45:47] him so all these individuals we talk
[1:45:50] about these Heroes of the faith all they
[1:45:52] did was just have faith in what God was
[1:45:53] calling them to do
[1:45:55] we can only do what God is calling us to
[1:45:58] do
[1:45:59] God's not asking you to do something
[1:46:00] he's not asking you to do he's only
[1:46:02] asking you to do one thing praise God
[1:46:06] and just have faith in what God has
[1:46:08] called you to do
[1:46:09] for most of us it's parenting or spouses
[1:46:12] right
[1:46:14] find what God has called you to do
[1:46:17] and be faithful with it
[1:46:20] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:46:22] that his honey believe God is God
[1:46:25] how many believe God sent you to Earth
[1:46:26] at this time
[1:46:28] how do you believe God guided you for
[1:46:30] this very moment right here
[1:46:31] absolutely who how many believe God put
[1:46:34] the clothes on your back
[1:46:36] the food on your table the gas in your
[1:46:38] tank
[1:46:40] the shoes on your feet
[1:46:42] God did it all honey believe God sent
[1:46:44] his son to die for your sins on the
[1:46:46] cross Hallelujah I believe that well
[1:46:48] you're on the you got the first step
[1:46:50] praise God you must believe that he is
[1:46:52] God and next he's rewarder of them that
[1:46:56] diligently seek him praise God that's
[1:46:59] what these Saints did
[1:47:00] they went to diligent seeking and church
[1:47:03] that's what we do when we come to church
[1:47:04] we're diligently seeking God
[1:47:07] and God will reward all of our efforts
[1:47:10] we just have to surrender to what God is
[1:47:12] leading us to do
[1:47:14] God LED Seymour God LED Evan Roberts
[1:47:18] God LED those young teenage girls into
[1:47:21] their prayer and singing and worshiping
[1:47:23] God LED them that and they had faith and
[1:47:25] they knew if I just seek God
[1:47:27] will be rewarded for this at some point
[1:47:31] what did Brother Adam say he said meet
[1:47:32] up he said if anybody gets Credit in
[1:47:34] this family give it to who sister Mita
[1:47:38] because I couldn't be out here on the
[1:47:39] field except she was there taking care
[1:47:42] of my kids
[1:47:43] is that right Church
[1:47:47] and what did Brother Adam say about the
[1:47:48] sisters
[1:47:49] he he said when you were ironing your
[1:47:51] clothes for your husband
[1:47:53] he says it's as if you're ironing the
[1:47:55] clothes for Jesus
[1:47:57] as you serve your husband you're serving
[1:48:00] Christ
[1:48:02] praise God
[1:48:04] the Bible says the husband and wife are
[1:48:06] joint Heirs of the the rewards of Life
[1:48:09] the Bible says
[1:48:10] praise God
[1:48:13] so in other words it's diligently doing
[1:48:15] what God has called you to do
[1:48:18] and in that diligent obedience just
[1:48:20] following God every day starting over
[1:48:22] fresh lord it's a new day it's a fresh
[1:48:23] start I'm going to put tomorrow behind

[1:48:35] to remember but I told you sorry my dad

[1:48:38] the very first thing he said was in 1950
[1:48:41] my dad said something also offered me at
[1:48:43] Christmas he was still living in 1950.
[1:48:47] that was
[1:48:48] almost 70 years ago
[1:48:51] right we don't want to live in the past
[1:48:53] we want to press on towards the mark of
[1:48:56] the High Calling of God in Christ we
[1:48:57] want to forget yeah we want to forgive
[1:48:59] that we want to forgive before we move
[1:49:00] on we're going to forgive
[1:49:02] and then we're going to press on towards
[1:49:03] the mark of the High Calling of God in
[1:49:05] Christ Jesus
[1:49:06] and know that God sees all of our
[1:49:08] efforts
[1:49:09] to diligently seek him
[1:49:12] there's going to be scenes of Our Lives
[1:49:13] where we can seek God more diligently
[1:49:15] but in all we do to glorify God it's all
[1:49:17] service unto God
[1:49:19] there's no days wasted Church
[1:49:22] God sees every day
[1:49:24] Hallelujah does he not
[1:49:28] he sees every single day
[1:49:31] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:49:33] seek him
[1:49:34] the main thing is let's keep seeking God
