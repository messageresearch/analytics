[13:56] let's take our bibles here tonight by
[13:58] god's grace let's go to jeremiah 29.
[14:05] go to verse 12 jeremiah 29 12. i'd like
[14:07] to
[14:09] kind of preach a
[14:10] sermon
[14:11] brother amen had a good question for me
[14:13] sunday after the service
[14:15] i thought i'll just preach a sermon on
[14:16] that by god's grace
[14:24] i just want to call it just simply how
[14:26] to know god's will for any promise
[14:28] so look at that hot enough i know god's
[14:30] will for any promise i don't know
[14:31] brother amen told you that but he and i
[14:33] were talking about that
[14:37] i don't know if he talked about it i
[14:38] just thought that's a great question and
[14:40] i thought it'd be good to review it
[14:43] uh let's see
[14:46] i'm gonna text up here
[14:48] is it on you guys turn on the live
[14:50] stream
[14:57] jeremiah 29
[14:59] amen
[15:00] hallelujah
[15:02] good stuff praise god all right
[15:05] glory
[15:06] so how to know god's will for any
[15:08] promise any promise
[15:12] uh we'll just
[15:13] look at a couple scriptures here i guess
[15:15] we'll just read three briefly
[15:18] uh let's read uh jeremiah 29
[15:23] now 11 verse 11 is one of the most
[15:25] beautiful scriptures
[15:26] some people think of the whole bible
[15:28] so i'll read that for i know the
[15:30] thoughts that i think toward you say the
[15:31] lord thoughts of peace and not of evil
[15:33] to give you unexpected and how many
[15:35] weren't expecting them
[15:37] this is spoken to israel when they're in
[15:39] babylon
[15:40] jeremiah wrote the letter it was taken
[15:42] to babylon
[15:43] israel is out of the promised land and
[15:45] god says i have thoughts of peace for
[15:47] you even though you're you're slaves and
[15:49] captives in another nation i have
[15:50] thoughts of peace for you i'm going to
[15:51] give you an expected end in other words
[15:53] you can know what to expect
[15:54] praise god praise the lord verse 12
[15:56] let's read 12 and 13 together one two
[15:58] three then shall he call upon me and he
[16:02] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[16:05] hearken unto you
[16:07] and ye shall send thee and find me when
[16:10] he shall search for me with all your
[16:13] heart amen i look at verse 14 and i'll
[16:15] be found of you save the lord
[16:18] so how is how are they going to find the
[16:19] will of god they've got to seek god's
[16:21] will
[16:22] god tells them i have all these thoughts
[16:23] i have all the expected ends but they've
[16:25] got to do a human element they've got to
[16:26] seek god now doesn't this line up with
[16:28] what jesus said you must love god with
[16:30] all your heart
[16:31] soul
[16:32] mind and strength
[16:34] what's the greatest commandment to love
[16:36] god so what is the greatest expression
[16:37] of love of god seeking god's will
[16:40] for your life
[16:41] with all that you have all your strength
[16:44] all your time all your being
[16:46] you'll find that as
[16:47] the opportunity that's the area where
[16:49] you find the will of god
[16:50] praise god let's have one more word of
[16:51] prayer here
[16:52] for any promise of god heavenly father
[16:54] we just thank you lord for your word

[17:39] will for any promise that we have some
[17:41] uh slides here male kind of sure
[17:43] about god's grace
[17:48] so brother amen and i were talking and i
[17:50] just thought well as a pastor i just i
[17:52] thought we'll be good for our people to
[17:53] go back over that i thought brother
[17:54] amen's got that question sometimes i've
[17:56] had questions about that
[17:58] sure
[17:59] and i thought well i think i'll just
[18:00] preach that
[18:02] uh just
[18:03] you know today by god's grace
[18:05] also i just want to tell you you know we
[18:06] had such a wonderful time in the point
[18:07] thank you for the sacrifices everybody
[18:09] made to go it was really wonderful
[18:12] okay the power's out so i gotta put new
[18:14] batteries in but um
[18:18] this one tell you know a lot of people
[18:19] were blessed by the services and by the
[18:20] specials they really enjoyed those
[18:22] thank you for doing all that
[18:25] and uh
[18:26] you know i think you know there's many
[18:27] highlights you know just being around
[18:29] the saints you know my wife asked me
[18:30] what was the best part of the weekend i
[18:31] said
[18:32] well everything
[18:33] but as i drove back and i meditated on
[18:36] things uh after the sunday service
[18:39] before we went to the graduation party
[18:42] i just had something just a little
[18:44] unexpected you know my mother-in-law
[18:45] came up to me
[18:47] and saints she sat through my three-hour
[18:49] sermon on priests three hours on
[18:51] saturday night
[18:52] two hours or two and a half on sunday
[18:55] she came up after me after the service
[18:56] on sunday and she said
[18:58] uh jesse i just want to tell you i
[19:00] really love hearing to come hearing you
[19:02] preach
[19:05] and
[19:06] he said you said the law i shared so
[19:08] many things that i had questions about
[19:10] blessed god
[19:11] and she started crying praise god
[19:15] praise the lord i never thought i'd see
[19:16] that
[19:19] when we first come in the message she
[19:20] was totally against us
[19:22] she said you guys are nicole all these
[19:24] things
[19:25] and now she comes to the services
[19:28] we listen to her son-in-law who acts
[19:30] crazy he looks like he's crazy fighting
[19:32] bees and everything like that
[19:33] swat knowing everything spitting and
[19:35] running and jumping
[19:37] and i should come and shall weep
[19:39] at the word of god wonderful
[19:42] it took 20 years but was it worth the
[19:44] church amen i better believe it's worth
[19:46] it
[19:47] so i'll tell you god is doing something
[19:49] you know the bible said don't despise
[19:50] the day of small things amen this is not
[19:52] the mission the missionary age was the
[19:54] day where the most number of souls would
[19:55] be saved the other man told us that it
[19:58] was the age of the open door the man
[19:59] said now though the door is closing when
[20:01] we see these people come in and we see
[20:03] their hearts softening we got to rejoice
[20:05] in that sure
[20:06] we need to be thankful yes sir to be
[20:09] encouraged so brother austin you know
[20:10] you wait 20 years to selena laura
[20:12] terry's you've been wait 20 years wait
[20:14] 20 years for your loved ones we just
[20:15] stood there showing love and you know
[20:17] what my mother-in-law's been to other
[20:19] families houses and she comes back from
[20:21] our house saying
[20:22] your family is different
[20:26] that's the holy spirit
[20:28] goes to all the families
[20:30] of god she needs our house brother
[20:32] there's a different spirit there praise
[20:34] god
[20:35] you don't ask for it she just tells us
[20:37] glory to god and now she's coming to
[20:39] church crying good day
[20:41] i think that's the highlight
[20:43] sure
[20:44] amen
[20:45] the lord
[20:47] so i just thought i'd share that you
[20:48] know just to encourage your church
[20:49] i've been preaching since 2004 you know
[20:53] so 18 years i've been preaching and
[20:56] i told my wife this i thought my mother
[20:58] would come and hear me preach more than
[21:00] my mother-in-law
[21:02] because my mom was more involved in
[21:04] church but look who god is bringing here
[21:06] at this time now it's all the time and
[21:07] season that's right
[21:09] but the one we thought maybe
[21:12] wouldn't
[21:13] wouldn't even like it now is enjoying it
[21:15] she was smiling all throughout the
[21:16] service i saw her holding where's jenna
[21:18] she's probably sleeping i always put him
[21:20] to sleep
[21:23] you know that's
[21:24] that's just an encouragement yes it is
[21:26] it's the greatest miracle yes it is it's
[21:29] a repentant heart so we'll look and see
[21:30] you know we'll watch stephanie you know
[21:32] watch my mother-in-law and just just
[21:33] keep loving keep manifesting the word
[21:36] god has a time and season for everything
[21:38] so we we want to find how to know uh
[21:41] god's will for any promise i want to go
[21:44] quickly to matthew seven we'll just read
[21:46] some scriptures here let me set a timer
[21:48] uh
[21:49] i don't have work tomorrow but i want to
[21:50] get
[21:51] exactly okay well a couple you have one
[21:52] tomorrow
[21:54] but the kids don't have school tomorrow
[21:56] that's a nice part but we're going to
[21:57] honor the people working tomorrow but
[22:00] let me know sorry
[22:04] i promise i'm not going to freeze three
[22:05] hours like friday or saturday okay i'll
[22:07] try not to
[22:08] try not to eclipse that there's such a
[22:10] good anointing there and the brothers
[22:11] came out i couldn't believe it was three
[22:13] hours
[22:14] they said it seemed like it was uh
[22:16] it seemed like it went so fast
[22:18] i hope that's how it was i hope that's
[22:20] how it works
[22:22] matthew 7 7-8
[22:24] but cam said that
[22:27] saturday night service was just
[22:28] discerning a lot of the pride problems
[22:29] he's seen in the church
[22:31] he preached on the pride of life you
[22:32] know and
[22:33] uh
[22:34] sarah he said that just discerned so
[22:36] many problems people were having really
[22:38] pride always manifested in contention
[22:40] right and division
[22:41] and so he said that sermon spoke to
[22:43] numerous situations so hopefully that
[22:45] will
[22:46] strengthen the church it'll bring the
[22:47] church to
[22:49] a higher place in god with humility
[22:51] praise god
[22:53] god help us to be humble on god's grace
[22:55] yeah jesus says in matthew 7 7 ask and
[22:58] it shall be given you seek and ye shall
[23:00] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[23:01] you notice jesus gives three different
[23:04] uh kind of examples of how you can seek
[23:06] god to know god's will for any promise
[23:09] first you can ask in prayer
[23:11] right right then you can seek what would
[23:12] you seek well you would seek the word of
[23:14] god you could seek through prayer
[23:16] uh there's different ways to seek god's
[23:18] will
[23:19] and then knock okay so actively
[23:22] actively engage you know
[23:24] approaching god knock and god says it
[23:27] will be open to you
[23:29] did he say wait a year and there or did
[23:31] he say six months or did he say five
[23:33] years in there
[23:35] no he just puts it as a general thing
[23:38] we don't know how long it's going to be
[23:41] just like he said lay hands on the sick
[23:42] and they shall recover he didn't say
[23:44] when they'd recover he just said they
[23:46] shall recover praise god
[23:48] so we get the same idea here it's it's
[23:50] in god's time it's in god's season right
[23:54] but he says if we do ask we shall
[23:56] receive now we also know remember from
[23:58] hebrews 11 there's some that went uh
[24:00] down in the grave many of the old
[24:01] testament states died not inheriting
[24:03] certain promises
[24:05] like abraham didn't see the fullness of
[24:07] what his seed would become
[24:09] he didn't see the two million right like
[24:11] like that came out of egypt he didn't
[24:13] see that praise god but he was promised
[24:15] your seed will be like the stars of
[24:16] heaven amen but he saw a partial
[24:19] manifestation of it
[24:20] right like we would say
[24:22] the whole mountain wasn't moved right
[24:24] the whole the whole prayer wasn't
[24:26] answered but it was partially answered
[24:29] okay
[24:31] so we want to uh brother ram tells us
[24:33] you know in the sermon court trial you
[24:34] haven't listened that lately i haven't
[24:36] either but it just kind of comes to my
[24:37] mind the man tells us that you know
[24:39] there's lots of skeptics that will go on
[24:40] trial against god and one of them is mr
[24:42] impatient yeah
[24:44] right they'll argue and say well god
[24:47] said but it hasn't happened yet but the
[24:49] counter to that the defense is god never
[24:51] said when right
[24:53] right unless he did tell you when like
[24:55] like he told uh he told israel you'll be
[24:57] back here in 70 years well then you know
[25:00] right
[25:01] but if he doesn't tell you the time you
[25:03] just got to trust him you've just got to
[25:05] be patient you got to have confidence in
[25:07] god you have to believe god's word
[25:10] you have to manifest some abrahamic
[25:11] faith
[25:12] amen you gotta
[25:15] you gotta show that you're really the
[25:17] seed of abraham amen
[25:19] and hear the word of god believe it
[25:22] and
[25:23] rest upon it praise god
[25:25] and the other one is revelation
[25:26] 1 verse 10.
[25:29] this is of course overran fixes up in
[25:31] the church eight book and makes a great
[25:32] deal of this verse
[25:34] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[25:36] and heard behind me a great voice
[25:38] as of a trumpet so notice he gets in the
[25:41] holy spirit and then he hears the voice
[25:43] and then it begins speaking to him i am
[25:45] alpha and omega and brother and tell us
[25:48] we'll get to this later but brother says
[25:49] that's the key to being a christian is
[25:51] getting in the spirit
[25:53] now we know there's a couple different
[25:54] keys or secrets right the one we went
[25:56] over the other secret a few weeks ago
[25:58] the secret is when the devil says don't
[26:00] don't serve god as much you serve more
[26:02] right when the devil says stop serving
[26:04] god or decrease your service you say
[26:07] i'll do more for god
[26:12] before you try to do a word of god get
[26:15] in the spirit first amen
[26:17] that's another secret praise god
[26:20] it's another way to make sure you please
[26:22] god before you ask god anything or
[26:24] before you try to manifest the a promise
[26:26] of god or before you try to act upon
[26:28] anything first get under the anointing
[26:30] of the holy spirit amen
[26:33] brother i said go through get in the
[26:35] spirit first then go through the acts
[26:38] right and he gives numerous examples
[26:40] like uh acts 2 38 he says if you really
[26:43] repent
[26:44] in acts 2 38 he said and go get in the
[26:46] spirit of repentance he said you'll get
[26:48] the holy ghost
[26:49] eventually
[26:51] but some people just hear they know it's
[26:52] a revelation they can see lord jesus
[26:54] christ fathers and holy ghosts we've
[26:56] seen hundreds of them or maybe scores of
[26:58] them they get baptized but then they go
[27:00] back out in the world right they go back
[27:01] out to denominations and never they
[27:03] never got the spirit of repenting and
[27:06] really uh separating themselves from the
[27:08] dead works the bible says remember the
[27:10] first doctrine of being a christian is
[27:12] repentance from dead works leaving all
[27:14] dead work in other words you want all
[27:16] your works to be holy you want your
[27:18] hands to do holy things you don't want
[27:19] to do anything wrong you want to be like
[27:21] jesus you want to do us right amen
[27:24] the first word
[27:26] is to repent from all dead works
[27:28] according to hebrews six verses one two
[27:30] three that's the i just put that youtube
[27:31] video out this week so it's kind of
[27:32] fresh on my mind amen that's it that's
[27:34] right and there's six of those
[27:36] foundational doctrines the first one is
[27:39] repentance from dead works that's why
[27:41] denominations never get to really
[27:43] sanctification they never really repent
[27:46] from all their dead works
[27:49] now you and i should right
[27:52] you and i do by the grace of god
[27:55] all right
[27:57] now
[27:58] in 2016 i taught a little message on
[28:00] divine healing and how to approach it so
[28:02] i'm going to
[28:03] just briefly review that and then come
[28:05] back to these other thoughts that we
[28:07] have so just bear with me here
[28:09] as i switch over to slide 31
[28:14] now the first thing uh program tells us
[28:16] is to confess all sins and of course
[28:18] this is the bible telling us this as
[28:19] well not just about the brahman uh
[28:21] brother graham everything that
[28:22] everything that we believe from him
[28:24] comes from the bible praise god
[28:27] the bible says now i'm sorry for all the
[28:29] caps i know it's hard to read but this
[28:30] is from like uh
[28:32] six years ago
[28:34] if our heart condemn us god is greater
[28:36] than our heart and knoweth all things
[28:37] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[28:39] we have confidence toward god
[28:42] so see church this is why sometimes
[28:43] we're not confident when we're hearing
[28:44] them preaching
[28:46] we're not confident when we're praying
[28:47] it's because we're not not believing the
[28:49] word of god
[28:50] right or we know there's some be setting
[28:52] sin in our lives
[28:54] and so because we know that's there we
[28:55] know we haven't dealt with it or we
[28:56] haven't taken care of the situation we
[28:58] don't really have confidence in god
[29:01] church before we even
[29:02] before we even listen to the sermon we
[29:04] should repent of our sins that should
[29:06] give us confidence amen amen praise god
[29:11] all right now
[29:12] got to pull on the word here church
[29:13] tonight
[29:15] got a pawn in the word
[29:19] see that's why if we're lacking
[29:21] confidence it's because satan has
[29:24] weakened us right
[29:26] and so the way to overcome satan is to
[29:28] use the word of god amen
[29:30] [Music]
[29:31] he's not a dumb devil he's not a stupid
[29:33] devil he's so very wise very smart he
[29:36] tricks you every day that's right
[29:39] if he's dumb and he tricks you then what
[29:41] does that make you
[29:44] right church
[29:45] now of course he's done compared to god
[29:47] but we don't name call like that
[29:50] even michael the archangel wouldn't do
[29:52] that
[29:53] but we're talking about having
[29:54] confidence the way we can have
[29:55] confidence is to believe god's word take
[29:57] god at his word amen
[30:01] and then church whatever you ask
[30:03] you receive of him because we keep his
[30:05] commands
[30:07] and do those things that are pleasing in
[30:08] his sight and the church said
[30:11] it didn't say when you receive them it
[30:12] just said you're going to receive them
[30:14] amen if you keep confidence in god's
[30:17] word amen
[30:19] if we can be confident that god backs up
[30:21] what he says amen
[30:24] that god's a miracle working god he's a
[30:25] waymaker a promise keeper all these
[30:28] things that god cares about our desires
[30:30] if we believe these things and keep
[30:31] confident the bible says if we ask them
[30:34] and we keep and we obey the word of god
[30:36] we shall receive them amen amen
[30:39] we've received some lately i'm just
[30:40] going to rehearse lately
[30:42] the devil kind of whispers in my ear
[30:44] sometimes and said god is doing nothing
[30:46] in your church i say you liar get behind
[30:48] me satan amen hallelujah god do
[30:51] something mother-in-law's life i just
[30:52] seen that amen
[30:53] gotta do something in stephanie's life
[30:56] hopefully she's listening for i don't
[30:57] know how old your mom is but 50 or 60 or
[30:59] whatever she is
[31:00] for all those years she's been against
[31:02] church but all of a sudden when austin
[31:03] come back and lena come back the holy
[31:05] spirit moved on her heart she started
[31:07] weeping and said i've got to get back to
[31:09] church
[31:10] and where did god send her he said her
[31:11] to us
[31:13] he could have sent her anywhere we would
[31:15] have been rejoicing
[31:16] as long as it was a good church but god
[31:18] sent her here god is moving he's turning
[31:21] hearts of stone to hearts of flesh amen
[31:23] amen hallelujah amen
[31:27] true jose's heart
[31:31] the doctor said it was an absolute
[31:32] miracle he's alive
[31:34] did you know austin that whole day
[31:36] when when jose
[31:38] jose was sick all day saturday
[31:41] the heart the heart was hurting him all
[31:42] day saturday did you know that he was
[31:44] laying in bed do you know that whole day
[31:45] austin's heart was hurting him when you
[31:47] guys went to the zoo was that right was
[31:48] it the zoo
[31:50] so at the same time jose was laying in
[31:52] bed
[31:53] and he laid there for 18 hours with a
[31:55] heart attack 18 hours until he finally
[31:57] went to the er
[32:00] i'm sorry it's friday it's friday all
[32:02] day friday late there
[32:03] i'm sorry it's all friday night sorry
[32:05] all friday night into saturday morning
[32:06] he finally went there saturday morning
[32:08] as soon as he got there at the er
[32:11] nobody was there that hardly ever
[32:12] happens every walk in the er usually
[32:14] it's packed
[32:15] now the last time i took who who did i
[32:17] take jenner yeah jen
[32:19] and it was totally empty that was god's
[32:20] blessing to us
[32:22] but uh jose got the same thing
[32:25] as soon as he walked in there it was
[32:26] right in there they got right to the
[32:27] medic it's in right
[32:29] and they took that thing he said put it
[32:30] through the vein and they broke up that
[32:31] little clot in his heart i mean
[32:34] it's amazing technology they got
[32:37] anyways the whole time he was hurting
[32:39] austin was hurting
[32:41] and then he texts the brothers can you
[32:42] pray and brother austin prayed for him
[32:44] amen brother amen prayed for him i
[32:46] prayed for him i'm sure many of you
[32:47] others i just went in the prayer closet
[32:49] and had a little prayer for him
[32:51] and as soon as i get there he said just
[32:53] minutes before i got there on a sunday
[32:54] morning before church he said all the
[32:56] pain went away praise god
[32:58] just our prayers
[33:00] the doctor looked at him said it's a
[33:01] miracle that you're still here amen
[33:04] i don't know you know we can't overlook
[33:06] these things amen amen god is gracious
[33:08] your prayers so it's like god gave
[33:11] austin a burden to be able to pray for
[33:12] him because he was going through the
[33:14] heart pain as well
[33:18] see god works on both ends
[33:20] and so austin would have had a greater
[33:22] and he probably did have a greater
[33:23] burden of prey than maybe than other
[33:25] some of us
[33:26] because he was actually suffering along
[33:27] with it
[33:33] how about haven't been praying for her
[33:34] friends to be saved for years and one of
[33:37] them just got baptized two weeks ago
[33:40] hallelujah and now she's texting lydia
[33:42] to try to be friends olivia keep it up
[33:44] lily you just stay honor okay
[33:46] that's another thing for you to remember
[33:47] but you're 17 you got a good memory
[33:49] stay honored to show her the love of god
[33:51] hating you keep showing your love of god
[33:52] see years of prayers years of prayers
[33:54] amen amen hallelujah god doesn't always
[33:57] work overnight god wants us to be strong
[33:59] in faith giving god glory amen amen
[34:02] whether we see anything or not he wants
[34:03] us to be soldiers he wants us to be men
[34:05] and women of vision let's see the word
[34:07] of god and know that if god's word is
[34:09] true it will come to pass
[34:13] true
[34:14] sister lina come up here for a few weeks
[34:15] ago for her sister who was being uh
[34:18] mistreated badly
[34:20] and she prayed for deliverance we were

[37:22] better believe it's true amen you better
[37:25] believe
[37:26] we just don't know when it's going to
[37:28] happen now sometimes it's our fault it
[37:30] doesn't come to pass
[37:31] but god will forgive us god will deal
[37:33] with us with that that's true but what
[37:35] do we gotta do church if our heart
[37:36] condemn us just confess all your sin
[37:39] confess any sin and then you can have
[37:41] confidence again
[37:42] so now i'm gonna pray again i've
[37:44] confessed all my sins let's pray again
[37:46] let's ask god to move amen that's true
[37:49] that's why church don't be afraid
[37:51] if you have a need tonight or something
[37:53] right afterwards just because it's
[37:54] wednesday god has been moving on
[37:55] wednesdays amen god has been answering
[37:57] on wednesday nights amen hallelujah
[38:00] and just goes to show god answered god
[38:02] answers whenever we're in condition and
[38:04] whenever it's his will
[38:08] the bible says if you abide in me my
[38:09] words abide in you you shall ask what
[38:11] you will and it shall be done unto you
[38:12] didn't say the time he just said he'd do
[38:14] it
[38:16] therefore saying to you whatsoever
[38:17] things you desire when you pray believe
[38:19] that you receive them you shall have
[38:20] them and when ye stand pray forgive
[38:23] you see we've got to confess our sins
[38:25] and forgive others that have hurt us
[38:27] if we expect god to forgive us we've got
[38:30] to forgive others
[38:32] god will not answer our prayers if we
[38:34] don't forgive other people
[38:37] you will be judged jesus said the very
[38:39] way you judge other people right
[38:41] i know i'm hard on certain people that
[38:43] have either left the word or criticized
[38:45] me or something but that's because i've
[38:47] gone to them and i've told them
[38:48] specifically or
[38:49] letter
[38:50] talked to them on the phone or emailed
[38:51] them or or sent them letters i told them
[38:54] exactly what they're wrong with
[38:56] and when they won't repent then they're
[38:58] they're going against the word of god
[39:01] right i don't have anything against them
[39:03] but i've told them the truth and now
[39:05] it's in their core are they going to
[39:06] repent and most times they don't
[39:08] that's okay
[39:09] god's in control vengeance is god's not
[39:13] mine
[39:14] vengeance is not yours vengeance belongs
[39:17] to god and actually we actually i don't
[39:18] even want veggies i just want mercy for
[39:20] these people amen the mercy of their
[39:23] repentance
[39:24] that's what we want praise god
[39:26] hallelujah forgive if you have ought
[39:29] against any that your father also which
[39:31] is in heaven may forgive you your
[39:32] trespasses
[39:34] we all got trespasses
[39:36] but if you do not forgive neither will
[39:38] your father which is heaven forgive your
[39:40] trespasses we must forgive others and
[39:43] then we can expect god to forgive us
[39:45] amen
[39:48] now also god honors integrity and purity
[39:50] so that every time god will hear your
[39:52] prayers just because of your
[39:53] faithfulness to him we saw that with
[39:55] hezekiah and i remember he was choosing
[39:57] the permissive will of god which was a
[39:58] bad choice but god still gave it to him
[40:01] which is amazing i i can't quite
[40:02] understand that but god is gracious
[40:04] that's all i can all i can think
[40:06] he said remember now how i walk before
[40:08] thee in truth how many walking in truth
[40:11] anyone else
[40:13] i am
[40:14] i'm walking the truth i'm not walking in
[40:16] a lie no
[40:18] this message is the truth amen amen amen
[40:20] because this message is the bible the
[40:22] message is the bible scriptures god is
[40:24] fulfilling right now praise god amen
[40:27] hallelujah
[40:28] i'm walking in truth with a perfect
[40:30] heart
[40:32] now this means of course a heart that
[40:33] just repents because no heart is perfect
[40:35] no one can ever go without sinning
[40:37] except jesus christ
[40:38] so this means someone who just confesses
[40:40] all the time and tries to live the best
[40:41] they can
[40:43] and he said you've done that which is
[40:45] good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
[40:49] so i love this god honors people that
[40:52] have integrity that walk in the truth
[40:54] that want to do what's right god will
[40:56] honor that and then god will hear their
[40:58] prayers don't the bible say the
[40:59] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[41:02] man prevails much church your prayers
[41:04] are powerful amen amen i just listened
[41:06] to your numerous examples of how
[41:08] powerful your prayers are amen amen
[41:13] hallelujah amen god hears our prayers
[41:19] we gotta live right yes
[41:21] we got a walking truth gotta have a
[41:23] perfect heart
[41:27] so that's the first thing confess all
[41:29] sins forgive all people second thing is
[41:31] ask for the will of god which will be a
[41:33] revelation
[41:34] right
[41:36] so confess your sins and then ask
[41:40] a leper came and worshiped jesus and
[41:42] lord if you will this is a perfect
[41:44] example lord if you will will you heal
[41:47] me
[41:48] he says i will
[41:51] praise god i love it amen lord will you
[41:54] that see that's why we gotta ask lord
[41:56] will you take away this lord will you
[41:58] forgive me of this lord will you save
[42:00] that person lord would you heal me of
[42:02] this we got to say is it your will lord
[42:05] if you will see we got to be neutral we
[42:07] got to be humble and say god it isn't
[42:09] your will
[42:11] see but most of the time we just want to
[42:13] boss god around if we're honest we just
[42:15] want to tell god what we want
[42:17] and that's a spoiled child
[42:19] right
[42:21] right i can tell which of my children
[42:23] have matured sister who into maturity
[42:25] and which ones are still
[42:26] so immature because the immature ones
[42:28] tell me daddy do this i'm like no i'm
[42:30] not going to do what you want me to do
[42:31] all the time
[42:33] but the other ones say daddy can i have
[42:34] this or daddy can you give me that or
[42:36] daddy can you get me socks or daddy
[42:38] daddy can you get me something daddy can
[42:39] you give me some mice for my snake
[42:42] can you do it you don't demand it
[42:45] because he's got an understanding
[42:48] it's dad's will
[42:50] hallelujah that's what i appreciate now
[42:51] okay
[42:52] it's dad's will not not my will let the
[42:55] fathers will be done hallelujah amen
[42:59] a church you're going to find there's
[43:00] sometimes where your will does light up
[43:01] with god's will
[43:03] and god will answer your request right
[43:05] away
[43:06] but it's not every time right now
[43:09] not every time
[43:12] we've got to be careful about that not
[43:14] ordering god around but we got to we've
[43:15] got to wait until we we uh we feel like
[43:18] we're in obedience and we've done what
[43:19] god has asked us to do
[43:27] jesus said verily verily i say to you
[43:28] the son can do
[43:30] everything of himself did i read that
[43:32] right no no
[43:34] jesus could not do anything of himself
[43:38] but what he sees the father do for what
[43:40] things so ever he doeth these also do
[43:42] the son likewise
[43:44] brother reported this and said jesus
[43:46] never healed anyone by his own will
[43:49] jesus always relied upon the will or the
[43:51] revelation of the father the church said
[43:53] amen now there are times god did heal
[43:55] through jesus and jesus didn't know
[43:57] about it like the woman with the blood
[43:58] issue he said who touched me
[44:00] and brother said he was not joking he
[44:02] didn't know who touched him no look at
[44:04] that god can even work
[44:06] outside of jesus is human flesh and
[44:08] human mind
[44:11] but he looked at her so daughter your
[44:13] faith has made me whole amen what was it
[44:16] it was the woman's faith pulling upon
[44:18] the gift of god she had a revelation if
[44:20] i can just god let her know beforehand
[44:23] if i can just touch him i'll be made
[44:25] whole jesus didn't know what's going to
[44:26] happen but she knew because she had a
[44:28] revelation church how important is
[44:30] revelation today
[44:34] revelation was so great that even jesus
[44:36] didn't know it that woman's revelation
[44:38] because god didn't let even his own son
[44:40] know about that
[44:42] that's true
[44:44] i can't do anything except the father
[44:46] shows me
[44:49] hallelujah amen so what is one of my
[44:51] sayings pray and ask god for revelation
[44:55] what we find though is that we get we
[44:57] get partial understanding of revelations
[44:59] i hope you understand me on this one
[45:01] like when austin when he told that
[45:03] testimony when he prayed for that what's
[45:04] her name karen
[45:06] kathy kathy ed coven
[45:09] austin was just
[45:10] he showed a dream that she was going to
[45:12] be well well he didn't say thus saith
[45:14] the lord he just had a real burden it
[45:15] was going to be
[45:16] healed so he had a partial understanding
[45:20] right
[45:21] but you can go out and say thus say the
[45:22] lord is going to be healed because
[45:24] you're not a prophet
[45:26] so that's what i'm saying in most of our
[45:28] cases
[45:29] we've got to be careful right and most
[45:31] of us are i mean i would say all the
[45:33] time we are
[45:34] we just gotta we gotta realize i'm not
[45:36] gonna be a prophet i may not know
[45:38] exactly the perfect will of god but i
[45:39] have a strong leading i have a strong
[45:41] burden to do something and i'm doing the
[45:43] best i can
[45:45] and of course we got to be careful not
[45:46] to make ourselves profits but at the
[45:48] same time follow the leading of the lord
[45:51] and be led by god to do god's works
[45:55] like i said that who is that being
[45:57] healed i didn't have thus saith the lord
[45:58] i just i just i just saw him now he died
[46:01] but was uh he died but was brought back
[46:03] i was woke up early with there's life in
[46:05] the tongue i just said it just seems
[46:07] it's just the perfect timing of god
[46:10] but the whole time i was hoping he'd be
[46:11] doing well i didn't have a revelation
[46:14] like i knew i just asked god because i
[46:16] felt the word of god was the timing was
[46:18] right
[46:19] you know and what i wasn't a prophet but
[46:22] now i look back and say well it's a
[46:23] revelation but i was just trying to keep
[46:25] the faith i was just trying to i i'm
[46:27] just trying to believe that the best i
[46:28] can does everyone understand amen
[46:34] what i'm saying is that when we get a
[46:35] revelation since we're not prophets we
[46:36] don't say thus save the lord many times
[46:39] amen
[46:42] if we do say thou said lord then we're a
[46:43] minor prophet
[46:45] and the church said amen
[46:47] hallelujah
[46:49] that we're a minor prophet
[46:53] glory
[46:55] now program says plainly
[46:58] i shouldn't make this smaller i'm sorry
[47:00] but man you got to first find the will
[47:02] of god you got to find the will of god
[47:04] this morning as you're coming to be
[47:05] prayed for you got to find the will of
[47:06] god whether it's god's will to heal you
[47:07] or not the first thing is to find out
[47:09] what god's will is and then if you
[47:11] really have received the seed in your
[47:13] heart then you can be persistent there's
[47:14] nothing going to move you yes sir find
[47:16] the will of god i'm not going to read
[47:17] all that because you understand
[47:21] then brother graham said he says if you
[47:23] want to be healed he said check your
[47:24] motive and objective there has to be a
[47:26] real objective to be in the will of god
[47:28] if you want to be well what do you want
[47:30] to be well for see if you want to be
[47:32] healed what's the reason you want to be
[47:33] healed what are you telling god what do
[47:35] you want to do with your life when you
[47:37] get healed see there's got to be you've
[47:39] got to have a motive and objective and
[47:41] they have to be right according to the
[47:42] will of god then
[47:44] then when the faith is revealed to you
[47:46] and by a sovereign grace places that
[47:47] faith in there then it's over see
[47:51] okay so now if we don't know god's will
[47:53] whether it's to heal or save or do
[47:54] something then we got to first repent of
[47:57] our sins right and then ask god and make
[47:59] sure our motive is right
[48:01] like i always pray this god i don't care
[48:03] who you save i just want to win souls
[48:06] and they don't have to come to my church
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] then my motive is right because it's not
[48:12] about building up my church or our
[48:14] church
[48:16] it's just that they get saved and they
[48:17] know jesus amen that's the motive and
[48:20] objective now the one time i did ask for
[48:22] somebody from this church it was brother
[48:23] amen and then you come along which was a
[48:25] great blessing
[48:27] hallelujah
[48:28] i said lord i'm either going to be stop
[48:30] pastoring and this is 2014 by the ray i
[48:32] said i said lord i'm either going to
[48:34] stop pastoring or go out as evangelist
[48:36] or you're going to save somebody in my
[48:38] ministry and send them into my church
[48:40] and that was brought with your brother
[48:41] amen and sister who came in
[48:43] so that that's about that's a gideon
[48:45] vibe
[48:46] everybody with
[48:47] that's a gideon sign
[48:50] and so there's times if you ask god for
[48:51] a sign then believe the sign
[48:54] if you know it's god
[48:56] don't say thou say the lord because
[48:57] you're not a prophet
[48:58] but believe the sign with all you got if
[49:00] you ask for it and god gives you do it
[49:03] then believe it but you gotta hang on
[49:05] amen
[49:06] amen
[49:07] you gotta hang on if you really believe
[49:09] it's god's word
[49:12] that was in the summer so let's say june
[49:14] june july august september it was
[49:16] november 2014 brother amen and
[49:17] sisterhood said we're making your church
[49:19] our home church
[49:20] so i had to wait five months brothers
[49:22] that ain't very long actually that's a
[49:23] really short time
[49:25] i made a vow i said lord i'm i'm leaving
[49:27] pastor if you don't send somebody in
[49:29] here
[49:31] amen
[49:32] see my motive and objective was i just
[49:34] want to preach i just want to do what
[49:36] god wants me to do you want me to be a
[49:37] pastor or manchester and so i asked god
[49:40] for a sign god gave me the sign so i
[49:42] stand here because god answered my
[49:43] prayer just like a real man or a
[49:45] daughter of god someone that believes
[49:47] god's word we just want to know god's
[49:49] will and then we can walk in it amen
[49:52] then i can preach to one two three four
[49:53] five ten people just as hard as i
[49:55] preached to a hundred people amen last
[49:57] weekend
[49:58] because it don't matter i know the will
[49:59] of god it doesn't care nothing else
[50:01] matters god has answered my prayer he's
[50:03] giving me the word he's giving me the
[50:05] revelation and now i've got to do my
[50:07] part carry out the revelation amen amen
[50:10] feed these souls that god sent to us
[50:13] feed these wonderful souls that god said
[50:14] to us hallelujah amen
[50:21] brother the god that saved your soul can
[50:23] you heal your body it's just the same
[50:25] reveal to you he's your healer as he was
[50:27] your savior but it's got to be revealed
[50:29] first that's the difference
[50:31] you have to have something to base your
[50:32] faith on
[50:35] see revelation first revelation first
[50:38] all right i'm gonna have to i got way
[50:39] too many quotes
[50:41] uh for this night i would say i mean for
[50:43] some night that might be good
[50:45] now i want to say this here here's where
[50:46] brother amy and i were talking and this
[50:48] is where we all have cases where we
[50:50] don't know because we're not profits
[50:52] we don't know sometimes god's will about
[50:55] some of our requests like our lost loved
[50:57] ones are they going to be saved
[50:59] god can't force them to be saved they've
[51:00] got to choose by his free will by their
[51:02] free will
[51:03] right
[51:05] so brother man tells us if you don't
[51:07] know it's best to hope and then trust
[51:09] god
[51:11] hope
[51:12] and trust god
[51:16] what do the three hebrew children say
[51:19] our god is able to deliver us but if not
[51:21] we will not serve your gods amen
[51:26] amen
[51:27] they walked into a burning flame of fire
[51:30] they didn't know it was god's will to
[51:31] save them it's true
[51:34] that sounds so encouraging to us because
[51:36] we don't know how the squeeze is going
[51:37] to play out right
[51:38] there the
[51:40] the rhetoric from the government is
[51:41] getting more aggressive see canada not
[51:42] taking away guns
[51:43] right when's that going to come to the
[51:44] u.s yeah
[51:46] it might it might not but it might
[51:49] they're trying to
[51:51] they're trying to uh disarm the people
[51:53] so they can do a purge that's what
[51:55] that's what that's what that's what the
[51:56] squeeze is eventually is going to turn
[51:58] into a purge if you don't take the mark
[52:00] of the beast they're going to purge the
[52:01] world the world of those people that
[52:02] turn on the mark of the beast sure which
[52:04] will be foolish virgin by god's grace
[52:07] because the true bride will be out of
[52:08] here amen right
[52:10] but if not see that's how it is we don't
[52:13] know exactly how the squeeze gonna play
[52:14] out
[52:16] we don't know how god's going to deliver
[52:17] us we don't know how it's going to go
[52:19] but one thing for sure we will not serve
[52:21] the roman catholic church we will not
[52:23] serve the world hollywood we will not
[52:25] serve them we'll serve jesus christ amen
[52:28] hallelujah and i just believe if god
[52:30] delivered them god will deliver us amen
[52:34] i don't know i just believe i'm hoping
[52:36] for it
[52:40] it's better to trust in men i'm sorry
[52:42] trust in the lord than to put confidence
[52:43] in man
[52:45] blessed is the man that trusts in the
[52:46] lord and whose hope
[52:48] the lord is see the lord is your hope
[52:50] jesus is your hope right
[52:52] he's your living hope hallelujah
[52:57] now if god reveals the word to you
[53:00] or gives you some type of like austin a
[53:02] dream
[53:03] or like me wow i woke up at 4 30 with
[53:06] just that scripture on my mind three
[53:07] scriptures but speak the word
[53:09] then you gotta hang on to that with all
[53:11] your heart
[53:12] act light it's gonna come to pass and
[53:14] the church said amen that's what the
[53:16] whole sermon i was listening to part of
[53:18] it today works his faith expressed
[53:20] that's what that whole sermon is about
[53:22] if you have faith
[53:24] in god's word then your works will show
[53:26] it
[53:28] if you believe god's going to save your
[53:30] mind if i believe god's going to save my
[53:31] mind then we've got to act like it
[53:34] amen
[53:36] because that's faith that's a revelation
[53:39] working out through your life
[53:43] now any promise you're seeking i know we
[53:45] know some of our situations some of the
[53:47] things you're praying for you've let me
[53:48] know
[53:50] if you don't know god's will you should
[53:51] still hope for what you want
[53:53] make sure your motive and objective is
[53:55] right and then act like god's going to
[53:57] answer it
[54:00] that's going to be my closing
[54:03] but i'm not closing right now
[54:06] i got 13 minutes on my 45 minutes so
[54:09] i've already preached 30 minutes hard to
[54:10] believe that but
[54:13] see once you get that then you got to
[54:15] act like it's going to happen that may
[54:17] be a long time you might get tested a
[54:19] little on the way and you might stumble
[54:21] and fall but get encouraged again
[54:22] because that's what happened to abraham
[54:24] amen
[54:25] that's what happened to your dad abraham
[54:27] and the church said amen that was that's
[54:29] what happened to the father of faith
[54:32] but the bible says he's staggered not so
[54:34] through the blood through the power of
[54:36] the blood covenant the blood doesn't
[54:37] recourse your mistakes the blood doesn't
[54:39] remember your shortcomings the blood
[54:41] doesn't remember your failure the blood
[54:43] forgives all that jesus looks at you
[54:45] through his own blood amen
[54:47] and he sees perfection he sees a
[54:49] finished product he sees a real son or
[54:51] daughter of god with a white washed
[54:53] garment on amen amen
[54:56] you are not clothed in your
[54:57] righteousness you're clothed in jesus
[55:00] righteousness amen
[55:01] hallelujah
[55:03] that's what makes you holy is because
[55:05] the holy spirit's anointing you amen
[55:08] that's your righteousness is the holy
[55:10] spirit upon you now it's hard to see
[55:12] some smiles in some amen amen
[55:15] hallelujah amen that's your
[55:17] righteousness
[55:18] amen the righteousness of the saints the
[55:20] bible says amen
[55:24] there's lots of examples
[55:25] of people who got revelations and then
[55:27] had to act upon it abel mary moses david
[55:30] john the baptist
[55:32] and that man uh from africa he bought
[55:36] his baby shoes even before his feet were
[55:39] healed
[55:43] hallelujah so he had faith he knew
[55:45] what's gonna happen said the feet are
[55:46] gonna be healed she went out and bought
[55:48] shoes before they got healed
[55:50] that's real faith
[55:52] he's acting upon the revelation that he
[55:54] was given
[55:56] sure
[55:58] okay then you express or act like you
[56:00] received it with your works yeah i kind
[56:01] of
[56:02] yeah he says if we're afraid to act on
[56:04] what we believe then we do not believe
[56:06] it
[56:07] right now that doesn't mean just one
[56:09] staggering moment of i'm i'm doubting
[56:12] i'm struggling that's not what it means
[56:14] it means if we just keep uh uh keep
[56:16] disbelieving or keep doubting for long
[56:18] long stretches of time
[56:20] church what i've found it just takes one
[56:23] good service and i can get my faith
[56:24] right back to where i needed school
[56:26] or one good prayer meeting yeah
[56:28] a one good sermon or one good song and
[56:30] just take glory it takes one minute one
[56:33] moment in the presence of god five
[56:35] minutes of the presence of jesus christ
[56:37] can change everything
[56:39] hallelujah
[56:44] you know i ought to be more encouraged
[56:46] than ever if my mother-in-law who used
[56:47] to fight against me for 20 years can now
[56:49] sit through me preaching for five or six
[56:51] hours i ought to be really encouraged
[56:54] hallelujah
[56:56] sure from closing calling us colt and
[56:58] all these things to now coming and
[56:59] crying and enjoying the word of god i
[57:02] got so much out of that and she said
[57:03] thanks for your prayers and all that
[57:05] gave me a hug and everything
[57:07] we ought to be really encouraged
[57:09] mountains are moving rocks are moving
[57:12] god is moving god is faithful god is
[57:14] true
[57:17] blessed the lord
[57:20] our works express what faith we have
[57:24] but if we're afraid to act on what we
[57:25] believe then we do not believe it see
[57:27] you've got to believe it
[57:31] all right
[57:33] okay i'm going to get back to tonight
[57:34] here okay
[57:37] i'm already at 35 minutes okay
[57:41] now there's kind of two approaches
[57:42] church
[57:44] to divine healing uh sorry to receiving
[57:46] any promise of god there's kind of two
[57:47] approaches
[57:51] now brother branham told us his approach
[57:54] he says the promises are to everyone
[57:57] yet he knew that wasn't right and i'm
[57:58] going to show you the quote so i'm not
[57:59] making that up
[58:00] i would never want to make anything up
[58:04] that was his approach the promises are
[58:05] for
[58:06] everyone okay
[58:10] now the other approach is the one i've
[58:12] learned through brother graham's sermons
[58:15] okay
[58:17] so i felt like he hid it numerous all
[58:19] about i just showed you some of those
[58:20] perseverant quotes and then the church
[58:21] age book he puts them all through here
[58:23] and i feel like this is
[58:24] i think this is the mature approach but
[58:26] i could be wrong on that that's just my
[58:27] thought
[58:29] but my my
[58:30] my approach is that promises are to
[58:32] those whom god ordains in his perfect
[58:35] will
[58:36] and that's a lot
[58:38] but this is based upon what the bible
[58:40] said about how jesus operated his gifts
[58:47] god's promises are not for everyone as
[58:49] far as i can understand
[58:51] but they're to those that god ordains in
[58:54] this perfect will
[58:56] now here's the quote let's get down here
[58:59] he says we believe the word of god every
[59:01] promise that he made is true that's
[59:02] right it's about
[59:04] anybody who will accept it and now
[59:05] there's some who try to accept it and
[59:07] cannot there's others who can accept it
[59:09] and some get it without half trying now
[59:11] that's a whole other sermon
[59:14] some people can get divine healing or
[59:16] miracles and they hardly try at all
[59:18] that's true
[59:22] right
[59:23] let me say like this you didn't fast for
[59:25] it no
[59:27] you didn't pray for it really hard
[59:30] right hey but i prayed for austin to get
[59:33] that out of debt i didn't pray that hard
[59:35] it was one little prayer we might have
[59:36] did two little prayers brother you know
[59:38] you and i
[59:41] it's all right it's true
[59:43] some of them god
[59:45] just answers without much effort
[59:47] right on the human side
[59:50] now that we have to preach the gospel
[59:52] that healing is to all yet we know it's
[59:56] not
[59:57] so beloved tell us this
[59:58] right his approach was healing is for
[1:00:02] everybody but yet he knew it wasn't
[1:00:08] isn't that something
[1:00:11] it is to all if they can receive it but
[1:00:13] we know that they all could not receive
[1:00:15] it that's a very wise statement
[1:00:17] amen right we know just like just like
[1:00:19] salvation the bible said god wouldn't
[1:00:21] all men be saved god wants salvation to
[1:00:24] everybody
[1:00:25] but he knows that everybody will receive
[1:00:26] it right
[1:00:29] okay
[1:00:32] now the reason i would take a different
[1:00:33] approach is because i'm not preaching to
[1:00:35] sinners all the time i get the same
[1:00:37] wonderful people almost every week
[1:00:40] brother brad would go to special
[1:00:41] meetings there'd be sinners in there i
[1:00:43] mean they would have 10 20 people get
[1:00:45] saved all these services we'd i mean we
[1:00:47] hardly have it
[1:00:49] get people safe
[1:00:50] it's just different different ministries
[1:00:53] get a divine healing ministry i've got a
[1:00:54] pastor ministry so if i'm going to be
[1:00:57] preaching the same people every day or
[1:00:59] every service
[1:01:00] i can move beyond this is for everybody
[1:01:02] to
[1:01:04] god is trying to do his perfect will in
[1:01:06] your life and you need to see god's
[1:01:07] perfect will for your life
[1:01:10] i don't have to be general i can be very
[1:01:12] specific
[1:01:13] because you hear me week after week
[1:01:15] after month after year thank god you
[1:01:17] come back thank god
[1:01:19] hallelujah without you we would we would
[1:01:21] not have a church
[1:01:23] hallelujah remember brother said the
[1:01:25] laity are just as important as the
[1:01:26] preachers
[1:01:27] right
[1:01:28] it's satan who tries to conquer the
[1:01:30] laity
[1:01:31] nickoladens and take the holiness out of
[1:01:33] the people you're just as holy as me
[1:01:35] hallelujah because we're holding by the
[1:01:37] blood amen
[1:01:39] you have just as many gifts as i do
[1:01:41] because the the gifts are in the body of
[1:01:43] jesus christ so let's all be used by the
[1:01:45] glory of god amen
[1:01:47] let's come here anointed let's come here
[1:01:49] with confidence let's put our faith
[1:01:51] together let's believe god's word amen
[1:01:53] amen hallelujah
[1:01:55] your prayers are just as important but
[1:01:57] also when we prayed and elena's mom come
[1:01:59] back who prayed harder was it sister
[1:02:01] naomi or me who was it
[1:02:06] when lindy had that issue there
[1:02:08] uh and remember i had a mind battle who
[1:02:10] was it that brought you out i prayed
[1:02:11] hard i've heard but who got you
[1:02:13] deliverance sister now
[1:02:16] you understand
[1:02:17] that sister lina when your sister needed
[1:02:19] help it was your night prayer
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:23] who'd god use well it was her enough we
[1:02:25] put our faith together it's very similar
[1:02:27] there's different gifts and we all have
[1:02:29] to be
[1:02:30] somebody said this we all got to be
[1:02:31] available to be used by god amen we have
[1:02:34] to be surrendered and willing and if
[1:02:36] you're called upon to pray hallelujah
[1:02:39] are you if you're not pray amen amen
[1:02:41] hallelujah
[1:02:43] or like naomi did go up to the person if
[1:02:45] you've got a burden and they're on your
[1:02:46] heart even the service is closed you go
[1:02:48] talk to them sure
[1:02:50] if god is leading you to do that that's
[1:02:52] your gift operating sure
[1:02:55] hallelujah
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:59] but eventually i just want to be as
[1:03:00] honest as i can be i preach it like this
[1:03:02] for everybody but it's not we'll see
[1:03:03] then
[1:03:04] i feel like i can learn from that i can
[1:03:06] i can say it's not for everybody i can
[1:03:08] say
[1:03:09] find god's will for your life
[1:03:10] amen i can use
[1:03:12] jeremiah 29 and say seek god with all
[1:03:15] your heart soul mind and strength and
[1:03:16] then you'll find him.
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:22] does everyone understand amen
[1:03:25] we're thinking real deep tonight
[1:03:30] on those things
[1:03:32] there's two approaches so i don't take
[1:03:34] that first approach
[1:03:35] i don't say they're for everybody
[1:03:37] because i we know not everybody's gonna
[1:03:38] be healed not recently gonna be saved
[1:03:44] i i approach it
[1:03:46] god is going to ordain the perfect will
[1:03:48] of god for your life and let me say it
[1:03:49] like this you can have the permissible
[1:03:51] of god but you really don't want it
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:56] god could give you the permissive will
[1:03:57] but you really don't want that that's
[1:03:59] why i say
[1:04:00] ask for the perfect will of god
[1:04:02] make yourself neutral
[1:04:06] and let god ordain what happens in your
[1:04:08] life
[1:04:13] hallelujah amen
[1:04:16] that's why i take this out here's why i
[1:04:17] take the second the second approach the
[1:04:19] first approach and brother graham
[1:04:21] actually says is i heard it today works
[1:04:22] as faith express he said we see a lot of
[1:04:24] disappointments in divine healing
[1:04:27] he said people get emotional and they
[1:04:29] think that emotion is god telling them
[1:04:32] they're going to be healed and he said
[1:04:32] they get disappointed
[1:04:34] they go off and they're still sick
[1:04:53] but i just i feel like
[1:04:55] if i preach it like everybody's healing
[1:04:57] for everybody's salvation for everybody
[1:04:59] then there could become disappointments
[1:05:01] if the promises i promise them don't
[1:05:03] come to pass
[1:05:06] right
[1:05:09] what if i told all of you yes it's god's
[1:05:11] will to do this yes it's god well what
[1:05:13] if i don't know what if i'm wrong right
[1:05:16] then you get disappointed in me and i
[1:05:18] let you down
[1:05:19] and you think god lets you down but
[1:05:20] really god didn't let you down i just
[1:05:22] let you down
[1:05:23] are you with me true the rap says that
[1:05:26] there's disappointments in divine
[1:05:27] healing
[1:05:29] if we don't find god's will first right
[1:05:34] and then of course the second reason i
[1:05:35] go i don't know what this is for
[1:05:36] everybody is because what i see jesus
[1:05:38] say
[1:05:40] so you see so see first there's harder
[1:05:42] disappointments you could get mad at god
[1:05:44] someone could get mad at god since he
[1:05:45] didn't keep his promise but we know god
[1:05:47] does
[1:05:50] maybe it wasn't his ordained or perfect
[1:05:52] will and yet you'll see other people
[1:05:54] they got the promise but i didn't get it
[1:05:56] so i'm mad at god i've had people tell
[1:05:58] me that they're they hate god they're
[1:05:59] angry god sure they they didn't get
[1:06:00] married when they wanted to they want to
[1:06:02] get married at a younger age and so they
[1:06:04] said i hate god i'm mad at god because
[1:06:05] of that
[1:06:06] now where is in the bible does it say
[1:06:08] you got to be married by 20 or 18 or 22.
[1:06:10] you don't say that in the bible
[1:06:12] but that evil spirit has found that
[1:06:14] person for many years i've always known
[1:06:15] something wrong with that person
[1:06:17] they're a woman and they said i wish i
[1:06:18] was a preacher that was the first that
[1:06:20] was a big problem
[1:06:23] and i still never repented of that one
[1:06:25] even though i told them to told her to
[1:06:26] repent of that
[1:06:27] that's fine that's between them right
[1:06:29] it's between her and god right but see
[1:06:33] if we preach it like it's for everybody
[1:06:35] then people will be disappointed well
[1:06:36] your brother brother you said you told
[1:06:38] me the lord heard your prayer you said
[1:06:42] no i said find god's will first
[1:06:45] that's what i said that's what that's
[1:06:47] what we all want to say
[1:06:49] let's find god's will first because then
[1:06:51] when we got god's will we know what's
[1:06:52] going to happen praise god
[1:06:55] now i'd give you numbers like i believe
[1:06:57] god will heal you 99 of the time or
[1:07:00] ninety-eight percent of the time
[1:07:01] whatever to say in other words the
[1:07:02] majority of the time god's gonna heal
[1:07:04] you especially while you're young right
[1:07:08] but god doesn't heal every single time
[1:07:11] like in the case of elisha he died of a
[1:07:14] disease
[1:07:15] in case of paul's eyes he said three
[1:07:18] times
[1:07:19] deliver me and god didn't heal from that
[1:07:21] at that time
[1:07:22] we don't know when he did it when or if
[1:07:24] he did get healed of that we don't know
[1:07:29] now the other thing is if we say it's
[1:07:30] for everybody you could condemn yourself
[1:07:32] or a preacher or friend or live under
[1:07:35] guilt because you or others could not
[1:07:37] build up enough faith so you feel
[1:07:39] disappointed well i'm not a good
[1:07:40] christian well
[1:07:41] but brother adam says you can't receive
[1:07:42] anything unless god gives it to you
[1:07:45] it's a gift
[1:07:46] faith is a gift
[1:07:48] you're saved by grace through faith it
[1:07:50] is the gift of god not of works that's
[1:07:52] that ain't your most amen
[1:07:54] in other words god has a plan for your
[1:07:56] life and if he wants to do a miracle
[1:07:57] through healing he'll make sure you have
[1:07:59] that anointing at that time amen
[1:08:02] how do you praise god
[1:08:05] you want to do god's perfect will just
[1:08:07] remain humble just remain neutral obey
[1:08:09] his voice all the time then god will
[1:08:11] anoint you at the right time in the
[1:08:12] right season
[1:08:17] so see i feel like it's best to
[1:08:18] emphasize each individual seek god's
[1:08:21] will for themselves
[1:08:22] sure that's why i don't say it's for
[1:08:24] everybody
[1:08:27] that's why when you hear me pray now or
[1:08:28] i've been praying for years out if it's
[1:08:30] your will god may be according to your
[1:08:31] will
[1:08:34] right because it's got to be god's will
[1:08:37] three times jesus said i can do nothing
[1:08:40] very very i say to you the son could do
[1:08:42] nothing of himself but what he sees the
[1:08:43] father do he had to see a vision first
[1:08:46] john 5 30 i can of my own self do what
[1:08:49] not nothing then jesus says without me
[1:08:51] you can do
[1:08:52] nothing
[1:08:54] hallelujah
[1:08:56] jesus could do nothing without the
[1:08:57] father and we can do nothing without him
[1:08:59] praise god
[1:09:02] jesus says i do nothing of myself
[1:09:08] so if he couldn't do anything of himself
[1:09:10] we can't do anything of ourselves
[1:09:12] we gotta wait for his power right we
[1:09:14] gotta wait for his anointing and the
[1:09:15] church said
[1:09:16] what was it that happened on that night
[1:09:18] we prayed for your mom or pray for your
[1:09:19] sister that was god's anointing come
[1:09:21] down
[1:09:23] that wasn't us it wasn't our power
[1:09:25] we just got the channel god wanted to
[1:09:27] move through us so god moved
[1:09:31] all glory to god
[1:09:32] and then god will not share that glory
[1:09:34] with me or austin or hua or lena or
[1:09:37] naomi god will not share his glory with
[1:09:39] anybody amen hallelujah so we just
[1:09:42] rejoiced i was there when god did it
[1:09:45] it wasn't me but god is flowing through
[1:09:47] me praise god it wasn't us it was god's
[1:09:49] wrong flowing throat we were blessed
[1:09:51] just to be there when god moved amen
[1:09:56] we were blessed just to see god answer
[1:09:58] our prayer
[1:10:00] no great ones among us oh you're the
[1:10:01] you're the greatest
[1:10:03] you're the greatest wife there ever was
[1:10:05] oh you're the greatest song special
[1:10:06] person there ever was
[1:10:08] you're the greatest brother in christ
[1:10:09] there ever was nonsense
[1:10:11] nonsense oh you're the greatest
[1:10:13] preachers of all time nonsense
[1:10:15] hallelujah
[1:10:17] it is all god's grace it is all god's
[1:10:19] mercy we're just there when it happens
[1:10:21] amen amen
[1:10:23] he said we're just like microphones
[1:10:27] the voice ain't even us it's just
[1:10:29] passing through us amen
[1:10:31] we're just the glove
[1:10:33] we're not blood has no power so we have
[1:10:35] no power it's just god picking us up and
[1:10:38] using us praise god
[1:10:40] he's got to be surrendered to his time
[1:10:42] in season
[1:10:46] hallelujah like i told you that preacher
[1:10:48] who went to the church and said god's
[1:10:50] going to heal the pastor's wife she died
[1:10:54] right so that was not god
[1:10:56] that's an example where you say
[1:10:58] something without having a revelation
[1:11:02] in other words that man as gifted as he
[1:11:03] was has tremendous gifts he's probably
[1:11:05] born again he's probably got a big
[1:11:06] complex of pride
[1:11:09] so many powerful testimonies but that
[1:11:11] man failed to seek god's will first and
[1:11:13] what happened it caused a great big
[1:11:15] letdown
[1:11:18] and i found out even that the mother who
[1:11:20] died her son had had a
[1:11:23] a kind of
[1:11:24] strange thing happened he was preaching
[1:11:26] and then while he was preaching his ipad
[1:11:28] just started preaching brother branham
[1:11:29] and i just went right along with the
[1:11:30] sermon he thought that would be a
[1:11:32] miracle or a sign that his mom would be
[1:11:34] healed and then when his mom died he was
[1:11:36] all disappointed
[1:11:37] so see how church we're all just kind of
[1:11:39] struggling to know the will of god
[1:11:43] thank god they didn't say thus faith the
[1:11:44] lord thank god
[1:11:46] then they'd truly be a false prophet or
[1:11:47] false prophet preachers
[1:11:49] see we are just
[1:11:51] we're we're looking through a glass dark
[1:11:52] remember when i told you that
[1:11:54] all these prophecies and tongues and
[1:11:56] visions they'll all fail but one thing
[1:11:58] will remain that's god's love amen
[1:12:01] hallelujah
[1:12:05] i'm playing americans i love them you
[1:12:06] love them too we're glad when god does
[1:12:08] them
[1:12:09] i'm glad i'm there and god doesn't
[1:12:11] but i can do nothing of myself
[1:12:14] neither can you
[1:12:16] then we must not take god's glory amen
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:21] if jesus could do nothing without god
[1:12:23] first showing him how much more do we
[1:12:24] need god to do something first right
[1:12:27] we see the same truth in jacob and
[1:12:29] rachel's marriage jacob could not do
[1:12:31] nothing without god remember rachel's
[1:12:32] like begging him give me a child or i'll
[1:12:34] die and he said am i in god's stead
[1:12:37] same thing like i'm not god i can't i
[1:12:40] can't do it i gotta pray to god
[1:12:43] right
[1:12:45] that's why we don't promise it for
[1:12:47] everybody we can't promise it to
[1:12:48] everybody because it's up to god it's
[1:12:50] not up to man it's up to god
[1:12:53] now god told rachel he could not give
[1:12:55] her a child god eventually though opened
[1:12:57] rachel's womb see god remembered her see
[1:12:59] church god will remember you amen she
[1:13:02] went she went to man can man help me
[1:13:03] know but no doubt she must have prayed
[1:13:05] prayed prayed god said then i remember i
[1:13:07] hear your prayer i'll pour out your
[1:13:09] answer i'm faithful i care for my
[1:13:11] daughter i'll speak to her i'll give her
[1:13:13] my word i'll answer her prayers
[1:13:16] hey
[1:13:19] see she went to the wrong person she
[1:13:21] shouldn't have went to her husband she
[1:13:22] went to god
[1:13:24] because god's the only one who's got
[1:13:25] revelation
[1:13:27] now god might speak a word through your
[1:13:28] husband or something or wife or
[1:13:30] something like that
[1:13:32] all right stephanie's also great god god
[1:13:34] bless stephanie hope you're enjoying the
[1:13:36] word of god tonight hopefully the
[1:13:37] internet didn't
[1:13:38] kick out
[1:13:39] like we got that often problem
[1:13:42] isaac actually had to intercede for his
[1:13:44] wife to have children
[1:13:47] in other words this one wasn't going to
[1:13:49] happen unless the father had a real
[1:13:51] burden to pray
[1:13:53] and the church said
[1:13:55] see because god has a different plan for
[1:13:56] everybody
[1:13:58] different tests different trials all for
[1:14:00] one thing god's glory amen
[1:14:03] be thou glorified that's right
[1:14:08] now it seems some struggle more than
[1:14:10] others with promises i'm just going to
[1:14:11] lay this in just real briefly here
[1:14:14] some people they pray boom
[1:14:16] answers right away that don't mean
[1:14:18] they're more spiritual it just means
[1:14:19] that's how god wanted to answer
[1:14:22] yes right that's true
[1:14:24] but there's others who can accept it
[1:14:26] others can't and some just get it
[1:14:28] without half trying
[1:14:31] that's true that's so true
[1:14:35] you'll struggle struggle god do this god
[1:14:38] and then you'll see somebody else get
[1:14:39] the
[1:14:40] answer well what's wrong with me well
[1:14:43] that's what the devil wants you to think
[1:14:44] there's nothing wrong with you god has a
[1:14:45] different plan for you
[1:14:48] praise god
[1:14:52] remember
[1:14:52] we don't see a lot of struggle in this
[1:14:54] passage this one i mentioned earlier i'm
[1:14:56] sorry
[1:14:57] this is the great multitudes
[1:14:59] no i'm sorry this is the one i said
[1:15:00] earlier we don't see a lot of struggle
[1:15:02] but perhaps there were years worth of
[1:15:03] struggle the father must have shown
[1:15:05] jesus the healing beforehand but god
[1:15:07] didn't show jesus all the healings
[1:15:08] beforehand
[1:15:10] okay so here's what we don't see a lot
[1:15:12] of struggle he just comes up he says if
[1:15:14] you will will you heal me he says i will
[1:15:15] you're healed i mean it's just like that
[1:15:16] fast
[1:15:18] just one little conversation jesus will
[1:15:19] hear me yes all right glory my leprosy
[1:15:22] is
[1:15:22] gone pretty fast and easy it seems like
[1:15:26] now church if we're all honest don't we
[1:15:28] want that to be our situation
[1:15:31] lord i've got a toothache or lord
[1:15:33] i may be more serious lord i've got
[1:15:35] cancer god
[1:15:36] take it away without any chemo now i've
[1:15:38] got that for my mom
[1:15:40] but god don't do that for everybody
[1:15:43] we all
[1:15:44] we all want it fast and easy
[1:15:49] now in this poor support portion we
[1:15:51] don't see a lot of struggle in this
[1:15:52] passage but perhaps this man was 30 this
[1:15:54] man was already battling for 38 years
[1:15:57] this is the man
[1:15:58] there's a whole multitude of sick and
[1:16:00] jesus only healed one of them
[1:16:03] okay so we don't see a lot of struggle
[1:16:05] in this situation but no doubt he
[1:16:06] probably struggled for 38 years
[1:16:09] in the sermon on desperation brother
[1:16:11] seems to say god allows struggle or
[1:16:13] desperation god wants you to struggle
[1:16:15] sometimes
[1:16:17] the church said amen i say god wants you
[1:16:19] to struggle sometimes amen
[1:16:21] so you'll be desperate for fellowship
[1:16:23] with him amen amen hallelujah
[1:16:27] that's true he wants you to struggle to
[1:16:29] receive a promise to bring out your true
[1:16:31] colors
[1:16:33] your true character amen amen god is
[1:16:37] trying to bring out a real believer he's
[1:16:39] trying to show your real truth quality
[1:16:41] character even if you have trials you'll
[1:16:43] keep persevering even if things don't go
[1:16:45] easy you'll keep believing even if
[1:16:47] everything seems to fall apart you'll
[1:16:49] keep trusting god amen and the only way
[1:16:52] that could happen is by letting you
[1:16:53] struggle
[1:16:56] other people are going to quit fall away
[1:16:59] but not you amen
[1:17:03] others will give up talk bad about the
[1:17:05] preacher talk bad about the song leader
[1:17:06] talk bad about all the sisters they'll
[1:17:08] give up and they'll curse and they'll
[1:17:10] walk away but you won't because you're a
[1:17:12] real believer amen
[1:17:14] you'll go through struggles you'll go
[1:17:16] through trials if somebody offended you
[1:17:17] you'll go talk to them amen
[1:17:21] but see struggles bring out your real
[1:17:23] character
[1:17:28] here's where brother brown says it in
[1:17:30] doing that in desperation it brings out
[1:17:32] the real thing that you are
[1:17:34] it shows what you're made out of in the
[1:17:36] time of desperation usually pulls all
[1:17:37] the good things
[1:17:38] that's in you
[1:17:41] sounds like a fiery trial of faith and
[1:17:43] you'll come forth as gold amen
[1:17:46] you are the goal but you've got some
[1:17:48] drugs but you got to go through the fire
[1:17:50] to show what you're really made out of
[1:17:52] and remove all the unbelief remove any
[1:17:55] sinful desires
[1:17:58] the only way to do that is to struggle
[1:18:01] to be desperate while other people can
[1:18:03] just walk right up sometimes well you've
[1:18:05] had it too just walk up prayer answer
[1:18:07] right away i remember that sign that
[1:18:08] amen was sick and you're laying by him
[1:18:10] and you just reach your hand over you
[1:18:11] felt the power of god on your arms you
[1:18:13] remember that a couple years ago and
[1:18:14] amen was instantly healed then you went
[1:18:16] back to bed well that's nice right you
[1:18:17] have to stay up and pray all night
[1:18:19] you see church
[1:18:20] that's that's one of those times where
[1:18:22] it's just easy
[1:18:23] thank god for those but not everyone's
[1:18:26] like that
[1:18:30] it's all on god's plan it's all in god's
[1:18:32] depending on god's will
[1:18:33] this must mean that god has different
[1:18:35] testimonies for purposes to use on the
[1:18:37] day of judgment
[1:18:39] our lives are his work that we must walk
[1:18:42] in and accept
[1:18:44] god has a work for brother austin to do
[1:18:46] god has a work for sister naomi to do
[1:18:49] god has a word sisterhood for you you've
[1:18:51] got to do it it's already laid out and
[1:18:53] you just have to
[1:18:55] you're created for that work and you
[1:18:57] just have to walk in those works
[1:19:01] in the perfect will of god by waiting on
[1:19:03] god for the revelation of god amen
[1:19:06] gloria that's right
[1:19:08] put that nail down in there
[1:19:11] pinch it
[1:19:13] so now look at this brother brandon's
[1:19:14] advice to a man being divorced i just
[1:19:16] want you to see this
[1:19:18] because i can't think of anything harder
[1:19:20] than to be divorced by somebody
[1:19:23] and left behind can you imagine now i
[1:19:25] was left behind by my dad so i kind of i
[1:19:27] can't imagine that actually
[1:19:28] but not my spouse thank god for my wife
[1:19:31] and i thank god for our love
[1:19:33] the holy spirit praise amen but look
[1:19:35] what brother man tells a man his wife
[1:19:37] has walked away from her and they have
[1:19:38] two kids together
[1:19:40] look what he tells him to do he said
[1:19:42] just be as happy as you can be
[1:19:46] now you think that would rip your heart
[1:19:48] out right it would feel like it's
[1:19:50] ripping out your heart and your soul but
[1:19:52] brother adam says
[1:19:53] satan is only trying to destroy your
[1:19:56] physical health
[1:19:57] by making you worry and making you mourn
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:03] now here's the question
[1:20:04] uh she's my wife's sued me for divorce
[1:20:06] we're separated what must i do we have
[1:20:08] two boys
[1:20:09] he says brother let me tell you she's
[1:20:11] going to sue you for divorce that's
[1:20:12] satan you shouldn't do that but you're a
[1:20:14] christian and done enough in the world
[1:20:15] to hinder that woman and satan doing
[1:20:16] that he's only trying to tear you up
[1:20:19] yeah
[1:20:20] now look without thus saying the lord
[1:20:22] look what brother graham tells this
[1:20:23] person brother doesn't have thus saith
[1:20:24] the lord look what he says
[1:20:26] he basically says be neutral and pray
[1:20:29] committed to god and wait for god to
[1:20:31] work it out that's true
[1:20:33] church the prophet don't have all the
[1:20:34] answers
[1:20:36] sometimes god don't give him a vision
[1:20:38] right
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:40] hello
[1:20:41] he's not god
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] but man says god only tells prophets
[1:20:45] what he wants them to know amen amen so
[1:20:47] he didn't tell brother in this case
[1:20:49] brother just said she just now if she's
[1:20:51] one of god's elect she'll come to him if
[1:20:53] if she's not she's not worth worrying
[1:20:55] about that's a statement
[1:20:57] i married the woman we've had two kids
[1:21:00] but if she's not elect
[1:21:02] she's not even worth worrying about
[1:21:03] that's quite a statement
[1:21:05] that's that's speaking of like divine
[1:21:07] pres that's not human perspective that's
[1:21:08] like divine perspective
[1:21:11] that's that's a statement right there
[1:21:13] true
[1:21:15] if you worry listen it'll break down you
[1:21:17] it'll break your health down and that's
[1:21:19] what satan wants to do he's working i
[1:21:20] know it you so you just commit the whole
[1:21:22] thing to god and go right on serving god
[1:21:24] just as happy you're in the midst of a
[1:21:26] divorce
[1:21:28] and just be as happy
[1:21:30] as you can be
[1:21:33] god will take care of the rest of it all
[1:21:35] that the father is going to come to me
[1:21:37] look he says now get down on your knees
[1:21:38] i'll pray with you or anything i'll pray
[1:21:40] over the matter just say lord i love her
[1:21:41] she's the mother of my children i'll
[1:21:43] just commit the whole thing to you lord
[1:21:44] i want them saved you know i do but i
[1:21:46] can't go no further she's going to
[1:21:47] divorce me anyhow i haven't done nothing
[1:21:49] if i have revealed reveal reveal reveal
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] reveal your will amen amen
[1:21:57] reveal if i did something wrong reveal
[1:21:59] your ways
[1:22:00] your will for this situation
[1:22:03] and i'll go make it right
[1:22:08] i will do anything then commit to the
[1:22:10] lord and just let it alone just let
[1:22:12] alone go right on living just the same
[1:22:14] as nothing ever happened and god will
[1:22:16] take care of the rest of it end quote
[1:22:19] that's the end of it
[1:22:21] so see when you don't have thus say the
[1:22:23] lord what do you do
[1:22:25] you do the best you can you invest all
[1:22:27] your sins and you pray and ask god i'm
[1:22:29] asking you and i'm waiting on you
[1:22:35] and then try to be as happy as you can
[1:22:39] because satan wants to make you
[1:22:40] sorrowful when you get sorrowful and
[1:22:41] depressed what happens your health goes
[1:22:43] down you start getting diseases
[1:22:45] he's trying to destroy your body he's
[1:22:47] trying to kill steal and destroy yeah
[1:22:51] but jesus come that we might have life
[1:22:53] and have it more abundantly
[1:22:58] now i'm just have to close here i'm good
[1:23:01] okay i'm left
[1:23:04] so two conclusions let's stand our feet
[1:23:05] my musicians can come
[1:23:08] so basically i took two conclusions
[1:23:10] church
[1:23:11] how you can find the will of god for any
[1:23:13] promise of god
[1:23:28] spend that song i want what you want for
[1:23:30] me to do
[1:23:31] whatever or whatever it may be
[1:23:33] two conclusions first if you already
[1:23:34] have the revelation church this is a
[1:23:36] pretty this is the one that's a little
[1:23:37] more easy to understand
[1:23:39] first confess your sins every day right
[1:23:41] be happy or positive whether god
[1:23:43] requires desperation enough
[1:23:46] god may require you to be desperate god
[1:23:48] was requiring
[1:23:49] uh remember in jeremiah 29 god was
[1:23:51] requiring israel to be desperate they
[1:23:53] had to seek god with all their hearts
[1:23:54] soul mind and strength to go back to the
[1:23:56] land
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:02] some of them you might not have to be
[1:24:03] desperate
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:05] but sometimes god is calling you to
[1:24:06] desperation
[1:24:08] so it can show what you're really made
[1:24:10] of i'm a real believer
[1:24:12] i've struggled for months i've struggled
[1:24:13] for years but i'm still believing
[1:24:15] because i'm a real christian praise god
[1:24:18] hallelujah i'm not a quitter
[1:24:21] i'm not a doubter i'm not mr skeptic
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:24] i'm mr believer i'm misbeliever
[1:24:27] hallelujah
[1:24:33] and then if you know it act like you
[1:24:34] already got it
[1:24:37] like i'm sure austin was happy kathy's
[1:24:38] going to be healed he's going to be
[1:24:40] healed i'm sure he was happy
[1:24:43] glory
[1:24:45] that's if you know the revelation
[1:24:47] if you don't brother says get in the
[1:24:49] holy spirit first
[1:24:52] which means what confess all your sins
[1:24:54] then just like the other one be happy
[1:24:56] and positive waiting or hoping
[1:25:01] whether god requires
[1:25:03] desperation or not
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:24] and then three worship and trust god
[1:25:27] his will or his plan
[1:25:30] even if we're not sure if god's gonna do
[1:25:32] it we're not sure we still need to
[1:25:33] worship god and give him praise
[1:25:35] because if he doesn't do it then his way
[1:25:37] is better than our way
[1:25:40] and we should want what god wants
[1:25:43] and not what we want
[1:25:45] let me close with this how many have the
[1:25:47] baptism holy ghost
[1:25:50] if you have holy ghost you have charity
[1:25:52] the bible says charity suffers long
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:58] i'm gonna say that again if you've got
[1:25:59] the baptism of the holy ghost you can
[1:26:01] suffer long
[1:26:03] because it's not you doing it it's god
[1:26:05] doing it
[1:26:11] charity verse 7
[1:26:13] bears all things it can bear that burden
[1:26:16] of waiting
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:18] i love this next one
[1:26:20] believeth all things that means believes
[1:26:22] all revelations and then what's the next
[1:26:24] one
[1:26:25] hopeth glory
[1:26:27] popeth all things
[1:26:31] church god doesn't give us revelation
[1:26:33] every single day like i know what's
[1:26:34] gonna happen today i know what's gonna
[1:26:35] happen tomorrow i know it's gonna happen
[1:26:36] friday i know god don't do it like that
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:42] when we don't know the will of god the
[1:26:44] bible says the love of god in our hearts
[1:26:46] it hopes all things i hope god does this
[1:26:50] i'm going to keep worshiping i'm going
[1:26:52] to be neutral i'm going to give him
[1:26:53] praise i've made my request to run to
[1:26:55] god i'm hoping he hears me and i'll
[1:26:58] still love him even if he doesn't answer
[1:26:59] my prayer praise god
[1:27:02] hallelujah as i was driving to church
[1:27:05] that scripture i felt like it dropped
[1:27:06] down
[1:27:08] charity hopes all things
[1:27:12] so if you don't know god's will get the
[1:27:13] holy spirit then you'll be hoping for it
[1:27:15] praise god
[1:27:17] and act like
[1:27:18] you're hoping for it
[1:27:22] i hope that was understood i hope the
[1:27:23] holy spirit gave you an understanding of
[1:27:24] that i might have chopped it up
[1:27:26] let's bow our heads here
[1:27:30] how you can know the will of god for any
[1:27:32] promise that's how you know seek god
[1:27:36] get in the holy spirit first
[1:27:39] and then start acting
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:45] church for a lot of us let me just be
[1:27:46] honest it's going to be waiting
[1:27:48] everybody repeat after me and say lord
[1:27:50] i'm willing to wait can we say that lord
[1:27:54] and let's say lord i'm hoping all things
[1:27:56] let's say that ready lord i'm hoping all
[1:27:59] we've got to be willing to wait and
[1:28:00] we've got to hope
[1:28:02] hope is an attribute of divine love amen
[1:28:05] hope hoping a long time is an attribute
[1:28:08] of the holy ghost
[1:28:09] hoping that god does it
[1:28:11] if you don't know the will of god yet
[1:28:17] so i oh brother amen was able to listen
[1:28:19] to this i'm going to text him after
[1:28:19] service sister
[1:28:21] i felt like i want to explain this a
[1:28:22] little better you know i felt like i
[1:28:24] knew a good job for our brother
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] let's pray together how many would say
[1:28:36] brother jesse pray for me that i'll be
[1:28:37] able to hope a long time i'll be able to
[1:28:39] be patient to these promises coming to
[1:28:40] pass almost every hands up my hands up
[1:28:42] as well a church you pray for one
[1:28:44] another
