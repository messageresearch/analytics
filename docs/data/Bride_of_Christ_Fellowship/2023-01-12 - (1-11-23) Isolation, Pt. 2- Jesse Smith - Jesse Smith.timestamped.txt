[0:07] let's go to Proverbs chapter 18 verse 1.
[0:10] I Was preparing today I thought I was

[0:32] inspiration by God's grace

[3:13] name the Saints said amen God bless you
[3:16] as you're being seated praise God
[3:24] so we're thankful again for God's grace
[3:26] it's good to be here in the house of the
[3:28] Lord we have uh some slides here I have
[3:29] some quotes like to
[3:31] scriptures like to share
[3:33] just want to look at isolation
[3:35] part two
[3:39] and uh we read our text here tonight I'm
[3:41] not going to read on Luke 5 but we read
[3:43] how the scripture says through desire
[3:47] a man having separated himself so this
[3:50] is the case of of a man or woman of
[3:52] course yielding to the to the either the
[3:55] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh or
[3:56] pride of life and
[3:58] and they start feeling like like they
[4:00] can figure out life they feel like they
[4:03] don't need uh God's leading in this
[4:05] certain area or this certain time of
[4:07] their life and may God help us to not
[4:09] have as many of those times praise God
[4:11] we want to we want to actually live in
[4:13] God's wisdom praise God we want to have
[4:15] the fear of the Lord that's the
[4:17] beginning of wisdom praise God but we
[4:19] need a constant for us we saw we need a
[4:21] constant flow of the fear of the Lord
[4:22] because we just don't want the beginning
[4:24] of wisdom we like the end of wisdom
[4:26] right we like the middle of wisdom we
[4:28] like the end of wisdom what the Bible
[4:30] calls the end of your faith even the
[4:31] salvation of your souls
[4:33] so I'd like to stay in the channel of
[4:35] that uh the fear of the Lord and the
[4:36] knowledge of God
[4:38] and I'll just briefly review you know
[4:40] I'm not going to review much on that
[4:41] that first part
[4:44] listen to that today you know on double
[4:45] speed and I thought my what a uh what a
[4:48] time of the Holy Spirit speaking to us
[4:49] you know it was I was really quite moved
[4:53] by the Holy Spirit again just to see how
[4:54] God was speaking and uh of course we
[4:57] know there's numerous prayer testimonies
[4:59] afterwards and everything like that so
[5:01] it was really wonderful to see that
[5:03] but I just want to review that briefly
[5:05] you know as we go through great
[5:06] victories you know as we go through all
[5:07] the great emotions
[5:09] uh being born again and having Victory
[5:12] and as we go through all the Motions of
[5:14] having Joy I've been preaching a lot on
[5:15] emotion and having joy and
[5:17] praising God
[5:19] we got to remember there's going to be
[5:20] times when we don't feel it
[5:22] there's going to be times I think I
[5:23] maybe woke up was it Monday or Tuesday I
[5:25] didn't feel a whole lot of anything
[5:26] other than just tired
[5:28] cranky
[5:30] uh and I was like where's all my joy
[5:33] where's all my joy from Sunday
[5:36] um
[5:37] but that's just human nature that's the
[5:39] cycle by the way I'm talked about uh the
[5:41] Bible talks about there's a time and
[5:42] season for everything you know and so
[5:46] you know we this week you know even
[5:48] today we find ourselves in one of these
[5:50] isolated places we're either isolated
[5:52] into a sinful complex or a sinful uh
[5:56] Choice by our own choosing
[5:59] or God is maybe kind of withdrawn his
[6:01] Spirit a little bit from us and he's
[6:03] testing us
[6:05] may not feel as uh joyful or we may not
[6:09] feel as strong as we did maybe even a
[6:12] few days ago
[6:13] but God is giving us an insight into
[6:16] what's in our heart
[6:18] God's letting us see okay this is what's
[6:20] still in my mind
[6:22] I still got this idea I've still got
[6:25] that passion I've still got that desire
[6:29] and so that's isolated from God's maybe
[6:32] influence but it's it's God testing us
[6:36] it's God refining us
[6:38] right so we'll look a little bit more at
[6:39] that I want to go a little deeper there
[6:40] with job a little bit and also with
[6:42] Hezekiah just a little bit into those
[6:43] not a whole lot but a little bit into
[6:45] those
[6:46] but the best place to be as isolated
[6:48] with God Amen Hallelujah
[6:51] and you know the we're comforted isn't
[6:53] it such a comfort to know that no matter
[6:55] where we are God will never forsake us
[6:57] he'll never say I'm done with the bride
[6:59] of Christ Fellowship I'm done with him I
[7:01] don't care about them anymore God's
[7:02] never going to cast us away like that
[7:05] and so that that's a great consolation
[7:06] God gave us we'd say a thus saith the
[7:09] scripture thus saith the Bible he will
[7:11] never leave us nor forsake us as I want
[7:14] to revisit a few scriptures on that
[7:16] again tonight as well so
[7:18] you know we looked at we looked at
[7:20] Believers or you know people yeah we
[7:21] looked at Believers in every one of
[7:23] these cases
[7:24] right we looked at you know how Samson
[7:27] with his awful sins that he did
[7:30] yet even isolated by his own sin God
[7:33] could still wake him up praise God
[7:35] never said I'm done with this guy he's
[7:38] brought so much reproach on my gospel
[7:40] well of course the Old Testament law
[7:42] there's still Grace right there's still
[7:44] Grace in the Old Testament
[7:45] even though he was isolated in that
[7:47] dungeon or Evermore eyes plucked out God
[7:50] never forsake Him and God made sure the
[7:54] word of God on his life was fulfilled ah
[7:56] amen thank God and church we've got
[7:58] Philippians one if you ever doubt what
[8:00] God's going to finish you can go back to
[8:02] Philippians 1 say God is going to finish
[8:04] that which he started in my life praise
[8:06] God
[8:06] that verse has just been such a blessing
[8:09] over the years you know you hear
[8:10] different preachers preaching and
[8:11] different people confess it it is so
[8:13] beautiful it's so true God is going to
[8:15] finish what he started now that just
[8:17] come to me now like you know some of
[8:19] those Saints in uh Philippi uh well I'm
[8:22] sorry I was thinking I was getting
[8:23] Colossians and Philippians mixed up
[8:25] sorry so forget that thought
[8:28] um
[8:29] but you know we saw the prodigal son his
[8:31] own choosing he chose to leave the
[8:33] father's house
[8:34] and yet even eating Pig's food even in
[8:37] the uh we'd say the the most dirty
[8:39] condition you could be in he came to
[8:41] himself think about that God let him get
[8:43] back to his sound mind
[8:46] when he ran from a sound mind when he
[8:48] ran from common sense when he ran from
[8:50] Holiness he ran from uh sanctification
[8:52] he ran from everything yet God still
[8:55] allowed his mind to come back to him
[8:56] praise God oh thank God Amen how they do
[8:59] sometimes we get the wrong mind we're
[9:00] fixing to do something who steps in God
[9:03] steps in praise God Amen like I said God
[9:06] keeps us from ourselves amen
[9:09] he keeps us from the things we would do
[9:11] or the things we might do or the things
[9:12] we're planning hallelujah thank God he
[9:15] interrupts our life Hallelujah
[9:17] keeps us from doing things that we would
[9:19] do otherwise keeps us from shame praise
[9:22] God
[9:24] and as we'll see we'll get to you know
[9:26] we'll get to uh job we'll get to
[9:28] Hezekiah with the testing
[9:30] um
[9:32] you know with Hezekiah I was looking at
[9:33] that he was 38 or 39 when Isaiah said
[9:37] thus saith the Lord set your house in
[9:38] order is going to die
[9:40] because he started writing he started
[9:41] ruling out 25.
[9:43] he was only 14 or 15 years into being
[9:45] King
[9:46] and God said it's the perfect time that
[9:49] you go right now he's like I don't want
[9:50] to die before 40. now who we'd all say
[9:52] that wouldn't we we I don't want to die
[9:55] before I'm 40. I'm already 42 but I
[9:57] don't want to die before I'm 50. I don't
[9:58] want to die before I'm 60. I would like
[9:59] to live to 100.
[10:02] but that's just have a context of what
[10:05] it's there like God God said it would be
[10:07] best to leave at 38 or 39.
[10:10] but because of his Integrity he cries
[10:12] out to God
[10:14] and God gives him a dozen thus say the
[10:17] Lord Isaiah go back in there and tell
[10:18] them I'll give him 15 more years
[10:20] but the Bible said God uh said God was
[10:23] upset with uh Hezekiah because he did
[10:26] not bestow the same Honor on God that
[10:28] he'd given before
[10:30] God honored him but then he didn't
[10:33] return the honor back to God
[10:36] now look at that that shows you know in
[10:38] these situations God will honor you but
[10:40] God wants you to honor him in return
[10:43] right Hezekiah had honored him for all
[10:46] those years but then God said okay I'm
[10:49] going to honor your faith I'm going to
[10:50] give you some more time but then God
[10:51] expects you to honor him with all your
[10:53] time ah amen amen hallelujah
[10:57] and that was a time though when God said
[10:58] I'm okay I'm going to take away some of
[11:00] these feelings I'm going to take away my
[11:01] constant present from his presence from
[11:03] Isaiah Hezekiah and let's see he's going
[11:06] to find out what's in his heart
[11:08] and what was in his heart compromise was
[11:10] in his heart now look at that he
[11:13] compromised with those Babylonian
[11:14] princes
[11:16] had it been Pride right had it been
[11:18] Pride because he didn't honor God he
[11:19] honored himself he was trying to honor
[11:21] Israel right look at all the look at all
[11:22] the gold cups look at all this look at
[11:24] all the priests uh instruments look at
[11:26] all this gold look at all this silver he
[11:28] was caught up in Pride so God said look
[11:31] you still have some pride in your life
[11:33] he's 39 he's 40. he's 50. whenever those
[11:35] princes came we don't know when he came
[11:36] but we didn't they know we know he came
[11:39] within 15 years of being 40.
[11:43] see no matter how good we've done for
[11:45] God now look he said I've served you
[11:46] with a pure heart look at this church no
[11:48] matter how good we serve God up to now
[11:51] we've got to understand God can still
[11:53] test us right and we can still dishonor
[11:55] some some some area of our life but
[11:57] let's be disciplined no matter what
[11:59] season we're in we're going to stay with
[12:01] the word of God hallelujah
[12:03] right because he was isolated God
[12:05] isolated Hezekiah to see now I'm going
[12:07] to show you what's in your heart
[12:11] and it's a test it was a test
[12:13] God wanted him to pass the test but did
[12:15] he pass it no he failed that one
[12:17] now of course he repented later and he
[12:19] had a good you know a good death and
[12:20] good victories good testimonies but in
[12:22] that particular test
[12:24] he you know when God isolated himself
[12:27] he failed that particular test because
[12:29] of pride
[12:31] and so may God help us like I pray you
[12:33] know I prayed I preached it before God
[12:35] help me not to sin before the people
[12:37] Help me to live so pure before the
[12:38] people if I sin let's just be between
[12:40] you and I Lord God you know I don't that
[12:43] because I never want to put a stumbling
[12:45] block in somebody's way
[12:47] I want to put Stepping Stones amen
[12:49] hallelujah I'm gonna put stumbling
[12:52] Stones I'm gonna put Stepping Stones so
[12:53] you can walk higher amen
[12:55] you see my life you see my testimony and
[12:57] I know you wouldn't do the same thing
[12:58] too amen you want to put stepping stones
[13:01] in my for me oh look at brother awesome
[13:03] praise God I'm gonna go higher in faith
[13:05] Hallelujah look at brother amen and look
[13:07] at our brothers sisters my look at our
[13:09] young people that makes you want to go a
[13:11] little higher in Christ myself amen
[13:15] and then of course isolation with God is
[13:17] the best thing to do you're shutting
[13:18] with God ah those precious moments shut
[13:22] in with God in the secret place amen
[13:24] they are in the spirit be holding his
[13:26] face amen gaining new power to run in
[13:28] his race amen
[13:30] how I long to be struggled with God
[13:32] see now you might long for it but listen
[13:34] Church you might be in one of these
[13:36] as we'll get to you might be here in the
[13:38] sinful isolation and you don't know how
[13:40] to get yourself out
[13:41] and you might be longing for some
[13:43] fellowship but thank God there's a way
[13:46] out praise God
[13:48] Hallelujah
[13:49] same way you got in by your own will
[13:51] praise God your own will was going to
[13:52] get you out we'll get to that here by
[13:55] God's grace
[13:56] and so uh let's remember here we have
[13:59] these different types of isolation
[14:01] isolation is not always a bad thing
[14:03] it's not always a bad thing
[14:06] like we saw you know it's not always a
[14:08] bad thing you know God will isolate you
[14:10] for a time and season to have fellowship
[14:12] with him right
[14:13] that can be a good thing uh when you're
[14:16] isolated away from Sinners thank God
[14:17] when you're isolated away from
[14:19] Temptations Hallelujah that's a good
[14:21] thing Hallelujah
[14:23] and so we gotta look at it like that too
[14:26] you know there's there's benefits to
[14:28] being isolated like brothers said in
[14:29] 1960 remember he said he said the holy
[14:31] spirit said to walk with me you'll walk
[14:33] alone but he said I've catered too much
[14:34] to denominations
[14:37] so brother Brown was catering he was
[14:38] making little uh compromises here and
[14:41] there right which he admits he says many
[14:44] times I fail many times I do these
[14:45] things
[14:46] I caused an impersonation on the third
[14:48] pole remember that he said I've caused
[14:50] many impersonations because that and the
[14:52] angel rebuked him for it
[14:54] he was a man just like we're human we
[14:55] make mistakes
[14:57] right
[14:58] but we were thankful God will never
[15:00] leave us or forsake us hallelujah God's
[15:02] not in the forsaking business oh amen
[15:04] he's in the faithfulness business
[15:06] Hallelujah he's in the saving business
[15:09] Hallelujah amen thank God
[15:12] so we're grateful you know that uh no
[15:14] matter where we find ourselves we know
[15:16] God will never leave us nor forsake us
[15:19] Hallelujah now here's the thought here's
[15:21] the main thought as I was meditating
[15:22] there and uh I just kind of went back to
[15:25] this sermon I thought I was going to go
[15:26] with the thought on Joy I thought I was
[15:28] going to go with joy dancing with joy
[15:30] but I just felt led to hear go here so
[15:33] kind of how I try to do it by God's
[15:35] grace so now um I want to see how
[15:37] isolation uh kind of fits in with trials
[15:39] and temptations because they're the same
[15:41] thing a trial or Temptation right same
[15:44] thing
[15:46] now regarding this trial or Temptation
[15:49] so if you're not in that isolation with
[15:51] God then you're in one of these right
[15:52] you're either approaching you're you're
[15:54] coming up to a temptation
[15:57] right or you're in the trial or
[16:00] temptation
[16:01] or you're a hedge from the trial or
[16:03] temptation
[16:05] all right right
[16:06] so it's very similar right to the
[16:07] isolation you're the isolated with God
[16:09] you got the Hedge and just you and God
[16:12] right Satan gets mad at that one we saw
[16:14] that in the Book of Job he gets mad when
[16:16] God does that if I say do it more God
[16:19] Amen do it more praise God it's not
[16:22] going to be shutting with the Lord
[16:24] but see we're either in one of these and
[16:25] this is the thought I preached this back
[16:27] in I think 2013 almost 10 years ago I
[16:28] preached this little thought I'm not
[16:30] going to preach much of that but this is
[16:31] just that thought I had I was like oh
[16:32] yeah that's right we're either
[16:34] approaching one we're in one or we're
[16:36] hedged from one
[16:41] and so uh here's the one we're
[16:42] approaching it Jesus come to disciples
[16:45] this on the night of his arrest and
[16:46] finding them asleep and said unto Peter
[16:48] what could you not what watch with me
[16:49] one hour now look Jesus says you would
[16:51] have been able to overcome if you would
[16:53] have prayed one hour
[16:55] think about that if they would have
[16:57] prayed one hour they would not have been
[16:58] afraid about being arrested and would
[17:00] not have scattered think about that
[17:01] think about the power of Prayer in The
[17:04] Hour of Power That's Why They Call It
[17:05] The Hour of Power
[17:08] the televangelist stole that that
[17:10] actually less holy ghost power
[17:12] they stole it and they made it a TV show
[17:13] it's not the hour of power of the TV
[17:15] show it's The Hour of Prayer
[17:18] and I pray this weekend an hour all for
[17:20] Sunday service
[17:23] I made sure I was like that's why I gave
[17:24] the amen that envelope I said I'm going
[17:26] to pray for an hour I'm going to see if
[17:27] something happens on Sunday now I didn't
[17:28] see a whole lot Supernatural but I saw a
[17:30] person who'd been gone for 12 years come
[17:32] up for prayer
[17:34] so I said I'll take that I'll take that
[17:36] amen I've been praying for them inviting
[17:38] them back to church praise God
[17:40] and uh just see the tears and it was
[17:42] just really beautiful so I'll take that
[17:44] praise God
[17:45] but see I got to reach out more in the
[17:47] spirit though
[17:49] he says watch him pray that you enter
[17:51] not into temptation in other words
[17:53] you're approaching a Temptation what was
[17:55] it it was arrest right it was scattering
[17:57] Satan had a trap and he was going to
[17:59] scatter all these Burly fishermen right
[18:02] who could one could walk on water at one
[18:04] time right
[18:05] oh I'll never forsake you Jesus I'll die
[18:07] for you tonight
[18:09] but a Temptation was coming then
[18:12] right they were coming right up to it or
[18:14] I said like this it was coming right to
[18:15] them
[18:16] right the mob came right up to them
[18:19] it came to them
[18:21] and Jesus says
[18:23] you're going to approach it he said the
[18:25] only way to approach it
[18:26] is getting your flesh and mine in one
[18:29] Accord with a soul hey there it is amen
[18:31] hallelujah praise God he hurts me can't
[18:33] get too tired on God
[18:36] right if not we're going to enter into
[18:38] the Temptation that's why we got to
[18:40] sleep good
[18:43] you got to eat good
[18:45] right
[18:46] you got to cast your cares on the Lord
[18:48] you can't be stressed out
[18:51] because the the Temptation is coming
[18:55] pray that you don't enter into it and
[18:58] you got to have your flesh you got to
[18:59] have your mind and you got to have that
[19:01] one Accord with the soul praise God I
[19:03] didn't see that till now praise God
[19:06] your flesh is weak so you better take
[19:07] care of that flesh
[19:10] and bring it under subjection to the
[19:11] word of God Hallelujah
[19:14] so here we see you know these disciples

[19:20] place where here it comes here comes the
[19:22] battle and I let oh my I even love this

[19:29] prepare them for that oh there it is
[19:31] right there the Holy Ghost will bring
[19:32] sermons and try to prepare you for the
[19:34] next the next battle Yeah

[19:58] need each other's help here tonight
[19:59] praise God
[20:01] and who's depending on our prayers now
[20:03] we've seen it with Jose God's really
[20:04] blessed our prayers
[20:06] awesome
[20:08] those who prayed for the Jose God's
[20:09] delivered him from some of these health
[20:11] issues because of some of our prayers
[20:15] now how much more everybody else I'm
[20:17] just saying he's one person what about
[20:19] the rest of the church
[20:21] see how our prayers are going to be so
[20:23] pivotal because God will put it on our
[20:25] heart it'll bring a sermon or it's a
[20:27] song or something let you know a trial
[20:29] is coming you better get into prayer
[20:32] Hallelujah if you're going to overcome
[20:34] you need an hour of power amen
[20:36] hallelujah praise God Amen
[20:39] amen that's right that's right church
[20:41] and after that hour of weekend of prayer
[20:43] I felt so much I felt really good I knew
[20:45] God was going to move on Sunday I knew
[20:47] it I didn't know how but I was like oh
[20:48] God's gonna move today that's why I
[20:49] wrote that down I never did that before
[20:51] I gave it to brother amen
[20:55] I just felt led I just felt burden there
[20:57] I felt burdened uh about that
[20:59] but here you know you you might be here
[21:01] you might be here where you're
[21:03] approaching or God is bringing a trial
[21:05] your way
[21:06] right
[21:09] and so that's what we need we need uh to
[21:11] understand well am I approaching one if
[21:13] so I better get into prayer
[21:15] I better get into prayer
[21:17] now here the second one is when you're
[21:19] in the trial
[21:21] right now this just so you know this
[21:23] this trial Peter writes about it doesn't
[21:24] seem like it's self-inflicted this seems
[21:26] like you're being tested
[21:28] you know because God's maybe pulling
[21:30] away from you right to test your faith
[21:33] now look wherein ye greatly Rejoice
[21:35] though now for a season a season a
[21:38] season of testing if need be ye are in
[21:41] heaviness through manifold Temptations
[21:44] so they are heavy temptations there are
[21:46] lots this church Peter wrote to had lots
[21:49] of Temptations right now like they were
[21:51] he wrote them that letter in the moment
[21:53] they're going through his trial after
[21:54] trial
[21:55] it's time it might be a year it might be
[21:58] a year of tests after test struggle
[22:00] after struggle but Peter said don't
[22:02] forget to Rejoice because the trial of
[22:04] your faith is more precious than gold
[22:06] amen
[22:07] it's producing something in you amen
[22:10] it's not meaningless it's producing a
[22:12] weight of glory amen if I can quote John
[22:15] Piper I love that
[22:17] no you slay me oh
[22:19] if you like playing that tonight
[22:21] it's producing something
[22:23] Hallelujah
[22:25] it's creating in you an expectation for
[22:28] God to move
[22:30] right either a move here on Earth or
[22:32] move you up to heaven
[22:34] right if it's the end of your road
[22:37] no matter the suffering whatever the
[22:38] manifold temptation is oh this is I feel
[22:40] like I can't handle much more of this
[22:42] this is overwhelming this is
[22:44] overwhelming but take courage it's
[22:46] producing something praise God it's
[22:47] either getting you ready for greater
[22:49] battles down the road or it's getting
[22:50] ready for you to get your great reward
[22:52] are you laughing a theophany body
[22:55] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[22:58] a place in heaven Hallelujah
[23:01] to be absent from the body be present
[23:03] with the Lord It's producing a weight of
[23:06] Glory praise God
[23:09] and so this church was going through
[23:11] manifold not one Temptation oh brother
[23:13] Justin really struggling with this one
[23:14] Temptation they had more than that they
[23:16] had lots of them
[23:18] think of the busiest or hardest time of
[23:20] your life which what would it be
[23:23] you got troubles in the home
[23:25] you got troubles with your health right
[23:27] think of job
[23:28] you got troubles on the job
[23:30] troubles in the church
[23:32] everywhere you look it's just oh Burden
[23:35] Burden Burden when is this ever going to
[23:37] end
[23:37] but see God allows you to go in there
[23:39] because he put you in the fires
[23:42] to burn away some of that dross Amen to
[23:46] burn away some of that uh Humanity or
[23:48] those human thoughts
[23:50] right
[23:53] it's being tried it's your faith is
[23:55] being tested by fire that's why I
[23:58] believe one of the one of the
[23:59] definitions of that you're baptized with
[24:01] the Holy Ghost and Fire
[24:03] that's either the fire of God in your
[24:04] soul or it's the bats of the Holy Ghost
[24:06] in your soul so you can endure the fires
[24:08] of Trials
[24:10] it could be either one Holy Ghost and
[24:11] Fire because we see it here it's more
[24:13] it's tried with fire then these are born
[24:15] again Saints
[24:16] Peter tells them later You've Got The
[24:18] Incorruptible seed of God Amen
[24:20] Hallelujah you're not born again of a
[24:22] natural seed it's an Incorruptible it's
[24:25] an eternal seed of God Amen you're a
[24:27] gene seed of God you're an attribute of
[24:29] God you've got eternal life Hallelujah
[24:32] but yet you're going through heavy
[24:35] manifold Temptation battle after battle
[24:38] after battle
[24:40] when am I going to get out of this
[24:41] battle when it's your season to get out
[24:43] of the battle
[24:45] Hallelujah so what you should you do he
[24:47] said Rejoice
[24:49] I know it's hard church I know it's hard
[24:52] I'll say Amen with all of you that's
[24:53] hard
[24:55] it's extremely hard
[24:59] that's what I love about coming to
[25:00] church though even I can have like a
[25:01] headache I can be in the midst of a
[25:02] trials
[25:03] but I feel like this is this is my time
[25:05] to just forget all about that and just
[25:07] meditate on Jesus
[25:10] Hallelujah I know there might be battles
[25:12] after church there might have been
[25:13] battles before church there might I know
[25:15] there might be battles tomorrow or this
[25:17] weekend there's going to be a battle but
[25:18] at least I can forget about that for a
[25:20] few moments I can get in the prince of
[25:22] God I can give God praise Hallelujah I
[25:24] can worship him because he's worthy of
[25:27] my praise
[25:28] and I then I can say Glory then I can
[25:31] say at least I've praised him in the
[25:33] trial amen
[25:35] at least I went to church and praised
[25:37] him instead of complaining about it
[25:40] and say you'll say well uh you're you're
[25:42] a hypocrite well of course my flesh is a
[25:44] hypocrite
[25:46] but I'm not talking about my flesh here
[25:50] that's why I need a blood sacrifice of
[25:53] course I'm a hypocrite but Satan
[25:54] actually you're the biggest hypocrite I
[25:56] know
[25:57] because you were by the very Throne of
[25:59] God and tried to exalt yourself above
[26:01] God you actually sang to God and now
[26:03] you're fighting against God but your
[26:05] ending is a lot worse than mine amen I
[26:08] don't have a bad ending I might go to
[26:09] the grave but my soul lives Hallelujah
[26:12] and I'll go to the prince of God but
[26:14] you're going to Lake of Fire so I'm not
[26:16] going to listen to you I'm listening to
[26:18] God's word amen
[26:20] Glory
[26:21] Hallelujah
[26:23] in other words I might have cancer I
[26:26] might have a Parkinson's who knows what
[26:28] will happen hopefully none of it but
[26:30] what if you do
[26:32] a lot of message people have died over
[26:33] the last few years who would have
[26:35] thought who would have thought we'd be
[26:36] here in 2023
[26:41] you know you don't you don't know but
[26:42] you got to have faith so that when you
[26:44] go through the trials you can overcome
[26:46] praise God
[26:48] and you can praise God you can bless God
[26:50] in the midst of the trials Hallelujah
[26:53] so you don't complain or you know we're
[26:55] all going to battle that but you got to
[26:57] overcome praise God
[26:59] you got to recognize this is just a test
[27:01] God is refining me I'm becoming a better
[27:04] Christian praise God
[27:06] oh Hallelujah
[27:12] so rejoice in the midst they're in the
[27:14] midst of the fire they're in the midst
[27:15] of the temptation
[27:17] all the Temptations are all around them
[27:19] they're tempted to be angry they're
[27:21] tempted to be bitter they're tempted to
[27:22] lust they're tempted to steal they're
[27:24] tempted to lie all these Temptations
[27:26] right but Peter said Rejoice your faith
[27:29] is being tested
[27:31] and church if you're a child of God
[27:33] you're going to pass the test
[27:35] because God won't give you a test you
[27:37] can't pass amen
[27:39] God's not some of these whack teachers
[27:41] out there you know he's he's a he's a
[27:42] faithful teacher Hallelujah he's the
[27:45] best teacher
[27:46] he's not going to allow you to be
[27:47] overcome he's going to rescue you praise
[27:49] God
[27:50] amen so these were trials that didn't
[27:53] seem self-inflicted
[27:56] now this one is self-inflicted
[27:59] okay now Paul is speaking to about the
[28:02] ministers the servant and Lord must not
[28:04] strive but be gentle unto all men apt to
[28:07] teach impatient
[28:08] now watch this
[28:10] if someone comes to church and they're
[28:12] in an awful struggle or a snare or
[28:15] they're in uh isolated by themselves
[28:17] as a minister or Minister we have to in
[28:21] order to help them we've got to be meek
[28:22] to help them
[28:24] we can't be prideful like oh you're a
[28:26] backslidden like William was telling me
[28:28] you've seen preachers do that oh that
[28:30] you're just a bachelor and so and so you
[28:32] got to repent all this it's actually
[28:33] meekness
[28:35] is what wins over people that are caught
[28:37] in snares
[28:39] see it's the tender hand of Jehovah can
[28:40] I say like that hallelujah it's gentle
[28:43] Jesus
[28:45] right
[28:46] now there are time for rebukes don't get
[28:48] me wrong
[28:49] but here's what I'm just giving you
[28:50] here's the context of what Paul said
[28:52] the sermon of the Lord in meekness must
[28:55] instruct those that oppose themselves
[28:57] they're fighting against themselves
[28:58] they're causing their own problems
[29:01] they're causing their own addictions
[29:03] like they're the cause of that they're
[29:06] they're defeating themselves but the
[29:08] servant Lord must not point that out so
[29:10] much the server Lord must be humble yeah
[29:14] or say in a humble way
[29:16] see we've got to be meek well here's
[29:18] here's where you went wrong
[29:20] you know here's we got to do this to get
[29:22] out of this snare got to do this next
[29:23] and do that
[29:26] right it's got to be humble not prideful
[29:28] it's got to be humble
[29:30] so if someone is in their own
[29:32] uh Temptation they've caused it's their
[29:34] own isolation their their own desires
[29:37] have led them into this a minister have
[29:39] to has the spirit of humility
[29:42] to instruct them well here's how you get
[29:44] out of it
[29:45] you know you know why a minister can do
[29:47] that because the minister has been in
[29:48] Trials before
[29:50] amen that's why the Bible says the
[29:52] minister can't be a novice
[29:54] he had to go through some trials
[29:56] you don't put a guy who just got saved
[29:58] up there and start preaching he don't
[29:59] know nothing about any battles
[30:01] he's not even he's not even had a trial
[30:03] come to him right
[30:05] now he's living in sin yeah he might add
[30:06] one Victory he got to salvation but he
[30:08] hasn't weathered any storms
[30:11] he hasn't gone through the season but
[30:12] Church you and I have gone through the
[30:14] seasons amen
[30:15] Hallelujah
[30:17] we know how to fight we know how to
[30:19] overcome praise God and it's through
[30:21] humility it's through obeying the word
[30:23] of God and because we've overcome now
[30:25] that we've overcome we can tell people
[30:27] this is how you'll overcome praise God
[30:30] Hallelujah
[30:33] now look if now look at this it's a big
[30:35] if not every person we minister to is
[30:37] going to come out of their addiction or
[30:39] their Temptation if
[30:41] God per Adventure will give them
[30:43] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[30:45] truth
[30:46] see it's it's in God's hand this is God
[30:49] in other words God knows this person's
[30:50] choices what they're going to do God has
[30:52] predestinated this event
[30:54] right and all we can do sometimes Church
[30:56] all we can do is just instruct them
[30:58] here's how you get out but they've got
[30:59] to get out
[31:01] right
[31:03] if God will give them repentance see
[31:06] they've got to acknowledge the truth
[31:07] most of the time it's your own it's our
[31:08] own fault right if we're in snares it's
[31:10] our own fault
[31:13] can you think of a time where you were
[31:14] in a snare and it wasn't your fault
[31:16] right most of the time it's my fault
[31:18] right I shouldn't have done that I
[31:19] should have had better poor knowledge
[31:21] than that like I told you some of my
[31:22] thoughts on Sunday night remember I told
[31:23] you two of my faults there from the fall
[31:26] I'm not ashamed I'm sorry I'm
[31:28] embarrassed about that I'm ashamed of
[31:29] that
[31:30] but I got caught up in uh the past I got
[31:33] caught up and I didn't even think about
[31:34] wow it's gonna be totally different than
[31:36] what it was like when I was in school
[31:38] and it was it was ten times it was 20
[31:40] times worse than it was when I was in
[31:41] school
[31:42] I couldn't believe that
[31:44] but that was my fault
[31:46] but see all we can do is instruct and
[31:48] then we got to pray that they will
[31:50] recover themselves out of the snare of
[31:52] the devil who are taken captive by him
[31:55] at his will
[31:57] see God doesn't tempt us the devil
[32:00] tempts us
[32:01] and so it's Satan's will I want to
[32:03] attempt brother Jesse or I'm going to
[32:05] tap it Malachi or I gotta I got this
[32:08] snare set up for Lydia and I can't wait
[32:10] to hurt them I can't wait to wound them
[32:12] I can't wait to get them trapped so they
[32:14] uh so they doubt God or they speak evil
[32:16] or they they get hatred in their hearts
[32:19] remember the Bible said Jesus said Peter
[32:21] Satan has a desire to sift you as wheat
[32:24] well how do you sift wheat you got to
[32:25] shake it around you agitate it right
[32:27] agitate you got to throw it up in the
[32:28] air That's what Satan wants to do shake
[32:30] up our lives and throw it up in the air
[32:31] and it's all chaos
[32:34] right Satan wants to create chaos but
[32:36] you've got to trust in God hallelujah
[32:38] amen
[32:39] you got to find peace Amen in the midst
[32:41] of the storm amen
[32:44] you gotta find victory in the midst of
[32:47] the trial in the midst of your
[32:48] Temptation you got to find joy you got
[32:50] to find rejoicing you got to find a
[32:52] promise of God Amen
[32:55] we can't look at the natural things we
[32:57] gotta look at the spiritual things amen
[32:58] we don't look at things that are seen we
[33:00] look at the Unseen amen
[33:06] so Satan desired to trap and put
[33:09] yourself in there he trapped us let's
[33:11] say we're in a snare
[33:12] it was Satan's will but see we gave our
[33:14] will over to that and now we've got to
[33:17] Humble ourselves we've got to
[33:18] acknowledge the truth so we can get out
[33:20] of this
[33:22] see what is it it's always about the
[33:24] truth the spirit of Truth
[33:26] that's why you got to Worship in spirit
[33:28] and Truth
[33:31] see that's why if we come to church and
[33:33] the word of God doesn't change us it
[33:34] doesn't do if the truth doesn't do
[33:36] something to us we're in a bad spot
[33:38] because the acknowledging the truth sets
[33:40] us free
[33:41] the word of God Jesus has Sanctified
[33:43] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[33:46] the word is truth amen just the word
[33:48] preach should set people free praise God
[33:51] Amen they can acknowledge that in the
[33:53] spirit of God they believe that they

[42:09] see hedge your hedge God has you fenced
[42:12] around with walls of salvation
[42:15] Gates of praise
[42:18] Hallelujah
[42:19] the church sometimes you know as a song
[42:21] leader I'm sure but amen I'm not Amos
[42:22] never told me this but I know as a song
[42:24] leader when I see people not praising
[42:25] God like they ought to sometimes I
[42:27] wonder what's going on in their life
[42:30] how can you not praise God
[42:33] are those hands so heavy you can't lift
[42:35] them to Jesus
[42:36] at least you can lift them some people
[42:38] can't lift their hands right
[42:41] this is the this is the protection
[42:43] the Bible said he inhabits there it is
[42:45] he inhabits them Praises of his people
[42:48] you want God's anoint you start praising
[42:51] God Amen
[42:53] start dancers start shouting start
[42:55] singing start moving praise God because
[42:57] God will come and anoint that worship
[42:59] amen
[43:00] Hallelujah he comes to anoint those who
[43:04] worship Him amen
[43:06] hallelujah thank you Jesus beautiful
[43:08] scripture Lord Jesus thank you
[43:10] thank you Hallelujah
[43:12] he Hedges us about with salvation
[43:16] with praise
[43:18] Hallelujah
[43:21] see church that's what we need we need a
[43:22] life of praise
[43:24] right we need a life knowing we're saved
[43:27] Hallelujah
[43:29] I know I'm saved and that also means I
[43:32] know Satan's going to try to do
[43:33] everything he can to think to convince
[43:34] me I'm not
[43:36] but I'm gonna do everything I can to
[43:38] convince him I am
[43:39] Hallelujah
[43:40] that's right
[43:42] now remember there's these these
[43:44] principles on Temptations remember
[43:46] you're either coming one coming to one
[43:48] you're in one or you're protected from
[43:50] them
[43:51] right but we have these principles and
[43:53] these ought to make us rejoice
[43:55] God will not allow us to be defeated in
[43:58] Temptation if we want to overcome
[44:01] right
[44:03] he will not suffer Saints I copy this
[44:06] from Albert Barnes I think it was
[44:08] to be exposed or beyond their powers to
[44:12] bear
[44:13] God won't make the burden so heavy that
[44:15] you just you have to quit no there's
[44:17] always strength
[44:19] God will always give you strength to
[44:20] Bear the burden
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:23] it's never going to be too hard like oh
[44:25] I can't overcome the peer pressure or I
[44:27] can't overcome the feeling or I can't
[44:29] overcome the Temptation it's never going
[44:31] to be like that
[44:33] God's gracious
[44:35] Hallelujah
[44:36] he's not going to make it too hard
[44:39] right because then every sinner would go
[44:41] to heaven and say well I couldn't handle
[44:42] God's gonna say like yeah you could
[44:45] anybody could look Jesse could her the
[44:47] sister could brother could you know we
[44:49] can overcome it
[44:51] God makes a way of escape and knows how
[44:53] to deliver
[44:55] so God's trying to do a testimony in
[44:57] your life praise God he allows his snare
[45:00] to be set but he also allows a great
[45:02] escape and a great way out
[45:04] God wants to give a testimony through
[45:06] this
[45:07] God allows us temptation to come so you
[45:10] can overcome and then you can give a
[45:12] testimony at church on Wednesday night
[45:14] yes or on Sunday morning or Sunday night
[45:18] or on a podcast amen
[45:20] you give a testimony praise God
[45:22] wants you to find the way out like
[45:25] that's why they put those exit signs
[45:26] that's why it's code you got to have the
[45:28] way out it's got to be clear it's got to
[45:29] be playing God can't make it any more
[45:31] plainer than giving us the word of God
[45:33] and sermons and songs all have testify
[45:35] that God's away maker praise God
[45:39] he makes a way through the fire makes a
[45:42] way through the Temptation whether it's
[45:43] manifold or wood or you're just
[45:45] approaching one he'll always make a way
[45:48] so you can get out praise God
[45:51] hmm
[45:53] he knows how to deliver you
[45:57] he gives you Grace to embed to Bear The
[46:00] Temptations
[46:02] I can put up with this for a little
[46:04] while longer
[46:06] I can handle this for a few more days
[46:10] Hallelujah
[46:12] and the Bible said yeah like first Peter
[46:14] said we may have heavy Temptations it
[46:16] may be like it may be like War this may
[46:18] be a season of War one after another one
[46:21] after another but God's always going to
[46:23] make a way out
[46:26] brother Ram said I have the quote I
[46:28] didn't put it up here but remember said
[46:29] the test is the best thing that happened
[46:30] to you
[46:33] I wonder if job would say that
[46:35] right
[46:36] it's the best thing that happened to you
[46:38] because it's going to purify you
[46:40] it's going to promote the character of
[46:42] Christ in your life
[46:48] and then Paul said this was a good
[46:50] thought I thought Paul said I had a
[46:51] Temptation in my flesh sometimes you're
[46:53] being tested in your flesh mainly
[46:56] right a sickness
[46:58] tumor
[47:00] covid
[47:01] you know whatever it is sometimes it's a
[47:03] battle of the Mind
[47:05] the test is up here complex right
[47:09] I can overcome this complex I just can't
[47:11] stop thinking about that I can't stop
[47:13] worrying about that
[47:15] there's a balm in Gilead for that
[47:19] there's a serum for that there's a
[47:22] solution to that problem praise God Amen
[47:24] we all know it but it's good it's great
[47:26] to hear it amen because we forget about
[47:28] it right we go through battles and
[47:30] trials it's great to hear about it again
[47:31] it's great to have that reminder stir up
[47:33] my mind by way of remembrance praise God
[47:36] remind me who I am amen remind me of the
[47:39] word of God remind me of the victories
[47:41] remind me of the promises remind me of
[47:43] God's favor on my life amen
[47:46] remind me of God's love for me praise
[47:48] God hallelujah
[47:51] oh God loves you
[47:53] he loves me
[47:55] sometimes you got to locate the
[47:57] Temptation most of us is going to be in
[47:59] the flesh or the mind
[48:00] ain't gonna be the soul because the
[48:02] Soul's already given over to the Lord
[48:04] surrender to the Lord
[48:06] right so it's going to be the mind it's
[48:08] these mind battles off of my battles or
[48:10] this this Thorn In My Flesh
[48:12] I just can't get well
[48:14] I can't figure this out we can't find
[48:15] the root cause of it it's a Temptation
[48:18] in the flesh
[48:20] and so God has allowed you you've come
[48:22] to it and now you're in the battle
[48:25] right there in the middle
[48:28] remember like like Albert Barnes said
[48:31] this too he said we can be tempted
[48:32] without entering in temptation
[48:34] right as Jesus overcame everyone
[48:37] so you can be right at you can be right
[48:39] as a neighbor to Temptation I guess or
[48:41] it's right at your doorstep right like
[48:42] brother man talks about the boxer
[48:43] rattlesnakes Hallelujah you could be
[48:46] right there and right next to the
[48:48] temptation but you can still say no
[48:50] you can still overcome praise God
[48:52] hallelujah you can be right in the face
[48:55] right you're looking at it right right
[48:56] in the eyes you can look at the right at
[48:58] the testimony or I'm sorry the
[49:00] Temptation it might seem uh alluring it
[49:02] might seem difficult but even there
[49:04] right in the face of it you've got a
[49:06] high priest who can understand what that
[49:08] feels like amen
[49:10] and the Bible said and even look in the
[49:12] face of Temptation you can reach out and
[49:14] touch the Lord and He Can Be Touched by
[49:16] the feeling of your infirmity amen
[49:18] I say the best way to touch them is
[49:20] probably like this
[49:22] right
[49:23] get on your knees and reach up to heaven
[49:24] praise God hallelujah pray in other
[49:27] words
[49:28] pray and touch the heart of God touch
[49:30] the Throne of God hallelujah
[49:33] amen
[49:34] you can be tempted without entering into
[49:36] it
[49:39] right
[49:42] remember church this was about job I
[49:43] don't you remember this this was a
[49:45] blessing to me when I was looking at my
[49:46] notes from Wagga
[49:48] God is saying hey look how great job is
[49:50] I place the Hedge about him and I won't
[49:52] deny that
[49:54] but job said this caught me when I got a
[49:56] little bit Lacks
[49:59] remember the Bible said that it was in
[50:01] job 16 12. I'm going to read that job
[50:04] 16.
[50:06] so that's why it's important church
[50:08] that's why discipline is so important I
[50:09] know it's hard to preach and hard to
[50:11] hear
[50:12] uh verse I was at ease but he hath
[50:16] broken me asunder and he hath also taken
[50:18] me by my neck and shaken me to pieces
[50:20] and set me up for his mark
[50:23] though he slay me yet I'll trust him
[50:24] same as who said that said this
[50:29] so see job was faithful with the prayers
[50:31] but look he was human too just like you
[50:34] right and remember John the Baptist was
[50:36] greater than job
[50:38] he's greater than Moses
[50:40] John the Baptist is greater than Enoch
[50:41] we talked about John the Baptist last
[50:42] night that's why he's fresh on my mind
[50:43] did the Bible say last night man of the
[50:46] wilderness
[50:48] but see Joe got the spot where he just
[50:50] took a look started taking a cruise
[50:51] control on his spiritual life
[50:54] well I just try to get through these
[50:55] Services I'm not going to really put
[50:56] much into them
[50:58] like I should
[51:00] like the pastor's been preaching right
[51:03] or the guest preacher or whoever it is
[51:05] yeah
[51:06] see we kind of take an Ease on we we put
[51:09] we take a little uh we take our foot off
[51:11] the pedal maybe that's a better
[51:12] illustration bar
[51:14] rather than pressing into it and really
[51:16] going into it we kind of take a step
[51:18] back well that's a good time well that
[51:20] was the time God allowed okay you can be
[51:22] tested you can be Satan can have these
[51:25] things
[51:26] this hedge can be taken away when he was
[51:28] at ease
[51:33] all right
[51:35] now even at the end remember he abhorred
[51:38] himself with sackcloch and Ashes he
[51:40] didn't feel better about himself
[51:41] afterwards he actually felt worse
[51:44] because the test exposed what was in his
[51:46] heart
[51:48] remember church he exalted himself above
[51:51] God he said God is unrighteous and I'm
[51:53] righteous see how that was still in his
[51:55] heart
[51:56] he got prideful I gave to the Widow I
[51:58] gave to the poor
[51:59] I sacrificed all this look how righteous
[52:02] I am and God's saying you still got some
[52:04] pride in there
[52:06] how many know you still got some pride
[52:07] in there you always raise your hands
[52:08] unless you want to
[52:10] all right let's be honest
[52:16] still had some pride left
[52:18] and yet God looked down and said God
[52:20] he's perfect
[52:22] right because of the sacrifice
[52:24] because of predestination because of
[52:26] election
[52:29] God knew he's going to get purged he's
[52:31] going to be on fire right he's going to
[52:32] get purged by the fire he's going to be
[52:34] made more like my my like my my
[52:36] character or my my image
[52:38] right he needed purging
[52:41] and he said you know these things came
[52:42] about me because of fear
[52:45] so he got a little he took his little
[52:47] lacks on Godzilla got a little lazy on
[52:49] God will say and then he started letting
[52:51] fear come in
[52:54] instead of praying about it he
[52:56] maybe got worried about it
[52:58] right
[53:00] or started talking with his wife about
[53:01] well boy if this happens that sure would
[53:04] be awful wouldn't it
[53:06] yeah let's not talk about that you know
[53:08] let's pray about it right let's not talk
[53:11] about that let's pray about it
[53:15] remember you know like Paul said we all
[53:17] need to take heed lest we fall
[53:21] and so just like job this is Temptations
[53:23] common to all men and women right so let
[53:25] me say like this you and I are going to
[53:27] come to a season where we're a little
[53:28] taking little lacks on God
[53:32] we get a little lazy on our prayer life
[53:34] little lays on our prayer reading right
[53:36] our Bible reading rather pray everything
[53:37] Bible reading you're a little lazy on
[53:41] our amens but listen church God is
[53:43] faithful
[53:45] and God said
[53:47] all things work together not some things
[53:50] all things work together even in my
[53:52] human element of getting lazy my human
[53:54] element being tired all things will
[53:56] still work together for my good amen
[53:59] God's already good but God's trying to
[54:01] make me good amen
[54:03] Hallelujah
[54:05] all things will work together for my
[54:06] good because God's already good
[54:08] I'm the one who needs to be better or
[54:10] gooder like brother Brooks would say
[54:13] don't get no gooder than that brother
[54:14] Brook said
[54:16] Hallelujah
[54:19] I'm the one that needs to be better
[54:21] and all things will work together for
[54:23] good to them that love the Lord we
[54:24] believe that
[54:25] right
[54:27] now this is what now here a little bit
[54:28] more on uh Hezekiah I just went a little
[54:30] bit but uh
[54:32] sometimes God isolates his anointing
[54:34] right but he never forsakes us
[54:37] right just like the Bible said the Holy
[54:39] Spirit can be grieved the Holy Spirit
[54:41] can be offended but then there's times
[54:43] where the holy spirit's not offended but
[54:44] he withdraws his Spirit from from us
[54:48] I feel that all the time like I said I
[54:50] wake I go to bed happy in the Lord I
[54:51] wake up I don't even feel like a
[54:53] Christian
[54:54] how did this happen
[54:56] I just danced around the church
[54:57] yesterday how could this happen I
[54:59] shouted till my throat hurt
[55:01] I praise God I I was I cried I wept how
[55:04] can this happen
[55:05] welcome to humanity
[55:08] welcome to the cycle of Revival actually
[55:10] death and Revival
[55:12] so he was left alone to be tempted right
[55:14] tested
[55:17] he wanted to see God wanted him to see
[55:19] what was still in his mind he still had
[55:21] pride in his mind
[55:23] look how great we are
[55:25] aren't we the greatest people on the
[55:27] face of the Earth
[55:30] the message people call themselves The
[55:31] Greatest about them my wife gave me a
[55:33] good thought on there even the Catholics
[55:34] don't say they're the greatest
[55:35] Christians of all time
[55:37] and dinner say if time goes on the
[55:40] Pentecostals will be way worse than the
[55:41] Catholics that's what program said now
[55:43] look at the message people today they'll
[55:45] say things even Catholics won't say
[55:47] we're the greatest Christians of all
[55:48] time even a Catholic or Baptist or
[55:50] Luther won't even say that
[55:53] isn't that something
[55:55] I was really inspired honey I thought
[55:56] that was inspired
[55:58] yeah see so God wants to see what's on
[56:00] your mind what do you where do you let
[56:01] your mind wander
[56:04] see God withdrew himself let me see what
[56:06] Hezekiah I'm going to give him 15 more
[56:07] years I'm going to bless him and honor
[56:09] him
[56:10] and I'm well he already knew but God's
[56:12] gonna say he's going to find out what's
[56:13] in his heart
[56:18] you don't see that with John the Baptist
[56:19] Glory
[56:20] right God withdrew his spirit and he
[56:22] said are you the Messiah or not
[56:25] don't worry that's a beautiful story
[56:26] amen I might as well preach on that
[56:28] Hallelujah
[56:29] are you the one or we look for another
[56:31] we read those in the scripture right
[56:32] yesterday
[56:34] and in John's weakest hour Christ gave
[56:37] him the greatest words of encouragement
[56:38] he could ever get praise God Amen
[56:40] Christian when word our weakest Jesus
[56:43] will do his best to encourage us amen
[56:47] he said go tell John he said he's more
[56:50] than a prophet Hallelujah he's a
[56:52] messenger of the Covenant and there's
[56:53] never been a prophet as great as him
[56:55] praise God
[56:56] Dory he got that last word right as he
[56:59] was going to get his head chopped off I
[57:01] imagine he was just like Paul oh death
[57:03] where's your thing amen my God has told
[57:05] me my God so am I six months of ministry
[57:08] God said I was the greatest it was all
[57:10] worth it soon I'll see Jesus face to
[57:12] face amen
[57:14] Glory
[57:16] Hallelujah
[57:18] in our weakest moments God will give us
[57:21] the best encouragement
[57:24] thank God Amen
[57:26] Hallelujah
[57:28] well of course that's on my mind because
[57:29] I got a human mind
[57:32] I'm going to struggle I need refined
[57:34] yeah
[57:36] but I'll say like this I'm a work in
[57:37] progress
[57:39] he's still working on me to make me what
[57:42] he wants me to be praise God
[57:44] Hezekiah has a guy could say the same
[57:46] thing
[57:48] but the preaching on this is to motivate
[57:50] you to stay dedicated to God Amen
[57:53] that we all stay dedicated to God
[57:55] hallelujah
[57:57] but understand Even in our trials when
[57:59] God we feel like God's presence have
[58:00] left he'll never forsake us
[58:03] he will bring us back to repentance
[58:06] he'll bring us back to our first love
[58:09] Glory
[58:12] I'll be in the business of the
[58:13] ambassadors of the princes of Babylon
[58:15] who sent unto him to inquire the wonder
[58:16] that was done in the land god left him
[58:18] God left him
[58:20] to try him
[58:22] that he might know all that was in his
[58:24] heart see God already knew it was in his
[58:26] heart
[58:28] but God wanted Hezekiah look at these
[58:30] things you still think about
[58:32] look at these things you still meditate
[58:34] on
[58:35] right he was either 38 or 39. so this
[58:38] test case come sometime after he was 50.
[58:41] brother Brandon went through his complex
[58:43] about leaving the ministry or leaving
[58:45] leaving the churches rather he was still
[58:46] going to be a prophet
[58:48] at 54 years old
[58:50] 54.
[58:53] I'm 42. right and
[58:56] at 54 he was almost talked out to
[58:59] leaving the churches almost talked out
[59:00] of it
[59:02] oh I'm sorry I almost talked into
[59:03] leaving he's almost talked into the
[59:05] temptation of leaving the churches
[59:07] he said I'll just go live up in the
[59:08] wilderness all by myself I won't have to
[59:10] deal with all these people rejecting me
[59:11] and I'll just stomp down like Old
[59:12] Testament prophet and say thus saith the
[59:14] Lord and then walk back out and say see
[59:16] you guys
[59:17] had enough of that that rebellious
[59:20] spirit I don't want to deal with that
[59:21] rebellious spirit
[59:24] he almost walked away
[59:26] all right good
[59:30] Abraham David could admit adultery I
[59:32] think when he was 50 50.
[59:36] they already had eight other wives
[59:38] okay it's a snare Satan set the Trap
[59:42] but he was out of place in the season of
[59:45] War he wasn't in his battle he wasn't in
[59:47] his battle position in war we've got to
[59:49] stay in position Church
[59:51] don't lay down your armor Saints
[59:53] don't lay down that sword of the spear
[59:56] don't take off that Helm of Salvation
[59:57] keep fighting praise God hallelujah look
[1:00:01] when he was at ease there it is when
[1:00:02] he's at ease
[1:00:04] there it is
[1:00:05] that's when the Temptation came
[1:00:07] oh I'm not going to go out this year I'm
[1:00:09] getting too old or I don't know exactly
[1:00:10] what he said but he said I'm not going
[1:00:12] out this year I go out every year to
[1:00:13] fight I'm going out I always go up to
[1:00:15] pray every time I'm not going up to pray
[1:00:17] this time
[1:00:18] I'm not going into battle
[1:00:20] I'm not going to go battle for the
[1:00:21] Saints and the church said
[1:00:23] some people here are depending on your
[1:00:25] prayers

[1:00:30] yeah I know you're depending on mine
[1:00:32] where's Dave Dave where's David they
[1:00:34] were depending on him and he was out of
[1:00:36] position

[1:00:41] right Hagar he let his wife talk him
[1:00:44] into taking another woman

[1:00:51] try the natural route this must be God's
[1:00:53] will
[1:00:54] past 80. father of faith
[1:00:58] well you know I found a scripture today
[1:00:59] where the Bible said about Abraham
[1:01:01] the Bible said God called Abraham and
[1:01:03] Sarah and separated them alone unto
[1:01:06] himself
[1:01:07] amen hallelujah amen he said separate
[1:01:10] yourself from Babylon come out of shinar
[1:01:13] come to a place where you can dwell in
[1:01:15] my presence amen amen
[1:01:17] amen of course he had trials there too
[1:01:18] but he was way better off there in
[1:01:20] Cadence land the land of Melchizedek
[1:01:22] amen he's way better than the land of
[1:01:24] Melchizedek than the land of shinar yeah
[1:01:27] and church we're way better in the
[1:01:29] message of the hour praise God that in
[1:01:31] the Catholic church or the bar something
[1:01:33] like that God's blessed us we're the
[1:01:35] children of Abraham we're in the land of
[1:01:36] possession amen
[1:01:38] the land of the word hallelujah
[1:01:42] thank God
[1:01:44] but there's going to be a time God may
[1:01:46] leave you for a season
[1:01:48] not forsake you but just pull back his
[1:01:51] influence
[1:01:53] now I'm going to let this brother I'm
[1:01:55] let this sister see what's in their
[1:01:57] heart and mind
[1:01:59] and let me say like this church it is
[1:02:01] not a pretty thing
[1:02:03] when we see what's in our heart and
[1:02:04] Minds
[1:02:06] I think you can all say Amen to that
[1:02:10] so see Church even in the midst of our
[1:02:12] trials we're struggling but we're not
[1:02:13] defeated
[1:02:15] Hallelujah job was struggling but he
[1:02:18] sure wasn't going down
[1:02:20] he could ah Glory Satan could not get
[1:02:22] job to curse God Amen Hallelujah
[1:02:26] Hallelujah that's what his wife said she
[1:02:28] was really going through the ringer
[1:02:30] I don't know if she was I imagine she
[1:02:31] was safe
[1:02:33] but she was really really the wrong
[1:02:35] spirit
[1:02:37] but he was struggling but he just kept
[1:02:39] going he just kept going kept going I
[1:02:41] want to talk to God I want God's
[1:02:43] presence I want to hear from God and
[1:02:45] finally he did
[1:02:46] wasn't what he wanted but he got it
[1:02:49] I think he got more than he asked for I
[1:02:50] think is what happened
[1:02:52] God rebuked him and asked him 60 some
[1:02:54] questions and he couldn't even answer
[1:02:55] one of them
[1:02:58] right
[1:02:59] he said where are the storehouses of
[1:03:02] snow where's snow made can you figure
[1:03:03] that one out job where where is snow
[1:03:06] made and where do those Lambs uh
[1:03:08] reproduce where do they give birth out
[1:03:09] there or I'm sorry the mountain goats
[1:03:11] where's all that happen
[1:03:14] Can you tame the Leviathan Can you tame
[1:03:17] the behemoth his Tail's like a cedar can
[1:03:19] he'll he laughs at you God said he
[1:03:22] laughs at you

[1:03:25] things how can you understand the way
[1:03:26] I'm running this world come on you can't
[1:03:28] so just trust and Obey for there's no
[1:03:31] other way to be happy in Jesus but to
[1:03:34] trust in obey Hallelujah
[1:03:36] you can't understand the natural things
[1:03:38] how are you going to understand the
[1:03:39] spiritual things

[1:03:42] debate between God and the devil up
[1:03:45] there he won't understand it no
[1:03:47] right he wasn't going to understand
[1:03:49] he just had to learn how to trust and
[1:03:51] obey
[1:03:54] if God let me say like this if God wants
[1:03:56] you to know something he's going to let
[1:03:57] you know it
[1:03:59] sure if he doesn't let you know that he
[1:04:00] doesn't want you to know
[1:04:02] and he wants your faith to be made
[1:04:04] stronger even in not knowing
[1:04:08] Hallelujah
[1:04:10] right didn't the Bible say the Holy
[1:04:13] Ghost is going to guide you into all
[1:04:14] truth
[1:04:16] well that means if he don't let you know
[1:04:17] some truth then it wasn't part of your
[1:04:19] testimony you didn't need to know it for
[1:04:21] the Holy Ghost you didn't know it need
[1:04:23] to know for the Rapture but you'll know

[1:04:28] unending ages amen you know you've got
[1:04:30] an eternity with Christ Hallelujah age

[1:07:16] ordained that's what they're made to do
[1:07:18] they're make you more of an overcomer

[1:08:02] but see we run for Christ
[1:08:05] we're we're gonna struggle we're going
[1:08:07] to go through these Temptations but
[1:08:08] Christ will help us overcome we're never
[1:08:10] defeated we're never left alone praise
[1:08:12] God we're we're we have a treasure thank
[1:08:14] God we have a treasure in our Earth and
[1:08:16] vessel praise God
[1:08:18] Hallelujah
[1:08:20] always bearing about in the body the
[1:08:22] dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:25] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:08:27] made manifest in our body for which we
[1:08:29] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:08:31] we which
[1:08:33] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:08:35] Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus
[1:08:36] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:08:39] flesh that's why each day you feel like
[1:08:40] I've got to die to this passion I've got
[1:08:42] to die to this desire that's that's
[1:08:44] that's a part of Jesus death
[1:08:47] as you're learning to die out to things
[1:08:49] that's taking a taste of the death of
[1:08:51] Jesus
[1:08:52] he had to die out to every desire
[1:08:53] Brothers he wouldn't have a family it
[1:08:55] could have a family who you know of
[1:08:56] course he could have had a wife you know
[1:08:58] could have all these could have had a
[1:08:59] long life
[1:09:00] but he had to die out to that and we've
[1:09:02] got to die out to the will of God
[1:09:06] now
[1:09:08] here's a paradox
[1:09:10] Paul said God take this Thorn away from
[1:09:13] my flesh three times and Jesus said my
[1:09:16] grace is sufficient for you my strength
[1:09:18] is made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:09:20] therefore will I rather glory in my
[1:09:23] infirmities
[1:09:24] that the power of Christ May rest upon
[1:09:26] me
[1:09:28] he found the strength in the midst of
[1:09:30] his flesh the Temptation was in his
[1:09:32] flesh in the midst of the temptation of
[1:09:34] his flesh he still found ability to
[1:09:36] glory in God
[1:09:38] wonderful
[1:09:40] it's like for example like with brother
[1:09:41] awesome with the headache he still comes
[1:09:43] up here to prayer he still gives God
[1:09:44] praise
[1:09:46] Hallelujah
[1:09:47] I had that headache a few weeks ago I
[1:09:48] just danced right through it God well
[1:09:50] God was gracious and took it away and
[1:09:51] not that I deserved it
[1:09:52] right but I just chose to praise God I'm
[1:09:55] going to keep preaching I'm not going to
[1:09:56] quit I'm not going to give up I'm going
[1:09:57] to keep preaching praise God I'll Glory
[1:09:59] my infirmities
[1:10:01] therefore listen I take Pleasures in
[1:10:03] infirmity
[1:10:04] who does that who likes to get sick
[1:10:07] nobody
[1:10:09] but Paul learned here towards the end of
[1:10:11] his life I've learned to take pleasure
[1:10:13] in these things why
[1:10:16] because it's for Christ's sake
[1:10:19] it's forming Christ it's forming the
[1:10:21] character of Christ in my life I can
[1:10:23] recognize the Temptations in here but I
[1:10:25] can also see the victories up there
[1:10:26] praise God Amen Hallelujah I can see
[1:10:30] this is temporal your afflictions are
[1:10:32] temporary your afflictions are light
[1:10:34] praise God but your Victory and your
[1:10:37] blessings and your reward is great
[1:10:38] Hallelujah
[1:10:41] your trials are light your afflictions
[1:10:43] are temporary but your reward is eternal
[1:10:46] and your reward is an eternal weight of
[1:10:48] Glory
[1:10:50] Hallelujah for when I'm weak
[1:10:52] then I'm strong well this is the same
[1:10:54] idea remember Jesus said when you get
[1:10:55] persecuted when people say evil things
[1:10:57] about you go ahead and leap around the
[1:10:58] church I can't wait to see some leaping
[1:11:00] in here
[1:11:03] Hallelujah I can't wait somebody some of
[1:11:06] you gonna get some persecution
[1:11:08] maybe we'll be singing I'll see somebody
[1:11:10] dancing like oh they just got persecuted
[1:11:11] praise God hallelujah now I know what's
[1:11:14] going on in their life they're getting
[1:11:14] persecuted that's what Jesus said
[1:11:17] leap when you're persecuted
[1:11:20] because great is your reward in heaven
[1:11:23] so when brother and I went through this
[1:11:24] uh
[1:11:25] he went through this complex about
[1:11:27] leaving the ministry
[1:11:29] notice he was isolated in the car Billy
[1:11:32] Paul's sleeping he gets isolated in the
[1:11:34] car
[1:11:36] he was just talking about you know
[1:11:37] moving up up in the Colorado
[1:11:40] many miles away from civilization he
[1:11:43] sent a voice just like you here here as
[1:11:46] you hear mine it sounded so neurotically
[1:11:48] but I've got through expressing have
[1:11:50] ever told you anything that was right
[1:11:51] and a voice got to talking I was talking
[1:11:53] to him and it said carry out your plans
[1:11:55] and you'll be like that
[1:11:57] his stepbrother who was a bum
[1:12:00] if you carry out the plans of your
[1:12:01] complex it's going to lead to your
[1:12:03] ruination
[1:12:05] see church if God let us go through with
[1:12:06] our complexes we'd ruin ourselves
[1:12:09] thank God he corrects us out of our
[1:12:12] complexes amen
[1:12:14] thank God he rescues us out of our
[1:12:16] desires of our flesh and mind
[1:12:19] because else we be bums
[1:12:21] we'd have no hope we'd have no testimony
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:24] no reward
[1:12:26] he said Lord I don't want to be like
[1:12:27] that I don't I don't want to be a bum I
[1:12:29] like my brother-in-law Fletcher
[1:12:32] he and the Holy Spirit said your wife
[1:12:34] will go too your wife will leave you she
[1:12:36] won't live up there in them Hills like
[1:12:37] that and you'll become a bum just as a
[1:12:39] dream showed you would I said I don't
[1:12:41] want to be like that I don't want to
[1:12:42] have to live like that I want something
[1:12:44] different amen hallelujah he thought he
[1:12:46] wanted it but then when he when the Holy
[1:12:48] Spirit came to him he said I don't want
[1:12:50] that
[1:12:51] see how this church our flesh won things
[1:12:53] once things but our soul doesn't want it
[1:12:57] I was told that you called me to be a
[1:12:59] prophet I want to live in the wilderness
[1:13:00] like a prophet but it was my use of my
[1:13:02] own excuse so I could hunt and my own
[1:13:04] good
[1:13:05] look he was making excuses so he could
[1:13:07] enjoy sports more and the church said
[1:13:11] hunting is a sport
[1:13:14] his complex was centered around him
[1:13:16] having no Rebellion to his preaching and
[1:13:19] he could enjoy his Sports more make an
[1:13:20] excuse so he could enjoy the sports
[1:13:23] come on somebody I've walked into Master
[1:13:25] believer's houses they got a TV up there
[1:13:27] watching sports I'm like what is wrong
[1:13:28] with you guys
[1:13:30] you're messaging Believers there are
[1:13:33] some of these some of these same people
[1:13:34] will tell me how great the old days were
[1:13:36] and I'm like what about today
[1:13:38] today looks pretty awful
[1:13:41] they said they could pray all this time
[1:13:43] and sing all this time and do all these
[1:13:44] things I'm like what about what you've
[1:13:46] got sexy women on your what are you
[1:13:48] doing
[1:13:51] what
[1:13:53] see it's always talking about what God
[1:13:55] used to be let's let's have a god of
[1:13:56] right now
[1:13:58] oh God is moving my life right now amen
[1:14:00] he's just as sweet as me now as he was
[1:14:02] 10 years ago amen he gets sweeter and
[1:14:06] sweeter as the days go by Hallelujah
[1:14:09] Glory
[1:14:11] don't tell me what he used to do tell me
[1:14:13] what he's what he used to you now
[1:14:15] and he said but that was prophets of the
[1:14:17] Old Testament so the holy spirit said
[1:14:19] you're not an Old Testament Prophet
[1:14:20] you're a new testament prophet
[1:14:22] you've been called to be in there at
[1:14:24] much higher office than that see New
[1:14:26] Testament prophets are higher
[1:14:28] he said you have more gifts besides that
[1:14:30] you was called to pray for the sick now
[1:14:31] bro that's what we're talking about
[1:14:32] Elijah's were men of the Wilderness but
[1:14:34] in the New Testament they can't be
[1:14:35] totally separated they got to be with
[1:14:37] the church
[1:14:39] brother man thought I can just leave the
[1:14:40] church and the Holy Spirit said no your
[1:14:42] new testament you've got to stay with
[1:14:43] the church because the Bible says gather
[1:14:45] more as you see as you see that day
[1:14:46] approaching
[1:14:48] and brother Brown would be breaking that
[1:14:49] scripture if he would have left the
[1:14:51] church
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:57] they were isolated with God and it was
[1:14:58] the Old Testament yes good brother good
[1:15:01] that's right very good
[1:15:04] Hallelujah
[1:15:05] he said you were called to pray for the
[1:15:07] gifts I'm sorry pray for the sick you
[1:15:08] have more gifts than the Old Testament
[1:15:10] prophets preach the gospel your
[1:15:11] Apostolic gospel or Apostolic prophet
[1:15:14] greater things greater gifts and now
[1:15:17] look the Holy Spirit rebukes him why do
[1:15:19] you wait for me to move you every time
[1:15:20] you move where's your reward and that's
[1:15:23] what I want to say where's our reward
[1:15:24] tonight
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:28] where's our reward our reward is taking
[1:15:30] the word that we know and acting upon it
[1:15:32] praise God
[1:15:34] not running from the commission not
[1:15:36] making an excuse like we all do I'm not
[1:15:38] putting brother bam out there all by
[1:15:39] himself we all do it we all get tempted
[1:15:40] we all get complexes
[1:15:42] but we've got to choose to get back to
[1:15:44] the commission and sometimes God has to
[1:15:46] send out a voice down from heaven amen
[1:15:48] or sometimes God has to say no dream to
[1:15:50] you sometimes God has to bring a sermon
[1:15:51] and it just tells your whole life praise
[1:15:53] God
[1:15:54] what is it it's the grace of God it's
[1:15:56] the tender hand of Jehovah to get you
[1:15:57] back on the right track and to get you
[1:15:59] out of your complex and get you into a
[1:16:01] season where God can bless you praise
[1:16:03] God
[1:16:04] because you got yourself in the wrong
[1:16:06] thing praise God
[1:16:07] I got myself on the wrong thing I can
[1:16:09] say
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:12] Hallelujah
[1:16:15] he said you got like Moses you forgot
[1:16:17] the feeling of your people you forgot to
[1:16:18] call
[1:16:19] the call that I called you to I'm trying
[1:16:21] to close your church I don't have a lot
[1:16:23] to say today
[1:16:24] brother said I let this sick lay so
[1:16:26] brother I'm neglected sick people
[1:16:29] he said I want the Lord to tell me where
[1:16:31] to go and not to go that's wrong I built
[1:16:33] myself a complex
[1:16:36] because the people didn't hear my
[1:16:37] message
[1:16:39] okay now did you catch that there's
[1:16:42] sometimes God's not going to tell you
[1:16:43] where to go like for me as a preacher I
[1:16:45] don't always know who to invite or where
[1:16:46] to go
[1:16:47] sometimes I know for sure and I see a
[1:16:49] Vindicated like Oh Glory
[1:16:51] Hallelujah are there times I don't why
[1:16:53] because God wants me to have a reward
[1:16:56] God wants me to pray and use the gifts
[1:16:57] of my life and wisdom in my life and
[1:17:00] seek God and then I get a reward for
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:05] like God don't tell me why tell us why
[1:17:07] everything happens in our life we don't
[1:17:08] know
[1:17:09] we've got to overcome
[1:17:12] is that right Church
[1:17:14] see there's so see there's a rewards for
[1:17:16] overcoming your complexes
[1:17:18] oh that's a whole other sermon there the
[1:17:21] member Church we're not saved by
[1:17:22] feelings yet I've been preaching about
[1:17:24] all the feelings we get dancing and
[1:17:26] shouting but you're not saved by
[1:17:28] feelings
[1:17:30] well Ram said I'm not safe tonight
[1:17:32] because I get happy and Shout that isn't
[1:17:34] it I'm not saying because the gift of
[1:17:36] God works through me I'm saved because I
[1:17:38] met the conditions that Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] required of me
[1:17:41] I'm saved according to the Bible see is
[1:17:43] that right not because I feel like I'm
[1:17:45] safe Satan can whip you around the stump

[1:22:48] sometimes they're wrong and I didn't
[1:22:49] promise I said maybe
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:52] but so simple
[1:22:54] believe the father's word believe God
[1:22:57] instead of the devil trust God's word
[1:22:59] that's how you know you're saved amen
[1:23:03] this is one of my favorite ones
[1:23:07] yeah listen brother you're never saved
[1:23:08] by any sign you're never saved by any
[1:23:10] sensation
[1:23:12] those are good it's good to have
[1:23:13] feelings and that's good but that's not
[1:23:14] what you're saying by you're saved when
[1:23:16] you meet God's condition of his word
[1:23:18] and nothing else are you saved by that's
[1:23:20] right God's word is made away you're not
[1:23:22] saved because you feel like you're saved
[1:23:23] I'm not saved because I feel like I'm
[1:23:25] saved listen church because a lot of
[1:23:27] times I don't feel that way and the
[1:23:29] church said
[1:23:30] a prophet of God who would have to bite
[1:23:32] his finger when the angel came in a
[1:23:34] prophet of God who felt the tingling all
[1:23:35] the time the prophet of God who would go
[1:23:37] into Visions all the time he said a lot
[1:23:38] of times I don't even feel like I'm
[1:23:40] saved
[1:23:41] see when he stepped out of those Visions
[1:23:43] he got in the flesh
[1:23:45] and God had to leave him at times to
[1:23:46] test him just like Hezekiah just like
[1:23:48] everybody else
[1:23:50] a lot of times I don't even feel like
[1:23:52] I'm saved
[1:23:54] because he had to overcome
[1:23:57] I'm saved because God gave the promise I
[1:23:59] met God's conditions and upon God's holy
[1:24:01] word I can defeat Satan seven days a
[1:24:04] week and as many nights because it's
[1:24:06] God's word
[1:24:08] he said that's what the King of Kings
[1:24:09] said how many have passed from Death
[1:24:10] unto life
[1:24:12] the King of Kings says you'll not come
[1:24:14] into under condemnation
[1:24:17] all right I better find out it's already
[1:24:18] 8 30. let me see if I can find a place
[1:24:20] to close I had some I want to run over a
[1:24:21] few more thoughts here
[1:24:23] okay I just had two more main thoughts
[1:24:26] yeah let me just do this okay when I
[1:24:28] preach the Mighty Man series remember we
[1:24:29] have this we went over these scriptures
[1:24:32] these scriptures help us know that God
[1:24:34] is watching us and we're not alone we're
[1:24:35] not isolated right
[1:24:38] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[1:24:40] God he may exalt you due time cast all
[1:24:42] your care on him for he cares for you
[1:24:44] don't live a stressed out life
[1:24:46] don't live a life full of anxiety tell
[1:24:49] God about your problems and say God I'm
[1:24:51] leaving them with you praise God I can't
[1:24:54] solve them I've tried to solve them uh
[1:24:56] you put you've proved to me I can't
[1:24:58] solve them so I'm giving them to you
[1:24:59] praise God because you care for me
[1:25:03] and church hasn't he cared for you all
[1:25:04] these years
[1:25:07] has he showed it year after year
[1:25:10] month after month
[1:25:12] service after service
[1:25:14] how much he does care
[1:25:16] so if he shows how much he cares let's
[1:25:18] start casting our cares on again
[1:25:20] because we're not alone
[1:25:24] he said fear not so don't be afraid
[1:25:26] little church it's your father's good
[1:25:27] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:25:29] see sometimes I wonder are we going to
[1:25:31] see the latter rain well if I do
[1:25:33] if it comes in my day I am because I
[1:25:35] Fear God
[1:25:37] right I'm in God's Little Flock I'm not
[1:25:39] following all the the harling Shepherds
[1:25:41] hireling Shepherds I'm not following all
[1:25:43] the denominations I'm following the word
[1:25:45] of God
[1:25:46] and this encourages me right I know if I
[1:25:49] live to see the Rapture I'll go in it
[1:25:51] because it's God's pleasure to give me
[1:25:52] the kingdom
[1:25:54] I Fear God right
[1:25:57] I'm part of the little flock I'm not a
[1:25:59] part of the big denominations at mega
[1:26:01] churches I'm a part of God's Little
[1:26:03] Flock
[1:26:05] now this is a good one but I'm gonna
[1:26:06] this is more about Israel but remember
[1:26:07] this one this is so beautiful listen
[1:26:10] church yay I'll Rejoice over them to do
[1:26:12] them good speaking of Israel and I'll
[1:26:13] plant them in this land assuredly with
[1:26:15] my whole heart and with my whole soul
[1:26:18] I just love this verse God said I'm
[1:26:20] gonna put all my heart I'm going to put
[1:26:22] all my soul into getting Israel back to
[1:26:24] that natural land what about us praise
[1:26:26] God God's gonna put all of his heart all
[1:26:28] of his soul to make sure we go in the
[1:26:30] Rapture praise God
[1:26:33] all of him he's not going to put half of
[1:26:35] him he's not going to put half of his
[1:26:36] deity he's going to put all of himself
[1:26:38] he's going to put everything behind it
[1:26:40] praise God he's going to keep pressing
[1:26:42] and keep helping us and he's going to
[1:26:44] make sure we reach the goal praise God
[1:26:48] that ought to encourage everybody
[1:26:52] nothing could be greater than God's
[1:26:54] whole heart and soul
[1:26:57] what he what else could he say
[1:27:00] all right I'm gonna put all my money
[1:27:01] into making sure Israel gets back I'm
[1:27:03] gonna put all my cattles on the Hills

[1:27:16] into it I'm gonna put my heart and soul
[1:27:18] into it
[1:27:20] and if he was that careful about Israel
