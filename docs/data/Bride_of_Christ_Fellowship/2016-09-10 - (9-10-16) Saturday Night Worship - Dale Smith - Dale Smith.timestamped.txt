[53:40] around the word with the Lord Jesus just
[53:45] just shut in with God Amen secret and
[53:50] and just enjoyed the day to be uh Den
[53:55] presence and praise God not to say that
[53:58] we didn't have a few battles with the
[54:00] devil along the way Devil's never going
[54:03] to leave you alone that's right right
[54:06] and so we just uh we just realize that
[54:10] he's uh always about his business but
[54:13] it's good for us to be about the
[54:17] father's business amen praise the lord
[54:21] well I'm sure we realize we were just a
[54:24] few in this evening but uh that doesn't
[54:28] bother me none at all amen man I cut my
[54:31] teeth preaching to a congregation about
[54:33] this size right here and uh so we we
[54:36] know all about uh it's
[54:40] not going to
[54:43] affect my attitude at all matter of fact
[54:47] sometimes the Lord comes in special way
[54:50] when we're just a few like this and so
[54:53] if I get down amongst you
[54:55] he's got me on kind of a short leash
[54:57] here that's and I always was taught that
[55:01] if you put a dog on a short leash makes
[55:02] it
[55:03] mean so if I get mean it's it's not my
[55:08] fault and uh so but we just we know if
[55:12] you if you uh say Amen to the preacher
[55:15] why it six him on the devil right right
[55:18] right so that's our job this evening is
[55:20] to to root out the enemy and that Jesus
[55:24] said he came came to destroy the works
[55:26] of the
[55:27] [Music]
[55:28] devil and we've come to continue in that
[55:33] Worden praise God I would like for you
[55:35] to turn with me into the Book of
[55:37] Proverbs Chapter
[55:40] 6 as you're making your way there I'll
[55:44] uh I'll give some disclaimer to this
[55:49] passage of scripture not that we need to
[55:51] make excuse for the Bible but uh we read
[55:55] realize that uh sometimes when we read a
[55:58] text that it could be uh uh you
[56:01] know people get preconceived ideas from
[56:05] the very beginning but trust me we have
[56:07] a we have a direction where we're going
[56:09] and so and I realize you know we don't
[56:12] we're not preaching to the the world out
[56:15] out about us but we look at our
[56:17] congregation and we and we preached to
[56:19] who's sitting here yes sir yes sir don't
[56:23] uh don't be alarmed at the text just
[56:26] follow along all right amen amen we'll
[56:29] begin reading at verse
[56:32] 27 Proverbs Chapter 6 and verse
[56:37] 27 can a man take fire in his bosom and
[56:41] his clothes not be
[56:43] burned can one go upon hot coals and his
[56:47] feet not be
[56:49] burned so he that goeth into to his
[56:51] neighbor's wife whosoever touches her
[56:54] shall not be innocent right men do not
[56:57] despise a thief if he steal to satisfy
[57:00] his soul when he's hungry but if he be
[57:02] found he shall restore Sevenfold he
[57:05] shall give all the substance of his
[57:07] house but who so committeth adultery
[57:11] with a woman
[57:13] lackthe it destroys his own
[57:17] soul a wound and a dishonor shall he get
[57:22] and his reproach shall not we WIP away

[59:43] fire and there a subtitle scars of
[59:48] Disobedience amen scars of
[59:52] Disobedience and I came to this
[59:58] thought few years back I was ministering
[1:00:03] for a little congregation about this
[1:00:06] size and I went over to the pastor's
[1:00:11] house that evening he we got to talking
[1:00:14] and we had old acquaintance renew I had
[1:00:19] first met them actually the first time I
[1:00:22] ever met the brother was down in Logan
[1:00:24] Ohio by the
[1:00:26] way and uh uh little brother Joel
[1:00:30] PTZ and uh good friend of mine and and
[1:00:33] we uh became quite good friends and so
[1:00:38] we were together one evening and
[1:00:40] fellowshipping and you know how brothers
[1:00:43] would get together and well I had a an
[1:00:46] experience like this one time and he had
[1:00:49] an experience and we realized that we
[1:00:51] were both of the uh had experience and
[1:00:55] he at that time was presently a member
[1:00:58] of a volunteer fire department and I had
[1:01:02] told him about some firefighting
[1:01:04] experience that I had had and we went
[1:01:06] back and forth and and I was telling him
[1:01:09] about uh fighting some fires up in
[1:01:11] Montana big forest fires and what more
[1:01:14] he began to tell me about some of the
[1:01:16] things that he had and he said hey I
[1:01:18] want you to see a website and so we went
[1:01:21] up to his office there and he pulled up
[1:01:23] a website and he started showing me uh
[1:01:27] you know some uh very interesting things
[1:01:30] about new fire fighting equipment you
[1:01:33] know and you know how uh you know us
[1:01:36] Brothers we like things with a lot of
[1:01:37] Chrome on it you know and so he would
[1:01:40] showing me one of these uh uh new uh uh
[1:01:45] ladder trucks and and uh some new pumper
[1:01:48] equipment and then he was showing me
[1:01:50] some exhibitionary type uh uh
[1:01:53] firefighting equipment trck fire trucks
[1:01:56] that had been uh basically had been high
[1:01:59] performance souped up and put on the
[1:02:01] drag strip for uh exhibitionary purposes
[1:02:04] to uh earn money for the they did
[1:02:07] exhibitions for to raise money for the
[1:02:10] local uh volunteer fire departments oh
[1:02:13] my we're just admiring all this red
[1:02:16] paint and chrome and you know and bells
[1:02:18] and whistles and so we were really
[1:02:20] interested in these things and then he
[1:02:22] said man you got to see this and so he
[1:02:24] he took me over to a he put it on a a a
[1:02:28] a training video and uh now i' I've been
[1:02:32] in the Marine Corps and I've experienced
[1:02:34] a lot of you know a lot of training
[1:02:36] videos and safety videos and things like
[1:02:39] that where you know you kind of expect
[1:02:42] to see uh you know dramatization of some
[1:02:46] kind of a mistake that was made and you
[1:02:49] know the guy dropping the hammer and it
[1:02:51] coning somebody on the head and you know
[1:02:53] and thankfully he had hard hat on you
[1:02:55] know that kind of thing and but this was
[1:02:57] a
[1:02:59] a a an
[1:03:01] actual fire that had actually taken
[1:03:04] place and and so uh the fire is is a big
[1:03:08] Warehouse type building and they bring a
[1:03:10] big fire truck up there and we're just
[1:03:12] watching the video and uh big uh
[1:03:16] extension ladder goes out over the top
[1:03:18] of the building and there's a
[1:03:19] superintendent there you can tell he's
[1:03:21] like the chief or something like that he
[1:03:24] gets two of his his uh veterans no doubt
[1:03:27] to put him in this situation and takes
[1:03:29] him up the ladder well they're in full
[1:03:32] uh dress you know full helmet and mask
[1:03:35] and and all their firefighting equipment
[1:03:37] and he's got a helmet and his and his
[1:03:39] walkie talkie in his hand and he runs up
[1:03:42] the ladder and and he's just kind of got
[1:03:44] his shirt sleeves on you know and he
[1:03:46] gets up to the top of the ladder and
[1:03:48] he's pointing out some things and it's
[1:03:50] like he's giving some final instructions
[1:03:53] and then
[1:03:54] as he gives these final instructions you
[1:03:57] know it's like he's going to turn to go
[1:03:59] back down back down to command and at
[1:04:02] that very moment the roof of that
[1:04:04] building it fell in and an Inferno come
[1:04:08] up out of that uh uh uh building and
[1:04:13] engulf those three men over that ladder
[1:04:16] and I was just shocked I was like I
[1:04:19] didn't want to see that you know just
[1:04:22] and and and and but it was one of those
[1:04:24] it was transfixed I couldn't take my
[1:04:26] eyes off of the video and I watched
[1:04:30] those three men burn alive as the camera
[1:04:34] zoomed in on him it was horrific most
[1:04:37] unbelievable thing I I was shocked I was
[1:04:41] I was I was scarred
[1:04:43] instantly I could to this very moment I
[1:04:46] closed my eyes and man I could still see
[1:04:50] the pain the the the the the the over
[1:04:53] those men that were overcome by the
[1:04:56] flames and that burned their bodies and
[1:04:58] they fell and they were they were just
[1:05:01] convulsing in pain and I was shocked I I
[1:05:04] stepped back I said oh brother you could
[1:05:07] have went a long time without showing me
[1:05:09] that right I wasn't expecting to see
[1:05:13] that I didn't and it it left a mark yes
[1:05:17] scar just a video like that yes to see
[1:05:22] something like that and it left this
[1:05:25] Scar and I I I shook myself and and I
[1:05:28] wasn't mad at the brother and but you
[1:05:31] know I just I was like no nobody should
[1:05:34] see something like that amen yes
[1:05:38] sir I'm sure it has its place in the
[1:05:40] right environment and things like that
[1:05:42] but did it just caught me so off guard
[1:05:45] yes sir and so I I I just I I I just
[1:05:50] told the brother I'm going to have to go
[1:05:52] CU I had to preach the next morning
[1:05:55] and so I went home back to the hotel my
[1:05:58] wife she hadn't seen it my wife she
[1:06:02] quickly was in the arms of Morpheus the
[1:06:05] god of
[1:06:06] Dreams she was gone
[1:06:09] into the land of the
[1:06:12] etheral but I would lay there and
[1:06:15] torment then every time I would close my
[1:06:17] eyes I just seen those men dying my
[1:06:21] brothers
[1:06:23] firefighters they were dying and I
[1:06:25] didn't want to see that I want I wanted
[1:06:27] it erased for my mind
[1:06:29] but it was too late
[1:06:32] right fire had come into my bosom so to
[1:06:36] speak right right my eyes had seen it
[1:06:39] there's it's amazing thing our eyes and
[1:06:43] our mind are photographic that way yes
[1:06:47] sir and so I I I just I I just laid
[1:06:51] there in torment and finally I just got
[1:06:53] up and I went to prayer lay I was just
[1:06:57] kneeling there at the the chair and and
[1:07:01] it was as just a a if you could imagine
[1:07:07] just like a presence like a
[1:07:09] breeze just came in the room and I felt
[1:07:12] a
[1:07:13] peace piece that I couldn't manufacture
[1:07:16] on my own I was in torment up to this
[1:07:19] very moment and this piece dropped down
[1:07:23] and I heard heard these
[1:07:26] words just as plain as anything can man
[1:07:30] take fire in his bosom right has clothes
[1:07:33] not be
[1:07:34] burned and I knew it was in the Bible
[1:07:37] but I didn't know where not too good
[1:07:39] with that with chapter and verse but I
[1:07:41] remembered it being in the Bible so I
[1:07:44] went quickly and looked at my
[1:07:46] concordance and I found the Bible verse
[1:07:49] and I read
[1:07:50] it and as I was reading this Bible verse
[1:07:55] I I I I was on my computer and I I
[1:07:58] clicked on a uh
[1:08:00] commentary and it it it gave me this
[1:08:03] thought that that said that
[1:08:07] fire is
[1:08:10] uh uh it said that the it said it
[1:08:13] actually gave this this example that in
[1:08:17] Africa that they believe or they the
[1:08:21] tribes teach there they're children that
[1:08:25] fire is like an
[1:08:26] animal and that the animal would
[1:08:29] actually consume its victim and then die
[1:08:34] with its victim after it has consumed
[1:08:37] all the wood and that because the fire
[1:08:40] has all these
[1:08:43] characteristics of something that is
[1:08:45] alive right and I read this in the
[1:08:47] commentary I said isn't that
[1:08:51] striking and as I
[1:08:54] read that and I and I thought but it's
[1:08:57] talking about
[1:08:59] adultery and we can equate that
[1:09:03] with sin right yes we can equate that
[1:09:08] with with the enemy of our
[1:09:11] souls and so we realize that it goes
[1:09:14] back to the original sin right goes back
[1:09:17] to and so we begin to speak and think
[1:09:21] that fire is light life like yes but yet
[1:09:26] in order science tells us that there are
[1:09:29] certain
[1:09:30] characteristics that uh uh that that
[1:09:34] something has to have in order to be
[1:09:36] aive right and fire has I think there's
[1:09:41] five characteristics that something has
[1:09:44] to have in order to have life and and
[1:09:47] but fire is lacking in one area it's
[1:09:51] like a virus is not really a life it's
[1:09:54] lacking it requires something it
[1:09:59] requires a host in order to be a life
[1:10:03] and fire is likewise it requires a fuel
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] requires a matter in order to and and it
[1:10:12] attaches itself to that in order to
[1:10:15] become
[1:10:16] lifelike and so we see that sin also
[1:10:21] right that it as it is not life for the
[1:10:23] Bible says that that sin is equated to
[1:10:28] death amen and so now in sin and fire
[1:10:31] now take on this harmonious existence
[1:10:35] yeah right so that you can see one when
[1:10:37] you see the other you can understand the
[1:10:40] effects of of of of sin when you can
[1:10:44] understand the effects of fire right
[1:10:46] right right and
[1:10:48] so it's lifik but yet it is the enemy to
[1:10:53] all life
[1:10:56] right stay with me that here's fire is
[1:11:01] life like yet it is the enemy to All
[1:11:04] Life water in a flood can come through
[1:11:08] and many things will die the deer die
[1:11:12] the squirrels die many things but
[1:11:14] alligators don't die right frogs don't
[1:11:17] die Turtles don't die but the water
[1:11:20] kills all these other things but yet
[1:11:22] these other things they live but fire
[1:11:24] comes everything dies amen trees die
[1:11:27] plants die grass dies animals die people
[1:11:31] die everything dies and so is it when
[1:11:35] sin comes When sin entered into the
[1:11:37] world then death entered into the world
[1:11:40] it was the first thing that entered in
[1:11:43] after sin entered into the Garden of
[1:11:45] Eden when a man took another man's wife
[1:11:49] right right right and now then it left
[1:11:51] this scar on Humanity that every one of
[1:11:54] us bear sir you say we we bear the we
[1:11:58] bear the scar of the original sin right
[1:12:01] yes sir because now we're born of a
[1:12:03] woman right and we all got a belly
[1:12:05] button right it tells us that we're that
[1:12:08] we're under the curse of of sin you see
[1:12:12] and so when Adam took fire into his
[1:12:15] bosom you say did Adam take fire his
[1:12:17] bosom exactly brother tells us that the
[1:12:19] law of God of Moses was in effect even
[1:12:23] all the way back in the Garden of Eden
[1:12:24] right right and so that we realize that
[1:12:27] when they mingled the seeds that the
[1:12:29] woman went out for the protection of her
[1:12:31] husband that he was not to take her back
[1:12:34] right right but he said he went to her
[1:12:36] took her back because he loved her and
[1:12:38] with knowledge plunged the whole earth
[1:12:41] into sin and death right right oh my
[1:12:47] amen so
[1:12:49] now it's
[1:12:51] lifik it's like an animal
[1:12:55] that could consume whatever could catch
[1:12:56] and then died with its
[1:12:59] victim we
[1:13:02] see
[1:13:04] that
[1:13:05] fire doesn't stay in one
[1:13:09] place you start a fire it will spread
[1:13:13] yes sir it'll move out it'll it'll
[1:13:16] attach itself to anything it can
[1:13:19] catch it's lifelike it has a voice
[1:13:24] hisses like a snake right pops and makes
[1:13:29] noise it it it it it has a
[1:13:33] tongue that's right you see that's right
[1:13:36] fire has a
[1:13:37] tongue it it it has it consumes
[1:13:42] things now it it completely consumes
[1:13:47] takes it back to
[1:13:49] its
[1:13:51] carbon particles all the way
[1:13:55] back it it converts whatever it attaches
[1:14:01] itself too it converts it into what it
[1:14:05] is right so when fire attaches itself
[1:14:11] that that eventually it wouldn't just go
[1:14:14] away and leave us a Pulpit here this
[1:14:17] looks like an old Naughty Pine pull
[1:14:20] pit it would get onto this thing and
[1:14:22] burn but when it was done we wouldn't
[1:14:25] have a pull pit anymore
[1:14:27] right we might have a pull pit in a
[1:14:30] million years after it all goes back and
[1:14:32] went back into the seed and come back
[1:14:34] grow us another tree and we cut it down
[1:14:35] make another pull pit out of it who
[1:14:37] would be here to see
[1:14:38] it you see so it consumes and turns it
[1:14:43] into fire itself yes and when it's
[1:14:48] finished what it started is ruined it's
[1:14:52] ruination it's
[1:14:55] destroyed I remember when we were
[1:14:57] fighting fire at Montana it's called the
[1:14:59] foxy
[1:15:01] fire and this this fire we we were just
[1:15:04] doing mop up we weren't actually the
[1:15:07] ones that were jumping into the fire we
[1:15:09] kind of come in from behind the back and
[1:15:13] we did a lot of the mop up you know make
[1:15:15] sure that it didn't start another fire
[1:15:16] somewhere
[1:15:17] else and so the fire had jumped the fire
[1:15:21] lines and had come into another area
[1:15:23] so we all got in the truck and we're
[1:15:26] driving around and we got to the other
[1:15:28] side of the ridge this big canyons and
[1:15:31] mountains red mountainous area bitteroot
[1:15:35] Valley we came around we we saw the fire
[1:15:38] as it was on the other side of the
[1:15:41] mountain and but we can see that it was
[1:15:44] pushing up this smoke and debris was on
[1:15:49] the other side of the mountain and we
[1:15:50] could tell by the way that the fire was
[1:15:53] acting that they it's what they call
[1:15:55] crowned out that it had actually come to
[1:15:59] its its uh Zenith it was as hot as it
[1:16:02] could get and the the fire was actually
[1:16:05] moving they estimated somewhere around
[1:16:08] 20 miles an
[1:16:10] hour and this fire was moving it came
[1:16:13] over the top of the hill we watched it
[1:16:15] as it came over the top of the hill
[1:16:17] there was huge 100 foot pine trees big
[1:16:21] giant virgin
[1:16:23] Pine
[1:16:24] Forest as this fire would run down
[1:16:27] through that Pine Forest those trees
[1:16:30] would explode because they're full of uh
[1:16:34] turpentine they're full of a sap and
[1:16:36] that sap is what makes turpentine or
[1:16:39] paint thinner it's very flammable and so
[1:16:42] that Pine carar would explode inside of
[1:16:44] those trees it would be super heated
[1:16:47] instantly and those trees would explode
[1:16:49] and blow fire and smoke 200 feet over
[1:16:53] the top of the tree canopy it was the
[1:16:55] most amazing wall of fire that you could
[1:16:59] ever imagine moving 20 miles an hour off
[1:17:02] of that mountain we were over a mile
[1:17:04] away and we were having it was like we
[1:17:07] were standing next to a blast
[1:17:09] furnace incredible but it moved off of
[1:17:13] that mountain and in just a minute what
[1:17:15] was a beautiful green beautiful forest
[1:17:18] in a few minutes was Jarred black twigs
[1:17:22] and
[1:17:24] burnt remains nothing left right right
[1:17:28] just in a few minutes yes
[1:17:34] sir brother B tells us a
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:41] story I got several little episodes I'd
[1:17:45] like
[1:17:47] to
[1:17:52] tell
[1:17:55] we find that I I know a man I don't know
[1:17:59] all the
[1:18:01] details how the brother was
[1:18:05] burned but I've known him for many years
[1:18:07] and he he he he carries some very very
[1:18:13] ugly burned scars on his
[1:18:16] body and way up his arms and his legs
[1:18:20] and his hands
[1:18:24] but from what I understood was that he
[1:18:28] was that time he was running from the
[1:18:31] Lord and it was actually an opportunity
[1:18:34] to make some money quick
[1:18:38] money but in order to do it he would
[1:18:41] have to commit a horrible
[1:18:44] crime
[1:18:45] and as he was actually in
[1:18:49] a meeting with some other men
[1:18:53] to make the arrangements to get paid off
[1:18:57] to go and do this
[1:19:00] crime there was a leak on a propane
[1:19:03] bottle out underneath the mobile home
[1:19:05] where they were
[1:19:08] at the furnace kicked in and when the
[1:19:12] pilot light lit and the furnace kicked
[1:19:14] on it ignited all that propane around
[1:19:18] the
[1:19:19] building and he was wearing some uh you
[1:19:23] know just a polyester type shirt and
[1:19:28] trousers that fire instantly ignited his
[1:19:32] clothes and burned them off his body
[1:19:34] just within a second and it put third
[1:19:38] and fourth degree burns over his entire
[1:19:40] body went into his lungs and left him in
[1:19:44] ICU for many days and burnt hands and
[1:19:49] his
[1:19:51] arms
[1:19:53] and to this
[1:19:57] day every time that that brother looks
[1:20:00] and sees those scars on his
[1:20:03] body he
[1:20:06] knew that he got those scars because of
[1:20:10] the crimes that he was about to commit
[1:20:13] right and that it was just a hand of God
[1:20:17] that had laid those scars upon him to
[1:20:21] prevent him from even taken another
[1:20:23] man's life right and God had actually
[1:20:27] protected him but those scars that he
[1:20:32] bore looked like God's judgment upon him
[1:20:35] but they actually were his protection
[1:20:38] right that's true and that later it was
[1:20:41] through this horrible accident that
[1:20:44] actually led to his conversion amen so
[1:20:48] that he could see the scars of his
[1:20:51] Disobedience right that he had taken
[1:20:53] this fire into his bosom this this
[1:20:56] desire to commit a horrible crime but
[1:20:58] yet it left the scar friends and oh let
[1:21:01] me tell you amen when we when we get
[1:21:04] outside of the program of God oh you may
[1:21:07] not come away with horrible burn scars
[1:21:09] that everybody else can see but there'll
[1:21:12] be
[1:21:13] scars there will be a mark that'll be L
[1:21:16] there scars that I bear today because of
[1:21:19] rebellion and things that I did as a
[1:21:22] child and things that my parents did
[1:21:24] they left marks on me yes sir that's
[1:21:28] true as far as I know my mother never
[1:21:32] laid a hand on me in
[1:21:35] anger I got a few switchings in my life
[1:21:39] there were never nothing serious my
[1:21:41] stepfather never hurt me
[1:21:45] physically but both of them left filthy
[1:21:49] pornographic material laying around our
[1:21:52] home as a child until this very hour I
[1:21:55] remember things that I saw when I was
[1:21:57] just a little boy things that I heard my
[1:22:00] mother saying things that I heard my
[1:22:02] mother and father do amen as a child
[1:22:06] that left marks and scars into my spirit
[1:22:09] that I can never erase as long as I live
[1:22:12] yes sir those weren't my Disobedience it
[1:22:15] was theirs right and we find that our
[1:22:18] Disobedience will leave a scar
[1:22:20] somewhere yes it's to leave a scar
[1:22:24] somewhere oh parents leave scars on
[1:22:26] their children husbands leave scars on
[1:22:28] their wives wives leave scars on their
[1:22:31] husbands amen we make scars on our
[1:22:33] brothers pastors leave scars on their
[1:22:35] congregation the congregation leave
[1:22:37] scars on the pastor amen but when it all
[1:22:40] said and done we realized amen that it
[1:22:42] was our Disobedience that left the stars
[1:22:45] in the hands of
[1:22:47] Jesus yes amen he wears the scars of my
[1:22:51] Disobedience Hallelujah
[1:22:53] yes I said oh
[1:22:55] Jesus how is it
[1:22:58] possible
[1:23:01] yes that's true I won't keep us long
[1:23:04] this
[1:23:04] evening but my clock said it's only
[1:23:08] 4:08 so I'll try to I'll try to find the
[1:23:12] right time we haven't started
[1:23:17] yet oh think about it friends where are
[1:23:21] we this evening
[1:23:24] we realize that as fire does these
[1:23:28] things so does sin amen that's true sin
[1:23:33] is the enemy of all life yes sin spreads
[1:23:37] yes right so many times people think
[1:23:40] that they can hide their
[1:23:43] sins the Bible says know you not oh man
[1:23:47] that your sin shall surely find you out
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] Bible says that talks about the
[1:23:56] Disobedience of men that some it comes
[1:23:59] before them and others it comes behind
[1:24:02] right yes
[1:24:03] yes it sin spreads how many times have
[1:24:08] we s that a that a father will will will
[1:24:12] take a casual drink or will be a h you
[1:24:15] know just a maybe just a be a chain
[1:24:19] smoker and and and will whip his boys if
[1:24:23] they
[1:24:24] drink whip his boys if they
[1:24:28] smoke scold them and discipline them
[1:24:31] with everything that all the wrath of a
[1:24:34] father right and yet he's guilty
[1:24:38] himself that never it never stays
[1:24:42] localized right sin never stays
[1:24:45] localized it won't stay localized in a
[1:24:48] in in an individual it'll spread out
[1:24:51] amen that's even sometimes brother ra
[1:24:54] said unconsciously right yes
[1:24:57] sir and
[1:25:00] so it
[1:25:02] consumes sin will just not you know
[1:25:05] affect one little part of the body yes
[1:25:09] you
[1:25:11] know woman that just wants to maybe just
[1:25:15] paint her
[1:25:16] toenails just because maybe she thinks
[1:25:19] it's attractive or whatever it won't won
[1:25:22] be long till she be showing those sh
[1:25:24] those toenails off right right it won't
[1:25:27] be long until it'll move from her
[1:25:29] toenails to her fingernail that's right
[1:25:32] yes after a little while she'll it
[1:25:34] spreads you see it won't just stay there
[1:25:36] and after a little while it'll get over
[1:25:38] on her daughters right right brother
[1:25:40] right but pastor's family has a sin it
[1:25:43] won't be very long till that sin will be
[1:25:45] through the whole church right brother
[1:25:48] right why because sin is not going to
[1:25:51] stay in one place
[1:25:53] it's like fire that's true it
[1:25:57] consumes it'll turn the whole individual
[1:26:00] into that very sin you say oh if I've
[1:26:03] sinned am I am I doomed no amen that's
[1:26:06] why we have firemen right amen they're
[1:26:09] there to put the fire out amen that's
[1:26:12] why we had the gospel amen why the Bible
[1:26:16] types the word of God is water amen amen
[1:26:20] so we can we can always quench the and
[1:26:23] stop the fire before it gets too far by
[1:26:26] by by applying the very word of God that
[1:26:30] area of our life and and and and stop
[1:26:32] that thing Hallelujah was tomorrow will
[1:26:35] be the anniversary of our 911 attack on
[1:26:38] the Twin
[1:26:41] Towers I was there at Ground Zero here a
[1:26:43] while back
[1:26:44] and I I saw that great cavernous
[1:26:48] hole down where they had dug all the way
[1:26:51] down in the bottom to pull all the
[1:26:54] debris and everything out of
[1:26:56] there I remember what the buildings
[1:26:59] looked like and pictures and what
[1:27:01] more and that the fact that they could
[1:27:05] all come crashing down in a moment is
[1:27:08] not
[1:27:09] so I mean it was horrific 3,000 Souls
[1:27:14] lose their
[1:27:16] lives but the part that got me the part
[1:27:19] that just stirred me was when I turned
[1:27:22] and there was a little fire substation
[1:27:25] right there on the corner of ground
[1:27:27] zero and on that substation it showed
[1:27:31] the pictures and had a bronze plaque of
[1:27:35] each one of the men that had given their
[1:27:37] life across the street all
[1:27:40] right and and something in my heart just
[1:27:44] said well what would
[1:27:47] cause a
[1:27:50] man knowing that that building was going
[1:27:53] to come crashing down knowing that there
[1:27:55] was flames and and and and Airplane Fuel
[1:27:59] and dead bodies and all these things
[1:28:02] that were that were falling all
[1:28:06] around what would cause that man to run
[1:28:09] into that
[1:28:10] fire it just came to me because there
[1:28:13] was a bigger fire burning inside of here
[1:28:16] than there was in there it was a bashing
[1:28:19] of fire that was that was kindled in his
[1:28:21] soul to save lives and I began to think
[1:28:24] to myself you know that that's the very
[1:28:26] thing amen that burns in the heart of
[1:28:28] every gospel preacher that he would run
[1:28:31] into the into the Flames of sin that he
[1:28:34] would condemn Satan at every turn even
[1:28:36] though in himself he realized a his
[1:28:39] vulnerability and realized that in
[1:28:41] himself there's many human weaknesses
[1:28:43] but yet he would be able to call out sin
[1:28:45] and preach against a Le souls to
[1:28:49] Christ hallelujah oh my
[1:28:54] it
[1:28:59] destroys I tell a little story about
[1:29:02] a some of this
[1:29:05] is from personal experience and
[1:29:09] so then others from a I think I saw
[1:29:13] something on a on a uh I think it
[1:29:18] was maybe
[1:29:20] a
[1:29:22] Little House on the Prairie something
[1:29:25] like that I it was I think Laura Les
[1:29:28] tells part of the story I think that's
[1:29:30] where I got it a little bit of is but I
[1:29:32] I just it's just a story the names have
[1:29:35] been changed to protect
[1:29:38] the or the
[1:29:41] guilty
[1:29:43] but back in the day in the times of the
[1:29:48] settlers they were coming out to the
[1:29:50] West when they would come into an
[1:29:54] area they wouldn't build them a house
[1:29:56] first first thing they
[1:29:59] did they built a
[1:30:02] barn and then in that Barn they lived in
[1:30:04] that Barn right along with the chickens
[1:30:07] and the cows and the Hogs horses right
[1:30:10] and then they would go and dig them a
[1:30:11] little Dugout and put a roof over it
[1:30:15] then they would go live in The Dugout
[1:30:17] the cows and the chickens and the Hogs
[1:30:20] and the horses would live in this nice
[1:30:21] big barn and seemed logical but that was
[1:30:25] their only way of
[1:30:29] survival and so it
[1:30:32] was It was kind of the centerpiece of
[1:30:35] the of the
[1:30:36] homestead was the
[1:30:39] barn it's where they kept the F for the
[1:30:41] animals it's where they kept their
[1:30:43] canned goods for their for their own
[1:30:46] consumption so they kept their tools
[1:30:48] their animals it protection from the
[1:30:50] harsh winter the summer the
[1:30:53] wind the barn was the most stable
[1:30:57] structure on the build on the on the
[1:30:59] property because it was all their living
[1:31:02] revolved around the barn yes
[1:31:05] yes so there was a little family that
[1:31:09] they had homesteaded they had built a
[1:31:10] nice big barn and they had several cows
[1:31:13] and a couple of nice draft horses
[1:31:16] and implements and they were doing quite
[1:31:18] well for themselves had a nice little
[1:31:19] farm going had some cattle
[1:31:22] they built him a little house and
[1:31:25] everything was going quite
[1:31:27] well the family had one little
[1:31:31] boy and
[1:31:35] the tradition was that when they would
[1:31:38] the end of the week or whenever they
[1:31:42] would load up a wagon and maybe have
[1:31:45] some extra corn that they had harvested
[1:31:47] or maybe they had some potatoes that
[1:31:49] they had dug extra eggs
[1:31:52] maybe some cream whatever that they had
[1:31:55] been able to Surplus they been able to
[1:31:57] gather at the end of the month and they
[1:32:00] would carry that into the little town
[1:32:01] not too
[1:32:02] far and as they would go into the little
[1:32:05] town then there would be some trading
[1:32:07] with go yes it TR the dad would take
[1:32:11] maybe some of his you know things maybe
[1:32:14] he had made some wagon wheels or or he
[1:32:16] had maybe cut a little extra cordwood or
[1:32:20] whatever the case might have been right
[1:32:22] he would go over and he would trade with
[1:32:24] the men the mother she would take maybe
[1:32:27] some canned goods and maybe some
[1:32:30] vegetables that she had took out took
[1:32:32] out of the garden maybe some extra dress
[1:32:35] or something that she had stitched up
[1:32:38] she'd go and trade that and so the women
[1:32:41] would get over here they would do their
[1:32:43] trading men would get over here and they
[1:32:45] do their
[1:32:48] trading and so after all the trading was
[1:32:51] done and
[1:32:52] dad had bought all of his goods and
[1:32:54] loaded up his wagon and he had his flour
[1:32:56] and his feed and his coffee and his
[1:32:58] sugar and maybe extra seed and extra ax

[1:33:41] so then and then mother you know she'd
[1:33:43] go over with the women they'd all sit
[1:33:45] around maybe they'd be stitching on a
[1:33:46] quilt or something and they'd get to
[1:33:47] cackle in like a bunch of chickens it's
[1:33:50] what hens do you know they just
[1:33:53] C can't ever shut them
[1:33:55] up they just go and go but then you know
[1:33:58] the men they all get over there you know
[1:34:00] what they do they
[1:34:02] Crow the men they get over there and
[1:34:04] they Crow what they're doing they're
[1:34:06] bragging and you know maybe dad you got
[1:34:09] he they got over there they pass the old
[1:34:11] jug around a few times maybe one old man

[1:34:16] smoke his pipe and another roll him a
[1:34:19] cigarette and have him a cigar other
[1:34:21] pulling a big plug of the backer off and
[1:34:23] there was a chewing and a smoking and a
[1:34:26] spitting well you can't get a bunch of
[1:34:28] men like that together very long before
[1:34:30] they go to cussing and then they go to
[1:34:31] lying right right they go to telling
[1:34:34] tall tales and all these little things
[1:34:36] and what was going on the whole time was
[1:34:39] that little boy
[1:34:40] sitting
[1:34:44] right and he was hearing all the things
[1:34:47] that they were saying learning all those
[1:34:51] new words words right right learning all
[1:34:54] that new behavior and after a little
[1:34:55] while he got that licorice in the back

[1:34:58] jaw yeah chewing on that black liquor
[1:35:02] and when he had spit it looked like
[1:35:03] tobacker
[1:35:04] juice so he had spitting and he was s
[1:35:07] around there listen at them men
[1:35:10] grow after a little while Dad load up in
[1:35:13] the wagon it all go back to the farm
[1:35:17] right well after a little while you know
[1:35:20] little boy he
[1:35:22] gets a
[1:35:23] thinking up there in the barn and get
[1:35:25] back in the Loft kick the hay out that
[1:35:29] there was this little little they
[1:35:32] got video games
[1:35:35] now back then little boys had to use her
[1:35:38] imagination so he got up there and he
[1:35:40] got to talking and he got him some stick
[1:35:43] pistols and he got him a gunfight up
[1:35:45] there and he had to battle at the h k
[1:35:47] Corral and Oh my he was riding and
[1:35:50] fighting engin and everything else and
[1:35:52] he was a he got there wrestling with the
[1:35:54] dog and you know and he was a fighting
[1:35:57] and everything and he was a fighting a
[1:35:58] big old Grizzly bar and you know he was
[1:36:01] having him a a
[1:36:02] Time little
[1:36:04] imagination and he got him a big old
[1:36:07] piece of hey there big piece of straw
[1:36:09] and he put it in his mouth
[1:36:11] and got to thinking hey if I let this on
[1:36:17] fire and so he went into the house and
[1:36:19] he stole some of his money his
[1:36:22] matches went out there and he struck a
[1:36:24] match and LD it on that piece of
[1:36:28] straw he could pull on that straw and
[1:36:30] he' get a little smoke come out of his
[1:36:33] nose then all of a sudden mama called
[1:36:35] him and so he put that little thing on
[1:36:37] he hit it and he covered up his sin
[1:36:40] right and he went back in the
[1:36:42] house boy he really got away with
[1:36:48] that well the next day he got up there
[1:36:50] and he thought hey I'm going to go do
[1:36:51] that
[1:36:52] again and the next day he went did it
[1:36:55] again but one day little tiny little
[1:37:01] spark fell down in the boards of that
[1:37:04] old attic that old barn down in that
[1:37:07] fine dust that fine dust is very very
[1:37:12] flammable and he didn't realize it and
[1:37:14] so he kicked The Hil over everything he
[1:37:16] hit a sin for one more time thinking
[1:37:18] I'll get away with it again and he runs
[1:37:21] to the house to eat his supper and
[1:37:24] before he could get to the house he see
[1:37:26] smoke coming out of the top of the
[1:37:29] bar and it was out in the west and it's
[1:37:32] real dry and the wind was
[1:37:34] blowing and just in a few seconds what
[1:37:37] had started out as the most
[1:37:39] insignificant little spark right had
[1:37:43] fallen down and had turned into a raging
[1:37:46] Inferno and the whole Barn was engulfed
[1:37:50] and it burn burnt the bar it burnt the
[1:37:52] chickens it burnt the Hogs it burnt the
[1:37:55] milk cow it burnt the horse it burnt the
[1:37:58] wagon it burn everything right sir
[1:38:01] everything that they had worked for it
[1:38:04] had burned it to the ground sir they
[1:38:08] lost everything because there wasn't no
[1:38:10] fire trucks in those days come to the
[1:38:12] res
[1:38:14] right and so you fire sin that little
[1:38:19] sin yes
[1:38:23] it had
[1:38:25] destroyed the family yes sir so you
[1:38:29] would
[1:38:31] think that bad little
[1:38:36] boy an
[1:38:38] evil
[1:38:40] Wicked little
[1:38:43] child he should be
[1:38:45] beat should be run out of the
[1:38:49] family but you would say
[1:38:52] why didn't they do that to him because
[1:38:54] it
[1:38:55] wasn't his fault right he was only the
[1:39:00] the real
[1:39:02] criminal was the
[1:39:04] daddy that taught him how to do those
[1:39:08] things you see so the sin started with
[1:39:11] the dad and it bled over into the to the
[1:39:15] son and then that fled over to the
[1:39:17] mother until the whole family was
[1:39:20] consumed by the just one little yes say
[1:39:24] oh
[1:39:25] my what what do we do we we got to call
[1:39:29] upon God we got to pray that the Lord
[1:39:32] will cleanse us of every spot of every
[1:39:35] sin of every transgression no matter how
[1:39:39] small or how great amen we all need the
[1:39:42] blood of Jesus
[1:39:46] Amen and not all there's no hope for us
[1:39:52] they just this is just a just an
[1:39:54] unending cycle of sin and and death and
[1:39:59] sin and death and sin and death and and
[1:40:02] it just always there that fire of Satan
[1:40:06] is always there he's always starting
[1:40:08] these fires right
[1:40:11] yes I got to
[1:40:14] thinking one time I got a
[1:40:18] story it's up in yellow
[1:40:21] St national forest and there was a
[1:40:24] lightning
[1:40:26] strike and it caught
[1:40:30] um started a force
[1:40:32] fire well it was on the east side of the
[1:40:37] mountain and the fire was coming down
[1:40:39] off the
[1:40:41] mountain and they didn't know what to do
[1:40:44] and they called in a
[1:40:46] professional a fire uh expert
[1:40:51] and they
[1:40:52] said you know what are we going to do to
[1:40:55] stop this fire and he goes we've got to
[1:40:57] cut a fire
[1:40:59] line they said well how will we do that
[1:41:02] he said you've got to get in here with
[1:41:04] some big
[1:41:05] equipment he said you got to cut this a
[1:41:08] path across this mountain right here in
[1:41:10] front of that fire you've got to stop it
[1:41:12] the only way to stop it is a fire line
[1:41:13] you've got to go in there and before the
[1:41:15] Fire gets there you got to cut out all
[1:41:17] this Timber you got to you got to cut it
[1:41:19] down with bulldozers so the only thing
[1:41:21] you can
[1:41:22] do and so they called in the man to help
[1:41:26] him and then they said but we can't do
[1:41:30] that it'll mess up the
[1:41:34] ecology the environment right right
[1:41:37] we'll be destroyed if we do
[1:41:40] that he said then why did you call me in
[1:41:43] here for you wanted didn't know how to
[1:41:45] fix it I told you how to fix it now you
[1:41:47] don't want to fix it so deal with it
[1:41:50] yourself
[1:41:52] he got in his car and drove away
[1:41:57] right after a little while they called
[1:42:00] him
[1:42:01] back they said it's too late you got to
[1:42:04] come and help us you got to you got to
[1:42:06] help us to he said it's too late now
[1:42:08] right it had done burn everything he
[1:42:11] told him to cut out of there it had
[1:42:12] already burned that it had come down and
[1:42:14] got all the way down into the little
[1:42:16] town and burnt the whole town down
[1:42:19] right he said now you can have saved all
[1:42:21] this if you would have dealt with it
[1:42:22] back here what I'm saying is many times
[1:42:25] amen what what we got to do is we got to
[1:42:28] deal with it before it gets to that amen
[1:42:31] we've got to deal with it and so we find
[1:42:35] I believe that in order for him to
[1:42:37] actually stop the fire what they had to
[1:42:39] do is to build another fire Amen to to
[1:42:42] burn out this whole section of woods
[1:42:45] they had the only way they could stop it
[1:42:46] was to build another
[1:42:48] fire and so sometimes you got to fight
[1:42:50] fire with fire right right I got to
[1:42:53] thinking about that I said Lord Satan
[1:42:56] comes and these little sins and these
[1:42:58] trespasses and these little foxes and
[1:43:00] these little things that they're always
[1:43:02] coming into our lives and attacking us
[1:43:04] and sicknesses and diseases and and and
[1:43:07] and little complexes and and mind
[1:43:10] battles and and afflictions and and and
[1:43:13] diers and all these things that have
[1:43:15] come against us that are wicked and of
[1:43:16] the devil I just don't know how to deal
[1:43:19] with it all and then the Lord began to
[1:43:21] reveal to
[1:43:24] me that this
[1:43:26] fire that started back in Genesis
[1:43:31] yeah that brother baham tells us that
[1:43:35] sin is
[1:43:36] righteousness
[1:43:38] perverted right I thought oh my so now
[1:43:43] then these things that were that Satan
[1:43:45] was taking this right
[1:43:47] out and he had perverted it because a
[1:43:50] Tre is a right act
[1:43:53] perverted what is a lie but truth
[1:43:56] perverted right what is what is sin but
[1:44:00] it's righteousness
[1:44:02] perverted so we find then that that is
[1:44:05] this is this perversion if if if sin is
[1:44:08] like a fire but it's a perversion then
[1:44:11] there had to be a
[1:44:12] real there had to be a real and the
[1:44:16] Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews he
[1:44:18] said because God is a consuming
[1:44:22] fire that there had to be a righteous
[1:44:25] Fire there had to be a holy fire there
[1:44:28] had to be a fire that came from God Amen
[1:44:30] when those priests offered on the altar
[1:44:33] a strange
[1:44:35] fire god slew them for that but there
[1:44:38] was a right way to do that amen if they
[1:44:41] went and got the fire that God had
[1:44:43] started God would have receive their
[1:44:45] sacrifice right amen oh
[1:44:48] Hallelujah that's true and so then we
[1:44:51] find that John the Baptist he comes one
[1:44:54] day and he said there's one standing
[1:44:55] Among Us Now who shoes I'm not even
[1:44:59] worthy to un loose right yes he said I
[1:45:03] indeed baptize you with water but he
[1:45:06] that cometh after me he will baptize you
[1:45:09] with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:45:15] amen so then we think about now this
[1:45:18] righteous Fire what is been able to
[1:45:22] do we we we find that that the scars of
[1:45:27] Disobedience that they leave a
[1:45:31] mark but we find that the fire of God
[1:45:35] yes sir it leaves a seal thank you Lord
[1:45:38] amen amen oh it seals you yes amen think
[1:45:43] about it when when Noah needed to seal
[1:45:47] the ark he had to put fire Amen to the
[1:45:51] pitch and get the pitch fire under your
[1:45:54] fire to get it hot in order to seal the
[1:45:58] ark Amen in order for you to receive a
[1:46:01] seal so that Satan amen is sealed
[1:46:05] out amen it takes a fire of the Holy
[1:46:08] Ghost upon your soul Amen to seal God in
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:14] hallelujah so we find that as Sin
[1:46:17] spreads so does the Holy Ghost spread
[1:46:21] amen but said that the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:24] the devil they can't sleep in the same
[1:46:27] bed hallelujah oh what is it when a man
[1:46:31] gets saved and full of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:33] then what does he do it it begins to
[1:46:35] bleed over and his children see a
[1:46:39] difference said the legion was so full
[1:46:42] of the devil he said when he was
[1:46:43] delivered he wanted to go with Jesus
[1:46:45] Jesus said no go back home and teach
[1:46:48] your children right hallelujah oh why
[1:46:52] because now it was a fire was burning in
[1:46:55] his soul that he can go back and he
[1:46:57] could take that fire back to his
[1:46:59] children back to his home back to his
[1:47:02] wife back to the T he can show the whole
[1:47:05] T they want to get rid of him they want
[1:47:07] to get rid of Jesus they wanted the
[1:47:09] demons and they wanted their Pig right
[1:47:12] right amen right oh
[1:47:15] my hallelujah oh can you take this fire
[1:47:20] into your
[1:47:21] bosom
[1:47:24] not seal it'll even it'll even signature
[1:47:29] upon your soul amen you can't come into
[1:47:32] the presence of God Amen and leave amen
[1:47:35] the same way
[1:47:37] you ohy to God it
[1:47:41] consumes start out it started out like a
[1:47:44] little button right he said but after a
[1:47:47] while it was like the foxy fire amen it
[1:47:50] comes rolling out and burning and
[1:47:53] consuming amen until the whole man has
[1:47:56] been consumed
[1:47:57] amen it
[1:48:00] converts amen oh man every gets full of
[1:48:04] the Holy Ghost it converts him it
[1:48:07] changes him yes it changes it begins to
[1:48:10] change everything around him he's able
[1:48:12] to create an
[1:48:14] atmosphere man said our faith can speak
[1:48:17] a world into existence and we can go and
[1:48:20] live in it right we are amateur creators
[1:48:24] we create amen our own atmosphere amen
[1:48:27] when we consume everything around us
[1:48:30] that fire that's in our soul it turns
[1:48:33] everything around us into fire
[1:48:37] hallelujah oh praise
[1:48:40] God that fire destroys yes sir amen
[1:48:45] because I'm fighting fire with fire amen
[1:48:48] I'm fighting Satan's perverted fire
[1:48:50] that's come against my soul to destroy
[1:48:52] me to take me down the only thing I can
[1:48:55] do Amen brother said what can turn a
[1:48:57] storm it's a greater storm oh I've got
[1:49:00] to build a bigger fire Amen on the
[1:49:03] inside of my soul by feeding at the word
[1:49:05] of
[1:49:09] God what is it that gasoline is flamable
[1:49:13] flamable without a spark he it's just
[1:49:16] dead mechanics oh if I can ever get the
[1:49:19] gasoline of the holy spirit amen to

[1:49:25] spirit amen the two mechanics become the
[1:49:29] Dynamics oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:33] they'll destroy every trace of sin
[1:49:36] everything that comes against me

[1:49:40] takes care of it because it kills
[1:49:43] everything destroys everything that's
[1:49:46] unlike it amen Amen brother man said of

[1:56:47] my glory
[1:56:50] firefighters we thank you we learn learn
[1:56:53] a term it's called levels of
[1:56:56] involvement levels of involvement is
[1:56:59] what tell the
[1:57:01] firefighter what they have to expect
[1:57:04] when they pull up on
[1:57:06] location so one day we got a call and
[1:57:10] way up in the mountains and our old
[1:57:11] truck wasn't that good we're wi and
[1:57:13] around up through the mountains we can
[1:57:14] see the fire we're doing our very best
[1:57:17] to get to it and when we finally the
[1:57:19] First Responders were there and they're
[1:57:22] telling us we have a structure fire that
[1:57:26] is fully
[1:57:28] involved and we're thinking oh my how
[1:57:31] terrible is this and we pull into the
[1:57:33] little town it's called Golden New
[1:57:35] Mexico and we pulled into the little
[1:57:37] town and there's just a humble bunch of
[1:57:39] people there there's not very many
[1:57:41] people I know 50 60 people in the whole
[1:57:43] town and one of the main buildings it
[1:57:47] was the old uh they called it golden
[1:57:49] because there was old mining town it was
[1:57:52] actually the home of the man that owned
[1:57:54] the mine the mine had closed down all
[1:57:58] 100 years ago
[1:58:00] probably they had taken that old house
[1:58:02] old wood frame house they turned it into
[1:58:05] an antique
[1:58:06] store and the place was on fire we
[1:58:09] pulled up on location we couldn't even
[1:58:11] get close to the place there was fire
[1:58:13] coming out the gables it was coming out
[1:58:15] from under the floorboards there was
[1:58:17] fire out every windows out the front
[1:58:20] door of the building pour there was
[1:58:22] glass bottles that were down the
[1:58:24] driveway that were melting and bending
[1:58:27] over it just so hot we couldn't get
[1:58:29] anywhere near close to it so all we
[1:58:32] could do is just take our hoses and kind
[1:58:34] of spray the buildings on both sides of
[1:58:36] it and just let her go there's nothing
[1:58:38] we could do about it and so all we can
[1:58:41] do is just sit down and on the back of
[1:58:43] our truck and some of the neighbors they
[1:58:45] brought us it was kind of a cold winter
[1:58:47] they brought us hot cocoa
[1:58:50] and we sat down
[1:58:51] there all we could do is watch it burn
[1:58:54] because it was fully
[1:58:57] involved come on now and I thought to
[1:59:01] myself you know one day when Moses went
[1:59:04] up into the into the mountain he said I
[1:59:06] got to see this great sight a bush that
[1:59:09] burns yet it is not
[1:59:11] consumed and Moses got so close to that
[1:59:14] burning bush that that fire that was
[1:59:17] inside of that burning
[1:59:20] that it got over inside of Moses and
[1:59:23] Moses became fully involved in so much
[1:59:27] that he became a on man invasion in
[1:59:30] reports he was a weapon of mass
[1:59:32] destruction Hallelujah he was going down
[1:59:35] to take over Egypt and him and his wife
[1:59:39] his little bo amen
[1:59:41] and
[1:59:44] and oh think about it he was fully
[1:59:47] involved and he said who will I tell
[1:59:50] them that that sent me down here to do
[1:59:53] this and the voice from the
[1:59:56] tree he said you tell
[1:59:58] them that he is that he is right amen
[2:00:03] yes that Ain what he said was
[2:00:05] it right he said you tell him that he

[2:00:19] was that there fire that was on the
[2:00:22] inside that bush when it got on the
[2:00:25] inside of Moses that Moses now St as the
[2:00:29] spoke hall because he became the very
[2:00:32] voice of the
[2:00:34] third you heard the voice of the first
[2:00:36] two signs that the Bible says that they
[2:00:38] do not hear the voice of the second sign
[2:00:40] they will hear the voice of the third
[2:00:42] sign and Moses was the voice of the
[2:00:45] third son it was the destruction that
[2:00:47] would come upon the people if they
[2:00:49] didn't hear the voice of the first two
[2:00:51] sons amen what has come upon the Earth
[2:00:53] in the last days but it was the voice
[2:00:56] that was in the pillar of fire showed
[2:00:58] itself in Houston Coliseum and that
[2:01:01] identified Malachi 4 and Revelations
[2:01:04] 10:7 amen if you want to know who sent

[2:06:09] time man I just loved her to death she a
[2:06:13] sweetheart my wife was jealous of
[2:06:17] him I went running into the house of the
[2:06:21] truck the wife come running out of the
[2:06:22] house with a glass of tea in her hand
[2:06:23] this ain't no lie this really
[2:06:25] happen the dog beat her to me and I
[2:06:29] knelt down and hugged the dog and she
[2:06:32] kissed me big old sloppy lick all side
[2:06:34] my face I wi you do she gave me the tea
[2:06:39] in
[2:06:41] the she was glad when the dog
[2:06:45] died oh but I I had that old
[2:06:49] dog and I trained her for search and
[2:06:52] rescue and so in order to train the dog
[2:06:54] for search and rescue I had to be
[2:06:55] trained for search and rescue and so
[2:06:57] there were certain things that we had to
[2:06:59] learn in order to be a rescue Personnel
[2:07:03] that when somebody's lost out there
[2:07:04] they're in a panic and you're using your
[2:07:06] animal to try to locate these lost
[2:07:08] people sometimes they're just little
[2:07:09] children and so you're searching through
[2:07:11] the woods and you get out there and
[2:07:13] sometimes you're way into the night and
[2:07:14] you're just following the dog you don't
[2:07:15] know where you are and you're just
[2:07:16] following
[2:07:17] flashlight and sometimes you get out
[2:07:19] there and get lost
[2:07:20] yourself because it's in the night you
[2:07:22] can't see nothing it's cloudy or
[2:07:24] whatever maybe it's in a blizzard and
[2:07:26] you're out there looking and so then you
[2:07:27] have to go fully equipped you can't just
[2:07:30] go run off into the woods and your shirt
[2:07:32] sleeves but you have there's a certain
[2:07:35] equipment that you have to carry with
[2:07:36] you that's got food for yourself and for
[2:07:39] the victim if you were to find
[2:07:41] it imagine that there's there there's
[2:07:45] you have Compass you have GPS you have
[2:07:48] uh you have a a blanket you know a
[2:07:52] survival blanket that can wrap around
[2:07:54] you you have H these little chemical
[2:07:57] hand and feet warmers because sometimes
[2:08:00] people are freezing they know they got
[2:08:01] to have somebody to keep them from
[2:08:02] getting Frost by there's all this
[2:08:04] equipment that has to come with you but
[2:08:05] there's one thing that was the most
[2:08:07] important part of your pack and that was
[2:08:09] Fire Starting
[2:08:11] equipment that you had to have
[2:08:14] something that that was tender you had
[2:08:17] to have something you had have magnesium
[2:08:19] Strikers you had to have big lighters
[2:08:21] you had to have farmer matches you had
[2:08:22] to have all these different kinds of
[2:08:26] Fire Starting equipment had to be in
[2:08:29] your pack at all
[2:08:31] times because rule number one is that
[2:08:35] when you found the victim or if you got
[2:08:37] lost
[2:08:39] yourself you just got you and your dog
[2:08:42] and you're out there in the middle of
[2:08:43] nowhere and you don't know where that
[2:08:44] dog has led you cuz you're not paying
[2:08:45] any attention you're following that
[2:08:47] dog's nose he's looking for the victim
[2:08:49] right and so you get out there and maybe
[2:08:51] maybe the dog loses the trail or maybe
[2:08:53] it gets cold or whatever and you can't
[2:08:55] go nowhere maybe you get
[2:08:56] injured and so then they they tell you
[2:08:59] that the first thing that you have to do
[2:09:00] is prepare some sort of
[2:09:03] shelter build a fire and stay still
[2:09:07] don't don't move around find
[2:09:10] stop build a fire bu the
[2:09:14] Shel that's the rules when you're lost
[2:09:18] wow
[2:09:19] that'll
[2:09:21] preach if you realize that you're lost
[2:09:24] friend sir just stop yes sir turn around
[2:09:29] repent get down on your knees pray build
[2:09:33] a fire amen call God tell him know you
[2:09:38] know that he's met with you otherwise
[2:09:40] you're freak death right hypothermia you
[2:09:44] don't have to be below freezing to die
[2:09:46] to freeze to death needs to be 55 de and
[2:09:48] you will die of hypothermia amen 55
[2:09:51] degrees you said well that's not too
[2:09:53] cold it's not too cold when you're
[2:09:55] healthy right but when you're dehydrated
[2:09:58] and you've run out of all your calories
[2:10:00] and you have no no fuel inside of you to
[2:10:02] build enough fire am to keep you warm
[2:10:04] when that all depletes friends 55
[2:10:06] degrees you will freeze to death you
[2:10:07] will go to sleep and
[2:10:09] die amen oh let me tell you and that's a
[2:10:12] lot where a lot of churches are today
[2:10:14] brother said they're they're 40 below
[2:10:17] zero right right amen spiritually 40
[2:10:20] below zero oh my let me tell you amen
[2:10:23] sometimes we could be in a church that's
[2:10:25] that's on fire for God but we ourself
[2:10:28] because me we have allowed Satan to put
[2:10:31] the fire out by throwing wet blankets on
[2:10:33] us and wet blankets on and has stopped
[2:10:35] the mo of God in our Liv so many times
[2:10:37] till now our spiritual thermometer has
[2:10:40] dropped down below zero and we're dying
[2:10:43] spiritually sitting right on the Pew of
[2:10:45] a Holy Ghost Field church right right
[2:10:48] and you say oh God what will I do
[2:10:53] well there's a way to build a fire now
[2:10:56] you don't just go gather up a bunch of
[2:10:58] wood strike a match and throw it down on
[2:11:02] there that won't start a fire right
[2:11:05] right that will just put your match out
[2:11:07] and that's what a lot of people do is
[2:11:09] they come in the back door they come
[2:11:11] into church they got all this Tinder
[2:11:13] laying around here they strike up their
[2:11:15] little match Hallelujah bless the Lord
[2:11:17] throw it on there W nothing happened
[2:11:21] today and they do that over and over
[2:11:23] till they finally they just what's a use
[2:11:25] mat and they just sat there and freeze
[2:11:27] the death right right right in church
[2:11:30] right because they're lost Bible said if
[2:11:33] our gospel be hid it is hid from them
[2:11:36] that are lost right right so we find

[2:35:17] Jesus praise God another thought there
[2:35:20] that come to my mind I just want to
[2:35:21] share really struck
[2:35:24] me when you see little sin in somebody's
[2:35:26] life let's try to stop it before it gets
[2:35:29] big yeah I thought for the home Church
[2:35:32] especially as me as a pastor sometimes I
[2:35:33] see little things come up I really need
[2:35:35] to I need God to help me with that
[2:35:37] praise the Lord I think every Pastor
[2:35:39] would right but think about you and your
[2:35:40] families and children and your loved
[2:35:42] ones and when you see a little sin come
[2:35:44] up let's ask God to help us to take care
[2:35:47] God's
[2:35:48] gra to avoid as much damage as possible
[2:35:53] absolutely let's just pray over that we
[2:35:55] won't close yet but let's just say
[2:35:57] prayer that God would help us to we see
[2:35:59] that damage going on that we would stop
[2:36:01] it you're remind me of scripture about
[2:36:02] the little leav leav at the whole lump
[2:36:05] remind me of that fire having the same
[2:36:07] effects as leav perverted fire we say
[2:36:10] heavenly father Lord that so struck me
[2:36:12] Lord that tonight as a pastor Lord I
[2:36:15] hear every service Lord I see the people
[2:36:17] in and out Lord trying to keep my life
[2:36:19] pure before you imagine every Pastor is
[2:36:21] like this lord they're just a shepher
[2:36:24] they look at the sheep and they love the
[2:36:25] sheep and they care so much but Lord as
[2:36:29] Pro the prophet said when they start to
[2:36:30] wander away Lord uh it's hard for the
[2:36:33] shepherd we know Lord that brother Bram
[2:36:36] like it unto you Lord how you break a
[2:36:38] leg and you bring that land back lord uh
[2:36:41] put them right on your shoulder maybe
[2:36:43] carry them right in your bosom and and
[2:36:44] feed them closer Lord and sometimes Lord
[2:36:47] we see that we see uh ones we love
[2:36:51] family members people in the church Lord
[2:36:53] friends we see them get a little bit of
[2:36:56] sin God help us Lord help us to go as
[2:37:00] Galatians 61 said go in the spirit of
[2:37:02] meekness and restore such a one who's
[2:37:04] overtaken in The Fault Lord God to try
