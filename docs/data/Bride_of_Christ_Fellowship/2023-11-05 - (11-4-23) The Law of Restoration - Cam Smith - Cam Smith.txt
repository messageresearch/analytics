TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for uh I'll tell you what uh we sure really just put the house of Hell at Bay didn't we we told the house of Hell to giveway and uh by God's grace uh we we see how God's love uh just how it just moves mightily on his children I trust you can say this morning I ain't tired yet I'm not tired yet that's right amen it's good to see brother Austin sister Lena married now praise the Lord amen yeah we rejoice and uh uh we're rejoicing of what the Lord's doing here uh you know you come and visit and you just uh uh hear the wonderful worship the wonderful love for God the wonderful love for the hearing of the word hey look at that praise the Living God I'm very excited now amen all right uh you do a lot of work making a PowerPoint it's good to get it to the people and uh that our work was not in vain and uh this morning uh we just like to say once again we just uh we love every single one of you uh you're very precious people I I really believe with all of my heart uh that we're we're not called to be in the general Resurrection we're called to be in the first resurrection together and I believe that that's what the Lord is doing here he's uh raising his children up in Revelation and understanding I must have preached long last night because they're working on that clock right [Laughter] now so we'll try to be mindful of your time today and uh but yet I I want to uh uh the Lord just kind of impressed another thought on my heart uh today for you and you know how I am I uh that's hearing me preach I I love to tie everything in with the word of God Amen and I what I love about it is that uh you know brother the brandom hit highlights and he and he brought things into a spot where uh he basically showed us what God wanted to do um and ultimately the plan of it but when you actually dive into the scripture you actually see it's Fuller and richer uh than the Highlight he brought it's actually he hit exactly what it was but when we get in the Bible we find that this is actually more than what I thought it was before and uh today we're going to work with that type of idea and uh via a very simple sermon I'm going to approach this in two ideas as far as um one to the church uh to the bride and then I'm going to go to the individual uh and then uh by the Lord's help uh uh this is just something uh that the Lord really blessed me with and uh I know he's blessed our church at home with this idea last night was a something uh he gave me on the way over here I hadn't preached at anywhere but uh uh today uh we're going to just kind of put some things together for you and we trust uh uh if you ain't tired yet just uh just rejoice in the holy spirit being here uh re rejoice in his word to you and uh I'll tell you what if if we can start building that atmosphere of Faith uh then God can really really do a mighty work today I don't know about you I'm not satisfied with with yesterday or last week's experience amen uh brother brandom said he said we should never be comfortable with W with an experience in the past that's he said we can't be satisfied you that you receed the Holy Ghost 10 years ago and just move on from there we need God to constantly just pour His Spirit out on us and we're coming to that just like we showed last night it's getting smaller but the power is growing amen hallelujah so if you have your Bibles uh exus 20:2 might be a little bit of a strange uh uh on my computer I have everything in highlights and underlines but when I put it on here it doesn't have any of that uh so I'll just try to emphasize it myself uh here it is what looks like the Ten Commandments now don't it uh I want you to see this uh uh I'm going to focus right here in Exodus 2015 Thou shalt not steal okay and uh we'll follow this idea today um Exodus 20:12 says honor thy father and thy mother uh that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adultery and uh we'll focus right here on the 15th verse it says Thou shalt not steal all right I ain't calling anybody thieves here today but I know there is a great Thief it's the devil Hallelujah now watch this is God's righteousness coming out Thou shalt not steal well I wonder if there is a thief then what will God do to recompense that which was stolen we're going to follow this idea today I trust that you'll be blessed uh Joel 1 verse4 we hear a lot about restoration and uh today I'm going to bring this in a little bit of a different way for you because uh what I find out is you know brother brandom hit restoration but this actually goes all over the place and uh I want to build your expectation for something okay we'll get to this after a little bit here but like I said I'm going to start with the seven Church AG uh move that in on into the even uh your church uh and and this is one of the things God was working with me I'm like cuz you can actually see the condition of your church by tying it in with restoration and when I say that that's that's the message the restoration of the Bride tree so you'll be able to tell you'll see exactly where you're at as a body amen is that possible yes sir do we do we just aimlessly walk around in any certain direction or or did God give us enough understanding to be able to identify where we're at okay so you can see already I'm taking a little bit different route but you know I'm going to get excited I can't help myself quicker you get the you you you pull on the word and and get that anointing Brewing the worships already done it now you just keep on with that worship towards God right Joel 1 verse4 says that which the palor hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust left hath the can cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten all right uh you know there's two places that this is brought in it's brought in here in Joel one and then it's also expressed in Joel 2:25 but brother brand actually made it all when he preached restoration of the brid tree he actually worked with it in this order they're in different orders okay so let's bow our heads for a word of prayer and we'll get right to where the Lord has led us this morning Lord Jesus we we humbly come before you right now Lord and uh it's a great hour to live and to know Lord that that and as I'm looking at this what I am seeing Oh God is I am seeing oh God the pattern that that the followers that followed the message and what they have done they've actually allowed things to be scattered instead of just following the message in the messenger they've placed their own human ideas into things and Lord we realize that Lord we're in an hour where your word just as brother Brandon ministered it is just as applicable today as it was when he was here that means we can expect you to do the same things Lord uh the same things that you did in that Ministry you can do here Lord uh and yet Lord even within all those highlights sewn God it was your desire to show us the way back lord uh to what the acts church had Lord because that was a body in full demonstration of your power and might to a generation that was UNT the scripture says so Lord we're just asking this morning that you uh just anoint the words to be spoken Lord and and Lord I I always say it like this I I believe and I and I feel like you're leading me this way oh God but Lord uh I want to be free to be able to go wherever you want me Lord Lord so I'm asking today oh God that you'd move me however thou willst Lord I am I am just clay You Are The Potter Lord just like these people here Lord these great saints of God lord they are just clay and You Are The Potter Lord so form us into the image of Thy word oh God make us so we could be vessels constantly filled with your spirit filled up oh God so that we can be put in service for you in the name of Jesus Christ the church says together amen you may be seated I like this guy's face Amen in a way it kind of almost looks like Malachi without glasses but today we're going to uh work with this idea um the law of restoration okay and uh we want to focus today on the restored and uh we're going to bring this in a direction uh that I want to build your expectation uh in what you perceive that God wants to do for you all right uh a lot of times we we place ourselves at uh that we say oh God I just would really just like for you know something to be restored I'd like to have that back um but the scripture actually paints a very powerful uh image before us uh so what we're going to do is we're going to tie in all these things and uh working with the law of restoration uh this Mo this afternoon we want to start just by defining it um to restore is to return to a person uh as a specific thing uh which he has lost all right so in order to receive restoration you have to realize that something has been taken away amen I don't know about what you expect your church to be like amen but uh if you can see what the words said about the acts church that is actually what God made you to be amen he made you to be filled with power amen filled with demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah in such a way that the gifts of the Spirit would be working through here just like they were in brother Brandon Ministry amen hallelujah I'd love to preach it but uh you realize there is a thus sayith the Lord that is to move through this Ley amen when brother brandham talked about the the the the the local body coming under the gifts of the Spirit he said they would work exactly like his gift that's right that tongues would come forth Amen on somebody and then another person would what interpret it and they' Sally Jones there's going to be a hurricane that's going to come through you stay away from it and go a different direction it would be the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart and it would make you bypass things amen it would make you avoid unnecessary Temptations and trials that was the Holy Ghost working in the original Church and I tell you if you don't see it today what do you need you need to be restored do you see what's yours God made it your right by his Holy Ghost and you're yielding to it that you would see this gospel in full effect as it's ever [Music] been so now you see what you are supposed to manifest what you're supposed to make known you're supposed to make it known to one another you're supposed to make it known to anybody that ever comes in here or whether you're out and about you are called to make known Jesus Christ the same Jesus Christ to the world Amen now watch this let's begin in Joel 2:25 this is a very powerful thing which we in the message have a true understanding of which is so beautiful it says and I will restore to you you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you God claims it as what his army and what he sent it to them don't you hey brother sister don't get it wrong amen God in the Book of Job he let Satan have job because because he wanted to show just as he did Death burial and Resurrection it's always God's move to take away so that he can restore amen at the end we're going to get to how much Hallelujah but I want you to see this because he said he would restore what he allowed to happen amen amen yes now watch your this paints a very beautiful picture in the church age book it says now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the Wesleyan age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word amen amen hallelujah so if you have not seen the original acts Church in expression that tells you right there that the restoration hasn't fully come yet yes and if you identify yourself in the bride then it has to happen to you [Laughter] amen so he says this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration now God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning all right so you have to be that you will be that you might as well say I am that amen Hallelujah just like they asked that police officer with a billy club they said they said can you point us to the Revival he said I am the Revival Hallelujah I am the Welsh Revival amen you are the bride's Revival for this age amen you've received that so you have to what get in conditioned to the identification of the word which you are am amen am Hallelujah now watch he says verse 25 it tells us why we need restoration why do we need restoration the Locust cankerworm caterpillar Palm worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told now watch this it's underlined here said now now where we at now we are told that the that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages right not he's going to identify what this is okay now I I'm going to bring you route CU I remember I the things I open up with I got to tell you all right so he says that is right so what are these insects right watch what what he says he says they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages so he says those four bucks are nothing separate than the actual what then the the four movings of the Antichrist spirit in the church ages so we can look at one and then we can put the other there and they are all the same now this will paint a powerful picture for you and I'm going to try to be uh quick about it it says and that that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his or original planting back to Original Seed aren't you glad about that he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign so we have to before we can get a latter Reign we have to what receive a teaching Reign amen that's what brother bram's Ministry was was to teach us the truth of the word amen and when that truth becomes a revelation then the church will stand to her feet amen remember Satan cannot fight Revelation that's right once you have Revelation he can't defeat you there anymore God because you have what joined with the word of who you are hallelujah how can I go back to the world I'm the bride how can I how can I move that direction My Flesh wants to but I've received something on the inside side that will not let me go back amen instead it tells me I can be excited for this word that I can be victorious in this word and that the very Authority that God said in his word I can have I have it amen hallelujah the demons shall be cast out Hallelujah the demons should be set Ablaze amen by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ who has Quicken you amen hallelujah now watch next will come the Harvest rain of rapturing Faith amen it can't come until the the word that has been SW to us is received in Revelation that's why brother sister I've preached this at home church already but I got very interested in this because I watched when brother brandham died I watched the message split off in 5 10 routes now I'm not saying that anybody is not saved or or anybody's not there or anybody's not Bri I'm not saying that but you know what I did I watched Junior Jackson is study this up I watched Junior Jackson go this way I watched Lee Vale go this way I watched Perry green go this way and everybody claims they have the right Doctrine come on I watch Joseph call and go this way right come on Hallelujah you know when when I when the first time I was told that I was going to be a a preacher I was in the message uh down in down in Lima and there was a brother a brother came up to me after service one night and uh he came up to me and he said God bless you my name is so and so I'm not I'm not going to say anything there he said my name is so and so I said God bless you brother pleasure to meet you he said he Saidi just going to cut the chase did you know that God has ordained you to be a preacher I said no sir he said I'm telling you right now he said the Lord told me to tell you that you were ordained to be a preacher right and I was like oh little old me now I got to turn to this that's why I'm telling this so we talked a little bit fellowship and then he walked off and then I had a brother come up to me from the church sweetest brother ever and he came up to me and he said brother cam do you know who that is I said no but he just prophesied that I was going to be a preacher and he said brother you stay away from that brother I said why is that he said he's a seven Thunder believer I said what's that he says it's just some crazy Doctrine it's just a crazy Doctrine for the king and so you know what I did I said yes sir and I stayed away from it and I stayed away from that brother because he told me to oh wow are we quiet but what is that that's denominationalism over the last 15 years I've asked probably 8 10 people I even asked people that were in the seventh ther movement what they believe no one knows what they believe this says well I think it's this you went to a a seventh Thunder church for 10 years and that's all you understand about it what do you know about coming here how could the people be in a spot that they have no clue what they believe Hallelujah even before I came here I I started watching Junior Jackson I'm like okay what what's this brother all about and I watched him and and right after that I I I got in contact I had a brother coming up from from Jeffersonville area and he's preached for me and I said I said uh what about Junior jocks he said oh brother they're way off in right field but I listened to three of his sermons I didn't hear anything wrong and I'm like what is all this what I'm trying to tell you is denominationalism has swept the message stay away stay away from Brother cam stay away from that brother Jesse guy right I'm telling you brother sister brother brandom did not come to tell us to separate he came to show us the fullness of the word and even if we different we're different in our thoughts it should never stop love from coming forth from our life and I'm waking up to this purpose because actually what I was dealing with un unknowned is I was dealing with Locust can rooms caterpillars and Palmer worms and I didn't even know it now let me take this a little bit and and I don't want to only preach on this I got a lot to say but I I want you to I preach a whole series on this and and I want to sew in just a little bit okay cuz I want you to see you can tell where people in the message are and you can tell where your own church is brother brandham said that the Palmer worm was the same as the Antichrist Spirit he said the Locust was the same as the Antichrist Spirit he said the TM was the same as the Antichrist Spirit the ciller was the same as the Antichrist Spirit now watch this cuz what I'm going to show you is it is organization that took God away from the church then they would have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof now if we know our Bible the Bible says from such turn away amen you have a right to the what the truth of the word amen you have a right to the power of God that's why restoration is so important amen hallelujah now what I found was so amazing about all this and like I said I got sermons for each one one to two but uh brother Braham started out in the restoration briad Tre preaching on the palor he said what did that word that worm do he said he took away the fruit when you get into the Deeds of the nickan it's the first step into death where the power begins to not manifest like it's supposed to in the church why because they start to what separate the leader from the Ley right he's smarter than y all he knows more look at how he can preach there's no separation between the L and the preacher if you want to go back in brother Jesse's office and read the quote on the wall brother Bram said he said he is actually a servant and he was actually lesser than them all cuz he was a public servant hallelujah amen but I want you to see this what it took away was the Fruit of the Spirit and the power of God right read the message go into the message find it out next was the Locust and brother Bram said what the Locust eat the leaves what were the leaves now you can tell so here's what I'm saying if you don't have the full fruits of the spirit in this church the gifts of the Spirit we still haven't come out of that brother cam I don't I don't brother sister it's a spirit that moves it tells the Ley that they don't have to do anything right it's a spirit that moves oh brother Jesse he's supposed to do all that you are the body each one of you are called every joint supplieth you can't get away from it brother sister that is what God called you you to be in action amen he called you to carry the work of God Amen Hallelujah you realize you're Pastor he's not even called to come out here and what anoint you you are called Amen to have an anointing before he even gets here amen hallelujah you're called amen that the Holy Ghost can bring healing during your worship Services amen with when your preachers back out there amen he's the same yesterday today forever amen so you can identify where you're at my church we're still trying to get out of these Deeds Hallelujah notice secondly it's what ties right with the doct Nick leans now it just becomes the way of doing things right yep there's a separation between the preacher and all them right but yet those leaves were fellowship and cooling so it begins to separate the people the leaves of Fellowship Hallelujah so when you find a church you got no Fellowship what's going on it's beginning to separate more and more now watch this because when you are right here with the fruit of God you are in unity yes you're working together you realize you got something to do Hallelujah you might have the pray an hour you might have to pray too but you follow the leading of the Lord because that is what that is needed to make the body what it needs to be there might be a fasting Warrior out in this church here amen and what that might be your call of all it to be fasting for the preachers amen remember brother brandom in one meeting he said he said for the powerful things that God has done these Services he said I'd like to give credit to these two sisters over here that were fasting and praying for these Services Hallelujah when that gift got into the spiritual Realm it found two sisters that broke through to God Amen and all those healings everything that was working it was working because the Ley had position amen hallelujah now I'm going to try to hurry up then third we have the canor which took away the bark right and brother Bram said uh that that was what that bark was the religion the covering the doctrine right and that's what do BM does very very simple balum taught the people to what commit spiritual fornication that's fornication but spiritual right amen so what you start getting down and all of a sudden we'll just do anything we will take the precepts of organization and Foster the message through it be careful now amen then lastly you have caterpillar I like said I'm going to hurry up and what the caterpillar actually got into the tree and began to eat all the life or the pulp out of the tree and what it ties right in with Jezebel which is spiritual death she began to die that was that fourth Church age amen they begin to die right now remember your rights are way up here you're called to have all of it but what did you need now notice somebody stole something away from you something made your church not what it was supposed to be amen but you still have the right and freedom to get back to what he called you to be Hallelujah Now watch how simple this is hallelujah when God started a restoration he brought justification amen now remember uh let me just say this real quickly because when God anointed brother brandom to show Who The Messengers were they had to have the same characteristics and they all were against organization they were all against what about placing man's will into the church but as soon as they passed on the church ran right with it they did it in the message too brother sister Hallelujah so first step back what justification now you get your church age books and you follow the quote there's a quote pattern it goes right through there and it what it brings it right back so jusic ation that bring your pull back spiritual death is gone you're not dead you feel de today you need to be restored amen hallelujah sanctification the bark was restored Hallelujah which is what so notice it comes up back reverse order all the way back out right okay so the bark was restored or what the Doctrine is beginning to be restored right then what then you have spiritual gifts come in and the the leaves of Fellowship right how come people in the message ain't got gifts like they ought to I'm telling you it went so quickly because right right when brother brandom passed off those things were just being settled in brandham Tabernacle Jesse know some of you Saints you study this out you find it right out he talked about all those people with the gifts and so forth how it's supposed to operate he laid it all out because they they were beginning to work in a certain way right Hallelujah so then it comes back to spiritual gifts the leaves restor because what it takes Unity brother sister brother Bram said he said we should have so many gifts in the church he said that that those that are gifted should meet a half hour to an hour before service and pray and seek God and let the gifts be used there amen and then he said then it should go to those with wisdom and the ability to what judge amen and they should judge them and then they should be read to the church and if all those gifts are working right then it will what prophesy to the people hallelujah it'll put things right down to the thoughts and intents of the heart to the church anybody want a church like that Hallelujah brother brandom said he said what he said it would call out somebody coming to the church and and tell what why they weren't getting their healing and what it was that they would get if they did it right it's a lot of sermons there brother and sister but but just just to just to hit highlights like the prophet hit highlights right and then lastly you have the word of God had to be restored Hallelujah and what that brought the fruit the fruit back so if we've received the truth of the word then why is it not producing or have we been what brought up in a message full of Creeds and dogmas ha uh I've come to understand and learn that that because of how things have went there have been many Creeds and dogmas brought right into the message of yahwah and all of them are based off quotes so what do you have to do study it out search it out find it out brother sister this is very important because it shows what God is trying to do with you Hallelujah don't ever expect anybody else to do your work God has an individual work he has for you all right Hallelujah get moving brother cam all right I sure will I want to sew that in there for about 15 minutes 20 and let you know what has happened in the message but where we're at right now is the words begin to unfold like never before Hallelujah God is what he's bringing to us come out of her come out of everything that Catholicism sewed in there with her daughters stay out of it amen and follow the perfect word now watch this Isaiah 42:18 now I'm going to turn now all right I'm going to go right back into into what God has for you uh as far as uh uh the heart of where I want to go with this all right uh Isaiah 42:18 says hear ye deaf and look ye blind that you may see I preached this here probably 10 years ago as when you guys were in the other the other place I'm not g to focus on this but I want to hit the Highlight because but because look they're deaf and they're blind who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that I sent who is blind as as he that is perfect and blind as the Lord's servant they can't hear and they can't see my seeing many things but thou observe us not sounds like Leo deia they're blind miserable wretched and they don't know it they don't know what the word has entitled them to they don't know what they don't care about it they're just what they just want to follow some sort of little message path we're called to receive the full unadulterated word amen hallelujah don't think that God can't bring it through your pastor amen don't think that God can ordain a five-fold Ministry to bring it in amen God is more than able to bring the fullness of the truth to you amen right Hallelujah I had a fellow preach a while back and I knew he was so full of dogmas and while he was preaching I just felt led to have him come and while he's preaching it just came on my heart like this this overwhelming feel feeling came to came to my heart and this feeling said he's going to preach some false doctrines you know what I did I closed my eyes and I said Lord hold that brother's mouth that he can only speak the truth and after I did that I watched that brother and and and he almost started fumbling with you could see he started fumbling with his thoughts a little bit and I watched when every time he brought his thought out he said something true and we got to the end of the service I said Hallelujah because that's my right amen that's my right as a preacher there was a lot of truth that came out and even brothers and message hey we have a commonality of the word that we can join together you don't think the power of our God who said all things are possible if you believe when he brings a thought to you you can't bind the mouth of the preacher to only say truth I'll tell you that's how power for the God we serve is hallelujah I had a brother in the church that knew that that brother preach all sorts of crazy stuff and he came up to me afterwards and he said he said brother I was so expecting for him to say something crazy and far out because he does it everywhere I looked at him and said yep yep Prayer Changes Things and I left it right there you're the first people I told about it Hallelujah but our God is able Amen to hold us to the word amen now watch these people seeing many things without servest not opening the ears but he heareth not the Lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable he might have people that are blind and they can't hear a thing in this word amen but he's more than able to bring forth those that can they can see it and they can hear it amen now watch this but this is a people robbed and spoiled so when the people lose the ability to see the word to see the manifestation of the spirit to hear it to see it remember brother Jesse was the one that that he when he preached that so many years ago he he said he said uh uh and brought it out I never ever seen it like that and it still holds to me I still preach it I still preach exactly what my pastor of the of the years ago said but he said he said that Holy Ghost is now something you can see and hear right right Hallelujah from your life amen the Holy Ghost is something you can see and hear amen amen so if you can't see it on somebody you can't hear it there's something wrong with the Holy Ghost experience in that individual but I'll tell you you don't have to live that way you don't have to accept that way there's one thing you've got to do amen watch this the people were robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are HD in prison houses you are not called to be snared right trapped you are not called to what to feel like you're in a prison house there's one thing I should have said I should have said leica's B I like who's got it house the hell what else can we lose it's on my heart to say loneliness that's right amen hallelujah like you're caught up in some prison house and nobody understands you right brother God God understands you a lot of your brothers and sisters understand youall Hallelujah I feel like I'm the only one that's got to deal with that brother brandom said it's a complex amen but I'll tell you that Jesus Christ can set you free amen now I want you to watch the difference here oh my Hallelujah it says they are for a pray and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore they were completely satisfied in their snares and prison houses sitting right in the church right they were just fine not watching the communion of the Holy Ghost give them a smile that they couldn't get rid of why do I got to help that you shouldn't have to help that Jesus Christ's power gets in you in such a way remember in John 7 he said he shall it shall it shall flow from your belly as rivers of Living Water it's something that flows out of you this Holy Ghost I can't help but be happy I cannot help but praise the Lord amen hallelujah we never even experienced what Paul and Silas there they were in stocks and bonds amen but there they were praising the Lord singing his grace His Glory How Great Thou Art and what happened amen when they CED out the what the stocks and Vines broke by earthquake amen because they still had joy in Tribulation the issue is people get So Satisfied in that depleted condition where they've been robbed of the devil that they don't even say God restore it please God I believe you can restore it they don't even think of it so Satan is in the business of stealing everything you have Hallelujah but notice he didn't say none doeth restore once again we're right back to a Roman ceran just speak only where's a person saying I have lost something see what I'm saying especially as human beings we are so easily able to affiliate with what we have lost in our natural experience right I've lost my health I've lost my my my freedom as far as uh to be free of Fellowship I I've lost my my my my freedom to to worship God like I want to right because you're watching the pattern of what your natural self has done see if you have been caught right there you haven't even been moved to a place where God says I will restore everything because that's something that you haven't even experienced tongues interpretations specific prophecy Paul said he said in 1 Corinthians 14 I would that you all would prophesy that's your word that's if you get restored that's what you are but he's got to get rid of the things that we've accepted in our own life someone's got to get in the condition that if God spoke by his word himself I will restore sayith the Lord someone's got to get in a condition and say God restore me amen restore this church amen hallelujah this is the restoration this is what my church is this is what my life feel it's all right here hallelujah your blood remember his blood purchased it I preached a sermon it was called uh it was called uh the Heavenly blood applied because that's the power of this word what God told us we look and say he shed his blood back there but if you can see the deeper alignment with it when Jesus Christ became the sacrifice at Calvary and resurrected what did he actually do he went up to the mercy seat that was already established in heaven and what there the blood is applied that's why he's the high priest of your profession there is blood there get it there has been blood there every single day of your life Hallelujah that blood never lost its power it's still there don't think brother Bram didn't say it brother brandom said it amen the Bible says it Hallelujah it is a true Revelation the blood ain't dried off it's sitting now in Heavenly places to intercede for you for your every single need amen that's why you cry restoration you're believing on a Heavenly blood that's sitting right there Glory they were so dead that they couldn't even see their conditions don't think that leod deia at this very end of the age is not the same all right you ready for a turn let's look at the law of restoration because I want I want to this is very simple but I want to show you something very powerful so I'm not going to go into that's a jubilee trumpet amen you realize what the Jubilee was a type of every 50 years every man who got snared lost his inheritance maybe he lost his property maybe he lost his F whatever he lost on the Jubilee uh the Jubilee year the 50th year he could go back and and take everything that was his that 50 years was a type of the day of Pentecost Hallelujah 50 days hallelujah God fulfilled that with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to wait for 50 years let me say it like this you don't need to wait 50 days hallelujah the the Bible says they were in one place and one Accord amen hallelujah and what on that day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost swept through them amen and filled them with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is your Jubilee the Holy Ghost is your excitement amen the Holy Ghost is what makes you want to serve God Amen it's your power and it's your right you are called to never lose your spiritual land again amen hallelujah that first church it's your right Hallelujah you are part of that bride and you what it's been lost but it's yours believe it ask for it stand on it Hallelujah your profession I am the acts two church I am amen a child of God bought by his blood saved by grace Hallelujah cuz I want you to see this today it was God and God Alone that brought your restoration am watch what he says in John 10:7 then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them Hallelujah now watch he's talking about his day and what was before him if you actually establish it what made the Pharisees what made the Sadducees thieves and robbers right well how do you know because what those individuals produce such organization that what that the people come under that organizational mindset and when Christ the true word come they could not accept it that's what organizational Spirit does it makes you so you can't receive the what the perfect word Jesus Christ Hallelujah so what do you think we've had for 2,000 years thieves and robbers preaching a different message hallelujah what adding and taking away from the word but God gave us a seventh angel that we can see what the true word is hallelujah thieves and robbers but notice but the Sheep did not hear them I've watched old over and over and over again my life even how God brought me into this message but God he would use it just like he did in the Scripture it was like a wheat plant coming forth it started growing and then you have a stalk then what then you got a tassel then you got a Shook and out of the shook remember the Shu was so close it just fit it fit the seed but there came a time it looked exactly like the seed but there came a time where the seed had to come out that's right I'm excited I can't help it Hallelujah don't worry I got more Hallelujah I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture if you get into Jesus and Jesus alone amen this church don't save you brother Jesse don't save you brother cam don't save you for sure amen the only one that can save you is Jesus Christ amen go to him that bought your Redemption amen hallelujah enter into him the one that died for your sins love him more than anything else they'll be on all right but but notice his sheep they wouldn't get caught by the thieves and the robbers Hallelujah they wouldn't get caught by all the false doctrines they wouldn't be caught by all the lies they would what they constantly set their faces towards the word remember this is Anointed ones at the end time I ain't got time to preach those messages it's going to be so close it would deceive the elected if possible it means it has to come right out of the message I'm not saying that if someone sitting in a specific church that they ain't going to make it because you don't know who's got the Holy Ghost and where they got the Holy Ghost I don't know what God did I know how God did with me I was sitting in an Assembly of God Church wan to be a preacher Hallelujah then then these brothers caught it and I almost went Toe to Toe with brother Jesse you know I'm only alive today because he didn't swing Hallelujah that's God's grace his muscles were as big as my legs but one day God opened my eyes up praise the Lord and I seen it Hallelujah watch he says the thief cometh not but for the steal and kill and destroy he wants you to have a subpar experience aside from Jesus Christ I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen he has come to what give you the fullness of life if you have been caught under the what the stealing the killing and the destroying of Satan amen God can restore it with life I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep you know what that was that was actually a purchase he purchased his elect seed with the shedding of his blood amen the perfect sacrifice remember what we're waiting on is redemption's [Applause] claim Hallelujah and I'll tell you what he's coming back for me amen hallelujah you got to see it he's coming back for you amen his blood was the perfect purchas of me how do I know it by the revealing and the opening of the word now watch Jesus Christ is the restoration he's the fullness of the restoration you get him you have restoration I want you to see it that's the evil of leoda because it wants you to hybrid something with the word it wants you to hybrid your thoughts your hobbies what you like it wants to hybrid everything with the word right brother it wants you it wants a message Pastor it wants it wants us to to look and say well we should do it because they're doing it message churches are getting big because that I ought to do it too that's not how this works there is a a specific will of God for his people and it comes only by the word I said something there I know you're Pastor He he'll help out in whatever way you can after I walk out these doors Amen brother Cam's a little bit fanatical you just leave me the way I am because I see something right now and I it's is not shaking on me Hallelujah don't think I ain't seen the Vindication of the spirit I'm rolling with this brother and sister I'm seeing it amen Hallelujah watch this so what is the true mind of God on restoration look at I got that more so if you had someone steal spiritually kill you destroy your life what could Christ do I want you to watch this this is very powerful Leviticus 6 it says and the Lord spake unto Moses is saying if a soul sin and commit a trespass against the Lord and lie unto his neighbor in that which was delivered him to keep or in fellowship or in a thing taken away by violence or hath deceived his neighbor or have found that which was lost and lith concerning it and sweareth falsely in any of these that a man doeth sinning therein Hallelujah so if anybody would do anything like that to somebody else they would take what they have they'd lie about it they would deceitfully take it watch this now then it shall be because he has sinned and is guilty that he [Music] shall restore that which he took violently away or the thing which he had deceitfully gotten or that which was delivered him to keep or the Lost thing which he found he has to restore it God made a law amongst the natural Church of Israel that if someone took something away they'd have to give it back [Applause] am Hallelujah now watch [Applause] this so he says where am I at right down here would I move the thing which he deceive God or that which was delivered to him the Lost thing which you found or all that was about which he sworn falsely he shall even restore it in the pron principle you know what that means that means if something was unrightfully taken from that individual he has to give them exactly what they took right back he has to restore it but watch this there's an icing on the cake all right and so wait a minute God in his law not only says he has to give back what he took and shall add the fifth part more thereto and give it unto him whom it appertaineth in the day of his trespass offering Hallelujah so if the devil took something away from you by the law of God he has to give it back amen Hallelujah but watch this he don't only have to give it back he has to give you more than what he took amen hallelujah amen this is the law of God not only do you get it back but you get bonus Hallelujah watch what he says in restoration of the Bride tree like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law you see how how under privilege we lived how we live you have the right by the word of God you have the right by the word of God Amen hallu then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces enforces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner and it's to the first estate enforcement oh what a text how I'd like to have two days on that in force now notice this you don't have the right as an individual with your own power your own will to get it back you have a law and an enforcer of that law remember we don't have the quote and PR down the road but it says what the Holy Ghost is that enforcer Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will enforce the law of God that you get back what the devil took away Hallelujah therefore you have a right of restoration by the law of God to get everything that has ever been taken away and if you can see what that is you can say my nine spiritual gifts amen hallelujah the freedom of worship amen the ability to bring the Shina glory in this place hallelujah it's my right by the word of God it's my right to have a church in one Accord amen it's my right to what be free and happy to serve [Applause] Jesus it's the law of restoration watch Exodus 221 if a man steal an ax or a sheep and kill it or sell it watch this if you just steal one Ox if he kills it he shall restore five oxen the law of restoration why not just one I want you to see this God he wants to so spoil the enemy the transgressor of his law that he will force that transgressor to give you back more than what he took fivefold so if he takes one Ox he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheepen Hallelujah if the the son be risen upon him there shall be blood shed for him for he should make full restitution if he have nothing then he shall be sold for his theft Hallelujah this also tells us how to treat one another doesn't it don't treat your brother wrong don't steal his Joy from him right that's why brother Bram said he said he said you talk nasty about your pastor he said you've already killed the man so who who's responsible you killed his reputation let alone what you might say about your brother or sister we're all in this together we are all uniquely called for this speak what speak only blessings upon you brother or sister if you see a thought that needs to be addressed address it but what do it in love and what don't let it change your opinion about them because you you are called as our brother said earlier to love ye shall know your disciples by their love Hallelujah let's say it like this you need them just as much as they need you Hallelujah that's a thing when what when that which is taken away is brought back you don't know how far the blessings of restoration will go down the line Hallelujah I only wanted my one Ox back you see you see the issues we get in well if I could just have my health back oh God that's all I want the devil took it that's not how the word works that's you are accepting a lie that all you get back is your health what's the word say he's going to give you that which he took and then he's going to take that which he took which was an ax and give you five Hallelujah for for shap now watch this if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive whether it be an ox or an ass or a sheep he shall restore double so if you find it and he didn't kill it he's going to give you back two just for the act of it now watch what about the devil brother the sister you don't think God controls this devil yes you don't think God can force something on him it's that easy yes amen but you've got to know the enforcer of the law Hallelujah you've got to believe this is his job amen if a man shall cause a field or Vineyard to be eaten and shall put his in his beast and shall feed another man's field look how simple this goes to somebody you own a Land and somebody puts an ox in there and they start eating your grass watch this start feeding another man's field of the best of his own field and of the best of his own Vineyard shall he make restitution he's got to make restitution of anything no matter what it is anything taken away he has to restore it look what Solomon says Proverbs 6:30 men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he's hungry but if he be found he shall restore [Music] Sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house sounds like something Jesus said he said when a when a strong man's got his house he thinks he's got his Goods he said when one stronger comes he taketh away all that he has and spoil his own Goods you don't think Satan took away or uh or what Satan took away Jesus will not take back that's his purpose the Bible says he he destroyed the works of the devil and what the Bible says you can redeem redeem the time I need a restoration of the time I've lost get it Hallelujah now notice brother and sister those seven Church ages each brought a [Music] virtue those seven Church ages what all brought a message that's what your church age book is just like it's says and how can I overcome each Church age gotten a a a blessing a reward for overcoming that's right Hallelujah and here we see Solomon remember Solomon also said he said what he said that wise man is huge Seven Pillars your seven Church ages brother sister you don't have to leave what God has what what he has bought in seven Church Church ages you are to be a reflection of what faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and what receive that Capstone [Applause] love cuz that's all the devil has done he's taken the seven things which belong to us but Christ come to restore the word to identify what those were and to show them that they're yours and it's going to bring you into the stature of perfection he's got to give everything up to you he don't have a choice why because God's word said that am not only do you see the witnesses like this you see where what in Joel two he said I will restore amen it all says it's yours Hallelujah Luke 195 now watch this is a Son of God and when Jesus came to the to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zakus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and receiveth him joyfully when the word come to him zakus received him with all joy the word has come to me every time you come to the house of God every time you listen to a message the word of God is coming to you Hallelujah watch this and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guested with a man that is a sinner is't that something you look and say oh they all look down on me like I'm like I'm evil and blah blah blah blah blah so the word comes to people like [Music] that they might not be much in the religious world's eyes or their family eyes but with Christ he found it all worthy to go to such a man's house this was a man that was a tax collector what just stealing and taking from everyone else now watch this and zachus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor so when he come in contact with the word he he what he didn't just keep on building his coffers he began to give out Hallelujah not only that and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him for full God's law work just the same for what for this thief as it did from a son of God who was a thief God didn't tell Jesus didn't say you have to give half of everything you have you got to thought fourfold but what just because the word came to him it put him under an inspiration that all he had taken unrightfully he was going to restore it according to the word amen hallelujah if you stole if you done anything wrong go give it back if the word comes to you Hallelujah place it get back where it belongs because watch what Jesus said and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house because what he brought restoration and what as the trespass offering was made he gave more than what he took for as much this day salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham he was a seed of God everybody's getting quiet everybody steal something or what Hallelujah I'll tell you a story 20 probably 20 22 23 years ago my my my plant I was working at Lear and my plant closed down and there was a guy who said he said most of this garbage you're going to throw away he said what do you think about that cart right there and I said I said oh that's really nice he's like take it and I said no said I'm not taking that he said you're going to take it I said no I'm not I'm a Christian I don't do stuff like that he said I'm gonna be out at your car at break time and I am gonna force that in your car sure enough I was out at my car at breakdown here you come with that thing and he came there there's he said open your trunk he's a lot bigger than me and I'm like oh and so you know what I did I let him put that cart in there and I drove off and I got home I'm like what am I going to do with this they shut the plant down I'm like what am I going to do and my busy lifestyle I just forgot about it I put it in the garage and I'm like this isn't even mine I just left it there and then uh and I come to this message I was sitting there one day I said 'lord what do I got to make right it's wrong and something come and said you stole that car and I'm sitting here I didn't I mean I guess I kind of did but this man literally forced me to steal it and I didn't fight it as far as I didn't know how to fight it I mean I'm not gonna get in a fist fight with a guy and I was just under my ignorance I I didn't know what what was really going on and it came back and said you return it and I said all right like the plants closed then what do I do I thought come said get on the internet so I found a Lear plant that was all the way up in Detroit an hour and 15 minutes away from me and the thoughts are already Satan's rolling through my mind don't you do it you're gonna go to jail don't you do it you're gonna go to jail I'm like well if I got to go to jail over this cart I guess it is what it is so I got to the place I'm like oh and uh I walked up I knocked on went in the office I said I need to talk to somebody that's got some power around here and they're like okay and so they said go outside we we'll send the the manager guy out and I'm like okay so I walked out there and I said uh I said okay so I I'm just standing for like five minutes I'm like Lord just give me words to speak I don't want to go to [Laughter] jail amen and anyway so the guy comes out he said he said yeah he said uh how can I help you and I said well I'm just going to tell you a story I worked at this plant blah blah blah and I I went through that whole thing and I said I said I'm a Christian I said I didn't want to do this it got pushed on me and I'm here to give this back I feel absolutely horrible the Holy Ghost told me that this is something between me and him and I have to make it right and I said I said and I I'm here to apologize to you and your company that you represent that I took it I said please forgive me and he must not been a Christian he's like uh okay well uh why don't you just push that card over there and get out of here like okay so I pushed that c off I jumped in my truck and I was out the door but you know what when I left there a burden that had bound my heart for seven years it lifted off of me it wasn't there every day it just keep coming back there's something there's something you haven't done yet hallelujah hallelujah everybody looking at a sinner aren't you Hallelujah but I'll tell you what there was salvation that what worked its reward on me that day and where my conscience was bound I left for the freedom amen knowing that I was clean with my Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] amen hallelujah amen Matthew 12:28 but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God Has Come unto you or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoils good except that he first bind the strong man that's what Calvary did when he shed that blood he bound the devil he bound him we only give it to the devil that's all we're doing we're just give stuff to him you don't have to give him nothing you don't have to you have a right by the word of God yes to speak the word at him you resist that Devil by the word he shall flee he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad right Jesus did that for you now watch I'm going to go just a little bit farther I see the time and I I got to close once again but Job 1 16 now watch this now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan come also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou uh then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fromo in the Earth from walking up and down it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant jel that there's none like him in the earth a perfect and upright right man one that fearth God and esth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said doth job fear God for not hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land god protected that man because he was God's child now we know what happens so what happened God allowed Satan to take his children turned his wife against them took all that he had now for time sakes but what did job do job stayed right there believing God not understanding but believing amen now remember part of the moral the story brother Bram said he said the thing that he feared most came that's right yes he feared that remember he preached uh when he preached uh uh perfect faith in ' 63 he said that he said he said the thing that that he feared came to him if he wouldn't have feared it it wouldn't have come now God placed those things there so it doesn't matter what has offended you as far as what fear you might had but I'll tell you what get out of it don't hold on it you don't get rid of it it's going to come trust in the Lord your God for he is your confidence he is going to keep you you think the government's going to get you or you think this guy's going to get you the guy hiding in the bushes they're going to get you but if you trust that God is going to keep you amen he is going to do more than just that amen he is going to raise you up in the power of God and his righteousness amen so watch job lost everything and even his body was was swn with disease now watch of course we realize the end I'm showing you the law of restoration brother sister and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends he first he had to pray for his his miserable comforters he had to pray first and losing everything he had to pray for the people that were trying to really break him and make him want to die Hallelujah good says when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before you see the law of restoration he doesn't just want to give you back what you've lost he wants to give you back a lot more I ain't talking about Mercedes benzes and Lamborghinis he's going to give you the things that are Eternal am I'm not saying he won't physically bless you cuz he has Hallelujah but what I am saying is he wants to bring forth an eternal treasure to you amen I don't know about you give me my family Lord every single one of them give me my cousins Lord let there be a Revival strike the people amen that watch that hope has went forth from My Life by faith to say they're mine amen the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then came there unto him all his Brethren and all sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him and all the evil the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of gold so he still has more people what giving him more so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14,000 sheep that's twice as many 6,000 camels and a th000 of Yol of oxen and a thousand she asses he all had also seven sons and three daughters which is what that's what he didn't get a double portion of because he had seven before right Hallelujah and aren't you glad for a revelation that come through this Prophet his kids were all cutting up he said job was there putting them under the blood you got to believe it don't tell me how everybody's kids look are perfect sometimes you're look and say oh God what's going on here hallelujah you put them right under the blood you say they mine amen hallelujah they're going with me amen hallelujah hallelujah That's the Law of restoration Hallelujah let me see I'm I got to close he said we're closing in this quote so I got to close yes this is beautiful I want you to see this unfailing realities of God in 60 said I've often thought this we're closing Church listen to these remarks I've often thought what what why how we've deprived oursel and how we've robbed God of his plan by not surrendering Our Lives completely to him everything that we have to him how that we've have disallowed his program oh Lord Jesus does God deserve anything less than the representation of what this says he doesn't who did he call to do it you you and I look at how brother brings us we've disallowed this program why because of our selfish ways we're not surrendering to God like we ought to well this is how we do it no this is how we do it get quiet how do we know what God's will is for us we've got to go to him don't you see that's that's the very tenant of nickan ism is when we begin to put our own human ideas and we don't let the word of God lead us you know probably the greatest Miracle of the book of Acts is how perfectly God was able to lead those people it isn't the supernatural Miracles those are all great hallelujah thank God for them but to me it was the communion with God and the ability for God to lead them in such a perfect way Hallelujah am amen he said he's trying to find how we've lingered and made him to wait and wait and wait trying to find somebody he could work through trying to find a man somewhere that he could put confidence in some man that would surrender everything come inan sensible way to God and say Father Here I Am I don't care I'm I'm going to follow the scripture the blueprint I don't care what anybody else says I'll stay with it and really mean it I don't care what it cost me Lord I'm nothing to begin with but I want you to lead me and let the holy spirit that wrote this Bible and made these promises confirm it back through my life I feel that you're leading me that way amen see it's Allowing God to have the full influence on your decisions your choices Hallelujah you know how it is if we get in the way how much trouble it causes thank God for that because remember there's a people that are blessed and they think blessing is a reality of the right they get bigger bigger more money more everything oh look at us the r talked about so many times but what it's a lie Hallelujah that means I've been long I know as we close so what came down zigg lak I'll just go through it just real quickly when David's men came to Zig everything that they had the their their little tent city was burnt down their wives and their children everything they had was taken very familiar with the story right they even wanted to Stone David his soldiers did but David had one thing that he did is he actually consulted the epid he said shall I pursue them when it looked bad he said shall I pursue them and the the spirit of the Lord came back with a message he said pursue for Thou shalt surely recover all [Laughter] you see how Bible this is think about that an army burns your house down they take your family first thing you think is what my family's dead they've been harmed in in in inconceivable ways look at what you're seeing on the news the atrocities we're watching right now thank God that the Bible tells tells us in Proverbs 3 that said Don't Fear what comes to the sons of men don't fear what happens to them why do you say don't fear it because he's going to keep you above it but sister we're bringing the revelation of invincibility in this hour that's what we're doing you've got to believe who you are you've got to believe what the power you have is David was so anointed of God that even his enemies in burning his things and taking his family their animals away they could only take them away they couldn't tame it in any way well I only want half my healing back I only want uhuh I Want It All Hallelujah there's a law of restoration here amen I don't just get it back I get back more [Laughter] amen so they pursued them and remember I believe it was the brook of Bo bazor that what men were fainting they couldn't even go on but and what David said leave them here let's go get it back amen hallelujah almost done he said and force he said have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God came in this word made certain claims to the church he gave you the word as your claim don't throw away the Old Testament don't throw away it it's just as applicable as the New Testament with the right Revelation therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan say give it back and has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord amen he has got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land every right and promise this Bible gave you is yours praise the Living God it just keeps on going I thought I was done he said what is it en forcing giving it back that's right that's what I'm talking about restore bring it back to the right over if Satan has robbed you of a privilege of being a son or daughter of God you don't feel like you're a son or daughter of God what do you do notice you don't feel it I don't feel like much of a Christian I don't feel like I'm a child of God I feel like I I feel like my flesh and you know I'm just I'm just a serpent just sitting in a Son of God Church no you aren't what it is he's brought thoughts your way and what cause you to think his lie he said the privilege of being a son or daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back if he's Afflicted you made you sick we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes we're healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out here under death and we claim him back bring him back now that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick baby is sick woman is sick they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because God gave it to us God give it to us by his stripes we're healed he was wounded for transgression by his stripes we're healed he said we have a right to enforce a law and the lawgiver Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way he said now the only way he can work is when you let him work there it is oh Fighters you've got to believe it there's a law oh if I ever get to my text there's a law there's a law given amongst everything you've got to believe Hallelujah you see you see how how we're taking it even farther with the rest of this world word that says he doesn't give you just back what's yours he gives you back more yes so what happens here there it is he says David inquired of the Lord saying shall I pursue after the troop and shall I overtake and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them without fail recover all moving all the way down David recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all and David took all the flocks and the herds which they Dr before the cattle and said this is David's spoil but if you read continue reading he not only had that he took everything they had he had so much that he was able to send it to the tribes of Israel and they made him King h Hallelujah now think about it these are the ones that had rejected him as king and he sent them gifts of the spoil God gave him see so the extra blessings that God gave him he didn't keep them for himself to make him more rich and better he sent it out to what to bring everyone into a spot that they could be in the right position for the message of their age Hallelujah and that was David is the king Christ is the king amen let's stand I'm done hallelujah am what's your expectation now I don't want to confuse this idea because you know exactly just like we said last night this right here it's like oh God where's this at H H how can I do I mean how could I possibly and you see we've come under such such a condition because we're not right with our savior according to his word but this is what God is going to produce this is what God wants to do he wants to get you into such a spot you're enforcing all of the word all of the time amen I know I kept an hour and a half probably a little bit over I can't even read the time back I didn't look at it God help me man you put all that work in to set that bad that nice thing back there and I didn't even follow it Hallelujah but I'll tell you what if you can catch who you are in the world it changes everything it's like as I'm looking at little she ain't little but growing growing Caris there within her is all the power to enforce the claim of this word you've got to believe that God made you that way well I'm just a I'm just a little girl I'm just no you are a child of God with all the rights of redemption in your hand therefore you love the Lord your God and say God give me your mind fill me with your Holy Ghost amen so Lord that as I'm coming to you in the life you gave me I'm able to follow the path that you called for me and to do what you called me to do in this hour to overcome the devil in all his tricks all his lies and to get back everything that the devil has taken from the bride amen hallelujah you're called for it how many say that's what I am praise be to God real simple message today was a little long but that's what that's what I do Che want itj you want it glory and get yourself in the condition don't go back out and and and be defeated don't back out don't go back out and do that just like last night if you already feel like I went right back to what I am well my kids made me do that or or or or SE and so they didn't treat me right it happened right after church don't worry about any of that that's what the devil is trying to do to destroy you from being a great enemy and adversary to him if he can just get you back in a rut to not see the rights and privileges that Jesus Christ died for you to give you hallelujah how many say I left that behind Hallelujah all those things are covered by the blood but yet here we are at the end of the service what will you do let's do the only thing that rightfully comes has the devil taken anything from you well first we got to be like zakus have I taken anything from somebody I got to get right if you're all right there praise the Lord you can move step twoo I see I see eyes going like this thinking that's good that's good Hallelujah because you might have some restoration to do yourself Hallelujah but now what would you do if you're free from that just as soon as you make the even if there's something there you say God I'm make that right you're already ready for step two CU When you have made by Revelation the statement I'm going to make it right you'll go do it don't leave the moment of the word because if he's taken anything back he's taken anything away from you you have right now by the by the power of the Holy Ghost the ability to bring it back that's power heads it's been probably been for services much energy has been spent but now as we're kind of bringing it back down to living in the in the true Prosperity that the Holy Ghost has called for us brother brandom he made he made this known from his own life how this would work not just for him but for others which is what it's not just bring the blessing to him in restoration but what it's doing a work for others how would say with their hearts today oh God Satan's taken some things from me maybe say he took that specifically I know he took it away and I'm here to get right with my savior right now and being right with my savior I can take the enforcer and enforce a claim on Satan right now by the name of Jesus Christ if there's something on your heart right now we're going to pray into him right now yes Lord you are in just as much Authority as I am so if you have that enforcer because he is in you you have the right of Revelation from him in you and through you to bring back that which was taken away so as I pray you can pray as well and let's just reach out we're living in a day where God wants to do great things do we have the spiritual courage enough to put the battle in Array let's pray Lord Jesus thou knowest oh God as we look back at our lives we see imperfection we see oh God failures and Lord perhaps this being taken that being taken but yet Lord you gave us a word that lord it's our rights by the Holy Spirit to get back what has been taken away it takes Faith oh God in your power it takes faith in your love that you have for us to know you love us and to know that you want to work for us and that we are the called and elected of God that you want to bring this word forth today Lord as we reach to you now Lord thou knowest oh God our condition if the devil's stolen joy we enforce the claim of the Holy Ghost against them now Sor eliar we take our joy back right now by the Holy Spirit whatever it is to each individual we pray oh God move them by your Holy Ghost oh God oh God put that desire allow it to build Faith there Lord and take that back what the enemy yes has taken from them in restoration we're believing oh God how great this is you don't just give it back but you br give back more Lord so with all of our heart we see that word we see it's possible Lord and we're asking oh God that we would live in the Bountiful Abundant Life that you've called us to in this hour if there's one thing we could repent of God is that we've robbed You by not living your program out by not allowing your Holy Ghost to find a surrendered vessel in us and we lay that down oh God and may you be able oh God to restore your church back to what she should be oh God take every ounce of humanism take every ounce of organization take every ounce of everything and let it be nothing but the pure word in our lives we believe you'll do it now Lord for thy glory and Lord as all this word has been sown over the last four days we pray oh God that it would anchor so deep in the hearts oh God that they would move just like that quote said in a greater power all the time as it becomes more in the minority we're believing you'll do it now we speak the blessing of the name of Jesus Christ over these people and we bless your wonderful name for how great you are in your word we love it it's the very food to our souls in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amenallah hallelujah we're going to sing that song uh I went to the enemy's camp and I took back what he stole from me we invite your pastor song leaders
