[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like to look at the purpose series this morning I will just have one service today as I was announcing this week Luke chapter 2 hopefully got a chance to talk to your mother if not take this afternoon and make sure you get a chance to speak with your mom there I got to talk to my mom and just had a nice little conversation she said well nobody's invited me to anything this morning you know I said well mom I said I wish I could be there I really wish I could be there but I do a good thank her for all that she's done for me and she's just a tremendous mother and all that she seemed to know so I thank the Lord for that praise God thank God for His mercy and his love I'd like to look at a few scriptures here Luke chapter 2 let's go to verse 17 when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying that was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart I noticed that this sure says here look at Mary pondering the Word of God in her heart praise God I'd like to also look at a later on in the scripture when Simeon prophesized look what the Bible says here let's go to verse 32 this is what he calls Jesus a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel as God's light shine on your heart this morning well then you know this scripture is fulfilled in our lives amen he's shining on the Gentiles today and Joseph and his mother marveled of those things which were spoken to him see she always kept these things in her heart we want to look at Mary a little bit this morning Mary's belief and Simeon blessed them and said unto mary's mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against ya a sword shall pierce through the ione so also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed amen may God as blessing the rivas word you may be seated there praise the Lord now we're really familiar of course with Mary and a lot of the scriptures here about how they pon actually pondered the Word of God in our heart and I want to look at a lot of those thoughts this morning I want to kind of rehearse the the story of Mary as I listening to Mary's belief yesterday I probably got through it about three times and enjoyed it by the grace of the Lord but before that one I wish all the mothers a happiest mother today let's give them around pause again by God's grace I'll try to catch your mothers with the Rose at the end if I don't I'll send my children after you try to catch it so thank the Lord for His grace and where would we be without mom amen my mom is so special praise God that female attribute of God right God's our Father and our mother we're birthed out of God so it's just amazing that God takes both attributes there so thank the Lord for His mercy so I want to look here to the scripture and I'll just be honest I'm probably gonna I'm always honest but I'm gonna start preaching some of the thoughts I'm gonna preach next Sunday at Toledo so or honestly don't Michigan but Paula Fontaine so I've just been it's kind of overlapping in fact I couldn't sleep last night and I got about 10 or 12 thoughts that kind of drop down while I was up till passed I'm trying to go to bed at 10:30 and it's up past midnight thinking on the things of God so I'm starting to see that the direction maybe for next weekend but you will have brother bender odd here so he'll be preaching both services for us so we're looking forward to having both been here I know he's always a blessing and so I just I'll probably kind of mix up some of these thoughts but I hope it'll be a blessing to you by God's grace so uh actually read the wrong text so let's go back to Luke chapter 1 I met Luke I was at Luke 237 like man it doesn't look like the scripture mercy but I didn't have my my notes open so let's go to Luke 1:37 38 now it worked out because it speaks of Mary pondering these things in her heart and that's where we're gonna want to get to Luke 1:37 for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so I want to just look at these thoughts here and we'll try to be just in the mind of the Lord this morning I'm gonna switch over Lydia so we can put the notes on here and just show the notes that was on our hearts to prepare so thank the Lord for His mercy and thank the Lord for His grace we should appreciate the Lord Jesus so I want to look at a few things here let's look at a few quotes on purpose because the way I kinda was led to this message was through studying yesterday and I was looking up serving your purpose on this earth I've been looking on that the purpose series I believe we're on part 19 that's right part 19 and I found this quote about Mary's purpose so brother Branham says like Mary's womb Mary was not the seed and I want to just reference that to you kind of emphasized that today Mary was not this seed but she carried the seed okay in the representation here of the stock so Mary represents the stock brother Branham says she was only a carrier of it like the rest of it but being called and chosen first by God Himself for this purpose now the striking thing that I noticed is that brother Branham throughout this sermon here this is not the one I'll be laboring in but throughout this sermon he said at seven or eight times that Mary was not the word she was the carry of the word and huh me know that your body is not the word your mind isn't even the word the only thing that is the word is your soul amen so that's and so often we just hear your soul is the word yours and that's true and there's so much emphasis on that but if your soul really is the word it'll bring this mind and body into subjection to the word amen that's why Satan in us in us in his spiritual intellection he can admit the word he can believe in God he can believe God's one person not three but his soul you know his being will never be able to be the word right because there's no there's no we'd say manifestation of God in him and like Judas and Balaam and all these ones that were lost there was no seed inside of them and so but you and I believe we're the seed of God and if we are the seed of God then the seed of God will bring everything into subjection to the seed inside of it every thought every action and every desire it'll all be brought into subjection to the Word of God hallelujah and so Abraham says this and he says it over and over again so we'll try to close with that at the end that that we're carriers of the seed of God and you and I can't go we shouldn't go around saying well I'm the word I'm the you are not the word your a portion of the word you are an expression of the word when we Ziff you we say on the word on the word what Satan has tricked us to believe is that we are God we're not God but we're an offspring of God we share his nature but we are not all of his nature only Christ was all of his nature and see that's what Satan's doing today he's trying to get the bride to go one of two directions he knows Satan knows he can't get the bride to go off into the foolish virgin and sin but what he's trying to do is either exalt brother Branham as God or ourselves as God right that's what he's trying to do either one either will exalt brother Branham too high or ourselves too high but the real Christian stays in the middle-of-the-road they're born of the word seat of God and they manifest the word because they bring everything in obedience to the word but they never say I'm all the word or look at me or look how great I am I'm the word noive we look at our care this is just a stalk this this flesh right here just by this just a thin old stock like brother Jose said he said I keep getting thinner every time he hugs me I'm just a thin old stock right this body's gonna die if God Terry's you know I want to live to the rapture but if I don't there'll be a funeral service and the latest stock in the ground but that life inside of me will go back to where it came from amen it'll go back to God the word the full expression of the word but the only way you know that is if I bring this body in this mind and this mouth in the subjection to the word that's the only way you'll know is that I carry the word in my life I carry it to work sorry I character Church a man died I carried the will of God this morning to the house of God and I carried home with me and I manifest the word in my home amen that's the only way you are you and I are carriers and that's God's purpose for Mary that's God's purpose for you that's God's purpose for me that's all of God's purpose for all of us to carry the word there's someone that needs to hear it ain't glory that's right and so there's other quotes I just want to briefly go over it you know Jack Abed brother branham said though Moses was a theologian because he was trained the wisdom of all the learning of Egypt the Egyptians been told by his mother he was called for a purpose so again we see purpose mother connected with purpose right and you would not be here unless your mother chose to carry you full-term right right your mother had added of the purpose she had to know there's a purpose for this whoo this fruit in my in my body there's a purpose for this and I like how Jack Abed caught the spiritual purpose she just didn't catch the physical purpose but she caught the spiritual purpose you're here to bring forth your bring forth Moses and he's going to deliver my people Israel amen I told my mom this morning and I said I said mom I'm sorry I can't be there you know every every holiday I don't get to be with you and he she said something along these lines Jesse that's okay you're called to God's purpose you're called to minister to the people of God amen and I'm thankful that a mother can recognize that that there's certain heartache and and there's certain separation that's hard but it's all done for God's purpose amen and the thing to do is find God's purpose and when you find God's purpose there's peace in knowing God's purpose amen all there are all other avenues where it will cause confusion frustration but God is the author of peace to them who walk in the perfect will of God amen now he says it again here now look he talks about a boy that was healed and look at this he said the young man I don't know who this was but he said the young man there was thrown out of a wreck just recently had a piece of angle iron went plumb through his side sweeping through him and struck the other side like that so this young man had steel or iron go right through his body and come out the other side and brother may have said a dear praying mother God spared him for some purpose why would God let and come through a boy's side and he should have died well God did it because it was going to be a testimony God was going to use the mother to pray for him and then he said since she told me I thought this morning I met him as I come in the hall shook his hands that aren't you the boy and he said yes sir he had a call to the ministry so brother made him show that God spared him because he was called for a purpose he was called to preach the gospel see God be merciful now my brother just a young man sitting with a brown coat may God grant that he will become a flaming light that were at the junction of the road sign to preach the gospel preached the full gospel preached all the Word of God and don't compromise for nothing amen stand right there at the post of duty God will make a great warrior out of them amen so see he had to have a praying mother a mother that would pray say God you've got a purpose for him don't take his life now let him live and then God shows brother man the vision he's going to be a preacher that's his purpose and God used the prayers of a mother and the purpose of Almighty God to work all things out for good because they love the Lord right now look at even brother Bram talks about his purpose in life here he is in Louisville Kentucky he said you know the weakness of man and we know the power of God and I know you'll send your angel the one who separated me from my mother's womb bringing me in this life and has ordained for this purpose so who took what was it them was it the Midwife that took brother Branham out of his mother's womb no he said there was an angel that did that amen how did you get her this morning an angel brought you here hey man how'd you come out of your mother the angel brought you four didn't Paul say when the Lord separated me from my mother's womb there were something spiritual going on but there you were born amen there was something supernatural going on the day you were born God separated you from your mother's womb to do something some purpose for the kingdom of God it's time we found it amen if you don't know yet it's time you found it because motives said I stand here tonight ordained for this purpose and he said I'll make this statement boldly before thousands see when you know your purpose you can stand before hundreds 110 20 and you can boldly declare your purpose in life because God showed it to you amen he's never failed me yet he says and I know that you will not fails tonight but you will grant tonight that every secrets in the heart will be told to the people their diseases when we told them the demons that's binding them why were you born brother Branham to expose Satan that's why I was born so the people could see their sins their diseases their complexes their troubles that's why he was born and he said I'm here by the power of the angel bringing me separating me for this purpose that God's people might be set free amen does God want his people free yes he ordained people just for that purpose to set others free amen hallelujah of course he had to be set free first himself amen and then he knew what it's like to be free and then he could be set free hallelujah now look at this look I love this prayer and everyone will be delivered won't they father well is that so beautiful what a prayer the father isn't everybody going to get delivered this morning is it every going to be everybody gonna be free from their sin won't they father what a request sounds like a child asking his dad for a fish and that's my prayer this morning won't everybody be delivered won't everybody be free from any guilt or shame or sin that's the purpose my purpose in life is the preach the word to feed God's people the Word of God amen everybody's got a purpose he said because we trust you we love you we believe you and ask in your name for your glory hear the prayer of your servant now father we ask it in Jesus name he says it again Oh God my father who separated me from my mother's womb and called me of this purpose ordaining this that I bring this message to the people I was born to bring this message this morning amen you were born to hear this message this morning and then carry the contents of this message into your life amen right and every services like that every every time you eat you take that food and it carries you to the next step the next stage and every time you come to church you hear that word and it carries you to the next position of your life amen if not then we are just hearers of the word and not doers of the word we forget what was preached we forget what we were claiming we forget what we were praying for that's a lot of times when I leave that prayer request sheet right up there on the pulpit I'll step down and we'll have a we'll say our goodbyes and everything but I'll leave it right there because I want to remember what we prayed for and if that helps you remember and you do what you got to do but it's it's wonderful when God answers prayer and then shows us the power of continual prayer just keep offering up to God keep asking keep believing father won't you do it and father says yes I'll do it amen I just want to stretch your patience a little bit I want you to learn how to be more patient I want to add to your temperance patience I want to add a little bit of that to you and all that is church is a further anointing of the Holy Ghost what is the gift of faith what is favorites what is the gift of faith it's an anointing of the Holy Spirit amen and then when you get that anointing a stronger anointing comes amen virtue and knowledge and temperance and God keeps giving you more anointing but whoever said he said the Spirit of God grows inside of you right and so as you receive the word of God it grows and grows and expands it's just a more attribute of the same Holy Spirit that we can go from glory to glory oh my this is a good quote before the foundation world that they might know that thou art the only true God Jesus Christ so I'm bringing the message your day me to bring from my mother's womb to declare to them that before the foundation of the world you're the only God Jesus Christ ah and I stand here Lord tonight around 18 straight nights being led here by the Holy Spirit Oh father of spirit hear my prayer hear my prayers I called you as my physical body is weakening and my strength is sapping from me eighteen days in a row preaching I've never done that mercy there are those here hundreds of them who need of healing God I know that you've sent Jesus Christ to die me wounded for our transgressions and with the stripes we were healed Oh Lord I believe that he said I believe that these people are reaching forward through that Miss yonder on beyond that dark spell over the cloud just beyond the star yonder until their prayers are climbing now around the throne of God are you reaching their church this morning are your prayers reaching higher than this ceiling right here that the brother man said your prayers should reach past the clouds amen plus past the atmospheres past the Milky right way into the very fruit of God amen so our prayers for armando right jose and jason and see his birth pains and amens requested Nathaniel's the miscarriage and his family and these unspoken requests our prayers should reach past that tonight right or this morning they should reach higher we got to reach me on and keep reaching keep reaching out to Jesus amen we must believe it and then Lord is your prophet standing between the living and the dead anointed by the Holy Spirit I go forward to challenge any spirit of doubt that would be here that the children of God might be healed amen he knew he came in here to challenge the evil spirits that were in the congregation yet good people say people may be holy spirit field people but yet through the course of the world demon spirits get on him and he said I was born to challenge these spirits in the name of Jesus Christ oh my you so were you right sisters can have all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit I was telling oh I was out of my office with Victoria Victoria comes up and she's the daddy she said girls can't preach boys preach and I said that's right darling I said that's so true she must overheard us talking about I think I was witnessing to somebody on the phone about how only brothers can preach and I said but guess what I said girls can cast out Devils she's like yeah where is Victoria is she in there okay she'd be a witness she said daddy girls can't preach only boys preach I said but girls can prophesy girls could have gifts of wisdom girls can have gifts of knowledge and she's like yeah daddy yeah daddy and I'm like that so we went in our church amen I've seen the woman casts out a devil before amen it's whatever gift God's place in your life the thing to do though is don't neglect the gift amen because there's a purpose he was toward a angel brought him forth out of the mother's womb for this purpose to challenge demon powers with the authority of Jesus Christ's name Amen hi there and the Bible said every man a woman has a gift of the Holy Spirit that's right now look what he says it's Satan I better finish this cuz this is awesome Satan you who are hanging around here with a question mark across the Word of God see some of us walked in here and we through the struggles of the week we put a big question mark on our Bibles like is this should I even be here does this even make is this even having any impact on my life is it even worth it to come here worshiping and pay my tithes and fellowship with these people is it even worth it I better have said that's what a lot of people do Satan put a question mark you're literally disposed tonight he said you're exposed Satan God has revealed you told you right out who you are what you are you're a liar and a father of a lie and as the Church of God is one of the members of that church has born again by the Holy Spirit and being called in this world to be a prophet and these people have confessed Jesus Christ as our healer and as interceding as a priest amen he's going on every level he's called a board from the womb he's the Prophet he's a preacher now he's the priest he's listing all of his offices Oh may we be able to remember what's on our resume amen what's on your resume a child of God you're born again with eternal life in your soul that's on your resume you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world is that right and now a there I'm commissioned to be a pastor I've got authority in the name of Jesus Christ and not only that I'm a king over this sinful Dominion of my body amen and I'm a priest that intercedes to have it on behalf of God's children to cast out devils and rebuke evil spirits in Jesus Christ authority so just as he went through all this resume list the resume you and I need to do the same thing it will build your faith if you start saying the devil I'm a king I'm a priest I'm a child of God I'm more than a conqueror you start listing what you are and they'll start raising your faith amen you'll be like that Eagle knocking his beak on there to knock off all the the dried up say coldness of his spiritual life is that right and your strength will be renewed like an eagle amen thank you Lord and I'm standing between the living the dead if it was brother I'm taking this service lightly should we take any service lightly no I'm trying to intercede I'm trying to feed some days I'm trying to cast demons out some days I'm just trying to encourage amen some days I'm trying to bring healing by the power of God some days I'm trying to save and baptize them whatever God's will would be we don't know until we get here but we stand between the living in the dead we stand between demons and angels and we must be intercessors for the glory of God and the sister can do it a sister can stand there and be a priest and intercede for others he said and I say in the name of Jesus Christ Satan I break your powers Hey and leave this building in the name of Jesus Christ turn every one of them loose come out Satan leave them now you cannot look at this you can hear the screaming now you on the cots and stretchers and the chairs rise up you that sick and afflicted there they are awake walking up the crippled afflicted going heals he said stand up and that's where the sermon ends look at this mighty rebuke but he had to raise up the faith of the people and say I was born for this I was commissioned for as a prophet I'm a king I'm a priest I'm a preacher of all these things and then it raised the faith of the people and then he rebukes Satan and Satan has to leave and the cripples walk amen and so we need to see if there's no physical cripples here then let's have some spiritual cripples get their strength back amen and live the right kind of spiritual life before God hey man glory now let's look at a few quotes here now before we get to this so I'm gonna start getting into my youth message I'm gonna preach a morning service there Michigan and then the youth of the tri-state youth meeting next Sunday night I don't know what time that is but I'm gonna preach a little bit to them see every time we gather church were gathered in the name of Jesus Christ and we have to see what the Holy Spirit is leading us to now I mentioned this a few weeks ago when we were preaching on the number 40 and brother Graham said Jesus went through 40 days of temptation right and but I said no man could be tempted harder than Jesus in fact I read it he said he was tempted above any man that ever could be tempted and how do you overcome by quoting the word policy there was quote the word and I was telling you how I you know even my sister went to the Louisiana camp meeting I think sister Wendy went as well my sister went there with her husband and the children and what a wonderful time they had and I always listened those and since 2014 they put it online I always listened to brother Donnie and the brother Ron and different ones like that and so I wanted to see like what is the word that they're hearing down there that they come back so powerful and on fire right what's the word you know here we're trying to rebuke Satan we're charge to cast out devils and do all these things and we hear about that going on there but that should be done in every single church service it's needed it shouldn't be limited to just camp meetings or youth meetings so I want to try to encourage the youth the next Sunday night there in Michigan I want to try to encourage them that if they didn't make the youth meeting there there's still a fountain of youth meeting that's open every time the doors are open there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins amen and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains amen there's the phone of youth open every service amen and you're looking at a preacher who never went to Louisiana camp meeting right I never went to the Switzerland meeting I never went to the Texas meeting I never went to the main meeting you can name any say Ohio family camp I never went to any that but I had been to the Fountain of Youth amen hey I didn't make it to any youth camp but I made it to the Fountain of Youth I burned the Christ and confess all my sin and say fill me with the Holy Spirit any day they met so I've got eternal youth a portion of the Lord inside of me are you with me so one encouraged a youth with that and so I listened to all the sermons from this Louisiana camp and I just want to just remind some of the I just want to rehearse you some of the great revelations that came out of that but also lets you know it's the same thing we preach here it's the same thing they preach in Lima the same thing they preach in Napoleon is that right amen the same thing brother Brooks preaches in Iowa praise God it might come a little different thought or a little different Channel but it all boils down to one thing having the anointing of God on you with the sword of the Spirit slay the demon and stand victorious just like Christ innately it all boils down to that because you will never have a harder battle than what Christ had after that 40 days of temptation will you know it's impossible so how did he overcome you overcome by the word right this isn't the sermon loose him and let him go brother Glover preach this and see I like how it's the noise of the Holy Spirit he said it's time to put your shoulder behind our pastors you realize your pastor needs you he says I was listenin to my glory he said but this is an age that doesn't want accountability they don't want to be accountable he said did you know you can give a pastor a breakthrough while he's preaching just by getting in the same Holy Spirit as the pastor listen do you want to see people bound here in their sins bound in their frustration bound in their fear bound in their discouragement or do want to see them set free what do you want to see so all's you gotta do is get in the Holy Spirit will set people free today raise god I mean if that is that simple right if if I'm in the sphere and you're in the spirit and we're all in the Holy Spirit what demon can stand before the Holy Spirit and he promised if two or three so Jesse and his wife and somebody else is in church there he is right in the midst of them amen glory we got a lot more than that this morning thank the Lord so his first climax was that the stone of Lazarus grave so the stone is like an addiction and yet he was Lazarus was able to hear the voice of the resurrection despite that stone being there and he said about 500 young people should come out of their graves he said Satan I rebuke you I said I rebuke you he left he said come up and let these young people come forth out of the grave so you if people feel like they're spiritually dead that stone it's like their addiction it's keeping them from coming out but the voice of God is so powerful if you hear God's voice speaking you today then you can come out and you can have new life in the name of Jesus Christ there's no stone like we preached on Easter there's no Roman seal there's no Jewish seal there's no seal that can keep the Word of God from coming to pass so that was the first major climax the second one he said Lazarus was standing before Jesus in grave clothes he has to be loose to worship so once you get life he says once you're alive and you're out from the grave you're serving God he said you need to be loose so you can worship he says your past is behind you your death is behind you and when you've been loose like Lazarus grave crows were behind him he said every filthy spirit is behind you you're free to worship he said Lazarus was free to praise God I wonder if we could praise God this morning well you can if your grave clothes are behind you right but if you're still bound up when your grave clothes bound up in your sin your condemnation your guilt you can't really worship God I mean like that thought good thought fast forward to the last service but that service was called another paradox and it ends with the great climax brother man told a story he ends it with Esther how Esther had to go before the king and the way she lived is that he put the scepter out toward remember that remember she was going to die she said but I'll die if I die die right but let me see the scepter right and so after we know got the scepter and then the brother connected it to a story brother ran told in recognizing your danis message he said brother man was talking about carrying this message to the world and he said there's a story one time of a king and all of his servants were busy so he handed his scepter to the boy and said you've got to deliver this message take the scepter with you and don't stop until you deliver the message and Votan said that was the type of him he's got the king's scepter he's got the Kings word and he's just got to he just has to run with the message don't stop for anybody just run with the word hallelujah and it brought up such a worship and revelation is that right and the encouraging thing for us is to remember if you've got the word it's like having the Kings Authority and you don't stop to talk to any demon you don't stop to compromise you don't stop to question the you carry the word and you don't stop until you get there the trouble is people will take up late of the world and they can't run like they ought to run are you with me so the whole the whole climax was this take the word run with it lay any sin beside and run the race with perseverance now does that sound like something we've never heard before or is that just a fresh take on a true revelation that's true that's just a fresh take on the familiar revelation we've got to lay every sin aside so the young people can be encouraged but that same message they're going to get back to their local church and they're going to need that same message in a different channel a different story a different scripture but the the battle is all the same die to sin and obey the Word of God walk in the spirit and do not satisfy the lusts of the flesh it's the same battle the greatest battle ever fought it may come in different channels but it's the same story it's obeying the Word of God and God will bless you oh [Music] thank you Lord and I've known two people that have gone Louisiana camp-meeting shouted screamed danced spoke in tongues came both came back saying that the Holy Ghost one of them lived it for a while but then pretty soon bitterness caught their heart and they ended up have a little family and divorce and now live it with another person in adultery Church whatever they got there might have been a great blessing but that was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism the Holy Ghost keeps you from sin when you get the Holy Ghost you're a new creature in Christ Jesus amen the old things have passed away adultery is passed away but faithful manners are faithful a marital faithfulness that is the new creature and that's what you live because you've got life to do it the second one married their own person the person beat on her the person did drugs molested children did all these kind of things and then she herself got addicted to cigarettes and and movies and hardly go to the house of God and yet both came back from a camp me saying I'm born again so the reason I'm telling you this is not to make people look bad or to make you try to figure out who it is don't worry about who it is but worry about your life be concerned am i manifesting the life of Christ am i carrying the word or my just carrying a temporary anointing we got to carry the eternal Word of God it's going to be more than just on our flesh and on our minds it's got to be your nature it's going to be a part of you and you've got power to overcome every single day amen Larry and after after I listened to all those sermons I wonder I wonder if my nieces I saw him shouting on the tape I wonder if they're shouting in the church this morning in other words did that shouting continue do they still shout at the word or is the word you know and you can apply to anybody that was there now we all go through trials but what I'm saying is if you love the word at a youth meeting then you should love the word at your home church in fact the brother said this can I give you one word of advice he said when you get home and the fire is not there and brother Donnie's not running across the pulpit he said the God that was with you when you got prayed for is the God that will be with you when you get home he said at home it's time to manifest what you got amen I didn't know yeah that's why I'm not big on sending out our children to camp meetings because I didn't get the Holy Ghost at a camp meeting I got it at the fountain of youth as I said I got in the presence of Christ and no one brother Amen says I got the Holy Ghost in 2003 no one's had to bake me push me encourage me to do anything for God well because there's a living water inside of me that's pushing me our YouTube views are approaching 1 million so in those in the anointing God's given me almost 1 million people have had a chance to hear this word of God amen and I know fewer of you are gonna receive it so I'm not expecting more testimonies attacks although I wish there was mercy but see this is the reality of the Word of God I like what he said he was preaching on the scepter I love what he said he said he said when I get to my home church he said when I come home and I don't fall asleep through the service show them the scepter in other words show them this is why I don't fall asleep in church anymore because I've got the Word of God is that right that's what he said I could show dia he said will they believe me and he said if people won't believe you show them the word in other words show them the Word of God that you're running with God purposed me to be a preacher so I've been running like a preacher Amen if God purpose you to be a mother you run like a mother you run with that don't let anything hold you down you run with God's scepter you run with the way don't let anything compromise on anything praise God and I think the people I think the young people need to hear that don't you we if we're not careful we make like it could be well if I go to this church here in Canada or if I go in Tennessee it's like I'm going on my spiritual Mecca right I got to go on my message Mecca if I don't go there I'll never I'll never feel as holy as I ought to that's a lie being in Christ is not being in a physical place being in Christ is being baptized with the Holy Ghost is that right Church don't get me wrong God may use a camp-meeting God may use that brothers Church that new brother bram God may use that but the reality of it is is that that is why God sent the Holy Ghost so you know what the go anyplace you're just gonna die to yourself amen and he can meet you anytime any place anywhere haha that's right to see all these major points all the dollars just hearing the word dying out being free from sin free from this free from that temptation and just obeying God with the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's what all this is about are you with me last night I'm gonna preach to the youth I know what I'm going to preach to the congregation it's gonna be the zeal of the Lord willing unless he changes it the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up because I believe I can help their church maybe to strengthen their their home church and you if you've been here even listen to me what the Holy Spirit's been giving me it's about it's all about us taking advantage of what's happening right now not overlooking these services not dying and getting cold and back siding not missing our time to redeem a man this is our time like Jason email me he caught that on the sermon I appreciate that brother Jason he caught it last week if we don't redeem it in a certain time it's lost if we don't redeem our first little it'll be lost we have a space to repent and God help us to repent amen you got that I appreciate that now God is merciful Church God is very merciful and that's why we appreciate the Lord but there's a point where God says okay that's fine then he knows that person will never seek it again that's why we got to be constantly seeking more of the Lord everybody with me now I told you I just got to preach that I tried to preach it last week about ran out of time right here on my notes I had my papers all ready to go I just couldn't get to it I got to warm up a little bit now I'm gonna skip here a little bit so I get to the end of this message brother branham tells the story of Mary's the belief remember she was a carry of the word and the church said she was not the word when she was a carrier of the word and so are you you're a carrier of the word your reflects benefice but you were not all he talks about other spring was rising hi new Jayden skies as they she started the street that morning with the water pot underarm and her little youthful mind was thinking of the day before how at the synagogue where she and her spouse husband had sit and listen to his sermon from the rabbi so Mary went to church on the Sabbath a lot of our friends don't know why and how in his talk he had explained to the people why they were selling that land that had been a promise that God had made their father Abraham hundred years before they should hurt the land and how it went got it made a promise he could not go back on that promise and that they come through the Red Sea as on dry ground and how that before that God had taken them on the hands the enemy and God loves to take his children out of the hands the enemy let me read that again I don't know if everybody heard me and God loves to deliver the Saints that bride of Jesus Christ from the enemy amen he loves it he loves it he's proved it in the way he did little Ricky now this is a part I don't get to this I don't have the courts up here but do you remember that story where brother BAM said a baby was dying of cancer its head was twice the size of its normal size and the man gave brother man tithing and he said well I'm gonna give it back to you because you need it for your medical bills and the man said no program said I feel led to pray for Ricky he said I went there I prayed for Ricky and he said he said Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I placed the blood of Jesus Christ between you Satan and this child and then he left he just let it go and then at this sermon you can hear they bring Ricky up on stage a man and he's going in God he's seven eight months here or seven eight eight eight months old and he's good and God and brother man said look he proved it there and just after a matter of a few days the cancer died and it vanished and Ricky was brought to the meetings and Votan said let's offer God a prayer of thanksgiving like we did with Jason the Lord answered Jason's prayer thank you Lord we don't want to be ungrateful like the lepers right the nine lepers we want to be grateful if God does suffer me I want to come and thank him and give him praise as they thank you Jesus you provided amen in every season you've been with me amen you've never forsaken me you've never left me you always been merciful you've always been gracious and you answer my prayer he said you took them from the hand of the enemy and by great signs and wonders and fed them in the wilderness for forty years and they came out of wareness a 40-year journey not a feeble one among them even their clothes and it wear her down what a great God that they had and neither do our clothes we're done I'm talking about the white robe that you got I'm talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that eternal life you got that's the seed of God that I'm talking about that row doesn't wear out amen now look they were little they said the sermon got ruined by the rabbi and I hope you don't leave Church saying well the sermon was good until brother Jesse ruined it I sure hope that doesn't get happen today hey god help me but at the end of the message he ruined what he had been talking about when he said those great days of Jehovah dealing with people like that it wasn't necessary no more they become settled down in their homeland they didn't exactly need miracles no more they had good doctors for their sickness were just certainly all right and they had had a they were better off that their they had their homes I just didn't need god of miracles anymore what a slick devil that was to start the sermon really good but then close with the wrong idea and Mary Joseph resisted there it was a good message until he ruined it at the end he said God doesn't want to visit the message people anymore he only did those things in the days of brother Moses I mean brother Branham right and he said it ruined he said but somehow that didn't satisfy the thirst and hunger of Jos America you see they were engaged to be married soon Oh God may God help me not to ruin this sermon - today by God's grace to let you know that Jesus Christ is here just like he is anywhere else this morning and he's not a guy that used to do miracles he still does miracles you believe that you and I can't produce it we can't work him up we got to wait till he says so and be faithful until he does it might be 25 years it doesn't matter how long it is you and I just need to be faithful standing in faith believing all the Word of God crossing on anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God stand there like a soldier until God comes on the scene as the custom was after the service is over why they would go home and with her sometimes their home for where their home was just over the hill where Joseph the carpenter was building a special little house you know it had to have that special touch to it because it was the one he was going to bring his little bride to the doors had to be just perfect the windows had to be plumb for that was where he spent his time with his little wife and after the new meal they were gone the front porch perhaps and look across towards a little home and dream at the time when they would be together happy living at their house and how the roses would be around the windows and so forth then on this certain Sunday afternoon Joe said this seems to be a strange day and Mary said you know since I heard the rabbi say that this great God that brought us here and made us what we are that he doesn't have to do the things like first now like he did then I've been thinking for a long time that if this God was as great in the days of our fathers as he was the days of our grandfathers then wising just the same great God today in other words something that preacher said stayed with me from yesterday and I God I hope that happens today amen I hope something good I say today by God's leading not mine stays with you and you think about it tomorrow amen but see this is the kind of believer Mary was but he meant she ponder she is heard - where she just didn't let it go out she pondered these things in her heart I'm going to go home after church and I'm gonna do this this is that but Joseph Mary said I'm gonna go home after church I'm gonna sit on a little swing and we're looking across at our future home that's what we need to do is look to our future home amen and talk about the sermon line that was a wonderful message that the Holy Spirit preached today it wasn't really density because it was discerning my thoughts and the word is the discerner of the thoughts and tents of the heart amen I like what she does next though that's only good thinking and she goes back in the house and said we'll just read some CNN and want some true love stories no he said we'll read some of the scriptures wouldn't we be closer to God if he read the Bible after church amen praise the Lord and just wherever God will lead us and she picked up the scroll of Isaiah just right where God wanted it and she goes over to Isaiah 9:6 where it says unto us to soar and the son is born unto us a child is given and she looks over with her lovely soft eyes and said to her husband to me Joseph what do you think the Prophet was speaking of her notice she didn't preach at her husband she didn't tell her husband what it was all about she said what see what she's mean she's being submissive like a woman should be praise the Lord they recognized what other preachers off a little bit but let's go to the Word of God maybe word of God's got our answer amen I like that why Mary I believe that he would speak of the Messiah that it is to come and that's why that we could keep our bloodstream clean and don't mix with other nations because someday God's going to send that Messiah among us huh what appropriate scripture to read for that occasion this is why we stay holy this is why we only marry Christians right because we're trying to produce a godly generation that's going to take the rapture when the Messiah comes for the second time we don't yoke ourselves unequally we they yoke with Christians amen she was thinking on this as she went along the side of the street real early the Sun was rising and she was going out the public well to get her daily supply water usually the women come just a little later to get the water but Mary somehow she was led to go early that morning when she'd be all by herself sometimes you're led to do things just all by yourself sometimes you're led to do things a little out of ordinary and says she walked along thinking on these things she felt a strange feeling around her and you know it's usually when we're thinking about God and keeping our minds on God that God comes down to us I remember one time you got healed of her arm trouble she couldn't lift her arm I remember that morning I was going to preach on something else and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit brought that thought the keys to the kingdom I'm like well I must be crazy I'm gonna change my sermon two hours before church so anyways I go preach it she comes up for healing and said well it's still hurtful she left but when she got home she started cooking dinner she said she felt the power of God and she raised her arm and she was healed right then and there sometimes it comes a little differently praise God so he got to be open to how God might move differently but we got to be walking in the spirit amen thinking about the word that was preached thinking about the scripture that we read after the church service Oh bro Jessie after the sermon I'm done I get to go back to my regular life well you need to get saved then because when you're Christian that's all you want to do is meditate on the things of God you don't have to separate lives you got one life faith there's not two lies there's one of that I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus I think it's one of the great troubles of the people this day we have too many other things in our mind even when we come to the healing service we seem to think well I did not get a prayer card tonight or perhaps I'll not be prayed for we will never be able to accomplish much as long as we keep those kind of thoughts this Angeles Temple is thirsting for an outbreak of the Holy Spirit not only that but the whole United States are you are you part of United States you should say yes speaking is speaking of the Christian realm is waiting for revival in our time look at brother Ram alludes to this is in 1959 and I believe that God has already let it happen so but Ram said the revivals already started what the revival of the bride Amen he said and we're just so pushing it somewhere else so Pentecost was pushing it somewhere else and if we're not careful message churches will push the Holy Ghost revival somewhere else oh we don't want to draw closer to God we just want to do ours we just want to get through life and have a easy life in South living we got to be hungry and thirsting for righteousness until he'll pass over us and our time of grace will be gone I heard a sermon on that this week it really blessed me it was out of James where it says what is your life remember those words what is your life those four words what is your life and James said it's like a vapor it's here today gone tomorrow what is your life it didn't ask what is life because we'd say oh that's God's Spirit what does he turn alive and it has what what is God's - and that's that it said what is Jose's life what is brother Aaron's life what is brother Jesse's life what is your life what is your life your life is a vapor and it's going to be used as short and it's going to be used somewhere how we're using the life that God gave us what is your life it's to be a carrier of the word hey that is to serve God's purpose on this earth to carry the word what is your life your life I'm not talking my my life what's your life what is it is it an offering unto God is it a selfish thing for yourself something trying to save and and do something good for yourself or is it an offering and sacrifice unto God Almighty what is your life I hope you don't see it as your life I hope you see it as God's life amen what did I do Ceri hey Siri turn off no I just turned on my series sorry oh mercy there we go live it was always you know it was always the microphone zapping remember that well no one here would remember that well others have a mic going off in the middle of the service okay let's move on from that it kind of meant use that shake everybody up and now we got our phones blue go he says this see we can't fill our minds with these thoughts now let's be positive in our thinking let's believe that this night this revive will break in Angeles temple tonight let's believe this is the night that God will do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could do or think he will do tonight don't take no for an answer it's when we think of those things you create an atmosphere around you now we've all heard us a hundred times you create a atmosphere well who came to create an atmosphere this morning I'm not going to raise your hands but who did who came here and your thought was I'm gonna create an atmosphere today God is gonna do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask your thing or does only happen when brother bender odd comes or brother cam what what is our what is our life what are we thinking of this shouldn't just take place at a special meeting this should be every time we're gathered in the name of Jesus Christ you're supposed to create an atmosphere here I wish he would close his big yapper already is it time to go to Panera yet we gotta be careful of our attitudes we're supposed to be craters we're supposed to have a portion of God inside of us we're supposed to be living for other people see like we said with those two those two schools making brother branham God are making the bride God why could only oh we gotta have a big revival for the bride and then God will come down all the bride's got to be gather together special meetings main churches people men that knew the prophet of God or just play the tape and then the Spirit of God see making everything else the atmosphere instead of you and I creating the atmosphere putting the responsibility well let brother man do it no we gotta let the big group do it you and I have to do it it's yours it's my responsibility your responsibility to redeem the time and it will always be that way when she was thinking on this her eyes raised up she thought she saw a light I'm gonna skip ahead he said well is there something and she goes on turns a corner starting up towards the public well she drops a little hand again imposed a little shawl over shoulders and she went about the way thing of what does Isaiah 9:6 mean if I can say it like this you and I one day be walking along by the Amen and we'll be thinking about the word what does the voice mean what does first Thessalonians 4:17 we know what the shout means what is the voice me what is the voice and then maybe we'll hear a voice of cry well here's some shout out or some angelic something and pretty soon we'll see st. Paul or brother branham hey I wonder what the Trump of God means and pretty soon was here a Trump blowing and our bodies to be swallowed up in life and will rise up to meet Christ in the air see we've got to be meditating upon God's Word and the scripture that we need to fulfill that's when the Holy Spirit came a virgin shall conceive and she didn't seem to think I'm the virgin it's me God chose me that's the purpose of my life God or they need to manifest Isaiah 9:6 God ordained me to manifest 1st Corinthians 4:17 how do they chose me to be in the rapture Amen T when God put something on somebody's heart he's ready to do something that's the reason he's ready to give the angelus temple an outbreak of the Spirit because it's on your hearts see if we want to revive with our church here we want to see people healed it's got to be on our hearts first and who's going to put it on your heart the Holy Spirit but you've got to let them put it up in your heart as you before you come to church and then when you come to church it'll be on your heart then you have a burden to create an atmosphere so God can move here but not only here but moving other places move everywhere amen the third pole and no name use the third pole it was out there a couple of times it was up here you know speaking the word and then bringing back life you know from brotherwe but most of it was out there so we need to know that God can move anywhere so we must be ready at all times and seasons instant in season out of season that's why we tell those young people we we got to be instant see a lot of people just get like I said those two people they just get ready for God at the camp-meeting time but we got to be ready for God at all times oh boy I'm really gonna be on fire for I get back by they men from the camp meeting I should be on fire every service if now I'm a rebuke to Christianity is that right or I'm just struggling I need God's mercy I need God's deliverance that's right he says in wash you raise her head again she just remember brought her shawl over she raised her head again and I just she that he said I just love to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit it just gives that blessed assurance you don't always have to see it it's there anyhow and as she moved along she raised her head and there stood this great light before perhaps the same pillar fire the LED children of Israel come walking from the light came the great Archangel Gabriel said Hail Mary hail means to stop blessed art thou among women hard tell the other woman went to the well that morning perhaps thinking about the wash and they had to do some tasks I'm society in the church they had to take care of but Mary was thinking on the scriptures was not at Cleophus and his friend on the first resurrection morning as they were walk thinking on the scriptures when Jesus appeared to them I hope you came to church thinking on Jesus today let me try to close now this is I love this I don't you probably heard us before I if I had I forgot it program said and she saw this great angel it started the little version she stopped she came closer to her and saluted her and gave her a message that was a hard message for that child to receive for she wasn't nothing but a girl she's probably about Lydia's age Lydia's 14 I think remember said she might have been 16 Mary might have been 16 years old so think about Lydia and God gave her something to believe that was more outstanding and hard to believe than anything he'd ever did look at God God had such confidence in a hundred year old Abraham that he gave him the hardest thing to believe ever no no he gave he gave Abraham a hard thing to believe but the hardest thing he ever gave anybody believed was a 16 year old virgin girl that liked to sit after church and talk about the word and say well I enjoyed that sermon oh I can't wait to get to my future home hubby and that going to be wonderful hey let's read the Bible amen Oh God to reveal it to her God could reveal the body shake say you and I man we just knotted meditate upon the Word of God God said I'm going to choose some great soldier I'm going to choose some great warrior of the faith to do something I've never done before and he chooses a little girl like Lydia he bypassed the preacher the rabbi of course he was back slidden already preaching dog God could never do anything God can't move and our church services he can only move at Jeffersonville you know that you got to play the tape you do need to play the tape at your home you do you listen to it no he chose he bypassed everyone and went to a little humble virgin little girl because he knew she meditated upon the Word of God and here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened before in church let me say like this you might be reading that but listen we have to believe something that's never happened before God's never raptured a large group of people off the earth that never died before he raptured Abraham and Sarah but they'd already died so he's doing something he's asking you and I to believe something that's never happened before that we never have to die that we can bypass natural death we can bypass spiritual death and we can be swallowed up in life and have a glorified body hallelujah and we never have to taste that all because Jesus already tasted death for us amen and it wasn't because Mary was somebody special it's just that she was in the right lineage and her character met all God's requirements I'm glad I'm in the right lineage where'd you come from I came out of Christ amen I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world oh thank you Lord and I watch her she didn't question that she said behold the handmaid of the Lord be done to me according to thy word now I'm gonna close in just a moment Harpreet about an hour and a half here but let me get to this I want to look at these few thoughts I didn't get a chance to develop them all the way but brother Adam said each person needs to be anointed if we want to see God move yes each person has to bring an anointing like brother cam said in heavenly places create an atmosphere each person has to be anointed let me show it to you I think I got it way up here at the top yeah your dish program says so you say let's let the preacher do it this is an individual ferret's every one of us the preacher might do it himself he might praying at his so blessed which I did thank the Lord and stay on afternoon under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to walk in the prints of his congregation anointed feeling the power of God but unless that congregation has stayed in the same way see it makes a difference he's got to get it the congregation under condition but then if the congregation is ready to meet the Holy Spirit then I'll tell you sinners will weep their way to Calvary if we can just take it as an individual you're just as responsible as any of those ministers God's gonna hold you as an individual responsible and let me share this few weeks ago I was laying on my face here and I said Lord I'm laying my palms like they did on the on the the good with a good Sunday well Palm Sunday I said as they lay their palms here I'm laying my palms here let the King ride in and that was the morning that sister hua got the Holy Ghost she came up for prayer didn't seem like she got it we close service I went in there is it okay that I tell us I hope so cause I already started it's gonna be hard to finish it unless you give me permission well my daughter Lydia comes in there said daddy I want to pray for the Holy Ghost I said oh glory well something happened when we joined hand all four of us join hands one two three and Lydia for as that happened you we felt it something came in the room and our sister started crying shouting and praising God and you do something happen there amen now her life is going to vindicate it now just like my life had just like your life has been vindicated as well but brother said when you get the Holy Ghost something has to happen to you amen you don't get the Holy Ghost being dead and driving stiff and starchy you've got to come in and if you get the Holy Spirit sinners were weak delayed at Calvary outside this sanctified ones will weep their way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man so you just never know which morning it's gonna be so you got to be prepared prepared every season you got to come prepared anointed every time because you don't know whether it's in season right I didn't know she was seeking the Holy Ghost that way I didn't know when a man was seeking the Simon and I know when a man was seeking the Holy Ghost that week glory but the children of God are ready in season and out of season no matter what season is I'm always in season by the baptism of the Holy Ghost bori and that's what happened we laid our palms down here and the King rode into the church thank the Lord that he wrote in I said Hosea and save our sisters fill them with the Holy Ghost Hosea blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord amen hallelujah I'm glad to brother and I think it was your prayer or our faith altogether I think it was combining your faith with her faith everyone's faith I think it was putting all of our faith together that did that don't you I was think about that yesterday it took it when she and I prayed our just faith was enough we needed more faith we need more power hey Laurie amen see it just took more than my anointing more than her night it took more 90 we all got to believe we all need an anointing of the Holy Spirit Laurie let me try to find a place to close here now for most of your requests you need a revelation before you can when you brood war you can accept it right but man tells us and works his faith Express you say he said you can quote the word all the time for healing but you've got a but God has to reveal it to you that it's over so if everything were so with many many things and blessings from God you need a revelation first that it's for you because Paul said three times give him give me my eyesight you memorize like God said no so divine healing you need to see God to know if it's God's will to heal you but let me tell you it is God's will to save you and fill you with the Holy Ghost do not let the devil tell you where I can never get saved children the only thing I will tell you that it is God's will to save you the Bible said God would that all men be saved how do new you you know the wonder does God want to save me or my serpent seed don't have you with the devil don't listen to him it is God's will to save you the Bible says so it's not saith the Lord and it's just up to you whether you receive it or not you say well I'm saying but I just feel like I'm the foolish version well guess what it's God's will to make you the bride as well oh you don't believe that do you okay okay well let's go to the Bible there nation 2200 you don't believe that oh you should it's God's will to give you the Holy Ghost well I'm just ordained to be a foolish virgin my whole life nonsense nonsense God just don't want to give it to me God wants to give it to you more than you wanted amen hallelujah it's God's will if that's not the case then Judas will be able to say God you wouldn't saved me I wanted to be saved I wanted to be filled with the Holy Ghost but you wouldn't give it to me and God would be guilty of his breaking of his own loss no God wanted Judas to be saved God wanted Judas be filled the Holy Ghost but he chose to be the son of perdition is that right we know the scripture where it says in 1st Timothy that all God would that all men be saved well guess what revelation 22 has the same idea for the baptism of Holy Ghost God desires everyone to have the baptism the Holy Ghost but only the elect will receive it that's right look at verse 6 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in these churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright morning star and the spirit and the bride say is it the brides will or whose will is it it's the Holy Spirit's will and the bride's will let all the bride members come to this fountain of living waters amen and him that here they let him that here say come and let him there's a thirst they come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely amen God is inviting everybody to be a wise virgin but only the left only those that God predestinated will actually receive it so if you're not saved you have a right to say it is God's will I don't need a revelation to know that God wants to save me he already said he wanted to save you is that right Church God would that oh man well I'm one of those I'm all of mankind I'm all God would that I be saved oh well God doesn't want me to drink of the waters of life really the Bible just said let whosoever come to the waters of life freely are you with me Church let's stand to our feet I better stop right here you don't need a revelation as far as what does God want to fill me with the Holy Ghost he's already invited you to partake of Living Waters he's already invited you to the New Jerusalem he has to give that invitation to everyone is that right if not they can say whoa you didn't invite me no the spirit and the bride say come come come drink of this waters of life it's for everybody but because of it's for knowledge he can predestiny all the events where all the children of God will fully come he's going to make sure actually he made sure you heard the message of the hour oz raised in Pentecostal Trinitarian unholiness church but God made sure that I heard the message to the caller amen is he new I wanna come I don't want to drink of live not deaf I want to partake of eternal life amen I want to be a carrier of the word see some truce of God are for everyone it's God's will that you be saved it's God's will that everyone who wants to come can come to the baptism Holy Ghost does everybody understand so we can't let's say and say well it's not for you you see God didn't Phil you know God's waiting for you to die out that's what we're taught acts 5:32 says God gives the Holy Ghost to them that disobey Him no to those that obey Him the trouble is people disobey God they say they want to be born again with them they disobey the Word of God sorry doesn't work that way you can't serve two masters you got to serve one or the other you want Delilah or you are Jehovah where's your new hood we want Jesus Christ that's how the musicians come I preach about an hour and a half thank you for your patience it went fast there's only one service today hope you brought the anointing let's see you've got to do anything here this morning surely he's already fed your soul right you believe that you've already fed on the super supernatural spiritual things of God let's see if God wants to move let me remind the church that sisters even sisters even brothers and our preachers if you feel led to pray somebody follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit if you feel led to pray for somebody or you got a word for somebody you feel free to give it I don't want to be a ruining rabbi that ruins the service and say well God can't use you no God can't use you he can only use me that's a nickel a demonic spirit God can use a nine-year-old or your God can use a 14-year old fat got always often chooses the humble who are rich in faith man once looked at man well good luck brother Jesse do it brother man says everyone needs the anointing everyone do you feel his presence this morning I feel a sacred presence this morning and listen I want to feel that every time I'm in the house of God because I know he invited me to
