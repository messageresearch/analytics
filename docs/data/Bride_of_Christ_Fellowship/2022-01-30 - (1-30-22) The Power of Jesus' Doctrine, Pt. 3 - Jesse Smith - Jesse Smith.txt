========================================

let's go to saint john chapter 18 this morning appreciate those songs how many want to fly on the wings of faith praise god the word of god says it and spoken to us we'll believe it and that power of god's already in it praise god if we just receive it the power of god will lift us up praise god for the word is power amen john chapter 18 verse 18. i'd like to continue on this thought on the power of jesus's doctrine i believe it's a very needful subject and i think you do too so we're thankful for god's grace i'd like to i got a few slides here so i'd like to show some of those just a moment john 18 verse 18 we'll read 18-20 [Music] john 18 18-20 of course this is christ he was recently arrested on the night judas betrayed him and he's being questioned in the house of the high priest caiaphas and notice here how he he tells the high priest and all the all those that are having him on trial notice what he says when they ask him about his doctrine notice what he says so john 18 verse 18. i'll read 18-19 then we can all read verse 20 together so i'll read 18 myself and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself i'll read verse 19 the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine so think about that when the word gets put on trial why is the word on trial because the unbelievers disagree with the doctrine and remember this is going to repeat again this is still repeating today because the bible says the sinners crucify the son of god afresh they're constantly crucifying the effects of the holy spirit and the effects of the holy spirit come through the doctrine praise god hopefully hopefully you saw that last sunday morning and wednesday night because you have to have teaching first you have to tell the people the way to get the anointing the way to get god's blessings so the teaching comes first and then the power flows after you're taught the word of god amen let's all read verse 20. can we one two three jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing amen we'll get back to this here uh towards the middle of the sermon but let's bow our heads for a word of prayer if you have an e on your heart just make it known unto god god sees all the needs god knows all things as humans we know very little we're very limited but the almighty god is here hallelujah we've worshipped him we've sang to him we prayed to him we confessed our sins to him we've given him honor and glory we prayed for the sick we prayed for all the needs of the church and now lord god we just come to you in prayer so heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity lord god we're here in thanksgiving we're grateful lord for another opportunity to be in your house the house of prayer it's also a house of worship it's also a house of teaching and instruction and it's a house of miracles praise god hallelujah thank you god for your your mercy and your love lord god to us today anoint me lord anoint your people father we stand in need of you uh lord and we stand obeying your your promises lord we stand obeying your your commands lord god to come and assemble together more as we see that day approaching and lord with the promise that you will perfect us you'll bring us to completion and so god we thank you for it lord i pray you'll minister to each and every heart and receive all the glory honor and praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so i'm going to pick up a little bit on what i was saying last sunday uh as i preach there for my house i have a few things i skipped past there i just want to briefly review a little bit here so last sunday we basically looked at all the scriptures about jesus and doctrine we looked at all them and then as i uh studied this week i thought oh yeah that's right i need to look up the words that mean or all the words about jesus with teaching and talked those two words and so that's what i preached on wednesday night i just started that wednesday night we'll finish it today lord willing um and so we looked at uh jesus's doctrine and we showed how preaching is different from doctrine preaching is declaring what god has done and what god will do that's preaching so when you hear preachers say god is going to heal you god is going to do miracles that's preaching the word of god now when they start telling you how to possess those promises now we're getting into teaching for example uh jesus's disciples couldn't cast out a devil they said how come this devil's not going out he said because only some kind go out through prayer and fasting so see jesus had to teach them these deeper concepts so they can uh enjoy the benefits or the anointing of the holy spirit so hopefully everybody can understand that brother branham says he also tells us as well if we want to be healed by god the bible says confess your faults one to another so when we're teaching about divine healing we have to teach first first confess all your sins first make everything right then believe the promise of god but we can't expect to be anointed and have the blessing of god if we haven't kept the promises and obeyed the steps to receive the blessing just like on the day of pentecost my wife shared with this one with me good thought they said men and brother what shall we do how are we going to possess the holy ghost and peter gave him doctrine he said repent every one of you and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see teaching always comes first right unless god specifically wants to show someone a miracle right like he hi like he healed the blind man without teaching him first you know there's different times god will just do miracles out of his grace and out of his mercy but many times with the gospel we have to teach people uh we all of us need to all right i need talk we all need talk we need uh talk how to possess a promise amen just like the holy spirit told joshua how to possess jericho amen how to possess ai how to possess uh how to protect the gibbonites how to possess all their land each time god would give them instruction on how to possess the promises of god and so we we've learned that we've learned there's a uh there's 158 new testament scriptures about doctrine and teaching compared to one on latter rain we looked at that last week we all want the latter rain who doesn't want rapturing faith i hope no hands go up who doesn't want rapturing faith well that's what the latter rain is well the bible only mentions it one time in the new testament eight times in the old testament why is there so little about it because the key to rapturing faith is to have faith right now be able to talk obey what the god has already said and then god will give you the faith at the end if you receive his faith for right now amen praise god if you receive his faith for the journey now he'll give you faith for the going home amen hallelujah praise god amen so it's very clear and we looked at all the we have quotes brother brahm talks about the difference between preaching and teaching and then there was i shared many quotes or i'm sorry not many but numerous quotes however brahms said i just love teaching because it settles the church of course he loved preaching as well and we saw how jesus the apostles and paul i think my children read it last sunday right everybody read a little bit about how all of them had preaching and teaching you have to have both imagine that i mean imagine that if a preacher or anybody uh a pastor would just preach all the time god's gonna bless you god's gonna bless you uh you're gonna get that financial blessing you're gonna you're gonna get that healing that would be encouraging but then you would at some point you would say well how am i going to get that what what can i do to inherit that but if it's just god's going to do it just confess you know as soon as they start giving some instruction then now you've got to obey the word of god right you have to obey the word of god so it can't be all just preaching all the time there is a place for that no doubt about it but as we saw last week as well jesus would go right from teaching to doing miracles it was that anointing so when the word of god was there when the when the when the presence of the holy spirit was there uh anointing him to teach the word of god then he would move over right into miracles and that's what of course i've seen in my ministry you know we've seen it here too we'll be preaching and teaching and then someone will come up for prayer and they'll get the healing praise god over there get the victory praise god because it's all tied in right you've got to instruct the people so they know what to do and then god will come around and answer prayers so it's all connected very closely together praise god now uh i you know i i think uh one thing i want to get let's go to ephesians four i'd like to uh i didn't get really get to this but i'd like to review just quickly about the fivefold ministry so let's go to ephesians four uh we know of course the fivefold ministry's under a great attack um you know especially out of uh the jeffersonville movement um but i want to just review again i'm looking for my note here on that so ephesians 4 verse 8 this will be good for austin alina's they're learning you know these elementary principles of the gospel ephesians 4 8 wherefore he saith when he ascendeth up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men the speaking of christ when christ ascended he sent down gifts right and jesus said it's necessary that i go that the comforter will come it's better when the holy ghost is here rather than just one man right although he was god and flesh all the fullness of the godhead was bodily incarnate in christ he said it's better that everybody all the believers get a portion of the holy ghost he said it's better to have that right then just have one man everybody flock to that one man it's better because the gospel can be spread verse 9 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things praise god that's what we're saying he ascended up on high so he could send his holy spirit divide his holy spirit around the world praise god now he fills our church he feels brother brother brooks is church brother cam's church right he fills all these churches uh the churches in ghana amen he fills all these churches praise god because he fills all things amen hallelujah because of his great holy spirit verse 11 and he gave some apostles those are missionaries that start new churches he gave some prophets they're foretellers of the word of foretellers of the future uh revealers of the mysteries and some evangelists they go from city to city to stir people's faith up and some pastors they stay in one place and shepherd the flock and some teachers they instruct you deeper than all the other gifts right for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ in other words if you want to be edified if you want to be strengthened listen to god's five different kinds of preaching and that will build you up praise god see that the but the enemies uh the enemies uh temptation days that give us so many different voices that that you know we have human interests and things that we don't hear the fivefold ministry as much as we should right that's that's always been the enemies uh just like with the serpent and eve he tried to get her off from the word of god right distract her with some new thought or some false revelation right the same thing today satan's trying to distract our minds from hearing the true word of god but we will overcome the enemy amen verse 13 so we listen to all these preaching till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ you will listen and as you listen you will grow and you will come in the full portion that god wants you to attain as a christian praise god we all got in our mind but boy what would my life be like if i was fully surrendered to god right but we should have a confidence not discouraged but confident that god will bring us to that point praise god god will bring us to the the spot where we will manifest christ in the fullest uh capacity that he has for us how many want more of god how many want to manifest more of christ amen the bible says if you hear the fivefold ministry god will bring you to that full completion that full portion you desire to manifest to this dying world amen that's the confidence i have too so if you're still here god's not done with you praise god open up your heart to god let god flow through you more amen trust in the word of god hear the word of god let the word of god dwell on you richly with all knowledge and wisdom and you will come to that measure of christ that he desires for you amen praise god uh now i want to um look at that now here why is it so important because in verse 14 if you don't listen to the real preachers you will be tossed back and forth by winds of doctrine you will be blown all over the spectrum sometimes for some years you'll believe this and then then you'll get blown by another false doctrine to the other side over there right like the the popular one today is the prosperity gospel right well if i give uh all my money to this rich preacher i'm going to get rich too you get blown and there's a lot of people that believe that right that's why their churches are so big because they're really not after christ they're after the blessings of christ but we're concerned with knowing the person of christ amen god's going to give me the blessings if i just fall in love with him amen in fact the blessings are running after us amen praise god but see they flock just the blessings but we flock to the face of christ where we receive his will whether it's easy or not and then the blessings of god flow out of our sufferings but then we get blessed you know where we times of rest where we don't have to suffer so much we get the full course amen but most people just want blessing blessing blessing but i understand if i'm to be like christ i must suffer like christ amen i want to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings amen paul said that's why i'm in prison so i can partake of christ's sufferings amen amen so when we when we go through tough times don't be discouraged when you when you when you suffer or you're you're rejected or you're uh you're ignored don't uh don't don't be discouraged just know that this is my portion that i must suffer in order to be like jesus amen he suffered he was uh people talked behind his back people defamed jesus they mocked him they slapped him that's what our text was you'll see they slapped him in a little bit after he talks about it you know you know my doctrine they slap him they're mistreated we're all going to be mistreated for being christians and that's the portion of suffering that we must endure right but the bible says if you suffer with him you'll also reign with him hallelujah that's what we're interested in amen we're not living we're not trying to reign here over the physical kingdoms or the natural cities or the natural churches we're not trying to reign over that we're trying to reign over sin flesh the devil and temptation praise god we're trying to reign spiritually so that later in the millennium then we'll reign naturally as well amen praise god but look at verse 14 that we be henceforth no more children tossed i want to finish that tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine and i'm looking up here uh okay got it all right see what so what what uh what's the problem with not listing the right preachers you don't know your doctrine you don't know how god's instructing you on how to live you go from one extreme to the next right there's a sweet person i'm not gonna name their name they're in my family they they they don't they don't follow the message that kind of narrows it down but they think every and they and i've seen them go from this side so with divine healing is what i want to share with divine healing it used to be uh god's going to heal everything i've seen this person and every time they pray they told the person god wants to heal god wants you you're going to be healed but now i see the person swinging to the other side and they're like if you're sick you're cursed and they try to just uh rebuke the person like they're cursed and both sides are wrong just because you're sick doesn't mean you're cursed how can i be cursed if god has blessed me amen but then how can god heal you every time if if uh how can god want to heal every time if if one day if god terrorists we're all going to die where's the healing then see like there's got to be a balance on all of our statements for example you've heard the statement the right positive mental attitude will bring every promise to pass but if you don't understand that well then you would think well this person died well i'm going to have the right mental attitude and they're going to come back to life well how many times has that happened very rare so you see what what that quote means is that when once god reveals that the promise is for you amen glory once you know it's god's will for this person to rise from the dead or for this miracle to happen then you've got to have the right mental attitude towards the revelation amen let me let me just go back to this one i used one a lot but i had two friends in the message and they really believed they were claiming they're going to marry this person both both a man and a woman just different people they don't go to church here but i just use this because it's very they were claiming in the name of jesus they're going to marry this person and they did it they ended up marrying they both married two other people but they could have said this well the right mental attitude is going to bring this promise to pass but that person god never ordained for them to marry so they're trying to claim a promise that wasn't theirs are you with me church see how we have to be so careful and preachers will just say that well the right mental attitude and we could be discouraged if it doesn't happen well first you got to go back and be taught again that first confess your sins and then second find the revelation is it god's will to do this is that helpful that's some real good meat you can chew on today might have we might have a good meal afterwards but i'll tell you this the real meat right here see because people say that well the right mental attitude just think different well what if you think different but then god shows you well that promise wasn't exactly to you and we sing that song every promise in the book is mine we got to update that song every promise revealed to me is mine now there you go now there's a good one right there because it's got to be revealed to you not all speak with tongues so what if i said well brother i just got to have the right mental attitude and you and i can speak in tongues but what if god has not ordained us to speak in tongues it'll never come to pass amen man hallelujah see we gotta can i say it like this we gotta go we gotta grow past babyhood and into manhood we gotta go past the teenager into the adults amen did everybody understand but see these are things the holy spirit reveals as we meditate upon them as you meditate upon the word of god jesus reveals these things now what does that mean now what is all this for it's for this that you and i have a closer intimacy with christ and that we pray lord let your will be done not my will we don't assume we just don't assume and think we know god's will in every situation we don't we have to constantly seek the face of god which makes us closer to god we're more intimate with him and we look for his will in every situation every situation not thinking we already know it which what makes us more humble instead of being prideful like i know everything i know what god wants to do in every situation you probably don't but ram said usually it's the opposite god wants to do the opposite of what we want to do right see we got to grow up and get out of the childhood being tossed back and forth like this dear family member oh everybody's going to be healed and then they saw they they weren't healed and then now everybody's cursed who's sick that's not always the case god paul told timothy just have a little wine for your stomach's sake he never said because you're cursed he never said that god was allowing a sickness for a purpose like with paul's eyes maybe it's for humility right maybe it's for some other reason but you don't know unless you ask and the bible said you have not because you ask not see we don't pray enough about certain things we just assume well the right mental attitude will bring it to pass well that's only if it's revealed to you right so hopefully that's helpful by the grace of god now let's finish verse 14. now go to the middle where it says every wind of doctrine and while you're going there i'm going to skip it down to 88 forgive me because here's the one i was looking to find no wonder i couldn't find it was already at the end so yeah verse 14 by the slight of men encountering craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ now if you want to look up here mature christians we speak the truth and love so we're not hateful we're not envious we're not jealous and also as mature christians we find where god has joy fitly joined us in our position in the body of christ amen how ridiculous would it be if i said well you know i just i think i'm going to try i'm going to play the guitar i'm going to lead song service today do you think i'd find my position what do you thought what do you all think you have to find well that's as ridiculous as someone getting up here to preach who's not called to preach amen amen praise god amen i mean each one has a position where you fit in perfectly amen each one of you brothers and sisters especially brothers and sisters all of us because not all the anointings here all the anointings with you too praise god we're all anointed of the holy spirit we can't be babies we've got to grow up in the manhood adulthood or womanhood for our sisters you got to grow up in the womanhood and you got to speak the truth and find where god has called you now jesus said few there be that find the narrow road so that means few are going to obey the five full ministry that means very few people will be mature christians and i see it more and more all the time more and more all the time and the way you know they're immature is because they don't deal with sin they let sin foster in their lives they just put they give sin a pass and say okay it's okay we'll just we'll just move on that's one way you know for sure someone's immature because jesus would constantly rebuke his disciples for their sins amen right he didn't let it hang around right he dealt with it so the more mature you the more mature you get the more you'll deal with with sin out of your camp and few people so this means most people that don't obey the fivefold ministry will be immature right they'll also be tossed like waves agitated just everything agitates them they're always fearful they're always there's oh there's always an emergency we talked about that one time remember brother different people we've seen everything's an emergence everything's got to be now where's the peace of god amen hallelujah where's the peace of god that passes all understanding amen that's what we should have praise god if you're in the midst of a trial just pray stop praying make your requests on unto god and watch god's peace come upon you amen if it don't come to you right away it'll pretty soon come upon somebody you love who's right around you amen and they'll help calm you down because we're our body and the help flows through the body praise god also those who reject the fivefold ministry of the teaching will be carried about which means driven by doubts hesitations they'll go from this opinion to that opinion they'll doubt whether this are these things true now we all have doubts right we all battle satan but i'm saying they live they live in this condition they're constantly tossed from that idea to that doctrine to back forth and they don't have the stability that a christian should have they're carried by doubts instead of the word of god and they are deceived because the bible said they're lying in wait to deceive they're false the false preachers are lying in wait to deceive okay so how many want to find the narrow road today how many believe you're walking on the narrow road amen that means you're mature you are coming into a unity with christ and the bride you're coming into a oneness of knowledge of the son of god you're coming into a complete man or woman you are growing into the measure of the fullness of christ for your life that's what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do and that's what jesus sent so you would do it hey hallelujah praise god all right now i'm going to exit i just want to make sure i i didn't preach that last week and i want to get that out to you was that helpful by god's grace so in other words there again those this is what our preaching and all the preachers this is what they're supposed to do they're supposed to perfect you which means equip you to give you the tools you need they're helping they help you do the work of your ministry so the preaching will help you find your ministry and undertake it the third thing it'll edify you to promote your growth you'll see yourself growing because oh when the brother came or when this was preached by the pastor it helped me grow as a christian right oh we all you need the faith we all agree we believe on what's the truth of god yeah we'll have little differences we might see things different but the word of god will bring us to a unity on the major doctrines for sure and we all come in the unity of the knowledge of the son of god or precise truth that you need to god god all right now that's just a little i just wanted to briefly preach that okay now you don't have to have your bibles out for this one but um i just want to go through some remainder here of these verses now these are all about jesus and his teaching and i said on wednesday night you know brother austin and lena were here and sister naomi and the family but we were showing i think it's surprising church if we realize jesus spent a lot of time teaching he would do miracles he would heal he would do all that but from the bible it looks like he spent the most of his time teaching constantly the bible said he was daily teaching with them in the temple so if if you were alive at that time i want to see god's messiah i want to see miracles well you might come into his meeting he might not be doing the miracle of healing he might be doing the miracle of teaching you might just sit and listen for a while and that's how a lot of people were they would just go for the miracles there was one group church listen i said this is there's one group they only went for jesus to uh multiply the bread and get food from jesus that's all they went for and then jesus rebuked him for that they only came to see america oh my we all want to see miracles but we ought to take miracles and correction and let jesus teach us how to live like him amen we got to take all of jesus amen i don't want just a part of jesus i want all of jesus amen same way we have to be today we have to take all of jesus the teaching and the preaching and the miracles amen i think we i think we're a surprise church aren't we we're surprised when we see jesus doing all this teaching it surprised me luke 13 22 and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem then said one in him lord are there a few that be saved and he said unto them what did jesus say strive now this means to contend like you're running a race or fighting a fight i haven't seen too many of you fight other than maokai and i fight at taekwondo sometimes but i've seen maokai fight he's a pretty good fighter but that's what the body that's what jesus said fight to enter in at the straight gate in other words you're gonna have to fight the devil are there a few that be saved yes jesus says and if you want to be saved you've got to fight off those doubts amen fight off the opinions of man fight off all the deceiving of satan and lay a hold and battle until you lay a hold on the truth of god's word amen fight satan stay on the path right and fight satan off the path amen the devil's trying to get you off the path but you got to fight to stay on the truth i'm going to continue walking in truth praise god imagine if jesus visited your town what if he came right down to your street what would he be doing he'd be sitting there on the corner he'd be teaching everybody we'd stand around he'd be teaching them about the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who cast his net to the sea i came to see miracles jesus he said there's a time for miracles there's also a time to teach praise god he passed through and teach in their cities and their villages see how important teaching is now look at this i say to you many will seek to enter in and shall not be able isn't that amazing many will try to enter the straight and narrow the narrow road but not be able to enter in why because they don't receive the teaching of the word and he was on the way to the cross think about that many people are going to say let me in let me i want to walk the narrow way and he said they'll not be able to right reminds us of what the foolish virgin they go they come too late they should have prepared the oil beforehand right reminds us of that they're going to try but it's not the right time they should have done it earlier oh let's redeem the time church amen you are redeeming the time amen let's make the most of this morning praise god give god all your attention give god all your your love amen give god all your heart all your obedience amen all your efforts strive to walk the narrow road strive he said if you want to because a lot of people are going to try but they're not willing to strive they're not willing to fight for obedience see they get into the bad habits or they get into a foolish state like the foolish virgin right where they they no longer seek after the holy ghost they no longer seek after the face of god this is what we see in the scripture luke 19 and he taught daily every day well let's go down it's friday let's go down and see what jesus is doing he's teaching today huh he was teaching yesterday and my dad said he was teaching on wednesday too and my mom said he was teaching on tuesday and monday too he was always teaching but the chief priests and scribes of the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him now look at this church the elect you and i must be attentive to the holy ghost teaching us today and every day were very attentive that's why we don't uh get on our cell phones in the church i've been to churches we've been to churches with william they say oh get out your cell phone get a text and then the people and i've seen it they're no longer reading the bible now they're just texting friends they're just on their social media we saw that at the catholic church i saw this lady she had this whole scarf on and she was just on social media i'm like what this is this is supposed to be the house of god you need to be very attentive praise god that's why we don't say who wants a coffee in here now i might take one but that'd be wrong i'll take one after church right or let's pass around the pizza who like a piece of pizza while we're preaching the word of god ridiculous god deserves your full attention amen like austin he's got this nice wonderful job thank god for that amen but they don't let him do his phone on the job why because the job's important it's a hazard to have your phone on oh god it's a hazard to have your phone on in the house of god you might miss the holy spirit praise god amen it's a hazard to laugh and joke in the church because you might miss the holy spirit i'm talking about like the preaching of the word you know like hey did you hear that joke last night you see the browns game last night no they didn't play last night i'm just using that as an example just silliness but jesus when he went a place he demanded their attention praise god and he said they were not a little attentive they were very attentive that's what i like when all you're looking at me because i know the holy spirit's got your attention hallelujah see this is what if jesus was here that's how we'd be acting we'd have to give jesus all of our attention he said heaven shall pass away but my word shall not pass away take heed to yourselves listen any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting that means a hangover and drunkenness and cares this life and so that day come upon you unawares so jesus says overeating over drinking is going to be a battle in this day that's why we gotta fast right that's we gotta eat less you can't fast at least eat less right so you don't get caught up in the cares of this life for as a snare see it's a trap all this food all this fun it's a trap it's a snare it'll come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth watch ye therefore and pray always so while your friends and family are eating and feasting and probably gaining too much weight right you and i should just eat a little right and then we should pray and we should watch because the bible said then we'll be worthy to escape all things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man hallelujah see the world overeat over drink we should be in the word in the word in the word hallelujah and in the in the day time he was doing what teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount valves i'll show you a picture of it a little bit mount valves was just uh directly east of mount moriah where the temple was remember we looked at mariah and zion where we looked at that a few months ago there was a valley a kidron valley right right by uh mount moriah where abraham sacrificed isaac and everything or was going to but then that next mountain come up was called the mount of olives and so jesus would spend that time teaching and he'd take maybe a 10-minute walk and he'd walk up the hill and then he'd go sleep up there in the mount mount olives verse 38 and all the people came what'd they do early they got up early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him they couldn't get enough of his word oh that should be you and i church that should be our testimony what'd you do last night dad well i was down there this isn't that young rabbi he taught all the day in the temple and i went home i got right to bed so i could get up early i go hear him teach again tomorrow this morning praise god i just can't get enough of this the lord jesus the son of man they called him praise god see they were so in tune with the holy spirit they would take his teaching in the temple they'd taken him out olives he was constantly telling the people this is how you keep the commands of god this is how you love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul all your mind all your strength then said pilate to the chief priest and the people i find no fault okay this is when he's been uh this is when he's been arrested and they were the more fear saying he stirth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place so notice the wicked religious ones hated jesus's teaching and so will they hate our teaching if we're preaching what jesus preached i'm sorry if we're teaching what jesus taught and preached what he taught so will the world hate us did you see this two weeks ago in canada did you see this canada outlawed any speech against homosexuality transgenderism so christianity has been officially outlawed in canada and you know what those brothers do i've seen them i haven't talked to them but i've seen it they just don't preach on it or if they're going to get arrested so they wait till they get in the you know quietness after the livestream's over then they can talk and explain it in church guess what that might maybe come into our our nation too that was just two weeks ago look it up you can look it up it's all it was all over the news this last week it was so silent we didn't even hear we didn't even hear about the death of christianity or the outlaw of christianity in canada but it happened remember what's going to happen the united states government and the churches are going to unite to condemn what we believe they're not going to condemn our miracles they're going to condemn our doctrine right because doctrine is instruction this is how you should live it should be a man and a woman getting married not a man and a man that's in that's doctrine what are they going to try to do they're going to try to silence us but brother man said even if they try to silence us they may shut us down here but we'll keep having a ministry amen we'll find a way to preach to god's people amen we might have to drive to one another's house i'm not sure how it's going to happen at the end if we live to see it but they may silence the bride as far as publicly but she'll keep moving on praise god so keep learning from god she'll learn what to say in that hour she'll be made ready for the coming of her bridegroom what stirred them up his doctrine why's he got to teach him because he's teaching against us he's calling out our sins see that's why we got to call these people sins out pretty soon i'm going to teach an updated one about the false prophets because the bible said they had doctrines of devils i'm gonna show you some of their doctrines of devils there's two examples i shared with austin alina a couple weeks ago one of them is uh priests can't marry women that's called celibacy that's a doctrine of hell the bible says that's a doctrine of a devil preachers can't be married also the other one is uh you can't eat meat which they do all throughout you know the spring and everything like that that's a doctrine of the devil can you imagine that it's a devil trying to get people not to eat meat a devil that's okay if you're a vegetarian by choice but if it's if you're taking the man-made law and saying oh if you eat meat you're going to hell well now you just received a doctrine of the devil and there's many more like marrying people two or three times homosexuality right we talked about these so hopefully everybody can catch that by god's grace in john 3 nicodemus came to jesus by night and said rabbi we know without a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou do us except god be with him so see the teaching and the miracles were inseparable nobody taught like jesus and nobody healed like jesus amen that's how we should have great teaching and we should have great miracles too praise god amen they're inseparable but our lives have to be lined up with the will of god we have to do the will of god in order to see the miracle we have to obey the doctrine in order to see the miracle of god because we're not babies anymore god's not gonna just you know do everything just to show us his love we know god loves us and now he wants us to mature he wants to see us stand in obedience he wants to see us choose the way of the master choose the way of jesus amen see they're inseparable john 6 no man can come to me except the father which has set me draw him and i'll raise him up at the last day as it is written the prophets they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me all god's children are taught of his spirit now here's what i read last sunday but i want you to see it i want you to see that brother braham said all god's children being taught the word of god is the evidence of the holy ghost and yes when you first get the holy ghost you have to have an emotional or some type of experience because every time a baby's born you see life enter i mean you can see the life right that baby's alive something happened to that baby right that baby's alive same thing when someone gets the holy ghost you have to see it and hear it the bible says but let's look at these quotes here churchill to further bring out what we've just said and to also use a scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that's baptized with the holy ghost don't we talk about that all the time we dropped out brother amen we talk about that who is baptized with the holy ghost don't we sometimes i wonder right people around this message who does have the holy ghost right we talk about it all the time and that's scriptural in galatians 4 paul wondered i said he said do i have to come and labor again it seems like some of you weren't born again it's it's we must talk about who is baptized with the holy ghost he said but see what jesus says in john 6 45 it is written the prophets all they shall be all taught of god in isaiah 54 13 it's taken from this and all thy children shall be taught of the lord the all of god are the children of god thus it is the evidence of being a true child of god he whom the spirit has come upon in indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the holy ghost now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost it doesn't say in any age he that hath the tongue let him say what the spirit's saying that put tongues interpretation thereof prophecy etc aside as the evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking amen yes the spirit is teaching that's exactly what jesus said he would do when he came john 14 26 he will teach you all things teach me today lord amen and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written praise god that's my prayer god when i don't have my bible in front of me remind me what you said amen tell me what to say praise god if i don't have my bible there i can't get out my phone lord i don't know what to say put the words in my mouth amen help me to be able to learn what to say to bring hope to people to bring healing to people to bring salvation to people praise god the men who wrote the bible he's talking about them they recalled in their minds by the holy ghost the very words that jesus spake that is why the gospels are accurate did you know that some of them wrote their gospels matthew mark luke and john some some of them wrote 20 or 30 years after christ left can you imagine go back 20 years i'm i'm 41. imagine if i go back to i'm 21 and try to remember what was it like when you went to play that football game at ohio state tell me all the details tell me exactly what your coach said to you i'd be like i have nothing i have nothing there's i can't remember anything about it but the holy ghost was so powerful on these men amen the holy ghost brought down they must have visions brother amen they must add visions they saw it again they heard the very words he said he said write this down the bible said the holy men of old were moved by the holy ghost amen god move us to speak the words of god to remember the words of jesus move upon us move through us help us be united vessels lord amen i can hardly remember what happened yesterday praise god or any conversation that happened you know last week but the holy ghost moves upon them and reminds them of what was spoken that's what happened a few i told brother this to brother austin a few months ago we had somebody try to come back to the church and we're out there talking the parking lot and i told this person i said you got to do three things in order to be invited back to church and i couldn't think of it i just kept waiting on the holy spirit i just kept talking yeah yeah i just kept waiting and all of a sudden i felt like heaven opened up and the three things came right down to me right at the very moment i said you got to have a job to come back i said you got to have an apartment to come back and you got to be supporting your children five children to come back and the very moment i said that that person said those very same words we said it in unison together see i'd forgotten about it but the holy spirit didn't forget about it amen i didn't hear you praise god and when i needed it the holy spirit brought it praise god and so that person hasn't met their uh hasn't met my requirements even though i invited them to come back anyway because they had two of them met but not one but they don't want to come back anyway that's fine but that's an example where i needed the word of god to remind me what i said so this person can keep the word of god and it came back at the very hour i need it man it happens all the time while i'm preaching too i can't remember a scripture all of a sudden there it is amen hallelujah he brings all things to remembrance he said that's how paul received the revelation paul said i did not receive the revelation of a man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ he was taught by the holy ghost in every age we hear the same truth he that hath the ear to hear what the spirit say to the churches but only a spirit-filled man can hear the revelation of that age none other can no sir they cannot because exactly what paul said in 1st corinthians 2 6-16 did you get that last thought i repeat every church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual hear what the spirit say to the churches that's why brother amen i should be so discouraged how come people can't stay how come they can't hang around it's because i can't make them receive it i can preach it until i'm spitting or crying or shouting but i can they have to hear it themselves i'm just god's microphone right i'm just god's mic but it's god's voice they have to receive and they have to accept it and they have to they have to reject the voice of the devil right and then if they if they reject the voice of the devil they repent they receive god's word then they'll be with us praise god amen but only the elect will do it i'm so glad after all these years i'm god's elected amen i'm still standing i'm still hearing the voice of the spirit today praise god amen i can't force them to hear but i can decide i can decide to hear and i choose i hear it today holy spirit amen the bible said they went out from us because they were not a part of us because they weren't born again they're very proof you're still here is that you're born again praise god hallelujah see it's not based upon my feelings it's based upon the word amen that's the revelation of the word because my feelings betray me my feelings lie to me but the word of god will never lie it can never pass away praise god the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has its own elect and that elect group always heard from the word and received it proving they had the seed in them john 8 47 jesus said he that is of god heareth god's word you therefore hear them not because you're not of god amen every child of god will hear this message hallelujah they'll receive the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ amen now we see that god is one person and not three persons praise god they received that there was some type of fruit in the garden that was a natural fruit it was a it was an adultery fruit praise god they'll receive that because he that's of god hears god's word and they'll know after i get saved i've got to get sanctified and i need christ in me the hope of glory they'll receive that because that's what god's elect do they hear the word of god thank you jesus they refused the word jesus and his words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of god i know it's lengthy on the quotes but these are special quotes that's why i'm preaching them two sundays in a row all thy children shall be taught of god the holy spirit jesus said the same thing in john 6 45 being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled no other criterion but what are the tongues and interpretations the other gifts there are manifestations that's what the word teaches first corinthians 12 7 says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then paul names those manifestations now i ended last sunday with this the hellbound group could not learn from jesus to be taught to stop fearing in other words instead of faith they they took fear they couldn't learn how to have faith may god help us all to have faith they couldn't learn to just believe god's word they had to have unbelief they couldn't learn to stop doing abominable things they loved the abomination they couldn't learn it so they they basically sent themselves to hell they couldn't learn not to murder they couldn't learn how to forgive or have mercy they couldn't learn how to handle their sexual passions so god sent them to hell they couldn't learn to stop messing with sorcerers and demonic powers they couldn't learn to stop idolizing things they couldn't learn to stop lying like this but jesus said all those who hear my words are the children of god who can learn of me we should all confess that no matter how hard of the struggle we should all say i can still learn how to overcome this grief i can learn how to overcome this depression come on somebody yes i can learn to overcome this bad habit come on charge i can love you learner but because i've got a great teacher hallelujah amen a fool will not fail to learn this gospel amen hallelujah it's such an arrow and a fool won't air in this message hallelujah it's so plain i thought i'd add a few extra quotes because these are so awesome he said notice your absolute what's your absolute it's not brother branham it's the bible bible never said i'm the absolute above the bible he never said i'm the absolute equal to the bible he never said that he said i'm pointing you to the absolute he said oh i'm going to say something i just feel coming notice i feel very religious at this time because this is assurance notice your compass let me know what a compass is right you got them on your phone now you can get a compass on your phone your compass can only point to the north star that's the only place it can point if it's a true compass it'll strike the north star every time is that right then if you have the holy spirit it can only point to the word it'll never point to denomination it will never point to a creed it'll never point it away somewhere it'll point straight to the word brother jesse why do you believe this the word not because well my brother believes this amen or my my former pastor my first pastor brother brooks not because he says it i believe what the bible says praise god nothing wrong with that you know i said it could be anybody my mom i'm not going to tell you what my mom says i'm going to take what the bible says and you should say not even just because i said it it should be because the bible says it praise god amen i'm the voice you hear all the time but don't let me become common and don't let the bible become common either because i'm pointing you to the word you should say that's god's word that's not brother jesse's word that's god's word amen it'll never point you straight to the word i feel like shouting glory it's something inside of a man pulsating when you see your star setting out yonder jesus christ the word and you see the spirit that's in you won't let it move right or left that's the only one that can he come to take the things of god and show them to you manifest them jesus said see he'll do exactly the things that i say the holy spirit will reveal to you the things that's to come and show you ahead of time before it gets here i was praying yesterday i was praying lord i was fasting and praying a little bit i said lord show me please show me i hope you'll show me if the rapture is going to take place in my lifetime or not i'd like to know wouldn't you we've had a lot of people say it was going to happen their lifetime and they died i'd like to know praise god because i'm tired of all this guessing and all this this year is going to be the route i'm tired of that praise god so i'm just going to ask the lord i'll see what he says i'm waiting on the lord i don't know how to be manifested but i took time to ask the lord that you said you'd tell us things to come i said lord help me to understand the season of your coming so we're aware of it we see that he shows the things he takes the things that are god's and will show them to you i never asked to know the day of the hour i just said is it going to be my lifetime and he the holy spirit will reveal to you the things that jesus already said in other words he'll make plain the thing place that way over in a corner tonight because that's what we're going to use a little while making sure which positive sea then you know your north star which is the word to any christian you like that one is that you like that quote i love that one anything contrary to word look let me tell you something listen this closely this is the complete divine revelation of god his will and the coming of christ and everything lays right in this book completed brother and pat's on his bible and if anything draws you off of that throw that compass away because it's only a creed praise god it's a false impersonating compass i don't care if it's your mom or your dad or your brother or grandma or your famous preacher i don't care who it is this is the compass the word of god is the absolute praise god amen throw any man-made compass away just stick with god's compass i appreciate my brother i appreciate my sister i appreciate my family but i appreciate the lord most they have their ideas but i'm going to take the word of god see a creed is only a paper you're packing your in your pocket it's framed it's a creed find the compass that sets you to the word i'm going to skip that 7. and that's what christ is to you if you want to go to heaven i'm going to go to heaven if you want to be saved i'm going to be saved if you want to be filled with the holy spirit how do you want to be filled with the holy spirit if you want to be christ-like how do you want to be christian christ is your north star if you're lost don't try to take a creed he's your north star he's your way he's your direction then if you take him as your north star then that absolutely places the holy spirit your your compass the holy spirit is your compass and the compass will only point you to the north star and if you got the baptism of the holy ghost it can only point to you to christ and christ is the word that's the way to find your way back to god that's your way to find that narrow road hallelujah a straight road the word of god now i know all these false preachers they're like satan they're they're quoting the bible they're like they're quote it to jesus so also you've got to have the holy spirit discernment in your heart to know if that person's off the word or if that person's on the word like yesterday the jeffersonville church put out another article guess what they said they said that brother branham was the first to come to the full the fullness of adam again can you imagine that the bible says jesus is the there it is the last adam but they said brother brahma is the first to return to the full adam that's that's impossible the full the first adam had no sin brother graham sinned so right there it's so simple and they're basically exalting brother brahm equal to the first adam or equal to christ and it says and then they say that church says and then now you all have that same fullness of adam's status no we don't we don't we can't live a sinless life right and i'm going to write i'm going to write them my email today lord willing if i remember today or tomorrow i'm going to tell them you guys are off the word brother ramsay the last adam was christ it's impossible now can we speak to the mountain yes thank god we've seen it praise god but that doesn't make us fully like adam because adam had full control and he was kind he was always obeying the word of god he was con he just had that permanent anointing we don't have that praise god as far as everything we do is perfect all the time we have death inside of us the first adam didn't have death inside of him right he wasn't dying see it's so sly that devil's so so smooth it sounds so good but it's wrong it's making people think they're equal to adam you're not equal to adam as far as before he sinned you've sinned we've all sinned we've all fallen short of the glory of god amen now the blood can redeem us right and give us back the gifts that god has for us but we're all not going to be speakers and tongues we're all not going to be miracle workers like adam was adam could speak to this tree brother said he could move it now that's not in the bible but i don't know what things he controlled with nature but he obviously could control the garden and operate the garden right so we even got to take that back to the word see and we'll all have our gifts but we're not all going to be sinless on this side we're going to be sinless when we get the new body praise god a theophany amen and then a glorified body then we'll be sinless praise god then we'll be like adam praise god see it's so it sounds so good oh you're just like jesus has restored everything back the garden of eden brother amen just speak the word now right that's what that false preacher i showed you with his 24 false doctrines that's what he was saying to the to their to that church they were saying well you got the fullness of god in you and the angels are looking for you to operate the fullness of god well who wants to step up and be first to walk on water because you got the fullness of god who's going to be first and what everybody stood there like statues they didn't move because you can't you you can't do that it's ridiculous but see it's trying to put a spirit of bondage over the people a spirit of fear and in the same sermon he said tape churches and return ministry churches and fivefold are all the same that's heresy we're not the same as those heretical churches we stand for truth we have jesus doctrine amen the holy ghost brings us jesus words to our remembrance amen hallelujah amen hallelujah oh i love this word amen some of y'all don't see it which is okay you don't have to see it but i see it all the time i hear this one i see that one i i check their website every week anyway because it's always filled with you know so i spilled something off the word i know it like it's automatic like they're just going to give me false doctrine every time i check their website every time it's automatic because they're not pointing us to the word they're pointing us to their own idea of a tape that's not what he said on the tape they're misinterpreting the tapes that they say are the absolute and infallible see that's what happens when your compass is broken they've got a man-made compass praise god and they're not using the compass of the holy spirit all right that's my weekly keeping our church clean from the uh tape church false doctrine teachings to the gifts of god new church the gift of god clean out the church all right sweep it up there all right dumb in the trash praise god we love the tapes we love brother brandon i listened to the tape this week while i was shoveling beautiful tape but they're they're going so far they're making the tapes infallible that's what they're there that's what their podcast said la i'm sorry their website said last week the tapes are infallible and they said the tapes are all powerful that's a lie brother ram said you find mix up on the tapes he said look in the bible but see they take a few quotes here there that make it you know that satan can see that he it makes it look like it that's the way but that's not what they're saying that's not what brother was saying the word of god is infallible the word of god is all-powerful see all right thank you thank you uh john 6 55 and the 57 and the living father has sent me and i live by the father who do you live by i live by jesus right so he that now look he that eateth me even he shall live by me look what he says and all these preachers by the austin can you imagine seventy preachers standing around brother austin jesus said if you eat of me you live of me this is that bread that came down from heaven not as your father should eat manna and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever and these things said he where in the synagogue with all the religious people around as he taught in capernaum you know he said it on purpose he said it to thin out the crowd and i hope we don't send out the crowd here [Laughter] but you know it's god's will god's will many therefore his disciples when they heard this they said this is hard preaching this is hard teaching who can understand this and he goes on to say they're just that my words are spirit you have to receive that my you have to receive my teachings that's life you have to eat me you have to receive my teachings when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said to them does this offend you what now he didn't say that in a nice way he said it in a rebuking way did this preach and hurt your feelings he said what if you see the son of man ascend up where he was before then would you believe it jesus wasn't always mr nice guy he'd rebuke the people especially these preachers he'd rebuke the preachers right because they're the ones influencing the people it is the spirit that quickens the flesh prophets nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore i said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given of him and my father from that time brother look at this many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more when jesus started rebuking them about their false doctrines and talking about all these spiritual things that's when the people left and said i can't handle this they all left and then the bible said jesus went back so brother austin only had 12 people left in his church and then he said do you guys want to leave too it just reminds me of gideon doesn't it he had 22 000 then it went down to what uh thirteen thousand ten thousand or something like that they said that's too many the holy spirit said we just need three hundred he kept shaving it down there's too many here too much pride amen too much fraud you want to go too he wasn't some pushover he knew what he was doing then simon said lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words see peter knew it's the words it's the spirit behind the words amen i didn't know you and we believe and are sure thou art the christ the son of living god notice he never went into great detail he just said my words are spirit and life in other words you have to receive this spiritually he let all the carnal ones leave and that's what we got to do too right we can't beg people we can't force people to come back i know jesus word we're not it praise god amen because it lines up with the word of god oh i'm glad to be on the lord's side whose side are we standing on we're standing on the lord's side maybe we'll see that one here let me whose side are we standing on i'm standing on the lord's side i stand i stand i stand i stand i'm standing on the lord's side whose side are you stuck i'm stomping on the lord's side amen praise god let him go jesus said only the true elect can hear my teaching they'll receive it because they're children of god in john 7 he was at the feast of tabernacles what do you do he went to the temple and he taught the people they marveled how does this man know these things he never went to seminary he said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me see he didn't claim i didn't get this for myself i got this from god right then he cried look as he taught now look see you can be a loud teacher if you're a teacher you don't have to be quiet all the time real genteel a real sweet and kind can i just teach you something real quick would that be okay everybody okay no jesus cried the bible said he lifted up a loud voice he said you both know me and you know whence i came from and i'm not coming myself but he that sent me is true whom you don't even know praise god that's some real teaching right there praise god i know where i come from you know upset from god but you don't know you haven't received it you keep blaspheming it and he was teaching them with a loud voice he wasn't ashamed he was bold praise god amen that's our king amen that's our jesus amen he said but i know by the father for i am from the father and the father sent me so how they like that teaching did they like that a lot did they say amen did you get a standing ovation yeah thank you jesus no they said let's kill that guy he said i'm not a believer and they weren't they weren't believers see church some at some point if somebody don't hate you pretty soon something's wrong with your life especially me as a preacher i get told at least once a month if somebody hates me at least once a month on youtube if if our lives aren't rubbing the world the wrong way something's wrong with our lives right now i don't know how often it has to be i'm just saying i've experienced people hating me because i stand on the word of god but i didn't get this for myself i got the bible right here right he boldly taught them but they hated him they wanted to grab him and shake him and i just wish i could grab brother jesse by the necktie and really give him one that's what they want to do praise god now in john 8 jesus went out the mount of olives early in the morning he came again the temple and taught and came unto them and i'm sorry and the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them so spiritual hungry saints will get up early for a 10 am service to hear jesus's teaching where's the mount of olives it's right over here so here was uh here's mount zion over here right here's mount moriah that's where the temple was and here's the city of dave remember the pool of sloan uh i'm sorry the gihon spring remember david david's guys went in there that was beautiful i'm sorry joshua's guys yeah no david's guys those dave's guys yeah sorry dave's guy sorry so this was the mariah well there's this garden gets set there's a garden sent me where jesus prayed so jesus would teach in the temple then he'd leave out here i don't know which way you go out but he'd go up in here and he would either sleep up here but then in the morning he would he'd get up he'd pray to the father first and then he'd teach the people all day here's what it looks like today imagine saying with jesus look at these rocky places you look good i wonder jesus sit on one of those rocks the kingdom of heaven is like 10 virgins that went out to me to bridegroom five of them were wise five of them were foolish which one are you praise god he would just teach them and the people would just be the bible said they'd be very attentive and they listened to him imagine you know if i took the service outside we'd all get distracted by all the cars the cheering at the bar and how they cheering the bar you know with the football games we might be distracted like that and church no doubt there was distractions in their day too but the saints had their eyes locked on jesus it don't matter if we're in the temple it don't matter if we're outside it don't matter if there's birds singing don't matter if there's babies crying amen don't don't matter what's going on our focus is on christ and christ and the law alone and his word amen i'm trying to get to the close here i didn't set my timer so i may be a long time today i'm already an hour and a half so here forgive me yep and they said to him where is thy father jesus answered you neither know me nor my father. they said where's your father if you know me you should have known my father also in other words i act just like daddy i act just like my dad hallelujah how many can say that i act just like my heavenly father we should be able to say that church these words fake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hours not yet come church the devil can't do nothing to us until it's god's time let me just repeat that praise god they they hated jesus they hated his preaching they hate his teaching but they could not harm him until it was time amen see church that's why we should be bold just stand on the word of god god will protect you unless it's his will to let you go through a trial just stand on the word be strong be bold for the lord thy god is with thee amen no man or woman will be able to stand before you all the days of your life joshua amen hallelujah just stand there and then if god wants you to go through some tests you'll go through some tests but then like the apostles you'll be there saying we're glad we got to partake in the sufferings of jesus they actually left from getting beaten and they said in acts chapter 5 and they said we give god glory that we could suffer for his name's sake and look what he says i go my way you will seek me but you'll die in your sins what a what is what a sermon that would be i mean i don't think i've ever looked at anybody in sermon all these 17 years of preaching i say you're going to die in your sins but jesus did because jesus god let him know these people were going to be eternally lost so he could say that you're going to die in your sins see jesus was loving but he was also truthful right i'm trying to here bring this down let me see how many i got here oh yeah i'm getting there i'm pretty close here now and then said jesus unto them when you lift up the son of man then you shall know that i am he so when he's crucified when he's lifted up and that i do nothing of myself amen but as my father hath taught me i speak these things so before jesus could teach others he himself had to learn before you can teach others you have to learn like i was telling brother austin you know with his testimony god's taught him to overcome different different habits in his life well now he can teach people how to overcome them right because he's had a special a special testimony god had to bring him through all these things and brother now you can teach people now you can say hey i overcame that you come with me to church i'll show you how to overcome that praise god each one of us had different tests in our lives and now some of us are being tested now but god is testing us for our testimony amen and then after we've learned the lesson then we can teach others amen he that has sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone we can all say that church for i do always now we can't say this for i do always those things that please him we can't say that you could say mostly i do those things that please him and as he spake these words many believed on him since the world began now john chapter 9 this man was born blind right jesus healed him he said since the world began it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this were not of god he could do nothing if this man was not of god the answer said to him was thou off together born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast them out look at this they were you couldn't even teach them anything these pharisees couldn't be taught by anybody not even a man who was born blind and i'm seeing colors can you imagine seeing colors for the first time in your life and trying to tell the pharisees the preachers about it they don't want to hear nothing about it see because they love their creeds more they love the word of god see and we at church we all need to have a teachable spirit as well church don't you think don't you think preachers can tell if if if i want to hear their sermon don't you think brother ben can tell if i want to hear a sermon or not of course sometimes i can tell if people want to hear my sermons or not right but we got to be teachable by the word of god and i know there's going to be hard times i know we all go through trials but we should repent quickly of them and say god give me a teachable spirit help me to overcome it or i can't overcome this i can learn this because i'm a child of god and i have a good teacher the holy spirit but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you some things no he's going to teach you all things and bring what all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you and this is where we need to grow church we need to remember in our hours of trial that's the time to say lord give me the words that i need to say lord help me to teach me to say the right thing at this time keep waiting keep waiting on the holy spirit and he'll teach us the words to say because he said that's what the holy ghost is for to bring these things to remembrance now look what god left you aren't you glad god left his peace for you peace i leave with you my i give to you not as the world giveth give unto you let not your heart be troubled let neither let it be afraid praise god church we have the peace of god today do not be uh discouraged don't be upset don't be nervous don't be afraid god's peace is here today god's victory is here for us today praise god god's joy is here for us today praise god he didn't leave us you know uh uh he didn't leave us a discouraging attitude he didn't leave us depression he left us peace hallelujah he wants to teach us how to be peaceful praise god he wants to teach us to not be afraid he wants to teach us to not be troubled before things that we see he will teach us what we need to say in that hour i'm almost done i got let's see one two got a couple more here's our text okay refer back to our text right so jesus said i spake openly now look with jesus afraid of his teaching jesus hide anything from anybody no he said in secret i've said nothing that means that jesus remember he pulled his disciples aside and he would tell him the meanings of the parables that means he must have went and preached that later to everybody else because he said in secret i've said nothing right church in secret i've said nothing he said ask ask these people i'll look at the next one she said why are you asking me what i taught ask them what's heard me what i've said unto them behold they know not what i said and when he thus spoken one of the officers which struck stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answer the style of the pride priest so jesus answered to him now look at this he gets slapped can you imagine get slapped and then he says if i've spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smidest thou me look at the temperance that jesus christ had he rebukes them they slap him he rebukes them again and asks him and then he asked him in kindness where have i done anything evil now that's real self-control that's real self-control the holy spirit right there getting slapped in the face and then you got to answer back nicely imagine if we got stopped in the face we'd say okay how many rounds is this going to be who's who's timing us or if you take off the belt whatever he got but jesus said if i've spoken evil show me what have i said i've hid nothing i've taught before everybody everybody's heard my teaching what they hate him for his teaching because it taught against their wicked hearts see that now look at acts chapter one now look even after jesus resurrected he kept teaching them for those 40 days he was with them the former treatise have i made oh theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up so see he taught that whole 40 days he would teach the disciples he never stopped teaching he was always teaching them church that must mean we have something to learn every single day you know at school they have a poster that says uh today's a good day to learn something new well that's they stole that from the bible right because jesus was teaching every single he'd be there every day teaching them something new church we should have that attitude let's come to church and say lord i can learn something new today that will help me in my walk with the lord i don't know it all i'm not a smart aleck i don't know everything i'm not god i'm not equal to god i don't know everything i need to learn something today it's january 30th 2022. i need to learn from you today lord i need you for this week because i don't know what's going to happen this week but i need your word to help me fight it now look after he was taken up after that through the holy ghost jesus gave commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen and he showed himself alive by many infallible proofs now i showed this on wednesday i showed how the uh the catholic and protestants united back in 2014 it's been a while and they said uh it's not the doctrine that unites us it's the anointing that unites us that's a lie we got to have both both unite us miracles and teaching unites us right and they say don't worry about doctrine god will sort it out when we all get to heaven no god's using doctrine to sort us out right now because we hear heretics and the bible said avoid heretics which are men that teach their own ideas avoid heretics and just cling to the word of god so just like today deceivers will not accept true doctrine they're never going to accept it i'm going to close with this here uh get your bibles isaac 20. i want to close with this isaiah 28. i trust you learned something today by god's grace as i told you i i mean i've just been really refreshed to see how much jesus taught how much time like if he only had so much time he had 33 years what am i going to invest my time in the bible said at every city and he was daily in the temple constantly teaching the people so if christ did that i think we should live our lives like christ don't you learn something seek god's bible to learn something new isaiah 28. now look what god uses church god through isaiah uses the illustration how am i going to teach people doctrine how am i going to teach them to obey the word of god and he uses a very personal intimate symbol he uses a relationship between a mother and an infant in other words how can i teach brother jesse to obey me in this particular area of his life how can i teach brother so and so to receive divine healing how can i teach our sister to overcome depression how am i going to learn that you got to become like a baby you got to become like a child and you have to lay yourself in the presence of the holy spirit and you have to read the bible you have to receive the preaching you just got to sit there i know it's hard i know it's long sometimes like today sometimes it's long but you gotta just like a child you gotta get filled up praise god you gotta get filled up and you got to lay in the presence of the father amen in this case the father and mother god almighty he's both father and mother to us now he in verse 7 isaiah said the priests and uh and prophets air because of wine in other words they're getting drunk and then they can't judge the word of god anymore because they're drunk right and of course we know people do drugs today and all kinds of things now verse 8 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so there is no place unclean so in the jewish churches they were drunk uh and the religion had become polluted and they might not have had physical vomit on the floor but god saw spiritual vomit everywhere i know that's a hard thing to say but that's what that's what god says remember in revelation 3 brother with the laodicean church jesus said because you love the things of the world i've vomited you out of my mouth see man-made religion makes christ sick and when people make him sick he spews them out of the body right they're no longer his mouthpiece they're no longer speaking for him now look at verse 9 church whom shall god teach knowledge whom shall he make to understand doctrine how can i understand divine healing how can i understand the baptism of the holy ghost how can i understand how to be a better husband or a better father to my children them that are what wean from the milk and drawn from the breasts so you have to pick yourself you have to be so close to god like a toddler or a baby as close to their mother and what does that mean for us look at verse 10 for precept or command must be upon precept precept upon priests in other words bible verse upon bible verse upon bible verse upon bible verse okay so what's the milk of god the bible praise god you've got to have bible verse bible verse bible verse bible verse if you want to understand god's ways he said line up online line up online hear a little there a little for with stammering lips another tongue we speak to this people that was speaking at pentecost to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye shall cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing but ye would not hear but the word lord was unto them the believers precept upon precept precept them on precept line upon line line upon line here little and their little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken let's stand to our feet true believers musicians can come true believers will place themselves in a position of intimacy with god and they will accept god feeding them command upon command right line upon line i showed you this remember i told you this a few years ago i had to learn with divine healing i just can't cast out every devil i can't just command someone to be healed i have to ask them first and i still have to remember this church i'm still trying to learn this lesson from years ago before you pray for anybody make sure you say have you confessed all your sins because if not you might be trying to drive away a spirit but yet god wants that there to correct them you might be going opposite of what god actually wants them to do and i admit as a preacher i'm still learning how to do that every single time and i need god's help to do that learning here a little there little hope you got a little bit today get a little bit today got a little bit on wednesday get a little bit more on wednesday night precept here precept there here a little they're a little just lay in the arms of christ how many want to rest in christ's arms let's bow our heads and let's pray that church let's pray lord teach me your knowledge teach me your commands because that's what this is coming down to like we saw in canada this is coming down we know i don't know if it'll be in our lifetime but it's coming down to the last forbidding the law is forbidding our doctrine from the bible and we have to be so strong on the bible like jesus said you want to go away as well and we have to say we have the words of eternal life jesus christ has spoken to us the words of his life let's pray together heavenly father lord god we love you today i've gone long but you only got one service thank you god for the word of god that we've heard today amen i'm blessed i'm served by the holy spirit for all the children of god will hear the word of god today lord let us see ourselves like children lord god like we don't know it all where we can honestly say lord i want to understand your ways i want to understand your teachings i can still learn if i don't learn then i become rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing ah god we don't want to be vomited out of course we know we're sealed it will never happen but we want to take warnings as well the bible said approach lord your bible tells us to approach salvation with fear and trembling amen so lord help us to have this attitude of unteachable give us that deep meat to chew on like we said earlier every promise of god that's revealed is ours the right mental attitude to every revealed promise will bring it to pass but it's got to be revealed first thank you god for these truths thank you for holding us today lord thank you for holding us close lord god may we ever remain there lord god enjoying your life your life lord god as your child for all children will nurse from el shaddai all children of god will nurse from god and grow in grace and knowledge of the lord in jesus christ's name and the saint said i've seen this song if anyone needs prayer more welcome to come up i'll be happy to pray with you thank god for the word
