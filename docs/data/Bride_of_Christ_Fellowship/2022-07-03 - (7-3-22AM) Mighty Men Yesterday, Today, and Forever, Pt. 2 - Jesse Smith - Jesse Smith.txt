========================================

second samuel chapter 23 please ii samuel chapter 23 i'd like to continue this thought on god's mighty men yesterday today forever second samuel 23 by the grace of god verse 15 second example 23 15. oh 23 15. quite a beautiful story of course this is before david was king you know he was in the process of running for his life as a fugitive hunted down by his own father-in-law his own father-in-law hunting him down so some of us can relate to that maybe our in-laws or our parents don't like us so much but we're still standing on the word of god hallelujah second samuel 23 15 through 17. i'll read 15 16 then we can all read 17 together and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the hosts of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord let's read verse 17 one two three and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men amen let's have a word of prayer again let's ask the holy spirit to minister to us this morning father god in heaven we're just grateful to be in your house today lord there's no other place we'd rather be lord than worshiping you with saints of light precious faith lord we're already caught up into the heavenly places the bible says we're seated in christ in heavenly places so father thank you god for raising our minds away from the things of the world and our minds are elevated on heavenly things as we're just saying our hearts are full of praise our hands up our hearts are full of praise hallelujah to the lamb of god we worship you we love you today we know you're alive in our hearts oh god we know your physical body sits on the throne in heaven so we lord we rejoice in that father god we're thankful for all you've done and we ask that the holy spirit would speak through the word of god just use my lips oh god lord just take my thoughts i just lay them aside lord and just let your thoughts flow god that your people can receive your word receive your truth be strengthened thereby make us lord mighty in relying upon you lord god make us men and women that are mighty in the word of god help us lord god today and we will give you thanks and praise o god minister to each and every need we pray in jesus christ's name and saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god i want to start with this question and then hopefully by the end we can answer it by god's grace most of us are christians here most of us believe in the word of god and uh i just want to start with this question is it possible for god to use you to make someone else more mighty than god has already made that person is that possible because what joy when you what honey i just want to start with that question we'll answer by the end because we're going to look at a mighty sister at the end of this sermon today by god's grace most of the time when you hear mighty men you don't think of mighty women right and we know we're using old testament types we're using the old testament types of mighty warriors to help us to understand what kind of a mighty person is a christian supposed to be today it can be more than a man it can be a woman right it can be a teenager it can be a child any person who's following the leading of the holy ghost can be a mighty person today praise god and it doesn't have to do with physical strength it has to do with spiritual strength amen and so that's the question i want to start with this question is it possible i put a little hint down there jesus said with god nothing shall be impossible amen there's a little hit for you by god's grace and i know it's a little smaller and here today we're missing you know quite a few people today but uh we're thankful for god's grace and let's just zero in with god's word let's be encouraged today praise god this remember this series you know the purpose of this short those series is to increase our faith in god so he can work mightily in our lives praise god and yes we want to see mighty miracles but we also want to see the mighty power of god in our daily lives amen and that's kind of what we're going to focus on today uh by god's grace because church we know this if we focus on the little things that we can be mighty in trusting in god every day then these other mighty things will happen automatically yes right like i was thinking about a few years ago i think it was 2018 when i took 2019 when i took lydia to that that banquet there in pennsylvania and i saw brother brian hawkins and he was almost crying and saying you know god or no the doctors told him he's got to have both hips replaced he was 45 years old and something just came over me i just i still just some like boldness came over me i just felt like the holy spirit came on me and i said brother you shouldn't have to have your hips replaced and uh i said have you confessed all your sin he said yes i said let's pray for your hips that they'll be made well now his hips were degenerating there was hips do not heal themselves now certain parts of your body can heal themselves right but hips do not heal themselves but something just came over me and i said brother let's speak life i said get your pastor let's go get brother jim he was here last week i said let's pray for those hips and i just spoke life to them right i spoke a life through those hips three days later i was i was working outside you know weeding the garden or whatever and i got a text from him saying you know the doctor got a new mri and he said we don't know how it happened but your hips heal themselves praise god that's just an example of you know just serving god every day loving god every day just trusting in god just winning everyday battles amen amen win the battle being a christian every day and then god will do mighty things in our lives amen amen just as we're just going about our regular christian life you know there'll be certain moments there's god god's going to make you known for something right god's going to give you a reputation right like david is known for slaying goliath and the queen of the south was known for crossing uh the desert in order to support solomon god's going to give you a testimony and there's going to be special events in your life and you're going to be known for being that kind of a person praise god but you want to be faithful and you want to be mighty in god's power every day so that when those great moments come then you'll be ready for that and that will seal your testimony praise god amen amen hallelujah amen so may god increase our faith so he can work mightily in our lives now i want to look at a few more of david's uh mighty men actually let me just review i don't know if everybody heard the wednesday night but let me just review those uh three that we looked at i'll just just hit a few of those slides okay not not all of them i'll just hit the one here they were mighty here yes yeah here we go they were mighty because god wrought the victory so the only way god would call someone mighty is if they let god move in their life because we have no power of our own what makes us mighty is when we say god i don't want my thoughts i want your thoughts i'm gonna obey the word of god i'm gonna choose to crucify my desires and cast out my my personal lusts or desires and i'm going to obey the word of god and when you do that god can do something mighty in your life amen amen see it's god whenever god does something great in your life it's god doing the work it's not you doing it praise god and so uh the three mightiest men were a dino the azite or as knight rather eliezer and shama and a dino was the greatest of all the mighty men because he killed 800 men all by himself at one time 800 men that's a lot to kill but he was anointed of the holy spirit to do so with one spear one spear he killed 800 men and he was the mightiest of all so we see the we see the lesson that uh the greater number of battles or enemies you defeat that makes you greater right in god's kingdom praise god uh the more you overcome the more enemies you defeat the more trials you overcome the greater you are in god's sight now we don't ever pop pump ourselves up or brag on ourselves we only brag on jesus but we still have battles that we must face personally and god is the one keeping track amen amen and god is the one who will determine who are those that serve god the most faithful praise god and then you had uh you know joshua had prophesied this samson experience one thousand that's probably what is that a dino spear looked like this long spirit with with this one spear 800 men he defeated praise god slew 800 men so be like this longer one this little cartoon picture there but so the lesson is a believer can defeat any size army amen and so today a believer can overcome any odds no matter the odds that are like george washington he was going out to battle and the odds were he was going to lose his life they shot at him he just kept fighting right he just kept being in general he got home after the battle took off his jacket there's holes all over the jacket but there's no bullets in his body amen amen any obstacle praise god a believer can overcome any obstacle as long as god is with them praise god amen amen they called him bulletproof washington a new testament believer praise god amen so it doesn't really matter uh it doesn't matter how big the obstacle or how how uh how strong the enemy is as long as god is with you as long as you're walking in god's plan you can be a mighty man or woman praise god amen and then eliezer he was the second greatest or we'd say because he smote the philistines until they could not remove his hand from the sword he must have a muscle spasm right some type of cramp or something where he had such power in his hand they could not remove the spear or the sword from his hand and this made him one of the greatest of all the mighty men he became one with the word of god and that's what we are becoming we're becoming one with the word hallelujah where we think the word we meditate on the word we speak the word we obey the word praise god our whole lives are centered around one thing the word of god glory so the lesson is we can be victorious by constantly clinging to the word of god so see we're taking these old testament warriors and we're learning new testament values amen new testament lessons by the grace of god how many will cling to god's word today you'll be you'll be you'll be mighty you'll be victorious if you cling to god's word amen and then shama all he did was stand all alone all the all the workers in the lentil field left him he was just standing in a field of beings and he said i'm not going to forfeit this field of beings i'm not going to give over my possession that god has given to me i'm not giving up what god has blessed me with amen hallelujah and because he stood alone he won and that made because he didn't run from the enemy because he didn't complain praise god because he was able to stand when other people would run away from the enemy god made him one of the greatest in the army praise god amen so we see these great lessons church you're victorious when you defend what god has given you praise god that's why we must defend and fight for everything god has given us right how many know that the peace of god in your heart is a very wonderful possession how many believe it's worth fighting for how about your good health you believe that's worth fighting for hallelujah amen every good thing you know the a humble spirit is that worth fighting for sincerity when you come to god's house and you you want to get your sincerity back is that worth fighting for yeah absolutely because those are those are attributes you don't find in other churches those are attributes centers know nothing about but it's god's possession it's god's inheritance for you and i and we must fight for it hallelujah hey that's just a quick review there so let me go back up here now now let's look at some of these mighty men by god's grace we see some more of these mighty men so we uh see a dino uh we see shama and eliezer now here's abba shah he's the brother of joab joe was a good man uh for the most part you know they all they all had the old testament just lays it out you know good and bad you know uh but he was chief among three more so there was three higher ones that are above all then there was three more higher ones so avishai was the leader of the second the second group of three not the top group right that was uh a dino so abishai was the highest of the second level so it's kind of like the maokai isn't it then they have like the they got the navy they got the navy then they got the navy seals right and something like that in other words they have special forces they have the best of the best i need to study my military for those things that's what i need to do praise god but you have elite forces praise god you have just regular soldiers but then you have elite soldiers amen i said this you got christians and then you've got wise virgins amen hallelujah you got foolish virgins praise god but then you got wise virgins and then in that then you've got peter james and john praise god right with brother man said they weren't any better they just had special gifts amen then we just have special gifts in the body of christ hallelujah amen where god can only use certain people that have certain gifts and church it's for every generation that's right the bible said david served the will of god for his generation we're gonna get that in a little bit of praise god think about it every generation on mighty men joshua and caleb were the mighty men of their generation amen david and his mighty men were the mighty men of their generation praise god jerubal haggai and zechariah were mighty men of their generation you and i can be mighty men for jesus christ today amen amen whatever should i do he took that another same weapon the spear and he killed 300 and so the top guy you know a dino at 800 this guy had 300 still tremendous victory amazing victory this separated him from many of the others praise god did the bible say wasn't he most honorable of the three he was their captain but he didn't attain to the top three there was just certain and we can see it today in the church like brother brandon we can see his gift of divine healing was far above everybody else right discernment nobody can discern like that it's just a gift that's high and above so and that makes sense he's one of the seven stars in the hand of jesus jesus has seven stars in his hand so we can see they're gonna you know martin luther had this all nine gifts of the holy spirit plus preaching and pastoring gift and all these gifts they were just very gifted people praise god so you have some that are just higher but then others can attain high as well not as high but they still have weapons amen they still can have a testimony church let me say this you can still do something for the kingdom of god amen you might not be able to read hearts and minds right you might not be able to discern the thoughts and intents of people's heart but there's something you can do that's why i get a song i can pray praise god i can pray until the laws fall down all of us can do that amen that's where you'll find your gift in your prayer life amen that's where you find it praise god so he defeats 300 abashad he is the second highest he's the second highest captain after adina and they they don't name too many so this here now we get to benign that's cam's son's name cam told me kept that name a secret because cam has been reading the book of us and he he knew he was going to have a son but he didn't tell anybody the name because he thought somebody would take the name it's a powerful name banaya right he was the son of a valiant man so i like that that's what i want to be a male a valiant man for christ i want to pass it down to my sons and daughters don't you in other words you want to see your testimony you live you want to see a pass to the next generation lord amen now banaya did many acts he's through two lion-like men of mohab now we can only uh imagine but remember when nebuchadnezzar was given that spirit of the beast and he grew claws like a bear you know and he grew feathers like an eagle and he literally grew those things and scales and and he was out for seven years eating with the animals right so he had been transformed the bible said his natural mind left him and the spirit of a beast came upon him right to humble him to show that the blessings in his life wasn't because of him it was because god sent him there praise god now we see something similar here i don't know exactly how to explain this but we have two men maybe they were into uh some type of martial art where it taught them to fight like animals so uh kung fu maybe this is like kung fu two lion like men now can you imagine their hair church i couldn't i can imagine their hair we've seen some pretty big beards here in the last few years haven't we you get your beard growing bless your top gone you can look a lot like a lion but two line-like men no doubt they had a beastly spirit you know they probably look like a lion with the lion's mane all kinds of hair on their faces but banaya took on two of them amen not one but two hallelujah and he defeated both of them and this made him mighty he wasn't afraid of the obstacle he wasn't afraid of of these line-like men he wasn't afraid of the enemy because he knew although they're lying i serve the line of the tribe of judah praise god hallelujah is that right and this reminds us of satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour then for some some strange reason he gets inside of a pit in the in the snow time in the winter no doubt they needed meat you know they had to go out hunting in the winter as well he finds himself he goes down into a pit so he just says i know i'm the anointing of god on me it's winter time i'm going to go down the pit and i'm going to defeat this lion because my mighty man ruler david david already did it amen and if david did it i can do it praise god if jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so can you praise god amen if he said that if he did that we can do those things as well praise god and notice i love that church see when i taught us you must be in season and out of season right the time to fight was actually spring time was the time to fight that's when the warriors would go out for battle in the spring that's when david uh failed to go out that's when he fell with bathsheba it was springtime that's the time the warriors went out to fight but here banaya teaches us whether you send two line-like men at me or whether it's winter time out of season you know i haven't fought for a few months and maybe my skills aren't sharp as they should be maybe my accuracy is off a little bit right maybe my fundamentals are off a little bit no matter where you place me god is still with me no matter the season god is for me no matter where i'm at my life god is with me and god will fight for me amen hallelujah i love this one dude he's through an egyptian god goodly man and the egyptian had a spear and all he had was a staff so he just had a wooden staff and i just had a wooden staff and this egyptian man has a spear so it's got a metal a metal point on it right and he's able with the uh with the staff to pluck out his uh the enemy spear and then he kills the enemy with his own weapon that's exactly what david did david used to sling kill goliath and then he cuts off goliath's head with his own sword amen that's the same thing jesus did jesus defeated death by dying amen he defeated death by taking his own weapon and defeating him praise god praise god let me get these lessons church these lessons that there's no weapon glory formed against you that shall prosper again and what am i doing i'm trying to raise your faith church hallelujah that god will do something mighty in your life praise god just believe the word of god just be mighty in the word of god yourself amen and no matter the enemy look it can be two it can you can be outnumbered two to one or it can be a wild animal or it can be a a goodly warrior and you're able by the grace of god to get the victory in every situation praise god and we don't wrestle against uh natural things we rest against spiritual principalities and powers in high places we found out this week didn't we haven't cares we found out this week that we wrestle against spiritual spiritual principalities in high places is that right amen and god is here to give us the victory of it and i love that you know haven was uh he had a good testimony coming out of that uh in that moment when the the little girl was you know talking about all this horror stuff haven just said well i'm a holy ghost christian and the devil can't touch me is that is that kind of what you said amen i thought that was beautiful praise god amen see she's learning how to fight amen she's learning how to be how to battle how to overcome and let the lord be mighty hallelujah mighty in word indeed praise god and the beautiful part was then we got to see the person again last night and they just stayed for a short time and haven got to play uh her song that she she sang for us and i just thought oh it's so perfect so perfect uh this this young person comes to spread all this fear but then before she leaves she's got to hear jesus a song about jesus a song about the rapture i like that amen i like that praise god amen because we have a choice be either given to the devil and take a loss take a defeat or we can choose to fight and stand up against the enemy and get the victory and overcome hallelujah glory a lot of great lessons there praise god satan's like a roaring lion but just be ready to fight how many be ready to fight by god's grace just be ready to fight god will deliver you a little more on banaya he was more honorable than the 30 but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard okay so banaya was like uh the lead guard of david's guards praise god and now from from verse 24 down to 39 it only lists names it does it gives no more specific acts but how many of these were some mighty acts by some mighty men and of course you see there's uriah uh a mighty man and then 30 and seven and all so there was the bible called in the 30 but then there were some that of course you had some that were well huh well i just thought of this maybe there was 30 and then there was the three three that's 36 plus david 37 might be i just thought of that i could be wrong the strange thought there okay so just some more thoughts there now if you look at the parallel passage in first chronicles 11 the bible says david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him amen now and then he lists the chief of the mighty men now notice they strengthen themselves with him in his kingdom glory i like that so as they as they saw david get stronger they got stronger that's what i want to see as amen get stronger i want to get stronger amen as jose gets stronger i want to get stronger amen we should look at each other and say my i see the faith of the young people i see the faith of the brothers and the sisters i see them getting stronger let's all get strong together praise god amen why would i be weak why should i why should i get weaker why should i decrease when god wants me to increase oh my hallelujah and really jesus is the only real david here praise god hallelujah because as jesus as his word gets more and more declared and more and more preach we get stronger because we believe his word amen now see they were going to make him king so they got they noticed they was getting stronger and stronger and stronger and then these mighty men got stronger and stronger and stronger see because david was serving his own generation by the will of god so church if we just do the will of god we will be mighty men and women and children for god's glory amen we just have to do god's will like just a simple example with the riots we're talking about and then the protest right we drove by the middle of wadsworth yesterday wadsworth ohio and they had like five people out there protesting roe v wade being overturned now like you know this is and they they they were pro-abortion right and so you know we have people that are just it's so sad you know that's half the country's that way you know we're actually in the root it's like a 50 50 split in the country right now but that's you know that's what they're fighting for you know what what would be a better use of time out there on the street or how about on your knees in prayer praise god which one would have more impact on the community amen which one would really make you how which one would you wax greater and greater what is the will of god now there's a time and season you know our founding fathers had to protest and fight uh the revolutionary war there's a time and season for those things but that's not the time of season we're right now we're not in that type of a violent kind of thing we're in a type where it's we need spiritual powers we need to do the will of god we need the wisdom to know what does god want me to do now do that and god will make you mightier praise god glory now remember these mighty men so mania right shama a dino i always forget that second one eliezer they they were natural men living in the promised land but they're a type of us because our promised land is the baptism of the holy ghost amen yes now church i just want to read this this thought came to me they were mighty because they rarely lost right that's what made them mighty they kept winning glory how did they they didn't lose all the time they won all the time now think about your life church think about my life are we constantly losing are we constantly winning i believe we can say we're constantly waiting hallelujah if not church we would be losing to pride which would bring contentions and strife in the church right or wrath which would bring arguments and anger towards one another gossip people would be sleeping around lying stealing if we were losing these battles you would see all these negative effects praise god that's right but let's let's just kind of shake ourselves a little bit and understand we're not losing these battles we're winning these battles amen amen that's so that's what makes you mighty what makes you mighty is that you faithfully overcome these little battles and then someday god's gonna have one great battle where god is gonna empower you and you are gonna overcome in that battle and you'll be known for that praise god that's what god called you to do that was your purpose on earth amen like samson his purpose was to defeat the philistines amen davis was to defeat the giants become king establish israel praise god as a king after god's own heart amen yeah that's right amen so so do you you have a purpose you have a testimony god is trying to establish in your life paul was a prophet missionary church age messenger that was his calling in life if my calling is just simply a pastor teacher you know whatever whatever you do whatever it is then i want to do the very best i can i want to please god i want to be a mighty man amen amen and so how do i know that i'll be a mighty man as i daily get victories overcoming all of my battles hallelujah it's a type so we're to possess all the promises of god we're to see ourselves oh i'm getting more momentum i like that barley like that barley bread that's what they were getting they're getting more momentum all the time more victories stronger in the faith glory that's when i see church i'm more convinced that the bible is right that we have thus saith the lord that nothing can stop us we're god's people we're standing on the truth god is for us not against us amen amen hallelujah never look at the numbers praise god look at the quality of god's word that's what we look at praise god that's what makes a people mighty hallelujah is their quality of their love for jesus christ their obedience to the word of god hallelujah now that's just a infographic i'm not going to spend any time with that it's just too small some of that i've already preached now i want to show this again more on how david became a mighty man and this is part of that song never back okay so that song really inspired me david was making this song and he said blessed be the lord my strength which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight my goodness and my fortress my high tower my deliverer my shield in him i'm sorry and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me so think about banaya how did he take that bow and knock that egyptians guys spear out how did he do it he had to use his hands so in his training david had taught banaya how to use the bow was it or was it abhishek oh staff there you go yeah staff yeah yeah but his hands had to be taught praise god in other words he knew god you know david had shown me this so god showed david now david showed me i know the right uh strategy right i know the right move i know the fundamentals with the staff and i can use this in other words when i use this as it's as if god is using this amen god taught me how to use this step god taught me how to war god taught me how to be a warrior god taught me how to pray god taught me how to be a real man of god god told me to speak the word god taught me to fight god taught me to be positive amen god told me to be faithful praise god god told me to be diligent god has taught me how to war amen amen i can try my best right i can try my best to help everybody but you've got to let god teach you how to war i do that you got to spend time with god hallelujah and then even his fingers right with the bow and arrow even his fingers the right way to hold an arrow god was so interested lord god was so interested in the details every detail of his life whether he's got a whether he's got a staff whether he's got a sword whether he's got a bow and arrow god had trained him in every part of this physical body to be a mighty warrior in other words god had taken control over his full body praise god amen that's why i say jesus take control over my entire body amen amen my mind my words my thoughts praise god my actions let the power of god flow through my entire being oh god this is good amen i love this amen beautiful trying to raise your faith church amen amen hallelujah so god may god teach our hands to give to the poor to give when someone asks you you might not be able to give everything but give something how about teach our hands how to pray how about teach our hands how to open the bible more and flip through the pages of the bible teach our hands how to serve at church and clean up after each other right help each other right minister each other teach us how teach our hands to be servants praise god some of us were pretty good i'm getting good at this one teaching our hands how to reply on the keyboard to show grace i'm a man from canada text me this weekend said brother i've watched you for years he said i want you to mentor me that's what he said he said i don't know how you do all this he said you can respond with such grace even though people are so petty and they criticize you i got them i can show you the message if you want to see it so even in that like as david's fingers were taught by god church our fingers can be taught by god to text the right things praise god right you know just every part of our being fingers and toes and and eyes and lips and ears and everything our whole bodies can be trained to obey the word of god amen amen god has taught me out of war all right god has taught me how to be a christian amen amen god has taught me how to overcome the power of darkness and god has made me a soldier in the power of god the kingdom of light amen glory i love this one too god has enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip god was not gonna let david slip and fall you know in a rock or something like that you know god god was oh glory god was ordaining every one of the steps brother jose my footsteps are established amen the lord has ordered every one of my steps amen amen amen to church you don't have to worry about slipping and falling into some awful thing god has ordained your steps as long as you're a mighty man as long as you're a mighty woman your your footsteps will be in the exact location where god wants you to step praise god in other words you will not step out of the perfect earth will of god you'll stay in the perfect will of god you'll accept the perfect will of god you'll do the will of god you don't want the shame of the permissible of god you want the honor and strength of the perfect will of god that's what the bible says see that you walk exactly or circumspectly not as fools but as wise see it's a foolish thing to walk against or leave the commands of god it's foolish to disobey the word of god do not let our steps slip let's not slip out of being faithful let's not slip and and just get into some things we all have to get in let's step in the right path amen let's go on the right journey let's go to the right destination god is order yourselves and god will bless your steps amen amen amen hallelujah after that song says you've taught my hands to war he said you will not let my feet slip imagine you got two line-like men banaya and you're not going to slip and fall where i fall down and then these two line-like men jump on you you can be sure wherever i stand i'm standing on the solid rock of ages amen i know where i stand praise god my feet know where they are my hands my fingers every part of me is ready for the battle i can't be defeated because god is with me amen amen amen glory who's kept you from slipping all these years jesus how you stood for these 16 years pastor brother jesse god he's got messed up say man he's kept me from slipping praise god he stopped my hands to war glory he sought my fingers height of battle praise god we redeemed the time because the days are evil i don't want to slip in the battle i don't want to fall in the battle i want to overcome in the battle hallelujah i want to understand what god wants me to do hallelujah now we got some young people here they're probably wondering god what do you want me to do with the rest of my life to my hair gets gray right when you're when you're walking the will of god god will show it to you praise god and then you'll know the will of god for your life praise god i think of that you know one example i just think i'll just share this one here real quick uh you probably i told this story before but i'm sure again up in sheffield there was a brother named brother herb old man old man he was just a backwoods kentucky country boy that's all he was he had a little accent like kentucky and he heard the message and he was married to a woman they both received the message and god delivered her from smoking i mean they were totally in the world right so they would party they were married but party all the time god brought them out of uh sin into the message sister josephine was her name i could still see her today she had those girls those great girls in mary you're a baby but they served god for all those years in the message a year before herb died his daughter who wasn't a believer she was in her 50s she come down with cancer and at that moment she was a sinner she repented of her sins she came in the message she started growing her hair out long like the bible says she started wearing modest clothes and dresses like the bible says and god healed her of that cancer and then her dad died the next year think about that for all those years her mom and dad didn't slip their daughter had spoke against them all the message isn't right you guys are fanatics you guys are holy rollers they just said we love you we're going to church for all those years they didn't slip they just stayed faithful they just kept walking amen and then the year before he dies he sees the mighty miracle not just healing of cancer that's mighty but a mighty miracle is a soul that's passed from death unto life amen that's the power of not letting our feet slip and walking in god's will for our lives praise god hallelujah thank you lord amen glory i love this amen i love this oh glory now church in the natural david eventually got over he wasn't mighty anymore but that doesn't have to be us here he goes out for his last battle he didn't know it was his last battle he goes out for his last battle against the philistines and he comes up against one of goliath's sons do you know this he was fighting one of the goliath sons i imagine that guy was pretty upset you killed my dad you cut my dad's head off now i'm going to kill you now david had fallen before but he's getting kind of weaker the bible said he got faint he got tired of the battle can you imagine he's like he just gets tired and the bible said he would have died ish by me being goliath's son he would have died but abhishek he was remembered he was the leader of that second group of three he sees his king he sees the original mighty man getting weaker so he comes along and he joins the fight and he slays goliath's son and they they say glory to god but he said now david you're getting too old now you're not going out to battle anymore you've lost your might right yeah there's a couple lessons we can get in your church right as we get older we might not have the natural strength but we can still have the spiritual strength and we get another good lesson brother amen right when brother jessie gets weak and tired and sick another mighty man can come along and pray for the weak ones amen lord if you see your mighty brother and sister discouraged or down or faint or tired or sick it's your job to come over and defeat the son of the giant hallelujah georgia then the bible say bear one another burdens and so fulfill the law of jesus christ oh my amen obeying the law of jesus christ when you see someone who's weak and they used to be strong in the faith but they're weak you've got to come alongside and help them win the battle pray with them encourage them lift them up out of their discouragement hallelujah lay hands on the sick they shall recover oh thank you jesus avishai secured david and they said no more battles for you mighty guy you re you passed your you you passed your generation of being mighty right you your days passed we can all see it now you pass but we don't have to brother random said numerous times he said if i had a choice of living 25 years whether 0 to 25 25 to 50 25 to 75 75 to 100 he said i'd rather live this 75 to 100 because i'd be more wise about it see in other words he'd be more he'd understand the fight better he said i wouldn't go into a meeting like i'm just killing a bunch of snakes that's what he said he would have wisdom to wait on the lord amen you have wisdom to trust god amen instead of zeal that's not like exactly lined up to god's will just human zeal instead of having that he would have wisdom to wait for the word of god and then know what to do praise god thank you jesus how many grateful for abhishet you can be an avid shy yeah you can be an avid shy come along when someone's discouraged come along and strengthen them come along and help them out you become an avid shy you help them defeat the giants of their lives praise god anybody feel mighty yet amen 30 minutes in anybody feel mighty hallelujah dave was constantly teaching these men to be mighty and there's two simple examples of how he taught them he didn't say oh you need to be more mighty he actually modeled it before them right right the the first one is such a beautiful example in first samuel 24 you know the story david and his mighty men are in a cave and saul was chasing them he didn't know they were in the cave he goes in there and lays down to take a nap and the mighty men are like david god has delivered them in your hand go kill him what david said he said god forbid i do such a thing how could i put my hand on the lord's anointed so he just cut off the skirt of saul's garment then when they woke up you know the story he said i could have killed you and saul said i know now for sure you're going to be the king of israel because you could have taken my life but you didn't take my life but all the mighty members amen were saying come on kill him kill him you can do it take this guy out kill this guy don't show mercy show justice show the wrath of god but the bible says avenge his mind say the lord see how the mighty men would learn oh he was kind to his enemies i need to be kind yeah in other words we kill a lot of people but there's times where you show mercy right they defeat a lot of enemies but this is your own people this is this is your own christians these are your own message believers right so he was teaching them not just with words and with weapons well here's how you use the spiritual selena you take it like this and you pull it back and then you bring it down that's hot it was more than that it was in his daily life watch how i forgive watch how i understand does god want me to kill this man does god want me to do this does god want me to do that i must see god's will for each situation in church he didn't do it just one time he could have took in the king he could have took in the crown that he knew was his but he was patient to wait on the crowd how many will be patient on the crowd how many will we patient until god crowns your life with that certain testimony yes glory amen god is going to crown your life with some testimony feed the philistines you know win this many souls to jesus operate this gift mightily this miracle this deliverance god's going to crown your life with something but you've got to wait on god to do it hallelujah think about that there's millions billions of christians down though through the last 2000 years billions and each one we're going to stand side by side and we're the bible that we're going to talk about through the ages how did you overcome how is the kindness of jesus expressed to you in your life and church think about it when it comes to your opportunity you're gonna have something to say praise god you're gonna be able to testify jesus was mighty in me praise god amen amen jesus taught my hands to war jesus kept my feet from slipping amen i was able to overcome i became a mighty believer because the mighty one never forsook me amen oh hallelujah the mighty one taught me to forgive amen hallelujah and i like this one the my the mighty one taught me to pour out my life as a drink offering you might not know the quotes on this but brother ryan made it so beautiful he typed david and the three mighty men to jesus and us and he said oh david just said oh i wish i could have some of that cool water from the ice i grew up in bethlehem that's my hometown i wish i just had a drink of that fresh water it's kind of like today well i wish i could just eat at that one restaurant you know oh when i was growing up for me it's like piece of nose pizza hopefully my wife's laughing it down if i could just have a little slice of that pizzanella's pizza and the three mighty men heard it and brother ram said this is so beautiful he said because that's how we should be like the mighty man the very least desire should be our command hallelujah any desire that jesus has for us to do it should be our delight to do it praise god we should sacrifice anything to do it and that's what the story is all about they they basically put their lives on the line just to go get a drink of water for their king and david when he got the cup he said how can i drink this this is the price of blood this you basically gave your sacrifice yourself for a cup of water i'm not worthy this kind of sacrifice only jesus amen only the mighty the mighty one only elohim only if jehovah is worthy of this kind of sacrifice so i'm pouring this out at the drink offering amen because you put your lives on the line only god is worthy amen that's what david said no he taught them look he taught them that you give the greatest honor you give the greatest sacrifice to god that's what that's what david taught these three mighty men do you think they thought less of him because he didn't drink that cup of water i think they thought more of him they put their lives glory they put their lives on the line for david just to make david happy just to give them something what can i do just to make your life a blessing david what can i do yeah i fight through i think brothers i was 15 miles there wasn't soldiers 15 miles thick all the way through but they had they would they call them uh outposts what they call them garrisons garrisons they had garrisons right like little outposts where you know okay and so they had to fight through all these 15 miles just to get a cup of water just for david because they loved him so much and then he pours it out and said jesus deserves this sacrifice we're giving this offering to god because this is the price of blood these men i'm not worthy to drink this only god is worthy to drink that praise god amen but it was wasn't so christ-like david was so christ-like pouring himself pouring out what was his as a drink offering unto god jesus poured out his life for us praise god hallelujah now i wanna i'm just gonna let daniel know sometimes i preach an hour and a half brother okay so i just can't stop and it's partly there they're doing too because they're they're listening if they all fell asleep i'd stop right away but i just i got i got a lot to preach today it's uh a lot to preach maybe i'll save someone wednesday night we'll see i do want to answer that question at the end let's see let's see how many i got here okay how long have i been preaching what does this say on there 53 minutes oh okay now we're all ready all right okay um okay so yeah let me um let's see how far i can get on here and then i'll probably let me set a 15 minute time right that gives me an hour and a half i'm sorry hour 15. then it takes me 15 minutes to close all right now let's understand now now we're getting to us in the new testament we've seen all these old tests i tried to give you you know types of the old testament for the new testament but let's look at some more mighty things in the new testament so mighty christians are full of the power of god they've escaped the power of satan amen praise god that's what paul said paul was sent by jesus to open people's eyes by preaching to turn them from darkness satan to light from the power of satan unto god that they'll receive forgiveness of sins and and heavenly inheritance amen through faith that is in jesus name the church each one of us today has to recognize are we under the power of darkness or light now here's i'm going to go through this quickly the bible tells us what power of darkness is it's adultery so sleeping with someone else's wife fornication sex before marriage is the power of satan right uncleanness luxurious living buying fancy cars fancy jewelry that you shouldn't you shouldn't spend money on that lecheviousness lawlessness you don't care what the bible says you do whatever you want that's that's from that's from hell idolatry making anything your god trusting in anything but god witchcraft pregnant devils hatred we know that variance means arguments that's from hell emulations when you pursue jealousy i'm so jealous i'm gonna do this because of someone strike i'm sorry wrath is passionate anger i'm so angry i'm going to act on it strife is positioning well i can do get here i can get this position and i can do that i can make myself greater seditions are divisions well i'll divide this family against that family here's these well this is my own teaching not in the bible i'm going to teach it anyway envy that's kind of like jealousy murder we don't know what murder is drunkenness we all know that revelings are late night parties paul says they that do these things will not inherit the kingdom of god praise god this is the power of satan now daniel how many how many people do you know that do these things brother jose can you translate that from ask him how many people do you know that under the power of darkness lots too many we know a lot of sinners right we some of our family members even some of our friends they're under the power of darkness but god has sent us as mighty men and women to help rescue people out of darkness and bring them to light and what is light light is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law so jesus and if we're mighty then we will exercise these attributes and not the other one now what's going to get message believers well a lot of us it might be uh we sometimes yeah we sometimes we make idols in our life sometimes we buy things we shouldn't buy we can't afford but we get them anyway for luxurious living wrath stripes editions heresies i know people that have built houses they should not have built it couldn't afford it and then lost them in the message so see you you just have to pray before everything it's a battle you're in a war praise god satan's trying to distract with those works of the flesh but you got to live according to the power of light the kingdom of light praise god now here now church i wrote down here the last thing i desire for preaching these is for us to become prideful thinking that we're the most mighty christians of all time that's not why i'm preaching that i just got done preaching against that but what i'm trying to say is that our weapons are mighty and when we use the weapons with god's leading that makes us mighty but we know it's not our power it's not our weapon someone gave us that weapon praise god the bible says when we walk in the spirit and obey all those things we showed our weapons are mighty through pulling down of complexes and that's where we're saying it's going to battle us too right complexes right so what do we need if we have a if we build up a complex in our mind a fortress in our mind we need something mighty to tear down that complex stone by stone praise god what um a wood piece by wood piece or window by window door by door praise god we need the power of god the weapons of god to cast down piece by piece and anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of god cast it down and bring every thought into the obedience of christ hallelujah i just want to make sure i emphasize that church you and i are mighty because our weapons are mighty talking about the holy ghost that's mighty telling somebody that's in the witchcraft that i'm the holy ghost to a believer that's mighty i'm trying to do some press examples just talk about it you know just talk about i love jesus i am a holy ghost filled saint i am a believer hallelujah starting that mighty word on your lips and start to see what happens you're gonna see good things happen hallelujah glory notice god and his angel called gideon mighty gideon was not calling himself mighty and so the same is true for us we won't call ourselves mighty we won't call ourselves the greatest that we won't call ourselves the goat right god's the one that called it mighty god's spirit sees something mighty in you and i praise god hallelujah we're not privately exalting ourselves we're only mighty because he's with us his weapon is in our hands praise god actually the bible says we have one weapon right the sword so we have one so yeah hallelujah now i hold the same scripture up there so the mighty word of god pulls down complexes now think of this billions of people are bound today in complexes right i've seen more recently in my family you know someone in my family has got a complex against my mom i can see it and then i can see my mom might have the same complex back it's just it's sad but see we don't have to have those in our lives now we all have complexes at times right we all do i do we all we all do but the idea is god gave us a weapon to overcome the complex and the idea is we don't become a slave to our complex now think about that if you have a complex you're letting the enemy have a part of your mind and then that's gonna that complex that castle is a fortress the enemy has a place on your land and he's attacking others through your mind right you're actually uh you're actually using yourself over to hurt other people that's why we need a mighty weapon to pull that down praise god instead of hurting others we need to bless others amen amen hallelujah we got a mighty weapon that can do that amen it's the word of god hallelujah it's not imagining the wrong thing about someone or something that happened in your life but it's imagining the word of god fixing the situation praise god all right you are not bound church you're free because of the weapons of the word of god aren't you glad to be free amen hallelujah aren't you glad you got a great weapon praise god you don't have to be a slave the devil can try to tell you all he wants he can come around like a lion he can come around like two like men praise god but you've still got the weapon of god's word to drive him away i can win this battle i don't have to lose this i have to have this bad habit i don't have to have this uh the sin of my life i can live above this i can be mighty because god's made me mighty praise god amen glory and again my grant said we've got authority by jesus christ that's the reason devils scream it's been a number number of years but i've seen the devil scream numerous times coming out of people i've seen that numerous times even our church i've seen that before numerous times that's good they're getting the victory and praise god that's what we want praise god listen you either scream for the devil or scream for jesus i'm going to scream for jesus praise god hallelujah amen the holy spirit is here god's authority the works that i do shall you do also jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i believe him so again we're not mighty we don't have the power but god gives us the authority god gives us the might or the power of his authority over anything that's all exalts itself against the word of god praise god now i think i'm going to read this yeah he says now we're sitting in heavenly places and the friends of christ lifted above the cares of the world into a realm of faith the church if you want to be mighty we got to leave this realm aren't you glad you get to leave this around praise god that's what i feel like every time i feel like every time we have service it's like god uh god kind of like transports me from the earth up to some heavenly place praise god and i'm just up here in heavenly now i'm a little higher here but that's not what i mean praise god i just feel like i'm elevating to a spiritual mindset where i feel so free i i feel uh full of god's power i feel full of god's word i'm so assured that god is true that his word is faithful he's lifted us up in heavenly places when we can get the the mind of christ the word of god in our minds we're in a realm of faith that's why the holy ghost fell so sweetly on wednesday night i don't know if you heard that singing at the end that was some of the sweetest singing i've heard in a long time and it was while the girls were weeping and crying we were asking for protection over their lives against those horror movie spirits and everything like that it was such a sweet atmosphere i knew i knew heaven came down that day and they've had no trouble the rest of the week by god's grace hallelujah i know god heard your prayer sister amen god heard your prayer amen god heard all of our prayers amen see we had to get out of the realm of humanity up into the realm of faith i like that he said what could happen there could be another pentecost amen i got acts chapter two christ is here if we could get the hardness of our hearts away is he with us is it true is christ in the midst he promised to be how could you know him i'm sorry how would you know not by the way he lived but by the works he done that's what he promised he said he would do it you know christ by the word of god that's being preached today right that's how you know about the songs that are being sung that's how you know christ amen amen the spirit of everyone the spirit they're speaking under the spirit they're singing under the spirit of everyone that's how you recognize the presence of jesus christ amen hallelujah i'm glad he's here today praise god all right well i better uh i better get close to stopping here so let me go down i've got a lot of a lot of good things for you here but um let's answer the question i'm gonna close with this here okay what time i'm at an hour now hour and five hour five okay talk about hour 15. let me close this is it possible for god to use you and i'm gonna especially put one of our sisters here that's why i only got two well three adults right three dogs almost one teenager unfortunately i love it all god's time is it possible for god to use you especially you sisters is it possible for god to use you sisters to make someone more mighty than they already are is that possible think about that for a moment david was a man david took these men that were full of distress full of debts they were stressed out they were bitter and they had all these debts financial debts to pay off david took these deading stressed out bitter people and slowly by the hand of god he changed him into mighty men and they the bible says i love it they wax greater and greater so tell me this when you first got saved you were mighty now don't go around bragging about it but you were you had faith and then god made you mightier and he gave you virtue then he gave you knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness brother kindness god is constantly making you more mighty just like the mighty men and that's what god did with david david knew like christ he's the type of christ david was already mighty he knew how to teach them this is how your hands wore this is how your feet go this is how your fingers go this is how you read your bible this is how you pray this is how you come to church this is how you give your ties and offerings this is how you fast hallelujah this is the things you allow in your house right we teach you how to war ahead and you become mightier and mightier all the time amen but is it possible for a woman to come along and make let me see this make a man more mighty than he already is yeah in the new testament got some good looks out there the answer is yes so sisters god can use you in a great way even your little ones think about acacia's impact on my cousin adam dembele okay she got the victory he said he said three years he's been clean from dope and cocaine and pornography three years he's the same age as me she's 38. she's almost 13. god used a 9 and ten year old glory i didn't plan to say this either that's this just come to me god used a nine eight and nine year old to make this man more mighty in the word of god and honey just so you know he told me he said he still listens to brother branham every single day and the church said amen sometimes sometimes i think you know sometimes we get so distracted we miss the great things god has done among us yeah and we always want more we always want to do more but sometimes i think we forget some of the mighty things guys do i just wanted to show that an eight-year-old can impact a 35 6 7. in other words it doesn't matter your age as long as you express the love of jesus christ it can move mountains praise god and that's what he told me he told me it was her letters her love that moved him hallelujah get your bibles go to acts 18 24. is it possible for a sister to come along and make a mighty man more mighty oh hallelujah thank you jesus i'd love to make a video about this one this is powerful to me it is it's just one of those it's one of those gems in the scripture right you talk preach about mighty men you think of you think of big muscle don't you and swords and spears and killing people and in the body you go to the new testament and here's a mighty man but he's got different kind of mightiness and a holy ghost-filled woman comes around and makes her makes him more mighty than he already was hallelujah amen verse 24 and a certain jew named apollos born in alexandria an eloquent man and mighty let's say it again and he was what mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus this man is already mighty in terms of that amen he's one of jesus's mighty men amen david's going out but the son of david is here hallelujah he was like i need a mighty man to teach the word of god he said i'm raising up apollos the bible said he was already mighty yeah in the scriptures right see church that's why brother you you're mighty music buddy that's just my opinion okay i believe it's god though see in other words you can be mighty in certain gifts in your life right it doesn't say one thing about his miracles does it it just says he was mighty in the word hallelujah amen that's encouraging to me see you you just have to be mighty in the gift god has given to you you have to be mighty like somebody else think of all those mighty men they didn't all have to be like a dino they could still be mighty praise god you can still be mighty amen amen you have to have discernment and you have to see dreams or prophesy that might be god's call that might be what god's called you to be mighty in but you just got to find what does god want me to be mighty in and help me to fight it and help me to do it praise god amen amen that's why i love the bible i just love this that's why i love the message it's just the bible revealed in a brand new way we never saw it before so picture apollo he's a mighty man you know why he's mighty verse 25 this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john so he'd get up there with malachi he take the word of god he start preaching there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way the lord that's thus saith the lord and god sent that messenger in this hour amen god sent the spirit of elijah in this hour hallelujah hallelujah and he said repent he was just pointing to the scriptures that john fulfilled preaching john's word glory preaching the prophets revelation hallelujah amen pretty easy to say what elijah already said praise god that's what we're doing amen amen we're just saying what elijah's already said brother branham what he already said in the word of god amen hallelujah all i'm encouraged today praise god i believe i'm a mighty man of god not by self-promotion but by the scriptures that god has shown to us well i'm either going to choose to be weak or mighty which one you wanted me to choose praise god i'm weak in my flesh but i'm biting the soul that's what i'm well that's all i want to say my god's grace hallelujah now go down to verse 28 so you can see for he mightily convinced so now we know why this man's mighty he could take the scriptures of john the baptist isaiah 40 verse 3 and malachi verse 3 different verses and just lay them out and show here here here and he would prove john's baptism was the right that you must repent and he convinced them that means he could persuade people to get baptized now george think about this how many people are simon convinced to be baptized that's why i don't care what anybody says about his height that guy's a mighty man in my eyes i don't care people make fun of him all the time i just stand right up far i said but he's got the heart of a lion my cousin just did that at that graduation party made fun of him i said i said matt i said he's got the heart he's the i said he's got the biggest heart i know he's got the heart of a lion i stood up for him because he's a mighty man of mine he brought me the word amen he stood up to my flesh he stood up to my pride amen he stood up to my denomination and brought me the word he convinced me by the scriptures of the spirit of elijah amen amen oh hallelujah i've seen it now i didn't see that before amen now i see it praise god why was he mighty because he could convince someone john's baptism was right yeah and that publicly he could publicly get up in front of people and show by the scriptures that jesus was the christ oh my why was he mighty what made him mighty he knew the bible he could preach in public he could convince people to be baptized to john's baptism and believe jesus christ was the messiah that's what made him mighty did he kill 800 at one time okay did he kill any lions how about spiders how about uh snakes boa constrictors no what made him mighty was that he loved the word of god and he wanted to see people baptized he wanted to see people repent and believe in jesus christ and so he gave himself to the word study the word of god and he spoke the word with fervency with zeal praise god and god called it mighty praise god amen one time this mighty man come in contact with some mightier people ah he come in contact with the husband and wife team the bible say anything about their children bob just says aquila priscilla the bible said this mighty man came in contact with a husband and wife ministry team can i say it like that i love the word of god i love the word of god they saw this they there's no doubt church no doubt they sat in the congregation they said ah that's a mighty different oh look at these people repenting oh you just took them out and baptized them it's a mighty gift of god he can really preach but there's things that we know that are deeper than this we can take him deeper in the message he's got good revelation but god's got a little more of it if we can just sit down and we can just sit down with him and have a little bible study with him glory amen we're gonna make him more mighty because the bible already said he was mighty right in other words he was only justified and sanctified he did not have the baptism of the holy ghost but here come a husband and wife team who had the baptism of the holy ghost they saw a mighty person but they said we can make him mightier by the grace of god hallelujah and what happened to verse 26 church and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly in other words he had a good understanding but when these two holy ghost-filled saints come come by now who did who knows who did aquila and priscilla hear the gospel from paul let's give her two it's sunday morning oh in other words aquila priscilla saw paul the church age messenger amen and the bible said they started a church in their own house amen yeah but then they got kicked out of rome because there was this uh racism against jews so they left and so see church god is in all of your struggles yes they lost their home they lost their home and god was in every one of them struggles praise god because he was sending them to go out and win other souls amen they had they lived in that city for a time and season they lived in that house for a particular time in season but then god had to move them praise god and god was going to use them to witness the word of god and make somebody else more mighty praise god god's the one moving us because god wants you to recognize someone their current position as mighty and god wants you not paul god don't want the prophet to do it god wants you to do it god wants you to find somebody who's mighty just brothers no no no no aquila and priscilla yeah and use those two to raise to share the message witness the message and raise them up to be greater than what they were in other words be baptized with the holy ghost a church we know there's no such thing as women preachers but women can give words of wisdom they can give words of knowledge they can give words of
