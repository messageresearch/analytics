[Music] [Music] [Music] let's go to Matthew chapter 5 by God's grace I wanted to preach the inspired thoughts out of this book here shaping the history through prayer and fasting so I'm going to start on that tonight by God's grace sorry limit your net makeup and then of course we'll be working on the Ephesians series still by God's grace one reason is because this book focuses on prayer and how it affects the governments and how Christians have a calling to pray for their governments and I think that's very important especially as we know the last showdown is between the nominations and the word right and that but the denominations will be united with the government so there's a great connection here and I want to just start looking at tonight like I'm just taking some of the inspired thoughts out of here I'll be tying it in with what we believe of course I want to start looking at that especially as we go towards the election in November right because remember it's got to be so close it could deceive the very elect if it were possible so whatever whenever the government comes down to getting really close we will get close to the rapture the government and the churches it's got to be so close so it's important that we pray especially for the government and that we have peace and so forth that we can continually spread the gospel so Matthew chapter 5 verse 13 I just want to start here with this salt of the earth tonight I want to start with that salt of the earth what was so inspiring about this book though was not only to see you remember a few months ago I preached on how America was founded through prayer and fasting that's what gave us the victories over the British was prayer and fasting but that also the last chapter is all about the latter rain it was so inspired and this this gentleman I don't know if he knew about brother Branham or not but I'm talking about the latter rain preparing for that so I just see a lot of there was a lot of inspiration and so I'm just going to be preaching a few inspired thoughts out of here because I can see how it connects to our day so let's just read Matthew 5:13 then we'll be will pray and have you be seated here by God's grace now this morning we were looking at how you're the light right we're locked walking the light we're not in the darkness we're in the light that's what verse 14 is all about and verse 15 how we are walking light we are the light and the light has shined in our hearts so it gives two illustrations that the Lord gives two illustrations were salt and we're light so we looked at light this morning we're walking the light we're redeeming the time that's what the light allows us to do redeem the time because we're not walking in darkness we know what we're doing but this thought is about the salt of the earth and how salt has two properties so we'll be looking at that tonight as we begin looking at history through prayer and fasting praise God so verse 13 let's read that together 1 2 3 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men praise now let's have a word of Prayer if every non you're heartless making owner to God here we're just so thankful to be gathered together thankful for another opportunity to be in his presence Lord Heavenly Father were just so happy to be in your presence as we said in your house Lord God we know judgment begins here so Lord let your wisdom let your judgments let your truth as we saw this morning proving what is acceptable unto you may you prove what is acceptable Lord God and in our lives Lord be the salt of the earth may we not lose our savor Lord as as Jesus talks about here Lord God let us keep our saltiness Lord God and let us be a a preserving agent Lord in this in this world Lord that lacks so much they lack light they law they live like savor Lord and father let us be the salt in light of the earth dear God we love you Lord God prepares for thy coming Lord in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god Beth should be in season praise go so I want to first look at the history here of a little bit of US history about salt I preached on this years and years and years ago I just thought I'd dig it up here real quick so saw as you know has preserving properties before they had refrigerators you know they would store meat in a cold place with salt but salt used in the Eastern countries was a chemical compound called chloride of sodium and if the saltness were lost or it were to lose it saver there would be nothing remaining it enters into the very nature of the substances says in Eastern countries however the salt used was impure or mingled with vegetable or earthly substances so that it might lose the whole of its saltness and a considerable quantity of earthy matter remain this was good for nothing except that it was used to place in the paths or walks as we use gravel this kind of salt is still common in that country so you know today we get our salt from salt mines right well in those days they didn't get it from salt mines at least in the eastern part of the world it listed in here they got it from some yeah they got it from marshes of Cyprus ok so that's where they would get it they said from the marshes of Cyprus so it had it wasn't just plain salt it was combined with something else and it could lose its savour and so Jesus he just got done preaching about the blessed the Beatitudes right how we must be blessed praise God we must do what God wants us to do and then he tells us you are salt of the earth and we lose our savour we're good for nothing right if the believers lose their saltiness their ability to be salt then what are they good for right I think we're seeing that today right like the Laodicean Church it's good for nothing you know why it's good for nothing because it doesn't feel like it needs anything right like we saw this morning I don't feel like they have to take care of their time they don't feel like they have to be walking the light so see he said they have need of nothing and so here Jesus says when they're like that they're good for nothing so we want to have a salty influence upon the world praise God and we know salt is a preserver I want to start looking at some of my notes here as I made so Jesus speaking to his disciples all of us and first thing is salt gives flavor how many put too much salt on their food now you'd have to raise ham for that see many times we think food is unappetizing because it's must be seasoned right you know it's interesting the Bible even says that you know job's 6:6 says that can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt even joe recognizes how things you can't eat without salt it's it could be important so in other words the presence of salt makes all the difference okay and as Christians we make all the difference in this world right so salt causes us to enjoy food that otherwise probably wouldn't want to eat right and so Christians give flavor to the earth but the one who enjoys the flavor is God right of course God and believers as well because listen any sinner should never meet a more wonderfully tasted person than you and I okay maybe not under saying that exactly right way but they should never find a better flavor of a person than a Christian yes because you got the taste of love right they they can sense love they can sense God's Spirit on you so but God is well uh God is the one who are gets it gets this this taste of our life because our life is a sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord right and I think we read that this morning and I'm going to check that real quick Ephesians 5 I believe it's verse 1 and 2 this morning just getting me get that real quick yes verse to walk in love so there is the love love of God as Christ has also loved us and has given himself and offering and a sweet and I'm sorry to sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour now you remember in Philippians member Paul was sent a gift by the Philippian church and he said it's a sweet-smelling savour and in them in the nostrils of the Lord so see when we serve other people we serve other Christians we even help the poor however we hover we serve other people when we sacrifice for them it's like a saver that goes up to God and that's what Jesus says here our lives give flavor to this earth in other words our presence makes the word the earth acceptable unto God right praise God I like that from job good scripture there I'm just looking at my notes here so without Christians on the earth what would God think of the earth wouldn't like it very much in fact that's why God destroyed it at the beginning with Noah right because because he said every thought of every man's heart was only evil continually and God said it it broke his heart that he had made man member elected that of grieving the spirit last week every thought of man hurt God it grieved him in his spirit but because the salt of the the believer is here God still has grace and mercy rather than wrath and judgment so see our presence as Christians makes all the difference and this is all through the scripture so this author gives a few highlights and I just want to read them again and reiterate these because this is going to show us how important is that we pray for the next coming election this is showing us we should pray for the Supreme Court right we should we should pray for righteousness to reign because one thing we know God God doesn't rejoice over sinners loss God wants to save the heart of God wants to save the Bible said his heart is like a shepherd who's going after the loss right he's going after the lost sheep he'll leave the 99 to go get the won praise God he has a Shepherd's heart a God's heart that wants to save others amen now this is clearly illustrated how Abraham and lot were the salt of the earth right now we know Abraham was much more salty right much more salty because his life was closer with the word remember God said I will not destroy the righteous with the wicked that's one great principle that God establishes it is never the will of God that the judgment do to the wicked will come upon the righteous right because 1823 says wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked will you give a righteous person the wrath that belongs to the wicked what does God say no won't do that Abraham asks he said that be far from me in this manner to slay the righteous from the wicked and the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right amen what a great consolation church if things happen in our lives if tragic things happen we know God is a righteous judge of all the earth and there was there will be no unjust with God there'll be no there were nothing that was unfair in God's eyes praise God and so if something happens where it looks like a judgment either that person was being judged or it was a test right there's some sort of test that the person had to go through to endure right in order to win a crown because Paul had to be tested right Paul to go to the martyrs Brook block did he get a martyrs crown praise God amen and so see this is a great example of how the believer is the salt of the earth God made it clear he would not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah as long as a believer was there as long as there was salt there he wouldn't destroy it and so we must recognize that as well now I believe this church according to Revelation 13 it seems like at the laying down of the mark of the beast all the foolish virgin will be killed right because they either take the mark of the beast if they take of the mark of the beast their name was never on the book of life and this but this makes sense to me brother bang the foolish virgins will have to die right away if not then they'll be suffering the wrath that goes to all those who worship the Beast but God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked so see how I see how close that is the foolish virgin have to die there because that's the hour they're living in they turn down the the token nine they didn't get bored again and so there's a temporary there's a temporary test there but see they get eternal life ahead hallelujah they get eternal life but they won't suffer the same wrath that the world suffers they will suffer the seven trumpets it seems like from the scripture they won't suffer the seven vials the seven last plagues because God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked how many thank God for that I thank God what a consolation praise God see praise the Lord now is there a level persecution yes there's a level of persecution for every Christian right it's in 2nd Timothy 3:12 yay all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution now as we said before we have we have suffered very little ours is mostly through family right our persecution or people laughing at us making fun of us but yours we actually don't know what's gonna happen in the future right we know there could be something like a squeeze where there could be some pressure but if we think of like Saints like let's say sister Mary just passed away brother Mike Dirnt Oh passed away last summer what persecution today go through you'd have to go down through their life and see what persecution they suffered what trials what suffering right what tests did they have to go through because the Bible said is you live godly you shall suffer persecution remember we showed you brother Rams persecution was being rejected by all the preachers he said I've never suffered any more than I did in Arizona at night when he moved out there in 1963 to 65 suffered because the men spoke against him the men forsook him and Jesus said you'll be sacred were forsaken for all men for my name's sake praise God I don't know you Amen so see there different idea or different applications of persecution but all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution hallelujah so we must be prepared Church to suffer persecution amen now look at this let's go to first Corinthians 1132 since you got your Bibles there let's read out your like this one this good thought God's judgments never come upon the believer there's only a test it's a trial it's never the judgment or wrath of God because we pass from Wrath right we pass from death unto life first Corinthians 11:30 to the salt of the earth and church the next thought will be kings and priests are we kings and priests are we ministering unto God for our government like a man and I were talking yesterday you know we were we were desiring for more people in the church but that was our question that we talked about who here and our church have been praying and laboring for more souls to be saved because jesus said you have not because you ask not so what does it do what does God always do he puts it back on us how are we ministering in prayer are we interceding to God right because that's our that's our current office our current office is kings and priests unto God Amen so are we are we active in the offices God gave us that's a great question and that's the question we got to answer praise the Lord our lives answer that first Corinthians 11 32 but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord see our judgment is just a chastening it's a child correction right that we should not be condemned with the world amen thank the Lord amen our training is like you correct your child right it's not judgment and wrath like on the sinner like Sodom and Gomorrah that's not all correction our correction is how you correct your child you rebuke them but it's not in love Scot Masada and Gomorrah was done in Wrath it was the wrath of God being poured out and Paul gives us that great consolation we are not of the world praise God will not be condemned with the world hey man hallelujah amen that's beautiful yet we must suffer some level persecution praise the Lord now so this shows Church is beautiful this shows the difference between hod how God deals with believers and how he deals with the world oh praise the Lord as believers we expect God's chastening if God doesn't chasing you he doesn't love you but the Bible said Jesus Chasen's all those that he loves hallelujah and if we submit to the chastening and set our lives in order then we are not going to experience the judgments that come upon the unbelievers or the world in general the very purpose of our chastening is to preserve us from the judgments that come upon unbelievers hallelujah now watch here let's go to Psalms 91 this is a beautiful scripture here Psalms 91 verse seven and eight Psalms 90 seven and eight verse seven a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked so here we see how God is promising the believer to get victory over the enemies and then see all the negative punishments that fall on unbelievers right a clear picture of that God is going to make us victors and how we Victor's by our faith praise God what is our victory faith is our victory praise God what weapon stops all the fiery darts faith stops all the fiery darts amen your faith in God our confidence in God the revelation of God's Word that's right I like that praise God so you see this see judgment comes on the rear award of the wicked because the wicked justly deserve it it doesn't come upon the believer glory oh another beautiful example Exodus chapter 7 through 12 the first Exodus amen all the judgments that they funded any judgment fall upon Israel no the judgments all ten were kept off of them praise God see God was and that's what the Bible says let's read Exodus 11 7 he bought up their acacia amen because God God kept the people of God they were salt to him praise God they preserved God's witness on the earth they preserve God's life on the earth the testimony so God preserved that salt praise God amen Exodus 11 7 but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how the Lord doth put a diff friends between Egyptians and Israel okay man hallelujah see judgment did not come upon Israel because the Lord put a difference between the salt and the salt and that when lost its savor right the unbeliever and he said even the dogs have to acknowledge this my great God makes animals testify to this and the difference is true to this day as well I praise God I want to they give it a little illustration here how a I when Joshua let's move that Joshua now a I there's about 12,000 people there when they conquered AI and so if you take AI and then you take Sodom it seems as if Sodom it was greater even than AI so if you take these numbers into account I like this thought here we could say the population of Sodom and Abraham's day was probably not less than ten thousand ten thousand people in Sodom how many got out of there three three out of 10,000 and God assured him I will not that if 10 persons were there God would preserve it my goodness 10 10 out of 10 thousand he said there's 10 there I'll not destroy the city but there wasn't so this gives us kind of like a ratio right now this is the remember this is the foolish virgin right one to a thousand it's like one to a thousand God would say I'd spare it for 1,000 but not what his program teaches with Israel two million came out and how many made the Promised Land one-in-a-million right Joshua and Caleb so that shows us the wise version is even a smaller portion than the foolish virgin because she's the faithful remnant praise God right but look God willing to preserve the city if one out of a thousand were righteous and you know Church that's a that's a Bible number go to Ecclesiastes remember this please a c720 I remember this from the study in the scriptures when I preach on Ecclesiastes please ac7 28 oh I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them praise God ha ha amen God's looking she's looking for a very take any small it's like almost any small group as long as there's a group there he'll preserve that City hallelujah look at verse now this is Solomon remember he says verse 28 which yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not found remember Saul Solomon's riding in a Backson and condition here right I mean remember we preach her this and there was numerous things that he said that you could tell he was in a Backson and condition but the point being made that God was willing to save Sodom if one out of a thousand were saved or what was righteous and here we see this idea God what God was looking for one out of a thousand what have a thousand if one person is is righteous out of a thousand while all the others remain below God's standards God's will have mercy on that place because that that's God's witness in the earth amen all right and God won't put his wrath how merciful is God Amen my goodness now let's take its United States you know how many people the United States today 325 million three now my question is do we have 325 Holy Ghost filled Saints in America one out of a million do we we got a lot of churches right do we have one out of a million Holy Ghost filled people in America that's a good question isn't it but we must have some type we have to certainly have some type of righteousness left if not God would destroy it right God would destroy because Sodom got so bad they didn't have one out of a thousand and God said I'll destroy it now we're not trying to look at the numbers but we're just kind of looking at God's pattern right we're not trying to guess how many people will go in the rapture we're not trying to do that we're trying to show how merciful God is and how God makes sure he protects the salt of the earth praise God yeah God the Bible establishes the general principle that the presence of righteous believers is the decisive factor in God's dealings with the community now I've talked to numerous friends lately you know they've been to numerous countries around the world and they've told me they suggest the United States is blessed beyond measure they've been all over - all over different nations they said we don't want socialism because that's the big thing right now in the Democratic Party you know they're having socialism they're trying to inject socialism and they've been to many countries and they know that America has the place with the most freedom right right this is the this is the most prosperous place where's the second most maybe Israel I was reading the articles this week out shared with by the Amen Israel's so small but their innovation is one of the best and then in the whole world I think they're top three in the number of technology technological patents for scientific instruments like medical instruments and inventions per capita or per person I think they have like the third or fourth most companies on the Dow Jones stock market they have so many companies that are up there because they're so prosperous now why are their prosperous because God said I'll bless you when you're in that country praise God see God's covenant even that many thousand years back God's covenant will still hold praise God God's faithful God's faithful to his word amen hallelujah and why is America so blessed because there are some people I know it's a small group but there are some people on their knees praying for the righteousness of this nation amen I don't know if it's 325 or not I don't know the more we talk to people and hear about churches and things like that I don't know but we should be some of them praise God and if not shame on us because we have the access to it we have access by the blood of Jesus Christ to the the presence of God and the Holy Spirit we should be drawn closer to God all the time amen hallelujah now here's another here on the same idea of salt preserving go to sagar thien's 520 we get the same idea with another word it's the word ambassadors saying you're Indians 520 sin Corinthians 5:20 now here's that's read night - that's a good Godhead scripture to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation who is in Christ God was in Christ praise God verse 20 now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God now there's a fine balance here Church how we are in God's stead but then the Pope says he's in the place of the Son of God it's very close right that's what the Pope the Pope is he says I'm in the stead of Christ but he's like he's saying I'm the only one that's in Christ dead that's the difference right there he's saying all of all of its in me right I forget I'm trying to think of that word now with the Latin the care is filleted a yeah Epicurus Felidae the vicar yeah vicars in the place of right in the stead of yeah so there he's saying I'm the one who's in the set but the Bible says it's not you Pope it's all the Bride of Christ amen that's right praise God all the bride members are ambassadors for Jesus amen and what our ambassadors you heard us before their person sent forth in official capacity by nations government to represent that government in the territory of another nation their authority is not measured by their own personal abilities glory but it's in direct proportion to the authority of the government they represent praise God so they don't have really any power themselves but they stand there representing the authority of their government amen and Paul said that's what we are we're standing in Christ place I'm standing in Christ place tonight amen representing his authority pray but I don't have any power of my own but we are given Authority that's right praise God so our position on earth is that of ambassadors we represent heavens government you know I appreciate mother Avon carry-ons uh a few years ago is just coming to my mind now I've forgotten about this but I was preaching on the keys of the kingdom and I read a scripture where Jesus was talking about ex communing be communicating people out of the church and Jesus was talking about when you excommunicate him he says he says whatever you loose on earth does he loses on prayer and how all right that's okay no problem it was that early today's recording or is it an older one yeah that's okay par me okay bless your little heart we haven't we haven't ordained need to be the computer worker huh did you pass the test yet but the scripture Jesus was saying whenever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven in other words if if you take somebody out front of the blood they're out from under the blood as long as you did it by God's leading and I looked down at brother a vine I remember him still right there in the congregation and I said woe unto anybody here that Yvonne has to excommunicate out of the church and the church s went silent I was like what happened I thought I was preaching I thought I was preaching on the anointing and he told me afterwards he said brother Jesse you totally does the Holy Spirit discern a situation there's a brother there who's been fighting against me and everybody the church knew it and I was about to excommunicate him because he was being sinning and doing some evil things in the church and I said woe to that person I don't know what happened after that I haven't talked to him since we just text he bought my book and he bought 10 copies of my book for his church and we have already talked about that but this is the thority like God can you imagine God gives me and God gives pastors the authority to lock people out of heaven if they're disobedient now that's enough of nothing I want to do I want I want to open the door I want people to come into heaven but if they won't come God for a ride away then God will use a man to lock somebody out of the kingdom of heaven because they don't want to come in and that's why where he calls us ambassadors right now here's a good thought and this I never knew this before but before one government declares war on another its usual action or of final warning is to withdraw its ambassadors I didn't know that before you declare war and you fight you take out your ambassadors because you don't want your masters caught in the crossfire that mean God's gonna have ambassadors on earth until the time of the rapture and then right before the rapture he's gonna withdraw his ambassadors they ain't meant Meli that he's gonna resurrect those bodies off the earth this whale a man he's gonna take their souls and their bodies amen that we're laying in the dust he's gonna pull them out and he's gonna glorify them he's taking off the earth before the atomic destruction see he's got it so he has ambassadors he has salt he has preservers amen he has preservation he's preserving his name and his glory on the earth until he declares war and then he withdraws his ambassadors who's the salt of the earth who's the ambassadors of the earth you and I are that's right so when God takes heavens ambassadors and they're withdrawn there'll be nothing left to hold back the full outpouring of divine wrath and judgment upon the earth that's why during the sixth seal the moon turns the blood right the Sun won't shine the stars fall and destruction is all over the earth and the two prophets are calling turning water to blood because there's no more ambassadors there's nothing here that got that smells good to God anymore all right it's like a dump right it's like it's a like a trashcan there's nothing worth keeping it for there's nothing worth preserving it but as long as we're here as long as our prayers are going up to God as long as I worship is going up to God it's a sweet smell to God amen hallelujah and he will not suffer the righteous to suffer with the wicked because he's holy praise God now the second function of salt so the first salt is for the first function is to preserve the second is to restrain the process of corruption okay in relation to food now in relation to food so it keeps it keeps corruption from setting in okay now not abolish the corruption but it held it in check for the duration of a sailor's voyage so that the sailors could continue to eat the meat long after otherwise it would have become inedible and so our presence on earth is the same way we operate like the salt in the meat sin is corrupting and we see it at work in fact it's like the works at worst it's ever been we know for sure the sin is the most deceptive it's ever been today it is corrupt it is corrupting in the religious realm the moral the churches the social political we can't get rid of it but one thing's for sure we can hold it in check we can hold it in check that's why I pray for abortion to stop I want to hold it in check praise God like I said the Supreme Court was meeting about that this week so we were praying for that we pray for it on Wednesday night I was praying for it at home that God would pass or allow the Supreme Court to rule on the side of Louisiana and they'd shut down almost almost every abortion clinic in Louisiana because the law is if any surgery is happening in a place they have to their hallways have to be a certain width and then they have to the doorways have to be a certain width and all the abortion clinics they didn't follow that law and so they made everything roads small narrow so they could save money and make more money and so now they're trying to they're trying to get all the abortion places to follow the regular laws for surgeries because it's a absolute surgery abortions are absolutely death surgery and that would be a great thing at that but if they change that or if they'd uphold Louisiana's law it would shut down almost all of them praise God that's what I'm praying for praise the Lord Amen I'll keep praying for that see sin is already at work but we're holding it and check praise God so that God's grace and mercy be fully worked out why why is it holding in check so this message can go to every nation amen that's right that's we're waiting for now you know the Bible says let's go to second Thessalonians 2 the Bible says God is holding it God is letting it be held and the other illustration you probably call is a cup of full of iniquity right remember the amorite s-- God told Abraham you know your children are gonna remain in Egypt until the cup of the am rights is full and then it'll be poured out then your proceed will come back and they'll possess the gates of their enemies but here's another view of that as well 2nd Thessalonians 2 speaking of the Antichrist in verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work that's the spirit of the Antichrist only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way see human wickedness is going to come to its climax it's hard to believe that isn't it it's hard to believe that this could be any more wicked than siling Gomorrah but yet it will be it will be human wickedness are going to come to its climax and it's gonna head up in Satan's Superman the Antichrist himself because he's gonna claim that he is God he's gonna exalt himself above all that's called the word and that's the very height of evil is for a man to claim he's God when he's not and then the Bible said he'll deceive them by unrighteousness he'll let them live in a lawless state where they can sin and enjoy whatever they would and still go to church Oh God have mercy see but God is now letting until he be taken out of the way that's speaking of the Holy Spirit God's letting it go until the Holy Spirit be taken out of the way right because the foolish virgin are not born again look they don't have they don't possess the Holy Spirit only the wise version possesses it and then when he's taken out of the way when the Holy Spirit stakin out of the way then the mystery of iniquity is revealed in all of his power that's right that's verse 7 he's the of sin the man of lawlessness he's also called the son of perdition or the Antichrist he's also called the Beast the Bible calls him a revealing and that's one Revelation church I don't want to see praise God the Bible said when the wicked is revealed that's one revelation I don't want to see I don't want to be here praise God I want to have the revelation of the the mystery of godliness Jesus amen that's the revelation we have amen and we don't want to see the wicked be revealed according to verse 8 it says yeah when that wicked shall be revealed we don't want to be here at that revelation we want to be gone but the Lord promises I'll consume him with the spirit of my mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming amen praise God so see the church at that time is gonna fall into a very passive attitude towards God they're not going to be on fire right because that's why Jesus spews them out of their mouth because they're no longer his mouthpiece they're not speaking its word see how important is that we speak all the Word of God we're either the mouthpiece of God or were not if we're lukewarm we can't be the mouthpiece of God but if we're on fire we become his mouthpiece we become the voice of God because the spirit and the bride say come amen glory so they're very pious they look religious but they don't have the life of God remember the remember of fusions five said they're alienated from the life of God they don't have the life of God the baptism of the holy ghost so see Church you and I our work is to resist and restrain the Antichrist spirit that is our whole job on earth just like salt does salt keeps away corruption our prayers are supposed to stop abortion amen our prayers are supposed to stop homosexuality with me we're supposed to stop that just like salt it's corruption from setting an amen we're supposed to stop it thank God we're supposed to stop it from coming into our church hey man we're so stop it from coming into our families and our church how do we do it by prayer amen asking God to move upon the scene asking God to cleanse hearts asking God to save souls that's our only way to do it it's the preach God's Word and pray and ask God to preserve our lives preserve our families amen because we're kings and priests now unto God right now just as salt keeps away corruption we must keep out the evil but God is holding him Chucky's he says Satan you can do this but you can't go much further than that aren't you glad okay go aren't you glad God will let Satan work on you in certain ways but it'll say you can't go that far stop you working been working on sister Naomi this week but you can't go much for it you got to stop right there you've been even harassed him brother Amen all week but stop right there Satan I'm holding you back amen oh yeah yeah because they're preserving their life they're my salt on this earth amen they're living righteously he says you can only go so far hallelujah he holds Satan in check and member Church nothing had happened our lives unless God allows it heard about Donnie say last night said so my house this in the live stream last night that's true just like Satan you had to get permission from God to go do that to job nothing will happen our life unless God knew we could handle it amen and since we are salt we know that it won't corrupt us whatever happens to us is not going to corrupt us but we are supposed to preserve and we're supposed to be the preserving life of God we're supposed to have a testimony in the midst of corruption amen glory so in the midst of death in the midst of suffering in the midst of tragedy our lives are supposed to be the the purifying agent of all that corruption we're supposed to stand there with the testimony that Jesus still saves god is good God is merciful he's loved he's long-suffering he's faithfully men were the witnesses of that because we are the salt of the earth praise God everyone else's life is corrupting into more and more sin and more corruption but our lives they met our sweet savour unto God hallelujah see it's the restraining power we have through our prayers through the move of the Holy Spirit in our life it holds back the effects of the Antichrist spirit and there's a lot of examples but I want to find a place to close that's already 5:15 praise the Lord now Jesus is with us and he promised he said John 14 he said I'll pray the Father he should give you another comfortable comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth for he dwells with you and shall be in you O glory I want to just say that for a moment some people wonder and you know we all battled - but some people wonder how do you know the Holy Spirit's on you you know the Holy Spirit's on you when you're obeying the truth because he's the Spirit of Truth amen he didn't say I'm always the I'm the spirit of always feeling excited he didn't say that jesus said he's the spirit of truth when you're speaking the truth when you're living the truth when you're living honest when you're telling the truth praise God you know it's the Holy Spirit praise God because he is the Spirit of Truth he said I'll be with you even that's why I can't be tongues can't be the evidence right or it can be oil on your palm I can't because that's not the Spirit of Truth a tongue can lie right a people can impersonate that but you can't impersonate the real honest-to-goodness truth of God's Word you can't impersonate that because you're either going to obey the word or disobey the word the Spirit of Truth will direct you to obey the word that's right so that's Jesus's presence in our lives as salt it's we who have the Spirit of Truth and he the truth and obey the truth praise God that's right I love that that's beautiful he promises at numerous times in John 16 and John 14 how he send the Holy Spirit praise God and note you know the Bible says this in first Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you remember we looked at that earlier today this morning in Ephesians 3 he said you are part of the building you are a part of the temple of God you're a part of the worship of God and you are the habitation of the holy spirit so I am a church I'm a part of the church praise God you are a part of the church and the Holy Spirit must live in you praise God amen and God is going to protect this earth as long as he's got little churches and running around Akron Ohio praise God trying to make a living and trying to raise their families trying to witness and pray for their loved ones God's gonna protect this city as long as there's believers here praise God because they're his representative they're his ambassadors it's his salt on the earth that's true glory now I want to look at the failure because met most of the church members are gonna fail right we know most of the church members are going to fail because he said few there be that find it so in other words a lot of churches are gonna lose their salt their flavor they're not gonna they're not gonna bring they're not gonna preserve and keep out corruption that's why it's so important that we preach the right doctrine because the wrong doctrine allows that corruption is seep into the church and the church is on fire anymore for God's Word right because corruption is set in and now nothing moves them the word doesn't move anymore because they're in a state of backslidden lukewarmness right no longer hungry and thirsting after the word they've lost they're saver and member Paul said this Antichrist only comes when a great falling away has happened first they fall away from the standard of being real salt of the earth being ambassadors they fall away it's called that word means the apostasy which is a departure from the faith oh god help us so Jesus says what happens to salt when it's lost its savor it's cast out this is cast out what out of the house of God and it's trodden under foot the son of I'm sorry under foot of men so it is good for nothing now look at church we ought to look at our lives and saying what good am i doing for other people because this salt does no good for anybody except to walk on our lives should be preserving helping other people's lives our lives should add flavour to people's lives praise God by praying for them by meeting with them right by encouraging them by giving them sermons or giving them books or whatever we should be adding flavour to people's lives but when a church is lost its flavor its thrown out of that Church of God and men trampled under it underfoot the Bible says my almost done here I want to get a few more things hallelujah glory go to Romans 12 here I want to go back to this here you and I know corruption is all around us the only way to overcome correct or corruption is with good right we have to be salt we have to have the opposite effect although the world is trying to corrupt us right by the Amen is trying to give us the wrong attitudes the wrong ideas is trying to take us out it's trying to corrupt us but we've got to overcome correction I'm sorry corruption we've got to overcome corruption and the Bible says in Romans 12:21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good keep doing good remember the Bible said be zealous for good works if everybody else is corrupting around you or theirs we know churches are being corrupted and they won't serve God and they won't pray and they won't give alms and they won't fast we just have to let them be corrupted try to help them out but we ourselves must overcome the evil effects of corruption with good works amen praise God because James said faith without works is useless praise God it's lost its savor faith without works is dead amen and so we have two choices either overcome corruption or we get corrupted we only have two choices so see there's no middle ground right if we don't overcome evil evil will overcome us that's why I've said it before when people are really addicted to things and got bad habits that's really evil spirits that person is being overcome by evil but we have the power to drive that out we shouldn't be under bondage to corruption we should be over we should be breaking the chains amen right how are we getting corrupted if we are the ones who keep corruption away praise God I understand we have you know complexes program teaches on that we know that but see the difference is we have weapons that are mighty we just got to get out the weapons and use them praise God that's whatever you that's what every evangelist and the message majors on speak the word speak to her speak to her you ever noticed that evangelist coming here speak the word speak well they trying to do get you to use your weapons praise God but I just think many times we're not always all balanced because it's like just speak the word in any situation that's not true you got to speak the word as you're led of the Lord because the same some of the same men that I've heard say that have situations in their lives and why aren't they speaking to that like they have situations that are just look awful you know different maybe loved ones or different things that happened why don't they just speak the word and fix it because you and I can't fix it when we want to it's got to be when God wants us to fix it or when God wants to fix it rather not us but when God fixes it see so we ought to be very careful yes yeah we're and I've said this before too we have to speak the word in every temptation right that's where we can speak the word in every temptation we get the victory but when we have problems like let me just give me example like with my mom and dad someone might say we'll just speak the word and they'll be saved well I what if they're not ordained to be saved then I can speak the word all I want and then gonna do and then go do anything but one thing I can do is I can make my requests known unto God hey Lori like what you know they were having when they had problems with Judas in the early church why did they just speak the word and bring Judas into the flock just speak the word well you can do that because he was preordained to be the son of perdition Oh Judas left he sold he betrayed the Lord well or wanted you to speak the word and bring him back see we can't always do it but I appreciate that though we need to use the word the word is nigh thee even in our mouths right so in every temptation used the word we have to wait for the right time to say it like program with hatty right why did another man he knew had he right all her life why didn't he tell her the other time just think anything you want cuz he had to wait for God to do it right he just can say well they don't speak what every what we can't say that we just can't speak whatever we want we have to be led by the Holy Spirit to do that did I tell you I think I might told you I I saw my coworker when we prayed for her and I spoke the word that she'd have a baby - I tell you I saw her a few weeks ago her name is Nikki she couldn't have a baby we did Bible studies with her and I just spoke the word one day in prayer and I think the next couple of days she texted me and said we're pregnant and they had a baby named it Mary while I was getting my copies done for my taxes I think and I got out of the car is like 7/3 in the morning and where I'm up and faring on I'm like hey there's Nikki Nikki how you doing and God bless you I saw her and she's like we just had twins so now they got three and she just texts me that year before saying I had a dream about you that you prayed for me and we got pregnant again so when she sent me that text I prayed for her just a real quick one like five second or 10 second prayer she had a dream I prayed for her and when I got that text buddy man I was really nervous like who because I know I can't speak I can't speak the word it's got to be God speaking through me now I didn't confirm that with her about the text but she said she had a dream of me praying for her to have more children I said a prayer there and the next time I see her she has twins now she's got three oh god is so good Church he's faithful that's encouraging because you know it's nothing we can do it's all about falling into God's plans we must find our purpose from God and do our purpose praise God so Church how do we overcome corruption do good be the salt be salty amen but man said be salty salt that's true because there's a kind of salt that's lost to saltiness when we've lost the ability to bring press to preserve righteousness then we know we better run to God and say God make me salty again if we're seing corruption and bad habits and and addictions creeping in our lives we better run to God say God make me salty again restore my salt right that's right restore my salt now that's about the end of the chapter there with but I got a few more thoughts I want to share so yeah good I got about couple more minutes here yeah couple more minutes let me share a few more things I want to share from this morning I didn't get to just a couple minutes here yeah I'm just gonna close to this go to first Chronicles 25 this really blessed me I was sharing this with by the Amen yesterday I was reading I'm reading a book called be fruitful multiply and it's all about how we need to have we have to multiply our children of course that's right up my alley praise the Lord but I think it should be up every Christians alley I really believe that it's the scripture but anyways that's our voice about that and you know why you know why it was quickly me yesterday just because because God loves life and anyone who has life the life of God will love God's creation will love God's life that's why people limit their families and things because they don't have a life of God how can you say how can you say you have the spiritual life of God and then limit God's natural life how can how can you say how can you say you wanna you want to see the church grow with spiritually with numbers but then you don't want your natural family to grow do you see what I'm saying people say they all we want to see all the so saved and we want the Great Commission me fulfilled we want to see Moore's but you don't want to seem natural children of God that doesn't make any sense oh yeah we have the life we want the life of God but you don't want more of God's images it's just a shame but you know what it just started in the last hundred years the church has taken a nosedive I'm talking about the Protestants now of course the Catholics there who knows what they're so yeah I know there's all the conspiracy theories but they never believed that to the last hundred years and then they got started in contraceptives and everything I've been reading about that now let's read this and remember that in Jeremiah one God told Jeremiah before I formed you in the belly I knew you and I ordained you to do what be a prophet to the nation's so that means God knows each one of you God knew each one of you before you were formed in your mother's womb and he had a purpose for you praise God amen he called you to be salt on this earth you have a purpose and that's why that's why mothering and that's why fathering is so important because you are salt in that home right and you have to preserve you have to drive away corruptness with the salt of your life I say this you got to drive out the corruption of your children's corruption until they get born again that's right you have to preserve their life that's why the Bible said unbelieving woman I'm sorry believing women should remain with her unbelieving husband or vice versa because her life sanctifies his life they met there it is glory because she saw if she's a believer she sought to him preserving his life she can pray for him she can minister him she can be a light to him she can witness and by her life by her words and vice versa the man also was unbelieving wife he preserves that life because he's salt so first Chronicles 25 1 moreover David in the captains of the hosts separated to the service of the sons of Asaph and of him on and of Jud Thun who should prophesy with harps oh look at that they're gonna prophesy with harps so you get him a harp now this ain't a heart but you get him one of these harps you get the heart going and pretty soon they're gonna get in the Spirit of God and they're gonna go to prophesy and aim at the spirit of God's gonna come upon them David ordained this he said if you want to see the Spirit of God move get somebody worshiping God amen with psalteries with the symbols my you're gonna prophesy with symbols we got a yeah we got kind of like drums right got like percussion and the number of the workmen according their service was names all their services they go down to verse 4 now I'm seeing my family I'm seeing myself in this scripture about being salt and your purpose here verse 4 of Hama and the sons of Haman baqia math Inayat uz ow GBL Jeremiah Hananiah hen and I le thatthe get get LT and Rome am te sir Josh Beca ha I'm asking bed to verse 5 all these were the sons of Hamas him and the King seer in the words of God to lift up the horn so God says all these were sons and what was their purpose to lift up the horn and worship God to blow the trumpet and announce times of worship God gave him on sons and their whole purpose was to raise a horn unto God and glorify God with the horn Lori look and God gave him on 14 sons and three daughters why did God give this man 14 sons and three daughters verse 6 tells us all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the Lord with what symbols psalteries harps for what for the service of God according to the Kings order to Asaph Judaism and himand praise God let's stand to our feet did you catch that David is trying to restore worship and he says I need people that will get on the harps and the Psalms and the cymbals I need someone to worship God and God said I gave him on 14 sons and three daughters for the service of the congregation the whole point he gave him 17 children was as they could sing songs and worship God because brahim and David was a man after God's own heart and he wanted God to be worshipped in the house of God so God said I'll bless him on and I'll give him 17 children and they're the ones that are going to get on the sultry and the harps and the cymbals and they're gonna get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen and they're gonna worship God praise the Lord so just as Jeremiah had a purpose to be a prophet and God ordained him that so did these children have a purpose and their whole purpose in life was to praise God in the house of the Lord what c'mon is gonna stand out the day of judgment and Jesus gonna ask him what you do with those sons and daughters I gave you he's gonna say I train him to play the cymbals he said I train them to play the harp I train them to sing songs in the house of God and Jesus either say well done good and faithful servant that's why I sent them to do service in my house praise God just like Jeremiah's gonna say Jeremiah were you faithful with the prophet ministry I cause you do yes I was people come welcome come into the kingdom of God prepared for you from the foundation of the world other than the church are we being the salt of the earth tonight we better be praise God musicians if you'll come his children were for song in the house of Lord for the service of the house of God and that is what they will be judged by did they live to God's purpose or not did they be salt do they choose to be salt or did they lose their saber what about RAM say one person out of their place in this church can cause people to get sick right one person just like the example was from the book of Joshua right akin one person not fulfilling their purpose in life can cause others to to fall right because they're not driving out the corruption but if we're salt we're to hold back the corruption and say God God's gonna protect us and nothing will come nigh our dwelling place if we fulfill God's call for our life so what am I saying I'm saying God give me all these children for song in the house of the Lord I'm talking about you honey somebody occasion talking about you when you sing girls talk about you in fact I was talking about principal a few weeks ago he said you're almost that he said you're almost like Jesus with the 12 disciples and I said that's what I need 12 disciples because really isn't that what they are aren't they my disciples aren't I supposed to go into all the world and preach well that's apostles but whoever whoever's around me aren't I supposed to preach to them and make disciples absolutely why'd God give him 17 under 17 there's a bride number right there praise God hallelujah for song God needs someone to worship him by song in his house and then all's we have to do is fulfill your purpose be the salt overcome evil with good how many want to be salt tonight how many want to overcome evil with good praise God that's how we're to prayer here how many father my hands up Lord God we've heard about the salt of the earth [Music] Lord you have a purpose for salt it preserves it keeps out corruption you had a purpose for Jeremiah he was too rude up hold up and plant and build you have a purpose for himand and his children they were for the service of God

with your authority Lord declaring the Kingdom of Heaven representing the Kingdom of Heaven an acronym in our hometowns Lord God where we'll all go back Lord willing tonight [Music] the fathers we
