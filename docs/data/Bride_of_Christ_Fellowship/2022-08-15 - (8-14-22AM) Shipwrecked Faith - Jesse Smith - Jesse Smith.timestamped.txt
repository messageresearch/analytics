[0:02] first timothy 1 verse 18.
[0:14] it's a little hot in here so i didn't
[0:15] put the air on and then i got the fan on
[0:17] so
[0:19] mouth guy or bang if you want to open
[0:20] the window you don't have to have the
[0:21] same if it gets hot and you want to hold
[0:22] it in you'll feel free to do that in
[0:24] god's grace
[0:25] first timothy 1 18 will read 18 19 and
[0:28] 20.
[0:31] so we like to look at shipwrecked faith
[0:33] as i said on wednesday this is a thought
[0:35] regarding the judas iscariot group
[0:39] and i was listening to a baptist
[0:40] preacher last week and i heard him say a
[0:42] few things i'm like that is an
[0:44] unbelievable thought
[0:45] such a good thought
[0:47] like looking for all the different
[0:48] metaphors
[0:50] that describe the judas group so there's
[0:53] praise god we are warriors inside of a
[0:56] war going on praise god
[0:59] and yet in the midst of the war doesn't
[1:00] god give us peace
[1:01] ours glad for the peace of god praise
[1:03] god
[1:04] next verse let's read this one together
[1:05] 19
[1:06] one two three
[1:08] holding faith and a good conscience
[1:11] which some having put away concerning
[1:14] faith have made shipwreck
[1:17] so first he gives it the metaphor of a
[1:19] war and now he gives the metaphor of a
[1:22] ship in the war that has been sunk
[1:26] verse 20 i'll read this one of whom is
[1:29] hymenus and alexander whom i've
[1:31] delivered unto satan that they may learn
[1:33] not to blaspheme so here we have an
[1:35] understanding
[1:37] a person who falls away like judas is
[1:39] scared he was in the war or she was in
[1:41] the war
[1:42] but then their ship was sunk
[1:45] and the purpose was because they
[1:46] blasphemed the holy spirit
[1:49] praise god and that's essentially what
[1:51] judas iscariot did
[1:53] he spoke evil against jesus he sold out
[1:55] jesus for money
[1:57] speaking evil against it let's have one
[1:58] more word of prayer if we can't hear by
[1:59] god's grace let's bow our heads father
[2:01] god in heaven we've loved the songs
[2:03] we've enjoyed the worship lord god so
[2:04] much it's such a blessing god
[2:07] turn our eyes on jesus today lord we'll
[2:09] never look away from you lord always
[2:10] look to you in your word
[2:12] thank you lord jesus for your mercy and
[2:14] grace we wouldn't take nothing for our
[2:15] journey now lord god we're so grateful
[2:17] to be christians
[2:18] called to this good ground group out of
[2:20] the four grounds we're so grateful lord
[2:22] to be on the good ground
[2:24] so father we ask god today you anoint
[2:26] this word anoint me as i preach it lord
[2:27] anoint the saints to receive it lord god
[2:30] and we take warning from it but also
[2:32] encouragement that we'll never be in
[2:33] this group lord that we're of a
[2:35] different kind we're a different quality
[2:36] lord god hallelujah speak to your people
[2:39] bless us god in your divine presence and
[2:41] father we'll rejoice in all that you say
[2:43] and do lord and all that your spirit
[2:44] does among us may your spirit have a
[2:45] free course this morning move amongst
[2:47] your people give us that daily revival
[2:49] that we need we pray in jesus christ's
[2:52] name the saint said
[2:53] amen god bless you mean praise god i
[2:56] have a quote i'd like to share i'm going
[2:57] to review this um
[2:59] briefly i'm going to review
[3:01] this thought uh
[3:03] back in 2016 i preached that thought
[3:05] scarcely saved scarcely lost
[3:08] i always remember that sermon because
[3:09] scott walker and his wife came up and
[3:11] said we just want to after service we
[3:13] just want to thank you for preaching
[3:14] that they said
[3:15] we had never heard that before i said
[3:16] well praise the lord you know it's in
[3:18] the church eighth book
[3:19] i want to bring it out but that's back
[3:21] in 2016 over the other sanctuary there
[3:23] but i'm just going to review that rope
[3:25] briefly
[3:26] and this is the big chart
[3:28] but if we start at the top everybody is
[3:30] either going to be saved or lost
[3:32] okay and then brother answer there's
[3:33] three kinds of believers which is true
[3:35] you have believers
[3:36] make believers and unbelievers
[3:39] but then the believer then you have two
[3:41] kinds of believers
[3:42] right you have the wise and foolish
[3:44] virgin
[3:46] and then we have three or we have
[3:47] examples of all four kinds in jesus day
[3:50] you have jesus
[3:51] wise virgin same thief jewish virgin
[3:54] judas was the make-believer that's kind
[3:56] of what we're looking at today and the
[3:57] lost thief never believed to begin with
[3:59] now it's fully taught in scripture i
[4:01] think this would be good for austerlina
[4:02] to see that as well maybe brother daniel
[4:04] they've never seen this before i was
[4:06] going to briefly go this revelation 22
[4:08] 11 says there's four kinds of states
[4:10] you'll be in at the time of the
[4:12] rapture right when you cannot change
[4:15] what you are any anymore
[4:16] you either be holy which is wise virgin
[4:19] righteous jewish virgin filth be like
[4:21] judas or unjust
[4:25] second timothy 2 paul says you're one of
[4:27] these kinds of vessels you're either a
[4:29] gold vessel praise god silver
[4:32] wood or earth
[4:33] these are made to be burned praise god
[4:35] but these are made for service prayer by
[4:37] god
[4:38] you are made for god's service
[4:40] hallelujah god wants to keep you praise
[4:42] god amen he's going to use you for his
[4:44] service there's four kinds of grounds
[4:46] jesus said there's a good ground which
[4:47] is a good and honest heart a quiz maokai
[4:49] on that this week at our house i said
[4:51] what how did jesus describe what two
[4:53] words did jesus describe that good
[4:54] ground good
[4:56] and honest
[4:58] that's a good and honest heart praise
[4:59] god
[5:00] the thorny heart they let the cares the
[5:02] riches grow up and the cares of the
[5:04] world grow up and it choke the
[5:07] the plant so it didn't bring forth fruit
[5:10] so the only one that had fruit was the
[5:11] good ground
[5:13] uh we'll get to this one here judas was
[5:15] the stoney ground it sprang up real fast
[5:17] but it had no root
[5:18] it wasn't rooted and grounded in christ
[5:20] amen
[5:22] and then you have the wayside doesn't
[5:23] even fall on any ground at all
[5:25] and of course we have these four kinds
[5:27] of abraham today abraham harmony
[5:30] lot
[5:31] mrs lot and the sodomites
[5:33] you had four kinds in enoch's day enoch
[5:36] noah remember noah was uh
[5:38] was he was born hundreds of years after
[5:40] the enoch was even raptured uh but the
[5:43] fact was their lifetimes were 900 years
[5:46] so in other words noah was one
[5:47] generation after enoch
[5:49] that's why we would call it still the
[5:51] same day praise god
[5:53] we also know that because uh
[5:55] jude says that jesus christ uh comes
[5:57] back
[5:58] uh or enoch prophesied of jesus christ
[6:00] coming back at armageddon with ten
[6:02] thousand of his saints and the bible
[6:04] says when jesus was crucified his spirit
[6:06] went down the soul and preached to the
[6:08] souls that were imprisoned that rejected
[6:10] him as in the days of noah praise god
[6:12] right which some of those would have
[6:13] been alive during the days of enoch
[6:15] there's a connection between enoch and
[6:16] noah through the scripture
[6:18] then you had borderline believers in the
[6:20] days of noah that you maybe wanted to
[6:21] get in the heart but didn't and then you
[6:24] had the mockers that never wanted to get
[6:25] into the ark
[6:26] in the days of jacob i put a question
[6:28] mark here jacob was truly a believer now
[6:30] rachel she was a a
[6:32] beautiful woman outwardly
[6:34] uh but lacked the character we'd say
[6:36] because she brought gods into her tent
[6:39] and then died of premature death we'd
[6:41] say
[6:43] and then esau was the make-believer he
[6:44] believed for a while but then uh went
[6:47] despite uh jacob and
[6:49] his mother's desires here i'm sorry
[6:52] isaac and rebecca's desires and then the
[6:53] hittites of course they never believed
[6:55] to begin with
[6:56] and then the days of uh elijah you had
[6:58] micaiah and elijah you could put in
[7:00] there jehoshaphat was the borderline he
[7:02] kind of made some deals with ahab right
[7:05] he kind of made some alliances with ahab
[7:07] who was a make believer the judas group
[7:10] he believed for a while you know
[7:12] repented a little bit but then of course
[7:13] sold out
[7:15] the truth sold out elijah for his wife's
[7:17] sake and of course jezebel never
[7:18] believed to begin with
[7:20] okay and just give you a visual uh
[7:23] there's two groups saved and lost all
[7:25] the same you get a white robe praise god
[7:27] they're saved because of jesus
[7:29] righteousness not their own
[7:31] and just to give you a visual of the
[7:33] four kinds here now this is i know i
[7:34] should have made these pictures bigger i
[7:35] just didn't
[7:36] think of it until later but that's a
[7:38] picture of the rapture so there's two
[7:40] kinds of save one group is going in the
[7:42] rapture praise god another group though
[7:44] there's a person bowing at the white
[7:46] throne judgment they've got a bow there
[7:48] and they've got to just humble
[7:50] themselves and their whole
[7:52] their whole life is going to be played
[7:53] before as a book the bible says the
[7:54] books were opened and the book of life
[7:56] so the book of their life is going to be
[7:58] played and
[7:59] uh but they're going to have eternal
[8:00] life they're going to be saved
[8:02] now here you have judas he's leaving the
[8:04] the last supper there again i'm sorry
[8:06] these are so small
[8:07] he's lost he's the son of perdition son
[8:09] of destruction because he sold out jesus
[8:12] that's kind of what we're looking at
[8:13] today we're looking at these filthy ones
[8:15] uh these shipwrecked souls and then you
[8:17] have like pharaoh that's from the movie
[8:19] ten commandments with moses and
[8:21] brother talk about that movie pharaoh he
[8:23] was an unbeliever and god used god knew
[8:26] he would never believe that's why god
[8:28] kept allowing plague after plague his
[8:30] heart got harder and harder so look
[8:32] church no matter how many miracles he
[8:33] saw he was always going to harden his
[8:34] heart that's right
[8:36] so miracles they can help people believe
[8:38] but miracles will not make anybody
[8:40] believe that's right
[8:42] right and the greatest miracle is a
[8:43] repentant heart praise god
[8:45] so just a good thought there said let's
[8:48] end my review like i said i'm going to
[8:49] keep it short i got a lot of scriptures
[8:50] here
[8:51] so i like to look on this thought here
[8:53] uh shipwrecked fate
[8:55] 13 metaphors of the judas iscariot group
[8:59] so i trust this to be a blessing to you
[9:00] and
[9:02] i pray so hard on wednesday i'm going to
[9:03] really try not to pray so hard tonight
[9:05] today by god's grace i just
[9:08] the holy spirit come on me i just got
[9:09] real bold there in god's presence
[9:11] my throat kind of was sore all week by
[9:13] god's grace but anyways let's look at
[9:15] this so we have 13 metaphors now a
[9:17] metaphor is a story but it's not a
[9:19] literal story right it's a symbol a
[9:22] metaphor is like a symbol of something
[9:24] that happens so there's 13 metaphors
[9:27] of judas's group
[9:30] and so i believe church they're placed
[9:32] in there
[9:33] to warn those that are on the borderline
[9:36] like israel to warn them you really must
[9:38] cross over to canaan praise god you must
[9:41] cross over into salvation do not stop
[9:44] shore praise god press on until you
[9:47] inherit every promise of god amen amen
[9:50] do not fall short of any promise of god
[9:52] amen believe to your deathbed and then
[9:54] believe even on your deathbed amen amen
[9:57] amen just believe to the end praise god
[9:59] trust god with all your heart soul and
[10:01] life and strength amen amen
[10:03] now we read our texts here the first one
[10:05] is shipwrecked faith
[10:08] okay and this kind of they're kind of
[10:10] interconnected you'll see a little bit
[10:11] of overlap in some of them by the grace
[10:13] of god let me set the timer here a
[10:15] little nervous like i'll i'll only
[10:16] preach like 30 minutes so i don't know
[10:18] if that's possible but
[10:20] i want to make sure i go a little longer
[10:21] or at least an hour so we'll see
[10:24] so we read our text here now paul gives
[10:26] two metaphors
[10:28] he tells timothy you are fighting a
[10:31] warfare how many know you're in a war
[10:32] today not a picnic praise god
[10:35] now do we want to believe god that god
[10:37] can put us in the cleft of the rock and
[10:39] hide us away at times absolutely
[10:41] but where's that at that's mostly in
[10:43] your soul praise god now you're going to
[10:45] have some of those in your your mind and
[10:46] your body as well where you say god the
[10:49] pressures of life are so overwhelming
[10:51] i'm so stressed out i'm going through
[10:53] such battles or such torment lord hide
[10:56] me give me a place of rest put me in a
[10:58] secret place where i can rest with you
[11:00] praise god
[11:01] we're going to have those times you know
[11:03] no doubt but overall the bible says we
[11:05] are in a warfare
[11:07] and paul
[11:08] was charging timothy
[11:10] to fight a good warfare amen
[11:13] hallelujah
[11:15] he said when you go to war
[11:16] fight with all you've got amen use every
[11:19] weapon at your disposal amen you gotta
[11:21] say like this use some good military
[11:23] strategy i'm gonna leave a good military
[11:25] strategy
[11:26] we just reached out on joshua i just
[11:28] gave you all that good strategy now of
[11:29] course i don't remember it either i'm
[11:31] sure you don't remember every strategy
[11:32] he used but he did ambushes right
[11:34] he did sometimes where he didn't even
[11:36] pull one sword he just walked around
[11:38] jericho and he just sang he just sang
[11:40] and marched his way and he shouted his
[11:42] way to victory praise god amen
[11:45] so church you're gonna have some warfare
[11:47] praise god but you'll overcome as long
[11:49] as you keep god's word and you follow
[11:51] the holy spirit how he's leading you at
[11:53] this time of your life
[11:56] remember prayers are not answered the
[11:57] same way every time
[11:59] it won't always be uh you're anointed
[12:01] with oil and be healed or it won't
[12:03] always be you know i just need a prayer
[12:05] cloth or something like that it may be
[12:07] you you're in the hospital and god uh
[12:09] slowly heals you in the hospital like we
[12:11] saw brother amen you know or maybe
[12:13] something supernatural god will touch
[12:14] you right here on this earth amen
[12:17] but the thing to do is fight a good
[12:19] warfare amen amen be determined i'm
[12:22] fighting for jesus i'm not going to
[12:23] fight against him i'm fighting for him
[12:25] praise god
[12:28] so he tells timothy you are going to
[12:30] fight a a or a mighty war
[12:33] and he says hold your faith
[12:36] don't drop it
[12:37] hold your faith
[12:39] and hold a good conscience now conscious
[12:41] remember is your moral compass it's
[12:44] that's it's that ability in your human
[12:46] mind conscious memory reason affection
[12:48] imagination is that channel in your mind
[12:50] that knows right from wrong and
[12:52] everybody's got one
[12:54] so he says hold faith
[12:56] and keep a good conscience
[12:59] so when we sin and we don't confess it
[13:01] we've got an evil conscience
[13:03] right our conscience are because i like
[13:05] this a guilty conscience
[13:09] but when we
[13:10] hold the faith and we confess our sins
[13:12] every day we are we're doing what paul
[13:14] told us
[13:15] we're holding the faith we have a good
[13:17] conscience i'm walking the right path
[13:19] i'm living the right way god is pleased
[13:21] with my lifestyle amen i'm walking the
[13:24] ways of holiness i'm walking on the
[13:26] highway of holiness praise god
[13:29] i'm walking on the king's highway amen
[13:32] all glory
[13:34] but paul said to tell timothy
[13:36] some
[13:38] have put away the holding the faith
[13:40] they don't want the burden of holding
[13:42] the faith anymore
[13:44] and they they they put away the the the
[13:47] good conscience
[13:49] in other words they get used to living
[13:52] in a state of guilt
[13:54] well i've already done this anyway i
[13:56] might as well keep going in it
[13:58] right well i know i know i know the
[14:00] church doesn't believe this but i'll
[14:02] just do it anyway i'm so far gone and
[14:04] ain't gonna make a difference anyway
[14:06] or some other excuse
[14:08] but paul tells timothy the church age
[14:11] messenger prophet tells the next
[14:13] generation
[14:15] right that he's gonna fight the good
[14:17] fight of faith
[14:18] and he must hold his faith and he must
[14:21] keep a good conscience he must know i'm
[14:24] living morally i'm keeping god's word
[14:26] god's word is the delight amen god's
[14:29] word is honey in my mouth amen
[14:31] i love to meditate on the word of god
[14:33] amen
[14:36] but some he tells timothy some have made
[14:39] shipwreck
[14:42] think about that they're shipped we've
[14:44] all seen boats right
[14:46] you know if you a few weeks ago we were
[14:47] watching somebody on the paddle boat at
[14:49] silver lake creek you know
[14:50] and they just almost fell like so many
[14:52] times i'm like well they're going to go
[14:53] shipwreck if they're not careful
[14:55] they're standing up on the look like a
[14:57] kayak you know i don't forget what it's
[14:59] called you guys know what it's called
[15:01] down on the knee and reestablish
[15:04] your balance
[15:05] get balance in the word of god amen
[15:08] find your balance in the scripture
[15:10] brother
[15:11] that's what brother brother perry green
[15:12] always was told by brother branham keep
[15:14] your balance in the scripture that's
[15:16] right
[15:17] don't be shipwrecked
[15:21] church we're on a journey
[15:23] we are sailing like solomon's
[15:27] hallelujah
[15:28] we are on a journey our ships we have
[15:30] individual ships
[15:32] right
[15:35] and the example he gives of a ship that
[15:37] is shipwrecked
[15:39] is hymenus and alexander who were blast
[15:42] streaming and had not learned not to
[15:44] blaspheme now this is a mysterious text
[15:47] because later we hear about them
[15:49] they were in the book of timothy ii
[15:50] timothy they were saying
[15:52] uh
[15:54] uh i'm sorry i mean this hymenous and
[15:56] felidas so hymenus was one of the ones
[15:58] later saying the rapture has already
[15:59] happened the resurrection's already
[16:01] passed
[16:02] and it caused a canker in the church it
[16:05] caused a diseased church which would be
[16:07] sin right puffed up in the church
[16:09] lead and up in the church because
[16:11] this was well the rapture's already
[16:13] happened so might as well live like this
[16:15] i lived like that i lived like that
[16:16] that's why jesus keeps it a secret he
[16:18] wants every generation to live like
[16:20] jesus come in this generation
[16:23] it's good to live like he's coming to
[16:24] this generation
[16:26] but we've got to do both we got to live
[16:27] like we're going to live in our flesh
[16:29] like we're going to be here our whole
[16:30] lives right we've got to use wisdom like
[16:31] we've been preaching our finances
[16:33] then spiritually we got to be ready to
[16:34] go at any time praise god
[16:37] i think about that often you know
[16:38] sometimes well if i passed away today
[16:40] how would people find my office
[16:42] how would they find my bible would they
[16:44] find my bible open and written on and
[16:46] how how would they find the condition
[16:48] that i lived in and what was my daily
[16:50] life like my daily life was dedicated to
[16:53] christ amen
[16:55] i want them to find that my life was
[16:57] spiritually being made ready for the
[16:59] coming of the lord
[17:00] [Applause]
[17:01] and i had all my natural things taken
[17:02] care of but my main objective was the
[17:04] spiritual things of god man
[17:09] now this is striking here because uh
[17:12] paul was hoping they would learn not to
[17:14] blaspheme because remember paul blasting
[17:16] but that's before he met the pillar of
[17:18] fire yeah
[17:19] so this is strange i don't know if they
[17:21] can be forgiven or not it's just one of
[17:23] those strange scriptures okay but then
[17:25] of course we find out later hymanius may
[17:27] not have learned it because he was
[17:28] saying the rapture's already happened
[17:30] right there's a lot of message churches
[17:32] that say that uh since that cloud has
[17:34] been taking a picture of in 1963 a lot
[17:36] of them are something out a lot but some
[17:38] message churches believe that jesus is
[17:40] already here the rapture has already
[17:42] happened
[17:43] because the clouds come
[17:44] down well they just got revelation 10
[17:47] confused with first thessalonians 4.
[17:49] amen
[17:50] they got it confused praise god
[17:53] the mighty angel just came down but
[17:55] there was still a ministry for the
[17:56] seventh angel amen
[17:59] and there was a ministry for john to eat
[18:01] the book and prophesy again to every
[18:03] nation people's sons kindred and drive
[18:06] they're still ministering to the
[18:07] gentiles amen
[18:10] meaning time was not no more there was
[18:12] still time there was still hope the
[18:14] gentiles still had a chance of salvation
[18:17] there's still ships out of the sea that
[18:19] can make the destination amen
[18:22] hallelujah and we can still rescue souls
[18:24] amen
[18:25] we can still rescue souls and help them
[18:28] reach god's destination of eternal life
[18:30] amen amen
[18:32] glory amen
[18:33] so i was not going to freestyle okay try
[18:35] not to great now practice
[18:38] faith does not make it to his
[18:40] destination
[18:42] so we get the picture of someone who set
[18:44] sail
[18:45] or sets off but doesn't make it they
[18:48] drop
[18:49] then the bible say that rich men will
[18:51] drown in their sorrows
[18:53] that's why the bible said if you're a
[18:54] rich christian you better be rich in
[18:56] good deeds right
[18:57] like we like we're preaching on that we
[18:59] want to do that if god if it's god's
[19:01] will for our life if it's god's calling
[19:03] for our life but then we must be very
[19:05] careful to constantly give
[19:07] hallelujah
[19:09] now
[19:10] shipwrecked faith blasting the truth by
[19:14] going against your conscience that's
[19:15] what the bible says here
[19:17] imanius and alexander they went against
[19:20] their conscience the conscience was
[19:21] saying don't say that about god don't
[19:23] speak that against god don't speak that
[19:24] against god's servants don't speak that
[19:26] against god's people but yet they did it
[19:28] anyway
[19:29] and paul said because of that they're
[19:31] likely shipwrecked
[19:33] [Music]
[19:34] they're not making i don't think about
[19:36] that sure think about that they stop
[19:37] making progress with god
[19:40] they're drowning
[19:42] in the things in the the battles of the
[19:44] world they're not fighting anymore oh
[19:46] god help us amen
[19:48] they stopped fighting they stopped
[19:50] sailing they weren't making progress god
[19:52] help us to make progress amen
[19:55] in other words each service should be
[19:56] just as important for you to make
[19:58] progress with god amen
[20:01] that's one of the saddest things brother
[20:02] we've seen over years people come in and
[20:04] pretty soon i always see when we get new
[20:06] people always here their faces light up
[20:09] and they love the preaching and then
[20:10] give it six usually three to six months
[20:13] right three i've i've charged you
[20:15] brother william
[20:16] i got charts on my on my computer this
[20:18] person lasted six months before they
[20:20] started criticizing me this one lasted a
[20:22] year this was year and a half you know i
[20:23] just kind of want to get an idea how
[20:24] long will they enjoy the word of god
[20:28] until they start rebuking me or
[20:30] uh just go get attention to other things
[20:32] of the world how long can their ship
[20:34] sail before our trial comes
[20:36] before they'll let it get sunk
[20:38] right because they don't have to let it
[20:40] get son you don't have to be shipwrecked
[20:42] paul was telling timothy you don't have
[20:44] to be shipwrecked
[20:45] hold the face keep a good conscience
[20:48] you'll reach your destination you'll
[20:49] fight it goodbye praise god
[20:56] so see their conscience at one point
[20:57] said don't do this don't say that don't
[20:59] criticize there
[21:00] don't attack that but yet they do anyway
[21:03] they go past their conscience and they
[21:05] do the evil even though they're
[21:07] conscious says do right
[21:09] that's why church is so important to
[21:11] confess all your sins the bible says
[21:13] confess all your sins right and then
[21:16] jesus will
[21:17] forgive all your sins cleanse you from
[21:19] all righteousness
[21:21] praise god
[21:24] how many want to reach our destination
[21:25] today
[21:26] that's only one out of 13. i think i got
[21:28] more on that too because remember jesus
[21:30] said
[21:31] jesus said uh getting to the ground here
[21:33] again this is the second kind of ground
[21:35] the wayside was the first the stone he
[21:37] said on the rock or they which they hear
[21:40] they receive the word rejoice so look
[21:42] there
[21:43] when they're when their vote uh leaves
[21:45] and sets sail they have in parties
[21:48] they're shouting right
[21:49] they're praising the lord when their
[21:51] their ship set sail
[21:53] street's a destination but after a while
[21:55] they get offended
[21:57] and they fall away in the time of
[21:58] temptation
[22:01] that's why i want to have joy when i
[22:03] start i want to have joy in the middle
[22:05] and i would have joy at the end
[22:08] i want the fruit of joy it's the fruit
[22:10] of the spirit in other words if the
[22:11] spirit of god is in your soul it will
[22:13] produce a
[22:15] joy peace patience faithfulness goodness
[22:17] separates all these fruits until the
[22:20] people the people of god can enjoy the
[22:22] fruits of god that come out of my life
[22:23] amen amen in your life too praise god
[22:27] everybody here who is born again
[22:30] remember there's fruits before you're
[22:31] born again too
[22:32] john the baptist said bring forth fruits
[22:34] worthy repentance
[22:37] so people can enjoy all your fruits
[22:39] praise god whether you're born again or
[22:40] not
[22:42] but all of us that are born again will
[22:43] have the fruits of the spirit and we
[22:45] ought to enjoy the fruits in our lives
[22:47] in other words
[22:48] brother amen ought to have a lot of long
[22:50] suffering with me
[22:52] right
[22:53] and my joy ought to lift him up if he's
[22:55] down
[22:56] or my love for brother austin he ought
[22:58] to feel my love when he don't feel loved
[22:59] by or when things are going hard he
[23:02] ought to be able to feel my love for him
[23:03] praise god right we ought to be able to
[23:05] help one another praise god
[23:08] see they believe for a while they could
[23:10] sail for a while
[23:14] see but then everything falls apart they
[23:16] fall away
[23:18] they did not reach the destination of
[23:20] christianity
[23:23] now here's the second metaphor it's a
[23:25] war against god can you imagine that god
[23:27] wants us fighting on him but some people
[23:29] actually take the opposite side and they
[23:31] actually fight against god
[23:34] when they blast you
[23:36] right when they when their god is their
[23:37] own belly we looked at that in the book
[23:39] of philippians
[23:40] but here well here's what uh uh gamalia
[23:43] actually remember brother and said give
[23:44] him perhaps commander will be saved
[23:46] because of this right here he set up for
[23:48] god's people in a time of persecution
[23:51] that's he said perhaps if we say perhaps
[23:54] perhaps
[23:55] perhaps
[23:56] and now i'm saying to you jews refrain
[23:58] from these men these christians and let
[24:00] them alone for if this council or this
[24:03] work be a man it will come to naught
[24:05] but if it be of god you cannot overthrow
[24:08] it amen look at that two thousand years
[24:10] ago they tried but they couldn't
[24:11] overthrow christianity here we are two
[24:13] thousand years later it cannot be
[24:15] overthrown it's a kingdom that cannot be
[24:18] moved it's not an outside kingdom with
[24:20] buildings it's the kingdom of god that's
[24:22] within you amen oh
[24:24] and when god puts that kingdom in the
[24:26] heart that it will spread to others
[24:28] praise god life will throw flow through
[24:30] the body it'll flow from one believer to
[24:31] the next lever to the next flavor it
[24:33] cannot be moved it's an invincible army
[24:36] amen
[24:39] you can't overthrow this holy ghost
[24:40] gospel amen amen impossible praise god
[24:44] you cannot sing all these shits holy
[24:46] spirit and
[24:48] they might think so but they won't sing
[24:50] fired amen
[24:51] they won't see yours amen why because
[24:53] i'm going to get to it a little faster
[24:55] because somebody else is in my ship upon
[24:57] me it's christmas
[24:59] [Applause]
[25:06] it's not about me i'm not the one that's
[25:08] really keeping my ship floating it's
[25:09] christ amen
[25:12] i invited him into my shivering man and
[25:14] if he's in the ship he'll step on the
[25:16] ship and say peace be still you are
[25:18] reaching your destination christ is in
[25:21] the shipping
[25:21] [Applause]
[25:23] hallelujah
[25:25] thank god
[25:28] see don't don't start a war
[25:31] against god and christianity that's
[25:33] right the message of the hour don't
[25:34] start a war and i see that people get
[25:36] careful you better be careful here they
[25:38] get on dangerous grounds
[25:41] now here's where we actually struggle
[25:44] all of us
[25:45] we have a war within ourselves
[25:48] but we can't we got to keep fighting the
[25:50] war within ourselves and we can't just
[25:52] give over to that war and then fight
[25:54] against god you understand you have a
[25:57] war within you you've got to win
[25:59] but you don't want to ever turn and
[26:01] fight against god that's true
[26:04] dearly beloved i must teach you as
[26:05] strangers and pilgrims abstain from i'm
[26:07] sorry
[26:08] fleshly lusts which war against the soul
[26:10] when a person man or woman starts giving
[26:13] in to fleshy lust they will
[26:14] automatically be in war against god
[26:17] and if they're born again the god that's
[26:19] inside of them
[26:21] so in part of their minds they'll be
[26:22] like i'm not saved and another part i am
[26:25] safe
[26:26] i'm bored again
[26:28] right
[26:29] well see that's why we've got to get
[26:31] temperance amen temperance controls the
[26:33] bodily passions amen
[26:36] that's why all these message preachers
[26:38] fall away maybe they had it at one time
[26:41] but then they give in
[26:43] and they lose that anointing because
[26:44] they never got born again
[26:47] they don't have self-control and now
[26:48] they'll drink wine more publicly now
[26:50] they'll drink alcohol
[26:52] and now they'll uh uh they'll divorce
[26:55] and remarry you know get another wife or
[26:57] you know whatever wicked now they're
[26:59] listening to rock and roll they can't
[27:00] even control that fleshly passing
[27:02] passion rock and roll or rat
[27:03] right they put it on they even put it on
[27:05] facebook i could show you them i took
[27:07] pictures of them
[27:08] i don't know on facebook anymore but
[27:10] see
[27:11] it starts to war within them
[27:15] and are they going to fight or win that
[27:17] war well that's up to them
[27:21] so yeah it's a it's a personal i like
[27:23] that it's a personal civil war now
[27:24] church part of us we always have this
[27:26] civil war within ourselves right
[27:28] we think it's so awful the civil war it
[27:29] was awful but the good guys will praise
[27:31] god
[27:32] the right the right way one in our
[27:34] american civil war
[27:36] but paul says you have the civil war
[27:38] going in on you right now
[27:40] i see another law of my members warring
[27:42] against the law of my mind and bringing
[27:44] me into captivity to the law of sin
[27:46] which is in my members
[27:49] so you're in a ship right that's one
[27:50] metaphor you're on but you even have a
[27:53] war inside the ship
[27:55] you're constantly in a war in the ship
[27:57] between your flesh
[27:59] and jesus in your soul
[28:03] ah amen
[28:05] but paul says o wretched man that i am
[28:07] who will deliver me from the body of
[28:08] this death i thank god through jesus
[28:10] christ our lord so then with my mind
[28:12] everybody say my mind
[28:14] with my mind i serve the longer but with
[28:17] the flesh and loss and see why you got
[28:18] to get your mind in the things of god
[28:20] every single day
[28:22] every morning if we don't get our minds
[28:24] right away in the things of god it may
[28:26] start a war
[28:29] that whole day
[28:30] why am i struggling with why am i
[28:32] battling this why how did this come back
[28:33] again did you get your mind right in the
[28:35] morning
[28:36] because the mind getting your mind right
[28:39] with god is what will help you keep the
[28:41] war and getting the victory over the war
[28:43] of your flesh that's right
[28:50] here paul says a preacher he calls them
[28:53] and this in this passage he's speaking
[28:54] to preachers how they how they operate
[28:56] in the new testament paul says or i only
[28:59] a barnabas have we not power to forbear
[29:01] workings he don't preachers have the
[29:03] power or the the
[29:05] authority they don't have to go to work
[29:07] they can just preach they can be a
[29:08] full-time preacher yes of course
[29:11] who goes to a warfare at any time at his
[29:13] own charges
[29:15] so it's warfare preaching is warfare and
[29:18] the church said
[29:19] boy sure is i've never done it over the
[29:20] years i tried to have a smile throughout
[29:22] throughout it right all the battles
[29:25] as paul said battles within and battles
[29:27] without it right
[29:28] we all experience this we're in a
[29:30] warfare
[29:33] as paul said you got uh battles amongst
[29:36] the jews battle against uh the robbers
[29:39] no in other words everywhere we go we're
[29:40] fighting battles
[29:46] you remember this second verse 10
[29:47] beautiful scripture we walk in the flesh
[29:49] but we do not war after the flesh so
[29:51] it's not like a gun or sword or nunchuck
[29:55] that's not the weapons we need praise
[29:57] god
[29:58] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[30:00] carnal but mighty through god to the
[30:03] pulling down of strongholds
[30:06] so god's word and this war will hold on
[30:08] any stronghold any wall can be broken
[30:11] through praise god
[30:13] any fortress can be overthrown can be
[30:16] ransacked amen and we can have spoils of
[30:18] victory because we've got better weapons
[30:21] than satan amen
[30:22] we've got the word of god hallelujah
[30:26] what should we do we must cast down
[30:28] imaginations
[30:29] that's right
[30:31] anything that exalts itself against the
[30:33] knowledge of god
[30:35] and they're going to church bring into a
[30:36] captivity every what thought the thought
[30:39] life the human spirit your thoughts you
[30:41] must have control i must have control we
[30:44] must have control of all of our thoughts
[30:46] amen
[30:49] and then take revenge on the devil
[30:52] if you fail to sin one day take revenge
[30:54] and say i'm not falling this day i'm
[30:56] going to obey god's word today
[30:59] right got to have revenge
[31:01] got to have that i'm not going to fall
[31:02] this time i'm going to get the victory
[31:04] i'm in a battle praise god i'm not going
[31:06] to let him cut me with a sword i'm going
[31:07] to cut him amen
[31:09] hallelujah
[31:13] paul says again timothy endure hardness
[31:16] as a sole good soldier of jesus christ
[31:18] so we have to expect of course we see it
[31:20] we have to expect in public and even
[31:22] amongst other churches denominations we
[31:24] have to expect that they're going to be
[31:26] hard toward the gospel of jesus christ
[31:29] but paul says endure it
[31:31] just get through how many can just get
[31:33] through it
[31:34] just endure just live with it how do you
[31:35] can just live with it
[31:37] we're learning that we just got to live
[31:39] with the hardness of the world we got to
[31:41] live with the hardness of the churches
[31:42] we can't give into that we can't let
[31:44] that discourage us they're going to be
[31:46] hard but we can be salty we can be soft
[31:49] we can be fleshly as far as fleshy
[31:51] tables of the heart we can be loving we
[31:53] can be gentle as doves heartless as
[31:56] servants we can be the servants of god
[31:59] amen
[32:00] see no man who wars
[32:03] entangles himself with the affairs of
[32:04] this life
[32:07] that he may please him who have chosen
[32:09] to be a soldier so one time i had a boy
[32:12] in my class named what writer was his
[32:13] name and his dad come back from ir uh
[32:16] afghanistan
[32:17] i said uh
[32:19] his wife's name was jessica i can't
[32:20] remember his name
[32:22] i said hey how often did you get to see
[32:24] ryder he's like he's like once a month
[32:26] we could do a video chat
[32:28] right you imagine that you've got a wife
[32:30] and kids but he was a soldier in
[32:32] afghanistan he had to work out there i
[32:33] forget if he was a truck driver i can't
[32:35] remember exactly what he was working
[32:36] there of afghanistan
[32:38] but once a month because of security
[32:40] reasons he get to go on the on the on
[32:42] the ipad and say there's my son there's
[32:44] ryan how you doing buddy
[32:46] i miss you
[32:48] once a month imagine you got to see your
[32:49] kids once a month
[32:51] that'd be awful
[32:53] but that's what a solid duration a
[32:54] soldier separates everything
[32:57] right his heart his heart can't be moved
[32:59] by other things other than the purpose
[33:01] of the war
[33:02] he's focused on his mission
[33:05] right and so that's what paul says you
[33:07] can't be entangled with things that are
[33:09] not a part of the war
[33:11] you've got to be focused on the things
[33:12] of god you got to remain free from any
[33:15] worldly thing praise god and you're
[33:16] going to be totally devoted completely
[33:18] focused on winning this war praise god
[33:24] because god chose you to be in this army
[33:26] amen
[33:28] now in the military they signed up but
[33:30] really god chose us before the
[33:31] foundation of the world
[33:32] hallelujah he told that yes we had to
[33:35] surrender but he knew we were going to
[33:36] threaten the whole thing right
[33:38] other than going on the other side of
[33:40] sovereignty right those are the
[33:41] predestinations now god poor knew you so
[33:44] he cannot he could never lose you praise
[33:46] god he knew you choose to praise god
[33:50] see and the only way you'll overcome the
[33:52] only way you get a crown church is if
[33:54] you follow the laws
[33:56] of the warfare
[33:58] let's keep the all the commands keep
[34:00] your commission every all the details of
[34:02] your mission you've got to complete it
[34:04] and then you get a crowd
[34:06] then you come home and everybody's going
[34:07] to clap for you and they're going to
[34:08] have a they're going to have all members
[34:10] going to salute you bray scott and all
[34:12] you imagine the salute in heaven we're
[34:13] going to get
[34:14] all the other ones have come through it
[34:16] but it's our turn we'll say thank you
[34:17] lord hallelujah and they'll salute us
[34:19] like soldiers coming in we come back our
[34:21] ship made it through we won the war he
[34:24] was with us we fought a good fight we
[34:26] finished the course amen
[34:28] just like all the other ones
[34:31] we're no different no better but we all
[34:33] overcame by the grace of god amen why
[34:36] because we didn't get entangled in the
[34:38] things of this world
[34:42] right the main one for us as i said was
[34:43] riches
[34:44] getting entangled in riches
[34:47] right or lust of the flesh less to the
[34:49] eyes
[34:51] pride of life
[34:54] see there's a lot on this how many more
[34:55] i got in this room i got two more okay
[34:58] uh
[34:59] james says where do wars come among you
[35:01] see so first they they war star in you
[35:03] but then if people don't if people don't
[35:05] overcome those wars in their minds or
[35:06] their bodies then they're going to take
[35:08] that war out to other church members
[35:11] that's why i want to be a church full of
[35:12] god's peace
[35:13] full of love
[35:15] let's confess our problems one to
[35:17] another and let's remain in god's love
[35:19] praise god
[35:22] paul says i'm now ready to be offered as
[35:24] a sacrifice martyr the time of my
[35:27] departure is at hand i fought a good
[35:29] fight i finished my course i have kept
[35:31] the faith henceforth there is laid up
[35:33] for me a crown of righteousness which
[35:35] the lord the righteous judge shall give
[35:36] me of that day and not to me only but
[35:39] all them also that love is appearing
[35:42] oh i'm looking forward to the rapture
[35:43] praise god
[35:45] we love that he's appearing
[35:47] we're uh yeah we have godly fear you
[35:49] know we have godly fear he's going to
[35:51] come back we know that but we also at
[35:53] the same time we love it we always have
[35:54] the fear of the lord but we also have
[35:56] love we we know he's going to make us a
[35:58] part of it because he's already saved us
[36:00] you've already satisfied us he's already
[36:02] filled us with the holy ghost he's going
[36:03] to finish what he started and we love
[36:05] him so we'll see him in love
[36:08] oh my
[36:10] number three metaphor is the falling
[36:11] away this is
[36:13] um the most often one used i think
[36:17] so we'd say
[36:18] one who falls away is a deserter they
[36:21] deserve the army
[36:23] that's what my dad did in the marines
[36:24] and he went to jail for a while my dad
[36:26] left the marines
[36:27] the marine the marine instructor made
[36:29] him get down like a dog and bark in
[36:31] front of the people and they embarrassed
[36:32] him uh they made fun of his name snooki
[36:35] so my dad went awol well they caught him
[36:38] and took him to jail
[36:39] and so he's discharged dishonorably but
[36:42] see that's that's the battles that he
[36:43] was facing at that time you know
[36:45] um
[36:46] but he's a deserver
[36:49] uh also the other word in the greek is
[36:51] apostasy or apostate so you hear that
[36:53] the apostasy report there's different
[36:54] you know youtube channels the apostasy
[36:56] report it's those that are falling away
[36:58] the judas groups
[37:00] or another word is run away
[37:03] okay so paul says let no man deceive you
[37:05] for that day
[37:07] shall not come except there come a
[37:08] falling away first that this the man of
[37:10] sin be revealed the son of perdition
[37:13] okay so this is speaking of course the
[37:15] antichrist is the son of perdition he's
[37:17] the modern day judas iscariot
[37:20] okay so the example was like judas uh
[37:22] there's got to become a falling away
[37:23] first there has to be a great deflection
[37:26] uh there's have to be people that
[37:28] deserve the faith praise god
[37:30] deserve the gospel
[37:33] john says it as well in our church this
[37:34] how they encourage you here by god's
[37:36] grace he says there's many antichrists
[37:38] that's how we know it's the last time
[37:40] they went out from us because they were
[37:41] not of us
[37:42] for if they had been of us they no doubt
[37:44] would have continued with us but they
[37:46] went out that they might be made
[37:48] manifest that they were not all of us
[37:51] but you have an unction that means
[37:52] anointing you have an anointing from the
[37:54] holy one and you know all things amen so
[37:57] this judas is scared group they don't
[37:59] have the same anointing to god even
[38:01] that's why they can't worship like you
[38:02] worship amen that's why they can't
[38:04] rejoice like you rejoice amen they know
[38:06] they they turned down the unction from
[38:08] the holy one praise god and they don't
[38:10] know all things we know all things that
[38:13] are needed for the rapture we know all
[38:15] things that pertain unto life and
[38:17] godliness
[38:19] oh hallelujah
[38:21] so one proof that we're not antichrist
[38:23] is that we stay in the right church
[38:25] that's why i always preach on church
[38:27] attendance that's why i preach on
[38:28] getting up early studying the bible get
[38:30] your mind right because you're going to
[38:32] be fighting a war every single day
[38:34] amen
[38:34] and one proof that you are god's army is
[38:37] that you stay with god's people amen you
[38:39] don't deserve god's people
[38:43] we see it again here
[38:45] first of all when you come together in
[38:46] the church i hear that there be
[38:48] divisions among you and i partly believe
[38:50] it so remember the corinthian church was
[38:51] divided
[38:52] with gifts and they were just all over
[38:53] the place with gifts some like apollos
[38:56] peter's ministry jesus some said i'm
[38:57] just jesus some like paul they were
[38:59] divided all over the place
[39:03] he said uh remember there's a group also
[39:05] that they didn't even mourn over the uh
[39:07] the young man sleeping with his
[39:08] stepmother
[39:09] they didn't even mourn about that
[39:11] all these
[39:12] divisions
[39:14] and what would fix it a prophet writing
[39:16] a letter
[39:18] a prophet writing a letter amen two
[39:20] letters amen two and just reading lord
[39:23] just reading the written word and that
[39:25] written word becoming the spoken word it
[39:28] went out like a sword rightly dividing
[39:30] the word of truth amen it was sharper
[39:32] than another sword that's the mighty
[39:34] weapon and it brought the church back
[39:36] into the line amen amen just the word of
[39:38] god just read the word of god amen
[39:41] brought the church right back in line
[39:42] praise god
[39:44] hallelujah amen that's why reading the
[39:46] word of god is so powerful
[39:48] we've all been there right we've been
[39:50] discouraged or
[39:51] uh
[39:52] tempted whatever all it takes is a song
[39:54] also takes a scripture oh hallelujah i'm
[39:56] better now by god's grace forgive me
[39:58] lord
[39:59] all it takes
[40:01] is the spoken word of jesus christ
[40:05] now there must be heresies remember
[40:07] heresies are man-made tenets or man-made
[40:10] commands that's what intent that's what
[40:12] heresy is
[40:13] it's a man-made dogma or doctrine or
[40:15] creed
[40:16] there must be man-made doctrines among
[40:18] you that they which are approved may be
[40:21] made manifest among you so that's the
[40:23] reason there's all these arguments about
[40:25] doctrine in all the churches that's
[40:26] normal because the true doctrine will
[40:28] show who's the true church and the false
[40:30] doctrine will show who's the false
[40:31] that's right that's true
[40:34] and then those of the true church
[40:35] they'll hang together with the true
[40:36] doctrine
[40:39] they won't fall away
[40:41] the spirit said in the latter times some
[40:43] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[40:45] and seducing spirits and doctrines of
[40:47] devils
[40:49] they speak lies in hypocrisy having
[40:51] their theirs that conscious again
[40:53] conscience here with the hot iron they
[40:54] took out iron and put it on their
[40:56] conscience what kind of mark would that
[40:57] be
[40:58] right we saw that we saw the man in
[41:00] slavery who had all the sears on his
[41:02] back the branding's on his back
[41:05] and paul says this is happening
[41:06] spiritually someone's putting an iron on
[41:08] your conscience you can't even feel
[41:10] right and wrong anymore
[41:12] it's numb right it's all numbed out
[41:16] service after service no more conscience
[41:18] no more good and wrong they can't even
[41:19] discern good wrong
[41:21] they've departed from the faith
[41:23] they gave ye they let the seducing
[41:25] spirits burn their conscience with an
[41:27] iron
[41:28] flatten out that conscience right
[41:30] flatten it out
[41:32] don't feel it anymore don't feel the
[41:34] effects of sin anymore god help us to
[41:36] always feel bad when we sin
[41:39] now our conscience will be so tender
[41:41] our conscience will be
[41:43] so sensitive
[41:45] not seared over like oh i can keep doing
[41:47] this or it's okay for me to do this
[41:49] is that okay
[41:52] they specifically said you can't marry
[41:54] they said don't eat meats on friday or
[41:55] whatever they was
[41:57] whatever it was
[41:59] and notice their conscience is mentioned
[42:00] again these that fall away
[42:03] just like in remember timothy said uh
[42:06] they put away their good conscience so
[42:08] now i'm connecting first timothy four
[42:10] and first timothy one
[42:12] they branded or seared their conscience
[42:15] and they couldn't
[42:16] discern evil and bad anymore evil good
[42:19] anymore they couldn't descend
[42:21] well no you should er you shouldn't you
[42:23] shouldn't marry you don't have to marry
[42:26] and no you don't eat meat on saturday or
[42:28] don't eat meat on friday you know just
[42:30] seared over
[42:31] thinking that that made them righteous
[42:33] when it didn't make them righteous
[42:34] that's right
[42:36] ii timothy 4 paul says
[42:39] look at this example of demons i
[42:40] remember demons from the bible
[42:42] paul said this is the last letter before
[42:44] he was martyred
[42:46] due diligence to come to me shortly for
[42:48] demeth has forsaken me having loved this
[42:51] present world and departed unto
[42:53] thessalonica went to thessalonica for
[42:56] the things of the world brother william
[42:58] but remember there's messy church in
[43:00] this vessel that's the night that's why
[43:02] he wrote the letters
[43:04] but there was something other than
[43:05] message churches in thessalonica drawing
[43:08] him to the city
[43:11] and so he left paul saying oh i don't i
[43:12] can't live this life anymore
[43:14] i want to go enjoy the world
[43:16] i want to make some money or i want some
[43:18] women or i want some food or you know
[43:20] whatever whatever
[43:21] the temptation was
[43:26] paul so dennis forsook or abandoned or
[43:29] deserted paul's in prison
[43:32] and don't you you don't come to visit
[43:34] anymore
[43:36] you don't come to check on the prophet
[43:37] anymore in prison
[43:39] forsook the prophet
[43:42] so just like judas
[43:44] demas had to hide his love for the world
[43:47] for a while he could hide it
[43:50] but finally that love for the world
[43:53] i manifested
[43:53] church he had all his opportunities to
[43:55] the prop like like i said with judas he
[43:57] had all those opportunities he could
[43:59] have went up to jesus said jesus can you
[44:01] forgive me i've got this i've got a
[44:02] thief heart can you i'm repenting my
[44:04] feet heart can you forgive me
[44:06] he could have done that but he didn't
[44:09] same thing with demons he could have
[44:10] went up and said paul you're the prophet
[44:11] of god
[44:12] you've written the word of god you have
[44:14] not said the lord will you pray for me
[44:16] that i won't love the things of the
[44:17] world and he never did that
[44:18] you see why church is so important
[44:20] sometimes just confess your sin to
[44:21] somebody you don't think that confess it
[44:22] to me but just confess it to god amen
[44:25] that's what this altar is for amen you
[44:28] don't have to tell me but this is what
[44:30] it's for tell god amen
[44:33] that's what judas didn't do he didn't
[44:34] come here he didn't lay here and say god
[44:37] forgive me i'm confessing it to you it
[44:39] doesn't matter if anybody else knows but
[44:41] christ has to know praise god
[44:43] he's going to find out anyway
[44:46] you're going to find out
[44:48] eventually demons had all those
[44:50] opportunities to talk to the prophet
[44:53] he could have said can you give me a
[44:54] vision
[44:55] can you see if the lord gives you a
[44:56] vision for me i can overcome the love of
[44:58] the world
[45:00] same thing jesus could have said jesus
[45:02] did the father show you anything about
[45:04] how to overcome a bee's heart
[45:06] i'm really coveting after money and i
[45:08] don't i'm holding the bag here and i'm
[45:09] having trouble not taking money out of
[45:11] the bag
[45:12] why didn't you go to jesus
[45:14] said lord forgive me or you know i'm
[45:16] going to surrender this i don't have to
[45:17] be the trustee i'm sorry
[45:19] i have to be the treasurer that's right
[45:22] i i i have to be the treasurer
[45:25] can we let peter be the treasurer he had
[45:27] the keys to the kingdom
[45:30] maybe he could handle both i don't have
[45:32] to be the treasurer
[45:35] see that's what he would have done if he
[45:37] was if he was really humble
[45:40] he would have said listen i'm having
[45:41] trouble with this area of my life that's
[45:43] why you have trouble with your
[45:44] smartphone get rid of your smartphone
[45:46] right go back to the flip phone i know
[45:48] numerous brothers that have done that
[45:50] they can't handle a smartphone because
[45:51] the temptation the lust so they just
[45:53] have a flip phone
[45:54] right i got a teenage friend right now i
[45:56] was texting
[45:58] his phone is set up he has a smartphone
[46:00] but it's set up or you can't even
[46:01] receive pictures on it
[46:02] so to get some pictures ahead of him
[46:05] like when we were younger i had to send
[46:06] it to his dad and then get taken to him
[46:09] so church if there's a will to live holy
[46:11] there's a way to live holy amen
[46:14] hallelujah there's a way for demons we
[46:16] turn him down there's a way for judas to
[46:18] turn him down there's a way for us
[46:20] praise god but we're not going to turn
[46:21] it down amen
[46:23] we're going to receive god's wisdom
[46:24] we're going to
[46:25] we're going to sail on lifestyle again
[46:27] and we're going to reach our destination
[46:29] amen
[46:30] hallelujah amen
[46:37] now look earlier church
[46:38] demons was a fellow worker look at this
[46:40] and philemon he was the slave owner of
[46:43] onesimus that paul said
[46:45] or nesmus left philemon and he got saved
[46:48] under paul's ministry and paul saying
[46:50] all the money that you lost put it on my
[46:52] account
[46:55] but while he was working with philemon
[46:57] look who was a faithful worker demas was
[47:00] a faithful fellow labor in the gospel
[47:04] he was a companion in work see church
[47:06] judas and demas they can hide it for so
[47:09] long but pretty soon they're going to
[47:10] love the world
[47:12] judas lasted three and a half years
[47:14] i don't know how long the demons lasted
[47:17] thank god i'm beyond three and a half
[47:18] years thank god for that
[47:19] i'm not saying that's the mark but
[47:21] you know i say right around 2000 so 20
[47:24] almost 23 years now god's great i'm
[47:26] still pressing on towards the mark of
[47:27] the high cost
[47:28] i'm not satisfied if i walk with god i
[47:31] want more of god amen
[47:33] i need more of god
[47:35] that's the reason why i want more of god
[47:36] because i need more of god because i'm a
[47:38] wretched man there's a war in my memory
[47:40] but thanks be to god that we can rejoice
[47:43] in the law of god in our mind and we can
[47:45] bring this body into subjection to the
[47:47] holy spirit praise god
[47:49] amen
[47:50] i'm going to keep laboring for jesus
[47:55] eventually the world
[47:57] was more loved by demas
[48:00] than the revealed word of the hour
[48:03] can you imagine that those those letters
[48:05] paul was writing they were fresh off the
[48:07] presses kind of like they were fresh off
[48:09] the heavenly presses
[48:11] paul was getting fresh revelation right
[48:13] timothy colossians philippians believe
[48:15] it he's getting fresh revelation and the
[48:17] fresh word of god no longer interested
[48:19] in demons
[48:21] church if you get to the spot where you
[48:22] don't like listen to brother branham
[48:23] anymore something's wrong with you
[48:25] praise god
[48:26] if you get the spout or you don't like
[48:28] sermons anymore something's wrong with
[48:29] you
[48:31] because this is what happened demas
[48:33] didn't like the reveal word of the hour
[48:35] anymore that's the same thing herodias
[48:36] did
[48:38] right that's the same thing herodias had
[48:40] the messenger the prophet messenger john
[48:42] the baptist had his head cut off in
[48:44] other words he silenced the messenger in
[48:45] his life
[48:46] he silenced the forerunner in his life
[48:49] oh may god help us to enjoy the
[48:51] forerunner hear the forerunner let the
[48:53] 400 keep preaching let your pastor keep
[48:55] reaching let the final ministry keep
[48:57] reaching just fall more loving the word
[48:59] all the time
[49:01] the reveal word of god amen
[49:04] glory
[49:10] what did jesus say what is the reason
[49:12] jesus said people are lost they love
[49:14] darkness more than life what was demons
[49:17] demons love the world more than the
[49:18] revealed word of god
[49:20] it all boils down to love boils down to
[49:22] love rather having a hard time talking
[49:24] okay
[49:24] bear with me
[49:27] so jesus foretold we either love him or
[49:30] love the world
[49:34] this fourth or fifth one i can't keep
[49:35] track anymore i should put numbers on
[49:38] another metaphor is you stumble like if
[49:40] i stumbled down this i would trip on
[49:42] this and i'd fall down all right stumble
[49:44] going up the stairs right how many fall
[49:45] down on the stairs before i mean
[49:46] anybody ever fall down the stairs
[49:48] many times
[49:50] i did the other day i thank god i caught
[49:51] myself i almost did a face plant
[49:53] i was trying to get up there and wash
[49:55] dishes or something
[49:57] i stumbled
[49:58] well stumble is a metaphor of what judas
[50:00] did
[50:03] and that's what the word offended mean
[50:05] here's the second kind of ground on the
[50:06] stony ground jesus says he hears the
[50:08] word he has joy but then he has no root
[50:13] he can hang around for a while
[50:15] but then when tribulation or persecution
[50:17] comes because of the word of god he's
[50:20] offended or he stumbles
[50:22] he stumbles when he's persecuted
[50:27] he's offended at the word of god
[50:30] remember john the baptist battled this
[50:32] when he was in prison how do you know
[50:34] that yeah
[50:35] john said our is jesus the one or should
[50:37] we look for another
[50:40] because jesus said blessed is he
[50:43] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[50:46] so john was battling this and he sent
[50:48] messengers to jesus and jesus said go
[50:51] tell don't tell john
[50:53] the blind received their sight the death
[50:55] the death he received their hearing the
[50:57] dead are raised amen the kingdom of god
[50:59] is preached hallelujah
[51:02] and tell them blessed is he whosoever
[51:05] shall not be offended in me
[51:08] can you imagine how good john felt when
[51:10] the disciples come back
[51:12] and and they said john said what'd you
[51:14] say
[51:15] he's looking up from the prison bars
[51:16] there what did jesus say
[51:19] he said you are the greatest prophet
[51:20] that was ever more can you imagine
[51:23] he'd think of moses he thinking joshua
[51:25] he'd think of
[51:26] adam and you know enoch all these
[51:29] prophets what jesus said is he the
[51:31] messiah yes he is we saw signs wonders
[51:33] and miracles we saw the spirit of god
[51:35] moving and you're the greatest man
[51:37] that's ever been born amen that's right
[51:40] what a way to encourage what a way to
[51:42] keep a man from stumbling amen that's
[51:45] right that's right tell him how much god
[51:46] loves him
[51:49] tell them how many rewards he has in
[51:51] heaven amen that's the way it encourages
[51:53] us to even remember your labor is not in
[51:56] vain in the lord praise god
[51:59] you will reap if you faint not the bible
[52:02] says hallelujah
[52:08] another one is cut off
[52:10] they go a little faster okay these
[52:12] metaphors 13 metaphors
[52:14] another one is jesus will cut off people
[52:17] that's what happened to judas he got cut
[52:18] off
[52:19] from the life of god
[52:21] jesus said i am the vine you're the
[52:22] branches he that abides in me and i in
[52:24] him the same bringing forth much fruit
[52:26] for without me you can do
[52:29] i can do nothing without jesus
[52:31] if a man abides not in me he's cast
[52:34] forth as a branch he needs to throw
[52:37] or let go so a branch the other way you
[52:38] can throw a branch
[52:43] and his wither and men gather them and
[52:46] cast them into the fire and they're
[52:48] burned if you abide in me and my words
[52:50] abide in you ask what ye will and it
[52:52] shall be done unto you what a promise
[52:54] praise god
[52:55] see we must abide in the word of god
[52:59] because without jesus we can do nothing
[53:01] now church we don't want to wither away
[53:03] are you with me yes
[53:05] that's what i'm saying we don't want to
[53:06] see our love for god with our way we
[53:08] want to see our love for god sustained
[53:10] amen
[53:12] stay faithful with god
[53:14] and enjoy the things of god we don't
[53:16] want to see our strength with our way
[53:18] now i'm getting older and i'm starting
[53:19] to see my strength other way a couple
[53:21] years ago i used to be able to jump and
[53:22] hang on the rim well i tried to touch
[53:23] the rim a few weeks ago i can't do it
[53:25] anymore wow my muscles are withered away
[53:28] if i don't use them they're going to
[53:29] wither away
[53:31] right
[53:32] same thing with spiritual are you as
[53:34] strong as you were spiritually a couple
[53:36] years ago
[53:37] or were you withering away
[53:39] the thing to do is if you're if you're
[53:41] getting weaker get stronger go exercise
[53:44] spiritually
[53:45] i think natural exercise is good too but
[53:47] the main thing is spiritual exercise
[53:49] exercise your faith amen
[53:52] hallelujah the church said
[53:54] you got to exercise your faith flex your
[53:57] faith muscles amen
[53:59] list of spiritual ways there's bear the
[54:01] burdens of one another amen amen
[54:04] with your spiritual strength
[54:06] lift the burdens of others off them give
[54:09] them a break with your strong muscle get
[54:11] busy for god you'll see your strength
[54:13] return i promise amen
[54:15] hallelujah
[54:21] another metaphor cast away
[54:24] paul says if a man is striving
[54:28] speaking of athletics here speaking of
[54:30] runners like i was a runner some of you
[54:32] may have been runners
[54:35] if you're striving for the master if
[54:36] you're trying to obtain a goal you must
[54:38] be temperate in all things they do it to
[54:41] obtain a corruptable crown but we an
[54:44] incorruptible crowd
[54:47] i therefore so run how does paul run his
[54:49] christian race there's another metaphor
[54:50] running the race right not as
[54:52] uncertainly so fine i not as one that
[54:55] beats the air but i keep under my body
[54:57] and bring it into subjection lest that
[54:59] by any means when i preach to others i
[55:02] myself should be cast away
[55:05] so he's speaking of a runner
[55:07] and a runner that's castaway is rejected
[55:09] he didn't stand the test
[55:11] simon talks about this sometimes uh he
[55:13] was a cross-country runner in college
[55:16] and he'd be tempted he said some of the
[55:17] runners would cut corners you ever seen
[55:19] that at a cross-country event they got
[55:20] like they spray a path of chalk or
[55:22] whatever they or they spray paint and
[55:24] they gotta pass certain paths you have
[55:25] to run
[55:27] well sometimes you can cut a corner
[55:30] sometimes the path will go around the
[55:31] tree and you can actually cut
[55:33] between the tree and the path you can
[55:35] cut through the field and simon said he
[55:37] was tempted numerous times to do that
[55:39] on the cross country course but if you
[55:41] do that the bible the bible says you get
[55:43] rejected you get canceled at the end
[55:46] and paul said if i try to cut corners
[55:48] i'm going to get canceled at the end how
[55:50] do you how do you not cut corners paul
[55:52] you keep your body under subjection
[55:55] the lust of the flesh the church said
[55:57] amen you've got to control the lust of
[56:00] the flesh
[56:01] that's how we overcome that's how we
[56:03] know when we finish the race the angels
[56:05] be shouting
[56:07] happy they won't be sad that we cut
[56:09] corners
[56:11] paul said i bring my body to subjection
[56:13] so i'm not cast away i'm not
[56:15] disqualified for winning the race
[56:19] praise god
[56:22] how many left the bible still
[56:24] has today praise god
[56:27] i love it oh my so beautiful i heard
[56:29] that thought like
[56:31] the sermon was only 18 minutes but
[56:33] i got i got to send this out i got to
[56:35] preach this to myself this is so good
[56:38] the other metaphor is returning back to
[56:40] sodom
[56:41] remember this one
[56:43] jesus said luke 17 that's where he said
[56:44] it talks about the son of man in the
[56:46] last days brother and it's ministry
[56:48] but the next verse he says
[56:50] in that day he which shall be upon the
[56:52] househop and his stuff in his house let
[56:54] him not come down and take it away and
[56:55] he that's in the field that likewise not
[56:57] returned back remember lot's wife
[57:03] see she re she attempted to return back
[57:05] to sam to save her life what would cause
[57:08] a person
[57:09] you could you can hear the fire and
[57:11] brimstone falling you can smell the
[57:13] sulfur
[57:14] you can smell that what would cause you
[57:17] to want to turn around and try to save
[57:19] some of that back
[57:21] it wouldn't be an evil heart
[57:23] right
[57:24] that's returning back i want to try to
[57:26] salvage anything i can from the world
[57:28] now isn't that so sad
[57:31] but see that's what people do they
[57:32] return back to sexual lusts
[57:34] right sodom so
[57:36] well i gotta if i can't have a marriage
[57:37] partner i i gotta have one i'll just
[57:39] leave the church
[57:40] i've heard people say that before
[57:42] i can't live single
[57:44] think about money anything where they
[57:46] turn back and they want to go back to
[57:48] the things of the world just to salvage
[57:50] a little bit of the world oh lord just
[57:52] take all the world away from me praise
[57:54] god just give me enough so i don't have
[57:56] to beg give me enough so i don't forget
[57:57] you just give me that middle of the road
[57:59] praise god and i won't turn back i'll
[58:01] follow you i'll face forward all the
[58:03] time i'll never turn away i'll never
[58:05] look away there it is amen
[58:10] i never turn back and say oh that was
[58:11] actually pretty good when i got to smoke
[58:13] those cigarettes and
[58:14] that was awful
[58:16] awful
[58:18] children you don't need to go out into
[58:19] the world to prove that you're a
[58:21] believer
[58:22] and that brother was right never
[58:24] preached out i forget
[58:28] i can't remember his name
[58:29] but he said a greater testimony is
[58:31] staying out of the world that's true
[58:33] because jesus had a great that was his
[58:35] testimony he never went out in the world
[58:37] to enjoy the things of the world
[58:39] so if you were raised in the message and
[58:40] you overcome and stay in the message god
[58:42] bless you i believe there's great
[58:44] rewards for you praise god
[58:45] because that mimics jesus life
[58:48] now that our disqualifies some of us
[58:49] that's okay i'm going to keep trying to
[58:51] do as much as i can for the kingdom of
[58:52] god
[58:54] as long as i'm there already as long as
[58:56] my can take doc in the heavens the
[58:59] heavens great docking station that's all
[59:01] that matters because i know there's a
[59:03] medicine for me praise god amen
[59:05] hallelujah
[59:07] remember that's why don't turn around
[59:10] don't desire to go back to the smoking
[59:11] the drinking the customs swear and
[59:13] movies no don't desire that praise god
[59:17] amen
[59:19] like jesus set your face toward calvary
[59:21] amen
[59:22] set your face towards the rapture
[59:23] towards heaven hallelujah
[59:26] make no compromise
[59:33] this is lot what uh
[59:34] what uh oh yeah that's what brother said
[59:36] how do i overcome
[59:39] he said she was able to start but wasn't
[59:41] able to finish
[59:43] he said a lot of people were able to
[59:44] start but they don't finish
[59:46] right we got to be willing to say i'm
[59:48] not just starting i'm going to continue
[59:51] and i'm going to finish the race
[59:53] i'm going to finish this race i'm going
[59:55] to finish this war i'm going to finish
[59:56] this
[59:57] journey on my boat right now
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] but i'm not acquitted of the spiritual
[1:00:09] things of god amen
[1:00:11] i keep pressing on
[1:00:14] see what she was trying to preserve she
[1:00:16] was trying to save some of her life
[1:00:18] i could save that dress or i could
[1:00:21] i could save that picture of my family i
[1:00:22] could save that
[1:00:24] remember church the angels had to pull
[1:00:26] them out of there
[1:00:27] they had to grab lots wrists and pull it
[1:00:29] drag him out of there
[1:00:31] that's the virgin type but abraham live
[1:00:33] far far away from that praise god amen
[1:00:35] we live far far away from those things
[1:00:37] praise god
[1:00:40] itching ears i shared this one earlier
[1:00:41] remember
[1:00:43] itching ears means to uh scratch or
[1:00:46] tickle you ever have it itch you just
[1:00:47] can't help it you probably see me do it
[1:00:49] all the time
[1:00:51] gotta itch you know
[1:00:53] this is the illustration of falling away
[1:00:56] now the bible said they will heap which
[1:00:58] means accumulate in piles they will
[1:01:00] build piles
[1:01:01] of preachers that tickle their ears
[1:01:03] isn't that such a strange
[1:01:05] illustration
[1:01:07] they will accumulate they will pile up
[1:01:09] preachers who tickle their ears it's
[1:01:11] kind of like they got a playlist
[1:01:13] right they got a pile of playlist well
[1:01:15] listen to joe olsteen now listen to this
[1:01:17] person then td jakes now they're nice
[1:01:19] people but they ain't going to point you
[1:01:20] to the truth
[1:01:22] that right
[1:01:23] they just itch the ears
[1:01:26] right they don't really say lord they
[1:01:28] don't really say what the spirit's
[1:01:29] saying to the churches amen
[1:01:32] they just hit your ears be your best
[1:01:33] brother be the best you can be you can
[1:01:35] be better you can be smart you can be
[1:01:37] you can be stronger you can be more
[1:01:38] handsome you can be more beautiful you
[1:01:40] know all these natural things praise god
[1:01:42] but that's that's itching the ears
[1:01:44] that's making your flesh feel good don't
[1:01:47] pile those things up there
[1:01:49] clear out the decks amen and hear what
[1:01:51] the spirit's saying to the churches
[1:01:53] clear out everything get you somebody
[1:01:54] that'll tell you the truth get somebody
[1:01:56] that's saying what the spirit says amen
[1:01:58] amen these guys are not saying what the
[1:02:01] spirit says
[1:02:03] they're itching their ears
[1:02:06] they're scratching or tickling now what
[1:02:08] do you what happens when you get tickled
[1:02:10] do you laugh
[1:02:12] it's what these guys mainly do they make
[1:02:13] you laugh
[1:02:14] see
[1:02:17] a lot of laughing a lot of scratching
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:20] carnal things
[1:02:25] they look and then finally they turn
[1:02:26] their ear away and they won't even hear
[1:02:28] the message anymore they won't even hear
[1:02:29] the truths of the gospel anymore they
[1:02:30] won't even hear about holiness
[1:02:33] location
[1:02:35] they'd rather have somebody tickle their
[1:02:36] ears
[1:02:39] hardening heart i'm almost there by
[1:02:41] downstairs hold on
[1:02:45] sorry
[1:02:47] hebrews 3 is a powerful chapter on
[1:02:49] israel as a type of christianity
[1:02:53] if we hold fast the confidence and the
[1:02:55] rejoicing of hope firm unto the end
[1:03:00] there it is look conditional problems
[1:03:02] how do you remember that two remember
[1:03:02] that
[1:03:04] these are all conditional promises if
[1:03:07] you will be christ's house you will be
[1:03:09] his tabernacle his temple if you hold
[1:03:12] fast the word of god
[1:03:14] but you've got to hold it fast
[1:03:16] he says wherefore today if you'll hear
[1:03:18] god's voice harden out your hearts as in
[1:03:21] the days of the provocation
[1:03:22] heart of means stubborn
[1:03:26] which is self-will
[1:03:29] you ever had that you toss somebody this
[1:03:30] this this you can tell you can tell them
[1:03:32] for five minutes ten minutes you can
[1:03:34] tell them for an hour but even when
[1:03:36] you're done they'll say no i'm doing it
[1:03:37] my way
[1:03:39] you can pour out you can make them laugh
[1:03:40] you can make them cry you can barf your
[1:03:42] whole heart to them but they still say
[1:03:44] i'm doing it my way
[1:03:45] that's stubborn
[1:03:48] and this happened when on israel's
[1:03:50] second stage of grace in the wilderness
[1:03:53] in the sanctification stage
[1:03:56] see they hardened their heart
[1:04:00] and i was looking up you know um
[1:04:03] i was looking at petrified wood like
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:06] we're all supposed to have soft hearts
[1:04:07] right but then what happens uh sometimes
[1:04:10] wood can be petrified
[1:04:12] so that's when it's buried in mud really
[1:04:14] fast right and there's oxygen under
[1:04:16] there some other elements that remain in
[1:04:17] there and when you find that piece of
[1:04:19] wood later it is hard as a rock
[1:04:22] what happened
[1:04:23] it got quickly overthrown right a quick
[1:04:26] a quick temptation of safety
[1:04:29] right
[1:04:30] and the heart becomes hard reminds me of
[1:04:31] that woman brother talked about she used
[1:04:33] to be dancing with the dance kings in
[1:04:35] queens
[1:04:36] and she was saved and then she was
[1:04:37] walking by one day and she stopped for
[1:04:39] just a minute to go in there and listen
[1:04:41] to music and before she knew it she was
[1:04:43] dancing winning the trophies again
[1:04:45] and she come crying back to brother
[1:04:47] ram's house
[1:04:48] i'm lost i lost billy and brother i
[1:04:50] prayed for her and the the devil went
[1:04:52] out of her looked like a bat never went
[1:04:53] out of bowdan's house
[1:04:56] see she just stopped for a minute
[1:04:58] see she got piled over amen
[1:05:01] her heart got hard for a moment
[1:05:04] see she got overtaken her face got piled
[1:05:06] upon she got overtaken by a temptation
[1:05:09] quickly
[1:05:10] and her heart became so hard so she went
[1:05:12] out and danced of course she wasn't born
[1:05:13] again right
[1:05:15] when their brother afraid of her she got
[1:05:16] delivered
[1:05:19] see hardness of heart
[1:05:21] at one time she was so soft to the
[1:05:23] gospel she wouldn't even stop to listen
[1:05:25] to it so she's teachers we can't even
[1:05:26] stop to listen to those old things we
[1:05:27] used to listen
[1:05:29] can't even stop to listen to it
[1:05:31] because that's one step in getting close
[1:05:33] towards a hard heart
[1:05:40] let me see what i'm at
[1:05:43] one
[1:05:44] two three four i got one more though
[1:05:46] yeah i'll go kind of fast
[1:05:50] yeah
[1:05:51] i wish i could
[1:05:53] i feel bad i appreciate that
[1:05:55] all right i guess i always make it apart
[1:05:56] too that i'm like oh he's got to get to
[1:05:58] the other parts of the other part so the
[1:05:59] other sermons are working on when am i
[1:06:01] going to get to that
[1:06:04] it's the joy of the past record come
[1:06:05] back to me
[1:06:06] uh we don't want to be sober we're going
[1:06:07] to be humble
[1:06:09] we want to take god's will not our will
[1:06:12] in the same chapter paul says take heed
[1:06:14] bride of christ fellowship take heed
[1:06:16] brother jesse lest there be any evil
[1:06:18] heart of unbelief in you
[1:06:21] where you would depart from the living
[1:06:23] god
[1:06:26] but see instead exhort one another build
[1:06:28] it but build each other up today while
[1:06:29] it's called today lest there be any
[1:06:31] hardened
[1:06:32] through the deceitfulness of sin
[1:06:35] so here's the way you help people
[1:06:36] overcome when they're getting deceived
[1:06:38] you come up and you build them up in the
[1:06:40] faith
[1:06:42] so if you hear somebody they're
[1:06:43] struggling say oh i'm sorry about that
[1:06:45] but here let's pray together or let's
[1:06:47] talk about this or i can help you out
[1:06:48] with this uh god's gonna bless you god's
[1:06:51] gonna bring you through we gotta build
[1:06:52] them up we're all gonna be tempted we're
[1:06:54] all gonna have to go through deceitful
[1:06:55] temptations and things like that so we
[1:06:57] all must build one another up we must
[1:06:59] bear one another's burdens praise god
[1:07:05] for we are partakers of christ if
[1:07:07] there's a if again
[1:07:08] there's the f
[1:07:09] if it's conditional
[1:07:12] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:07:13] confidence set back to the end deceit
[1:07:15] means to be misled see the world will
[1:07:18] lead you astray but jesus is the great
[1:07:20] shepherd he'll lead you in passive
[1:07:22] righteousness praise god amen he'll lead
[1:07:24] you in holiness amen
[1:07:27] another metaphor is crucifying jesus
[1:07:29] afresh i have 13 metaphors
[1:07:32] the bible said those who partake this is
[1:07:33] judas they partake of gifts
[1:07:36] if they fall away they crucify the son
[1:07:39] of god afresh and put into an open shame
[1:07:43] in other words
[1:07:46] they kill the in the voice of god in
[1:07:47] their lives they kill that voice and
[1:07:49] they'll live anyway openly they'll live
[1:07:50] any way in public
[1:07:52] they'll put jesus to open shame that's
[1:07:54] what that word means public shame
[1:07:57] they'll speak against jesus they'll
[1:07:58] speak against the message they'll live
[1:08:00] all kinds of sinful things that's
[1:08:02] crucifying jesus christ the fresh that's
[1:08:04] what judas did he sold him out
[1:08:06] he said here here you roman soldiers
[1:08:08] here's jesus i'll give you the money i'm
[1:08:10] not going to be with jesus i want to see
[1:08:12] him arrested and think about that i want
[1:08:13] to see jesus christ arrested that's how
[1:08:15] far he got
[1:08:17] let his mentor his teacher his pastor
[1:08:20] his prophet let his prophet get arrested
[1:08:23] and sold them out
[1:08:25] that's crucifying christ the fresh
[1:08:29] and what does paul say paul says the
[1:08:31] people that crucified jesus they are
[1:08:33] thorns
[1:08:34] they're not the good plants they're the
[1:08:36] thorns right and the rain falls on the
[1:08:38] just and the unjust
[1:08:40] but i love this brother we're persuaded
[1:08:43] better things of you
[1:08:45] and things that accompany salvation
[1:08:47] though we thus speak
[1:08:49] praise god i'm persuaded better things
[1:08:51] for brother amen and sister
[1:08:53] for austin alina i've persuaded better
[1:08:56] things for all of you because you're
[1:08:57] hanging on to the things of god you're
[1:08:59] holding your profession steadfast unto
[1:09:02] the end praise god there's better things
[1:09:04] in store for us
[1:09:06] hallelujah thank god amen
[1:09:08] i better move on here the other one is
[1:09:10] trampling underfoot the son of god
[1:09:12] afresh that's in hebrews chapter 10
[1:09:14] how much more sore punishment shall he
[1:09:16] be thought worthy who have tried to
[1:09:18] underfoot the son of god encountered the
[1:09:20] bloody of the blood of the covenant
[1:09:22] wherein he was sanctified an unholy
[1:09:24] thing
[1:09:26] and hath done despite on the same unto
[1:09:27] the spirit of grace so just like judas
[1:09:29] again just like israel israel almost
[1:09:31] reigns in the promised land it's in that
[1:09:33] second stage where people can sell out
[1:09:35] jesus
[1:09:36] that's where they can trample underfoot
[1:09:38] that's where they can crucify him afresh
[1:09:40] in that second stage
[1:09:44] they reached the second stage
[1:09:46] they did the opposite so see how they're
[1:09:48] stubborn the holy spirit said do this
[1:09:49] they said no i'm stubborn i'm doing what
[1:09:51] i want to do instead
[1:09:54] i'm learning some good lessons today
[1:09:58] cast out away therefore your confidence
[1:10:00] which have great recompense of reward be
[1:10:02] confident in god's promises
[1:10:05] for you have need of what patience how
[1:10:07] many patients church
[1:10:09] see we get a portion of it but we always
[1:10:11] need more of it it's true
[1:10:16] after you've done the will of god
[1:10:17] everybody say after ready
[1:10:19] you've got to do god's will first and
[1:10:21] then after sometime soon you'll inherit
[1:10:23] the promise amen amen amen you got to
[1:10:25] follow god's steps
[1:10:28] obey be patient receive the promise
[1:10:30] praise god
[1:10:33] forget a little while and he that shall
[1:10:35] come will come and will not tear he's
[1:10:37] coming church he's coming oh yeah
[1:10:40] jesus is coming back someday amen let's
[1:10:42] live like it praise god amen he's coming
[1:10:44] back there's gonna come time he won't
[1:10:46] tear anymore
[1:10:47] he's coming back to rescue his people
[1:10:55] hallelujah bye
[1:11:03] but
[1:11:04] i never have enough time to preach
[1:11:07] second beater now i'm just gonna go this
[1:11:09] you brought from here with this peter
[1:11:12] calls balaam
[1:11:14] a well without water a cloud with no
[1:11:16] rain
[1:11:19] and then he says
[1:11:21] balaam was a man
[1:11:22] who used great swelling words of vanity
[1:11:25] to use the lustly flesh
[1:11:28] through when tightness
[1:11:30] those that were clean escaped from them
[1:11:31] who live in air
[1:11:33] in other words balaam brought people
[1:11:35] that were living holy he deceived them
[1:11:37] and brought them into fornication
[1:11:40] the bible said they were clean they were
[1:11:42] escaped those israelites that went down
[1:11:44] to baal pior they didn't escape from the
[1:11:46] things of the world but through balaam's
[1:11:47] false teaching he tempted them back into
[1:11:50] fornication
[1:11:51] to sexual sin
[1:11:55] that's what the bible says
[1:11:58] he promised them liberty oh you'll feel
[1:12:00] freer than ever if you just commit these
[1:12:02] sins
[1:12:03] but he actually was a servant of
[1:12:04] corruption he served money
[1:12:08] now look at what he says
[1:12:10] they were brought they were overcome by
[1:12:11] balaam and they were brought back into
[1:12:14] bondage
[1:12:15] so they they were sinners they got saved
[1:12:17] as israelites but then balaam convinced
[1:12:19] them to commit fornication and brought
[1:12:20] them back into slavery to sin
[1:12:24] for after they have escaped the
[1:12:25] pollutions of the world through the
[1:12:27] knowledge of the lord and savior jesus
[1:12:28] christ they're again entangled so you
[1:12:30] think about that they were entangled in
[1:12:32] their sins they confessed under moses
[1:12:35] but then they went to hear balaam preach
[1:12:36] and balaam tangled them back into their
[1:12:38] sins of tangled entanglements
[1:12:41] and now i'm a slave to a sinner i'm not
[1:12:43] free anymore the law of moses brought
[1:12:45] them out but they willingly went back
[1:12:47] into being entangled and addicted oh god
[1:12:49] help us be free amen amen hallelujah
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:53] if that happens they're free and then
[1:12:55] they go back to entangled the bible says
[1:12:57] the latter end is worse than the
[1:12:59] beginning
[1:13:03] it would have been better for them not
[1:13:04] to know the way of righteousness than
[1:13:06] after they've known it to turn from the
[1:13:08] holy commandment delivered to them
[1:13:10] but what's happened a true proverb the
[1:13:12] dog is returned to his own vomit again
[1:13:16] the sow that's the female adult pig
[1:13:19] the sow that was washed to her wallowing
[1:13:21] returned to the muck and mire
[1:13:24] and this reminds us of lot's life
[1:13:27] right she had left the things of the
[1:13:28] world but she's like i could just get a
[1:13:30] few more
[1:13:32] and turn back to uh turn back to the
[1:13:34] salt turn the salt right
[1:13:38] the dog left the vomit but it goes back
[1:13:40] to the bottom the pig leaves the mud and
[1:13:42] then goes back to the mud that's judas
[1:13:48] good warnings for church
[1:13:49] last one last one
[1:13:51] everyone take a deep breath
[1:13:53] refresh yourself
[1:13:56] the last one
[1:13:57] is satan uproots
[1:14:00] people's lives
[1:14:02] in other words they're no longer what
[1:14:04] the bible is paul said be rooted in what
[1:14:06] rooted and grounded in christ make sure
[1:14:08] your whole life is rooted in the word of
[1:14:09] god
[1:14:11] in other words i ain't going anywhere
[1:14:12] because i'm rooted in christ i'm not
[1:14:14] leaving this word because my whole life
[1:14:16] is connected it's holding on to this
[1:14:18] word i cannot be moved i shall not be i
[1:14:21] shall not be moved amen
[1:14:23] i'm like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:14:25] water amen
[1:14:26] hallelujah you're going to see that song
[1:14:28] or what buddy
[1:14:30] he's laughing
[1:14:31] is that song you want to sing
[1:14:35] see our roots got to be in the lone god
[1:14:37] in other words i love jesus christ more
[1:14:39] than this world amen
[1:14:41] i'm rooting that i'm hanging on to his
[1:14:43] love oh hold on i don't know
[1:14:46] but really his love is hanging on to me
[1:14:49] jude says
[1:14:51] these evil ones speak evil of things
[1:14:54] that they don't know they corrupt
[1:14:55] themselves see it's because they love
[1:14:57] sin they corrupt themselves
[1:14:59] they've gone the way look at this the
[1:15:01] threefold or the threefold judas group
[1:15:04] cain balaam and korah
[1:15:07] are just like judas
[1:15:10] cain refused the perfect will of god he
[1:15:12] refused the blood of the lamb
[1:15:15] balaam desired the permissible of god
[1:15:18] for money
[1:15:20] torah rebelled for personal position
[1:15:24] judas did all these things
[1:15:26] he denied the blood of jesus on the
[1:15:27] cross
[1:15:28] sold out for money
[1:15:30] right wanted a different worldly
[1:15:31] position
[1:15:32] he didn't want the position of an
[1:15:33] apostle
[1:15:34] but rather he turned on the highest
[1:15:36] position in the entire christianity was
[1:15:38] the apostle
[1:15:40] i'm trying to close
[1:15:42] and what you'd say jude said they are
[1:15:45] spots in your feast of charity see we're
[1:15:47] having a feast here today i don't know
[1:15:48] if you notice it but we're the beautiful
[1:15:50] feast of god's word amen amen
[1:15:52] every now and then a judas is scared
[1:15:54] comes among us
[1:15:56] right and the bible said the cain of
[1:15:57] balaam accora they feast with us look
[1:16:01] they feast with you sometimes they sit
[1:16:03] right among us
[1:16:05] and they feed themselves without fear so
[1:16:07] they feed this feast and they're not
[1:16:09] even they're under the fear of the lord
[1:16:11] but i'm already saved i'm i'm i can live
[1:16:14] however i want they don't have the fear
[1:16:15] of god like they need to
[1:16:17] you hear the preaching but it doesn't
[1:16:18] cause any godly reverence in them
[1:16:21] it doesn't make them clean out their
[1:16:22] lives they think they can live in sin
[1:16:25] what are they they're clouds without
[1:16:26] water they're carried about with winds
[1:16:29] trees use fruit wither there's no wither
[1:16:31] again wither
[1:16:32] getting weaker dying without fruit twice
[1:16:35] dead plucked up by the roots the raging
[1:16:37] waves of the sea foaming out their own
[1:16:39] shame wandering stars who has reserved
[1:16:41] the blackness of darkness forever
[1:16:43] they always corrupt themselves they let
[1:16:46] themselves get plucked up out of the
[1:16:49] ground and taken away from being rooted
[1:16:52] and grounded in christ
[1:16:54] see church christ is our ground amen
[1:16:58] christ is where we need to be planted
[1:17:01] let's stand to our feet
[1:17:04] so here's the 13 the musicians can come

[1:17:26] found some more he just gave this idea

[1:18:31] life

[1:18:36] to the church and i'll reject anything
[1:18:38] that's outside of that praise god amen
[1:18:40] i will let the holy ghost write his word
[1:18:42] on the fleshly tables of my delicate
[1:18:45] heart
[1:18:46] glory amen
[1:18:48] i will crucify my affections and lust
[1:18:51] thereof and i will show forth the death
[1:18:54] of jesus christ in my mortal flesh

[1:19:18] god i'll grow up into christ in all
