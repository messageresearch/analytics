[25:51] you we'll read uh 14 15 and 16 as the
[25:55] the context here is speaking of the
[25:57] family of God being strengthened in the
[25:59] Inner Man by the Holy Spirit and surely
[26:01] that's what we desire right we desire to
[26:03] be strengthened here tonight by the Holy
[26:05] Spirit hallelujah how many how many
[26:07] would like more strength as you leave
[26:08] here tonight by God's good who how many
[26:10] want to be stronger tonight Hallelujah
[26:12] well we come to the right place
[26:13] hallelujah thank God for that Ephesians
[26:17] 31415 and
[26:24] 16 so let's read that we'll read 14 15
[26:27] and 16 and let's begin on three 1 2 3
[26:31] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[26:35] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[26:38] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[26:41] named that he would Grant you according
[26:45] to the riches of his glory to be
[26:48] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[26:51] the Inner Man amen let's have one more
[26:53] word of prayer here father God we thank
[26:55] you again for tonight Lord God may we be
[26:57] strength ened with your spirit in the
[26:59] Inner Man Lord as we are the family of
[27:02] God hallelujah we're grateful Lord
[27:04] thinking of our family Lord God Moses is
[27:07] our brother my Enoch is our brother
[27:10] Elijah Elisha brother brandham
[27:13] Hallelujah Martin Luther John Wesley
[27:16] Lord God St Paul these are our brothers
[27:18] Hallelujah we have sisters like Sarah
[27:20] Rachel Lea we have this wonderful family
[27:23] Lord we're so grateful Lord that we have
[27:25] a family name a holy name a name that
[27:28] has no reproach the Lord Jesus Christ so
[27:31] father help us Lord to manifest the
[27:33] strength of God as only the family of
[27:36] Christ can dear God I know you will I
[27:39] know you'll help us Lord God in Jesus
[27:41] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[27:43] God bless you as you're being seated
[27:44] praise
[27:56] God Hallelujah so we'll look at the
[27:59] Christian family here part two um you
[28:02] know just reviewing we looked at the
[28:03] father as the commander uh the blessed
[28:06] man who seeks God's God's face seeks
[28:09] God's will seeks God first and he seeks
[28:12] the right way for his family we looked
[28:14] at how a husband uh meets the wife's
[28:17] needs by love and then we looked at just
[28:20] briefly on the calling for children some
[28:22] more some less and then we looked at the
[28:24] responsibility of the children uh by
[28:26] God's grace so I want to pick up kind of
[28:28] right where I left off
[28:30] um by the grace of the Lord I want to uh
[28:33] look at Ephesians 613 says wherefore
[28:36] take unto you the whole armor of God
[28:39] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[28:41] evil day and having done all to stand so
[28:45] I'm going to pick up on that scripture
[28:47] uh Isaiah 33:6 I'm going to pick up from
[28:50] there where the Bible said we must have
[28:52] the stability of the times praise God
[28:56] and so uh we we know these are Dark
[28:58] Times by God's grace the lean age is a
[29:01] age that's rich and increased with goods
[29:03] and says they don't need any more of God
[29:05] and we've got to battle that Spirit
[29:07] constantly right we need we need
[29:08] reminders that we need more of God
[29:10] hallelujah we can't trust in ourselves
[29:12] our bank accounts our jobs we can't
[29:14] trust in the economy right we can't
[29:16] trust certainly can't trust in our
[29:17] government or nor our leaders so we've
[29:19] got to remember uh that we're fighting a
[29:22] a battle we're fighting a war and we
[29:25] must do everything we can to stand for
[29:27] the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[29:30] especially in our homes and in our
[29:31] church by the grace of God the stability
[29:34] of our times as we said was wisdom and
[29:36] knowledge the scripture says of course
[29:38] we know that just generally it's the
[29:40] Holy Spirit anointing in our lives
[29:42] Hallelujah and then 1 Corinthians 15:58
[29:45] says wherefore my beloved Brethren be
[29:47] steadfast so there we see that steadfast
[29:49] again uh unmovable right so we have
[29:53] stability we're stable Christians
[29:56] unmovable always abounding in the work
[29:59] of the Lord hallelujah uh remember on
[30:02] Sunday we saw how Joshua said my house
[30:05] will serve the Lord your house your
[30:07] house is a business it's a spiritual
[30:08] business how many say business is good
[30:11] hallelujah amen I like that virtue I
[30:13] like that confidence amen hallelujah
[30:16] confidence in Christ we're we're to be
[30:18] be producing something we're to produce
[30:20] the love of God I'll say like this we're
[30:23] spiritual Gardens and we're supposed to
[30:24] produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[30:27] right we are a garden for Christ
[30:29] Hallelujah like in Song of Solomon the
[30:31] wife is the garden well we're a
[30:33] spiritual Garden we're supposed to bring
[30:35] forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit unto
[30:38] God Amen so he said be unmovable have
[30:42] stability in other words in these times
[30:44] the way you do that is always abound in
[30:47] the work of the lord always be fruitful
[30:49] in the work of the Lord for as much as
[30:52] you know that your labor is not in vain
[30:55] in the Lord so do we know when we get to
[30:58] heaven there will be no regrets no
[30:59] person in heaven will ever regret any
[31:02] labor they've done for Christ right
[31:04] they'll never say well I wish I would
[31:05] have prayed less while I was on Earth or
[31:07] I wish I would have went to church less
[31:09] while I was on earth right they're never
[31:11] going to say that right because God is
[31:13] going to reward them they fell in love
[31:15] with God on Earth and and all the
[31:17] blessings on Earth was just the
[31:18] foretaste of Glory Divine Hallelujah it
[31:22] was always just a foraste Hallelujah and
[31:25] God sees all of our labor and God is a
[31:28] rewarder of them who diligently seek him
[31:31] so we are uh we are commanded be
[31:34] unmovable have stability in these times
[31:38] now I was just you know thinking how you
[31:40] know these last uh 12 years have been
[31:42] such a shaking time for the message 12
[31:45] years ago the believe the sign I call it
[31:47] believe the slander website came out and
[31:49] it really sh shook a lot of people some
[31:52] of our dearest friends my wife and I
[31:54] some of our closest friends have fallen
[31:56] away from the message because of this
[31:59] website because they those people were
[32:01] able to be moved they didn't have the
[32:04] stability and I say that with all love
[32:05] and kindness they didn't have the
[32:07] stability of the scripture and you know
[32:09] as we reflect on some of the you know
[32:11] our friends we can see some of their
[32:13] character it really wasn't devoted to
[32:15] the word of God uh some of them were
[32:18] more uh prone to be drawn to
[32:20] popularity right or the lust of the eyes
[32:23] or the lust of the
[32:24] flesh uh they spoke more often about
[32:27] bank accounts and finances and business
[32:29] than they did the gospel of Christ and
[32:32] we can see that years later but when
[32:34] we're in the midst of you know growing
[32:35] up together you know in in Christ we
[32:37] maybe we didn't see that as uh maybe as
[32:40] plainly as we should or or maybe could
[32:42] by God's grace at that time we just all
[32:44] assumed everybody was 100% in the
[32:46] message but then we see how people can
[32:49] be so easily moved they they discover
[32:52] one thing about uh the message or they
[32:54] discover one thing and it just shakes
[32:56] them
[32:57] uh because they accept a seducing spirit
[33:00] and a doctrine of a devil but we're
[33:02] supposed to have stability in our times
[33:05] and what gives us stability is the
[33:07] wisdom of God it's the knowledge of God
[33:11] hallelujah and we stay abounding in the
[33:14] work of the Lord so people get
[33:16] distracted and families get distracted
[33:18] think of that families and some of these
[33:19] families that have fallen away either
[33:21] the father got distracted first or the
[33:23] wife I should say the husband or the
[33:25] wife uh it's not the children's
[33:28] responsibility it's the parents'
[33:30] responsibility so it proves the parents
[33:32] were uh they were they were
[33:34] instable they could be moved from the
[33:39] gospel uh and so church we are called to
[33:43] stand we are not called to stumble
[33:45] remember Jude 1:24 says unto him that's
[33:49] able to keep you from falling some of
[33:51] our closest friends and some of our
[33:53] Associates around the message have
[33:56] fallen they've stumbled at the word of
[34:00] God but the Bible said he's able to
[34:02] present you faultless before the
[34:05] presence of his glory with exceeding Joy
[34:08] amen hallelujah just as Israel stumbled
[34:11] at The Stumbling Stone you know since
[34:13] 2012 many people have been stumbling at
[34:16] the Bible revelations of the message
[34:18] Hallelujah they stumble at it they say
[34:20] well that doesn't mean what it really
[34:21] mean what it says about hair it doesn't
[34:23] really mean that just like just like the
[34:25] devil told Eve it doesn't really mean
[34:27] that you won't really die sister you
[34:31] really won't lose the anointing when you
[34:33] cut your hair but yet the Bible says you
[34:35] do right and who's right the Bible or or
[34:38] some uh some half half converted
[34:41] preacher we'll say it like that you know
[34:44] who's right the Bible's right hallelujah
[34:46] amen see and the the word of God uh
[34:49] makes us faultless because we're washed
[34:51] By the Waters of the word you know we
[34:54] think about you know some of these
[34:56] preachers that Fallen uh their families
[34:59] and and what I what I've seen is that
[35:00] their family fell first before they fell
[35:04] one man in particular here in Ohio uh we
[35:07] heard it on the tapes Years brother
[35:08] Brooks and I heard this man preach
[35:11] and right there in Lima and he we heard
[35:13] him preach that he let his children
[35:15] listen to rock and roll as long as they
[35:17] had headphones on he let him listen to
[35:18] rap as long as they had headphones on
[35:21] but we knew brother brandom said don't
[35:23] let that trash in your
[35:24] home you can't stop it Bo you know about
[35:27] it in there you got to get it out as
[35:28] best as you
[35:30] can and then the the man let his wife
[35:32] and daughters cut their hair trim their
[35:34] hair just a you could always tell you
[35:36] know it's straight on the back you know
[35:38] you could always tell well so that don't
[35:39] grow like that normally that's not a
[35:41] normal hair growth and then he let him
[35:44] wear the foundation like we saw a few
[35:45] weeks ago with visitors you know
[35:48] teenagers there's they got foundational
[35:50] makeup on well the Bible don't say it's
[35:52] okay to wear makeup you know but their
[35:55] family fell first and the preacher would
[35:56] let his teenagers uh sit in his office
[35:59] during the service when when hard
[36:01] preachers came in to
[36:03] preach hard like you know obeying the
[36:05] Bible you know like like believing what
[36:08] the Bible says hallelujah so the family
[36:10] fell first and I've got it on tape I
[36:12] heard it because Z reminded me of it
[36:13] brother Brook said in 2007 that man is
[36:16] going to fall so that man had all those
[36:19] things wrong in his family and then he
[36:21] made fun of brother Brooks how he wept
[36:23] and shouted and danced and cried and he
[36:25] made fun of brother Brooks's worship and
[36:27] brother Brooks is on tape brother
[36:28] brother Brooks said that man is going to
[36:30] fall and he fell uh would have been
[36:33] let's see seven plus 12 would have been
[36:35] six years later he fell away from the
[36:37] message and now he totally condemns
[36:39] brother brandom and and us and
[36:40] everything like that you know as far as
[36:41] message Believers and nobody would have
[36:43] thought that years ago because he had
[36:45] videos about promoting brother br's
[36:47] Ministry and all these things but what
[36:49] happened the family fell first he let
[36:51] his guard down in the home first and
[36:54] then it just brought him to ruin H
[36:57] Allelujah in other words they set up
[36:58] Idols in their home an idol of uh makeup
[37:02] right or in other words an idol of of of
[37:05] worldly Beauty Hallelujah my they set up
[37:08] all these Idols in their home and pretty
[37:10] soon it brought destruction to their
[37:12] home
[37:14] my so it's also called leaven A little
[37:17] leaven Levens the whole
[37:19] lump
[37:21] right now see if and if they would have
[37:24] ever gotten the presence of God God's
[37:25] presence would have rebuke them for that
[37:28] just like Paul walked up to Peter and
[37:30] said you're to
[37:31] blame right God don't have to use
[37:33] somebody to rebuke us God's spirit can
[37:35] rebuke us itself
[37:37] Hallelujah but if a person rebukes us
[37:39] let's not say Well they're just too hard
[37:41] or they're rough if it's right it's
[37:42] right if we're wrong we're wrong let's
[37:44] be honest before God hallelujah let's
[37:46] clean out our homes let's clean out the
[37:48] church let's just have a clean life
[37:50] before Christ
[37:51] Hallelujah why do we want a dirty life
[37:54] if Christ offers a clean life amen
[37:57] Hallelujah but see there's so much uh
[37:59] unstability in this time there's so much
[38:01] wavering in this time but we've got to
[38:03] be called to stability
[38:08] Hallelujah the Bible said in 1 Peter 2:8
[38:11] Christ is a stone of stumbling he's a
[38:14] rock of offense even them which stumble
[38:16] at the word and they stumbled at the
[38:18] makeup scriptures or the women not
[38:19] cutting their hair
[38:21] scriptures and the worldly pleasure
[38:23] scriptures they stumbled at these things
[38:25] they stumbled at real Holy Ghost
[38:28] worship and the Bible said they were
[38:30] being disobedient so when they disobey
[38:33] the the doctrine of the word of God they
[38:35] stumble Christ becomes an offense to
[38:37] them no matter how much they say how
[38:39] they love God or go to other churches if
[38:41] they disobey one word of that Bible
[38:43] they've stumbled at Christ the word
[38:45] because Christ is the word amen
[38:48] hallelujah where also they were
[38:50] appointed so in other words that now we
[38:52] go back Peter goes back well remember
[38:54] God the Potter he makes some to honor
[38:56] and some to dishonor thank God church we
[38:58] ought to be grateful that we've got
[38:59] stability in these times amen that means
[39:02] God has ordained us God has appointed us
[39:05] as vessels of mercy and not vessels of
[39:08] Dishonor
[39:12] Hallelujah so entire our entire lives
[39:14] are built upon Christ the word and of
[39:17] course 2015 was the tape worship
[39:19] movement of course we're not really
[39:20] affected by that too much uh thank God
[39:23] uh by the grace of
[39:25] God but you know uh the word of God when
[39:28] it's truly preached it becomes an
[39:30] offense to people and we have to admit
[39:33] too some some scriptures are harder for
[39:35] us to obey than others right because we
[39:37] all have human
[39:38] weaknesses right in each family each
[39:41] home if you're honest you're not perfect
[39:43] at always obeying the word of
[39:45] God right every home has its weakness
[39:47] how many remember a question and answer
[39:49] 64 what did Brother Braham say he said
[39:51] my daughters battle me on the the length
[39:54] of dresses he says all the time
[39:57] so if you and I could have stepped into
[39:58] brother bram's home on a just a Sunday
[40:00] morning you would have heard Sarah and
[40:02] Rebecca saying well this is long enough
[40:04] daddy or this is long enough Mama Mama's
[40:07] like no go
[40:08] change right brother R said I fuss at
[40:11] them all the time you would have heard
[40:13] brother R fussing a prophet of God
[40:16] fussing saying no that's too tight go
[40:17] get on something more
[40:19] loose and the church said Hallelujah he
[40:22] tells us on tape that's why I love the
[40:24] tapes we get a view into a prophet's
[40:26] life now thank God both of them repented
[40:30] right Hallelujah and his daughter's
[40:32] Faith one passed on sister Rebecca
[40:34] passed on but Sister Sarah has has been
[40:36] married to a preacher all these years I
[40:38] think she's got six children if I'm not
[40:39] mistaken I know that because brother
[40:41] Troy swy I don't know if you remember
[40:43] him Troy suy from well now he's from
[40:45] Michigan uh he talked to her numerous
[40:47] times on the phone and so he kind of got
[40:49] that insight into brother bram's
[40:51] personal life there from I like that
[40:52] perspective rather than the other
[40:54] perspective coming out of Jeffersonville
[40:56] and you know why Hallelujah I like that
[40:59] perspective by God's grace because she's
[41:00] married to a preacher and they just
[41:01] don't press play and Obey because they
[41:04] press play and disobey but um you know
[41:07] those are the the shaking movements now
[41:10] you and I you know those two might have
[41:12] not have shaken us so much I'll be
[41:13] honest that first one did it shake it
[41:15] shook me quite a bit you know I had to I
[41:17] had to dig down deep that's in fact
[41:19] that's one reason why I started the
[41:20] YouTube channel was to dig down and
[41:22] prove to myself and everybody I preach
[41:24] to that we believe the message messages
[41:26] the Bible scriptures God's fulfilling
[41:29] right now I had to nail it down I want
[41:31] to prove it to my family I want to prove
[41:33] it to me I want to prove it to all these
[41:35] deniers all the people stumbling I want
[41:37] to prove it to them that we received the
[41:39] Bible revelations that Paul preached
[41:41] amen hallelujah amen God has restored
[41:44] our hearts to the apostolic fathers amen
[41:48] and nothing's proven to me more than
[41:50] doing that searching the Scriptures
[41:52] Daily proving whether these things be so
[41:55] amen but you know what God is behind all
[41:58] of this because the Bible said there
[42:00] must come a falling away and the Bible
[42:03] said in Isaiah 1914 the Lord hath
[42:06] mingled a perverse spirit in the midst
[42:08] of
[42:09] them God allowed this perverted Spirit
[42:12] to come in there to test them just like
[42:14] he did uh as as he told Mah and
[42:18] Ahab God said I need somebody to fulfill
[42:21] the scripture where ahab's going to go
[42:22] up and die and the dogs are going to
[42:24] lick his blood who will go for me God
[42:25] said and all these spirits come up and
[42:27] finally a lying Spirit uh came up and
[42:30] God saidwhat are you going to do he said
[42:31] 'i'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of
[42:33] 450 prophets and God said go do what you
[42:35] got to do go I'm sending this lying
[42:38] Spirit to fulfill the word of my Prophet
[42:41] amen Church how many know that every
[42:43] promise to a prophet of God when thus
[42:45] say the Lord it shall be fulfilled
[42:47] Hallelujah God will send that God uh God
[42:51] will send that evil spirit remember the
[42:53] Bible said an evil spirit from the Lord
[42:55] troubl
[42:57] Saul God allowed that because God saw
[43:00] the desires of Saul's
[43:02] heart Hallelujah God mingled the
[43:06] perverse Spirit Hallelujah in other
[43:08] words God is allowing these vessels to
[43:11] manifest what they want to manifest how
[43:13] many want to manifest real Holiness in
[43:15] this hour well God's got a spirit for
[43:17] you too amen it's called the Holy Ghost
[43:20] hallelujah amen not a perverted Spirit
[43:23] which means a wayward or distorted
[43:25] spirit but it's the spirit of truth
[43:28] hallelujah amen we wrestle not against
[43:32] flesh and blood as much as my wife and I
[43:33] would have liked to see our friends come
[43:35] back to the message and I I tried to
[43:37] debate with them in in a Godly way so
[43:40] did Simon we tried we couldn't do it
[43:42] because we're not wrestling against them
[43:43] now I I just wanted to go up to the
[43:45] brother and just shake him and say hey
[43:46] do you remember you were baptized in the
[43:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember
[43:49] IE witnessed to you you know remember
[43:50] the Bible remember what the Bible says
[43:51] about acts
[43:52] 238 right as much as I would have liked
[43:55] to done that that I'm not wrestling
[43:57] against flesh and
[43:59] blood it's against spiritual wickedness
[44:02] and in high places praise
[44:04] God right and we've got to let God fight
[44:07] some of these battles amen hallelujah
[44:10] it's not our it's not it's not our place
[44:12] to to to to to try to we can't fully
[44:15] convince somebody it's got to be God
[44:17] they've got to yield to the Holy Spirit
[44:19] just like we do praise God many of these
[44:22] things we just got to commit to God but
[44:25] I'll say like this for our houses we
[44:27] can't let perverse Spirits or spirits of
[44:29] idolatry or spirits of Doubt come into
[44:31] our house we've got to keep our house a
[44:34] house of worship Hallelujah a House of
[44:38] Prayer
[44:40] amen so I want to just that's that's
[44:42] just a few more scriptures on that idea
[44:44] of being stable in this time and I think
[44:48] you know Austin was sending me some good
[44:49] texts this week I think another thing
[44:50] people are trying to use is fear tactics
[44:52] in this time and I I've shared it with
[44:54] you you know I'm not a immune to it too
[44:57] sometimes I wonder is there going to be
[44:58] big trouble for this election in 2024
[45:00] like last time and we got that eclipse
[45:03] coming that's what awesome was sharing
[45:04] with that's a good example some people
[45:05] are so fearful that an eclipse is coming
[45:08] but the research I've done said eclipses
[45:10] are pretty pretty common and if you look
[45:12] in the Bible the eclipses generally deal
[45:15] with
[45:16] Israel right Hallelujah just like we had
[45:20] the blood moods come in 2015 you know
[45:22] now that was a real that was a real
[45:24] kicker right there because we had the
[45:26] Pope visit and then the leader of China
[45:27] visited all within a span of two months
[45:30] I thought the Rapture was coming I'll be
[45:32] honest cuz the pope had never come
[45:33] before that's the first time he come to
[45:35] the United States Barack Obama was in
[45:37] there he sure looked a lot like the
[45:38] Antichrist now I know it wasn't going to
[45:39] be he wasn't going to be the
[45:41] Antichrist but you know uh the fact that
[45:44] he was so uh liberal and people loved
[45:47] him so much it looked like it was a
[45:49] prefigure to the Antichrist the pope of
[45:51] course we know that but you know that's
[45:54] another issue we got to overcome is fear
[45:56] we've got to be stable while everyone
[45:58] else is faltering and stumbling and
[46:00] struggling we've got to be stable on the
[46:02] word of God and it starts in the home
[46:04] hallelujah
[46:07] hallelujah like the Bible said we just
[46:09] got to cast it down if you feel fear
[46:11] coming in your home throw it
[46:13] down like what do you do when you find
[46:15] trash you throw it down in the trash can
[46:16] right you don't throw it up to the trash
[46:18] can cast it
[46:20] down don't don't let this come into your
[46:22] house cast it down the Bible said throw
[46:24] it down cast down anything that exalts
[46:28] itself against the word of God and I
[46:30] believe this church if we do that I
[46:32] believe if we cast down all Temptations
[46:34] and evil spirits I believe God will give
[46:36] us the holy spirit in preparation for
[46:38] what's to come in other words I believe
[46:41] God will prepare us for any trials that
[46:43] God does
[46:45] allow right like God kind of prepared us
[46:47] for the uh uh the co thing because we
[46:49] knew we knew not to take the
[46:51] jab this video will probably get taken
[46:54] off of YouTube because of that but
[46:57] the VA a c c i n e is that how you do it
[46:59] is that how you get past all the Bots
[47:02] right can't even spell it let me just
[47:05] get a picture I'll put it up there on
[47:06] the screen so everybody can see it I
[47:07] don't see it's just
[47:09] ridiculous but people but so many people
[47:12] have suffered heart conditions because
[47:14] of the their their
[47:15] ways right but see the holy spirit gives
[47:18] us wisdom and understanding
[47:21] beforehand
[47:24] Hallelujah and you know the other the
[47:26] other thing was you know we'd had you
[47:27] know Church we've been in church long
[47:28] enough to know the Bible said gather
[47:30] more as you see that day approaching we
[47:32] weren't deceived when people stopped
[47:33] going to church we didn't quit going to
[47:35] church for two months we just stopped
[47:37] our Sunday night services and then we
[47:38] just started everything back up again
[47:40] brother cam never shut down any
[47:42] Services I was a little nervous I shut
[47:45] down the PM Services I didn't know what
[47:47] Co was flying around here I didn't know
[47:49] what it was doing they put all these
[47:51] pictures on there it was just a cold
[47:53] right but I don't know the way they were
[47:55] pumping it I didn't know what was going
[47:56] to happen but we were prepared in the
[47:59] sense that we're not going to stop going
[48:01] to
[48:02] church church attendance has fallen even
[48:04] further because of Co but see God had
[48:07] already prepared us for that if God
[48:09] called us to go to church then God's
[48:11] going to protect us at church hallelujah
[48:13] amen dear that is time to go home
[48:15] Hallelujah then we'll really be in
[48:17] church then hallelujah we'll be with the
[48:19] Saints in a really great church service
[48:21] an unending church
[48:23] service now I want to briefly look at
[48:25] the father's love a few more uh
[48:27] scriptures here before I move on to the
[48:29] next thought about creating peace in the
[48:31] home that's kind of what I felt led to
[48:33] look at here
[48:35] tonight now you just see the Father's
[48:37] Love in a few examples of course there's
[48:39] many examples but even with laan laan in
[48:42] Genesis 31:28 said and Hast not suffered
[48:44] me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou
[48:47] Hast now done foolishly in doing so so
[48:49] laan was upset with Jacob Jacob you know
[48:51] he snuck off because he knew Laban was
[48:53] probably gonna try to do something uh
[48:56] not nice to him not exactly sure which
[48:58] word I should say there but when lean
[49:00] finally caught up he said what do you
[49:01] mean you didn't let me kiss my children
[49:03] my daughters and so we see the Father's
[49:05] Love there he wanted to say goodbye now
[49:07] he turned out to be a pretty fair man
[49:09] there at the end but there we see a
[49:11] Father's Love I really wanted to say
[49:13] goodbye I really wanted to hug them and
[49:15] kiss them off right like a real dad or
[49:17] real father won't say just go I don't
[49:18] want to say goodbye you know I could do
[49:20] I do better without you right A real man
[49:24] has love for his family Hal
[49:26] that's right and
[49:29] Jacob uh when he didn't know about
[49:32] Joseph in Genesis
[49:34] 3735 he said for I will go down into the
[49:37] grave unto my son mourning thus his
[49:39] father wept for him so he was constantly
[49:41] weeping over what he thought was the
[49:43] loss of his son Joseph Now isn't that
[49:45] something Jacob was a prophet but God
[49:48] didn't tell him for all those years that
[49:50] his son was alive see church God like
[49:53] brother says God doesn't tell His
[49:55] prophets
[49:56] everything right God let him mourn the
[49:59] whole time yet his son wasn't
[50:01] dead cuz God was going to do something
[50:03] greater he was going to give him a real
[50:04] surprise amen a real joy unspeakable and
[50:07] full of Glory when he finally saw Joseph
[50:10] amen they wept on each other's neck they
[50:12] cried everybody could hear it what a
[50:14] reunion amen but God hid it from him but
[50:18] there we see the love of Jacob for his
[50:20] son
[50:21] Joseph even when David had committed the
[50:23] evil with basheba he still the Bible
[50:26] said in 2 Samuel 12:16 he still fasted
[50:29] and lay all night upon the earth now
[50:31] church when have you or I or how many
[50:34] people you know have fasted and laid
[50:36] awake not SLE slept been awake all night
[50:39] praying for something I'm talking about
[50:41] eight hours or more however long you
[50:45] sleep and this was this was his
[50:48] sincerity for a a newborn that's how
[50:51] sincere he was that's
[50:53] love how many believe that amen that's
[50:56] real
[50:57] love this is the kind of man David was
[51:00] and he didn't have the Holy Ghost in the
[51:01] soul either he wasn't filled with the
[51:03] Holy Ghost we'd say because the Holy
[51:05] Ghost could not be given until Jesus was
[51:07] glorified how about jarus in Mark
[51:10] 5:23 and jaras besought Jesus greatly
[51:14] saying my little daughter lith at the
[51:16] point of death I pray thee come and lay
[51:18] thy hands on her that she may be healed
[51:21] and she shall live so look he was like
[51:23] begging Jesus come lay hands on her
[51:26] she's at the point of
[51:28] death and Jesus was so merciful
[51:31] Hallelujah healing Jar's daughter amen
[51:33] this ought to encourage us to pray to
[51:36] plead with God to cry out to God when
[51:37] things go wrong you see the Father's
[51:40] Love in
[51:42] jarious and then I love of course the
[51:43] father The Prodigal this is typed to God
[51:46] Almighty Luke 15:20 and he arose and
[51:48] came to his father but when he was yet a
[51:51] great way off his father saw him and had
[51:53] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[51:55] and kiss him this shows God is a god of
[51:59] compassion this this son did everything
[52:02] to disrespect his father this son was
[52:05] acting like his father was dead come on
[52:07] Church he's basically acting like my
[52:10] dad's dead I got my inheritance I don't
[52:11] care about my dad but yet he was still
[52:13] there looking from a long way off is
[52:16] there any hope he's got to come back
[52:18] someday I'll be ready when he comes back
[52:20] that's a real Father's Love Hallelujah
[52:22] just like God did for you and I
[52:24] Hallelujah is that right
[52:25] God was ready to welcome us with open
[52:28] arms
[52:29] hallelujah
[52:32] amen that's what I experienced when I
[52:34] became a Christian you know I fought
[52:35] against or just you
[52:37] know mocked Christians as I was growing
[52:39] up or as a teen but as soon as I became
[52:42] a Christian all the Christians I knew
[52:44] they just welcome me right in nobody was
[52:47] like oh I remember when you said that
[52:48] and I remember when you said that I
[52:50] don't no they just welcome me right in
[52:52] Hallelujah just like we welcome Austin
[52:54] right in right
[52:55] Hallelujah every saint that gets saved
[52:57] we just welcome you right in Hallelujah
[52:59] God's been looking forward to this day
[53:01] amen the father's been waiting
[53:03] Hallelujah with open arms amen no matter
[53:07] how much we've disrespected God or or
[53:09] done despite Grace the Bible said he's
[53:11] rich in Mercy Hallelujah he's ready to
[53:14] welcome his children home oh thank God
[53:17] Amen to the father's house
[53:20] Hallelujah now Church our responsibility
[53:23] now I want to get into the parents again
[53:25] and then I I'm going to end with the
[53:26] wives responsibilities remember I showed
[53:28] the the husband's five duties for the
[53:30] wife I want to end with the wives but
[53:32] before that you know we we must create
[53:35] peace in our home that's one uh great
[53:39] command that we must have uh Cas I like
[53:41] how you're so ready she got her eyes on
[53:42] me she's like Daddy tell me Daddy tell
[53:44] me I'm gonna put that I'm ready I'm
[53:45] ready I appreciate that uh Romans uh
[53:50] 1417 it's a pretty good book anybody
[53:52] ever heard A good sermon on Ro Romans
[53:54] before
[53:57] it's a great book Hallelujah you can
[53:59] highlight every verse in there like that
[54:01] Meme shows Romans 14:17 for the kingdom
[54:04] of God how many know the kingdom of God
[54:06] is actually within
[54:08] you it's not meat and drink as much as
[54:11] we want to have a good diet and things
[54:13] like that but it's righteousness peace
[54:16] and joy in the Holy Ghost am and I want
[54:19] to apply this just to our home life
[54:21] remember uh we looked at wisdom and
[54:23] judgment right we looked at that on on
[54:24] Sunday so so a wisdom in judgment
[54:27] produces righteousness like we saw right
[54:30] if you judge every case the right way
[54:32] with the wisdom of God you'll have
[54:34] righteousness in your
[54:35] home right so when we have the Holy
[54:38] Ghost we should have righteousness we
[54:39] should do what's right we should have
[54:41] the character of Christ and we should
[54:44] have peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so
[54:47] these three attributes it's an
[54:48] interesting Paul brings them out it's
[54:50] kind of like faith hope and and joy
[54:52] right but in this case he uh similar to
[54:54] that but we have three of them we have
[54:56] uh righteousness peace and
[54:59] joy and I just want to you know focus on
[55:02] on on
[55:03] peace uh you know because in our homes
[55:07] uh we got a busy home with with eight
[55:09] children you know and there everybody's
[55:11] talking lots of times and having a good
[55:13] time and sometimes there's a lot of
[55:15] talking sometimes sounds like a lot of
[55:19] commotion uh you know what I'm saying
[55:23] there just a lot of talking a lot of
[55:25] noises and sometimes shouting screaming
[55:27] and crying you know sometimes there's
[55:29] like that and so sometimes you know uh
[55:32] if it's at the end of the day or there's
[55:33] a lot of noise it doesn't sound very
[55:35] peaceful
[55:36] right and uh I'm not saying that the you
[55:39] know every house just has to be quiet
[55:41] all the time there there's times of
[55:43] course for joy and laughing and teasing
[55:45] and as long as it's good
[55:46] teasing uh jokes and everything like
[55:49] that but I'm talking about the peace of
[55:51] God I mean peace between the siblings
[55:53] and the parents that's kind of peace I'm
[55:55] talking
[55:56] about so we should have the peace of God
[55:59] in our homes Hallelujah in other words
[56:02] we don't want anger between Fathers and
[56:05] Sons we don't want hurt feelings between
[56:07] fathers and daughters Hallelujah we
[56:10] don't want hurt feelings between
[56:12] husbands and wives we want to have peace
[56:15] amongst the family
[56:16] members right and the Holy Ghost
[56:19] produces
[56:21] this and this is one of the uh uh
[56:24] important scriptures of the Holy Ghost
[56:25] so in a person's life in their home they
[56:28] should be able to manifest righteousness
[56:30] I do what's right I have the peace of
[56:32] God in my home and I have the joy of the
[56:35] Holy
[56:36] Ghost I've told you this before but
[56:38] almost every visitor that comes to our
[56:39] church says wow I really feel the
[56:41] presence of God in your church I really
[56:43] feel the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[56:44] there's something different about uh
[56:46] your singing and uh the people love to
[56:48] worship and the people really pull on
[56:50] the word of God what is that that's
[56:52] that's the effects of the kingdom of God
[56:55] the kingdom of God is here
[56:57] hallelujah kingdom is Dominion it's the
[56:59] rule the Holy Ghost rules our church
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:05] amen and it should also of course rule
[57:08] our
[57:10] homes so see if we judge like we saw on
[57:13] Sunday the scriptures if we have wisdom
[57:15] in judgment it'll produce this it's just
[57:18] this it's the holy spirit in another
[57:19] form right another more different fruits
[57:21] and attributes of the same Holy Spirit
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:26] so and remember peace is one of the nine
[57:28] fruits of the Holy Spirit we're not
[57:30] going to read it but it's in Galatians 5
[57:31] we're familiar with that it's one of the
[57:32] nine fruits of the Holy Spirit now I
[57:34] want to bring this out too in Zechariah
[57:36] 8 if you would uh Zechariah 8 verse 16
[57:39] And1
[57:41] 17 you know Zechariah of course was
[57:43] remember he was a prophet along with
[57:45] Hagi as Israel was returning back to the
[57:49] promised land from Babylon right and
[57:52] Hagi and prophesy Hagi and Zechariah
[57:55] prophesied at the same time and it
[57:56] strengthened the people to finish
[57:58] building the house of God okay and then
[58:01] later Nehemiah came around and he
[58:02] finished the wall around the city okay
[58:05] but look what Zechariah says these are
[58:07] the things that ye shall do so when you
[58:09] get your church established when you get
[58:11] the city surrounded and you got
[58:13] protection here's what you need to do
[58:15] how many like that I like the Holy
[58:17] Spirit to tell me what to do I've always
[58:19] been that way like with my boss or
[58:21] anybody my wife or my children just tell
[58:23] me what you want me to do I I want to do
[58:24] it by God's grace uh don't don't don't
[58:27] don't be vague don't be General
[58:28] especially if I might work if I'm going
[58:30] to get graded on something or if my
[58:32] livelihood depends on this just tell me
[58:33] what you want I'll do whatever you want
[58:35] right in other words I don't want to
[58:37] fail I want to do what's right
[58:38] Hallelujah just tell me don't beat
[58:40] around the bush just tell me what you
[58:41] want me to do Hallelujah make it clear
[58:44] I'm sure you say the same way with
[58:45] preachers right preacher don't beat
[58:47] around the bush just tell me what the
[58:49] Bible says right just get to the point
[58:52] and these are the things that you shall
[58:53] do speak ye every man the truth to his
[58:55] neighbor see there's the Judgment right
[58:58] execute the Judgment of Truth and peace
[59:01] in your
[59:02] Gates okay so peace so he said have
[59:06] judge isn't it isn't it awesome to see
[59:07] the same attributes of the holy spirit
[59:09] in the Old Testament the New Testament
[59:12] that was na in the natural just judge
[59:14] things right and have peace and we see
[59:17] the holy ghost in the spiritual produces
[59:19] the same
[59:20] thing so we should have both we should
[59:22] have peace and righteousness joy in our
[59:24] hearts but also in our homes in our
[59:26] church praise God like I told you I'm
[59:28] very thankful these last five or some
[59:30] years since 2018 we've had lots of years
[59:32] of Peace by God's
[59:34] grace no nights where I've had very few
[59:37] nights where I'm up and I can't sleep
[59:38] because of the problems in the church
[59:40] that's been a blessing I like to sleep
[59:42] Hallelujah I don't sleep enough though
[59:43] brother Austin I gotta work on that
[59:46] sleep but you know before that there was
[59:48] lot there was numerous nights I couldn't
[59:51] sleep very good because of problems in
[59:52] the church so I'm thankful for peace
[59:55] I'm thankful for peace in the
[59:57] gates Hallelujah but the Holy Spirit
[59:59] saidd do that execute
[1:00:02] judgment and create peace in your Gates
[1:00:05] and let none of you imagine evil in your
[1:00:07] hearts against his neighbor in other
[1:00:09] words love your neighbor as
[1:00:11] yourself this is my commandment that you
[1:00:14] love one another that's why I say that
[1:00:16] tonight thinking about the love of God
[1:00:18] and love no false oath don't believe a
[1:00:20] lie for all these things that I have
[1:00:22] hate sayeth the Lord so the Lord hates
[1:00:24] us imagining evil in our hearts and
[1:00:26] being angry against our neighbors right
[1:00:29] unjustly and lies false
[1:00:32] Oaths so see I think it's just beautiful
[1:00:35] the Old Testament uh commands do this do
[1:00:39] peace keep peace in your cities keep
[1:00:42] peace in your home keep peace in the
[1:00:43] church and the Holy Ghost produces
[1:00:46] peace now what what's what's
[1:00:51] uh what's a what's our battle what our
[1:00:53] struggle is is that we're supposed to
[1:00:55] have peace but inside we have a constant
[1:00:57] war going on remember that from Romans 7
[1:00:59] pull up Romans
[1:01:01] 7:23 Paul says I want to do right but
[1:01:04] then Evil's right there and I do things
[1:01:06] that I
[1:01:07] hate but I see another law in my members
[1:01:11] Waring against the law of my mind I know
[1:01:13] what brother Jesse preaches I know what
[1:01:14] brother Brandon preaches I know uh what
[1:01:17] the Bible says but sometimes we have
[1:01:18] wars in our
[1:01:20] minds it's hard to do that it's hard to
[1:01:23] remember what what was preached on
[1:01:24] Sunday what what what what what what
[1:01:28] kind of atmosphere should I have in my
[1:01:29] house what's really important right
[1:01:32] now we're supposed to promote peace in
[1:01:35] our homes but then there's a war going
[1:01:38] on constantly inside of us
[1:01:41] hallelujah and that's why like the Bible
[1:01:43] like he says here we got to bring all
[1:01:46] those Wars into captivity we got to end
[1:01:48] the war and we got to create peace in
[1:01:50] our
[1:01:51] minds
[1:01:53] Hallelujah so if there's a war in your
[1:01:56] mind because of someone in the home you
[1:01:57] got to go talk to them about it and
[1:01:58] create
[1:01:59] peace we got to confess our wrongs and
[1:02:02] say qu okay can we start all over again
[1:02:03] by God's
[1:02:05] grace can we start over can we can we uh
[1:02:08] just forget about our our failures and
[1:02:10] our shortcomings I'll forgive you you

[1:02:15] do so many times I've had to say I'm
[1:02:17] sorry to my wife and can we start all
[1:02:19] over again forgive
[1:02:20] me I need God's grace right Hallelujah
[1:02:25] but see we're we're supposed to create
[1:02:27] peace but we have a constant war going
[1:02:30] on so we've got to win the war on the
[1:02:32] inside thank God the Bible says greater
[1:02:34] is he that's in you than he that's in
[1:02:36] the world hallelujah amen we've got
[1:02:39] greater power inside of us to get peace
[1:02:41] inside of ourselves that way we can
[1:02:43] create peace in our homes
[1:02:46] Hallelujah and we do that again by
[1:02:48] casting down
[1:02:51] imaginations I'm sure you feel it you

[1:04:42] godhead like some people do that's wrong
[1:04:44] we were in we were in God's mind but
[1:04:46] that doesn't mean we're a member of the
[1:04:47] godhead like some people say what a
[1:04:49] bunch of nonsense but we were in God's
[1:04:52] mind right and we can in other words we
[1:04:55] can create we can cast down the wrong
[1:04:57] and we can create the right even if

[1:05:25] talking about this this mother who did I
[1:05:27] mean she did everything she was the
[1:05:29] volunteer on that committee that
[1:05:30] committee and they let her say a few
[1:05:31] words and she said well did you notice
[1:05:34] uh I forgot to put in there that I I

[1:05:39] I got to bite my tongue and be like
[1:05:41] everybody's laughing around me all these
[1:05:43] so-called Christians are laughing in
[1:05:44] other words like it's okay for me to go
[1:05:46] home and drink and get wasted because
[1:05:48] I've had such a hard day it's never okay
[1:05:50] to do that because you're giv place to
[1:05:53] the devil
[1:05:55] right but see I I get tested like that
[1:05:57] too and I just had to grip my teeth and
[1:05:59] say I'm not going to laugh at that
[1:06:00] that's not
[1:06:01] funny the real wine you need to drink is
[1:06:04] the Holy Ghost praise God like I do
[1:06:08] Hallelujah some days it's harder than
[1:06:09] others right but eventually I'll get to
[1:06:11] that good drink of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:13] Hallelujah all my sorrows will be gone
[1:06:15] hallelujah amen that's right so no
[1:06:19] matter what job we're on you know we've

[1:06:23] spirits that come against us
[1:06:25] hallelujah God helps us hallelujah we
[1:06:27] have the war battling we we battle but
[1:06:30] we must overcome we must be committed to
[1:06:32] the battle praise God and not give up on
[1:06:35] the battle remember brother R said he
[1:06:37] when he sinned it was because he was
[1:06:39] weary and tired and don't you find that
[1:06:42] to be the same
[1:06:43] church the times we struggle the most is
[1:06:46] times we're tired physically not getting
[1:06:47] enough rest or we're sick or it's just
[1:06:50] the end of the day and we're just tired
[1:06:53] but remember we must wait upon the Lord
[1:06:55] in order to renew our strength
[1:06:57] hallelujah amen we must give God some
[1:06:59] time we must cry out to God we must call
[1:07:01] upon God
[1:07:03] hallelujah we got to give God some time
[1:07:05] to meet our needs and not just rush to
[1:07:08] the F the the thing that feels good
[1:07:11] right like that good memory verse the
[1:07:13] girls uh was it
[1:07:14] Eden said not to fulfill the lust of the
[1:07:17] flesh right was that that's right that
[1:07:19] was was that Romans anybody remember
[1:07:21] that verse where was that found what was
[1:07:23] it Haven
[1:07:25] bless your heart give her two class
[1:07:27] Hallelujah Romans
[1:07:28] 13:14 don't fulfill the lust of the
[1:07:30] flesh right make no provision for the
[1:07:33] flesh
[1:07:34] Hallelujah and that's where we need the
[1:07:36] help by the grace of God how many would
[1:07:37] say they need God's help that's what
[1:07:38] brother R said that's what I need to
[1:07:40] help that's when I struggle the most is
[1:07:41] when I'm tired and worn
[1:07:43] out we all need it praise
[1:07:46] God that's why I love what the Bible
[1:07:48] said Joy comes in the morning mercies
[1:07:50] are renewed every morning in the morning
[1:07:53] I feel refreshed I can get a clean start
[1:07:55] I'll get rededicated to God I'll get
[1:07:57] refocused on God hallelujah and we'll
[1:07:59] have a good day by God's
[1:08:01] grace amen so we must create peace
[1:08:06] Hallelujah now I'm coming down to 40
[1:08:09] minutes all right now I want to put
[1:08:11] these up there like I did on um Satur or
[1:08:14] Sunday for the the men I want to put
[1:08:16] these quotes up here for our sisters
[1:08:18] Hallelujah also for our brothers
[1:08:22] amen so again I I I as I preach the
[1:08:25] different marriage Banquets you know I
[1:08:27] read this one book if you haven't read
[1:08:28] it for marriage I think I recommend it
[1:08:30] everybody it's called his needs her
[1:08:32] needs um it's a great book and it's
[1:08:35] based upon this one uh
[1:08:37] psychologist's thousands of interviews
[1:08:40] now I know any person that's in the
[1:08:42] message that hears me say that they'll
[1:08:44] say oh he needs a he's saying we need
[1:08:46] psychologist I'm not saying that right
[1:08:49] there used to be this big thing uh oh we
[1:08:52] the preachers rely on doct Dr Dobson
[1:08:54] instead of brother brandham and church I
[1:08:56] know what they're saying I know Dr
[1:08:58] Dobson is not a prophet I never studied
[1:09:00] Dr
[1:09:01] Dobson right but what I'm saying is that
[1:09:04] I read the book and then I found
[1:09:06] everything he said any truth in his book
[1:09:08] was already in the Bible if he said
[1:09:11] anything true if that psychologist had
[1:09:13] any truth it was already right in the
[1:09:15] Bible Hallelujah and so that's what I
[1:09:17] did is I read this book a friend re
[1:09:19] another pastor friend REM recommended
[1:09:21] that I read it and I read it and I saw
[1:09:22] wow the five needs of a woman that's in
[1:09:25] the Bible the five needs of the man
[1:09:27] that's in the Bible so it's true now I
[1:09:30] throw out I throw out all the the cherry
[1:09:32] pits right throw out all the cherry pits
[1:09:34] in there and you just take what's true
[1:09:37] to me it just shows science is just
[1:09:39] proving more that God's
[1:09:41] right I'm not saying go to the
[1:09:43] psychologist I'm saying get the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost and then the Holy Ghost will be
[1:09:46] your
[1:09:47] psychologist now let me say this there
[1:09:48] are some people that suffer really bad
[1:09:50] things and they might need to go see a
[1:09:51] Christian psychologist I'm talking about
[1:09:54] really hard things like abuse and things
[1:09:56] really difficult things they might need
[1:09:58] somebody that can really talk to them
[1:10:00] and God can use that and if people don't
[1:10:03] understand that the shame on them you
[1:10:05] know they're just being judgmental
[1:10:06] they're just they just got a critical
[1:10:08] spirit by God's
[1:10:10] grace uh because remember the Bible said
[1:10:12] a wounded Spirit who can bear and church
[1:10:14] I know people who have been abused and
[1:10:17] they cannot be healed many of them
[1:10:19] haven't been healed because they haven't
[1:10:20] gone to get help and just what I mean is
[1:10:23] just sit down and talk with somebody
[1:10:24] about it they just keep it all bottled
[1:10:26] within it don't have to be a a counselor
[1:10:29] I just mean they got to sit down with
[1:10:30] somebody and just share it and then just
[1:10:33] request prayer because I know because
[1:10:35] I've sat with them as we wept and cried
[1:10:37] together and they won't go tell people
[1:10:39] they won't talk about it and I'm not
[1:10:41] saying anything any anything evil
[1:10:42] against them I'm just saying some people
[1:10:44] need that
[1:10:45] outlet some people just need somebody to
[1:10:49] listen now I I can be that too as a
[1:10:51] pastor I can do that I'll keep
[1:10:52] everything in confidence by God's Grace
[1:10:53] I'll try I'll try with all my heart to
[1:10:55] keep it in
[1:10:58] confidence I'm just saying there you
[1:10:59] know some people just they criticize
[1:11:01] anything that doesn't come from brother
[1:11:03] brandham and yet brother brandham got
[1:11:05] all these sermons from other places like
[1:11:07] Dr Scofield Dr Lin a Baptist preacher
[1:11:10] and the church said brother Ram got many
[1:11:13] parts of his sermons from a
[1:11:15] Baptist my goodness these people anyways
[1:11:18] haters are going to hate like they
[1:11:20] say so as we look at our sisters
[1:11:23] remember
[1:11:24] a Proverbs 31 Woman she has two things
[1:11:26] about her she fears God and she does
[1:11:29] good to her husband all the days of her
[1:11:30] life I preached on this year years ago
[1:11:32] and I preached that proverb
[1:11:34] series see she will do him good and not
[1:11:37] evil all the days of her life see if a
[1:11:39] remember a sister sisters are are we'd
[1:11:42] say on the bottom of responsibility
[1:11:44] right God Christ husbands wives right
[1:11:49] but the Bible said she will be praised
[1:11:52] the Bible said the children and the
[1:11:54] husband will praise her because she
[1:11:56] fears God she she respects all those in
[1:11:59] Authority she respects God's order of
[1:12:02] authority and then she's active she she
[1:12:05] ministers to the children of course I
[1:12:07] didn't put the whole chapter up here but
[1:12:08] she's always ready to get up and
[1:12:09] minister to the children she's always
[1:12:11] ready uh to help out financially you
[1:12:13] know she's able to do whatever the
[1:12:15] family needs she's there for it praise
[1:12:18] God and notice she does him good and not
[1:12:21] evil all the days of her life
[1:12:25] Hallelujah her children rise up and call
[1:12:28] her blessed as you skip forward some
[1:12:29] verses her husband also and he Praises
[1:12:33] her Hallelujah why because she always
[1:12:35] does him good she always treats him so
[1:12:38] well praise God many daughters have done
[1:12:41] virtuously but thou excellest them all
[1:12:44] of course this speaking of the bride of
[1:12:45] Christ Hallelujah
[1:12:48] right favor is deceitful and beauty is
[1:12:51] vain because it'll fade but the woman
[1:12:53] that fearth the Lord she shall be
[1:12:56] praised so we see two strong attributes
[1:12:59] about her she fears God and she does
[1:13:02] good to her husband all the days of her
[1:13:04] life Hallelujah she she respects God's
[1:13:09] order Hallelujah remember don't forget
[1:13:12] that hubby's got a love too he's got to
[1:13:14] lead with love he's got to be a loving
[1:13:17] man patient
[1:13:20] man now I brought this one out too uh 1
[1:13:23] Corinthians 7:14 you're familiar with
[1:13:25] this for the unbelieving husband is
[1:13:28] Sanctified by the
[1:13:29] wife and the unbelieving wife is
[1:13:31] Sanctified by the husband else were your
[1:13:34] children unclean but now they are holy
[1:13:37] so even if one spouse male or female
[1:13:39] even if the spouse isn't serving God
[1:13:42] they know that if God is anointing my
[1:13:44] life my life is making my spouse's life
[1:13:47] more
[1:13:48] clean my life is sanctifying my spouse's
[1:13:51] life Hallelujah that's the word of God
[1:13:55] that's thus say the scripture Hallelujah
[1:13:58] right in other words the power of a holy
[1:14:01] life in the
[1:14:03] home uh cannot be measured a Christian
[1:14:06] spouse influences the whole home and the
[1:14:09] Bible said makes the children
[1:14:12] holy right now that doesn't mean
[1:14:14] children don't have to repent but it
[1:14:16] means the presence of God in other words
[1:14:18] it's like job that mother or father
[1:14:20] whichever one's holy the they prayed and
[1:14:22] God is going to protect those family
[1:14:24] members amen just like job said job said
[1:14:27] per Adventure if my children sin I'll
[1:14:29] still make sacrifices so God will have
[1:14:31] mercy on them amen
[1:14:35] hallelujah but if the unbelieving depart
[1:14:38] let him depart a brother or sister is
[1:14:39] not in bondage in such cases but God has
[1:14:42] called us to peace that doesn't mean
[1:14:43] they can go remarry somebody else the
[1:14:45] Bible explains that earlier in the
[1:14:46] chapter the Bible said if somebody
[1:14:48] leaves they either got to remain single
[1:14:49] or be reconciled so that's the devil
[1:14:52] uses that verse to make people a lot of
[1:14:54] people
[1:14:55] adulterers for what knowest thou oh wife
[1:14:57] whether Thou shalt save thy husband or
[1:15:00] how knowest thou oh man whether Thou
[1:15:02] shalt save thy
[1:15:03] wife you know I and I've met people on
[1:15:06] both sides when I first came in the
[1:15:07] message um there's some brothers we met
[1:15:10] up there in Sheffield and they were in
[1:15:12] the church but their wives
[1:15:13] weren't right and still to this day I
[1:15:15] don't know if their wives are
[1:15:18] converted
[1:15:21] um but I just love that Faith they'd
[1:15:23] keep coming to church they'd always pray
[1:15:25] for their wives now I know this one for
[1:15:28] sure I know this one for sure over in
[1:15:30] Lima there's a a mother who brought her
[1:15:32] three children to church when I first
[1:15:33] started going there and her husband
[1:15:35] wasn't even saved she kept praying kept
[1:15:37] believing now he died of cancer a couple
[1:15:39] years ago but he got saved and he went
[1:15:42] to a denominational church at least he
[1:15:44] never came in the message but he got
[1:15:46] saved and he respected brother brandom
[1:15:48] he respected the church as well because
[1:15:51] he saw the life that his wife and
[1:15:52] children children live by God's grace
[1:15:55] that's a good testimony of that see they
[1:15:58] were both they were both worldly but
[1:15:59] then she heard the message she grew out
[1:16:00] her hair she started wearing skirts took
[1:16:02] off all the makeup and she serves God
[1:16:04] today she goes to message church today
[1:16:06] by God's grace and God God you know what
[1:16:10] for what th what knowest thou oh wife
[1:16:12] whether thou sh whether Thou shalt save
[1:16:14] thy husband that woman is a fulfillment
[1:16:16] I'll just tell her name her name's
[1:16:17] sister Michelle praise God her Godly
[1:16:21] life won her husband over hallelujah
[1:16:24] amen what a beautiful testimony because
[1:16:27] this is what it's all about God calls us
[1:16:30] all to different
[1:16:32] situations but as God is distributed to
[1:16:34] every man as the Lord ha called everyone
[1:16:36] so let him walk and so ordain I in all
[1:16:39] churches right so whatever situation you
[1:16:42] find yourself in familywise God has
[1:16:45] ordained it right and remember the Bible
[1:16:49] said God will make all things praise him
[1:16:52] right all things will work together for
[1:16:54] your good
[1:16:55] hallelujah amen so I want to bring that
[1:16:58] out as well just the power of one spouse
[1:17:00] in the home now talk talk about the
[1:17:02] power of two spouses now now you got
[1:17:04] your children Hallelujah under the
[1:17:06] anointing of God even more by God's
[1:17:08] grace now here's a man's five needs for
[1:17:11] our sisters that are married Hallelujah
[1:17:13] see I preach on the brothers first right
[1:17:16] Brothers picked on them first I ain't
[1:17:19] picking on anybody by God's
[1:17:21] grace Hallelujah but I'm going to pick
[1:17:23] on somebody let's pick on me Hallelujah
[1:17:24] cuz I need it probably more than
[1:17:26] anybody so what the what the husband
[1:17:29] needs he needs respect and he needs
[1:17:32] submission he's always got to be
[1:17:34] respected and as long as he says what's
[1:17:36] what's right he needs submitted to that
[1:17:38] makes a man feel like a
[1:17:40] man he needs physical
[1:17:43] intimacy he needs a companion so when he
[1:17:46] wants to do something for fun as long as
[1:17:48] it's not sinful it's good for the wife
[1:17:50] to join
[1:17:52] him
[1:17:53] uh then he needs uh he needs a wife
[1:17:56] who's attractive right so our sisters
[1:17:58] got to keep themselves attractive by
[1:17:59] God's grace you know they got to stay
[1:18:01] healthy and that might that might be a
[1:18:03] need for a sister too I guess that
[1:18:04] wasn't on the list but I guess out of
[1:18:06] those 1,000 interviews it wasn't a big
[1:18:08] deal for the
[1:18:09] Sisters I don't know sisters you take it
[1:18:11] up with him I don't know but one thing
[1:18:13] as a man I don't want to see myself go I
[1:18:16] don't want to get a pot belly I'll say
[1:18:18] it like that I don't want love handles
[1:18:21] by God's grace you know
[1:18:23] because I guess I've seen my uncles do
[1:18:25] that you know they've drunk themselves
[1:18:27] to really bad Health diabetes my grandpa
[1:18:31] ate himself uh too many White House
[1:18:33] cheeseburgers what they call White
[1:18:34] Castle cheeseburgers my grandpa ate too
[1:18:36] many White Castle cheeseburgers till he
[1:18:37] got diabetes you know and died
[1:18:40] prematurely so I don't I don't want that
[1:18:42] by God's
[1:18:43] grace but uh a husband needs an
[1:18:46] attractive spouse so she has to take
[1:18:47] care of herself make herself attractive
[1:18:50] and uh he needs domestic support so
[1:18:52] while he's mainly doing breadwinning he
[1:18:54] needs a wife to take care of the home by
[1:18:56] God's grace take care of the children
[1:18:58] Hallelujah now there's lots of
[1:19:00] scriptures and quotes of course for this
[1:19:02] lots of scriptures uh you know so when I
[1:19:04] taught the marriage banquet I went
[1:19:05] through all these but we're pretty I
[1:19:06] would say we're a mature church I don't
[1:19:08] think we need to read those but I think
[1:19:10] it's helpful just to hear Brother
[1:19:11] brandom on some of these how many could
[1:19:13] say Amen to that for me nobody can
[1:19:16] really say like brother
[1:19:17] brandom right like whoop boy you ought
[1:19:19] to be ashamed of yourself you ought to
[1:19:20] love your wife you know no
[1:19:23] nobody can say it like brother Ram can
[1:19:24] say it he said you ought to be ashamed
[1:19:26] of yourself man always keep the
[1:19:29] honeymoon alive like people just can't
[1:19:31] say it like brother BR these modern
[1:19:33] psychologists and stuff they
[1:19:36] can't now remember brother R says this
[1:19:39] the the the woman has these sacred
[1:19:41] things she has to keep she needs sacred
[1:19:44] virtue there's our sister virtue there
[1:19:46] she in other words remember virtue is
[1:19:48] strength in public like it's strength to
[1:19:50] obey and obey the word of God in public
[1:19:52] that's what virtue is is it strength to
[1:19:54] uphold your testimony so a woman has to
[1:19:56] have a sacred virtue about her she has
[1:19:59] to stand for the truth and you always do
[1:20:01] when you wear those holy clothes right
[1:20:04] let your long hair down or whatever it
[1:20:05] may be that's a sacred virtue you're not
[1:20:08] ashamed of the
[1:20:10] Gospel he said you must have a sacred
[1:20:12] Womanhood and that's of course all these
[1:20:14] things like we're talking about and then
[1:20:16] a sacred motherhood Hallelujah right
[1:20:19] because most worldly women they don't
[1:20:20] want uh they don't want the the busyness
[1:20:23] of having children right they don't want
[1:20:26] that you know I heard I heard a stat
[1:20:29] recently I kind of rejoiced and they
[1:20:31] said within maybe 10 or 20 years the
[1:20:33] conservatives are going to outnumber the
[1:20:36] Liberals because liberals just don't
[1:20:38] have children they just want to have two
[1:20:40] incomes
[1:20:42] retire but naturally if God terries now
[1:20:44] I shouldn't cross my I'm not crossing my
[1:20:45] fingers but if God terries you know
[1:20:49] conservatives will will will take over
[1:20:51] the number now that's
[1:20:53] on the sad part Muslims do that in many
[1:20:55] other countries they move into other
[1:20:57] countries and they multiply because all
[1:20:59] these other countries like Europe
[1:21:00] they're not having lots of children so
[1:21:02] they know they can take over if they
[1:21:04] just populate and grow in numbers right
[1:21:06] become citizens so that's their way of
[1:21:09] overcoming but I just think it's
[1:21:12] interesting uh that conservatives know
[1:21:14] the Bible they know children are a
[1:21:15] reward Hallelujah they know the Bible
[1:21:18] says that
[1:21:19] Hallelujah and then she's supposed to
[1:21:21] have this sacred duty to honor her
[1:21:24] husband got to honor him and remember
[1:21:26] many times honor is just what we say
[1:21:28] about the
[1:21:29] person I heard a preacher use this
[1:21:32] illustration and he talked to a man who
[1:21:34] he he celebrated their 75th wedding
[1:21:37] anniversary now this is kind of for the
[1:21:39] brothers but I guess it could work for
[1:21:40] the Sisters too and the preacher went up
[1:21:42] and said how did you do 75 years of
[1:21:44] marriage you guys coming up on one right
[1:21:46] pretty soon here I'm coming up on my
[1:21:49] okay I I feel bad was it the 22nd now
[1:21:52] yeah
[1:21:53] 22nd yeah I think it's 22nd wedding
[1:21:56] anniversary now or is it 23rd I gotta do
[1:21:59] my math after
[1:22:01] this uh it's 21st 20 21st
[1:22:05] no I feel bad
[1:22:07] now sorry honey I'll do the math
[1:22:11] later 21st that thank you
[1:22:15] honey I thought it was 21st but I felt
[1:22:18] like I I thought we already celebrated
[1:22:19] our
[1:22:21] 21st
[1:22:23] but the the man said he said how P he
[1:22:25] said he said young man how did you get
[1:22:27] to 75 years and he said he said at my
[1:22:30] 25th wedding anniversary I got a gift on
[1:22:33] my watch and the watch said the watch
[1:22:36] had the time but then it said say
[1:22:38] something good about Ruth or whatever
[1:22:40] his wife's name was so it had a digital
[1:22:43] clock on it but then it had say nice
[1:22:45] things about your wife and he said
[1:22:47] that's how I made it through these 75
[1:22:49] years that now of course we need more
[1:22:50] than that we need the Holy Ghost but I
[1:22:52] thought it was a good example of how
[1:22:54] words create an atmosphere right that
[1:22:56] creates honor the wife says good things
[1:22:58] about the husband right and the husband
[1:23:02] says good things about the wife right
[1:23:04] creating that atmosphere of respect
[1:23:07] Hallelujah so brother man tells us
[1:23:09] that's what we need the sacred
[1:23:11] attributes of a woman sacred sacred
[1:23:13] attributes of a man of course as
[1:23:15] well I was preaching the other night
[1:23:17] about women to obey their husband obey
[1:23:21] yes that went out of the marriage ritual
[1:23:23] a long time ago but they ain't going to
[1:23:25] do that no they live in America and they
[1:23:27] let you know so as well right how many
[1:23:30] women wear the pants in the family
[1:23:31] literally right and Also spiritually
[1:23:34] they wear the pants in the family he
[1:23:36] said they're not going to obey the women
[1:23:39] but as long as you don't do it you don't
[1:23:41] never try to call yourself a Christian
[1:23:43] brother brand says because you're not
[1:23:45] see how can a woman be a Christian how
[1:23:47] can she be Christlike if she's telling
[1:23:49] the man what to do she can't right she's
[1:23:52] supposed to submit to the
[1:23:53] man I don't care how much you dance and
[1:23:55] speak in tongues if you don't obey your
[1:23:57] husband you're out of the will of God
[1:23:59] now that's a statement right
[1:24:01] there Hallelujah see nobody can say it
[1:24:03] quite like brother
[1:24:05] Brandon Hallelujah did you know I looked
[1:24:07] up today now I use chat GTP I don't know
[1:24:09] how reliable that is but I looked it up
[1:24:12] and I said what was the divorce rate in
[1:24:14] 1950 you know what chat GTP said three
[1:24:18] out of a thousand marriages had divorces
[1:24:20] that's way less than 1% way less you
[1:24:23] know what the divorce rate is now it
[1:24:25] fluctuates between 40 and
[1:24:28] 50% so the divorce rate has increased
[1:24:31] between 40 and
[1:24:33] 50% in these 70 years isn't that amazing
[1:24:38] three out of a thousand were
[1:24:40] divorced right what and what brother R
[1:24:43] say 1956 was the year America had to
[1:24:47] have the Revival again and they turned
[1:24:48] it down and that was your Elvis Presley
[1:24:50] went big right again Satan using music
[1:24:53] and rock and roll right get into the
[1:24:55] homes get into the teenagers
[1:24:57] Minds ain't that
[1:24:59] something divorce has increased 40 to
[1:25:04] 50% because of sin right because of
[1:25:06] Dishonor and of course men being immoral
[1:25:08] too I'm I'm not I'm I'm saying both of
[1:25:10] them right just it's just crazy that's
[1:25:13] that's a fact it's crazy now 500 out of
[1:25:17] a thousand marriages brother brother
[1:25:19] Austin they got a they got a coin flip
[1:25:21] 50% chance is going to last or not can
[1:25:23] you imagine and yet they go to the Altar
[1:25:25] and say I promise I'm going to marry you
[1:25:27] till death and they break their promises
[1:25:29] so easily they just flip a coin well is
[1:25:30] this going to work or
[1:25:33] not right I think a I heard a preacher
[1:25:36] say this
[1:25:36] too he said uh you know couples when
[1:25:39] they get married they have trouble and
[1:25:40] they then they say I wonder if you're
[1:25:42] the right one I wonder if I married the
[1:25:45] right one but God's word tells you if
[1:25:47] you got married that person's the right
[1:25:50] one
[1:25:51] Hallelujah right
[1:25:53] the very fact you got married and went
[1:25:54] through the courtship process and and
[1:25:57] and gave the vows that proves that was
[1:25:59] the right one what God has joined
[1:26:01] together let not man put us under
[1:26:03] Hallelujah right in other words if God
[1:26:06] allowed you to marry that person that
[1:26:07] person is the right one for you
[1:26:10] Hallelujah at least for this Earthly
[1:26:12] Journey brother ra said if you got the
[1:26:13] wrong one here you'll get the right one
[1:26:15] there I can't explain that I don't know
[1:26:17] how that works Hallelujah but at least
[1:26:20] for this Earthly Journey God ordered our
[1:26:23] steps amen God knew God knew all the
[1:26:26] events of our life God allowed all these
[1:26:28] events of Our Lives we got to trust God
[1:26:31] hallelujah God hates divorce
[1:26:37] amen my brother talks about how some
[1:26:39] sisters disrespect he said don't it make
[1:26:41] you feel kind of bad when men start
[1:26:43] talking and women come up and butt right
[1:26:45] in and being kind of rude now that
[1:26:47] doesn't happen among us but just you see
[1:26:49] it out there in the world right I have
[1:26:51] pretty respectful
[1:26:52] uh uh co-workers I can't say that's
[1:26:55] happened to me too many times maybe a
[1:26:56] couple times but not too much by God's
[1:26:58] grace I got a pretty good work work
[1:27:01] environment but here's a woman says I'm
[1:27:03] a Christian but my husband persecutes me
[1:27:05] in every way uh what should I do now
[1:27:09] listen you're supposed to obey your
[1:27:10] husband that's the word but if he tells
[1:27:11] you and refuses you to read your Bible
[1:27:14] and go to church something like that you
[1:27:15] don't have to obey that because he that
[1:27:17] won't forsake his father husband or wife
[1:27:19] is not worthy of Me Jesus says so here's
[1:27:23] the balance of it right if a man's being
[1:27:25] abusive or something like that or
[1:27:26] telling a woman uh to obey or disobey
[1:27:29] the word of God she don't have to obey
[1:27:30] that right so we just I want you to know
[1:27:32] see brother man balanced it out right
[1:27:35] God never wants anybody to be hurt or
[1:27:37] abused right God never wants
[1:27:43] that now I like here brother Ram says uh
[1:27:46] see that the women reverence her husband
[1:27:49] uh he says then a husband ought to live
[1:27:51] such a life before his wife that his
[1:27:53] wife could reverence him as a Son of God
[1:27:56] if he doesn't live that kind of life
[1:27:57] well then of course she wouldn't
[1:27:58] reverence him because she knows what
[1:28:00] he's made of but when it is a man that
[1:28:03] is a reverent man reverent clean there's
[1:28:04] my hour with his wife before his family
[1:28:07] a real servant of God then the woman
[1:28:08] children all should respect that servant
[1:28:10] of God with reverence amen I think a
[1:28:13] good example is Abigail from the Bible
[1:28:16] right remember uh her husband was a
[1:28:18] foolish man nabal I think his name means
[1:28:20] foolish if I'm not mistaken or something
[1:28:22] like that what was
[1:28:25] it what was it snore that's what his
[1:28:29] name means no Kidd she's been doing some
[1:28:31] research on the Old Testament I
[1:28:33] appreciate that there's probably some
[1:28:34] other meanings too by God's grace yeah
[1:28:38] uh because I think even Abigail says
[1:28:39] he's a foolish man he's a foolish man
[1:28:41] he's a foolish
[1:28:42] man um but I think she's a great example
[1:28:45] my husband's a foolish man but she but
[1:28:48] when she saw David there she kept David
[1:28:50] from sinning right and when she saw the
[1:28:52] man of God remember she took meat she
[1:28:55] took cheeses she took bread wine and oil
[1:28:58] amen she took all these things out to
[1:29:00] the man of God hallelujah and then God
[1:29:02] blessed her and made him her
[1:29:04] husband right in other words God saw the
[1:29:07] plight of this woman right and God saw
[1:29:09] her real worship for God and God
[1:29:12] eventually L her out of this and got her
[1:29:14] into a better marriage that's something
[1:29:17] but he wasn't living a clean he wasn't a
[1:29:19] a very respectful man but she still
[1:29:20] respected him to a degree
[1:29:23] right and she still honored God's men
[1:29:25] Hallelujah she still honored David a man
[1:29:28] after God's Own Heart oh it's a
[1:29:30] beautiful
[1:29:31] scripture now brother Ram said uh Adam
[1:29:34] you shall rule over Eve right not to be
[1:29:37] a boss but to be a helpmate part of you
[1:29:39] she's sweet she's kind she's tender you
[1:29:42] should lead her around sweetly because
[1:29:44] she's part of you you go to mistreating
[1:29:45] her then you're mistreating yourself and
[1:29:47] a man mentally right won't do that okay
[1:29:50] so again brother B is showing how how
[1:29:52] the man must treat the woman in other
[1:29:53] words there's mutual
[1:30:00] respect so I I share this one because
[1:30:03] sister M went on brother brandham with
[1:30:06] hunting trip so that's that's the
[1:30:08] recreational
[1:30:09] companionship and church he even did it
[1:30:11] on their
[1:30:14] honeymoon that's just
[1:30:16] funny brother raham said A Woman's Place
[1:30:18] is a is a man's Queen at home
[1:30:23] he says outside of that she has nothing
[1:30:25] and we know that to be the truth I find
[1:30:27] that sound I know that sounds
[1:30:28] oldfashioned but I'm responsible I know
[1:30:30] that after my going away from this Earth
[1:30:32] them tapes and them books will be living
[1:30:34] on and many of you young children will
[1:30:36] find the days to come that's exactly the
[1:30:37] truth because I speak it in the name of
[1:30:39] the Lord now see that's what the that's
[1:30:40] what the society's trying to do right
[1:30:42] get women out of the home so they don't
[1:30:44] raise their children right they they
[1:30:46] don't spend time with their husbands and
[1:30:48] what does it produce all these
[1:30:50] divorces right
[1:30:55] brother BR says she's got uh no business
[1:30:57] in a defense plan A Woman's Place is at
[1:31:00] her home with her children now if her
[1:31:02] husband's sick and she has to work
[1:31:03] that's different but a woman's place is
[1:31:04] at home in the kitchen and when she
[1:31:07] leaves that she's out of her place let's
[1:31:09] go to uh Titus Chapter 2 where we can
[1:31:11] see that plainly Lydia brought that up
[1:31:12] to me that was a help Lydia by God's
[1:31:15] grace I need to yeah I need to close
[1:31:17] here while I kind of lost track of
[1:31:20] time having such a good time I lost
[1:31:22] track of time here Titus Chapter
[1:31:30] 2 after
[1:31:32] Timothy
[1:31:36] Titus verse three the aged women
[1:31:40] likewise that they been Behavior has
[1:31:41] becometh Holiness not false accusers not
[1:31:43] given to much wine teachers of good
[1:31:47] things that they may teach the young
[1:31:49] women to be sober to love their husbands
[1:31:52] and to love their children so see how
[1:31:54] important it is for the Sisters to teach
[1:31:56] their children the right way to love
[1:31:58] their husbands to love their families to
[1:32:00] be discreet Chase keepers at homes
[1:32:02] that's why brother Ram mentions them
[1:32:04] about being
[1:32:05] home good obedient to their own husbands
[1:32:09] that the word of God be not
[1:32:11] blasphemed so look at the Christian
[1:32:14] character of this godly woman I'll say
[1:32:15] like this here's a new testament
[1:32:17] Proverbs 31 Woman and the church said
[1:32:21] amen look what she does she loves her
[1:32:23] children loves her husband keeps the
[1:32:25] home
[1:32:27] Hallelujah that the word of God be not
[1:32:32] blasphemed Hallelujah and like Lydia was
[1:32:35] telling me you know I as remember on
[1:32:37] Sunday nights asked the children you
[1:32:38] know what did you get out of the message
[1:32:39] you know and Lydia shared you know well
[1:32:42] I was I enjoyed how uh we're reminded
[1:32:44] that sisters golly Christian sisters are
[1:32:46] like cornerstones and Lydia correct me
[1:32:48] if I'm wrong here and Lydia's like well
[1:32:51] how you know uh I think this is what she
[1:32:53] was trying to say how can uh sisters in
[1:32:55] the message be cornerstones if they're
[1:32:57] out trying to date or if they're out
[1:32:59] trying to uh wear paint and wear sexy
[1:33:02] clothes they're supposed to have the
[1:33:04] character the P character of Titus
[1:33:06] Chapter 2 amen this is what our sisters
[1:33:09] should strive to be right here praise
[1:33:11] God not a painted up uh uh flirt at a
[1:33:15] youth banquet like we got today running
[1:33:18] around here Lord have mercy God help us
[1:33:22] ah Hallelujah I know he'll help our
[1:33:23] church by God's grace in other words if
[1:33:25] people want help they can be helped by
[1:33:26] God's
[1:33:28] grace see there's nothing that God could
[1:33:30] give a man outside of Salvation that's
[1:33:32] better than a nice wife and Austin and
[1:33:36] brother Jesse said
[1:33:38] amen there's no person that can a person
[1:33:41] when they're tired they won't confide in
[1:33:44] anyone like they do their own wife
[1:33:46] that's true I can't talk to anybody like
[1:33:47] I can talk to my wife what a fortunate
[1:33:50] thing you brothers are when you've got a
[1:33:52] nice little wife that's clean and
[1:33:53] upright and moral and you can come in
[1:33:55] when you're tired and weary sit down and
[1:33:57] she can talk to you she can do do more
[1:33:59] with you than anybody else that's right
[1:34:01] she's a jewel she's a
[1:34:03] queen amen she was you know God the
[1:34:07] greatest thing God gave man outside of
[1:34:09] Salvation was a wife she was to comfort
[1:34:11] him to help him to bless him to console
[1:34:13] him and be a real companion to
[1:34:17] him they asked brother brandom should a
[1:34:19] saved wife refuse herself to her husband
[1:34:21] if she's a sinner this is the man's
[1:34:22] physical need no sir that's your husband
[1:34:25] you'll drive him farther away from God
[1:34:26] than ever by doing that that's right see
[1:34:28] you're married to him he's yours and
[1:34:31] you're his that's the intimacy part

[1:34:34] Parlor and the bedroom right we talked
