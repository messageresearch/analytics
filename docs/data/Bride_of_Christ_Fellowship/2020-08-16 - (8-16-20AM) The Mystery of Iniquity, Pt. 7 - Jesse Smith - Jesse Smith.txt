and we know you're the only preacher so help us lord us we pull upon you and receive from you today and we'll give you thanks and give you praise we're happy to be in your house today happy to sing your praises in jesus christ's name the church said amen praise god let's stand and take our bibles here today let's go to matthew chapter 24. 11 we'll read our text here um and then we'll do our memory verse as well by god's grace which wonderful songs brother this wonderful song thank god our god reigns praise god matthew 24 11-13 then we'll do our memory verse i'll just read this myself here um 24 11 down actually down to 14. now listen to this iniquity we'll look at mystery of iniquity part 7 again this morning listen to jesus talk about iniquity now remember brother brahm said the six seals are in matthew 24. how many remember that the six seals are in here and of course then jesus drops in uh he hides it or at least you know either the author wrote it in a way to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prove it because there's no real order amongst all these verses but he drops in the revelations about the rapture praise god but look at verse 11 to 14. i'll read this and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now let me just stop and say if you don't feel love in our church something's wrong with us right because we believe we're one of the few how many believe you're one of the few amen almost every church jesus said if you there be that find it almost every church is lacking love but if we're a real church we should feel the love of god in our in our in our fellowship amen because he said one way you'll know my disciples is their love one for another but it's going to be cold everybody else is going to be cold like ice but we're going to be hot with love praise god verse 13. but he that shall endure see you're hot you're hot but you got to endure all this coldness everyone else is cold but you're hot he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved verse 14 and this gospel the good news of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world that's gentile right this is a gentile ministry for a witness unto all nations or all gentiles and then shall the end come we'll have to make sure we pray that god opens up these countries again that we can go preach the gospel brother simon brother craig and different ones but adjacent to mars can go preach the gospel because after that then the end comes once it's preached to every nation praise god that'll be our text let's go to matthew 6 though for our memory verse it's good to see all the saints in the house of lord today i'll try to be careful uh on my time here looking forward to wendy's testimony this morning praise god and then uh karen's this evening so looking forward to those let's read matthew 6 30 down to 34. aren't you glad church that you can seek first the kingdom of god amen oh my we used to seek all these other things amen i wake up and i'd go right to chewing tobacco i'd wake up and go right to the movies and sports right now i can go right to jesus christ amen i seek the kingdom of god purify my heart rule my heart take authority over my life that's what we can do today by god's grace matthew 6 verse 30. let's read 30 down to 34. on 3 1 2 3 wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall not he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may god add his blessings to the ring of his word you may be seated praise god all right praise god i don't have any slides or anything right now so we'll just preach out of these notes by the grace of god i don't know if you saw it this week let me set my timer here um how there was a peace deal with israel i don't know if you saw that um i believe that's a uh a prefigure uh to the seven year uh covenant between the pope and israel i believe it's just a pre-figure just like covet is a pre-figure to all right it's the beginning of sorrows it's something that grips the whole world well the whole world had to witness this week that uh even israel's worst enemies can make a covenant with them now we don't know what's happening behind the scenes there might be money i imagine that's what it is because the love of money uh is the root of all evil not that that's evil that's peace but to get an evil country that worships allah to get them to go to peace i would think you'd have to pay him off or something but just interesting uh to note that and lord willing in the future when we get to uh these other series uh i'm gonna preach my uh different i have a different revelation or different understanding of daniel's 70 weeks i believe they will make a seven year covenant i used to think there was only three and a half years left i know there's quotes on that but there's also a quote that brother bam says there's seven years left so brother graham paul taught both i used to think there was only three and a half left i actually now believe there's seven weeks or seven years left i believe that now after studying it and examining the scripture and history um but either way remember church doesn't matter right because we'll be gone amen doesn't really matter amen now people want to fight and argue and name call and blaspheme each other that's evil so if you disagree just do it in love praise god that's the one thing because if you got really jesus christ then you will love your enemies you'll love people your friends that you disagree with if you really have the holy spirit praise god and just so you know i did email brother joseph branham yesterday so it took me four months to email him so i apologize to him over and over for that i finally got back to myself god's great worked on that yesterday for the debate in september so we're just trying to press on in the name of mr the bible says all nations shall come against israel uh when the covenant is broken remember that that's in zechariah 12 it's zechariah 13. it's also in daniel 11. all nations so they're going to begin after the rapture there's going to be with israel and the world they're going to say peace and safety and they're going to miss your agreement but in the midst of the year they're going to break the covenant right so they're all going to have peace israel is going to have peace with everybody for uh three and a half years and they'll be sacrificing animals they'll have their temple again by the rams said it's the lord revelation 11 says thus saith the lord they're going to rebuild that temple so we're church we are seeing pre-figures of the end times all right we are singing seeing the the ending of song pre-figures to uh a covenant between israel and their enemies and so we are uh we're privileged to live at this time remember church you didn't decide to come at this time god sent you here at this time we might have picked other times to live i mean my daughter haven talks about all the time how she would like to sit on jesus's lap she wanted to be one of those children that would run up and i agree i would like to do that too you know uh but one thing we'll run into his arms and we cross over we know that he'll wipe away the bible said he'll wipe away all the tears from our eyes but you know god chose and god ordained we're alive in this hour so we can be overcomers in this hour but ram said we have nothing to fear in this hour if god protected the saints in every age heading down no matter what tribulation their face god will protect us by his grace so let's all let's cast out all fear by faith praise god amen now uh let's look here i think that's it as far as updates also uh saying wendy i have those packets here but i have stuff to type out all the directions i'm not quite sure so i had i have everybody anybody want to send out letters to the message churches and so i got two people that want to that's wonderful um but i don't know how to divide it up like i don't know if i'll have like you do a through m like all the states a through all and find all the message churches in alaska down to minnesota and then you'll do new mexico down to i don't know what the last state would be in the alphabet but uh i haven't decided that but i have all the stamps i have the letters i have the envelopes i have the return labels so i just need help with uh writing out the the addresses on the front of the envelope so i really feel burdened to do that uh to to share our youtube videos and to share our uh our book you know our modesty book by the grace of god uh because it's helped so many people i got another email this week i always help people i saw on uh i saw on amazon there's numerous more comments there are 16 reviews in my book and they're all five stars so jesus is the five-star general so i thought take pride somebody to go put a one on one star on there today or tomorrow but that's okay i know in jesus's book i believe it's a five star because i believe he wrote it by god's grace he is an inspiration behind it well let's look today now i want to start here i got uh 34 more minutes so i'll lay this in here we had a great time on wednesday if you needed a chance to watch that that was a wonderful service in the lord uh just all the iniquity so on wednesday we saw all now there were 73 sins listed now some of them were overlapped some of them were mentioned as repeats there were 73 sins that would either keep people out of heaven or at least keep them out of the ruling class of the bride and we know that the bible says there were some that will will not enter the city there are some that will enter the city some that will live in the city some will bring their glory and honor to the city so not all people will live in that new jerusalem there is a special class of people and it's by grace praise god they let grace that class lets grace labor in them more abundantly than others others will serve more by grace than others it's just it's their choice it's up to them it's not that god favors them or loves them more god gives everybody the chance to labor but it's the individual's choice how much will they let grace labor in their lives amen praise god because paul said it was the grace that was with me help me labor more than peter more than james more than john uh more than thomas thomas was a great laborer he doubted at the beginning all of us would have doubted all right but thomas was a great labor he took the gospel to asia and did a tremendous ministry but paul labored more abundantly than them all praise god so if you didn't see that i think that'd be a blessing to you to see how the blood of christ washes all of those iniquities away from us now remember of iniquity abounds at the end time we saw it jesus christ says genuine love will be hard to find at the end time he also said genuine faith will be hard to find right because he talked about the widow woman that would knock so listen church see if we have real love it'll cause us to keep praying for our loved ones amen it'll cause us to keep praying that god will save souls and help us to love each other and help us to fulfill real christian lives praise god genuine love and genuine prayers are going to be hard to find they're going to be rare but by god's grace uh if we have zealous repentance the message to the laodicean church age is be zealous and repent he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten amen so it is god's love that corrects us and causes us to do hot works for him and minister and serve in the age when iniquity is at its greatest amount there's never been an age of iniquity like this age uh paul says it in second timothy 3 13 evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived isn't that something those that are deceived are deceiving others by uh but see america's churches though work the worse iniquity because america is the beast out of the land and the and out of the beast out of the land flows the mark of the beast right so america's churches will be the most churches filled with iniquity uh hopefully i'm saying that right here now the future union of the government uh of and the americas churches in america's government will issue the official mark of the beast and that will be a leash upon the whole world right now let's go to ezekiel just if you got your bible just just flipping through your scriptures here now look here just look how ezekiel remember he was the prophet to israel while they were out of babylon remember church at the same time ezekiel and jeremiah were ministering at the same time i know that goes against where what you know brother brahm says there's never two prophets at the same time but sometimes there are remember moses and elijah in the tribulation there's going to be two prophets there at the same time sometimes there are okay but some people will take those quotes and they'll just they'll go they'll go to seed on them like they'll make those fighting words yet brother brahm teaches us he said take everything back to the word amen so we've got to be humble enough to accept the revelation of god's word so as ezekiel ministered to the the exiled in babylon he says this in verse 49 notice they have the same laodicean conditions that we have today look at verse 49 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and her daughters remember sodom was samaria right and then israel was the other was her sister i forget the name of the other one but look what what what's their sin their sin is they're so prideful they have all kinds of bread they have and they're idle their abundance in idleness they're not working the works of god was in her and her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor needy look at verse 250 and they're haughty and committed abominations therefore i took them away as i saw good so look at this israel was in the same conditions laodicea was rich increase with goods have need of nothing and lukewarm works see not working not letting their faith work by love amen i'll tell you right here this is a labor of love right here church you got to have love to reach out to people that you don't know and uh you don't maybe have turned you down before maybe write you off with just some renegade message church or something like that a renegade message preacher you got to have love right you you want to reach out praise god and i said that before too if you want to send letters i'll send letters to your family you just let me know how many i can print and how many books you want to send i'll send them to your family i sent them to my mother's side a few years ago see their works were were lukewarm and it was because they had so much money and they had so much bread they let pride and and and money take them away from god in other words they said we don't need god anymore i'll say like this god whatever god wants whatever is going to keep me close to god he i'll allow him to do it in my life if that means the finances are tight for a few months or years or if that means uh you know something awful might happen then so be it but lord keep me near the cross help me to trust in you and not in man amen help me to trust in god and not my bank account praise god and not the amount of food that i have in my refrigerator or freezer help me not to trust in that but help me to want more of god amen hallelujah i believe that's what you desire see that's exactly like uh the laodicean age now see they got now this in church israel got spewed out of the land the churches get spewed out of his mouth right the bible said he'll spew my land so jesus they make him sick to his stomach remember the bible said the tables are full of vomit they're communion tables when we have communion here ours are holy we believe but the denominations are full of vomit because it makes god disgusted that he gives them all these blessings but they don't do his works they forget about him oh god help us not to forget help us to remember the promises of god amen help us to remember to work for the lord hallelujah hungry and thirsty for more divine righteousness while we're busy working for the kingdom of god let that be my story let that be my song amen i'm always hungry for more of god and i'm busy working for him praise god amen now let's look at the trail of the serpent here because i i just put that section in there because in the in the book now i just go through the trail of the serpent i preach this back in i'll find the date i actually preached it i remember jose was here i remember that night we had a good time in the lord that was july 5th 2017. so i'm not going to preach the whole thing i'm just going to read some quotes now there are six quotes on the trail of the serpent so remember now through iniquity iniquity means transgression it's a purposeful transgression in other words you're going against you're breaking god's word on purpose okay you know better but you're breaking it on purpose and there are six quotes on uh the workers of iniquity so we showed you how nick when he started in heaven come down to earth we showed you how it filled uh uh you know the serpent you know with satan and then cane seedline and how it starts in people's minds and uh the specific worker the works of iniquity in the workers of iniquity and then in this case now i go i just i just go a brief uh search of the bible in history showing the trail of the serpent now this phrase is actually from clarence larkin how many knew that did we know that brother ram didn't originate that that's clarence larkin claire's larkin has a chart and he shows a trail of the serpent from heaven uh down to gaga magog right uh uh yeah mega mega that's where satan gets cast into the lake of some beautiful charts but that's where brother ram got the trail of the serpent from now here let's read the quotes the first quote is from october 31st halloween 65 he said now don't forget this little flock the church in the last days is going to be twins so close it'll deceive the elected matthew 24 24 the church is going to it's a pentecostal move yeah look at that church so the true church and the false church are going to have the holy spirit anointing and it's going to look like a move it's so much like the real thing to deceive the very elect if it were possible i want to explain what how the election comes see it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers that's all same mother same church same movement same thing the betting ground is the same where the word falls but one of them like here is perverted oh church that's why please let's come to church every service and let's ask god to help us examine our ground and make sure there's no weeds in our ground let's do everything we can because he said one ground is right and one is perverted oh but the thing to do the blessing that we have is while we're alive we can make sure our ground is true and our ground is pure soil praise god that's what every service is for amen that's what every day is for amen to examine ourselves to make sure we have really pure grounds pure hearts we'd say i said see one of them is perversion one of them is the wrong father which i'll someday prove if god will let me that denomination is the mark of the beast see it's the wrong father he served people to an organization instead of the word see it's the wrong father it's a cane move oh my this is still the first quote when i go home i'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast the beginning and the beast at the end and trail him right through the bible and show how he heads up the bible is going to show the beast satan at the beginning and the beast at the end the antichrist right and then gog and magog now that ends at the armageddon right that ends antichrist dies at armageddon but then the beast continues in satan for a thousand years he's he's locked up by chains of circumstance and the bottomless pit but then that beast rises again i'm talking about satan the beast he says now just watch how cunning this fellow is how he's just exactly well they're just like judas and jesus here both brothers in their tribe like esau and jacob like the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin it's this great warfare we're in ah mercy church we are we're in a warfare and we're fighting against our twin so there in other words there's churches that preach just like us almost there's preachers that churches that sing just like us there's churches that have testimonies very similar to ours and it's so close but yet we've got a battle off the perversion of the hearts and their works will work iniquity in other words they'll purposely keep the defying the word of god but our works will be righteousness and godliness in this present world they'll be so close he says the enemy uses deception like he did to eve oh as god said and that's the first quote second quote november 27 trying to got a service he said now i'm talking to smart men he said they might look at my illiteracy illiteracy but believe i'm telling you the truth it's god telling you the truth see he said now when i speak of denominations i'm not meaning you to be so cruel and i don't mean for you not to go to your church go to your church what you're supposed to do but just don't join up with them organizations because one day i'll be telling you and prove it to you by scripture it's the mark of the beast and just remember it's the mark i'm preaching he said i wouldn't preach in brother jack's church he had to tell me go ahead and do it but i'm going to the tabernacle it'd be about four it'll be about four hours long he says and my subject is the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of the serpent see takes about four hours i got my scriptures all laying out the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden he's the beast at the end and show that he's a religious person and the denomination that made the denomination and come right through the trail of it and prove it to you by the scriptures that it is i don't know that till the holy spirit give it to me the other day up there so he's studying somewhere up there probably on a mountain and god showed him the beast in the beginning is the same beast at the end third quote is the from the evening service that same day he said to you up in new york and you that are around in ohio different places soon i want to preach this message of the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end at the tabernacle they said it's going to be four hours long fourth quote is december 6 1965. he says now what somebody else says but what god has promised and what god does proves that it's god doing his own interpreting of his word he says you mothers fathers when they were genuine pentecostals come out of organization and curse the thing and walked out of it then like a dog to its vomit there's that vomit again went right back to it again done the same thing that killed that church you killed your own by the same thing nothing against the people in there nothing against it it's the systems of the thing that's doing it he said i don't preach this in another man's meeting i'm going to preach the trail of the serpent and listen to it if you take the tapes and notice they miss seeing the confirmation of the prophecies of god's word being fulfilled amen oh the denominations miss the prophecies that are going to be fulfilled in this day praise god they miss luke 17 30 where the son of man is revealed at the coming of the lord in the days of light and as the days of sodom so shall it be in the end times they miss that they miss a seventh angel receiving an open book from heaven and then finishing the mystery of god and then john taking it around the world they miss that they miss elijah coming to restore all things but we receive it amen hallelujah they miss it they reject it how can they deny it the bible says over and over again elijah prepares that's john the baptist elijah prepares in isaiah 40 and matthew 3 but then there's another elijah elijah restores amen hallelujah he restores he reinstates the kingdom of god that's been rejected by laodicea see church what is it what does it all come down to the word what did brother brown say the last showdown is between the denominations and the word hallelujah we got the word that's one thing we got praise god we might not own any property we might not have uh big events and things like that but one thing we got one thing i know we got is the word amen we are the saith the lord we have the word amen that's one thing i know i got praise god i don't have i can't i don't have i don't have a former relationship with william branham i don't have uh any ties to any organization all i got is the holy ghost praise god that's all i got and the holy ghost guides me into the truth of god's word amen and you can tell if it is if i live the right kind of life because paul said i was reading i was listening to philippians 3 we'll get to that maybe lord willing tonight or later but he says everything you see and hear me do you do it how can you tell paul of the holy ghost well because he lived it and then he said you follow me you do what i do amen my that's really something the fifth quote i'm going to just go through these quickly but ram said uh the methodist uh don't because it wasn't associated with her organization she didn't want to hear it speaking of his message if that ain't a pharisee i never seen one wait to hear the trail of the serpent see now think that the denomination is the only one that registers with god god won't hear you unless you're a methodist or a baptist or trinidaire and he said that's wrong he said that's my purpose he says a p a desire in people's minds and heart to be right so he was going to preach this to show that the desires in the people's hearts they wanted to be right so if he showed the devil at the beginning and all the way down the people could recognize the devil right and they could make their hearts right and they could be in the truth i know it's simple and last quote was uh leadership is no communion was the last one this is the second the last sermon he ever preached leadership 65 december 7th he says now the next thing he's talking about lazarus the beggar the next thing he goes on successful like the like the churches today are getting so lazarus and the rich young ruler uh growing up a businessman sitting here telling me right in california that the church has to tell the labor union what to do see it's coming church and state again it's right on you you see you're right in there and you take the mark of the beast not knowing it if you ever bought one of my tapes get this and when i get it when i get home the trail of the serpent and you'll see where it's at see where this ends up now okay so can everybody see it the church so the the the trail of the serpent is all about the church and state uniting right because that's the beast now with the same power to kill that he had under all those other uh gentile kingdoms right babylon medes of persians uh greece rome right ancient rome but now it's modern rome it's spiritual rome it's the unholy roman catholic church all right so that roman this roman system at the end time is going to get the same power right that they had in ancient rome and that's thus saith the lord you believe that now let's go through some examples here so satan closely observes and imitates the true believer's behavior in order to deceive the masses satan is producing a spiritual twin that is so much like you and i but yet so far away is that right it's so close but then it's so far away because they don't have the seal of god in their souls jesus gives two proofs on the battle of the twins this is a battle twins have been battling ever since the beginning we start with the wheat and tares in matthew 13. tares are poisonous to eat and they look like a wee except the only thing they don't do they do not bow at harvest time so will no tares because they defy and hate the word of god amen and they will the tares will be right along the wheat right they'll be right there by the wheat blowing in the wind right and they'll be hanging around until uh they're gathered together remember the tariffs have to be bumbled together right they got that's what they're doing now they're bundling in their groups together but the the wheat have to sit there and bow in the presence of the sun praise god but church they hate remember jesus said in matthew i'm sorry john chapter 3 for god so loved the world he said the reason people are condemned is because they loved darkness and hated the light praise god oh we we must rejoice in the light of god's word amen let's hate our sin amen let's not hate others let's hate our sin praise god a real christian should be very plain to see that they don't so much hate other people they hate the sin they hate their flesh desires that overcome them at times like paul said that what i hate that's what i do watch where people's hate is directed that tells which of the twins they are so they defy the word they fail to obey god's simple plain word because their hearts are perverted it's a different kind of ground it's not a true ground and then in matthew 24 24 we can almost say that by heart right for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elected the false christs are temporarily anointed with the holy spirit but then they teach heresy later on and they go into iniquity which is sin loving lives now paul says in first corinthians 11 19 can you pull that up there kaisha first corinthians 11 19. you know some people get discouraged brother jesse you know or brother simon or brother brooks why there are so many uh why is there so much division in the message it has to be that way listen we should expect that praise god because there has to be twins there's always been twins so don't get discouraged if you hear about people falling away or heresy be concerned that we are keeping god's word praise god because first corinthians 11 19 said there there must also be heresies among you don't be discouraged when someone rises up like like happened last year where someone tries to bring a heresy in our church it's going to happen among you among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you amen so doctrinal battles have to come so we know which side the twins are on amen and that we can get on the right side praise god it's going to be among you praise god it's going to be among us so what do we do just keep preaching the truth service after service just keep your shoulder to the wheel just keep that yoke of the holy spirit just keep pushing with the truth keep pushing the truth don't try to make it some sensational thing it is sensational to the soul praise god it is sensational to the real believer but don't get outside the word and don't teach a heresy just say right with a plain simple word it will keep revealing itself amen that's in the philippians 3 we'll get to that maybe tonight paul said even if you don't have it now god will reveal it to you amen paul said if you don't have whatever revelation you're going to need it's going to come amen it's going to come praise god like the former latter reign all these things we're looking for you know the daniel 70 weeks all these things maybe we might may not understand right away but if we keep saying faithful god will reveal more truth and it'll be exactly what we need we just can't get laodicean right we can't be lukewarm because that's what that's what is real that's whatever that's what that's what they're doing that that's they're spew they don't speak for god anymore i'm glad i just had somebody email me another person this week two people saying oh i love your sermons i'm really growing can you send me scriptures and quotes just all around the world church see people and people said i needed that i've been hungry for that i just wanted to hear truth so see church we might be small but we're having a bigger impact than maybe we thought praise god people around the world want to hear truth so god made a way that they can hear it praise god amen it's a different age praise god it's knowledge is increased daniel 12 4 says see only the elect children of god will not be deceived about 10 minutes watch that serpent slither from heaven he slithered from heaven down to the garden the first set of twins were lucifer and michael both exalted both worshipped until satan split the church and then on earth the first set of twins was the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and good and evil both twins brother ram said christ was the tree of life so that means the tree of knowledge had to be satan who is the next set now this is my thought this could be wrong my the next set of twins was when those two moved to flesh adam and the serpent because eve had to choose which one is she gonna do which one is she gonna do there's twins there well my husband said this but the serpent said this remember god said later because you've done this now your desire will be for your husband so she had two choices there now that's my thought i could be wrong on that next we know the twins obviously cain and abel right both worshipping one got jealous and killed the other the next set of twins is ham and shem right because ham gets cursed something with his father's nakedness i don't know if he like laughed his dad naked after he got drunk or if he saw if his father's nakedness was his mother's nakedness i'm not sure what i'm not sure which one it is did he sleep with his mom i'm not sure because that's that that that phrase can mean sleeping with someone's uncovering their nakedness can be another word for adultery another phrase for adultery so i'm not sure exactly what ham did but whenever he did he was cursed with the nakedness but shem out of shem came the father of the faith abraham praise god amen out of the twins came forth both sets out out of abraham then came the twins again esau and jacob esau profanes god by not wanting the firstborn rights he didn't want to be a spiritual leader may god help our brothers to step up and be spiritual leaders if you haven't already may god help our brothers to be leaders amen and take responsibility not let somebody else do it but brothers do it praise god take because esau didn't want that he didn't want to be the head of the the religious aspect he just wanted to go off and hunt and marry a wife and of course he did but he the bible said he forsook he profaned god but jacob's like yeah i'll do anything to be in that in that messiah family that's what we should say i'll do anything to go in the rapture praise god now we don't want to sin of course and god won't lead us into sin but we should be willing to lay down any weight of sin that death but easily beset us and run the race for christ and then moses battled he had a bunch of twins things he had a bunch of twins he had janice is doing supernatural right balaam cora and jason brother bam says get a lot of twins to battle off there balaam proved he was a terror when he taught israel to commit fornication and he went against the perfect will of god god said don't go he said he said oh come on could i go god said go like brother man i said i he brother man doesn't doubt god told women to preach the gospel he said but that wasn't the first word that god told her if a woman says god called me to preach say okay amen but that wasn't the first thing god told you amen praise god amen brother said it's god will give you your heart's desire let's make sure our hearts are pure praise god he's going to give you hearts desire whatever you want let's make sure we what god wants amen let's make sure we're modern day david's the bride after the heart of our husband jesus i feel like preaching today praise god hallelujah he lured 24 000 into committing sexual sin proved he was a terror aiken he showed his tare nature by lustfully harboring forbidden treasures while trying to dwell amongst the victorious army see they were just happy getting the victory but he's like well i gotta physically gain more than them i deserve more than them i deserve nicer clothes now look at that church i deserve nicer clothes i deserve more gold and yeah we're all getting the victory you guys enjoy the victory i'm gonna enjoy the financial things that's a terror then the serpent slithered into my kaya's time 897 bc i couldn't find i was trying to think of who was you know david and solomon i couldn't really think of many but micaiah surely had twins he had 400 twins the man said there were 400 hebrew prophets are you with me church anointed with the lying spirit and what he had to do what do you have to say he said all i can do is say what the previous prophet elijah said he had to stay with the word and look that foolish virgin there jehoshaphat what he felt something a little off thank god thank god church that even someone who won't go all the way they can still have a little bit of sensitive sensitivity to the holy spirit oh something just doesn't seem right here some this is there anybody else that would preach anybody else because these these 400 preachers don't they just don't feel right they god amen now look at 400 years later around 598 hananiah was the twin to jeremiah hannah and i was way more hollywood evangelism he remember he made that uh he made that wooden uh he made that wooden uh was it yoke right he made a wooden yoke he said thus saith the lord israel will come back out of babylon in two years and jeremiah took that thing and thrown it down he said it'll be 70. hallelujah glory twins both of them saying look look at me look at me and jeremiah said that's fine you can prophesy whatever you want he said but god will prove who was right and han and i had died that same year look at that twins both men prophesying both men but who was more dramatic and more hollywood it was that that was that tear seed right the tears more dramatic and more hollywood and prophesying but off the word so that was 400 years later that takes us about 600 bc and then where was satan satan rose up against joshua the high priest when they were rebuilding the uh the wall in jerusalem with nehemiah remember zechariah 3 verse 1 joshua had a vision where zechariah had a vision he shared with joshua and joshua the high priest is standing there and satan rose up against him to fight him and the angel lord rebuke satan and god said i'm taking away your filthy garments i'm giving you clean garments praise god they were saying satan was trying to hinder nehemiah from building the wall they were such faithful workers working and battling at the same time building and fighting at the same time let's build the kingdom of god let's fight off the enemies at the same time praise god hallelujah that's what i'm doing to build the church of god i'm going to build the kingdom of god but i also want to fight off every mind battle that comes my way i can do it at the same time brother bang i can encourage but amen with this text and i can uh email that brother with the email with correcting him and fighting him off with his false doctrine like yesterday numerous people trying to tell me that the saturday's the sabbath day so i'm encouraging brother van over here encouraging uh sister so-and-so but then i'm fighting off the unbelievers over there that we will not compromise on one word we'll live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god that was 500 bc fast forward to john the baptist john rebukes the generation of vipers pharisees and sadducees who attend now listen they attended his services but they refused to be baptized now remember that was the light of the hour let me know that to be a real true believer in john's 8 you actually had to get baptized in water but the pharisees would come sit in the back everybody could tell they were the dress nicest they were the richest but yet they wouldn't go all the way and be baptized in water there's my 40 minutes let me give me five here and i went fast so satan slithered right into the true church but he wouldn't go all the way into john's baptism now we know judas did get baptized at first right he started with his sincere heart but then he backs it later and satan filled his heart so we couldn't say well judas wasn't baptized he was baptized the bible said jesus his disciples baptized everybody in john 4 1-3 so in the same manner then in jesus ministry we have the same generation of vipers jesus says you're serpents you generation of vipers look at this trail of the serpents all the way down what are they against the manifested word of the hour amen they're always against god's word for the hour let me stop with this one go to john 5 here we'll close with this one here so in dealing with the believe the sign folks which i want to show respect i appreciate their sincerity i appreciate uh yeah i just i say that i appreciate their sincerity um you come across the scriptures here look at verse 33 john 5 33 so one thing they really don't like is uh first john 1 7 that says walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from all unrighteousness right brother and uses that to say you must walk in the light of your hour which we can see oh that's plain but they can't see that now here's where it's proven this is what i'm emailing the brother verse 33 yes unto john and he bear witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man but those things i say that you might be saved look at john he was a burning and a shining what was he a light now how long did his light last church and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light and the church said amen john was a light his ministry was a light and they had the pharisees wouldn't walk in his life but thank god there was people that would walk in his light amen but it wasn't the light didn't last forever it was a light for a short season see that and you know just fast forward to pentecost no longer was it just water baptism now it's holy ghost fire johnson i'll baptize you with water but there's one coming after me mightier than me he'll baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire amen and then fast forward to ephesians the church in ephesus and acts 19 acts 19 1-7 paul says what were you he said do you have the holy ghost he said we didn't even know whether there was a holy ghost what baptism you have john's baptism see the light was already gone for that season they were living on a light that was a dimming out light paul said well there's a greater light sir he said you need to repent and be baptized in jesus christ's name they said praise the lord in other words they saw how dim their light was it was going out and then they saw how bright paul's light was oh church can you see how bright brother graham's light is for this day can you see the light that he held up and now he's off the scene but what the spirit and the bride the bride you and i are holding forth the light of the hour praise god amen brother graham's light was the former light glory the former rain the teaching raid which we're rejoicing in praise god but there's gonna come a final reign a final right rapturing faith amen that's the end of our feet praise god they could rejoice in his light for a season now if that don't prove it then church then we can't leave the sign people then we can't help jeffersonville if they can't see brother braham calling billy paul joseph in 1951 billy paul's my joseph if they can't see that that's not thus saith the lord then we can't help them we've tried i've tried we've done all we can do but church if we can't admit the simple truth of god's word then we've done all we can do and then we can rejoice that we've tried we can rejoice that we've labored and we've done our part to try to help everybody does anybody here hate anybody i hope not i hope not i didn't hear any amen that was good don't say amen to that [Music] does anybody here hate anybody no you might hate satan and his demons that you could say amen to that church we should have such love because the uh the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity is abounding but you and i should have the love of jesus christ in our hearts i didn't finish the trail of the serpent there's my 45. musicians if you've come let's just have a couple songs and see if anyone needs prayer i never know church sometimes i feel like you know maybe someone's going to need prayer i have to rebuke a spirit or something like that you never know i never know but i want to be ready at all times and i want to give there's a couple of times when i came in the message that i i kept saying lord if the preacher calls uh the net i'll go up and for prayer and then the preacher didn't call it and i was a little discouraged that wasn't their fault it was my fault i just should have went up but i i wasn't brave enough i wasn't uh didn't have enough courage say like that but as a preacher i do want to make that point if anyone needs prayer i'm happy to pray with you by god's grace if you need your faith combined with mine and the churches then we'll be happy to pray with you thank the lord how many

to be violent hateful or persecute anybody as we said wednesday help us to rebuke satan and his evil spirits keep them under our feet lord help us not to have hatred in our heart for other people that you created how can we say we love god who we can't see when we can't love who we can see who god created we want to love everyone we can see we want to be patient we want to be long-suffering we want to give them a chance lord god lord as we close this preaching aspect of the service god let us examine the grounds of our hearts to make sure it's a pure heart not a perverted heart but a pure heart
