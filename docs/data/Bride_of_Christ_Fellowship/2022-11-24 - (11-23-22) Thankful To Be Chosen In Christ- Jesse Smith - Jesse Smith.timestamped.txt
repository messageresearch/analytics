[0:00] but I think I promise everybody I'll try
[0:02] to preach a little shorter tonight
[0:03] because I've got some food preparations

[0:08] a good sign
[0:10] it's a real good sign so let's go to
[0:12] first Thessalonians 5 18 and then after
[0:14] that we'll go to Ephesians 1 verse 4.
[0:20] first Thessalonians 5 18.
[0:32] Thanksgiving of course is always a
[0:34] special time of the year for me that's
[0:35] the time I heard the message of the
[0:37] hours in fact the very day I heard the
[0:38] message of the hour so many years ago so
[0:41] just a special day for me always always
[0:43] will be praise God so thank God for his
[0:46] grace

[0:55] everything give thanks for this is the
[0:58] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:01] you let's go to Ephesians chapter 1
[1:03] verse 4. after that we'll just have a
[1:05] word of prayer and have you be seated
[1:06] here
[1:09] anytime we're giving thanks we we know
[1:11] we're in God's will
[1:13] don't you like that feeling I just love
[1:15] that feeling like when I go pray in the
[1:16] closet or something like I go in there
[1:18] and I can say I know I'm in the will of
[1:19] God
[1:21] there's no devil in hell that can tell
[1:23] me I'm out of God's will
[1:24] because I'm obeying the commands of God
[1:26] same is true tonight if you come to give
[1:28] God thanks you know you're doing God's
[1:29] will tonight
[1:31] what a blessing Hallelujah thank you
[1:33] Jesus thank you for every good and
[1:35] perfect gift Hallelujah
[1:36] Ephesians 1 verse four let's read this
[1:38] if we can on three one two three
[1:40] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:44] before the foundation of the world that
[1:48] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:51] before him in love may God has blessings
[1:54] the Ring of his word you may be seated
[1:56] God bless you
[1:59] Hallelujah I just have a couple uh
[2:01] slides here I'm gonna mainly be
[2:03] preaching here
[2:06] this is the thought I preached on Sunday
[2:08] we went to the Baptist Church and
[2:11] had a real good time by God's grace like
[2:12] I said we heard that two people that I
[2:14] sent prayer cloths to had been healed I
[2:17] don't know what they were sick with but
[2:19] God healed them and a woman come up and
[2:21] tell me that right before service so I
[2:23] was thankful for that and the pastor
[2:26] texted me and said he just thoroughly
[2:27] enjoyed everything so
[2:29] it's a real blessing to be a light and
[2:31] and uh
[2:32] you know I've I've thrown around a few
[2:34] ideas but I'm hoping at some point
[2:36] they'll come to our church by God's
[2:38] grace and I mean full time
[2:40] so that's that's that's my prayer I've
[2:44] been praying that since I met the
[2:45] brother I haven't bring that off and on
[2:47] since he's just a good man and uh just
[2:49] trusting that God will do something
[2:51] there for him
[2:52] so I want to just speak on this this was
[2:53] my thought for Sunday thankful to be
[2:55] chosen in Christ I'll try to watch my
[2:57] time here
[2:59] um you know as soon as I
[3:01] uh
[3:03] finish the sermon two weeks ago in
[3:06] Indiana I got a text from the pastor
[3:08] saying can you preach for me and I
[3:09] thought why do you have brother Brian
[3:10] coming so yes that'd worked out and as
[3:12] soon as I send them a text the thought
[3:14] came to me thankful to be chosen in
[3:16] Christ it's just kind of like last week
[3:18] isolation just came to me that word just
[3:19] came to me and you were talking about
[3:21] that with Austin right Chris
[3:24] and so I text the brother I said yes I
[3:26] want to preach on thankful to be chosen
[3:27] in Christ and so
[3:28] and then after I preached the pastor
[3:31] come up and said you know what brother
[3:32] Jesse said
[3:33] a couple weeks ago that very same
[3:36] scripture came to my mind and I wanted
[3:37] to preach about what happened before the
[3:39] foundation of the world he said you just
[3:41] preached the message that God already
[3:43] gave me so I said I said well praise God
[3:45] I don't really like taking people's
[3:47] sermons I just like preaching the ones
[3:49] that God gives me but I said well praise
[3:51] God I'm glad we're on the same idea
[3:52] there and saying the same wave
[3:53] wavelength and the same thoughts so it
[3:57] was a real blessing there to be there
[3:58] and what a wonderful time with brother
[4:00] Brian praise God I listen to both
[4:01] messages and
[4:02] I really enjoyed them so it was a real
[4:04] blessing by God's grace
[4:06] and I'll be sharing you know I had Brian
[4:08] pray for me and I'll just share a little
[4:09] testimony at the end just how it's
[4:11] helped me already this week it's just
[4:13] been wonderful
[4:14] uh to see how God uh sends the word
[4:17] praise God he just sends the word at the
[4:19] right time and the right season amen so
[4:22] I want to encourage everybody you know
[4:23] as we approach tomorrow to be thankful
[4:25] for all that we have you know I've heard
[4:27] different preachers and different people
[4:29] text me this week and say this is their
[4:30] favorite holiday
[4:32] and I I don't know it's kind of hard you
[4:34] know there are such great holidays how
[4:36] can you be Easter I mean how can you
[4:37] beat the resurrection I'm not sure how
[4:39] you could beat that but the point is you
[4:41] know it's a nice holiday where there's
[4:42] you it's it's really not intermingled
[4:45] with a lot of uh evil things other than
[4:47] football you know and uh
[4:50] uh Good Friday or I'm sorry uh Black
[4:52] Friday shopping that's I think that's
[4:54] the wicked most wicked things you know
[4:55] that come out of Thanksgiving but
[4:57] um
[4:59] you know I think it's I like how it's
[5:01] highly valued amongst uh preachers and
[5:03] and the saints of God uh we want to
[5:06] thank God for all of the blessings that
[5:08] we have uh this year you know we are
[5:10] inflicted by I'm sorry infected we are
[5:12] we are affected by inflation so I guess
[5:14] we could say infected as well uh thanks
[5:17] to this leadership in the in the white
[5:19] house but
[5:20] um you know despite those challenges God
[5:23] has been very gracious to us in this
[5:25] nation and so we want to thank God for
[5:27] our health we want to thank God for the
[5:28] food that we have and uh the jobs that
[5:31] we have I was raised on food stamps most
[5:33] of my life and so uh it was very
[5:36] difficult life you know I didn't have
[5:38] all the food we could eat all the time I
[5:40] never went hungry but looking at the
[5:43] life I have now I can thank God I can
[5:44] see God has added so much to me
[5:47] and I never want to forget where I came
[5:49] from you know
[5:50] so I want to give God thanks and praise
[5:53] you know today my family lacks nothing
[5:55] really whatever the ACT if it's an
[5:57] actual need not a one no not a one but
[5:59] any actual need we can get it at a drop
[6:02] of a hat
[6:03] and that is all praise to the Lord Jesus
[6:06] Christ
[6:07] so we have so much to be thankful for
[6:09] I'm going to look at spiritual blessings
[6:11] tonight but don't forget natural
[6:12] blessings praise God we want to remember
[6:15] that you know we are 401 years since the
[6:19] first unofficial Thanksgiving
[6:21] okay that was between the Puritans and
[6:24] the Wampa panoag people which of course
[6:26] that included Samoset Squanto and
[6:28] different ones that had taught the
[6:30] Puritan's survival uh so many years ago
[6:33] but remember the the the the
[6:35] Thanksgiving beforehand wasn't a
[6:37] Thanksgiving the year before that it was
[6:39] an awful time the Puritans were sleeping
[6:41] on the ship at night time and then they
[6:43] would they would row out to the uh to
[6:45] Plymouth there to Massachusetts and they
[6:47] would they would work during the day and
[6:49] then go back out to the ship and sleep
[6:51] on the ship at night it was such an
[6:53] awful winner though over half of them
[6:55] died there was a hundred two Puritans
[6:58] that came over over half of them died
[7:00] due to malnutrition scurvy and other
[7:03] causes I think there was only four
[7:06] married women that actually survived
[7:07] that winter
[7:08] so that's very difficult to reproduce
[7:11] you know with only four married women
[7:13] but the next year you know Squanto
[7:16] Samoset showed them how to survive
[7:18] now Church what if they would have quit
[7:20] that first winner there
[7:22] what if they would have chose
[7:24] ingratitude instead of gratitude
[7:27] what if they would have chose to curse
[7:29] God instead of bless God
[7:31] we wouldn't be here today
[7:33] we wouldn't have this nation we wouldn't
[7:35] have all those blessings I named earlier
[7:37] we wouldn't have them right now
[7:39] and church this is a great lesson we
[7:41] should take to heart that even in our
[7:43] darkest hour we must find a way to give
[7:45] thanks
[7:46] because if they'd accurs God then this
[7:48] nation would have been cursed but
[7:50] because they bless God hallelujah we're
[7:52] blessed today amen
[7:54] and see another uh a brighter day was
[7:57] coming amen hallelujah a better season
[8:00] was coming a a more a more blessed time
[8:03] was coming a time of prosperity was
[8:05] coming church and let's look at it
[8:07] spiritually a time of spiritual growth
[8:09] is coming amen hallelujah a return of
[8:12] spiritual Power is coming praise God
[8:14] you've got to believe it you've got to
[8:16] press through the dark times you gotta
[8:18] you gotta make it through you got to
[8:19] just believe you cannot quit you must
[8:22] persevere if you want a good season
[8:23] Hallelujah
[8:25] they did it they didn't curse God
[8:27] imagine losing half of your friends all
[8:29] in one winter
[8:30] they never gave up they chose
[8:32] thankfulness and we see how blessed we
[8:35] are today because of their sacrifice so
[8:38] we return to give thanks this
[8:40] Thanksgiving Hallelujah
[8:42] and we give God all the praise and all
[8:43] the glory so if ever a people could say
[8:46] in everything give thanks this is the
[8:47] will of God in Christ Jesus it was the
[8:49] Puritans amen who found a way to give
[8:52] thanks when they had hardly any natural
[8:55] blessings they look forward to the
[8:57] spiritual blessings and God bless them
[8:59] abundantly praise God now uh if you go
[9:02] to Ephesians 1 we'll go there briefly
[9:04] here
[9:05] Ephesians one now our our verse was
[9:08] verse four but I'm gonna read verse
[9:09] three blessed be the God and father of
[9:12] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[9:14] us with all spiritual blessings in
[9:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so I
[9:19] want you to see God
[9:21] here has blessed us hallelujah we bless
[9:25] God because God has blessed us
[9:28] and he hasn't given us some spiritual
[9:30] blessings but all spiritual blessings
[9:32] but where are they sometimes it's hard
[9:35] to see him with our with our busy lives
[9:37] our cell phones and the TV screens and
[9:39] and the job requirements sometimes it's
[9:41] hard to see the spiritual blessings but
[9:43] Paul tells us where they are they're in
[9:45] heaven amen hallelujah I'll tell you
[9:47] I'll tell you where the blessings are
[9:48] they're in the bosom of Jesus Christ
[9:50] hallelujah amen and he pours out those
[9:53] blessings when you when you and I offer
[9:56] up the prayers of the Saints amen when
[9:58] the prayers goes up the blessings come
[10:00] down hallelujah amen so that's what the
[10:03] Bible plainly tells us that and they're
[10:05] all located in heaven we just got to ask
[10:07] for them because the Bible says we have
[10:08] not because we ask not
[10:10] whatever spiritual need we have whatever
[10:13] spiritual blessing we have keep asking
[10:15] God keep trusting God because the Bible
[10:17] said all of them are yours but they're
[10:19] in Heavenly places and you must wait
[10:21] till it's Heaven's time until it comes
[10:23] down to you praise God
[10:24] amen verse 4 according to see hath
[10:27] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[10:28] of the world that we should obey I'm
[10:31] sure that we should be holy we should
[10:32] obey we should be holy and Without Blame
[10:34] before him in love
[10:37] so notice God chose us in him before the
[10:41] world was founded or set in its position
[10:43] and and he wanted us when he chose us he
[10:46] knew we'd be holy which means separated
[10:48] from the world
[10:49] that's why we have very little
[10:51] interaction with the world
[10:53] okay they they might think we're crazy
[10:55] but I'd rather have them think I'm crazy
[10:56] than the to make myself worldly praise
[10:59] God I'd rather have that I'd rather be
[11:01] holy and separate and the Bible said
[11:04] Without Blame so Satan can't put any
[11:07] blame on me and you in heaven praise God
[11:09] because God chose us before the
[11:12] foundation of the world praise God and
[11:14] if God chose us the devil can't unchoose
[11:16] us amen the devil didn't choose me so he
[11:19] can't get rid of me praise God God chose
[11:21] me so he's going to keep me amen
[11:24] glory amen I wasn't Chosen and saved him
[11:27] before the foundation of the world I was
[11:29] chosen in Jesus Christ amen before the
[11:32] foundation of the world Hallelujah that
[11:34] I should be holy and I should be without
[11:36] blame Hallelujah live live a life of no
[11:39] blame live a life of of no guilt amen
[11:42] hallelujah in other words live an honest
[11:44] good life Hallelujah
[11:46] verse 5.
[11:48] having predestinated us unto the
[11:50] adoption of children
[11:52] that means predetermined he
[11:54] predetermined our adoption of children
[11:56] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[12:00] the good pleasure of his will amen he
[12:04] decided beforehand that's what
[12:05] predestinate means he decided beforehand
[12:08] that he would adopt us as his children
[12:10] for his pleasure
[12:12] so it made him happy to to make you one
[12:15] of the children of God
[12:17] that made him happy praise God
[12:19] it wasn't a it wasn't a burden for God
[12:22] to choose you huh it pleased God to
[12:25] choose you amen and may God smile that
[12:27] he chose you amen it pleased God it was
[12:31] not a discouraging thing well I've got
[12:33] to choose Jesse I guess I have nobody
[12:34] else to choose you know
[12:36] I guess I gotta take him he's the only
[12:37] one that will go to Akron you know he's
[12:39] uh it wasn't like that it wasn't God I
[12:41] wasn't God's Last Choice amen I was his
[12:44] first choice amen I was in a second-hand
[12:47] choice I was his first hand Joyce so are
[12:49] you praise God
[12:50] it made him happy it gave him pleasure
[12:53] that you were a child of God
[12:55] amen and he made you accepted he gave
[12:58] you a place of position in heaven
[13:01] he priority prepared a place for you in
[13:03] heaven Hallelujah the Bible says think
[13:05] about it we're we're here we're here
[13:07] right now but the Bible said you have a
[13:09] body that's already waiting for you in
[13:11] heaven
[13:13] it's like all these Sci-Fi movies got
[13:15] you know they got these other all these
[13:17] uh
[13:18] artificial intelligence bodies and all
[13:20] these things like waiting other places
[13:21] that's kind of true it's kind of true we
[13:24] have a theophany body the Bible said
[13:27] it's an eternal body amen that means it
[13:29] never had a beginning it never had to
[13:31] end praise God it has no sin in it
[13:33] praise God it has no death in it amen
[13:35] and the Bible said it's a house that's
[13:37] waiting for you and I in the heavens
[13:39] Hallelujah
[13:41] I've got one waiting there praise God
[13:42] you have one waiting there Hallelujah
[13:44] and that's why you're already accepted
[13:47] in heaven because you're already got
[13:49] representation in heaven amen
[13:51] you in the case out of this you've
[13:53] already made it to Heaven because your
[13:55] body's in heaven amen
[13:57] your theophanese in heaven amen
[14:04] thank God Amen and I'm not making that
[14:07] up that's what the Bible says praise God
[14:09] I wouldn't make anything up by God's
[14:10] grace
[14:11] verse 6 to the praise of the glory of
[14:13] his grace wherein he hath made us
[14:15] accepted in the Beloved see all he chose
[14:18] us that we be children he chose us uh as
[14:21] the children to his praise
[14:24] so that's what we should do tonight
[14:25] that's what we should keep doing we
[14:26] should keep praising God
[14:28] keep glorifying God lord I praise you
[14:31] because you're you made me fearfully and
[14:33] wonderfully Lord I praise you because
[14:35] you chose me in you before the
[14:37] foundation of the world Lord I chose you
[14:39] because I got a body waiting in heaven
[14:41] amen
[14:42] Eternal in the heavens Hallelujah Lord I
[14:45] want to praise you because you adopted
[14:46] me into your family praise God I want to
[14:49] praise you because you had made me
[14:51] accept it in heaven Hallelujah
[14:54] all I have to worry about is heaven
[14:56] going to accept me or not the Bible said
[14:57] I'm already accepted in heaven
[15:00] Hallelujah
[15:01] by the blood of Christ amen my
[15:05] now of course we have a choice that so
[15:07] we don't we don't want to miss out on
[15:09] that part you know it's that it's like
[15:10] that old uh scripture from from Joshua
[15:13] that beautiful scripture choose you this
[15:14] day whom you will serve okay so so let's
[15:17] look at here
[15:18] if you got your Bible go to Romans 8.
[15:20] Romans 8 29 and 30 gives the the whole
[15:23] order of predestination
[15:30] so yes God chose you but the secret is
[15:33] God chose you because he knew you choose
[15:35] him
[15:36] God cannot force anybody to go to heaven
[15:39] God cannot force anybody to go to hell
[15:41] because then God is not fair God is Not
[15:43] Just
[15:44] but because God had foreknowledge he
[15:47] knew who would choose him and then he
[15:49] formed them and shaped them just like a
[15:50] vessel praise God he knew Austin would
[15:52] be a Christian he knew amen would be a
[15:53] Christian he knew William would be a
[15:55] Christian so then he in his mind he
[15:57] already knew how to form them and I'm
[15:59] going to do this kind of gift with music
[16:00] or this kind of praying for the sick or
[16:02] or this kind of gift here of Faith or
[16:04] something like that and he formed the
[16:05] vessels just the way he wanted them
[16:08] praise God Amen in his mind he had all
[16:11] planned out in his mind praise God he
[16:13] knew you Jews him so that's why that's
[16:14] why he could choose you then that's why
[16:16] he were in his mind praise God because
[16:18] he knew you'd choose him Hallelujah
[16:22] for whom he did for no he also did
[16:24] predestinate so fear what is the first
[16:26] step the first step is for knowledge
[16:29] God foreknew what you do because he
[16:32] foreknew he did also predestinate that
[16:34] means uh predetermined
[16:37] oh I got that order mixed up forgive me
[16:39] I got the order mixed up I got
[16:41] I got that wrong predestination second
[16:43] sorry okay for some reason forgive me
[16:46] yeah I got that wrong
[16:48] my fault so just so you know
[16:50] predestination second sorry
[16:52] determined because God had four now she
[16:54] could determine events beforehand in his
[16:57] mind how they'd play out then the Bible
[16:59] says uh predestinate to be conformed to
[17:02] the image of his son that he might be
[17:03] the firstborn among many Brethren
[17:05] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[17:07] he also called now called has a couple
[17:10] different definitions uh means election
[17:12] and choosing
[17:14] all right and then uh and whom he called
[17:17] then he also Justified that means
[17:19] declare righteous
[17:21] Hallelujah
[17:22] and whom he justified then he also
[17:25] glorified
[17:26] amen
[17:29] now I'm going to get back to that one
[17:30] sorry that's out of order my fault
[17:32] that's that's really shocking to me I
[17:34] didn't mean to do that okay First Peter
[17:35] 1 verse two First Peter 1 verse two
[17:37] let's read that if you got your Bibles
[17:39] now here at church now we see God's plan
[17:41] this is how God lays everything out
[17:43] maybe I can fix that on my phone I don't
[17:45] know let's try it while you turn that
[17:47] First Peter 1 verse 2.
[17:49] just make me feel good if I could fix
[17:51] that real quick
[17:56] yes sir
[18:06] yeah exactly sir yes amen
[18:10] yes sir exactly right
[18:12] and it worked out perfectly
[18:14] you like we talked about last week in
[18:16] there you needed the church
[18:18] right you needed a friend you needed you
[18:21] wanted somebody to be with right same
[18:22] thing happened to me I I was my mom
[18:24] dropped me off at Akron I had nobody the
[18:26] Christians coming they kind of sought me
[18:28] out it was God chasing me out it was God
[18:30] leaving the 99 to get the one by God's
[18:32] grace same thing brother yes beautiful
[18:33] God works out every event of your life
[18:35] perfectly
[18:37] yeah it's a beautiful plan amen it's a
[18:40] beautiful uh knowledge so okay now it's
[18:42] fixed okay thank the Lord perfect
[18:44] okay First Peter 1 verse two elect
[18:46] according to the foreknowledge of God so
[18:48] see let's look up here so you're elected
[18:50] because of God's predestination God
[18:51] calls you in other words because he
[18:53] could predestinate or predetermine the
[18:55] events of your life
[18:57] right he had already this he had
[18:58] everything lined up your parents and all
[18:59] these grandparents he had all them lined
[19:01] up and then because of that
[19:03] predestination he could call you at a
[19:05] certain time
[19:07] now but over at this next part is so
[19:09] crucial this is what we all got to
[19:10] submit to every day through what
[19:13] sanctification
[19:14] cleaning you out and the church said
[19:17] you're elect according to your elect
[19:19] according to your sanctification see as
[19:22] God cleans you out you recognize I'm
[19:24] called I'm elected God chose me because
[19:26] he's cleaning me out why is he cleaning
[19:28] out so he can feel you and then he can
[19:30] use you praise God oh no greater
[19:32] privilege than for God to clean you out
[19:34] so he can fill you he can use you and
[19:37] then you can praise His holy name amen
[19:40] because that's why you're credited too
[19:41] the praise of his glory amen
[19:43] the whole purpose of man is to praise
[19:45] God
[19:46] Hallelujah that's what we're doing
[19:48] tonight amen
[19:50] Grace be unto you and peace be
[19:51] multiplied
[19:52] I'm sorry I skipped the part through
[19:54] sanctification of the spirit unto what
[19:56] obedience so see God has to keep
[19:58] cleaning you out so you will obey and
[19:59] church says brother Brian preach so
[20:01] beautifully we don't always obey right
[20:02] away
[20:03] all of us need help obeying the word of
[20:05] God because we're fighting a battle
[20:07] against a person that hates the word of
[20:10] God and that's you amen you're fighting
[20:13] against a person that hates the word
[20:14] it's your sin nature inside you
[20:17] now these scriptures then give us the
[20:20] perfect outline here
[20:24] now I just want to emphasize this I I on
[20:26] Sunday I said let's take a trip back in
[20:28] time and see where God chose you
[20:31] so two years ago we had coveted
[20:34] I'm sure we all want to go back in our
[20:35] minds to that right mandates and
[20:37] lockdowns we all want to go back to that
[20:39] well we we could we could think about it
[20:41] they probably want to do it again no
[20:43] doubt they probably will
[20:44] that's okay uh Jesus church will keep
[20:47] marching on by God's grace
[20:48] that was two years ago now 500 five
[20:51] years ago Martin Luther
[20:53] started the Protestant Reformation
[20:55] 505 years ago but you were chosen before
[20:58] that
[21:00] that means god already knew about the
[21:01] next church next two Church ages he
[21:03] already knew about all that you were
[21:05] chosen before that
[21:07] 1900 years ago I'm sorry 1992 years ago
[21:12] Jesus died for your sins on the cross
[21:14] think about that we're almost at 2 000
[21:16] years from the the day the year he was
[21:18] crucified
[21:19] almost 2 000 years of course people will
[21:21] be making that a Rapture prediction I'm
[21:23] sure
[21:24] every year every day every year every
[21:26] month they make it now
[21:29] a thousand years before that 2 988 years
[21:32] ago Solomon built the temple I might
[21:34] preach on that on Sunday
[21:35] uh
[21:36] one of our supporters asked me to preach
[21:38] on the Temple of Solomon so I might
[21:40] preach on that I bought a book on it
[21:41] I've been reading it
[21:42] I might preach on that it always
[21:44] everything applies to us every day you
[21:46] can always see Christ in every scripture
[21:48] you can see that everything so it
[21:49] doesn't really matter you know as long
[21:51] as you're humble you'll see Christ in
[21:52] every scripture
[21:53] you were chosen before Solomon's Temple
[21:55] was built
[21:58] three thousand four hundred sixty eight
[21:59] years ago Moses LED Israel out of Egypt
[22:03] 3 500
[22:04] years 4 370 years ago God flooded this
[22:08] Earth
[22:10] six thousand twenty six years ago Adam
[22:12] and Eve were forced out of the Garden of
[22:14] Eden because of their sins you were
[22:17] chosen before Adam and Eve were kicked
[22:19] out of Eden
[22:20] Hallelujah now before the fall there
[22:23] were six days of creation
[22:24] some think they're literal days other
[22:26] think they're Thousand-Year days it's a
[22:28] little joke in our family
[22:30] but before those six days God created
[22:33] the heavens and the Earth
[22:35] because the Bible said in the beginning
[22:36] God created the Heaven and Earth and the
[22:38] Earth was without form and without void
[22:40] that was before the days of creation
[22:42] right
[22:43] so before Genesis 1 1 God was alone
[22:47] then first created time space and matter
[22:51] so before Genesis 1 1 you were chosen in
[22:54] the mind of God
[22:55] Hallelujah
[22:58] in other words God's known you your
[22:59] whole life and way before your life
[23:02] Hallelujah Church A lot happened before
[23:05] the foundation of the world at least
[23:06] according to the scriptures Matthew 13
[23:08] 35 said Jesus said I will open my mouth
[23:11] in Parables I will utter things which
[23:13] have been kept secret since the
[23:15] foundation of the world
[23:18] so before the world was founded Jesus
[23:20] had those seven parables in his mind
[23:23] the four kinds of grounds in the pair
[23:25] with the sower
[23:26] the wheat and the tears
[23:28] Hallelujah the grain of mustard seed the
[23:31] lemon hid with three measures a meal the
[23:34] treasure hidden the field the pearl of
[23:35] great price and the net cast in the sea
[23:37] all those were hidden in God before the
[23:41] foundation of the world
[23:43] Hallelujah
[23:45] Jesus was the visible Spirit logos and
[23:48] as the logos the fire of God he was
[23:50] loved by the invisible God
[23:53] because John 17 24 says
[23:57] he says that they may behold my glory
[24:00] which thou has given me for thou lovest
[24:02] me before the foundation of the world
[24:06] God loved Jesus Hallelujah before
[24:09] Genesis 1 1.
[24:11] and God thought of you before Genesis 1
[24:13] verse 1. Hallelujah
[24:16] amen
[24:17] Hebrews 4 verse 3 said the works that
[24:20] you're called to do were already done
[24:22] before the foundational world Amen
[24:24] Church there's nothing to worry about
[24:26] you don't have to worry and invite your
[24:28] nails and say am I going to finish God's
[24:30] works for me the Bible said God's
[24:33] already finished the works amen they
[24:35] were already finished they were already
[24:36] decided you can have confidence
[24:38] everything God's called you to do he'll
[24:40] equip you to do praise God
[24:43] that's Hebrews 4 verse 3.
[24:46] he said although the works were finished
[24:48] from the foundation of the world Amen
[24:51] Hallelujah in other words God is going
[24:54] to make sure his word comes to pass in
[24:56] your life amen
[24:58] it's already been determined it's
[24:59] already been finished it's already been
[25:01] pre-planned out amen
[25:03] God's ways cannot be defeated nobody can
[25:05] tell God when to stop or when to start
[25:07] God does whatever he wants he raises up
[25:09] whoever he wants he takes down whoever
[25:11] he wants he is in complete control all
[25:13] this was already planned out in God's
[25:15] mind before the foundation of the world
[25:17] we're just like we're we're just like
[25:18] actors on the stage just acting and out
[25:20] and maybe the best part about acting is
[25:22] that behind this mask is the spirit of
[25:25] God hallelujah amen
[25:28] thank God
[25:31] Jesus crucifixion was planned out before
[25:33] the foundation of the world
[25:35] the Bible said in Revelation 13 8 all
[25:38] they that drop on the Earth shall
[25:39] worship Him whose names are not written
[25:41] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[25:43] from the foundation of the world
[25:46] Hallelujah
[25:48] so the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of
[25:51] Life was written before the foundation
[25:53] of the world
[25:54] think about that the lamb already had a
[25:56] book before he became the lamb
[25:58] Hallelujah the book was written in
[26:01] advance and brother Chris your name was
[26:02] on that book sir
[26:04] Hallelujah
[26:06] and not only that
[26:08] but the Bible says the word of God is
[26:10] forever settled in heaven
[26:13] ah
[26:15] so before there was the earth there was
[26:17] some Bible up somewhere God had some
[26:18] book with all those secrets in it he had
[26:20] a book of names he had a book A book he
[26:22] had a book of life he had a Lamb's Book
[26:24] of Life he had all this planned out God
[26:26] had all these things and the word of God
[26:28] was laying there and the Bible said the
[26:30] Angels desire to look into those things
[26:32] amen
[26:34] hallelujah praise God the word of God
[26:37] was already settled in heaven
[26:42] so let's look at this then let's look at
[26:44] God's perspective before there was
[26:46] anything it was God Alone think of this
[26:48] big huge Spirit right and then the first
[26:50] thing he made was a visible uh light
[26:53] with time space and matter all at the
[26:54] same time time space and matter and
[26:56] light all come at the same time
[26:58] there was nothing but God's spirit and
[27:00] all of a sudden time space and matter I
[27:02] was thinking of it like this like God is
[27:03] out he's just he's outside of he's got
[27:06] he's got the whole universe here and
[27:08] he's just so great I mean he's he's so
[27:09] it's just hard to explain it's just hard
[27:11] to hard to understand but one thing we
[27:13] know is that he loves us praise God
[27:16] and he wrote our names on the last book
[27:18] of life before we even came out to the
[27:20] Earth praise God
[27:22] so first he was alone second the visible
[27:25] Pillar of Fire with uh uh Thai space and
[27:28] matter
[27:29] then he would have created the Heaven
[27:31] and not yet the Earth
[27:33] after heaven then he would have created
[27:35] angels
[27:37] because Angels need a place to live
[27:39] and then
[27:41] he would have created the Earth because
[27:43] the Bible said in Job 38 God told job
[27:46] where was thou when I laid the
[27:48] foundations of the Earth
[27:51] who hath laid the measurements or who
[27:54] set the measurements of the earth job
[27:57] did you measure it out job and make sure
[27:59] it was the right the right size
[28:01] he said or who has stretched the line
[28:04] upon him who stretched the measuring
[28:06] line on the earth to make sure it was
[28:08] just the right size
[28:10] not too small not too big
[28:13] God asked job that did you measure it
[28:15] before I laid it out here
[28:16] what did job say he said I repent and
[28:18] dust and Ashes I'm a I'm a wicked man
[28:20] right it's just like Isaiah amen
[28:23] whenever Isaiah got in the presence of
[28:25] God he'd say oh I'm a great person he
[28:26] said I'm a man of unclean lips dwelling
[28:29] amongst people with unclean lifts amen
[28:33] that's what the flesh is in the presence
[28:35] of God
[28:36] now then your soul never sinned as far
[28:39] as in the presence of God
[28:41] praise God hallelujah
[28:44] but your flesh will feel awful in the
[28:46] presence of God in that way when God's
[28:48] bringing a rebuke
[28:50] not the joy dances which we love those
[28:51] amen I love those you love The Joy
[28:53] shouts and the joy screams and the Joy
[28:55] cries we all love those
[28:57] but when it comes down to God's holiness
[28:59] versus our flesh we the Bible says we're
[29:02] like uh we're like dust we're like well
[29:04] it's just the Bible says the flesh is
[29:06] enmity against the Holy Spirit
[29:10] he said Joe where are you
[29:13] whereupon are the foundations there are
[29:16] fastened where did I fasten and settle
[29:19] and plant
[29:20] the fastest the Fasteners to hold the
[29:22] Earth in place
[29:23] where did I put those
[29:27] I'll say like this Joe still don't have
[29:29] any answers
[29:30] Hallelujah nor nor do we we don't know
[29:33] where God fastened think about a chain
[29:35] where you fasten something down God's
[29:37] like where did I put the passion where
[29:39] did I fasten the Earth at job do you
[29:41] know where do you know where I planted
[29:42] it do you know where I settled it and
[29:43] put those fasteners
[29:45] or who laid the Cornerstone thereof job
[29:47] did you lay the Cornerstone of the Earth
[29:49] did you lay that mixture and make sure
[29:51] it was perfectly straight and it was the
[29:53] most beautiful piece that's what I do
[29:54] for the Cornerstone they had to find the
[29:55] most beautifully cut stone
[29:58] there's lots of stones but they had to
[30:00] find the most perfectly cut stone
[30:02] and then they laid that one in place and
[30:04] then everything else was built off of
[30:06] that both the walls going from that
[30:08] Cornerstone everything was built on the
[30:10] most perfect Stone and God asked job did
[30:12] you lay the Cornerstone did you measure
[30:14] that before
[30:16] he said did you do that when the morning
[30:19] star sang together and all the sons of
[30:22] God shouted for Joy amen hallelujah so
[30:25] it was it was God it was time space and
[30:28] matter it was Heaven Angel angels and
[30:31] then the Earth came out and the Earth
[30:33] got settled and when the angel saw that
[30:35] Earth just line up and stop right at its
[30:38] place and get and get fastened down in
[30:40] in this invisible atmosphere somehow it
[30:43] got fastened out all the Angels shouted
[30:45] for Joy hallelujah praise God our God is
[30:49] great our God is Holy our God is worthy
[30:51] of all praise but even before that
[30:54] church you were chosen in Christ before
[30:56] one Angel ever shouted amen
[30:59] oh my God I'm trying to take you back a
[31:02] little with the Eternal perspective you
[31:04] were already chosen before the
[31:06] foundation before the the settling of
[31:10] the earth you were already chosen in
[31:12] Christ that's the Bible truth that ought
[31:14] to make us thankful tonight
[31:16] ah Hallelujah
[31:19] you were chosen which means foreknown or
[31:21] called in Christ
[31:24] before the world came to its settling
[31:26] position the Fasteners fastened it down
[31:29] now the neat thing is God fastened it
[31:31] down and then he spun it around
[31:33] so it's got Fasteners that don't get
[31:35] tangled up
[31:36] have somebody explain that to me
[31:38] see it's fastened down it's measured out
[31:40] and then he spins it
[31:43] Hallelujah but before all this before
[31:46] one Angel shouted amen God already chose
[31:49] you in his mind amen
[31:52] so now we know what God was doing before
[31:53] the foundation of the world having
[31:55] Angels right making angels He was laying
[31:57] out books he was writing plans he had
[32:00] the word of God forever to settled to
[32:01] Heaven he had a book of life he had a
[32:03] Lamb's Book of Life
[32:05] but before that Earth found its position
[32:07] he already chose you and I in his mind
[32:12] Hallelujah and if you were chosen in
[32:14] Christ Christ is the word that means you
[32:17] are a part of the word which is why you
[32:19] love the Bible so much
[32:21] and if you don't it's time to break up
[32:23] uh some of that sleep from your eyes
[32:25] just trying to wake up from that sleep
[32:27] and Find Your Love back for God's Bible
[32:29] because this is God's spirit on paper
[32:32] form amen this is the nature of God on
[32:34] paper form Hallelujah and if you are
[32:36] chosen in Christ you were chosen the
[32:38] word in other words you'll find your
[32:39] life right in this Bible praise God
[32:42] you ain't gonna find it anywhere else
[32:43] you're gonna find your life you're going
[32:45] to find everything you need all those
[32:47] spiritual blessings are in the word of
[32:48] God Amen
[32:50] Hallelujah
[32:53] you're part of God you're part of the
[32:55] word
[32:56] you are part of God's family Hallelujah
[32:59] that's why you love the Bible so much
[33:01] now some people might say that's really
[33:02] nice brother Jesse but I my life seems
[33:05] so seems so insignificant you couldn't
[33:07] be further from the truth
[33:10] your life is incredibly significant
[33:12] Jesus said you are the light of the word
[33:15] of the world
[33:16] in other words you are the only light in
[33:19] this dark filthy dirty world
[33:22] think think of it we got most of the
[33:24] light in here in Akron Ohio we have most
[33:25] of the light
[33:28] right got wise versions foolish versions
[33:30] We have most of the light in this deep
[33:32] dark city this is this wicked City the
[33:34] sin the sin loving City we have most of
[33:37] the light is here
[33:39] and the Bible said uh the Nations the
[33:42] Bible said no man will have an excuse on
[33:44] that day
[33:45] because the Bible said God said his
[33:47] light you're a city on a hill that
[33:49] cannot be hit
[33:50] strangers might walk by you right your
[33:53] co-workers might just pass right by you
[33:55] but on the day of judgment they'll have
[33:58] to recognize that you were the light
[34:01] you were mad you were emitting something
[34:03] different amen your words were shining
[34:05] for something different your attitude
[34:07] was so different praise God Amen your
[34:10] character was so different they'll never
[34:11] be able to deny the lights Hallelujah
[34:15] Jesus said you are the light
[34:18] not just a light but you're the light
[34:21] that's way high above all the other
[34:22] things you're on a hill crazy you're on
[34:24] a mountain
[34:26] ah the Bible said you've already come to
[34:29] Mount Zion amen where is he Hallelujah
[34:32] where's my guy I'm using him his name
[34:34] right now
[34:35] you've come to Mount Zion we haven't
[34:37] come to another place we haven't come to
[34:38] a valley although sometimes we feel like
[34:40] we're in the valley shadow of a decision
[34:42] right or the valley of shadow of death
[34:43] but when we manifest the love of God
[34:46] when we obey the word of God God sets us
[34:48] on a hill and he makes everybody
[34:50] recognize this is a Believer this is how
[34:52] you should act this is how you should
[34:54] live this is the light of God Amen
[34:58] Hallelujah
[34:59] your life is way more significant than
[35:02] what you think
[35:03] and me I'm talking about me I'm
[35:04] preaching to myself
[35:06] the Bible said the Nations will not have
[35:08] an excuse
[35:09] because you are the light of the world
[35:12] Hallelujah
[35:14] how many times you think Church on
[35:15] people's algorithms on YouTube do our
[35:17] sermons come up
[35:19] and they either click on them or they
[35:21] scroll right past them
[35:23] see they're scrolling all they see
[35:24] Darkness all of a sudden our sermon
[35:25] comes up light ooh light all right
[35:27] spiritual light
[35:29] and they might watch it I got some good
[35:31] testimonies this week from our videos
[35:32] you know real good testimonies
[35:34] or they might not that's light
[35:37] light is shining and there'll be no
[35:39] excuses praise God
[35:42] and he said let your light so shine
[35:44] before men
[35:46] that they may see your good works and
[35:48] glorify your father which is in heaven
[35:50] sometimes you can't help but do things
[35:52] publicly not everything is done in
[35:54] secret
[35:55] but we should be careful to do Secret
[35:57] works because it keeps us sincere
[36:00] if we just do things that people see we
[36:03] lose our sincerity we lose that
[36:05] one-on-one with God
[36:07] we lose that communion with God
[36:10] that's why we've got to keep the secret
[36:11] things going too but there are sometimes
[36:13] you just can't help it you got to do
[36:14] something good you got to help somebody
[36:15] out
[36:16] and people are going to see it and Jesus
[36:19] said let your light shine amen

[36:23] don't don't make yourself dark let your
[36:25] light shine because people will see and
[36:27] then they'll glorify God and they'll say

[41:04] when I was on Facebook I liked that how
[41:06] that it could go from a like to a love
[41:07] I'd say oh yeah now I can love stuff
[41:10] I got tired of all the likes now I can
[41:13] love it
[41:14] that's how God is God just doesn't like
[41:17] us the Bible said God loves us
[41:20] Hallelujah
[41:23] when you come to church when you got

[41:31] Hallelujah you got the Holy Ghost God
[41:33] said I love that amen
[41:35] that's Romans 9 25 and God's gonna call
[41:39] them my people which were not my people
[41:41] you are this we're a Church of God's
[41:44] people
[41:44] we could change the name of this church
[41:46] from bride of Christ Fellowship to my
[41:48] God's people church this is God's people
[41:51] or we can call it my beloved Church
[41:53] Christ's beloved Church
[41:55] because the Bible said we were not
[41:57] beloved but now we are his beloved we're
[42:00] his special love we're his chosen amen
[42:02] where his elected bride Hallelujah he
[42:05] did that praise God he determined that
[42:07] he chose me before I chose him
[42:10] Hallelujah
[42:11] oh yes
[42:15] all right you got 40 minutes in by God's
[42:17] grace okay
[42:18] now in Ephesians chapter 5 there's five
[42:22] things a bride must do Christ must be
[42:24] her head
[42:25] so see who's leading you
[42:28] as long as the Bible's leading you then
[42:30] Christ is your head
[42:32] second you must submit to all things in
[42:35] the word of God now we're daily in need
[42:37] help of that by God's grace as long as
[42:39] you're endeavoring and striving to do
[42:41] that then you then you got the second
[42:42] one
[42:43] in other words I don't want to
[42:44] denominate and just not obey some of
[42:46] these things like a denominations do I
[42:48] don't want to just get by with
[42:48] Christianity I wanna I want all God has
[42:50] for me
[42:52] I want to obey all of God's word
[42:55] I know it's hard but I'll do it by God
[42:57] by his grace I can do it we can do it
[42:59] third you got to be washed By the Waters
[43:01] of the word you gotta let God wash you
[43:03] clean out your thought life clean out
[43:05] your actions right clean out all your
[43:06] plans clean out all your habits right
[43:08] clean you out amen
[43:10] fourth you got to be joined to Christ
[43:11] which means glued to Christ
[43:14] that's why we gather more as we see that
[43:15] day approaching
[43:16] we got to be in order to be glued to
[43:18] Christ we've got to be glued to one
[43:19] another
[43:20] and Faith you must reverence the word of
[43:22] God because the Bible said the wife must
[43:25] reverence her husband
[43:26] that's why when We Gather we've got to
[43:28] have utmost reverence for Jesus
[43:30] Hallelujah
[43:32] so see church this makes us the bride
[43:34] your life is extremely significant
[43:36] because Jesus only has so many people in
[43:38] his bride there's the Bible says God is
[43:41] with the Gentiles until the fullness of
[43:43] the Gentiles become in
[43:45] there's only a certain number and by
[43:47] God's grace we want to be in that number
[43:49] praise God
[43:51] there's only so many
[43:53] we see so many people falling away or or
[43:55] not even believing or or you know we see
[43:58] people passing away and wondering about
[44:00] their decisions that they make
[44:02] well that's their decision but our
[44:04] decision is plain we can be the wife of
[44:07] Christ we just have to do what the Bible
[44:09] says we've got to trust God and we've
[44:11] got to let him sanctify us unto
[44:12] obedience amen
[44:15] also Church another part is you have to
[44:16] we you and I have to finish the Great
[44:18] Commission so the question is who can

[44:26] Commission God never said you have to go

[46:29] come at the wedding
[46:30] [Laughter]

[46:35] final step comes at the wedding when you

[46:40] get a brand new glorified body
[46:42] that's when the glorification happens
[46:44] Hallelujah

[53:24] Satan can't use me to get drunk or get
[53:26] high
