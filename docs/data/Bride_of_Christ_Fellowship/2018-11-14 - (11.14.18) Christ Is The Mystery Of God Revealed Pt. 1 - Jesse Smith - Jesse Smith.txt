one more than it's already 7:33 boy where's the time go when you get in heavenly places amen praise the Lord listening I'll go the distance praise God will sing that by God's grace hallelujah well I've gone this far I started serving Jesus in 1999 so I started then I've gone this far I know I can go the rest of the distance for he's God amen because you know like the Bible says he gets sweeter as the days go by how we know that actually thank the Lord for that to thank God for His Word praise God the Bible clearly says is that in the latter days some will the back nathan god and follow other ways but i have set my course and i will make it through i choose to walk this narrow way the road that led to you now God the distance it's how go the distance will not compromise pressing on to win the bra [Laughter] you Christ Jesus I'll go the distance [Music] [Applause] I'll go that distance will not compromise freshly go to Christ Jesus I'll go the distance like a birds whatever you require Lord that's what I'll do nothing to the gain on earth compares to knowing you so when the days grow dark and the world it seems so steep I trust forward to be my life and a follower [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] I'll go that distance will not compromise will not compromise [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] whatever you require Lord that's what we'll do amen praise God let's take your Bibles let's go to Colossians chapter 1 as I said on Sunday I like to preach on Christ as the mystery of God revealed and I just kind of felt led strangely I just kind of felt led to go there let's go to caution chapter 1 we preaching out of there tonight by the grace of the Lord you know this is such an important message you know there's so many important quotes you know that that preachers get I'm sure that you've heard and that you enjoy from this series by God's grace so I'm sorry this for our sermon by the man preached for our sermon and it's so critical and so I just want to kind of go slowly through this I just kind of felt burdened here to go through this with you I've done this before you know I think I preached three or four messages on spoken words the original seed a few years back and numerous series you know we just gone slowly through different series we preach the old church age book you know we know that it's good you know I found in church I found it's good to men take on something when you just go slowly through it you meditate upon it and it really renews your strength praise God how many can be a witness to that you just meditate on something it really becomes a reality and it's such a tremendous blessing here to meditate upon these things so Colossians chapter 1 by the grace of the Lord let's read oh there's such a caution is one of such a tremendous chapter let's just go to verse 12 and then worry down to 18 12 to 18 verse 12 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light let's read 13 together ready 1 2 3 who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now I'll read I'll read 15 16 17 and will read 18 together who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones their dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist let's read 18 together 1 2 3 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen he's before all things all things consist or continued because of him amen and you know the what what you know what the one thing he wants is he wants me first in your life that's what this message is all about so let's just bow our heads if you have a need on your heart just make it known to God as we try to preach this again Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your mercy Lord we're going the distance tonight Lord God we've set aside everything else and we gather in your house to worship you this House of Prayer this house of reaching this house of love this house of light this house of hope Lord God this is your house come and dwell amongst us we feel your presence O God and be magnified amongst your people bless us Lord as we read your word and preach these things Lord God no doubt it might be review to some a Lord just Lord refresh it to our hearts Lord God Lord you bring out of your treasures both things new and old so I pray you do that tonight I receive all the glory in Jesus Christ name the Saint said Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord how many have listened to this lately is anyone listening to Christ the mystery God revealed lately all right well good is gonna be a fresh then for everybody praise the Lord it's been fresh to me it been a while since I listened to it and I'm still not even done you know I'm just been going real slow to kind of take everything real slow it's one of the most well well known and well quoted sermons and tonight I think we'll see why because I'm just going to be able to hit the highlights of it you know it's a four-hour recording program starts with a baby dedication at 28 minutes though so about a half hour into it he still has not taken his text yet and then about 28 minutes he starts the word to the church I remember the word to the church I want to read that again because it kind of ties in with you know what we preach on recently with the Ephesian Church age let me just make sure okay everything is good to go all right well Graham said I want you to remember that brother Neville here in left in the church in the charge of this Tabernacle under the Holy Spirit that he is left here and he believes the message and teaches it just the same as I do and anytime that you'd want to you can see fit to come here brother Nevel he certainly would do you good I'm sure he's a great servant of Jesus Christ so I just want you to notice every brother Ram said brother Nevel and him were on the same page a hundred percent they believed the message the same way now I want to say that because the last time I preached on the Ephesian Church age I'm sorry the book of Ephesians we talked about how the move in Jeffersonville today is to take pastors out of the pulpit but when brother Branham was here he left brother Neville in charge of preaching to the people and it was not playing a tape it was preaching live sermons and he believed the same thing brother Brandon did they would no other words we'd say they're there they're preaching dovetail together and he was under charge by the Holy Spirit so the Holy Spirit was leading brother Neville to preach every service program says I've known Ormond Neville since I was a little boy and he hasn't changed one speck only got closer to God how many would like someone to say that about you you haven't changed except the only way you've changed now you're more like Jesus amen hallelujah brother Branham said he was invited to it brother Neville's Methodist platform and when he came back after preaching a brother Neville's Methodist Church he said someday I'll baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ and here he is with a message now a real gallant servant he says and brother Neville goes through many strains and heartaches he doesn't show it here at the Tabernacle but being that the Lord let's me have a little sight into people's life I know what he goes through a lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of labor and strains and things and you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as he's bringing the word amen that's what I'd like you to do hold me up in prayer whoever comes there brother Bednar on hold him up in prayer keep all the services in prayer pray for everybody that's your duty to hold up the preacher's hands amen we cannot have any success in our services unless everybody's praying everybody's bringing oyel praise the god we preach on that that's the only way we'll have good services if everybody's doing their part praying asking God to bless us in his presence amen and it was actually a member was Joshua and her not Joshua and Caleb but just those you know who know your Bible brother BAM said take everything back to the word right so just to show that brother Rams a man now brianna hears the word to the church and I've seen I've walked in pastors offices and they have this whole thing on a plaque hanging up in their office but man says love one another above everything we love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let you stay that way no sir he'll shoot he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target so if we least say if all of us say pure Satan can't shoot us with a dart right so he'll have to send somebody in that he can zyou with the dart and caused him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then I'll shoot that guy with some comic kind of a poison stuff and it'll start through the church with it don't take sides with it don't have nothing to do with anything else you stayed right loving and sweet and kind of one another pray for that man that he'll be saved or that woman whoever it is just pray for them and stick with another he says praise God and stay with your pastor he's the Shepherd I like this quote and you give him respects which you do you all do he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now I do remember that he says the enemy will come he says and when he does just cleaning that much closer together and the one that the devil is using fer to enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all hey man I like that praise God November let me just tell you that story that brother Simon told there was a message pastor down in North Carolina somebody came in the message said he believed all the message he got baptized he hung around for a few years and then he was riding in the car he started being the buddy of the pastor he was riding in the car and the the buddy was telling the past you know you need to change this you should stop doing this stop saying the name brother branham stop doing these things top you know stop having the prayer meetings and all these things like that which we have prayer meetings every service everybody's welcome to come before the prayer meetings half-hour before every service we still have prayer meetings just so you know but the the man was telling the pastor to do this and this is a pastor that was raised in Branham tabernacle new brother Branham and the Holy Spirit said this man's a Jesuit to the pastor and the pastor said are you a Jesuit and he said let me out of the vehicle and this is a pastor that's told me this story face to face and he said so he let him out and then he just drove away you don't know what would ever happen to the man but that's a good example of somebody that comes in the church and acts like everybody else he act like he believed the message but see because no one in the church would take a live spirit Satan had to send somebody in with a lying spirit and then had to inject him with a little seed of discrepancy I like that I like how the man stayed true to what he believed he stayed true to the message and then pretty soon that person either get converted or that person will leave by God's grace amen and so the same thing is true for us I think we've seen it in the last you know we of course as a pastor I've seen it for the last 12 years but people will come in they'll either be a part of us and stay and stay true to God or God will take them out and that's what we want we don't want any leaven in our lump we only want unleavened bread here praise God and so what we've got to do is in the hard time so you've just got a clean closer together don't take sides with anybody just take sides with Jesus amen so I just want to reiterate that that that's what Satan's going to do if everybody feels happy now guess what Saints gonna do he's trying to get it to trying to anoint somebody in here or inject somebody to kind of dislike somebody else Satan's always trying to conquer the land team but I'll say like this we've got to conquer Satan with the love of Jesus Christ we've got to overcome any evil we got to overcome any Eve with good that's right the program says you've got tapes so what b-but we believe you got tapes on discipline the church and how to behave yourself in the Church of God how we got to come together and sit together in heavenly places he says don't stay at home if God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open to get there to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to prayin because we're in the last days and the Bible exhorted us much more so you see that they approach him to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love for one another he said stay right together see when you see people start skipping church or falling away from church you know you only have to wonder you know that's the devil because brother Graham tells us the Bible tells us we're a cruel Christians we'll gather more as they see that Day approaching amen program said you just wax that much closer together he said take the buckle he says and that buckles the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten her up remove right close up one to another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another then God will bless you now then he talks about taking the message now he says now he sees praying is that lord help me this morning as we read your word may the Holy Spirit revealed to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you gave vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy-looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored up here in the tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granite Lord or a tape load he says that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give a sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead oh I can say amen to that this is a real tape load of spiritual food praise God Hey hallelujah remember at 62 brother had a vision he said vision said stay in the tabernacle and store up vegetables Thorpe tapes in other words preached these long sermons so that the Saints will have food later on and I'm glad he did because it's what we're feeding on today I'll tell if there's one thing we need to feed on today it's loving Christ and loving one another because only divine love will make it over in that dimension hey I don't know you as some we have to feed on constantly love one another love one another we've got to keep feeding on that by God's grace now here's one of the most striking things I heard so far on the sermon but medicine I want you to Kurt turn to Colossians 1 while I read this morning he says now just be as patient as you can so as I preach this just be as patient as you can with me I know I'm gonna be reading a lot of quotes but listen I'm not one that quotes you all the time I don't you know I often know preach like this right what I like to do is I like to read fresh scripture and then I could read new things I've never for preached before and as I read it I let the Holy Spirit bring other scriptures and quotes to my remembrance I like to preach that fresh revelation like with the book of ecclesiastes that's how I like to preach many times not always like I said I can go through the whole church age book I go through the whole book of Ephesians I can go through you know the spoken word original seat all these different messages I've preached on but let's go real slow let's just be real patient and brother have said I feel that in here if God will help me will reveal and bring into your mind all these things that I've talked about on all through the days of the tabernacle now this is from before 1933 brother hams talking about so every saying everything I've done from the tabernacle from the beginning till this point 63 brother am saying all of that he says is why I've said what I've said and why I've done what I've done he said this sermon is why Amen hallelujah so it was let's see 33 43 53 63 over 30 years of the tabernacle he says the reason I'm preaching this message this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed we'll show you why I've done what I've done for 30 years as a prophet hallelujah amen and it's very simple it's not going to go over your head Church it all boils down to this the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost I know yeah praise God you know it's so simple it just boils down to this the reason he ran the tabernacle that way did the reason he had services set up the way did the reason he had brother never preached the Word of God delayed it the reason why he went on the fields and it evangelist his work to spread the message around the world seven times the reason he did that was to reveal Jesus Christ of the people that Christ might live in them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh-huh and now we're beneficiaries because Christ is now living in us in Akron Ohio a day it spread from Jeffersonville to Lima to Akron and here we are today with the same Christ the same holy living in us that lived in God's prophet amen and we're preaching the same word amen and you know like I know too the Holy Ghost will come unless you preach the same word haha amen all the other denominational churches yes they've got miracles they got testimonies but the Holy Ghost doesn't hang around for that long he only hangs around when they finally have a good service and they can get a little annoying thing somebody gets healed somebody gets blessed some like that but then after that they go right back to their old worldly ways and the church said hallelujah the same thing was true when I was growing up I was in a Pentecostal church and we would see the Holy Ghost fall people get healed speaking in tongues interpretations but as soon as we got out of the vehicle people went back to listen to their rock and roll I know I did because I was a sinner people go back to their homes and watch movies and watch sporting events and all these things and waste all this time but when those denominations could get in there and just for a few minutes confess all their sins and give the right sacrifices the Holy Ghost would fall but the Holy Ghost wouldn't remain what am I saying the Holy Ghost should remain with us a day amen because it should not just be an anointing for a little while it should be a seal not to the next revival not to whether James comes back but a seal to the day of your Redemption when you get a new body amen that's the difference Church that's the difference just like my mom got healed my momma cancer but then she goes back and cuts her hair and the Bible says God don't hear prayers and my mom has told me I love my mom and it's occasions this I don't have a problem of that but she's told me herself she said I don't know why God healed me of cancer but then when I pray for so many people God don't hear my prayers I've had my old mom tell me that it's really striking but it shows that the anointing is there for a while but then when they disobey the word God can't bless that amen I know that's rough I know that's my own dear mother the one I love the one that nursed me and the one that had me on her lap and just and raised I know that's but but church this is the word we're talking about this is eternal life we're talking about they get an anointing and it lasts for the lahu good service good service and they go back out and live like the world we've got to live like Christ all the time not just in the service at a whole we got to make sacrifices the pleasing unto Christ all the time we want to feels presence everywhere we go that's what should make us different so this sermon is brother I'm explaining why he's done everything he's done at brendham tavern Oh hallelujah now it's one of the most amazing statements I've heard in a long time from brother Brennan because there's also simple so see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the key to everything it's the only way to have Christ live through you to manifest his word and see this is proves to me that's why I live preaching is more powerful than playing the tape playing the tape can be powerful but that's not God's provided way God's from by the ways through live preachers because that's what the Holy Spirit led brother Evan do for all of his days upon this earth amen that's exactly right oh just a little update after we left voice of God brother air and said you know you should contact those remember I preached out a little bit on the jeffersonville he said you should contact that brother well I put out on my to-do list but I've been so busy but that's the thing I love about to-do lists the electronic ones I never lose it it always stays on there so I eventually got to it this week and I text are emailed the voice of God and I got ahold of Gentlemen and today I sent him the quotes that we made disagreed on and I said him a link I put a link in there here's my sermon if you want to listen to a preacher I don't know if they will because they don't listen to brother Branham but maybe God open their hearts but see that's that's the one thing church that we've got to do we've got to have so much love if we see somebody in there we should say God lead me to try to help them lead me to try to help them it may take three months but in your heart if you want to help somebody God's gonna help you help them August September October four months four months if you've got a burn if you want to do something good if you want to help somebody Church God is going to help you do it because that's God's heart what if we just would've walked and say walked away and say it on a bunch of a bunch of people under false doctrine oh who cares about their who cares about their souls we care about their souls we care about people we want to see people set free hey there's a lot of good churches over there by Jefferson mill I can't remember the name of the church but there's one there in Kentucky Louisville yeah there's a really good Church there brother Brooks has preached there I can't think of them the minister's name right now but they got a really good church over there and produced some ober giuse Burgess there's a church in Louisville a pastors name is Burgess last name beautiful wonderful church that loves the Lord there's a lot of churches you know there's so there's a lot of that believe there's a lot that don't but we know we want to be the believers praise God now brother Branham starts this sermon with something you're very familiar with most of you he begins by talking about God's secret before the world began he goes over what happened in God's mind before the foundation of the world he said now back in the beginning before the world began in the back part of God's mind so picture that the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so God's in the back of the mind thinking I just want to express myself I've got so many desires in here I want to show people I had he too made him yet he's but I want to show people this in the back of his mind I want to show people all that's in my heart amen he said because first there wasn't even a moon a star had a molecule anything he was God but he wasn't exactly God at this time because he wasn't being worshiped yet now church Danka don't get it wrong he was God but he just wasn't being worshiped some people misunderstand that quote oh he wasn't God well what was it what was he then if he wasn't God what could he be he had to be God but he just wasn't being fully worship like a God should be worshiped so brother Ham said to the first thing of my opinion he made was angels he said God in his great mind one of these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be father and it was to be son and it was to be Savior in him what it was to be healer all these great attributes that we are that we see how hard to express they were in God praise God now he says now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfold itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you you see on I believe what is being done so by preaching this sermon brother Aaron was telling us what was in mine and then now that we can figure out what's in God's mind we can see what's being done today an acronym ahead oh yeah hey man so at the conclusion of this tonight we should know what God wants to be done in Akron Ohio and I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna get close to finish it but we should know what what is God trying to do in Akron Ohio because that's what he says you'll see what's being done right now now brother Branham is talking about how God's great mysteries are secret and he kept it a secret he said nobody know nothing about it now even the Angels didn't understand he said that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there were silence in heaven for a space of a half-hour and the seven thunders under their voices and John was even forbidden to ride at sea the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't alright so Bertram says God still has secrets aren't you glad God's hiding that from the devil there's a lot of preachers that want to know - I know well they're after me so then I can live like a devil until the rapture comes oh that's not how we live though we're ready all the time for the rapture I'm ready tonight amen hallelujah I'm not waiting to get my life right well in 2019 or every year somebody preaches like or somebody makes it sound like well the Lord's coming this year the Lord's and they all try to make these predictions to get people to believe them and try to try to make themselves look more spiritual listen church well we're not being more spiritual when we make false predictions we're being less spiritual we're trying to move the people by fear and set up by love what we should do is try to move the people and say how much you love Jesus now how many will love Jesus more praise God it should move where we're not trying to scare people in the rapture we're trying to get people to love God into the rapture it's a that's gonna put you in the rapture outfit here it's love and we've got to learn to love Jesus even though we don't know that they're our we've just got to love that he's coming back amen it's exactly right so God still got these secrets and he's not telling nobody he didn't even tell his son Jesus because the but that's what Jesus said the son himself don't even know the rapture the Angels don't know God likes to keep secrets Oh hallelujah thank you Jesus oh my now program said God's goal God's goal in the back of his mind to express himself but the RAM said is in every type that's in the Bible so in every type of the Old Testament you will see God's goal which there's a three part goal will read it in a little bit from brother branham petrm said he has showed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ that's why brother Aaron sister Connie I can preach on Ecclesiastes and people might say well look on the internet go to sleep on that one or maybe they'll say oh look at the title Ecclesiastes that's the Old Testament that has nothing to do with us but program says the mystery of God is hidden in every book of the Bible that's why I can take the book of Ecclesiastes and it might not seem it means reached or it might not seem very much but in Ecclesiastes is part of the mystery of God and I hope you saw as we preached Ecclesiastes amen which is what fear the Lord amen fear God keep his commandments that's what we see from Ecclesiastes everything is temporal except the word Amen that's what the conclusion of the preachers don't put your don't invest all in these temporal things invest put your time energy or your money everything that you have put everything into the gospel of Jesus Christ very mad he says the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of the one goal God had one purpose he wouldn't achieve in the entire Bible all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is and now this last day he's revealed it and shows it and by God's help we'll see it this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it ah ha ha ha and this is one servant we should be able to see everything that God is in except for the secrets right we never see everything God had in his mind about wanting to express himself oh my thank you lord now the first scripture brother Ram preaches is Luke 24 so let's go there of course you know it clashes one is this text you know that let's go to Luke 20 look 24 so the very first scripture he references Luke chapter 24 let me get the verse now the road to Emmaus you know the story this is after the resurrection on Sunday the Resurrection Sunday Jesus steps out and he begins walking with Cleophus and his friend and the Bible says as they were going along Jesus stepped out and he talked sauce talk starts to ask him what's what's going on now in verse 25 now look how he talks to believer look how Jesus the resurrected Jesus in a perfect glorified body that looks like a human body except it's glorified look how he talks to them in verse 32 25 and then he said to them o fools wait did I read that right Oh beautiful bride precious Gentile or sorry Jewish bride of the message of the hours that how he says it to them Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken art not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all there it is SOTA have says all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself little Bram said in the book of st. Luke 2:24 tapped err we find out Jesus stepped out on their road to Emmaus he says and they were going along their weeping and he stepped down and began to talk to them about Christ what was he doing identifying himself to these apostles that all the prophets all the Psalms everything was him expressed amen glory Jesus in order to get them to see who he was he's got to point them back to the word because the word the Old Testament word tells them who Jesus is amen hallelujah so we see Jesus in Ecclesiastes I'll just keep stay on that one we see Jesus in there that everything we're going to do is going to come under judgment remember the Bible said every idle word that spoken will come under judgment I'll remember that every idle word so guess what we better when we pray at night we better say Lord forgive me of every idle word I spoke at us and then it'll be under the blood because people people that don't confess that will answer to God for every idle word that they spoken every single idle word God forgive us now amen Jesus forgive us Jesus of every idle word geez don't baby around say oh you precious message believers that oh yeah I love you so much and you're just you're just so sweet and kind and he says Oh fools and isn't that red-letter where's church see God is a God of grace but he's also God who demands responsibility praise God I did everybody hear the testimony from Brenda anybody hear that on Sunday night Brenda had a good testimony Brenda was here on Sunday night we prayed for remember we pray for a few weeks ago and she we pray that God would give her a full healing well a couple a little while after we prayed for a few days afterwards she was sitting down and felt awful and she was feeling awful and it didn't look like she was gonna get her healing she said all of a sudden she walked in and told my wife she said I had a Holy Ghost I had a Pentecostal Holy Ghost experience I like that I like that the Holy Ghost just isn't speaking here he goes home with us amen hallelujah that's what we're talking about the Pentecostals in denomination they don't have that they just try to get God there they're there but see God goes home us amen and she said she was so down and discursive she said all of a sudden something echoed out of heaven and it said rise up and receive your healing hey and she saw her face she was tell me she's she said I went like this I was like is that you Lord she didn't know so she just tried to stand and she said as she stood all the energy came back in her body and all the all the seizures left Karen said she hasn't had a seizure for two weeks straight amen after daily seizures all these things the Holy Spirit we prayed and said God give her the victory and she testified back there and said God's going to heal me completely she just had to wait a little while and the Holy Spirit begin to answer her prayer amen now why do I say that because she's believing the word and to show you that God's among us we just got to create the atmosphere praise God we got to take this anointing home we got to take it everywhere we go praise God amen and now did you see she didn't she didn't have the the Walker now she was on a cane and she's a pretty soon I'm gonna put this up for sale she said now let's watch and see God do it because only Jesus Christ can do that ha ha ha hey man she looks so cleared in her face and her mom or she looks last time you know she looks all tired everything she looked great and after constant seizure she hadn't had one for two weeks that's the God we serve that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ amen ceased of God is God was like he said rise up receive your here now she had a choice she could have stayed down said all that was just there's just noises that's his noises and Karen said she screamed and shouted for fifteen to twenty minutes amen I didn't yeah he said I had my Pentecostal Jubilee I like that praise God amen see that's our God our God reigns amen he wants to express himself as a healer amen remember when we pray for out there remember we pray for her and I told you about she said she felt angel's wings around her she was passed out in a seizure and I went pray there I said amen let's go pray for and as soon as I said Amen she opened her eyes and then I started talking about GC start thanking me for preaching the Word of God bragging on Jesus and all these things and saying how close she's got to God since she came to our church and Karen asked her about later she said she didn't remember one of it she didn't remember any of that so was the Holy Spirit speaking right through her to me amen she don't remember because it was God anointing her to speak and all she was saying was testimonies about how good God how good God is and how God was gonna heal her and just a few short days after that God began healing her praise God amen let's be mindful of whose presence were in tonight there's no none of us that's important it's our Lord Jesus that's important not even that picture but I just pointed that picture so we'll think about his Holy Spirit among us praise God God's here in our prayers Church we just got to be sweet and loving to everybody we just got to make sure the devil don't annoy just inject us with some poison right so Steve Jesus to get clear pissed to see who he was pointed him back to the Old Testament word but when he talks about how the Psalms I'll speak of Jesus my God my God why hast thou forsaken me in Psalm 22 now brother Ram breaks off from there and he he starts preaching on how God hides his thoughts from the scholars only the predestinated hear the word of God amen glory Lorain have said so see the very thought that God had in his mind he said he hid from all those scholars just a number a selected predestinated number of predestinated people was the only ones that heard it and I searched back down to the scripture that through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same thing Korie amen he said in Jesus this time though he said those Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law the professors had did exactly like they've done before they had the Psalms they had the prophets and still they missed Jesus Christ for their day program quotes Jesus in John 5:43 he said searchy the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me amen how many one know Jesus search the Scriptures right jesus said if you would know me search the Scriptures because they testify of me amen that's why we every that's why we always preach the word and my man says you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is God Jesus declaring the same that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God the Word made flesh amen so when I'm preaching Ecclesiastes I'm preaching part of the word I'm preaching part of Christ and it's revealing the mind of God you and I how many can say amen to that no matter which scripture I preach over any preacher it's revealing to you part of the mind of God and you get to know God a little better praise God he says everything has got to come back to the word that's why all these movements today don't come back to the word making certain people prophets take them preachers out of the pulpits you never find that in the word so that's not part of Christ mind that's the part of a man's thinking not part or men or women that's not part of the word so what do we love more do we love people more you love the learn more all of our allegiance is to the Word of God that's why we don't add to the word we don't take anything away from the word program said the pattern of the book of Acts and st. Paul will always remain the pattern until Jesus Christ comes in the rapture amen it's not gonna change it's the same yesterday today and forever oh my thank you lord now the RAM said oh it looks like it can't be any plainer search the scriptures he said Moses and all the laws all the prophets all the Psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him hey hallelujah now I think what I'll do because I'm seeing that clock let me yeah let me let me go through this here only the predestinated will see it how many believe you're a predestinated child of God hallelujah how come you can see it and your favorite or maybe your friends or family couldn't see it how come you can see it because your predestinated it's always a small group God chose you how come the word means so much to you now when before did it mean anything to you why does it do that because you're one of God's children you were in his mind you were part of that word before the foundation of the world hallelujah thank you Jesus amen that's not skim milk to me that's steak and eggs to me that's neat that's rich I never heard that growing up in denominational church that God chose me in Christ before the foundational world you never heard that before until God sent a prophet event and God keeps telling us that so it encouraged us to live like the word because we came from the word and we're going back to the word program said he is the principal theme of the entire Bible so see I'm getting this a most of our favorite quotes right if you read the Bible don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again thank you Lord huh so I can preach on Ecclesiastes chapter four or five or six or seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and if you don't see Christ in it you need to go back to read again that's right church he says because you've missed something how many would be honest to say sometimes I miss things yeah amen my hands are up - amen double amen for me I miss things he says the Bible is Christ he's the word when you read it in the beginning God created there's Christ he says from the Amen - revelation 22 every word testifying of Jesus Christ that's why these added books of the they call the second book of daniel in the book of macabees and the purgatory it's not spoke of in the rest of the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to find purgatory in there there's no place in for the intercession of saints and these things there's no place in there for that there's no place for denomination there's no place for Creed's outside the Bible so when you see these things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people's added those and they're jigsaw puzzles all mixed up see they can't make it right the same yesterday today and forever on oh yeah aren't you glad when you come to church you get to come to church and you're jigsaw puzzle it's all laid out there and every piece is in perfect order you know most people come to church and it's like the preacher just poured out the jigsaw boxes and all the pieces just scatter all over and say okay Church here's your picture of Jesus they didn't cut their hair in the Old Testament but you can cut it now women they never paid in their face in the whole Bible but you could eat your face and that's what their jig that's their jigsaw puzzle if the piece of just all laid out and said here's a beautiful picture of Christ but you and I can come to church and every piece fits perfectly the Old Testament dispensation of flowing in the New Testament or the same god of grace the abominations of cross-dressing is still Bominable today praise God amen it fits together perfectly because he's the same yesterday today and forever he said I am the Lord God I don't change one bit amen I'm glad my jigsaw puzzle is all placed together by the Holy Spirit that's right he says if the thing is put together right there's an entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation God's whole plan revealed right in Jesus Christ amen he said that's the whole picture set together every little crook and corner he says it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's what I you know that's when I preach on please ask these I don't I keep saying that but I'm just giving examples I didn't understand even the book of Proverbs I didn't understand a lot of that until I preached it and now I can place it by the Holy Spirit and I can understand that I can understand these different things I've read over how come he says we should be misery man's miserable we get the Bible says it's joy unspeakable and full of glory if you put the jigsaw puzzle to the right way you'll see well Solomon was a backslidden King that's why he's depressed about life but you and I have Jesus promise Jesus says he says I'm leaving my joy with you now I'm not leaving SAW with you do not despair he said but have joy because I've overcome later the CIA men never to see I praise God he promised it he said I'm leaving my joy with you Malachi amen he said I'm leaving Lydia of leaving you my joy says you don't want to be despair you don't to be discouraged I believe in you joy you just got to receive it when when my wife and I leave Christmas presents we just don't let him sit there we say okay now is the time to go get him open him up Jesus has all these presents for us we just got to open them up we just gotta wait to the hallways ripp says now is the time to receive your healing amen now it's the time to understand the win of God for your life now is the time to make a move about this now is the time because remember our children are really good about about it as far as I know I don't see them cutting out the wrapping paper to peek in there at least I've never caught him and if I catch you I'm gonna tell you to tape it back up but see God that's how it is like God we got to wait to the time the right time as soon as we say okay let's start with the young let's start with the young ones and then when pretty soon it's a Katia's turn and it's Lydia mauka they all get their turn and there's time to open it up and that's what we have to do with God's Word it's time for this word to open up to us amen and let me tell you some of these scriptures have to open up for us to get a body change to go in the rapture praise God it's already written here it's not gonna be something outside the way or something over our head it's already written here we've just got to open up and let the Holy Spirit open up these great presence in his word amen we just gotta let God tell us it's time to open up that word for the rapture it's time for a body change and the church said no get me wrong it'll be right on time it'll be right on time I know people have brothers try to peek in and try to make guests as a whole I think I know what that is that's a GI Joe set and the whole time it may be say it's like pair of jeans or something like that they're just trying to make these guesses Oh remember the one we read remember the one we read earlier at the beginning this year about how they said 27 2018 is 70 years for since Israel has been a nation and that online preacher he made it sound like this is the time the 144,000 are coming back now he's got about two months to make his prediction right and I can hope that quote I know where it is that I know which I know it is in my church age series and they put all these pressure see it's at 70 years God's going back to the Jews this year is it what if it comes and goes and it's not just giving people false hope just guessing all these guesses but God is not a guesser God's not like I wonder if Jesse would like to hear the message or not I wonder brother Aaron would want to receive the Word of God I wonder if Connie does believe in healing and I wonder if she'll receive that or not God's not sitting there wonder God knows and so because he knows he predestined that you'll receive all this presence amen almost said Christmas presents but we know every day is Christmas for us hallelujah worshiping Jesus every day you see oh I'm so glad our pictures not ruined by denominational things because you know when I was going to church you know they told me when I was growing up their picture like putting an elephant on top of a tree they said well you can speak in tongues as long as you speak in tongues then you got the Holy Ghost then you can be a part of our church and then even if you fall away you're still saved because you spoke in tongues as long as you spoke in a tongue you're saved you can live like a devil you're still safe because you spoke in tongues oh that's a bunch of tommyrot that's a bunch of jigsaw pieces scattered all over the place that's why when I sat in that first meeting I was about 19 years old I just gave my heart to the Lord and I heard that and I ask a question I said well what about this to that they said well that's the passivation said that's just what we believe i sat there that day when I said I'm never coming back here I'm not doing this Church and I didn't even know the message yet was that it's sure there was some seed already in me praise God amen there's some seed that was that was rejecting something that was outside the word because that seed is the word of God amen it was a dormancy just waiting to be quickened by the message of the hour holiday yeah so even at that age I don't even know the message I couldn't give into that because there was something inside of me said that puzzle is all out of whack just like you can look at a puzzle and say all that piece is wrong look how the cow it'll say look how Haven or character look how well the little ones trying to jam that piece in there oh look it's all dead no it's not something's wrong with that it needs fix and these fixed by somebody who understands how to put the puzzle together to make the picture look right and that person is here tonight he's the Holy Ghost amen he's the only one who could interpret his word hallelujah that's exactly right he said that's why we got pictures today that looks horrible that's a horrible looking picture well Graham said an elephant sitting on standing on top of a oak tree or something like that can you imagine that you might see that in dr. Seuss book but you won't see that in real life I showed you what kind of dr. neck I had a jigsaw puzzle was all mixed up that's right he says they say we're believers and the cow is picking grass up in the top of the tree that don't work then they say yeah he's every way but just a certain he's the same yesterday today forever all but a certain thing then you ruin your picture well God used to require that God doesn't require that anymore but the Bible said he's the same well he was he wasn't that age he says there you got your picture wrong wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish in a bunch of hot sand where there's no fish in huh yeah Oh searches we were raised and that's what the picture they were giving they've got you out in the boat fishing in the desert say here fishy fishy fishy fishy fishy all pretty soon we're gonna catch the big one we're gonna go in the rapture let me put my sis let me uh knock off the ashes off my cigarette real quick oh but I spoke in tongues or I prophesied or I got slaying the spirit so I'm good I'm gonna have a little social drink I'll go to rock n roll party that's okay cuz I I spoke in tongues now I keep using that so sister yeah take any offense of that but because I know you speak in tongues but don't take any offense of that I'm just using examples well I got slain the spirit or I had blood come out of my palms like my man said they had a a a ons meetings he would say no that's the evidence now blood coming out of the palm can you imagine that program disagreed in a kind way but what they're doing is saying oh we're gonna go in the rapture we're the true Church of God or the true Bride of Christ and they're fishing in a desert oh my well you and I were fishing in a lake and thank God we caught some rainbow trout here in Akron amen thank God we cast a little read out there and a little fishy named van gang caught on to it I should say a big trout rather I'm sorry not a little fishy a big trout he's probably listening right now cuz he live streams aren't services so brother Hank no laugh too hard don't don't mess up your job there I don't want to get in trouble for losing a thousand dollars on your tool piece there but we throw it we went fishing in a river amen I'll say that this it's the rivers of life ha yeah amen I was fishing the rivers of life and divine caught it but then he he said Amen come over here hear the word of God and through it again and it caught bang amen hallelujah and God brought that rainbow fish right into my boat amen and now we got some other ones because of that glory it's exactly right you got to make the picture look right he said it's God's great picture there's only one way you'll see it that's when you see Jesus Christ there's the entire Bible he's the principal theme of the Bible now let me close with this I'm just gonna close right here let me do three more paragraphs he's the principal theme of the Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's the book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ and he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he was also in the Bible is the thing that is to come amen Larry so Jesus was past present future he's everything in the Bible amen and when you inject something there that doesn't make him the same yesterday today and forever he said brother Lee where'd he go to you got an awful picture there he was the history he's the prophet he's the Psalms he's everything and if you can't make him everything in the same they're what your picture look like you see all right is Jesus Christ Church is he the same yesterday today and forever is he the same today amen then we need to have more faith in our lives to see more of him praise the Lord we've got to he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms he was in the history he isn't things that come the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 he should be then he should be the principle if that's what he is we believe it don't we then he now here's the standoff here I'm gonna cook let's say no Fe listen let's dismiss is beautiful let's go through this he should be the principal theme of our talking our thinking our singing of our walks for the RAM says he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of the Bible and the Bible's in us then he should be the principal theme of everything we do say or think should be Christ a is that beautiful church some of these quotes we've heard for all these years some of the most beautiful quotes come right out of here he's the principal theme of all of our lives now let me just close with this thought brother branham said that God in his mind had a three-fold purpose to express himself and you probably know it but listen anyway the first was to reveal himself fully through Jesus Christ the church guess what it took 4,000 years for him to accomplish that first purpose he's so patient just took him four days because that one day with the Lord as the thousand years with man scepter four days he finally accomplished his purpose and fully expressed himself in Jesus Christ now his second purpose program said is for God to live in the people that they'll give him preeminence and he's been doing that for the last two days and his third purpose was to bring his bride back to the Eden conditions they had at the beginning praise God and he says Baretta says this is why I've run the tabernacle why have for thirty years because this is God's purpose and right now what does God trying to do right now is he trying to get permits in Christ right now no he's already got that what's he trying to do now he's trying to get preeminence in our lives he wants to fully express himself in each one of our lives how much you come look the piano here how many enjoy this tonight we just got through the first maybe 40 minutes of the sermon there's for our sermon oh it's so beautiful now with that in mind how many want to see more of Christ in our myths praise God we should never get tired of say in that church I honestly my heart I don't get tired of saying that I always want to see more of Christ think about we've said that for years and think about now we just heard Sunday that now God is talking to people right in their homes they're getting healed right in their homes amen more we want to see them more in our lives I want to go home and I want to hear my children say the Lord spoke to me in a dream I heard the voice of God how do you want to hear that praise the Lord we want to hear more we want to see more of the Word of God we want Christ to be the principal theme of everything we say all day he's the theme behind it everything we do all of our Christian walk he should be the theme behind all of it when I go to teach the real the theme hi my teaching is to present Jesus Christ to the children when I come to church and preach my desire my theme behind that is the preach to you Jesus Christ when I go home kiss the children goodnight my theme behind that is to present them Jesus Christ babe glory and this is our desire aren't you glad your pictures all placed together right thank you [Music] hallelujah no puzzles puzzles can be very frustrating can't they especially a thousand Peter but you just give a little time just keep looking at the the completed picture keep looking at the box cover and start finding those patterns and pretty soon you'll start seeing the patterns that's what I do when I read the Bible I read over there in Ecclesiastes that's an interesting pattern I look over there to the the picture of Jesus Christ ah I can see what's happening there I understand now yes fearing God keeping the commandments that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost did you catch that on Sunday the whole conclusion of man the whole conclusion is to fear God and keep his Commandments you and I can't keep any word unless we're born to get amen we'll never keep all the Word of God we'll never fear God all the days of our life we're born again it's the principle theme with the Bible Jesus Christ is the principal theme in the Bible probably want to be the principal theme of your day tomorrow me too I want to be the principal theme of tomorrow this weekend services another bender on next Wednesday night I want to be the principal theme of next Wednesday night all the preaching all the singing is to do one thing to worship Jesus to make it more go in our lives let's bow our heads if you had a need just make it known unto God Heavenly Father we just bow our heads Lord Lord you're the principal theme of our lives the principal theme of this church Lord God the principal theme of our thoughts right now our songs we're going to sing you're the whole purpose behind it and not to hear how good our voices sound we didn't come here to hear about how good we are we came to hear about your promises amen your word your grace to us as we know we're all wretched of our own ability we're all sinners but we are all saved by your amazing grace amen Alleluia our picture Lord is placing you Lord at the very centre everything's lined up perfectly we see we're in the Laodicean Church age we're see we're at the very end we see we're in a lukewarm age that's rich Ms Brown increased with Goods and hasni to nothing but we're the ones that have repented were the ones who are zealous repented and were the ones that are hungry
