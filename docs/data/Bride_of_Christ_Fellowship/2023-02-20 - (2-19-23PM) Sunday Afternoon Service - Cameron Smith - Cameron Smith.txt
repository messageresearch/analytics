[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] we're on the right path aren't we hey man you like how the Lord inhabits that amen he likes they were walking up the highway amen we're going to try to sing that song If we can I command my hands uh praise the Lord and you know one thing I'm going to say is I actually sung that at a concert so what it was went to Louisiana Camp there's a bunch of British people there and they taught us in the middle of the street down there and when they would do it they say I come in my feet to praise the Lord and sure enough when I when I sung that on that CD for the South Carolina meetings the Holy Ghost so took me I was just dancing the whole time and and that's that's what's beautiful about it because you know the the Lord can anoint you to do that too amen so sometimes just looking to see if you can get by yourself so we'll see if we can do this if the Lord would be pleased there I command my hands to praise the Lord [Music] foreign [Music] here we go you've got to praise [Music] Hallelujah ladies [Music] doctor friends Hallelujah [Music] they'll be dancing Over Yonder Mr brother Brooks when you need him amen we'll go and get into the word of God this evening sister Eden my big sister nature they took me aside and they said are you teaching tonight and I was just going to preach but I didn't preach this morning but uh I think what I'm going to try to do I'm going to try to teach them if you sisters do want to come up here and sit so I'm going to kind of teach it it's a little bit deeper but if you have any questions your pastor is here to answer those while I do this [Laughter] so if you have a question it's almost like a little school room so you can just raise your hand and we'll give we'll give the pastor the opportunity to do that and uh perhaps if uh he wants to pass it on to me however he wants to do it that's fine but uh I'm going to teach something and uh this subject right here is another subject to me that validates that this message is right it validates that the word of God Is Right and it shows me that this message will produce what it said it would produce just like we were saying this morning if the word says it we can believe it we can punctuate it with an amen whether it materializes right intermitts right at that time or not we can say I believe it's mine and we stay right there until God gives it to us amen I don't know about you I believe that Hallelujah so uh Revelations 4 verse 1. got a lot of I got a lot of pictures here and I'm gonna I'm gonna run this right through the scripture so this actually has a very important Heavenly meaning and then it has a very important uh meaning for you as well if you can see the picture okay so it's pretty simple if he young has got any questions we'll see what we can do brother Jesse and ran out of the room so he's probably prepping up to give all the answers and uh we'll see what the Lord will do all right so this is a very powerful portion of Revelations here and it's very particular to us because this is following Revelations two and three working with the church ages right so and I had a sister amen it's great to see you sis amen so Revelations 4 1. now watch this here after this I looked right after the church ages and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will shoe the things which must be here after so this spot right here come up hither brother Branham said that that was a type of the rapture come up hither it follows the church ages and what right as because what we're in the the very end of the seventh Church age the next thing is is we're going to meet him in the air come up hither okay and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne so I guess I could propose the question is that where will we be right after we are raptured we will go to the throne of God all right no questions for the pastor yet that's good all right so one more spot Revelations 4 6. well these young has got their Bibles out Glory wonderful I don't know about you I'm really looking forward to this you're getting ready to get caught right up to the throne of God uh but I want you to see that this is this is something that we put out here but if you watch the concept is completely through the scripture and that's what we're going to go into today with this little teaching okay Revelations 4 6 and it says Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne so in the middle of the throne that word mitts in the in the midst of a throne and round about the throne so in the middle of the throne and then round above the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind four beasts so if you could picture it and we'll see in just a minute here the actual visualization of what heaven looks like right now okay and it says the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so how so children how many beasts were there four okay and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they're full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come they don't even need rest you know why because they're in the presence of God so I wonder if we could be in the presence of God what that would do and that's what I'm saying that that takes away the fatigue how in the world could Paul dispute in a temple and and persuade all day long and then go make tents all night long he must have had a presence so worship is very key to these things all right so let's bow our heads forward a prayer and then we'll get right into this little teaching Lord Jesus we love you we appreciate this opportunity and Lord as we have now commanded by the word that you put in our mouths we've came in at our hands we've commanded our our feet we've command our body we've commanded our mind to come under subjection to this word Lord we pray right now God that this little atmosphere that we just talked about this heavenly place oh God would settle down in the midst of here Lord and that Lord is we want to be illuminated by Thy word that Lord you'd surely just bring us a teaching bring us an understanding o god of the of the Heavenly realm of God that we can actually put our hands on Lord that we can know God that that this is actually deeper and richer than we ever thought and we believe that you'll do it today so Lord we're just commending ourselves to that I pray oh God if it be thy will or just anoint the children for any questions that they might have and we will surely rejoice as the answers unfold in the name of Jesus Christ that church says together amen may be seated so children as I'm I'm going through this if you have any questions I think brother Jesse said the adults could even ask questions but if anyone has any questions just slow me down I'm going to try to leave my normal really quick pace and I'm going to slow down okay but we want to teach this uh the best that we can in order to show you the picture uh here in an opening slide and obviously you can get on the internet and find a lot of these things online but we find that that Throne scene in The Book of Revelations 4 it talks about how you have 24 Elders around the Throne of God and that's what John's seen right but if you notice here you got a beast here a beast here a beast here and a beast here I'm going to show you the relevance of this in just a minute and I'm going to keep unfolding it to you so you can see this beautiful picture that God has in his word but uh I want you to notice that God is always surrounded he wants beings angels zoons he wants to be surrounded by those that love him Hallelujah amen so you know what's our purpose is to surround God who loves us yes Haven two both oh pastor physical manifestation yes remember they're in a dimension where nothing oh brother Jesse [Laughter] now you have to remember like I mentioned this morning is that in that Dimension that dimension of Heaven is there bore is there boredom there so let me ask you another question is there any uh fatigue or tiredness there no so they can actually you know like how we would worship Oh Glory to God you know I command my feet and we're there's nothing to hinder that in them so it's just part of the dimension that they're in is they can keep on without any negative thing to slow them down they just keep and stay in that atmosphere to worship okay all right now I got a lot to say about this so uh I'm going to answer that question too okay so I want to show you what remember we're going to be working with four thrown guards okay so here is actually probably the closest depiction of what those four beasts that surrounded the throne are okay you notice we have calf's feet you notice we have six wings just like seraphim okay and what we notice is that each Beast had four heads and within that we have here children what do we have here a lion what do we have here a man what do we have back here Ox good job what do we have there Eagle I gotta end with the eagle okay but uh it says God has four Throne guards in his kingdom these are uh the lion the ox man Eagle as stated in Revelations 4 7 and Ezekiel 1 10. uh catch the Revelation regarding these beasts notice that these four beasts are represented in heaven that's what we're talking about in heaven and also in the Old Testament and in the New Testament and even in the new Heaven and Earth uh they now what do they do they raise up God's standards against the devil in every generation of the seven Church ages okay and we won't talk too much about that um but we're going to lay out the pattern so if you can see the pattern then you can really see how this affects you okay yep yep yep but now um and and this is just my my presumption Pastor helped me if you differ but uh it is denoted in the Book of Revelations that each one had a different face forward as far as you have an eagle you have an ox you have a man and you have uh of course the lion so I would say by looking at the scripture that it denotes that um specifically what each one had but yet they all had all four so I guess in that idea is that this one have this but you go to the next one and he would have the man perhaps now that's just a presumption because but I'm just doing that by the scripture as far as how it denotes each one had a different one but yet all had all four which I'm going to [Laughter] good job pastor so another picture of the Throne of God very quickly here um and this is uh brother Ron malevo and there you have the throne scene you have 24 Elders surrounding can I ask the children you want your question first and mine to you yes yes and that's that's what we're getting ready to show very good very good how did you know that glory to God great um so in having each Beast stands for something okay they're surrounding the throne and of course they're called The Throne guards so if they're called a throne guard what are they actually doing they're guarding the throne okay now watch uh back in the Book of Ezekiel a little bit of reading here but here it is as your pastor denoted here in Ezekiel 1 4 it says and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the out of the North a great Cloud I like that came out of the north north is where Dan was right and a fire unfolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire what does the amber color represent of course we realized that was a pillar of fire okay so ezekiel's having uh this unfold him in the spiritual realm he's seeing all these things coming forth he sees the Amber Pillar of Fire coming out okay now here's the thing did that pillar Fire come by itself let's see it says also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures so notice that Amber Pillar of Fire was once again just like in the scene of Heaven surrounded okay now watch this and uh came four living creatures and this was their appearance that they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot that's where we get a cast foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they forehead their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went and they went everyone straight forward I want you to see this so when when this Entourage if I could say it like that was guarding God they didn't get distracted by anything they never turned aside it says right there they turned not when when they went they didn't get distracted by anything they had one Mission and that was to surround God Hallelujah now if you think about it that's why we are not to be distracted we are supposed to go straight forward with Jesus Christ remember if you would look at the type or think about the type you have Elijah and Elisha Elisha had to have his eyes solely on Elijah which was a type of Christ he could not turn any other way but he had to keep his eyes solely on Elijah or a type of Christ The Bride In Christ and what following that then he would get the double portion blessing Okay so he says and for the likeness of their faces the four had the face of a man the face of a lion on the right side and they forehead the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle okay so perhaps that was the the normal faces thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upwards two wings of everyone and were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went everyone straight forward there it is again wither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went all right so wherever the spirit went they went I want you to see this God has always left the witness that he has guards around him this is what I want you to see because you're going to find out pretty quick that this actually comes really close to home okay there's another rendition or idea of what that might be as depicted um I can't wait to see it I don't know about you it's going to be a really good time so we see the setup and here remember it was stated by brother Ron there that in the Old Testament this was seen okay so when they had the Tabernacle they were surrounded by four tribes so you have Reuben to the South Judah to the east Ephraim to the west and then Dan to the north now I'm going to show you another picture in a second here and how God orchestrated that in the wilderness he had them surrounding the Tabernacle so think about it so in heaven God has four surrounding when God would leave Heaven as a pillar of fire those four went with him they turned out they just surrounded him to be his guards and here now God has the Tabernacle with the outer Court the holy place and the holies of holies and once again he surrounds himself by four tribes if you look in the Scripture it says to the north to the South to the East and to the West were these tribes now let's show you how amazing this is when God said that they would be to north south east and west he also gave the numbers of the people in the tribes okay here you have your Tabernacle of course they're surrounded by the gershonites the koathites and the marathites marathites but notice the numbers that were given in the scripture so dance to the north so Judas to the east but look to the east you have 186 000. watch the ratio okay to the north yet Dan 157. to the that's the north so the South was 151. so almost equal this way and then down here there's 30 000 more and then to the North or to the excuse me to the it's East West to the West Was 108 000. you almost have perfectly set up the cross but notice God didn't have them to the Northwest he had him to the north he had him to the South came to the East and to the West so you see that God actually surrounded so wait what was in there the Ark of the Covenant what was there God so God guarded himself with the 12 tribes of Israel north south east and west but what does that look like the cross so Jesus even shown the same picture when he was on the cross so even as he come to his crucifixion he showed that what would he was surrounded by the wood and the ordered church right so this is pretty phenomenal if you ask me but so you see in the Old Testament what was it God always had to be guarded okay let's continue you see that children that's pretty neat huh so in heaven he's like that on Earth he's like that when he's on a cross he was like that is that all right even says no there's more when the ark remember the Tabernacle you would take it down you would take the ark and the Ark would have to be what it couldn't be carried on a new cart which is a type of denomination it actually had to be carried on the shoulders of the priest so God made the ark to have staves through it how many priests were to carry it four were three on this side one on this side no it was equally spread that there would be four guards around that Ark so where was this that was the presence of God was there yeah right the presence of God was so strong in there that Joshua could send the art through the Jordan River and it would split the river just like Moses did with the Red Sea the ark could do that the ark was a type of what the word who is the word god so he's always guarded by four okay that's neat I wonder if there's any more is that called irony we'll see what the prophet says in the fifth seal he says now one of those creatures we find out in studying the Revelation in the churches that one of them had was the lion the other was Ox the other was a man the other was an eagle we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the acts of the Apostle just the way that the Tabernacle in the wilderness okay so the things that we just seen in the Old Testament that actually continued on into the New Testament okay now let's see where we go next let's read another one okay we'll add a little bit more momentarily it says now we find out that there were the guards to The Mercy Seat they watched The Mercy Seat and nothing come to it it crossed over the tribes first before it could get to The Mercy Seat so nothing could ever get near The Mercy Seat I want you to see this because there's nothing that can get near The Mercy Seat in your life that's the way God made this amen amen what does that mean that means you can always believe in the blood of Christ Jesus Christ the sacrifice the atonement has been made and there's nothing that can touch it you can always believe in the blood see you can fail all the time but that Mercy Seat can never be touched that's why the Bible says if any man fail the grace of God you have to fail the grace well how much will he gives he just keeps on giving it until you what you've forfeited you have to forfeit your rights to it that's why there's gonna be a lot of surprises on the Judgment Day because there'll be a lot of people that didn't forfeit that all right so it says every man willing to give his life every Israelite and Camp would die before anything could enter into that camp over there and take that mercy seat and now we find out that that was the Old Testament order in the New Testament order in the New Testament order we find the same thing that it was guarded The Mercy Seat so there's a mercy seat in the New Testament too okay he says oh I hope you get you get it The Mercy Seat is still guarded still got guards okay we found out that those guards are Matthew Mark Luke and John guarding the book of Acts hmm and the acts of the Holy Spirit done amongst the apostles which is the book of Acts of the new Test new of the New Testament and the four writers of the Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John all guard The Mercy Seat to show that it is God the Holy Spirit today each scripture Matthew Mark Luke and John every one of them will back up the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and the acts of the Holy Spirit that's when you know the message is real so in the New Testament we still have now we'll get to this in just a second but notice we have John mark Matthew and Luke we still have guards in the New Testament now notice here the Holy Spirit baptism okay so it's still surrounded but now God is taking residence somewhere else in in the Old Testament children did God actually fill as far as the Holy Ghost baptism into the people the sacrifice was not made yet so I would say no I know it's a little bit deep [Laughter] so let's look here so in the New Testament there are still four guards but remember they always say well it's the Acts of the Apostles but it's not the Acts of the Apostles it's actually the acts of the Holy Spirit so now in the New Testament we actually find that the acts of the Holy Spirit are guarded to the north south east and west and what does it guard the gospels guard the book of Acts you ever wonder why there's four Gospels that's why God made four Gospels because God always had to be guarded but where was God actually seen here the book of Acts that's what he's trying to guard here okay now obviously what was made manifest in those gospels Jesus Christ but now he was bridging from the Old Testament become the sacrifice and what he was trying to do was enter into the next part of the work which is and when we went and got the gospels and show exactly when you enter into the ark they was guarding the ark the Covenant and then we find out that the Covenant of the new church its representation on Earth was the Holy Spirit so what's Jesus doing remember he was coming as the Lamb of God to become the sacrifice but what was the purpose of that remember he said it's expedient that I go away so the comforter can come to you I'm going to show you something here okay that's why I love this this message beautiful he says and four beasts represented as the 12 tribes of Israel as it washed and find their natures and take in that same nature and bring it to each one of those four gospels remember if we had time we could go through and show you that the the four main tribes that actually went around the Tabernacle they all had emblems and you know what they were it was the lion the ox the man and the eagle it was the same emblems in the Old Testament to what we would find were the faces of literally what we'd see in the Throne of Heaven by the Beast okay so it says and taking the same nature bring each one to the four gospels exactly was exactly the same one talk to the lion the other the ox the other the four Gospels looks like my slide messed up on me here there it is the four Gospels are the guards I believe it says in the guards to the acts of the Holy Spirit okay so let's continue so the gospels protect the acts of the Holy Spirit now we're saying something now the gospels actually protect the book of Acts well who does the book of Acts belong to you can say me so now I wonder where God is now how do they guard the book of Acts how these gospels going to guard that Revelations chapter 4 3 he says the framework Pentecost wasn't the framework of the Gospels the four Gospels are the framework to back Pentecost so the gospels actually guard the acts of the Holy Spirit okay now watch this it says after they had this framework up Pentecost become into existence so without those gospels coming first you say well start in the New Testament well what do you have you have the four books Matthew Mark Luke and John and then what and the acts of the Holy Spirit okay he says is that right which was wrote first the book of Acts or the apostles the apostles were right so Jesus walked along doing works and predicting what would come and Matthew Mark Luke and John them four guards come and was writing everything they seen coming to pass telling it just like it is how it was going to happen what was going to take place then all at once they framed it around and here it come you see why Jesus said the things he did because the things that he said would actually what he was setting the framework of what the acts of the Holy Spirit would be right it says Matthew Mark Luke and John is the framework or the guard work that protects watch this the main Temple the throne the Pentecostal blessing so first we have what in the New Testament we have the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John and what do they surround the acts of the Holy Spirit but now he's saying that Matthew Mark Luke and John they actually guard the main Temple the throne and what does he call that the Pentecostal blessing which is what the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we sing that song no ye not know ye not ye are a temple know ye not know ye not ER Temple is that just a song or is that a scripture the scripture scripture you are a temple so there was a temple in the Old Testament but who's the temple in the New Testament you are yep yep that's what the Pentecostal so it's the acts of the Holy Spirit so as the Holy Spirit working through those people and what you were going to show you is how Matthew Mark Luke and John how they guard that blessing okay so it's it's all got to work together so now if you are the temple of God where did your Prophet say the The Mercy Seat was at now now how could The Mercy Seat be there because The Mercy Seat is where God is see we we under emphasize what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is okay so girls sisters when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost where does that put God man look at that did you just get that because I said that you already knew that do it you do it well taught so if you're the temple of God you have a holies of holies where God wants to live and that's inside of you now in the Old Testament what could happen in the holies of holies God would what meet them there just like that song God would meet them there he said I will commune with you there so where does God communion where does he want to commune with you inside but wait a minute that's the Pentecostal blessing and he's in the temple of you then how can these guard you that's what we want to know so these gospels will actually guard you now what are these gospels where what are they represented doing bringing forth the word now watch this so we know in the New Testament that there was an order that these beasts would live out through the seven Church ages right they would live out in that same order now I found this absolutely amazing because when I looked up the names and what the meaning of the name meant so the Book of Matthew your Prophet said was the lion you know what Matthew means gift of the Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was the first age where the Holy Ghost fell out upon them now remember the seven Church ages are also represented by a fixture or a furnishing in the Tabernacle on the temple you girls no no let me give you a hint so there's actually a piece of furniture that was in the temple in the Tabernacle that had seven in it kind of like that can you tell me what that was the seven golden candlesticks which represent the seven Church ages yeah now now let me ask you um yes now they're golden candlesticks so what were they supposed to do they're supposed to be lit all day long was the fire supposed to be extinguished no no but it was supposed to burn continually burning and what would that show because what was it what was it actually burning oh oil which was a type of the Holy Ghost now did the seventh did the seventh arm in the menorah and the Seven golden candlesticks did that just go out and there was no fire there no did they skip the seventh for the perfect type that that laodicea would be would be completely extinguished of flame not at all every single arm burnt the fire Hallelujah you can't say the fourth Church age didn't burn the fire it burned the fire but it burnt the fire according to what the anointing was over the age because this also shows what would combat the Antichrist rolling out over those ages so Matthew actually means gift of the Lord which the Holy Ghost was the gift of the Lord okay I found this interesting this is a little bit of information but it says in Easton's dictionary he says the one aim pervading the whole book is uh and this is Matthew is the show that Jesus is he of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right this gospel contains no fewer than 65 references to the Old Testament 43 of these being direct verbal citations thus greatly outnumbering those found found in the other gospels the main feature of this gospel may be expressed in the motto I am not come to destroy but to fulfill okay so the purpose of the Gospel of Matthew is to show that Jesus come to fulfill the what the whole law in giving the Holy Ghost now here's an interesting graph if you see it I want you to notice there's only three of the gospels here there's a reason for that but if you can see what it's saying uh the relationships between the synoptic gospels you can see that Mark and Luke they agree in one percent right but yet unique they have three percent yo Mark has three percent but uh the tradition that they carry with each other uh you know 70 76 percent of Mark is in these two other gospels so they all work together but they have a double tradition and then they have something unique there so they all work together you see it's the same word but yet there's an expression that each book is actually trying to show okay um so Matthew's main point is to show that Jesus Christ come to fulfill all of it Hallelujah and to do what what did it end up doing he fulfilled it all so he could become all to you he could fill you the gift of the Lord the baptism Holy Ghost let's move to Mark Matthew mark when you look up the meaning of Mark Mark's name means a defense it was one of the evangelists probably the author of The Gospel of Mark it says Mark was likely written from Rome to Romans but more broadly Gentiles the purpose of the Gospel is to present Jesus Christ to Gentiles and to encourage Believers to endure and persevere persevere in the face of persecution and perhaps even martyrdom you know what that's amazing because that's the ox brother Bram said that that was the defense that's and what does the name Mark mean defense defense amazing that's how Supernatural this Bible is it works perfectly it says Mark was apparently more impressed by the mighty works that Jesus performed by the content of Jesus teaching uh more than half of Mark's gospel is devoted to giving an account of the remarkable Deeds that Jesus performed many of these Deeds dealt with Healing The Sick all right so that Ox anointing we can see it ties right in with the Book of Mark it was a defense so first you have the lion which was the baptism of holy ghost pulling out on that age and then what then it moved to the ox when remember when the Antichrist Spirit comes out as a red horse rider it's blood so brother Bram said he said they couldn't do anything but go and run and give their lives for the gospel's saved they because that's what the ox does now I have one sermon on each one of these so I'm just hitting a few highlights okay but you can see that that's what the ox does the ox labors and then it gives its life that's what it's always done ties right in with Mark now watch this Luke guess what the name Luke means to illuminate it means light giving so Luke was the man age or with the man anointing first Thessalonians 5 4 but ye Brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness so Luke's Luke's day uh the Gospel of Luke represents the man age all right that's that's your that's your Luther that's your Wesley and the name itself actually means to illuminate it's pretty deep stuff but but you see you see how it ties in real good yeah yeah you can't make that up that's a dictionary so now watch so what was Saint Luke what was so ironic about the the book of Saint Luke does anybody know before you look at the slide let me hide it does anybody know I know Pastor knows Luke was a book of parables the most Parables of any of the Gospel between 24 to 40 depending on what view you take so Luke is completely full of parables a parable is it's a story that's coming out uh like like the wise and the fools version it's saying something but there's a meaning behind it but it actually takes the supernatural revelation of Jesus Christ to show what it was like his disciples his disciples said you know Jesus why do you always speak in parables he said because it's for your eyes to see so he had to give them an illumination through the stories that he told you might remember that in the in uh also in in the Book of Luke that Jesus would tell Parables and the Pharisees said they perceived that Jesus talked about them and what they want to kill him because they didn't fully understand all of it but he was speaking about evil things and they in evil people and they knew that it was them so so but they couldn't they couldn't catch the the idea of it in order to repent and get right with God so Luke was actually a book full of Mysteries full of uh of of an illumination of the depths of the word right in Matthew 13 10 it says the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so it was remember you have lion ox and now man what was Luther Luther and Wesley's ages they were ages where the illumination of the Reformation came out and they begin to what they won they won they got Bibles and then they were anointed to dig into the depths of that word and to start bringing out ideas right it's a man age then lastly we have John what does John mean so remember Matthew means the gift of the Lord but John means Jehovah's gift it's a type of the eagle it means the grace or mercy of the Lord so the grace and the mercy of the Lord remember brother Branson he said he said Grace provided Israel a prophet Moses Grace gave them blood so Grace would actually bring forth the eagle okay now watch in 55 1004 come let us reason he says now that's when a person operated the gift of God now listen it's not me that needs to be for you brother Branch it's not me that needs to be for you now I'm fixing the Closing Services just in a night or two start praying for sick and it never do me I've never been I don't know nothing about it it's your faith in God that says the same thing now watch what he says it's a gift of God I'm not God's gift brother Branham was not God's gift that light an angel that you see the pictures of the pillar of Fire he said the scientific world now all over the world Germany United States everywhere took the picture of it that's God's gift so the eagle would be anointed by the pillar of fire in this day and age right but what was the Eagle's role the eagle remember it can Fly Above All the pressures of the world Hallelujah it has eyes that can it can be so high but it can see everything down there yes Pastor is the eagle God foreign good good question wonderful so that's God's gift so what is God's gift you see that's why you can never Focus or make the flesh man you're absolute his Humanity it has to be what this discern within our lives what is God and what is man because when the man talks that's not God's gift right that might be God's Prophet but that's not God's gift God's gift no can God's Gift fail it cannot fail because it's God so it comes upon us to receive what the word of the Lord remember what what is the message to us and correct me if you have a different idea pastor but but to me what the message is it is the revelation of the word of God to us in this hour that's what the message is it's the word of God the finishing of the Mysteries thank God God what he can only reveal the word through a prophet but he never said Focus or worship the prophet brother Braham said he said this is to take you back to the word because the word cannot fail right we got preachers leaving the message why do they leave a message because they're focused on a man he's a failure like they are right don't look at me I'm gonna fail you just ask my church but I can't be everything to them I can't be their God I wasn't made to be their god brother Jesse's not made to be your God God is made to be your God so you follow him as he follows Christ Hallelujah but who are you following Christ it's Christ in him the hope of glory amen and what he's following what he's eating of a pasture you are eating of a pasture the same pasture right hallelujah it's not to receive a pastor Spirit but it's to receive the spirit of God in the pastor that same Holy Ghost he has you should have amen and that's that's what brother Brandon distinguished because he showed that people actually receive the pastor if the pastor's a big Joker everybody in the church is going to be a big Joker if the pastor is a foolish Jester he's always he's joking but he's always ripping on people and doing things like that watch the church the church will do the same thing and they'll make excuses why they're like that or if he's really intellectual there's no spirit of God moving on him the whole church will be that way that's why when you look in the message you'll see that there's a Teaching Ministry well generally if the people are not receiving the teaching and they're receiving the man they will just sit in your chairs and this amen and just walk away because here's the thing it doesn't matter which one of the five-fold ministry gifts you have to bring the Holy Ghost down they'll all bring the Holy Ghost down so Jehovah's gift was what Hallelujah as Pastor answered I feel good because that's exactly what I was gonna say it was that pillar it was God's presence coming down to the people amen Hallelujah you know it's like uh I was talking brother Jesse and he said he's working with Azusa Street yes if they're born again if they're born again they're supposed to but that's the thing I mean are they are they just a message believer or have they received the Holy Ghost of that message right so that's why we can't just let the message and say well I just come to church you're not supposed to come to church as we said this morning by the scripture you're supposed to be a partaker in that word of God you're supposed to bring forth the the nine spiritual gifts God made you for that that that's that's what the nicolaitan spirit has destroyed it's put all the emphasis on a preacher just watch me go and like I said Lord of God I'm jumping on the mcdane and then you sit there and watch him he's like wow wow he's really anointed or boy he's got a lot of energy laughs but it's not it's not a gawking gospel it's a gospel that you can live out Hallelujah so what's God's gift that Pillar of Fire that's that's old Papa eagle he says let me stop here a minute if America would take its science and try to find research to cure cancer or something that would do somebody good instead of trying to or here I'll change that if America would turn to its gift from God and would receive God's Gift that's in the nation now they wouldn't have to build bomb shelters and things to protect wow now let me ask you a question then oh children if you received God's gift and that gift is what God where's he living in your heart so if things are getting really dark and evil in America what will that gift do for you here let me help you they wouldn't have to build bomb shelters and things to protect he will protect you hallelujah we're just showing in the scripture I was telling brother Jesse where we were eating there is that the scripture says that he will be your shield and your Buckler when you're holding a shield man this guy even got an armhole on it you got a shield you shoot a dart at me bam Bam Bam I tried doing it with my son my son played Nerf guns with me he gave me a little uh garbage can top I'm like now eventually you hit me I was doing pretty good but then he took it away and I was in trouble and they hurt so that's a shield but you know what a buckler means do you girls know what a buckler is anybody Buckler so buckler in Hebrew means to surround so you have a shield and God is a buckler to you which means his presence come here oh look at this okay boy that's a lot that's a lot of help okay you get in the middle okay okay so first but here do this first hold your Shield face everybody okay get out of the way get out of the way real quick scoot side scoot side side Glory good enough so she's got a shield Bam Bam Bam Bam it's pretty good you know she's like learn from me I don't know okay so that's your Shield but did you know God's also a Buckler surrounder okay so now her Shield even has protection so God wants to be that to you and I was telling brother Jesse what did Satan hate about job what did he hate sister Lydia he had a hedge about him a hedge about him he was completely surrounded by the presence of God and Satan couldn't even touch him so was job the only one that gets one of those no no thank you girls thank you you did great you did really good so you see God promised man you did real good sis yeah you stole your hand up yeah because because you're pastor yeah remember how Jesus said love the Lord well if you and if you think about it if I can add this pastor the the soul is spiritual but your heart pump your your heart that's part of the temple as well so the soul of course being part of that within there okay so it's kind of a spiritual thing going on inside just like the seed is in there okay so the Gospel of John now I won't be able to get those what time is it we're doing oh we're doing all right I'm gonna try to quit pretty quick here okay I want to show you what I'm going to show you how the prophet like in this okay the Gospel of John okay so the Gospel of John is the Eagles book okay it says in John 20 30 and many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God and that believing ye might have life through his name all right let me ask the children a question so the Gospel of John is represented by the eagle it's Jehovah's gift the pillar of Fire so is the Book of John like any of the other Gospels it's actually so different than the other three it's set all by themselves but now let me ask you another question so John is a type of somebody in the scripture John's a type of of somebody anybody answer what that is who's that somebody huh all right John is a type of a church or the bride right so John is single-handedly notice he talks about the Book of John he says that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ Son of God and that believing you might have life through his name John is different than any other gospel and it has a distinct message all by itself in relation to the synoptics or the three gospels the differences are great but more surprising is the fact that the points of contact between these gospels and the fourth gospel are so few John is the bride's book but yet of course the full word too all of them working together right the scenes depicted the work's done the word spoken and the reflections made by the writer are all directed towards the aim of enabling the readers to believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God Hallelujah now your Prophet talks about he says how does John guard the acts of the Holy Spirit we know the word that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so how does John guard the acts of the Holy Spirit I'm gonna be I'm gonna try to be quick with this okay then we'll close in Revelation chapter 4 he said here's the lion the servant Jesus gave them power and he protects it he protects Acts 2 38. the gospels actually have to protect Acts 2 38. okay he backs her right up there that line here comes the sweetness of the Gospel with this Eagle saying the works that I do shall you do also okay so the gospels actually will guard the book of Acts by laying the doctrine down that shows that acts is not something crazy but it's actually exactly what the gospels say about Jesus Christ amen okay he says uh because what does John say the works that I do shall you do also children does anyone know where that is the works that I do shall you do also it's in the Book of John but anybody remember where it's at it's a big bonus that's a big bonus John 14 12. that's a good one to memorize he says More Than This shall you do fly across the world with it like the dove that had the mates head pulled off and pour on the blood sprinkle the ground crying holy holy holy to the Lord clean the leopard yeah now I got another one here John 15 7. let's turn right to John 15 7. if he abide in me now in my words not the seminary's words my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you okay that's right then the that gospel guarded right there this Pentecostal blessing is guarded by John and his gospel it's guarded by Matthew his gospel okay so when a shadow could heal he said if you abide in me he said ask what you will shall be done unto you if you've got a a lame man that's gated beautiful it's guarded right in the gospel The Works that I do shall you do see how it guards it by the word well wait a minute so if The Mercy Seat is inside of you what guards you the gospel you can always go back to Jesus Christ in the gospel and what's it going to do guard your experience man I wonder if this gospel is right I wonder if the message is right well if you got the Pentecostal blessing all you got to do is go back to the to the guards and the guards will show you you're right on okay does the Book of John guard the Supernatural and the believer I'm taking these from Brother random there's John 14 12. he the belief in me the works that I do shall he do also Greater Works shall than these shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it anything tell them see I always wondered and and you can see how God left the gospel because he said he said if if you shall ask for food in my name I'll do it that's included in anything he gave you an open check and said anything you ask I will do it so then what it showed that what the gospel is not the acts of the holy spirit is not it's not just limited it can be anything at any time we got to take it back to the word we're not talking oil coming out of your hands and things like that but it will go along the same pattern of the word anything well that's Pastor you want that one and first first John I believe it's five it says if you ask anything according to his will he'll do it yeah so if you don't ask a corner his will he's not going to do it if you ain't got no faith are you going to do it all right how about the ones is the one that's guarded Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me if he had known me you should have known my father also so you know Jesus you know the father and from henceforth you know him and have seen him so they were seeing the father well who's the father then Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us just show us the father Jesus said then have I been so long time with you and yet thou hast thou not known me so children who was the father Jesus so he was all father son Holy Ghost book of Hebrews said he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so he carried all of it all right so let's continue okay I gotta quit does it does it guard Divine Healing he says now let's take and see if Matthew up here now will guard it for divine healing got your pencils and things now that you're writing this down all right see if Matthew divides well we'll guard it let's let's take Matthew 10 1. let's take and see if John just one or two let's take two or one of them and see what's in John 14 12 John 15 7. so no matter where you go in the Gospels it will guard all the supernatural life of God that he wants to do in you so you can say well God then there's there should be Supernatural in my life you should believe that but notice what that is it's got to be the acts of the Holy Spirit see we have to have God where he belongs now remember what happened in the book of Samuel it says when they took the Ark of God they said they called it Ichabod the glory of the Lord has Departed when the ark left the glory Departed so if the glory departs from life we say oh God your word's the same I believe you can produce in me oh God come just fill me up amen give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah because the gospels are guarding the experience of that ax in your life just for just for the preacher no no what these mind shall follow them that believe see Mark guards the book of Acts does it guard the baptism the Holy Ghost and I'll pray the father he shall give you another comforter that that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth he says whom the world cannot receive because it seeth and not near the northern but ye shall know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so what happened in the acts of the Holy Spirit he already prophesied it was coming to them it's guarded right here they say well you say you got the Holy Ghost it's my guard right there [Laughter] Jesus said hey brother amen how come you got so much comfort in your life you can see they say you shouldn't be you shouldn't have any special comfort you say that's guarded that's guarded in my life you can't touch my comfort because Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so the holy spirit is Jesus inside of you he said right there in his guards that you have it right so if you've got the joy of the Holy Ghost it's right there he said ask that your joy may be full John 16 7. nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you right I will send him unto you see the Book of John it's a beautiful okay let me ask you a question where are the guards for the modern Christian doctrines this is the difference where are their guards how about the guards for the trinity all they can come up with is John 1. and try to say it's a dove coming down and God talking and Jesus standing there that's all they got and it says as a dove but in their depiction they got Grandpa god with with gray hair and then they got Holy Spirit bird flying around I mean that's it's kind of belittling they're trying to say that that's why a lot of people say there's a two-person godhead not a three because they don't want to make a bird God but I said he was as a dove on the wings of a snow white dog right how about uh how about trinitarian baptism father son Holy Ghost it's not in the acts of the Holy Spirit it might be in Matthew and that actually guards what acts 238 is in the name singular of the father son Holy Ghost how about the Eucharist is that guarding the gospels no no even there we only need initial evidence of tongues not there uh eternal hell it's not there patents not there Eternal sonship not there they don't have any guards over their experience so what is their experience we're good any questions boys hands go quick man how you need to come over to my church for a while uh who's first David so what's capitalized it's got right but what does comfort Comforts The attribute of God I always find it interesting though Jesse that in the in the Old Testament you know I talk about wisdom and it's always called her she so so the wisdom is an attribute of God and what it's it's explained as a female so that you have God and you have his attributes wait a minute wait a minute so what are you you're an attribute of his mind and you are in the spiritual you are feminine you're the bride the Church of Jesus Christ uh another hand was up here brilliant man that was pretty weird [Laughter] that's pretty good now a lot of the things what he did is he is he of course he had to make the type run all the way through I I would actually say that only only in this realm is that actually something disturbing or something that would actually come against you because when you get there that's that's part of the actual glory of God because those zones are also an attribute of God because they're just as Eternal as he is Revelations 5. it's it's seven horns now now what was the representation of that the seven horns were the power to the Beast or the seven Church ages power wealth foreign and so the book was the book and the works were finished from the foundation of the world so that means when God made Satan he already knew that Satan was going to try to overthrow him so God set it up that he would be guarded but then he showed all through the word why were those guards there during the word to show that God was just as protected in heaven as he is on Earth your experience is just as protected right now as God himself that's part of the thing to get you away from the fear or Scare this is all predestinated so so when he fights you and when he challenges you you have what's going to guard you the word of God and then you can be identified with that word got some really good questions up in here brother God bless it so you see how that just runs right through the scripture and we're getting ready to go there I I believe brother I believe brother sister we're going to be in such an awe when we when we move into these dimensions and uh you know even even with Azusa Street and some of these things like that Angela's Temple that they could hear angels singing in the background they could be getting such an atmosphere and anointing that the Holy Ghost would come in there you could hear angels singing and so I mean just literally no negative thing can be on you once you transition so in a moment in twinkling of an eye you go to a place where they're that's the thing because we experience fear we experience nervousness anxiety doubt questions confusion you realize there's no questions over there no confusion Hallelujah you remember brother Branham said he said when you get your theophany he said right now you don't know but he said once you have that you'll know all about it then because it's it's the word it's the expression of the word one I think that's one thing I don't know if he knows right now I wouldn't think so many questions mm-hmm there was no boredom you know just can keep on unfolding all throughout eternity that's like I said you know some of the things that brother Branham said blows your mind like uh you know what what's in you you could actually go create a world and go live on it so if you're made in the image and likeness of God you can do the same things that God did you know as you're under his headship as he's moved upon you to do those things because you know what we're going to is also the expression of the perfect headship husband and wife relationship with God so you'll literally experience the perfect marital relation with God as far as what he expressed down here you will be that and my wife says amen she gotta deal with me oh what a good time it's like a little family meeting I'm so glad you answered all those questions great job brother everybody good so you see how perfect the Bible is perfect the message is so this is part of the thing you don't have to have any fear of doubt about what you are or what guards you so when Satan brings anything to you and he lies what do you do you put the guards after him just remember you are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses not not just the the folks that went before you have the witness of the Gospel all around you oh my that was so beautiful now how's this a touch because you know obviously it goes through every Doctrine those Gospels it has to surface seeds there and they're all there Hallelujah praise the Lord children you're good [Applause]
