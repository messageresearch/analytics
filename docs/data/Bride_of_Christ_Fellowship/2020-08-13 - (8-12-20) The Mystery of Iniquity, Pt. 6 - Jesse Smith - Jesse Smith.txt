all he's done for you why shouldn't you love him [Music] appreciate those songs brother thanks uh children for the music work there praise god let's take a few prayer requests here let's remember david hawkins he's brian's son i think he's what 19 or 20. anyways he went to the marines he had told me last time he was here he preached one time for us and then he said he felt led like he needs more experience in life before he preaches so uh he didn't preach the last time he was here but then he went into the marines his dad of course was in the military i'm not sure which branch air force okay thank you darth my wife remembers all those good details that i don't i don't remember i knew it was military uh but anyways let's remember him uh you know help him uh his witness there amongst the marines as he's in boot camp but also the hawkins family they're missing their son no doubt and no doubt their hearts are heavy at this time let's remember uh brother amen's workplace somebody had covet at brother amen's workplace so let's remember everybody there and also god will protect by the amen by god's grace and also let's just pray amen gets good rest here by the grace of the lord also brother donnie reagan got coronavirus as well so let's remember him in prayer the other preacher at his church daryl ward has it as well in fact his whole family has it um you know so far they're doing okay by god's grace they're just at home kind of quarantined let's remember them in the word of prayer also let's remember the upcoming presidential election you saw the vice president a democratic person was chosen and billy graham's son put out a post she's the most pro-abortion senator i think to date she's out of california so let's just remember that ask the lord to direct us and give us righteous leaders because righteousness exalts a nation that's why america is what it is today but of course we know it's backslidden but let's just pray for god to withhold the evil we know he will and he does it in long-suffering that people might be saved so let's remember those in a word of prayer does anybody else have any other requests they'd like to be remembered haven all right praise god also i heard from brother uh austin i shouldn't say brother i want to make sure he's saved first but our friend austin and he said he's feeding on our sermons so i said well go ahead send your tithes you know if you don't have a home church and um so i just told him to go ahead and do that if he's feeding so hopefully lord bless you austin my friend and uh hopefully he gets a chance to watch this um so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer amen the fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman avails much it prevails much so let's believe that let's be uh encouraged with that that god hears our fervent faithful prayers let's have a word of prayer heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we come humbly before your great throne o god in that mighty name the name above

bibles here tonight let's go to uh luke 23 33 and then we'll read after that we'll read our memory verse from matthew chapter 6. luke 23 33 i'd like to continue on the mystery of iniquity we're kind of getting close to the end uh lord willing sunday uh we'll preach on uh the trail of the serpent again i've written on that i included that lord willing in the in the chapter there so i'd like to preach on that matthew i'm sorry luke 23 33 so here is the the height of iniquity uh amongst the workers of iniquity uh these four uh sad words but let's read it uh together luke 23 33. let's read that whole verse on three one two three and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the male factors one on the right hand and the other on the left that's the very height of the workers of iniquity crucifying afresh uh the lord jesus god's own god's only son only begotten son let's go to matthew 6 30 please [Music] praise god matthew 6 30 through 34 let's read this together and ask the holy spirit to write this upon our hearts he'll bring it to our remembrance in the hour when we need it let's read that on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may god has blessings to read of his word you may be seated so let's not worry about thursday praise god let's focus on wednesday night praise god amen hallelujah that's just an in good encouragement i know on my to-do list i don't know about yours but i already got lots of things for tomorrow but i'm just going to forget about that and let's uh let's focus on the word of god praise the lord just real quick i did post a new video today on youtube uh i had two questions about water baptism and i thought i could put together a video real fast so i did can't or does water baptism the answer is no of course grace saves you by faith uh so i share brother bran's quotes on there plus the scriptures and can you get the holy ghost baptism in your soul before you're baptized in water the answer is yes and that's in acts chapter 10 cornelius in his house got the baptism in the soul before they got the water baptism we're not sure maybe they didn't know about the baptism uh maybe it was like the ephesians in acts chapter 16 or maybe they had no preacher to baptize him there at cornelius house but either way they were justified sanctified and they weren't even baptized in water but they got the holy ghost while peter yet preached those words and then he commanded them go be baptized and they were baptized so those are it's just a nine minute video um by god's grace we're up to uh 11 04 subscribers just to encourage you i'd like to read that and we have almost a million views we're at 982 000. so we're almost at a million our website currently has 70 000 views since we started it in uh 2014 i think so i was just checking some numbers just encourage you you never know who's going to get on there and i like i said about every week we get a nice testimony from there that god is reaching people for the kingdom of god so we're thankful praise god it's our duty like we're fulfilling that scripture church uh prophesy again to many nations kingdoms and tongues if we can't go we'll put it on the internet because we know the internet will probably get there and i and like i told you my whole life i told you this since i've been a pastor my desire if the lord terry's is to retire and then i'll set some pastor here and i'll go preach out to the nations that's my desire now i'm not saying i'll do that but that's what i want to do uh i want to go be a missionary i want to go preach a lot of it will probably be evangelism you know we're just going to establish churches and then trying to work out uh where people never heard it but i don't know what god will do but god knows my heart i want to do something for the kingdom of god uh after this but i love pastor and i love this uh this gift i love just staying in the word of god don't you i love saying the channel of the word just meditating on it and just seeing more and more scriptures tied together that's what brother bam's message did it finished the mystery of god it took all the loose ends and all the mysteries that were out there through all the ages and brought them back together into one finished mystery of god amen we're so blessed church to have these uh facts these brother man calls them bible facts bible revelations restored to us so let me set the timer here and we'll be getting quickly here to uh uh the message we'll bring it up here by god's grace okay 40 minutes all right so uh we're starting here we're picking up where we left off uh we left off with jesus uh giving eight woes to the pharisees uh because of their iniquity they continually worked it and we find them here now uh that was matthew 23 so that was the week before uh they crucified christ about a week and a half two weeks before they crucified christ and so a week and a half later after giving eight woes upon them the workers of iniquity crucify him they deliver him up to be crucified and there's great depths of meaning brother brand taught us in the indictment with there they crucified him there the jerusalem the most holy place on earth they the world's most powerful government rome agreed with judaism the most holy people on earth crucified the most gruesome tortuous painful death him the world's most holy innocent perfect person jesus christ this shows us the extreme wickedness that the workers of iniquity always go to so church we we know it's true today as well right because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever demons don't die they keep living the most religious people will commit the most wicked crimes against the most holy person they claim to love let it not be us church because let me say it like this i want to be the most religious person right i want to be i want to be but i want to be sincere with it because remember james 1 says you must have pure religion how do you remember the scripture we must have pure religion there's nothing wrong with religion religion is a good thing but see uh the workers of iniquity have perverted religion and they don't have the anointing of the holy spirit for their religion it's scriptural pure religion is remember giving to the poor and visiting the childless and the fatherless uh though that's pure religion before god keeping your tongue undefiled amen pure religion before god james says so see church uh how did israel get to this condition to crucify their very own messiah it was slow spreading of sin until it you know maybe it was first compromising on their their fasting or you know or on their prayer but pretty soon it spread to their entire uh religious experience it went from all the way to the high priest all the way down uh to the to the child to the mother right to you name it the janitor we'd say from the pulpit to the janitor brother branham says it was just spread slowly but now in the book of hebrews you know hebrews 6 1-8 it teaches jesus is crucified daily now so beginning even after he raised and resurrected sent the holy ghost the hebrews writer says he's crucified afresh daily not physically but spiritually spiritually through workers of iniquity who disobey the truth of god and then teach others to do the same oh my he's presently christ's spirit is presently crucified the effects of his holy spirit are crucified the cleansing effects and the people temporarily experience god's blessings only to publicly disobey his teaching at a later time jesus calls them thorn bushes he says they produce sharp prickly thorns you ever been around people like that message churches it's not it's not gentle it's not gentle it's not a gentle experience to be around them it's sharp and pricky prickly right oh my goodness i don't like i don't like i'm gonna go talk to somebody else right now in the parking lot uh you know that's what jesus says they're like being around them is not easy it's hard it's it's we'd say it's violent right it's it's contentious right it's a hard thing to do uh but we see it that the religious uh they enjoy the blessings and feelings of god's spirit but they commit sharp despicable iniquities like judas that sharp judas kiss right it's a betrayal it looks nice but it's sharp and it's a sharp betrayal it's a sharp rebuke he kisses the very one that he really despises that's hebrews 6 1-8 they have a temporary rain they receive the rain temporarily but then they produce sharp uh rebukes or betrayals against the very word that they claim to love hebrews 9 29 describes their crucifixion as smashing it under their feet the bible says of how much sore punishment shall he be thought worthy who hath trotted under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and had done despite the spirit of grace church very sore punishments await those who deny the works of the holy spirit this continual sanctification we're enjoying now we enjoy it praise god but the workers of iniquity despise it so they leave it and because they leave the good sanctifying effects of god they get the sore or the more harsh punishments because church god's spirit god's gracious spirit is leading us to a sanctified life not a sinful disobedient one now listen church i always say like this i rejoice in this there's going to be something under your feet either the devils are going to be under your feet praise god that's us amen there's satan's under our feet or the word is going to be crucified under our feet amen i say like romans 1 says satan will be shortly under your feet praise god that was paul's prayer for the church in rome that satan would shortly be under their feet which means they overcome which means they have authority over demon powers amen they cast down as we said at last on sunday they cast on any thought that exalts itself against the word of god amen glory i'm so glad about it praise god remember jesus's feet in revelation 1. remember they were feet of brass which means he took the judgments of god hallelujah he walked through the fires of god judgment so all sin is under his feet praise god he bore the shame of all the all the pain and all the guilt and so we can be free from it and because his feet walked over the fiery judgments of god our feet can rule over those demon powers amen our feet can rule over the guilt and the shame of our past life or our current struggles we can get victory over them and we can have satan under our feet praise god let's be a victor in christ amen let's put devils under our feet let that be our testimony amen let me say like this let's keep covered under our feet praise god hallelujah let's keep a doubt away praise god let's keep the lust and the greed and the the the confusion and the division and the anger and the wrath let's keep that under our feet praise god amen that's what the bible says something will be under our feet let's have it devils under our feet in jesus name you know church here's some good examples you've seen it you know judas and church there i don't know if you've been watching it over the last few years there's been numerous preachers that are dominational leave the just leave christianity there's been numerous song leaders i'm sure my wife and i we talk about it from time to time that used to be worship leaders so mega churches now denominational or independent and all of a sudden they'll just put on their instagram i no longer believe i no longer believe the most uh the most well well known to me was a was a preacher who wrote a book that i read called i kiss dating goodbye cam and i read that when cam first got saved he read that book because he was he wanted a godly wife and then after reading that book he wrote eight things he wanted his wife and hung it up i imagine julia was probably like more than eight probably like 20 things he he wanted because god's so good he gives you more than you ask or think is that right amen well i read that you know when my wife and i you know we first became christians and it was a great book it was all about holiness in fact it would it caused a lot of scandal just in denominational churches because they thought it was legalism but it was love the man wrote a good book christians don't date they're supposed to court in in preparation for marriage it's a great book well the man last year came out on his thing and said you know i was real arrogant when i wrote that and now he's for homosexuality and all these things like that church he's done it i'm i'm not judging him but it looks like he's publicly disgraced and put to shame the god who sanctified him and he got divorced and you know just an awful mess you know he's in other words he was saved he was sanctified at least in his marriage relationship uh you know to live a a godly courtship get married uh publicly but then turn around and deny it and walk away he's in danger of putting christ under his feet so let's not be like that let's not walk away from the word of god let's walk in the word of god and let's put devils under our feet praise god amen just a good example that i thought i'd share a book i read around it would have been around uh 2000 2001 or 2002 right before i heard the message a book that helped me in our my wife and i our courtship of course we were dating until we knew there i didn't even know there was a thing called courtship but uh eventually god let us know by the grace of god which was so wonderful so see church that's just one example you see it all the time now you can bring it to the message where people walk away from the message and then they speak evil brother branham the bible said touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm some of them you know we i haven't seen you know any judgments strike the people that have left i haven't seen it but they may be awaited for judgment day i don't know but to look at god's man a god's prophet and then call him a liar and make fun of him and mock him there's going to be some awful things on the day of judgment for people that will do that a man that will speak god's word a man that will tell you the bible revelations he'll leave his wife and go around the world and preach and and travel weeks upon end and he'll minister till he loses his strength and loses his mind almost just to help people because he loves them so much and to look upon a christ-like ministry like that where a u.s representative gets out of a wheelchair and walks praise god that's that's the holy spirit amen hallelujah that's the man of god hallelujah and to speak evil against that god be merciful but they're in danger of of smashing under foot the christ that once sanctified them see church you and i know you can temporarily enjoy god's grace but then fail to let it continue but the bible says this grace will never fail you and i the sinners will fail grace but grace will never fail you and i hallelujah the bible says looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled see church i've seen it with a couple of the people that left the message because i listened to their podcast in order to know how to answer them hopefully i'll do okay by god's grace i'm trusting in the holy spirit for next month's debate i'm trusting in the holy spirit but listen and i can hear how they're bitter against message believers or they're bitter against brother branham and what the bible say they fail god's grace when they let a root of bitterness grow up in their heart and instead of having a nice a nice heart where there's there's no there's no weeds there's no thorns it's a good ground where fruits of the holy spirit can grow instead of having that weeds have sprung up and choke the life of the word and the word can't produce what it's supposed to produce it's supposed to produce love amen it's supposed to produce patience it's supposed to produce long suffering it's supposed to produce all these godly attributes that we need but instead roots of bitterness choke it out and you don't no longer feel as clean and pure as you used to god help us to weed out unbelief weed out bitterness right and let the let the love of god let the seed of god's love produce the fruits of the holy spirit that people can see our lives are sincere and genuine and real christian fruits praise god amen see it's all about that seed right roots of bitterness a seed of bitterness right grows up and it chokes the seed of the word of god you know it church multitudes of preachers are currently crucifying the effects of the holy spirit not all but many paul says the ones who mention the cross are often enemies of the cross remember that scripture because their god is their belly we haven't got to it in philippians 3 18-19 can you hold it up there occasionally real quick we'll get there soon i think we just got to the end of chapter 2 on sunday right and we'll look to chapter 3 here soon isn't that something the very ones who preach about the cross are actually enemies of its effect for many walk of whom i have told you enough many were walking what about today many walked and were enemies of the cross in paul's day than most are today and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mine earthly things did you see that preacher uh from the liberty university took a picture with i don't know if you saw it but they kicked him out it was just last week was it last week uh they put another uh president in there in his place you see it he took a picture with the woman that wasn't his wife and they unzipped their their pants together and she had like a short shirt on and he had like a drink alcohol it was just awful and this guy's supposed to be like a religious majority or yeah moral majority or something like that he's supposed to be a minister of the gospel that's a shame there that's the enemy of the cross the cross teaches holiness godliness in the fear of the lord amen it's the enemies of the cross what everybody's making all that money as a university president see if they're not for the cross they're against the cross how many preachers are enemies of the cross if many in paul's they were enemies how many are there today i don't want to be an enemy of the cross i want to carry the cross and i'm in saints i know what i'm asking for well jesse you're asking for a hard life i know i am but i don't want to be what those uh uh crucifiers of christ i don't want to be that so god you have my god you have my my requests and my humble my humble request just make make me a real follower of christ where i can take up my cross daily and follow jesus amen don't let me get deceived don't let me get comfortable in the lust of the world the cares of life help me to be humble let me be a real servant of jesus praise god see they preach the cross for their belly and their wallet then deny the power to live a real christian life they give license for immorality and present an outwardly clean wealthy appearance but pull up jude 1 4 question would you jude foretold this my this is i think this was written right around the time of the book of revelation if i'm not mistaken on my date so i can look it up real quick here jude the book of jude yeah there is jude was written around oh no i'm sorry it was well before that 66 a.d okay so right after paul died paul died in 65. so this was written the year after paul died jude i believe he's the brother of jesus if i'm not mistaken yeah brother james jude 1 4 for there are certain men crept in unawares i look remember we said how last week how they creep into your house these men slowly now it's women too now with women preachers but amen creeping in unawares now be careful what you're listening to in your home church especially the preachers right who were before of old ordained of this condemnation so god foreknew their that they were going to do this ungodly men turning the grace of god into that means lawlessness the cheviousness means no law see we got the law of the holy spirit praise god and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ see they turn grace into lawlessness live however you want we're under grace and they they turn like that but the bible said they're ungodly men if they're not living a godly life they're not godly men paul says from such turn away turn away from this crowd real christians though die daily like paul said paul said i die daily and church we die to our selfish desires uh pull up luke 9 23 jesus urged them he said take up your cross daily and follow me in fact he says if you can't do that you're not a real christian luke 9 23 and he said to them oh if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me hallelujah paul says the proof of you belonging to christ is that you crucify and mortify he said the deeds and lusts of the flesh and of the world now listen i've said it before you'll either crucify god's word or you'll crucify your selfish lust with god's word let's kill our own sinful wills and let's do god's will let's keep doing it by the grace of god amen now that's all those are putting numerous scriptures together but if you put all those romans 8 12 galatians 5 24 galatians 6 13-15 colossians 3 5 they will all say that real christians mortify and crucify the lust of the flesh and walk according to the spirit praise god amen hallelujah now next thought here how am i doing on time good 20 minutes all right that's half the time already praise god now church the next section i called you and i can recognize antichrist by their hell-deserving and non-kingdom works in other words you can recognize a corrupt tree by its fruit but i found specific scriptures and i'm just going to go through these kind of fast i have three scriptures or three sections of scriptures that list 36 sins of people that will go to hell and then i got another page with 37 of people that will not be in the kingdom of god so you ready for this everybody better take a deep breath you better get on your uh shock proof vest brother brandon calls it and in church if you if now listen we're all going to battle with some of these so let's be ready to confess all these praise god if there's if there's anything we've done let's be careful and ready to say god forgive me take this out of my life lord put it under my feet praise god let me do my part to cast down the imagination or the things i do or the lust or the desires help me to put that under the the feet in jesus name paul said antichrist will have a drastic increase waxing worse and worse but i love this he promised brother amen he said the holy scriptures he said will make you wise unto salvation amen so again what does it prove the wise virgin is wise and the wisdom of god takes her away from sin and makes her live righteously praise god that's all that's what it comes down to wise versus foolish praise god oh my i love it it's the wise versus foolish all through the this new testament paul's the one who teaches that that was second timothy 3 13-15 the holy scriptures make us wise and i'm glad to preach the word of god to you praise god i might be a little heavy lately on scriptures right you haven't heard me use a lot of quotes lately right i did for numerous series from some series i have to do that but church don't be discouraged if i'm heavy on the scriptures that's what's going to make you wise yes the quotes will too don't get me wrong but here i'm laying if i'm laying in a bible revelation of a bible mystery then the bible you have to know the bible interprets itself in other words the bible gives the answer to the mystery pray god and the holy scriptures are the answer to the mystery amen so see there'll be times i labor real heavy on quotes and it might be hard to keep watching and stay awake because i'm reading quotes but there's a purpose behind it praise god but there's other times of just word word word word praise god for god's glory and i know you love it you come back sir i know you love it you come back service after service after service and you press through the flesh and the trials of life and you sing to give god praise and you sing with brother amen and all the and i you just love god and let's keep doing that by god's grace let's be diligent let's be faithful let's take up the cross daily and follow him jesus said these lawless ones can be recognized by their hell-deserving works revelation 21 7-8 say list eight sins of people that go to hell fearful unbelieving abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers idolaters all liars shall have their part in the brit and the fire which burneth with the brimstone there's eight here's twelve more peter in second peter chapter two says these are all hell deserving acts walking in fleshy lust not a stumble not i stumbled into a sin i'm walking in sin in other words i'm enjoying sin he said despising government there you go with the election coming up we shouldn't despise it let's pray for it let's pray that god will clean it out praise god church don't you know do you remember this remember when we preached on the kings of israel there would be a good king bad bad bad then a good one right let's pray for that praise god we might have had some bad ones let's pray god give us a good one praise the lord okay it's not outside of god's a power remember brother said you can put a george washington abraham lincoln in every in every government in every state and the nation's still going wrong and that's true but let's pray god raise those up a good man praise god i know i mean it might seem hard to pray for that and believe that but let's pray for that praise god see self-willed is another one speaking evil of good adultery sin addiction coveting loving money forsaken the right way serving corruption unbridled lusts and other pollutions of the world there's 12 more so i've listed 20 already to you these are worthy of hell in other words all of these now listen all these people that do these things they love sin more than they love simple repentance remember church don't forget the rich young ruler he did he never broke the commands but remember remember he only failed in one thing what was it the love of money but listen church that don't mean he was like really loving god and loving righteousness he just loved money so much he didn't commit adultery he didn't murder because he loved money so much right that's why brother ham said one thing can keep somebody out of heaven because it's it's all based upon what they love do they love the pleasures of the world do they love darkness or love light i love light i wouldn't want to be in here without light i love the natural light and i love the spiritual light of god's word amen we need the light of god hallelujah but see they love darkness rather than light so there's 20. here's 16 more in the book of jude we're not going to read it but i'm going to list them out to you he says these are all damning acts he says damning turning grace into lawlessness that's called lecheviousness we just read it that's the first one in the list he this whole chapter is filled he names all the works of iniquity fornication defiling the flesh despising dominion see leadership preachers right governments they despise it they speak evil of those dignities be careful what we say right we can call out sin let's be careful if it's just or not corrupting themselves greed not fearing god shamefully violent wanderers ungodly deeds hard speeches my murmuring complaining walkers after their own lusts and mockers there's 36 sins that will take people to hell right there 36 workers of iniquity the bible says in other words these people walk in and they love to they love to mock right you see it on the internet all the time right facebook and instagram they love to mock people they love to they love to get on do their live speeches right they're in their car and they're like this and or they're walking down with their stick and they're just they're blaspheming the word of god and the bible said if they don't repent of that they'll burn in fire and brimstone thank god we have a good and gracious king who reached out his goodness to us that we can repent praise god because that would have been you and i brother sister we would have been making all those hard speeches against dignities and we would have been rebuking preachers and we would have been rebuking the president and the vice president all these things like that but god help us to have words that are seasoned with grace amen we got to take a stand we got to speak against evil but we can do it with grace i've had preachers not preachers yeah i've had preachers i've had preachers recently and other people say i go on your youtube channel and i read all your comments and they said i love how you're so gracious to the people that are so mean to you because they call me some awful names sometimes you wouldn't like it i don't like it either but we got to be gracious praise god and the nice thing is i can just click delete if i don't like it i don't and i can say i'm banning you for my page you can't lo you can't comment on my page anymore that's the nice thing now there's three more portions of scripture where there's 37 plus acts that will keep people out of the kingdom of god that means they won't have the baptism of the holy ghost right that means they won't be they won't be ruling in the millennium they won't rule over cities or nations remember remember jesus told the sardis age you'll rule over nations with a rod of iron if you overcome my martin luther there he's going to be having a rod of iron and ruling over nations my what a soldier what a saint of god amen to stand up against that roman system god help us to stand up against it praise god to be ruling with a rod of iron and they won't be with jesus right in the future home because they weren't the kingdom people they weren't in other words they didn't have the kingdom inside of them praise god jesus said the kingdom of god is within you amen because they kept the kingdom out of their souls they're kept out of ruling in the kingdom first corinthians 6 9-11 lists 10 sins paul says do not be deceived fornicators idolaters effeminate which is child molesters there's a big thing on child trafficking right now right people stealing children and trafficking them it's awful it's wicked they're deserving of hell abusers of themselves mankind that's homosexuals thieves covetous drunkards revilers that's complainers and extortioners that's robbers they will not inherit the kingdom of god but paul gives us some of the most beautiful words in there he said and such were some of you you used to be outside the kingdom he said but now you're in the kingdom such were some of you now you're washed you're sanctified you're justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god amen i used to be in that camp but i'm out of that camp i'm out of that kingdom now i'm in the holy kingdom of god amen i'm in jesus's kingdom praise god oh my thank the lord such were some of you you believe that god can you believe god can hear or forgive a child molester you believe god can heal a homeless or forgive a homosexual yeah oh yeah there's nothing too far there's nothing too hard for god amen he's the great washer he's a great dishwasher praise god he's the great cleanser galatians 5 19-26 list 17 sins that people do and they will not inherit the kingdom of god i know there's some overlap church but i'm reading them all for effect right that give you a more of a fact if you hear it again oh my that's you hear it more and more you won't you'll god will keep you away from it these people shall not inherit the kingdom of god adulterers which we have many in our family especially my side fornicators uncleanness which is lustful luxurious living la cheviousness already said that one idolatry witchcraft which is drug use think about all the drug users hatred variance now variance is contention so people that want to fight and have contentions and battles amongst each other emulations which is rivalry or jealousy can i tell you a perry green story about brother branham with emulations brother brown would go hunting with the brothers and they've had contests for the amen about shooting contests and dart practice and every time brother branham would lose and then peregrine would walk on and then he'd watch when when brother bran would practice and he'd get bull's eyes every time and perry green said brother branham how come you lose every time but when i watch you you do it he said i don't want to have any emulations i don't want to have any rivalry amongst the brothers look at that he didn't want any jealousy he didn't want any competition spirit so he let all the brothers think they were better at him than darts now so see that must been something brother struggle with right because if you go to so much length to make sure that i mean like remember he with money he said of the three things preachers fall to money was his hardest battle so he totally made sure he didn't use any money or the wrong way he took extra effort so he must have been a competitive person we got any of those in our church any competitive people here you like to win you like your way that's the story from barry green tells uh jose would like that he's he's probably he's probably laughing right now if he's watching emulation is jealousy rivalry wrath strife strife is electioneering for office so you guys vote for me i'm going to be the next uh so and so right vote for me vote for me without the leadership of the holy spirit vote for me instead of him vote for me instead of her seditions which are divisions heresies man-made tenets or doctrines envyings murders drunkenness revelings which are late night parties and rioting such as such will not inherit the kingdom of god god will not let those writers if they don't repent god will not let them rule in the next kingdom why they're destroying this one already and the last one is a feat now that's 27 all right i've read you 27 already that proved people don't have the holy ghost uh ephesians 5 1-8 paul warns the following acts gives someone no inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god do you understand that church if you can no the reason i'm going to say this if you can control your sexual desires and keep from fornication and adultery you've got heavenly rewards in the kingdom of god if you can keep this guy from lying if you can keep this tongue from lying and and debating and hard speeches you'll have treasure in the kingdom of god you can just control this this this this tongue this fire of iniquity right this this world of iniquity that this igniting of fire if you can just control this guy jesus will make you rule in the next world amen we can just control this guy you'll have inheritance you'll be an heir don't you like the sound of that i'm a joint heir of jesus but amen my name and your name is on his list of heirs praise god we inherit by god's grace right where our names are on there we inherit all these blessings why because we honor christ if we honor god god will honor us amen so let me read through this list of 10. this will take us up to 37. and that's that's now you see some overlap with a 36 i've already read so you can't come to church tonight and say nobody brother jesse didn't tell me any scriptures i just told you over 70 sins right ephesians 5 warns us fornicators uncleanness which is lustful luxurious living covetousness greedy desire to have more filthiness immoralities foolish talking jesting which is evil humor evil jokes whoremongers all unlawful sex unclean person evil thoughts and acts idolaters and speakers of vain words which means devoid of truth people that just speak words that aren't true they will have no inheritance of the kingdom of god 36 plus 37 what's that 73 is that yeah 73 73 sins i just listed you and church the blood of jesus is so powerful can wash all those away amen it can take all those away you and i might have been guilty of 70 of those right we might have been guilty of 50 of those but when the blood of jesus touches you and cleanses you and you confess your sin you're guilty of none of the praise god because they all got placed upon the back of our lord and savior jesus amen jesus dropped the charges amen hallelujah we were wrong but our sins were put upon him and now there's no charges for you and i we are justified legally declared righteous because he took our shame that we might take his righteousness oh praise be to god amen well amen i was probably guilty of 60 of those or something like that probably maybe maybe more but jesus's blood has washed me away the scapegoat the goat has taken away my sin far away and the goat that died he died in my place that i can take his righteousness praise god amen 73 i went from 73 to zero just like that amen oh thank you jesus oh press can i just oh precious is the flow that makes me whiter snow there's no other fount i know nothing but the blood of jesus amen i such were some of you we were guilty of 70 40 50 some of you maybe just 10 but you're still guilty of 10 but jesus takes you down this hero amen he drops every charge the handwriting against you was brought it out praise god amen [Music] but church the route is most church members are antichrist following antichrist preachers who legalize sins that whole list they legalize them and say it's okay most of them and then church the awful part is they flaunt it right they fought their greed remember that one woman preacher a couple years ago went on and said uh if you want to sign a million dollar contract you need a thousand dollar pen so she bought this thousand dollar gold pen and signed her next book contract with it like that has something to do with spirituality she probably just sold out a toll to the devils probably what happened see that's not that's not humble that's prideful and that's being preached behind pulpits she needs to give a thousand dollars to the missionary account praise god right and just buy the cheap pens they flaunt it they flaunt their adulteries their sins they put christ to an open shame the bible said we must flee from those and anyone who condones any of these sins we've just read you church jesus remember this jesus attacked every part of the pharisees worship now church that was the first coming what about the second don't be discouraged if i got a ball out sin don't don't move don't be discouraged it's part of my job and remember brother mark said the bride's ministry is going to match jesus ministry amen we've got to continue the ministry of jesus praise god so we're going to have to ball out every aspect of their worship but at the same time we've got to keep our hearts pure for pure worship pure religion make sure it's sincere and we're tr we're doing all we can to leave sin behind and put the devils under our feet we've got to ball out all of theirs and we've got to take them to the cross and follow jesus daily amen he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he if he had to rebuke every part of the denomination service well so do we right let me just give that example like when brother amen went to that denominational church and they had beer in the basement that's quite a statement there beer in the basement so that part can be rebuked if we would have went there sunday morning maybe that women showing off their their cleavage or maybe they had uh men smoking cigarettes outside or looking at evil videos making foolish jokes before the service church we if we had the holy spirit we'd rebuke every part of their worship as well now if that's true we should make sure we come in here and we let the holy spirit correct us if just one or two things are off in our worship may we accept it and say god help every part of my worship to be pure help me to obey and live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god amen let that be our desire that we can take some correction not not not say well i i've given up so much can i have a little bit of this a little eleven leavens the whole church god help us to be sincere there's my 40 minutes give me five minutes here my glory i will close just a moment here see jesus now listen church he has to reject every he has to attack every part of their church service because they're full of iniquity they're full of it right they're full of iniquity they're full of sin loving religious worship so he has to rebuke every part of it only evil flows from their hearts and mouths corrupt trees only produce corrupt fruit like i said i appreciate the miracles remember i mentioned those miracles the brother i talked to from the assembly of god church but the thing to do would be follow those people around to see how they act the rest of the week like the one i had a roommate who uh who preached he now we both got saved about the same time he went with the apostolic oneness we both believe god was one but he went with the apostolic oneness i went to the message i shared the message with him he said brother brown was a false prophet i said well that's fine you could say whatever you want i believe it i believe it's true anyways and then we both started preaching and he would go in his room but amen he'd always preach on a sunday night and he would turn up the music and just shout and start speaking in tongues and screaming in other words he would just cry out to god for the anointing and he'd go to church and they'd have the anointing but he would come home and guess what he do church he'd watch dirty movies throughout the week and then we he and i would have prayer meetings he would speak in tongues i just speak regular and then he would break into this laughing spirit he would just laugh for like an hour straight and longer we'd have friends there and come out come to find out after he got married he neglected his wife and and spent all the money or he spent all his time on trying to build up his business in other words he was worshiping money and his wife committed adulteron they were divorced within two years when they got married and here i stand look where i stand i stand upon the the the right solid rock of god's word amen so you can see that man's foundation was saying because when the trials come everything fail but when the trials come for us we stand on thus saith the lord amen hallelujah [Music] i don't know why i'm bawling out so many people tonight but i guess that's just jesus's ministry today praise god i'm trying to close in the book i finished this section i said but god does have saved preachers and certain church members are saved in every denomination how many know that brotherhood said that there's saved catholics there's say methodist baptist he says it in the seals and there has to be because the bible says it most of the saved are foolish because they deny the full revelation of scripture now i made a list here i made a list for the the book of all these things that anyone should be able to see or are things christians should do well here let me read these are the ten uh most sinful teachings most churches accept homosexuality adultery they'll marry people two three times my wife and i our family members we have numerous family members that are married two three times fornication they'll let them live together and sleep together before they're married they don't say nothing about it in fact they're happy for them murdering babies through abortion and birth control pills women preachers substance abuse smoking drunkenness other drugs viewing sinful movies and television shows shameful hair lengths right that's shaming your spouse when a woman cuts hair that brings shame upon her husband and then shame upon christ when a man grows his hair long that's shame upon jesus false conversions they tell people that just say a prayer that they're filled with the holy ghost and they can do the greater works in christ in modest clothing yet they the bible says they have the attire of heartless they have a heartless spirit on them that's just ten let me read you five more now church let me read these five more water baptisms are you don't use the name of jesus anymore you sprinkle everything's outside the word how you gonna get the holy ghost when you you delete the way to the holy ghost they get rid of the three works of grace there's only one work god is three persons idolatry the transgender movement they can cross-dress men pants i'm sorry men's skirts women pants they can cross-dress all they want bruce jenner's okay that's okay that that man the olympic medal winner he's trying to be a woman that's okay if he's trying to do that he can take hormones and try to grow body parts like a woman that's okay that's sin that's wickedness that's abomination and some of them deny the supernatural power to perform miracles now church there's 1.3 billion roman catholics and of all those things i listed how many of them do they support we know catholics that are married twice three times protestants have 900 million how many of those 900 million watch those bad tv shows cross dress get baptized the wrong way eastern orthodox is the next biggest group with 270 million so you have catholics protestants ether eastern orthodox 270 million they're a lot like catholics anglican church has 110 million the oriental orthodox have 62 million and all others have 37 million which of those keeps all those commands that we just read very few but church we are some of the few praise god we are the little flock who's keeping the word of god who's letting the holy spirit wash and sanctify sanctify our lives such were some of you but ye are washed you're justified and you're sanctified by the spirit of god in the name of the lord jesus christ let's stand doesn't matter how beautiful their architecture is church does it matter uh how big their memberships are church out of those 73 the even one of those should should make us tremble for guilty of it because it's going to keep us from the holy ghost or it's going to keep us out of heaven and that's the kind of church we want to have right we want to search out our salvation as paul said with fear and trembling we just read it on sunday now which of those churches have fear and trembling with the word of god hardly any probably none of them there'll be a few believers in there but we should be a church that's fully cleaned out we want to be the bride of christ we want to be the mature woman the mature wife who fully submits to every word of her husband she's obedient to every word let's have our musicians come here praise god did everybody enjoy the word of god tonight i tried to put as much in there as i possibly could oh we're so thankful we have a good and gracious god a good and gracious king how many are thankful god corrects you in his love he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten it's something if you're guilty of something or for we need help let's be encouraged that god is trying to rebuke us god's trying to correct us that we might be hot and on fire for jesus that's the zeal this hour the zeal the hour is zealous repentance let's bow our heads for word of prayer here heavenly father we love you and bless your holy name tonight we thank you for the word that we've heard lord god i think of the men and women who've died through the church ages so that we
