TRANSCRIPT
========================================
PowerPoint but I'll tell you what the Lord has been so good and so kind and faithful always looking over me I know that and he looks over you and on that Glory day and we get crossed over and we're in the presence of God in that throne room and just maybe sitting in the what will we do but we it'll be continual praise and worship giving glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ to be forever um we'll have testimonies services for all eternity I'm sure there'll be one the Lord will Elevate one for a moment given the seat the spotlight and he'll be a son my my son my daughter whoever and just expound you know what it was like and this and this and I'm sure the Lord will be like stop and now behind let me set the stage for this a little bit and she didn't know this but there was a demon coming this way and there was a demon coming that way and I sent this come down and this come down and I stop that and and then then she prayed and then I was able to bring a fuller Deliverance a greater and then we'll see where we failed and the person will be like well I don't know why I went with this Lord but in the Lord was a I got this I'll take it from here and it'll go on and say well you miss this and you should have been here this time if you had only heard my voice a little bit clearer a little bit and if you were to believe my word and all that and still the person will be like well praise God it'll be there's no sadness over there's no disappointment there's no it's all Perfection over there it's divine love amen so let's get into this here by God's grace I so I got the text kinda early yesterday or however it was and uh from her pastor for the Jesse there uh man it's been nice to hear brother Ben Murad that guy is a power he's got the mental capacity of a minor maybe a small computer maybe you know I mean I can't remember half the stuff he says uh when he comes and ministers for us uh but uh you know the Lord knows so anyhow let's see oh wow we got a praise the Living God so let's go to Acts 1. Northern faithful he's watched over us all week there's nothing to complain about nothing to worry about uh we're just uh you know I keep thinking about my life and just uh where he's placed me I think and you know where you go you run through your failures and just don't know how the Lord was able to uh do what he did I I remember when I was in college and I was just a heathen I had no cares and just wanted to do what I wanted to do and um and now that was what 2000 or 1995 through 99 and I lived for myself I did whatever I wanted and now here 20 plus years later I find I don't have one free moment to do anything I want to do you know it's uh it's always either for somebody else it's for one of the Bride members or for helping someone that's uh you know down and out or however or it's for the ministry so that's uh how God ordains everything in Acts 1 and we'll start at verse 12. 13 14. he says then return they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey and they were when they were come in they went into an upper room where Abode both Peter James and John Andrew Phillip Thomas and Thomas and Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of alphaeus and Simon Zealot and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary and the mother of Jesus the mother of Jesus and with his Brethren and I'd like to jump to Acts 2 and verse 1. Acts 2 verse 1. and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound of a of Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven so let's say a word of prayer Our Heads dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we love you and Lord You've ordained this morning Lord and you've moved your children around in such areas and such locations Lord you shut door here and open the door here and however but oh God you're in all of it Lord and we love you we trust you and Lord we pray a blessing upon this assembly Lord this this family of Believers this local assembly Lord God that you would increase Lord our faith God increase Lord uh the stature Lord they are under the perfect man God lord and Lord Jesus so we certainly love you bless them and keep the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have receipts we're uh um so I was actually scheduled to do Sunday school for the the young the youngsters at home there and uh actually I'll be honest I actually actually I wasn't uh the young man I had scheduled to teach because now we got three young men who want to do Bible studies for the children and they're like brother side can I teach I'm like yeah let's let's test the water see how you do and now I have three and uh they are they're doing one by one and then the Young Brother texted me yesterday and said hey I I have to cancel I can't do it for this and this I said okay so my whole mind yesterday was after work was go home and study for uh Sunday school for the children then Pastor Jesse text me and said hey brother Ben uh canceled so now I had to had brother Dustin do my Sunday school so I could come here maybe next time I'll send brother Dustin out here I mean I don't know you guys want that I mean it's really Dustin's got you know he's got this hair he's got a sweet beard going and just real calm and collected probably run it like a business probably run it like a job site hey you worship harder get to work right yeah right so we'll see we'll see I'll talk to them about that uh remember Jesse actually so um uh this morning we want to uh go over just a little thought and I'd seen something in the quotes I'd never seen before and it was a blessing to me I actually taught this at my home church so it ended up being yesterday once again my wife and my sister-in-law took off to do their family things and because I always had to study and they left so brother cam was actually out of town too so I had to have Brody the big German Shepherd uh wrecking machine with his tail the size of a cedar and uh then I course had my little puppy so I didn't get much studying done last night because they're they don't want to play with each other necessarily they won't they're all both staring at me with their tongues out waiting for me to get up and to play with them and to to move and this and this I'm like guys I'm trying to study then they'll run out and beg for a treat and bark until I get up and it was it was Battle so we tried we did our best by God's grace so um other than that and then and and of course last Wednesday at our home assembly we had a special service and a brother had called me he gets our he got there first and said hey we don't have any power he did not have a key to get in the church but he's texting said there's no power so the assembly we got there and we realized that just our section of the street was shut down with power everything else was on I mean the street lights were on everything's on just our row of buildings was off and um so I brought my I had my flashlight with me always and then uh Dave had his but cam had one there at the church and we had like a flashlight service and it was a special service so the Lord was dealing with a couple topics and and that's the saints of God that's why we don't miss church anything gets in the way from you from missing church or run it out of your life be faithful to the house of God because it could be that one service where the Lord starts opening up things and you're starting to see a greater light you know the Bible says we're supposed to be growing in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ right and you know even when he was dealing Saint Paul was dealing in Hebrews 5 he was talking he says he said you have need uh you to be taught over again he says but if I teach you you're gonna have to need milk you're going to not meat right and he goes through and just lists the things there in Hebrews 6 about uh the things that uh he considers would be milk right and he goes to those things and if you notice one of them things is faith in God so and I know a lot of uh ministers are preaching on the promises and this and this and that's good but that's not the meat of the word and Paul said we must go on into Perfection see the deeper things that's that's and I know about your pastor but Jesse year goes into the deeper things that's very very important in fact a sister had texted me about a certain thing today this morning on the way here and she says are you guys having one service two service and I said well the second service is for the children and I said these children are Beyond uh Revelation wise and knowledge wise Beyond 99 of the children this message I'll bet the questions and things I've heard the mask and I'm just going and I even go home and just reflect on the way home I'm thinking how did they know it I mean and then I never forget the time I did a Sunday school with Lydia's sister Lydia was there and I was going over something I considered fairly fairly deep and Lydia's like I said does anyone understand this but he's like and I was like there it goes my punch line she took all the Thunder and she just rattled off and this is like it was just something off the top of her head she was thinking of yesterday you know where this morning on the way to church so there's always those who are just up and Beyond by the grace of God and that's how we should be right but we should know the word of God right because because the devil is here and he's going to use what he's going to use what do you use to save Eve this what do you use to deceive uh many times or try to deceive even Christ to use the word of God so we've got to know the word and not only that but we have to have the revelation of the word because the Satan is going to go look in this verse it says this and it'll stop right there or maybe he'll have two verses look right here and look right here but we've got to have the Revelation or the true meaning of what even those verses are saying right and that's where people can get into trouble so uh let's get into this by God's grace I just kind of rattled on there for about eight minutes and uh we won't hold you along but we want to express this to you by the grace of God the thought here and I would have to tie this maybe back to business um let me say it like this when when those are the book of Acts received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that first time it set them in motion it set them in Motion in such emotion that like brothers and who have to we have to go work to make a living right I don't know how it was here's the thing here's the questions I don't know what it was like back then 2000 years ago did Peter already have his house paid off did or did they even I mean what how did how did they survive if Peter and them would take time off I mean for months and weeks to follow Christ that their families would still remain intact and fed and the bills were paid how did this all work you know now one thing for surgeon they had Faith to do and one thing and another thing for certain God provided whatever they had but at that time they were they were so caught up after the infilling of the Holy Ghost that they put their lives in second place in fact they the Bible like I was talking to a brother at a he's a he's a he's a little bit older me but he's at a certain Factory I do little uh things for and and he was saying this and that and I said the Bible says we die daily that means we can wake up in the morning and say Lord this is for you this day once again that you have given me we've been given life Saints we've been given an error we've given a breath that we've been given a gift how many seeds have never come forth and yet here we are you were born for a very specific work and you must find your calling you must find exactly what God would have you because each one of you had and I said this a hundred times five right here before you have gifts laying within you right Lord God we must pray and say Lord God bring these things out because remember in the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell and they were set that was what the church in motion it was that it became a living church I'll say it like that it was a line for the first time those disciples who followed Christ for three three and a half years however you want to say from John the Baptist to Jesus they were technically not even alive at that time because what they were not born again they were not born of the spirit they were not spiritual creatures or animals however you want to say it and they were not able to produce exactly like Christ did amen sure so what when they they when they uh received the feeling of Holy Ghost there it changed their mindsets but remember they were at the fresh opening of the dispensation there was something new or this was something that has never even been talked about before and they know the Revelation had never been given they read that scripture in Joel they read the scripture here but in the prophesied of that time but they never had an understanding of it so we want to kind of get into this and uh uh in this topic here now as a businessman I I wanted to start a business and I I I do business uh uh in on the side here and there uh I do which is Plumbing we call it and it's not I mean people even think that as business I don't wear shirt and tie but I wear these and uh a little utility belt with all my tools and then I walk in there with the filthy shirt that have stains all over it my pants are stained and last business side yeah that's business [Laughter] not many people like that business but now notice that this quote here says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall that last move of God in the spirit when men and men and women dress like Christians went to church prayed all night took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit saints of God we've got to get back to more of this is that or say there's none of this happening it's happening but we need more of this this must consume Our Lives what Jesus saying when he's 12 years old he says I must be about my father's business right but when about the things of God fully consumed and as a like uh like last yes last night when I was trying to study the dogs and and all that I was like Lord I can't even this is I need to get freed up and set aside to do what to get into the word of God and dig and see exactly what God would have me to bring right he says he says what that because that is the business of Christ that is what his that is the whole point of him even coming is what not only to manifest him but what to send his life back into you so that now his bride can go and move into these things now uh in every if you look at the as the prophet God would teach about the first Eve how she fell what was the whole in fact as I listened to Christ the mystery of God revealed yesterday what was the whole point of everything the secret of the entire thing was right at the beginning but he's what the secret will be revealed at the very end it was there at the beginning but it revealed at the end the first Eve fell the second Eve right here as we just read right here this one fell as well right around 50 A.D or however you want to say 53 but the whole point was that God was going to produce an eve that would not fail that would not take the Antichrist Spirit right now he says they had dead churches and worshiped in homes in the store buildings they had reality see that was the original that was the church that was alive he says but it wasn't too too long a time when they began to have enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns in the choir they organized the movement and ran it by man and soon they began to read books that were fit for them to read they ran they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone my if we could just get that cry of Joy back into our lives and just say when we get onto the job in the morning everybody's like uh some guy's got their energy drinks you know a job and some got their coughing this and we just go in there and say Lord say Brothers my friends are Romans countrymen let me hear God open your ears hear what I have to say God is coming soon amen and see let them deceiver that you have excitement there's joy I hit up a guy yesterday and I his name was Anthony I said Anthony and he's a single man he's about to propose to his girlfriend his brother he was he's getting his getting in his truck and I said hey if you need Bible studies we've got to go I said because our pastors weren't worth a certain situation A Certain topic on Wednesday and I said when this thing goes it's gonna be over whatever condition you are when this thing strike that's what you're going to stay and he goes he goes it's that's close I said it's always that close it's always that close because why you don't know when your last day is amen and that's the true saints of God we think we got tomorrow we got we think we've got a month from now we got plans for next year or this year but since God when is your last day when is our last breath when is our last moment even before the Rapture amen we've always got to be ready 2015 I lost my Apprentice I did not know it that was his last day in fact last night and this morning was the exact same same kind of day it was this fall came in late last night and sat real thick and then I wake up this morning and boom it was just it reminded me exactly of of newbie and how that thing was all set up so he says now notice he says they're crying for the joy of the The Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone he says oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes it was all that was left right so now um let's continue on here trying to uh serve to God a service without being his will the will of God God said he says how would he do it today how would he restore all the things that he would do again he promised to restore that's exactly right now think about this after service on Wednesday probably can't preach on a certain subject and I'm sitting there and I'm just going and I'm seeing I'm seeing the picture and I'll say this I've seen the picture but it's getting clearer more clear there's still blurry spots there's quite a bit of blurry here and there's a blurry there and the edges aren't exactly tight or sharp and even some of the inside stuff isn't sharp but the saints of God it's getting clearer and clearer and I told after a service there on the sidewalk we went out because that was the only place where light it was outside [Laughter] was I went out and I said brother I said think about this Jesus in Revelations 1 had all seven stars in his hand and the Bible says that was literally the prophet God brought out he says the when there was light those stars were shining he says that was not their own light they have no light of their own but they were only reflecting the Light of Christ that was holding him he is the pillar of fire when that pillar fire blood I was like this rain he answers light they are able to see it and catch it absolutely just like when Moses was 40 days and 49s with the with the pillar of fire while he came down and the Bible said they put ahead and put a veil over his face why because he's face shown he was reflecting that light and I said now notice he said these Seven Stars were sent to Seven Ages and he said yes Pastor Cam's like yes I said but what did they do when each star comes forth what did it do it did two things each star broke out of a denominational spirit and it was unorganized every one of them was unorganized as the prophet of God said he says there was always a cycle of life and then there was a cycle of death saints of God our Prophet came out unorganized he said I don't belong to idiom he says but I want to include them all he said a Baptist invites me I'll go and preacher him if a Methodist vitamins come preaching him he said the reason I stick with the Pentecostals he says because they support my meetings amen praise be to God it says so does the businessmen they support me he says well I've got to preach for what I'm calling and where I'm open where the doors are open but by the end of his ministry what the doors had been shot and he was only into certain spots and however the saints of God when he when God sent that angel up it was unorganized and if the prophet of God said he said he said that's the cycle of life and death where are we at right now 60 years past 1963 where the seals were revealed right amen so those things are always on my mind now notice he says he says all the all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop her no communism Catholicism nothing else will stop it I will restore saith the Lord all the man-made Roman trees that will ever hang in there all the graves will ever keep it out he's all the big denominational Stones laying over the door will never keep it there I will restore saith the Lord there will be an Easter I'll bring forth that same church in its same power and bring that bride out just like she was back there with the same signs the same fruit the same fruit was that the fruit of the spirit love kindness Joy meekness Temperance patience Divine brotherly kindness and then what cap it off with what the Holy Ghost charity right he says we need to see more of these if we don't see these in the message then there's something wrong right he says he says I'll bring that bride out just like she was back there with the same signs saying fruit the same thing they did I'll bring her back I will restore saith the Lord restore all the denominationals that eat off restore all the organization Aid off I restore all of it uh saith the Lord amen now this movement this work in Romans 9 verse 26 and this shall come to pass that in that place where it was said to them ye are not my people there shall be called the year not my people that there shall they be called the children of the Living God who knows that's us that's the Gentiles right there we did not know anything about God we uh we have examples of ourselves we have we have uh um uh who's the who's the Harlot um in Joshua's day Rahab she said I've heard of it right he says he says how great your God is what he did to this a nation what he did to this King and what this King and and that Nation however he says and and the messenger said well he says we're coming your way as well and she said what he says I want to serve your God and they said this will be the token what let out that red thread right that Scarlet thread showing what it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost correct the blood of Christ and then what now at that time Rahab married one of the king of the hosts what and she came now into the into that camp right now Isaiah's also cried concerning Israel know the number of the children Israel shall be as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be saved now notice for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth I mean I mean I don't know about anyone here but I know in my life I see I need more I need to come up higher than I've ever been then I've had then I can even think that I can go what are they doing the Marines they push you beyond what you think you can do I heard of a man uh who was a businessman when he went to a certain marine or however in like an endurance athlete and he was a marine or however maybe sealed or something and and he wanted to do like a training session with him and uh so he meets him and says how you doing how you doing blah blah he says are you ready to get to work and he said absolutely and then the Marine says he says give me 100 push-ups or sorry 100 pull-ups right now and he goes 100 and the guy was overweight and this and that an hour and the guy said yeah 200 right now you know what he did he didn't stop it might have been one by one but he did a hundred that day [Laughter] why because because I remember when he when that officer he said he said give me a hundred in his mind he's like that number 100 is a huge huge number knowing himself he could probably do maybe five in a row maybe 10 in a row but to do a hundred it didn't matter if you could do in a row you had to do a hundred right amen but God is at a spot right now where he's going to push us beyond what we thought think about this what about all the children of God that gone before you and the Lion's Den in the fiery furnace caves and and dwelling in the wilderness what about those in the Holocaust the Germans I was like the the Jews who made it through there their sacrifices the life they lived or on we can't even imagine what it was like the their loss of their mother their children their this or that however and they still pushed on Saints but God said in this time he says he's going to make a quick short work he's going to gather it all up in one time and what will be out of here by God's grace amen sure now now I've wondered this for a long time I've heard other administers say and even a church age book says we really don't know what took place in the upper room they said they were praying with Suffocation but what was really going on up there what was what was being what was occurring up there in them 10 days 120 men and women met up in an upper room in a building much like this probably or however open I don't know who was separated however but something took place up there that caused the Holy Ghost to come down in such a way and I found a couple quotes on it and now it's clear it gets clearer and clearer what we need to do and what God's going to drive if it's going to be a quick short work he's going to drive us to something I mean think about this the Lord the Lord Jesus was on the Mish he was on a mission for three years and that that that business of his or that Ministry of his caused so much hatred and anger and those sort of things that what it caused himself to be crucified but not only that it put fear in his disciples at the same time and now they were on the run it looked like you know because we were associated with him and and even though he rose again we still didn't have the boldness of The Bravery to continue on so the Lord said he says before he just ascended he said he said go and tarry in Jerusalem right now notice this in the day that thou that when Jesus Christ was crucified sent back he said did you blasphemy you'll be forgiven but when you blast him the Holy Ghost it'll never be forgiven for the people wasn't sealed the work of God wasn't finished yet the sacrifice wasn't made Jesus hadn't been crucified the Holy Ghost had to come but on the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind and those Jews that had been crying and sighing for the Abomination did in the city what were they doing praying and supplication yeah not just that but they were sighing and crying Imagine This you're a fisherman your father was a fisherman your father was a fisherman and you could trace your lineage all the way back to Abraham all the way back to this tribe or that tribe or that great General this this and you're a Jew and you're in Israel right now and now you're ruled by Romans you're under Roman rule here we are oh my and then what all of a sudden a man who comes out and says follow me and something inside of you pulls you to follow him did they even know what they were doing they had no clue just something inside they heard a voice an audible voice of a man that said come follow me and they dropped their Nets the Bible said and looked at this man and started following him I couldn't even imagine that I'm a plumber I've got a job to do I got Prince I got markers and I highlight this and I highlight that and I said I gotta make cart runs and I gotta make part lists and I gotta do this I gotta worry about Manpower and this and that and how would this and I got a schedule with everybody this this what if someone said come follow me and I'm like and I'm soldering in this pipe or welding this pipe like this or however and I hear her come follow me do I leave the welder running take off my weld helmet put it down take my weld jacket off and follow this guy leave my work truck [Music] the foremans are going uh the other superintendents are like where are you going it's I am like he said to follow him they're like what are you doing we've got we've got timetables don't you know on Monday this is going to arrive and you've got to put pipe this up so we can get heated here come on Psy but he said follow me saints of God think about your lives what if someone said come follow me oh my it'll happen one day very very soon because what was the rapture come up hither there is a voice going to Spring down from heaven it's going to usher and echo down from heavens and come follow me come up hither now notice here we read over in the book that it was said the angel went forth and put a mark on those whose side and cried for the Abomination was done in the city and realizing by the scripture now notice we would have never known this was that except by Malachi 4. and realizing realizing by the scriptures that that was the first coming of the Holy Spirit through the city of Jerusalem he says and when he had his second return in this age to call people out of the Gentiles for his name how much more should we be concerned and sighing and crying for the Abominations as did saints of God think about it these guys heard the voice of God they followed Jesus for three and a half years they had they were out of high school they had friends in high school maybe even while they were fishermen but they didn't go to college but they were there was a tax collector he might went to college however and they had friends all in Israel they grew up it was probably a very friendly area and they had to forsake everyone maybe some of their friends were the ones saying crucify him crucify him I got friends right now in high school I witnessed back to the baptism to them and they just reject it and I'm thinking and these were good friends they were good to me and I was good to them we had a lot of fun we had a lot of Fellowship we had we did we ran around together and did fun stuff and then to see them reject the baptism the very baptism of God revealed to me and has changed my life our heart should be breaking our hearts should be crying out for their souls that God would crying out for what an opening of their eyes an opening just like the Bible talks about Lydia a seller of P purple and how God had to open up her heart to see the gospel amen he says and then in the second coming return He says how much more should we be concerned in sign crying for the Abominations did he says we see churches practicing rock and roll playing bingo all kinds of things swimming contests and so forth where prayer meetings and all night tearing meetings is forgotten yo brother I'm talking about all night prayer meetings like many many times [Laughter] I'll be I'm gonna I haven't done one since we had like a lock-in in like 2013 or 2012. and all night prayer meeting we haven't done that in over 11 years and yet we're at the darkest age we see our Humanity completely falling apart it's riding in its core the mentality the ability to think with good reasoning is gone it's gone you are you are the minority for you to be able to think straight and have be able to see these things you are the Bible says a special chosen people A peculiar people oh the only ones on the faith you're face of the Earth that can actually think straight and they come up with good logical reasoning I'm not talking about the guys out there the big names that these are all Catholic guys fighting against uh who is a woman this that no their cat they're blinds too I'm talking about spiritually everything amen now God sent us back to the real thing let the Holy Ghost come on among these people tonight Lord he says and star a Pentecost right here Grand Lord in every heart truly that one it's their hearts to do it but the cares of the world and the swiftness of the passing of time has just moved them out Lydia you're 18 years old Emma's going to be 20 in a couple months this month I hit 46. this thing is moving at such a pace and I'm thinking if I see 70 that's only literally less than 24 years 20 wait it's 24 years I'll be 70. that's not a lot of time you young people it's it's coming you this thing moves so fast every decision is so important obey your mothers and fathers because they are watching over you to to make good decisions for you while you are under their headship be obedient to them they love you they are trying to watch out for you don't give this world one second thought about any of it there is no joy out there there is no happiness out there there is no real friendship I'll say like that out there there is no truth out there and that's what we love the Bible says we love the truth amen praise be to God what and that's why he chose us because what we love the truth and for sanctification of the spirit there's nothing out there our goal our vision should be what perhaps sure but the cares of the world and the swiftness of the passing time has just wooed them out Lord start from this Pulpit from me to go to the audience and move over like before and give us that 04 lost souls to make more money to grow a business to be better pipefitter to to make a collection of this or a collection of that or or to do this hobby or what no what did the prophet say let us win souls win Souls was last week brother Austin invited somebody he didn't make it but he invited somebody he was caring for their souls wanting to hear the good word of God that we've all heard to partake in this Fellowship to meet the Saints of like and precious Faith amen yes sure caring about lost souls he says he says now this one with the ink horn on his side was the Holy Spirit now notice after that he went through he went and turned to those he turned those men loose with the slaughter slaughtering weapons he said utterly destroy destroy all both young and old young Maids little children's spare nothing he says and don't come near any of those who have the Seal of God on them see things of God when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is your safety he's not necessarily talking about this he's talking about your soul you can never ever be lost when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you could have confidence you can have faith you can have hope in those things amen absolutely he says now what did it now when now when did that take place that was the early Pentecostal church when the Holy Spirit went through and marked out Church and notice when this and I'll say like this if that was the shadow if the Old Testament is a shadow and the New Testament is the real and then now where two thousand years passed the old the New Testament is now our shadow of what the Bible said what these are examples to us not just not just Moses not just Joseph and and all them around there but now Paul Peter James and John those are examples for us and what they wrote the Holy Ghost has ordained for us Amen to learn from to read to gain knowledge and wisdom sure now let's continue on here so as I I'd already taught on that a while back because when I read that I said I said unbelievable Ezekiel 9 is the Pentecostal movement oh well here's what I was going to get to when that Pentecostal move did it just save 144 120 people because directly that same day the Bible said three thousand were baptized with the Holy Ghost but notice it had to start with a small group first to bring forth the abundance see I'm telling you there's something coming it'll be just the last ones will be saved but there's got to be a solid core group to get this started there's got to be someone that there's got to be that the elected will do it I'll just say like that it's gonna it's gonna happen Jesus said what I will restore it's going to happen now so as I thought about this and I thought about Ezekiel 9's Pentecost and this that I thought well what about Ezekiel Ezekiel it's the same that was before this so no notice says brother cam was working Wednesday where the cam was working on Wednesday with Samson and brother Cam said he heard many ministers type those Seven Locks that he had with the seven Church ages so he went and studied it and this and that and brother man never said there were seven Church ages so what do they mean could they be the seven Thunders because it was on his head it was a covenant it was a it was a Nazarite vow separated to the Lord only those separated the Lord could that hair grow and that hair represented the Covenant of a wife right but now notice here here we find another prophet that God touched now notice in verse 3 and he put forth the form of a hand and took me by the lock of mine head something about this Covenant hair sisters you have you have no idea well you do you know exactly what your Covenant with your hair is a very special thing he and God used that same long hair that same Covenant with Samson and now we see it now even used here with Ezekiel and it was when that and now notice God came and took that one lock not seven just one God only needed him to grow one lock he only had one lock as far as God grabbed and with that one lock he was able to be elevated and gain a revelation of what was going on in the Church of God and what did God show him with that one hair of Locke he lifted him up by that Nazarite vow or however you want to say it by that Covenant by that representation on his head that what God is Christ and Christ is God Jesus is uh is Jehovah of the new correct now notice and what the first things he saw and I remember if you think about this because my mind had to place it because now I've already taught this in the New Testament what this in the New Testament is because the prophet said what these are or revealed some of them but what was it back then if Ezekiel 9 was the Pentecost of the 104 120 were sealed with the Holy Ghost and this was beforehand what was the other ones now notice furthermore no then he said unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now way the way toward the north so I lifted up my eyes toward the North and behold northward at the Gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entrance so the first thing revealed by God grabbing this lock up and giving him a revelation was this image of jealousy now this is my opinion but I believe in this age is brother Branham when someone says uh if you don't say brother Graham 20 times I'm not listening to sermon okay that's a problem somebody's lifted up somebody a little too much when what there's only one name under heaven whereby we might be saved amen and that is the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is what there's salvation is not in William brand of Salvation is in what Jesus Christ Jehovah Our Savior amen but what would it be back then 2000 years ago before Pentecost what would be the image of jealousy back then notice in John 5 and 43 I come in my father's name and he will receive him uh receive me not if another come in his own name him will you receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek ye not the honor that Cometh From the uh God the only do not think that I will cause accuse you of the father there is one that accuses you even Moses in whom he trusts the people that Christ encountered in the religious realm in Jerusalem could not get away they would not let go of Moses and move on to God four of ye would believe Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me he was giving them all the plain Clues they needed said why don't you read the Bible why don't you read the law why don't you read about the the the Lambs and the Bulldogs and the goats now he said that represented me amen then that what about the sacrifice of the blood on the Altar and those sort of things he said that was represented me everything representative he says for if you believe not his writings how shall he believe my words I'll say like this do they believe it's brother Brandon what he preached if they're doing such and such here and doing such and such here leaving some quotes out and emphasizing they'll make a Doctrine off one quote when there's 30 or 40 more saying the opposite do they really believe what Moses said come on now notice he says then again they called they they called the the man that was blind and said to him God give God the praise we know that this man is a sinner really and the answer said whether he be as a sinner iron or not he says or no he says I know not one thing I know is that where I was blind now I see then they said unto him again what did he what did he do to thee oh wait what did he to thee how did he open Thine Eyes saints of God I've heard this would my cousin Adam's testimony you tell him you tell him he was meeting with a he was going to a certain church with his wife cousin Adam you went cousin Adam he just got delivered from drugs from 20 18 to 20 years I mean hardcore just gone right just only the hand of God dream and he went and gave his testimony before the pastor and his wife and he said I was at a certain place at the rehab place he said they had three sermons a day preaching this and this he says and I was down to the Altar and a brother started praying over me he said and I felt a fire come in he says and just devoured everything so he's telling the testimony to the pastor and the pastor's wife said what said what'd she say she said she said but how did you how did you feed drugs and Adam looked like his wife and said or look at the wife goes like this and no I just told you he says God the fire of God came in and she goes no no what did what did you do to overcome this and Adam said he said it like three or four times and finally to Jody and said we gotta go so Pastor of a mega church so carnal was the wife she must have never ever had one experience of the supernatural if you don't understand the Supernatural and how God can come down and do something she must have never been she must have been in a worship service and never even felt the presence of God to not understand that that God can come in you and burn something out or do I mean I was blown away he just looked at me said sorry he goes she just did not get it she passed on already but now notice what they said he says the answer and says I've told you already Adam's like I told you already he says but you were not here why because God had already shut up her ears oh my goodness hopefully the Lord did something before she passed wherefore when you hear it again will you also be his disciples now notice what was the problem in Christ's day he said they said they reviled him and said Thou Art his disciple but we are Moses's disciple Christ knowing all things Discerning all things he knew what they said the very God that Moses served was the one right before him he was the one that healed him and now they're saying we don't know who this guy is but we know who Moses was we know that God spake unto Moses but for this fellow we not know from whence he is Moses didn't heal anybody as far as I know that Moses say bring forth a hand to never Moses Ever Raised the Dead no he's doing greater things in this in this thing not in nature even he did nature stuff too but in this thing Moses didn't do anything ah there's our image of jealousy now notice the second thing they saw so I went and saw him behold every form of creeping beasts and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house Israel portrayed round about the wall and there stood before him 70 men of the Ancients of Israel of the House of Israel in the midst of them through the jazzaniah the son of chiffon which every man his sensor in his hand and thick clouds of incense went up this is the first this would be the second or the deed or the doctrine of the Nicolaitans and of course we have the first groups of men who are the groups of men back then the scribes lawyers Sadducees Pharisees and zealots everything that we know these things represent this day it was back then as well now he's going into the second room there or the uh the room that he sees things and the Lord said unto him and he said unto him turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater Abominations that they do then he brought me to a door of the gate in the Lord's House which was towards the North and behold there are sat women weeping for tammuz now remember they were in Rome they were under Roman control even though it was Jerusalem but remember this was a prophecy the word of God every word of God is a prophecy think about everything Adam said think about everything Adam did what Eve did everything was if this is if this is recorded as the word of God in such a way then it has a prophecy to it everything is a prophecy that's why that's why Paul can pull in in in Ezekiel or sorry in Ephesians 5. he says uh he says he says what God said he says she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh he pulled that from Adam Paul pulled that from Adam what it was a prophesy prophecy not just of Eve but what of the Bride of Jesus Christ sure and since they were in Rome and at that time God was revealing to them things were taking place in Jerusalem had nothing it must have been something to do with saturnalia absolutely that's a Roman Feast the Roman Pagan feast completely I guarantee you the influence the influences of Roman society of that Roman Spirit would touch I'll say like this what was the difference between the Jewish Spirit at that time and the Roman spirit not much difference one looked religious one was not did not look religious even though it was but they both Rome and Israel wanted Christ dead and they had it done on shows they were under what the Same Spirit now of course we see the very last thing Sun worshipers we can't prove anything then he said to him he has thou seen this oh son of man yet turn thee again yet again and thou shalt see greater Abominations of these and he brought me forth in the inner core of the Lord's house now notice this is the Jews right in the Lord's House and behold at the porch the door of the porch of the Lord between the porch and the altar were about Five and Twenty men and their backs were toward the Temple of the Lord and their faces toward the East and they worshiped the sun towards the east Sun worshipers within our day the Roman Catholic Church they worship the Sun so what was it going back there they were there had to be some kind of priesthood there had to be some within that priesthood who were worshiping the son who what pulled from Rome absolutely now can we prove it no but I'm just teaching it as a shadow and type of exactly what took place in Ezekiel 9. now Pagan Rome sure now our business the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that went as Souls is wise when we first started our assembly after Bill Jesse gave us this blessing and said start one here in Napoleon Ohio we went out with Zeal it went door-to-door knocking on doors and this and that we had very little success why because we're in the days of Noah we're in the days a lot the best way we're going to win Seoul right now is to pray and fast and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to lead us and guide us to these lost sheep they don't remember they're they look like goats but they're sheep they look like goats but they're sheep that was one we were one but what I had to take off my my goat clothing to reveal oh I got my own wool that's all right yeah right on you're slower where's the pasture right amen the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that went as Souls is wise saints of God let this mind be in you I'm just starting a new job as far as uh yesterday we're four hours got rained out but I start that new job with two other guys tomorrow and I'm going to be trying to sow more seeds than I ever have I had a I had a dream about a year ago that I sent something on the certain texting site and they were not happy with me so um I gotta start laying down stuff I have to get more serious about the Lord's business people are dying every day you witnessed to him nothing you witness and Lord God where are these Seed where are the where are your people we want to know now notice a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in the Revelation was given given to a martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those that have been that have striven the one the other is for those that have given both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of their plots of the world their Glory will fail for those who give their lives to God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given a Crown of Life see what are we doing right now we're striving to what stay clean and this is this is this is lamp trimming time I'll say like this is the time where if we have if there's an age where you have to stay clean it's this age rubbing shoulders with brother awesome was telling me there's the other day about how rough it is to work and the things the personalities and it is a battle to have the right response someone says this and you're like you do that like bird neck like you know like oh yeah no no no here's how we gotta be they threw something else you're like lamb like or Dove like amen right kind and sweet I was with a certain brother and I was we were going to get him a suit and uh there's people there's women in the parking lot says Hey sir will you sign this act that we're gonna we're gonna allow women to have uh uh access to Women's Health Care in this I said no I don't believe in that you know and she's like well you're a Christian are you a Christian I said yeah I'm a Christian School yeah but God has given us right we have three more agency this and I said I said and I and I I I'll say this I I probably should have acted a little bit different I should have went and said sister would you like some Bible studies on there I said are you a Christian she said yeah I says when it came down to it I said you better pray on this and she was yelling at me you know because you know brother Brooks was watching and I said you had better prey on what you're doing because it's the God that I have is telling me this is wrong but for some reason whatever you're serving is telling you it's right I said you better pray on it you can tell them you can tell them but Lord what what will they do everyone has a choice now he says all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and in Eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up our in heaven those good Treasures which are available to this faithful Saints I've been trying to give more I've been trying to witness more and I'm just like saying Lord God what do you what do you want me to do what is what is a clear path for me Lord open up or brighten that light and shoot it on the path you want me to take you know Lord what would you have me to do now notice here I want to throw this in this was the first now notice what it says right here laboring for the Lord doing the things of God but remember that quote before I said how time has rudest silent and wooed us to sleep and and done those sort of things here right here is a powerful this is the first Parable ever given as far as in Matthew 13. and it goes through the the seed the sower the four kinds of grounds right but now notice I want to concentrate on the the last two grounds here in Luke 4 14 8 and 14 and that which fell among the Thorns are they which have heard they which heard have we all heard absolutely go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection saints of God this is not our goal they heard it they accepted it but something was kept pulling their life away from them pulling their energy their focus all that away from them so they would not be able to produce Christ like they wanted to but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience even though this is a parable Jesus explained it he explained this so literally there's no excuse God have mercy on me but now notice what Jesus said this is a key parable did you know this was the key parable it's given first for a reason Pastor cam hit this and it just blew my mind and when he was alone they that were about him were about 12 asked him the parable and he said to him unto you it is given to know the mystery the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and yet not understand less anytime they should be converted their sins could be given him and he said what did Jesus say know ye not this parable and how shall ye know all parables when he read that to me I said teach serpent seed I understand it but this first Parable is so important that I don't let anything of the world creep in not bad things I'm talking cares and the riches or however you want to say it or a nice car or I need this or I desire to have more of this or bigger how none of that that's got to go all this has to go to bring forth greater fruits it's time for me to let my eyes off of the cares of these things I don't know what it's like being a mother outside that I'm a plumber because every day every night them children want that Mama to do this they want that Mama do that Lydia's little mom too helping out or not mamas but they're not children but her sister Brothers but as a plumber I get a call from this brother I get a call from this person right I do my eight hours I do my 10 hours but then after that I gotta go home load up my truck and I take off I don't get a moment's break because this one has this and this one has this and the saints of God I have to crucify that I have to learn a little little word two-lettered word no right and it's really getting at first it's like I've seen it come for the last 10 15 years no no no no I have to put I have to do it now I feel such a pressure to do this I have to say no you know what I want to do you know what my heart's desire is I'll just be honest you know what my heart's desire is I want to go home I want to read the Bible and pray that's all I want to do because I see this thing coming closely we have to concentrate what is a Nazareth about it's a separating from all the things unnecessary do only that which is essential for to living if you have a better opportunity to do this or better after you do this and it's going to take more away from God do not do it sometimes I I'm not a pastor but I enemy pastors because they well a lot of them here in America they don't have to work a job they get to wake up study and pray study and pray study and pray and I'm like man that would be nice and then I see Brothers like brother Jazz who writes book and studies in praise and writes books and four sermons and Lord God help me amen now let's continue on here he says but being that is given a hundred and something uh here the prophet talking about this uh somebody gave him a hundred and hundred and something 17 or something uh the brother told me thank you my precious son so many are friends he said somebody gave him some money he says I will take that straight to the mission field to feed some hungry children to say children who believe only the message did you say children who are the children of message believers saints of God anytime you see anyone in need whether they agree with you or not if you see a Catholic Who's down and out if you see a Baptist Who's down and out help them they are a living their soul is worth ten thousand worlds because remember I was a Pentecostal I was Assemblies of God at one time and my mom started out my dad was Catholic there are seed of God out there people all over the world need things they desire they need help I just had a sister text me from Thailand she's she's African and her husband and her were over there they were doing whatever they just lived over there and her husband went back to Africa to do something and he died and now she's stuck in Thailand she just lost her job and she's texting me brother Simon can you help me what do you do does she believe the message of the hour no you pre-trinitarian probably wouldn't we help her yeah we gotta help her she's a living soul he says do everything that I can to make it count the prophet God saw Every Soul as an opportunity now weather now notice he's not even talking about bringing him the word of God he's just saying if they need a meal give it to them the simple things like that at that day when rewards are given out you'll see where it went God ever bless you that's a portion of your living that we want that we share with others and right now we're still blessed enough to have remember your dollar here can go way bigger over there in all these other countries it's almost like maybe Great Britain or however like these what they call third world countries your dollar can go Way Beyond some of them can live off 100 a month from U.S you can make a major difference for people and also it would cost us is fifty dollars I mean if whatever ask God to lead you and guide you where to help people still were up riches in heaven now notice charged in them that are rich in the in this world that they'd be not high-minded leave the message I'm not going to help this poor person the things of God God have mercy bless you Jesus bless you he says nor trust in uncertain riches but in the Living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good work so am I he says ready to distribute well the boss just gave me 100 bucks you better hold that and say Lord now we've already given our tithes we've already given our offerings Lord what would you have me to do this what would you have me to do with this make everything count your finances your time is obviously the most precious thing your time is so valuable he says willing to communicate willing to witness willing to be uh to give encouragement or however call your brother call your sister he says lay up and store for themselves they lay up and store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come he said that they may lay hold on eternal life the Bible says let your good works be sent of what be seen of all men he says my kingdom is not of this world my treasures is not in this world my treasures is in heaven and my interest is God's people Church don't pattern yourself after some pastor's wife or some minister's wife or evangelist wife the wife patting yourself after the Bible right amen saints of God you be you you do what you can do God knows what you can do and if you yield to the Holy Ghost he can use you in ways he can multiply your gifts you can multiply your givings that's the truth he says uh we're just about down here he says call people call themselves with the Holy Ghost and playing all them old nasty tunes and things brother that's the Buzzard inciting feeling uh feeding on that you need the Holy Ghost in there feeding on the word of God he says amen and I hang your anger with you brother but you've got to know the truth amen he says that's the reason you can't have prayer meetings you ain't got no time for it only interested in one thing that's better in the church a little better teaching your people wearing a little better clothes drive a little better car get a little better job pay more ties that's it live in Manchester so forth oh mercy but what he says what was his whole Focus having a prayer meeting because with that prayer meeting will produce more with the hand of God than anything else we could have a big we could I could call a brother Amen brother Austin but Malachi says Lydia those that play this I said hey let's do a real church service we'll do a whole music service and we're gonna we're gonna worship God and you're gonna sit out there and let us worship for you we should all be in the worship right or should we have a time when we just say let's come together and pray for about two hours and we're gonna we're all gonna unify and agree on a certain thing what do we want to see and focus all our prayers what bring the incest incense up to God and see what God does how he answers we'll accomplish more of that away amen he says and heathens are dying 144 000 140 000 a day without knowing Jesus Christ pull all kinds of money for everything else well I need I need a new welder or I need the poor missionary on the field leading his life out starving to death for they'll raise up on the day of judgment and condemn you and send you away their testimony will condemn them amen then talk about the real the Holy Spirit seal amen see how much see how important this is now we come to church we're faithful in these things this is our this is our life this is our not not just it's not really a duty this is our desire this is this is what we do right we are Christians we serve the Living God this is a time of worship right but we can also hit this area as well be bigger it's like this what what the Bible says Jesus said is more blessed to give than to receive the Lord sees every single penny every single nickel or dollar that you do to help somebody whether you tell anybody or not one day I was out with my apprentice and we went and got breakfast sandwiches because he's like he's really new you know he's like sorry I'm starving can we get a breakfast sandwich it was first break right so we drive downtown in the hood to my secret spot I went in there ordered them it was a bacon egg and cheese on white they really do it good I'm telling you if you guys ever and Toledo let me know I will buy so we go get it we walk outside with our bags we're all like super proud and we get my truck and a homeless man comes up to me right on my window and he's like hey man can you get some gas for me I've got a gas can but my car I live in my car it's right over there you can come check it out I don't have any gas to keep warm at night leaves his car on idle stay warm and my Apprentice was like I go I said yeah buddy I can help you out so I grabbed the gas can I said how much do you need these are just just a couple dollars I was like so I go there we fill it up I fill it up five gallons right fill it up bring it to them and I'm doing this in front of my apprentices to let him to show him how to do this did my boss lose some money yeah I lost about 30 minutes okay gas station went brought it to him drove to his vehicle got it to him gave him an extra twenty dollars he said thank you manage appreciate you go down and I could see his he was legit he was living in his car downtown Cleveland and we drove off and I told my Apprentice I said you know I did that and he goes why'd you do that I said because when he looked at me his blue eyes were just like my dad's that's somebody's dad somebody's brother somebody's son I said that's a living human being and he needed help you making what you make better be able to make help him so we had a little windshield time here teaching about Works giving we have abundance give to those I don't know why he's there I didn't know why he was in that situation why was he there I don't know what happened his life did his wife leave him did this happen is that his is his child committed a suicide and he just gave up in life I mean I don't know what happened but he needed help amen and I want to throw this in here I was taking a nap one day and I was listening to the Book of John you can stand here the saints of God I'll say there's anyone who knows me here it's probably my my nieces and nephews they know I'm I cut up a lot they know my faults and failures they see sometimes I say things I shouldn't say I do things I shouldn't do uh not wicked bad but just you know just just me you know just the carnal flesh just cutting up too much or there was this and that but I've tried to live a Christian Life the best I can when it comes down to it we'll take a stand if I see a certain thing in the scripture I gotta teach it if I hear a certain thing over this and that and I agree with it I'm gonna I'm gonna back it that's all I got there's a there's a point saying it's God we're we're who we are when it comes to Salvation when it comes to gospel we are all business we're a militant this is a war and we've got there's coming time where these decisions will be made it's coming we've got to stand and be ready to stand and as I was looking I was taking a nap and I was you know listening and yet still kind of out of it a little bit but I was listening and then I had drifted a little far and I got to John 21. and the man that was reading it said this he says this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God and when he had spoken spoken this he said saith unto me follow me and when I heard follow me I shook I literally shook in my sleep and woke up and I started listening and the Bible says then Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast to supper and say Lord which is he that betrayeth thee Peter seeing seeing him saith Lord what shall this man do and Jesus unto him if I tear what if if it if I will eat Terry till I come wasn't to thee follow thou me saints of God we are trying our best to follow Christ I don't know why I woke up and I heard this and I like literally I felt my body shake and I come up on my sleep and I'm like Lord I want to follow you everything in my heart wants to follow you most the time in My Own Strength I think I can give all this up I can give it all up two thousand 11 or 10 I lost my house build it with my hands my papa even helped me build it but that was in a time when the banks were giving crazy loans I just couldn't afford it and I lost it if you ever lost the house especially one that you built with you and you take that kind of blow and you take it and you go on and then you recover and you get another place I'll tell you what it does something to you where it means nothing to you it means nothing if it would happen again I could let go of any house because all that labor that went into it meant absolutely zero nothing is nothing's Eternal here until we enter the millennium somebody else I drive past the house every once in a while and somebody else is living it they move this and put a building over here and they actually moved the well because they didn't have water because the well guys didn't well drill it and I drive past and I'm thinking Lord you allowed that to teach me something we have no continuing City what I have right now can go be gone tomorrow and there's nothing you can do I fought and I worked every side job I could to make that payment I was hardly ever at home I was working that try how it started but I did everything I could possibly I meant nothing so what's the most precious now what's the thing the Gospel of Jesus Christ I realized that how important these things are eternal these things are what God's going to give us rewards we've already got salvation now we're just what saying Lord God what do you what can I I oh we are oh we owe here we owe him he paid the price for us for our sins for my iniquities I mean sins are one thing but saints of God iniquities when you do something you know you shouldn't do and still do it I don't know why he's so merciful but he is and I am so grateful and I say Lord let's just let's just think on this right now let's just borrow close our eyes and just think for we're not going to say prayer right now just think on this just think Lord what more can I do for your kingdom Lord and Lord God if I'm doing all that you've ordained me to do then Lord put place no other burden on
