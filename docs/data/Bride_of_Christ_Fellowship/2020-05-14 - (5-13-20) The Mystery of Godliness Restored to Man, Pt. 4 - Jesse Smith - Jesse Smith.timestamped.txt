[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] I think one time I sang preachings how I
[24:11] fight my battles and I think my wife
[24:13] kind of joke didn't said that only
[24:14] applies to you Jessie you know that's
[24:17] how I didn't sing that verse tonight so
[24:19] write what I meant when I sang it was
[24:21] that preaching God's Word to the church
[24:24] helps us all fight our battles not that
[24:26] everyone's a preacher so I'm sure
[24:28] everybody understood that so thank the
[24:31] Lord let's um take our Bibles here
[24:33] tonight let's go to the first Timothy
[24:36] chapter 3 16 I like to continue on the
[24:39] mystery of godliness restored to man and
[24:42] then we'll read our memory verse from
[24:43] Isaiah 12 first Timothy 3 verse 16 I'll
[25:10] read it myself and then we'll read our
[25:12] memory verse together
[25:18] first Timothy 3:16 and without
[25:21] controversy great is the mystery of
[25:24] godliness so we'd say this is a mystery
[25:27] that's even greater perhaps than others
[25:30] as we saw with Israel's blindness is a
[25:35] mystery and the jew and gentiles
[25:37] composed one church that's a mystery
[25:40] that's known to a lot of churches but
[25:42] this one in particular is called a great
[25:45] history just like the bride mystery and
[25:48] or willing we'll get to that eventually
[25:49] here in the next few months we'll see by
[25:52] the grace the Lord as we're preaching
[25:53] through all the mysteries defined in the
[25:56] Bible without controversy great is the
[26:00] mystery of godliness let's go to isaiah
[26:02] 12 verse 2 isaiah 12 verse 2 to down to
[26:20] 5 by god's grace
[26:28] alright let's read out on three one two
[26:31] three
[26:32] behold god is my salvation i will trust
[26:37] and not be afraid for the lord jehovah
[26:41] is my strength and my son he also has
[26:45] become my salvation therefore with joy
[26:50] shall ye draw water out of the wells of
[26:53] salvation and in that day shall you say
[26:57] praise the lord call upon his name
[27:01] declare his doings among the people make
[27:05] mention that his name is exalted sing
[27:09] unto the Lord for he hath done excellent
[27:12] things this is not in all the earth
[27:15] let's have a word of Prayer if you have
[27:17] a need on your heart let's make it known
[27:18] unto God hear my need is again for my
[27:22] family remember their gene have any
[27:25] father we love you we thank you Lord God
[27:26] for your mercy and grace this is how we
[27:29] fight our battles this is how we drive
[27:31] away temptations and evil spirits and
[27:34] Satan has an imposter lion who roars
[27:38] seeking whom he may devour
[27:40] getting in the holy spirit singing
[27:42] worshiping we know even from David's
[27:44] time drives away evil spirits
[27:45] so in jesus christ's name a this worship
[27:49] and this praise and the sincere love and
[27:51] devotion and the expression of our
[27:53] praise to you may drive away the enemy
[27:56] lord in this home and in there
[27:59] Lord God may your your presence bring
[28:02] fullness of joy Lord God for the joy of
[28:05] the Lord is our strength let us be
[28:06] strong in the faith able to stand
[28:08] against all the wiles of the enemy Lord
[28:11] so we thank you Lord anoint this word
[28:13] we've heard tonight and Lord let us
[28:15] receive it
[28:15] and give you all the praise in Jesus
[28:17] Christ's name Church said Amen god bless
[28:20] you little worm here by God's grace
[28:41] would like to continue on the mystery of
[28:45] godliness restore to man brother Branham
[28:47] our prophet specifically calls this the
[28:52] mystery of godliness being restored to
[28:55] man in sirs is this the end time
[28:59] December 30th 1962 so that's where we
[29:03] get this doctrine from of course it's
[29:06] from the Bible
[29:07] first but then God's prophet preached it
[29:10] and pointed to it and then taught on it
[29:13] eventually with the statue of a perfect
[29:14] man and with all his other teachings and
[29:18] revelations you know the more I meditate
[29:20] and think about this subject the more I
[29:22] realized that it's one of the greatest
[29:24] mysteries because most churches have it
[29:28] all mixed up they don't even understand
[29:31] you know what genuine faith is compared
[29:35] to the gift of faith or the fruit of
[29:37] faith Lord willing we'll get to that
[29:39] tonight and I wonder how many of us
[29:41] understand that I trust that through
[29:43] this preaching you'll be able to
[29:44] understand it because church there's a
[29:46] difference between saving faith
[29:49] intellectual faith the gift of faith and
[29:52] the fruit of faith
[29:53] I trust that all of us will be able to
[29:57] grasp this and you know we know a lot of
[30:00] the principles of it but as far as
[30:02] looking at the scripture and being able
[30:04] to understand and to be able to grasp
[30:08] what the scriptures are saying I trust
[30:11] that the Holy Spirit
[30:12] what was to grow in grace and knowledge
[30:14] of the Lord tonight when a grow go
[30:18] deeper here in this thought real quick
[30:21] it's going to really quick review
[30:24] because it's been a few weeks you know I
[30:25] felt Letta Lord to preach on the
[30:27] different things I trust those thoughts
[30:30] from that last weekend we're blessing
[30:32] about Deborah you know I thought it was
[30:34] beautiful the scripture how it says the
[30:38] time of Judges was the time when
[30:39] everybody did what they want so what did
[30:42] God raise up a mother alright children
[30:45] want to do whatever they want so what
[30:47] has God raised up he raised a mother to
[30:49] get him in line for he's God I thought
[30:52] that's just a beautiful thought it's so
[30:54] true as children you know we're born in
[30:56] this world right we come to the world
[30:57] speaking lies right as the book of Job
[31:00] says and so what God gives you is a
[31:03] godly mother to set you in order so
[31:05] praise God
[31:06] now remember well let's remember
[31:11] godliness is being loyal it's being
[31:14] reverent devoted it's being like God and
[31:17] Jesus said you can attain godliness the
[31:21] confusion is how much effort is required
[31:26] to obtain it and is it attainable and
[31:30] the answer is yes and it's attainable by
[31:33] all your effort and then we showed
[31:36] clearly from the scripture that yours we
[31:40] are all saved by grace through faith
[31:42] that's a total gift
[31:44] no man can boast but then based upon the
[31:48] love that we have if we continue to love
[31:51] God and surrender to God then we grow in
[31:56] love for God and then that love empowers
[31:59] our faith and that faith works so our
[32:03] effort doesn't save us but our effort is
[32:07] our appreciation for what God has done
[32:10] for us and so that must be clearly
[32:12] understood we're saved by grace alone
[32:16] then we saw there's two kinds of
[32:18] godliness there's the first godliness
[32:21] which is before you're born again it's
[32:24] the sixth stage on Peters
[32:26] a burger man or Wilin will be preaching
[32:28] on that of coming soon and then we
[32:33] looked at mature godliness is what which
[32:35] which is what Paul spoke of and really
[32:38] mature godliness is just a very fruitful
[32:40] experienced devoted Christian it's after
[32:43] years of service to the Lord you produce
[32:46] the fruit of we'd say a fruitful
[32:49] Christian life and that's being godly
[32:52] mature godliness Paul wrote about it
[32:56] often
[32:57] ok then Lord willing and after that just
[33:00] going over in the first three parts just
[33:01] to kind of refresh my memory as well and
[33:04] yours too like we said we took a few
[33:06] weeks off then we looked at how each of
[33:14] these attributes of a statue perfect man
[33:16] is a crossroad where we must reject
[33:17] something in our flesh or some
[33:20] temptation from the enemy and accept
[33:23] God's portion of His divine nature
[33:27] because when Peter says were partakers
[33:29] of the divine nature we looked at faith
[33:32] how faith comes it's needed to please
[33:35] God and we saw different examples of
[33:38] when it came like the woman who washed
[33:40] jesus feet
[33:41] Zacchaeus then we saw how Peter had to
[33:46] preach the the bad news first he
[33:48] indicted them on the day of Pentecost
[33:50] then preached the good news that Jesus
[33:51] died for them I'm thankful for that news
[33:54] I'm glad I've received the good news
[33:55] praise God
[33:56] now tonight Lord willing we're going to
[33:59] start by looking at the different kinds
[34:01] of faith and again church this is a
[34:04] picture this in your mind this is the
[34:06] first step of eight steps right on the
[34:09] statutory man and I think we'd all agree
[34:11] that most churches don't even understand
[34:13] the first step as far as the fullness of
[34:16] it they a lot of them believe we're
[34:18] saved of course we're not saved by works
[34:19] we're saved by grace through faith
[34:21] they'll accept that part of faith but
[34:25] then they'll confuse it you know with
[34:26] intellectual faith they'll confuse it
[34:29] with the gift of faith and they'll
[34:31] confuse it with the fruit of faith you
[34:33] know because nominal church is all the
[34:36] time we'll talk we'll talk about aw what
[34:38] such fruits of the spirit and
[34:40] they're not even born again how can you
[34:42] how can you have fruit when you don't
[34:44] even have the seed of God's life and
[34:46] that seeds not been quickened so you see
[34:51] especially the fruit of faith is thrown
[34:54] around all the time people say oh they
[34:56] got real fruits of the Holy Spirit will
[34:58] do they is their seed quickened and have
[35:01] they served God faithfully and with
[35:02] maturity and real loyalty to every word
[35:06] of God becoming more humble and then
[35:09] they're producing this mature fruit of
[35:11] faith after years and years of service
[35:14] so see church I hope it started to open
[35:16] up to you how deep and how how great
[35:19] this revelation is you know the Bible
[35:23] says the Holy Spirit searches the deep
[35:25] things of God so I hope the church can
[35:28] catch that that you know preaching on
[35:30] faith is not a light thing preaching on
[35:34] faith is a very important thing is
[35:36] something we need to grow in something
[35:38] we need to understand is that the gift
[35:41] is that the fruit is it my saving faith
[35:44] I need to get past my intellectual faith
[35:48] so it's a very faith is a very important
[35:52] subject it's a crucial subject and so
[35:55] let's start tonight with justification
[35:58] by faith I just want to reiterate go
[36:01] through some scriptures here because
[36:06] I've known also you know people have
[36:07] made it known to me that you know
[36:08] they're listening now to our services
[36:10] the different places in the country and
[36:12] before around the world and some of them
[36:15] are just fresh to the message and fresh
[36:17] to the Word of God and so and even our
[36:20] children know we have these numerous
[36:22] children in our church and they need to
[36:24] hear them they need to understand it and
[36:25] church is good if you're if you're been
[36:28] the message a while it's good it's so
[36:30] good to examine your foundation right
[36:34] anybody who owns a home you gotta make
[36:36] sure you got a good foundation make sure
[36:38] it's not leaking make sure it's a it's
[36:42] gonna last so it's always good to go
[36:44] back and look at that faith foundation
[36:47] praise God
[36:49] so justification by faith at the moment
[36:53] a person is
[36:54] saved and forgiven they're justified in
[36:57] the sight of God now Paul devotes many
[37:00] chapters and we're not going to spend
[37:02] all the time on that and read all of it
[37:04] but Romans chapters three four and five
[37:07] are devoted to faith and then Galatians
[37:10] chapters two and three are just devoted
[37:13] to faith then you know we see the power
[37:16] of faith in Hebrews 11 now that's kind
[37:18] of a different angle we could take
[37:20] because some of those are the gift of
[37:22] faith by God's grace so the word
[37:28] justification means to show one to be
[37:30] righteous to declare one to be just so
[37:36] this is a judicial term right it would
[37:38] be used in the the Greek language to say
[37:40] someone is just there's nothing there's
[37:43] no wrong against them
[37:46] now Paul this is judicial also because
[37:49] Paul says we shall all stand before the
[37:52] judgment seat of Christ Church every
[37:55] time we hear that it should it should
[37:57] wake us up if we're a little bit sleepy
[37:59] it should stir us up it should
[38:01] strengthen us if we're a little tired it
[38:03] should make us tighten up our belt of
[38:04] truth to remember that everything we've
[38:07] heard we got to give an account for
[38:09] we've got to stand before the judgment
[38:12] seat of Christ and Christ is gonna he's
[38:14] not gonna pull any punches he's not
[38:15] gonna treat us better because you know
[38:17] we're the Laodicean bride he doesn't
[38:20] favor anybody he's impartial he's full
[38:24] of love but he's impartial he's just and
[38:27] so we must all stand before the judgment
[38:30] seat of Christ and we should desperately
[38:32] want Christ to look at us and declare us
[38:35] justified forgiving righteous not
[38:41] unrighteous but righteous just like if
[38:45] you want the judge in a natural court
[38:47] god forbid you have to go to the natural
[38:49] court as we talked about judges on
[38:51] Sunday but you'd want to judge to
[38:54] examine your case and hopefully if
[38:56] you're innocent and really innocent the
[38:59] judge would declare you just you're
[39:02] innocent you're righteous you're not
[39:04] guilty and so we should want
[39:07] same thing here as we stand before the
[39:09] Lord on that great day now I'm just
[39:14] going to briefly go over Romans three it
[39:18] explains how sinful men and women can be
[39:20] righteous it first describes man's
[39:24] hopeless situation in verses 10 to 12
[39:26] there's none righteous no not one
[39:29] think about that that applies to Paul
[39:31] Paul was writing applies the brother
[39:33] branham any well-known preacher you and
[39:37] I there's none righteous no not one
[39:40] they're all together gone out of the way
[39:43] they've all become unprofitable there's
[39:47] nothing to do with good no not one and
[39:49] then in verse 19 to 31 he says where all
[39:53] the world is guilty before God because
[39:55] all men have sinned and fall come short
[39:58] of the glory of God so we are unable to
[40:01] be justified by our human efforts to
[40:04] keep the law will always fail so it's
[40:08] through Christ's blood that there is
[40:11] righteousness of God without the law
[40:13] amen
[40:14] thank God Jesus Christ blood made a way
[40:17] that we could be righteous because we
[40:21] couldn't obey all the lost commands it
[40:24] wasn't in US God is offering this to all
[40:27] the Bible said I love it the
[40:31] righteousness of God is unto all and
[40:33] upon all that believe do you believe
[40:36] tonight if you believe in Jesus Christ
[40:39] his death burial resurrection and what
[40:43] is what his blood means and represents
[40:46] and the Bible said you are justified his
[40:49] righteousness is upon you all hallelujah
[40:55] so by God's own design genuine belief or
[40:58] trust in Christ's sacrifice is required
[41:01] for salvation Paul says it plainly and
[41:06] he said were justified freely by His
[41:09] grace through the redemption that is in
[41:11] Christ it's a free gift praise God he
[41:14] declares us righteous as a free gift
[41:18] nothing you and I can do
[41:20] to earn it it's amazing race because
[41:25] Christ was a propitiation through faith
[41:28] in his blood so see we have to we have
[41:31] to have trust trust in the blood of
[41:34] Jesus Christ
[41:37] and the Bible said the blood is declared
[41:40] his righteousness for the remission of
[41:43] sins that are past through the
[41:46] forbearance of God he said to declare
[41:49] this time his righteousness that he
[41:52] might be just and the justifier of him
[41:56] which believeth in Jesus where is
[41:59] boasting then there's no none of us will
[42:03] be able to boast because it's not our
[42:05] blood that's that's on the mercy seat
[42:08] it's the blood of Jesus Christ his blood
[42:12] is there for us it stands to cover our
[42:15] sins and Paul said if you believe in
[42:18] that you're justified freely that's
[42:21] beautiful praise God
[42:23] no man will boast you won't boast
[42:24] because the law or by your works he's an
[42:27] a but by the law of faith amen
[42:31] what are you gonna be able to say why
[42:33] should God forgive you because I believe
[42:35] in Jesus Christ I put my trust in Jesus
[42:38] Christ blood and when I when I trusted
[42:43] in it then I obeyed what His Spirit said
[42:45] praise God I trusted his blood I trusted
[42:49] his work and then I trusted his word if
[42:52] I trusted his plan for salvation Church
[42:54] can't we trust his plan for our lives as
[42:56] well of course that's the whole point of
[43:00] the blood is that the life would come
[43:02] upon the believer now the just one
[43:07] justifies the unjust he declares the
[43:12] unrighteous righteous no man can brag
[43:16] about his own righteousness because we
[43:19] have none praise God amen only Christ
[43:22] has righteousness so Romans 4:3 says
[43:28] were justified the same way Abraham was
[43:31] and that beautiful we can
[43:34] we can know that we're the friend of God
[43:36] just like Abraham because Abraham was
[43:39] called the friend of God because God
[43:41] forgave him because abraham believed God
[43:44] and it was imputed to him for
[43:46] righteousness he believed God and he
[43:50] just started acting upon it what was the
[43:53] first command that God gave him separate
[43:56] yourself leave your family so what'd he
[43:59] do he obeyed did he know every detail
[44:02] about it no could he tell you where his
[44:05] final destination is I know I can tell
[44:08] you Sarah white where I'll end up could
[44:10] he tell you that
[44:10] no the Bible said he went out not
[44:13] knowing where he went
[44:15] children you don't know we're gonna end
[44:17] up you might end up in Africa you might
[44:19] end up in Montana you might end up in
[44:23] Florida who knows where you'll end up
[44:24] you don't know all the details but you
[44:28] can obey God's Word and if you obey
[44:32] God's Word even in a young life then God
[44:38] sees you just as guilty as Abraham
[44:42] praise God because it's all by the same
[44:45] faith trust in the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:49] it paid for your sins and set your sins
[44:53] away your sins are remitted by trusting
[44:56] in Jesus Christ's sacrifice abraham
[45:01] believed God and it was counted unto him
[45:05] for righteousness God counts your simple
[45:08] humble faith as righteousness
[45:12] Romans the.45 says but to him that
[45:15] worketh not but believeth on him that
[45:17] justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[45:20] counted for righteousness do you believe
[45:22] God justifies the ungodly do you believe
[45:25] God saves the sinner
[45:27] oh yeah because I was one of them praise
[45:28] God and he cleaned up my life and set me
[45:31] on the right path praise God we believe
[45:34] that he he justifies the unjust David a
[45:41] thousand years before Christ foretold
[45:44] this blessedness he discs
[45:48] as the blessedness of the man whom god
[45:51] imputeth righteousness without works
[45:53] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[45:56] are forgiven whose sins are covered
[45:58] molested as the man to whom the Lord
[46:01] will not impute sin amen
[46:04] oh God thank you Jesus we say we're
[46:07] sorry we're trusted he his blood paid
[46:10] for my sins he imputes our sins upon
[46:14] Christ and Christ's righteousness is
[46:16] imputed or given unto us the Bible said
[46:22] Christ was delivered for our offenses
[46:24] but raised for our justification for
[46:27] he's God other he went to the cross with
[46:30] our fences upon him but then he raised
[46:33] with our justification praise God
[46:35] our total substitute our propitiation
[46:39] and then in Romans 5 he says therefore
[46:43] being justified by faith we have peace
[46:45] with God with our Lord Jesus Christ by
[46:49] whom also we have access by faith into
[46:51] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[46:55] in hope of the glory of God so see
[46:58] Church we gotta stand in grace we can't
[47:01] stand in legalism right we can't stand
[47:03] the law likes one day I'm saved next day
[47:06] I'm not we have to stand in grace I'm
[47:08] standing in the grace of God the
[47:10] unmerited favor of God we must have the
[47:13] awareness that because I believe in the
[47:16] blood of Jesus Christ I am in God's
[47:18] grace I can say truly I see God's favor
[47:22] in my life I see it and I want to treat
[47:25] that favor with humility I want to
[47:28] recognize that and be appreciative of
[47:30] that and show more devotion to God and
[47:33] more love to God because I can see that
[47:35] I'm standing in grace I can see that I'm
[47:38] not at war with God but I've got peace
[47:40] with God Paul when he first got saved
[47:43] member he was kicking against the pricks
[47:45] he was warring against God but
[47:47] afterwards he had peace with God amen
[47:49] there our Lord Jesus Christ children you
[47:52] could have that too you can have peace
[47:54] with God we don't have to feel like
[47:56] we're at war with God we want to please
[47:59] him and we have that you know tension
[48:01] and desired
[48:01] constant pleas and but it shouldn't be a
[48:04] war if we've got faith with God or faith
[48:07] in the blood of Jesus Christ we have
[48:08] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[48:10] Christ so the word peace is you're
[48:17] exempt from the rage and a havoc of war
[48:20] you are not in a rate
[48:22] God is not raging in war against you
[48:24] he's not in hatred against you you have
[48:28] peace with God you're exempt from the
[48:30] war from God's wrath you're exempt from
[48:33] that because you believe in his son's
[48:35] death and resurrection praise God the
[48:40] Bible said God looks at us like pitiful
[48:43] children the scripture says that in
[48:46] Psalms 103 13 he pities us that's that
[48:52] we should pity our children when we see
[48:54] him make a mistake and we shouldn't call
[48:56] names and belittle them but we should
[48:58] you know of course correct them but we
[49:00] should have pity on them and know
[49:01] they're just a little fella they're just
[49:03] a little one they're gonna make mistakes
[49:07] we got to be there to encourage them and
[49:09] to help them the best we can because
[49:11] that's how God sees us as a father that
[49:15] pities his children they understand a
[49:17] father understands his little children
[49:19] can't do it so he's got to help him out
[49:21] he's got to be patient he's got to be
[49:23] loving so it is with our Heavenly Father
[49:25] he pities us he's patient with us He
[49:28] loves us we have peace with our Father
[49:31] amen and then the Bible says when you're
[49:36] justified you have no charges before God
[49:39] who shall lay any charge of God's elect
[49:44] because it is God that justified what
[49:48] sin can Satan bring up that the blood of
[49:50] Jesus Christ doesn't cover there is none
[49:53] there's no sin that the blood of Jesus
[49:55] Christ doesn't cover praise God thank
[49:59] God the Bible said Jesus entered into
[50:05] heaven to appear in the presence of God
[50:08] for himself
[50:09] No to appear for you and I children he
[50:14] appears there for
[50:15] us he's there for us there even now is
[50:18] he serving himself is he living for
[50:21] himself no he's there for us
[50:24] praise God he's there for Jean that we
[50:26] can pray for Jean he's there for bangs
[50:29] dad right who is dead he's there for
[50:31] that purpose
[50:32] he's there serving us as a high priest
[50:35] as a mediator as a lawyer he's there in
[50:39] the presence of God for us and he's able
[50:41] to save them to the uttermost that come
[50:44] to God by him seeing he ever liveth to
[50:48] make intercession for them amen that's
[50:51] why he's living that's why he's there
[50:53] for us to give us life to to forgive our
[50:58] accounts to clear our sinful accounts
[51:00] and to wipe them clean to wash them
[51:03] white as snow and to put his
[51:05] righteousness upon us that we'll have
[51:07] peace and not war with God the trouble
[51:11] is we war with that black dog right
[51:12] that's the trouble that's the real war
[51:14] we got right and then the thoughts that
[51:18] Satan injects into our minds you know we
[51:20] we battle those we have war against
[51:22] those but if we're truly justified we do
[51:24] not have war with God we have peace with
[51:28] God through the Lord Jesus Christ now
[51:32] let's look a little bit at Galatians 2
[51:34] chapters 2 and 3 Paul again addresses
[51:39] justification by face saying no flesh
[51:41] can be justified by the law in the sight
[51:44] of God justification by faith is for Jew
[51:48] and Gentile being foretold for the
[51:51] Gentiles in Genesis 12:3 this is such a
[51:58] beautiful scripture let's read Genesis 2
[52:00] 3 or 12 3 I will bless them that bless
[52:05] thee and curse and the curse thee and in
[52:07] thee shall all the families of the earth
[52:10] be blessed
[52:11] did you catch that did anybody hear the
[52:13] word justification in that scripture no
[52:16] it just bless bless bless bless yet Paul
[52:20] uses that scripture to say that God
[52:23] foretold that I'm going to justify the
[52:26] Gentiles so we can
[52:29] understand then that God sees
[52:31] justification as a blessing right
[52:34] because he didn't say the word you don't
[52:36] say the j-word
[52:36] you didn't even say the r-word
[52:38] righteousness he just says bless him
[52:40] through Abraham I'm gonna bless
[52:42] everybody and so God's blessings is his
[52:45] forgiveness and then of course the
[52:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes
[52:49] later
[52:52] Habakkuk 600 years before Christ said
[52:58] that the just shall live by his faith
[53:02] his substance we must live by the
[53:06] substance of God's Spirit the trust of
[53:10] God's Spirit the the God sphere brings
[53:13] us trust right we must live by that and
[53:17] trust that we're not at war with God but
[53:19] we have peace with God
[53:21] and that's where you see a lot of people
[53:23] get discouraged in their walk with God
[53:25] because they don't live by faith we've
[53:27] got to live by faith the revelation or
[53:30] the trust that we have that we're at
[53:32] peace with God and God's trying to help
[53:34] us he's trying to pick us up right he's
[53:37] trying to he pities us he's trying to
[53:40] put a blanket on our sleeping daughter
[53:41] right don't get mad at the daughter
[53:44] falls asleep we have pity on her right
[53:48] the child falls down to you you stole
[53:51] them no you pick them up right John
[53:54] makes a mistake you try to correct it
[53:56] and try to help them out trying to show
[53:58] pity on them
[54:00] it's so beautiful God hid justification
[54:04] in the word blessing all the earth will
[54:07] be blessed all the earth can be
[54:08] justified by faith in Jesus Christ of
[54:12] course we know not many will see this
[54:18] law though of Moses served as a
[54:20] schoolmaster or tutor to bring us to
[54:24] Christ that we might be justified by
[54:27] faith so the laws works works works
[54:29] works works condemned condemned
[54:30] condemned condemned condemned but faith
[54:32] is grace grace grace grace grace amen
[54:35] love love love love love favor favor
[54:38] favor favor even though you don't
[54:39] deserve it
[54:39] you're studying together they're gonna
[54:41] get it so a favor favor favor
[54:44] so that law that constant condemnation
[54:47] taught was to point us to Christ where
[54:49] we don't have to feel condemned all the
[54:51] time we should feel the thirst of God in
[54:55] our soul member David said my soul
[54:57] thirsts we should understand a thirst
[54:59] and not condemnation we're thirsty for
[55:02] more of God and we don't want to lose
[55:04] out on any opportunity to do God's will
[55:07] we want to constantly be doing what
[55:10] God's called us to do but not under
[55:12] condemnation but under justification
[55:15] praise God that were righteous that were
[55:17] we're God's children that were we have
[55:19] God's favor we're at peace with God
[55:25] we're justified by faith now the last
[55:33] section of this is what brother Branham
[55:35] preached one works is faith expressed
[55:38] some say the book of James brings
[55:43] confusion to the faith versus works
[55:47] debate because James 2:24 says a man is
[55:52] justified I'm sorry you see how that by
[55:55] works a man is justified and not by
[55:58] faith alone so just looking at that
[56:01] scripture it could be confusing so some
[56:06] argue that faith alone is not enough to
[56:08] save a sinner because James writes a man
[56:12] is justified by works and not by faith
[56:14] alone but if you read James 2 in context
[56:18] he's rebuking dead faith so faith that's
[56:22] not alive right meaning a faith
[56:26] confession intellectual human faith that
[56:30] has no action behind it no love - it
[56:32] doesn't have any life to it so empty
[56:36] words without action is really an
[56:38] absence of faith it's not real genuine
[56:40] faith and the exam
[56:45] James Gibbs is a Christian who who sees
[56:47] another Christian whose cold and hungry
[56:49] and says I hope you get food and hope
[56:51] you get warm but doesn't do anything to
[56:53] help him out he said but a real faith
[56:57] filled Christian will give food and
[57:00] clothing to that starving cold Christian
[57:05] so as brother Graham taught us James and
[57:09] Paul perfectly agree right they have to
[57:13] agree because real faith does work the
[57:16] Bible says faith works by love so when
[57:21] you have that right definition that's
[57:23] why I believe that was such a revelation
[57:24] the Lord gave me a couple years ago
[57:26] faith worketh by love the first thing
[57:29] gotta have is love you know love the
[57:32] goodness of God the goodness of God
[57:34] leads you to repentance you love what
[57:36] Jesus did you love how he took your
[57:37] place you love how he shed his blood
[57:40] although it breaks your heart
[57:42] but you because you love you believe and
[57:45] then because you believe you act you
[57:48] obey you work for the kingdom of God
[57:53] so it's important to again point that
[57:56] out that basically James is saying it's
[58:01] through works a man is justified in
[58:05] other words he means it's through love
[58:07] that causes faith to work and not just
[58:11] be a human confession of human
[58:14] intellectual faith praise God everybody
[58:19] catching that by God's grace all right
[58:23] beautiful
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:26] all right now I want to move into I want
[58:29] to maybe I get to a couple more parts
[58:30] here I'm gonna do okay
[58:31] let me go about half hour more I wanna
[58:33] look at intellectual human faith briefly
[58:40] so every human being possesses
[58:45] intellectual human faith now this is
[58:49] different from God's saving faith or the
[58:53] divine faith we'd say it's different
[58:55] than the gift of faith
[58:59] God's saving faith as part of the divine
[59:02] nature right so it's a further anointing
[59:05] of the Holy Spirit the faith is the
[59:07] first anointing of the Holy Spirit as
[59:08] you get more and more of God's divine
[59:10] nature and this is the same faith Jesus
[59:15] Christ possesses it's Christ's faith
[59:20] that is added to the Christian as a gift
[59:24] just as Peter said each character
[59:27] quality must be added to the believer
[59:30] add to your faith virtue so you must be
[59:34] added right must be imparted or given
[59:39] remember Paul said he lived by Christ's
[59:42] supernatural faith so see Church even a
[59:45] foolish virgin all anyone who saved is
[59:49] living by the faith of Jesus Christ
[59:52] because it's Christ's spirit it's that
[59:54] initial anointing when you're saved
[59:56] you'll get justified and you live by
[59:58] genuine faith Galatians 2:20 Paul says
[1:00:03] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:00:06] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[1:00:10] and the life which I now live in the
[1:00:13] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:00:15] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:00:18] that ought to make you feel pretty good
[1:00:19] you got baptized you're serving God all
[1:00:22] these years you're living not by your
[1:00:24] faith by Christ's faith amen hallelujah
[1:00:27] thank you Jesus
[1:00:28] his own faith said Paul recognize that
[1:00:35] it's his faith living in me it's what
[1:00:38] I've received not my faith it's his
[1:00:40] faith because with his human faith right
[1:00:44] he persecuted Christians he drugged them
[1:00:46] to jail but with Christ faith he himself
[1:00:50] was jailed for preaching the gospel so
[1:00:55] human faith is just the ability to
[1:00:58] acknowledge truth it's not saving faith
[1:01:02] it's just intellectual human faith to
[1:01:06] just acknowledge that's the truth and
[1:01:08] that's proven in Hebrews 10 CH 1
[1:01:11] six and 27 now listen this is a really
[1:01:14] good scripture for if we sin willfully
[1:01:17] after we received the knowledge of the
[1:01:20] truth there remaineth no more sacrifice
[1:01:23] for sins but a fearful looking for of
[1:01:28] judgment and fiery indignation which
[1:01:30] shall devour the adversaries so see it's
[1:01:33] plainly stated in Hebrews intellectual
[1:01:36] human faith is just acknowledging the
[1:01:38] truth just saying oh ah that's right I
[1:01:41] believe that anybody can do that because
[1:01:45] that's given to everybody but if you do
[1:01:49] despite that or if you do contrary to
[1:01:51] what you know the truth is then that is
[1:01:53] unbelief and that's worthy of hell
[1:01:55] because you're not living for the truth
[1:01:58] I'm so glad we can live for the truth
[1:02:00] jesus said thy Word is truth
[1:02:02] this word is 100% truth praise God
[1:02:06] we live for that so intellectual human
[1:02:10] faith just says well that's the truth
[1:02:12] but it doesn't accept it it doesn't love
[1:02:15] it it doesn't act upon it with faith
[1:02:17] working remember when Nicodemus came to
[1:02:22] Jesus in John 3 he admitted that all the
[1:02:25] the Sanhedrin Council had human faith
[1:02:28] right he said rabbi we know you're a
[1:02:32] teacher come from God because no man can
[1:02:34] do those miracles except God be with him
[1:02:36] see they all had intellectual faith they
[1:02:38] knew that this man this young rabbi was
[1:02:42] different because he did things that had
[1:02:44] never been done before open the eyes of
[1:02:46] the blind and so forth and church even
[1:02:50] Muslims you know this even Muslims say
[1:02:52] Jesus is a prophet even they can
[1:02:55] acknowledge the truth but they say
[1:02:58] Muhammad is the last and greatest
[1:03:00] prophet but they say Jesus is a prophet
[1:03:04] they recognize that a lot of them know
[1:03:07] some New Testament Scriptures well where
[1:03:09] do they fail they fail on the blood
[1:03:11] that's right they don't accept the blood
[1:03:14] so then they don't accept real spiritual
[1:03:17] divine faith see they don't have that
[1:03:19] trust in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:21] they're actually hoping that Allah Allah
[1:03:24] will save them
[1:03:25] after they die and the only guarantee
[1:03:28] they haves if they're a martyr which is
[1:03:30] a selfish way to die for them to you
[1:03:32] know kill blow themselves up with a bomb
[1:03:34] or real crash a plane that's the that's
[1:03:39] in their religion that's the only
[1:03:40] guarantee they have of eternal life but
[1:03:43] thank God we have the guarantee of
[1:03:45] eternal life now we have peace with God
[1:03:47] we're justified by faith God remits all
[1:03:51] of our sins through the blood of Jesus
[1:03:53] Christ amen
[1:03:56] so see human faith acknowledging truth
[1:03:59] is not enough for salvation it requires
[1:04:03] repentance from sin because if you love
[1:04:06] God's righteousness you'll hate the
[1:04:08] Antichrist spirit if you love the Spirit
[1:04:10] of God you'll hate the Antichrist spear
[1:04:14] so repentance from sin automatically
[1:04:17] comes when you genuinely have real faith
[1:04:20] in Jesus Christ blood and then there's
[1:04:31] this thought just so we can see clearly
[1:04:34] the men and the Pharisee sanhedrin of
[1:04:37] Jesus day they had human faith right
[1:04:40] intellectual human faith and then church
[1:04:43] even angels have intellectual faith the
[1:04:47] member James 2:19 now believe us that
[1:04:50] there's one God thou doest well the
[1:04:52] Devils also believe in tremble see
[1:04:56] angels fallen angels now demons have the
[1:04:59] intellectual capacity to believe in
[1:05:01] Christ and can even sense his holy
[1:05:04] presence and tremble at it but yet they
[1:05:07] disobeyed Christ or we'd say they
[1:05:10] disobeyed a Michaels command in heaven
[1:05:13] I don't believe Michael was Christ
[1:05:15] Michael Michael may have been a pre
[1:05:17] figure of Christ but I don't believe
[1:05:19] personally Michael was Christ and I
[1:05:22] preached on that before but and then in
[1:05:26] Luke 434 an unclean devil was crying out
[1:05:31] to Jesus he said I know thee who thou
[1:05:33] art the Holy One of God
[1:05:37] so see they both
[1:05:39] they have intellectual faith and we'd
[1:05:41] save in Supernatural because they're
[1:05:43] supernatural beings right but Jude 1:6
[1:05:48] says the angels which kept not their
[1:05:49] first estate but left their own
[1:05:52] habitation he hath reserved in
[1:05:54] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[1:05:56] the judgment of the great day so see
[1:06:01] many of them are already reserved
[1:06:03] they're awaiting judgment yet they have
[1:06:06] intellectual faith yet they tremble the
[1:06:08] presence of God you see it's so
[1:06:12] important and this is what separates our
[1:06:15] message from denominations and non
[1:06:19] denominations that believe just regular
[1:06:22] false Christian doctrine we can see how
[1:06:26] there's a human faith but that's not
[1:06:28] sufficient for salvation there has to be
[1:06:31] a repentance and a reception of God's
[1:06:34] Spirit a smaller portion of God's Spirit
[1:06:37] which is faith its Christ's own faith
[1:06:40] and then you get virtue and all these
[1:06:45] other attributes of the Holy Spirit - -
[1:06:48] you get capped off and seal with the
[1:06:51] Holy Spirit that's what separates us
[1:06:55] that we can distinguish the numerous
[1:06:57] types of faith and that's not the pat
[1:07:01] ourselves on the back it's just to say
[1:07:03] we are one of those in Revelation 10
[1:07:07] that have heard the prophecy again the
[1:07:09] open books been taken and it's been
[1:07:11] preaching this book prophesied all
[1:07:13] around the world we're just blessed to
[1:07:15] be able to have her to praise God and
[1:07:16] receive it and eating it and becoming
[1:07:20] that word okay so I got a few more
[1:07:25] minutes here let me check my timer here
[1:07:26] okay about 20 more minutes let's try to
[1:07:29] get the the gift of faith turning you
[1:07:31] got your Bibles here I'll have some
[1:07:33] readers here I kind of wanted to go
[1:07:35] through those other subjects a little
[1:07:36] quicker I want to spend a little more
[1:07:38] time well the next 20 minutes on the
[1:07:41] gift of faith Lord willing children how
[1:07:45] remember how many how many gifts of the
[1:07:48] Spirit are there
[1:07:50] I'm very good now I guess in the Holy
[1:07:52] Spirit praise God there's nine gifts of
[1:07:56] the Holy Spirit there's wisdom and well
[1:08:01] and this is the order wisdom so brother
[1:08:02] man tells us wisdom is the most
[1:08:04] important gift of all wisdom knowledge
[1:08:07] faith healing miracles prophecy
[1:08:11] discerning of spirits diverse kinds of
[1:08:13] tongues and interpretations and tongues
[1:08:18] okay so now we're showing a different
[1:08:20] kind of faith this is not saving faith
[1:08:24] this is a gift of faith all right and of
[1:08:29] course this is listed in 1st Corinthians
[1:08:31] 12:1 - 11 here's what the word gift
[1:08:35] means in the Greek it's favored
[1:08:40] with which one receives without any
[1:08:43] merit of his own it's grace or gifts
[1:08:46] denoting extraordinary powers
[1:08:49] distinguishing certain Christians and
[1:08:51] 1/8 and abling them to serve the Church
[1:08:54] of Christ Wow
[1:08:56] so saving faith is different
[1:08:59] that's Christ's own faith to believe and
[1:09:03] trust in God and trust in the blood of
[1:09:06] Jesus Christ but the gift of faith is a
[1:09:09] special ability you have that gives you
[1:09:15] an extraordinary power and you have it
[1:09:17] so you can serve others alright okay so
[1:09:29] let's have a Lydia mark 11:23 maokai
[1:09:36] first corinthians 13 - now I will try to
[1:09:42] be try to be able to define the gift of
[1:09:46] faith in maybe more biblical words that
[1:09:50] were familiar with like I said a
[1:09:52] supernatural ability but through these
[1:09:55] scriptures I want to give it a
[1:09:56] definition that you and I can start to
[1:09:59] understand so Lydia mark 11:23
[1:10:04] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:10:06] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:10:09] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:10:10] and show that down his heart but shall
[1:10:13] believe that those things when she says
[1:10:14] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:10:16] whatsoever he says amen and then Acacia
[1:10:21] listen Milka Milka first Corinthians 13
[1:10:23] - so I'm going to commit and though I
[1:10:26] have the gift of prophecy prophecy and I
[1:10:28] understand all mysteries and all
[1:10:30] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[1:10:32] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:10:33] not charity I am nothing okay so based
[1:10:36] upon these scriptures I hope you caught
[1:10:38] the key word was mountain right faith
[1:10:41] are the words of faith and mountain were
[1:10:44] the key words rather the gift of faith I
[1:10:47] think a good Bible definition is power
[1:10:49] to remove obstacles figuratively
[1:10:54] described as mountains by speaking God's
[1:10:57] word at his leading okay so I think
[1:11:04] that's a little bit better you know we
[1:11:06] just talked about the gift of faith if
[1:11:08] we define it it's a lot easier
[1:11:10] oh it's mountain-moving ability right I
[1:11:12] think it's a good way to say don't you
[1:11:14] if there's an obstacle in your way and
[1:11:16] and God God gives you the supernatural
[1:11:19] ability to speak to that mountain and
[1:11:21] watch it move now I gave that testimony
[1:11:23] that's what we did church with Lee bang
[1:11:28] and who is dad I was on the phone with
[1:11:30] brother amen and I just remember looking
[1:11:31] out towards the west now if I was
[1:11:34] looking east I said I speak against that
[1:11:36] mount in the name of Jesus Christ and I
[1:11:40] didn't remember exactly what I say Amen
[1:11:42] might remember better I didn't know if I
[1:11:44] said come out of the hospital or just
[1:11:46] get well or get his full strength back
[1:11:48] when I just spoke to the mountain of a
[1:11:50] heart trouble and commanded it to move
[1:11:54] and by God's grace weathervane says it's
[1:11:57] a miracle so bang was telling me on
[1:11:59] Sunday after church too that the doctors
[1:12:01] at one point had told him that they have
[1:12:05] the option of unplugging the breathing
[1:12:07] machine so basically saying they could
[1:12:10] let his dad die but we kept believing we
[1:12:13] kept speaking God's Word there's life in
[1:12:15] the in the power of the tongue praise
[1:12:17] God when God
[1:12:18] leads us to do it and so now man can
[1:12:20] rejoice and who can rejoice in what van
[1:12:23] calls a miracle so thank God for that
[1:12:28] okay so defining the gift of faith is
[1:12:32] now this supernatural ability to get
[1:12:34] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:36] and that is leading speak God's Word and
[1:12:39] then obstacles are removed mountains are
[1:12:43] taken out of the way now two examples
[1:12:46] are really clear Asia can you get X 14
[1:12:49] eight I'm gonna start with the first
[1:12:52] example application read the second the
[1:12:54] first example is the Roman centurion in
[1:12:56] Matthew chapter 8 1 to 13 and what a
[1:12:59] beautiful example he the Centurion comes
[1:13:03] to Christ for healing of a sick servant
[1:13:05] he was suffering from paralysis at least
[1:13:07] according to the Greek Jesus agreed he
[1:13:11] said I'll come to your house heal the
[1:13:13] servant but the Centurion said he only
[1:13:15] needed to speak the word only for the
[1:13:19] servant to be healed
[1:13:20] Jesus marvel that is great faith and
[1:13:24] said as thou hast believed so be it done
[1:13:28] unto thee the Centurions great faith in
[1:13:32] Christ spoken from his anointed heart to
[1:13:35] Christ cause the Savior to speak the
[1:13:39] word moving the mountain of paralysis in
[1:13:41] the self-same our praise God okay that's
[1:13:46] one clear example right of
[1:13:47] mountain-moving faith Jesus and speak it
[1:13:50] and then the Syrians that you speak it
[1:13:52] I've got faith in your word that's what
[1:13:56] we should say I've got faith in God's
[1:13:58] Word amen
[1:14:00] that's one clear example so can anybody
[1:14:02] see that turn as you get older and
[1:14:04] you're under the anointing of the Holy
[1:14:06] Spirit
[1:14:06] you may do that you just speak to a
[1:14:09] problem and it'll move the problem will
[1:14:12] remove I've seen like we said we've seen
[1:14:15] that numerous cases with the two women
[1:14:16] that couldn't have babies Tom Atkinson
[1:14:18] and now bangs father just speaking the
[1:14:22] word and obstacles move mountains move
[1:14:28] that's God
[1:14:29] power behind his word amen so acacia
[1:14:34] can you read Acts fourteen eight let's
[1:14:37] look at Paul he was in Lystra which is
[1:14:40] modern-day Turkey and he operates a gift
[1:14:43] of faith I never walked through the next
[1:14:56] scripture the same heart Paul speak who
[1:14:59] steadfastly beholding him and perceiving
[1:15:03] that he had faith to be healed that
[1:15:06] scripture said with a loud voice stand
[1:15:10] up right on my feet and he leaped and
[1:15:13] walked amen
[1:15:15] how could Paul tell a man who's never
[1:15:18] walked before to get up and walk how
[1:15:20] could he do that he had to have super
[1:15:23] powers right well he did he had a gift
[1:15:26] that's what Hollywood is busy trying to
[1:15:29] impersonate with Avengers and spider-man
[1:15:31] and Batman and Superman they're just
[1:15:33] trying to impersonate the gifts of the
[1:15:35] Holy Spirit
[1:15:36] and they're doing an awful job of it
[1:15:38] because they give Satan all the glory
[1:15:41] but Paul had that power Paul stood stand
[1:15:45] up in the name of Jesus Christ and he
[1:15:48] leaped up and walked oh it's glorious
[1:15:50] hallelujah so Paul's gift of faith
[1:15:55] operated on a crippled man who never
[1:15:57] walked impotent his feet see it was
[1:16:02] through mountain-moving faith that
[1:16:06] allowed the man's obstacle his crippled
[1:16:09] NISS to move all because paul spoke the
[1:16:14] word and the gift of faith operated
[1:16:17] praise God like I said Church we start
[1:16:22] seeing the dead in Christ rise we're
[1:16:24] gonna be able to speak God's Word we're
[1:16:26] gonna have such faith it all things are
[1:16:29] possible to them that believe will be
[1:16:31] under such an anointing we're thankful
[1:16:34] we can get under that anointing a little
[1:16:36] bit of that anointing today thank God
[1:16:40] but also gonna take
[1:16:42] is more of God's Spirit praise God the
[1:16:46] time and season of the rapture okay so a
[1:16:51] little more on this so the gift of faith
[1:16:53] is different from saving faith because
[1:16:57] the gift is always in a person's life
[1:17:00] even before they're saved and that's
[1:17:02] where our children that's why what my
[1:17:04] children know you've got a gift laying
[1:17:06] in your life and it can operate even
[1:17:08] before you're saved because gifts the
[1:17:16] Bible said the gifts and callings of God
[1:17:18] are without repentance so God places the
[1:17:24] gift or the supernatural ability in your
[1:17:28] human spirit right you can't go in to
[1:17:33] your soul because if you're lost and God
[1:17:36] curses in himself
[1:17:37] it's gotta go in your human spirit won't
[1:17:40] go in your body it's you don't have any
[1:17:43] ability in your body it's ask me a
[1:17:45] spiritual power it has to be in your
[1:17:47] human spirit so even before a person is
[1:17:53] saved they already have a gift whether
[1:17:55] it's faith or wisdom or speaking in
[1:17:57] tongues or interpretation and prophecy
[1:18:00] one of those nine gifts is laying in
[1:18:02] every person's life because the Bible
[1:18:04] said the manifestation of the Spirit is
[1:18:06] given to every man not some to every man
[1:18:10] to profit withal as first grampians 12 7
[1:18:14] and all these worketh that one in the
[1:18:17] self same spirit dividing to every man
[1:18:19] severally as he will so we can't we
[1:18:24] can't bargain with God for the gift we
[1:18:26] want we just got to understand and
[1:18:28] observe and get under the anointing of
[1:18:31] the Holy Spirit and see what God does
[1:18:33] through us
[1:18:41] now many times search gets don't operate
[1:18:42] because the people don't pray long
[1:18:44] enough that's scriptural remember Jude
[1:18:46] said praying in the Holy Ghost building
[1:18:49] up your most holy faith if someone in
[1:18:53] our church doesn't know their gifts may
[1:18:55] God help you to pray more because as you
[1:18:58] pray that the Holy Spirit anoints you
[1:19:03] more and then God can use you then
[1:19:05] you'll see the gift of God whether it's
[1:19:08] speaking of obstacles and mountains move
[1:19:11] whether it's laying hands on the sick
[1:19:14] recovery or dreaming and prophesying
[1:19:17] foretelling things to come but it's
[1:19:21] through prayer in the Holy Spirit that
[1:19:24] God builds up your faith praise God and
[1:19:27] builds up the anointing on on your life
[1:19:30] that then God can use you now some
[1:19:37] states have our Saints rather have
[1:19:39] multiple gifts like Paul remember we
[1:19:41] showed he had all the five preaching
[1:19:43] gifts three of them are clearly proven
[1:19:46] by Scripture meaning and by history had
[1:19:48] to have the other ones but Paul Paul
[1:19:51] prophesied of the rapture he had a gift
[1:19:57] of healing spoken tongues and had the
[1:20:00] gift of faith because he spoke that word
[1:20:01] right there to the crippled man it's
[1:20:03] right there just four out of the nine
[1:20:07] imagine we can look back at that list
[1:20:09] and no doubt he had discernment right he
[1:20:15] could judge between the spirits no doubt
[1:20:18] about that
[1:20:19] miracles healing knowledge oh if anybody
[1:20:23] had knowledge or than a word of
[1:20:25] understanding hadn't been Paul praise
[1:20:28] God's all right so hopefully church by
[1:20:35] God's grace that get
[1:20:40] after the holy spirit lays in your human
[1:20:42] spirit so your body lays sin right thus
[1:20:45] in nature that's Romans 7:18 2:23 Paul
[1:20:49] said sin is in my members so your body
[1:20:52] is sin your human mind gets a gift and
[1:20:57] it's supernatural ability or your soul
[1:21:01] gets the Holy Ghost see oh praise God
[1:21:04] it's the life of Christ Christ in you
[1:21:07] the hope of glory so the the complete
[1:21:09] anointing of the Holy Spirit you're in
[1:21:11] your nature you get a new nature praise
[1:21:14] God see each part has something in it
[1:21:19] sin sin gift seal his nature
[1:21:26] and then this nature guides all the
[1:21:29] other ones so that so let me say this
[1:21:33] the nature of your words to each other
[1:21:35] is seen I'm sorry how you what you speak
[1:21:39] and how you treat each other we can see
[1:21:41] what nature's in you praise God because
[1:21:46] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:21:48] mouth speaketh okay that's why it's so
[1:21:52] important to have the Holy Ghost you
[1:21:54] have God's divine nature all right so I
[1:21:58] got eight minutes here let me finish
[1:22:00] with this thought here gifts are given
[1:22:04] to every person Romans 11:29 the gifts
[1:22:07] and callings of God are without
[1:22:08] repentance Church think about that you
[1:22:13] have a built-in component you have a
[1:22:16] built-in superpower you do you have a
[1:22:22] built-in superpower but you gotta learn
[1:22:26] to use it
[1:22:27] fairies guys gotta learn to operate it
[1:22:31] that's what I think happened with with I
[1:22:33] see that in my life I stay under that
[1:22:35] anointing stander the word keep that
[1:22:38] meditate on that word and God can use me
[1:22:40] to speak that speak God's word learning
[1:22:45] trying to learn how to stay under that
[1:22:47] channel another way to say it is like a
[1:22:51] tail it's like God giving you that money
[1:22:53] right
[1:22:53] because the TL is like Jesus described
[1:22:56] he gave everybody everybody got tail in
[1:22:58] the parable Matthew 25:14 2:30 everybody
[1:23:02] got a talent these were very valuable
[1:23:05] talents we looked at that a couple times
[1:23:08] just like faith is so valuable and Jesus
[1:23:12] Christ is the one that gives it to us he
[1:23:16] gives us something very valuable very
[1:23:20] valuable it's a superpower that you have
[1:23:22] and God will use it as your yielded to
[1:23:26] him this just kind of came to my mind
[1:23:30] member God
[1:23:32] Balaam knew God would meet with him if
[1:23:34] he just made those sacrifices
[1:23:36] and children I should encourage us God
[1:23:39] will meet with you if you just make the
[1:23:40] right sacrifices study pray repent
[1:23:46] humble yourself be kind of another all
[1:23:50] throughout the day think about God's
[1:23:52] Spirit think about God moving think
[1:23:54] about God used me too is there anybody
[1:23:56] sick is there anybody hurting like I
[1:24:00] thought it was a good testimony one of
[1:24:02] my daughters woke up or no one of my
[1:24:03] daughter's couldn't fall asleep and was
[1:24:07] really discouraged she was like shaking
[1:24:09] in the night and then one of my other
[1:24:11] daughters kind of woke up and just the
[1:24:14] testimony was just went over calmly
[1:24:16] prayed and then the daughter that was
[1:24:19] shaken just felt the victory fell all
[1:24:23] that nervousness leave and they went
[1:24:24] right to bed by God's grace oh that's a
[1:24:27] good testimony it's a good testimony
[1:24:30] just just being uh the Bible said be
[1:24:32] instant in season out of season speed oh
[1:24:35] it's just constantly humble how can I
[1:24:37] help how can I be a blessing how can I
[1:24:39] do something for the kingdom of God now
[1:24:44] let me close with this there are six in
[1:24:46] the book Lord willing if it comes out
[1:24:50] there are six examples of how people can
[1:24:54] have divine gifts and still be lost
[1:24:56] because gifts are given to you before
[1:24:59] before you even repent their give
[1:25:01] they're putting your human spirit we're
[1:25:03] gonna get you have a superpower
[1:25:05] the first is bail
[1:25:07] the Bible said he went to the mist of
[1:25:10] Darkness forever
[1:25:11] Balaam did so think about that that's
[1:25:14] what hell's like that's what that
[1:25:15] prison-house it's like a misty darkness
[1:25:19] yet he prophesied a star would come out
[1:25:22] of Jacob that the wise men followed yet
[1:25:25] he prophesied of that yet he went into a
[1:25:27] trance many times it could see God
[1:25:30] showing him things he he could see the
[1:25:34] God he couldn't curse in Israel because
[1:25:35] Israel is blessed so that's one Balaam
[1:25:43] I'm looking - a second judas iscariot he
[1:25:48] did miracles like all the other eleven
[1:25:50] but he went to his own place the 70
[1:25:54] disciples that were sent out memory sent
[1:25:56] his twelve out two by two then he said I
[1:25:58] was seventy more they came back they
[1:26:00] rejoiced but Luke 10 1 - 20 and then
[1:26:03] Mark 9 and john 6:66 suggest that they
[1:26:08] all left because his preaching was too
[1:26:10] hard if they left Christ they left
[1:26:14] salvation they left the word they could
[1:26:17] have been lost so that was the next one
[1:26:22] fourth is Matthew seven where many will
[1:26:26] say Lord Lord have we not prophesied
[1:26:28] cast out devils these are workers of
[1:26:30] iniquity in fact all these are workers
[1:26:32] of nicholae it said depart from me you
[1:26:34] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[1:26:37] depart from me never knew you said you
[1:26:40] did not do the will of God
[1:26:42] a fifth example is Hebrews 6:1 - 12 a
[1:26:46] group taste of the heavenly gifts and
[1:26:50] powers but yet are still lost that's
[1:26:54] because after experience than the power
[1:26:56] of God they get slothful and fall away
[1:26:59] they're unwilling to repent they crucify
[1:27:02] Christ put him to an open shame which is
[1:27:05] public disgrace with their sinful lives
[1:27:08] and they crucify Christ afresh
[1:27:17] again uses I'm sorry the Hebrews writer
[1:27:19] uses botany life again to compare them
[1:27:24] to thorns just as Jesus called this
[1:27:26] workers of iniquity tears which are
[1:27:28] poisonous now he caused him thorns the
[1:27:31] Hebrews writer calls and thorns in
[1:27:33] Hebrews chapter 6 absence either I see
[1:27:41] how they're absent of the fruits of the
[1:27:42] Holy Spirit's thorns never had any good
[1:27:45] fruit to begin with so they didn't have
[1:27:47] the fruit of faith you know when they
[1:27:49] cast on the devil that wasn't the fruit
[1:27:51] of faith that was a gift of faith yet
[1:27:55] many churches are confused at all what
[1:27:57] great fruits we see from their
[1:27:59] ministries their healing the sick and
[1:28:01] guess that's not a fruit that's a gift
[1:28:06] and lastly sixth in 1st Corinthians
[1:28:10] thirteen one two three it specifically
[1:28:12] mentions the gift of faith though I
[1:28:14] could have all faith that move mountains
[1:28:16] have not charity I'm nothing so see you
[1:28:19] learn faith is a supernatural powerful
[1:28:21] gift sorry about it day always fights my
[1:28:25] father got silenced it moves obstacles
[1:28:31] but exercising the gift without God's
[1:28:34] love is spiritual bankruptcy so even
[1:28:41] though you can operate the gift without
[1:28:43] faith in your soul you're nothing anyway
[1:28:47] so see this proves church and children
[1:28:51] love is the only true and acceptable
[1:28:54] motivation for trying to do God a
[1:28:57] service because love empowers faith and
[1:29:01] then faith does the works of God whether
[1:29:03] they're supernatural or just works of
[1:29:06] obedience praise God
[1:29:09] god bless you we'll stop right there
[1:29:10] next time Lord willing we'll look at the
[1:29:12] fruit of faith which is the rarest kind
[1:29:16] so let's ask our musician here my son
[1:29:25] real quick I'm going to silence this lab
[1:29:30] real quick praise God what a wonderful
[1:29:52] word of God to hear tonight are you
[1:29:56] justified by faith as Jesus Christ

[1:30:03] that choice tonight we shouldn't be at
[1:30:07] war with God we should have peace with
[1:30:10] God through our Lord Jesus Christ we all
[1:30:16] have intellectual faith let's make sure
[1:30:17] our faith is the saving faith the faith
[1:30:21] of the Son of God Jesus Christ let's
[1:30:27] build up our faith right through prayer
[1:30:30] interceding with God if the gift of
[1:30:33] faith can operate in our church in our
[1:30:35] lives to know these things to know that
[1:30:43] less than are your eyes for they see

[1:31:15] new Bible

[1:31:36] others to see preserve my life my
[1:31:41] strength that I can do thy will follow I

[1:31:52] Christ leave their sins behind we
[1:31:56] justified be declared righteous and live
[1:32:00] by Jesus's own faith after trusting in
[1:32:05] Jesus's death burial resurrection may
[1:32:08] they live by his faith begin to grow in
[1:32:12] grace how much of you you haven't
[1:32:17] repented I pray you will repent

[1:32:23] want a new heart a new life you're sorry
[1:32:26] for every sin you've ever done and you
