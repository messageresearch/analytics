[31:54] blood that we come into your presence
[31:56] right now now by our works or our by our

[32:01] and mercy through your sacrifice of
[32:03] yourself sending your son to die for us
[32:06] thank you for that bloody lamb that's in
[32:09] heaven lower now that appears in the
[32:11] presence of God for us Lord seeing that

[32:16] our prayers and our needs tonight
[32:18] teach us thy word Lord is so important
[32:20] for us in this hour in Jesus Christ's
[32:22] name the church said Amen god bless you
[32:25] be in see them praise the Lord just that
[32:27] I murders I don't go to long and look
[32:31] forward to this messy
[32:32] Chuck I said I'll I was ready to preach
[32:34] this on Sunday night I was already
[32:35] really excited to preach it by this side
[32:38] save it so cuz I forgot we didn't take
[32:40] Haven through the bible scriptures we
[32:41] just talked about it a lot and prayed
[32:43] about it a lot so and then i talked to
[32:45] someone a saint afterwards i said i hope
[32:46] it wasn't too bad to go over this
[32:48] message and they're like no you can
[32:50] never outgrow the scriptures you can
[32:52] never get too mature to hear a word on
[32:54] water baptism i thought well that's your
[32:57] heart what a good statement i said
[32:58] that's one of the sweetest things I've
[33:00] heard amen in a while so thank God for
[33:02] that but or Malachi can you switch you
[33:05] over please sir let's do some some
[33:07] quotes here tonight by God's grace and
[33:10] also I got a this is kind of encouraging
[33:12] I got a text from somebody looks like I
[33:15] don't know if it's America or not but
[33:17] they heard me preach on doing some
[33:19] missionary work door-to-door and they
[33:20] want to send us an offering so we'll see
[33:22] if that that comes through so I was
[33:24] praying about that actually this week
[33:25] before I got this email because we've
[33:28] been trying it we helped out Simon and
[33:29] Simon got another ticket to go to
[33:30] Thailand they changed the plans he's
[33:32] going in October so our church
[33:34] supporting him to go to Thailand this
[33:35] time so we're very thankful but I felt
[33:37] led to do that rather than do the
[33:38] door-to-door but if we get this in here
[33:41] my thought was I was praying just this
[33:42] week and I said Lord if we can get more
[33:44] missionary funds on a Sunday night at 4
[33:47] p.m. I like to do those Bible mystery
[33:49] sermons and invite people to come on a
[33:51] Sunday night because we're already here
[33:52] and that's where I kind of how I'm
[33:54] feeling LED right now but if this
[33:56] testimony does come through and they
[33:58] want to support that they think that'd
[33:59] be wonderful so I'm looking forward to
[34:01] see what God does and because I've had
[34:03] this desire for many months and I'm
[34:06] looking to see if this is the will of
[34:07] the Lord here so I just thought it was
[34:09] great I was praying about missionary
[34:10] work here in Akron and then I got this
[34:12] email so hopefully it hopefully it's God
[34:14] working on both ends I'd like to see
[34:15] that okay so we read our text I we just
[34:18] read verse 2 sorry I thought we read
[34:20] verse 3 but we did it now I just want to
[34:22] remind us God thought so much of the
[34:24] church ages series that he sent the
[34:27] pillar of fire for a visitation remember
[34:29] that is that three hours and five
[34:31] minutes in the sermon revelation chapter
[34:35] 4 part 3
[34:38] remember we listened to this brother
[34:40] Graham said look this away now you
[34:41] that's just like it when it comes under
[34:44] glory here see it slide
[34:46] over here you're moving here look it's
[34:48] just a reflection just a reflection it's
[34:50] not the light here's the light hanging
[34:51] right here see here at this woman I just
[34:54] happened to catch it I thought it was
[34:55] over somebody now you're seeing one but
[34:57] I'm seeing two brother madam said one of
[34:59] them is natural the other one is
[35:00] supernatural
[35:01] so the pillar of fire was over a woman
[35:04] at this point but later he said the part
[35:06] that wasn't on tape was when the pillar
[35:07] of fire was on the wall I don't remember
[35:08] which wall it was maybe the back wall
[35:10] don't remember but the pillar of fire
[35:12] actually made the light of each of those
[35:14] moons or circles right and then it went
[35:17] hung over a sister he said but you're
[35:19] seeing the natural light of that
[35:20] supernatural light which is quite as
[35:23] quite a thing to think about the
[35:25] supernatural pillar fire made a natural
[35:28] light so I just want you to remember
[35:30] that and then a week after he preached
[35:32] this nine days later he preached this is
[35:35] that we've had a revival to Tabernacle I
[35:37] had a series of subjects I was telling
[35:39] you the seven churches my congregation
[35:41] was 400 or 350 says while I speak in I
[35:45] called the prayer line there should kind
[35:48] of glory he said I'm gonna skip down
[35:50] there and as I speak in the angel Lord
[35:52] came right down before them all went
[35:54] right over and stood in the corner there
[35:55] 300 or more people looked at it for 15
[35:58] minutes screaming crying and praising
[35:59] and they caught the end of it on that
[36:01] tape that we listened to the first time
[36:04] had ever come like that before our
[36:05] church just come right in everybody
[36:07] begins screaming and fallen as a big
[36:09] amber light the pillar fire just as
[36:10] perfectly and it began to shade itself
[36:13] and shade it every one of those church
[36:14] ages just exactly the way I taught them
[36:16] in that pillar of fire and God knows
[36:19] that's the truth here before this Bible
[36:21] so the pillar of fire did a light that
[36:25] looked almost like a full circle right
[36:26] and then it got and that changed shape
[36:28] and made all those shapes until may
[36:30] Laodicea so we don't want to forget the
[36:33] importance of these services especially
[36:36] the teaching on these because that's
[36:37] what God would have us to know about the
[36:40] book of Revelation so it's so crucial
[36:42] and I want to bring this one too from
[36:44] the seven seals he said we ought to live
[36:46] above shorthair and all this and this
[36:49] age now where we're back into something
[36:50] now that God's revealing the hidden
[36:52] mysteries that have been put on the book
[36:53] before the foundation of world and those
[36:55] who have obeyed in these small things
[36:57] will catch it in these other things
[37:00] if you have it it'll go over the top of
[37:02] your head just as far as the East is
[37:04] from the west see if we can't do this
[37:06] small little things I like the little
[37:07] sanctification things the Prophet said
[37:09] you'll miss it on the big things the
[37:11] rapture the revelation the mysteries of
[37:13] God we got obey every word of God right
[37:15] like getting he said and then he said
[37:18] this is a different message we're
[37:19] talking about the little things
[37:21] Oh the very least little thing we do our
[37:23] King sees the littlest thing we do and
[37:26] he knows the very things and thoughts
[37:28] that's in our hearts whatever we do what
[37:29] little is and how do we serve Him as we
[37:32] serve each other if I don't love you how
[37:35] can I love him see in so much have you
[37:37] done it unto one at least of these
[37:38] you've done unto me see it's the little
[37:40] things that we have undone sometimes I
[37:42] just want to bring that out is we got to
[37:44] remember the little things about serving
[37:47] God all the little details he says
[37:49] sometimes it breaks the whole chain you
[37:50] see and lets us go free just the
[37:52] nomination of minded forget about these
[37:54] little things that are really the
[37:55] essential things every word of God is
[37:57] essential none of it can be let out
[37:59] we've got to take every word of it just
[38:01] the way it was wrote Amen just want to
[38:03] encourage us with that remember and
[38:05] these little things that might seem
[38:06] little to us you know maybe water
[38:08] baptism or any little thing like he gave
[38:11] an example of cutting hair and then in
[38:12] other words he gave above that he gave
[38:14] an example of smoking and little worldly
[38:16] things if we can't get rid of these
[38:18] little things we're gonna miss the big
[38:19] things so we need to keep all the Word
[38:22] of God amen
[38:22] now just a quick review I promise I'm
[38:24] gonna go fast through here just a quick
[38:26] review the Sardis Church age was the
[38:28] Reformation age and they had they had
[38:33] their own name so in other words they
[38:34] were taking many of them took
[38:36] denominational names okay so the light
[38:39] is very thin but it was bigger than the
[38:41] previous Thyatira church age and we're
[38:44] dealing with 15 22 17 AD
[38:46] so that time period here and Martin
[38:49] Luther was the church age messenger I'll
[38:51] skip to that skip past this we're going
[38:53] to go real quick so we're speaking on
[38:55] this age right here and the battle for
[38:57] their age is living a name but they're
[38:59] dead that's the battle and they're
[39:01] battling the black horse rider remember
[39:04] he had this bounces in his hand and he
[39:06] was capturing the wealth of the world so
[39:08] this is when the Catholic Church had
[39:10] state power and they controlled all the
[39:14] the necessities like food and barley
[39:16] right and water and everything like that
[39:17] they control everything but the
[39:19] temptation the age was they were living
[39:21] a denomination name but were dead the
[39:24] city of Sardis remember the fifth City
[39:27] sorry the fifth City there and in
[39:30] modern-day Turkey and member the
[39:32] highlight to this part of the city was
[39:34] the goddess their goddess Inn was Seibel
[39:37] and Sai Bo was the same false god that
[39:41] the the priests of Jezebel worshiped
[39:44] which was pretty striking remember that
[39:46] from the city of Sardis that was a
[39:48] striking part of that city Sardis the
[39:51] very goddess they worship the mother Sun
[39:53] goddess was the same mother Sun goddess
[39:54] that Jezebel's priests worship where
[39:57] it's really striking and this is the age
[39:59] okay the age of Sardis again Martin
[40:01] Luther was born before the Age started
[40:03] but then lived in the beginning of it
[40:04] that was his life and then there's John
[40:06] Wesley's life and there's brother
[40:07] branham's life Martin Luther was the
[40:12] best known messenger of all ages and it
[40:14] was written of him that he had all nine
[40:16] gifts of the Holy Spirit amen what a man
[40:18] of God and truly if the Lutheran's live
[40:22] what Martin Luther preached brother
[40:23] Branham said they'd be a credit and
[40:26] praise to the kingdom of God as foolish
[40:28] virgins if they just lived the
[40:31] justification facts that he preached
[40:32] they'd be a great credit to the kingdom
[40:34] of God huh me know the foolish virgins a
[40:36] good credit to the kingdom of God they
[40:37] are they are therefore known before the
[40:40] foundation world and they do get some
[40:42] people saved through the foolish virgin
[40:43] now here's the new stuff here's let's
[40:45] get into this now I told you that be
[40:46] sure it's the salutation we're finishing
[40:49] verse one these things saith he they
[40:52] have the seven spirits of God in the
[40:53] seven stars now visually in heaven the
[40:57] seven spirits appear as lamps before the
[40:59] throne of God so before God's throne or
[41:02] gods seat there's seven lamps or seven
[41:04] fires and those are actually the seven
[41:07] spirits of God because that's what the
[41:09] scripture says in Revelation four or
[41:10] five the seven lamps of fire burning
[41:12] before the throne which are the seven
[41:14] spirits of God now the Prophet teaches
[41:18] this what are these seven lamps were
[41:20] these seven spirits the Prophet says we
[41:22] know that these are not teaching a new
[41:24] doctrine a that's contrary to
[41:27] John 4:24 God is one spear he said it's
[41:31] not teaching contra that but this is
[41:33] like first Corinthians 12 8 through 11
[41:35] where do we find one Spirit manifesting
[41:38] in nine ways thus we know that the seven
[41:41] spirits of God meaning is the one in
[41:43] South Asia spirit coming forth in a
[41:45] Sevenfold way and that beautiful God's
[41:48] pillar of fire comes down as one pillar
[41:50] fire to earth right like we said I saw
[41:52] Jeffersonville but in heaven God's one
[41:56] spirit has seven fire burning
[41:57] manifestations because it represents how
[42:00] God is going to work through the current
[42:01] or the past seven Church ages amen
[42:05] because God has completed and I'm sorry
[42:07] perfected I'm sorry I completed in seven
[42:09] he's completed in seven forgive me now
[42:11] revelation four and five these same
[42:13] spirits are called lamps of fire burning
[42:15] before the Lord since John always used
[42:18] nothing but Old Testament symbols in
[42:20] Revelation we go to the Old Testament in
[42:22] proverbs 20 verse 27 said the spirit of
[42:24] the man is the lamp of the Lord so now
[42:27] we go a step further not only are there
[42:28] seven lamps but now these lamps
[42:30] represent spirits of men these seven
[42:34] spirits are found to be associated with
[42:36] man John the Baptist was called a
[42:38] burning light which would also could be
[42:40] translated as a burning lamp again in
[42:43] Revelation 5:6 the seven spirits are
[42:44] identified as seven eyes so now we're
[42:46] given another symbol for the same symbol
[42:49] for the same idea seven spirits could be
[42:51] seven spirits of men and also seven sets
[42:54] of eyes or seven eyes Zechariah 4:10
[42:57] says for who hath despised the day of
[42:59] small things for they shall rejoice and
[43:01] shall see the plummet the hand of zerubu
[43:02] with those seven they are the eyes of
[43:06] the Lord the promise that is evident
[43:08] that the word they refers to men thus we
[43:11] see the eyes of the Lord in this
[43:12] instance are men of course they will be
[43:14] anointed men for the Holy Ghost for
[43:17] God's ministries are in the power are
[43:20] not in the power of men but in the power
[43:21] of the Holy Ghost amen
[43:23] so that's of those seven lamps represent
[43:25] who represent the Holy Spirit in each
[43:28] church messenger for all seven Church
[43:30] ages so brother said putting our
[43:32] scriptural discoveries together it is
[43:34] evident that the seven spirits of God
[43:36] refer to the continuous ministry of the
[43:38] same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven
[43:41] men with whom God identifies himself
[43:43] very closely amen
[43:46] they are his eyes and they are his lamps
[43:48] those I'm sorry who these seven men are
[43:51] can be easily seen because the next
[43:54] phrase calls them seven stars which are
[43:56] already known to us as the seven
[43:58] messengers to the church okay so seven
[44:00] spirits represent the Holy Spirit
[44:03] anointed lives of seven men amen pretty
[44:06] familiar but I didn't know if you'd been
[44:07] familiar on that lately so we see that
[44:10] the seven spirits actually refer to the
[44:11] one Spirit of God working out the will
[44:14] and word of God in different ages I
[44:16] would like to illustrate that from the
[44:18] word so whether I'm gives us another
[44:20] illustration for this you have the nine
[44:22] gifts of the Spirit and then also
[44:24] another revelation is the five comings
[44:27] of Elijah it's the same thing it's five
[44:30] manifestations of the one spirit right
[44:32] of Allah hi John but this the seven
[44:35] lamps are seven manifestations of the
[44:38] one spirit of God also Jesus and the New
[44:41] Testament church brother Branham says is
[44:42] a type of this the same spear that was
[44:45] on Jesus
[44:46] now comes upon the church same spirit
[44:48] but now it's manifesting in different
[44:50] lives amen the lives of the Apostles and
[44:53] now our lives amen so I'll skip that
[44:56] because it talks about that the holy
[44:57] spirit that was in Jesus came down the
[44:59] day of Pentecost that's kind of familiar
[45:00] I'll skip that but I want to get to this
[45:02] any people that's truly the body of
[45:05] Christ Jesus the true church will
[45:06] manifest the same works as Jesus did and
[45:09] the Pentecostal church because the same
[45:11] spirit will be in them any other church
[45:14] that does not have the spirit and the
[45:16] manifestations is going to have to give
[45:18] an account to who God that's why there's
[45:22] times that I've I felt led and I hope
[45:24] you'll remember it understands this
[45:26] I felt led sometimes to preach hard that
[45:28] we need to see manifestation the church
[45:30] now it might be understood by some but
[45:33] anybody who really studies deep in the
[45:35] word knows that if a church doesn't have
[45:37] the Holy Ghost in power they're gonna
[45:39] answer to God for that so that's why I
[45:41] know it's not me being rough on the
[45:44] church or something like that it's me
[45:47] being anointed by the Holy Spirit saying
[45:49] if you know if we don't have this we're
[45:51] not the true Church of God in other
[45:53] words we can't be a powerless Church
[45:54] we've
[45:55] to be a powerful Church because God
[45:57] hates powerless religion I know I know
[46:01] before I've been a misunderstood times
[46:02] like that where I've tried this press
[46:04] like we need gifts or we need God's
[46:06] power I know I've been understood and I
[46:07] feel bad about that but when I study
[46:10] this and it comes down to it it's the
[46:12] Spirit of God saying God hates powerless
[46:14] religion like brother Samson was here
[46:17] and he preached the power of God God
[46:19] hates a powerless religion and if a
[46:21] church says they're the message church
[46:23] or a true Church of the hour and doesn't
[46:25] have it they're gonna answer to God as
[46:28] what they had a false claim they said oh
[46:31] we and where are they gonna answer for
[46:33] that at the white throne judgment though
[46:35] they'll not live in the millennium right
[46:37] they'll not sit on the throne with
[46:39] Christ and no answer for at the white
[46:40] throne judgment Church it's a burden
[46:42] it's a necessary burden that we have the
[46:44] signs wonders and miracles Amen we're
[46:47] glad to see them from time to time
[46:48] hallelujah that's exactly right
[46:50] in the message if you listen to
[46:52] desperation that listen that recently I
[46:54] think a few weeks ago brother Branham
[46:57] said there's times that we need to be
[46:59] desperate for miracles well Adam said if
[47:01] we see miracles working on other people
[47:03] he said we should get desperate to see
[47:05] them in our lives because what does it
[47:08] mean if we're desperate for God that
[47:09] means we're less interested in the world
[47:11] and we're not we're not sliding away
[47:13] from God or backsliding but we're drawn
[47:15] closer to him that's all that means it's
[47:18] not a works based salvation but it's
[47:19] just getting away from our worldly
[47:21] tendencies and drawn closer to God it's
[47:23] so misunderstood though especially you
[47:25] know like I said sometimes it's
[47:26] understood when I preach it or other
[47:28] brothers might emphasize the power of
[47:30] God we're not trying to say put on try
[47:32] to do it work but it's get serious with
[47:34] God and flex your faith muscles they men
[47:37] put your faith to work like we saw on
[47:39] Sunday
[47:40] wake up Jesus out of the boat wake that
[47:41] faith up in your life amen
[47:43] speak the word pray for the sick fast
[47:45] and pray do something try to get the
[47:47] supernatural anointing that's all it's
[47:49] saying is if we don't have it we're
[47:51] gonna we're gonna wind up at the foolish
[47:53] version right at the white throne
[47:54] judgment but we want to sit on the
[47:56] throne so see that's why we preach it
[47:58] the way we do it is that help by God's
[48:00] grace I hope that's understood it's
[48:01] never meant to try to press too hard on
[48:04] supernatural but if people don't have it
[48:07] in their lives they gotta answer for God
[48:09] because the Bible said these follow all
[48:10] these signs follow all believers they
[48:13] should follow all believers now he lays
[48:17] it in there and the next page I skipped
[48:20] one paragraph he gets back these spirit
[48:22] is not seven spirits but one he will
[48:24] always be the same and act the same and
[48:26] the seven messengers will have the same
[48:28] spirit and teach the same word and have
[48:30] the same power and if the church is the
[48:33] true church it will have the very same
[48:34] spirit and word and acts of power that
[48:36] they had at Pentecost by experience it
[48:39] will be a Pentecostal church there will
[48:41] be tongue aren't you glad we had tongues
[48:43] back in February although we didn't get
[48:45] the interpretation we had tongues and
[48:47] didn't that edify you identified me Amen
[48:51] see the true church has to have that he
[48:53] says it will also have interpretation we
[48:57] had that years ago we had it a few years
[48:58] ago prophecy and healings now haven't
[49:01] had a little bit of prophecy there with
[49:03] the interpretation of years ago when
[49:04] Stephen Kressel was here and healings
[49:06] God will be in the midst of her and God
[49:08] will declare himself in the midst of her
[49:10] as he always has hallelujah and she will
[49:12] be unorganized don't forget that the
[49:16] seven spirit-filled
[49:17] messengers are the lord's they may be
[49:20] repudiated repudiated I'm sorry
[49:23] now this quote was supposed to encourage
[49:25] you so listen here you're like this they
[49:28] may be questioned indeed to human minds
[49:30] they may not even seem to qualify
[49:32] nevertheless there are the messengers to
[49:35] their age God used Abraham and he lied
[49:37] on numerous occasions even lying about
[49:40] his wife he used the Moses who rebelled
[49:45] and ran away from God for forty years
[49:47] he used the Jonah he disobeyed and left
[49:51] the presence of God just like Cain left
[49:54] the presence of God right but see he was
[49:55] a true child of God so God brought him
[49:57] back we know people that might leave the
[50:00] presence of god let's pray God brings
[50:01] them back they're Jonah amen they get
[50:03] back because my man said it's not a bad
[50:05] thing to be a Jonah he said we always
[50:07] you know make falling away Jonah's
[50:09] falling away a bad thing he said but he
[50:10] said it all worked out to God's plan for
[50:12] his life that's right
[50:15] listen to a man running for the presence
[50:16] of Lord 1963 he said he used a Samson he
[50:20] said he said sexually and he send all
[50:22] kinds over different
[50:23] David David murdered he sin sexually he
[50:27] also used a Joshua a Joseph and those
[50:30] with severe blemishes far outnumber
[50:31] those whose history seemed to be perfect
[50:35] goodness gracious
[50:36] all were and are his glory none dare
[50:42] deny that he used them by and through
[50:44] the Holy Spirit that he put within them
[50:46] to their own master they stood or fell
[50:48] and in them all was accomplished the
[50:51] sovereign will of God amen how many what
[50:54] God's will to be accomplished in their
[50:55] life think about this how many of us
[50:57] have gone through some some of us have
[50:59] never done these things praise God but
[51:01] let's just keep seeking God so the
[51:03] sovereign will of God can be
[51:04] accomplished amen that we can be true
[51:06] servants of God I'm thankful that we got
[51:10] the Holy Ghost Church this proves we got
[51:12] the Holy Ghost because men great men
[51:13] like this the great things were the
[51:15] anointing but when the anointing left
[51:16] they did evil things they murdered they
[51:19] slept around and all these evil things
[51:20] but see how the Holy Ghost is more
[51:22] powerful in this day it keeps us from
[51:24] doing those things because the Holy
[51:26] Ghost doesn't leave us it stays as a
[51:28] seal in our soul amen we're no greater
[51:31] than them but we have access to a
[51:32] greater power amen
[51:34] I'm so about the daily life amen we
[51:37] don't have to run for the presence of
[51:38] God or we don't have to do some of the
[51:40] things we have to murder like Moses
[51:41] we're not the murder like these why
[51:43] because we got God's sealed into our
[51:44] soul amen and he's at the center of our
[51:47] control tower hallelujah and he won't
[51:50] send us in some murdering way he won't
[51:51] send us in adultery you know why because
[51:53] we're sealing the soul romance that
[51:57] external history attempt to refute this
[51:59] it still stands the eternal God still
[52:01] walks amongst the golden lampstands and
[52:03] sends his messengers by his spirit with
[52:06] the word to the people of every age a
[52:08] man what a great closing that was to
[52:10] chapter two verse one or that part now
[52:13] let's go over Jesus says denunciation
[52:16] his correction on the the church here's
[52:20] the denied here's how he's rebuked in
[52:22] the Sardis charge
[52:22] I know thy works now has a name that
[52:25] thou livest and art dead and then he
[52:27] says for I have not found thy works
[52:29] perfect before God now look at this
[52:32] thought see this is a pretty good
[52:33] thought here
[52:36] here indeed is a very strange thing in
[52:38] every age to this point the spirit has
[52:40] first of all praise the true believers I
[52:43] want you to see how this is a and if you
[52:46] can see this you can mean we can be more
[52:48] and more thankful for God's grace if we
[52:50] can understand this point right here
[52:52] this will make us thankful as we leave
[52:53] those doors and a little bit here okay
[52:56] first and all the other ages that would
[52:58] always praise the believers but now this
[53:00] is a pure there's evidently such wanton
[53:03] I'm sorry husband went wanton I'm saying
[53:08] the wonton soup but it's rant and wanton
[53:12] I get it mixed up pulpit or pulpit which
[53:16] one I'm just I'm just ignorant sometimes
[53:21] do forgive me 110 said it wanton wanton
[53:28] there you go so this age is so wanton
[53:31] they have a wanton disregard for the
[53:34] Lord and his word that the entire
[53:36] message to the fifth age rings with
[53:38] condemnation in other words God has so
[53:40] very few believers in here he can't even
[53:42] say nothing positive about the age now
[53:44] he did have believers in there but so
[53:46] very few and church if you know that's
[53:50] the same thing for later to see you God
[53:52] doesn't complement this age with one
[53:54] thing so let's not pat ourselves on the
[53:56] back now we can be thankful for God's
[53:58] grace but overall as a age you know
[54:00] we're not doing so I mean that's an evil
[54:01] age we're not doing some great thing now
[54:04] God's doing a great work in our life but
[54:06] we as a church our small number and
[54:09] we're just fighting for our lives amen
[54:11] we're overcoming don't get row we're
[54:13] overcoming but the age itself is not a
[54:15] great overcoming age of lots of people
[54:17] it's very small so hope you can
[54:20] understand that so what we're saying is
[54:22] Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira God
[54:27] Jesus started all his letters off with
[54:29] compliments I know your works and your
[54:31] faith and all these things member that I
[54:33] know your face you hate them that are
[54:34] evil remember those we preach all those
[54:36] but now in the fifth age Jesus doesn't
[54:38] say anything good about him remember I'm
[54:41] thinking you said something good about
[54:42] Philadelphia but he says nothing good
[54:43] about our church H because it's the very
[54:46] small church age with very small
[54:47] believers not many that are
[54:50] really truly on fire as a whole now
[54:53] Jesus says I know your works in the
[54:55] Sardis Church age remember 15 20 to 1750
[54:59] that's the period we're looking at what
[55:01] were these works that came up before the
[55:03] Lord and caused his displeasure well you
[55:05] know that each church age lapped over to
[55:07] the next age so we have a continuation
[55:09] of the works of the fourth age into the
[55:12] fifth these works are I'm sorry as you
[55:15] are well aware of were these following
[55:19] okay I'm sorry these works as you are
[55:21] well aware of were there we go so here's
[55:25] the sins that we're lapping over into
[55:27] the Sardis age from the Thyer tear and
[55:29] age that's what it's saying
[55:30] number one the leadership of the Holy
[55:32] Spirit was superseded by human hierarchy
[55:35] okay so then take the Holy Ghost
[55:37] leadership they took man's leadership
[55:38] number two the pure Word of God and it's
[55:41] free benefit to all men was disposed for
[55:43] Creed's dogmas church orders etc number
[55:47] three the worship in the spirit and
[55:48] gifts of the Spirit and all that which
[55:50] pertains to true conform I'm sorry
[55:52] community fellowship of the Saints was
[55:54] cast aside for liturgy and literal idol
[55:58] worship pagan feasts etc and the last
[56:01] one is Mary ala tree was assuming a
[56:05] greater place in the Christian worship
[56:06] okay so well aren't you glad were free
[56:09] from those church aren't you glad were
[56:10] free for them
[56:11] we have no Creed here and anything I
[56:14] preach is outside the word you're
[56:15] welcome to bring it to me but most
[56:17] churches have creeds and dogmas like a
[56:19] book outside of the Bible but our Bible
[56:21] is the book a man this is the Creed book
[56:23] amen that's the only book we got and
[56:25] then the worship we need more we want to
[56:28] see more of that but we're thankful for
[56:29] what we do see and of course we condemn
[56:31] any Mary worship and we're led by the
[56:34] holy spirit in other words the church
[56:35] votes it's not me telling you what to
[56:37] vote for it's the church that rules this
[56:40] you cannot vote me out any time you want
[56:41] bang you vote us all out in any of the
[56:43] minute officers this is the church that
[56:46] you it's your church led by the Holy
[56:49] Spirit you understand it's not men
[56:50] ruling over you it's you choosing your
[56:52] leaders that's exactly right now next
[56:55] paragraph now toward the end of the
[56:57] fourth age which would be the beginning
[56:58] of the fifth age also the invasion of
[57:02] constant opal by the Turks
[57:04] set the learned scholars of the east
[57:05] with their Greek manuscripts to the west
[57:08] all right the purity of the word and the
[57:11] teaching of the true believer were thus
[57:13] disseminated or vanished and not only
[57:17] were these fine teachers of great
[57:19] importance but also the invention of
[57:21] what became the basis of our modern
[57:23] production of books thus we find the
[57:26] great hunger and demand for the Bible
[57:29] could be answered so here's the good
[57:31] part about our age or about the sardis
[57:33] age there's a pretty awful age overall
[57:36] but the good part was there was
[57:37] persecution that led these scholars to
[57:40] move west and then they they discovered
[57:43] and built a printing press and now they
[57:46] could print Bible teaching from Martin
[57:48] Luther John Calvin all these wonderful
[57:50] men and produce it and spread the word
[57:53] they could spread more of the truth
[57:54] before the Catholic Church controlled
[57:56] everything but now in this age there is
[57:58] some good works they're spreading the
[58:00] gospel amen through we say gospel tracts
[58:02] that's why they had God raised up many
[58:06] mighty men of which Luther was just one
[58:08] of them Calvin swingley and two other
[58:11] luminaries besides there were many many
[58:15] more who are not so well known however
[58:17] though all this was not in vain the
[58:19] mighty works of God was actually
[58:20] hindered by these very men so the men
[58:22] were started out as good but then they
[58:23] did some moves that hindered the church
[58:26] for one thing they did not oppose the
[58:28] church state marriage of the niceic
[58:30] Council but actually foster that union
[58:33] so while they had some truth they still
[58:35] lean toward Creed's right from the
[58:37] counsels and so forth look at this in
[58:40] spite of Luther's constant teaching
[58:42] against outside interference and local
[58:45] church matters he was not able to clear
[58:47] men's minds of the bishop Archbishop
[58:49] concept of church government so even
[58:52] Martin Luther the church age messenger
[58:54] couldn't get rid of this human
[58:55] government thus the church took one step
[58:59] in the right direction but still remain
[59:01] shackled so in short order she was again
[59:05] in prison in the same dungeon whence she
[59:07] had attempted to escape now I put a note
[59:10] here we can see the blessings the
[59:13] justification doctrine and the printing
[59:15] presses you say men those are good
[59:17] blessings
[59:18] this church age they had justification
[59:20] they knew were saved by grace through
[59:22] faith we're not saved by works without
[59:23] save through indulgences or penances or
[59:26] paying off the Pope or anything like
[59:27] that we're not saved by that we're saved
[59:29] by grace and we can spread the true Word
[59:32] of God all that we know amen
[59:35] but now brother Aaron said now he gets
[59:36] to the Dunstan denunciation the bad part
[59:39] that was the good part
[59:40] now is the bad part if there ever was a
[59:44] time of denominational zeal it was at
[59:47] this tragic time so here's the church
[59:50] age again remember they're living a name
[59:52] but they're dead that's the that's the
[59:55] awful part so I just brought that up one
[59:58] more time to show you this this was the
[1:00:00] awful part they started off good Martin
[1:00:02] Luther started off good but then we're
[1:00:04] gonna read here in the second generation
[1:00:06] after Martin Luther they denominated and
[1:00:08] made the Lutheran Church right so
[1:00:10] brother man said they're like a shackle
[1:00:16] all they got was one step forward but at
[1:00:19] least they got a step forward praise God
[1:00:22] because remember Martin Luther had the
[1:00:24] Holy Ghost anointing on him praise God
[1:00:26] he's a true man of God he made a few
[1:00:29] mistakes right but he's a true man of
[1:00:30] God now the greatest age of disease the
[1:00:35] Prophet says now I just said that this
[1:00:37] era gave tremendous growth to
[1:00:39] denominational spirit if the Corinthian
[1:00:41] attitude was I am appalled I am of
[1:00:43] Cephas was ever exhibited it was now
[1:00:45] there were Lutheran's Hussites wigglies
[1:00:48] party etc such fragmentation of the body
[1:00:51] were deplorable was deplorable they were
[1:00:53] living a name but they were dead
[1:00:55] certainly they were dead they died the
[1:00:57] minute they organized the great groups
[1:00:59] organized and tied themselves in
[1:01:00] matrimony to the state they did it I'm
[1:01:04] sorry that did it they were finished
[1:01:05] here were those Lutheran's who had
[1:01:08] criticized the Roman Church they knew
[1:01:13] the unrighteousness of political and
[1:01:15] spiritual unions yet Luther as when
[1:01:18] Peter was over bounced by the Judaizers
[1:01:20] and the Galatians to member that went
[1:01:23] right ahead and made the same and of God
[1:01:26] and defender of the faith okay so Martin
[1:01:29] Luther didn't preach against the church
[1:01:31] and state you
[1:01:31] so he should have this is the first
[1:01:34] denomination of repute that came out of
[1:01:36] the harlot but when Luther died it was
[1:01:38] not long until it had a hierarchy like
[1:01:40] the one it had fought this move of God
[1:01:43] by the time the second generation came
[1:01:45] along was right back under the wing of
[1:01:47] her mother amen
[1:01:49] she had gone back and did not even know
[1:01:53] it they had taken on their own name
[1:01:55] above his name they were living their
[1:01:56] own name - so which generation started
[1:02:00] denomination the second generation
[1:02:02] it wasn't Luther's generation it was the
[1:02:04] one after him praise God
[1:02:07] so the same thing must be true today
[1:02:08] brother Branham never started generation
[1:02:10] right it would have been the generation
[1:02:13] after which like I said now we're the
[1:02:14] third generation after it because we're
[1:02:16] about the age of brother Josef's
[1:02:18] children right we're about Hitler the
[1:02:21] age of his children
[1:02:22] cuz he's in his 60s he's the same age as
[1:02:23] brother Brooks 61 I'm not mistaken 60 or
[1:02:27] 61
[1:02:29] so it's let me say like this I don't
[1:02:31] know any churches that have denominated
[1:02:33] but the way for a message Church to
[1:02:35] nominate is to just believe brother
[1:02:37] Branham was a prophet and not really get
[1:02:39] the Holy Ghost yourself but just believe
[1:02:41] he was a prophet right and boolean and
[1:02:44] you can and they could celebrate brother
[1:02:46] branham's miracles but had no Americas
[1:02:47] of their own see they'd be living off of
[1:02:50] brother branham's experience instead of
[1:02:52] knowing God for themselves does that
[1:02:53] make sense
[1:02:54] hope that makes sense that's a
[1:02:56] second-generation person that would
[1:02:57] start their own message denomination
[1:02:59] they would not know God the same way
[1:03:02] that brother Branham knew God but see
[1:03:04] we've got an over RAM we got no brother
[1:03:06] it was God the same way he knew him amen
[1:03:08] and trust that's why we got to come to
[1:03:10] church praying and expecting and
[1:03:11] believing right having expectation
[1:03:13] before God that's why we should hunger
[1:03:15] for God amen because we're not living on
[1:03:17] brother brands reputation we want to
[1:03:19] live on the reputation of God amen
[1:03:22] God's reputation amen we appreciate by
[1:03:24] the Rams testimony but we've got to have
[1:03:26] our own amen but see we can't let
[1:03:29] ourselves to nominate we've got to stay
[1:03:31] on fire Amen by the Holy Spirit and
[1:03:34] brother Branham said all the
[1:03:35] denominations are doing that very thing
[1:03:37] today they're living their own name and
[1:03:39] not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] that has easily seen for every church is
[1:03:43] known by the way it worships
[1:03:45] but none are known by the power of God
[1:03:47] there is your test now how about that
[1:03:50] statement you know I told you this
[1:03:53] before but my cousin and different ones
[1:03:54] they go to churches that are known for
[1:03:56] their rock and roll that's what they're
[1:03:57] known for
[1:03:58] or maybe this famous preacher or
[1:04:01] something like that
[1:04:02] now church that's the test of a true
[1:04:05] church
[1:04:05] what is the church known for is it
[1:04:08] Creed's is it rock and roll is that for
[1:04:10] doing soup suppers
[1:04:11] what's it what are they known for we
[1:04:13] should be a church that's known for the
[1:04:15] power of God whether people recognize it
[1:04:18] or not we know what the power of God has
[1:04:21] done in our lives amen
[1:04:22] we don't go bragging and telling what
[1:04:24] God did on every street corner
[1:04:25] we don't brag with the sign out front
[1:04:27] but we know what our church stands for
[1:04:29] the power of the Holy Spirit to bring
[1:04:32] real conviction into real lives to
[1:04:34] really sanctify them out so they can be
[1:04:36] filled with the Holy Ghost and then
[1:04:38] these signs follow then they'll believe
[1:04:40] sometimes in your life you'll receive
[1:04:42] healings and tongues and interpretations
[1:04:44] and prophecies that's what our church
[1:04:46] should be known for the power of God
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:48] it's not we're not the true Church
[1:04:50] because that's what he says that is your
[1:04:53] test we're not to be known by the way we
[1:04:55] worship are we always sing these types
[1:04:57] of songs or we all stand when we do this
[1:04:59] we all sit when we do we do this but we
[1:05:02] should be known that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:03] moves in power and I want you to notice
[1:05:08] right here that this era did not have
[1:05:10] the signs and wonders among them they
[1:05:13] gave up the power of God for the power
[1:05:15] of the state they clung to their own
[1:05:16] name
[1:05:17] they made their names great it was that
[1:05:20] old spear getting everyone into its fold
[1:05:22] see we don't want to promote our name I
[1:05:25] don't want you to promote me we want to
[1:05:27] promote Jesus Christ that's why when we
[1:05:30] testify saying oh God moved into our
[1:05:31] church or God blessed somebody with the
[1:05:33] healing in our church or God answered
[1:05:34] our prayer always testify about Jesus
[1:05:36] not about all of us testify about Christ
[1:05:39] amen that's our truth that's the true
[1:05:42] church we don't cling to our names we
[1:05:46] cling to Christ's name just want to make
[1:05:49] sure I say that today the Baptist's want
[1:05:51] the messes to come over to the Baptist's
[1:05:53] the Methodists are out to preside the
[1:05:54] Presbyterians and the Pentecostals want
[1:05:57] them all each claims to offer the MOE
[1:05:59] and to hold out the greatest hopes a
[1:06:01] sort of door to heaven or at least the
[1:06:04] way to a more abundant entrance how
[1:06:06] tragic it all is right because they want
[1:06:09] to go after different denominations and
[1:06:12] so it's dangerous right you should not
[1:06:14] when you should not try to proselyte and
[1:06:17] church how we do it here we don't
[1:06:19] process like we don't go another
[1:06:20] churches and try to pull them and make
[1:06:21] them all come to our church we don't
[1:06:23] process like that but one thing we do
[1:06:25] have we have this confidence all that
[1:06:27] the father has given us will come to us
[1:06:29] we are the only message Church in this
[1:06:32] city as far as I know and we don't
[1:06:34] proselyte from other churches to try to
[1:06:36] bring them in we want to bring in all
[1:06:37] God's sheep and we want to be able to
[1:06:39] receive all the turn of God we want all
[1:06:41] God's order to come to our church if
[1:06:43] they're called to our church if they
[1:06:45] don't that's fine it's fine up to them
[1:06:47] we're not trying to proselyte and beg
[1:06:48] people to come to this church and pay
[1:06:50] them money or promised them offices if
[1:06:52] they'll come to their church will
[1:06:53] promise them one thing eternal life if
[1:06:55] they'll believe amen that's a hollow
[1:06:58] promise see proselyting is like Oh join
[1:07:00] our church and we'll give you something
[1:07:01] or we'll make you famous or we're so
[1:07:04] we're nothing Christ is everything here
[1:07:06] amen and it's tragic when they just want
[1:07:08] to proselyte into the church all right
[1:07:12] so sad but we want people to know Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ it makes me cry honestly it makes
[1:07:16] me cry weak when people come in here get
[1:07:18] baptized and then fall away it makes me
[1:07:20] weep and cry because I want them to know
[1:07:22] Christ like I know Christ and if they
[1:07:24] knew Christ like I knew Christ they
[1:07:26] would never leave the Word of God and it
[1:07:28] makes me weep and cry when we we
[1:07:30] struggle and pray for them so hard and
[1:07:32] then they deny the Word of God but
[1:07:34] that's fine we'll just keep praying and
[1:07:35] believing but we'll be the life we are
[1:07:37] the light of the world we must stand as
[1:07:39] a city on a hill that cannot be hid and
[1:07:42] we must let our good works be seen
[1:07:43] before men not to brag or boast but let
[1:07:46] the power of God show through our lives
[1:07:47] I told you I prayed for one of our
[1:07:51] co-workers remember this he's a janitor
[1:07:52] and remember I told you about this he
[1:07:54] almost died and I said lord I prayed at
[1:07:56] that school I said if you bring him out
[1:07:58] I'll testify about Jesus Christ in well
[1:08:00] God brought him out he was in a coma for
[1:08:01] three weeks and they almost pulled the
[1:08:03] plug on him but God brought him out and
[1:08:06] he's back at work and I witnessed to him
[1:08:08] and I'm trying to get in and I said we
[1:08:09] got to talk about your soul we got to
[1:08:11] talk about your soul and he keeps
[1:08:12] putting it off
[1:08:13] well I seen him a few weeks ago when I
[1:08:14] was at the school and he said Jessie he
[1:08:17] said I gotta tell you something
[1:08:18] something happened to me I was on my
[1:08:19] deck behind my house and there was all
[1:08:22] this patio furniture and he said he said
[1:08:27] we already had a tree that was leaning I
[1:08:29] was and it was leaning like right it
[1:08:31] would have fell right on him I guess it
[1:08:33] was a big huge tree but they just let it
[1:08:35] lean I guess it grew crooked anyways I'm
[1:08:36] trying to remember the story he said we
[1:08:38] had an awful storm in copley he said
[1:08:41] lightning hit the tree or something
[1:08:43] happened and he said it should have
[1:08:46] fallen on me because he said the laws of
[1:08:48] nature say that if a tree is leaning
[1:08:51] this way it falls he said it should have
[1:08:53] hit me our house and our furniture we
[1:08:55] should have lost everything he said but
[1:08:57] when something struck that tree he said
[1:08:59] it fell the opposite way he said Jessie
[1:09:02] what did that and I said God did that
[1:09:06] and he knew it but he was wanting me to
[1:09:09] say it because he says he doesn't really
[1:09:11] have a believe in God and he told me
[1:09:13] again he said Jessie what did that what
[1:09:15] defy the laws of nature and gravity I
[1:09:16] said God did that sir he's trying to get
[1:09:19] a hold of your life he brought you out
[1:09:20] of a coma and he brought you back here
[1:09:22] he saved you from being crushed by a
[1:09:23] tree he brought you back here I said so
[1:09:25] when can we meet up and talk about your
[1:09:27] soul so I'm waiting on his text to get
[1:09:29] back to me that was just last week see
[1:09:32] God is trying to prove to everybody that
[1:09:33] he's the god of power amen glory just
[1:09:36] showed into him God is the god of power
[1:09:38] he denies nature remember Tim Myers
[1:09:41] testimony when he was a boy he was
[1:09:43] riding a tractor he was riding his dad's
[1:09:46] tractor that he was dad was a farmer he
[1:09:49] said he was riding on a hill and this is
[1:09:51] his own testimony if you remember I
[1:09:52] don't remember this or not he said he
[1:09:54] was riding on a hill and the weight of
[1:09:56] the tractor was overcoming him and he
[1:09:59] said the tractor leaned like kind of
[1:10:03] lean I forget what it was and it just
[1:10:04] kind of stuck on its side and it stopped
[1:10:07] in midair and he fell off and the
[1:10:10] tractor hung there on the hill like
[1:10:12] halfway in the air and he said once he
[1:10:14] got off a walked away the tractor then
[1:10:16] fell down
[1:10:16] that's Tim Myers testimony and so he
[1:10:20] used that testimony to show that God
[1:10:22] controls the laws of nature he said it
[1:10:25] should have fell on me but it
[1:10:27] because God was protected my life what
[1:10:30] do we serve we serve the Living God amen
[1:10:32] the god of power but see it's tragic
[1:10:35] when people try to convert or proselyte
[1:10:38] but God will show all his children his
[1:10:41] love and power he'll draw all them unto
[1:10:43] Him amen
[1:10:45] now trying to bring this down to close
[1:10:47] here here we go yeah I got twenty
[1:10:48] minutes
[1:10:49] that's plane time in closing our
[1:10:52] comments on this verse Oh verse 1
[1:10:54] revelation 3:1 Jesus says thou hast a
[1:10:58] name that thou lovest and our dead I
[1:11:00] cannot impress upon you too strongly
[1:11:02] that in this case go it brought the
[1:11:06] Reformation was most certainly rebuked
[1:11:08] by God instead of being praised because
[1:11:10] it sold the seeds of denomination that
[1:11:12] organized right back to the harlot
[1:11:14] that's why God rebukes us so much
[1:11:17] because instead of being free oh we're
[1:11:19] free from the harlot they just act like
[1:11:21] her and they denominated lock themselves
[1:11:23] in and that's why God was so upset with
[1:11:26] this church they didn't go on with more
[1:11:28] of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:30] they stopped right there now that's
[1:11:31] dangerous for us as masters believers we
[1:11:33] got to keep going on with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:35] well we say well I know about God I know
[1:11:37] about water baptism but how about more
[1:11:39] of the Holy Spirit our daily lives how
[1:11:40] about that we all need more of that by
[1:11:42] the grace of God any church today could
[1:11:44] nominate just as easily as they
[1:11:47] denominated by denying the further
[1:11:49] working of the Holy Spirit exactly right
[1:11:53] now I'm gonna skip that thus instead of
[1:11:58] being a great spiritual move with all
[1:12:00] the earmarks of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:01] influence as when God used purely
[1:12:04] spiritual means to accomplish his ends
[1:12:06] at Pentecost
[1:12:06] it was indeed a work wherein the wrath
[1:12:09] of God praise God and the results
[1:12:12] paralleled the history of Israel and
[1:12:14] when she left Egypt of wandering the
[1:12:16] desert not making it the Canaan land
[1:12:18] however much was accomplished in in that
[1:12:21] where the yoke of Rome was even partly
[1:12:23] broken men could now receive the Word of
[1:12:25] God and yield to the influence of the
[1:12:27] sphere without such great fear as
[1:12:29] formerly this opened the door to the
[1:12:31] great missionary age to follow Amon is
[1:12:33] that wonderful he said even though they
[1:12:35] denominated there were some people that
[1:12:37] got free and stayed free and
[1:12:40] that open the door to the great
[1:12:42] missionary age amen
[1:12:44] almost done here almost done I'm sorry
[1:12:47] let me go back
[1:12:48] this is his closing comment on the
[1:12:50] denunciation or Jesus's rebuke upon the
[1:12:53] church age the Jezebel Thyatira was in
[1:12:57] no mood to give up her hold upon the
[1:12:59] people because member she had it for 900
[1:13:00] years remember she had for 900 years on
[1:13:02] the fire dear in church age and thus we
[1:13:05] see her daughter Ethel AIA member
[1:13:07] atholea raised her head in the Sardis
[1:13:11] and age with the hopes that she would be
[1:13:13] able to strangle the true seen by her
[1:13:16] schemes of organization so we're looking
[1:13:18] at type now Jezebel was the spirit of
[1:13:20] Tyre tiara and now the denominations of
[1:13:23] Sardis are the atholea of Jezebel's
[1:13:26] motherhood okay so in other words the
[1:13:30] denominations of the Lutheran age were
[1:13:32] the daughters of the mother harlot
[1:13:34] that's what it's saying okay now
[1:13:36] remember this is the bio dictionary
[1:13:38] after liya means whom God afflicts in
[1:13:41] that an awful name to have whom God we
[1:13:44] don't want to be afflicted nah we know
[1:13:45] we know their suffering we want to be
[1:13:46] blessed by God not afflicted but they
[1:13:48] chose her to name or Athlon that strange
[1:13:50] the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and the
[1:13:53] wife of Jay who ran the king of Judah
[1:13:55] who walked in the ways of the house of
[1:13:57] Ahab called daughter of Omri on the
[1:14:01] death of her husband and of her son at
[1:14:03] I'm sorry Isaiah she resolved to seat
[1:14:07] herself on the vacant throne remember
[1:14:09] that her husband died her son died so
[1:14:12] she said oh if they die I'll take the
[1:14:14] throne a woman taking the throne see how
[1:14:17] that's the type of the denominational
[1:14:19] spirit and Luther taking the throne
[1:14:21] right instead of letting the Holy Spirit
[1:14:23] do it she slew awe as has I as children
[1:14:28] except joash the youngest after a reign
[1:14:30] of six years she was put to death in an
[1:14:32] insurrection certain up among the people
[1:14:34] in connection with Josiah being crowned
[1:14:36] as king remember they say that in the
[1:14:37] seed mermen they say the seed of David a
[1:14:40] saving of him and she was queen for six
[1:14:42] years but then they brought out the boy
[1:14:43] made him King remember that the little
[1:14:45] boy that's beautiful so that's the type
[1:14:49] church that's the type the Sardis church
[1:14:52] age is the daughter to
[1:14:54] the mothers let's go back to there so I
[1:14:55] can show that one more time then we're
[1:14:57] almost done
[1:14:58] okay so let's show that again so Jezebel
[1:15:02] the fire to your age that's the mother
[1:15:04] harlot and the daughters so the the
[1:15:07] daughters the Lutheran's and all the
[1:15:10] i'ts and his sights and Hussites all the
[1:15:12] things they were the daughter when they
[1:15:14] denominated they they were the daughter
[1:15:16] of the mother hards that makes sense
[1:15:18] everybody okay this was the mother Roman
[1:15:21] Church all the churches that came out
[1:15:23] and denominated were harlots
[1:15:24] now Luther was not a harlot Luther was
[1:15:27] not he was a true man of God it was a
[1:15:29] generation after him that was the
[1:15:31] harlots because they denarii and so this
[1:15:33] is as far as we can go we can't learn
[1:15:35] anything else we can't grow any further
[1:15:37] than the Holy Spirit oh god help us to
[1:15:39] grow in the Holy Spirit amen help us to
[1:15:40] learn more the Holy Spirit's love more
[1:15:42] of his power amen we have to have that
[1:15:46] Russell denominator we have to move on
[1:15:49] with the Holy Spirit now I have a few
[1:15:51] last quotes I got one two three four few
[1:15:53] more slides here then we'll be done I
[1:15:54] can't go much for that God speak all
[1:15:57] week here at school I've already lost my
[1:15:58] voice she actually sounds pretty good
[1:16:00] tonight by God's grace alright now
[1:16:02] here's the sermon listen to the sermon
[1:16:04] again on Saturday listen to the whole
[1:16:05] sermon on Saturday again last Saturday
[1:16:08] of the Sardis Church age from 1960
[1:16:10] here's something I want to throw in I
[1:16:11] don't know if you do this we raise it at
[1:16:13] church Adam no okay okay and sister Bo
[1:16:18] did you have confirmations in your
[1:16:19] church growing up they couldn't firm you
[1:16:21] guys when you were like 16 okay they
[1:16:27] didn't in our church either but my
[1:16:28] wife's Church had it they had
[1:16:29] confirmation services so you guys do you
[1:16:31] know what that is it's kind of like when
[1:16:34] they make they confirm you as you're out
[1:16:36] you're now a member of the church and
[1:16:38] you're like 16 years old it's like a
[1:16:40] false conversion in other words they
[1:16:42] educate you to the church rather than
[1:16:44] your being born into the church but my
[1:16:48] wife was raised in a Lutheran Church and
[1:16:49] that's what they did for her so my wife
[1:16:52] was confirmed I think at 16 years old or
[1:16:54] 15 we kind of laughed
[1:16:57] it's a sad it's a sad laugh okay I'm not
[1:17:00] making fun of the church it's just a sad
[1:17:02] laugh because that's how they get
[1:17:03] members and brother John brother John
[1:17:05] Graham he was confirmed in Lutheran
[1:17:07] Church and after God confirm
[1:17:08] he his mom gave the choice when I go
[1:17:09] back to church anymore he said no said
[1:17:11] why should I go there's nothing there
[1:17:12] for me and he left the church so see
[1:17:15] that's what a lot of people believe they
[1:17:16] just want to get them confirmed and then
[1:17:18] think they're saved well you don't got
[1:17:20] to get confirmed you got to get borned
[1:17:21] you got to get born in the kingdom of
[1:17:23] God now this is a kind of a I say a
[1:17:27] funny quote brother Branham gives but
[1:17:28] it's a very true quote as well so this
[1:17:30] quote he said oh all that confirming
[1:17:33] service what I'm trying to say take them
[1:17:36] down and confirm them give them the
[1:17:38] first communion and confirm them there's
[1:17:40] no such thing as confirming in the Bible
[1:17:42] so that's what the Lutheran's new church
[1:17:44] the Lutheran's and even the Catholics
[1:17:47] through their first communion you
[1:17:48] remember that you ever know anybody
[1:17:49] that's Catholic they've let them do
[1:17:51] their first communion when they're I
[1:17:52] think like 9 or 10 or something like
[1:17:54] that they teach them all the Catholic
[1:17:55] doctrine then they let them do their
[1:17:57] first communion so it's kind of like
[1:17:59] that
[1:18:00] it's kinda like educating members of the
[1:18:01] church whether we have said the only
[1:18:03] confirming that's mentioned the Bible is
[1:18:06] when God confirmed his word with signs
[1:18:09] and wonders following him so brother
[1:18:12] I've got to makes a joke on the word
[1:18:13] confirm now it's not really a joke but
[1:18:15] it's true so let's go to mark 16 let's
[1:18:16] read that so you know the only
[1:18:19] confirming in the Bible is when God
[1:18:21] confirms you're a believer with miracles
[1:18:23] that's the only one but see the
[1:18:26] denomination is denominated and now they
[1:18:29] confirm members oh you're 15 or 16 you
[1:18:32] learned all our our Creed's now you're
[1:18:34] confirmed now you're a real member of
[1:18:35] the church and that's there's nothing
[1:18:37] true about that in the Bible Matthew
[1:18:39] Mark Luke okay mark 16 this is a
[1:18:44] beautiful scripture for a while that's
[1:18:46] one of my favorite Scripture God when I
[1:18:47] travel other places I would normally
[1:18:49] quote this scripture because it gave me
[1:18:50] such strength and courage mark 16 verse
[1:18:54] yes 20 last verse of the book of Mark
[1:18:58] mark 16:20 Brad you ever read that
[1:19:00] Forster yes praise God where that makes
[1:19:12] a little joke the Sardis church age
[1:19:15] started the confirmations brother have
[1:19:17] said the only confirmation is God
[1:19:19] confirming his believers with miracles
[1:19:22] hey man I love that don't you love that
[1:19:24] I love how he's a scriptural prophet see
[1:19:27] the denominations take Bible words and
[1:19:29] they change them to make them use
[1:19:30] whatever they want but I love my brother
[1:19:32] and we'll take it right back to the Word
[1:19:33] of God that's that that's what believers
[1:19:36] that's how believers are confirmed right
[1:19:37] there
[1:19:38] God has supernatural following your life
[1:19:39] amen that's the confirming not the
[1:19:42] confirming of the belonging to a
[1:19:44] Lutheran Church but God confirming his
[1:19:46] word in you and then he quotes this and
[1:19:49] the Lord was working with them mark 16
[1:19:51] confirming the word with signs following
[1:19:53] that's the confirming of the Pentecostal
[1:19:55] church that's God confirms himself alive
[1:19:58] as a miracle-working God in the church
[1:20:00] speaking in tongues interpretation of
[1:20:02] tongues and doing the same things they
[1:20:04] did at the beginning you like that a man
[1:20:06] thought that was a blessing I don't
[1:20:11] remember why I had this quote so I'm not
[1:20:12] gonna read that one tonight I'm just
[1:20:13] gonna close to this one I closed this I
[1:20:17] closed part 1 of this series by telling
[1:20:19] this story about the cat remember
[1:20:21] rubbing the cat backwards you guys
[1:20:22] remember that when I preached out here
[1:20:24] and that might have been the night I
[1:20:25] prayed to witness to my mother about
[1:20:28] denomination that might have been that
[1:20:29] same night I think it was but I wanted
[1:20:34] to show you this vision so you know it's
[1:20:35] a vision you know it wasn't it wasn't a
[1:20:37] dream it was a vision and visions member
[1:20:40] never fail right they always they're
[1:20:42] always true
[1:20:44] brother Graham is in Tulsa Oklahoma and
[1:20:47] he said I was getting an awful mess
[1:20:49] there them denominations begin swinging
[1:20:50] around there and I was sitting up this
[1:20:52] building one day and I seen a vision I
[1:20:55] seen a pretty little old kitten and he
[1:20:57] was laying on a silk pillow and he was a
[1:20:59] cutest little fellow and I walked over
[1:21:01] there and I'm afraid of a cat brother
[1:21:03] man was afraid of cats
[1:21:04] he said he's afraid of cats and swords
[1:21:06] did you know that and I went over and I
[1:21:09] began to rake him and he was going you
[1:21:12] know how they do that funny noise you
[1:21:14] know I was raking him and I said pretty
[1:21:16] little kitty and he said purr just as
[1:21:19] fine you know he had a vision of this
[1:21:21] church and I looked over behind his
[1:21:23] pillow and it said Pentecostal kitten
[1:21:27] well I thought now isn't this strange
[1:21:30] and I said this has got to be a vision a
[1:21:33] Pentecostal kitten
[1:21:35] now notice it's not a line it's a kitten
[1:21:39] it's in the same family but it's a
[1:21:41] different species I believe we're not
[1:21:43] mistaken
[1:21:44] family order genus species one of those
[1:21:47] I think bow memorize that one time I had
[1:21:49] to memorize in high school I forget it
[1:21:50] now it's the same family the cat family
[1:21:52] the feline different species I think I
[1:21:55] could be correct me after service if I'm
[1:21:57] right wrong in that one and something
[1:21:59] said to brother and the Holy Spirit said
[1:22:00] to brother Branham as long as you rake
[1:22:03] his fur this way all right but now if
[1:22:06] you want to see what he's made of
[1:22:08] rake his fur backwards see so when I
[1:22:12] raked his fur back so before he was
[1:22:14] petting the kitty pretty little kitty
[1:22:16] pretty little kitty and someone said
[1:22:20] rake him backwards so he took it and
[1:22:22] went backward so made his hair go the
[1:22:24] opposite way instead of the regular way
[1:22:26] pulling his hair backwards so when I
[1:22:30] raked it back then I stuck out green and
[1:22:32] he was a monster standing there spitting
[1:22:35] at me as hard as he could a cat when he
[1:22:39] started going backwards on the ferns
[1:22:41] that pretty little kitty pretty little
[1:22:43] denomination pretty little denomination
[1:22:46] right oh you're just a pretty believer
[1:22:48] pretty good believer petting them see
[1:22:56] this is a vision church is a vision see
[1:23:00] just rake his fur back a little bit tell
[1:23:02] him the Baptism and the Father Son Holy
[1:23:04] Ghost is of the devil and of the
[1:23:08] Catholic Church watch what happens to
[1:23:11] him see his furs get up so see now no
[1:23:17] how do we act when someone condemns our
[1:23:19] beliefs see this is how just the
[1:23:21] denominational person will act if you
[1:23:23] say one bad thing about their belief
[1:23:25] though their eyes will bug out and
[1:23:27] they'll turn into a monster in other
[1:23:30] words they'll get their get fiery mad
[1:23:33] they're gonna really get upset at you
[1:23:35] when you say one bad thing about what
[1:23:36] they believe but how do we act Church
[1:23:39] when someone does something that we
[1:23:41] don't agree with how do we act well
[1:23:44] Graham tells us he says if you can't
[1:23:46] disagree with the man things and then
[1:23:48] shake his hand and still have the
[1:23:49] same feelings towards and then there's
[1:23:52] something wrong with you if I can't
[1:23:56] disagree with the man bitterly from from
[1:23:58] one side to the other and still think as
[1:24:01] much of him as Christ would then there's
[1:24:02] something wrong with my spirit I have in
[1:24:06] the Spirit of Christ see if he says well
[1:24:08] brother Branham I believe you're
[1:24:09] teaching this and that all right brother
[1:24:12] let's come together to reason you and I
[1:24:13] will take it ourselves we'll go over
[1:24:14] here in the room to ourselves well
[1:24:16] reason it out that's from 1963 it's kind
[1:24:19] of like this recently I've sat down and
[1:24:20] I've had some really good conversations
[1:24:22] with some brothers and Jose was there i
[1:24:24] sat down with the brother recently Kevin
[1:24:26] knows him a really fantastic beautiful
[1:24:28] brother but he believes it so we should
[1:24:30] play more tapes but we got to sit down
[1:24:32] and Jose stood right there and we
[1:24:34] disagreed bitterly but at the end we
[1:24:36] smiled and shook hands and I think so
[1:24:39] much of him I think he's just a
[1:24:42] wonderful Christian cuz he loves the
[1:24:43] Lord so much I don't think any lesson
[1:24:46] although we bitterly disagree about
[1:24:47] preachers and tapes and services
[1:24:51] although he disagree bitterly at the end
[1:24:54] of it we're still able to shake each
[1:24:55] other's hands and I'm still waiting on
[1:24:58] some course he told me there's some
[1:24:59] quotes I've never heard him before I'm
[1:25:00] still waiting on those quotes and
[1:25:02] hopefully I'll hear those from him
[1:25:03] pretty soon I honestly don't think they
[1:25:05] exist I just disagree with that I
[1:25:07] disagree with some of the things that
[1:25:09] they believe but this church the thing
[1:25:12] is we can shake hands and hug each other
[1:25:14] and I think just as much of him as
[1:25:15] hopefully he does of me is that how you
[1:25:18] feel with people you should feel that
[1:25:19] way with people when even when they
[1:25:20] disagree with what we believe but that's
[1:25:23] recently a good example of that of when
[1:25:26] I can see this in my own life I see this
[1:25:28] manifesting in my life I can disagree
[1:25:30] with people I still love them praise God
[1:25:33] let's say in our fetus last quote and he
[1:25:36] just cuts me to pieces and I have to say
[1:25:38] things back to him if in my heart I
[1:25:41] can't feel the same about him that he's
[1:25:43] still my brother and I'm trying to help
[1:25:44] this guy then I'll never help him
[1:25:48] there's no way for me to help him if I
[1:25:51] don't love him what's the use of going
[1:25:53] over there
[1:25:54] tell him the first place brother I don't
[1:25:57] love you and let me get that out of my
[1:25:59] heart right here before we go in there
[1:26:00] because I can't help you it's
[1:26:03] I love you a man you appreciate that
[1:26:06] quote I thought that was a good it's a
[1:26:08] good check you know because here I am
[1:26:09] more preaching on the cat you know if oh
[1:26:11] that's how denomination she'll be black
[1:26:13] but we've got to make sure the
[1:26:15] denominational spirit that doesn't
[1:26:17] battle us praise God and doesn't
[1:26:19] overcome us so if somebody totally
[1:26:21] disagrees with the way we do church
[1:26:23] order or the way we believe in gifts or
[1:26:25] the way we pray at the end of service or
[1:26:30] I think we believe about the seals of
[1:26:32] the church ages are the book of
[1:26:34] Revelation we can stand there and be
[1:26:36] just as loving to the person and feel it
[1:26:38] in our heart that's what I want I want
[1:26:40] to feel love into my heart for somebody
[1:26:42] who even thinks I'm wrong and then that
[1:26:44] shows I got the right spirit praise God
[1:26:47] mama closer to that by the grace alone
[1:26:50] there's more quotes like I said I got a
[1:26:51] lot more quote you love the Lord Jesus
[1:27:00] tonight let's just no word of Prayer
[1:27:03] let's ask God to give us the right
[1:27:05] spirit and to remember how important
[1:27:08] these services are we looked at the
[1:27:09] Seven Stars tonight let me review real
[1:27:13] quick look at the denunciation right we
[1:27:16] want to live the name of Christ we want
[1:27:17] the power of Christ in our church don't
[1:27:19] we Halloween us pray for that as we pose
[1:27:21] to to keep the power of Christ our life
[1:27:23] and the voice be loving not the nominate
[1:27:25] and be full of God's love of power
[1:27:28] Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord
[1:27:30] Jesus nor this is a sacred time I
[1:27:35] remember on the way here that the pillar
[1:27:37] fire came down to show how important
[1:27:40] these quotes were how important this
[1:27:43] teaching was to know how the Holy Spirit
[1:27:46] lived in the life of Martin Luther the
[1:27:48] good things from his life and all the
[1:27:50] other believers to show what the Holy
[1:27:52] Ghost was like but then also to show how
[1:27:55] many displeased the Holy Ghost and the
[1:27:58] rallied around denominations and rallied
[1:28:00] around men rather than the power of God
[1:28:05] Lord I've never heard tonight at all I
[1:28:07] know my throat hurts the Lord I just
[1:28:09] want to make sure I take a few moments I
[1:28:11] want to thank you for the times that
[1:28:14] your power has moved in our church Lord
[1:28:16] God anointing different ones Lord God
[1:28:19] for divine healing we thank you for that
[1:28:21] Lord most importantly thank you for
[1:28:24] anointing those to receive salvation for
[1:28:27] their souls for there is no greater
[1:28:29] miracle than the salvation of a soul or
[1:28:32] God the Father I believe I found the
[1:28:34] other day I think we have 19 souls in
[1:28:37] our church at dolls or now we have the
[1:28:39] numerous children I have more than that
[1:28:40] Lord that have we believe have been
[1:28:43] saved heaven
[1:28:44] baptize in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:47] Christ and their their sins are now
[1:28:50] remitted their sins are underneath the
[1:28:52] blood of Jesus Christ help us never
[1:28:54] forget those mighty miracles in the
[1:28:56] power God in order to be close well lord
[1:29:00] help us to be filled with love more God
[1:29:02] if we disagree with any person the Lord
[1:29:04] God may we still think of them so much
[1:29:07] even though we might bitterly disagree
[1:29:10] but still be so full of love that we
[1:29:14] think as much of them as Christ thinks
[1:29:16] of them and we know in Christ follow
[1:29:18] them Christ died for them Lord God
[1:29:20] that's how much he loved them so help us
[1:29:24] to have that kind of love dear Jesus to
[1:29:26] think so highly of those that disagree
[1:29:28] with us those that won't cover the
[1:29:29] church those that won't listen to those
[1:29:31] services won't listen to the messages
[1:29:32] Lord God help us make so much of them

[1:40:00] credit he had to help somebody's along
[1:40:02] the way somehow he helped his two
[1:40:04] daughters get out of sight of the Lord
[1:40:05] God he pulled them out of the homosexual
