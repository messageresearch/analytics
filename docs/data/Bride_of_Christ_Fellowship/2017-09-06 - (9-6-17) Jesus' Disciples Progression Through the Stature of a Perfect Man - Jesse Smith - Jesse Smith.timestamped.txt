[27:00] like to continue the for Sunday night
[27:05] which Sunday night you just looked at
[27:07] sanctification for the little children
[27:09] who the Bible study with the children
[27:11] they have to read a lot of verses I
[27:13] thought that was very wonderful got some
[27:15] good feedback on that few so I was happy
[27:16] those blessing but I just want to maybe
[27:19] choose one scripture I think it was let
[27:21] me get two real quick sigh don't miss
[27:22] Corder this one get to one scripture
[27:26] here about the disciples Luke 17 verse 3
[27:32] that's why I went to Luke 17 verse 3:17
[27:38] 3 how many be happy to be announced the
[27:40] Lord tonight a man I've always David
[27:42] said I was happy when they said to me
[27:44] let's go to church Luke 17 30 phrase God
[27:49] and as my true heart's desire just to be
[27:51] in the house the Lord with his people
[27:53] praise God because that's the best place
[27:55] to be a men gathered with God's people
[27:57] Luke 17 3 verse 20 verses 3 4 & 5 if I
[28:03] had a title tonight I like to just call
[28:05] it Jesus's disciples progression through
[28:09] the statue of perfect man now that's a
[28:11] long title I think you know what I mean
[28:13] in other words the progress of how Jesus
[28:15] disciples were sanctified that was a
[28:18] thought that was so gripping me on
[28:20] Sunday and I was talking to brother
[28:22] Scott afterwards and I was like you know
[28:25] that's one of those studies I like to
[28:26] give more time to in preaching so that's
[28:27] all I couldn't get away from it all week
[28:29] I just studied on it day and night in
[28:30] the morning and night studying this so
[28:32] let's look at this here Luke 17 verse 3
[28:36] would you okay thank you will pie read a
[28:40] couple verses together
[28:44] look at the shorter ones well let's just
[28:47] read them the last one together
[28:48] I'll read three and four and then we'll
[28:50] all read five together take heed to
[28:52] yourselves if thy brother trespass
[28:54] against thee rebuke him
[28:57] so Jesus give you the license if
[28:58] somebody sinned against you you got a
[29:00] right to rebuke them amen Church you got
[29:04] a right to do it but you just want to do
[29:06] it the Bible said also sometimes you
[29:07] have to do it in meekness of sincerity
[29:09] praise the Lord and if he repent forgive
[29:13] him and if he trespassed against these
[29:15] seven times in a day and seven times in
[29:20] a day turn again to thee saying I repent
[29:22] he said thou shalt forgive him let's
[29:26] read verse five and the Apostle said
[29:28] unto the Lord increase our faith so they
[29:32] had faith correct but in order to be
[29:35] able to forgive their brother seven
[29:38] times in one day they said Lord I need
[29:40] more faith for that I don't have the
[29:43] faith I need to forgive Adam seven times
[29:46] in one day I don't know if I can forgive
[29:48] bang seven times in one day I need some
[29:50] more faith for that how many uh how many
[29:54] would like God to give them more
[29:55] sanctification praise God who else would
[29:57] like more faith I'd like more faith in
[29:58] my life you can always get more but we
[30:01] got to seek it as we saw in Sunday we
[30:03] have to seek those things that's just
[30:05] Bauer hasn't word of prayer if you have
[30:06] a need on your heart just make an order
[30:07] to God as we pray father again we come
[30:11] in prayer Lord prayer so powerful it is
[30:13] the most powerful weapon you've ever
[30:15] given us so we take this slingshot of
[30:17] Prayer Lord God and we load it with the
[30:19] revelation you've given us the message
[30:20] of the hour and we fling it at the enemy
[30:22] Lord we come against the enemy in Jesus
[30:24] Christ's name hallelujah Lord may this
[30:26] prayer Lord defeat any foe in here
[30:29] tonight may defeat anyone livestreaming
[30:31] any any demon that's battling them may
[30:33] defeat the demon powers Lord Jesus and
[30:36] father anyone who watches on archival or
[30:39] may the power of this word Lord God go
[30:41] out and help your people all those who
[30:44] are hungry and thirsting for the
[30:46] righteousness of Jesus Christ tonight
[30:47] thank you oh we're such a privileged
[30:49] people to have a hunger to come to your
[30:51] house
[30:52] bless us now with that divine presence
[30:54] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[30:56] said Amen god bless she's mean see their
[30:59] praise God I've set my timer I'll just
[31:00] try to be an hour I've been trying to be
[31:02] faithful to that for my sake and for
[31:06] yours watch my health here so praise God
[31:12] okay so my purpose tonight is to
[31:14] continue this thought and give me a
[31:16] moment I'll just I want to go through
[31:18] this picture Malachi can you switch over
[31:20] here I just want to go over that little
[31:22] slideshow I showed on Sunday to the
[31:24] little children I just like to maybe go
[31:26] over that just briefly with you and then
[31:28] as we get into the new material or the
[31:30] new things I haven't preached you know
[31:33] that will be fresh by the grace of Lord
[31:35] okay we'll just quickly go through this
[31:37] Sunday we just took an hour I think we
[31:39] ended right at five o'clock I think we
[31:41] just had our Bible study we looked at
[31:44] what is sanctification its purification
[31:47] of your heart and life brother Graham
[31:50] calls it her purifying your daily habits
[31:52] right so you get rid of all your bad
[31:54] habits so God can fill you with the Holy
[31:56] Ghost
[31:57] so sanctification is the will of God
[31:59] before you receive the Holy Ghost but it
[32:01] continues even after praise God Jesus
[32:03] pray right before he was arrested and
[32:05] crucified he prayed sanctify them
[32:07] through thy truth thy Word is truth Paul
[32:10] said here it is the absolute will of God
[32:12] to be sanctified
[32:14] so people wonder what's God's will for
[32:16] this service well it's very likely that
[32:18] you get sanctified some more it's very
[32:20] likely that you and I get more purified
[32:22] amen and then verse that's nineteen five
[32:25] twenty three takes it to the rest of
[32:26] your life because it says that your
[32:29] whole body spirit soul be preserved
[32:31] blameless or sanctified until the coming
[32:34] of the Lord amen so we know st. vacation
[32:36] continues but it's so crucial because we
[32:40] know in this hour very few people are
[32:41] going to be born again so it's very
[32:43] crucial that we pay attention during
[32:44] sanctification messages that we make
[32:47] sure we're not deceived in this hour
[32:49] whether I am taught that you and I can
[32:51] know exactly where we are at any time I
[32:53] remember this quote we've been preaching
[32:55] on the church ages it's hard to see but
[32:57] this is actually bold in here it's hard
[32:58] to see that sorry you can know exactly
[33:00] where you are with him at any time and
[33:02] all the time now what you may not know
[33:05] is that brother Branham knew exactly
[33:06] where he was with God
[33:08] how many one know where they are with
[33:09] God by God's grace here's our bow BAM
[33:11] says it brother Ram says in 1960 said
[33:14] because I have found the center of God's
[33:16] will
[33:17] he was off-center before and this time
[33:20] because he was putting too much emphasis
[33:22] on the discernment and God had to tell
[33:26] him stop putting so much discernment on
[33:27] the sorry emphasis on the discernment
[33:29] lines he said get back to praying for my
[33:31] sick children I don't remember that if
[33:34] you don't listen to that message if you
[33:36] don't he goes through the whole thing
[33:37] for years he put too much emphasis on
[33:39] prayer line I'm sorry too sir my
[33:41] discernment discernment and then God was
[33:43] saying you just get back to doing a few
[33:45] discernments and then ask the people to
[33:47] believe and then the faith of these few
[33:50] discernment should raise everybody's
[33:52] faith to receive their own healing get
[33:54] back to the Commission pray for God's
[33:56] sick children amen so he found himself
[33:58] at the center how many want to be at the
[34:00] center tonight I believe I'm at the
[34:02] center of God's will and I hope I hope
[34:04] everybody has that revelation for
[34:06] themselves how do you know because I
[34:07] prayed about it I've asked God for signs
[34:09] about it I've sought God for I've cried
[34:11] out to God for and God answers his
[34:13] children amen you might not have known
[34:16] this brother branham said he was at the
[34:18] center of God's will and then just three
[34:20] short years later because there's almost
[34:21] three years was even three four years he
[34:24] says by the help of God I'm directing
[34:26] the bride of Jesus Christ now all of us
[34:29] are behind but he was director praise
[34:33] the Lord he knew his position it wasn't
[34:36] off to the side or behind the scenes
[34:38] somebody's got to lead just like Moses
[34:41] with his staff brother Branham was out
[34:43] from the bride leading the bride amen
[34:45] I'm in the center of God's will and not
[34:49] only that in 1965 he said he got
[34:50] discouraged so he said I closed my eyes
[34:52] and said a prayer Lord help me to know
[34:55] where I am and let this Bible open up to
[34:58] find my position in the scripture glory
[35:00] and he said I put my scripture on his
[35:02] finger on a scripture Genesis 24/7 he
[35:06] said Ellie's were Abraham's faithful
[35:07] servant the model servant of the Bible
[35:10] being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac
[35:13] chills run over me he said sure that's
[35:16] right with the rest of my message
[35:17] pulling out the bride hallelujah so he
[35:22] knew it
[35:22] exactly where he was in the center of
[35:24] God's will
[35:25] I'm born again filled with the Holy
[35:27] Ghost I'm in the center of God's will
[35:29] with my with my gifts where I need to be
[35:31] I'm directing God's bride and I'm also
[35:34] hunting the rest of God's bride amen
[35:36] there was no wonder well where am i
[35:39] doing what am i doing now he's a 56 year
[35:42] old man here Church so that gives us
[35:45] hope right wait upon the Lord don't and
[35:47] most people here are guilty this I don't
[35:49] know anybody's guilty this here most of
[35:51] us are not gonna push ourselves into a
[35:52] gift right well I'm gonna push myself
[35:54] and I'm gonna make myself a preacher I'm
[35:57] gonna make myself a song leader I'm
[35:59] gonna make myself a deacon most of us
[36:01] aren't guilty of that here but what we
[36:04] need to do is keep seeking until we find
[36:06] the will of God we must not give up
[36:08] seeking we must keep seeking we must
[36:10] keep asking knocking we must stay on our
[36:13] knees how am I gonna stay on their knees
[36:14] amen till God answers that's real faith
[36:16] when you say on your knees til he
[36:18] answers Amen so we showed that brother
[36:20] Brad knew exactly where he was he was in
[36:22] the fivefold ministry he knew he's a
[36:23] prophet by the end he wrote it in the
[36:25] church age book so we can we can prove
[36:27] that but that's where I stopped it
[36:28] remember there was three stages to
[36:30] perfection I'm going to skip this most
[36:32] of you remember this when I preached on
[36:33] the three bodies terrestrial celestial
[36:37] glorified we just throw it show all
[36:38] those so I'm gonna skip past that mostly
[36:40] remember those guys always perfected in
[36:42] threes and so we looked at justification
[36:44] sanctification again the statue perfect
[36:47] man this is God's roadmap this is where
[36:49] we can know where we are in God at any
[36:51] time of course we have brother Adam says
[36:52] it in the church ages if you listen the
[36:54] stature of a man he ties this in with
[36:55] the church ages and the messengers so it
[36:58] all ties together here's where this this
[37:00] is this will start helping us if we
[37:03] really get down to business with God
[37:05] faith is the substance need to choose
[37:07] the way you've been baptized I'm
[37:08] following Christ the rest of my life
[37:10] virtue is the strength and daily walked
[37:13] away even in public because the Bible
[37:17] said Ruth was filled with virtue all the
[37:19] men in the city knew she was virtuous so
[37:21] virtue lives it in front of your work
[37:23] your co-workers virtue who lives it at
[37:26] your family gathering it doesn't
[37:28] compromise and well I'll just smoke a
[37:30] little over here is come with my family
[37:32] or I'll cuss a little bit with the guys
[37:33] at work you know know
[37:36] I'll wear a little make-up here I'll
[37:37] wear pants over here I'll wear shorts
[37:39] over here I'll show off my chest a
[37:41] little bit over here you know I'll do
[37:43] this or that it doesn't compromise when
[37:45] you got virtue you got strength to stand
[37:47] to be a witness knowledge is
[37:50] understanding why I do this I need to
[37:52] understand why I do this now I
[37:53] understand why because it's
[37:55] cross-dressing and it's abomination or
[37:57] now I understand why don't do these
[37:59] things temperance is self-control this
[38:02] is over your fleshly carnal lusts right
[38:06] self-control were needed to remain on
[38:07] this way we must have self-control we
[38:09] must crucify the lusts of the flesh this
[38:11] is why the Holy Spirit said to a man one
[38:13] time and a woman if you want the Holy
[38:16] Ghost give up the cigarettes because God
[38:19] is not going to fill a temple that can't
[38:21] even overcome a tiny little cigarette
[38:23] with the filter on the end a piece of
[38:25] tobacco
[38:26] if you can't overcome that how you gonna
[38:28] overcome Satan when he comes to you and
[38:30] you makes you feel like God don't hear
[38:32] your prayers between life and death
[38:34] if you can't overcome that stick of
[38:35] tobacco how you gonna overcome Satan
[38:37] himself but we need power to overcome
[38:39] six of tobacco bottles of whiskey right
[38:43] and we need the self-control to overcome
[38:45] that then be filled with the Holy Spirit
[38:47] patience is steadfast steadfast to be
[38:51] content on this way and not only content
[38:53] with men but content with God content
[38:57] with God God I'm content you let things
[39:00] happen I'm content with that I'll be
[39:02] steadfast and also have patience with
[39:05] other people to patience with your
[39:08] brother patience with your sister
[39:09] patience with the pastor if he's out of
[39:12] out of cater patience you have to have
[39:15] godly patience amen and then godliness
[39:18] program said it's me just like God and
[39:20] he said godliness God is so good he's
[39:22] kind to the his enemies to the just and
[39:25] the unjust so program said this one
[39:27] focuses on your enemies if you can't be
[39:29] good to your enemies how's he gonna fear
[39:30] what the Holy Ghost because God is good
[39:32] to his enemies he sends him rain every
[39:35] day right he sends him food he lets them
[39:36] to get all these things that they need
[39:37] and last before you get the Holy Ghost
[39:39] you have to be so selfless that you'll
[39:41] live for the people in the church you
[39:44] have a burden for people at church
[39:45] you'll want to live for them you'll want
[39:47] to come to church just for them amen
[39:50] for them and for course for Christ but
[39:51] you want to live in case you can help
[39:53] somebody out or pray for somebody or
[39:54] encourage somebody you live for the body
[39:57] of Jesus Christ amen and then you get
[40:00] the personal presence where it's Christ
[40:01] in you the hope of glory now here's the
[40:03] example as we went over just with the
[40:05] children so this is all review for the
[40:06] children
[40:07] the disciples argued who is greater so
[40:10] that proves their lack and brotherly
[40:11] kindness I'm greater than you brother
[40:13] amen
[40:13] nope maokai I'm Way greater than you and
[40:16] if you read the scripture they were
[40:18] arguing that after Jesus told them he
[40:20] was going to be crucified so it's almost
[40:23] like they were planning okay we know
[40:24] Jesus might die so who's gonna lead us
[40:27] after that they start arguing and say no
[40:29] it's me
[40:30] I'm greater than you I'm greater and
[40:33] that shows they didn't have brotherly
[40:34] kindness praise the Lord there were
[40:37] signs all over the place
[40:38] that we're lacking some virtues that we
[40:40] need next Jesus prayed that Peters faith
[40:43] would not fail even though all his
[40:44] virtue did he did not have enough virtue
[40:46] to stand up to men and at that or Jesus
[40:51] arrests out there in the courtyard of
[40:52] the high priest nor a little maid woman
[40:54] which would have been what 12 or 13 or
[40:56] 15 years old who knows he couldn't even
[40:59] stand there and say yes I know Jesus to
[41:01] a made girl which would be the lowest of
[41:03] society right outside of slaves
[41:05] you know women were lower than men of
[41:07] course so for you understand not today
[41:10] but you know in those days you
[41:12] understand he couldn't stand up to a
[41:14] little girl and say I followed Jesus
[41:16] Christ that's how much virtue he lost
[41:19] and then I talked about how today's
[41:21] sisters might compromise and wear pants
[41:24] you know to work and school or something
[41:27] like that like we talked about and I
[41:29] just wrote some more examples for
[41:31] today's sermon Wright brothers and
[41:32] church
[41:33] I've known this I know I've known
[41:35] brothers in the offices in church that
[41:37] go to work and lie to people and go to
[41:39] work and cuss in the message I've known
[41:43] people over the years they have offices
[41:45] they could be song leaders they could be
[41:46] piano players they could be preachers
[41:48] and when they go to work they tell dirty
[41:50] jokes I know that for a fact so don't
[41:54] tell me it doesn't happen it happens and
[41:56] so they put on such a pretend they don't
[41:59] work with people the church so they can
[42:00] come to church and act like everything's
[42:01] okay I'm sorry that kind of
[42:03] doesn't even have the understanding to
[42:05] know that a Christian should be pure of
[42:07] that before they even step into an
[42:09] office so it's not we're not just
[42:12] talking about sisters we're talking
[42:13] about brothers too that don't live the
[42:15] life shame on that kind of behavior I've
[42:19] seen it was actually with more with
[42:20] brothers and I have sisters mercy
[42:22] brother Ram said he had a temper okay so
[42:24] this is some temperance in a temper
[42:27] before he was born again he lacked
[42:29] patience and temperance he said one way
[42:31] he knew he was born again because he
[42:33] finally overcame his temper all right
[42:35] then I showed the children this once you
[42:37] get up here justification sanctification
[42:39] then you get this armor of God brother
[42:42] Ram said and then the fruits of the
[42:44] spirit start flowing out of your life
[42:46] and then we close by showing this we're
[42:50] given a measure of faith or a portion
[42:52] everybody has a portion like you got a
[42:53] portion of an orange you have a portion
[42:56] of Apple you have a portion of cottage
[42:58] cheese whatever is on your you know
[43:00] lunch you have a portion just like faith
[43:02] you have a portion of that but Peter
[43:04] says we can pray to for God to add these
[43:07] to our lives and the disciples said Lord
[43:09] increase our faith that was our text
[43:11] they had faith already but they wanted
[43:13] more faith Eamon that's me tonight Lord
[43:15] I want more faith I want more love I
[43:18] want more power more of you because we
[43:21] grow from glory to glory faith to faith
[43:24] Jarius said lord I believe help my
[43:26] unbelief he already believed but he
[43:28] wanted to believe all you want to leave
[43:29] with everything and also shows you a
[43:31] little bit of fear so he's saying in
[43:33] other words lord give me perfect love
[43:35] because perfect love will cast out my
[43:37] little bit of fear that's what he was
[43:39] saying
[43:40] give me perfect love so that love will
[43:42] cast out all fear and guess what Jesus
[43:44] did
[43:45] Amen and then ask God and he'll add the
[43:48] virtues to you because Jesus had asked
[43:50] anything and I'll do it
[43:51] okay now I'm just gonna keep Malachi
[43:54] just give me a moment I'm sorry let me
[43:57] do this I'm gonna unplug and put this
[44:01] back up here in just a minute I want
[44:02] that statue to remain up there because I
[44:04] think it's a good it's a good visual for
[44:07] us as we start preaching these I'm gonna
[44:08] start getting to all this new material
[44:09] hope that's okay I did like a 10 minute
[44:11] review but I think could be a blessing
[44:14] to you they should switch back over
[44:15] Malachi in just a minute here
[44:17] there we go okay praise the Lord for
[44:22] that update in just a minute but I want
[44:24] to start looking at this now and go a
[44:25] little deeper right go little deeper
[44:26] okay God you need your Bibles you know
[44:28] where it's like a big Bible study
[44:29] tonight so get out your Bibles and do
[44:31] some teaching through here okay I'm
[44:33] sorry
[44:38] I want to think I think I pulled up this
[44:41] because this gives us a long-term view
[44:43] does that give you a long-term view of
[44:45] your life that gives me church the
[44:47] honestly this is my roadmap to life one
[44:49] time in my show I remember a man wanted
[44:51] it I showed you the roadmap of finances
[44:53] I follow that roadmap brother but this
[44:55] is the roadmap for my entire life right
[44:57] here I got baptized in 2001-2002 I mean
[45:03] going up the Kings Highway ever since
[45:05] okay now you we need to ask God Lord
[45:08] where am i but let's look at the
[45:11] disciples because this is so powerful
[45:12] when you see how easily they got in the
[45:15] flesh but if we if we look at this we
[45:17] can see oh no wonder they got in the
[45:18] flesh they didn't have divine love yet
[45:20] but then we know what they did
[45:22] afterwards afterwards Church they turn
[45:24] cities upside down by the power of the
[45:27] Holy Ghost when they got the Holy Ghost
[45:29] they turn families upside down families
[45:31] got mad at him governments hate him
[45:34] government's one of them killed because
[45:35] of the power of the Holy Ghost who wants
[45:37] more the Holy Ghost amen
[45:38] I don't care where you are if you're
[45:40] here you can still get more of it amen
[45:41] because the Bible said you constantly
[45:43] need more sanctification more
[45:44] sanctification brother Branham said the
[45:47] morgue we looked at on Sunday the more
[45:50] God trusts you the more trials you have
[45:52] a man and the more God trusts you the
[45:55] more he can use you praise God look at
[45:58] John look at st. John and then of his
[46:00] life God let him go through such a hard
[46:01] trial he got abandoned on the Isle of
[46:04] Patmos but what happened out there he
[46:06] got the revelation of the book of
[46:07] Revelation that's still speaking to us
[46:09] today when the greatest hardest trial is
[46:12] a band that was serpents and and the
[46:13] poisonous poisonous snakes out on the
[46:16] Isle Patmos but it took such a trial to
[46:19] produce such a glorious book for us amen
[46:21] the book of Revelation hallelujah so
[46:25] that's my purpose for tonight is to see
[46:28] their progression now let me give a
[46:30] disclaimer I
[46:31] I don't know like how far they getting
[46:33] if they can fall off I don't know but I
[46:35] know this for sure they can have virtues
[46:37] but then they get weak in some areas
[46:39] okay because of Peter Peter had some of
[46:41] these he was doing pretty good but then
[46:43] by the end he lost all his virtue and I
[46:45] was he had left was faith after Jesus
[46:48] was crucified that's all he had left was
[46:49] faith so I don't know how the order goes
[46:52] I know things like that I don't know how
[46:54] far you can go and how much you lose but
[46:56] I know at some point we know people we
[47:00] know clearly the disciples didn't have a
[47:01] lot of understanding of things we know
[47:04] that many times I'm sorry par me okay
[47:08] got your Bibles now the disciples were
[47:12] firsthand witnesses of Jesus Christ for
[47:15] three and a half years and still they
[47:17] didn't have divine love they saw the
[47:18] greatest miracles that could ever be
[47:20] done how many believed that there could
[47:22] be no greater miracles were have said
[47:23] you cannot do a greater miracle in Jesus
[47:25] Christ because he was the fullness of
[47:27] God in a man that's exactly right three
[47:32] and a half years they never got to hear
[47:34] but in the matter of within two months
[47:36] because 50 days after the resurrection
[47:37] they received the baptism of the Holy
[47:40] Ghost so three and a half years they
[47:42] struggled in and out struggling in and
[47:43] out but then after two months of being
[47:45] consecrated and ten days of prayer they
[47:48] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[47:50] hallelujah what a what an amazing story
[47:53] God does how quickly God can change
[47:55] people's lives amen
[47:58] now let's start with this I want you I
[48:03] want to tie this thought this is outside
[48:05] the thumb but go to Matthew 5:19 I've
[48:07] been reading in the Gospels the last few
[48:09] weeks I finished I forget what book it
[48:12] was Ezekiel yeah and since then I've
[48:14] just been reading you know random places
[48:16] sometimes like to spend some time just
[48:17] jumping around the Bible being refreshed
[48:19] so I've been I've been getting refreshed
[48:21] in the in the the Gospels we're reading
[48:22] a lot in the Gospels alright so as we
[48:28] look at the Gospels let's look at
[48:30] Matthew 5:19 this thought really jumped
[48:32] out at me and I want to bring it out
[48:35] because it was all my notes I had this
[48:36] ready two days ago so let's look at this
[48:38] here Matthew 5:19 we'd love someone like
[48:43] to read that for me by God's grace but
[48:44] Adam all right thank
[48:45] sir a man thank you brother
[49:03] so how many can see that there are
[49:05] Commandments that are greater
[49:07] Commandments than others can where you
[49:09] see that all Commandments are important
[49:12] don't misunderstand me tonight every
[49:15] commandment is important in fact if you
[49:16] got the Holy Ghost the Bible said you'll
[49:18] keep you want to live by every word that
[49:20] proceeds out the mouth of God
[49:21] but I'm gonna prove to you by Jesus
[49:23] Christ's words himself I'm sorry not to
[49:25] point anybody I'm just kind of like
[49:27] point like this that's what I mean to do
[49:28] I'm gonna prove to us by Jesus Christ's
[49:32] words himself that some Commandments are
[49:34] more important than others understand
[49:36] that the same things true some sins on
[49:39] the other side some sins are worse than
[49:41] others jesus said will be more tolerable
[49:44] for the city of Sodom on the day of
[49:46] judgment than it would be for Sidon and
[49:49] what's the other tyree and Capernaum yes
[49:52] those three it'll be easier it'll be
[49:54] less of a punishment on Sodom than those
[49:57] three he imagined Jesus gonna condemn
[50:00] the people that denied his ministry more
[50:03] than the homosexuals now I hate to be
[50:05] blunt like that but can never understand
[50:07] that it's hard for me to understand that
[50:09] but uh uh in one way but another way
[50:12] Jesus was God in flesh and it turned
[50:13] down him you would have had to been in
[50:15] deep awful sin right so take that
[50:18] thought anyone who teaches even the
[50:21] least commandant whatever the smallest
[50:23] commandment what do you think the
[50:25] smallest commandment is Church any idea
[50:26] I can prove you by the Bible one of the
[50:29] least Commandments is tithing I'm gonna
[50:32] prove that prove that to you tonight the
[50:35] tithing is not the greatest commandment
[50:37] the greatest commandment is to love your
[50:39] Lord your God with all your heart soul
[50:40] mind and strength but tithing is one of
[50:43] the least of the Commandments that's why
[50:45] I don't preach on money every week like
[50:46] some churches some denomination because
[50:49] they want money money money money it's
[50:51] one of the least of the commandments let
[50:54] me prove it to you how many believe it's
[50:55] true go to Matthew 23 verse 1
[50:58] three hope I'm not shocking anybody too
[51:01] much but ma'am says get your shot proof
[51:04] vests on if you feel like I might shock
[51:06] you tonight get your shot professor I'm
[51:08] not trying to shock anybody but I just
[51:10] want to let you know before and that's
[51:12] why you know we have to go through the
[51:14] statute man to understand some of these
[51:15] are greater a greater value than others
[51:18] broadly kindnesses of a greater value
[51:20] than some of these God wants his family
[51:23] treated the right way before he lets you
[51:25] in his family right officially now he
[51:28] course the church don't get me wrong I
[51:29] know you're in his family before the
[51:31] foundation world I understand that but
[51:33] in the in the in the present time before
[51:36] he lets you join that family in the
[51:37] present with the baptism of Holy Ghost
[51:39] he wants to make sure you're gonna treat
[51:41] them the right way glory that's exactly
[51:44] right
[51:44] all right ready there Matthew 23:23
[51:47] I hope I'm not too shocked yeah I'm just
[51:49] taking the literal words of our Lord
[51:51] Jesus Christ tonight Matthew 23:23
[51:53] Malachi you wanna get that for me sir
[51:55] thank you yes anis yeah I think that's
[52:06] the closest thing I don't know we can
[52:18] say praise the Lord
[52:19] he never saying I'm not trying to be
[52:21] smart out I'm not trying to anything but
[52:22] can you understand from this Jesus is
[52:24] saying clearly they spent way too much
[52:27] time on tithing at their church praise
[52:32] the Lord he said you tithe on every
[52:35] little tiny ounce that we'd say every
[52:39] little milliliter you make sure you said
[52:41] these Pharisees they make sure they tied
[52:43] on every little thing but then they omit
[52:46] or do away with the way to your partners
[52:48] or parts of the law matters of the law
[52:50] which are mercy judgment and faith was
[52:54] that it was that mercy judgment what's
[52:55] the other one
[52:56] mercy judgment was it faith yes mercy
[52:59] and judgment and faith so what did Jesus
[53:03] say did you say don't tithe no he said
[53:05] you ought to did the tithing but you
[53:08] should not have left out the more
[53:09] important commands either and what did
[53:12] Jesus say brother
[53:12] he said if anybody teaches them not to
[53:14] the least of my commandments they'll be
[53:16] kind of lease in the kingdom of heaven
[53:18] oh it's okay if you don't pay ties or
[53:21] pay offerings if I would teach that I
[53:24] would be least in the kingdom of heaven
[53:25] but I want you to know tithing is one of
[53:28] the least of the commandments and the
[53:29] church said amen that might be shocking
[53:32] to you but that is not one of the
[53:34] greatest Commandments if you're born
[53:36] again the Holy Ghost you'll do those
[53:38] things we know that but let me tell you
[53:40] that as the Pharisees tithes on every
[53:43] little thing but they didn't have mercy
[53:48] they didn't have judgment and didn't
[53:51] have faith like they ought to let me
[53:53] give you an example they did not show
[53:56] mercy upon the woman caught in adultery
[53:59] because jesus said let let he who of you
[54:03] that have not sinned cast the first on
[54:05] what they all do they all dropped it
[54:07] right they were being too rough on the
[54:10] woman caught in adultery because why
[54:11] they were living in spiritual adultery
[54:14] creeds of men they created their own
[54:16] traditions of men and judgment they
[54:18] judge the situation wrong they should
[54:20] have judged and had mercy upon this
[54:22] woman but they judged the wrong way so
[54:24] how you judge others and how you have
[54:26] mercy on others is a big reflection one
[54:28] of the greatest Commandments and the
[54:30] church said that's not my words brothers
[54:32] sisters
[54:32] that's red-letter words let me give you
[54:35] one for faith I'm sorry let me give you
[54:37] another one for mercy
[54:38] the Pharisees got upset when Jesus said
[54:41] he was going to heal on the Sabbath look
[54:43] how they were lacking mercy they said oh
[54:46] you can't heal on the Sabbath this is a
[54:47] no working day but for God for God
[54:51] americo's our work it's His grace it's
[54:55] his hand of grace and so they judged
[54:57] Jesus as you're wrong oh we can't have
[54:59] mercy we can't let him work on the
[55:00] Sabbath and the whole time God is trying
[55:03] to heal people but they won't have mercy
[55:05] and judgment I'd say God help us have
[55:07] mercy and judgment amen
[55:09] I'm not saying don't pay tithes and
[55:11] offerings I'm saying do that I'm saying
[55:13] don't leave the others undone but I'm
[55:15] saying let's have the ones that are most
[55:17] important let's make sure we do all the
[55:18] Word of God and faith I couldn't think
[55:22] of a time when they should have had more
[55:23] faith other than you know believe it
[55:24] they should have got baptized with John
[55:25] the Baptist
[55:26] they should have done that at least
[55:28] right and they should have faith in
[55:30] Jesus Christ we know that but I thought
[55:32] were those helpful examples the woman
[55:34] called adultery no mercy they judged it
[55:36] wrong healing on the Sabbath they judged
[55:38] it wrong God wants to set people free he
[55:41] wants to do it today praise God he was
[55:43] to set people free today if they'll just
[55:45] believe His commandments so can you see
[55:48] that I could put a I could put a chart
[55:50] up here and I'd put mercy judgment and
[55:52] faith way at the top of important
[55:54] Commandments and guess what I put at the
[55:55] bottom tithes and offerings but I don't
[55:58] want you to know we don't want to rob
[56:00] from God either praise the Lord that's
[56:02] an awful sin but but robbing from God
[56:05] money is not even as close as bad as
[56:07] murdering a woman who deserves mercy oh
[56:10] you ever understand that they were gonna
[56:13] murder this woman and throw stones and
[56:14] then get jesus's permission to do it
[56:16] shame on them you see that you
[56:18] understand that does that help you by
[56:20] God's grace I thought that was beautiful
[56:22] that just made me just my like and
[56:24] there's golden nuggets in the New
[56:25] Testament - not just the Old Testament
[56:27] amen
[56:29] all right now let's get started here
[56:30] we're gonna go through these virtues and
[56:32] we're gonna show you examples maybe
[56:34] never seen or maybe you have seen but
[56:36] we're gonna bring to light how the
[56:37] disciples needed sanctification I got 35
[56:40] minutes to do it probably plenty time
[56:41] here alright let's look at faith now we
[56:47] already went over one example where
[56:48] Jesus said your faith would fail not all
[56:52] right go to Matthew 16 let's go to
[56:56] Matthew 16 we should have our Bibles
[56:57] here hopefully got your Bibles if you do
[56:59] if not we can all just read them I want
[57:07] to look at to read two important pastors
[57:10] Matthew 16:13 these are very familiar
[57:12] but I want you to see this Matthew 16:13
[57:16] I want you to see the importance of
[57:19] faith what a brother am say faith was he
[57:22] said it was the foundation if your
[57:25] foundation is good guess what your
[57:27] building is going to be all right in the
[57:28] storm you the Bible said you're gonna
[57:31] get beat up by the winds and the waves
[57:33] but you're still gonna stand Amen
[57:35] because you're on the right foundation
[57:38] and this is a beautiful point to prove
[57:40] even though Peter made a fool of himself
[57:42] just like we do sometimes and the church
[57:44] said we make fool of ourselves sometimes
[57:47] even though we did sometimes his
[57:49] foundation never failed why cuz his
[57:51] foundation was faith in Jesus Christ as
[57:54] the Son of God
[57:55] hey man and that is a revelation but
[57:58] amen
[57:58] that the gates of hell could not prevail
[58:00] against a man Haven just shared her
[58:03] faith in that recently Haven said I've
[58:04] got faith in Jesus Christ in the Son of
[58:06] God well guess what that foundation will
[58:08] never fail her because that's a true
[58:09] revelation of God's Word amen and Church
[58:13] has never failed me since 2002 praise
[58:15] God I never want to walk away sometimes
[58:17] I want to quit preaching or sometimes I
[58:19] want to quit doing all that I do but I
[58:20] never want to quit Jesus because I get
[58:23] tired and you know how we all do we all
[58:24] battle I've heard about Donny Reagan say
[58:26] he said he said I probably sign for my
[58:28] church 200 times but then when I get to
[58:30] the pulpit the Holy Spirit says no you
[58:32] need to stay on and love these people
[58:34] because we're all human
[58:37] are you with me Church we all go through
[58:40] you know mind battles we go through
[58:42] tough times but God delivers us from
[58:44] every one of them just hang with him
[58:47] hang with Christ right let him hang on
[58:49] to you in other words he'll refresh you
[58:51] praise God just stay with the Lord Jesus
[58:53] Matthew 16:13 all right when Jesus came
[58:58] in the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[58:59] asked his disciples saying who do men
[59:01] say that I the Son of Man am and they
[59:03] said some say oh they're out John the
[59:04] Baptist some say eliza's others say
[59:06] Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he
[59:08] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[59:10] am and Peter and Simon Peter answered
[59:13] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[59:16] the Living God that's why I asked haven
[59:19] when he was she when she was baptized I
[59:20] said do you believe Jesus Christ is the
[59:22] son of the Living God and she said yes
[59:25] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[59:28] that and blessed are you haven for you
[59:31] believe that Jesus Christ is the son of
[59:33] the Living God I'm just using her for
[59:34] example to encourage your praise God
[59:37] amen
[59:39] Jesus said blessed art thou simon
[59:41] barjona for flesh and blood and not
[59:43] revealed in verse 17 but my father which
[59:45] is in heaven I also say to me that thou
[59:47] art Peter upon this rock I'll build my
[59:49] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[59:51] prevail against it Jesus's church is
[59:53] built upon
[59:54] the foundation of faith how many can see
[59:56] that by God's grace so hold everyone in
[59:58] the everyone in the body of Christ is
[1:00:00] built upon faith that Jesus is the Son
[1:00:03] of God and if he's a son of God he's a
[1:00:05] part of God amen he's one with God amen
[1:00:08] he's manifesting God in fact that Jesus
[1:00:10] said the son is the only one who can
[1:00:12] reveal the father amen hallelujah so
[1:00:15] when you know Jesus Christ is the son
[1:00:17] Living God then the father has been
[1:00:18] revealed to you praise God amen now go
[1:00:23] to john 6:66 this anchor of faith this
[1:00:28] foundation of faith always held in the
[1:00:31] midst of the trials and we know of
[1:00:35] course as we already talked about we
[1:00:36] know it held on the night of Jesus's
[1:00:38] arrest even though he fled even though
[1:00:40] denied him he never went back into the
[1:00:42] world right of course he went back
[1:00:44] fishing but he never he never left
[1:00:46] Christ right he went back to his old job
[1:00:49] he stopped preaching for a little while
[1:00:50] but he never left Christ amen hallelujah
[1:00:55] john 6:66 we're familiar with this this
[1:00:58] is the mark of the beast scripture 666
[1:01:01] my Bible says this from that time many
[1:01:05] of his disciples went back and walked
[1:01:07] with him no more they couldn't walk with
[1:01:08] the word of the hour the message of the
[1:01:09] hour
[1:01:10] then said Jesus under the twelve will
[1:01:12] you go also go away then Simon Peter
[1:01:15] answered and said Lord to whom shall we
[1:01:17] go thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:01:19] and we believe in our sure that thou art
[1:01:21] the Christ the Son of the Living God now
[1:01:25] remember this is the chapter where Jesus
[1:01:26] said you must drink of my blood and eat
[1:01:29] my flesh and he never explained it all
[1:01:38] the other ones are saying he's a
[1:01:39] cannibal and you're gonna follow him
[1:01:42] you're a cannibal and Peter's like I
[1:01:45] don't know all I know is he's got the
[1:01:47] words to turn alive where´s am I gonna
[1:01:49] go
[1:01:49] who else preaches like this guy whoever
[1:01:52] does miracles like this man
[1:01:54] what other prophet does America's
[1:01:55] weather prophet as a pillar fire above
[1:01:57] his head amen
[1:01:58] one of the prophets said thus saith the
[1:01:59] Lord amen whether God changed your life
[1:02:02] from sinner to Saint amen
[1:02:03] change my life what other God could do
[1:02:06] that only the Word of God for this hour
[1:02:08] it's exactly right now look at the next
[1:02:11] verse 70 G's answer said have not chosen
[1:02:13] you twelve and yet one of you is a devil
[1:02:16] so Peter just assumes well Judas is a
[1:02:17] believer you know because he hadn't you
[1:02:19] know he's been hiding that sin for a
[1:02:20] while and this proves Church a person
[1:02:23] without the Holy Ghost might not pick up
[1:02:24] on a serpent seed right now I'm not
[1:02:27] saying a person with the Holy Ghost will
[1:02:29] pick up on it but what I'm saying a
[1:02:30] person with the Holy Ghost will serve
[1:02:32] Jesus all the days of his life and he
[1:02:34] won't sell out the end like Judas did
[1:02:36] and the church said that's right Judas
[1:02:40] sold about it somebody said I would
[1:02:41] rather have money than I'll get back
[1:02:43] with him later on I'd rather have money
[1:02:44] and he crossed the line between mercy
[1:02:46] and judgment it's exactly right but one
[1:02:49] person with the Holy Ghost they'll
[1:02:51] eventually stay with the word and come
[1:02:52] back to the word amen
[1:02:54] now verse 71 he spake of Judas Iscariot
[1:02:58] the son of Simon for he it was that
[1:03:00] should betray him being one of the
[1:03:01] twelve so we're still on faith so Peters
[1:03:05] fell I'm sorry Peters faith held rather
[1:03:08] it held even when he couldn't understand
[1:03:11] the preaching it held even when he
[1:03:14] bitterly failed Jesus even though even
[1:03:16] though he stopped preaching he never
[1:03:18] went into sin he never cheated on his
[1:03:19] wife and married again and all these
[1:03:21] things like that he just went back to
[1:03:22] fishing are you with me Church he just
[1:03:24] went back to fishing but God had a plan
[1:03:27] and pretty soon Jesus asked him do you
[1:03:29] love me three times what'd he say
[1:03:31] feed my sheep in other words if you love
[1:03:33] me start preaching if you love me start
[1:03:37] teaching others my doctrine praise God
[1:03:40] is that what Jesus said your love for me
[1:03:42] Peter will be demonstrated by you
[1:03:44] feeding the Lambs my word
[1:03:48] let me say tonight Jesus let me just
[1:03:50] make a public confession that's one way
[1:03:52] you know I love Jesus is that I'll feed
[1:03:54] his lambs amen
[1:03:56] Alleluia so will you if you're a parent
[1:03:59] you'll feed your children the Word of
[1:04:00] God here we go it's your turn buddy feed
[1:04:03] your children teacher and the Word of
[1:04:05] God trainer up all the days of our life
[1:04:06] feed our the Word of God that's your
[1:04:09] duty sir and Jesus just will see Jesus
[1:04:11] love by how he does that amen
[1:04:13] I don't believe that that's right
[1:04:17] oh I feel good tonight you feel good
[1:04:18] tonight amen go to Luke seven nine let's
[1:04:21] look at this another one on faith it's
[1:04:22] the last one on faith I just want you to
[1:04:24] show this I'm sorry I just want to show
[1:04:26] you this so you can see this and be
[1:04:27] reminded of these important things Luke
[1:04:30] seven nine how about somebody new cos
[1:04:32] somebody new read that Lydia I'm sorry
[1:04:34] amen he read that Luke seven nine did
[1:04:48] you catch that he said this to all the
[1:04:50] people that followed him Church his
[1:04:53] disciples are standing right there
[1:04:54] there's women that found him and they
[1:04:56] kept the money Mary Magdalene was one of
[1:04:58] them praise God there's other other
[1:05:01] people over here and Jesus stop says
[1:05:02] wait a minute
[1:05:03] Church listen this man this Roman
[1:05:07] centurion has greater faith than all of
[1:05:11] my followers talk about a rebuke right
[1:05:15] all his disciples are standing there
[1:05:17] there's Peter James John he turns around
[1:05:20] and said I have not found faith like
[1:05:22] this in all of Israel and brother Graham
[1:05:25] said that's the Gentile way to do it is
[1:05:27] just hear the word of God and believe it
[1:05:30] god help us to have that Amen that we
[1:05:33] can come to church some Wednesday night
[1:05:35] or some Sunday morning or some Sunday
[1:05:37] night and the preacher will say
[1:05:38] something or you'll talk to his sister
[1:05:40] after church and they'll speak God's
[1:05:41] Word right to you and you'll say that's
[1:05:43] nothing but the truth and it'll come to
[1:05:45] pass in your life god help us have
[1:05:47] Gentile faith like that have you seen it
[1:05:50] I've seen it praise God cam seen it all
[1:05:51] these brothers because give testimonies
[1:05:53] of times they spoken the word and it's
[1:05:55] come to pass literally that's Gentile
[1:05:59] faith speak the word and I'll believe it
[1:06:01] it's exactly right so see Jesus shows
[1:06:05] this man this Roman centurion had
[1:06:07] greater faith than all the disciples so
[1:06:09] even in faith there's measures of faith
[1:06:11] some people have more faith than others
[1:06:13] and then we get into gifts and callings
[1:06:15] but I'm not gonna look at that tonight
[1:06:16] all right everybody ready for virtue
[1:06:17] let's go to virtue here I got one two
[1:06:20] three four examples are to use the
[1:06:23] modern-day examples of a brother who's
[1:06:25] in a he's in a maybe a preacher or
[1:06:27] deacon or song leader and yet he goes to
[1:06:29] so
[1:06:30] work and lies and cheats and and cusses
[1:06:32] and swears listen to rock and roll music
[1:06:33] and flirt with women I've seen that to
[1:06:36] people and officers caught flirting with
[1:06:38] women these things should not be so
[1:06:40] church and the church said should not be
[1:06:43] so but see how people can hide in their
[1:06:45] sin
[1:06:45] see how sin likes to hide sin see how a
[1:06:47] sin doesn't like to be exposed I don't
[1:06:52] care how many big services I have as far
[1:06:54] as miracles I just want to see the
[1:06:56] miracle of somebody repenting from their
[1:06:57] sins because that could potentially did
[1:07:01] you hear me hope you heard me I said
[1:07:03] that could potentially be greater than
[1:07:05] somebody getting healed it from their
[1:07:06] body of the bodily sickness right
[1:07:09] because that person may get sick again
[1:07:11] but if this person repents of their sin
[1:07:14] and they overcome it the rest of their
[1:07:16] lives and the Bible says you saved that
[1:07:18] soul from a multitude of sin amen I
[1:07:21] preached in 2012 in Guyana I preached
[1:07:25] the rapture in the family and I was I
[1:07:27] was stirred up for the bang I walked in
[1:07:30] there I was praying and fasting all day
[1:07:31] I felt so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:33] I thought hallelujah I'm gonna preaching
[1:07:35] and it was the quietest service I ever
[1:07:38] preached in my entire life
[1:07:40] and brother bang I left honestly and I
[1:07:43] felt like this I might not look like
[1:07:45] this but this is how I felt no one came
[1:07:47] up for prayer and I felt so discouraged
[1:07:51] the next day I got some of the biggest
[1:07:54] rebukes from the people that were in the
[1:07:56] church they said brother Jesse cuz after
[1:07:59] brother Brooks preached the final
[1:08:00] message they had he said let's give
[1:08:02] testimonies and there's about five or
[1:08:04] six women that came up and said last
[1:08:05] night service spoke to all of our hearts
[1:08:07] we stayed up all night talking
[1:08:08] confessing all of our sins and one of
[1:08:11] those women said I confess my abortion
[1:08:13] to my husband can you imagine that
[1:08:18] murdering spirit was laying in that
[1:08:20] woman's soul for our mind all those
[1:08:22] years and then it took us some nobody
[1:08:24] preacher to come around and expose that
[1:08:29] demon to confess that and now she's
[1:08:33] finally free by the grace of God she
[1:08:36] could have went to her grave with that
[1:08:37] church but she confessed it and great
[1:08:40] healing was was had that day
[1:08:43] and the woman one of the older women
[1:08:44] kind of rebuked me she said brother
[1:08:45] Jesse don't feel bad
[1:08:47] you shouldn't feel bad when that happens
[1:08:49] she said when we're quiet that means
[1:08:50] we're really getting cut and I kind of
[1:08:52] bowed my head said yes sister
[1:08:54] I'll take that rebuke and it really
[1:08:58] taught me a good lesson and then the one
[1:09:01] of the pastor's daughters came up and
[1:09:02] she wept and cried right there holding
[1:09:04] the mic I'll never forget it and she
[1:09:07] said I have been so disobedient to my
[1:09:09] parents I've broke all their rules and
[1:09:11] she wept and cried and I'm friends with
[1:09:13] her on Facebook she got married she got
[1:09:14] a little baby by God's grace the
[1:09:16] pastor's so happy pastor Cass tonight's
[1:09:18] his name-o Church I tell you that's what
[1:09:21] Satan hates Satan hates to be exposed
[1:09:23] people can go to special meetings I love
[1:09:24] to go to special meetings you guys just
[1:09:25] went to special meetings you go to
[1:09:26] special meetings or just regular
[1:09:28] meetings but if that devil lays there
[1:09:30] what good did it do the person's got to
[1:09:32] open their heart and expose Satan clean
[1:09:34] those flus out so the Holy Ghost can
[1:09:36] flow in amen that's what we need the
[1:09:39] Holy Ghost to expose sinan people's
[1:09:42] lives amen and to me like I said that
[1:09:44] may be greater confessing abortion and
[1:09:48] rebellion as a teenager that may be
[1:09:50] greater than if somebody got healed of a
[1:09:51] cancer because they might get it back
[1:09:53] I'm not I'm not I'm not downsized
[1:09:55] downplaying cancer healing I'm not
[1:09:57] downplaying that but I'm saying let's
[1:09:59] let the will of God be done
[1:10:00] amen glorious modern-day examples I
[1:10:05] talked about those women and and their
[1:10:07] standards oh another one my brother
[1:10:10] recently talked to me and he said it
[1:10:13] grieved his heart he said he went to
[1:10:14] Cedar Point and he saw one of the oldest
[1:10:17] faithful sisters in the church wearing
[1:10:18] shorts and pants at Cedar Point and this
[1:10:21] woman plays I'm not gonna say which but
[1:10:25] she plays the instrument and a real old
[1:10:26] faithful woman can you imagine someone
[1:10:31] as a leader in the church and let me say
[1:10:33] like this I've seen well I bet I'll say
[1:10:35] that I'm not gonna go there I don't give
[1:10:37] too much but I'm letting you know you
[1:10:39] need to know modern-day examples because
[1:10:42] this one happens many times people will
[1:10:43] live the life in front of you live the
[1:10:45] life of the Minnesotans pretend the life
[1:10:47] but then when they go on vacation or
[1:10:49] then when they're behind closed doors
[1:10:50] they don't live the life we need people
[1:10:52] that will live it no matter where they
[1:10:53] are because that means it's genuine
[1:10:56] it's a real conviction so here's a well
[1:11:00] respected elderly woman a woman whose
[1:11:03] gali got the longest hair maybe in the
[1:11:04] church I don't know how to check I
[1:11:06] didn't check I'm just making an
[1:11:07] exaggeration so you know I don't care
[1:11:10] what they play on the outside or what
[1:11:12] they do at church that's good I'm
[1:11:13] appreciating that but if you don't live
[1:11:15] it at home it's not even genuine and
[1:11:17] there she is can you imagine a woman the
[1:11:19] message raised the message her parents
[1:11:21] go the message church they all go to
[1:11:22] church together and she's walking around
[1:11:24] in shorts and culottes not Church that
[1:11:29] shows to me I could be wrong but that
[1:11:31] shows this person doesn't have the
[1:11:32] knowledge of cross-dressing
[1:11:33] that means she thinks it's okay for
[1:11:35] Bruce Jenner to wear a woman's garment
[1:11:37] and say I'm Caitlyn Jenner and God put a
[1:11:41] female spirit on me that's what she's
[1:11:42] really saying and you prove it different
[1:11:46] by this you prove it they're different
[1:11:47] by history because God said it's
[1:11:49] abomination for a man to put on a
[1:11:50] woman's garment whenever their garments
[1:11:53] were well fast forward to our day any
[1:11:55] culture whenever the culture is there
[1:11:56] should be men's garments and women's
[1:11:58] garments it's not always skirts and
[1:11:59] pants it's but in our in our culture
[1:12:02] that is the real that's the real
[1:12:04] difference if you don't believe that
[1:12:06] look on the restroom side a woman's got
[1:12:09] a skirt on man's got pants on and
[1:12:14] someone so long in the message done such
[1:12:16] great things and let me say like this
[1:12:17] seeing beautiful song specials I don't
[1:12:20] care how do I don't care how much people
[1:12:22] cry if they don't live it outside of
[1:12:24] there they never really got they never
[1:12:25] got the goods Church they never got
[1:12:28] sealed because their Carver that inner
[1:12:30] train car it can't be sealed because
[1:12:32] things are packed down we got to have
[1:12:33] these troops pack down amen
[1:12:35] where I'm going to keep this word no
[1:12:37] matter who's around because I know Jesus
[1:12:39] is always around amen hallelujah but see
[1:12:45] this is the kind of lies people are
[1:12:46] living and saying their fill with the
[1:12:48] Holy Ghost that your sins will find you
[1:12:50] out but let me say like this your
[1:12:52] righteousness will find you out too
[1:12:54] jesus said if you pray in the closet he
[1:12:56] said if you give to the poor in secret I
[1:12:57] reward you openly amen
[1:12:59] glory hallelujah I mean 19 I was gonna
[1:13:05] preach on that that was from God if it
[1:13:08] had bless somebody I didn't mean to I
[1:13:09] don't have any big
[1:13:10] my heart towards that person God knows
[1:13:13] but it grieves me to see someone who had
[1:13:16] claimed for decades now decades to
[1:13:19] believe the message and then transgress
[1:13:20] the commands of the Lord let me I might
[1:13:29] finish this I may because you might be
[1:13:31] familiar with some of these okay go to
[1:13:35] Matthew 26 35 Matthew 26:39 this is
[1:13:41] something I'd forgotten because Peter on
[1:13:44] the night of Jesus arrests remember he
[1:13:47] lost all his virtue but before he denied
[1:13:51] Christ three times he in front of all
[1:13:54] the disciples said I'm not willing just
[1:13:56] go with you I'm willing to die with you
[1:13:58] remember that a church think about that
[1:14:01] that is such amazing statement like
[1:14:04] Peter at one point he was so stirred up
[1:14:06] he said I'll die with you and in just a
[1:14:08] few hours he denied him three times now
[1:14:14] Church
[1:14:14] I'm not exalting any of us about Peter
[1:14:17] I'm saying I would have done the same
[1:14:18] thing
[1:14:18] without the Holy Ghost right brother may
[1:14:21] have said if you were Adam or Eve in the
[1:14:23] garden you would done the same thing
[1:14:26] because we need a Savior if we don't
[1:14:28] then we don't need a Savior because did
[1:14:30] that we didn't need a Savior but we all
[1:14:32] fall short of the glory of God that's
[1:14:34] why when I we preach on Peter I can see
[1:14:36] myself times I've fell short of the
[1:14:38] glory of God
[1:14:38] times I've act like I didn't know or
[1:14:40] times I didn't do things right see and
[1:14:42] that ought to convict us we ought to be
[1:14:44] honest with ourselves and live the right
[1:14:46] kind of life
[1:14:47] do I have the virtue a Christian should
[1:14:49] have and I live in the life a Christian
[1:14:51] should live look at Matthew 26 35 okay
[1:15:00] let's read 33 I love look at Peters bold
[1:15:02] words now look he's he's pretending
[1:15:04] brother BAM said he had a human virtue
[1:15:06] not of real Holy Ghost virtue he had a
[1:15:08] Hugh is trying to put on strength other
[1:15:10] words you trying to say look at me look
[1:15:12] at me he's trying to put it on really
[1:15:14] convinced you look at me I'll die with
[1:15:17] you tonight I want to come down to it he
[1:15:21] embarrass himself so bitterly that he
[1:15:23] wept bitterly
[1:15:24] and cried running away from Christ so I
[1:15:28] was so bitter such a bitter failure
[1:15:31] Peter answered and said unto Him though
[1:15:33] all men shall be offended because of the
[1:15:36] yet I will never be offended look at
[1:15:37] this all the other eleven will leave now
[1:15:40] that's why I'm sorry there's only ten
[1:15:41] eleven at that point all the other ten
[1:15:43] will leave but I'm right I'm with you
[1:15:44] Jesus Here I am
[1:15:48] look at verse 35 Peter said in him
[1:15:51] though I should die with thee yet will I
[1:15:53] not deny the likewise also said all the
[1:15:56] disciples can you imagine the big let me
[1:16:01] say like this just the testosterone in
[1:16:02] that room yaaay so they're big and burly
[1:16:05] and tough I'm not gonna deny him either
[1:16:07] yes James I won't deny I'm either John
[1:16:09] will you deny him no way we're all dying
[1:16:11] for you Jesus we all think we're God
[1:16:13] pretend Bert's you
[1:16:15] we all think we got virtue but it's not
[1:16:17] the real virtue I want to come down to
[1:16:21] it they all ran away Peter at least
[1:16:23] found him to the the trial but then
[1:16:26] there he couldn't stand and he couldn't
[1:16:28] stand for Christ there and even though
[1:16:30] John ran away at least he made it to the
[1:16:32] cross yep pounding their chest and say
[1:16:37] look at me I'm so strong and then you
[1:16:39] have the strength to stand up to a
[1:16:40] little girl in church now let's bring
[1:16:43] into our lives we have strength to stand
[1:16:45] up to our family tell them about the
[1:16:47] Word of God the message how about
[1:16:49] sinners out there on the streets we have
[1:16:51] the strength to tell them I'm thankful I
[1:16:53] used to be scared to say William
[1:16:54] branham's name in the last few years I
[1:16:56] got no fear I no fear I used to be
[1:17:02] ashamed to say certain things but by the
[1:17:04] grace of God and that's the my next
[1:17:06] sermon on fear I'm gonna kind of give
[1:17:07] you a preview brother Branham said God
[1:17:09] knows how to train a man he said God
[1:17:11] took Moses on the worldís
[1:17:12] for forty years and he said he beat all
[1:17:14] the fear out of him for 40 years it took
[1:17:19] to beat the fear out of him 40 years cuz
[1:17:22] he was scared he had just killed a man
[1:17:24] he knew Pharaoh's after him he knew he's
[1:17:26] gonna you thought well maybe he's gonna
[1:17:27] hunt me for forty years got to keep
[1:17:29] pounding that gold found it impound it
[1:17:33] until he beat all the dross out and then
[1:17:35] he brought him to the burning bush amen
[1:17:37] well there's my
[1:17:37] sermon for next Wednesday you just heard
[1:17:40] it in the cliff the Cliff Notes version
[1:17:43] there
[1:17:44] that's right Church that's right
[1:17:46] that's right he he had all this human
[1:17:51] virtue not the real virtue of a
[1:17:53] Christian how many want real virtue I do
[1:17:56] more than anything I want real faith
[1:17:58] real virtue knowledge all these flowing
[1:18:00] through me so I can be a real Christian
[1:18:02] hallelujah and I'm not a pretender I
[1:18:05] don't want to play Church I want to be
[1:18:08] but I said you're a powerhouse when
[1:18:09] you're capped off he said you're a
[1:18:10] spiritual powerhouse amen against what
[1:18:14] the temptations of Satan you defeat that
[1:18:17] you're a king and priest amen so they
[1:18:20] all pound their chests and say we can do
[1:18:22] this we got come to find out a few hours
[1:18:23] they didn't have what it takes
[1:18:25] next in verse well I'm gonna skip over
[1:18:29] this one
[1:18:29] but Jesus said he leaves the disciples
[1:18:32] he said come with me Peter James and
[1:18:34] John he said can you pray and watch for
[1:18:35] one hour do you have the virtue you say
[1:18:40] maybe our brother he may be he call the
[1:18:43] brothers in here he say can you pray
[1:18:44] with me one hour tonight it's gonna be a
[1:18:46] late night can you pray with me would we
[1:18:48] have the virtue to pray for one hour
[1:18:50] with the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't
[1:18:53] have it they kept falling asleep but you
[1:18:55] know Jesus was so merciful
[1:18:57] at last I remember he said the last time
[1:18:58] you said just go on and sleep he's gone
[1:19:01] and sleep take a rest
[1:19:02] whatever's gonna happen is gonna be
[1:19:04] accomplished see because the Bible said
[1:19:07] he had to walk the winepress of the
[1:19:09] fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God
[1:19:11] he had to walk alone glory he had to
[1:19:15] walk alone now looking back then we
[1:19:18] thought Lord I wish I could have prayed
[1:19:19] and that's what we say sometimes lord I
[1:19:21] wish I could have prayed a little longer
[1:19:22] lord I wish but don't Jesus won't
[1:19:24] abandon your church amen he knows he
[1:19:27] knows your spirits willing but your
[1:19:28] flesh sometimes gets weak I'm not giving
[1:19:31] you excuse to not pray at home I'm not
[1:19:32] don't don't take that from the sermon
[1:19:35] tonight you must pray more at home we
[1:19:37] read it last Wednesday I think they
[1:19:39] heard it but a man said if you want a
[1:19:41] revival you got to pray at home
[1:19:44] you got a prayer meetings at home that
[1:19:47] will bring a revival to our lives
[1:19:50] bettan Arad can't bring a revival for
[1:19:52] Akron in his pocket and say I brought
[1:19:54] your revival right well the camera got
[1:19:58] him coming out pretty soon he can't say
[1:19:59] okay I brought your revival right here
[1:20:02] it'll never happen and I think we know
[1:20:04] that by now right no matter how much
[1:20:07] expectation we say we have for a guest
[1:20:09] Minister how much faith we're having if
[1:20:11] we don't back it up with prayer it's
[1:20:13] just gonna be a regular service never
[1:20:17] understand that and I'm not doubting
[1:20:18] anything or expectation I'm not down
[1:20:20] anybody's faith or but the reality of it
[1:20:22] is we got to pray until we get the
[1:20:24] virtue because the Bible said in Jude
[1:20:26] 1:20 you build up your faith by praying
[1:20:29] in the Holy Ghost that's still how many
[1:20:31] want to be stronger in Christ God help
[1:20:33] us to pray more then it don't have to be
[1:20:35] on your knees this last week I've been
[1:20:36] so tired with Adam I from all this work
[1:20:38] you know I'm running myself to death
[1:20:40] I've only can pray at my table going my
[1:20:43] desk I read my chapter I can pray like
[1:20:44] this I've had some of the most glorious
[1:20:46] prayers and I didn't think it was
[1:20:47] possible I thought I had to get on my
[1:20:49] knees to have a great prayer
[1:20:50] I was so trained like I wouldn't be like
[1:20:52] some and I raised my hand I was so
[1:20:55] trained but this last week's few weeks
[1:20:57] have taught me I can be just as sincere
[1:20:59] sitting in my chair that's why there's
[1:21:01] no evidence well you got a shout up here
[1:21:03] we've got to speak in tongues over here
[1:21:04] it's however wherever God meets you
[1:21:06] church amen wherever you can humble
[1:21:08] yourself that's where God will meet you
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:11] remember Samuel Browning the pastor up
[1:21:13] in Sheffield got saved and got the Holy
[1:21:15] Ghost next to a dog kennel and brother
[1:21:17] Bill Sanchez's basement you know what's
[1:21:21] in dog kennels water and dog food and
[1:21:24] dog hair and that's where God filled
[1:21:28] them with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah
[1:21:29] right there where'd you get it well
[1:21:32] don't really matter where you get it as
[1:21:33] long as you get in the condition to get
[1:21:35] it ain't the next one this next one kind
[1:21:42] of combines with virtue Jesus said some
[1:21:45] demons don't go out except through
[1:21:46] prayer and fasting so see prayer and
[1:21:48] fasting brings virtue or power against
[1:21:50] demon powers does ever understand that
[1:21:53] I'm not gonna spend much time on that
[1:21:54] that's like a divine healing message I
[1:21:56] may go in that later by God's grace okay
[1:21:58] let's go to acknowledge now knowledge I
[1:22:00] got so many examples
[1:22:05] help me Jesus help me I really don't
[1:22:08] like preaching part twos but tonight I'm
[1:22:11] gonna have to do that just give me a
[1:22:16] moment here let me I got one two three
[1:22:19] four five six seven eight I have eight
[1:22:22] examples of how the disciples lacked
[1:22:24] understanding they didn't have the
[1:22:26] knowledge they needed to really have the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost I have a one example of
[1:22:32] temperance patience I got a couple
[1:22:37] examples you have two examples godliness
[1:22:42] I got two examples brotherly kindness
[1:22:46] there's a lot of really kindness because
[1:22:47] the disciple sometimes they didn't read
[1:22:48] each other really well they didn't know
[1:22:50] how to treat their brother sometimes
[1:22:51] that was art remember that's our text
[1:22:53] remember that they said you ought to
[1:22:56] forgive brother bang seven times if
[1:22:58] brother Jesse sins against you brother
[1:22:59] bang Jesus said forgive him seven times
[1:23:01] in one day and bang we looked at Jesus
[1:23:03] and creased my faith raised my faith
[1:23:07] that's gonna be hard to do because it
[1:23:09] seemed like brother Jesse had something
[1:23:10] against me if he sinned against me seven
[1:23:12] times in one day
[1:23:13] but Jesus said if he comes to you and
[1:23:15] says I repent he said forgive him and
[1:23:20] they said I need more faith than that I
[1:23:22] don't have enough faith to do that so
[1:23:24] let's be honest with ourselves right and
[1:23:26] say Lord if I'm lacking little faith I'm
[1:23:29] lacking virtue I'm lacking a these add
[1:23:33] it to my character
[1:23:34] add to my character just one more minute
[1:23:38] here let me look here I think I'm just
[1:23:40] gonna go over let's just go over
[1:23:44] brotherly kindness and I'll be done is
[1:23:45] that okay I thought I'm so blessed by
[1:23:47] this cuz I want to make sure we treat
[1:23:48] each other the right way here praise the
[1:23:50] Lord I don't a church that loves each
[1:23:51] other and can look past our faults right
[1:23:54] I want everybody to look past our faults
[1:23:56] forgive if I've sinned against you just
[1:23:58] come rebuke me tell me about it please
[1:24:00] if I've said if you sin against me I'll
[1:24:02] come I'll text you I'll email I'll talk
[1:24:03] to you something it'll come up
[1:24:04] eventually let's do that by God's grace
[1:24:07] okay where I talked about who is arguing
[1:24:09] who's the greatest that was lacking
[1:24:11] Rutley kindness next one let's take your
[1:24:13] Bibles that was Sunday okay tonight
[1:24:17] we're
[1:24:17] looked at forgiving your brother
[1:24:18] increase our faith go to Luke 9 here's
[1:24:21] there's a couple of Luke 9 Luke 9 49
[1:24:26] yeah Luke 9 49 let's do it Luke 9 49
[1:24:37] let's close I just really kinda feel
[1:24:40] compelled about brotherly kindness
[1:24:41] tonight Luke 9 49 and John answered and
[1:24:47] said master we saw one casting out
[1:24:48] Devils in thy name and we forbade him
[1:24:51] because he followeth not with us and
[1:24:55] jesus said unto him forbid him not for
[1:24:59] he that is not against us is for us
[1:25:03] brother Branham said this man whoever he
[1:25:06] was he said he was getting results
[1:25:08] my brother BAM said any man that gets
[1:25:10] results casting out Devils for the RAM
[1:25:12] said he's doing something right so the
[1:25:16] disciples got a little jealous and said
[1:25:17] oh you're not a part of our church what
[1:25:19] are they doing they're mistreating the
[1:25:20] body of Christ didn't have enough
[1:25:22] brotherly kindness to know oh
[1:25:23] everybody's got to be a part of my
[1:25:25] church that's why I don't want to hold
[1:25:27] anybody here unless God called you here
[1:25:29] if God called you here he's gonna bless
[1:25:31] you here he's gonna feed you here he's
[1:25:32] gonna let you grow here praise God like
[1:25:35] like God told Abraham you'll be a
[1:25:38] blessing ever in church and you will
[1:25:40] bless people in the church and they'll
[1:25:41] bless you that's what God told Abraham
[1:25:44] you'll be a blessing and you'll be
[1:25:45] blessed wherever God's called you but
[1:25:50] look they get so upset oh this brother
[1:25:52] he don't belong to our church you can't
[1:25:54] preach anymore well when did when did
[1:25:56] you start giving out licenses for
[1:25:58] preachers where's your fellowship car
[1:26:01] who started passing out fellowship cards
[1:26:02] around here so see it's kind of like
[1:26:07] maybe there's some jealousy in there I'm
[1:26:08] not sure but whatever it was Church they
[1:26:10] didn't have the right brotherly kindness
[1:26:11] they needed everybody see that all right
[1:26:14] go to mark 10:13 mark 10:13 this is just
[1:26:23] a beautiful thought to me I hope it's a
[1:26:25] blessing you are 10:13
[1:26:30] and they brought young children to him
[1:26:33] that he should touch them and his
[1:26:35] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:26:37] them let me just stop right there
[1:26:40] can you imagine here's the Lord Jesus
[1:26:42] Christ he's raising people from the dead
[1:26:46] he's telling the lepers that you're
[1:26:48] healed paralyzed people are walking in
[1:26:54] Jesus you know he's probably sitting
[1:26:55] down join some a meal after a long
[1:26:57] service or something and these sisters
[1:27:00] who press all their way out think about
[1:27:03] this
[1:27:03] they brought their little babies to
[1:27:05] Jesus they could be a home sewing they
[1:27:09] could be at home resting but they left
[1:27:11] all their home in their business and
[1:27:12] they took a extra extra effort to come
[1:27:14] out to church this night and these
[1:27:19] sisters they spent all day watching
[1:27:21] Jesus heal the sick they let Jesus do
[1:27:23] all the healing and now they say well
[1:27:25] can I just have a little personal
[1:27:26] interview with the Lord can I see him I
[1:27:29] have a nurse in my baby all day I didn't
[1:27:32] get to sit with the other people because
[1:27:33] my babies loud and I want to only let
[1:27:35] the people hear the preaching and here
[1:27:39] they are they just say I have a little
[1:27:41] bit time with the Lord Lord will you
[1:27:44] pray over Lily will you pray over
[1:27:46] Victoria and would you would you
[1:27:48] dedicate her to the Lord and the
[1:27:52] disciples look on that you know they're
[1:27:53] so high and mighty
[1:27:54] where were the closest to the master the
[1:27:58] Bible said they rebuke the sisters it's
[1:28:02] out the scripture said they reviewed
[1:28:04] them shame on you sisters the Masters
[1:28:08] working you think the master has time
[1:28:10] for mothers with babies oh he makes
[1:28:13] plenty of time for everybody he makes
[1:28:15] time for anybody that wants a servant
[1:28:17] praise God anybody that wants to come to
[1:28:20] Christ and hear God's word Christ will
[1:28:22] make time for them what they get so high
[1:28:25] and mighty
[1:28:26] they can't even respect their sisters
[1:28:28] like they ought to get out of here what
[1:28:31] do you mean children they're not even
[1:28:33] sick it's a healthy baby can't you see
[1:28:35] there's all these other babies over here
[1:28:36] what's wrong with you
[1:28:41] and Jesus saw it he was much displeased
[1:28:43] can you imagine Jesus getting angry
[1:28:44] picture that face angry or maybe just
[1:28:48] Stern like mother man said Stern like he
[1:28:50] would if you'd speak he'd speak one word
[1:28:52] the whole world would be burned up in
[1:28:54] fire or if he'd speak a word you just
[1:28:58] cry and just love him and hug his feet
[1:28:59] you know he said that kind of look on
[1:29:01] his face and there he gets much
[1:29:04] displeased with the disciples he said
[1:29:06] suffer the little children to come unto
[1:29:09] me and forbid them not for of such is
[1:29:12] the kingdom of God why because jesus
[1:29:16] knew there's a lot of children ought to
[1:29:17] be in heaven because they were aborted
[1:29:18] right murdered and then also he brings
[1:29:21] it down to the spiritual in the next
[1:29:23] verse verily I say unto you whosoever
[1:29:24] should not receive the kingdom of God as
[1:29:26] a little child he shall not enter
[1:29:28] therein
[1:29:29] jesus knew little children had faith in
[1:29:31] fact one of them already showed his
[1:29:32] faith because he brought his lunch to
[1:29:33] Jesus and that's the kind of faith
[1:29:36] that's in the kingdom of God amen
[1:29:38] whenever I got whatever little is I'll
[1:29:41] bring it to Christ and Christ will
[1:29:42] multiply if I'm just willing to
[1:29:44] sacrifice it for Christ
[1:29:45] we'd some more children like that with
[1:29:48] fishes and loaves they men we need some
[1:29:50] more adults like that too I'll bring
[1:29:51] whatever I got I'll just bring childlike
[1:29:53] faith
[1:29:54] I'll just put all my life in Christ's
[1:29:55] hands and I'll watch him bless my life
[1:29:57] amen
[1:29:58] I watch them bless all my little humble
[1:30:00] gifts they see make significant to be
[1:30:02] able to do any work for Christ but
[1:30:04] Christ will take that and he'll bless it
[1:30:06] a hundredfold amen glory but they refuse
[1:30:11] his sister and say no no you stay in
[1:30:13] your position you can't anytime with the
[1:30:15] master jesus said I'm much displeased
[1:30:17] with you in other words I'm not happy
[1:30:19] with you you haven't treated the body of
[1:30:22] Christ you haven't treated these sisters
[1:30:24] the way days are deserved to be treated
[1:30:25] by the way who did Jesus show himself
[1:30:27] first to after the resurrection a man or
[1:30:30] a woman a woman who had seven demons
[1:30:33] cast out of her a harlot woman were
[1:30:36] seven demons that's what we chose to
[1:30:39] show himself to because his big brawny
[1:30:42] men right they all ran in fear except
[1:30:47] for John right at the cross so Jesus
[1:30:50] said I must show myself to the sisters
[1:30:51] first and then the Bible said the
[1:30:53] sisters tell them and they still
[1:30:55] don't believe listen they were all
[1:30:57] doubting Thomases they all doubted the
[1:31:00] women he gets that we were so hard on
[1:31:04] Thomas but they were all doubting
[1:31:06] Thomases until Jesus comes in the Bible
[1:31:11] City upgraded the hardness of their
[1:31:13] heart why are you so hard-hearted you
[1:31:15] can't believe a woman's testimony it's
[1:31:17] your show they had a bad opinion of
[1:31:18] women I don't bring no children of Jesus
[1:31:21] don't bring them to Jesus and Church
[1:31:23] that's the thing we want the sisters to
[1:31:24] hear the word of God here just as me
[1:31:26] want the brothers to hear just as much
[1:31:27] as we want the children to hear we want
[1:31:29] everyone to hear God's Word that's why
[1:31:31] I'm so thankful for begging to hang up
[1:31:32] the I'm not joking I'm just thankful
[1:31:34] he'll hang up those TVs so anyone who
[1:31:36] wants to hear the word of God can hear
[1:31:38] it praise God that's what Jesus would do
[1:31:41] brother bang that's what Christ would do
[1:31:44] he would not say oh it's insignificant
[1:31:47] shouldn't spend your money you know
[1:31:49] letting the sisters you know hear the
[1:31:51] word of God how precious is the Word of
[1:31:53] God Oh she'd hear the word of God and
[1:31:58] Christ will not turn one away he said
[1:32:02] let the little children let the sisters
[1:32:04] come I'll minister to them I'm closing
[1:32:09] with this all right I must have sent my
[1:32:14] timing wrong I think I already preached
[1:32:15] the hour this says I got seven minutes
[1:32:17] left I'll take the watch you watch all
[1:32:20] right go to Matthew 20 let's close of
[1:32:22] this Matthew 20 20 verse 20 how many
[1:32:28] love the Lord tonight Church I love
[1:32:31] Jesus Christ now more than ever half I'm
[1:32:34] not perfect but I'm striving for
[1:32:36] perfection I want to live what God has
[1:32:41] revealed in this hour I want to live the
[1:32:42] message I want to live it every day I
[1:32:46] don't want to take a week off I want to
[1:32:48] take a month off I don't take a year off
[1:32:50] I want every day I want to serve him
[1:32:52] with fear of God all the days of my life
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] so somebody can see Christ in me but RAM
[1:32:59] said if you can't do anything else just
[1:33:00] win one soul to Christ
[1:33:01] that's what I want my life if all's I
[1:33:03] can do is win one soul let me win that
[1:33:06] one song and lord if I don't
[1:33:09] right now perhaps I'll seem in a few
[1:33:11] months let me be sanctified so I can win
[1:33:13] their soul when I meet them let me be
[1:33:16] sanctified so I can do it by your grace
[1:33:18] Matthew 20 verse 20 alright here's
[1:33:25] another one where they get upset with
[1:33:26] disciples for requests about positions
[1:33:30] and who has rewards and who's greater
[1:33:32] than others we'll close with this one
[1:33:36] verse 20 then came to him the mother of
[1:33:40] Zebedee's children and her sons
[1:33:42] worshiping him and desiring a certain
[1:33:44] thing of him I want you to notice Jesus
[1:33:47] never rebuked this woman I want you to
[1:33:49] notice that this this was a honest
[1:33:53] sincere desire from a mother's heart so
[1:33:58] jesus never rebukes her and I believe
[1:34:00] she asked it in total sincerity I don't
[1:34:02] believe there's anything selfish about
[1:34:03] this request I mean honestly
[1:34:07] which of you if you had children or if
[1:34:08] you have to which of you don't want your
[1:34:10] turn to grow up and be hall-of-famers of
[1:34:12] faith kind of say like that
[1:34:13] oh my Lydia and my girl is a Malachi I
[1:34:16] want them to grow up and be soul winners
[1:34:20] for Christ I want them to serve Christ
[1:34:22] better than I serve Christ that would be
[1:34:27] the greatest privilege of my life
[1:34:29] because the Bible says you have no
[1:34:32] greater joy than to see your children
[1:34:33] walk in truth there's no greater joy
[1:34:36] than that to see them serve God yet they
[1:34:40] see my heirs at home you know they see
[1:34:41] my tiredness or if I get cranky they see
[1:34:44] my bad side but I believe she asked this
[1:34:50] with the most sincere request because
[1:34:54] Christ never rebukes her like you
[1:34:56] remember he rebukes the disciples he
[1:34:58] rebukes them all the time but he never
[1:35:02] rebukes James and John's mother because
[1:35:05] I believe it wasn't sincere desire and
[1:35:10] he said to her what wilt thou now notice
[1:35:12] she had the right approach I don't like
[1:35:14] to preach a message on approach before
[1:35:17] she asked her request what'd she do
[1:35:19] worship why do we sing before we pray
[1:35:24] worship in other words like that song
[1:35:27] Lord nago sings first right children I
[1:35:29] think it says something like this before
[1:35:31] I I'll raise my hands before I do what
[1:35:36] can you help me
[1:35:39] yeah right yeah something like that
[1:35:42] before
[1:35:43] anger right before I lift my request I'm
[1:35:45] gonna lift my heart to you in other
[1:35:47] words I'm gonna tell you I loved you
[1:35:50] before I ask you because then even if
[1:35:52] you don't say yes you know that I love
[1:35:54] you even if you don't say yes I'll do
[1:35:58] this Jessie oh yes but Amen I answer
[1:36:00] this request even if you don't do it you
[1:36:03] know that I love you and that's what's
[1:36:05] most important that we love Christ with
[1:36:08] all of our heart soul mind and strength
[1:36:10] so that's the approach worship him first
[1:36:14] then wait I preached a sermon on that
[1:36:16] few years ago if I don't remember but
[1:36:17] mostly I weren't here worship first then
[1:36:21] wait on God look at look at verse 21 and
[1:36:26] she saith unto Him grant unto these my
[1:36:28] two sons may sit the one the right hand
[1:36:30] and the other on the left in my kingdom
[1:36:33] what a beautiful request for a mother
[1:36:37] Jesus I'm not asking you for a million
[1:36:39] dollars tonight oh hey man glory I'm not
[1:36:45] asking you for brand-new shoes tonight
[1:36:48] I'm not asking you for a chariot of
[1:36:50] horses I'm not asking you for material
[1:36:52] things I'm not asking you for to be more
[1:36:54] handsome I'm asking you could my
[1:36:58] children please serve you in such a way
[1:37:00] that you would place them at your right
[1:37:02] hand and your left I don't know if I
[1:37:06] could preach a better thought than that
[1:37:07] I don't know if parents we could ask a
[1:37:10] better thing than that let Malachi be
[1:37:13] such a servant of God that he could do
[1:37:15] this this this and then let Lydia and my
[1:37:17] daughter's indication Haman let them be
[1:37:19] such servants of Christ that they could
[1:37:21] do this and this and just be such
[1:37:23] faithful servants to Christ can you
[1:37:26] think of a better question for a mother
[1:37:27] to ask her Christ verse 22 but jesus
[1:37:33] answered said you know not what you
[1:37:35] asked you said you don't
[1:37:37] quite understand what you're asking for
[1:37:39] are you able to drink the cup that I
[1:37:41] shall drink of and be baptized with the
[1:37:43] baptism that I am baptized with and they
[1:37:45] say to him we are able are you willing
[1:37:48] to suffer in other words these seats are
[1:37:51] reserved for those who suffer the most
[1:37:53] because no one can suffer like Christ
[1:37:56] right no man could ever suffer like him
[1:37:58] how badly he was beaten and bruised he
[1:38:02] says okay are you sure you'd understand
[1:38:03] what you're asking for that means your
[1:38:07] sons are going to suffer like I suffered
[1:38:10] and they say yes will suffer and did
[1:38:13] John suffer yes we talked about that low
[1:38:15] early burning oil
[1:38:17] exiled from the this hometown he
[1:38:20] suffered the next scripture verse 23 and
[1:38:29] ye and he saith unto them ye shall drink
[1:38:30] indeed of my cup and be baptized with
[1:38:32] the baptism that I am baptized with but
[1:38:34] to sit on my right hand on the left is
[1:38:36] not mine to give but it shall be given
[1:38:38] to them for whom it is prepared to my
[1:38:39] father how many like that answer that's
[1:38:44] beautiful
[1:38:45] Jesus says these are given to those in
[1:38:47] other words God has every every seat
[1:38:49] predestinated all on church I'm
[1:38:52] believing I've got one seat up there
[1:38:53] even brother bang if it's the lowest
[1:38:55] seat I believe I got a seat up there
[1:38:57] God's grace I know I'm not on the right
[1:39:01] in the left but I know I got one up
[1:39:04] there praise God because I've given my
[1:39:07] life to Christ and so have you praise
[1:39:10] God look at verse 24 and when the ten
[1:39:14] heard it they were moved with joy did I
[1:39:18] read that right these ten are sitting
[1:39:22] there watching this mother come up
[1:39:23] worship him imagine there are some
[1:39:30] arguments at night and maybe some arm
[1:39:32] wrestling that night in the in the tent
[1:39:37] the Bible said they were moved with
[1:39:40] indignation that means sore displeasure
[1:39:44] you ever had a sore you ever been sore
[1:39:47] this pleasure means I'm not happy with
[1:39:49] you I have no pleasure in you
[1:39:51] I'm not happy with you at all and the
[1:39:55] asking of this question caused these ten
[1:39:59] just really get upset with these two
[1:40:02] other ones that sound like a real happy
[1:40:05] family Church to you does it sound like
[1:40:07] a it sound like a church it we should
[1:40:10] does that sound like a church we should
[1:40:11] have here
[1:40:12] no the preachers are divided against and
[1:40:15] everybody's not a preacher the sisters
[1:40:21] are divided against the brothers let me
[1:40:25] say like this tonight the Asians are
[1:40:27] divided against everybody else right you
[1:40:30] understand what I'm saying you see how
[1:40:32] that can be an issue this was one family
[1:40:36] against the others can you see that
[1:40:38] James John their mother one family
[1:40:42] against the other families oh it's the
[1:40:45] pastor's family against everybody else
[1:40:50] you see that see how easy that can be
[1:40:54] and these all proved they didn't have
[1:40:59] the right kind of love for each other
[1:41:01] how many want the right kind of love for
[1:41:03] each other let's stand to our feet I'll
[1:41:04] just stop right there by God's grace I
[1:41:06] went over about 10 minutes pardon me I
[1:41:09] hope the Word of God was a blessing to
[1:41:11] you I love these things church I love
[1:41:13] these nuggets of the word they really
[1:41:17] are to me they really are life to me
[1:41:20] because as I go along serving the Lord
[1:41:22] this is my meat my meat is the Word of
[1:41:25] God Jesus said to do the will of him
[1:41:28] that sent me to Akron of him that sent
[1:41:32] you to Akron God give me virtue tomorrow

[1:41:46] kindness I can love everybody the church
