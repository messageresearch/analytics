give you the glory may your word go forth and it's truth for your glory may be quickened by the Holy Spirit to every heart in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god best should mean see the praise go so well that's tonight Lord willing we'll look at part four if you can do switch over and we'll do some slides here I'd like to show a lot of quotes again tonight I normally don't preach a lot of quotes you know it depends what kind of message I'm preaching I guess in the revelation series I did use a lot of quotes so it kind of depends on the topic in this series of course there are a lot of quotes because I at this point I'm trying to prove the the jeffersonville side wrong and then we're winning after that we'll try to prove the other side wrong because we're right in the middle the road praise God Amen brother BAM said you should always be that way right in the middle of the road he said with enough enough warmth in your heart to be on fire be moved by the holy spirit but with using your mind enough that you just don't believe anything you nightly divide the word and you believe the truth of God's Word amen so right in the middle the road praise God so we did our memory verse our text now on Sunday we looked at a little bit more at all the biblical proof you know the requirements for a prophet we showed all the things all sorry parmi we showed all the truths here that brother Branham did as far as let me go back there all the mysteries all the revelations all the secrets that he made known praise God we know like even Paul didn't know the revelations of the book of Revelation because he wasn't alive to know about it and even John even John didn't know the thunders but my brother I'm sorry brother Graham tells us what the thunders are he says that the revelations contained in the seven seals glory so we know the truths that not even John knew praise the Lord now the question is what do we do with it amen that's all we're to do we're to live by it praise God we're to live by the revelations containing the seals right which is living by the anointing of the Holy Spirit the eagle anointing praise God that's what we're living by we're flying above denominations were flying above the world we're soaring up we're seated not on the earth were seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus trusting in the word of God now addition to all that biblical proof I showed on Sunday I just want to refresh your mind I show this a few years ago you're probably gonna remember it once I get it up here the angel told brother Branham that he would pray for kings and monarchs and you know great people Daniel repented for Israel rejecting God's prophets remember Daniel is praying in Daniel 9 6 the prophets spoke in the in thy name to the kings Daniel notice that that prophets were used to speak to great people praise God even Paul got to stand before King Agrippa great men right great men of the earth he probably wasn't the greatest man of that day but he was a great man and so the angel the Lord told brother Branham that he would pray for kings and monarchs with a seventh grade education how could a man with a seventh grade education pray for kings and rulers and monarchs it would have to be the hand of God because it wasn't his education that did it praise God and so you remember the angel visited him in 1946 I'm gonna skip past that that's just a lot of reading but just again how the angel said you'll be praying for Kings potentates monarchs all over the world praise God and so we know most notably brother Ram prayed for King George the 6th of England now the the believe the sign side says likes to say there's no proof of that and I can't produce any proof of that myself now brother Branham said he had a photostatic copy of King George thanks for the prayer but do a voice of God has yet to produce that so we just we just take the Rams weren't at that because some of these other ones were clearly made manifest so we take it at his word he prayed for king gustaf the 6 of Sweden and he said that in 1957 so the the angel said you'll pray for Kings and he said and he showed how he did but Ram said he prayed for King Farouk of Egypt he said that in 1961 he met with King Farouk at Rome then he I'm sorry then he went to Rome then he went down into Cairo Egypt so the angel was right to praise God he said he prayed for the King Saud of Saudi Arabia that was from 1953 he said he prayed for the president of Portugal he said this in 1958 obviously we know he prayed for the congressman William up Shawn that audio is on tape I played that here before you can hear it from 1951 great congressman there he I think you tried to run for president but didn't get elected that's the audio I'm gonna skip past that but you can see the pamphlet after he got healed he comes up to brother branham it's on tape and he says I'm gonna I made this pamphlet and I'm gonna send it to Joseph Stalin he even says in the early 1950s and in this letter in this pamphlet he writes a poem about the night he got healed when ern Baxter was preaching and then brother Bram came out to pray for the sick as many times that's how they did it earlier in the ministry brother Branham wasn't as as comfortable preaching publicly so he would let ern Baxter preach cuz mo Graham felt a little shy you know wasn't this confident so Hearn Baxter would preach the word and brother Graham would come out and pray and he saw a vision and he pronounced it to the congressman and the congressman was healed and it's on tape as far as him coming up later and saying I was healed and now I'm gonna send one to Joseph Stalin the White House he said I'm gonna tell my testimony everywhere he said it's on tape but you can't deny that so because we have proof for this one we we believe the other ones cuz I don't have any proof of the other ones I showed the the Cairo one I don't have any proof of these other than just brother man's word but because these are true because this is true I believe the other ones because I don't believe brother Branham would lie about that he said he prayed for the Prime Minister rather of India that was in 1954 he prayed for Vice President Nixon in 1958 and there's the picture there's brother Branham and there's Vice President Nixon and there's FF Bosworth so the angel said you're gonna be amongst great men and look what he was right there's a picture so congressman and vice president united states which it can be argued he was more powerful than all the other kings it could be argued that right politically right America was a superpower even the 50s yeah we just won world war two in the 45 and 45 was the right man in 45 Milkha yeah so we are a superpower of the world so it could be argued that they were even greater he was even greater than the other ones so don't forget that you have all the mysteries you have all the the seals the church ages all of us say the Lord's we went through all the doctrine that was all of us saith the Lord and we also have this the angel said you'll pray for great men and he did he prayed for the general and medina of Mexico in 1960 and there he's with the head of the Pentecostal Church of Sweden Louis Paris that was in 1951 he prayed for ol Roberts in 1960 or Roberts of course was a greater man more popular we'd say than brother Branham because his doctrine wasn't as was it is true wasn't as faithful it has brother Rams and so the less true your word is the more popular you'll be right no doubt he prayed for the Archbishop of India and he almost met Pope Pius but they said you have to kisses his ring and he said he said I'll call him Reverend I'll come brother he said about how I gotta kiss his ring I'm out he said I will I'll give man his respect but I will worship no man so he said instead he got the tour of the Vatican and he saw the the three-tiered crown of the Pope right roots represents purgatory heaven and earth he's Lord of all three and I think he's got it on right there well there's at least three parts to it yeah one two three there's at least three layers to that one Pope Pius the the twelfth and then of course there was other ones dr. Reid head he talks about that Sydney Smith mayor of Durban the Dean of the Lutheran College all kinds of different great men state senators all kinds of great men now is that a helpful reminder there by God's grace there's pictures it's on tape you know some of them we have actual proof audio recording I just want to refresh that that these things were not doner in the corner right we hear it all the time that's true these things were not done in the corner now I'm still on this thought of dealing with the Jeffersonville false statements I have the the script done that I'm going to share with Billy Paul and Joseph on a private video I just got to record it Lord willing I'll record it on Saturday cuz I don't to preach on Sunday and then I'll work on it next week I'll probably done by the following week because it takes me about a week to edit a video I just do 30 minutes a day you know in the morning and I want to share it with them hopefully they'll respond if not well I tried you know I try to email I tried I'll try letter I'll try video whatever I can do to try to get the people to be correct but I believe Church its idolatry to say everything brother Ram said was thus saith the Lord I believe that's an evil spirit of idolatry I don't know what those brothers have I'm not saying they got evil spirit but I am saying they're wrong and it's not the Holy Spirit that would say William Branham is infallible it's not the Holy Spirit I would say that he was infallible when he said thus saith the Lord just like every other prophet but not every word on the tape is infallible not every word is thus say at the Lord we don't have any problems with that because we know the Bible says that right the Bible says that there's no one there's no one righteous no not one praise God and the Bible said all the lips of all men are as deadly asked the Bible says every lip see that's why even Isaiah a man 800 years before Christ said a virgin shall conceive even him when he got the Friends of God he said I'm a man of unclean lips praise God see a prophet had unclean lips because we just say foolish things sometimes off but thank God there's a God of heaven there's a fire of heaven that can cleanse our lips a name and help us to say the right thing at the right time amen how can it be done only by God's grace only by the fire of God amen it won't be by our ability we have no ability of our own praise God we need the cleansing power the Holy Spirit praise God amen I have nobility in my own the only way people are blessed is if the holy the Blessed Holy Spirit will come and use my lips for his glory praise God I've no ability of my own no man does there's only one preacher that's Jesus Christ amen we just have to yield ourselves to him now I'm gonna get through these tonight Lord willing and then I'll try to get to some more on Sunday we went through the the to the two statements where Miriam confesses that he sins like he tells about sinning on tape and so we know his lies that he told his lies when he specifically lied to the IRS man and he said I make thousands of mistakes every month he said we know that those cannot be thus saith the Lord because God doesn't lie so God is not the author of lie and we but we appreciate brother Branham being honest because he's a man and we can relate if brother Graham purposely lied that we can relate purposely when we purposely make a mistake right we can relate to that we had a moment of weakness my man said with all those is meetings he said he thought his head was gonna fly off his head was spinning he said you ever any ever felt pressure like that before if you like your heads gonna spin if I get one more email if I get one more text I got one more person questioning me you're asking me well I feel like that sometimes it's cool with all those kids running around asking me this that's me I got 22 kids running around asking me questions sometimes I feel like that sometimes I might have the bad attitude right and I might purposely sin I don't mean to but I do it but I got I have a high priest who's able to make intercession for my sins amen and so brother man can make mistakes but yet be forgiven and still be a prophet because he never made a mistake with thus saith the Lord now that's that's the side believe the sign is on the Jeffersonville side they say everything's I said Lord but believe the sign we'll get to that one and there's two major ones the brown bear and the prophecy of 300,000 people those are the two ones I oughta study one more out but the other one the ones plains the see the brown bear is plain to see milligram never said thus saith the Lord I'll hang it on my wall he just said thus saith the Lord it'll be and it was brother a I saw the bear he just didn't shoot it because but he never said thus said the Lord going to shoot it he never said that so it's just a misunderstanding they see thou stay at the Lord in the quote and they they make everything they'll say that the law in the quote well any person knows you can't do that you got to make sure what the Prophet what says it right around the words you got that's what's thus saith the Lord you got to be careful what you make thus saith the Lord you have to be very careful so we looked at those and then we looked at some doctrinal statements we looked at Jesus wasn't on the throne so in the church age series momentum said Jesus was not on the throne months later and then years later he prays and says God is on the throne right now Jesus on the throne right now so we showed how is it just a doctrinal mistake he thought he saw you know the three phases of the throne from heaven to Jesus to man's heart and he was saying Jesus is no longer in heaven on the throne he's in your heart well that wasn't right it's true he's on the throne in your heart but it's also true his bodies in heaven praise God so so both of those are true he's your throne is that your heart is a throne but Jesus is still on the throne in heaven praise God his spirits in your heart your soul but his bodies in heaven and the spirits in heaven to praise God because his spear so great it can divide itself and yet it never gets any less he's just so great he's you you can't he's infinite praise God there there's no end to him praising hard he doesn't run out of spirit when he sends the Holy Spirit down he doesn't run out he's got an infinite amount praise guy so it said so see brother man I just made a mistake he probably write it in a book we don't know you know he was studying out of books a lot during that time because he was doing the research for the church ages so he probably read in a book he just taught it didn't think about it too much just like I'll make a mistake every now and then I don't mean to write but we just try to correct it later by God's grace amen now tonight when Jose and Aaron and I were there jeffersonville I asked him about the white horse rider now I hadn't studied up on it in a while cuz you know he said any questions mr. Smith and I said yeah I said how can you say everywhere program said was the state the Lord and so he goes to tell me what he thinks he said I don't really I don't I don't want to make something that's not he said I don't want to make something not thus saith Lord that is thus saith the Lord in other words he doesn't want to make any word he doesn't take away from the word and I said well sir that's why we rightly divide the word of truth that's why I believe God gave preachers the gifts to rightly divide the word and he just went on I said I said did you know bro Ram said the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit and then the seals he said it's Antichrist thus saith the Lord and he said yo you know mr. Smith he said you know I went back and listening to mighty Conqueror and it's not on the tape well he was right it's not on mighty Conqueror it's in the church age series and I forgot that brother race I didn't have nothing to say so see God let me make a mistake in that I was just like well okay after I set out to go look that up I said I'm pretty sure he said that and I went looked it up and it wasn't in mighty conquer it was in the church a series so let's read it now so you can see it now this is in December 1960 he said say I just happened to think of something here he goes to Revelation 19 Jesus comes out of heaven he's on a white horse okay we don't know that I preached that recently vesture dipped in blood his name is called the Word of God he said now what went out of his mouth what went out the horse rider notice also 7 I believe 8 when the know at 6 so see he's thinking about a white horse of Revelation 19 is oh there's a white horse in Revelation chapter 6 - now that's the end of Christ but at this point real man thought it was the Holy Spirit when the white horse went rider went forth he was given a boat at conquering to conquer and a sore went out of his mouth what was he look Capital he H the white horse rider revelation notice the sword out of his mouth course was too sharp - to edge - I'm sorry sharp two-edged sword the word so there he says at one time he says see I know that's the same horse rider of Revelation six now he says that plane more plainly in the next quote a week later one week later he says the sixth chapter deals with the white horse which was the Holy Spirit went forth conquering and to conquer now that's plain his day that's plain as day men come the pale horse death found at each one the riders the he said not after these sayings out of the great discussion destruction first went forth the Holy Ghost across the earth conquering and to conquer take your Bible Church if you got one real quick here let's go to revelation 6 verse 3 I think it is or - you verse two and I saw behold a white horse and he sat on him at a bow and a crown was given on him and he went forth conquering in to conquer so Bodrum says the White Horse writer of chapter six is the holy spirit he said the Holy Spirit went across the earth conquering and to conquer but about let's see uh one two about three years later brother Ram is preaching the seals and he says the white horse rider went out who is he's a great fella you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly what he is now look even admits he said I would have made a whole a mistake on that if it hadn't been at 12 o'clock today when the Holy Spirit came in amen oh yeah and the room and corrected me on something I was riding down to say I was taking it from old context I had nothing on it I don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing praise God see he was going to revert back to his teaching that the white horse rider of revelation 6 was that was the Holy Spirit but then the Holy Spirit came to correct the word Amen hallelujah and the Holy Spirit said I'm not that one I'm not that one he said I'm the one that comes back in revelation 19:8 in revelation 6 is an impersonator I'm the real rider 19 praise God and you remember what brother Aaron said I think I've said this before many times but programs said the reason the white horse rider of revelation 6 cannot be the Holy Spirit is because Jesus is standing there with John showing him the vision so if you have Jesus showing John the white horse rider and the white horse riders the Holy Spirit now you got two persons you got Jesus by John and you got the white horse rider now you got two persons but God's not two persons he's one person hey hey man you see that phrase god that's his proof in the seals that's the proof that he uses see he's not two persons he's one amen now look he ends the Seventh Seal sermon by saying the interpretation according to the Word of God and the vision the revelation is thus saith the Lord now you gotta understand this I think you do but I'm just gonna say it maybe for the live stream people we got two people one from New York and the other one from Missouri listening attentively because they just come in the message and people are saying programs not a profit so they're really feeding on these sermons ladies so that's part of the reason why I'm going over it but also for us to know as well by God's grace I want the children to know too because one of the brothers from another church said you know what do you couldn't tell your children when they get older and they hear some of these things I'm gonna tell him well I talked you the Word of God I showed you that program was a man but when he was preaching with the word and though it was the word it was right and we're to follow that and to reveal the secrets to God through the power of the Holy Spirit and he taught us he restored the Apostolic Faith of the fathers amen and he was right with us saith the Lord even though they want to misunderstand it they want to misinterpret it they can do whatever they want but we know it was right praise God and you right have to rightly divide what he said just like any preacher just like anybody so see not every word and the seals that that book that I'm reading at home with my family not every word in there is thus saith the Lord but he says it's a the revelation of the word is thus saith the Lord now see but people like people in Indiana the kit they can't stomach that I don't know why like I said I think it's money or popular I don't know but for some reason they can't stomach that they can't handle that I don't know why well you know I know why brother man because the Bible said strong meat belongs to those who are mature age I don't know I praise God amen that's right they can't handle the strong meat because they haven't tasted the milk praise God they haven't grown up to where they're strong enough to handle the Word of God how to get strong the Bible says you got to exercise discernment you got to judge things the right way if they misjudge a preacher their pastor if they misjudge a preacher saying every word as I said the Lord and they say Amen it shows they they're not even feasting on the milk of God's Word because even a milk baby Christian can understand brother man was not God not every word was I say the Lord he wasn't infallible that's Moke teach and that's baby teaching because our faith doesn't rest in a man faith rests in Jesus Christ hey man that's why they can't understand the meat of God's work because they haven't even ever any handled the milk well I didn't plan to say that believe that's the Holy Spirit praise God I believe that so see it's not every word because I'm going to show you a little later church remember when brother Branham said that Elisha was all bent out of shape in the cave and God had a tongue you've got 700 others that have not bowed the knee member one brother I made that mistake it was seven thousand seven thousand and not bothering each but brother man preaches it like there's seven hundred left he said he said it's kind of like there's seven hundred in jeffersonville that it's still not Bob Dinneen and everybody gets nervous there am did you mean to say only seven hundred gonna make the rapture he said Oh forgive me I mean that's a proof right there not every word in that sermon series is thus saith the lord if it is you got God making a mistake and God can't remember the numbers that he wrote if God wrote it he's gonna remember it praise God so see he even with this you have to understand he's not saying every word he's saying the revelations that were according to the word are thus saith the Lord well brother Jesse that makes it really hard well yeah then you got to pray you got to rightly divide the word you've got to meditate on the Lord you got to ask God for answers Amen you've got to study him pray you got to give yourself wholly to the Lord of God amen God doesn't want a surface level understanding he wants to go deeper the Bible said the spirit searches the deep things yea the deep things of God amen now I know I look like a fanatic preaching this but Ray but it's the truth I know because I look like an fanatic because we have such a small church and I'm yelling and screaming like I do but it don't matter cuz it's the truth anyway praise God and the proof of it is because their fruits by their fruits they're known praise God both camps both camp goes way too far and the fruits of their works prove they're wrong and the fruits of the other side that deny program prove e-r they're wrong as well because all their sinful works their lustful sinful desires that they joy now the other side they got different sins I've got to study more Annette I think a lot of it's like I said pride and popularity yeah cuz remember Jesus told that rich young ruler just one thing will keep you out of the kingdom he said I've done all this I've kept the word no adultery no murder I haven't stolen all these things he said go sell all that you have and give it to the poor and he said he walked away sorrowful one thing kept that man out of the kingdom of God and he knew he didn't have eternal life praise God now here's the one I was going to show you and this might you might want to put on your shot proof vest for this one okay but rather said the Holy Ghost was the third person of the Trinity he said it often there's probably eight to ten quotes I just think I put four up here in 1951 brother Rams he said now these are those sitting here her feeble this afternoon there's a need of physical healing and we have chosen these few words to read from nine and may the Holy Spirit the third person of the Trinity go ahead listen to it get on your Apple listen to it come in now the promise the comforter and you said you would send maybe I'll just play it right now can I just play it for you real quick so you can just to give you some proof I'm not making this up Church now the reason this one's so important is because later he says trinitarianism is thus saith the Lord it's wrong well not well now you got now if this is thus saith the lord of corn Jeffersonville he is the other person and later the Lord says he's not the third person now you got a really confused God because God saying he's the third person than God saying he's not the third person well now you've got a really cannot very smart in how because he's contradicting himself let me play it now may the Holy Spirit I just I don't really plan to do this but I just kind of had the leadership maybe I want you to hear that's the blessing of technology I found that we can use it you know to to understand these things yeah okay so I'll hold it this is what we do at home and we listen to the seven seals read from that and may the Holy Spirit the third person of the Trinity take the things of God he's praying he's praying and he's saying God may you send the third person of the towards the other to then the church that doesn't some of me because I know I know the Bible says the Godhead is a mystery and how can any man or woman know a mystery unless God reveals it hey I don't care if it's prophet or priest or anybody I don't care who it is you and I will not know any mystery unless God reveals it to a prophet praise God amen and it wasn't yet the time for the mystery to be revealed let me be honest if it wasn't for brother Graham I would be totally confused on all my doctrine I'd be the most confused preacher that ever walked the earth I probably even be a preacher could I be so confused because well a born-again or not winning when you get saved because I see it amongst my friends they go from this doctrine to that one and they're not sure here then they're just in other words they're tossed like a wave but a Christian has to anchor a mint he's anchored in heaven hallelujah his anchor rest behind the veil praise God hey man so he lives holy he lives modestly he keeps the sin out of his life he knows where he stands why cause he's anchored in heaven the Bible said well so the anchor is for your soul is the hope of God that rests behind the inner veil in heaven so I just played it for you because I want you to know I'm not making this up I'm not doctoring the quotes I'm not splicing the quotes truth surely we're not much in this world we're looked down upon but God we believe we're accepted in Christ Jesus and he and return has given us Holy Ghost we love him that great third person the Trinity who burns through our hearts and we love him o Holy Spirit I thank you for your divine leading and how you led me here to Hammond Indiana oh mercy we love the third person of the Holy Trinity that told you is gonna shock you I'm shocked every time I read this actually because I've been so hammered you know God's not three gods you know not three but that's true but program didn't know that right away until God showed it to him next one now if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever now we're 1952 and we do believe the Holy Spirit on earth today how many believes that well the Holy Spirit is the third person of God is that right the third person the Trinity Jesus Christ now he says Jesus Christ is the third person the Trinity I thought Jesus was the second person see he's just doing his best church you know did he say thou saith the Lord no he's doing the best he can sometimes he makes he slips and says things he shouldn't say 19 and 58 let him open your eyes he's the Holy Spirit the third person the Trinity here tonight to grease up your eyes with God Sal open your eyes the third person of the Trinity oh man this is this is a quite a thing Church got a big night now five months later he says the Trinity is wrong but here's the last time I found that he says it five months before the church age series now that's a beautiful thing right there because God said you need to write the the church age book to war in the nation and actually warn the world he said write the church age book for that purpose and see God wouldn't let them write that book until first he had the right revelation on the Godhead the Haiti man hallelujah he said now they're only be one difference that would keep Jesus from being the same that walks in Galilee has to be here with us tonight now remember that Jesus I'm talking about is the third person which is the Holy Spirit which is in us God in us Oh five months later the third person is wrong but man says this oh I'm sorry oh yeah yeah right okay here it is revelation of the church revelation of Jesus Christ he quotes Timothy 3:16 he says God not a third person or a prophet but God himself made manifest in human form now this is the revelation remember so now how about revelation before was these third-person Jesus Christ third person Holy Spirit three reports nice time a revelation and then a year later he says I know this is on tape don't get excited let me say this with godly love the hours approach I can't hold still these things too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus saith the Lord okay wow so we just have a complete change right a complete complete complete flip-flop now there's nothing wrong with that because you and I would have done the same thing I was a Trinitarian when I first got saved because I didn't even know what it was I just sang the songs that I called I just went along with everybody else you know he did that or whatever they do you know they just do it he's look where it come from the Nicene Council the Catholic Church come and rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned the entire book of the Bible so far as three God's that's from Hell there's one God now do you believe that all these people that Trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they're Christians see they can be saved Trinitarians can be saved now I don't have this quote up here but there's a quote from anointed ones at the end time where the RAM said if you make him second or third person he said you're lost you're lost if you make him a second or third person now see now we've got two quotes and neither am i neither of them are thus saith the Lord so which one you're gonna take so you believe the sign takes that one really hard to say look brother I'm saying every Trinitarian is lost and then the other side's like it's not saith the Lord they are lost so which one you gonna stand on I'm gonna stand on what the Bible said the Bible says Jesus will save all those who call upon the name of the Lord god amen remember Jesus grants salvation not according to the baptism at the white throne judgment he grants salvation for doing one of those six things and of course some of them will be saved because of their their confession in Christ but he gives six acts he gives them eternal life for doing six things never feeding the poor say I feeding the poor closing the poor visiting the sick I can't name all of them I could forget him after a few weeks I forget him so see Church you know you got to rightly divide the word so you got to take a stance and where do we want to stand we want to stand right with the Word of God and let me say this too we got to have grace if I'm wrong this of the church I don't want to be arrogant about it I want to be humble enough to say God if I'm wrong correct me another one I don't want to get in fights with preachers and say well well I'm right because I've got this and you're of the devil and I'll you're not you're no good I don't want to be like that I just want to like like Rison I agree with the brother a wonderful brother a pastor he's cheating he didn't see eye to eye with me on this statue River man well I said that's okay we're still brothers I mean that's okay I can't see it the other way I can't see it the way they see it how can you they say you get the Holy Ghost at faith well how can you how can you have the Holy Ghost with faith but not have virtue yet and you don't even have knowledge or temperance or godliness how can you have the Holy Ghost and not I probably kindness amen I don't see that but it's not something we're gonna argue and fight about praise God we're taking it back to the word and we're let the Holy Spirit show love it'll show brotherly kindness and meekness through us we're not going to be arrogant about it and we're gonna let the spirit of truth deal with each and every heart and reveal God's Word to them in the season when they need it praise God because church what is your life all about seasons praise God brother Aaron could only get the revelation at a certain season of his life but RAM always knew he was gonna go out west but it took the right season and the church said it's season he wrote a the West is a boy want to go out west far away the lonesome West but it had to be the right season I said like this you'll get the right revelation in the right season amen just wait upon the Lord keep believing in God keep worshiping God keep yourself humble before God make yourself meek like the meek one and he'll be able to teach you and you'll learn it in due season that's right but see Satan wants us to get all arrogant and argue against one another he wants Brandon's fighting against Brandon's right he wants us fighting each other so we'll stop fighting the devil right after the seals the Holy Ghost today is not no third person well you really got a mess because he's just a few years ago he said he is the third person if every word is the sat the Lord he said then that life that was in Christ is the Holy Spirit not the third person but the same person in the form of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a token that your life and your fare is paid you've been accepted in the beloved amen okay the next one motor that makes a clear mistake in feast of the trumpets 1963 and I'll just read you the quote so he says he said frankly from the feast of Pentecost which was remember in the third month unto the feast of atonement which was in the seventh month I'm gonna show you the picture in a minute was fifty days so brother I'm saying there's fifty days from the third month to the seventh month is that possible no cuz there's thirty days in a month and they're four months apart so four times 30 is at least 120 programs saying there's only 50 days Church he made a mistake and he admits it in a few months the next month he admits it he makes a mistake well how can that be now saith the Lord it's not he made a mistake now he and this is questions and answer like the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it's caught it right here and it's on tape and I'll probably hear from it when I was talking about the seven trumpets I said it was seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal feast from the Pentecostal feast until the trumpets there was seven Sabbath's and that was his heir seven Savas was between the feast of Passover Pentecost II which made the 50-day sea but I was referring to that I said that means the seven Church ages but man was trying to say the seventh month represent the seventh Church ages but he said it wrong so Church day if you can't look up here if he if you can Pentecost was in the third month trumpets was in the seventh month and brother man said there's only 50 days from Pentecost well this is 30 60 90 120 there's not 50 days from Pentecost to trumpets there's 120 days and he admits I made mistakes now how can that be thus saith the Lord it can't be because he says I mix it up and I love his words here oh I forgot to put those quotes on there I'm sorry let me I'll just I guess I just have to do this I don't know if I can zoom in or now I don't know if it works here or not let me just show you the quote yeah okay that's about as good as I can get but Oh skipped I don't like this app forgive me but you own us understand here okay and I says it's not seven Sabbath's no he said but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's seven months after that cut off seven months Jan your February March 7 months which represents the full seven church ages but Rams trying to say the feasts of the trumpets takes place in the seventh month which represents the end of the seven chart changes that's what he's trying to say but even here he said it a little off - yes you just got to give him grace just like you give me grace we're not making fun of brother Ram just like you want to make fun of me or any other preacher we just make mistakes this is one of them beautiful quotes you'll ever hear a prophet of God say because it shows brother branham's absolute sorry yeah just keep man it shows his absolute was the Word of God there it is right there but if you happen to catch up on your tape remember look in the Bible it's one of the most powerful statements a prophet can make I'm gonna make mistakes if I get it wrong forgive me look in your Bible praise God amen that's the proof that bro Graham's absolute was the Bible which he said it was he never said he was the absolute he even said God's absolute is the Word of God amen how can God's absolute be the word and not brother Brandon and brother for every word he said was thus saith the Lord now you've got now we have a different absolute than God if brother Branham is our absolute this message and every word on the tape if that's the absolute then we have a different absolute than God because brother Aaron said God's absolute is his word because heaven earth shall pass away but God's word will never pass away hey man that's crazy the people would believe that but they do that's why I'm preaching this and because I want you to see it because of all the chatter now church this is this the people I fellowship with there's all the chatter I got chatter on the believe the sign side who's leaving the message who's lean brother man they got chatter on the other side of a Jefferson bill and you know with our pressures by the air and things like that Jeffersonville we love him I love us to love him I still pray for him that was brothers in our church most even we love him but see we got we got both sides here and with those are spirits on both sides trying to pull us away from the true Holy Spirit praise God okay then and that's hard to say that for up to say but I'm under the anointing praise God and when I'm under the only thing you don't matter what I say I try to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit so God can say whatever he wants to say and he knows I can handle it afterwards although I might cry or get upset or frustrated or be discouraged or get get abused or get octa made fun of that's fine he knows I can put up with it because he's holding my hand anyway he promised never to leave me forsake me praise God hey man he's never left me yet amen thank God for His mercy so see Church we got all this we got all this waves moan around us but the Bible said they and I hear there's there this right there in pieces for they without the fivefold ministry the true fivefold ministry will be tossed around like a bunch of waves amen you and I are on this on a ship that's got an anchor and our anchors not going down as I already said our anchors up to heaven praise God but all the other ships all the other doctrines all the other camps outside of the original Apostolic Faith they're all getting tossed around from one belief to another from one sin to another but you and I are anchored on the rock of ages' amen our anchor is hooked into heaven and hooked right at Jesus vesture where it says the Word of God amen that's a little anchor praise God and we got to stand in the midst of all that praise the Lord and these sermons should raise your faith in God's Word and you should keep listening about the RAM like we do in our house every night except the nights were here yeah you should keep listen rub Ram but just make sure you take everything back to the word cuz that's what he said he said prove some things though he said prove all things make sure your absolute is God's word and not a man a man that's right Church now we had a wonderful brother recently preached this quote and then I had to come buy a new a correction on it which is okay I understand not all the brothers are gonna have what I think that revelation I understand they might disagree with me they might say I got the wrong revelation I expect that when I might ministers in like we have brother keep coming and brother Troy they may preach things I don't agree with but the best thing is I get to come back and correct it praise God that's I love about being a pastor I love that praise God yeah that yeah I know that you're not gonna get fed the wrong thing and start believing the wrong thing like I said on Sunday when that famous preacher preached at the camp said he said brother he I'm not making fun at all but he just said it was such bonus he said brother Jesus is in heaven Jesus is in you speak what you want well you need speaker right now now that may be God but I know for sure Jesus is still in heaven I know that the Bible says he must remain in heaven until the restitution of all things amen but yet see they take the one quote from brother Branham which he corrected later and they make it they put so much emphasis in it like God's in you basically like your God now we know we're minor creators but see with all the people around all the influence all the excitement all the enthusiasm and yet people go to those get excited come home and they backslide where are they at for church where's all their enthusiasm but see that's why I like I like the enthusiasm of the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God there's my enthusiasm you know it may struggle a little bit you know I may have a little mind battles here and there but I've anchored praise God my brother and said we live the same way every day praise God we're strong in the faith every day we got struggles but we're not back sided in all the things of the world and things like that were anchored in Christ Jesus Satan sealed out amen and the Holy Ghost is sealed in praise the Lord Amen so I just thought I'd share that's why I love being a pastor no wonder God called me to be a pastor because I love for the people to know the truth I'd love to come back and tell you what the truth is not most of time off it's true but every now and then you get little thoughts that you know I don't think are helpful to you and I want I like to correct it so program in 1957 said now you when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you have the new birth now that that's that's wrong later he corrected it when you believe on the Lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism Holy Ghost see you got the new birth when you believe you got eternal life so by man here saying the new birth is when you're saved and the baptism is when you're filled that's what he's saying because he says it later he said see but the new birth is not the baptism Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it I don't think see to my way of seeing it 19 this is 1962 this is right before the stature of a man and he even had it mixed up in the stage fervor man if you study the scriptures and the quotes now I am against organized religion I never thought there was a person believed like me to this morning I heard Charles fuller as I was going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is being born the Holy Ghost is the baptism so Romero says when you come to the altar and you get saved and you weep and cry he was saying that's the new birth but then later you got to get filled that was the baptism but we know it's all the same thing getting saved is just getting saved I I get baptized but now you got to get sanctified you haven't had the new birth yet you don't have the Holy Ghost baptism yet that's the third work of grace amen now he corrects it in 1963 after the seals in the token message when God do you though about true baptism Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and everything allows you have to admit that to be yes so it's the new birth you are born to new of the Holy Ghost holiday yeah the baptism is the new birth but yet we had a preacher not long ago preset to us so that they're not the same for all confusion so what do we have to do bring bringing of the truth and they thank the Lord for that I mean like I said like I said I'm sure I don't have everything right I'm human I make mistakes but I want to rightly divide everything and I want the Holy Spirit to correct us so we can walk in truth now the church age book is the most plain thing he's talking about when he's calling sinners down to be saved he said in other words to be born of the Spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same what is the baptism Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new burners and the church said so you can see it in the token of 63 and the church age book he's saying it's all the same thing the third work of grace is the new birth praise God in fact can I show you something real quick I'm Eva Paul I just had a thought here I just wrote I finished this chapter on Christ and use the hope of glory it's a mystery the Bible calls it a mystery you've probably known that if you've been around here long enough but you should see all the terminology for the baptism the Holy Ghost in church the beautiful thing is none of its even in the none of its even in the Old Testament now here's the thirty three works of grace I hope you can see that justification sanctification Batson oh he goes you have all three new heart new spirit my spirit from Ezekiel Jesus said get a blade a year than a full cord jesus prayed sanctify them what the night he was arrested he said sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth they walk within three deaf years brother a and he said they still need sanctified amen they'd seen miracles he'd walked on water they raised the dead all kinds of things but they weren't sanctified yet because they're arguing about who's greater like where we got a lot of got a preacher's doing that today - who's greater who's got the better revelation help us Jesus and then the Batson's only ghosts now look I went through the just a few church these are all speaking of the same thing oh when you're converted that's the Holy Ghost this is a new birth when you're in do with power from on high that's the Holy Ghost baptism when you get born again new birth that's the baptism when you receive eternal life that's the new birth when you have love or charity that's the new birth when you wave you have the spirit dwelling in you that's the Holy Ghost when you have the spirit of adoption that's the Holy Ghost can I go on when you've got the spirit of death when you have to file our dwelling and walk in you you got the new birth when you've got the seal you've got the new birth when you have Christ in you you're baptized with the Holy Ghost when your wash of regeneration and renewing as all the ghosts you're born again when your robes are washed and made white with the blood lamp you're born again amen how do you think all those phrases are not found in the Old Testament because the Bible said God hid it from the Old Testament he hid it from ages and from generations and Paul said it was hidden from all those 4,000 years but it's revealed now Christ not above you Christ not with you but Christ in you amen all these terminologies it's all one the same it's Christ in you the baptism with all he goes that new birth its Christ in you the hope of glory cleared up all that confusion now this is why I would have been I've been totally confused sister Naomi if I didn't have brother Brandon cuz he cleared it all up for me those quotes clear and all up for if not you got people say oh you can have faith on the stature and still be born again how can you be born again without the brotherly kindness how does God can let somebody in his family without brother kindness oh thank you Lord but see if you got the right revelation by the Ray charity is the Holy Ghost charity is the Holy Ghost so you got a brotherly kindness and then what comes next love or charity see when you rightly divide the right way you get the right doctrine if you don't you get the wrong doctrine you get a lot of confusion oh I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but I don't have patience yet are you are you serious you think God's gonna give somebody the Holy Ghost and you don't have patience yet but what kind of person would that be oh I got the Holy Ghost but I get mad at my husband or wife every day like I'm impatient oh come on see it clears up all the confusion all the misunderstanding but what does it take it does take the gift of the Holy Spirit to rightly divide the word that's my program said it's the most important thing of our day not to magnify the fivefold but so the fivefold ministry is fulfilled as Jesus wanted it to be glory now look at this church this is one chapter look at this I got thirty three thousand words on this one revelation I worked on this for five months on this one chapter I mean when Paul says it's was hidden from all those ages it was it was a great mystery and you can teach it you can just teach it from every angle there's just so much to be taught that's the thing ah no wonder the Bible said Jesus did so much you could write books about it and it would you wouldn't have room for it in the earth just like the Word of God it's so my dad said you could preach you said you could preach a month on just one seal never scratch the surface of it right that's true I can write 33,000 words about one mystery I don't even scratching the surface on that's true church 33,000 words now hope that's helping you now where am I on time I don't wanna get sick I need to stop here written just let me said time here I told my wife I said I forgot to set a timer give me ten more minutes what's that I meant 56 okay about an hour okay that's good now here we go let's finish with these thoughts see I feel I feel also bad like I'm getting sick and getting tired but then when the anointing gets on me I feel like I'm a new man okay now on the way home my wife will see I started to get come down again you know the kids will see me by the time I get home I'm all tired but while we're here worshiping you know we're under the anointing and we're rejoicing I'm sneezing you know at work he got already knows we're here I don't feel good I'm fine yeah he's good so about a I've said each person is three persons you know he said that do you know he said he was three persons what is it it's a slip of the tongue buh-bam said there's three people of you there's three people of you you're three people this is a night this is like a less than a month before he died he's just a slip of the tongue it's just like a you just said the wrong word he said what he means is there's three parts to you that's what he means but he says there's three people of you and then he says see you're a dual person that's two persons three people and one well what are you two or three which one are you do or try persons and this is 64c he just he means you just have three parts to you that's what he means but a church if you make this thus saith the Lord then you are two persons or three persons which one are you are you two or three or more are you more you can't make these things thus saith the Lord you got to take every word back every word of his back to the word and like he said if you find some no wonder brother have said this so much mother Rhea if I'm preaching and you catch a seed in the cherry pie spit it out why did he say that because he knew I'm a man I'll say things wrong just spit that part out and don't but don't spit out the cherries those without the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism amen don't spit out the white horse rider is the Antichrist don't spit that out you'll be all confused oh yes now look at this brother Ram said he's three persons now see just like I am three persons listen to a church if you won't listen I'll send you a PDF you this file PDF you can listen to yourself what's he saying he means he said I'm three I fulfill it what he means I fulfill three roles to my children in my wife and my grandchildren sciama I'm a I'm a husband I'm a father and I'm I'm a grandpa he doesn't mean he's three individual persons he means he threw fulfills three roles of one person but he says it wrong if he's now brother Rams main argument against the Trinity is this you cannot be a person without being a personality that's why he says God is not three persons because if he's three persons he's got three different personalities right you're a separate he said and if you're a personality you're one personality too and he just said you're a dual person see when I study I find these over the years sister Naomi all these twenty years of preaching and I just kind of store him up and say well he's a man he's a man but I never preached him to you because I I don't want you I don't feel like you had to know that but now God's not gonna allow program to get worship without calling his people out of their praise God so he's allowing all these things that happen right because it's gonna it's gonna bring the believer to the top the one who really loves the Lord and who really loves God's messenger and respects him the right way not worship him but respects him and takes everything he says back to the word I've had these lain here for almost 20 years well what I didn't know I was gonna use them but now it's time to use them and say it's helping people praise the Lord some of these people that are just coming in and wondering is he is every word I'll say the order was he a false prophet he's a genuine prophet but he's subject to make mistakes in his humanity just like you and that's why you could appreciate him more now look a month before he dies he says it right remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person he said it even wrong after that I just showed you he said it a month less than a month before he died pardon me in December before he died he said there's three people of you and then but a month before that he said you're one person but you're in a cycle of three so you know say it right I'll say it wrong go say it right let's say it wrong but that doesn't stumble us because we know what he means he's not saying thus saith the Lord you're three persons he didn't say that he's just making a mistake he's just being a man he's just being a Smith he's just being a Hernandez we make mistakes right he's just being human it's part of the human experience here's one church I literally about shuddered when I heard my man say this he said Rebecca went out to meet her bride brother ma'am he left out the word groom if you make this thus saith the Lord now you've got some real strange doctrine you got Rebecca marrying a woman or you're calling Isaac a woman which one is it it's the state the Lord I play this one over and over again I was driving the car right I was like I was like hey Siri yeah I was like remind 30 minutes I'm sorry 30 sec let me hear it again I'm like well he said Rebecca wrote it on the camel jumped off right between the house of Abraham out in the field she met her bride can you imagine Rebecca running to meet her wife my goodness well that would be homosexuality and that's not saith the Lord oh we got some real problems these Jeffersonville people if they believe that they got some real problems either they're ignorant or they got our evil spirit on them now if they're ignorant and you show them the word and they get corrected that proves they have the right heart but if you show them and they still remain in it they got a spear on they've got a demon spirit on them to believe these things what does it do it exalts a man just like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had to bow down to a man but we don't bow to any man we bow to the Lord Jesus Christ he says it and then he says the church is gonna marry a bride that's me and the church will meet our bride in the air everybody listening tonight have I shocked you too many times and now you're just like totally shocked over and you get a handle anymore now look he corrects it he said he quotes first Thessalonians 5 I'm sorry first that's what it's for there's my man mistake again we'll be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air see he just leaves out groom leaves out groom that's all I didn't because he corrects it well a year later she wrote to meet her unseen bridegroom groom now he's got it he's got it a year later he's got it now it's bride groom yeah next time somebody tells you every word he said was I said oh okay well which woman didn't Rebecca marry then right or come there still tree stumps out here if 1977 Artie came to pass and we already were supposed to have total annihilation by 77 how come we got tree stumps I'm sorry full-grown trees how come the world systems are still going on if we've got the stay at the Lord on 1977 because it wasn't the state alone that's why this was shocking to my wife on this one and I've heard it before I forgot about it but she reminded me of it brother branham said mary had the egg when Jesus was conceived and the germ came from God the crater who made it sibel Ram said it was half Mary which would have been sin nature and then half divine you see that then later he says God created the baby both egg and blood sea just made a mistake he thought Mary had a partner because he knew Jesus was fully human so at one point he thought well Mary must have gave her egg and God gave the germ then he corrects it says no God did both and then the egg wasn't Mary so he said here the egg Mary had the egg but here he said DANC wasn't married which one is it this one this one now here's one for our sister's boy this will really be a doozy here for our sisters in this servant brother Ram rebuke Jezebel and face makeup wearing about five or more times he just hammers a painted face Jezebel but look he says if you don't have any hair and you want to let some hair that's all right maybe wear one of those like look look like a human if you don't have any fingernails gonna get some fingernails don't get them like holes or navy beans and get real fingernails if you haven't got any of these things it's alright if you haven't got any teeth get you something to make you some get them but don't pull your god-given teeth out just because they're a little crooked and they're good teeth to get some don't dye your hair something like that look like something that come out of a mire somewhere don't now here's where people this is where a church in Ohio stumbled now God eventually moved the pastor out because of his false doctrine but look if you're colourless and you want to make yourself look like you got some color it's alright I might imagine but don't make yourself look like Jezebel like a barn somewhere being painted now this is an interesting quote he couldn't mean hair because he was talking about hair but a church in Ohio took this is painting the faces and the pastors are allowing the women to paint their faces that was one sign I knew that pastor was off the word another sign was that he let his children listen to rock and roll well about five years later he left a message he don't believe it he lets his girls cut their hair where show off their belly buttons and wears men's pants and all kinds of things now I know I can't explain this but all's I know is that the Bible names make up three times and condemns at all three times all three women that wore makeup Jezebel and Israel twice were condemned and then he says this he said I don't care where you have a birth it's a new birth it will make you and ball and wash all there's a rhyme squall ball all something dr. Seuss Baja and wash all that paint off your face it'll do things for you that you didn't think you do you carry on like that you never to do he said it's a mess how much makeup does the Holy Ghost take off all of it so I can't explain that quote I really even to this day I'm just a pair I'm just guessing I don't know but just like the other ones I'm just guessing I don't know why he said that I don't know why I said let's invite the third person in Trinity to come I don't know why I said that he says such a conglomeration of sin when they where painted faces shows there they're at war with God when they take it off shows they're at peace with God take it off take the makeup off he says the my brother have saw the preview of the bride how much makeup did she have on none all right let's say into our feet I've ever stopped right here I'll go all night and then I'll get sick and I don't wanna get sick I want to be healthy right like I said I got the other ones Lord willing next Wednesday but Ram said only 700 and bother knee our bodies are made up of 80 percent water and petroleum petroleum is crude oil it'll make you sick brother Ram there's times he makes it sound like when Jesus opens the seals there's no more redemption and people wondered and so they had to ask him yeah all right musicians if you'll come by God's grace praise God now can everybody see why this is important it's not you know it's not a sermon that should be boring it's not a sermon that is unnecessary it's necessary because the spirit searches all things yay the deep things of God and all these things on many of these doctrines people have taken them and gone off into sin especially that make up one especially that Jesus on the throne no more because it actually makes them God right and then we get that bride worship doctrine over in Philippines I heard about that years ago that's all I actually saw some people believe that we should worship the bride because the bride's one with Christ and see it's important to have the spirit of truth because it will direct you to the word and the word is a filter it'll filter out all the sin out of your life praise God hey mom thank the Lord yeah so none of these church none of these are new to me they might be new to you and if so may God help you to understand let me say this just be patient you don't understand something just just hang with the word it's okay to put things on the Shelf right at some point you have to bring it off the shelf and show what's right or wrong and we're not scared to do that in fact it looks like God's gonna make every word we take off the shelf every words gonna have to be proven to be the word and we're happy about that we're not scared about that grab it cuz we've got the faith of the Apostolic fathers it's being restored amen without leaning upon man we're leaning upon the Holy Spirit praise God let's just bow our heads here for a moment I appreciate you Church and I hope this was the help if you have any questions make sure you text me or email me or talk to me afterwards I'll do the very best I can like I said I'm going on the Jeffersonville side first attack that idolatry and then I'll attack that lust fear on the other side I said the program wasn't a prophet and then because that they get to throw off the Bible I don't have to be holy I'm so BAE I'll give you a free woman I can be a free man and all kinds of trash like that let's be real Holy Ghost filled Saints praise God let's believe every word let's prove all things by the word of God Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful for tonight we love you Lord we've come to this season and your Bible says a word and spoken season how sweet it is thank you Lord father baby we've wondered about these things for years I remember Jose told me on Sunday he'd wondered about that question for 20 years and the Holy Spirit answered just last Sunday thank you Lord you're rich in mercy Lord you're gracious and you do everything according to your glory your season for purpose Lord we love you tonight nor let our confidence raise in the holy spirit that it raised in the Word of God then we keep listening your prophet and take every word back to the tapes and let the let us learn to discern by the power of the Holy Spirit let us grow in judgment grow in discernment Lord growing understanding for your wheel Lord God for your glory bless your people here tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said anyone needs prayer more than welcome to come let's pray that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you all want to sing that one because it's pardon for sin how many pardon for their sins at times we make mistakes we'll say the wrong thing will get upset will lie will mistreat somebody but there's parted for sin and the peace that endureth praise God and there's there's part for both man there's pardon for Martin Luther there's pardon for you and I praise God hey man thank God for His mercy see these sermons that whether they do they don't make me more confused they ground me more in God's Word and they teach me with everything if there's a question always go back to the word they constantly remind me to rely upon the word jesus said if he got the Holy Spirit he'll remind you of me the Holy Spirit will always speak of me that's how we know who's got the Holy Ghost and who doesn't praise God because the you as the Holy Ghost is guided to all truth that's close the night here I like I said I gotta get some rest Americans I want to get sick here praise God Lord tonight we love you we thank you we made the sacrifice of praise Lord God we worshiped we prayed for the sick we prayed for those struggling we pray for those hurting we preach your word we've proved all things like you told us to do didn't say prove some things Lord you told us to prove all things we tried to rightly divide the word by the Holy Spirit's leadership thank you Lord Lord your spirit keeps us from going overboard keeps us from going into idolatry keeps us from going into lust of the world keeps us on the straight and narrow so we thank you Lord bless us now Lord tonight lord I just pray these servants would not cause us to doubt they're not cause us to question or to Lord to to have any evil thoughts but Lord what they'll do is give us more confidence than what we believed all these years and remind us to always go back to the Word of God and to believe your prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord thank you lord what a mess we'd be in without you're sending your prophet Lord to reveal the secrets Lord God to roar like a lion in this generation you're gone to wake us up Lord amen that midnight cry Lord to wake us up trim our lamps and get the fire burning for Jesus as we want to go out to meet our bridegroom thank you lord thank you for this time bless your people here now in Jesus Christ's name it turn says Amen god bless your church going fear now minister Lord let's just love the Lord here let's be real faithful ray
