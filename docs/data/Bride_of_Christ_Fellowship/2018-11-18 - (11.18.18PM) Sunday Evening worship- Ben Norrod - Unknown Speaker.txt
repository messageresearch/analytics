worship here we'll just sing one more song while we invite our brother Ben to come minister God's word you know but before we sing remember brother I'm told that story about the Vangelis who went visit a church and he preached on repentance the first night he preached on repents the second night on the third night he preached repentance and the Deacons called him and said you play them preach or anything different and he said yes as soon as everyone repents don't move on the next message so we're hopefully we repented this morning so we begin here a new message tonight but truly God wants us all to repent they may and I trust you have I trust you feel closer to the Lord and you know it's just so simple you know as soon as we repent it's all under the blood and God is with us he's he's so merciful he's so eager to repent I'm sorry so eager to get us back in the the right paths in our lives and he's so quick to forgive he's so long-suffering thank God for his rich mercy so we can

coming overseas different spots and places in the world call him but I'm not certain as of right now exactly where we're gonna head next there's about five places I'd like to get to but I'm just kind of waiting on the Lord right now to tell us where to go otherwise we've just been staying busy in the meetings here in the States and up through Canon in places so just keep praying for us if you

together tonight amen beautiful singing I sure love the Lord don't you how wonderful he is to us let's turn tonight to first Timothy a man the book first Timothy first Timothy the Lord helping us oh I forgot about to hook and put it right there Chris long amen 5:24 chapter 5 verse 24 first Timothy chapter 5 verse 24 well speak to you tonight on the reason the bride doesn't go through judgment I mean we got everybody repented this morning now we're going to show you the benefit of it amen amen I think I think I am going I'm done with that repent repent but I think I think I got her in there today I think so brother Jesse I was thinking would you said that I had forgotten about that little remark you know when he talked about him they said one time a preacher I think it was moody or one of them said he had such a strong voice and they went intestine ku sticks one day and he hollered repent the guy fell on his face I did the technician oh god help me Lord you know I said well I I said you know III I don't know that we had so much of that this morning but I think everybody was able to do a little adjustment here Amen in their self you know it's some difference a wonderful thing actually whenever you're saved and you've got the Holy Ghost or you're saved at least and you're trying to seek on to greater parts of God and greater depths of God it's a wonderful thing not to have to get into that part of it you know to know that all that's behind you now and you're not really so much as even trying to cry out to God to be a Christian oh I'm a sinner you know it's just as a peaceful feeling to know that really for us now is just a matter of little adjustments along the way you know and he talked about us wearing a white dress and everything and it's nice to know that all we have to do is just put a little detergent on it and clean it up every now and then amen we've done got past the hard stuff we're now in the in the easy journey now a lot of people say that this ain't the easy part maybe not but the difference between being a sinner and being this I think this is the easier part of it myself amen first Timothy chapter 5 verse 24 now let's look just a little while at some things here and I'm gonna deal with the white throne judgment I touched it just a little bit today but I'm gonna kindly drop into it tonight the Lord helping us and I know that God will be with us and everything we try to accomplish because he promised he would be here even right here tonight amen don't you believe that lo you are all right two verses and we're gonna let you be seated some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment some men they follow after likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise in other words the negative or the bad or the evil cannot be hid so in other words what he's saying here is that it doesn't really matter whether you've got good works or bad works it's going to show itself eventually at some point in some place and what you're doing it's absolutely going to be manifest what you are if you're a Christian a real genuine Christian and your works will reflect that very thing if you are otherwise it will be reflected as well and that's why it's important for us to know while we've got an opportunity whether we've got eternal life in our hearts because if we don't we're missing the most the best opportunity than what we've got of what we've got here in this day to get right because how does the Bible say now today right this moment is the day the time or the hour of salvation call on the Lord while it can be found of you because there is coming a time where we won't be able to find him as far as Gentile people and what more they'll call on him and so forth and he he won't be won't be there for him in that way now we read this one more time son men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment some follow after all right let's pray over the word Lord Jesus thank you for the word now we pray that you'll speak to us give us your favor and your grace and your mercy as we commit the service now both speaker and listener in Jesus name Amen god bless you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good now I'm kindly excited about bringing this to you tonight because when I hit this a little bit this morning I felt that little zing zing and I like it when I feel that I know it's the right channel I know it's what we're supposed to talk about and you know as I said to you this morning if you use your own mind and your own thoughts sometimes when you're trying to put things together you can really make a mess out of it if you're trying to use your own thoughts but God knows exactly what all of us need and knows the avenues that need to be taken he knows the little steps and what more that needs to be taken as far as where you are in your walk with Him where at what stage you might be in or what placement you might be in or situation or circumstances you might be facing everyone it might be God's mindful of all of it and what I love about him is that he can come in here and take a message and he can tailor that message for every single one of us in all of our different ways you know each one of us are called to different places some of your husband's in here and fathers and mothers I was teasing Kristen little bit ago when she come to the door first time I've seen in the weekend and I said hello my name has been NORAD nice to meet you I understand you're the pastor's wife you know she run around these kids all the time and I laugh one preacher said that a new mother stays back sit like that for three years you know because they don't never get in church and they never ever always them kids you know and III know everybody's got different little things that do and and if you don't think your pastor's got a hard job preaching here in the church and trying to get things going you ain't never live with a schoolteacher I have I've seen it firsthand they're not done with school when the bell rings they bring school home with them they got hours on top of that he don't have just hours of school but he's got hours of study to get ready for these messages during the week and so it's a hard job but everybody's got their their vocation in life I was talking to brother there and we was getting acquainted a little bit and I asked him I said what do you do for a living he said well I'm in between jobs I'm trying to get situated in a different Avenue and I said well that's fine I said what did you do Lord he said everything from carpenter to truck driver to I almost started gonna throw preaching at one point I just I was waiting for it but I didn't hear it but anyhow everybody's got their own little ways of doing things and everybody's been called to a certain position everybody's you know got their way brother there was telling me he's into computers and securities and things like that and I'm a business guy as far as education goes I like business and I like business models and all of that that stuff would bore you to death but I like it I enjoy studying these case studies of these firms and how they develop and all that and so it comes to the gospel every one of us have a different placement you remember some months ago when I preached to you about everybody having their gifts among the body and everybody being a gifted body and has their place well when it comes to the things of God God has laid out all of these little positions and all of these things as it hath pleased him and we notice what the Bible taught us that all of this is as it has pleased God and we might all have different ways and all that but the word and this is what I was trying to get to you here in this opening talk the word has a special way about it when you let the Lord get a hold of it that he can touch the businessman and the truck driver and the securities guy and the teacher and the housewives and all these other people and just get in there with the same scripture that he might use like repent for example and hit everybody in the whole church because God has laid his word out for all races all classes all intelligences all levels of education all of financial every what they might be he's laid the word out where it can touch every single person and God did it this way because when it comes to bringing judgment in the last hours and we come to the last time the Holy Spirit doesn't want to have people stand before him and say okay now I want to get the rich class to get their judgement time okay now all the whites now all the blacks now all the Chinese the Asian ever what you might be all of the ones from Latin America alright it's your turn all right now everybody that's over six foot tall now you make your way up here I don't think God does things like that I don't think he classes us by our color of our skin or by how he was raised or where we come from the word is what they say in the world one size fits all handle that Amen it fits all of us in a certain way and when it comes to judgment it doesn't matter is expression goes if you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth or if you're a beggar on the street God gives every single one of us an opportunity to get right with him don't you think so I think he gives us all an opportunity our consciences are built I mean our human conscience is built in a way to where that when God is dealing with us and God is talking to us even when we're sinners we might be sitting on a barstool might be laying in the gutter filth of the world ain't no telling where we that might be in a church room might be sitting in a Bible study might be sitting in a you know a robe quired and God starts dealing with your conscience that there's more out there in life there's more to this thing called God than just what you're standing there in church or maybe standing there in the pits of sin and God starts dealing with you maybe there's a savior out there maybe there's somebody out there that loves me and cares for me I believe God wants to deal with every single one of us on that same level and give us all the same opportunities to get right with God when it comes to the judgment God will judge the world but not my not my socio-economic class not my degrees of school not my what you did or what you didn't do who your daddy was or how much money he might have had or ever what it might be he ain't gonna judge us on our last name he ain't gonna judge us on our first name when the judgement hour arrives he is going to judge the world by Jesus Christ and our attitude hallelujah to what we thought about Jesus Christ in this last day he's going to judge us based upon what our attitude toward him was and then how he reciprocated back and what we did with that reciprocation sometimes God will talk to us we don't realize it's God but sometimes he'll talk to us and he wants us to recognize he loves us and cares for us and sometimes we slapped God right in the face I mean humanity does they slap him right in the face and they ignore his advances of his promised word instead of them opening up their heart and saying oh that's Almighty God dealing with me they pass it off as some kind of a figment of somebody's imagination but it's God dealing with them just the same the Bible said that it'll come to a place they'll say no so often that God will sear their conscience with a hot iron in other words they can't feel it no more doesn't matter how much you preach to them no matter what you say they cannot respond to the grace of God and forgive me for this next remark I don't mean it to sound ugly but you could pray for them until your eyeballs fell out of your head you could pray for them until your tongue got thick and you'd almost amen go completely mute but if they've crossed the line between mercy and judgment there's not enough anointing oil there's not enough preachers there's not enough scriptures in the Bible to bring them back once their conscience is sealed and God turns away from them that's it there ain't no more mercy left for them what an hour for some people in this world you think of this lady you'll see an age where there'll be thousands upon thousands that will go by the way of the grave this month before we get to Thanksgiving time there'll be tens of thousands go to the regions of the lost not knowing Jesus as a personal Savior but rather being guilty of turning him away and rejecting his advances of his promised word you see God makes advances on us like a boy would a girl when I met Samantha I flirted a little bit I know it's hard to believe but I did I did brother Jesse I flirted a little bit I happen to like her I thought she was an alright kid and I'd smile bigger than I'd smile with the other girls and I laughed louder when I would the other girls you know because I liked her and I think sometimes in a simplistic way of saying we got these youngins here I tried to say these things I preached here in Akron in a way that all these youngins can get this and I try to give you a mental picture of how Jesus does believe me it could be as simple as you just setting in a Walmart somewhere somebody meant God and you feel the chill going down your back that could be the Holy Ghost trying to get your attention oh it may not be that way it may be something else you might have been sitting in the ballgame and somebody held up a sign Saint John 3:16 you might have thought about God that might have been God trying to get your attention sometimes we don't think about how God does things maybe it was when you were sick and mysteriously somehow you got well and you don't know how you got well maybe you've been in the persecution of another country and God saw you through to safety God trying to get our attention he makes advances on his promise word he displays himself as somebody that wants to be your boyfriend he wants to go deeper than be boyfriend's he wants to marry you and we've got to come to the place where we realize when God makes advances to us as his children we've got to receive what it is that God wants now what would you think if I was to say to Samantha you know my wife Sam y'all may not have got to meet my wife she's a beautiful lady five foot one I call her the little girl at the big voice and she didn't get in here singing as we came but she's got a big mouth a big singing ballad amen that's what she tells me anyhow and I like I like her attitude or spunk you know I like that and I said you know you're feisty and I like it I like that feistiness out of you I never could have married one of these little old flowers always wilted and all that kind of so I could've done it brother Jesse I have been miserable I needed somebody had a little bit of pep in her step you know talking about and and you know what would you think mean much as I think of Samantha and I would say to her hey I like you want to go get an ice-cream sometime or something like that get away from me number one you broke and I don't think you're even handsome well I could have come back the next day and said now now listen I like you I like your spunk I like your attitude I want to take you out for a root beer float she said I tell you to get away from me I don't like you you got a big nose how long y'all think I'd put up with that before eventually I'd move on to another girl Jesus is the same way he makes advances of his promised word he tries to get the people's attention and they keep slapping him in the face there's coming to judgment one day a reckoning day where every man a woman's gonna have to give an account for the things they've done in this life amen and they're gonna find out the very one that could have gave him eternal life they rejected his advances of his promise word now let's turn to Revelation chapter 20 for just a moment let's look at the picture of the judgment that's coming after a while and I just want to show you something in this I know we're very familiar with it but I just want to catch just a couple of phrases and the scripture to kind of outline if you will what I what I'm trying to get to tonight revelation 20 verse 11 I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for him I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now you see the picture of this great judgment time coming notice the heaven and the earth flee away from him that sets on the on the throne but there's one group it ain't running nowhere because the wife ain't afraid of her husband hallelujah she's not afraid standing there of the great judge of the heavens and the earth naw Brad on the outer but she don't run anywhere because she is the promised word made manifest vindicated word standing there in a glorified body sitting on the throne with him that's what Paul said that would you said no you're not saying you'll judge angels and there you're sitting there in the throne of God the rest of the world as we know it is afraid of that face they fear until maybe their boughs would loose until their knees would knock together until they would write it hide but there's nowhere to hide from this face that sits on that throne it's the same all-seeing eye that watched them down in time when they rejected the advances of the promise word he's watching him even now he knows right down to the very soul of who they are and remember my friends Paul describes to us in Hebrews chapter four that we are naked and open in the eyes of him of whom we have to do said the King James other versions of the Bible said of him of who we are responsible him who we are accountable to we are naked in the eyes of him Jesus Christ there's nothing you can hide forgiveness as this sounds ugly I don't mean this an ugly manner but what would happen if some of us walked in here their clothes off you walked in here naked everybody's had that highschool dream about giving the public speech in her underwear every one now I'm trying to say something not trying to be funny but what would happen if you come in this church tonight naked well you there's parts of you if you've got any sense or common sense or something about you at all there's a fear there there's something a scare there you wouldn't want nobody to see you in that condition you want to run and grab some clothes on right quickly somebody help me something's happened I've lost my way I'm standing here naked but men talked about that when he said the lady is seeing people you go to the street corner be a man without any clothes on you tell him that he's naked and he tells you to shut your mouth and get away I'm fine the way I am he said that's the way churches are in the last day he said they don't want to be dressed in the Word of God they want their own garments he said but yet in the eyes of God they're naked wretched miserable blind and they don't even know it now we could cover ourselves up because there'd be a fear or shame they're just like man does with his soul he tries to cover up his soul cover up his conscience try to drown it out my religion and other type of things but in the eyes of God he's still naked I want you listen me carefully children of God Jesus not only sees the good parts but Jesus sees the embarrassing parts he sees the parts that we want to cover up he sees the things that we would honor hide from somebody else things that we want nobody to know about Jesus sees every bit of it now coming back to what Paul said here in Timothy you'll notice that he said these words that some some their sins come open beforehand oh I got to say something to you God let it be that I qualify right there let my sin come open beforehand don't let my sin go on the judgment don't let me be caught up there at the judgment bar with Smith missing something right down through here God helped me that my sins come exposed now you realize the opportunity that we've got when the Word of God gets right in your face and the Holy Spirit gets in your lap and tells you what you need to do to get right that's a blessing to you my friend you can't get mad at Jesus and say God you are not talk to me that way you ought to be the happiest person how to letter that God would expose your sin and help you be right because if you wait to there it's too late there won't be no mercy for it there here we've got mercy here we've got grace here we've got the ability to repent and make it right and say god I'm sorry I want you to forget me but there there'll be nothing left but your works that'll be the only thing you stand there with look at what he said there in Revelation 20 he said they're judged according to their works would you want to have to stand before God with your works alone look at a mirror Matthew 7 that's what reason they come the way they do we were talking out a little bit last night Jesse how those come I preached I prophesied I've done this I done that yeah sure sure they come telling that because that's the only thing they've got I've thought to myself and other times why didn't they come up saying I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm born-again Christian they couldn't say that because they're standing in front of the presence of that light they knew they wasn't mourned again so the only thing they had was to display an exhibition of their works god I've done this I've done that you know no words God don't send me to hell cuz I'm pretty good guy that's the key ain't none of us good guys that's the thing we got to understand grace didn't come to save good guys grace come to save sinners how do you God came to say the last time alone so he became the lowest of the low that he could make us the highest of the high God didn't come to save save people you can't save save people people that think they don't need God they don't need to help they don't need nobody to deal with them don't need nobody to give them a handout lord of god I've got this stand back Michael Stanback Gabriel I'll handle the business that person right there when they stand on the day of judgment they will stand there with their works and their works alone now watch this Paul said going before to judgment now some men they follow after that can you imagine kind of blending in with this morning you remember I told you people get to a spot but it comes to repentance --is and things that when they're repenting and they're really keeping their heart tender before the Lord God honors them for that but you realize that we've arrived at a you know a position if you want to call that I believe it's a position just like the bride would have a position I believe on that false vine it's a position just the same we've arrived at the positioning of these men and women that will not repent at the preaching of this last day preachers that's why brother ben said we're coming back to a spot what would be preaching the souls in prison that can never be saved now listen to me that don't mean they leave Church they don't mean they don't sit on these pews it just means they won't repent they won't be still won't be touched they won't be influenced by anything you watch people in this day and age I watch them when I preach to them you know I'm watching every one of you III pay attention to how they act how they behave when the words going forth I watch to see who's responding and who ain't responding I don't always mean naturally or physically maybe an Amen or glory or a hallelujah or something like that but I watch to see the attitude of the person to see how they're answering back to the Word of God to see whether or not they're connected with what's being preached and I see people again and again and again and again setting in the pews and there's no connection between me and the Holy Spirit and them we're entering a place where those that will not repent are coming in that spot to preach to those that cannot be said preach to those that are eternal life preach to those that can never five the sudden appears dead but yet still claiming to believe footbe followers of the message now what does God do with a person like that now when you and I the Lord deals with us he says repent say yes Lord sorry forgive me I like what brother Jesse did this morning and I've had it in my mind all day to mention this I almost forgot it to the Lord remind me of just now but I liked how you said this morning just ask God to forgive you he waited just a few moments they bout to get a chance to compose himself and he said all right ain't it wonderful that Jesus forgave you I thought he's the first preacher in 27 years of preaching that I've ever heard bring it on just exactly like it I thought it was wonderful usually say ask God to forgive you for hours later they're still asking but I like what he did this morning because I said that's what the Bible said ask and if you ask and as you ask believe that what you've said will come to pass how many times does it take me to ask God to forgive him before he's already heard my prayer and has already answered my prayer I believe it by faith if I say I'm sorry I don't have to say the second time he heard me the first time this is not Catholicism we don't drag our knees on concrete we don't rep beads we don't kiss Peters toe we don't beat ourselves trying to find peace with God faith is what brings us peace with God faith in his promise work that I asked him according to his promise it's up to him to forgive me or not and if I do it God's Way he promised to forgive me hey man he promised to do what he said he was gonna do either's a man of his word reate and if I believe he's said it then I've got to believe that it's exactly for me and what he promised in that way but some men sins go on to the judgment why is that I want to use a few examples and I know I've you've probably heard a lot of this before I don't mean to bore you with new detail all details but I I think sometimes you got to go back and revisit some of these things to keep him fresh in you and I think about people like Marilyn Monroe most photographed woman on the face of planet Earth course they say she's the most beautiful woman I said well I said she was a pretty girl but later on in life you know they don't realize because a lot of people don't know this about Marilyn but she had collagen put in her nose she had a little rubber thing put in her chin had enhancements all over her body from the top of her head to the soles of her feet to keep her looking young keep her looking like she was looking she was manufactured beauty because you see a lot of these people where they realize they're not they get under the influence of a spirit and that devil tells him Elvis Presley you look at how this Presley was a handsome man stayed a handsome man of course so you would look handsome too if you use shoe polish on your eyelashes to keep him black and dark like it and your hair by the way it wasn't a natural thing oh no he had all kinds of enhancement surgery and all of this started out a handsome boy but kept it going through all kinds of little old ways he had eye trouble for a lot of years people don't realize this he had a lot of bad eye trouble because of all that shoe polish he kept in his eye little chemical things and stuff getting in his eyes all the time just about ruin his eyes trying to keep him dark eyelashes afraid to turn gray of course because then women wouldn't throw their undergarments at him it's a spirit these things that get a hold of people I was told a story sometime back in the summer and I may have shared this with you but I'm going to tell it again Dottie Rambo who wrote a lot of these great songs if you know Dottie she wrote songs like see the bright light shine if that isn't love one of the most prolific songwriters of gospel music and I guess the 21st 20th century 21st century probably won't be another one like her she was just dynamite one of the best since Fanny Crosby wrote hundreds of songs good friends with Elvis Presley and said Elvis called her over one day and said Dottie I need you to come pray and so her and her husband buck Rambo they got the car drove over to where Elvis was at I think it was Graceland the time and he's sitting in his floor with his Bible open and he's sitting there and an Indian position of you know his legs crossed I what we used to call Indian style he sent her with his Bible on his lap and he's praying and he sees Dottie and Buck walking he said you got to pray for me right now he's gripping his Bible and he said I just can't find him I just can't find him they Don they prayed and they said Elvis hollered and wailed and screamed and and cried out to God and when they left that room he was left there clutching his Bible saying I just can't find him I just can't find him you see my friend many of these people that refuse to repent God shuts a door on them and no matter how much they cry no matter how much they cry out he shuts the door on them and there's no way back that's why he's sitting her holding his Bible I just can't find him I just can't find him now when you get a person in that condition such an unrepentant attitude then God who cannot deal with their sins today now you understand when you and I do something wrong I mind you there's 50 scriptures I could read I'm gonna let you pass to read hold him and a few weeks from now whatever he brings it back maybe but we could go to the book of John he said in little children I write unto you that you sin not but if any man sin he has an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous when we do something wrong God deals with us we repent of the thing today it stops today never to return again until we make another mistake we repent again it goes away under the blood of Jesus Christ that's because you got a repentant spirit but what about the people that don't Paul tells us what happens here their sins accumulate their aggregated for example Marilyn Monroe has been dead for many many years but she's still sending even though her body's laying in a mausoleum Elvis Presley is still committing wrongs and sins his music is still aggregating sins against his example when he stands before God he won't just answer for all of the years up to 77 when he drew his last breath but he'll have to answer from 77 all the way to 2000 whatever when Jesus takes his home he'll have to answer for her because his example is still out there before humanity how many men pulled up Marilyn's picture and lusted after how many people made some movie about Marilyn Monroe flashed a picture up there at Maryland and in their mind in their heart committed like Jesus said when a man looks on a woman to lust after he's committed adultery with her with her didn't say whether she was living or dead or not you say well where to god she's dead God can't hold nothing against her counting a lot of these sins remember they visit generation after generation somebody's got to give an account for it remember the prophet of God said that whenever you confess your sin he said it goes into the blood of Jesus Christ it breaks up back all through the the generations it goes back through all of that and it goes where back to the head of the one that started it in the first place which was the devil Satan has to give an account for everything he's ever taught me into doing he's the one to blame for it because the blood of Christ takes it all the way back people can say well she's dead but it doesn't matter her pictures her influence is still living on how can God stop a sin that would have never been stopped here in time because they had an unrepentant attitude this is why they stand before God at the day of judgment their works is all they've got Lord I was a pretty good guy remember that evangelist Danny Greenfield that stood in the light he said he thought he was a pretty good guy seven of the bride of that light got the law realize he wasn't let me tell you something Church of the Living God we may think oh my that the light gets pretty bright sitting here in church but should I thank God that it's bright like it is because you don't want to meet that at judgment time and a man when that Holy Ghost preacher pulls out one of them Holy Ghost candles and he illuminates that like you're hunting for deer hey man is the brightest light and you think Lord I'm an awful person you ought to just not walk out shout out of this church thinking God thank you for letting me see everything that's in my life everything this room that I can deal with it right now makes it hard sometimes the preaching of the word gets very hard like that because we go to looking at ourselves and what we're all about and we thank to ourself man I'm an awful person but where would you rather thank it here over yonder I'd rather think it here now watch he said some will follow after now some sins come open before Hanna there's also those like Ananias and Sapphira who whenever having the opportunity to maybe repent or make right God already knew that their heart was hardened that their face was set like flint so Peter sets up court why did you lie to the Holy Ghost yeah well God didn't even give him a chance it's not wrote in the Bible how many chances they got but I'm sure they got chances because God don't call a man to judgment without a first warning inversed God brought him in and dealt with him and told him listen you you've held back part of the price why'd Satan fill your heart to do such a thing and then here come wifey have you done all that the Lord told you to do solve an old arrogant type spirit you know one place the prophet of God said maybe Anton stood so far maybe that was a deacon in the church big time failure probably a lot of people wouldn't have called him out because they wouldn't want to lose their financial gain praise the Lord somebody let me tell you something real mini garden got their eyes focused on that know how I right now I stand before you the dumbest preacher that ever lived I'm the dumbest preacher though I'm smart estab Angeles that ever lived because places that would support me greatly financially thousands of dollars would support me I go and preach the gospel and I ruin it all they don't never want me back if I was a smart Evangelist like some of these guys out there today this all out for the meal ticket they would find the places to preach it paid to most and they would just keep hitting him and hitting him and hitting him and preach nice of course preach sweet of course but Jesse make everything nice and never preach the gospel never get down hard tell everybody how elected they are how alive Jesus is and how great the message is and the message and the message and the message and a message and then they go home and leaves exactly the same way that come in miserable miserable and questioning Who am I where am I going I gotta get right with God we need some gospel preachers they ain't worried about almighty dollar but Almighty God yes sir we need them we need them I'm gonna say this I know that Internet's up here but you know I heard men talk about other churches okay places that I used to attend they're talking about pastoring churches and things of that nature I hear different folks talking about pastoring and it sounds like a business transaction it's a place you know a business almost the church has become that way what's going to happen a lot of these men standing before their flocks it's gonna have to give an account for not telling the truth simply because it would affect their own personal bottom line the church isn't a business the church's judgment house hallelujah somebody judgment begins at the house of God that's what the Bible said this is where we judge ourselves according to the word and the faith or not we're not supposed to come out here and pat everybody on the head and tell you how pretty you look at how handsome you are and how much bride you are and all that I can do all that to but when you walk out of you think well am i bride and am i how do I know because you live with yourself and you don't need nobody to judge you you're your own judge of who you are you live with yourself you know yourself better than anybody you know them places that are naked in God's eyes right and you never bear those parts to me or nobody else but God sees them just the same that's hebrews chapter 4 if you like to read it let's just go there let's just go there let's just read it hebrews chapter 4 let's see if we're naked or not in his eyes hebrews chapter four let's pick it up verse 14 or excuse me verse 11 I mean to say let us labor therefore to enter into that rest a city man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit the joints of the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart neither is there any creature at you by the way that's me by the way that is not manifest in his sight and what Paul said whether it's good whether it's bad all will come into manifestation everything will be shown but all things that's me and you again are naked and open oh God naked and open in the eyes of him with whom we have to do you say well I I'm a religious guy better be I do religious things that might be the covering on the outside that might be the covering you chose but in the eyes of God we're naked the only thing that will cover us up from being naked in the eyes of God as we must have the baptism of the Holy Spirit that is the believers garment that keeps us from being absolutely naked in Lady ousia it keeps us from being naked in the eyes of God it keeps us from all amen just to be covered in the Word of God hallelujah that word is what covers us up God as ice all to keep us that the shame of our nakedness do not appear amen amen amen oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen the Bible even tells us the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run a thin to it and they're safe that's proverbs 18:10 if you'd like to read it he tells us that the rich man's wealth is a strong City as a high wall his own conceit before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility he that answereth a matter before he heareth it is folly in a shame to him the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who could bear the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge and a man's gift makes rooms for himself and and brings him before great men he that his first his own cause seemed is just but his neighbor cometh in search with him see you understand what he's saying he's saying that in other words if a man is his works if he's wise he seeks for God's way doesn't seek for his own way if he wants honor he seeks it through humility glory to God if he wants peace he seeks it through ending the war between him and Jesus Christ I'll tell you something brother the Bible said that we're at war with God when were not saved did you know that our minds are in natee against the things of God we are at war there's a wall of partition between us oh I know Jesus tore it down but you've got to accept that pardon first if you don't accept it first there's no way that it can be accepted the wall is still there between you and God you're at war with him that's why when you get new armor on he gives you shoes of gospel peace you're at peace with God you're no longer worrying about things am i save does God love me no no you know that beyond a shadow of a doubt Solomon here is describing how that a person achieves great things the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they're safe Oh God if here's my Taliban why do I build my own place of protection we've been talked about in the days of Noah he said in the days of Noah there were other boat builders among everybody trying to build their own way and make their own way into the kingdom you have to come God's Way God's way look at some of these little principles he lays in there he that answereth a matter before he hears it it's folly and shame the heart of the prudent seeks knowledge and the ear the wise seek knowledge in other words if a man is going to be anything at all he's got to realize first that he's nothing and that there's a higher knowledge that there's a higher wisdom and there's a higher honor that he has to seek but he can't seek it in himself for the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and her safe oh I just love the word don't you and lets us know my hallelujah that if we're naked in the eyes of God then God sees all of our ambitions God sees all of our goals and our dreams and if God wants us to get somewhere he'll make room for us to get there if we trust him if we have confidence that he's the leader he'll make room for us to get there but like Solomon saying you try to do it through your riches try to do it in your own conceits try to do it in your own way it's folly to answer a matter before you hear it in other words sit down and count the cost a little bit god what is that you want me to do the prophet of God likened to a man going to work he said you show up on a job and you're standing around maybe for an hour or something like that and you still don't know what you're supposed to do you go to the boss and say hey would you hire me for well you want me to do around here Levin said you do God the same exact way if you want to know what God sets you here for you go back and ask him Lord what is that you want me to do why is that purpose how to do what you want me to do I want to follow your will you sit down you count the cost you take a look at what the real matters of life are all about and then real matters is what God's thought for you was but here in this judgment time God deals with everybody in the afterword according to their works well what a horrible thing that is we don't never want to stand there with our works in conference God the prophets said there's a conference where every man will meet every woman will meet a place selected and there'll be a great white throne judgment said he said now you may miss this conference this morning's on my church he said but you'll never me that one you may bypass all of them through your life you said but you'll never bypass that one Oh al l will appear before the judgment seat of Christ did you know the bride will even appear before she'll appear for rewards sake not for judgment we have to give an account for the life that God gave to us a man he said what were your stand me at that conference oh he said we'll have to give an account of everything notice this in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 27 he said it's appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment of the words after this life then judgment awaits for every man woman they've got to give an account to God for everything they've ever done they've got to give an account to God for the life that he placed in their hands and here's the key of it Jesus give us the principle when he said and when a man seeks to save his life he'll lose it hallelujah come on somebody but if you'll seek to lose his life he'll save it in doing so oh well you see you see how Solomon was bringing out the principle that the Lord is our strong tower that you if you want to know what's right if you want to know what's true you've got to give away all of your human thinking you got to yield to his I tell you the hardest lesson for many Christians to learn and I mean it is the hardest lesson is the one that it seems to be the easiest which is let go and let God that's a tough one but if we're spiritual like we should be that is the that is the theme if you will of our walk with God let go and let him have control yes sir absolutely oh thank you Jesus all right I've been up here almost an hour now someone trying to wind down in just a little bit but you understand what I'm saying to you tonight all right second Peter chapter 2 verses 4 & 9 the Bible tells us that these angels that sent about the ones that fell with Lucifer in the beginning and cast them down to hell deliver them the chains of Darkness to be reserved verse 9 the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under the day of judgment to be punished so he reserves him penny man tells you there's a burning hell now but you believe you may know such thing as a burning hell now he's in a prison house and I said I don't believe that it's a burning hell but the prophet of God said in souls in prison God don't throw a man into a burning hell to judge him before he stood trial first he's got to stand trial oh I know the question well what about the rich man in that flame it didn't mean it was a natural flame it's symbolism he's talking about the torments brother BAM said it was such a terrible thing he's describing the same way brother Branham didn't when he had the vision he said if they would put hot pokers through my body he said would have been a bit of pleasure compared to what that was that's what the rich man was trying to say tell father Abraham to put it a cold drop of water you think a drop of water would have cooled the flames of hell he's given an example the King James Version and the English of the King James has given us an example of what this prison house is like and brother BAM said when he started to descend down into that realm he said it was a sickly smoke he smelled he said that's when them women came to them green eyes on who ooh who would like that and so forth cried matter he said there was no mama there cried daddy there was no daddy there I cried out Jesus there was no God there he said I was all alone falling with no bottom underneath me falling falling falling to prison house you think of the thousands that are event into that place since hell was created for the devil's in an angel there reserved just like you know when you go out to fancy restaurant you know they want you to reserve your place so they've got a table reserved is for you you walk in there isn't Jesse Smith oh yes come right this way mr. Smith they take the little card off the table and right there's your table God has got a place reserved for the unjust they have a special reservation all but here's what makes me dance and shout I do too but it ain't in hell it's in heavenly places with Christ Jesus but the problem said that is the position of the believer how it's reserved for the elect of God it's reserved for the Holy Spirit that has entered into the people of God we has a reservation as well God knows how to deliver us out of temptation he knows how to take us away from that in other words which would drag us to hell God knows how to deliver us from it hey man thank God he does some I said but rather be in don't you think they're being tormented in the flames now no if I believe what brother brems said and souls in prison I can't the lake of fire it falls after the judgment comes the RAM tells us what happens judgment is set up here on the earth the white throne mother Jesse sit right here on this earth and down from heaven comes holy fire but that holy fire mingles with the elements of the earth and it turns into a lake of fire this earth will burn as a lake of fire and the unjust will be thrown into this lake of fire it'll burn the earth all the way back to the elements right back to the very purity that it started from everything will burn back to its original way and sin forgot him that can destroy body you know the scripture but fear who who can take and destroy soul and body in hell and one way of looking at it hell as the grave hell is Hades that's true my body is in prison in the earth whenever I go and I die if I even don't go by the way the rapture if we don't go by the way the rapture when I die brother Jesse they'll take my body and they'll stick it in the ground my body is reserved it is imprisoned in Hades and I have no guarantee of ever getting out of there if I'm not born again to the Holy Spirit but here's what I like if I'm the Holy Ghost filled Christian whenever my body goes underneath this ground sure Satan may have had a claim on this body when I was a sinner but before I take my breath there's been a claim made on this body by the holy ghost and when I go down there's the spiritual little flag it says this property this is property of Jesus Christ Alleluia amen and how do I escape from hell because my Lord Jesus was imprisoned in Hades as well and his body released from Hell he defeated not only had itself but the grave as well he defeated this natural Hades because he lives I can live also a menace a reservation God reserved it for you and I Oh oh but you know two people living in torments and this not sure I believe they're in torment I don't say that if they go down to the regions of the loss or not in torment they're in torment to them you know it's a it's a horrible thing but the RAM said in one place tell metell was pressing he said the millions of souls that Elvis put there he said her morning around him and tormenting him all the time utilizing that I'm in this place your music is what put me here I'd rather talk about flames a fires it was a small thing compared to what they're having to suffer right now in that region here it is coming upon Christmas time the prophet of God said what if that bony frame could crawl into the church this morning and testify to us many years ago I preached a message I stole it from a guy named out of night he's a pastor in morgan's in North Carolina and he was preaching a message many years ago about the voices from hell I stole it I did it I stole it I stole the message I never come up with it was his idea and I said hey buddy you didn't copyright it so I'm taking it hey I remember him talking about when he be in those youth camps and be preaching to young people and he'd start calling up people to testify out of hell I took this message some time ago a little spot out there and I was preaching to some people and so I just started I was acting out all the parts and so what I said now we call Evers Presley and I became Elvis you see I just talked like Elvis like I was talking I did my part we got after the meeting this other boy this old boy walked up was shaking me by the hair so I thought that was you know was the pastor said he's not Elvis Presley he was acting out that he was homeless Presley I laughed at him but I stood there and I thought if these men could testify Marilyn and the rest of them could testify what would they tell us stand right here in this church and they tell us young people they tell us older people they tell us middle-aged people whatever you do accept your opportunity if your sins come open now let them come open hey man if God wants to deal with you because you don't want to come to this place what if we called up one of the main ones that we read about in the Bible the rich young ruler lifts his hell is lifted his eyes up in hell rather levan takes the text and then he cried he said that's right and then he cried yes lift his eyes up in hell but really when to sit on the earth there was a different picture given some Pharisees standing there saying oh this good old brother he believed the message all the days of his life he gave and gave and gave and gave he sure did but he also took and took and took and took until the Bible said in another place he said to himself so take your rest take your ease the voice come back to him this day your soul will be required of you God's taking it seriously brother whether we are not we may not sense him we may not feel him we may not seem we meant noise around but God's taking it seriously whether we are not what we do in this life God's given us the understanding now I'm coming to my text here and then we're going to quit the reason the bride don't go through judgment all these other parts more they make you kindly sad a little bit that's kind of what I want you to be I want you to be a little sad I want you thank God this sorrow works repentance but the reason that the bride doesn't go through judgment y'all ready y'all ready for this the reason the bride doesn't go through judgment is because the Prophet said the Bible said the word of god says we were already judged in Jesus Christ at Calvary Oh hallelujah brother branham said if I'm a part of Christ when he died I died in him here's another reason notice again in John he said if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and we have fellowship one with another method Jesse quoted this morning at a st. John there are in the general epistle first John we talked about he that is born of God cannot commit sin for his seed remains in him that's right on the flesh body the outside man he's a sinner he's always going to be a sinner don't try to change him that's what he is listen you can drag his body the altar every day but the body ain't gonna get saved it's gonna take the resurrection rapture to do that I can drag him into a prayer closet I can make him look at the Bible but he don't know eaten he's never and nor does he want to be saved he's of the evil one Amen that's why when the body says I ain't going to church I'm tired tonight as I shut your mouth you ain't in charge Amen I tell me you're going to church whether you like it or not come on somebody a man a this body is a sinner it doesn't want to live right it doesn't want to live holy but that part of my soul that's been redeemed glory to God that part that's been touched by the Holy Ghost it is so sinless that not even God can see an ounce of sinner in me I have been described the Holy Ghost and fire has burnt away any remnant of what I used to be now I need a body to match my soul in this body there may be tattoos I don't have any but somebody may have been a tattoo thing when they was in the world girls or boys like may have holes in their ears they may have scars from will use to get knife fights and bars and everything like that sometimes I see this girl right here I hit the habit of beer bottle 1942 whatever it is but when their bodies are changed God will take away all of them holes God will take away the beer bottle cut not only that brother Jesse but he'll take away from us every strain every temper every less thing every impatient thing anything ungodly that was handed down to us in this first birth got a life out of it God as though it never was in there in the first place friends do you understand when we get to the other side do you realize the reason why that the bride can no longer ever dwell in sin is because there's nothing in her to sin with excuse his sisters but the prophet of God said he even takes the sex organs and the sex glands those are gone after we get changed hey listen brother sister there's glands in your lips girls that's the reason why and boy notice boy and girls plural and then one I told him a day I realized why nevermind he's outnumbered I'll say that much let the cat out of the bag that's the reason you're not supposed to kiss because you got glands in your lips and it's a potential sex act when you cross them lips and touch the lips together then glands cross over potentially it's a sex act God will hold you accountable for things right but when our bodies are changed there won't be one remnant of anything sexual in our bodies meaning that the tree of knowledge of good and evil will be completely done away with we'd never be able to partake of a tree that never existed got a wipeout as though it never took place in the beginning that's real redemption for us right the reason the bride don't go through judgment another reason because the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed her of all of her sin amen another reason the bride don't go through judgment is because her name was on his book before the foundation of the world the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ dipped his finger in his side and these are all symbols but they mean something you dipped his finger in his side he wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ the name of Jesus Christ on the last girl I said his name was the first name that went down well it's his book I reckon he oughta put his name in it and they said the bride member was every bride member was placed subsequently underneath those names just one after another after another in their Road in the blood of Jesus Christ when was a having it it happened when he was slain before the foundation of the world your name didn't go down there the day you got saved it was there already before you got saved that's the reason you could get saved because it was already there but greater than that those names that were identified with the Lamb those were sinless individuals from the beginning oh oh oh but you say they come into time and they've done some sin and sure they did but once they get wrapped back around and what that book said about them God don't see that other part I ran notice I love this remark right here but I'm talking here in the questions and answers he said the church the lukewarm anything outside of the elected bribe will go through the tribulation they're not raised in the first resurrection the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years just the foreordained predestinated elected bribed by God's own elections who is it ready ma'am I don't know I can't tell you but I know it's going to be there because the Lord said they would there are the ones that will go through the tribulation because the rest of them will go through the tribulation they'll go down and then killed before the Millenium and the righteous will come out on the Millenium out in the Millenium rather and live a thousand years after the thousand years there'll be a great white throne judgement calm and dead both riding ron was raised up the books are open the book of life is open and the Saints the wife and the husband fully they'll set and judge the world and why because you were a part of him before the foundation world let me say something as I close I know you're tired you got work in the morning and I'm tired too and I didn't have to work tomorrow my work tomorrow is my Sabbath they may I say that but it ain't true I got to work with these kids I got school tomorrow but I'm gonna say this to you imma quit this is the reason why you can repent this is the reason why you have that tender Spirit in your heart this is the reason why no matter how hard you get or how aggravated or how frustrated or how backslide you might get in your lifetime that's the reason somebody is always a pulling on you that's why somebody's always keeping you from going too far when you could take that next step that next step you'd be a goner something keeps you from taking that next step what does that God's Amazing Grace he saw a bride he saw who she was where she came from where she was going he saw that she'd be a part of him Alleluia just like my little daughter there Annelise just like these young uns here when Jesse was on the football field throwing touchdowns a man when I was out on a skateboard riding around BMX and freestyling hard to believe I did it but I did it son I on the outside it was me but there were attributes on the inside of me my girls were living inside of here couldn't see him couldn't fellowship with them but they were right here my children was in me this is the reason the bride don't go through judgment because she is him he is her there one not two there one for the bride and the groom is joined together what do we say at weddings I now pronounce you man and wife that the Twain will be one flesh this is the reason the bride can't go through judgment because God can't judge himself and if you're a part of him and you are him he can't judge you either woo how some of y'all are sitting still right now I don't know I'm about to run away that's the reason God can't judge us because we're a party Oh glory stand with me oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus but there is a reckoning day coming someday Paul said in first Corinthians six no you're not the Saints well judge the world you see the real bride of Jesus Christ I mean the real one yes she's been touched by the hand of Almighty God and brother once he touches you there ain't nobody can untouched what he's touched remember what he said about doors he said I open things that no man can shut him and then I shut things no man can open what's he's moved on you there ain't no unmoving it what Scott deals with you there ain't no underling whatever he does it was for a purpose it was for a reason God helped me to always listen help me to always be sensitive help me to feel help me to see help me to thank help me to believe whatever advance you make upon my heart help me God to be receptive help me that I can listen and be sensitive oh you say you preaching this and all of us are saved just saying I'm not talking about getting a brother I'm talking about staying saved because let's face facts time makes you hard experiences make you hard you see a lot of things you experienced a lot of things it puts a little something in you you know you're gun-shy you know you've been hurt by people that you trusted it's a little harder to trust that person next time around you know I'm talking about sometimes you just it's hard it's hard to get that in your brain well I'd like to trust them but I remember that situation that one time God helped me Lord no matter what experiences I have helped me to remain sensitive at any time you move on my heart any time you deal with me that I could be ready I could be listening and I could be repented and repented that I can be responsive and that I could be touchable and teachable can we pray together with your heads bowed today I want you to think over your life just a moment I see them I see a real blessing and what's been brought today because I realized that as hard as some of these things sound they're a blessing to a Christians life because it means God loves us enough to talk to us and say hey I want you to think about who you are I want you to judge your attitude judge your responses thank you Lord for that thank you Lord now with your heads bowed if you just like to take just a moment and talk to the Lord and say God I just want you to know Lord that if you got a deal with me on anything I want to be dealt with here I don't want anything to meet me at the river I want to be sensitive I want to be teachable I'm asking you to help me Lord Jesus you see your body standing here with their hands raised up god I pray the Holy Spirit would be with everyone else help us mighty God to be teachable to be touchable to be sensitive let our attitude be the God how have you got to deal with this Lobo wanting to be dealt with thank you Lord for today's messages may you just move them and sink them deep down in the hearts of your elected God may they bring change and every one of us today oh god I pray that the Holy Ghost will change hardness bitterness wrath emulation old God take all of that out of a separate in Jesus name help us be sensitive Lord in Jesus name Amen [Music] in that your desire why don't you just raise your hands up the Lord say god it's my desire tonight I just want my heart I just want my life I wanted to be sensitive to you Jesus how they knew Saint something forced brother if you will let's just worship to get a little bit before we go home coming but Jesse wants you to come take the service I love you friends god bless you I've enjoyed speaking to you today that's just worship together can we it's our brother sings to us in my life prayer I'm here to pray for you otherwise god bless you pray for me yes my lord yes my god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

sinners can never do that the tears can never knew that is even those that I don't brother said even though they prophesied and cast the devil's Jesus said you workers of iniquity they kept working in
