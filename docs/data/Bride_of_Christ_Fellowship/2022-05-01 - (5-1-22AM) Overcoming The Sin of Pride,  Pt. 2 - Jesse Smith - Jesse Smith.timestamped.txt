[37:03] of the father but is of the world i'll
[37:05] read 17 myself
[37:07] and the world passeth away

[38:39] mortal flesh today god bless your people
[38:41] through the spoken word in jesus
[38:43] christ's name and the saint said
[38:45] amen god bless you as you're being
[38:46] seated praise god
[38:49] i do have some uh quotes to share in
[38:51] some scriptures so whenever you're ready
[38:53] you can switch over there hunted by
[38:54] god's grace
[39:00] i'd like to uh just briefly reverse you
[39:03] know last week we looked at
[39:04] uh pride you know where it started we
[39:06] looked at where it started with satan
[39:09] and satan exalted of course himself
[39:11] against god and said i will be like the
[39:13] most high he never said i'll be greater
[39:15] than the most high he knew he couldn't
[39:17] do that but he said i will be like the
[39:19] most high
[39:20] and he kept exalting himself to be
[39:23] someone great can you imagine he
[39:25] convinced a third of the angels that he
[39:28] could exalt and be equal to god and he
[39:31] could have a throne that would be equal
[39:33] to god because of pride because of his
[39:35] beauty and because of his
[39:37] wisdom he was he was the one the
[39:39] smartest of all the angels
[39:41] he was the most beautiful of all the
[39:42] angels he was the of course he had all
[39:44] these pipes and tablets on him as well a
[39:47] musical uh angel as well he was the
[39:50] wisest most beautiful smartest and
[39:53] yet because of that that's what
[39:54] corrupted his heart and brother man
[39:56] tells us that to our sisters you know
[39:58] sisters be careful if you're really
[40:00] pretty
[40:01] brothers you be careful if you're really
[40:03] handsome most of us don't have to worry
[40:04] about that
[40:05] praise god
[40:07] but he said the thing that you think may
[40:09] be so great
[40:11] if you're not careful the enemy will
[40:13] deceive you with that
[40:15] and it can actually become a hindrance
[40:17] to you rather than a help look at elvis
[40:19] presley he was handsome when he was
[40:20] younger he could really sing but what
[40:22] happened he allowed the devil to get in
[40:24] there and the devil uses his
[40:27] good looks and his voice
[40:28] and perverted all the gifts that god had
[40:30] given to him
[40:32] and he died as an old man and uh
[40:35] he didn't live very long actually i
[40:36] think he died in his 50s and what a sad
[40:38] life it was and all bloated and uh and
[40:41] he died the very last day he was reading
[40:43] books about witchcraft
[40:45] and that's when he overdosed on drugs
[40:47] you would think a man that was raised in
[40:48] a pentecostal church that knew the power
[40:50] of god and knew the ram knew elvis
[40:53] mother
[40:54] brother man knew elvis's original pastor
[40:57] and would talk him talk to them about it
[40:59] and brother brown would call him a
[41:00] modern day judas iscariot
[41:03] see church the very sometimes the very
[41:04] things where we think our blessings if
[41:06] we're not careful the enemy can use
[41:08] those against us
[41:10] in other words we've got to yield
[41:11] everything that we have we got to yield
[41:13] everything that we are to god
[41:15] praise god and not take any confidence
[41:18] in ourselves remember pride is just
[41:20] self-confidence well i can trust in
[41:22] myself i've done this before i've got
[41:24] the power i've got the ability to do
[41:26] this we've got to leave that idea behind
[41:28] praise god and every day we got to
[41:30] depend on god hallelujah and depend upon
[41:33] his promises as we'll see here today by
[41:35] the grace of god we'll look at uh
[41:37] numerous things i'm going to go from
[41:38] jesus uh to israel and then to jesus
[41:41] disciples that's that's kind of where i
[41:42] felt led to go in this morning and
[41:44] yesterday i was as i was preparing
[41:46] and at the end of this service i'm going
[41:47] to show some uh videos of prideful
[41:50] preachers i'm going to show some we'll
[41:52] stop the livestream at the end i just
[41:54] feel that like i'm going to share it
[41:55] today and so you can see it i've been
[41:57] working on it you know for months and
[41:58] months just picking a little bit here
[41:59] and there and
[42:00] um
[42:02] and may god help us
[42:04] to always be humble that's our prayer
[42:06] may god help us to humble ourselves all
[42:09] the time
[42:13] so i thought you know i had this thought
[42:14] i was listening to a few sermons on
[42:15] pride and i just had this thought well
[42:18] we should go back and see what jesus
[42:19] said about pride we should see what
[42:21] jesus said about humility
[42:23] because if anybody knew anything about
[42:25] anything it was jesus praise god
[42:27] hallelujah god in flesh hallelujah so
[42:30] let's look at jesus's words on pride and
[42:31] humility i think there was only five for
[42:33] four times he said the word humble
[42:35] uh in his that's recorded in the gospels
[42:38] so let's look at those here if we can uh
[42:40] in john 18 1-6 we'll start there
[42:44] someone come up and ask jesus who is the
[42:46] greatest in the kingdom
[42:48] that's a good question
[42:50] right we all want to be we all want to
[42:52] be something in god's kingdom
[42:55] and we would all and we can say this
[42:57] humbly we'd all like to be
[42:59] the most useful we can to god
[43:02] we would all like to
[43:05] how many would like to please god the
[43:07] very best you possibly could
[43:09] so see there's a desire that we want in
[43:11] other words we want to do something
[43:13] great for god but but it's not to exalt
[43:16] ourselves
[43:17] there's a great difference there i want
[43:18] to do something for god but not that i'm
[43:20] glorified but that god is glorified but
[43:23] all but i do want to know that i've done
[43:25] my part i've done what god's asked me to
[43:27] do praise god
[43:28] i want that satisfaction praise god
[43:31] to know that i've done what god asked me
[43:34] to do
[43:35] i was able to uh receive his strength
[43:38] and re and and understand his word and
[43:41] and accept his guidance in my life and
[43:43] that that i know that i found the path i
[43:45] found the narrow path amen
[43:47] i want to know that i did that praise
[43:49] god
[43:50] and so they set a little child in their
[43:52] midst there and i'm going to go to john
[43:54] i'm sorry i'm going to matthew 18 now
[43:56] and just rehearse what jesus said there
[43:59] just a beautiful text here
[44:02] this is where most people get the
[44:04] statement faith like a child you've
[44:06] heard that before that actual statement
[44:08] is not in the scripture but it's it's
[44:10] kind of combined with uh matthew 18 and
[44:14] mark 10.
[44:16] they said who is the greatest in the
[44:18] kingdom in of heaven in verse one and
[44:20] notice he takes a little child
[44:22] and sets him in the midst of them
[44:24] there's all these
[44:25] all these big guys all these strong men
[44:27] and all these wonderful women and and
[44:29] jesus when they ask him he finds one
[44:31] tiny little child and just sets the
[44:33] child he just says stay right there now
[44:36] notice the child doesn't argue with
[44:37] jesus
[44:38] the child doesn't complain with jesus
[44:41] the child doesn't rebuke jesus
[44:44] the child just obeys jesus
[44:46] the child just does what jesus says amen
[44:49] hallelujah
[44:50] simplicity
[44:52] he just says sit right here child
[44:55] i'm placing you right here and the child
[44:56] does and then the child lets jesus do
[44:58] all the talking amen hallelujah that's
[45:01] what we want today amen speak from
[45:03] heaven jesus amen amen speak from heaven
[45:06] let not my thoughts be in it may it be
[45:08] your word amen
[45:11] verse 4 whoever
[45:13] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[45:14] as this little child the same is
[45:16] greatest
[45:17] in the kingdom of heaven
[45:19] who can humble himself like a child
[45:20] verse 5 and whoso shall receive one such
[45:24] little one in my name
[45:26] receiveth me now we're getting down look
[45:28] at this thought now jesus says if you
[45:30] can just receive a child
[45:32] in the name of jesus
[45:35] so we can't always look who's got the
[45:37] most adults in the ministry sometimes
[45:39] we've got to look who's got the biggest
[45:40] heart to serve children
[45:43] praise god
[45:44] because jesus says whoever receives a
[45:46] little child in my name receives me
[45:51] praise god
[45:54] now let me say this for our church we
[45:56] don't have a sunday school teacher well
[45:57] i guess i am
[45:59] but if you want to do a before service
[46:01] sunday school it would take someone
[46:03] who's dedicated to children
[46:05] and if nobody feels qualified that's
[46:06] fine i'm still happy to do it on sunday
[46:08] night
[46:10] but that's i'm just trying to give you
[46:11] that thought now notice all these
[46:12] churches you know they can have morning
[46:14] sunday school teachers and that's a
[46:15] blessing and if those it's beautiful if
[46:18] those sunday school teachers the women
[46:19] no matter how old are young if they
[46:23] just want to receive those children in
[46:25] the name of jesus to point them to jesus
[46:27] i'll say that this great is their reward
[46:29] amen because jesus said when you receive
[46:31] a child in my name you receive me
[46:34] hallelujah
[46:37] thank god
[46:40] verse 6 but who shall offend one of
[46:42] these little ones which believe in me
[46:44] it were better for him that a millstone
[46:46] were hanged about his neck and that they
[46:48] were drowned in the depth of the sea
[46:49] there's going to be a lot of people in
[46:51] hell because they mistreated children
[46:53] and that will just be a corrupt fruit
[46:55] that would just be a fruit of the
[46:56] wickedness that was already in their
[46:57] heart
[46:59] because anyone with natural affection
[47:00] anyone with any decency anyone with any
[47:03] honesty would look at a child as one of
[47:05] the greatest blessings there ever was
[47:08] because it's a functioning person it's
[47:10] there's there's uh it's a smiling hat
[47:12] and usually smiling happy child you know
[47:15] and brings so much joy like just like
[47:18] with zion he's learning how to talk it's
[47:19] so much fun like just hearing how to
[47:21] talk and
[47:22] and just all these blessings that come
[47:24] out you know
[47:25] as they grow and as they as they mature
[47:27] and as they come into what god made them
[47:29] to be
[47:31] in other words you see god's purity in a
[47:32] child you see god's beauty in a child
[47:34] amen you see god's power in a child
[47:37] hallelujah
[47:39] and so
[47:40] jesus when he's asked who's the greatest
[47:43] he finds the little child
[47:45] and says look up here
[47:47] whoever can humble himself like a little
[47:49] child that's who the greatest in the
[47:51] kingdom of heaven is amen in other words
[47:54] anyone can i say this anyone who can
[47:56] just lay in jesus's presence
[47:58] and just do what the holy spirit says do
[48:01] and not fight about it not fuss about it
[48:03] not debate about it well jesus you i
[48:06] think you should do this and said i
[48:07] think i should do that
[48:09] not to debate with the lord but just to
[48:11] be a humble child
[48:12] and sit in his presence and hear his
[48:14] word let him speak hallelujah amen
[48:18] he said he's the greatest in the kingdom
[48:20] of god
[48:22] now let's remember now let's go to the
[48:24] old testament who is the grace of the
[48:25] old testament
[48:27] john the baptist
[48:29] john the baptist was greater than enoch
[48:31] moses imagine that my goodness and he
[48:34] only had six months of ministry church
[48:36] that just struck me moses had 40 years
[48:40] abraham had from 75 to 175 abraham had
[48:43] 100 years
[48:44] of service to god
[48:46] and he's the father of the faith and
[48:47] he's still not the greatest
[48:50] because it's not a glory it's not about
[48:51] the number of years it's about the
[48:53] quality of service amen hallelujah oh
[48:56] there it is it's not always quantity
[48:58] it's quality hallelujah
[49:00] amen
[49:02] ah that just struck me right there amen
[49:05] hallelujah
[49:07] six months here we're in the fifth month
[49:09] of 2020 how's you how's your year been
[49:11] 2022. you've had a good year this could
[49:14] be a great year and this could be a
[49:15] great minute six months a ministry was
[49:18] greater than 40 years in a hundred years
[49:22] now what did he do though he forsook
[49:24] everything and he went out and lived in
[49:25] the wilderness
[49:28] to lay before the lord can i say it like
[49:29] that
[49:30] amen to be like a child
[49:34] to wait on the lord he didn't multiply
[49:36] women to himself like solomon and david
[49:38] did he
[49:40] glory amen he didn't exalt himself like
[49:43] moses look what i've done i'm bringing
[49:45] the water out of a rock you bunch of
[49:46] rebels
[49:48] now he rebuked the pharisees for sure
[49:52] six months of preaching and that
[49:53] probably said not one miracle other than
[49:55] the miracle of soul saved amen
[50:00] so church this is totally changing my
[50:01] whole idea around about who's the
[50:03] greatest
[50:05] it's not about how long you've served
[50:06] god
[50:08] it's about the quality of your service
[50:11] to god
[50:14] hallelujah
[50:16] and then brother baby said he was
[50:18] greatest also because he didn't just
[50:20] talk about jesus
[50:22] he introduced jesus amen amen he got to
[50:25] handle the word amen
[50:27] he held him he handled him praise god
[50:30] and look in the very presence of jesus
[50:31] he humbled himself he said he said i'm
[50:33] not the one that needs to baptize you
[50:35] you need to baptize me amen
[50:38] so when he was in the presence of god
[50:40] and flesh he humbled himself there as
[50:42] well
[50:43] and only did it because jesus said so
[50:45] like a child okay okay god i'm like a
[50:47] child whatever you say i'll do it
[50:50] so see church whenever we get the word
[50:52] of god and we just do what the word of
[50:53] god says that's like a child
[50:56] so whether it's through a sermon or
[50:58] whether it's just reading your bible at
[50:59] home
[51:01] wherever it is when you just get the
[51:03] word of god and you obey it that's a
[51:06] child
[51:07] hallelujah
[51:10] like i can tell my kid the kids in my
[51:11] class are gonna say take this down the
[51:12] office
[51:13] they'll say why i said because i said so
[51:16] and they'll just go okay mr smith okay
[51:19] you know whatever's in there it might be
[51:21] money in there or it might be notes in
[51:23] there they'll just do it
[51:24] they just do it they don't now sometimes
[51:26] they question but not all the time you
[51:27] know
[51:28] they're just simple if the word says it
[51:31] i believe it i'll do it
[51:33] jesus said if you want to be great in
[51:34] the kingdom of god hallelujah be like a
[51:37] child
[51:38] humble yourself like a child just sit
[51:40] there listen and then act on it and obey
[51:42] it praise god
[51:44] like what man said about those seraphim
[51:46] in heaven remember
[51:47] isaiah saw the seraphim it had six wings
[51:49] two on the face two wings and then two
[51:52] on the feet
[51:54] brother branham said the two on the on
[51:56] the face uh were reverence
[51:58] and reverse reverence means an
[52:00] admiration for god
[52:02] so catch this
[52:04] the one that faces i adore god i'm
[52:06] covering my face my wings are covered
[52:08] because i adore god
[52:12] so reverence is a key
[52:14] to being a real servant of god amen you
[52:16] have to adore god recognize how great he
[52:18] is what were the wings on the feet
[52:20] romans said that was humility because
[52:21] god said take off your shoes moses
[52:24] you're on holy ground amen
[52:27] what's humility it's a low idea of
[52:30] yourself
[52:32] so the face is a
[52:34] high idea about god
[52:36] humility is the esteem of yourself amen
[52:39] glory and what's the two wings he said
[52:42] in service in action in other words
[52:44] obeying the word of god hallelujah
[52:47] amen
[52:48] now you got a real christian right there
[52:50] praise god
[52:51] i got a real angel a real messenger from
[52:54] god amen
[52:55] one that thinks god is so great he's so
[52:58] great i admire me he's so mighty i
[53:00] reverence him one that thinks so little
[53:02] of yourself i'm nothing i can't do
[53:04] anything without god but then one that
[53:06] obeys the word and obeys the promises as
[53:08] in the action is doing the actions of
[53:11] obedience
[53:13] now we're on to something real there
[53:14] amen
[53:16] the seraphim speaks of your life
[53:19] and isn't sixth six was the number there
[53:21] six number of anointed man
[53:24] right adam sixth day
[53:26] totally holy
[53:27] you got six pieces of armor for the
[53:29] armor of god
[53:30] hallelujah thank god amen six wings
[53:35] reverence
[53:36] humility action
[53:39] that's a real servant of god
[53:42] let's all say let's say i'm a servant of
[53:44] god ready i'm a servant of god i'm a
[53:46] servant of god
[53:47] i'll reverence him he'll be so great
[53:49] i'll humble myself i'm nothing i don't
[53:51] have any power and ability but i will
[53:52] act upon his word
[53:54] amen i will serve god amen i will act
[53:58] upon the promises that he's revealed to
[54:00] me praise god
[54:02] remember you can't act on anything until
[54:04] god's first revealed it to you
[54:06] god has to reveal it to you first then
[54:08] you can act on it
[54:10] right like i don't know if i'm healed
[54:11] until god reveals and then i know i'm
[54:13] healed amen
[54:16] so we must wait on the lord even for
[54:17] that
[54:19] now here's the parallel passage so off
[54:21] of that now mark 10 15. verily i say
[54:24] unto you whosoever shall receive the
[54:26] kingdom of god as the little child
[54:30] shall not enter therein
[54:33] so a child
[54:34] quickly so the truth is then a child
[54:37] will quickly embrace what you say
[54:41] right they'll a child will quickly
[54:43] approve of what you say if you tell them
[54:45] something okay yes i receive it
[54:49] they'll quickly learn what you say now
[54:51] that's good or bad
[54:53] hopefully you'll get it for the most
[54:55] part and the child will get what you say
[54:59] so jesus says that's a child who's
[55:02] that's a humble child that's a humble
[55:04] servant of god you quickly approve of
[55:06] what god says
[55:09] you embrace what god says you can learn
[55:12] what god is saying hallelujah you can
[55:14] hear what the spirit says to the church
[55:16] amen
[55:17] hallelujah now i just was reading this
[55:20] commentary and john gill said
[55:22] he was commentating on this verse
[55:24] and he says this was verified so who's
[55:28] the greatest in the kingdom of god john
[55:29] gill thought paul now that's my belief
[55:31] too
[55:33] i believe paul was the great was the
[55:35] greatest christian there ever was that's
[55:37] my humble opinion
[55:39] i kind of felt like john gill vindicated
[55:41] that for me
[55:43] though he is not one of the twelve
[55:46] because in his own words he said i was
[55:48] the chief of sinners
[55:51] see because he blasphemed the lord
[55:52] before but he didn't know better
[55:56] he took he consented to the death of
[55:58] christians so now we know what the chief
[56:00] of sinners are
[56:01] they blaspheme the holy ghost they want
[56:03] christians to die that's the chief of
[56:05] sinners
[56:07] he said i'm also less than the least of
[56:11] all saints
[56:14] so he truly believed i'm the least of
[56:16] all of them
[56:18] right
[56:19] he said also said i'm not worthy to be
[56:21] called an apostle we said today i'm not
[56:23] worthy to be a preacher i could say that
[56:25] i'm not worthy of it
[56:28] all right we could all say i'm not
[56:29] worthy to be where god has placed me
[56:32] but that's what paul said i'm not worthy
[56:35] because of what i've done because of my
[56:36] past i'm not worthy on the lease of all
[56:38] of them
[56:41] yet john gill said too he had the
[56:43] largest measures of grace he had the
[56:46] greatest gifts and abilities he spoke in
[56:47] tongues more than everybody
[56:49] he prophesied he wrote church he wrote
[56:52] the bible that we'll be judged by
[56:55] john wesley didn't do that brother brahm
[56:57] didn't do that
[56:59] martin luther didn't do that
[57:01] the gospel that jesus gave paul will be
[57:04] what we are judged by that that's the
[57:06] law we'd say that that's the standard
[57:08] that we're judged by praise god the law
[57:10] of the holy spirit not legalism but the
[57:12] law of the holy spirit
[57:14] because there has to be a judgment
[57:15] standard somewhere
[57:17] or else grace is no more grace
[57:19] right
[57:20] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[57:22] abound god forbid
[57:25] how can we be that are dead to sin live
[57:27] and sin any longer praise god amen
[57:31] hallelujah
[57:33] gil said god honored paul with the
[57:36] greatest usefulness and success in the
[57:38] preaching of the gospel can you imagine
[57:40] what amen he would go into a city and
[57:41] just sit down
[57:43] at a river and there would be lydia and
[57:45] open up her heart to the lord and just a
[57:47] church would spring up out of there
[57:48] he'd go he'd leave he'd write a letter
[57:50] later and tell the philippians all about
[57:52] their lives and all about the godhead
[57:54] he go to colossae well i'm sorry he
[57:56] didn't go there timothy went to colossae
[57:58] uh the start of the church there praise
[58:00] god i'm sorry epiphanes epiphanes
[58:02] he'd stay there at ephesus and he
[58:03] started church in ephesus everywhere
[58:05] where this man went churches were
[58:07] starting praise god
[58:08] amen
[58:10] and his letters that he wrote to them
[58:11] were directly from jesus and we're still
[58:14] reading them today we're still gaining
[58:16] strength from them right now praise god
[58:19] and that's what will judge all of us
[58:21] that's what will judge brother branham
[58:24] that he preached what paul preached
[58:28] hallelujah
[58:30] now look this is and this is god's grace
[58:32] too this is god's grace paul exalted
[58:34] himself in pride so much
[58:36] right killing christians but then jesus
[58:38] humbled him so much
[58:39] so he was high he was brought low but
[58:42] then because of his obedience he was
[58:43] brought back high again
[58:45] amen but not in sinful pride but in holy
[58:48] honor that god gave him praise god
[58:52] because he gave his life away he could
[58:53] have married but he turned that down he
[58:55] said i got a gift not to marry
[58:58] i can just please the lord i can start
[58:59] all these churches i can write these
[59:00] letters and he gave his life as a
[59:02] sacrifice
[59:04] he planted all those churches and then
[59:06] he said at the end of his life he says
[59:08] i've labored more than they all not i
[59:10] but yet the grace of god that was in me
[59:12] praise god
[59:13] so even at the end he he gave all the
[59:16] credit to grace
[59:19] he gave all the credit to god's
[59:21] unmerited favor in other words god was
[59:23] giving him favor to start churches
[59:26] god was giving favor to write the word
[59:28] of god god was giving him favor to see
[59:30] visions and dream dreams and operating
[59:32] gifts god was giving that favor and he
[59:34] said it's not me it's god's grace
[59:37] that's how we should live amen
[59:40] when something good comes out of my life
[59:41] it was god's grace it wasn't me it was
[59:44] god's grace amen
[59:46] hallelujah
[59:48] if not then we get self-confident well
[59:50] hey look what i can do now i i'm a
[59:52] pretty good fellow now
[59:54] well i'm pretty good preacher i'm i'm a
[59:56] pretty good uh housewife
[59:59] i'm a pretty good worker
[1:00:01] i'm really something
[1:00:03] when we realize we're nothing we should
[1:00:05] realize we're nothing
[1:00:08] the greatest in the kingdom of heaven is
[1:00:10] like a child see that's where it is paul
[1:00:12] would just say lord he said lord where
[1:00:14] do you want me to go missionary work and
[1:00:15] god would say don't go to asia go over
[1:00:17] there to the city of corinth i've got
[1:00:19] men i've got much people in that city
[1:00:22] see he didn't as a child he didn't fight
[1:00:23] against god said no i'm going to asia
[1:00:25] there's there's millions there you know
[1:00:28] he followed the leadership of the holy
[1:00:29] spirit like a child would follow a
[1:00:31] parent
[1:00:33] praise god
[1:00:35] see just laying before the lord what
[1:00:37] does the child do they lay before the
[1:00:39] lay before jesus they lay before the
[1:00:41] parent and they just obey that's what
[1:00:42] they're supposed to do
[1:00:44] now you put enough cartoons in them
[1:00:45] they're not going to do that
[1:00:47] i've seen it
[1:00:48] put enough screens in front of them
[1:00:49] they're not going to do that
[1:00:51] they're going to fight you
[1:00:53] but even after a few days of school i
[1:00:54] can get them trained the right way you
[1:00:55] know where to they'll finally they'll
[1:00:57] finally do it by god's grace
[1:00:59] gotta take away the screen time though
[1:01:01] you gotta show you gotta show them love
[1:01:02] too
[1:01:03] gotta show them love
[1:01:05] now here's a second verse where jesus
[1:01:08] talks about being humble he that is
[1:01:10] greatest among you shall be your
[1:01:12] servant
[1:01:14] whosoever shall exalt himself
[1:01:16] god will abase
[1:01:18] god will bring them low
[1:01:21] and he that humble himself god shall
[1:01:23] exalt now before this it's really
[1:01:25] striking if you look at this is the
[1:01:27] chapter where jesus says he says eight
[1:01:29] woes to the pharisees
[1:01:30] he gives them eight woes in other words
[1:01:32] they're destined for hell they're
[1:01:34] destined for plagues at the white throne
[1:01:36] judgment
[1:01:38] before jesus said this he'd already
[1:01:40] rebuked the pharisees for saying things
[1:01:42] but not doing them
[1:01:45] church we don't want to make promises
[1:01:47] that we don't keep
[1:01:48] you and i are no better than our word
[1:01:52] if you say you're going to do something
[1:01:54] you better do it
[1:01:57] right because this was the this was the
[1:01:59] pharisees thing they would say well
[1:02:00] moses said this and that but then they
[1:02:02] wouldn't do it themselves
[1:02:04] that's called hypocrisy
[1:02:06] right actors acting like they believed
[1:02:08] moses when really they didn't believe
[1:02:10] moses
[1:02:13] that's why when preachers say something
[1:02:15] let's let's have the preachers do what
[1:02:16] they say
[1:02:17] they need to do what they say
[1:02:20] because jesus is rebuking preachers
[1:02:23] and then he's saying well they must have
[1:02:26] they must have exalted themselves so now
[1:02:27] jesus is humbling them
[1:02:32] and these lazy preachers won't move a
[1:02:34] finger to help others burdens
[1:02:37] they see the burns out there but they
[1:02:38] won't do nothing
[1:02:41] at church we got cell phones we can at
[1:02:42] least do something we can at least do
[1:02:44] something with our finger i'm praying
[1:02:45] for you we can at least text people that
[1:02:47] right i mean we can do something with
[1:02:49] our fingers amen do something but they
[1:02:51] wouldn't even move a finger
[1:02:55] in other words they were all talk and no
[1:02:57] action
[1:02:59] may god help us to be talk and action
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:03] reverence humility action amen
[1:03:06] hallelujah now we can't do everything
[1:03:08] right we can't do ever can't help every
[1:03:10] person in the earth but we can act on
[1:03:12] some people's behalf
[1:03:14] right the bible says have compassion on
[1:03:16] some not everybody you can't have
[1:03:18] compassion on everybody else you never
[1:03:20] get any sleep you never go to work you
[1:03:22] just be you just be having compassion
[1:03:23] all the time and you run out of
[1:03:25] resources real fast but have compassion
[1:03:27] on some and make a difference in
[1:03:29] somebody's life amen
[1:03:33] and they only did public works they
[1:03:35] didn't do anything in private it was all
[1:03:36] about
[1:03:37] see me i'm a show watch my life i'm just
[1:03:40] putting on a show
[1:03:43] it was all about
[1:03:45] public works they loved the public seats
[1:03:49] and public greetings
[1:03:52] now this is one thing i never learned
[1:03:53] they love to be called rabbi this is my
[1:03:55] great one
[1:03:56] i never knew that i was like what so
[1:03:59] they would say oh my great one how are
[1:04:01] you the great one
[1:04:02] oh they love the people called it call
[1:04:04] me great call me and we're going to show
[1:04:06] this at the end call me great call me
[1:04:07] great
[1:04:08] oh yeah call me rabbi
[1:04:10] call me rabbi i'm the great one they
[1:04:12] love to hear you're so great you're so
[1:04:14] great you're so great
[1:04:17] and yet they wouldn't lift a finger to
[1:04:18] help out anybody
[1:04:20] they were rich and increase with goods
[1:04:22] and didn't have need of any more of god
[1:04:27] and jesus says don't be like them
[1:04:30] they've exalted themselves you be humble
[1:04:33] praise god
[1:04:37] or my honorable sir
[1:04:42] i just came i couldn't believe that
[1:04:44] my dear honorable sir preacher pastor
[1:04:47] you've got to call me that
[1:04:50] or else you're not addressing me the
[1:04:51] right way in public
[1:04:53] i don't care if you call me pastor in
[1:04:54] public brother brother jesse i don't
[1:04:56] care what you call me just call me just
[1:04:58] call me a christian that's how i want to
[1:04:59] be hey man just call me your brother
[1:05:01] call me a christian that's all i want to
[1:05:03] be
[1:05:04] i know i'm not great praise god i'll let
[1:05:06] we'll let god be the judge of that
[1:05:08] amen hallelujah let's say it again god
[1:05:11] will be the judge of who's greatest
[1:05:12] among us
[1:05:14] amen let's not exalt ourselves with that
[1:05:17] type of uh pride i'll say like that that
[1:05:20] type of flattery
[1:05:22] the flattering tongue worketh ruin i
[1:05:24] learned that i learned that even before
[1:05:26] i come to the message
[1:05:28] when i first became a christian back in
[1:05:29] 2000 i started reading my niv bible now
[1:05:32] i don't know how i i don't know how i
[1:05:33] made it brother i'll be honest it was
[1:05:34] god's grace
[1:05:37] but i read in there that flattering
[1:05:38] titles and proverbs will worketh ruin
[1:05:41] in other words when somebody comes up
[1:05:42] and flatters you and tells you how great
[1:05:44] you are
[1:05:45] and you know they're going overboard
[1:05:46] with it
[1:05:48] that will cause you to fall they're
[1:05:50] trying to exalt you so that you'll fall
[1:05:52] to exalt themselves
[1:05:57] right and i had friends on the college
[1:05:58] scene before i come to the message that
[1:06:00] i felt like that would try to you know
[1:06:01] you know how i do it you know you know
[1:06:02] how i know that they'd say all this
[1:06:04] exalting and then they want to wrestle
[1:06:05] me in front of all the the girls you
[1:06:07] know to like show them how strong they
[1:06:09] were i'm like this don't work here like
[1:06:13] you're exalt me over here but now you're
[1:06:14] trying to beat me up you know
[1:06:16] in other words they're trying to get my
[1:06:17] guard down
[1:06:18] because they like to wrestle and
[1:06:20] headlocks and
[1:06:21] show off you know
[1:06:23] well i was probably just as sinful as
[1:06:24] they were you know many ways but i knew
[1:06:26] something's wrong with that why are you
[1:06:27] exalting me
[1:06:29] in private and then to my face and then
[1:06:31] trying to fight me over here and exalt
[1:06:33] yourself above me over there
[1:06:37] of us we've been through some things in
[1:06:39] denominations
[1:06:41] we've been through some things in the
[1:06:42] message church too amen
[1:06:44] you know you've got to thank god god's
[1:06:46] he's allowing it all for a purpose
[1:06:50] you're to learn all along the way learn
[1:06:52] along the journey
[1:06:54] you're going to find faults in me you're
[1:06:55] going to find faults in our church
[1:06:56] there's faults everywhere praise god as
[1:06:58] soon as you if there's no fault there as
[1:06:59] soon as you get there you're the fault
[1:07:01] in the cherishing you've heard it said
[1:07:03] of course there's no perfect church
[1:07:04] anyway
[1:07:06] except the one that's over by the blood
[1:07:07] they already got new bodies that's the
[1:07:08] only perfect church praise god
[1:07:11] but see after all these prideful things
[1:07:14] jesus says the greatest will be
[1:07:17] the servant
[1:07:19] not the one who's called call me rabbi
[1:07:22] call me
[1:07:23] call me
[1:07:24] your most noble excellent brother
[1:07:27] call me the great one when you greet me
[1:07:29] and yet they're not doing any they won't
[1:07:30] even move a finger to
[1:07:32] slide somebody a 20 bill right and when
[1:07:34] you move a finger
[1:07:35] won't even do that
[1:07:37] they won't do nothing
[1:07:39] they just want glory
[1:07:41] they just want worship
[1:07:43] because jesus said you're of your father
[1:07:44] the devil
[1:07:46] is that right
[1:07:47] that's right
[1:07:48] so look at this so in one the first case
[1:07:51] they asked who's the greatest he says
[1:07:52] child
[1:07:54] the second case he rebukes all these
[1:07:56] religious people and said who's the
[1:07:58] greatest the servant's the greatest
[1:08:01] not the one who gets all the public
[1:08:02] praise
[1:08:04] that's why church brother adam said this
[1:08:05] and it was so inspired there's gonna be
[1:08:07] a lot of surprises on the day of
[1:08:09] judgment
[1:08:11] the bible says some men's sins go before
[1:08:13] them others men's sins are known on this
[1:08:15] side we only know about the ones whose
[1:08:17] sins are on this side
[1:08:19] we don't know the ones that were hidden
[1:08:22] we'll find out over there
[1:08:24] so what what should we do then brother
[1:08:26] jesse repent every single service
[1:08:28] repent every single day
[1:08:30] make sure your sins are blotted out amen
[1:08:32] glory so there's no sins to go before
[1:08:35] you amen because they're all under the
[1:08:36] blood they're all buried in the sea of
[1:08:39] forgetfulness hallelujah so there can be
[1:08:41] no sins go before me amen
[1:08:44] it's just mercy it's just forgiveness
[1:08:46] that goes before me hallelujah the lord
[1:08:48] goes before me amen
[1:08:50] hallelujah
[1:08:55] granted jesus
[1:08:57] that will humble ourselves
[1:08:59] and constantly repent
[1:09:02] that we do not get exalted with pride
[1:09:06] next one is luke 14 7. i'm going to go
[1:09:08] and turn there you can turn there if you
[1:09:09] like you don't have to
[1:09:11] bless you
[1:09:14] 14 7 through 14. here jesus gives two
[1:09:17] illustrations for being humble
[1:09:21] so let's see if we can understand this
[1:09:22] and how it may relate to our lives and
[1:09:25] he put forth the parable to that to
[1:09:26] those which were bit when he marked how
[1:09:28] they chose out the chief rooms saying to
[1:09:30] them when our when thou art bitten of
[1:09:32] any man to a wedding sit not down in the
[1:09:34] highest room lest a more honorable man
[1:09:37] than thou be bitten of him and he that
[1:09:39] made thee and him come and say unto thee
[1:09:41] give this man place and thou begin with
[1:09:44] shame to take the lowest room
[1:09:47] but when thou art bidding go and sit
[1:09:48] down in the lowest room that when he
[1:09:51] that obeyed thee cometh he may say unto
[1:09:53] thee friend go up higher
[1:09:55] then shalt thou have worship in the
[1:09:57] friends of them that sit at meat with
[1:09:58] thee
[1:10:00] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[1:10:02] a base and he that humbleth himself
[1:10:04] shall be exalted
[1:10:07] so
[1:10:08] in jesus day
[1:10:10] uh
[1:10:11] public feasts in in places was a very
[1:10:13] big thing not so much today right not so
[1:10:15] much today like i was even thinking
[1:10:17] yesterday you go to a wedding the places
[1:10:18] are already picked out for you right
[1:10:19] went to that wedding they're already
[1:10:21] picked out for you we know the seats of
[1:10:23] honor the seats of honor are for the
[1:10:24] husband and wife this is their day and
[1:10:26] they should be honored
[1:10:28] if they've honored god and they've put
[1:10:29] god first and they've lived holy lives
[1:10:31] they should be honored right up there
[1:10:33] and then the family should be honored
[1:10:34] because mom and dad put up with them all
[1:10:36] those years
[1:10:37] before they got saved
[1:10:39] they should have a place of honor
[1:10:41] but you know weddings for us that
[1:10:42] doesn't really apply to us because we
[1:10:43] don't pick out the seats
[1:10:45] so we'd have to use a place where where
[1:10:47] do we get to choose the seats
[1:10:51] and in all those situations we should
[1:10:53] choose with the mindset of i'm going to
[1:10:55] choose the most humble place
[1:10:58] right
[1:11:00] so going out to eat or fellowshipping
[1:11:02] you know
[1:11:03] choose a humble place now our room is so
[1:11:05] small over there i don't think there is
[1:11:06] a highest seat over there i don't think
[1:11:08] there is
[1:11:09] if you know it let me know because i
[1:11:11] don't see one in there
[1:11:12] there's really not a good seat in there
[1:11:18] so i'm just trying to think how can that
[1:11:19] apply to us well just anytime you're at
[1:11:21] a church fellowship outside of our
[1:11:22] church
[1:11:24] where there's a big place to eat you
[1:11:25] know
[1:11:28] now when we go out to eat another public
[1:11:29] place i like to sit by the brothers if i
[1:11:31] can you know because
[1:11:32] i just you know i think that's a godly
[1:11:33] thing to do you know you don't really
[1:11:34] want to try to sit if i'm a married man
[1:11:36] i don't want to try to sit with married
[1:11:37] women you know i'm going to try to sit
[1:11:38] with the brothers you know that's a
[1:11:40] that's a godly that's a holy thing to do
[1:11:41] praise god
[1:11:44] so that part of our life you know uh
[1:11:47] it's not the same now jesus moves on to
[1:11:49] a part where we can we can definitely do
[1:11:52] this one
[1:11:53] verse 12 then said he also to him that
[1:11:55] bade him when thou makest a dinner or
[1:11:57] supper call not thy friends nor thy
[1:11:59] brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy
[1:12:01] rich neighbors lest they also bid thee
[1:12:03] again and recompense be made thee but
[1:12:05] when thou make us a feast called the
[1:12:07] poor the man the lot the lit i'm sorry
[1:12:09] the maimed the lame and blind and thou
[1:12:12] shalt be blessed for they cannot
[1:12:14] recompense thee for thou shalt be
[1:12:16] recompensed at the resurrection of the
[1:12:18] just now in those days it was very
[1:12:20] common if someone come to your door and
[1:12:21] knock it was hospitality was very
[1:12:23] important in those days and you every
[1:12:25] time you let them in
[1:12:27] every time there was no like jesus told
[1:12:28] a parable if somebody come ask you at
[1:12:30] midnight for food because you've got to
[1:12:31] guess jesus said because you love them
[1:12:33] you open your door you'll give them food
[1:12:35] even at midnight now somebody come
[1:12:36] knocking down my my house at midnight i
[1:12:38] can't promise i'd open
[1:12:40] because i turn off my phone i don't i
[1:12:42] want to sleep that's my time to sleep
[1:12:45] i got a lot to do tomorrow
[1:12:47] but those days are different you know
[1:12:49] those days were different
[1:12:52] but here you know and and uh so the the
[1:12:54] poor would just walk out on the streets
[1:12:56] and so anytime the poor could knock and
[1:12:58] want to come in
[1:12:59] and so you would have people in all the
[1:13:01] time visiting well that's not our it's
[1:13:02] not our american life is not like that
[1:13:05] you know we all live in nice parts of
[1:13:07] nice parts of akron or our different
[1:13:09] towns we live in you know and there's
[1:13:11] not people there's not beggars walking
[1:13:13] by your house all the time is there
[1:13:15] probably not
[1:13:18] so in this case uh like i said in this
[1:13:20] case
[1:13:21] i don't invite them to my house but i
[1:13:23] can take a meal to them
[1:13:26] in other words what i take from this
[1:13:27] since i don't have beggars walking by my
[1:13:29] house and i'm glad i don't you know in
[1:13:31] some ways
[1:13:33] what i take from this is that i want to
[1:13:35] give food to others i want to give
[1:13:37] people money that can't pay me back amen
[1:13:40] that's the main idea here i'm not giving
[1:13:42] to get back i'm giving to be a blessing
[1:13:45] because i know the father will give it
[1:13:46] back amen amen because when you lend to
[1:13:49] the lord well i'm sorry when you went to
[1:13:50] the land of the poor you lend to the
[1:13:51] lord praise god so jesus is looking at
[1:13:54] the heart of it
[1:13:56] your heart your heart's got to be in it
[1:13:58] i don't want a rich person to invite me
[1:14:00] over that's not what i want that's not
[1:14:01] why i'm doing this i'm doing it because
[1:14:03] i see poor uh
[1:14:05] crippled people hurt people and i want
[1:14:06] to be a blessing to them praise god
[1:14:11] so eastern life was way different from
[1:14:13] western life
[1:14:15] but the the principles the same
[1:14:18] i want to give to someone who can't give
[1:14:20] back to me
[1:14:23] and then jesus says great is your reward
[1:14:25] in heaven
[1:14:26] because then you're like your father in
[1:14:27] heaven who gives to the just the unjust
[1:14:30] to the thankful and the unthankful
[1:14:33] then you become like god
[1:14:35] let's go to luke 18 verse 9.
[1:14:38] so these are all portions where jesus
[1:14:40] christ tells us about what is pride
[1:14:42] versus what is humility
[1:14:45] in verses 9 through 17 and luke 18 he
[1:14:48] gives us two more illustrations for
[1:14:49] being humble public prayer and again he
[1:14:52] goes back to a
[1:14:54] child luke 18 9.
[1:15:01] and he spake this parable unto certain
[1:15:03] which trusted in themselves that they
[1:15:05] were righteous and despised others now
[1:15:07] look at that church look at this it's
[1:15:08] real important that we don't miss this
[1:15:11] we cannot trust in our own righteousness
[1:15:15] my wife and i were talking about this
[1:15:16] yesterday the longer you serve god the
[1:15:19] closer you get to going to heaven
[1:15:21] in other words the longer you serve god
[1:15:23] the closer you get to the light
[1:15:25] and the closer i get to the light the
[1:15:27] more
[1:15:28] uh the more scars i see
[1:15:31] right the more the more mistakes and
[1:15:33] blemishes oh there's a blemish there
[1:15:35] blemish there i got a freckle there you
[1:15:37] know
[1:15:38] the closer you get to god and jose could
[1:15:41] say amen to this i'm sure you know in
[1:15:42] beatrice you know and bertha
[1:15:44] the closer you get to god the more you
[1:15:46] realize i have no righteousness
[1:15:49] when you're young you got strength and
[1:15:51] you can get up early and you can just do
[1:15:52] everything you want to do because you're
[1:15:53] strong
[1:15:56] you feel like wow i'm really something
[1:15:58] no wonder god uses me
[1:16:02] but as you get older you get weaker and
[1:16:04] tired amen
[1:16:06] and you don't have the same strength but
[1:16:08] you're at the same time you're getting
[1:16:10] closer to the light amen
[1:16:12] and you realize anything good that was
[1:16:13] in my life it was because of god and
[1:16:16] it's not my righteousness that god used
[1:16:18] me it was to glorify his righteousness
[1:16:20] he used me
[1:16:24] so jesus tells a story not to trust in
[1:16:27] what you can do
[1:16:29] your goodness
[1:16:31] now this this hits home for me because i
[1:16:33] i really do i really desire to fast but
[1:16:35] these guys were fastened too and jesus
[1:16:37] said they left the church they were not
[1:16:39] forgiven
[1:16:42] so see just because we fast doesn't mean
[1:16:44] we're holy
[1:16:46] in the church there i thought i'd get a
[1:16:47] couple more emails today
[1:16:49] as much as i preach i'm fasting
[1:16:53] if
[1:16:54] the only way it benefits you if it's
[1:16:55] done with the right spirit
[1:16:59] everything must be done with the right
[1:17:01] spirit
[1:17:05] two men went up into the temple to pray
[1:17:07] the one a pharisee and the other
[1:17:08] republican now let me stop there
[1:17:10] remember the pharisees they had their
[1:17:11] own mission or they had their own
[1:17:12] interpretation of what moses said they
[1:17:14] basically were like the mormons they had
[1:17:16] their own bible to interpret the bible
[1:17:19] okay
[1:17:20] and remember simon brought that good
[1:17:22] thought out they basically said if you
[1:17:24] don't wash your hands you're the same as
[1:17:26] you should you should die because you
[1:17:27] don't follow our traditions i thought
[1:17:29] that was a really good thought no wonder
[1:17:30] they're arguing jesus why don't your
[1:17:32] disciples wash their hands
[1:17:34] because that was a creed that meant so
[1:17:35] much to them that was a self-righteous
[1:17:37] legalistic creed it meant so much to
[1:17:39] them and jesus said the bible don't even
[1:17:40] say that amen
[1:17:44] he says why do you they they accuse
[1:17:46] jesus why are you transgressing the
[1:17:48] traditions of men and jesus said why are
[1:17:49] you transgressing the tradition of god
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] i'd rather transgress the tradition of
[1:17:56] men rather than the tradition of god
[1:17:58] amen
[1:17:59] hallelujah in other words let me obey
[1:18:01] every word of god i don't care what men
[1:18:03] or women think or denominations or
[1:18:04] churches i only care what god says
[1:18:07] hallelujah
[1:18:13] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[1:18:15] himself now look he prayed with himself
[1:18:17] he wasn't praying with god
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] god i thank thee that i am not as other
[1:18:23] men are
[1:18:25] extortioners unjust
[1:18:27] adulterers or even as this publican i
[1:18:30] fast twice a week
[1:18:33] i give tithes of all that i possess
[1:18:38] amen he said that's his prayer
[1:18:41] all right that's his prayer
[1:18:42] god thank you that i'm not an adulterer
[1:18:44] thank you that i don't steal from people
[1:18:46] thank you that i fast and pray and thank
[1:18:47] you i'm not like this poor wicked person
[1:18:49] over here and yet he had all those
[1:18:51] wicked sins like washing his hands he
[1:18:53] believed all these creeds of men
[1:18:55] so he wasn't so holy like you thought
[1:18:57] was he
[1:18:58] at the same time he must have hated
[1:19:00] jesus because all the pharisees hated
[1:19:01] jesus
[1:19:03] thank god that i can do all these things
[1:19:06] and thank god i'm not like this other
[1:19:07] guy over here
[1:19:11] see it's not about even what you do it's
[1:19:13] about the heart that you do it with
[1:19:16] because jesus said when when the
[1:19:17] bridegroom is gone then will my servants
[1:19:20] fast
[1:19:21] so jesus servants will fast but they do
[1:19:24] it with the right attitude
[1:19:26] they do it with the right motivation i'm
[1:19:28] fat i'm depriving my body of food that
[1:19:31] my soul can receive spiritual food
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] not so i'm going to fast because i'm
[1:19:38] better than this guy at church
[1:19:41] i'm fast because i'm i'm going to fast
[1:19:43] so i'm better than this sister
[1:19:46] that's why they fasted
[1:19:49] they purposely did that
[1:19:53] and see while they're fast and they
[1:19:54] won't they won't even push a finger to
[1:19:55] help somebody they won't even push a
[1:19:57] finger
[1:19:58] then when you lift a finger to maybe
[1:19:59] hand them a coin
[1:20:01] it won't even do that in their
[1:20:04] traditions and creeds of men
[1:20:07] can everybody say amen
[1:20:11] remember jesus said they love to make
[1:20:13] long prayers at the church
[1:20:15] so everybody can hear him say
[1:20:17] man the right way
[1:20:20] holy father
[1:20:23] oh my
[1:20:24] i get those echoes of that catholic
[1:20:26] church when brother uh
[1:20:27] william and i went there
[1:20:29] i'm like i better not try to mimic it
[1:20:31] you know
[1:20:32] it sound bad
[1:20:34] so one guy goes up and he prays
[1:20:36] basically to himself
[1:20:38] goodness
[1:20:40] thank god i'm so good
[1:20:42] thank god i'm not like these sinners
[1:20:44] over here
[1:20:46] and yet this guy was full of creeds full
[1:20:48] of hatred for jesus all these things
[1:20:51] he hated the message of the hour there
[1:20:52] it is right there amen hallelujah he
[1:20:55] despised the message of the hour
[1:20:57] and god's
[1:20:58] prophet hallelujah
[1:21:01] yet fasting twice a week paying tithes
[1:21:04] every time you it's a good thing you do
[1:21:05] pay ties we couldn't have this place if
[1:21:07] you don't make times
[1:21:08] we can do a lot of things if we don't
[1:21:09] pay tithes amen
[1:21:13] but see he was
[1:21:15] it was all show it was all public show
[1:21:18] oh there it is the bible said uh
[1:21:20] remember the bible said you should not
[1:21:21] uh commend yourselves by by yourselves
[1:21:24] you shouldn't judge yourself by other
[1:21:26] people just judge yourself by the word
[1:21:29] of god
[1:21:30] amen remember i showed that scripture
[1:21:32] from paul
[1:21:33] it's it's wrong he said how dare any of
[1:21:35] you commend yourselves by yourselves
[1:21:38] in other words i shouldn't look at
[1:21:39] brother amen's life for brother austin's
[1:21:40] life and say lord thank god i'm not
[1:21:42] doing like them and they shouldn't do
[1:21:43] that to me
[1:21:45] right we don't judge ourselves by
[1:21:46] ourselves we all judge ourselves we all
[1:21:49] look in the mirror of god's word and say
[1:21:50] this is what i'm striving to be make me
[1:21:53] more like jesus amen
[1:21:57] well i know i fast uh i know i fast more
[1:21:59] than zion so i'm doing good i'm doing
[1:22:01] real good there
[1:22:06] but that's how they come to church right
[1:22:08] thank god i don't do it like them i'm so
[1:22:10] much better
[1:22:12] there it is greatness again
[1:22:14] always about how great i am
[1:22:16] i tell the brother i sent a brother a
[1:22:18] message this week and i said
[1:22:21] and in this message he said
[1:22:24] he said jess he said you're the best
[1:22:27] now that made me feel good that i'm like
[1:22:31] i'm nothing
[1:22:32] so i sent a message back and i said
[1:22:34] i said and this is a good thought here
[1:22:37] one time i heard brother donnie reagan
[1:22:39] preach
[1:22:40] i've loved a lot of things about brother
[1:22:41] downey's ministry
[1:22:43] and he was just starting the service he
[1:22:45] said friends he said he said we need the
[1:22:46] grace of god he said friends what if all
[1:22:48] of our evil thoughts from this week
[1:22:50] could be put up on the screen he said
[1:22:52] how many of us would be here in the
[1:22:53] service
[1:22:55] like if i put up your evil thoughts this
[1:22:57] week would you want to come back to
[1:22:58] church
[1:23:01] if i put my evil thoughts up here she
[1:23:03] could see the thoughts would i want to
[1:23:04] come to church no i'd be i'd be sick
[1:23:08] i couldn't make it that service
[1:23:11] i thought wow what wisdom
[1:23:13] what wisdom
[1:23:16] because we all fall short of god's glory
[1:23:19] i texted that brother back i said
[1:23:20] brother
[1:23:22] i'm nothing i said if any good thing
[1:23:24] comes out of my life it was jesus he
[1:23:26] gets the credit he finally got he kind
[1:23:28] of he chased me he spanked me spanking
[1:23:30] his mate me until i finally listened to
[1:23:31] him
[1:23:33] because i said in my flesh dwells no
[1:23:35] good thing
[1:23:37] and my mind is a battlefield
[1:23:39] amen constant death and destruction
[1:23:42] going on and
[1:23:43] just blowing
[1:23:44] not the right thoughts you want to have
[1:23:46] amen all the time
[1:23:51] wars and rumors of wars
[1:23:53] wars in the mind i mean just it's an
[1:23:54] awful place sometimes
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:58] i wouldn't want my thoughts projected up
[1:24:00] on the screen all the time
[1:24:03] i probably and i told that brother i
[1:24:04] said i probably wouldn't have many
[1:24:05] friends
[1:24:07] i probably my children probably wouldn't
[1:24:08] like me very much
[1:24:09] and my wife probably wouldn't like me
[1:24:10] very much and my church probably
[1:24:12] wouldn't like me very much you know
[1:24:13] because i'm human church
[1:24:14] we're all human
[1:24:16] all of us shouldn't be able to say amen
[1:24:18] to that amen
[1:24:21] if we shared what we actually thought
[1:24:25] oh my
[1:24:27] thank god for the blood of jesus amen
[1:24:29] that's all i'm saying
[1:24:31] see even this week you know you know
[1:24:32] people say nice things that i try and
[1:24:34] then the holy spirit i feel good but the
[1:24:35] holy spirit says no
[1:24:37] don't feel good
[1:24:39] you're
[1:24:39] you're not
[1:24:40] and that's true
[1:24:42] i'm not none of us are
[1:24:46] but this guy at church is like i fast
[1:24:48] twice a week i pay tithes thank god i'm
[1:24:51] not like this guy
[1:24:53] let's finish that parable
[1:24:55] luke 18.
[1:24:57] i closed my bible on accident sorry i
[1:24:59] have to find my place again
[1:25:04] luke 18.
[1:25:09] these are simple but powerful truths the
[1:25:11] lord jesus gives us
[1:25:14] verse 13 the public is standing afar off
[1:25:16] now look he wouldn't even stand close to
[1:25:18] this guy he was so humble
[1:25:20] he was so devastated by his sins amen
[1:25:24] he couldn't get close to these people
[1:25:26] this guy that the people thought was
[1:25:27] holy this holy god
[1:25:31] even his position showed he was a humble
[1:25:33] person
[1:25:36] would not even so lift up his eyes to
[1:25:37] have you ever feel like that you ever
[1:25:38] feel so low you can't even lift your
[1:25:40] head to heaven
[1:25:41] because you're ashamed of yourself
[1:25:44] he wouldn't lift up his eyes to heaven
[1:25:45] because he was so ashamed of himself
[1:25:49] but smote upon the breast now see it
[1:25:51] became physical glory it hurt his sins
[1:25:54] hurt him so much it became physical he
[1:25:56] had to just hit himself
[1:25:57] god you know it
[1:25:59] he was so
[1:26:00] burdened by his sin
[1:26:02] he wanted just to feel he wanted to feel
[1:26:04] like a physical
[1:26:06] want to give like a physical sign god
[1:26:07] you feel you feel the hurting that's
[1:26:09] inside of me you know you know i mean
[1:26:12] business this hurts
[1:26:14] i've sinned against heaven
[1:26:18] he beat upon his breast and saying god
[1:26:20] be merciful to me a sinner
[1:26:24] now which guy did jesus forgive
[1:26:29] thank god i'm not an adulterer thank god
[1:26:31] i'm not a murderer thank god i'm not a
[1:26:33] cusser
[1:26:34] ain't got an i'm not a murderer
[1:26:36] murdering babies
[1:26:39] yet would have all these other sins
[1:26:41] that they can hide
[1:26:45] verse 14. i tell you
[1:26:48] this man went down to the house
[1:26:50] justified rather than the other for
[1:26:52] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[1:26:54] abased and he that humbleth himself
[1:26:56] shall be exalted and the church said
[1:27:00] so what do you how do you pray when you
[1:27:01] come to church let me just bring it down
[1:27:03] to us how should i pray when i come to
[1:27:05] church oh god thank you that i fasted
[1:27:08] this week thank you that i preached five
[1:27:10] times this week thank you god
[1:27:13] it's really it's it's insane to think
[1:27:15] that
[1:27:19] now there's a way there's a way there's
[1:27:20] another side there's a way to say thank
[1:27:22] like if you're crying weep and saying
[1:27:23] thank god i don't cuss anymore thank god
[1:27:26] but this guy was purposely comparing
[1:27:27] himself to that guy like looking down on
[1:27:29] him in pride
[1:27:32] he was exalting himself oh i'm not like
[1:27:33] this little this low sinner way far off
[1:27:35] there look how great i am look how holy
[1:27:37] i am
[1:27:42] humility
[1:27:43] jesus says this guy that beats himself
[1:27:46] on the chest he's going to be exalted
[1:27:47] churchill let me say like this maybe not
[1:27:49] in this life
[1:27:51] but he'll be exalted in heaven
[1:27:52] hallelujah amen
[1:27:55] because not everybody hallelujah brother
[1:27:58] bang gets exalted on this side amen
[1:28:02] sometimes the exalting is saved for
[1:28:04] later
[1:28:06] hallelujah
[1:28:09] that's exactly right
[1:28:10] how about the rich how about the beggar
[1:28:12] lazarus was he exalted on this side
[1:28:14] jesus said if you humble yourself you'll
[1:28:16] be exalted was he exalted not on this
[1:28:17] side no he died as a beggar
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:23] he died as a beggar oh i tell you he was
[1:28:26] exalted when the angels dropped him down
[1:28:28] and took him right in the bosom of
[1:28:30] abraham and he could just lay there can
[1:28:31] i see your lap buddy oh father abraham
[1:28:34] thank you hallelujah that was the time
[1:28:37] he was exalted i'd rather have that than
[1:28:40] man's empty praise amen
[1:28:42] hallelujah amen
[1:28:46] the exalting will not always take place
[1:28:49] on this side but you've got to trust in
[1:28:51] god humble me lord humble me and i know
[1:28:53] you'll exhaust me when i'm ready for it
[1:28:55] praise god
[1:29:01] this is the son of god
[1:29:03] talking about humility
[1:29:06] and pride
[1:29:08] so now we've got four illustrations on
[1:29:09] how to be humble
[1:29:11] choose the lowest seats
[1:29:14] give food to people that will cannot can
[1:29:16] never pay you back that means they're
[1:29:17] always going to be poor their whole life
[1:29:19] god has something rich god has some poor
[1:29:21] church i just realized god just made me
[1:29:23] rich compared to most people and as an
[1:29:25] american i am so rich
[1:29:27] i have every meal i need i mean
[1:29:30] we're so rich
[1:29:32] we're so rich
[1:29:34] so that means god has chosen you to be
[1:29:36] rich and when you're chosen to be rich
[1:29:38] then you've got to be generous praise
[1:29:39] god
[1:29:41] it's mandatory you we must be generous
[1:29:44] hallelujah
[1:29:46] because you were chosen to be rich
[1:29:51] don't raise your hands but how many of
[1:29:52] you have missed meals because you had no
[1:29:54] money
[1:30:01] i doubt anybody has i mean maybe maybe
[1:30:03] down in
[1:30:04] el salvador
[1:30:09] probably not
[1:30:12] just it's just for perspective church
[1:30:14] it's just it's just for our humbling
[1:30:15] purposes to think about these things
[1:30:21] and then public prayer again can show if
[1:30:23] we're humble or prideful
[1:30:26] and then a child
[1:30:29] verse 15 and they brought unto him also
[1:30:31] infants that he would touch them but
[1:30:32] when his disciples saw it they rebuked
[1:30:34] him i'm sorry rebuke them but jesus
[1:30:37] called them unto him and said suffer
[1:30:39] little children to come unto me and
[1:30:40] forbid them not for of such is of the
[1:30:42] kingdom of heaven verily i say unto you
[1:30:44] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:30:46] of god as a little child shall no wise
[1:30:48] enter therein
[1:30:50] just receive just accept just embrace
[1:30:53] the kingdom of god just like a child
[1:30:55] would
[1:31:01] praise god in other words if god has
[1:31:02] something written his word just believe
[1:31:04] it
[1:31:06] right now some things are conditional we
[1:31:08] remember that last week
[1:31:09] but if you know it's an unconditional
[1:31:11] promise like pride and humility it's
[1:31:12] unconditional right
[1:31:14] there's no conditions where god wants
[1:31:15] you prideful and the church said
[1:31:17] none
[1:31:18] like tithes and offerings there's no
[1:31:19] condition where god wants you to rob him
[1:31:21] right
[1:31:22] that's unconditional
[1:31:24] you must give tithes you must give
[1:31:25] offerings you must do these things right
[1:31:28] so if the bible simply says it then
[1:31:30] let's just believe it
[1:31:32] receive it do it act upon it praise god
[1:31:36] that's humble christianity and i'm
[1:31:38] saying like this it's the only kind of
[1:31:39] christianity
[1:31:42] hallelujah i haven't been keeping track
[1:31:44] how long ago so i'm not going to worry
[1:31:46] about it today
[1:31:48] my body's off
[1:31:50] i'm all i'm all relaxed here today
[1:31:52] praise god mark 7 14.
[1:31:54] now here's the beautiful i mentioned
[1:31:56] this in the prayer this scripture is on
[1:31:57] my heart
[1:31:59] mark 7 14.
[1:32:02] church when we catch ourselves and let
[1:32:04] me let me be honest and if you catch
[1:32:06] yourself this week and you will
[1:32:08] if you catch yourself being prideful
[1:32:10] this week and you will
[1:32:13] we just have to remember this is coming
[1:32:15] out of a part of me that's not yet holy
[1:32:18] but one day
[1:32:19] it will be holy
[1:32:22] and one day there will be no more pride
[1:32:24] that comes out of this being amen
[1:32:28] pride you just got a short time to dwell
[1:32:30] but after that you're gone buddy
[1:32:32] not buddy you're gone evil
[1:32:34] you're gone evil one
[1:32:36] you wicked one
[1:32:38] that's sin nature
[1:32:41] mark 7 14.
[1:32:45] uh this is jesus again
[1:32:47] verse 15. there's nothing from without a
[1:32:49] man that entering into him could defile
[1:32:51] him but those things that's that come
[1:32:53] out of the man
[1:32:55] those that are they that defile man
[1:32:57] if if any man have ears to hear let him
[1:33:00] hear
[1:33:01] now jesus kind of uh rebukes them in
[1:33:03] verse 18 they say can you explain this
[1:33:05] what do you
[1:33:06] mean nothing i put my body defiles me
[1:33:11] in verse 18 and you say unto them are ye
[1:33:13] so without understanding also do you not
[1:33:16] perceive that whatsoever thing from
[1:33:18] without and earth into the man it cannot
[1:33:19] defile him because it enters not into
[1:33:22] his heart in other words
[1:33:23] that food doesn't become a part of his
[1:33:25] human spirit or soul
[1:33:27] right
[1:33:28] now for us we know if we're born again
[1:33:30] the sin is no longer in the soul
[1:33:33] i thought i would get a happy amen after
[1:33:35] that one amen
[1:33:37] hallelujah
[1:33:38] hallelujah amen
[1:33:41] if you're born again there's no there's
[1:33:42] no more sin in your soul for the seed of
[1:33:45] god remains and the seed of god cannot
[1:33:47] sin amen hallelujah so where's the
[1:33:50] defilement come the human mind
[1:33:54] the heart or the emotions
[1:33:57] right usually that's when people get
[1:33:59] usually that's when you see people as
[1:34:00] human sides when they get emotional
[1:34:02] about something
[1:34:04] usually angry
[1:34:08] angry
[1:34:10] bitter
[1:34:11] right
[1:34:12] that's when you see they get emotional
[1:34:16] you see their face get red kind of like
[1:34:18] lena shirts red that kind of red right
[1:34:19] there
[1:34:22] i've had a couple people get mad at me
[1:34:23] before like that
[1:34:27] i say forgive me i'm sorry my fault
[1:34:29] forgive me
[1:34:30] i didn't mean to do that i'll do better
[1:34:32] next time
[1:34:34] right
[1:34:36] so jesus tells him
[1:34:38] the food doesn't make you sinful
[1:34:42] it's already your sinful nature that's
[1:34:44] inside of you
[1:34:47] verse 20. he said that which cometh out
[1:34:49] of the man that defiles a man for from
[1:34:51] within out of the heart of men precede
[1:34:53] evil thoughts adulteries fornications
[1:34:57] murders thefts covetousness wickedness
[1:35:00] deceit lasciviousness and evil eye
[1:35:03] blasphemy
[1:35:04] pride
[1:35:05] and
[1:35:06] foolishness
[1:35:10] all these evil things come from within
[1:35:13] man and defile the man
[1:35:17] so what do we get defiled from oh satan
[1:35:19] you defiled me no no he might have set a
[1:35:22] trap for you but it was your own sin
[1:35:24] that defiled you amen
[1:35:26] your own thoughts right jesus said your
[1:35:28] own thoughts because thoughts become the
[1:35:30] action
[1:35:33] so it's the own thoughts of of the less
[1:35:35] of the less of the flesh the less of the
[1:35:37] eyes the pride of life and so your own
[1:35:39] thoughts about those that eventually you
[1:35:41] act upon and that defiles a man or woman
[1:35:46] ah so now we know where the pride comes
[1:35:48] from now we know why we get exalted with
[1:35:50] pride
[1:35:53] because of our own selves
[1:35:56] it's because of our own human spirit
[1:35:59] right our own human mind
[1:36:02] that has a sinful part to it
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:06] needs transformed daily we must always
[1:36:09] die out to our our thinking we must cast
[1:36:11] out anything that exalts itself against
[1:36:13] the mind of god
[1:36:16] and then also sin that dwells in our
[1:36:17] members
[1:36:19] sin that lives inside of our flesh
[1:36:22] so that kind of concludes where jesus
[1:36:25] said about that
[1:36:27] about the word humble and the church
[1:36:29] said
[1:36:30] now uh
[1:36:32] i'm gonna
[1:36:33] i'm gonna skip that and uh
[1:36:36] i told you wednesday night i wanted to
[1:36:38] get to this
[1:36:39] god humbling israel in the wilderness is
[1:36:40] a type of sanctification
[1:36:44] okay
[1:36:45] so deuteronomy 8 is what i'm going to be
[1:36:47] reading out of
[1:36:48] uh
[1:36:50] deuteronomy is moses's last commission
[1:36:52] to israel before his death
[1:36:55] and he's reminding them the way of
[1:36:57] humility and testing that they've come
[1:36:59] so far they're right on the border of
[1:37:01] taking the promised land
[1:37:03] they've gone come so far out of egypt
[1:37:06] through the wilderness and they're right
[1:37:07] on the border
[1:37:09] and before he dies he's reminding them
[1:37:11] this is how you got here
[1:37:15] he says i command you these things to
[1:37:17] live by to multiply to go in the land
[1:37:19] verse 2 thou shalt remember all the way
[1:37:21] which the lord thy god led thee these 40
[1:37:23] years in the wilderness to humble thee
[1:37:24] and to prove thee to know what was in
[1:37:26] thine heart whether thou would us keep
[1:37:27] his commandments or no
[1:37:30] so for 40 years god led them
[1:37:33] to all these different
[1:37:35] situations these obstacles and it would
[1:37:37] prove whether they'd be humble or not
[1:37:42] church everything in your life
[1:37:44] everything that comes is to prove you
[1:37:46] whether you'll be humble or prideful
[1:37:50] that's what god says here
[1:37:53] everything is just a test
[1:37:54] glory
[1:37:56] are you going to humble yourself when
[1:37:57] you're sick
[1:37:58] or exalt yourself when you're sick
[1:38:00] that's a test
[1:38:03] when there's a family trouble are you
[1:38:05] gonna humble yourself in the family
[1:38:07] trouble are you gonna exalt yourself in
[1:38:08] the family trouble
[1:38:10] when there's a test about money are you
[1:38:12] gonna humble yourself when it comes to
[1:38:13] the money are you gonna be prideful
[1:38:15] about the money
[1:38:19] when there's a test about uh sexual
[1:38:21] temptation you're gonna humble yourself
[1:38:23] in that or you're gonna make yourself
[1:38:24] prideful in that
[1:38:27] see every every situation it ultimately
[1:38:30] is a test of pride versus humility
[1:38:34] like i showed you what was brother
[1:38:36] brahms major fails with well it looks
[1:38:38] like the main thing he battled was pride
[1:38:40] as a real christian you look at peter's
[1:38:42] life what's the main thing you battled
[1:38:43] after got the holy ghost pride
[1:38:46] pride
[1:38:49] so in every situation we've got to look
[1:38:51] and see well which one is this is it
[1:38:53] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes or
[1:38:54] the pride of life
[1:38:58] because that's what god was showing with
[1:38:59] israel and how many know you're on a
[1:39:01] spiritual journey
[1:39:03] coming out of egypt praise god come out
[1:39:05] of egypt amen there you go
[1:39:07] i'm i'm going through sanctification and
[1:39:09] i'm possessing the land amen and then
[1:39:11] when i get in the land i got some real
[1:39:13] enemies to drive out amen
[1:39:15] seven of them
[1:39:17] hallelujah
[1:39:18] seven nations greater mightier than that
[1:39:20] once you get the holy ghost then it's
[1:39:22] time for a real battle praise god
[1:39:26] still have to be humble in the promised
[1:39:27] land
[1:39:30] but god specifically says this
[1:39:32] wilderness journey was to humble you
[1:39:37] and i'm going to know what's in your
[1:39:38] heart by all these situations that i
[1:39:40] allow i bring in it's going to show me
[1:39:41] what's in your heart
[1:39:43] whether you're going to keep my commands
[1:39:45] or not see church every situation is a
[1:39:47] test are you going to keep the word or
[1:39:49] you're going to disobey the word
[1:39:53] verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffer
[1:39:54] thee to hunger now look god allowed them
[1:39:57] to get hungry
[1:39:58] church god allows our finances to go
[1:40:00] down the church said
[1:40:03] god allows you to get sick and the
[1:40:04] church said
[1:40:06] god allowed them to get hungry god knew
[1:40:08] they were hungry
[1:40:10] but this this pain this suffering was
[1:40:13] going to show them
[1:40:14] and god what was in their heart
[1:40:17] your trials when they come they'll show
[1:40:20] you what's in your heart when you go and
[1:40:22] come to a trial
[1:40:23] oh i didn't know that was in me i didn't
[1:40:25] know i could talk like that anymore the
[1:40:26] church said
[1:40:28] well you don't have to say man if you
[1:40:29] don't want to i better stop doing that
[1:40:30] now i've done nothing i've done that
[1:40:31] enough times this service
[1:40:34] just getting you know habits of
[1:40:36] preaching you know
[1:40:37] just want the lord to speak
[1:40:41] so he suffered them to be hungry to
[1:40:44] humble them so they must be too prideful
[1:40:48] church think about it how could they be
[1:40:50] prideful when they they're not the ones
[1:40:51] that held back the water
[1:40:54] they're not the ones
[1:40:56] that was showering them you know all the
[1:40:58] egyptians were showering them with you
[1:40:59] know earrings and gold as they left
[1:41:02] they're just getting oh bye i put that
[1:41:03] in my pocket thank you thank you thank
[1:41:05] you
[1:41:06] and they're prideful like it's something
[1:41:08] they did
[1:41:09] it was the lamb that brought them out
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:12] it was god's judgment upon egypt that
[1:41:14] brought them out the pillar of fire
[1:41:15] brought them out it wasn't them what
[1:41:17] they had to be prideful about
[1:41:19] but that's how human nature is
[1:41:23] maybe that's why god doesn't do as many
[1:41:25] miracles sometimes as we wish and hope
[1:41:27] for and pray for
[1:41:28] we might take some of the credit
[1:41:31] right all these miracles that's what we
[1:41:32] saw was getting right god would not do
[1:41:34] that miracle until all the fearful and
[1:41:37] all the prideful left the church right
[1:41:46] why did god do this that he might make
[1:41:47] thee know that man does not live by
[1:41:49] bread alone
[1:41:51] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:41:53] the mouth of god
[1:41:54] in other words you get hungry to realize
[1:41:57] food isn't my food isn't really what
[1:41:59] satisfies me it's god that satisfies me
[1:42:02] glory
[1:42:05] all right you you your finances go down
[1:42:07] a little bit uh so that you can realize
[1:42:09] wow god's a provider of my finances
[1:42:12] it's not why i should not have done no
[1:42:13] you might have made some mistakes
[1:42:14] financially we've all made mistakes
[1:42:16] financially right
[1:42:18] but really in other words i'm not
[1:42:20] trusting in my my investments right i'm
[1:42:22] not trusting in my human ability now
[1:42:25] i'll be led by the holy spirit right i'm
[1:42:26] going to be led by the holy spirit but
[1:42:28] i'm not trusting in my financial ability
[1:42:30] i'm trusting in jehovah amen amen
[1:42:34] so you can look at this in every
[1:42:36] situation of our lives
[1:42:39] god kept their clothes from
[1:42:41] waxing not old
[1:42:43] and kept their feet from life god can
[1:42:45] keep a foot from swelling 40 years i
[1:42:47] mean what can you do for us praise god
[1:42:52] god see god allows trials to teach you
[1:42:54] you don't live by your own strength you
[1:42:57] live by god's strength
[1:42:59] that's all god wanted was just a people
[1:43:01] that he could have fellowship with and
[1:43:02] that would depend on him satan would not
[1:43:04] depend on him that's why he became the
[1:43:06] enemy of god
[1:43:07] he wouldn't trust god and depend on god
[1:43:09] well if god's placed me here i want to
[1:43:10] stay right here until god changes it
[1:43:14] god's portion to him in life wasn't
[1:43:16] enough
[1:43:18] satan didn't wanted more than what god
[1:43:20] had gave him
[1:43:21] and that's why the bible says godliness
[1:43:23] with contentment is a great gain amen
[1:43:27] satan wasn't content where god had
[1:43:29] placed him
[1:43:34] so we
[1:43:36] we see where god has placed us and we
[1:43:38] stay there until god moves us on we're
[1:43:40] content with where god has placed us
[1:43:45] verse 5 thou shalt also consider in
[1:43:47] thine heart that as a man chastened his
[1:43:49] son so the lord god chasing me in other
[1:43:51] words church you got to picture yourself
[1:43:53] i'm a child of god
[1:43:54] i picture yourself i'm a little baby in
[1:43:56] the kingdom of god not a little baby i'm
[1:43:58] a little toddler in the kingdom of god
[1:43:59] and i need correction all the time
[1:44:02] if just left to myself i'm going to
[1:44:04] wander away from god and the church yeah
[1:44:06] church amen
[1:44:08] god is my father i'm a child
[1:44:10] and just like you have to correct a
[1:44:12] child constantly you've got to correct
[1:44:13] god has to correct us constantly
[1:44:16] therefore keep the commandments to walk
[1:44:17] in his ways and fear
[1:44:19] see they understood we're children and
[1:44:22] god is the father god is trying to teach
[1:44:24] them that
[1:44:26] now here's a warning
[1:44:28] god said once you get in the land you're
[1:44:30] going to be he said you're going to eat
[1:44:31] and be full your tummies are going to be
[1:44:33] full and then you'll bless the lord and
[1:44:35] then in verse 11 but beware you forget
[1:44:38] not the lord thy god where do you often
[1:44:40] forget god when everything's going good
[1:44:42] and easy
[1:44:44] you let up on your prayer your bible
[1:44:45] reading give me your tithes and
[1:44:47] offerings or you let up on something
[1:44:48] when everything's going good and easy
[1:44:50] that's when you tend to let up on god
[1:44:54] not keeping his commandments
[1:44:58] so see after scenes of prosperity human
[1:45:01] nature is just like oh just take it easy
[1:45:06] and all these
[1:45:08] you know i've heard a man say it before
[1:45:09] it's so true the more possessions you
[1:45:11] have the more time you got to spend
[1:45:12] taking care of them
[1:45:15] right the more things you got the more
[1:45:17] time you got to spend on them
[1:45:19] unless you can pay somebody you have
[1:45:20] enough money to pay somebody take care
[1:45:21] of all your things that you got but
[1:45:23] that's not most of us
[1:45:26] who's got an extra you know 60 70 000 to
[1:45:28] pay like a assistant yeah
[1:45:30] i don't know anybody's got that extra
[1:45:31] kind of money
[1:45:35] he says les when you eat and then you're
[1:45:36] full you built goodly houses and dwell
[1:45:38] they're in your herds and your flocks
[1:45:40] multiply my i'm getting bigger and
[1:45:42] bigger i'm getting greater and greater
[1:45:43] my silver and gold's multiplied
[1:45:45] everything's multiplied your heart is
[1:45:47] lifted up and you forget about god who
[1:45:50] brought you out of egypt in other words
[1:45:51] church never forget where you came from
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:54] never forget where god reached out his
[1:45:56] mighty hand and lifted you up on the
[1:45:58] mirror clay don't forget and be grateful
[1:46:01] all the days of your life and recognize
[1:46:03] god's multiply me god's bless me so i
[1:46:05] can be a blessing to others praise god
[1:46:08] now god wants me to be like him and
[1:46:10] bless other people like he does
[1:46:14] see
[1:46:16] but if we're not careful that's why i
[1:46:17] shared with you those three churches i
[1:46:18] know three message churches that build a
[1:46:20] brand new church and awful things happen
[1:46:22] to them i know four that have done it
[1:46:24] one hasn't fallen three had fallen
[1:46:26] one was in sex abuse
[1:46:29] uh one was then they left the message
[1:46:32] and what was the other one oh uh the
[1:46:34] other one was uh
[1:46:36] uh they uh kind of made a creed out of
[1:46:40] music you know they kind of made their
[1:46:41] own creed out of music and they started
[1:46:42] criticizing others and they had a mass
[1:46:44] exodus out of their church
[1:46:46] because they made a denomination they
[1:46:47] basically made a message denomination
[1:46:48] basically what they
[1:46:52] did and now look
[1:46:55] in the old testament god warned them
[1:46:57] you're going to forget about me and you
[1:46:59] know what peter warned us of the same
[1:47:00] thing
[1:47:02] he says if you do the statue of perfect
[1:47:03] man if you let those anointings in your
[1:47:05] life he said you'll always be fruitful
[1:47:07] in the knowledge of god amen
[1:47:10] but if you lack those anointings if you
[1:47:12] if you let those holy ghost anointings
[1:47:13] leave your life and your mind the bible
[1:47:16] says you'll be blind you can't seem far
[1:47:18] off and you'll forget
[1:47:20] that god already washed away all your
[1:47:22] old sins in other words satan will come
[1:47:23] back and say you remember when you did
[1:47:25] this you remember when you did that and
[1:47:26] you'll feel bad about it because you've
[1:47:28] forgotten that all these anointings you
[1:47:30] forgot the anointing of god you forgot
[1:47:32] about him you thought you could do it by
[1:47:33] yourself but with god's anointing you'll
[1:47:35] always remember where you come from and
[1:47:37] where you're going amen
[1:47:39] hallelujah praise god
[1:47:41] when god's anointing is on you strongly
[1:47:43] you're humble and you always remember
[1:47:45] where you come from
[1:47:46] and you always realize you're nothing
[1:47:48] because it's not my strength it's not my
[1:47:50] anointing it's his anointing
[1:47:52] i'm only here because of jesus christ
[1:47:55] amen amen and his anointing
[1:47:58] so how do you do that brother you're
[1:47:59] diligent you diligently repent
[1:48:02] you diligently obey the promises of god
[1:48:07] if you do if you do these things right
[1:48:09] those i'm thinking those middle wings
[1:48:10] those action wings if you do these
[1:48:12] things you'll never fall
[1:48:16] so pride makes you forget about christ's
[1:48:18] blood
[1:48:19] and also his anointing of his traits
[1:48:24] pride makes you forget oh i already did
[1:48:25] repent of that
[1:48:27] i already did all right oh i already
[1:48:28] made that right
[1:48:32] see
[1:48:34] and look in deuteronomy back to
[1:48:36] deuteronomy 8. now back to the old
[1:48:37] testament
[1:48:40] if you're if someone's anointed with
[1:48:41] pride they only care about right now
[1:48:44] but humility sees future rewards and
[1:48:46] benefits for obeying the word of god
[1:48:53] so moses rehearses all that god did for
[1:48:56] them
[1:48:57] god led them through great and terrible
[1:48:59] wilderness has god ever led you through
[1:49:00] a trial
[1:49:02] you said i don't know how i'm going to
[1:49:03] get through this but god led you through
[1:49:05] it
[1:49:06] glory
[1:49:09] ever been bitten by a fiery serpent
[1:49:12] god led them through that ever been
[1:49:14] surrounded by scorpions or drought
[1:49:15] there's no rain no water
[1:49:18] god brought god brought you through the
[1:49:20] trial or god brought water out of iraq
[1:49:23] amen god brought a blessing when there
[1:49:25] seemed like there was no blessing god
[1:49:27] brought a special blessing just for you
[1:49:29] praise god
[1:49:30] he fed you with manna
[1:49:33] that your fathers knew not that he might
[1:49:35] humble you that he might prove thee to
[1:49:37] do the good at the latter end
[1:49:39] see all your failures church all your
[1:49:41] failures are going to work to your good
[1:49:42] at the end
[1:49:44] all the favors of israel worked out for
[1:49:46] the good of joshua and caleb
[1:49:48] and everybody 19 and younger amen
[1:49:51] all those they could learn church i'm
[1:49:53] still learning from my failures today
[1:49:56] right we're still we still learn from
[1:49:58] that
[1:49:59] god is only humbling brother jesse when
[1:50:02] he lets him fall
[1:50:04] god's only humbling brother amen when
[1:50:05] god lets him fall
[1:50:08] it's a it's a time of humility and then
[1:50:11] repentance and then renewal
[1:50:14] that's your latter end glory that you'll
[1:50:17] be ready for the latter rain amen
[1:50:19] i think if we live to see it amen
[1:50:25] see god did not want this god didn't
[1:50:26] want you to say my power and might has
[1:50:29] got me this wealth
[1:50:31] or this knowledge oh it's because i'm so
[1:50:33] powerful i'm so great that's where i am
[1:50:35] today
[1:50:36] that's not what god wants god wants
[1:50:38] humility
[1:50:41] but he says remember the lord your god
[1:50:43] it is he that gives thee power to get
[1:50:44] wealth
[1:50:46] that he may establish his covenant which
[1:50:48] he swears
[1:50:50] and it shall be if you at all forget the
[1:50:52] lord your god and walk after other gods
[1:50:54] and serve them and worship them i
[1:50:55] testify you this day ye shall surely
[1:50:57] perish as a nation which the lord
[1:50:59] destroyed before your face so shall ye
[1:51:00] perish because you would not be obedient
[1:51:03] unto the voice of the lord your god so
[1:51:05] it comes down to humility and obeying
[1:51:07] the word of god
[1:51:12] all right i'm about ready where i want
[1:51:14] to uh keep it going just for a few more
[1:51:15] minutes
[1:51:17] let's look at uh we'll try to close here
[1:51:19] in the next 30 minutes okay try to do 30
[1:51:22] minutes here
[1:51:23] the disciples battle with pride there's
[1:51:24] a few things i haven't said here uh
[1:51:28] oh yeah i didn't do there's actually 14
[1:51:30] complaints of israel in the wilderness
[1:51:32] so maybe i'll preach those wednesday
[1:51:35] i really want to get to this thought
[1:51:37] remember god cut him off after 10
[1:51:38] complaints god said i'm done
[1:51:40] this whoever's 20 and older i'm done
[1:51:42] with them i'm going with the young
[1:51:43] generation and joshua and caleb
[1:51:45] those older ones that do better he said
[1:51:47] i'll give you 10 complaints but after
[1:51:48] that i'm done now of course there's no
[1:51:50] number in the new testament
[1:51:51] right we talk about last sunday in the
[1:51:53] new testament it's a reprobate mind when
[1:51:55] god knows when that person will no
[1:51:56] longer repent and they hate god and they
[1:51:58] they don't don't obey god's word they
[1:52:00] don't want to retain god's word then god
[1:52:01] gives them over to reprobate mind
[1:52:04] right it's not like a certain number
[1:52:07] thank god church how many got a sound
[1:52:09] mind today
[1:52:11] can we say praise the lord
[1:52:12] praise the lord for a sound mind
[1:52:15] because the world has reprobate minds
[1:52:17] disapproved god doesn't god won't even
[1:52:19] intervene he won't even intervene in
[1:52:21] their thoughts anymore
[1:52:24] now
[1:52:26] mark 9 33-34 and he came to capernaum
[1:52:29] and being in the house he asked him
[1:52:31] what was it you disputed among
[1:52:33] yourselves
[1:52:34] by the way
[1:52:36] so when you guys were walking here what
[1:52:38] were you disputing and arguing about
[1:52:41] but they held their peace
[1:52:44] huh
[1:52:46] so that the disciples wanted to argue
[1:52:47] while jesus wasn't around about who's
[1:52:49] the greatest but one's in the presence
[1:52:50] of jesus they didn't want to argue about
[1:52:52] who was the greatest
[1:52:54] they didn't want to talk about not
[1:52:55] church doesn't sound like us
[1:52:57] we'll sin and then we'll come to church
[1:52:58] like i don't want to talk i don't want
[1:53:00] to talk about my sins
[1:53:02] right in other words we're ashamed of
[1:53:04] our sins
[1:53:05] now that's a good thing that's a good
[1:53:07] thing they wouldn't they didn't want to
[1:53:08] argue the presence of jesus
[1:53:10] right
[1:53:11] it's good because they knew it was wrong
[1:53:13] they were convicted by their own
[1:53:14] consciences
[1:53:20] for by the way oh now we know what
[1:53:22] they're arguing about they are disputed
[1:53:24] among themselves who should be the
[1:53:25] greatest
[1:53:27] i don't know i just can't imagine
[1:53:28] arguing with banging amen who's the
[1:53:30] greatest hero brothers come on there's
[1:53:32] no way i'm greater
[1:53:34] can you imagine i just can't imagine
[1:53:36] that happening
[1:53:38] but there's a there's a certain way the
[1:53:39] devil has done it where he's changed it
[1:53:42] and i'm going to show that to you here
[1:53:44] it's my opinion my opinion
[1:53:47] now notice this silence shows again
[1:53:49] they're not born again
[1:53:50] now it's a good thing they were silent
[1:53:53] but i guess if you look at another way
[1:53:54] maybe they should have repented and said
[1:53:55] jesus we're sorry
[1:53:57] we're arguing about who was the greatest
[1:53:59] but instead they didn't want to talk
[1:54:00] about it
[1:54:04] to me church it's like a lot of the
[1:54:05] silence coming out of jeffersonville and
[1:54:07] other preachers who don't have time to
[1:54:09] answer simple questions
[1:54:12] yet the bible says they're supposed to
[1:54:13] answer questions
[1:54:16] right
[1:54:17] now look they like the financial
[1:54:19] benefits of the commission but they
[1:54:21] don't like the laboring in the word
[1:54:22] aspect of the commission i like some of
[1:54:25] the parts of the job but not all the
[1:54:26] parts of the job god doesn't ask you to
[1:54:28] like part of the job god asks you to
[1:54:30] like all the part of the job
[1:54:32] if he's called let me say if he's called
[1:54:34] you the job he's called you to the whole
[1:54:36] job amen
[1:54:37] not half he's if he's called you he's
[1:54:40] equipped you he'll strength he'll give
[1:54:41] you grace to do the whole job amen
[1:54:48] mark 9 and he sat down so right after
[1:54:50] this he sits down calls the 12. does it
[1:54:52] look familiar
[1:54:55] sound familiar
[1:54:57] if any man desire to be first the same
[1:54:59] shall be last of all
[1:55:01] and servant of all
[1:55:03] so church we all want to we all i'll say
[1:55:05] like this we all want to receive a full
[1:55:06] reward from jesus
[1:55:08] no i'm sure nobody here wants to lose
[1:55:10] any of their reward
[1:55:12] i'm sure no one here wants to disappoint
[1:55:14] jesus
[1:55:16] so jesus says if you don't want to
[1:55:17] disappoint me
[1:55:19] make yourself last of all make yourself
[1:55:22] the servant of all
[1:55:25] and what does he do to these big name
[1:55:27] preachers
[1:55:29] he takes a child and sets him in the
[1:55:31] midst
[1:55:34] oh my even took him up in his arms
[1:55:36] even hug this little child
[1:55:40] whosoever shall receive one of such
[1:55:42] children in my name receiveth me
[1:55:45] so look they're arguing amongst himself
[1:55:46] who's the greater one who's the greater
[1:55:47] one jesus says which one of you will
[1:55:49] come get a child and just minister to a
[1:55:51] child dory come here
[1:55:53] come here victory come sit on my lap
[1:55:54] victoria go see my left hand
[1:55:57] the preacher is like
[1:55:58] i i'm the greater preacher i'm the
[1:56:00] greatest preacher and jesus said who's
[1:56:01] the one that'll take the child right
[1:56:02] here
[1:56:03] say honey
[1:56:04] can i teach you about jesus today
[1:56:07] hallelujah
[1:56:09] what questions you have about jesus
[1:56:13] see jesus just takes a little child and
[1:56:14] takes him up in his arms right takes him
[1:56:16] up in his arms
[1:56:19] he's a preacher arguing about who's
[1:56:21] greater
[1:56:23] he said the one who's great cares about
[1:56:25] every single soul
[1:56:27] they care about the least of them we'd
[1:56:29] say the least no no she's not least
[1:56:31] but as far as like she's a child she
[1:56:32] can't do that much she can't work her
[1:56:34] job right she can't
[1:56:35] she can't drive a car
[1:56:37] right
[1:56:39] they're arguing about who's greater
[1:56:41] jesus like this is what you should do
[1:56:42] you should we should look at people that
[1:56:44] you can help who can humble themselves
[1:56:46] and meet the needs of a little one do
[1:56:47] you do you need to order some chipotle
[1:56:49] today
[1:56:52] let's get round bob thank you honey yeah
[1:56:53] thank you
[1:56:57] they're stuffing out their shirts sin
[1:56:58] it's me no he gave me the keys to the
[1:57:01] kingdom and no
[1:57:02] no i did this and i cast out this many
[1:57:04] devils and jesus is just holding a
[1:57:06] little child
[1:57:07] whoever receives one of these receives
[1:57:10] me
[1:57:13] and then not only do you receive me you
[1:57:15] receive him that set me
[1:57:17] amen the heavenly father the eternal
[1:57:19] spirit amen the holy ghost amen
[1:57:23] they're worried about all these adults
[1:57:24] and yet they're neglecting just the
[1:57:26] simple children in the services the
[1:57:28] simple people that
[1:57:30] uh they need love too they need
[1:57:31] attention too yeah
[1:57:34] that's what i love about brother amen
[1:57:36] and you know hua and austin and
[1:57:38] everybody naomi everybody they all play
[1:57:39] with the kids i love that when they play
[1:57:40] with the kids
[1:57:42] i love that humbling themselves right i
[1:57:43] mean you all do it y'all do it to some
[1:57:45] degree
[1:57:47] but i love that
[1:57:49] because they're not so
[1:57:50] they're not rallying around the
[1:57:51] preachers and
[1:57:53] when we have guest preachers you know
[1:57:55] they're not yeah you want to say hi to
[1:57:56] them but you're still able to go look
[1:57:58] and minister to other people's needs
[1:58:01] we'd say the least esteem well what can
[1:58:03] a child do a child can't preach a child
[1:58:05] can't play piano a child can't song lead
[1:58:07] but yet jesus is interested in
[1:58:09] ministering to the children
[1:58:11] because that's the example he gives with
[1:58:13] humility
[1:58:16] that's why brother brahma said he said i
[1:58:17] actually feel more love if you love my
[1:58:19] children rather than loving me
[1:58:21] he said i'd rather have you give a gift
[1:58:22] to my children than me
[1:58:25] he says and then i feel more loved
[1:58:28] because that child came out of him right
[1:58:30] a child just the least esteemed person
[1:58:31] just humble
[1:58:33] you know
[1:58:34] nobody read say well that's really
[1:58:36] important right you never see a child
[1:58:38] elected to be president of the united
[1:58:39] states
[1:58:40] although it might be a good choice at
[1:58:42] this time
[1:58:44] i got a couple good examples i i could i
[1:58:46] could nominate a few good people i know
[1:58:48] a couple good children that could do
[1:58:49] that
[1:58:54] remember uh
[1:58:55] james and john's mother came to jesus
[1:58:57] and said jesus said what do you want
[1:58:59] what wilt thou grant that my two sons
[1:59:01] sent one in the right hand one the left
[1:59:03] and jesus said can you drink this
[1:59:04] baptism can you drink of this cup they
[1:59:06] said yes he said surely you will
[1:59:08] he said but it it's not mine to give
[1:59:11] who sits on my right hand and left but
[1:59:13] given to them for whom it's prepared of
[1:59:15] my father and the ten the other ten that
[1:59:17] included judas two judas is scared
[1:59:20] heard that and they removed indignation
[1:59:22] against the two brethren
[1:59:24] no i deserve to sit by jesus i did more
[1:59:27] i did it
[1:59:29] and they got angry amongst themselves
[1:59:32] at church you would think that they
[1:59:33] would remember i was a fisherman before
[1:59:35] jesus called me i i was a i was a tax
[1:59:38] collector i couldn't cast out devils i
[1:59:40] couldn't walk on water i could do
[1:59:41] nothing before jesus came i'm nothing
[1:59:44] but they'd forgotten how nothing they
[1:59:45] were they thought they were something
[1:59:48] like the power they had was theirs like
[1:59:50] somehow hidden inside of them and now
[1:59:51] they just bring out this power no jesus
[1:59:53] gave them the power
[2:00:01] remember this verse i love this verse
[2:00:03] only by pride comes contention
[2:00:06] in other words whenever there's strife
[2:00:08] and arguments and fusses there's only
[2:00:10] one reason it comes pride
[2:00:14] look what jesus said i'm sorry look what
[2:00:16] brother brahm said about this
[2:00:18] the disciples even walking with jesus
[2:00:21] they didn't have
[2:00:22] no oneness
[2:00:24] they didn't have any unity no they
[2:00:28] argued who's going to be the bishop
[2:00:29] after this
[2:00:31] church that's where you see a lot of
[2:00:33] churches that's when their pride rises
[2:00:35] up once an old pastor gets old and he's
[2:00:37] going off the scene all these guys are
[2:00:39] lining up who's going to be the next
[2:00:41] pastor who's going to get all that money
[2:00:43] that's what they think that's what they
[2:00:45] think
[2:00:46] it is
[2:00:48] most of them it's not about service it's
[2:00:50] about glory
[2:00:52] and power
[2:00:57] who's going to be bishop who's the
[2:00:59] greatest among us they couldn't even
[2:01:01] believe jesus they couldn't understand
[2:01:02] him thou speakest and riddles tell us
[2:01:05] plainly what you mean there was no unity
[2:01:07] between jesus and the disciples or just
[2:01:08] disciples of jesus and disciples among
[2:01:10] one another until
[2:01:12] the holy ghost fell amen hallelujah but
[2:01:15] it says then came pentecost god made
[2:01:18] them one again amen
[2:01:20] oh my then they put then they had
[2:01:22] oneness with god god was in them
[2:01:25] acts if you want to put it down in acts
[2:01:26] 4 verse 32 the bible said they were one
[2:01:28] heart one soul and one mind amen why
[2:01:32] they've been restored back to the
[2:01:34] original again hallelujah
[2:01:36] amen
[2:01:39] the only thing that they had left to be
[2:01:40] disposed of was an old city or they
[2:01:42] lived in there an old body called a city
[2:01:44] or temple that they lived here and that
[2:01:46] had to rot because it was to die and
[2:01:49] corrupt but in spirit and life and in
[2:01:52] purpose and envision everything they
[2:01:54] were one with god
[2:01:56] amen
[2:01:57] see that's how church we know we're
[2:01:59] united together because we all have one
[2:02:01] heart one mind and one soul
[2:02:05] we all want the same thing we all want
[2:02:06] to see people saved sanctified and
[2:02:09] filled with the holy ghost and then find
[2:02:11] your position in the body of christ amen
[2:02:13] amen
[2:02:14] that's what i want for every person
[2:02:20] now a lot of churches you'd be surprised
[2:02:21] they want a bigger building
[2:02:24] right
[2:02:25] that's really what they want
[2:02:27] that's the main thing to get we'll see
[2:02:29] if some people want that but other
[2:02:31] people just want to see soul save well
[2:02:32] then now we don't have the same vision
[2:02:35] that's why people there's a lot of
[2:02:37] division in churches too
[2:02:39] right that's just one example there
[2:02:41] could be many examples right there could
[2:02:42] be all kinds of examples popularity or
[2:02:44] other things tv shows and
[2:02:46] podcasts and you know youtube channels
[2:02:48] you know
[2:02:49] anything can divide a church
[2:02:52] but see we have one heart one soul one
[2:02:55] mind that's what the holy ghost does
[2:02:57] brings real unity so your unity comes by
[2:02:59] humility hallelujah amen
[2:03:02] that's the only way we're united is by
[2:03:04] humility
[2:03:06] pride will always separate us
[2:03:10] you can stop the livestream
[2:03:12] everybody take a deep breath here
