[34:51] hey Pat gory sorry amen let's stand to
[34:56] our feet here let's go right to the Word
[34:57] of God tonight by the grace of Lord
[35:00] let's go to proverbs I'm sorry please
[35:03] yeah seize upon me chapter 10 please
[35:06] please
[35:07] Marmee chapter 10 verse 17 please yesyes
[35:16] 1017
[35:36] I like to just call this one part 19
[35:39] like to call the wise are persistent I
[35:42] think it's very fitting amen the wise
[35:45] are persistent so please ask these 10 17
[35:50] and 18 hopefully we'll get to chapter 9
[35:54] and 10 8 9 and 10 perhaps but I like to
[36:00] take that for my text Ecclesiastes 10 17
[36:03] and 18 by the grace of the Lord Thank
[36:05] You Lydia appreciate it
[36:07] blessed art Thou O land when the I King
[36:10] is the son of nobles and thy Prince's
[36:13] eat in due season for strength and not
[36:18] for drunkenness so Solomon saying the
[36:21] land is blessed when they have strong
[36:23] leaders because the next verse shows the
[36:26] opposite the next verse shows what a
[36:28] awful leader is verse 18 by much
[36:32] slothfulness the building decay off' and
[36:36] through idleness of the hands the house
[36:39] droppeth through so in verse 17 we know
[36:43] strong leaders lead the people but verse
[36:49] 18 is the opposite that's what of course
[36:52] proverbs are and wisdom there's always a
[36:55] contrast the Proverbs does that
[36:57] repeatedly they'll contrast good and
[36:59] then show bad in the very next sentence
[37:01] or the next phrase and so here the
[37:04] opposite of persistent would be slothful
[37:07] and idle
[37:10] so being lazy and doing nothing how many
[37:13] want to be persistent for the kingdom of
[37:15] God well you're in the right place
[37:17] tonight amen let's have a word of Prayer
[37:19] let's bow our heads here
[37:20] Heavenly Father we've sung your songs or
[37:23] we're so happy to be walking up your
[37:25] Highway Lord God Lord our way gets
[37:27] brighter and our load gets lighter Lord
[37:30] walking up the Kings Highway how true it
[37:32] is we don't have to worry or be in a
[37:34] hurry Lord because we know everything is
[37:36] right on time and your economy Lord God
[37:38] your prophet said the rapture won't be
[37:40] one second too late or one second early
[37:43] everything is working right on time so
[37:46] father speak to us here tonight Lord God
[37:47] use thy word Lord Here I am M
[37:50] I posted Duty Lord each one of us at our
[37:52] posts of duty faithfully reporting for
[37:54] the kingdom of God's sake Lord God bless
[37:57] us through thy word lord thank you for
[37:58] the songs we felt blessed in your
[38:00] presence Lord God worshiping you for
[38:02] worship is calmly and Father now may we
[38:05] just feel you in the power of your
[38:06] presence through your word dear God let
[38:09] your wound discern our thoughts and
[38:11] tense Oh God and may it Lord God show us
[38:14] that you're here with us in Jesus
[38:16] Christ's name and everybody said amen
[38:18] god bless use me and see the praise God
[38:20] well let's go back to proverbs chapter
[38:22] I'm sorry Cleese asking Chapter II and I
[38:24] keep saying proverbs Ecclesiastes
[38:26] chapter eight verse nine I think we
[38:28] ended off with verse eight yeah left off
[38:36] at verse eight by God's grace so let's
[38:46] draw a little more wisdom by the grace
[38:48] of the Lord through this little series I
[38:52] appreciate I got a nice feedback from
[38:54] Sunday they were some people really
[38:55] enjoyed the message from Sunday so I
[38:57] thank the Lord for that and of course
[38:59] it's always a privilege when my
[39:00] mother-in-law is here she gets to hear
[39:02] the preaching of the word cuz you know
[39:04] she's never really asked any questions
[39:05] really about the message so the fact
[39:08] that I got to go over some of our basics
[39:10] I was really happy about that
[39:11] I'm just trusting that seeds were
[39:13] planted in her heart by God's grace so
[39:15] that always means a lot to me and then I
[39:18] called my mom and I told her I said you
[39:19] know I was downtown or how I said if
[39:22] yeah so I called my mom I said mom do
[39:23] you have any questions about the makeup
[39:25] let me know you know because I wanted to
[39:26] follow up you know I preached a little
[39:28] bit about that on Sunday I just want to
[39:30] follow up and see if she had any
[39:31] questions and so she didn't but that's
[39:34] okay God knows and it's okay if she
[39:37] doesn't have any questions because we
[39:39] know God has the answers amen and we'll
[39:42] just keep pressing on and trusting in
[39:43] the Lord please he's eight verse nine
[39:46] all this have I seen and applied to my
[39:49] heart unto every good work that is done
[39:51] under the Sun there's a time wearing
[39:54] one-man rule a--the over another to his
[39:57] own hurt so Solomon tried to see all the
[40:00] things that were done under the Sun and
[40:02] he saw one
[40:04] where a man ruled over people and it
[40:07] actually hurt him so I want to look at a
[40:10] few scriptures that will teach us that
[40:13] from the Word of God this reminded me of
[40:17] Luke chapter 12 Jesus tells a parable in
[40:20] Luke 12:45 and in this parable a man
[40:23] rule rules over others for his own hurt
[40:26] and not only hurts the people that he's
[40:28] ruling over but it hurts him in the end
[40:31] Luke 12:45 but if that servant say in
[40:35] his heart my lord delayeth his coming
[40:37] and shall begin to beat the menservants
[40:39] and the maids maidens and they eat and
[40:42] drink and to be drunken so this ruler he
[40:45] gets so convinced that well that my
[40:47] Lord's not coming back in other words
[40:49] the rapture is not going to be very soon
[40:51] he gets so idle that he starts beating
[40:56] his male and female servants and then he
[40:59] starts eating and drinking so much that
[41:01] he's getting drunk so he wants to escape
[41:03] the dahle of the hour right because he
[41:07] knows how my lord is not coming so he's
[41:09] like I might as well just beat up my
[41:11] servants I might as well get drunk
[41:13] because this is just such a boring time
[41:16] there's just such a time where we're not
[41:18] we're not expecting his return and so
[41:22] he's ruling over others to his hurt
[41:24] verse 46 the Lord of that servant will
[41:27] come in a day when he looketh not for
[41:29] him and an hour when he's not aware and
[41:32] will cut him asunder and will appoint
[41:33] him his portion with the unbelievers so
[41:36] I'm happy to say tonight I'm looking for
[41:38] the coming of the Lord if I wasn't I
[41:41] wouldn't be here praise God
[41:42] amen so no matter the day no matter the
[41:45] hour we want to be looking for the
[41:47] coming of the Lord
[41:48] Luke in verse 47 and that servant which
[41:51] knew his Lord's will and church if
[41:53] anybody knows God's will it's the
[41:55] message believers and prepare not
[41:58] himself neither did according to his
[41:59] Will shall be beaten with many stripes
[42:02] for he that knew not and didn't commit
[42:05] things worthy of stripes shall be beaten
[42:09] with few stripes for whosoever much is
[42:12] given of him shall be much required and
[42:14] to whom men have committed much of him
[42:16] they will ask them all
[42:17] so God is going to ask us in the message
[42:20] he's going to ask more of us because
[42:23] we've heard more than other people so
[42:25] our devotion or art or our character how
[42:29] we treat others should be so careful we
[42:32] should always be acting like the Lord
[42:34] may come anytime and the way we'll know
[42:36] that we're we're feeling that way is how
[42:39] we treat one another praise God we won't
[42:41] beat each other up we will accuse
[42:43] falsely accuse one another we won't say
[42:45] evil things against one another we will
[42:48] be always treating each other with the
[42:50] utmost love and respect and we won't be
[42:54] overfilled with the things of the world
[42:55] we won't go to the world to be filled
[42:58] we'll go to the Holy Ghost to be filled
[43:00] amen because this preacher he started
[43:03] getting drunk with spirit which we say
[43:05] natural drink and said a spiritual drink
[43:08] he got so lazy that he just gave himself
[43:10] over instead of being filled with God's
[43:12] coming instead of being filled up with
[43:14] all Jesus may come back soon instead of
[43:17] being filled up with that he got filled
[43:19] up with the things of the world so we
[43:20] must make sure that our hearts are
[43:22] beginning filled up with the things of
[43:24] God so I hope we were spending more time
[43:26] worried about Jesus coming or concerned
[43:29] about Jesus coming then who won the
[43:30] elections last night amen it's more
[43:33] important to know that Jesus already won
[43:36] the election of your heart praise God
[43:38] amen and as long as he won that election
[43:40] that's all that matters praise God give
[43:43] your vote to Jesus that's all that
[43:44] matters
[43:45] because there's going to be more
[43:46] gridlock and more turmoil and more of
[43:48] the same very few things ever really
[43:51] change they just get more and more and
[43:53] more worse but thank God we voted for
[43:55] Jesus many years ago or maybe some of
[43:57] you even this year right hate right
[43:59] Kerris you voted for Jesus this year
[44:01] ain't my head so we got to keep casting
[44:03] our vote for Jesus and make sure we know
[44:05] and believe that he's coming anytime
[44:07] amen
[44:08] verse 9 I'm sorry verse 10 and so I saw
[44:13] the wicked buried who had come and gone
[44:15] from the place of the Holy and they were
[44:17] forgot in the city where they had done
[44:19] so this is also vanity right so faithful
[44:22] church members saw Solomon had seen
[44:24] faithful church members go in the holy
[44:26] city but then die and everybody forgets
[44:29] about him
[44:31] that's sad part of life verse 10 I'm
[44:34] sorry verse 11 now verse 11 is one of
[44:37] the best scriptures I've used for
[44:39] parenting it's one of the most helpful
[44:40] scriptures for parenting and also for
[44:43] teaching at school with 21 children then
[44:46] I got a tee at the Bible Club and 30 at
[44:47] the middle school this is the best thing
[44:49] for me to get control of these big
[44:52] crowds they say my friend asked me how
[44:54] can you control 80 kids this is it right
[44:56] here because sentence against an evil
[45:00] work is not executed speedily therefore
[45:02] the heart of the sons of men is fully
[45:04] set in them to do evil what do you mean
[45:07] by that what I mean by that is when
[45:08] children misbehave I have them say that
[45:11] as they're sorry immediately or if
[45:14] they're talking what I'll do is I'll say
[45:15] okay go out and touch the door and come
[45:17] back in and try it again all over again
[45:19] or get out your paper you know write an
[45:21] apology note that a consequence must be
[45:24] right away now I know there's quotes her
[45:26] brother Branham says you know his mom
[45:28] would scare him and say your dad's gonna
[45:30] whip you when you get home and he said
[45:31] that was very effective with him so that
[45:34] can be very effective right oh well
[45:36] dad's gonna really have to lay into you
[45:38] when you get home that may be effective
[45:39] for some people we don't do really that
[45:41] at our house really but I do this at
[45:44] school and with my own children too to
[45:47] make sure they say sorry right away like
[45:49] we had a little argument before church
[45:51] upstairs between two of our children I
[45:53] had to make them say they're sorry right
[45:55] away see if you if you don't give a
[45:58] consequence if there's not a consequence
[46:00] then the children just learn to keep
[46:02] doing it but Solomon even in all his his
[46:06] back sin and condition he realized when
[46:08] there's rules that are broken that the
[46:10] the more Swift the consequences the
[46:13] better praise God amen especially for a
[46:16] wise person he's remembering the bots
[46:18] and the proverbs the Bible says if you
[46:20] rebuke a wise man he'll love you more
[46:22] amen
[46:23] hallelujah so see Christians don't mind
[46:27] being corrected as long as it's the Word
[46:29] of God and they want to be corrected
[46:31] they want to be corrected so that they
[46:32] can do the right thing as soon as
[46:34] possible that's right
[46:37] remember the Bible says do not let the
[46:39] Sun go down upon your wrath so if you've
[46:42] got something to get somebody or someone
[46:44] sinned against you
[46:45] it's best to go take care of it as soon
[46:47] as possible
[46:48] now verse 12 and 13 has a different
[46:50] theme this is encouraging to us who fear
[46:53] the Lord tonight
[46:54] verse 12 and 13 though a sinner do evil
[46:58] a hundred times in his days be prolonged
[47:00] yet surely I know that it shall be well
[47:02] with them that fear God which fear
[47:04] before him amen verse 13 but it shall
[47:07] not be well with the wicked neither
[47:09] shall he prolong his days which are as a
[47:11] shadow because he fears not the Lord so
[47:14] their relationship with God will not be
[47:17] well because they don't fear the Lord
[47:19] but all relationship with God because we
[47:21] fear the Lord it will be well God will
[47:25] forgive us God will love us God will
[47:27] continue to take care of us because he
[47:29] said he never leave us nor forsake us
[47:31] now verse 14 there's a vanity which is
[47:37] done upon the earth that there be just
[47:39] men unto whom it happened if according
[47:41] to the work of the wicked again there
[47:43] been be wicked men to whom it happened
[47:46] at the court of the work of the
[47:47] righteousness I said that this also is
[47:50] vanity now the simple examples as we
[47:54] said sometimes bad things happen to good
[47:57] people and vice versa sometimes good
[47:59] things happen to bad people the two
[48:02] obvious cases are like job and the rich
[48:04] young ruler job does all good all
[48:08] perfect but then God wants to prove to
[48:10] Satan that there are people on this
[48:13] earth that will serve God just because
[48:15] they love God is true they men they love
[48:18] that God is the truth they love God's
[48:20] character and they know God is right and
[48:23] they know God is holy and they hate evil
[48:26] so God was proving to Satan that job
[48:28] serves me just because he loves me not
[48:31] because of what I do for him Amen
[48:33] hallelujah and so see bad things happen
[48:36] to job and as that's what Solomon is
[48:38] saying here sometimes I see that happen
[48:40] but then also the rich young ruler
[48:42] brother Branham said that that Satan
[48:44] prospered the rich young ruler I found
[48:46] of a quote from that from 1965
[48:48] the rich young ruler turned down the
[48:51] highest calling in the Bible to be an
[48:53] apostle
[48:54] oppai he turned on the highest calling
[48:56] in church people today will turn down
[48:58] the highest calling as far as church
[49:00] goes which is being in the bride of
[49:02] Jesus Christ they'll turn that down for
[49:05] riches because remember the rich young
[49:07] ruler he feared losing his money more
[49:10] than he feared God he was more scared of
[49:13] losing his money and being poor than he
[49:15] was of having a prideful greedy heart
[49:18] and standing before God as a greedy
[49:21] person he feared losing money more than
[49:24] he feared God
[49:25] oh my and yet good things supposedly
[49:28] kept happening to him so Solomon said I
[49:31] noticed both what is it God has to have
[49:34] someone who will stand on every matter
[49:36] what the situation God needs a witness
[49:39] that everywhere every that where there
[49:41] will be a believer standing no matter
[49:43] what the circumstances no matter what
[49:45] the conditions God will have an
[49:47] overcomer in every circumstance amen
[49:49] just like me I've got to be an overcomer
[49:51] in every circumstance that God places me
[49:54] in just like you you need to overcome in
[49:57] every situation and circumstance because
[49:59] remember the Bible says all things are
[50:02] common unto men there's no temptation
[50:04] that has taken you except what's common
[50:06] to all men you're not the only one going
[50:09] through what you're going through other
[50:10] people have been through it before
[50:12] people are going through it right now if
[50:14] God Terry's people in the future will go
[50:16] through things that you and I are going
[50:18] through we must understand that these
[50:20] are all tests these are all trials but
[50:22] the Bible says in the end will come
[50:24] forth as silver and gold tried in the
[50:26] fire
[50:27] amen that's exactly right so Solomon
[50:30] says I see both I see good happen to bad
[50:33] I see bad happen to good and it shook
[50:35] him up a little bit verse 15 so Solomon
[50:39] again he goes back to this this is the
[50:41] theme of Solomon's life as a backslider
[50:44] he just he just chooses to focus on well
[50:47] I might as well enjoy my life I might as
[50:50] well see little things in my life as
[50:52] being gifts of God which they are we
[50:54] talked about that a few weeks ago all
[50:56] these things are gifts of God in our
[50:58] lives but this is what he keeps going
[51:00] back to verse 15 then I come
[51:05] mirth now mirth is gaiety or happiness
[51:10] then I commended mirth because a man
[51:13] hath no better thing under the Sun than
[51:14] to eat and to drink and and be merry
[51:16] now what about winning souls for Jesus
[51:18] or in that case what about winning souls
[51:21] verse 4 Jehovah what about getting
[51:24] people to the house of God so see we got
[51:26] to balance this out here remember he's a
[51:28] backslidden man and so all after he sees
[51:31] all these things he's wondering about
[51:33] all these things he said the best thing
[51:35] is that you eat and drink in other words
[51:37] eat drink and be merry for that shall
[51:43] abide with him of his labor that all the
[51:44] days of his life which God giveth him
[51:47] under the Sun now how many have seen it
[51:49] at Christmas time I see that Christmas
[51:50] time every year it's in the stores I
[51:53] think I've seen that Panero last year
[51:54] they have these signs eat drink and be
[51:56] merry one time they had like a cherry
[51:58] dessert and they said eat drink and eat
[52:00] cherry or something like that and that
[52:03] ridiculous we're gonna get that from
[52:05] Solomon but remember it's Scripture but
[52:08] you've got to understand what Solomon
[52:10] was going through he was in a Backson
[52:12] and condition remember we saw it last
[52:14] Sunday he said every man is just
[52:16] miserable because they know all their
[52:17] works are gonna come under judgment if
[52:19] you're really under the blood of Jesus
[52:21] Christ you have no fear on Judgment Day
[52:24] amen you're not going to be miserable a
[52:27] holy God because you know that holy God
[52:30] has forgiven you how do you know because
[52:33] he sent His Word he sent His presence he
[52:36] felt he sent his vindication he said
[52:38] everything to you and you had such a
[52:40] relationship with him you prayed enough
[52:43] you heard the Word of God enough you
[52:45] knew where you stood you listened to
[52:47] everything the Word of God said and you
[52:49] did it
[52:49] you know you where you stand with God
[52:51] and you don't have any doubts on
[52:52] Judgment Day but Solomon was not so he
[52:57] thought this is miserable we got to come
[52:59] under judgment and be judged for all the
[53:01] works we've done Under the Sun oh my so
[53:05] what does he praise he praises Gaiety he
[53:09] praises mirth eat drink and have some
[53:12] Cherry Coke or something like that
[53:14] he drink and be merry
[53:19] so how many know we gotta balance the
[53:21] scripture Church I think it was yeah it
[53:24] was remember Luke 17 where Jesus is
[53:27] describing memories describing the days
[53:29] of lot he says as it was in the days of
[53:31] lot he said where and they were eating
[53:33] drinking marrying giving him marriage
[53:37] right and then they went knew not until
[53:41] the flood waters came and then came the
[53:43] destruction that sounds very similar
[53:45] does it not and who's going to be the
[53:48] ones doing that the ones who are
[53:49] backslidden just like Solomon was back
[53:52] slidden and the only thing he sees in
[53:55] life is eat drink and be merry if that's
[53:57] the greatest hope we have in our lives
[53:59] if today eating drinking and being
[54:01] married just trying to act happy and
[54:03] have parties if that is the best thing
[54:06] of birthday parties or whatever kind of
[54:08] parties are the best things we have in
[54:10] life
[54:10] oh we're are very sad people in this
[54:12] hour but if our greatest ally is serving
[54:15] Jesus and worshipping Him and seeing the
[54:18] people of God gathered and feeling God's
[54:20] presence and worshiping him and loving
[54:22] him if that's our greatest desire then
[54:25] we're closer to heaven ain't ahead then
[54:28] we've got the right attitudes but this
[54:31] is Solomon's words here at this stage of
[54:34] his life brother Branham said with a
[54:38] quote he said the greatest joy on earth
[54:41] is winning a soul if you haven't won a
[54:44] soul he said that's the greatest thing
[54:46] he said you need to try to win a soul
[54:48] praise the Lord it's been a while for me
[54:51] I think I think there's been a few
[54:52] people on YouTube that said so but I
[54:54] would just maybe say Amen and hooah
[54:56] well trying to win souls you know thank
[54:58] God for that that God has helped us to
[55:01] try to win a soul and point them to
[55:03] Jesus Christ and there's no greater joy
[55:07] remember the Bible said there's no
[55:08] greater joy than to see your children
[55:10] walk in the truth now that can be both
[55:12] natural and spiritual children how many
[55:14] know that right but I just heard brother
[55:17] am saying today in Christ the mystery of
[55:19] God revealed he said oh how a pastor
[55:21] just loves to see and he was talking
[55:23] about his church he said all these of
[55:24] all these spiritual children you've
[55:26] given to me he said he said may you
[55:29] protect them Lord and may you be with
[55:30] them and he was praying for the people
[55:32] that
[55:32] one to the Lord there's no greater joy
[55:35] than to see soul save and live change to
[55:39] see live spiritually resurrected amen
[55:42] but Solomon saying eat drink and be
[55:44] merry that's really the best thing you
[55:46] can do is try to be happy try to have
[55:48] parties you know try to enjoy oh my so
[55:54] what we need church what we need
[55:55] especially with this Old Testament we
[55:57] kind of got to look through it through
[55:58] the lens of the New Testament so can I
[56:00] just put it back so we've kind of got a
[56:01] look at the Old Testament like this
[56:03] you've got to start from the New
[56:04] Testament and then look back to the old
[56:06] desk you have to filter all that through
[56:08] the New Testament so all of Solomon's
[56:12] words we have to filter through the New
[56:14] Testament it's exactly right
[56:17] now let's finish this chapter with 16
[56:20] and 17 when I applied my heart to know
[56:25] wisdom and to see the business that is
[56:27] done upon the earth for there for also
[56:30] there is that neither day nor night see
[56:33] asleep with his eyes then I beheld all
[56:38] the work of God that a man cannot find
[56:40] out the work that is done under the Sun
[56:42] because though a man labor to seek it
[56:44] out yet he shall not find it yayyyy
[56:46] farther though a wise man think to know
[56:49] it yet shall he not be able to find it
[56:51] you know I was listening to a blog cat
[56:54] was it blogcast is that how you say that
[56:56] podcast blog cast something like that
[57:01] and when there was a certain CEO I'm not
[57:05] gonna call names but there's a certain
[57:06] CEO that was bragging for a couple years
[57:08] about I only get four hours of sleep
[57:10] because remember what verse 16 said
[57:12] there's some of those that neared
[57:13] neither sleep day or night and they were
[57:16] bragging and having all you know I only
[57:17] get four hours sleep at night and and
[57:19] then they came to a very important
[57:21] meeting where they had potential clients
[57:23] and this the CEO fell asleep and missed
[57:27] out on some deals and eventually had to
[57:29] resign as CEO before the person got
[57:32] fired so now of course this person
[57:35] didn't you know go without sleep but
[57:37] they were boasting and bragging about
[57:38] the scripture about about how in verse
[57:41] 16 Lily can you put the 16 back up there
[57:43] how they they work so hard
[57:46] they needed very little sleep yes Osama
[57:49] had seen that in his day church there's
[57:51] nothing new Under the Sun some people
[57:54] fill their lives with work for natural
[57:56] things we got to fill our lives with
[57:58] serving Jesus Christ doing the work
[58:01] whether it's motherhood fatherhood going
[58:04] to school pastoring whatever the work is
[58:07] we've got to fill our lives with the
[58:09] work that God gave us to do
[58:12] daki right look at verse 17 then I
[58:16] beheld all the work of God that a man
[58:18] cannot find out the work that is done
[58:19] under the Sun because though a man labor
[58:22] to seek it out yet he shall not find it
[58:24] yeh farther though a wise man think to
[58:27] know it yet shall he not be able to know
[58:29] it now this is true church there's so
[58:31] many things in life that God doesn't let
[58:33] us know there's so many things we wonder
[58:36] well I don't know why this happened or I
[58:38] don't know why that happened but
[58:40] remember brother Aaron said the reward
[58:42] for the overcomer according to the
[58:44] church ages the reward for the overcomer
[58:47] in we're thinking the Philadelphia
[58:49] Church age was that they would be able
[58:52] to see what was hidden in the right
[58:54] white rock there would be a revelation
[58:56] which no man knew hidden in the white
[58:58] rock and so that was brother man was
[59:01] saying that shows that throughout all
[59:03] eternity God was going to be answering
[59:05] all of our unanswered questions on this
[59:08] side amen
[59:09] so on this side we have all these
[59:10] questions but on that side we'll have
[59:12] all the answers amen and brother Branham
[59:16] said this repeatedly brother Branham
[59:20] even talked about Elijah remember how
[59:21] the Shulamite woman said it's all's well
[59:23] all's well all is well when her when her
[59:27] little son died that Elijah gave her in
[59:28] the name of the Lord and the Bott for
[59:32] the Brotherhood the Bible says that that
[59:34] that Elijah didn't even know what was
[59:37] happening to the woman and brother
[59:40] Graham said see you know Elijah was
[59:42] surprised you know God doesn't always
[59:44] tell his prophets everything that's
[59:46] going to happen he looked up and seen
[59:49] her coming he said here comes that
[59:50] shunammite he and he and said she's full
[59:52] of sorrow but God had it's hid it from
[59:55] me and he told his servant run and go
[59:57] meet her amen
[1:00:01] Rotom says this he says I'm 48 years old
[1:00:04] I've seen vision since I was about 18
[1:00:07] months old that's right just a baby
[1:00:09] and I've never seen it one time fail and
[1:00:11] it won't it can't now I can't make him
[1:00:15] show me anything you know we say oh well
[1:00:19] it must be easier for brother branham
[1:00:21] you know it was a lot easier for him
[1:00:22] because God showed him a lot more well
[1:00:24] brother Ram said that only made him more
[1:00:26] accountable to God so the more you see
[1:00:30] the more you God shows you the more
[1:00:32] responsible you have to be with that my
[1:00:34] brother have said even though I'm a
[1:00:35] prophet I can't make God show me
[1:00:38] anything he doesn't show me according to
[1:00:41] my desire he shows me according to what
[1:00:45] his will is how many believe that a list
[1:00:51] of this he's been praying for Lord will
[1:00:56] you just tell me how we'll come out so I
[1:00:59] can comfort the people my brother man
[1:01:03] said he'll never say a word to me about
[1:01:04] it I'm gonna read that again many things
[1:01:12] have I prayed for Lord will you just
[1:01:14] tell me how it will come out so I can
[1:01:15] comfort the people he never say a word
[1:01:19] to me about it how many appreciate that
[1:01:24] how many have how many of you have any
[1:01:27] things and God just didn't answer now
[1:01:33] that's why we rejoice Church when God
[1:01:34] does answer that's why you'll see us
[1:01:37] you'll hear me shout out or braise it
[1:01:38] harder I'll clap and I'll say hallelujah
[1:01:40] that's all per say praise the Lord
[1:01:42] that's right we rejoice when God does
[1:01:44] answer because Rhoda have said many
[1:01:46] times I ask for a word for the people
[1:01:52] and he doesn't answer me well Ram says
[1:01:58] he'll turn around and tell me something
[1:02:00] else but he tells me what he wants me to
[1:02:07] know he's my father and what he wants me
[1:02:11] to know why he tells me ain't none of my
[1:02:15] business that's his business to see as
[1:02:21] much as as much as I want to know the
[1:02:23] business of God I've got to be humble
[1:02:25] enough to say well Lord if you don't
[1:02:27] tell me that's okay that's your business
[1:02:29] that's none of my business
[1:02:32] how's he gonna all turn out Lord how
[1:02:34] how's things with my family going to
[1:02:36] turn out how's things with my loved ones
[1:02:38] if you could just give me a sign how are
[1:02:40] things going to turn out at the church
[1:02:41] is this person going to come back is
[1:02:43] this person going to get saved
[1:02:44] Lord would you give me something to help
[1:02:46] comfort this family the church and if
[1:02:48] the Lord says no then we have to say
[1:02:50] Lord that's none of my business that's
[1:02:53] your business you see that shows it
[1:03:03] doesn't lay in a man it's in God these
[1:03:07] are just gifts in other words we cannot
[1:03:10] trust in our gifts that we see amongst
[1:03:13] each other
[1:03:14] we can't trust an even a brother
[1:03:15] branham's gift for all the answers is
[1:03:17] what I'm saying we could only lean upon
[1:03:20] God we must trust God we must not put
[1:03:23] our overconfidence in men and women and
[1:03:25] gifts and all these things like that
[1:03:27] we've ultimately got to have full
[1:03:29] confidence and trust in Jesus Christ
[1:03:35] that ain't
[1:03:37] my business that's his business praise
[1:03:42] God so I thought that'd fit real well
[1:03:44] with verse 17 there's so many things a
[1:03:47] wise man don't think to know it yet he
[1:03:48] should not be able to find it out
[1:03:50] there's many things we're not going to
[1:03:52] be able to find out although we tell God
[1:03:54] Lord I desire this Lord I ask that you
[1:03:56] do this
[1:03:57] lord please minister here please do this
[1:03:59] please give me a word please give me
[1:04:01] something to help this person if we get
[1:04:02] no answer we've just got to say well the
[1:04:04] Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[1:04:06] that's how that would be up to God
[1:04:10] praise God chapter 9 perhaps we'll
[1:04:12] finish chapter 9 tonight here please ask
[1:04:19] these nine verse one I like to just read
[1:04:21] verse one and just make a few comments
[1:04:22] on verse 1 for all this I considered in
[1:04:25] my heart even to declare all this that
[1:04:27] the righteous and the wise and their
[1:04:29] works are in the hand of God no man
[1:04:32] knoweth either love or hatred by all
[1:04:34] that is before them so see the Bible
[1:04:38] says the righteous the wise all their
[1:04:40] works are in the hand of God how many
[1:04:45] know your lives are in God's hands
[1:04:47] remember Ephesians 2:10 I'm just gonna
[1:04:49] read that again I'm gonna be preaching
[1:04:51] that Lord willing a little more on the
[1:04:53] purpose series I've got a lot of
[1:04:54] thoughts for that I'm just kind of wait
[1:04:57] until I finish these other thoughts I
[1:04:58] would like to really finish a series
[1:05:00] before moving on
[1:05:04] seasons 2:10 for we are his workmanship
[1:05:08] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:05:11] which God hath bought before ordained
[1:05:14] that we should walk in them alright so
[1:05:19] the Bible said all our works are in the
[1:05:21] hand of God oh I'm so glad to know that
[1:05:24] that God has everything for me re in his
[1:05:27] hand he's not got to reach out and grab
[1:05:29] it and say well I better do this I
[1:05:30] better change that or maybe I'll swap
[1:05:32] this out for that I've got to have
[1:05:34] conference that everything God wants me
[1:05:36] to do is already in his plan for my life
[1:05:38] amen it's in his hand Church praise God
[1:05:42] thank the Lord the Bible says even the
[1:05:45] sinner is made for the day of
[1:05:46] destruction in the Proverbs even the
[1:05:48] works of sinners are in the hands of
[1:05:52] verse two and three I'll make some
[1:05:53] comments on two and three
[1:05:55] all things come alike to all there's one
[1:05:58] event to the righteous and to the wicked
[1:06:00] to the good in to the clean to the I'm
[1:06:02] sorry to the good to the clean and to
[1:06:04] the unclean to their sacrifices and him
[1:06:07] that sacrifice is not as is the good so
[1:06:11] is the sinner and he that sweareth as he
[1:06:14] that feareth and oath this is an evil
[1:06:17] among all things that are done under the
[1:06:19] Sun that there is no I'm sorry there's
[1:06:21] one event unto all of course death yeah
[1:06:24] also the heart of the sons of men is
[1:06:26] full of evil and madness is in their
[1:06:28] heart while they live and after that
[1:06:30] they go to the dead praise God so all
[1:06:36] people die except those few lucky
[1:06:38] Usher's they lucky except those few
[1:06:40] elected ones praise God Enoch amen
[1:06:44] Elijah praise God very few that actually
[1:06:48] cheat death we'd say or miss death thank
[1:06:51] God die other than those elected ones
[1:06:55] and the hearts of the evil are full of
[1:06:58] wickedness and madness
[1:07:01] so remember church all these things
[1:07:04] happen all temptation is common to all
[1:07:06] man we must not give place to the devil
[1:07:09] we must in this case we must not have
[1:07:13] ourselves a pity party and we must not
[1:07:15] feel sorry for ourselves as we said
[1:07:17] earlier there are others who have
[1:07:19] suffered the same as us and then there
[1:07:22] are so many others who've suffered more
[1:07:24] than us that's exactly right
[1:07:26] the same events happen to us all all
[1:07:32] temptation is common to all men exactly
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:37] verse 4 through 6 for
[1:07:43] him that is joined to all the living
[1:07:45] there's hope for a living dog is better
[1:07:47] than a dead lion verse five for the
[1:07:53] living no not that they shall die but
[1:07:55] the dead know not anything neither have
[1:07:57] they any more a reward for the memory of
[1:08:01] them is forgotten also their love and
[1:08:05] their hatred and their Envy is now
[1:08:07] perished neither have they any more a
[1:08:10] portion for heaven I'm sorry for ever
[1:08:12] and anything that is done under the Sun
[1:08:15] I want to make a few comments here to
[1:08:20] kind of balance this out I feel this is
[1:08:22] a little imbalanced here now the
[1:08:25] statement the dead know not anything is
[1:08:28] an interesting statement because I'm not
[1:08:31] sure on this some people believe that
[1:08:33] those people in heaven see what's going
[1:08:37] on right now and there seem to be some
[1:08:39] people who say that you know brother
[1:08:41] Branham said theophanies are around us
[1:08:43] all the time that's possible I
[1:08:45] personally have not seen any quotes on
[1:08:47] that like some people say brother
[1:08:49] Branham said you know you know my
[1:08:51] grandmother's here or or your mother's
[1:08:53] here in the room right now I don't know
[1:08:55] about that all I see in the Bible is
[1:08:57] that there's angels among us I do see
[1:09:00] that but I don't know if it's someone
[1:09:02] else's Ange or someone else's theophany
[1:09:04] I don't know about that I can't really
[1:09:06] prove that by scripture at this point of
[1:09:08] my my spiritual journey but I do want to
[1:09:13] say this remember the souls under the
[1:09:15] altar that he knew they knew that they'd
[1:09:19] been killed unjustly and they were
[1:09:20] crying out for revenge and brother
[1:09:23] Brandon tells us that you know Sharon
[1:09:26] Rose was waiting for Billy Paul right
[1:09:28] and remember the dream when brother man
[1:09:30] went beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:09:32] you know I'm waiting for Billy Paul she
[1:09:33] said I'm gonna go wait down for Billy
[1:09:35] Paul at the gate and so they were
[1:09:39] waiting so it seemed as if they knew
[1:09:41] something but I don't know you know the
[1:09:45] Bible says in Hebrews 12:1 that there's
[1:09:46] a great cloud of witnesses in heaven now
[1:09:50] I don't know if they're witnessing
[1:09:51] what's going on earth I don't know about
[1:09:53] that so I can't say that
[1:09:57] but I can say this there is a cloud of
[1:09:59] witnesses which would be testimonies
[1:10:02] that are witnessed to us from those who
[1:10:06] have already gone to heaven in other
[1:10:08] words if you look up - if we know all
[1:10:10] the Saints that have lived on the earth
[1:10:12] have lived such godly lives that their
[1:10:14] testimonies are like clouds above us
[1:10:17] in other words also got to do is get our
[1:10:19] eyes on heaven amen and think about all
[1:10:22] the testimonies of all these saints who
[1:10:24] have gone before us amen when we get
[1:10:27] discouraged when we think about being
[1:10:29] sick or having symptoms we've got to
[1:10:31] look to the clouds of heaven and
[1:10:32] remember that Jonah was a witness and
[1:10:34] mother madam says no one has ever been
[1:10:36] as sick as Jonah
[1:10:38] no one's ever had as many symptoms as
[1:10:40] Jonah had so that ought to encourage us
[1:10:42] that ought to be a cloud of a witness in
[1:10:44] heaven if we've ever been sick or
[1:10:46] discouraged we can look up to heaven to
[1:10:48] remember there's been people who've been
[1:10:50] more sick than we were and if God
[1:10:52] delivered Jonah God can deliver us amen
[1:10:55] hallelujah it's exactly right we got to
[1:10:58] remember there's a great cloud of
[1:10:59] witnesses
[1:11:00] there's heavenly testimonies of
[1:11:02] believers and have gone on to heaven
[1:11:04] before us and we should take courage
[1:11:06] from their testimonies that's exactly
[1:11:09] right
[1:11:10] glory amen hallelujah
[1:11:14] so it seems like Solomon saying the dead
[1:11:18] can't change anything and that's right
[1:11:19] the Bible said men live and then they
[1:11:21] die and then go to the judgment they
[1:11:23] wait for judgment we know but we know
[1:11:26] sinners wait in the prison house they
[1:11:29] wait there the souls that are in prison
[1:11:30] the Bible said they go to wait there for
[1:11:32] judgment but they're tormented while
[1:11:35] they're awaiting judgment we know that
[1:11:37] and at least there's hope for those who
[1:11:41] are alive thank God for that
[1:11:43] now it's reverse is 7 through 10 Solomon
[1:11:47] again tells us to live joyfully
[1:11:49] Ecclesiastes 9 7 to 10 go thy way eat
[1:11:53] thy bread with joy and drink thy wine
[1:11:55] with a merry heart for God now accepteth
[1:11:58] thy works
[1:11:59] let thy garments be always white and let
[1:12:02] thy head lack no I meant live joyfully
[1:12:05] with the wife whom thou lovest all the
[1:12:07] days of the life of thy vanity which he
[1:12:09] hath given thee under the
[1:12:10] all the days of thy vanity for that is
[1:12:14] thy portion in this life and in that
[1:12:17] labor which thou take us under the Sun
[1:12:20] verse 10 whatsoever thy hand findeth to
[1:12:23] do do it with thy might where there's no
[1:12:26] work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom
[1:12:28] in the grave whither thou goest now this
[1:12:31] has been an encouraging Scripture but
[1:12:33] before I get to that one so psalmist
[1:12:36] saying treat life as precious treat days
[1:12:40] as joyful love your wife or loved your
[1:12:43] husband work as hard as you can and
[1:12:45] balance work with pleasure
[1:12:48] in other words balance work with family
[1:12:50] time and verse 10 kind of ties in with
[1:12:55] my topic for tonight the wise are
[1:12:59] persistent
[1:13:02] praise God so verse 10 whatsoever thy
[1:13:06] hand findeth to do do it with all thy
[1:13:09] might for there's no work nor device nor
[1:13:11] knowledge nor wisdom in the grave
[1:13:13] whither thou goest brother Ram said we
[1:13:16] must work while it is day because the
[1:13:18] night cometh a man there's going to be a
[1:13:21] time where we cannot work anymore
[1:13:24] whether we go to the grave or or
[1:13:26] whatever happens there's going to be a
[1:13:28] time we can't add any more to our
[1:13:29] testimony so we must work while there is
[1:13:32] life today praise God we must work while
[1:13:35] we have an opportunity if I'm a teacher
[1:13:38] I should work as hard as I possibly can
[1:13:40] as a teacher but yet at the same time
[1:13:42] not rob my family from the ministry I
[1:13:45] must give my family and that's and God
[1:13:47] knows my heart I try to do that every
[1:13:49] day so I'm not most days I'm extremely
[1:13:53] from trying to put everything I possibly
[1:13:55] can all my might into the job and I got
[1:13:58] to come home I got to try to put all my
[1:13:59] might into being a family man and a
[1:14:01] pastor amen so the last two weeks I've
[1:14:04] been so concerned about that me get up
[1:14:06] at 4:30 every morning the last few weeks
[1:14:08] by God's grace to try to get some some
[1:14:10] more done with all my might the Bible
[1:14:14] says we must work with all our might how
[1:14:17] many one will work with all their might
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:19] the lies are persistent and we'll get to
[1:14:22] that in just a moment now verse 11
[1:14:26] this ought to be a word of encouragement
[1:14:28] I returned and saw Under the Sun that
[1:14:31] the race is not to the Swift nor the
[1:14:33] battle to the strong neither yet bread
[1:14:35] to the wise nor yet riches to men of
[1:14:37] understanding nor yet favor to men of
[1:14:40] skill but time and chance happeneth to
[1:14:43] them all in other words God has a
[1:14:45] specific testimony for each life every
[1:14:49] life is different just because someone's
[1:14:52] the strongest doesn't mean they're
[1:14:53] always going to succeed just because
[1:14:55] someone's the poorest isn't always gonna
[1:14:57] mean they're gonna remain poor right so
[1:14:59] time it the gods time and God's plan
[1:15:03] happens to everybody praise God because
[1:15:05] we know Church there's Noth there
[1:15:07] there's no such thing as chance with God
[1:15:09] right right the Bible says God knows our
[1:15:13] beginning from the end the Bible says he
[1:15:15] knows the beginning from the end so we
[1:15:17] asked after understand this the right
[1:15:19] way God knew what happened to us last
[1:15:21] year God knew what happened to us as a
[1:15:23] child God knows what's going to happen
[1:15:25] tomorrow praise God God knows what's
[1:15:27] gonna happen in five years of God
[1:15:29] Terry's there's no such thing as chance
[1:15:30] but there is the the thing where God
[1:15:34] will change people's lives and he'll do
[1:15:36] certain things to different people
[1:15:38] different things happen to us all but
[1:15:40] we've all got to give God all of our
[1:15:42] mites while we have the chance we got to
[1:15:44] serve God with all we have amen
[1:15:46] I've got a priest with all I have
[1:15:48] tonight because this might be the last
[1:15:50] time I pray amen this might be the last
[1:15:52] time you step your foot in a church
[1:15:54] we've got to give all of it because we
[1:15:56] know there's different rings there's
[1:15:58] different testimonies there's different
[1:16:00] testimonies that people have we've got
[1:16:02] to make sure we give all that we have to
[1:16:04] God because we never know in our time
[1:16:06] may end hallelujah we are governed by
[1:16:11] God's timing not by our own God governs
[1:16:15] all things no matter how capable we are
[1:16:17] how strong we are God's will must be
[1:16:21] done we cannot control events how many
[1:16:24] know that you cannot control the events
[1:16:26] it's all in God's hand we've got to do
[1:16:28] all we can do for God while God has
[1:16:31] given us this time Oh amen I'm happy to
[1:16:33] do it
[1:16:34] hallelujah verse 12
[1:16:37] for men also knoweth not as time as the
[1:16:40] fishes that are taking an evil net and
[1:16:42] as the birds that are caught in the
[1:16:44] snare so are the sons of men snared in
[1:16:46] the evil time when it falls suddenly
[1:16:49] upon them amen all right so see there
[1:16:53] sometimes people die quickly and it's
[1:16:55] unexpected they just die and the Bible
[1:17:00] said it falls suddenly upon them no
[1:17:02] members now I was surprised at God
[1:17:03] what's this surprise to us I'll never
[1:17:06] forget when we went to church in Lima
[1:17:08] brother Brooks's church and he was our
[1:17:09] pastor they had a missionary I forget
[1:17:12] which country was from but this was a
[1:17:14] missionary and he lived in some remote
[1:17:16] area up on a mountain I think it was
[1:17:18] maybe the Philippines or something like
[1:17:20] that and his children he had numerous
[1:17:22] children they just got old enough where
[1:17:25] his children were playing drums and then
[1:17:27] the church and his sons were as his his
[1:17:29] sons were playing drums and and the song
[1:17:32] leaders and then an awful event happened
[1:17:34] he said his sons were they were old
[1:17:37] enough to drive they were driving down
[1:17:38] the mountain and a rockslide came and
[1:17:40] just they lost him
[1:17:42] he lost his sons so he lost his whole
[1:17:45] church family or his whole church band
[1:17:47] because his sons did the drums they did
[1:17:50] the piano they did everything and he's
[1:17:52] telling this testimony and people are
[1:17:54] just weeping and he's weeping and crying
[1:17:56] and his sermon was called God's grace is
[1:18:00] sufficient for me in weakness can you
[1:18:03] imagine me in a pastor of a church he's
[1:18:05] he left the United States to start a
[1:18:07] church in the Philippines where ever was
[1:18:09] he just gets his church going to where
[1:18:11] it's going well as his family's in the
[1:18:14] band and God allows a rock slide to come
[1:18:18] and I found out later cuz brother Brooks
[1:18:21] and I were talking I found out later
[1:18:23] that he took that message around to all
[1:18:25] these churches and it was in America and
[1:18:27] was such an encouragement to people who
[1:18:29] had hard times in their lives so God let
[1:18:33] this man this mission heir and his wife
[1:18:35] struggle and suffer and lose their
[1:18:37] children in order to come around and
[1:18:39] give their testimony to comfort people
[1:18:42] who had lost loved ones that could not
[1:18:45] been comforted before that Amen
[1:18:49] isn't that just like God and I think
[1:18:51] that's even Scripture off to look up the
[1:18:53] scripture but I know there's some
[1:18:54] scripture about how how there's only
[1:18:58] people the only way you can be comforted
[1:19:00] is by someone who's gone through
[1:19:02] something that you've gone through
[1:19:03] that's the only way you can be comforted
[1:19:06] is by somebody who's already been gone
[1:19:08] through that and thank God that Jesus
[1:19:10] went through the most awful wicked
[1:19:14] persecution that could ever be given and
[1:19:16] if we ever feel discouraged we must
[1:19:18] remember that Jesus has gone through it
[1:19:21] all jesus paid it all all to him I owe
[1:19:24] amen and if he suffered awful if he went
[1:19:27] through the most awful suffering there
[1:19:29] could ever been through that I know at
[1:19:30] least Jesus can understand my situation
[1:19:32] amen that made me think of that story
[1:19:36] there these things happen to all people
[1:19:43] we're not guaranteed
[1:19:45] oh good happy times all the time we've
[1:19:49] got to remember that these things happen
[1:19:51] but it's God's Way it's God's will it's
[1:19:54] God's plan God's trying to get a
[1:19:56] testimony out of our lives
[1:20:02] verse 13 now read 13 down the end the
[1:20:05] chapter and I think we'll finish chapter
[1:20:07] 9 here this wisdom have I seen also
[1:20:10] under the Sun and it seemeth great unto
[1:20:12] me there was a little city and a few men
[1:20:15] within it and there came a great King
[1:20:17] against it and the besieged and built
[1:20:19] great bulwarks against it now there was
[1:20:22] found in it a poor wise man and he by
[1:20:26] his wisdom delivered the city yet no man
[1:20:29] remembered that same poor man then said
[1:20:33] I wisdom is better than strength
[1:20:35] nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is
[1:20:37] despised and his words are not heard
[1:20:39] that was my text from Sunday that's
[1:20:41] where I thought I'd get to I thought I'd
[1:20:42] get to that on Sunday I didn't get to
[1:20:44] that on Sunday the words of a wise men
[1:20:47] are heard and quiet more than the cry of
[1:20:49] him that rule among fools wisdom is
[1:20:52] better than weapons of war but one
[1:20:54] sinner destroy earth much good all right
[1:20:59] now
[1:21:01] I want to bring this point out from the
[1:21:03] scripture wise words are heard more and
[1:21:06] quiet among a little flock or amongst
[1:21:11] lesser people huh me know that when
[1:21:13] Elijah ran away from a Jezebel how many
[1:21:18] know that the storm and the lightning
[1:21:21] and the Thunder that did not attract
[1:21:24] Elijah how many know that Elijah never
[1:21:27] left the cave when he heard fire and
[1:21:31] thunder and lightning
[1:21:32] Elijah never left the cave that's not
[1:21:35] what drew him out what drew him out was
[1:21:38] this still small voice of God and that's
[1:21:42] what the Bible says here the wise words
[1:21:44] are heard more and quiet than in
[1:21:47] loudness with many people in other words
[1:21:50] you are gonna have your best times with
[1:21:52] God in quiet times you're gonna hear the
[1:21:56] voice of God when you're quietly
[1:21:58] fellowshipping with God amen that's what
[1:22:02] the word says it's those quiet times
[1:22:06] when you're really able to listen now
[1:22:09] don't get me wrong we all love to shout
[1:22:10] and rejoice I love to shout and say Amen
[1:22:13] and praise the Lord and that's such an
[1:22:15] encouragement to us and many times but
[1:22:18] think about that when you've been your
[1:22:20] lowest when you've been down and
[1:22:21] discouraged and you're feel like you're
[1:22:23] all by yourself those are the times when
[1:22:26] God will speak to you praise the Lord
[1:22:30] kind of like tonight right it's not the
[1:22:33] loudest services not the most people
[1:22:35] here
[1:22:35] I can't hear really any screaming or
[1:22:38] crying or I can't hear much clapping or
[1:22:41] anything like that but in quiet times
[1:22:43] the Bible said the words of the wise are
[1:22:46] heard more in quiet times so those are
[1:22:51] times you really gotta listen when it's
[1:22:53] quiet
[1:22:54] remember all those other noises didn't
[1:22:57] draw a line out now you got the balance
[1:23:00] of two because remember when God spoke
[1:23:02] on Mount Sinai remember he was the Bible
[1:23:04] so there was lightning and thunderings
[1:23:05] and God was speaking to Moses up there
[1:23:07] right he got the law we have to balance
[1:23:09] this out Solomon just noticed I saw more
[1:23:12] words of wise people amongst quiet
[1:23:14] little group
[1:23:15] and is that true especially last night
[1:23:18] with all the election stuff how many saw
[1:23:19] the I didn't see him but I heard about
[1:23:21] all the rallies last night right they
[1:23:23] have the after election rallies right
[1:23:25] the victory speeches and there's so much
[1:23:27] blah blah blah we're gonna change
[1:23:29] America that tell me it's so quiet here
[1:23:34] tonight church which gathering has more
[1:23:37] wisdom
[1:23:38] it's the democratic or Republican rally
[1:23:40] last night
[1:23:41] where they're just spewing out the same
[1:23:43] old things or is it this assembly here
[1:23:45] tonight which one has more wise words I
[1:23:52] think God vote for this one tonight
[1:23:54] won't you that's what the Word of God
[1:24:00] says and isn't it foolish how they just
[1:24:05] they care so much about politics like
[1:24:08] program said they're trying to get a man
[1:24:10] to the moon or they're trying to get
[1:24:11] them to do all these things
[1:24:13] brother Hansen we're trying to get
[1:24:14] people to heaven right we've got a
[1:24:17] greater objective tonight to get people
[1:24:19] to heaven to get people filled with the
[1:24:20] Holy Ghost to get them baptized and
[1:24:22] sanctified and filled and yet it's some
[1:24:25] smaller group instead of the fools that
[1:24:30] are excited about other things and the
[1:24:32] Word of God right
[1:24:37] in other words another way look at this
[1:24:39] is words of wisdom are more effective
[1:24:42] than brutality right many times it's
[1:24:47] more effective to give words of wisdom
[1:24:49] than to be brutal and yell and scream
[1:24:52] like remember in Proverbs the Bible says
[1:24:54] a soft answer turns away wrath have you
[1:24:58] seen that lately instead of getting mad
[1:25:00] and screaming and yelling you just give
[1:25:02] a soft rebuke that you ought to see more
[1:25:07] effect to that the Bible says that and
[1:25:10] then the
[1:25:11] after ends by saying one single mistake
[1:25:14] does more damage to nullify the works of
[1:25:17] wisdom think about David one let me say
[1:25:25] this one hour of lust and passion for
[1:25:28] your eyes wife ruin the rest of his is
[1:25:31] ruling one Act one moment he was doing
[1:25:37] so good Church he was almost undefeated
[1:25:39] up to that time he was I think he was 50
[1:25:41] years old when that happened
[1:25:43] 53 something like that he was almost
[1:25:45] undefeated
[1:25:46] he was almost invincible but one weak
[1:25:49] moment like the Bible says him at the
[1:25:51] end of verse nine one sinner destroy
[1:25:55] Earth much good and then you know the
[1:25:58] story his own son kicked him out and
[1:26:02] then he's weeping leaving remember he's
[1:26:06] leaving Jerusalem and one of those
[1:26:09] remember when those old men spits on
[1:26:11] David remember that and one of his
[1:26:13] guards comes up and lacy said let me cut
[1:26:15] off that dead dog's head and David was
[1:26:17] so humbled he said don't you know God
[1:26:19] told him to do that and brother Ram
[1:26:25] tells that story and Christ the mystery
[1:26:27] of God revealed brother Ram was getting
[1:26:30] criticized by brother by preachers and
[1:26:32] leave al said let me argue with him let
[1:26:35] me straighten them out and brother Adam
[1:26:36] said don't you know God's letting them
[1:26:38] do that to me I don't know when was last
[1:26:41] time you got criticized I don't know
[1:26:44] when the last time somebody was talking
[1:26:46] bad about you but we've got to consider
[1:26:48] there's some times where God is letting
[1:26:51] us get criticized there sometimes God is
[1:26:56] letting this happen for a purpose
[1:26:58] perhaps for humility or perhaps for
[1:27:01] chase chastisement because we did
[1:27:03] something wrong brother Ram saw it
[1:27:06] brother Ram you can listen to in Christ
[1:27:08] a mystery lament Owsley veil that God is
[1:27:11] letting them do this God setting these
[1:27:13] preachers speak evil about me just like
[1:27:16] God that that old man spit on David
[1:27:24] now that's not always shouting preaching
[1:27:26] is it nobody likes to say yes have
[1:27:29] somebody spit on me or criticize me
[1:27:31] yes preach it brother nobody says that
[1:27:36] but yet that's what we see this is a
[1:27:40] possibility we can do so many good
[1:27:42] things and then one mistake will ruin
[1:27:45] all that good let me know may God help
[1:27:48] us church to live faithfully before the
[1:27:50] Lord help may we have a testimony like
[1:27:54] brother Branham into this to this extent
[1:27:57] may our only thought be bragging too
[1:27:59] much on Jesus and then that's not even a
[1:28:01] fault amen she said you dragged too much
[1:28:05] on Jesus but as I said I hope that's all
[1:28:08] I've got to answer for on that day amen
[1:28:10] and if we're under the blood that will
[1:28:13] be all we have to answer for that day
[1:28:15] because everything else has been washed
[1:28:17] because there's no condemnation to them
[1:28:19] that are in Christ Jesus
[1:28:22] now there is one time though brother
[1:28:24] Branham did say that he failed remember
[1:28:29] when he went remember in South Africa
[1:28:30] and he went with the ministers he went
[1:28:32] with the denominational schedule rather
[1:28:34] than obeying the angel the angel Lord
[1:28:36] brother told brother Branham if you
[1:28:38] would have obeyed me I would have given
[1:28:39] you the whole country of South Africa
[1:28:41] remember that does anyone remember that
[1:28:44] he lost the reward of having even more
[1:28:48] influence over a nation because of one
[1:28:52] mistake saying okay I'll go with the
[1:28:55] preacher schedule rather than following
[1:28:57] the ange of the Lord the same thing
[1:29:03] happened to saw member Saul Saul was
[1:29:06] told by Samuel Samuel said wait until I
[1:29:08] get there to sacrifice I remember that
[1:29:10] but because the enemy was coming in and
[1:29:12] Saul just couldn't wait any more he went
[1:29:14] ahead and did the sacrifice and then
[1:29:17] Samuel said because you've done this he
[1:29:20] said your family will not have the
[1:29:22] kingdom of God forever had you waited
[1:29:24] your sons and your your family would
[1:29:27] have had the throne forever I remember
[1:29:29] that one mistake can undo all the good
[1:29:35] that was done before it
[1:29:38] oh my prayers Jesus keep me near the
[1:29:40] cross my prayers to be different that a
[1:29:45] little bit a little bit different than
[1:29:47] David instead of going out to battle he
[1:29:50] took a little vacation
[1:29:51] my desires lord help me to stay in the
[1:29:54] battle in other words help me to stay in
[1:29:56] prayer and reading the word and
[1:29:58] continually looking for the coming of
[1:30:01] the Lord amen help me not be like that
[1:30:05] man serving that was beating his maid
[1:30:07] servants and getting drunk and and not
[1:30:09] expecting the Lord to come in other
[1:30:11] words lord help me always expect that
[1:30:13] you're coming in my day amen
[1:30:16] Gloria if only he and waited upon the
[1:30:21] Lord
[1:30:21] if only Saul could have held on a little
[1:30:24] longer if only David would have went out
[1:30:27] and fought with the rest of the kings
[1:30:30] rather than staying back and not
[1:30:32] fighting the good fight of faith
[1:30:33] if only brother Branham had gone out and
[1:30:37] gone with the angel of the Lord schedule
[1:30:39] rather than the denominational brothers
[1:30:42] now you can put your name in there if
[1:30:44] only Jesse Smith had done that but my
[1:30:47] prayers God help us not to fall short of
[1:30:50] your glory there was a scripture I
[1:31:00] thought I wanted to read here oh yeah
[1:31:03] it's very next one okay so the same
[1:31:05] thought now let's go to chapter 10 the
[1:31:07] same thought is continued in chapter 10
[1:31:09] verse 1 that's right that's what I was
[1:31:12] thinking of please a season 10 verse 1
[1:31:22] dead flies cause the ointment of the
[1:31:24] pocke theory to send forth a stinking
[1:31:27] savour so death a little folly him that
[1:31:29] is in reputation for wisdom and honor
[1:31:31] amen my that reminds us of David doesn't
[1:31:35] it one little mistake ruin that
[1:31:39] beautiful testimony that he had one
[1:31:43] little mistake
[1:31:50] I'll tell the kind of a gross story here
[1:31:53] but a few weeks ago I was out of it I
[1:31:55] was getting a cup of coffee and I just
[1:31:57] made a fresh cup of coffee and I pulled
[1:31:59] it over here and inside I saw a stink
[1:32:01] bug in my coffee one little thing bug
[1:32:05] ruins the whole coffee right and this is
[1:32:09] what this is saying one little fly ruins
[1:32:12] the whole event can I say like this one
[1:32:16] person's sin in the church ruins the
[1:32:18] move of the Holy Ghost one spot of 11
[1:32:22] will ruin the unleavened lump is that
[1:32:26] right remember that woman from the
[1:32:29] fourth parable Jesus told in Matthew 13
[1:32:31] the Bible says she hid a leaven in three
[1:32:35] measures of meal until the whole thing
[1:32:38] was corrupted see what's saying see we
[1:32:42] know we're doing wrong when we have to
[1:32:45] hide our sins from people we know that's
[1:32:48] going to turn that's gonna ruin the rest
[1:32:50] of our day or the rest of our week or
[1:32:52] the rest of our month or year it's gonna
[1:32:54] ruin any sin we don't confess and get it
[1:32:57] out from our lives is gonna ruin the
[1:32:59] rest until we get it out of our lives
[1:33:03] one little 11 will leaven the whole
[1:33:06] thing that's so true look at verse 2 a
[1:33:12] wise man's heart is as his right hand
[1:33:15] but a foolish heart at his left let me
[1:33:18] see where am I going to okay I'm trying
[1:33:20] to get to verse 18 all right oh my let's
[1:33:25] keep going verse okay oh yeah I heard a
[1:33:30] joke about this okay I'm not gonna say
[1:33:33] that it's a political joke I'm not gonna
[1:33:36] say verse 3 yeah also when he that is a
[1:33:39] fool walketh by the way his wisdom
[1:33:41] faileth him and he said to everyone that
[1:33:44] he is a fool so see people know you're a
[1:33:49] fool or know if you're wise right away
[1:33:50] by the things that you say people say oh
[1:33:53] that person's wise or that person to
[1:33:54] fool in other words your life speaks
[1:33:59] louder than your words right
[1:34:03] your life speaks louder than anything
[1:34:05] you can say out of your mouth verse four
[1:34:08] if the Spirit of the ruler rise up
[1:34:10] against thee leave not thy place for
[1:34:12] yielding pacify great offences alright
[1:34:18] verse five now I wanted to do actually
[1:34:20] verse four now so this is the scripture
[1:34:24] about dealing with rulers a person must
[1:34:26] maintain self-control or show wisdom
[1:34:29] when they're dealing with someone a
[1:34:31] superior that's angry with them they
[1:34:33] must show wisdom and self-control verses
[1:34:38] five to seven there's an evil which I've
[1:34:41] seen under the Sun as an heir which
[1:34:43] proceedeth from the ruler folly is set
[1:34:45] in great dignity and the rich sit in a
[1:34:48] low place verse seven I have seen
[1:34:53] servants upon horses and princes walking
[1:34:55] as servants upon the earth now doesn't
[1:35:00] this remind you of Mordechai church and
[1:35:04] there the first thing I wrote down when
[1:35:05] I read that remind me of Mordecai
[1:35:07] Mordecai was just a servant but member
[1:35:10] he saved King Ahasuerus his life and
[1:35:14] then for one moment member the King
[1:35:17] wanted to honor him so the king took the
[1:35:19] servant and he put him up on a horse I
[1:35:22] remember that and then Amon had to poem
[1:35:25] wasn't naming Haman Haman had to pull
[1:35:27] him through and that must have burned up
[1:35:29] Haman's havens of pride
[1:35:31] oh here's the man the King delights to
[1:35:34] honor everybody clapped for him and he
[1:35:38] wouldn't bow to me and he was just
[1:35:39] eating him alive so see God just like
[1:35:42] Salman thought there's people that are
[1:35:44] servants that deserve to be ruling let
[1:35:47] me say like this
[1:35:48] there's many humble Christians that are
[1:35:50] the lowest of the low today but they
[1:35:52] deserve to be ruling and so Christ will
[1:35:54] make them rulers like we saw over 10
[1:35:57] cities in the New Jerusalem a head
[1:35:59] hallelujah
[1:36:00] but there's people that are ruling that
[1:36:02] don't deserve to be ruling and we can
[1:36:05] all name politicians that are like that
[1:36:07] right they are ruling but they don't
[1:36:11] deserve because they don't have the
[1:36:12] character that they ought to have
[1:36:17] and then remember what Mordechai do he
[1:36:20] was so humble he just Africa off that
[1:36:22] horse he just went back right to ruling
[1:36:24] again took his position but it wasn't
[1:36:28] long right - the Queen interceded she
[1:36:31] fasted and prayed she went before the
[1:36:33] king she had two wine banquets which is
[1:36:35] Holy Ghost anointing which is the former
[1:36:38] lane rain and latter aid amen and then
[1:36:42] after that everything was changed right
[1:36:44] Haman was done away with Mordecai was
[1:36:46] brought in which he typed the 144,000
[1:36:49] and instead of being a servant now he
[1:36:51] finally got exalted as a ruler praise
[1:36:54] God he got new garments he got a crown a
[1:36:56] ring he got a signet ring all these
[1:36:58] things but it was after the bride
[1:37:00] interceded it was after the bride came
[1:37:03] out of her closet and that's what we're
[1:37:04] doing we're coming out of the closet
[1:37:06] amen hallelujah and then the rapture
[1:37:10] will fully be out of that closet ain't
[1:37:12] nin thank God for that
[1:37:14] that's right Church now verse 89 we're
[1:37:19] almost there
[1:37:19] I'm trying to get to 18 verse 89 he that
[1:37:24] diggeth a pit shall fall into it and
[1:37:26] whoso break up in hedge a serpent shall
[1:37:28] bind now that's just like Haman right he
[1:37:30] built the gallows but what he hung he
[1:37:32] built the gallows for Mordecai but he
[1:37:34] was hung in the gallows himself right
[1:37:38] it's like people who gossip they gossip
[1:37:40] to make somebody else look bad but
[1:37:41] really it only affects them it always
[1:37:43] come backs on them because whatever you
[1:37:46] reap that's what you sow so whatever you
[1:37:48] sow I'm sorry that's what you reap
[1:37:50] parmie verse 9 whosoever remove a stone
[1:37:57] shall be hurt with their with and he
[1:37:59] that cleaveth wood shall be endangered
[1:38:01] thereby now see both criminal work and
[1:38:05] honest work can destroy a person Solomon
[1:38:08] says so he must trust in God for safety
[1:38:10] that's what Solomon says how many pray
[1:38:12] how many pray every time you get on the
[1:38:14] road right how many pray every time you
[1:38:16] travel somewhere or fly on a plane I
[1:38:19] hope you pray when you get on a plane or
[1:38:21] get in a car especially actually it's
[1:38:23] more safe in a plane that is in a car
[1:38:25] according to statistics so we must trust
[1:38:29] God for our safety
[1:38:31] that's verse 8 9 now verse 10 11 wisdom
[1:38:34] must be timely in verses 10 and 11
[1:38:37] if the ayran be blunt and he do know
[1:38:41] what that do not wet the edge then must
[1:38:43] he put to more strength but wisdom is
[1:38:46] profitable to direct verse 11
[1:38:51] surely the serpent will bite without
[1:38:53] enchantment and a babbler is no better
[1:38:56] so see church wisdom makes success
[1:38:59] easier to obtain if you sharpen your
[1:39:03] sword
[1:39:03] it's going to work better it's probably
[1:39:05] gonna work better and that's what the
[1:39:06] scripture is saying if you make wise
[1:39:08] decisions it's going to be easier to
[1:39:10] have success but it must be applied at
[1:39:14] the right time
[1:39:15] you must choose the right timing in
[1:39:18] order to do something wise timely wisdom
[1:39:22] directs your life how many know that you
[1:39:24] must make the right decision at the
[1:39:26] right time or else you might miss the
[1:39:30] opportunity there's been certain people
[1:39:33] you know that we've known that that said
[1:39:35] oh I you know they had a business
[1:39:37] opportunity presented to them and then
[1:39:40] they didn't and maybe they didn't pray
[1:39:41] about long enough or not you know I
[1:39:43] don't want to give too many details man
[1:39:46] but maybe didn't pray about long enough
[1:39:48] but they miss an opportunity and and it
[1:39:50] came back later that they wish they
[1:39:52] would have done something with a certain
[1:39:54] up with a certain business opportunity
[1:39:56] or maybe a job opportunity or maybe it
[1:39:59] was a relationship oh I wish I would
[1:40:00] have prayed more before doing this or I
[1:40:02] wish you would have prayed more and done
[1:40:04] that or maybe was with the church I wish
[1:40:06] I would have prayed more about that
[1:40:07] church or something like that so wisdom
[1:40:12] timely wisdom directs your life and we
[1:40:16] must look for God's leadership in each
[1:40:18] situation that's why we should pray
[1:40:20] about every decision pray about it
[1:40:23] before you make a quick decision brother
[1:40:25] Ram said pray about everything he said
[1:40:26] God will answer you if you just pray
[1:40:28] about it verse 12
[1:40:32] almost there the words
[1:40:37] wise man's mouth our gracious Amen but
[1:40:41] the lips of a fool will swallow up
[1:40:42] himself
[1:40:46] thirteen the big
[1:40:47] the words of his mouth as foolishness
[1:40:49] and the end of his talk is mischievous
[1:40:51] madness now that's talking about a fool
[1:40:53] he starts evil and he ends evil verse 14
[1:40:57] a fool is also full of words a man
[1:41:01] cannot tell what he shall be in what
[1:41:03] shall be after him who can tell him the
[1:41:06] labor of the foolish weareth every one
[1:41:08] of them because he knoweth not how to go
[1:41:11] to the city all right so these
[1:41:14] scriptures all about wise men are
[1:41:15] gracious but fools have too many words
[1:41:23] now it says the directions of a fool
[1:41:25] we're ease you because he doesn't know
[1:41:27] the way to the city he's guessing a
[1:41:30] church that's what we don't want to do
[1:41:31] in this life we don't want to guess on
[1:41:33] what we should do for God we don't want
[1:41:36] to guess on things in our family we
[1:41:38] don't want to guess on things in the
[1:41:39] church we want to know exactly what the
[1:41:41] Word of God says about it and program
[1:41:43] said that's my job as a pastor my job as
[1:41:46] a pastor is to tell you what's in the
[1:41:48] Word of God amen
[1:41:50] well Graham said the gifts of the Spirit
[1:41:52] are to tell you things that are not
[1:41:54] written in the Word of God that's
[1:41:56] exactly right
[1:41:56] but the pastor's job is to tell you
[1:41:59] what's in the Word of God verse 16 and
[1:42:02] 17 almost there in these scriptures
[1:42:05] leaders often determine your success
[1:42:09] the leaders verse 16 woe to the O land
[1:42:16] when thy King is a child and thy
[1:42:18] Prince's eat in the morning to see whoa
[1:42:22] woe to you if you have a child leader
[1:42:24] someone who's not really training the
[1:42:26] Word of God look at that spiritually
[1:42:28] verse 17 and this was our text - blessed
[1:42:32] art Thou O land when that king is the
[1:42:33] Sun of nobles and thy Prince's eat in
[1:42:36] due season for strength and not for
[1:42:39] drunkenness this is why the Bible says a
[1:42:41] passer cannot be a novice it can't be
[1:42:44] somebody who just got saved because they
[1:42:46] don't know how to rule they haven't
[1:42:48] lived a godly Christian life they're
[1:42:50] probably not up all the steps of the
[1:42:52] statute of perfect man so how can they
[1:42:54] lead you if they haven't walked those
[1:42:56] steps already amen praise God that's why
[1:43:00] I thank God when God called me
[1:43:01] I was already a deacon I was already
[1:43:03] preaching for a while brother Brooke saw
[1:43:06] that he saw the the godly character of
[1:43:08] me that I'd walked up the king's highway
[1:43:10] amen and so your name me as a deacon and
[1:43:13] ordained me to preach and then he
[1:43:14] ordained me to pastor so see leaders
[1:43:17] often determine the success that we have
[1:43:22] verse 18 let me I'm gonna try to end up
[1:43:25] with this here yeah it goes with this
[1:43:26] here by much slothfulness the building
[1:43:33] decay a--the and through idleness of the
[1:43:36] hands the house droppeth through a feast
[1:43:40] is made for laughter and wine maketh
[1:43:41] merry but money answereth all things
[1:43:44] curse not the king no not in thy thought
[1:43:48] and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber
[1:43:50] for a bird of the air shall carry the
[1:43:52] voice and that which hath wings shall
[1:43:54] tell the matter look at verse 18 let's
[1:43:56] go back up to that as we're finished
[1:43:58] here a building decays because people
[1:44:04] are slothful maokai we kind of talked
[1:44:05] about that last night a building decays
[1:44:08] because the people are lazy like we were
[1:44:12] talking about it which store would you
[1:44:14] in a shop at the one that's falling
[1:44:16] apart would you want to come to this
[1:44:17] church if these ceiling tiles are
[1:44:19] falling in probably not now it's
[1:44:23] different if we don't have the money to
[1:44:24] do it but if we have the money to do it
[1:44:25] we should take care of what we got right
[1:44:28] so this is the the the principle that
[1:44:32] God is is giving us here if we're
[1:44:35] slothful things fall apart they rot and
[1:44:37] decay now this happens in marriages all
[1:44:40] the time this is why there's divorces
[1:44:42] all the time people don't take care of
[1:44:44] their marriage right they don't invest
[1:44:47] in their marriage they don't time they
[1:44:49] don't take time to love and talk and
[1:44:51] forgive with their husbands and wives so
[1:44:53] the family decays it rots and it dies
[1:44:55] and then divorces happen
[1:44:58] they're slothful they're lazy instead of
[1:45:01] talking about the problems they joke
[1:45:03] about the problems or they ignore the
[1:45:04] problems this is why finances fall apart
[1:45:07] people are slothful with finances or not
[1:45:09] keeping track of all their finances
[1:45:12] anything that falls apart
[1:45:14] many of the times it falls apart because
[1:45:17] people don't take enough time to take
[1:45:19] care of it
[1:45:22] relationships like we said finances
[1:45:24] churches buildings they don't take the
[1:45:28] time search we can't let things go we
[1:45:31] can't let responsibilities go that we
[1:45:33] know we've got to take care of we've got
[1:45:35] to focus on them we've got to force
[1:45:36] ourselves to keep our responsibilities
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] exactly right I don't think any of you
[1:45:43] want your relationships to fall apart do
[1:45:47] you you don't want your finances to fall
[1:45:49] apart we don't want this church to fall
[1:45:51] apart if this church starts falling
[1:45:53] apart somebody let me know we got to get
[1:45:55] something got to get some new drywall or
[1:45:56] what what we got to do we can't let
[1:45:59] things fall apart because Malachi and I
[1:46:01] saw a place last night it's literally
[1:46:03] falling apart right Malachi it's
[1:46:04] literally you know in the bathroom that
[1:46:08] the tiles falling apart
[1:46:11] it's just for the things just look like
[1:46:14] they're falling apart we can't be
[1:46:16] slothful we've got to be diligent and as
[1:46:19] our title is the lies are persistent the
[1:46:23] whys keep working the lies know what
[1:46:26] they're called to do so they don't quit
[1:46:28] they don't get slothful they don't get
[1:46:30] idle and do nothing they just don't sit
[1:46:31] back and try to relax
[1:46:33] they have a work and they know what
[1:46:35] they're called to do how many know what
[1:46:36] they're called to do let me read these
[1:46:39] closes we're closed let's stand to our
[1:46:40] feet
[1:46:40] let me read these from brother Branham
[1:46:46] brother Branham said Jesus was
[1:46:48] criticized from the time he was a baby
[1:46:50] until the time he died on the cross did
[1:46:54] it stop him no sir what was his goal
[1:46:57] always do that which pleased the father
[1:47:00] so Jesus always had a goal so he wasn't
[1:47:04] slothful and he his spiritual life
[1:47:07] didn't decay and he didn't miss the will
[1:47:10] of God his only goal was I always do
[1:47:14] that which pleased the father now how
[1:47:16] many one that kind of a goal my goodness
[1:47:18] hey I don't know if that can be our goal
[1:47:21] tonight we just want a service that
[1:47:23] pleases God tonight I just want to sing
[1:47:27] a song that
[1:47:28] pleases god I just want to preach a
[1:47:29] sermon that priest pleases God
[1:47:32] I just want to here's a message and
[1:47:33] apply to my life that pleases God amen
[1:47:38] that's his goal was to always please God
[1:47:44] but the RAM said the word perseverance
[1:47:47] means to be persistent and persistent in
[1:47:50] making a goal or doing something every
[1:47:58] man in all ages that's ever made
[1:48:01] anything out of themselves or done
[1:48:03] anything would be persistent in the
[1:48:06] thing they were trying to achieve and
[1:48:09] before you can be persistent you have to
[1:48:11] have faith in what you're trying to
[1:48:13] achieve if you haven't got faith in what
[1:48:15] you're trying to do you will never be
[1:48:17] able to do it amen
[1:48:25] so see what happens first church first
[1:48:28] you have to have faith and what is faith
[1:48:30] faith is a revelation help me know that
[1:48:34] first God has to reveal to you what you
[1:48:37] have to do and then you have to set your
[1:48:40] goal to it for example like brother
[1:48:46] Branham and remember 1962 brother
[1:48:48] Branham had a dream or a vision about
[1:48:51] store up tapes at the tabernacle so what
[1:48:54] did he do he turned down the invitations
[1:48:56] to go preach and he stayed at home he
[1:48:59] had a goal right until the end of 62
[1:49:03] when he had that dream or he had the
[1:49:06] dream and the voice told him to go move
[1:49:08] out west so he he kept the will of God
[1:49:12] he did what he was supposed to do until
[1:49:13] God moved into the next thing he had a
[1:49:16] goal and he had to keep his eyes on the
[1:49:18] goal until he achieved the goal that's
[1:49:22] right
[1:49:26] brother Ram
[1:49:28] set as he says what are you drifting for
[1:49:32] anyone ever feel like they're just
[1:49:34] drifting through life I'm not sure where
[1:49:35] I'm going not sure what I'm doing not
[1:49:38] sure what I'm supposed to be doing I
[1:49:40] drift from this I drift of that brother
[1:49:43] madam says you're going somewhere how
[1:49:45] many people are going somewhere tonight
[1:49:47] what are you drifting for get some
[1:49:50] ambition about you set your goal on
[1:49:53] Christ and he says quit tallying with
[1:49:55] the world hallelujah praise God amen
[1:50:01] that's beautiful
[1:50:03] we got to set our goal on Jesus Christ
[1:50:06] the word ha thank you Lord what's our
[1:50:19] goal church what's your goal let's
[1:50:20] Comerica come here to the piano just
[1:50:27] play that song pleasing I want to be
[1:50:28] pleasing what's your goal tonight Church
[1:50:30] that's where as I was studying preparing
[1:50:32] and praying this morning that's kind of
[1:50:33] thought I had the wise are persistent
[1:50:36] each one of us have to have a goal and I
[1:50:39] found this to be true I don't have my my
[1:50:41] planner but I bought a planner and for
[1:50:43] the last year I've been writing off my
[1:50:44] goals for every day and I have never
[1:50:47] felt so focused in all my life in fact
[1:50:49] it was called the full focused planner
[1:50:51] that I bought but I'll be honest I I
[1:50:54] never was more focused in my life than I
[1:50:57] feel like this last year and you know
[1:51:00] what you know what writing it you know
[1:51:01] what the secret to writing it out is it
[1:51:03] causes you to meditate when you've got a
[1:51:06] pen and you've got a paper and you start
[1:51:09] writing out what your goals are for the
[1:51:11] next day or that day it forces you to
[1:51:13] meditate on things it causes you to
[1:51:17] focus it makes you stop where there's so
[1:51:19] many distractions of things going on
[1:51:21] sitting it down alone and writing out
[1:51:23] things makes you meditate upon them
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:28] brother branham said I like somebody who
[1:51:30] has an admission in their life in other
[1:51:32] words they have a goal I'm trying to
[1:51:34] achieve this how many want to be that
[1:51:37] kind of person I do I don't want to get
[1:51:40] up and say well what are what's gonna
[1:51:42] happen today wonder what I should be
[1:51:44] doing today I want to know God's leading
[1:51:46] before I start the day praise God I want
[1:51:50] to know what I feel that to do and that
[1:51:54] only comes through prayer prayer reading
[1:51:57] the word hearing the voice of God don't
[1:52:00] you like to hear the voice of God in
[1:52:01] quietness you got to get quiet with God
[1:52:06] this has been quite night to hear God's
[1:52:08] voice glory oh I'm so thankful for the
[1:52:13] voice of my Savior the voice of Jesus
[1:52:17] Christ let's just pray Heavenly Father
[1:52:23] we thank you Lord that your son had a
[1:52:24] goal always do that which please to the
[1:52:28] father and your prophet told us Lord not
[1:52:33] to drift but to get some ambition about
[1:52:38] us to set our goal on Christ well I just
[1:52:43] pray you to show to each person tonight
[1:52:45] those here those listening and Lord I
[1:52:48] just of course pray for all those in our
[1:52:50] church who are members of our church by
[1:52:51] the baptism of the Spirit because we
[1:52:54] don't believe in natural membership by
[1:52:56] letter or paper or signing a book I just
[1:53:04] pray that each one in our church dear
[1:53:06] God
[1:53:06] would have some ambition and set their
[1:53:08] goal on Christ and quit tattling with
[1:53:11] the world if their dowling in the things
[1:53:13] of the world
[1:53:15] granite Lord Jesus the wisdom are wise
[1:53:18] they're not going to let their spiritual
[1:53:20] lives decay they're not gonna let their
[1:53:22] family life or their marriages the cave
[1:53:23] they're not gonna let their finances
[1:53:25] decay and rot away and avoid
[1:53:28] responsibilities they're gonna have
[1:53:30] ambitions they're gonna know what they
[1:53:32] need to get done to glorify God because
[1:53:35] they know the Bible says whatever you
[1:53:37] find and do do it with all your mind
[1:53:41] and the New Testament says the same do
[1:53:43] it with all your heart do it heartily as
[1:53:45] unto the Lord help us to be the best
[1:53:47] parents we can meet the best students we
[1:53:50] can meet the best teachers we can be the
[1:53:52] mesh workers we can be the best
[1:53:54] grandparents we can be the best brother
[1:53:57] and sister we can be help us to do all
[1:54:00] that we can with all of our nights while
[1:54:03] we can work for time and chance happen
[1:54:07] to us all we know there's no chance with
[1:54:08] you but to us it seems like time and
[1:54:10] chance because we can't predict
[1:54:13] everything we don't know everything we
[1:54:17] need your help your gut help us to have
[1:54:19] that goal we'll always do that which
[1:54:21] pleases Christ help us to have ambition
[1:54:24] help us to meditate on what you called
[1:54:26] us to do and bring our bodies into
[1:54:30] subjection to achieve those purposes in
[1:54:35] Jesus Christ name Church said amen
[1:54:39] praise God thank the Lord
[1:54:52] oh I'm so glad my goal is Jesus Christ
[1:54:56] that's my goal I know what my ambition
[1:54:58] is it's to please the father is to do
[1:55:01] what the father has asked me to do
[1:55:05] did you know brother Adam said his his
[1:55:08] goal in life for his calling in life was
[1:55:09] to pray for sick people he knew what he
[1:55:11] was supposed to do that's why he drive
[1:55:14] around and sometimes he'd be late for
[1:55:15] church now I don't recommend that for us
[1:55:18] unless you're called to pray for the
[1:55:20] sick but it was so his burden he would
[1:55:24] be late for church on prayer calls
[1:55:26] because the angel told him you were born
[1:55:28] to pray for sick people Oh God god help
[1:55:33] us to know what we were born for he
[1:55:35] meant what was I born to do and then
[1:55:40] once he shows it to me I better do with
[1:55:42] all my heart

[1:58:01] particular end a desire for activity or
[1:58:08] exertion in other words and if one
[1:58:11] person I could ever say I met that had
