[18:48] see yourselves it solves spiritual
[18:52] solids and hands Lord no wonder Oregon
[18:58] thank you for this opportunity meeting
[19:01] your house lesbo lorises late for so
[19:04] long
[19:05] appraisers bless this Bible study but we
[19:07] always want to read your word before we
[19:09] get into your word Lord we're just gonna
[19:12] pray tonight just pray for the bread of
[19:14] life right here so let's our scriptures
[19:16] would be trying to teach the other juror
[19:18] I'm sure this is not a study on prayer
[19:20] will be a great provider time for us
[19:22] those of us who serve the Lord longer
[19:24] you're already walking on a narrow road
[19:27] dear Lord bless my time here at Jesus
[19:31] Christ there is it maybe maybe let's do
[19:48] the school about sitting here with the
[19:50] children
[19:50] I'm sending on prayer today God's grace
[19:55] you'll be gone over justification that
[19:58] we baptism and looked at sanctification
[20:00] and I just thought prayer would be good
[20:03] because prayer is what's going to lead
[20:05] you closer to God hearing the word is
[20:09] important but prayer is going to help
[20:10] you live that word as you pray it's
[20:12] going to open up the word to you and the
[20:16] universe's of you have been baptized and
[20:18] if you want to grow closer to the Lord
[20:19] the way to do that instead that
[20:21] individual prayers
[20:23] with if any of you've been thinking
[20:26] about that since we did our last Bible
[20:28] study something you've been thinking
[20:29] maybe getting away of praying alone with
[20:32] the Lord
[20:36] well this you know I went back this is
[20:38] notes and I want to look at first of all
[20:41] how God's house is the house of prayer
[20:42] let's go to Matthew 21 this is a great
[20:45] place to pray Matthew 21 verse hey now
[20:52] you 5 cover this story this way Jesus
[20:54] cleaned out the temple he did it twice
[20:57] he did at the beginning of his ministry
[20:58] that you'll read I needed at the end of
[21:01] this ministry first in the last shadow
[21:05] floors there but let's look at this here
[21:09] and we'll look at a few more scriptures
[21:12] but you know our families come in church
[21:16] so often we love each other so much this
[21:19] is a good time you don't to come and
[21:22] pray by ourselves I know you're young
[21:23] you want to play with each other and
[21:24] your your best playmates that's
[21:27] wonderful that's wonderful
[21:28] as you want to grow closer to the Lord
[21:30] you know perhaps the Lord will start
[21:32] putting a little burden on your heart to
[21:34] come in and pray for services a bit or
[21:37] maybe stay a little bit afterwards and
[21:38] pray but that's what God wants in this
[21:41] this this building right here and he
[21:43] wants you to pray seek him to this this
[21:45] place right now he said my house is the
[21:48] house so Matthew 21 you read uh I did 11
[22:29] okay thank you
[22:31] Sarah do you want to do 12 and 13 sorry
[22:37] there might be mothers in the nursery
[22:40] don't want to hear this and thank you I
[23:15] never noticed that recently what should
[23:18] they never but verse 14 in the blind the
[23:20] lame came to him in the temple and He
[23:21] healed them so right after cleaning out
[23:23] the house
[23:25] God did super natural wonders and
[23:26] miracles so we want our church to be
[23:29] cleaned out absolutely sit in here you
[23:32] want to clean not that God could group
[23:33] and blessing people there loot seeking
[23:37] different blessings whether it's healing
[23:39] a revelation or the will of God or gifts
[23:41] of the Spirit or anything like that
[23:43] house needs to be cleaned out so I just
[23:46] wrote on here Jesus said the focus of
[23:50] this house should be one what should be
[23:52] the focus crater yeah career we do a lot
[23:55] of preaching and singing but we need to
[23:59] add more prayer don't you think I think
[24:01] I would agree that too it is a house of
[24:04] prayer prayer should be the main thing
[24:06] and Jesus if you know the context of
[24:08] this Jesus was actually cleaning out the
[24:10] quorum of the Gentiles
[24:12] this was the outer cornice wasn't even
[24:14] we'd say the holiest of the places
[24:17] because remember remember the middle
[24:19] wall partition and preach on that
[24:20] recently I think it was left two weeks
[24:21] ago agree to the minimum petition and
[24:24] that's where you know that wall
[24:26] separated the Gentiles from the Jews and
[24:29] so this was even considered an unholy
[24:32] place we'd say not as holy as the other
[24:34] places and Jesus clean
[24:37] that out so Jesus wants all of the
[24:39] church cleaned out and he said my house
[24:42] should be called a house of prayer so
[24:44] the focus was on money right the focus
[24:46] was on making money and Jesus said my
[24:50] house the focus needs to be on prayer so
[24:53] that's why you know you heard me ask the
[24:54] adults and everybody to come and pray
[24:56] before service great to stay afterwards
[24:59] I'm pray too but it isn't so important
[25:02] to have the pray in the house of God
[25:05] Jesus said my house will be a house of
[25:07] prayer let's look at the first time when
[25:11] Jesus appeared the temple it was John
[25:13] 2:16 and 17 shouting to 617 yep 2:16 and
[25:31] 17 take these things hence make not my
[25:38] father's house an House of merchandise
[25:40] disciples remember Jesus cleared out the
[25:47] temple in his first year ministry and
[25:48] his last year ministry at least people
[25:51] weren't born again so they couldn't keep
[25:52] their own house clean if we have the
[25:55] Holy Spirit though what do you think
[25:56] should we be able to keep our house
[25:57] clean yeah we should have to wait two
[25:59] years to get it cleaned out all right we
[26:02] should God should be able to minister to
[26:03] us on a Wednesday night or a Sunday
[26:05] morning it may be the next week
[26:07] hopefully by next week clean out our
[26:08] lives you should be able to get victory
[26:10] over and he sin or anything that exalts
[26:13] itself in our lives you should go get
[26:15] victory and he said the zeal you know
[26:18] what Co means jealousy never been
[26:21] jealous
[26:21] I know Mike should have been jealous cuz
[26:23] it's hard I've been jealous too when I
[26:25] was a little boy when when your brother
[26:26] sister gets birthday present you ever
[26:28] been jealous I know I've seen my
[26:30] children get jealous they wish so hard I
[26:34] was just the gisbert for me II wish it
[26:37] was yours right and that's how God feels
[26:39] about his house God's jealous like I
[26:41] want your worship occasion cares I want
[26:44] your worship and if we give it to
[26:47] anything else and we don't come here to
[26:48] pray and
[26:49] God's Word and glorify God God his
[26:52] jealousy the disciples said the seal of
[26:56] the jealousy of God's house has eaten up
[26:59] Jesus that means absorb or he was filled
[27:02] with God's jealousy this is not a place
[27:05] of money this is the place of Prayer
[27:07] this is a place of worship
[27:12] you probably children you've probably
[27:14] seen over the last few months you've
[27:16] seen a few people here early prank I've
[27:18] you seen nothing I did anything that
[27:19] makes me feel when I see people praying
[27:21] in the early reports rich happy off the
[27:25] other but also humbles me really well
[27:27] lord help me to help myself with people
[27:29] are here praying early right they want
[27:31] to hear from God and then I guess I have
[27:33] to check myself say lord please appear
[27:35] and make sure I've already prayed before
[27:36] but it just gives another reminder I
[27:39] want to pure heart I just want to preach
[27:41] God's Word when you see people praying
[27:44] and hungry for more of God's Word you
[27:46] want to be a vessel for God so prayer is
[27:49] a powerful powerful thing Jesus threw
[27:53] over their tables and whip them you can
[27:58] you imagine can you imagine Jesus taking
[28:00] this table right here throwing it over
[28:04] it's hard to imagine I love it because
[28:06] he's we know he's so full of love God so
[28:08] loved I know it's hard for me to imagine
[28:09] - or flipping over some of your tears
[28:11] brother branham said if God came to some
[28:13] of our churches today in Jesus he might
[28:15] flip over some of our chairs if the
[28:18] focus wasn't on prayer it wasn't on the
[28:21] word God worship he said perhaps there
[28:24] might be some more pew jumping people
[28:26] might have to jump over views to get out
[28:28] because God wants his house focused on
[28:31] prayer so think about that as we come
[28:34] Wednesday and maybe next week - maybe I
[28:37] can come to pray to do many times when
[28:42] I've been there you know suspended up
[28:44] study but sometimes I'm just on my knees
[28:45] pray and I know I'm just my face is off
[28:48] the carpet say God moved by the Holy
[28:50] Spirit who speak to the people and I got
[28:54] a text right after service today my wife
[28:56] for them to me which is really nice
[28:57] saying the Lord spoke to me today
[29:00] that was speaking today that's why we
[29:04] come to the house it works with value
[29:05] people will pray for God to speaker than
[29:08] God will speak that's why the comfort of
[29:10] the house of God so eating me up means
[29:13] God has captured my entire attention or
[29:16] my affection so the disciples look at
[29:19] Jesus and said Wow
[29:21] Jesus's full attention is on God Jesus
[29:26] does not paying any attention to money
[29:27] or he's not paying any attention to
[29:29] getting rich all his attention is on God
[29:33] I want people to pray when they come to
[29:36] church I don't want them to worry about
[29:37] making money that's a that's a beautiful
[29:41] story they saw in Jesus the zeal of God
[29:44] the jealousy of God now I'm going to
[29:47] show you where Jesus was quoting from
[29:50] Jesus just wasn't making this up he was
[29:52] actually quoting isaiah 50:6 let's go
[29:54] down as a 36 verse 1 they have 56 verse
[29:59] 1 the seal of my house eaten me up
[30:12] say it 56
[30:32] are you okay thank you
[31:54] now I want to try six and seven by also
[32:02] the stranger the largest served to begin
[32:08] service everyone that he can even then
[32:14] when I reach my holy mountain my house
[32:18] of prayer they're burnt off into the
[32:20] sacrifice it should be accepted to
[32:22] provide altar all right okay so now we
[32:28] know where was Jesus quoting from Isaiah
[32:31] 56 and God is basically just rebuking
[32:35] those who are
[32:36] the word some people were not keeping
[32:38] the Covenant they were working on the
[32:40] Sabbath days God told them the rest they
[32:43] weren't keeping the Sabbath they were
[32:44] breaking the commands of God but those
[32:46] who kept the commands of God what he got
[32:48] promised what do you say what do you say
[32:51] about his holy mountain to bring you
[32:52] where it's my holy mountain and make you
[32:55] feel what joyful my house of prayer
[32:58] enjoyin house is prayer so you know if
[33:02] you keep God's Word how you gonna feel
[33:03] when you come to church you're gonna be
[33:06] a joy Cody
[33:07] you're gonna love coming to church right
[33:08] like the adults do they love to come to
[33:11] church because they're keeping God's
[33:13] covenant and I'm sure we've all seen
[33:15] people that don't like to come to church
[33:16] right because you're not keeping God's
[33:18] covenant but God said I'll make you
[33:21] joyful when you keep my covenant at home
[33:23] keep all the Word of God when you come
[33:25] to my house of prayer I'm gonna make you
[33:27] joyful so we see there's a great
[33:29] connection between keeping the word and
[33:31] then how much you love God's house I
[33:35] just thought you like to see where Jesus
[33:38] was quoting Jesus saying my house must
[33:40] be a house of prayer don't pollute it
[33:43] don't make it about money don't make it
[33:44] about anything else than what it's
[33:46] supposed to be about prayer talking with
[33:48] God and keeping God's commands and
[33:50] hearing God's commands so does that help
[33:53] you now you see where Jesus was quoting
[33:55] from Isaiah 56 here's another one about
[33:59] the house of God solves 93 593 5 and
[34:21] this just talks about the holiness of
[34:22] God God wants his house holy well Jesus
[34:25] was trying to get it holy right and that
[34:28] was by getting all their thoughts off of
[34:30] money and focusing it on prayer so let's
[34:34] all read that one out loud is everybody
[34:35] there 93 fives over there okay let's
[34:39] begin on three one two three
[34:41] my testimonies are very sure holiness
[34:45] becometh thy house o Lord forever so
[34:50] God wants his house holy he wants a
[34:52] sacred set apart so the focus has to be
[34:54] on prayer this House of Prayer must be
[34:57] holy this is a new one that's where he
[35:00] blessed me today Psalm 78 I just came
[35:02] across this one and remember it I forgot
[35:04] about this
[35:05] so I'm 78 58 58 58 to 60 such as these
[35:18] scriptures ya 78589 safety don't change
[35:22] it sorry if I get on 78589 you read 58
[35:37] 59 and Sarah could you do verse 16 thank
[36:08] you okay everybody see what happened
[36:10] here when did God leave the house of God
[36:12] when did he leave the house included
[36:17] with what I know so we preach on idols
[36:19] lately idolatry is the reason people had
[36:22] their names removed off the book of life
[36:24] items right so God said I'm gonna leave
[36:28] the house when people start worshiping
[36:31] other idols even if they came in church
[36:33] if they have idols outside the church
[36:34] God said my spirit is gonna leave that
[36:37] house so we have to make sure we don't
[36:41] have any idols in our lives right
[36:42] nothing is more important I know it's
[36:45] hard for children but think about what
[36:46] do you love most what do you love to do
[36:49] when you have free time what's the
[36:51] funded what's the most wonderful thing
[36:53] you can do now eventually as you grow
[36:56] older you want to have to be the Lord
[36:58] you want God to be your heart's desire
[37:01] no idols or anything like that nothing
[37:04] more important than the Lord okay that's
[37:08] what you want to grow so she do have
[37:09] been baptized and you want to be
[37:11] sanctified you want to get cleaned out
[37:13] for God God has to become number one he
[37:16] has to be your heart's desire we of
[37:20] course will be patient pray for you just
[37:22] like my mom prayed for me how you get my
[37:23] heart Lord Thomas 19 but we just want to
[37:26] point you and teach you in the right
[37:27] direction like train them up in the way
[37:29] they should go when they're old on that
[37:31] apart from it so we can see God we leave
[37:33] the house when the people set up idols
[37:36] that's because he's jealous over his
[37:37] house he wants his house focused on him
[37:41] prayer all right now let's look at a
[37:43] little bit scriptures on Jesus in prayer
[37:46] let's go to Luke 6:12 now if I could
[37:50] read this one Luke 6:12 before Jesus
[37:53] called his disciples let's see how long
[37:57] he prayed 6:12 so before he made a big
[38:06] move in the ministry let's see what all
[38:19] night before he started this ministry
[38:21] with these twelve here's another one
[38:29] this with a mark 644 Jesus was of course
[38:32] a man of Prayer no he was God's image as
[38:39] well in God's sight but that body still
[38:41] needed to pray that he still had to obey
[38:44] the Spirit that was inside of it
[38:46] so mark 644 644
[39:17] 6:44 k Thank You Lydia do you wanna read
[39:34] 45 and 46 it's great way he constrains
[39:42] his disciples to get into the ship and
[39:46] [Music]
[39:49] we need the valet key departing to the
[39:51] mountain to pray alright let me read a
[39:55] little bit more of the context of what
[39:57] happened here so Jesus had just spent
[40:00] the 5000 right right 75,000 and
[40:03] immediately after that what did he do
[40:05] pray he went right to prayer after a
[40:08] miracle
[40:08] so see what miracles you see what
[40:13] miracles oughta make us do should have
[40:15] make us exalted and prideful or should
[40:17] it humble us yeah I should humbles look
[40:23] how look how America humbled Jesus he
[40:26] fed 5,000 people how many baskets that
[40:28] have remaining remember think was 12 or
[40:30] 7 I guess either covers up when deer 75
[40:34] members that was it fella
[40:36] okay well but it kept them humble and I
[40:42] hope that's what happens you have a good
[40:44] service and what you really do is I hope
[40:45] that makes you want to go home and just
[40:46] praise the lord or maybe on the drive
[40:48] home just worship the word I've had to
[40:50] have been many times like on Sunday
[40:52] nights when I get home children
[40:53] sometimes you know you're doing your
[40:54] playing I might just go up at the Ruby
[40:56] just pray for the long time just
[40:58] thanking the Lord you know for his word
[41:01] and how he's blessed us throughout that
[41:03] day and then if you know what happened
[41:06] after that then you know he said the
[41:08] disciples in the boat he goes out to
[41:09] meet them he walks on water they think
[41:11] he's their seen a spirit but it was
[41:13] actually God in flesh as God in Christ
[41:15] and then look at verse 52
[41:19] but they consider not the miracle the
[41:20] loaves for their heart was hardened so
[41:22] part of me I'm just this is just my
[41:23] thoughts hildren but it seems like Jesus
[41:26] went to pray because he just did a
[41:27] miracle and that they didn't even
[41:31] understand what this America was about
[41:32] they didn't even understand that it's
[41:33] not about the natural loaves it's about
[41:35] spiritual bread
[41:37] it's about receiving the Word of God but
[41:40] I think in a parallel passage he also
[41:41] warned them about the leaven of the
[41:43] Pharisees of the Sadducees so Jesus
[41:46] didn't Americo and he's just seeing all
[41:47] my disciple and all they saw was the
[41:49] natural they didn't actually see that
[41:51] what's important here is the spiritual
[41:53] bread of God so he prays he goes to
[41:55] their praise then goes out and meets
[41:57] them on the water so Jesus had a
[42:00] personal prayer life even after the best
[42:02] services he would go out and pray
[42:04] instead more time with them
[42:09] we got a little bit more time in there I
[42:11] got plenty scripture of us go to Matthew
[42:13] 6 first one let's look at Jesus's
[42:15] personal teaching on a personal prayer
[42:18] that we could pray Matthew 6 now the
[42:36] first 4 verses about alms but worried
[42:39] that anyway because children even you
[42:40] can do nice things for others right even
[42:42] though you don't have a job
[42:43] what arms could children give think
[42:45] about that what what could you give to
[42:47] help somebody out who doesn't have
[42:48] something damn toys maybe got a nice
[42:53] channel used toy what else could you
[42:56] give to something you might have some
[42:58] money to get right like grandpa said you
[43:00] got money you might have some money to
[43:02] give I think you've done yeah I remember
[43:05] they yeah some of you had done that
[43:06] before some that pepper you some of you
[43:11] done that before which is wonderful you
[43:14] see somebody who doesn't had a lot of
[43:15] money and you say daddy you give this
[43:17] money to that person let's read about
[43:21] alms here already a little bit if you
[43:23] guys don't read a lot take heed that you
[43:25] do not your alms before men to be seen
[43:27] of them otherwise you have no reward of
[43:29] your father which is it's heaven there
[43:33] without newest items you're not sounding
[43:34] trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do
[43:37] in the synagogues and in the streets but
[43:39] they may have glory of men verily I say
[43:41] to you they have their reward that's why
[43:44] we don't go down some face look if we're
[43:46] gonna do something nice or we don't
[43:47] announce it
[43:48] you don't put a sign outside the church
[43:50] and say hey we're gonna give to the poor
[43:51] today that's ok people do that but
[43:54] they're actually have their reward but
[43:57] I'm glad they're giving of course we're
[43:59] glad they want to give verse 3 when thou
[44:03] doest alms let not thy left hand know
[44:06] what thy right hand do that man almost
[44:10] may be in secret and thy father which
[44:12] seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
[44:15] now let's read about triggers so they
[44:18] were back to back on ok I can read
[44:22] verses just for his spy so where do they
[44:37] like to pray at where the hypocrites
[44:39] like you like to be like this not you
[44:41] said and I'll just pray for everybody
[44:43] right up here everybody see me praying
[44:46] look at me everybody
[44:48] sir be Sidney Frank Lydia you see my
[44:51] prayer I'm just gonna bring carrots look
[44:54] at me on brains they love it and back
[44:58] now boys and girls that's funny but that
[45:00] that's just backed by the only time they
[45:02] really pray hypocrites they just want to
[45:05] pray in front of other people they don't
[45:07] have the next kind of prayer that Jesus
[45:09] is talking about because their favorite
[45:12] prayers our longest prayers up in front
[45:14] of everybody and especially as me as a
[45:16] pastor as much as I'm in front of
[45:17] everybody I've got to make sure my
[45:18] prayers are longer by myself at the
[45:22] front of the church I got to constantly
[45:24] make sure my most sincere prayers are
[45:27] not to be seen of men but they're
[45:29] actually in private prayer we've got so
[45:34] let's look at Lydia verse 6 and then
[45:37] Sarah Cooper seventies
[45:43] how much I pray to thy father which is
[45:45] in secret and thy father which seeth in
[45:47] secret shall reward you thank you thank
[46:06] you
[46:06] so it's God interested in how many words
[46:09] you say no not interested how many words
[46:13] you say what's he interested in serially
[46:18] you say what you have to say yeah and
[46:20] where should you go okay so what we want
[46:22] to pray and seek the Lord or somewhere
[46:26] private right
[46:27] like if I'm here is there a closet I can
[46:30] pray here if I'm all about this now no
[46:32] so just a private place that in your
[46:34] home
[46:35] yeah go to a small private place we're
[46:37] doing that and then what does God
[46:40] promise to do that he'll go to what will
[46:42] you do if you pray in secret what will
[46:44] he do
[46:44] reward you open because the father is
[46:48] only one who sees in secret right he's
[46:50] only one the song so make sure you
[46:52] blesses you let's go a little bit
[46:55] further here I want to read the Lord's
[47:00] Prayer and I know every the prayer of
[47:04] Jabez again to show you how preached a
[47:06] whole series on that in 2013 I want to
[47:08] just show again the similarities between
[47:10] the Lord's Prayer and shape the prayer
[47:12] of K best
[47:13] okay so verse 8 be not ye therefore like
[47:17] unto them for your father knoweth what
[47:19] things ye have need of before you ask
[47:21] you so again it's not about how many
[47:23] words you stay but it's just about
[47:27] coming before the Lord and express to
[47:29] yourself he knows what you have Nina but
[47:35] of course he still wants us to pray it
[47:38] doesn't matter how many times am I gonna
[47:39] repeat this over and over I gotta say it
[47:41] over and over again God save my mom God
[47:43] take my dad that's what I might pray
[47:45] over and over yeah but it's not about
[47:47] just repeating the number of words it's
[47:49] about your heart condition now verse 9
[47:53] after this manner therefore pray to our
[47:57] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[48:00] thy name
[48:01] so how should we address God everybody
[48:04] what should we call God where you say
[48:08] dad although it means sacred or set
[48:15] apart that your name you said apart
[48:16] member last Sunday night what about the
[48:18] books preach on that study night the
[48:21] name of Jesus yeah the power of the name
[48:23] so he's got to start by reverencing his
[48:25] name worshiping his name but you need to
[48:29] be holy help me not use the name of
[48:30] Jesus your ever away I'll be to respect
[48:33] within to the Jesus we start off by
[48:35] calling father and you worship his name
[48:39] verse 10 let thy kingdom come let thy
[48:42] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[48:44] so should we tell god what to do o we
[48:47] should say I let your will be W before I
[48:49] even pray may your name be glorified
[48:51] that your will be done through this
[48:53] prayer dear God now whether sometimes
[48:56] God lets us know his will yeah if he let
[48:59] that's called a revelation if he makes
[49:00] known to you what's gonna happen then
[49:02] you just pray for that you pray for that
[49:05] if you don't know like many times here
[49:07] we don't know if all these people's sick
[49:09] all these prayer requests we see lord if
[49:11] it be your will when you you know we
[49:13] asked for healing please heal please
[49:16] send deliverance send something they
[49:18] need but we always want to ask for God's
[49:20] will and then verse 11 give us this day
[49:26] our daily bread so is it okay to ask
[49:28] Jesus for what you have need of today
[49:30] yes Lord bless our service or Lord
[49:33] please provide this please provide that
[49:35] we have so much in America there's not
[49:37] too many things we worry about each day
[49:39] right but we can still ask the Lord ask
[49:42] God bless our day but our prayer should
[49:45] be more like who can we help today right
[49:47] because we have to worry about food not
[49:50] much for your we should thank God for
[49:52] the food and pray for the food but we're
[49:55] not like praying God I don't have
[49:56] anything in the fridge help me now some
[49:58] people might right but we should pray
[50:01] lord help me to touch somebody's life
[50:03] today I mean that help somebody out who
[50:06] doesn't have food or does it have money
[50:08] or help me to find some limit pray
[50:10] Lord put somebody on my heart you're
[50:11] pretty cool verse 12 and forgive us our
[50:15] debts as we forgive our debtors
[50:18] so it's forgiveness important yeah
[50:20] should be part of your daily prayer
[50:22] forgive me Lord when I hurt Lydia
[50:24] forgive me when I hurt so and so and God
[50:26] help me to forgive those who hurt me
[50:28] help me to forgive forgiveness should be
[50:31] part of your prayers every day verse 13
[50:36] and lead us not into temptation but
[50:38] deliver us from evil
[50:41] so is it okay to ask God to help me get
[50:43] up Lord deliver me from this situation
[50:45] is that okay yes Lord this is so hard
[50:48] God this temptation is so difficult
[50:50] deliver me Lord
[50:51] that's something you could pray every
[50:53] time you pray and then he says for thine
[51:00] is the kingdom the power the glory
[51:02] forever amen so you closed with saying
[51:04] God all the glory yours all the praise
[51:06] is yours be glorified be magnified let
[51:10] your kingdom come
[51:12] okay like that prick and what a great
[51:15] prayer it is Jesus gives us the bottle
[51:18] of how to pray so let's go to the prayer
[51:21] of Jabez I think you'll see a lot of
[51:22] similarities it's verse chronicles 4:8
[51:24] 1st chronicles 4:8 that's one thing that
[51:29] struck me right away first chronicles
[51:30] 4:8 Kings Kings chronicles and crackers
[51:35] first chronicles 4:8 yep first
[51:44] chronicles for 8 now 8 is the lineage
[51:54] there I think we just started verses
[52:04] honey let's not go here at milk and I
[52:08] thank you read verse today first rivals
[52:10] for night verse 10
[52:39] thank you who can see something that's
[52:41] similar to the Lord's Prayer did he see
[52:43] anything similar in there what do you
[52:45] see that's similar to the Lord's Prayer
[52:48] he for me evil very good now kind of key
[52:51] people to do what you see okay very good
[52:54] yep and it got on to this prayer yeah I
[53:01] think got out of this prayer sincere
[53:04] where did he want God in his life yeah
[53:10] number one what words that his exact
[53:12] words were looking at verse 10 or do you
[53:14] want God in his life with you would be
[53:20] with me isn't that a beautiful prayer he
[53:25] say God large my co-star give me more
[53:27] responsibility but only give me more
[53:30] responsibility if you're with me
[53:33] what have you and I believe that's why
[53:37] God honor this other words Lord I want
[53:39] to do something for you children you
[53:40] want do something for the Lord
[53:42] absolutely I do too I'm gonna do
[53:44] something for God but I only want to do
[53:47] it if he's with like that prayer I just
[53:51] think that so me something good to
[53:53] remember and you keep me for me we'll
[53:55] see he hated evil you want to stay as
[53:56] far away from evil as possible but yet
[53:59] do something for the Lord what if God to
[54:02] increase his influence God to increase
[54:03] his ministry so he could do something
[54:06] for God and stay away from evil
[54:08] sometimes I'll pray that God will you
[54:10] please send more families or God will
[54:12] you send me more you know preaching
[54:13] invitations so I can do something for
[54:16] you I just want to do something for it
[54:17] but keep evil keep me away from evil
[54:20] help me not to desire anything evil keep
[54:23] me from that God heard his prayer he
[54:27] granted him his request
[54:31] alright now go to Luke 11 this is
[54:36] probably one of the best things you can
[54:39] pray for right now Luke 11:13 well in
[54:44] case you read this Luke 11:13 this is a
[54:48] parallel passage to what we read in
[54:49] Matthew Jesus was teaching on prayer and
[54:51] he talks about how you ask God for
[54:54] something he's going to give you what
[54:56] you ask for something good not something
[54:59] evil Luke 11:13 okay look up here me
[55:43] don't have to tell me this but think in
[55:45] your heart have you asked God for the
[55:46] baptism of the holy ghost you have to
[55:48] tell me have you asked him for that if
[55:51] not what do you think you should do yeah
[55:57] you have to want that you have to one
[55:59] the Spirit of God in your life after one
[56:02] God to be number one you have to want
[56:03] the power of God in your life so that's
[56:06] something you've been asked for so think
[56:08] about that as you leave here today as
[56:12] we've even little bit about let me set
[56:14] up my prayer go back to moment so jesus
[56:20] said you have to ask you need to ask the
[56:22] Holy Ghost spend some time praying in
[56:24] the Holy Ghost that's really really
[56:27] important some of you been baptized
[56:29] that's what you need to do next to God
[56:31] don't leave the Holy Ghost
[56:32] sanctify my life okay you have to seek
[56:35] God he's only one of my final points
[56:38] prayer is then how you come to know God
[56:42] it's how you really come to know God and
[56:44] hear the word pray that you can receive
[56:49] or so let's prove that a few scriptures
[56:53] been about four or five more scriptures
[56:55] every kind of short is acts 1:14 go to
[56:58] excellent 14 x-14 to Lydia you read acts
[57:17] 1:14 is course about the cycles before
[57:20] Pentecost so they continue doing what
[57:34] gray Jesus said I wanted to fill you
[57:37] with the Holy Ghost when the thing with
[57:38] all that goes being breathed on them and
[57:40] said receive the Holy Ghost receive
[57:42] receive it but what they have to do they
[57:45] that's for that the way they'd asked for
[57:47] that to pray continually than to keep
[57:49] praying for that so what do you I want
[57:52] you to see that this is how you come to
[57:54] know God and member Jesus was with them
[57:56] but he said it's better that what
[57:58] instead of being with them he would be
[58:01] in that very good he said I'm gonna send
[58:04] the comforter in a comfortable movie
[58:06] with you even in you me so they didn't
[58:20] really come to know God and have got on
[58:22] the inside until they had prayed all
[58:25] that time right then the Holy Ghost told
[58:26] them that's when they really knew God
[58:28] because now God is living inside of that
[58:31] okay we just read this one in their
[58:33] house I think Jeremiah 29 so with you
[58:36] know my theory that jeremiah 29:10 and
[58:39] Lydia new to this is one of them
[58:41] people's favorite verses in the whole
[58:43] Bible which it's beautiful verse you
[58:47] have 29 to Jeremiah 29 - I love it too
[58:56] yeah have you read 1011 and then Sarah
[59:02] could maybe read 1213 let me make sure I
[59:06] could yeah I'll read 14 so ten eleven
[59:11] twelve thirteen I reported personal
[59:15] prayers how you get to know God brother
[59:33] branham read that the desperation
[59:35] message me said isn't that sweet
[59:37] you got something sweet I think that's
[59:40] very sweet I know the plans I have for
[59:42] you and you're going to come to an
[59:44] expected and you're going to know what's
[59:45] going to happen to you your know the end
[59:47] of your life thank you when are they
[1:00:07] gonna find God probably gonna find us by
[1:00:10] searching in prayer right is that a hard
[1:00:14] thing to do or is that pretty simple
[1:00:15] they got make it a hard to find him/her
[1:00:17] pretty simple any man any woman can find
[1:00:22] God and can know God through prayer
[1:00:26] it's that Chile that simple going in the
[1:00:30] closet or going someplace private
[1:00:33] jesus said the same thing he's Jesus say
[1:00:36] you have to go pray in front of a
[1:00:37] thousand people to know God really say
[1:00:39] feel pretty that's how close God can be
[1:00:44] to you that wants to meet you in a
[1:00:47] closet is that wonderful God doesn't
[1:00:51] he's that very far unless the member
[1:00:53] Paul said that next seventeen he's not
[1:00:55] far from us he's very close to us but
[1:00:59] that's how we get to know through prayer
[1:01:01] so sweetie said I would plan for keishon
[1:01:04] I would play Pure Life oh yeah I have a
[1:01:07] plan for your life but you've got to see
[1:01:10] inside you search for me with all your
[1:01:13] heart that's what you'll find lady when
[1:01:15] you start praying with all your heart
[1:01:16] that's a goodbye right we got a flat to
[1:01:20] our lives to see God in prayer not read
[1:01:25] 14 and I will be found of you saith the
[1:01:29] Lord now turn away your captive and I
[1:01:32] will gather you from all the nations and
[1:01:36] from all the places with our German you
[1:01:38] say Lord I'll bring you again into the
[1:01:39] place whence I had caused you to be
[1:01:41] carried away captain so how do we get to
[1:01:44] know God what do we have to do we have
[1:01:45] to trim pray call upon his name search
[1:01:50] for a prey that's what you'll find God
[1:01:53] is really enough time with prayer can
[1:01:56] the adult saying that there's four he
[1:02:01] meant - I'll get a fifth day amen that's
[1:02:04] how you get to know God stirred prayer
[1:02:07] so if you've been baptized praise God
[1:02:10] now you're your next calling is to be a
[1:02:12] prayer warrior to get in the closet to
[1:02:15] pray and seek God say God give me the
[1:02:17] Holy Ghost God set me on fire
[1:02:21] help me to win souls for the kingdom of
[1:02:23] God I'm gonna back up a little bit
[1:02:27] Luke 11:13 jesus said if you ask the
[1:02:32] Father for the Holy Ghost will give it
[1:02:34] to you right I told mommy this on the
[1:02:36] way over here
[1:02:38] you guys know Jake evolved all right
[1:02:40] he's learning to teach his Bible come
[1:02:41] with me he just told me on Friday he
[1:02:43] said but if you said brother Jesse said
[1:02:45] when I first came to Bible club four
[1:02:47] years ago he said you taught on prayer
[1:02:49] and he said you taught on Luke 11:13 he
[1:02:52] just coded the scripture to me last
[1:02:54] Thursday and he said you said that Jesus
[1:02:59] taught us to pray for the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:00] said I've been praying for the Holy
[1:03:02] Ghost ever since and he said since then
[1:03:05] God has given me power to do I teaches a
[1:03:08] lot like he and I wrote eight weeks he's
[1:03:10] been oh it's really good teaching God's
[1:03:12] Word and he said I've been praying for
[1:03:14] the Holy Ghost he said the Spirit Holy
[1:03:16] Spirit guide Holy Spirit go with me
[1:03:18] today
[1:03:20] that's what we that's what we can keep
[1:03:22] doing that right and you children that's
[1:03:24] what you can do every day say God I want
[1:03:27] the Holy Ghost is money I want the Holy
[1:03:28] Ghost of guide me you gotta answer your
[1:03:31] prayer it just so simple though the
[1:03:34] Christian faith is so this one this next
[1:03:39] Richard Jeremiah 9 so we were in 29 we
[1:03:41] go go now earlier in the book - Jeremiah
[1:03:43] 9 this just kind of goes along with it I
[1:03:47] think now I read this one night in Bible
[1:03:49] times Lydia I just heard that was such a
[1:03:51] beautiful scripture I he know myself
[1:03:55] because I thought wow that beautiful
[1:03:59] jeremiah 9:23 and 24 if there's one
[1:04:08] thing we could get excited about or
[1:04:12] really feel happy about in our lives the
[1:04:19] scripture tells us what it is right here
[1:04:20] this is one thing I could say now guy I
[1:04:23] just want to tell you something I really
[1:04:25] want to tell you something I'm very
[1:04:26] happy about Jeremiah told us what it is
[1:04:30] let's do jeremiah 9:23 okay did you read
[1:04:35] 23 than the case you can try 24 so I'm
[1:04:49] not going to glory or get excited about
[1:04:50] oh look how strong I am
[1:04:51] look how handsome I am look how smart I
[1:04:54] am right we're not going to do that but
[1:04:58] case you read 24 this is what we should
[1:05:00] get excited to tell the people about
[1:05:30] so we're going to be happy that we have
[1:05:33] something what should we be happy about
[1:05:38] understanding and knowing God I
[1:05:40] understand the Bible this is the first
[1:05:42] time in my life I understand the Bible
[1:05:45] I know God I know Christ the Spirit of
[1:05:47] God is within me
[1:05:49] let a man glory in that now I'm so rich
[1:05:53] I'm so smarter I know all this I know
[1:05:56] this is not the world I know God I know
[1:05:58] his word I understand what he wants done
[1:06:00] today we should glory that that should
[1:06:03] be what we're most excited about is
[1:06:05] knowing God how we get to know God
[1:06:06] through what you seek me you'll find me
[1:06:11] you seek me with all your heart I just
[1:06:15] got two more scriptures zekiel 94 I
[1:06:19] remember this one about sighing and
[1:06:21] crying when you get to know God you get
[1:06:26] to know how he feels about obedience but
[1:06:28] you also get to know God about how he
[1:06:30] feels about what what's the opposite of
[1:06:33] obedience if so means our sin I've seen
[1:06:37] it I know what my truth I've seen you be
[1:06:40] burden for your friends that sin I've
[1:06:42] seen that that's a good attribute I've
[1:06:44] seen you guys rehearse and I know tell
[1:06:46] me the heady how do I talk to my friend
[1:06:48] about this they're doing this they're
[1:06:49] doing that and it's so good you know
[1:06:52] you're getting close to the heart of God
[1:06:54] when your burden for other people sit
[1:06:55] that's what he's he combined forces God
[1:07:03] was gonna spare people from judgment
[1:07:05] because they were sighing and crying for
[1:07:09] all the evils of their friends and
[1:07:11] neighbors and their generation was doing
[1:07:15] that was equal 94 are we different
[1:07:23] and the Lord said unto him go through
[1:07:25] the midst of the city through the midst
[1:07:27] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:07:28] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[1:07:30] cry for all the abominations that be
[1:07:33] done in the midst thereof so as you grow
[1:07:37] closer to Christ children if when you
[1:07:40] really
[1:07:40] love with Christ and really get to know
[1:07:41] him it is gonna hurt you when you see
[1:07:44] people walking and sitting so much so
[1:07:47] that you're gonna cry about you're gonna
[1:07:48] cry about it as Ukraine okay you'll so
[1:07:56] fall in love with God that you'll begin
[1:07:58] to love what he loves and hate what he
[1:08:01] hates and then when you're praying it'll
[1:08:03] just hurt you oh my friend did this God
[1:08:05] have mercy forget them or help their
[1:08:10] heart to be changed I know some of you
[1:08:11] have come up and told me right we've
[1:08:13] talked about that well my friend wore
[1:08:15] this and it was not the right clothes my
[1:08:17] parents told this or my friend did that
[1:08:20] doesn't and it burdens your heart
[1:08:21] doesn't it it's really it should burden
[1:08:24] you that's when you know you're getting
[1:08:26] close to knowing the Lord when you're
[1:08:28] burdened about sin because God hates sin
[1:08:31] as well all right and that is you become
[1:08:36] off spherical Christian later on your
[1:08:37] life you find that prayer is the way to
[1:08:42] build yourself up to become stronger in
[1:08:45] the Lord so we'll just close with that
[1:08:47] Jude chapter 1 verse 20 close to that
[1:08:50] because they have about that hour choose
[1:08:53] 120 we might as well be 29 to 24 so why
[1:09:07] don't we start with Lydia Lydia read 20
[1:09:10] and 21 and maybe Sarah knew 22 23 thank
[1:09:31] you so building up yourselves your most
[1:09:33] holy faith by praying in the spirit
[1:09:35] there you can do 22 and 22
[1:09:53] thank you so there's another scripture
[1:09:56] about how it's it's okay to hate sin you
[1:09:59] see that it's okay to hate the sin you
[1:10:01] love the sinner right but we hate the
[1:10:04] sin we hate that garment that's spotted
[1:10:06] with sin so it's okay they hate sin it
[1:10:10] should burn us we should sign cry for
[1:10:12] the abominations but if you want to
[1:10:14] build up our strength what we got to do
[1:10:16] we have to pray enough in the spirit
[1:10:18] pray in the Holy Spirit see Holy Spirit
[1:10:21] help me as I pray help me to pray your
[1:10:23] heart love me to pray for others forgive
[1:10:25] me help me to forgive others start
[1:10:27] praying in the Holy Spirit and then that
[1:10:32] will make you want to have compassion
[1:10:34] upon others can we save everybody or
[1:10:36] just some people just some some not
[1:10:40] everybody not everybody want to be saved
[1:10:41] I'm trying to have a lot of people I
[1:10:42] know you have to probably children I
[1:10:44] know the doll trap I try to get people
[1:10:46] at church eight books you try to do
[1:10:48] everything you want everybody to be safe
[1:10:50] but the Spirit will guide us to some
[1:10:52] people that we can have compassion on
[1:10:55] and make a difference in their lives and
[1:10:58] then some people we just have to learn
[1:11:00] with fear didn't make them fear God
[1:11:03] pulling them out of the fire
[1:11:04] now guys we'll finish this off with
[1:11:06] verse 24 thank you so did you see that
[1:11:29] and he's able to keep you from falling
[1:11:31] now remember what it say in verse 20 how
[1:11:33] do you build yourself up praying
[1:11:37] grinding the spirit yeah there's plenty
[1:11:39] and praying the spear that builds you up
[1:11:41] and then he's able to keep you from
[1:11:43] falling so we'll see how prayer is
[1:11:45] connected there with building yourself
[1:11:46] up here so that's what we want to do we
[1:11:50] want to build ourselves up through
[1:11:52] prayer okay any questions before we
[1:11:54] finish here children any questions
[1:11:56] alright let's just close with prayer
[1:12:03] and in your heart while I'm praying
[1:12:05] maybe this might be the time to say more
[1:12:08] I want to receive the Holy Spirit this
[1:12:12] might be a good time to pray that I'd be
[1:12:17] good time to say lord help me to pray
[1:12:19] I mean to pray in the closet Lord it
[1:12:24] might help me to be sanctified of me to
