[0:44] few years God has really opened up
[0:46] verses one and two you know to us as far
[0:49] as understanding the perfect will of God
[0:51] hallelujah you know we've looked so much
[0:53] at the permissive will of God and the
[0:54] perfect will of God and everyone has a
[0:57] choice today everyone has a choice today
[0:59] to walk in the perfect will of God full
[1:01] obedience to the word of God or they can
[1:03] walk in the permissive will of God
[1:05] Contin continuing to live life knowing
[1:08] that they're disobeying parts of the
[1:10] word of God but thank God for his grace
[1:12] Hallelujah that we can repent of any
[1:14] mistakes we've made and we can get right
[1:16] back on the perfect will of God
[1:17] hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace

[1:31] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:33] reasonable service let's read verse two
[1:35] ready 1 2 3 and be not conformed to this

[1:50] Blessing to reading of his word you can

[1:58] God Hallelujah okay so I have some U
[2:03] quotes here some scriptures by God's
[2:07] grace it's good to see brother mercy and
[2:09] the the Saints there Hallelujah God
[2:11] bless you
[2:14] Hallelujah so we're looking at part 27
[2:16] here on the book of Romans here uh part
[2:18] or chapter 12 rather by God's grace um
[2:22] brother brand always had a scoffield
[2:23] Bible you know brother mam said he
[2:24] didn't agree with scoffield on
[2:26] everything but it was just the Bible
[2:28] that he was uh raised on you know as a
[2:30] as a young Christian and he always kept
[2:32] it and even up to the end of his life
[2:34] you know I believe it was in 1965 uh
[2:36] brother bram's wife uh bought him a
[2:38] brand new Scofield bible and of course
[2:41] you know he preached that uh uh he
[2:43] preached out of that uh that one sermon
[2:45] birth pains right uh and there's another
[2:48] another important uh sermon right there
[2:50] it's not coming to me right now but
[2:52] right along with birth pains there oh
[2:53] yeah this day the scripture is fulfilled
[2:55] that's right and remember the pages
[2:57] stuck together and a Catholic priest
[2:59] comes up and said God's doing something
[3:01] here hallelujah and uh brother R liking
[3:06] that you know as a type of Jesus you
[3:07] know when Jesus went into the synagogue
[3:09] and I believe it's Luke chapter 4 and
[3:11] opened the scripture and said this day
[3:12] the scripture is fulfilled brother R
[3:14] said that repeated in his time where he
[3:16] was giving warning about birth pains
[3:19] right other words birth pains were
[3:21] starting to begin there you know in
[3:22] brother Ram's uh lifetime in Ministry
[3:25] and that's what we're seeing with the
[3:26] war and in I with Israel right that's a
[3:28] birth pain wars and rumors of wars
[3:31] Hallelujah uh interesting too I preached
[3:33] on Israel on Wednesday night you ever
[3:35] everybody catch that there I I caught
[3:37] that this morning I'm like oh my
[3:38] goodness I didn't even realize what I
[3:39] was doing uh but just a it's a reminder
[3:42] to pray for them remember the Bible said
[3:44] don't boast yourself against Israel
[3:47] right because God can graft us off at
[3:49] any time God can cut off the Gentiles
[3:50] any time now of course he won't cut us
[3:53] off because we're his people but as far
[3:54] as the Gentiles overall as a group of
[3:57] people he can be done with the Gentiles
[3:59] anytime
[4:00] and just finish it right there but God
[4:02] is rich in Mercy praise God and so uh
[4:04] let's just remember to keep Israel in
[4:06] Prayer by God's grace now here's the
[4:09] outline Scofield gives if you have a
[4:10] Scofield bible uh these are the uh
[4:12] sections he kind of divides it up into
[4:14] seven sections um we just finished on
[4:16] Wednesday night whether I didn't realize
[4:18] it I finished you know uh this fifth
[4:20] section and now we're on to the section
[4:22] of the Christian Life and service you
[4:25] know it's quite it's quite awesome to
[4:26] see you know he'll take 11 chapters
[4:29] think about you know if you wrote a real
[4:30] long letter to somebody you know pretend
[4:32] Romans was a letter you'd write to
[4:33] somebody to try to help them understand
[4:35] the gospel you know the first 11
[4:38] chapters he lays out so Gentiles and
[4:41] Jews can understand how God has broken
[4:44] down the Walls between Jews and Gentiles
[4:46] and now we're all God's people praise
[4:49] God hallelujah he blinded most of the
[4:51] Israelis but Jesus said or Paul said
[4:54] there's a remnant of them that can see
[4:55] the gospel praise God and now he's going
[4:58] to take uh these next three chapters
[5:00] here or four chapters I'll just break it
[5:03] down you know if you have a a Scofield
[5:04] bible or any other type of a Bible that
[5:06] that has headings you can kind of see
[5:08] what you know these next few Services
[5:10] we're going to look at by God's grace uh
[5:12] today we're going to look at chapter 12
[5:14] 12's about the gifts of Grace that God
[5:16] gives to each
[5:17] individual and church each one of you
[5:20] have a gift of God some more than others
[5:24] right uh but it's all it's all given
[5:26] based upon God's ability that he gave
[5:29] you before the foundation of the world
[5:32] Hallelujah and then these all these
[5:34] gifts are given to us not by our Merit
[5:37] but by what God wants us to do and
[5:40] therefore our service to one another uh
[5:43] especially to the body of Christ
[5:45] Allelujah because that's what we're
[5:47] going to spend most of our time with
[5:48] right most of our time we spend with the
[5:49] body of Christ I'm talking about our
[5:50] free time right which is our family you
[5:52] know when we're when we leave work we
[5:54] don't just go spend more time with the
[5:56] people at work right we come and spend
[5:57] time with the with the body of Christ
[5:59] Hal Hallelujah and so that that's a very
[6:01] important part of Christianity is uh
[6:04] serving the family of God the body of
[6:07] Christ and so that's what we'll look at
[6:08] today by God's
[6:10] grace and then chapter 13 it's it's it's
[6:13] really interesting you know uh Paul goes
[6:15] into this chapter and he says we must
[6:17] submit to the authorities he was saying
[6:19] we must submit to the Roman
[6:21] government Hallelujah that's what
[6:23] chapter 13 is all about in other words
[6:25] we must obey the laws of man as long as
[6:27] they obey with the laws of God
[6:30] Hallelujah and so of course you know we
[6:32] know if someone uh in the government
[6:34] would tell us to break a law of God we
[6:36] know that we can obey God's word and we
[6:38] of course we have to deal with the
[6:39] consequences maybe God will deliver us
[6:41] maybe God won't but God expect expects
[6:44] expects us sorry God expects us to obey
[6:46] God rather than man Hallelujah but of
[6:49] course uh man has a uh man has a purpose
[6:53] I'm glad you know I'm I'm glad there's
[6:55] policemen they come to my house this
[6:57] week because of the identity theft you
[6:58] know I'm thank f for policemen praise
[7:00] God I'm thankful for law enforcement you
[7:02] know uh they play A Part Hallelujah God
[7:05] can use them for his glory as well and
[7:07] then of course you know uh how love
[7:09] fulfills the whole law in Chapter 13
[7:11] chapter 14 uh Paul's telling the Jews
[7:13] and Gentiles don't judge each other um
[7:17] and he says don't cause others to
[7:19] stumble so make sure and we'll get into
[7:22] these basically Christian Liberties in
[7:23] chapter 14 you know we have these areas
[7:25] of Liberty I wrote about it in my 2019
[7:27] book my first book uh there's all these
[7:29] areas of of Liberty you know uh of
[7:31] course with holidays and wine and uh
[7:34] different uh meats and and diet and
[7:36] things like that you have all these
[7:37] Liberties as a Christian but Paul says
[7:39] never cause someone to stumble in their
[7:41] faith whatever you allow or whatever you
[7:44] feel like you have the LI Liberty to
[7:45] enjoy just make sure you don't cause
[7:47] others to stumble Hallelujah and then
[7:50] chapter 15 now there's a chapter 16 but
[7:53] I I didn't list that here but chapter 16
[7:55] is more of like a letter to those Saints
[7:57] in in Rome uh so we'll maybe just a
[8:00] little bit of time on that one chapter
[8:02] 15 is about all this why is all this
[8:05] important because it follows Christ's
[8:07] example of service to us Christ modeled
[8:12] complete service surrender in order to
[8:15] serve our needs and to help us
[8:17] hallelujah and that's why we should do
[8:19] this for others amen and then he offers
[8:21] hope for Jews and Gentiles and he
[8:22] explains about his ministry there at the
[8:24] end of chapter 15 so uh just kind of you
[8:27] kind of know where we're going here by
[8:28] God's grace to finish the um uh the the
[8:32] book here Lord willing if the Lord
[8:34] terries Hallelujah and I'm going to be
[8:36] heavy on the Greek today as you can
[8:37] already see I'm going to be heavy on the
[8:39] Greek it really helps me understand uh
[8:41] what Paul is is talking about and of
[8:43] course I'll bring in some quotes from
[8:45] Brother brandom as well uh by God's
[8:47] grace I hope this will be a help to you
[8:49] uh by the grace of God now remember
[8:52] church this this chapter Romans 12 is
[8:55] what was preached at the Asbury Revival
[8:58] last year do you remember that Kentucky
[8:59] remember that college started they
[9:01] started a 16-day Revival where they just
[9:04] would only leave to sleep and and pray
[9:07] I'm sorry to sleep and eat and they
[9:08] would come back 16 days straight and
[9:11] there was uh you can see it on video
[9:13] demon a demon was cast out uh people
[9:16] gave their hearts to God people were
[9:17] baptized one person said people were
[9:19] healed of cancer there um and so it was
[9:23] what we'd call a a denominational uh
[9:26] pouring pouring out of the Holy Spirit
[9:29] Hallelujah uh and and it just proves
[9:32] this church if people draw nigh to God
[9:35] God will draw nigh to them now remember
[9:37] friends this is all happening while the
[9:39] men are wearing shorts the women are
[9:41] wearing shorts and while they're wearing
[9:42] makeup and cutting their
[9:44] hair because Jesus said I'm I send the
[9:47] rain on the just and the
[9:50] unjust
[9:51] Hallelujah but I just want again see you
[9:53] know there's so much power in this
[9:55] chapter it'll cause people to not want
[9:58] to leave church for over two weeks
[10:01] Hallelujah and church many of these
[10:02] outpourings as I've seen too uh and I as
[10:06] I know I knew I know some of the people
[10:08] that had Revival like the Asberry one
[10:10] beforehand in the early
[10:12] 2000s God does that to call people into
[10:16] lifetime
[10:17] service see I know people that were part
[10:19] of another College Revival around the
[10:21] year 2000 when I went to college and
[10:24] they got saved and they had like a
[10:25] similar maybe it wasn't 16 days it might
[10:27] have been like five or six days and
[10:29] numerous preachers were called out of
[10:31] there and uh also missionaries to go be
[10:34] missionaries for denominational
[10:37] systems so you might you you and I might
[10:39] wonder you know why does why does God
[10:41] pour out you know uh revivals like that
[10:43] it's to get people into
[10:45] service like some of those young people
[10:47] they just need to see what does real
[10:49] worship look like what does what does
[10:51] the spirit of God feel like they've
[10:52] never felt it before so God has to pour
[10:56] out these uh blessings and pour out
[10:58] these revivals right right and it puts
[11:01] people into service right and yet we
[11:03] know the world fewer and fewer will be
[11:05] saved Jesus said few and fewer will be
[11:08] saved right until he gets to the spot
[11:10] where uh where no one else can be saved
[11:12] right and then God will cut off the
[11:13] Gentiles he'll turn back to the
[11:16] Jews so see you know in other words what
[11:18] I'm saying is God has a wise virgin God
[11:21] has a foolish virgin God has to have a
[11:23] way to catch both of them amen
[11:25] hallelujah how many glad God caught your
[11:27] attention Hallelujah God gave you
[11:29] Revival called you into service amen
[11:31] hallelujah my Revival is still going on
[11:34] Amen you know a lot of those people
[11:36] that'll only go to church on a Sunday
[11:37] morning they won't go on a Wednesday
[11:39] night they won't pray every day they
[11:40] won't read their Bibles listen to
[11:42] sermons but yet they're they're still
[11:43] trying to serve God thank God for that
[11:45] but see our lives by the message God has
[11:48] sent to us it should produce a life of
[11:49] total consecration Hallelujah that's
[11:52] what Romans 12 1 and two is all about
[11:56] finding the perfect will of God the wise
[11:58] versin life is what I'm talking about A
[12:01] Life That's aversion to Christ in other
[12:03] words no uh there's there's no
[12:05] intercourse with the things of the world
[12:08] right we don't get involved in the
[12:09] politics and and the social trends of
[12:12] the world we our lives are totally
[12:14] devoted to the service of God
[12:16] hallelujah in other words this church
[12:18] and and our body of Christ that's what
[12:20] we're devoted to praise God hallelujah
[12:23] this is what we we'll be we we'll show
[12:25] our full Devotion to Christ for the body
[12:27] of Christ that he's called here in akan
[12:30] Ohio praise God
[12:33] Amen in other words everything else is
[12:35] just a a filler the main thing in our
[12:38] lives is the perfect will of God
[12:40] ministering to the body of Christ here
[12:42] in akan praise God whereas their lives
[12:45] you know the main thing there is maybe
[12:47] social justice or the main thing there
[12:49] uh is equity with what they call Equity
[12:52] not what God calls Equity right or
[12:55] protests or you know uh conferences and
[12:58] things like like that politics and
[13:00] elections that's their main focus but
[13:03] our main focus is serving Christ
[13:05] Hallelujah finding the perfect will of
[13:08] God serving God being ready for Jesus is
[13:10] coming
[13:11] hallelujah amen and church it is worth
[13:14] it a life live that way is totally worth
[13:18] it to the cause of Christ hallelujah
[13:20] amen amen because the Bible says we we
[13:24] we come out from those unfruitful works
[13:26] of darkness we come out from among them
[13:29] and Ephesians remember Ephesians says we
[13:31] are to expose the unfruitful works of
[13:34] darkness
[13:36] Hallelujah because there's very few
[13:38] Jesus said few there be that find the
[13:40] narrow road Hallelujah so even amongst
[13:42] those revivals like we talked about the
[13:44] college revivals thank God for them but
[13:46] even amongst them there's going to be
[13:47] very few saved compared to the whole
[13:49] number of the the number of sinners in
[13:51] the
[13:52] world so Paul you know he he he finishes
[13:55] off this chapter on Israel and how we uh
[13:59] he said oh the the the depths of the
[14:01] knowledge of the love of God you know
[14:03] who who who's been God's counselor his
[14:06] ways are past finding out Hallelujah he
[14:08] Praises God for this idea of of cutting
[14:11] off the Jews and bringing in the
[14:12] Gentiles and then he starts this new
[14:14] chapter now he focuses on all the
[14:16] Christians and he says I beseech you I
[14:19] make a call to you I beg you therefore
[14:21] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[14:24] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[14:26] and that means a victim so see something
[14:28] has to to die Hallelujah each day
[14:30] something has to die and it's your
[14:32] selfish will right it's my selfish will
[14:35] it's your sinful nature it has to die
[14:37] every day
[14:40] Hallelujah present your body as a
[14:43] victim right I killed it I killed the
[14:46] desires this
[14:47] morning right it would been easier to
[14:49] sleep
[14:50] in right it been easier to just scroll
[14:53] on my phone all
[14:55] day been easier uh just to go out to eat
[14:58] and skip church but know I make my body
[15:01] a victim Hallelujah I make my body a
[15:04] sacrifice that Christ might be glorified
[15:06] in me
[15:07] hallelujah
[15:09] hallelujah holy that means separated
[15:12] acceptable unto God so see there's
[15:14] people that live their lives and it's
[15:16] unacceptable God does not accept their
[15:18] sacrifice like Cain Hallelujah like like
[15:21] Saul King Saul they give a partial
[15:23] sacrifice they compromise parts of their
[15:25] lives God doesn't accept that Hallelujah
[15:29] and the Bible said they can still be
[15:31] saved but they'll have no reward but we
[15:33] want a reward because we've known enough
[15:35] We Know Better Hallelujah and we want a
[15:38] full reward we want to see a fruitful
[15:40] harvest in our lives
[15:42] amen we want a life that we we live and
[15:46] it's a life of sacrifice and we're holy
[15:48] separated to God God accepts us and this
[15:51] is our reasonable this is our logical
[15:53] service or our logical Ministry this is
[15:57] logical Jesus forgave all my sins so the
[16:00] very least I can do is serve him
[16:02] Hallelujah Jesus gave everything for me
[16:04] on the cross the least I can do is give
[16:06] him my entire life
[16:08] Hallelujah this this this makes sense
[16:10] this is logical praise
[16:12] God and friends this is the solution to
[16:16] the temptation of being prideful right
[16:18] well God's God's not with the Jews so
[16:21] much right now he's with us and of
[16:22] course God watches over everybody right
[16:24] but I'm saying he's not he's not pouring
[16:25] out his spear in a great way among the
[16:27] Jews
[16:29] so this is the solution here's how we
[16:32] here's how we show our appreciation for
[16:33] God's grace and we overcome the sin of
[16:36] Pride we present our bodies as a Living
[16:40] Sacrifice and we find a Ministry that we
[16:43] can serve God in because the Bible said
[16:45] boast not against the
[16:47] branches right we shouldn't Pat
[16:49] ourselves in the back well thank God
[16:50] we're so holy that's why we're not
[16:51] getting bombed by by Iran remember
[16:54] there's a bomb
[16:55] coming there's bombs coming to the US
[16:59] right it's thus sayith the Lord right
[17:01] it's thus say the scripture right all
[17:03] the nations will fall and Jesus will set
[17:05] up one new nation Hallelujah where he'll
[17:08] be the righteous leader of the nation
[17:10] Hallelujah All Nations will flow into
[17:12] Jerusalem one day every nation will fall
[17:15] except Christ's holy priesthood
[17:17] Hallelujah the holy nation amen the
[17:20] spiritual Nation The Peculiar people
[17:23] hallelujah so do not boast against the
[17:25] branches or be highminded or proudful
[17:28] but the Bible said fear that means honor
[17:31] greatly honor with great respect and
[17:34] reverence see we Must Die daily as the
[17:37] scripture says hallelujah so here's the
[17:40] solution let's not be prideful let's
[17:42] continue to make our bodies a Living
[17:44] Sacrifice
[17:45] Hallelujah you I've heard uh some
[17:47] message churches they don't even believe
[17:49] in fasting they don't even believe in
[17:51] prayer well that what they're doing is
[17:53] they're denying this scripture this
[17:55] scripture says your bodies have to be
[17:57] victims amen they have to lose
[18:00] something they have to feel the effects
[18:03] of death right they have to feel that
[18:05] hunger or the pain it must be done
[18:07] hallelujah in order to serve
[18:10] God right and you can see it like as we
[18:12] talked about the lust of the flesh
[18:14] people get so uh fed in these buffets or
[18:17] it don't have to be a buffet but they
[18:18] just get so so used to filling
[18:21] themselves up they get bigger and bigger
[18:22] and bigger these things should not be
[18:26] so it's an effect of the days of Noah
[18:28] Jesus says As it was the days of Noah
[18:30] they were eating and drinking the sin of
[18:32] gluttony so shall be in the days of the
[18:34] coming of the son of man and brother Ram
[18:37] said we'll pay $8 for a plate of food
[18:39] and slide half of it off into the trash
[18:41] while children are starving other
[18:43] countries brother Ram said God is going
[18:45] to make this nation pay Hallelujah but
[18:48] not the bride not God's people they've
[18:50] already passed from Death unto life amen
[18:53] there's no condemnation to them that are
[18:54] in Christ
[18:56] Jesus that's why we don't waste so much
[18:58] right we shouldn't waste anything
[19:00] Hallelujah we should be good stewards of
[19:02] what God has given us praise
[19:04] God now verse two and be not conformed I
[19:07] spent a lot of time on this scripture
[19:09] over the last few years but I just want
[19:11] to read these things again here so you
[19:13] give us a better understanding be not
[19:15] conformed or that means shaped like
[19:17] another's pattern in other words your
[19:19] life shouldn't look like your coworker's
[19:21] life or your uh your classmates life
[19:24] right girls in school your life
[19:26] shouldn't look like their life you you
[19:27] shouldn't pattern yourself after them
[19:30] you should pattern your life after
[19:32] Christ Hallelujah your life should be
[19:34] totally different they can work on
[19:36] Sunday you're not gonna Hallelujah they
[19:40] can watch they can play those video
[19:41] games you're not gonna amen right you're
[19:45] you don't you don't look like them your
[19:47] life is looking more like a Christian's
[19:49] life all the time is that right Paul
[19:53] said this is how you do it first you got
[19:54] to be a victim you got to you got to die
[19:57] to your own desire and shape your life
[20:01] like a Christian's life and the way to
[20:03] do this is get new
[20:05] thinking a new mind a a new thought
[20:08] process that's the way to do this that's
[20:11] why brother R called it the greatest
[20:13] battle ever fought praise God because if
[20:16] we can get our mind
[20:18] transformed then this is possible then
[20:21] we can have a life because we're
[20:22] thinking about God's thoughts we have
[20:24] the mind of Christ as we think about
[20:26] God's thoughts our life will be shaped
[20:28] into the pattern of Christ life
[20:33] amen think about that he only lived 33
[20:36] years and yet had the greatest impact of
[20:39] anyone on the entire history of the
[20:42] world because he had the mind of God
[20:45] hallelujah he said I only do that which
[20:48] the father shows me amen all my Doctrine
[20:50] isn't mine I've taught what I've heard
[20:52] from the father Hallelujah that which I
[20:54] see that's what I do praise God Amen
[21:00] so he says be not conformed to this
[21:01] world don't be shaped like the world's
[21:03] pattern but be transformed and this word
[21:07] is from here it's this transfigured it's
[21:09] the same word in other words Paul could
[21:11] have said be ye transfigured by the
[21:13] renewing of your mind now Paul's not
[21:15] saying you have to have light shining
[21:16] out from you like Jesus but that's what
[21:19] the word means it's a spiritual
[21:21] shining right when they went on Mount
[21:23] Transfiguration Simon preach it here I
[21:25] wasn't here but Simon said they went up
[21:27] looking like normal men but when they
[21:29] got up there Jesus
[21:31] transformed all of a sudden it's
[21:33] bright right it's kind of like if you're
[21:36] you know in the dark and all of a sudden
[21:37] you ever like that if you're married and
[21:39] or you know sometimes I've been in bed
[21:41] or something and my wife walk in she got
[21:42] the flashlight on right and I'm used to
[21:43] the dark and all a sudden the flashlight
[21:45] you
[21:46] know it's a transformation right it's a
[21:50] transfiguring and it's it's the law of
[21:52] contrast in other words when you're
[21:54] walking the perfect will of God your
[21:56] mind is totally turned on the light is
[21:59] shining now I see what God wants me to
[22:01] do praise God it's completely different
[22:03] than what I was
[22:05] doing like like Jonah Jonah is the great
[22:07] Jonah's a simple example the permissive
[22:09] will of God he's in the belly of a whale
[22:11] he's in whale vomit he's got seaweed
[22:14] wrapped all around him and he he he
[22:16] struggles to find a place to pray it's
[22:18] dark it's wet it smells the opposite of
[22:21] that when he's transforms he's brought
[22:23] out he sees the sunlight he gets cleaned
[22:25] off amen he gets regular food he lives a
[22:28] reg life that's the transformation it's
[22:31] from life to death from day to night
[22:33] Hallelujah from worldliness to Holy
[22:35] Ghost Christian Living
[22:38] Hallelujah that's the difference I'm
[22:40] talking about in your
[22:43] mind and that's why you know I've even
[22:45] experienced that this week I went from
[22:47] being depressed and having no hope
[22:49] especially with this financial situation
[22:51] to now I'm happy again by God's grace
[22:53] now God can make all things new praise
[22:56] Goden I'm not the only one I've met
[22:58] three or four people that had the
[22:59] identity theft this week and they said
[23:00] well it's going to be all right you know
[23:01] might be a few months hopefully you get
[23:03] it all back by God's grace but you just
[23:06] you know the uncertainty you know these
[23:08] these evil thoughts can Cloud your mind
[23:11] right I must have spent over 12 hours
[23:14] maybe on the phone and on the computer
[23:15] this week it just crazy trying to get
[23:17] everything back uh and Cam's like be
[23:20] like David and God God will make you
[23:22] like David you'll bring everything back
[23:23] from Zig lag you know you you'll restore
[23:25] everything I said well Amen brother I'm
[23:27] going to I'm going to hope in that
[23:29] maybe that is God's word for me I hope
[23:32] so but this is how we shape if we want
[23:35] our lives shaped like a Christian we got
[23:37] to have Minds that are shining right we
[23:39] got to have Minds that are transfigured
[23:42] Minds that have hope
[23:44] Hallelujah Minds that have the word of
[23:46] God just shining brightly into them
[23:48] praise
[23:49] God it's kind of like you know that uh
[23:52] Eclipse we saw on Monday right it was so
[23:56] bright how many how many how many
[23:58] remember you you know you can look at it
[23:59] but when you take off your glasses it
[24:00] was so bright that's that's what it's
[24:02] like
[24:03] Hallelujah right your mind your mind can
[24:05] be so dark but when when when when when
[24:07] your mind gets the thoughts of God
[24:09] everything changes there's power amen
[24:13] power in the word of God you get you get
[24:15] motivation you get inspiration it shines
[24:18] Hallelujah there's there's power in the
[24:20] light of God there's power in the word
[24:23] of God gives you a brand new outlook
[24:26] hallelujah amen this is the only way to
[24:29] serve God this is the only way
[24:31] Hallelujah to be a Living Sacrifice
[24:33] praise God you all know it you know when
[24:36] we're we're struggling with mind battles
[24:38] I know it this week when we're
[24:39] struggling with mind battles uh we don't
[24:41] do much service for God we just worry
[24:44] complain and fret and get frustrated
[24:47] nothing's being done for God that's why
[24:50] we need a transformation Hallelujah when
[24:53] our minds get transformed something gets
[24:55] done for God's Glory Hallelujah and not
[24:59] Glory Hallelujah he said be
[25:02] transformed by the renewing or the
[25:05] renovation of your mind and I think this
[25:09] this brings to light that scripture uh
[25:11] the entrance of God's word is light from
[25:14] the book of Psalms there's a scripture
[25:15] that says the entrance of God's word
[25:17] brings light so when God's word enters
[25:21] your thoughts it renovates the whole
[25:23] place Hallelujah I remember when we
[25:26] renovated this place I got pictures of
[25:28] of it when Mali and Casa were painting
[25:30] and the walls were dirty filthy in here
[25:33] the the carpet was nasty oh boy it was
[25:35] nasty dirty but we come in here and we
[25:38] renovated It Out by God's grace it's a
[25:41] total transformation now it's numerous
[25:43] years old now it's almost 10 years old
[25:45] now I'm very thankful for this place
[25:47] Hallelujah is that right trustees we got
[25:50] our contract coming up at the end of
[25:51] this year wherever God leads us we we
[25:54] want to go wherever God leads us but
[25:56] that that's a great uh aspect of
[25:57] renovation
[25:59] that's a great application when God's
[26:01] word comes into your mind it cleans out
[26:03] your mind it renovates it makes it brand
[26:05] new again Allelujah changes your
[26:08] thinking for the
[26:09] good that you may prove and this means
[26:12] to test or examine or scrutinized like
[26:15] Metals what is good and acceptable
[26:18] what's the perfect will of
[26:20] God so when you Church you have to we
[26:23] have to remember this the only time when
[26:25] we really know we're doing the perfect
[26:26] will of God is when we obey the word of
[26:29] God and we have a transformed mind if
[26:32] we're wondering whether we're in the
[26:33] perfect will of God or permissive will
[26:34] of God it's time to repent it's time to
[26:37] obey every word that we know and then
[26:39] when we do that then we can prove I know
[26:41] what God called me to
[26:43] do and see Church you're going to need
[26:45] you're going to need signs from God to
[26:47] know that you're doing what God wants
[26:49] you to
[26:50] do right with with many people in the
[26:52] Bible they had to ask God remember
[26:54] Gideon had to ask God for
[26:56] signs right David had to go David had to
[27:00] know God's word about his future before
[27:03] he could act on it he had to know I'm
[27:05] going to be king and all the he had to
[27:06] know God had to tell him right so God
[27:09] will tell us what God wants us to do
[27:11] praise
[27:12] God
[27:15] hallelujah and so just examples in my
[27:18] life many times I've asked God to give
[27:19] me uh signs am I called to preach and
[27:22] God always has done that you know to
[27:25] confirm different things in my life
[27:27] God's always done that the recent one I
[27:29] told you about was when uh my children
[27:31] were younger and we had another family
[27:32] in the church and they stopped coming to
[27:34] all the services and I laid right here
[27:37] before God and I beg God he said God as
[27:39] a give me a sign that by attending more
[27:43] services that's your perfect will give
[27:45] me a Sign by filling my children with
[27:47] the Holy Ghost before those children get
[27:49] the Holy
[27:50] Ghost and God Vindicated it God gave me
[27:54] the sign amen hallelujah amen hallelujah
[27:58] see now I can prove I've done the
[28:00] perfect will of God
[28:02] hallelujah and over the years I've we
[28:04] seen many other signs that we we made
[28:06] the right
[28:08] choice Hallelujah remember brother R
[28:10] tells us in the church age book I don't
[28:11] know Mercy if you know this brother bam
[28:13] said the secret to Christianity is
[28:14] increasing your service to God brother
[28:17] tells us that in the th tan Church age
[28:19] Jesus knew their Works their love their
[28:21] faith and I know your works and the last
[28:23] are more than the first hallelujah amen
[28:26] hallelujah
[28:29] we've got to increase our service for
[28:31] God we've got to be a a servant for God
[28:35] we have to know the ministry God wants
[28:37] us to do
[28:38] amen now as you can kind of see where
[28:41] I'm going now uh if you know this
[28:45] chapter so once your mind is transformed
[28:48] and and and you're thinking God's
[28:49] thoughts then you can test and prove am
[28:51] I in the perfect will of God or am I out
[28:53] of the perfect will of God and you can
[28:55] prove it by what God has done by
[28:58] answering your prayers or giving you
[29:00] vindications or words from the
[29:04] Lord like
[29:06] uh you know Simon Simon you know I don't
[29:08] think he'd mind me telling this I'll
[29:10] I'll send him a message after this if I
[29:11] remember but Simon you know for years
[29:13] just wondered was he called to preach
[29:15] right and I would always tell him
[29:16] brother you're called to preach brother
[29:17] you got a gift I mean he shared things
[29:19] with me since
[29:21] 2001 here's 20 23 years later for all
[29:24] these years he told me all these
[29:26] Revelations and my didn't see that I
[29:28] said brother you're called to preach
[29:30] well I can't call myself a preacher I'm
[29:32] just I just do Bible studies I said
[29:35] you're a teacher brother and that's how
[29:37] it is sometimes we can't see our own
[29:39] gifts but other people thank God other
[29:41] people can see them sometimes
[29:44] Hallelujah one time he was thinking
[29:46] about getting out of the ministry I came
[29:47] in there and preached uh that that
[29:49] sermon about diligence remember my
[29:51] diligence sermons there and Simon said
[29:53] that that was exactly the word of wisdom
[29:55] he needed to
[29:56] hear and remember last year remember he
[29:58] preached those nine things that discern
[30:00] things I had questions about things I
[30:02] study things in my life and I went out
[30:04] there and I sat in the rain maybe we
[30:05] stood there for 5 minutes Mal I don't
[30:06] know how long it was I stood there soak
[30:08] and wet for 10 minutes just to tell them
[30:10] brother you don't let anybody tell you
[30:12] you're not called to preach and then he
[30:14] got ordained when we were there the last
[30:16] time finally by God's grace and the
[30:19] brothers were saying why don't you smile
[30:20] we're taking pictures you know at the
[30:21] ordaining he's like why don't you smile
[30:22] he said it's a serious thing and I said
[30:25] yeah brother but you know once you're a
[30:26] preacher you can smile you you know so I
[30:29] I share with him the picture when I got
[30:30] ordained I wasn't smiling either I was
[30:32] like oh God help me my wife smiling you
[30:33] know brother Brooks is smiling he's like
[30:35] here's you I'm like God help me help me
[30:37] to be a faithful
[30:38] witness right but now I can smile
[30:41] because God has given me signs amen I
[30:43] can prove the perfect will of God
[30:47] hallelujah so when God's word enters our
[30:50] thoughts and our mind and our lives we
[30:52] can see a total difference it's a night
[30:53] and day difference Amen brother amen can
[30:56] see in his life his denomination life
[30:58] and now this life Hallelujah I can see
[31:00] the same in mine our sisters each one of
[31:02] us can oh it's for like night and day
[31:05] Hallelujah I wish sometimes we could
[31:07] pull up the sermon they preach at the
[31:09] CMA church or my former Assembly of God
[31:12] Church and compare it to how I'm
[31:13] preaching today or brother Brooks you
[31:15] know or brother cam what would the
[31:17] difference be it's night and day
[31:21] Hallelujah verse three for I say through
[31:23] the grace or the favor given unto me to
[31:26] every man that's among you not to think
[31:28] himself more highly than he ought to
[31:30] think but to think soberly so apparently
[31:32] in the church people thought really
[31:34] highly of themselves boy I'm somebody
[31:37] special I'm look who I'm I'm brother so
[31:39] and so I'm sister so and so I'm somebody
[31:41] great so Paul had to tell them don't
[31:43] think you're so great and handsome right
[31:46] Brothers right oh I'm so handsome look
[31:48] at me let me take a selfie of my big
[31:52] muscles or my big Faith look at my big
[31:55] Faith you know apparently these people
[31:59] you know they were they were really
[32:01] wonderful people but apparently they had
[32:02] trouble with
[32:04] pride so he said you know God's given
[32:07] you Grace but don't think too highly of
[32:09] yourselves now that's what I feel like
[32:10] happened in the message these preachers
[32:12] think so highly of themselves they call
[32:14] themselves the greatest of all time
[32:15] that's a sin but here wouldn't this help
[32:18] everybody Hallelujah wouldn't reading
[32:20] the Bible preaching the Bible help out
[32:22] everybody in the message you
[32:25] understand don't think more highly than
[32:27] you ought to think but to think soberly
[32:29] now that means a a moderate estimate of
[32:33] oneself now the example I give is Jesus
[32:36] said everybody's got either one Talent
[32:38] two talents or five
[32:40] talents so you know you know the most
[32:42] practical way brother Austin I can apply
[32:43] this to my life is say I'm a one Talent
[32:46] preacher I can't go wrong with that is
[32:49] that right so in humility brother amen
[32:52] would say I'm a one Talent song leader
[32:54] and that's a gift of healing now that's
[32:55] a holy ghost gift I've been healed many
[32:58] times through brother amen songs Mali is
[32:59] playing oh I just get the presence of
[33:01] God I feel so good I confess whatever I
[33:04] worship God it's a blessing Hallelujah
[33:06] that's what music is music
[33:11] heals so let's apply that practically
[33:15] you know whatever you have to recognize
[33:17] you want to find your gift but make it
[33:19] on a smaller level so then if it's
[33:21] greater then you you didn't go around
[33:22] bragging about
[33:24] it Hallelujah
[33:28] so don't think so highly as you ought to
[33:29] that's just one simple application I've
[33:31] always tried to apply to my life I know
[33:33] I got at least one talent to preach at
[33:35] least one brother Mercy I got at least
[33:37] one brother Jose Hallelujah I got a
[33:39] little bit by God's grace or to pray for
[33:42] the sick or for healing hallelujah or
[33:45] teaching or wisdom or whatever it may be
[33:48] knowledge he said but think soberly put
[33:50] a put a moderate estimate how much
[33:53] talent do you have a little bit of
[33:55] talent according as God had dealt which
[33:59] means to separate or cut in pieces God
[34:01] took a he did on the day of Pentecost
[34:04] amen God had his spirit and he gave
[34:05] everybody a little lick of fire amen
[34:07] everybody got a piece amen the the
[34:09] awesome part is as soon as he cut it and
[34:11] divided it he still had that same
[34:13] amount because he's infinite praise God
[34:16] if we cut a if we cut a pizza in pieces
[34:19] we're going to run out if God Cuts
[34:20] himself in pieces he ain't going to run
[34:22] out hallelujah amen hallelujah he's
[34:25] infinite
[34:26] Hallelujah am
[34:28] amen so God separates God cuts out aart
[34:32] a gift of faith for each one of
[34:34] us and he gives you that gift think of
[34:37] that children you got a part of God's
[34:41] spirit and it's a part of
[34:44] God and he gives every man the measure
[34:47] or the portion of
[34:50] Faith so you might have five talents of
[34:53] Faith you might have two talents of
[34:54] Faith now imagine there's a four and a
[34:56] three in there too I don't know why the
[34:58] parable just says 521 imagine there's
[35:00] all levels in there
[35:04] right and so God gives you uh uh some
[35:07] amount but he said don't don't get
[35:09] prideful about
[35:10] it okay now I've always put these verses
[35:13] together in my mind you know I've
[35:16] misquoted these scriptures I've always
[35:17] put these together for some reason I
[35:19] don't know why if it was a song or my my
[35:21] past but Jesus said ask and you shall
[35:24] receive that uh that your joy may be
[35:27] full
[35:28] so there's some prayers uh Jesus wants
[35:31] us to ask so we'll be
[35:33] joyful
[35:35] Hallelujah God want there's times God
[35:37] wants us to be so joyful we might dance
[35:39] around the church or we might jump and
[35:41] praise the Lord hallelujah
[35:43] amen he said ask that you shall receive
[35:46] that your joy may be full so sometimes
[35:49] God wants us to pray and say God fulfill
[35:51] this and then God wants to see us
[35:53] rejoice about it amen hallelujah praise
[35:56] God Amen you don't want to see us come
[35:58] to church all stiff and starchy like I'm
[36:00] not giving God any praise come on
[36:02] preacher make me happy I can't make you
[36:04] happy Jesus's Joy makes you happy amen
[36:08] hallelujah but God's word ought to make
[36:10] ought to make us happy
[36:12] hallelujah hallelujah I get all that
[36:14] money back I'm gonna have another dance
[36:15] for god you watch hopefully we'll see
[36:18] you by Wednesday night Hallelujah either
[36:20] way I owe God a dance because at least I
[36:22] got a fourth of it back Hallelujah
[36:25] because it was stolen from me and I
[36:26] can't do anything about it I'm at the
[36:28] mercy of these other
[36:30] people but I've asked God that my joy
[36:32] might be full Hallelujah Ephesians 3:20
[36:36] now to him that's able to exceedingly
[36:38] abundantly above all we ask or think
[36:41] Hallelujah so see we're we're supposed
[36:43] to make our request and then God may do
[36:46] more than what we even
[36:48] ask
[36:50] Hallelujah but with our own individual
[36:52] gifts we're just humble with
[36:55] them oh brother you had this good
[36:57] testimony sister you have this good
[36:58] testimony always humble yourself in
[37:00] those moments well it was just God's
[37:03] grace
[37:05] right don't give any glory to ourselves
[37:08] give all the glory to
[37:10] Christ now this reminded me of the
[37:12] parable the talents remember Jesus tells
[37:15] a story he's like a man who's leaving
[37:17] and he gives uh three people different
[37:19] amounts of money a talent is money and I
[37:22] worked it out it's it's either like you
[37:24] know $5 million or $1 million the
[37:26] highest amount you know I work worked it
[37:27] out I put in the book there by God's
[37:29] grace now what God wants you to do is to
[37:32] trade with your
[37:33] gifts which means to labor or do work or
[37:36] exercise now what that means of course
[37:39] we don't work for we don't work for God
[37:41] as far as like we earn it but what that
[37:43] means is God wants us to Die daily God
[37:46] wants us to spend some time laboring in
[37:50] prayer right he wants us to spend some
[37:53] time dying to ourselves the Bible said
[37:56] exercising your faith
[37:59] Hallelujah Godly exercise prophets
[38:01] Hallelujah other words God wants you to
[38:04] God wants you to reach out in the Holy
[38:05] Spirit remember the the three steps for
[38:07] being on fire brother R tells us three
[38:08] steps of being on fire reaching out in
[38:10] the spirit a fervent desire to please
[38:12] him and a passion to know his word amen
[38:15] that's how you know you're on fire amen
[38:17] amen you got those three steps
[38:21] Hallelujah and so with with when we see
[38:24] God move in our lives if God has a
[38:26] testimony or something that we got to
[38:28] say Lord do more of that in my life God
[38:31] here I'm I'm fasting I'm praying I'm
[38:33] setting myself aside for a service amen
[38:37] and so God use me if you want to use me
[38:39] you can use me praise God you got to
[38:42] trade you got to invest in
[38:44] it right now the sin of this Parable was
[38:48] hiding or concealing God's money that he
[38:51] gives to the people hide it or conceal
[38:54] it where it doesn't gain anything
[38:57] right just hiding it away from the world
[39:00] see church that's why when you come to
[39:01] church you want God to use you you want
[39:03] you want God to speak to you at church
[39:05] right so there there's testimonies about
[39:07] your life
[39:08] Hallelujah I want testimonies about my
[39:11] life each one of us want testimonies
[39:13] about our lives that proves we're not
[39:15] hiding God's talent that He gave us but
[39:18] we're exercising it hallelujah we're
[39:21] we're trying to invest it oh God use me
[39:23] today let me be led by the Holy Spirit
[39:26] praise God Amen
[39:28] lead me and I'm going to show you a real
[39:29] common example youve probably heard
[39:31] before but I'm going to show you an
[39:31] example here in a little bit and then
[39:34] Jesus rebukes him and said you should
[39:35] not have hid it you should have gave it
[39:38] to the exchangers you should have took
[39:40] it to the
[39:41] bankers and at least got a little bit of
[39:44] benefit
[39:46] Hallelujah right and church I I I'll
[39:48] just be honest I always see little gains
[39:51] in all your character amen even the
[39:53] little children right like with Haven
[39:55] and Caris even encouraged me this week
[39:56] both of them were encouraging me I'm a
[39:58] grown man I'm a preacher right I preach
[40:02] I know God's word some of it you know by
[40:04] God's grace a little bit being
[40:06] humble I know very little by God's grace
[40:09] but I I preach what I know but I can
[40:12] even see how God's using them to get my
[40:14] mind like like last night Haven said
[40:16] Daddy it's just like pressure you've had
[40:18] all this pressure this week it's just
[40:19] like the Potter and the clay you
[40:20] preached on a few weeks ago I'm like yes
[40:23] I want to bang my head on this Pulpit
[40:24] yes that's right don't forget silly you
[40:27] know you just preach on that pressures
[40:30] on your life but it's going to form you
[40:33] and to make you into the vessel God
[40:34] wants you to be praise God Amen all this
[40:38] pressure in our
[40:39] lives see God moved her mind to that and
[40:43] I can see that's that's keeping now
[40:45] that's impacting me praise God
[40:49] hallelujah or leaving you know a little
[40:51] uh Caris had a nice little rhyme on
[40:53] there I can't remember it now but don't
[40:54] worry about the money and all these
[40:56] things like that just trusting God all
[40:58] just nice pictures like that she even
[41:00] offered to give us some
[41:01] money bless her heart that that's sweet
[41:05] as you could be you know by God's
[41:07] grace but you know this is what I'm
[41:09] saying you know with all of our Lives we
[41:11] should see little testimonies all around
[41:13] us praise God there should always be
[41:15] some some little things going on in our
[41:18] lives oh that was a little blessing when
[41:19] our brother did that or our sister oh
[41:21] that really helped me when the sister
[41:22] sang that or did that and we see little
[41:24] blessings in our lives Hallelujah that
[41:26] means it's our talents are being
[41:28] invested
[41:31] hallelujah
[41:35] amen remember Church you have one of
[41:37] these or more and then brother BR tells
[41:40] us at any time God can use you for one

[42:06] of knowledge it opens up a door oh okay

[42:11] understand it right that was like with
[42:13] the Philip and the unic the unix's like

[42:42] body a victim amen I'm killing my
[42:44] desires I'm doing what God wants me to
[42:46] do today hallelujah amen or maybe some
[42:49] of you got faith that's a revelation of
[42:50] God's will which is a trust and belief
[42:53] that God is going to do
[42:55] something amen the Roman centor had
[42:58] great faith just speak the word I know
[43:00] it'll be
[43:02] done Miracles spontaneous powerful
[43:04] healings Supernatural things
[43:07] unexplainable God does a miracle
[43:10] Hallelujah prophecy foretells or
[43:12] predicts the future many times with us
[43:14] it's
[43:15] dreams Hallelujah I had a dream this
[43:18] week I don't know if I remember this or
[43:19] not but I had a dream I was preaching at
[43:20] a church in
[43:21] Lima and it was really uh there was
[43:24] hardly anybody there the pastor wasn't
[43:26] there I know who the pastor is
[43:27] I met him
[43:29] before uh and it was just a strange it
[43:31] was like it was like all the things
[43:32] leading up to the service there's it was
[43:34] even a different building you know and I
[43:37] was going up there to preach and I
[43:38] didn't quite know what I was going to
[43:38] preach and that's when the dream ended
[43:40] so I don't know if there's any
[43:40] significance to that or not but I've had
[43:43] dreams that come to pass let me tell you
[43:44] this one you probably remember this one
[43:47] I told it before but just so everybody
[43:49] remembers I had a dream about a brother
[43:51] in the message he just got married to
[43:52] his wife and in the dream they're
[43:54] they're they're on a a tennis court and
[43:57] there's a fence and he's playing tennis
[44:00] but he's in a girl's outfit the the
[44:04] short skirts and it's pink and he's got
[44:06] the tank top on a
[44:08] man I'm like this is strange this guy's
[44:11] a message believer we've done Bible
[44:12] studies he's
[44:13] baptized and then his wife is there
[44:15] sitting at the fence looking in like I
[44:17] wish I could play I wish I could join
[44:19] in I went and told the brother this was
[44:22] years ago this was probably 200 uh
[44:24] before we started the church so 2004
[44:26] 2005
[44:28] and the brother's like well I don't play
[44:30] tennis brother so this this doesn't
[44:32] apply to
[44:34] me but later he he confessed it later he
[44:37] confessed he during that time when I
[44:39] told him the dream he wasn't studying
[44:41] the Bible he was playing solitary on his
[44:43] phone so
[44:44] games tennis is a game game fast forward
[44:48] 10 years he leaves the
[44:51] message we're I'm on Facebook brother
[44:53] Jose him and his wife put a picture on
[44:56] Facebook he's got his shirt off playing
[44:58] tennis and she's got these sexy clothes
[45:00] on playing
[45:02] tennis they were
[45:04] warned
[45:06] Hallelujah and I told the brother I said
[45:09] I said here's now this was in 2004 10
[45:11] years before it happened I said brother
[45:13] you're playing around with games and if
[45:15] you don't stop it you're going to draw
[45:16] your wife into
[45:19] this and it wasn't taken heed now see
[45:22] church I'm not a prophet but brother man
[45:25] says if there's no prophets on the Earth
[45:27] God will send you a
[45:29] dream hallelujah amen so be careful
[45:33] Hallelujah take heed to dreams amen if
[45:36] if they're
[45:36] spiritual
[45:39] right and then Discerning which is
[45:41] judging Spirits okay this is from God
[45:43] this is from the devil that's
[45:46] discernment right that's what Peter had
[45:48] when he discerned ananas and Safa why
[45:51] have you agreed together to lie to the
[45:53] Holy Ghost nobody told nobody told Peter
[45:56] but God told Peter
[45:57] here God gave him the ability to to
[46:00] judge that their statement that's not a
[46:01] true
[46:02] statement right that's from the wrong
[46:05] spirit and then tongues of course is uh
[46:07] languages of men or languages of
[46:10] angels and interpretation is uh making
[46:13] known the meaning of those remember
[46:15] these are the Lesser
[46:16] gifts now these are the ones we want to
[46:19] see right right as a natural person
[46:21] right but really God values these more
[46:23] Hallelujah didn't the Bible say with all
[46:26] your G getting get tongues is that what
[46:28] the Bible says with all you're getting
[46:31] get wisdom hallelujah amen that's what
[46:34] Solomon said now there's nothing wrong
[46:37] with these gifts thank God for them but
[46:39] they're so impersonated
[46:41] today where nobody knows what they're
[46:44] saying and if it's a real gift of God
[46:46] and there's no interpreter the Bible
[46:48] said be quiet in the church Hallelujah
[46:51] now we haven't had one since
[46:52] 2016 so it's been eight years since we
[46:55] had a tongue but if God wants to send
[46:57] one we'll take one Hallelujah but we
[46:59] will not seek the gifts instead of The
[47:01] Giver we must seek Jesus Christ
[47:04] amen I tell you which one is going to
[47:06] help you more speaking an unknown tongue
[47:08] where it just edifies you with no
[47:10] interpretation or giving somebody a Word
[47:12] of Wisdom the exact thing they need to
[47:14] do at the right moment like with brother
[47:16] Simon said that he was thinking about
[47:19] quitting preaching but the word of
[47:20] wisdom came invest in your gift and God
[47:22] will bless you
[47:24] hallelujah amen
[47:29] now most of you know this you've heard
[47:32] of this but I wonder how many have
[47:33] listened to it read it so I'm going to
[47:34] read it now brother ra says the only
[47:36] thing a minister can do would be to
[47:37] point you to the one who did save you or
[47:40] heal the Healer points you to the one
[47:42] that's already healed you and the church
[47:45] said you know not not no preacher can
[47:47] heal no brother or sister can heal all
[47:50] we can do is try to get you to look to
[47:51] the
[47:53] Healer now in doing so God set in the
[47:56] church first apostles teachers prophets
[47:59] all kinds of gifts for the perfecting of
[48:00] the body you believe that don't you now
[48:02] that's what I believe that God has set
[48:03] in this church some that can preach like
[48:06] some of the ministers here others are
[48:07] great teachers and Scholars in the word
[48:09] some are seers and sees
[48:13] Visions some of those who speak with
[48:15] tongues some of those who interpret some
[48:18] of those who have great faith in healing
[48:20] that's called Gifts of healing or gift
[48:22] of healing there's no such thing as the
[48:24] gift of healing because it's in the
[48:26] plural its gifts that's why music is one
[48:29] way to
[48:30] heal right brother R said Bulldog Faith
[48:33] like or Roberts you just speak to those
[48:35] devils and command them to move but as
[48:38] brother Bram he never yelled at the
[48:39] demons he just said Satan I rebuke you
[48:42] just so
[48:43] humble right but you have to move you
[48:45] have to operate in the gift that God has
[48:47] given
[48:48] you in other words where have you seen
[48:50] God used you before you want to try to
[48:52] keep going like that hallelujah amen
[48:56] praise God
[48:59] God works in many different ways to heal
[49:01] the sick sometimes preaching the word
[49:03] sometimes a neighbor sitting by you and
[49:05] just lay his hand over on you feel like
[49:07] he should do
[49:09] so think about that just person can just
[49:11] lay their hand and pray for you and
[49:12] you'll be made
[49:14] well always do that brother says always
[49:17] do that when you feel led to pray for
[49:18] somebody that's why church I invite you
[49:21] to sometimes I'll invite you to come up
[49:22] let's pray for this person but really
[49:25] you don't have to have my invitation let
[49:26] me just announce it here officially you
[49:28] won't hurt brother Jesse's
[49:30] feelings I won't stop church and say
[49:32] you're out of order when have I ever
[49:34] done
[49:35] that if you're led by the Holy Spirit
[49:38] follow God's leading it's way better
[49:40] than anything else amen follow God's
[49:43] leading
[49:47] sorry always do that whatever a born
[49:49] again child of God feels to pray for the
[49:52] sick that's the Holy Spirit moving in
[49:54] you to do so
[49:57] no matter who's going to pray for the
[49:58] person you go ahead and pray for them
[50:03] anyhow see if you feel a burden on your
[50:05] heart to do something and you know it's
[50:06] not selfish you know it's of God then
[50:08] follow that
[50:12] leading we just had something that
[50:14] happened in Louisiana now this is the
[50:16] part you'll be remembering
[50:18] right he said there was a lady got a
[50:20] prayer card she had a little baby she
[50:22] was rocking the little baby and another
[50:24] poor little mother sitting there she
[50:25] felt so sorry for the little mother with
[50:27] the baby on her arm she said well I some
[50:29] just told her go pray for that baby how
[50:32] many know this story most people okay oh
[50:35] she said I couldn't do that brother
[50:37] Brandon will pray for that baby oh the
[50:40] preacher got to do this this can't be
[50:42] God the preachers got got more power in
[50:44] prayer than I do well he might have more
[50:47] gifts but God may not want to use that
[50:49] gift at this time God might want to use
[50:51] your gift Church
[50:58] so each one of us can we identify with
[51:00] being a poor little mother can each one
[51:01] of us just be just realize how
[51:03] insignificant and how humble we are
[51:06] remember don't esteem yourself too
[51:08] highly Hallelujah don't make yourself
[51:11] too great or I got all these gifts or I
[51:13] got all this power and authority with
[51:14] God make yourself a poor little mother
[51:17] or poor little
[51:19] brother Hallelujah they got a prayer
[51:23] card but it just kept going now notice
[51:26] this if if God's leading you to do
[51:27] something and you don't obey the first
[51:29] time he's going to give you another
[51:32] nudge
[51:35] okay pushing so something was push
[51:37] pushing her go pray for the little baby
[51:40] so wasn't just one time wasn't twice and
[51:43] after a while a little lady come around
[51:44] again she's seen that baby the holy
[51:46] spirit said go a third time go pray for
[51:47] that
[51:48] baby see church if God wants you to do
[51:50] something he's going to help you do it
[51:53] and if you miss just say I'm sorry Lord
[51:55] help me to be more sensitive next time
[51:57] and you're forgiven there's no
[51:59] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[52:01] Jesus but because of our love for God we
[52:04] want to do what he he's called us to do
[52:07] Hallelujah so the timid little mother we
[52:10] got any timid little saints in here
[52:11] today I would say most of us are pretty
[52:13] timid in here right nobody walks up here
[52:16] and say brother Jesse let me tell you
[52:17] all about it let me do this let me do
[52:20] that I mean who's the most outspoken
[52:21] amongst us probably me brother Jose
[52:24] maybe Austin you know who who who enjoys
[52:27] talking in front of people we don't have
[52:29] we have a lot of timid people here by
[52:30] God's grace right so we can relate to
[52:33] this
[52:34] right timid little Believers and that's
[52:38] what I I want to be a timid little in
[52:39] God's sight
[52:41] Hallelujah I'm used to being the pastors
[52:43] I'm used to being in front of people but
[52:45] I want an attitude where I'm humble
[52:46] before
[52:48] God I want to approach god with
[52:50] reverence and and godly respects
[52:53] Hallelujah and
[52:54] honor so the Tim mother you know walked
[52:57] up to the lady and said sister I see you
[52:58] have a prayer card perhaps brother brand
[53:00] will pray for your baby tonight she said
[53:01] well we're hoping that number will be
[53:03] called sister she said would you excuse
[53:05] me if I said something to you look how
[53:08] humble her approach is not like bless
[53:11] God sister let me get out of your way
[53:12] give me this baby I'm gonna pray for her
[53:13] right now I've got faith right now would
[53:16] it be okay look how humble would it be
[53:19] okay if I I ask you something would it
[53:21] would it be okay see God always works in
[53:25] humility so certainly sister she said
[53:28] I'm a Christian too and I'm a mother and
[53:30] just to relieve my conscience so just to
[53:32] help me out for the last 30 minutes now
[53:34] look at that over half an hour God's
[53:37] dealing with her go pray for the baby go
[53:39] pray so Church let's remember that this
[53:42] week let's remember that if God deals
[53:44] with you for a number of minutes it's
[53:46] probably something you should
[53:48] do and this was so simple like right
[53:50] God's God's not asking her to part the
[53:52] Red
[53:53] Sea right God's not asking her to speak
[53:55] something into exist
[53:57] existance God's asking her go lay your
[53:59] hands on the baby and pray for the baby
[54:01] for half an
[54:02] hour see church that's what you'll see
[54:05] too in Services when a preacher is
[54:07] preaching on something and he keeps
[54:08] going back at it and you know it's for
[54:10] you that's probably God for like half
[54:13] hour or maybe the whole hour sermon like

[55:48] others above
[55:50] myself if somebody needs a chair you can
[55:53] have my
[55:54] chair and so that night on the platform
[55:57] sure enough she's in the prayer line the
[55:59] lady comes she got near of course and
[56:00] praying for the sick all you know how it
[56:03] happens I looked back over the
[56:05] recordings that was taken the lady was
[56:07] told by the Holy Spirit your baby has a
[56:09] certain disease yes there's a woman
[56:11] today dressed a certain way prayed for
[56:13] the baby it's already been
[56:16] healed and there was a little lady
[56:18] sitting up there in the balcony just
[56:20] what
[56:23] screaming hallelujah thank you Jesus
[56:27] I finally obeyed after a half an hour of
[56:29] wondering whether it was God's spirit
[56:30] and the church
[56:31] said I so happy I'm so thankful I was
[56:34] used by God
[56:36] Amen God nudged me for half an hour and
[56:39] I finally surrendered to the leadership
[56:41] of the holy spirit that would make
[56:43] anybody shout
[56:45] hallelujah amen God used me I'm a humble
[56:48] little timid Christian at bright of
[56:50] Christ Fellowship in a little old akan
[56:52] Ohio I'm a timid little Christian and
[56:54] God used me to heal somebody Hallelujah
[56:57] it wasn't me but God used my lips
[56:59] Hallelujah God used my faith amen
[57:02] hallelujah that don't make anybody
[57:04] scream
[57:08] Glory a timid little woman screaming up
[57:10] in the
[57:12] balcony oh thank you Jesus amen now God
[57:16] had ordained that that woman should pray
[57:18] for that baby even though brother random
[57:20] was there to pray for the
[57:22] baby you see how it was see how the Holy
[57:25] Spirit works
[57:26] the Bible said confess your faults to
[57:28] one another and pray for one another
[57:30] that you may be healed that's just not
[57:32] for preachers that's for
[57:36] everybody pray for one another so when
[57:39] God puts somebody on your heart and it's
[57:41] more than just one thing you should pray
[57:43] for that
[57:44] person what and I'll say like this when
[57:46] I'm walking in the spirit I just want
[57:47] one nud just give me I think you
[57:50] understand what I'm talking about you
[57:51] you understand too when you're walking
[57:52] in the spirit all you need is one nudge
[57:54] sometimes right how many you have seen
[57:56] that before one time I was uh somebody
[57:59] just called me on the phone I think and
[58:01] I was driving home from work I was I
[58:03] remember I was turning right on to 585
[58:04] on 21 South and I talked to him on the
[58:07] phone and I and I said I I'll pray for
[58:09] you as soon as we hang up I hung up and
[58:11] while I'm driving I just prayed for them
[58:13] and within a few moments I got the
[58:14] prayer request back that God had helped
[58:16] the person or maybe it was an hour it
[58:18] wasn't long after that and it was just
[58:20] one little
[58:22] prayer the Holy Spirit didn't have to
[58:23] nudge me you're Pray Again again you're
[58:26] home now pray again no no no Pray Again
[58:30] what I'm saying is that sorry I don't
[58:31] mean to push you but you understand what
[58:33] I'm saying you could beat me up
[58:35] anyways you don't understand what I'm
[58:36] saying when we're when we already have a
[58:38] transformed mind we'll pray right away
[58:40] praise God but if we're uncertain God
[58:43] will give us a little nudge come on
[58:44] Jesse come on I got students all the
[58:47] time that they have defiant disorders
[58:50] and so whatever I tell them they'll do
[58:51] the opposite I'll say line up they'll go
[58:53] the other way and so I have to gently
[58:56] gently move them into line we we we have
[59:00] permission you gently push him on the
[59:01] back and gently that's what God does to
[59:04] us sometimes we got defiant disorders oh
[59:06] my goodness
[59:08] Hallelujah sometimes we get evil spirits
[59:10] in our minds right doubt fear depression
[59:13] anger Hallelujah and God's got to push
[59:16] us and finally when we finally get in
[59:18] position God will use us we we'll start
[59:20] screaming thank God thank God for using
[59:22] my hble timid little life
[59:24] Hallelujah Glory
[59:28] see there's no individual person can
[59:30] heal it's not brother Jesse or anybody
[59:32] else
[59:33] healing no person can even save you
[59:35] against your will to heal you against
[59:38] your will it has to be your attitude
[59:40] towards Jesus Christ that determines
[59:41] your healing God just uses other people
[59:44] to encourage you to
[59:47] believe he said now God has s ministers
[59:49] to preach he put the word out there he
[59:51] put ministers to preach different things
[59:53] he's got members in the church people in
[59:55] the church God has said set the church
[59:56] in order and if the people would just
[59:57] get in the place where God put them then
[59:59] the church would be in order and I'm
[1:00:01] talking about myself too I'm not just
[1:00:02] reading that for all of you I want
[1:00:04] myself in order I realized this week I
[1:00:06] can't be in order if I'm struggling with
[1:00:07] certain things right if I'm if I can I
[1:00:11] lose sleep over this situation right I
[1:00:13] can't be in my right place I need God to
[1:00:16] rescue me
[1:00:17] Hallelujah I need God to transform My
[1:00:20] Mind by the renewing of my
[1:00:22] mind I believe this only through that
[1:00:25] since I've been repent pcal people I
[1:00:27] explain that as a Doctrine I believe the
[1:00:29] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:00:30] repentance we just preached on that on
[1:00:32] on Wednesday night Romans
[1:00:33] 11 I'm sorry yes and there's no way at
[1:00:36] all for you to do anything I believe in
[1:00:39] the election of God that God does the
[1:00:41] electing that means the
[1:00:43] choosing God does the calling you taking
[1:00:46] thought you could not add one cubit to
[1:00:48] your stature see but whatever God is
[1:00:50] determined to be it will be and you are
[1:00:53] called by election I've heard people say
[1:00:55] oh I sought God day and night no man
[1:00:57] never sought God at any time that's some
[1:00:59] good grammar right there no man never no
[1:01:02] never that's a double negative no man
[1:01:04] never sought God at any time God seeks
[1:01:07] man not man seeking God
[1:01:09] hallelujah if you ever sought God it was
[1:01:12] God saying seek me come on push me push
[1:01:14] me come on Jesse come on Amen come on
[1:01:17] Austin put seek me seek me seek me and
[1:01:19] when we finally seek him then we get the
[1:01:21] blessing of seeking him Hallelujah but
[1:01:24] it wasn't us that sought God it was God
[1:01:26] moving us to seek him come on Jesse come
[1:01:28] on come on come on Along beatric come on
[1:01:31] on right come on along Casey Come
[1:01:34] on God leading us into this it's God's
[1:01:38] calling it's God's
[1:01:40] election he said that's the very nature
[1:01:42] of God from the beginning it wasn't Adam
[1:01:45] Adam Adam should have been running
[1:01:47] around father father where are you it
[1:01:49] was God saying Adam Adam where are
[1:01:53] you when Adam sinned he wasn't saying
[1:01:55] God God God help me it was the exactly
[1:01:58] opposite running from Adam ran from God
[1:02:01] and God had to run after him same thing
[1:02:03] applies to
[1:02:05] us and I love this great verse Jeremiah
[1:02:08] 1:4 God told Jeremiah before you was
[1:02:10] even conceived in your mother's womb
[1:02:12] before you came from the belly I knew
[1:02:13] you I Sanctified you I ordained you a
[1:02:15] prophet to the Nations what did Jeremiah
[1:02:18] have to do with that let's all say
[1:02:19] together what he have to do with it he
[1:02:20] had nothing nothing huh so brother Mercy
[1:02:25] you had nothing to do with with the
[1:02:26] gifts God has placed in your life you
[1:02:27] had nothing to do with it brother Jose
[1:02:30] you had nothing to do with it it was all
[1:02:32] God God called you before you in your
[1:02:35] mother's womb he ordained you and he has
[1:02:38] a purpose for you Hallelujah and you
[1:02:41] just have to submit to his
[1:02:43] purpose Hallelujah that's all you have
[1:02:46] to do find what God's called you to do
[1:02:49] Paul said you must find the mystery of
[1:02:51] God's
[1:02:52] will
[1:02:54] Hallelujah God did it you had nothing to
[1:02:56] do with what God's called you to be like
[1:02:59] I told you this before too two people
[1:03:01] that knew me one is a sinner and one
[1:03:03] when I first got saved they knew
[1:03:04] automatically I was going to be a
[1:03:05] preacher and like I didn't think I was
[1:03:07] going to be a preacher I never I grew up
[1:03:09] in church I never thought I was going to
[1:03:10] be a preacher I didn't never feel like
[1:03:12] oh one day I'll get up there and I'll
[1:03:13] preach I never felt like that but this
[1:03:16] you know this former girlfriend I had in
[1:03:17] the world she once I got saved you know
[1:03:20] she just emailed me when to see how I
[1:03:21] was doing I said well I'm starting to
[1:03:22] preach the gospel you know she's like I
[1:03:24] always knew you'd be a preacher I'm like
[1:03:25] you didn't tell me
[1:03:26] that I mean not not that I needed her to
[1:03:29] tell me that but just interesting how
[1:03:31] did you see that in me and I wasn't even
[1:03:34] saved and then uh remember brother
[1:03:36] Browning came his wife she was here the
[1:03:39] first time she met me she said he's
[1:03:40] going to be a
[1:03:41] preacher I wish somebody would told me
[1:03:43] that too but I didn't see that I didn't
[1:03:46] see it but God has determined it's what
[1:03:50] God does I don't you and I have nothing
[1:03:51] to do with it it's God doing what he
[1:03:54] wants to do amen we are the he's the
[1:03:56] Potter
[1:03:57] amen it's God's Sovereign Grace his
[1:04:00] favor that does things God has set a
[1:04:02] church that's going to appear without
[1:04:04] spot or wrinkle he's already said that
[1:04:07] the church is
[1:04:10] foreordained and church you're a member
[1:04:12] in the body of Christ because you've
[1:04:13] been baptized into the holy
[1:04:16] spirit that makes you a member of the
[1:04:19] body of Christ
[1:04:22] Hallelujah now let's keep going in this
[1:04:24] chapter I told I told you I'm going to
[1:04:26] finish this chapter
[1:04:27] today I didn't know I was going to
[1:04:29] preach like this or the Lord was going
[1:04:30] to preach like this first we have many
[1:04:33] members in one body all members have not
[1:04:35] the same office which means a mode of
[1:04:36] acting we don't act all the same we
[1:04:38] don't all have the same business so we
[1:04:41] being many are one body in Christ and
[1:04:44] every me everyone members of One Another
[1:04:46] We're limbs of one another we're all
[1:04:48] connected to one another this is a limb
[1:04:51] right it's connected to so I'm connected
[1:04:52] to you you're connected to me we're all
[1:04:54] connected one to another kind like blood
[1:04:56] vessels that's a good way to look at it
[1:04:57] or nerves they're all connected to each
[1:05:00] other having then gifts differing
[1:05:03] according to the grace or favor that's
[1:05:05] given to us whether prophecy let us
[1:05:07] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:05:10] Faith now that word doesn't have a Greek
[1:05:12] meaning uh the translators put that word
[1:05:15] in there because it may it made the the
[1:05:18] the the scripture make sense it fit with
[1:05:21] the other scriptures above like the
[1:05:22] measure of the gift earlier that we read
[1:05:25] so the in the Websters it means a equal
[1:05:28] share everybody can use their gifts with
[1:05:30] the share that God's given them the
[1:05:33] portion God's given them right the
[1:05:35] easiest example is brother brandom right
[1:05:38] brother Bram had the prophetic gift the
[1:05:39] son of man Ministry he could tell them
[1:05:41] all the thoughts intents of their heart
[1:05:43] by the vision well if I have a dream
[1:05:47] right I can I had that dream I could
[1:05:48] tell the brother the thoughts of his
[1:05:50] heart right with playing with games but
[1:05:52] I couldn't do it like brother brandom I
[1:05:54] just have a little small little measure
[1:05:57] right understand so we can clearly see
[1:06:00] with brother Ram or Jesus Look what
[1:06:01] Jesus could do look at all the healings
[1:06:03] look he'd heal everybody man he would
[1:06:05] discern he know all the secrets and he
[1:06:08] it was God in flesh amen it was the
[1:06:10] fullness of God had bodily praise God
[1:06:12] but you and I have a small portion
[1:06:15] Hallelujah but remember brother Ram said
[1:06:17] if you have a spoonful of the ocean you
[1:06:19] got the same chemicals as the rest of
[1:06:20] the ocean amen hallelujah if you got the
[1:06:23] Holy Ghost you've got a portion of the
[1:06:25] same life that's in Christ hallelujah
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] amen now we definitely don't want to
[1:06:31] think more highly of our gifts than we
[1:06:33] ought to but we also don't want to limit
[1:06:35] God's
[1:06:38] gifts right so it's a great balance
[1:06:42] right we don't want to be too prideful
[1:06:45] but we don't want to be too
[1:06:47] humble
[1:06:49] Hallelujah so how do you know you know
[1:06:51] because you're confessed all your sins
[1:06:53] and you're looking for God's signs
[1:06:55] you're looking for God's leading in your
[1:06:57] life that's how you
[1:06:59] know
[1:07:03] Hallelujah verse seven or Ministry let
[1:07:06] us wait on the ministering now this is
[1:07:09] interesting this word ministry can mean
[1:07:10] a service a deacon or food
[1:07:13] preparation in other words wait until
[1:07:16] it's God's time for you to do this
[1:07:17] service that you're going to
[1:07:19] do or he that teacheth on teaching
[1:07:22] Simon's done a good job of that he's
[1:07:23] waited on God he's just been faith fful
[1:07:26] only has a few churches calling him now
[1:07:27] you know that's kind of like me the more
[1:07:30] the more we preach God's word you know
[1:07:32] the less invitations we get well that's
[1:07:33] fine by God's grace I'm not going to
[1:07:35] apologize for anything I believe if I
[1:07:37] can find it in the Bible by God's grace
[1:07:38] if people don't like it that's fine I
[1:07:40] like God's word hallelujah verse eight
[1:07:43] or he that exhorteth this means to
[1:07:45] comfort beg teach or
[1:07:47] instruct on exhortation see God has
[1:07:50] called some of us to exhort one another
[1:07:53] right that's what we looked at on
[1:07:54] Wednesday night God has called some of
[1:07:56] us to encourage each
[1:07:57] other right and some people have a gift
[1:08:00] to do that some people can really
[1:08:03] Comfort somebody or really teach or
[1:08:05] instruct
[1:08:07] somebody now he that giveth so some some
[1:08:09] people are better givers than others is
[1:08:12] that
[1:08:13] right oh yeah I've seen I've seen
[1:08:15] Christians they'll just hoard all their
[1:08:16] money like like they're going to take
[1:08:18] all their money to heaven with them
[1:08:20] right I mean you're not going to take
[1:08:22] anything with you and other people just
[1:08:24] give it away to you hardly got any
[1:08:26] anything left and sometimes finances get
[1:08:29] tight if you would have kept it more of
[1:08:31] it you would they wouldn't have been so
[1:08:32] tight but you want to give it
[1:08:36] away that's true and he that giveth let
[1:08:40] him do it with Simplicity or honesty or
[1:08:42] free from
[1:08:45] hypocrisy right that's what Paul says
[1:08:47] God loves a cheerful Giver whatever you
[1:08:48] give just be happy about
[1:08:50] it he that ruleth like a leader a
[1:08:53] preacher Deacon a trustee let him do it
[1:08:56] with diligence or
[1:08:57] earnestness right Earnest means you
[1:08:59] really want to get it done you're really
[1:09:01] focused on it you you you you're aware
[1:09:04] of what's going on you're not slothful
[1:09:06] and ignoring it you're Earnest about it
[1:09:08] you're going to make sure you're going
[1:09:09] to follow through and get this
[1:09:11] done he that showeth Mercy with
[1:09:14] cheerfulness or Readiness of
[1:09:17] mind so see some people have a gift of
[1:09:20] they have this Mercy that they express
[1:09:22] they're so cheerful they're so ready to
[1:09:24] show Mercy on people that might not seem
[1:09:27] very easy to show Mercy on praise God
[1:09:30] now you're getting quiet now say
[1:09:31] everybody's getting tired so I'm about
[1:09:33] my hour and a half so let me see where I
[1:09:34] should close I just need let me be
[1:09:36] sensitive to let me feel the nudge of
[1:09:38] the Holy Spirit here I Don't Preach too
[1:09:40] long by God's grace let love be without
[1:09:42] dissimulation which means disguise don't
[1:09:44] put a disguise on I love you take it off
[1:09:47] I hate you I love you I ha you that
[1:09:51] shouldn't be like that Hallelujah that's
[1:09:54] what the Bible said love and make sure
[1:09:56] you don't have a mask no masks amen just
[1:10:00] be you
[1:10:01] Hallelujah now look at this abhor that
[1:10:04] which is evil now God help us to have
[1:10:06] horror for sins I'm talking about sins
[1:10:08] on our cell phones I'm talking about
[1:10:10] sins uh thought life right any sin like
[1:10:16] we all know about horror movies if
[1:10:17] you're a sinner you know thankfully our
[1:10:18] children don't know too much you know
[1:10:20] but if you're a sinner you know what a
[1:10:22] horror movie is the Bible said we should
[1:10:23] have horror towards sin
[1:10:27] have horror towards that which is evil
[1:10:30] but be glued to that which is good amen
[1:10:33] just stay around that anything that's
[1:10:34] good just connect yourself with that all
[1:10:36] the time stay in the good stay in the
[1:10:38] good hate the
[1:10:40] evil stay in the good this is advice for
[1:10:43] Christians
[1:10:46] Hallelujah be kindly affection which
[1:10:48] means loving tenderly one to another
[1:10:50] with Brotherly
[1:10:51] Love sometimes I love these brothers so
[1:10:53] much I got to kiss them on their necks
[1:10:57] you know when I first come in the
[1:10:57] message I'm like how could they do that
[1:10:59] and I'm like I totally understand how
[1:11:01] they could do that they've been prayed
[1:11:02] for me they've been with me during my
[1:11:04] tough times they've been faithful
[1:11:05] they've done so much for me how could I
[1:11:07] not love
[1:11:08] them had to learn i' had to learn these
[1:11:10] things there's one brother used to kiss
[1:11:12] me all the time he don't kiss me anymore
[1:11:13] so I I probably need to talk to him did
[1:11:15] I offend you brother with something I
[1:11:17] said that's from over in another church
[1:11:22] he said be affectioned one to another
[1:11:24] with brotherly love that means
[1:11:25] cherishing one another I cherish our
[1:11:27] time together I don't want to take it
[1:11:29] for granted because something could
[1:11:32] happen in honor preferring one another
[1:11:36] so here is
[1:11:37] leadership so show the Bible says you
[1:11:40] should show you should cherish one
[1:11:41] another and then lead others into love
[1:11:45] so lead by example don't wait for
[1:11:47] somebody else to be kind you and I
[1:11:49] should be the leaders in
[1:11:51] kindness that that's what preferring one
[1:11:53] another means yeah I'm I'm going to take
[1:11:55] initiative and I'm going to show
[1:11:56] kindness first because that's what a
[1:11:58] Christian should
[1:12:00] do right I'm going to cherish this
[1:12:02] person because I prefer them right
[1:12:06] because I I want to I want to lead by
[1:12:09] example how many know Jesus led by
[1:12:13] example the Bible said don't be slothful
[1:12:16] which means sluggish or reluctant in
[1:12:18] your business now there's all days we
[1:12:19] don't want to go to work sometimes your
[1:12:21] work's right in your
[1:12:24] house right
[1:12:26] right stay at home moms sometimes the
[1:12:28] work is right in your house and so the
[1:12:30] Bible tells us don't be reluctant to
[1:12:33] work but be fervent amen which means I'm
[1:12:36] zealous to do good I'm I'm zealous to
[1:12:38] work I'm excited to go to work and the
[1:12:40] church said I'm excited to go to work
[1:12:42] tomorrow
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:47] amen he said be fervent serving the lord
[1:12:53] this means to be a slave now look at
[1:12:54] this I I want to show you what I see
[1:12:56] this word be be fervent serving the lord
[1:12:59] it actually means to literally be a
[1:13:00] slave this is the Greek
[1:13:02] Lexicon in other words I a slave to God
[1:13:05] like brother R says I'm a love slave to
[1:13:07] Jesus Christ amen I put myself into this
[1:13:10] slavery amen because if if I don't
[1:13:13] brother amen if I don't be a slave to
[1:13:15] Christ I'm gonna be a slave to sin so I
[1:13:17] know this is the right way amen I'm be a
[1:13:19] slave either way I'm I can't serve two
[1:13:21] masters I want to serve the master that
[1:13:23] I love amen I'm going to make my body a
[1:13:26] victim Hallelujah I'm going to make my
[1:13:28] body a sacrifice so I can be a slave to
[1:13:31] the one that I love amen I know what
[1:13:33] it's like to be a slave to to evil sins
[1:13:37] to to to drugs I know what on some level
[1:13:39] I know what that's like I don't want to
[1:13:41] be a slave to that I want to be a slave
[1:13:43] to the one who set me free from that
[1:13:45] hallelujah amen I want to yield my
[1:13:48] obedience to
[1:13:52] Christ I don't want to be a reluctant
[1:13:54] servant
[1:13:56] we've all like that's what I got this
[1:13:57] week I'm on the phone with some of these

[1:14:15] very good that's not a helpful servant
[1:14:17] or they're reluctant oh I guess I can

[1:14:21] amen this PNC Down the Road God bless
[1:14:23] them amen they they're really helpful

[1:14:27] reluctant like well I guess I'll help I
[1:14:30] I guess I'll do something nice let's be
[1:14:32] ready to help let's be
[1:14:35] fervent verse 12 rejoicing which means
[1:14:38] to be glad in Hope be glad in expecting
[1:14:42] God's
[1:14:43] goodness how many expect God to do
[1:14:45] something good in your
[1:14:47] life be patient which means endure your
[1:14:50] pressures right right Haven that was
[1:14:53] good scripture there Haven we're the
[1:14:55] clay he's the Potter be be patient to
[1:14:59] endure when God puts pressure on your
[1:15:01] life and he allows
[1:15:03] it just and just get through
[1:15:06] it so I woke up Monday morning that's
[1:15:08] when I first logged in I checked my
[1:15:09] finances that's when I saw oh I'm hacked
[1:15:12] and I finally had Grace Friday by Friday
[1:15:14] I was finally got got out of this
[1:15:15] pressure finally my accounts are frozen
[1:15:18] finally no more money's going out and I
[1:15:19] could just breathe a sigh relief
[1:15:22] yesterday Hallelujah just had to endure
[1:15:24] it a whole week of
[1:15:27] stress continuing instant in
[1:15:31] prayer now that means being always ready
[1:15:33] to pray always be ready to pray for
[1:15:35] somebody now I'm going to finish up I'm
[1:15:37] going to finish this chapter because
[1:15:38] this this my hour and a half
[1:15:40] Distributing to the necessity of the
[1:15:41] Saints so not the wants of the Saints
[1:15:43] but the needs of the Saints amen right
[1:15:46] we've all seen different people at
[1:15:47] different churches where uh they want
[1:15:49] the they want things but it's not their
[1:15:51] needs it's the needs of the Saints
[1:15:54] Hallelujah right so it's very important
[1:15:56] that we recognize that remember in the
[1:15:58] book of Acts uh they were ignoring
[1:16:00] widows that didn't even have daily food
[1:16:02] they wouldn't even give them daily
[1:16:04] food think about that a book of Acts
[1:16:06] church and some of these people were so
[1:16:08] proud they wouldn't even give the widows
[1:16:10] any food throughout the
[1:16:12] day God's got to come around and say I'm
[1:16:14] going to raise up some Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:15] men called deacons they're going to make
[1:16:17] sure these women get their
[1:16:19] food it's it's striking that Christians
[1:16:22] need reminders about the Necessities
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:26] given to
[1:16:27] hospitality so we should be willing to
[1:16:29] host other people praise God bless them
[1:16:33] which persecute you bless and curse not
[1:16:36] that's what's been happening to me some
[1:16:37] a lot of people or a few people been
[1:16:39] cursing me online what's my job to say
[1:16:41] God bless you you don't like what I
[1:16:43] preach God bless you I'm not going to
[1:16:45] curse you God's GNA take care of
[1:16:47] it right I'm going to bless them well I
[1:16:51] hope God blesses you with a repentant
[1:16:53] heart Rejoice with them that do rejoice
[1:16:55] and weep with them that weep so again
[1:16:57] recognizing the seasons of our lives
[1:17:00] right if somebody's really happy let's
[1:17:01] be happy with them praise God if
[1:17:03] somebody's sad let's show them care and
[1:17:05] compassion let's cry some tears with
[1:17:07] them as well
[1:17:10] Hallelujah this is what a Christian does
[1:17:12] remember this chapter caused a 16-day
[1:17:14] Revival last year preaching this chapter
[1:17:18] see because these college student they
[1:17:20] had never done any of this before the
[1:17:22] church said they were going to that's a
[1:17:25] Christian College they go there to be to
[1:17:27] learn how to be a Christian like to and

[1:17:35] church for two weeks they didn't know
[1:17:37] how long it was going to
[1:17:39] last but see this is and you know a a
[1:17:42] lot of those kids that go to these
[1:17:43] Christian Schools they're raised in
[1:17:44] church but they never had an experience

[1:18:09] the Holy Spirit spoke through my lips
[1:18:11] hallelujah
[1:18:13] amen a lot of these people never had
[1:18:15] their own personal experience I just say
[1:18:17] thank God if they got one
[1:18:20] hallelujah hallelujah let me say this if
[1:18:23] they got one I'll just say it like this
[1:18:25] may God give you Grace because the
[1:18:27] spirit of God will lead you in the
[1:18:28] wilderness to be
[1:18:29] tempted I just read that this week Jesus
[1:18:32] gets the Holy Ghost and then the spirit
[1:18:33] of God the next chapter leads him in the
[1:18:35] wilderness to be
[1:18:38] tempted brother BR said that's what God
[1:18:40] will do to you he'll give you an
[1:18:42] injection of the Holy Spirit and then
[1:18:44] let's see if if the diseases will harm
[1:18:46] you and of course the diseases won't
[1:18:47] harm you because you've got a greater
[1:18:49] power that's within you Hallelujah
[1:18:51] you're not going to get sick in the
[1:18:52] things of the world you've already got
[1:18:54] the in ction Hallelujah you've got the

[1:19:04] of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:07] Hallelujah be of the same mind one
[1:19:09] toward
[1:19:10] another mind not high things don't mind
[1:19:13] honor and riches this is a church that
[1:19:16] battled
[1:19:17] pride and no doubt because there in Rome
[1:19:19] it was the richest the richest Kingdom
[1:19:22] of the world just lot like America right
[1:19:26] but condescend or yield yourself submit
[1:19:29] oneself to lowly things I've said this
[1:19:31] before but church if you see somebody
[1:19:33] that don't have anybody to talk to go
[1:19:34] talk to them and you know nobody wants
[1:19:37] to talk to that person condescend humble
[1:19:40] yourself and go talk to that person just
[1:19:41] show them some
[1:19:43] love right happens all the time at
[1:19:46] school I I'm able to smile at kids wave
[1:19:48] at kids see how they're doing right I've
[1:19:51] done that other church fellowships I've
[1:19:52] seen that you know when I preach to
[1:19:54] other churches I'll go sit with the
[1:19:55] people I won't sit with the preacher
[1:19:57] sometimes I'll sit with the people that
[1:19:58] don't have anybody sit with
[1:20:00] them right now sometimes the preacher
[1:20:02] wants you to sit by them right because
[1:20:04] you are their
[1:20:05] guest but the Bible tells us this is
[1:20:10] Christianity submit yourself to people
[1:20:13] that you see they're less fortunate than
[1:20:15] you to Men of low estate be not wise in
[1:20:19] your own conceits like those Walmart
[1:20:21] workers I'll stop and talk to them some
[1:20:23] people will just walk right by them I'll
[1:20:25] talk and say yes sir how you doing God
[1:20:27] bless you talk about Jesus right these
[1:20:29] are the low people these are the lowest
[1:20:31] people we'd say you know they're they're

[1:20:34] in
[1:20:35] Walmart wish you

[1:20:42] evil for evil provide things honest in
[1:20:44] the sight of all men Hallelujah so again
[1:20:49] honesty not returning evil for evil so
[1:20:52] turning the other cheek as Jesus said
[1:20:54] right
[1:20:55] giving love when they've given you hate
[1:20:58] this is the Christian
[1:21:00] Life if it be possible everybody say
[1:21:03] possible possible sometimes it's not
[1:21:05] possible as much as lith in you live
[1:21:08] peaceably with all men just try to bring
[1:21:10] peace to the situation and church it's
[1:21:12] very easy I've seen it many times just
[1:21:14] humble yourself and say you're sorry
[1:21:17] even if you didn't do anything and they
[1:21:19] misunderstood just say I'm sorry if I
[1:21:21] did that I'm sorry if if I hurt your
[1:21:23] feelings and you know no you didn't but
[1:21:26] if it brings peace Hallelujah for
[1:21:29] peace that's what we need the Bible said
[1:21:31] let's have peace within our gates in
[1:21:33] other words let's have peace in our
[1:21:35] homes this is the last La yeah last last
[1:21:38] uh scriptures here musicians going to
[1:21:39] come let me finish with this let's stand
[1:21:40] to our feet I'm just going to finish the
[1:21:44] chapter dearly beloved look what he
[1:21:46] calls him you're my you're my dearly
[1:21:49] beloved I think that means apple of my
[1:21:51] eye if I'm not mistaken in the Greek
[1:21:54] dear dearly beloved he's writing to the
[1:21:55] dearly beloved Saints in
[1:21:57] Rome avenge not don't punish people that
[1:22:01] have mistreated you don't punish
[1:22:04] them right we're all tempted to get
[1:22:06] revenge this person said this well look
[1:22:08] what I'm going to say right this person
[1:22:11] stole from me look what I'm going to do
[1:22:12] to
[1:22:13] them don't punish people but rather and
[1:22:16] don't give Place unto
[1:22:19] wrath like I've told you this before
[1:22:21] different family
[1:22:22] members they get so bottled up in
[1:22:24] different friends and co-workers I've
[1:22:25] had they'll get so bowled up they'll
[1:22:26] just explode then they'll be like oh I
[1:22:29] feel better now well of course because
[1:22:32] you just you poured out your wrath but
[1:22:34] you shouldn't do
[1:22:36] that you shouldn't keep you shouldn't
[1:22:38] Harbor all those evil spirits you should
[1:22:40] cast them on the Lord amen cast your
[1:22:43] cares on the Lord for he cares for you
[1:22:48] Hallelujah it is written vengeance is
[1:22:50] mine God will pay these people
[1:22:52] back I will repay sayeth the
[1:22:56] Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger
[1:22:58] feed him so if there's any enemy if
[1:23:01] anyone's going against you now try to
[1:23:03] feed them if he thirst give him drink
[1:23:05] for in doing so Thou shalt reap coals of
[1:23:08] fire on his head here's what this
[1:23:10] means it means this is
[1:23:14] proverbial when you do a favor on your
[1:23:16] enemy the memory in him of his own
[1:23:21] wrong gives him pain like there's l five
[1:23:24] coals burning on his
[1:23:27] head anybody ever felt that as a child
[1:23:30] maybe your sibling was nice to you and
[1:23:32] you were mean to
[1:23:33] them anybody ever feel that before I
[1:23:35] felt
[1:23:36] that right whenever I whenever I've done
[1:23:38] something wrong whenever I've whenever
[1:23:40] I've sinned or whatever and I know and
[1:23:42] someone some good happens to me it's
[1:23:44] like like you feel this hotness on your
[1:23:46] head am I the only one out there am
[1:23:48] might be the only one okay well at least
[1:23:50] I'm in the Bible by God's grace
[1:23:53] Hallelujah but when you you do good to
[1:23:55] those that do evil it's like pulling
[1:23:57] it's like pouring live coals on their
[1:23:59] head you've seen it on cartoons
[1:24:02] right that's what it is and it it makes
[1:24:05] them remember that's right I did Evil to
[1:24:07] you and you're doing good to me and it
[1:24:09] makes them
[1:24:10] upset that's what the Bible says now
[1:24:13] this is not the kind of coal we want we
[1:24:15] don't want the coal on our our head we
[1:24:17] want the coal on our
[1:24:19] tongue like just struck me right now
[1:24:21] just like when it struck
[1:24:23] Isaiah God said who will go for me and
[1:24:26] the Bible said God an angel took a live
[1:24:28] coal from the altar this was a holy coal
[1:24:31] Hallelujah and that Holy Co touched his
[1:24:33] lips he said now my lips are clean he
[1:24:35] said here am I send me Jesus amen that's
[1:24:39] what we need coals Hallelujah we need
[1:24:41] the fire of God in our lips
[1:24:45] Hallelujah we don't want to take wrath
[1:24:47] on other people we don't want to take
[1:24:48] revenge on people we want the fire of
[1:24:50] God in our lips so we have clean
[1:24:52] words our mouth is cleaned out with the
[1:24:55] Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah the
[1:24:59] Bible said no man can tame the tongue
[1:25:01] only the Holy Ghost contain the
[1:25:05] tongue
[1:25:08] Hallelujah do not punish for other
[1:25:10] people for their mistakes towards uh
[1:25:12] towards you and I God will
[1:25:16] repay be not overcome with evil but
[1:25:19] overcome evil with good there's I used
[1:25:22] to sing that song in Sunday School
[1:25:24] always wonder why am I singing this and
[1:25:26] now I know Hallelujah I know I'm going
[1:25:29] to choose one of the other I'm going to
[1:25:30] let either power take me over the church
[1:25:33] said you're either going to let evil
[1:25:36] evil take you over and just let evil
[1:25:39] fuel your life or you're going to let
[1:25:41] the Holy Spirit F fuel your life amen
[1:25:44] hallelujah I'm G to be o I'm either
[1:25:46] going to be overcome with evil or
[1:25:48] overcome with God's spirit hallelujah oh
[1:25:50] let's yield our spirits to God
[1:25:52] hallelujah let's have a transform mind
[1:25:54] Hallelujah where our minds are
[1:25:56] transformed and our lives are patterned
[1:25:58] after the Christian Life
[1:26:01] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 6:12 this is a
[1:26:03] verse I Ed when I overcome tobacco you
[1:26:06] probably got it memorized
[1:26:07] now I didn't know I told him Christ I
[1:26:10] said I don't know how I'll ever quit
[1:26:11] chewing tobacco but I saw this I saw
[1:26:13] this man he lost his jaw from chewing
[1:26:15] tobacco and I I hung that up as a
[1:26:17] warning to me and I wrote 1 Corinthians
[1:26:19] 6:12 all things are lawful unto me but
[1:26:22] all things are not expedient but I will
[1:26:24] not be brought under the power of any
[1:26:28] and I read that verse Mercy every day
[1:26:31] and I started saying I'm not going to be
[1:26:32] brought under the power of this thing
[1:26:34] now I was but I was talking like I
[1:26:37] wasn't I was like Abraham calling those
