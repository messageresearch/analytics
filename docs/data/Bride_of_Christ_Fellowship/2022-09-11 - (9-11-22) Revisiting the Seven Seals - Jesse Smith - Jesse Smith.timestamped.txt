[0:00] earlier this year we visited the seven
[0:01] seals and the seven thunders i'm sorry
[0:03] the seventh seal rather and the seven
[0:05] thunders and that was a real blessing
[0:07] i've got numerous emails around the
[0:08] world from those couple of sermons there
[0:10] so
[0:11] i'm glad it was a blessing and hopefully
[0:12] this will be a good revisit as well
[0:15] by the grace of the lord
[0:17] revelation chapter six verse one and two
[0:19] we'll just read the first seal here by
[0:21] god's grace this was of course requested
[0:23] by brother amen so
[0:25] last time since we only requested the
[0:26] seven thunder so
[0:28] anyone else has any other requests you
[0:29] know we'd like to
[0:31] be able to minister to those by the
[0:32] grace of god
[0:34] and preach those
[0:37] you know this really is what defines us
[0:39] this is what separates us from other
[0:40] churches the revelation that god has
[0:42] done in this day praise god
[0:45] god always has a message of the hour
[0:47] there's always something there's always
[0:48] prophecy god is fulfilling in every age
[0:51] this is the prophecy that god has
[0:53] fulfilled in our day praise god the
[0:55] mysteries of god must be finished aren't
[0:57] you glad they're finished amen they're
[0:59] revealed all the bible defined mysteries
[1:02] are finished they are revealed praise
[1:04] god revelation chapter 6 verses 1 and 2.
[1:09] let's just read this together if we can
[1:11] hear on three one two three and i saw
[1:14] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[1:17] and i heard as it were the noise of
[1:20] thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:22] come and see
[1:24] and i saw and behold a white horse and
[1:28] he that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:31] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:34] conquering and to conquer may god add
[1:37] his blessing to ring of his word you may
[1:39] be seated god bless you i have uh some
[1:42] scriptures i'd like to show here today
[1:44] so
[1:45] i can switch over when you're ready
[1:47] some of this is a little bit of a review
[1:49] from when i did preach on seven thunders
[1:52] as far as uh and then the seven seals
[1:54] and remember the seven seals have three
[1:56] forms so i'm not gonna have a lot of
[1:58] time to be able to
[1:59] revisit that
[2:01] so the last time i preached this was
[2:02] 2010 so almost 13 years ago so it's
[2:06] been a while since we went through these
[2:08] um so it's good brother amen you know
[2:10] that's before you came buddy my god
[2:12] um
[2:15] so it's been quite a while and as i told
[2:17] you these are some of the most important
[2:18] studies the holy spirit ever led me on
[2:21] was the seven church ages and the seven
[2:23] seals
[2:25] preached over 120 i think sermons on the
[2:27] book of revelation
[2:29] and so it was just it was foundational i
[2:32] needed to understand the book of
[2:33] revelation you know to understand almost
[2:35] everything else
[2:37] which makes sense it is the climax book
[2:39] is the fine the finale of the entire
[2:41] written text of the bible
[2:44] um
[2:45] and then as we saw last week brother
[2:46] simon shared how brother branham said
[2:49] satan hates two books of the bible the
[2:50] most genesis and revelation his origin
[2:53] and then also
[2:54] uh in revelation yes it speaks of his
[2:57] demise but also unmasks all his tricks
[3:01] it unmasked that as well so that's why
[3:03] he hates it not just his demise
[3:05] of course he knows he and all the fallen
[3:07] angels will be burned and annihilated
[3:09] and done away with in the lake of fire
[3:11] but it unmasked him and his work through
[3:14] the false church and the beasts
[3:16] uh the beast out of the sea and all the
[3:18] wicked beasts here of course of the book
[3:21] of revelation but thank god there's some
[3:22] good beasts in there too amen hallelujah
[3:25] hallelujah thank god for his mercy
[3:27] and his grace
[3:29] so i guess we'll just start right here
[3:30] let's revisit the seven seals here and
[3:32] the deeds of nicolaitans
[3:36] well i think we'll enjoy this here by
[3:38] the grace of god
[3:40] i'm a little tired today is everyone a
[3:41] little tired today seems like uh yeah
[3:46] me too nature me too
[3:49] it was a it was a long week you know it
[3:51] was a long work
[3:52] you know we had monday off you know but
[3:54] i feel like the pressure of five days or
[3:56] squeezed into four
[3:57] and then yesterday you know i worked
[3:59] kind of hard outside a little bit at the
[4:00] end of the day and kind of wore myself
[4:02] out so it's kind of my fault i just kind
[4:04] of felt like i got to get this yard work
[4:05] done
[4:06] uh
[4:07] so i'm a little tired today so forgive
[4:08] me i'm going to try to trust the spirit
[4:10] of god will anoint me as we just sang
[4:11] amen anoint you by god's grace brother
[4:14] ram said you know i heard him say it
[4:16] this week he said usually on sunday
[4:17] morning everybody comes in real
[4:18] refreshed
[4:20] and then so you see then you're tired in
[4:22] the evening service you know so
[4:23] um i'm a little tired this morning so
[4:26] i just need god's help and i trust god
[4:28] to speak to us here today so
[4:30] let's revisit this we read our texts
[4:32] here now there are numerous resources if
[4:35] you'd like more on this i'm not going to
[4:36] be able to cover everything it's a
[4:37] tremendous topic
[4:39] but there's at least four resources you
[4:40] know i have free books out there you can
[4:42] take as many of those books as you want
[4:46] there's seven church ages books out
[4:47] there seven seals the revelation of the
[4:49] seven seal books out there
[4:51] and i would encourage you you know i
[4:52] mentioned this on wednesday we must grow
[4:54] in grace and the knowledge
[4:57] and that's what a lot of message people
[4:58] don't do they don't grow in knowledge or
[5:00] understanding
[5:02] of the word of god
[5:03] and uh i was listening to different uh
[5:07] it's called productivity guys they're
[5:09] productivity uh
[5:12] experts and they said and they showed by
[5:14] by research if you want to become an
[5:16] expert in any subject you must apply 10
[5:20] 000 hours of deep study into it now
[5:22] think about think about your job by the
[5:23] email how many hours you had to go to
[5:25] school right for that job but if
[5:26] anything about the hours of training
[5:29] uh and and the hours you know that you
[5:30] put into that brother brother austin now
[5:32] as a supervisor i think if you really
[5:35] want to become an expert at that
[5:36] position you need at least 10 000 hours
[5:39] that's what they find and that's for any
[5:41] topic
[5:43] and the reason i say that is because
[5:46] if you just do two hours a day
[5:48] on a subject
[5:50] it takes you 14 years to become an
[5:52] expert on that death
[5:54] and that's that's really what i get as a
[5:56] pastor i get two to three hours of study
[5:58] every morning i try to study before i
[5:59] come to work before i go to work and
[6:01] then on the weekend i get a little extra
[6:02] hours you know um
[6:06] but think about that if you want to be
[6:08] we're not we're not ever trying to call
[6:09] ourselves experts but we do want to know
[6:11] god
[6:13] so we would never label like oh i'm a
[6:14] message expert or i'm a christian expert
[6:16] that's not what that's that's prideful
[6:18] we're not trying to give ourselves ex
[6:21] labels as an expert that's not the point
[6:22] i'm making but the point i'm making is
[6:24] if you want to grow in knowledge of god
[6:26] you've got to put significant time into
[6:28] it
[6:29] what i mean is coming to church two or
[6:31] three times a week is good but you need
[6:33] more than that
[6:34] because it
[6:35] and and uh you know it's proven by the
[6:38] american education system you can take
[6:40] uh you know the the number of of baptist
[6:42] presbyterian denominational students
[6:45] the number of them of the students that
[6:47] fall away when they go to college is
[6:49] astronomical
[6:51] it's like 80 or 90 of kids raised in
[6:54] church with just a couple hours of
[6:55] services each week
[6:58] when they go to college all those hours
[7:01] at college
[7:03] brainwashes them and all those spirits
[7:05] of evolution and you know lgbt whatever
[7:09] all those letters
[7:10] all that all those hours in there they
[7:12] become experts on
[7:14] lies in other words
[7:17] if people don't devote significant time
[7:19] to growing in the knowledge of god
[7:21] they can fall away from it
[7:23] right we've all seen it people can come
[7:25] to our church for years every sunday
[7:28] not
[7:29] most of them don't come every wednesday
[7:31] some of them can be there every sunday
[7:33] for years
[7:34] uh and they'll skip sunday nights you
[7:36] know or whatever whatever they feel like
[7:38] to do but but then if they don't take
[7:40] the time in between those services to
[7:42] really draw close to god and grow in
[7:45] knowledge
[7:46] they'll feel that time becoming experts
[7:48] on other subjects
[7:50] or other relationships that are not holy
[7:53] and then they'll eventually fall away
[7:55] from the faith
[7:57] we've seen over and over you know over
[7:59] and over
[8:00] so in other words what i'm saying is
[8:01] that if you want to grow in grace you've
[8:02] got to devote significant time outside
[8:05] of church
[8:06] into investing in the things of god and
[8:08] the knowledge of god
[8:10] praise god
[8:14] and so we have uh those free books and
[8:16] then you know uh brother amen asked me
[8:18] to put together a playlist on youtube so
[8:20] i put that together of all my book of
[8:21] revelation videos i haven't got to
[8:24] revelation 17-22 i just kind of felt led
[8:27] to stop and i started dealing with the
[8:28] tape church topics and all these other
[8:30] topics but at some point in the future i
[8:31] hope to finish those
[8:33] but if you want a chapter summary of of
[8:36] the first 16 chapters we have that
[8:38] uh chapter seven in this book uh it's
[8:40] over 80 pages you know uh all on the
[8:44] book of revelation here
[8:46] and then uh brother simon's brother
[8:48] simon put out the video of the deeds of
[8:49] nicholas he did an hour long or maybe
[8:51] two hour long bible study on that one
[8:53] and that's available on the living
[8:55] waters tabernacle web or youtube channel
[8:57] if you want to watch that it's actually
[8:58] their highest
[8:59] rated video
[9:00] the most views of all their other video
[9:02] services you know has been that deeds of
[9:04] the nicolaitans so
[9:06] i think those are some good resources uh
[9:08] i'm sure i'll think of other resources
[9:10] you know
[9:11] but that's a good place to get started
[9:12] if you want to really grow in grace and
[9:14] knowledge of the lord on these topics
[9:18] and uh you know so these are some quotes
[9:20] from long ago when i used to put
[9:21] different colors on there you know so 10
[9:23] years 12 years ago
[9:24] brother ram said of all the times i've
[9:26] ever been in the pulpit at the
[9:28] tabernacle i've never never in any time
[9:30] in my ministry ever worked into the
[9:32] realms of god in the spiritual realms as
[9:34] it's been this time it's beyond anything
[9:37] i ever did in any time of my ministry in
[9:39] any meeting at anywhere like this
[9:42] mostly it's on healing
[9:45] this is revealing of truth by the same
[9:47] spirit
[9:48] hallelujah so the holy spirit would work
[9:51] with brother branham in visions for
[9:52] divine healing that was a great
[9:54] anointing but he says even greater than
[9:56] divine healing was the spiritual realms
[9:58] when i would see visions in able to give
[10:01] us thus saith the lord on the word of
[10:03] god now that's true
[10:05] that's totally true
[10:07] because think about it you know church
[10:08] i've been reading i just read through
[10:09] ezekiel right now i'm in jeremiah and
[10:11] over and over god tells jeremiah tell
[10:13] them thus saith the lord
[10:15] thus saith the lord thus saith the lord
[10:18] in other words jeremiah is hearing
[10:20] directly from god
[10:22] and giving the people thus saith the
[10:25] lord and and very few people have that
[10:28] ability
[10:29] it's a very small group that can hear
[10:31] directly from god and then
[10:34] pass that on to the people so they have
[10:36] thus saith the lord
[10:38] hallelujah in that last chapter in
[10:39] chapter 13 of this book i have 31 thus
[10:42] saith the lords from brother branham in
[10:44] that last chapter
[10:45] we have been blessed to be able to have
[10:48] the bible revealed to us with thus saith
[10:51] the lord not thus saith of the southern
[10:53] baptist convention
[10:55] not thus saith jesse smith or not thus
[10:58] saith william branham but thus saith the
[11:01] lord god amen hallelujah that's the
[11:04] blessing that we have praise god
[11:06] which
[11:07] which proves to us whenever we come up
[11:09] against an adversary or someone who
[11:12] descends against us we don't have to
[11:14] worry about anything because we can take
[11:16] everything we believe right back to the
[11:17] bible in fact we had that on monday
[11:19] night buddy
[11:20] but it was all in love it was very good
[11:22] it was all in love we had that on monday
[11:24] night so this week we had someone
[11:26] probably questioned me for like at least
[11:28] two hours we were questioning back and
[11:30] forth on everything yeah i remember
[11:31] monday night uh
[11:34] and everything there was an answer for
[11:35] on the major things now the minor things
[11:37] like flat earth i didn't go
[11:40] i don't have enough state the lord on
[11:41] flat earth or spirit
[11:44] that's a funny topic around here
[11:48] it makes me laugh
[11:50] somebody just sent me another email
[11:51] about it from overseas this week i'm
[11:52] like oh here we go again i don't know
[11:54] man
[11:56] but for two hours straight this person
[11:58] asked me the question after a question
[11:59] and i i was so stirred up i had to go
[12:01] draw it on the paper and i wrote all the
[12:03] scriptures three parts of man and
[12:05] he's like oh i've never seen that before
[12:06] never seen that before never
[12:08] but we've seen it praise god amen we've
[12:10] seen it because god showed it to a
[12:12] prophet hallelujah
[12:13] that's why we can say we've got thus
[12:15] saith the lord because god showed it to
[12:17] a prophet give us thus state the lord
[12:19] and thus saith the lord will always
[12:20] point back to thus saith the bible
[12:22] so i just love times like that and after
[12:24] i drew it up it was all chicken scratch
[12:26] i'm like oh i'll throw that away he's
[12:27] like oh no no let me keep that
[12:30] so these revelations are so great that
[12:32] he just wants to you know he went at
[12:33] that moment at that moment he wanted to
[12:35] keep him and save him for later
[12:37] and everything he told me there was
[12:39] his ideas there was no scripture for it
[12:41] but everything i told him there was
[12:43] scripture for church when we when we
[12:45] heard this message we heard thus saith
[12:47] the lord amen amen we heard the thoughts
[12:49] of god directed back to the bible praise
[12:51] god
[12:53] and that's how i know we've got the
[12:54] truth praise god because everything that
[12:56] we've been taught we can take it right
[12:58] back to the scripture and it's not thus
[12:59] saith uh william branham or
[13:02] not thus saith clarence larkin or thus
[13:04] saith ormond neville but it's thus saith
[13:06] the lord god almighty and his name is
[13:08] the lord jesus christ
[13:11] amen so again the the spiritual workings
[13:14] of revelation are greater than the
[13:16] spiritual workings of divine healing
[13:19] he says i've been to myself all together
[13:21] now how how do you get in these
[13:22] spiritual realms there it is right there
[13:23] amen how do you get in these spiritual
[13:25] realms spend time with god alone amen
[13:28] you want if you want these spiritual
[13:30] realms of knowledge and revelation
[13:32] you've got to spend time alone with god
[13:34] in prayer and study spend time with your
[13:36] heavenly father your father can't wait
[13:38] till you can talk to his child amen
[13:41] that's right
[13:42] i've been boarding at a place uh going
[13:44] down eating at a place i've been just
[13:46] alone so it's been a really good time
[13:48] huh you can be alone and have a good
[13:50] time yes because really you're not alone
[13:52] god is with you praise god
[13:55] hallelujah
[13:59] he said
[14:00] okay so he says i just so i must just
[14:02] get to myself a little while the human
[14:04] mind can only stand so much and when you
[14:06] get to a spot where you're at an hour
[14:07] numbed with the presence of god and the
[14:09] pillar of light hanging there before you
[14:11] you can't stay there too long the human
[14:13] being can't stand it
[14:15] and i i have some charts at the end
[14:17] where i'll show brother ram's revelation
[14:19] on the seven seals is totally different
[14:20] from clarence larkin it's totally
[14:22] different from uh charles tays russell
[14:25] and and i've did a podcast about that
[14:27] that's what they're accusing brother
[14:28] branham of and these people they say
[14:30] they're researchers but they're not
[14:31] researchers they're propagandists
[14:35] that's right because i've done the
[14:37] research i've read the books i've spent
[14:39] the time in there now i got one more guy
[14:40] to research that's uriah smith
[14:43] from the seventh day of venice now they
[14:45] have some things right
[14:46] modesty they've got some things right
[14:48] now they got that saturday all mixed up
[14:50] they boy they they sure they sure that's
[14:53] that's their major
[14:54] if you worship on sunday you are
[14:55] catholic well then paul was a catholic
[14:57] because paul worshipped on the first day
[14:59] of the week preached so long people fell
[15:01] asleep
[15:03] he didn't
[15:04] uh he did feet washing and communion on
[15:06] set on sunday praise god
[15:08] uh that you know you pointed those
[15:10] scriptures they said oh that's just that
[15:11] was just one time no that wasn't history
[15:14] says it was all the time
[15:16] so these you know it's fine people got
[15:17] to have their they got to have their
[15:18] their creeds but we don't want man's
[15:20] creeds we want the truth we want true
[15:22] doctrine praise god it produces the true
[15:24] life of christ
[15:26] surely does now i know it's a lot of
[15:28] words there but i'm going to read it god
[15:29] is the evil age brother man says the
[15:31] seven seals help the bride see the
[15:32] deception the antichrist and the serpent
[15:35] seed people
[15:36] right the bride of christ is vowed to
[15:38] christ he is the word not even wink at
[15:40] the other side a woman should not even
[15:42] wink at another man she should make no
[15:44] signs no emotions at all towards him for
[15:46] she's absolutely a bride to one
[15:48] bridegroom we don't want none of you
[15:49] your mixed trees your denominations be
[15:51] true to christ the word he'll vindicate
[15:54] it to be true
[15:55] all right brother austin he'll vindicate
[15:57] it it's true
[15:58] you're telling me that on the phone on
[15:59] thursday night
[16:01] god will back up his word we don't want
[16:03] none of your i'm sorry yeah no sir not
[16:05] even any emotion or anything towards
[16:06] making love to him not join his ranks or
[16:09] anything else or let let you get him in
[16:11] his arms or his care or talk you over
[16:13] this way that way you listen to only one
[16:15] voice my sheep know my voice a stranger
[16:18] he says they'll not follow
[16:19] what is his voice any man's voice is his
[16:21] word and that is it the bible
[16:24] god's voice is the bible praise god
[16:27] hallelujah and i want to be an expert in
[16:29] this book right here
[16:31] i appreciate all the other books i
[16:32] appreciate the silence and i appreciate
[16:34] because god created science you know i
[16:36] appreciate that but one thing i want to
[16:38] be really understanding is god's holy
[16:40] word
[16:42] not one word to be added to it or taken
[16:44] from it just stay right with the voice a
[16:46] stranger that won't follow denomination
[16:48] as she is part of the groom true to him
[16:50] at every point waiting the wedding
[16:52] uniting not at the economical council
[16:54] but in the sky the wedding supper
[16:57] she has
[16:58] been given for this is our own church
[17:00] she's been given and revealed to her the
[17:02] seven seal mysteries of the bible she
[17:05] sees the folly of the deceiver
[17:07] so very close to the truth that almost
[17:09] deceived the elected she sees it she
[17:12] sees the two opposing spirits that work
[17:14] in the evil age can you see it each very
[17:16] religious cain and abel spirits again
[17:19] coming to their heads still same as they
[17:21] started one worshiping by beauty and by
[17:23] knowledge and by education by science
[17:25] and by ethics and the other one by faith
[17:28] of the revelation the word of god both
[17:30] of them is standing right in this
[17:31] building this morning this is what he
[17:32] said in the goddess evil age isn't that
[17:34] something a lot of those guys in that
[17:35] building were brandon worshippers
[17:38] but they were just as religious
[17:40] i'm just going to call his name fred
[17:42] sothman
[17:43] died years ago he was a branham
[17:45] worshiper
[17:46] they got video of him before he died
[17:48] saying brother branham is jesus christ
[17:50] and he said right there he was on the
[17:52] board of trustees he's the one that he's
[17:54] one of the ones that kicked out brother
[17:55] neville from the live preaching they
[17:57] kicked out the pastor and they brought a
[17:58] pastor that would just press play
[18:00] now look he says they're both in the
[18:02] building this morning the antichrist and
[18:04] the true spirit of christ in the same
[18:06] building how are they known those who
[18:08] are true to the word of god amen
[18:12] those that will add to the word those
[18:13] that would uh take away from the word
[18:15] that's the cursed children
[18:18] but the true children of god take only
[18:20] god's word they only hear jesus's voice
[18:22] hallelujah
[18:24] that's right revelation or faith in his
[18:26] word makes no claims of knowledge the
[18:28] real christian have you got a doctor's
[18:30] degree makes no claims i believe his
[18:31] word see doesn't make any claims doesn't
[18:34] claim to be educated doesn't belong to
[18:36] any denomination any party any sect it
[18:38] belongs to christ it's his wife not a
[18:40] church wife she's a prostitute the bible
[18:42] said she's a and the mother of
[18:44] harlots and they all come together to
[18:45] make the same and that kind of
[18:47] woman is a woman that's untrue to her
[18:49] husband and claiming christ as her
[18:51] husband and belonging to denomination
[18:53] such nonsense you belong to christ
[18:56] hallelujah so what's our mission in the
[18:58] church age book remember i'm i'm going
[19:00] to get past these quotes i don't have
[19:02] too many quotes left
[19:03] remember this and let's not forget this
[19:05] church
[19:06] christ in the true church is a
[19:08] continuation of the book of acts
[19:11] but the book of revelation shows how
[19:12] that the antichrist spirit would come
[19:14] into the church and defile it making it
[19:16] luke warm formal and powerless
[19:19] it exposes satan revealing his works
[19:22] attempted destruction of god's people
[19:24] and the discrediting of god's word right
[19:26] down to the time he's cast in the lake
[19:28] of fire he fights that he cannot stand
[19:30] it he knows that if the people get the
[19:32] true revelation of the true of the true
[19:34] church and what she is and what she
[19:36] stands for and that she can do the
[19:38] greater works she will be an invincible
[19:40] army if they get a true revelation of
[19:42] the true spirits within the framework of
[19:44] the christian church and by god's spirit
[19:47] discern that's what simon preached on
[19:48] discernment by god's spirit discern and
[19:50] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[19:52] will be powerless before her
[19:55] oh hallelujah he will be as definitely
[19:57] thwarted today as when christ wishes his
[20:00] every effort to gain power over him in
[20:02] the desert yes satan hates revelation
[20:04] but we love it
[20:06] with true revelation in our lives the
[20:08] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[20:11] but we will prevail over them
[20:13] ah
[20:14] let's all shout amen can we amen
[20:16] hallelujah that's the power of
[20:19] revelation with revelation your life
[20:21] satan can come against you he'll come
[20:22] against you like a flood but he will not
[20:25] overcome you praise god
[20:27] you will rally you will rally where the
[20:29] standard is being waived the standard is
[20:31] the banner the flag when the enemy comes
[20:34] in you'll see where god's people are
[20:36] being united you'll see where christ is
[20:38] rallying us he's rattling us around the
[20:41] revealed word of today praise god
[20:43] and the answer is always get back to the
[20:45] word obey the word confess sins
[20:48] created me a clean heart oh god i said
[20:51] lord give me my first love amen let
[20:53] people see jesus in me hallelujah that's
[20:56] always the answer amen
[20:58] fellowship with god
[21:00] so we must discern the two spirits
[21:03] and withstand the evil spirit
[21:06] that's what the seven seals are all
[21:07] about now remember church brother
[21:08] francis he said don't forget this he
[21:10] said don't forget it
[21:13] remember all the days of your life
[21:18] these beasts are correct it's thus saith
[21:20] the lord
[21:22] that's quite a statement
[21:23] it's quite a statement
[21:25] because i have
[21:26] when i was reading charles tate's
[21:27] russell the founder of the jehovah's
[21:28] witness church he said that when those
[21:30] beasts went forth they were just like
[21:32] different things like love and judgment
[21:34] and just four anointings for like all
[21:36] christians for all time
[21:38] and then he said that those beasts even
[21:40] failed he said those beasts failed
[21:43] yeah i've i've have the quote of that i
[21:45] put that on the podcast
[21:46] he said the beast can fail
[21:48] but you see here we have a totally
[21:50] different a revelation from a prophet
[21:51] amen who sees up into heaven and sees
[21:54] those four beasts and he knows those
[21:57] those four beasts surround the throne of
[21:59] god they protect the throne of god they
[22:01] are god's throne guards amen in other
[22:03] words god always has protection god will
[22:06] always protect his people and who is
[22:08] going to defeat god's beast it's
[22:10] impossible those are god's powers those
[22:12] are god's choices those are god's
[22:14] anointings upon you and i the christian
[22:17] church has always been invincible amen
[22:19] in church we stand that way today as
[22:21] long as we stay with god's word as long
[22:24] as we stay under the anointing we will
[22:26] be invincible praise god
[22:28] i had an interview at school on friday
[22:29] and they said you talk fast so i'm
[22:31] saying i'm trying to talk slower here
[22:32] today about god's grace
[22:34] i was talking about the kids and this
[22:35] child in particular she's like you talk
[22:37] fast mr smith i'm like i better slow
[22:39] down
[22:41] this invisalign makes it harder too
[22:44] i better slow down
[22:46] let's look at the timing here i just get
[22:48] so excited i just want to say it all
[22:50] right now
[22:51] but let's look at the timing here i i
[22:53] preached this earlier this year so out
[22:55] of the seven seals the timing of the
[22:57] first seal was from when the holy ghost
[22:58] fell
[22:59] about 385
[23:01] a.d
[23:02] that's when the persecution really
[23:04] started
[23:06] church in the state
[23:07] second seal was the time persecution
[23:09] started to the dark ages started and
[23:10] this is these are rough dates
[23:12] uh the dark ages was about 1095 to 1906
[23:17] uh and then of course the eagle
[23:18] anointing was from uh brother graham's
[23:21] uh zeus's the holy ghost found azusa
[23:23] street the gifts and everything uh to
[23:26] present day
[23:27] that's the timing of the first four
[23:29] seals i just want you to see that
[23:32] the fifth seal of course is after the
[23:33] rapture
[23:34] because there's no beasts anymore you
[23:36] don't see any more beasts
[23:37] and we did that in the bible study i
[23:39] think last sunday night if i'm not
[23:40] mistaken we did the fifth seal bible
[23:41] study i'll send a good question on that
[23:43] one
[23:43] and then the sixth seal is the the last
[23:46] three and a half years of tribulation
[23:48] of daniel's 70 weeks that last half of
[23:50] the 70th week and then the seventh seal
[23:52] the timing of that is unknown it's the
[23:54] day and hour of the rapture
[23:56] praise god
[23:58] okay so let's break this down a little
[23:59] bit more here so with the first seal it
[24:02] lasts from the first church age to the
[24:04] middle of the third church age
[24:06] and this is the white horse anointing
[24:09] which is the antichrist spirit against
[24:11] the lion anointing and we'll look at
[24:13] these individually but i just want you
[24:14] to see the dates and broken down again
[24:16] so you had satan's spirit of deception
[24:20] against a powerful lying anointing of
[24:22] the holy ghost
[24:24] the boldness of a lie in the bible says
[24:26] in the book of proverbs
[24:28] the second seal was around 385 to the
[24:30] beginning of the church ages so from the
[24:32] middle of the third church age
[24:33] uh to finishing the fifth church age i'm
[24:36] sorry fourth church age rather and that
[24:38] was the red horse which is persecution
[24:40] and killing of saints
[24:41] versus the ox anointing
[24:45] okay and then the third seal was the
[24:46] dark ages
[24:48] uh and of course this is the end of the
[24:49] dark ages
[24:50] uh 1095 and of course this is this is
[24:53] during the fourth fifth and sixth church
[24:55] ages so this is the the third seal is
[24:57] the law the longest in time of years as
[25:00] far as in terms of years it's the
[25:02] longest
[25:03] uh time that a beast was combating
[25:06] a writer
[25:07] a horse rider and then the fourth seal
[25:09] was 1906 to the present it's just the
[25:11] seventh church age it's the pale pale
[25:14] horse which is death
[25:16] the antichrist spirit uh against our
[25:18] anointing the flying eagle anointing
[25:21] praise god
[25:23] okay so there's there's a visual of it
[25:25] uh here's a timeline of the church ages
[25:27] now here you have three forms of the
[25:28] seals i'm not going to spend much time
[25:29] on this because i already preached on
[25:30] this a few months ago john got the
[25:32] symbol form of the seven seals around 90
[25:34] a.d
[25:35] the reality form is what we're talking
[25:37] today so the the first seal the reality
[25:39] form lasted from 30 a.d to about 395 my
[25:42] dates a little off here should be over
[25:44] here
[25:45] so i grew my revelation of the seven
[25:47] seals my understanding of it uh the red
[25:50] horse would be during this time period
[25:53] the black horse was during these three
[25:55] church ages thirty years sardis in
[25:57] philadelphia and then uh the fourth
[26:00] horse rider and the fourth beast is in
[26:02] this last church age
[26:04] okay i have copies of these if you'd
[26:06] like them be happy to share them with
[26:07] you
[26:08] yeah and then the revelation form came
[26:10] in 1963 brother brown gave us the
[26:11] revelation of the seven seals now we
[26:13] know what they are
[26:15] all right
[26:16] now this was on the video sorry it's
[26:18] blurry i couldn't find this so i just
[26:19] had to do a screenshot of it this is
[26:21] another look at it so this is basically
[26:22] the see these colors back here white red
[26:25] black and pale so i just put them down
[26:27] here white red black and pale so you can
[26:29] see it now pale is actually a yellowish
[26:30] that's that's actually not the right
[26:32] color if you look it up in the greek
[26:33] it's a yellowish
[26:35] pale color okay so see the white horse
[26:37] rider rode uh into the third church age
[26:40] uh the red horse was third and fourth
[26:43] into the fourth and then the four the
[26:44] next black horse was next three church
[26:46] ages and then this last horse pale horse
[26:49] flying eagle was only in the seven
[26:51] church age
[26:53] okay so that's just like a a timeline of
[26:55] that praise god have i lost anybody
[26:58] hope i haven't lost anybody if so
[26:59] actually i got all these resources
[27:02] you can i want you to take them home i
[27:04] want you to study them i want you to
[27:05] pray i want you to see god i want you to
[27:07] enjoy them praise god
[27:09] now let's look at the first four seals
[27:10] we'll go in depth here now this is a
[27:11] much better picture of the four uh
[27:14] horse riders there's two applications
[27:17] these four horse riders is the the
[27:20] antichrist spirit riding throughout the
[27:21] last 2000 years but they also it's also
[27:24] satan's trick how to ride into someone's
[27:26] life
[27:28] or how to influence someone's life it's
[27:30] the same tactics you can't get away from
[27:32] that it's the same tactics because satan
[27:34] doesn't just like god don't change his
[27:36] ways satan doesn't change his ways
[27:37] either
[27:39] okay
[27:40] now before i do that though four is
[27:42] always the number of
[27:44] uh we always see four and i i just put
[27:46] it i put a whole section i got a whole
[27:48] page on the fours in the bible
[27:50] okay so you'll see how there's four
[27:51] horse riders there's four beasts that
[27:54] combat those four writers
[27:56] there's always four there's so uh and
[27:59] james one says there's four steps to
[28:00] spiritual corruption lust enticed lust
[28:04] conceived sin and then death
[28:07] praise god
[28:08] delilah
[28:10] deceived samson on the fourth attempt
[28:13] the first three he kind of lied to her
[28:16] the fourth one was the time that he got
[28:18] her
[28:19] i'm sorry that she got him sorry
[28:22] all right
[28:24] israel now it also works for the other
[28:26] way god restores jews by four steps also
[28:29] typing the four beasts
[28:30] uh in ezekiel 37 the dry bones vision
[28:34] the bones got sanu on them
[28:36] flesh
[28:38] skin and then they got the breath of god
[28:41] because because if satan attacks him for
[28:44] god restores him for
[28:46] hallelujah and those four uh
[28:48] beast anointings in heaven are the four
[28:50] anointings of the holy spirit
[28:53] jesus was the fourth man in the fire in
[28:55] daniel chapter three
[28:56] with the three hebrew children
[28:58] always 4
[29:00] israel was delivered from egypt in the
[29:03] fourth generation
[29:05] hallelujah
[29:09] job was delivered by the fourth friend
[29:12] not the first three
[29:14] elif eliphaz bildad and zofor but elihu
[29:18] allahu on the fourth one that brought
[29:21] the deliverance praise god
[29:23] hallelujah
[29:29] yes and then satan destroys through the
[29:31] four insects palmer worm locus
[29:34] cankerworm caterpillar
[29:36] that's in joel chapter one and two
[29:40] before the four steps everybody see that
[29:42] by god's grace
[29:43] this is a completely biblical concept
[29:46] totally biblical and only a prophet
[29:48] glory could point out all these fours
[29:50] and all these numbers and all these
[29:52] beasts all these symbols only a prophet
[29:55] who stood in the presence of the pillar
[29:56] of fire could tell us all these symbols
[29:59] all these dates and get it right praise
[30:01] god
[30:02] and it lines up exactly with everything
[30:04] in history and the word of god
[30:07] oh hallelujah thank god amen oh it's
[30:10] beautiful
[30:13] so let's look at the symbols we'll go
[30:14] kind of slow here and this is my same
[30:16] powerpoint from 2010 i just tried to
[30:18] make the words a little bigger
[30:21] and remember i like powerpoint sometimes
[30:23] because it gives you a visual i'm a
[30:24] visual learner like i took a test
[30:26] recently on that at school that
[30:27] everybody had to take a test i turned
[30:28] out to be a visual and audio auditorial
[30:30] learner that's what i turned out that's
[30:32] exactly what i am i like to listen to it
[30:34] i like to see it other people they got
[30:36] to like feel it they got to touch it you
[30:37] know they got to build it
[30:39] so the the first uh stage was the lion
[30:42] anointing of the holy ghost versus the
[30:44] satanic white horse rider
[30:47] now the lion beast these anointings were
[30:49] the anointings for the true church
[30:51] brother adam said this anointing was the
[30:52] living word it was word made manifest in
[30:55] the holy spirit he said now white for
[30:57] satan represents deception
[31:00] or innocence or false teaching or a
[31:03] false teaching ministry
[31:06] and of course a horse represents a
[31:07] spiritual power
[31:09] let's go to the book of job here real
[31:11] quick i'll just pull that out there that
[31:12] was such a blessing when i found that
[31:14] years actually preaching this series
[31:16] here i think it's job 20 something
[31:20] i know i find it in this bible because
[31:21] this was the bible i was using when i
[31:22] when the lord showed me that here
[31:25] a horse is a power
[31:29] if anybody finds it before that let me
[31:31] know
[31:46] there it is yep so job 39 sorry it took
[31:49] me a little longer to find that one
[31:51] thanks for your patience
[31:52] job 39 verse 19.
[31:55] hallelujah
[31:56] see all these symbols brother adam gives
[31:58] are absolutely scriptural praise god
[32:01] he now church did he read those yes he
[32:03] read uriah smith he admits it he read
[32:05] larkin
[32:06] he read charles takes russell but then
[32:09] the holy ghost would show him the truth
[32:10] they were just guessing they were just
[32:12] probing but brother adam got thus saith
[32:14] the lord on it praise god
[32:16] and those guys miss with us saith the
[32:18] lord
[32:19] did you know charles hayes russell and
[32:21] uriah smith constantly predicted the
[32:23] coming of the lord and they kept missing
[32:25] the dates
[32:27] and so right before they died they
[32:28] predicted another day he'd come back or
[32:30] another year and they missed that one
[32:31] too they always miss
[32:33] now see that's what i think i think
[32:35] brother man just got caught up in that
[32:36] that's why he said the 1977 thing but it
[32:39] was never thus saith the lord hallelujah
[32:41] church
[32:42] but see he was around he was influenced
[32:44] by that he saw that and then he saw
[32:45] these numbers remember the 50 jubilees
[32:47] he said oh my it works out to 1977. he's
[32:50] so he just said he said i'm not
[32:51] prophesying but it looks like it will be
[32:55] see because he was reading those men not
[32:57] church that's the truth for you and i
[32:58] whatever we read let me say like this
[33:00] whatever we watch that's what influences
[33:02] us
[33:06] and as humans we're all going to make
[33:07] mistakes sometimes we won't make a
[33:09] mistake with us say the lord because
[33:10] we're not prophets we will make those
[33:12] things lord statements but we got to be
[33:13] careful whatever we're reading whatever
[33:15] we're watching we've got to be careful
[33:16] it's going to influence us and we have
[33:18] to make sure we wait on the lord as we
[33:20] heard last sunday consult the lord first
[33:23] pray first ask god first and then speak
[33:25] after you hear from god
[33:28] consult god about it first
[33:33] okay so yeah job 39 19 hast thou given
[33:36] the horse strength hast thou clothed his
[33:38] neck with thunder
[33:40] can't thou make him afraid as a
[33:42] grasshopper of the glory of his nostrils
[33:44] is terrible
[33:46] he path in the valley and rejoices in
[33:48] his strength he goeth on to meet the
[33:50] armed men he mocketh that fear now look
[33:52] how powerful is
[33:53] oh a war horse laughs at fear
[33:58] and it's not a frighten you can't scare
[33:59] a war horse according to according to
[34:02] elahu
[34:04] neither turneth he back from the sword
[34:06] he'll run right into the sword
[34:09] the quiver wrath against him the
[34:10] glittering spear and the shield he
[34:12] swallowed the ground with fierceness and
[34:14] rage neither believeth he that is the
[34:17] sound of the trumpet
[34:19] he saith among the trumpets ha ha a
[34:22] horse laughs
[34:23] at trumpets
[34:25] and he smelled the battle far off and
[34:27] the thunder of the captains and the
[34:29] shouting is a horse of power
[34:31] absolutely
[34:33] now i wrote another one on here in my
[34:34] bible years and years ago let's read
[34:35] that one jeremiah 8 verse 6.
[34:37] that must be important if i wrote it in
[34:39] red in my bible
[34:41] jeremiah 8 verse 6.
[34:44] yeah there it is i hearkened and heard
[34:47] but they spake not a right no man
[34:48] repented him of his wickedness saying
[34:50] what have i done every one turn to his
[34:52] course as the horse rushest into the
[34:55] battle amen let's say amen can we amen
[34:58] so a horse is a power this is a satanic
[35:01] power though
[35:05] now i'm not going to read all this but
[35:06] let me read the colored words but the
[35:08] man says and watch the one that went to
[35:09] meet him the lion the lion of the tribe
[35:11] of judah which is the word when his
[35:12] false teaching went forth the true word
[35:14] went to meet him when the antichrist was
[35:17] writing with the false teaching god sent
[35:19] his teaching out the word the line of
[35:21] the tribe of judah which is the word
[35:22] made manifest in the holy spirit and the
[35:24] holy spirit there to manifest himself
[35:26] which is the word that's the reason the
[35:27] early church had healings and miracles
[35:29] and visions of power is because it is
[35:31] the living word in the form of the line
[35:33] of the tribe of judah riding out to
[35:35] combat that
[35:36] amen
[35:38] brother branham said now here's why
[35:40] here's why a lot of message people they
[35:41] attack
[35:42] the teaching ministry
[35:45] in fact a lot of message preachers they
[35:47] are against any teaching at all
[35:49] because they've been so scarred by false
[35:51] teachers
[35:52] one way i don't blame them but another
[35:54] way they've got to be able to discern
[35:57] those two spirits in the framework of
[35:58] the church
[35:59] but abraham said the first beast of god
[36:02] that went out to meet the antichrist was
[36:03] the antichrist spirit when it said it's
[36:05] just his teaching
[36:06] now remember when the antichrist first
[36:08] wrote he was in a teaching ministry the
[36:10] antichrist rode first in a teaching
[36:12] ministry
[36:14] that's why you know as i showed you a
[36:15] few weeks ago the most popular message
[36:17] preachers today they don't do teaching
[36:18] anymore
[36:20] uh because
[36:22] so there's been so many false teachers
[36:24] out there and doctrine sometimes can
[36:26] seem like a word they don't want to say
[36:29] but jesus said if you if you know god
[36:31] you'll do true doctrine
[36:33] if you know god's true doctrine it will
[36:35] actually show you god is with you that's
[36:36] what jesus says
[36:38] amen so we could name different teachers
[36:41] you know false teachers down through the
[36:42] years you know jeff jenkins uh we could
[36:44] name
[36:46] lee vale
[36:47] joseph coleman there's been a lot of
[36:49] false message teachers that have come
[36:51] out and i'm gonna i might preach a whole
[36:52] series on that i might just say a few
[36:54] there be that find it i might put that
[36:55] in there and show how people can fall
[36:57] away the ones that were closer to
[36:58] brother ram most of them fell away
[37:02] and why is that it's just like the
[37:03] solomon syndrome they stopped seeking
[37:05] the lord
[37:06] and when you stop seeking god and when
[37:08] you get content with your walk with god
[37:09] you are on the way down
[37:12] i'm on the any of us i'm on the way down
[37:14] any of us are on the way down when we
[37:16] stop seeking god we stop seeking this
[37:18] council we've got to constantly seek god
[37:20] amen as i said our father wants to spend
[37:22] time with us we got to talk to the
[37:24] father if we want to walk in the
[37:25] father's past we got to hear his voice
[37:27] amen
[37:28] and that's why these people around
[37:30] brother brown and who is satan attacking
[37:31] hardest the ones around the message of
[37:33] the hour
[37:34] that's why a lot of these guys turn out
[37:36] to be perverts
[37:38] adulterers fornicators homosexual
[37:42] kingdom builders
[37:45] money launderers
[37:47] they turned out to be that because satan
[37:49] is attacking them and if they don't
[37:51] withstand that they're going to be
[37:52] deceived by it by satan
[37:56] and that fits exactly these four horse
[37:58] riders
[37:59] they start with a false teaching
[38:02] right and then it becomes a war
[38:04] and then they start building their
[38:06] kingdom with money and then spiritual
[38:08] death is the last state
[38:10] i don't know i don't let me say this
[38:12] plainly because someone might
[38:12] misunderstand this i don't know their
[38:14] salvation that's up to them in god
[38:16] i know god is merciful and i know god is
[38:18] rich in mercy but many times as
[38:20] even nature shows the way a tree the way
[38:23] a tree leans is the way a tree falls
[38:27] hopefully they had some
[38:29] uh repentance at the end of their life
[38:30] like a thief on the cross hopefully they
[38:32] had some repentance on their deathbed
[38:34] that's all we can say
[38:35] but see that's why people today are
[38:36] against teaching because we've had so
[38:37] many false teachers but that doesn't
[38:39] take away the fact that there's five
[38:41] five teaching gifts and you need all
[38:43] five praise god you need all five if
[38:46] you're going to be uh brought into the
[38:48] full stature of jesus christ
[38:51] hallelujah thank god
[38:53] so the symbols he who is he he's the
[38:56] antichrist spirit he kills by the spirit
[38:59] of spiritual kill with false teaching
[39:01] his what's his bow the bible said he has
[39:03] a bow
[39:04] his bow is his tongue that's used for
[39:07] lies his lies are the arrows that he
[39:09] shot out
[39:11] and the fact it has no arrows uh so
[39:14] brother man says he's a bluffer he has a
[39:16] lot of thunder but no lightning
[39:19] but christ had a sword go out of his
[39:21] mouth amen hallelujah praise god amen
[39:24] thank god
[39:26] there's a great difference
[39:27] in church if you listen to 1960 1961 i
[39:30] think it's the the ten
[39:31] the ten virgins and the hundred forty
[39:32] four thousand
[39:34] and listen to uh revelation uh
[39:36] the revelation series brother random
[39:38] actually calls
[39:39] the revelation six white horse rider the
[39:41] holy spirit
[39:44] he actually thought it was the holy
[39:45] spirit but then three years later the
[39:47] holy spirit came in the room and said
[39:48] it's not me it's the antichrist
[39:51] and he says when he preaches the first
[39:53] seal he said i would have made an awful
[39:55] mistake if it wasn't for about noon
[39:57] today when the holy spirit swept through
[39:59] the room amen
[40:01] and corrected me on the mistake i was
[40:03] fixing to say hallelujah
[40:05] he said i was going to just going to
[40:06] take it from a previous text that i
[40:07] already preached
[40:10] so who rescued brother brandon from a
[40:11] false doctrine the holy spirit
[40:14] who's going to rescue you out of any
[40:15] false any false doctrines or any of your
[40:18] lust of the flesh or lust of the eyes or
[40:19] pride of life who's going to rescue you
[40:21] the holy spirit amen
[40:23] glory but you gotta let him sleep sweep
[40:25] into your room amen you got to spend
[40:27] time with him and he'll sweep into your
[40:28] room hallelujah
[40:30] i believe he'll sweep in the surface as
[40:31] well but what i'm saying is many times
[40:33] when we're in those battles it's when
[40:34] we're not here
[40:37] it's when we're at home we're going
[40:38] through tough battles
[40:39] that's what i'm saying
[40:41] that's what i'm saying we got to
[40:42] constantly seek the face of god
[40:46] like i heard that brother say it
[40:47] the brother from louisiana preached a
[40:49] good sermon i listened to it it was good
[40:50] he said we are secure but we must always
[40:52] be seeking
[40:54] we're secure but seeking that's my
[40:56] testimony
[40:58] i'm secure in my salvation i know jesus
[41:00] save me from the life of sin i know he
[41:02] filled me with the holy ghost praise god
[41:03] i see power in my life i'm a witness of
[41:06] jesus christ but i must keep seeking
[41:08] jesus christ or else i get tired and
[41:10] lazy
[41:11] i get tempted by the things of the world
[41:13] just like any other person because i'm
[41:15] human i got a dual nature disorder
[41:17] praise god right i said it on wednesday
[41:19] i gotta do not do personalities i've got
[41:21] dual natures amen
[41:23] i've got a white dog holy i got a black
[41:25] dog unholy and i gotta make sure i feed
[41:27] that white dog amen
[41:29] hallelujah
[41:31] and then i stay strong and then when the
[41:33] enemy comes in then i rally to the flag
[41:35] i rally with the saints i rally with
[41:37] jesus i rally with the believers but if
[41:39] not i'll be tempted and i'll fall short
[41:41] of god's glory
[41:43] just like you
[41:44] just like all of us
[41:48] see we got to be secure but seeking
[41:51] in other words like jesus said he that
[41:53] hungers and thirsts after righteousness
[41:54] will be filled in his human mind now i'm
[41:57] adding that because that that's the
[41:58] revelation you got to get filled in your
[42:00] in your soul yes but each day we've got
[42:02] to keep hungering and thirsting for
[42:03] righteousness
[42:06] glory
[42:10] so
[42:10] so here's the symbol he had a bow the
[42:13] antichrist had a bow and the bible said
[42:15] they'd bend their tongues like their bow
[42:17] for lies
[42:19] so the tongue the i'm sorry so the bow
[42:21] the antichrist had it was his lying
[42:23] tongue
[42:24] where they call a snake a fork tongue no
[42:26] no they call that
[42:27] that's what he had
[42:29] but they are not valiant for the truth
[42:31] upon the earth
[42:32] so the antichrist will not stand up for
[42:34] the full truth the antichrist will
[42:36] inject some false doctrine
[42:39] and they know not me saith the lord they
[42:41] don't know christ
[42:43] and christ is the word
[42:46] but see a sword comes out of christ's
[42:48] mouth amen
[42:49] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[42:51] sword that with it he should smite the
[42:53] nations now look he's given these
[42:54] nations thousands of years to repent
[42:56] thou two thousand years to repent and
[42:58] finally at armageddon he said i've had
[42:59] enough repentance now comes judgment you
[43:01] had time to repent and the sad part was
[43:04] satan deceived all those nations to
[43:06] rally against the king of kings and lord
[43:08] of lords thank god he rescued you out of
[43:10] that thank god jesus rescued out of that
[43:12] and you're not with that army but you're
[43:14] a part of that white robe that white
[43:16] horse heavenly army hallelujah thank god
[43:19] that he rescued us amen from the lies of
[43:22] this world and he's brought us to the
[43:24] truth of the revelation of the holy
[43:26] spirit
[43:30] abraham said the writer has no arrows
[43:32] for his bow did you notice he had a bow
[43:34] but there's nothing said about having
[43:35] any arrows so he must be a bluffer
[43:37] see he doesn't speak the truth
[43:38] he lies
[43:40] satan always lies maybe he's got a lot
[43:42] of thunder no lightning but you find
[43:43] christ had both thunder and lightning
[43:45] for out of his mouth goes a sharp
[43:48] two-edged sword and he smites the
[43:49] nations but this guy god can't smite
[43:52] anything he's playing the part of a
[43:53] hypocrite
[43:54] so he's a false teacher at the beginning
[43:57] that's what we got to be careful you
[43:58] know with teaching i got to be careful
[43:59] teaching but man said teach he said oh i
[44:01] just love teaching he said teaching he
[44:04] says gives the church the foundation and
[44:06] he said teaching positionally places
[44:09] them so they know where they're standing
[44:11] but he said the teacher is on thin ice
[44:14] and he's got to be careful
[44:16] he's i so i've got to be careful when i
[44:18] do teach this morning i'm teaching
[44:20] kind of like reviewing the teaching
[44:21] right
[44:22] i'm not teaching anything new
[44:24] i've got to be careful i'm being nice
[44:25] because if you go so far in teaching you
[44:27] can mistake something
[44:29] and then what you've done remember
[44:30] teaching is instruction then you've
[44:31] instructed the people how to sin
[44:35] are you with me
[44:36] that's why teaching is always thin ice
[44:39] that's why if you have any questions
[44:41] please raise your hand at our sunday
[44:42] night meetings
[44:43] i don't want to i don't want to i don't
[44:44] want to influence anybody wrong i want
[44:46] to influence people to the holy
[44:48] spirit i want to be right praise god
[44:51] how many want to be right
[44:55] so a crowd was given to this writer a
[44:57] crown was given to that white horse
[44:58] rider
[45:00] and brother adam said that's the literal
[45:01] crown that was given to the writer after
[45:03] he became incarnate in the pope or the
[45:05] false prophet
[45:07] right around 3 8 right around the 300s
[45:09] i've read the name of the first pope i
[45:10] think i want to say damascus
[45:13] it's in my book uh
[45:15] i'm not mistaken damascus was the first
[45:17] pope
[45:19] now that the catholic church says peter
[45:21] now we know peter was notebook
[45:23] peter had a wife
[45:25] uh popes don't have wives
[45:28] because
[45:29] they're a false doctrine
[45:32] i believe it was damascus what i'm
[45:33] mistaken now notice this this white
[45:35] horse conquers
[45:37] and that's what exactly what jesus said
[45:39] they he uses nicolaitism to conquer the
[45:42] laity now church this is where you got
[45:44] to do your part i've got to come
[45:46] anointed to church but you've got to
[45:48] come anointed the church
[45:50] satan's whole desire is to make you
[45:51] think oh you have to come to church
[45:53] anointed god don't want to use you today
[45:55] it's okay to be tired every every
[45:57] service
[45:59] i'm tired today but i'm not tired of
[46:00] every service
[46:02] i definitely wasn't tired on wednesday
[46:03] night by god's grace
[46:04] we had a good time in the lord once a
[46:06] day
[46:07] always preaching over again you know
[46:09] get under the anointing
[46:12] that is satan's trick he wants to make
[46:13] you think you have no part in the
[46:15] service but your part is just as
[46:16] important as mine
[46:19] musicians just as important as me
[46:21] each one of you
[46:23] just as important
[46:25] and god cannot accomplish as much as he
[46:28] could if we're not all in the holy
[46:30] spirit
[46:31] that's the first trick of the holy
[46:33] spirit is nicoletism conquer the how can
[46:35] i get the people to stop
[46:37] desiring the anointing of the holy
[46:38] spirit that's why you got to seek it at
[46:39] home
[46:41] that's why you got to become an expert
[46:42] can i say like that you've got to become
[46:44] a spiritual expert in the things of god
[46:46] hallelujah
[46:48] you've got to
[46:49] you're also going to become an expert in
[46:50] something else you don't want to become
[46:52] an expert in the ways of the world
[46:56] i always hope i always hope i'm not an
[46:58] expert in the latest most famous movies
[47:01] and musicians and video games i love
[47:03] when the kids say i have some new kids
[47:05] coming this year you know oh mr smith
[47:07] did you see this i'm like i don't even
[47:08] know that
[47:09] i'm not gonna watch that i don't know
[47:11] what it is i like to praise god amen
[47:14] i'm not an expert in disney praise god
[47:16] i'm not an expert in minecraft what's
[47:18] another one they do
[47:20] fortnite yes oh my goodness i'm not an
[47:22] expert in fortnite have you played a mr
[47:23] president no i haven't and i don't let
[47:25] my children play it either
[47:29] i don't want to be an expert in worldly
[47:31] things i want to be an expert in
[47:33] spiritual things amen
[47:35] and not self-proclaimed but just i want
[47:37] to be mature the bible calls that's the
[47:38] word stature the stature of a perfect
[47:40] man that means the maturity of a perfect
[47:42] man
[47:43] that's what the word means in the greek
[47:44] the maturity of a complete man or woman
[47:48] we want to be mature we want to be
[47:50] mature spiritual people
[47:53] honor your expert on the seals glory so
[47:55] nobody can deceive me amen that's why i
[47:56] told emma in the house last night that's
[47:58] what my dad told me that's the greatest
[48:00] advice i ever had know jesus christ so
[48:02] well no man or no woman can deceive you
[48:05] no church can deceive you no false
[48:07] prophet can deceive you no devil and
[48:09] hell can deceive you because you've met
[48:11] jesus and you know him hallelujah
[48:13] amen
[48:15] hallelujah i'm feeling good i'm not
[48:17] tired anymore sir
[48:20] that satan's first trick is to conquer
[48:22] the people
[48:24] so they only look to the preacher as
[48:25] long as he's anointed then we had a good
[48:26] servant no you got to be anointed too
[48:28] praise god
[48:30] like we're going to get to sister
[48:30] naomi's testimony in different ones and
[48:33] that's when we need everyone's anointing
[48:34] when there's needs in the church and
[48:36] that's a blessing other people are
[48:38] anointed to pray i can't pray down every
[48:39] blessing from heaven i get tired i get i
[48:42] get in the flesh i
[48:44] i'm just one person praise god
[48:47] we've all got to have a leading of the
[48:48] holy spirit we've all got to be feel led
[48:51] well god is leading me to do this god's
[48:53] leading me to say that
[48:54] they that are led by the spirit of god
[48:56] are the sons of god
[48:58] glory
[49:02] now here's the good thing bro simon
[49:03] brought up because i i forgot the three
[49:05] last week's sister emma she's probably
[49:06] heard it a hundred times
[49:08] which is good
[49:09] um last week simon said the decent
[49:11] nickelodeon's had three parts and i was
[49:13] like i forgot that
[49:14] i'm going to go ask him what it was
[49:17] because i forgot
[49:19] in the first church day jesus said this
[49:21] thou
[49:22] hast
[49:23] that thou hatest the deeds of nicolaians
[49:26] which i also hate
[49:28] and so the deeds of nicolaitans was
[49:30] first to group the church into different
[49:32] groups so preachers and everybody else
[49:38] well you can't fellowship with us
[49:40] because you know we're preachers
[49:43] i'm kind of glad there's only one
[49:44] preacher in our church at least at least
[49:45] right now
[49:47] nobody could just you don't fellowship
[49:48] with anybody you know the only
[49:50] fellowships with the preachers
[49:51] i want to fellowship with everybody
[49:53] but that look look at the look at the
[49:55] catholic church that's what they did
[49:56] right they got priests and they got
[49:57] everybody else
[50:00] rankings
[50:02] right like brother brooks his sermon
[50:03] from michigan a few weeks ago
[50:05] he said he said the spirit of nicolaims
[50:07] was working around him he said one
[50:09] preacher come up to him and said hey
[50:10] brother brooks did you did you hear
[50:12] you're in the top 10 best preachers in
[50:13] the message
[50:15] so someone out there i don't know who it
[50:16] is but someone is so carnal they're
[50:18] actually ranking the preachers
[50:21] about who's the best preachers i don't
[50:23] know who it is it's probably a small
[50:24] group because i haven't heard it you
[50:25] know it's probably just some frustum way
[50:26] off our group
[50:28] but that's the spirit of satan
[50:30] right to rank
[50:31] oh he's better she's better
[50:34] you know you're not as good she's not as
[50:36] good he's not as good that's the spirit
[50:38] of satan
[50:41] and then the third attribute is
[50:42] authority beyond the local assembly
[50:46] right and you see that all the time with
[50:47] mega churches they call campuses
[50:50] we're a mega church but we've got eight
[50:52] other
[50:52] campuses right
[50:54] and then the personality he's usually a
[50:56] big strong guy or a handsome guy or
[50:58] talks really smooth or something like
[51:00] that
[51:00] usually smooth and real positive you
[51:02] know
[51:03] i probably know what i'm talking about
[51:05] but they have all these
[51:06] they have all these campuses
[51:08] and they have authority over more than
[51:10] one congregation
[51:11] and that's wrong
[51:12] nobody has that only a pastor has
[51:14] authority over a local congregation
[51:17] so that's kingdom building
[51:19] that's what satan does
[51:22] see because what we do in akron may be
[51:24] different than napoleon
[51:27] what we do in akron maybe look different
[51:29] than
[51:30] sheffield or or michigan
[51:33] because god has a different assignment
[51:35] for each one of us
[51:38] now we can learn from other churches but
[51:39] we don't have to copy them word for word
[51:42] or event for event
[51:49] so there's three attributes
[51:51] so group oh well i'm not a preacher
[51:53] i'm not a song leader i'm not a deacon i
[51:55] must have i must have no anointing for
[51:57] the service well you put yourself in the
[51:59] wrong group because we're all in the
[52:00] same group together we all got the holy
[52:02] ghost we all got the anointing but god
[52:04] can use all of our prayers
[52:06] that's right
[52:08] let's not rank one another
[52:10] and of course this one deals with me
[52:12] authority beyond the local
[52:14] now here's where brother adam says it in
[52:15] chapter 10
[52:17] um nicolet as a doctrine he said the
[52:20] separation the clergy from the lady grew
[52:21] from the biblical truth of the elders
[52:24] shepherds ruling the flock by the words
[52:26] of the deeds of nicoletanes wherein the
[52:27] clergy set themselves in ranks one over
[52:30] the other
[52:31] to the clergy the preachers which
[52:33] unscriptural formula then evolved into a
[52:35] priesthood that placed the clergy
[52:36] between man and god giving the clergy
[52:38] certain rights all the while denying the
[52:40] lady their god-given rights
[52:43] like you see in their in their
[52:44] confessional boxes like simon showed
[52:46] a person a senator
[52:48] someone who sinned doesn't have to go
[52:49] tell a priest
[52:51] you can go right to jesus
[52:54] the roman priest isn't your mediator
[52:56] jesus is your mediator
[52:58] now if you want to come tell me the
[53:00] bible says sometimes you got to confess
[53:01] your sins and you know to others that
[53:02] might make you feel good you can tell me
[53:04] but you don't have to tell me in the
[53:05] line you have to tell simon you have to
[53:06] tell anybody
[53:07] your sin in particular unless you want
[53:08] to
[53:10] but it's mandated there we went to that
[53:11] church buoy and we went to that church
[53:13] those catholic church and they talked
[53:14] about well make sure you get here on
[53:16] saturday for confession it's from three
[53:18] to four that's the last place i'm gonna
[53:20] talk to somebody who's in there
[53:21] about my problems
[53:25] that priest got a lot more problems than
[53:26] what i got
[53:29] he's trusting the bread and blood's got
[53:31] literal life in it no sir
[53:33] no sir he thinks he's got to talk to god
[53:35] holding these beads i don't need beads i
[53:37] don't need bread i don't need wine i
[53:39] need one thing i need a sincere heart
[53:41] praise god i say this i need one else
[53:43] thing i need faith in the son of god
[53:45] amen
[53:46] hallelujah he's my mediator not a man
[53:52] see denying the laity your god-given
[53:54] rights see sisters like i said as
[53:56] preachers before sisters you have their
[53:57] god-given right to all nine gifts in the
[53:59] holy spirit
[54:03] right
[54:04] every god-given right the nine gifts of
[54:06] the holy spirit that includes
[54:08] word of knowledge and word of wisdom
[54:11] a woman a sister who's got the holy
[54:12] ghost can give wisdom to another man
[54:16] and tell him this is what you do and
[54:18] this is when you do it
[54:20] and the church said
[54:22] that's always a hard one for us not our
[54:24] church but that's other message here
[54:26] that's a hard one oh a woman's going to
[54:27] tell me what to do that's a chauvinistic
[54:29] prideful attitude
[54:32] my goodness
[54:36] and that's what satan gets people on you
[54:38] know that's what he gets them in you
[54:39] know pushing down the women you know and
[54:41] uh men ruling with the wrong spirit
[54:44] they're there to rule by the word but
[54:46] not by chauvinism and pride and
[54:48] arrogance that's not how we roll we rule
[54:50] by the word
[54:52] and then we allow the sisters to operate
[54:54] in all nine gifts of the holy spirit
[54:55] thank god thank god
[55:00] this was a serbation in the age it
[55:02] became a doctrine how many do it on time
[55:04] okay then it was established in the
[55:06] church as assured word of god which
[55:08] indeed it was not
[55:10] so see the brotherhood gives the example
[55:12] of today we have priests and laity in
[55:14] the roman catholic church it wasn't
[55:16] always that way
[55:17] it evolved into that
[55:20] now what's it going to evolve to in the
[55:21] message if you know we are well actually
[55:23] we already evolved into the message
[55:25] preachers have all the anointing
[55:27] it's basically the same thing in many
[55:29] messed churches preachers have become
[55:31] the priests
[55:33] and you've got to go through the
[55:34] preacher
[55:35] you've got to confess to the preacher
[55:36] you don't have to confess to me
[55:38] the bible says if you confess your sins
[55:40] and you mean it
[55:42] jesus is faithful and just to forgive
[55:44] you and cleanse you of all
[55:45] unrighteousness
[55:47] you only got to tell me if you want to
[55:48] you have to tell me i don't know i don't
[55:50] have to know sometimes i don't want to
[55:51] know you wouldn't want to know my
[55:53] battles like i love that donnie reagan
[55:55] quote if if god allowed all of our evil
[55:57] thoughts to be placed up on the screen
[55:59] here we'd all we'd all leave in about 30
[56:01] seconds
[56:03] there'd be no one here for church
[56:06] brother jesse thought that about me
[56:08] brother sister kristen said that or
[56:10] thought that or brother william thought
[56:12] that about so-and-so
[56:16] i thought that was a really wise thing
[56:17] to say
[56:18] see because we're trusting in the blood
[56:20] of jesus christ
[56:22] i've got two and eight two natures i'm
[56:23] battling with one i love and one i hate
[56:26] but then my flesh loves it you know but
[56:28] my flesh is enmity against the holy
[56:29] spirit praise god
[56:32] ah
[56:36] see it works like that even though we
[56:38] don't call me a messenger church as
[56:40] catholic churches if it's not careful
[56:42] the deeds of nickelodeon gets in there
[56:44] and then it sets oh the priests are so
[56:45] much more high so much more holy
[56:48] now there is this idea why the in the
[56:50] old testament the people would run to
[56:52] the prophets that's because they had
[56:53] gifts they could hear from god but not
[56:56] every new testament preacher is a
[56:57] prophet
[57:01] right now let me say like this i think i
[57:03] was telling this to amen last week
[57:05] if certain people we know have gifts in
[57:06] the church it's okay to go to them pray
[57:09] first
[57:10] pray first i need i need some more amens
[57:13] on that pray first
[57:14] ah that's it
[57:16] in other words talk to god first
[57:18] because you don't want to bother that
[57:19] person it might not be the will of god
[57:21] for you to ask that person
[57:22] but you want to pray first
[57:25] and then go to that person say brother
[57:26] or sister could you pray about this i've
[57:28] seen in the past you know god's spoken
[57:29] to you with wisdom or knowledge or god's
[57:31] heard your prayers you've had faith
[57:33] these certain times and i know god has
[57:35] used your gift of faith
[57:37] situation now that's really humble
[57:39] praise god
[57:40] that's recognizing it's just not all
[57:42] through the preachers the holy ghost is
[57:43] in every person
[57:45] every person has a gift of the holy
[57:46] ghost
[57:51] now in my book i gave some real life
[57:53] examples of the deeds of the nicolaitans
[57:56] that happened in the early church
[57:58] and this is where we're going to get
[57:59] into some
[58:00] some
[58:02] differences of opinion maybe with other
[58:03] churches
[58:04] beginning in 41 a.d this is 11 years
[58:07] after the holy ghost fell
[58:09] the first church of rome slowly and
[58:11] consistently added pagan deeds into
[58:12] their worship until they rejected the
[58:14] traditional holy passover observance
[58:16] because remember most of them were jews
[58:17] at that time most christians were jews
[58:19] when the holy ghost first fell fully
[58:22] embracing the pagan easter feast of
[58:24] ishtar when polycarp arrived around 150
[58:27] a.d
[58:30] the faithful bishop also detested their
[58:31] wicked deeds of idolizing statues
[58:34] and eucharist worship so where did satan
[58:36] work first in the church of rome in
[58:38] their holiday celebrations
[58:40] we got halloween coming up oh it's the
[58:42] worst time of the year for
[58:44] right so we hate going to the stores
[58:47] we hate going driving by all those
[58:49] skeleton signs that they got outside in
[58:50] their yards
[58:52] i don't like this time of year
[58:56] you got christmas easter
[58:58] all these holidays what does satan do
[59:01] look he attacks you on your day
[59:02] off holiday's a day off
[59:05] holy day
[59:06] instead of making it holy he makes it
[59:08] unholy
[59:10] what was his first this is not what
[59:11] rather this is what i could find brother
[59:12] william in the history the history books
[59:14] that i read i read two books why did it
[59:16] happen uh that's that woman rachel has
[59:19] the time and then i read uh
[59:21] edward i forget his last name but he's a
[59:23] good historian
[59:25] edward i can't remember his last name
[59:26] it's in my office here
[59:27] and the first signs of
[59:30] these and nicoletanes was with our
[59:32] holidays
[59:33] okay
[59:35] and so satan perverted their holiday
[59:37] celebrations
[59:40] okay
[59:41] and then now but by 150 a.d they had
[59:44] literal statues of peter polycarp said
[59:46] he walked in and he just sat down on the
[59:48] pew the history says and he saw each
[59:51] person walk in and bow down to the
[59:53] statue of peter before they would go
[59:54] take eucharist
[59:56] in the first church of rome it used to
[59:58] be a holy ghost-filled church but what
[1:00:00] happened all the holy ghost-filled
[1:00:01] saints left because they're false
[1:00:02] doctrines
[1:00:04] holy ghost-filled people will not stay
[1:00:06] in a church with false doctrine amen
[1:00:09] the man said they can't stay in those
[1:00:11] cold informal lukewarm churches they got
[1:00:14] to go a place where it's hot hallelujah
[1:00:17] where they feel the flame of god the
[1:00:19] fire of god how do you burn away their
[1:00:21] lustful thoughts and their lustful
[1:00:23] desires their lustful deeds and their
[1:00:24] selfishness it burns away all their
[1:00:27] sinful loss amen
[1:00:29] hallelujah
[1:00:31] but that's why christmas is a big debate
[1:00:33] among some people right
[1:00:35] or christmas is the main one that i can
[1:00:37] think of easter is some for some people
[1:00:41] but see satan likes to get into
[1:00:43] holidays
[1:00:44] and as i said before but if god brother
[1:00:46] may have a christmas tree well it must
[1:00:48] not have been a sin for him
[1:00:50] but other people can worship a christmas
[1:00:52] tree
[1:00:53] and those are usually the rich people in
[1:00:55] the church
[1:00:57] usually
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:01] yeah because they got all the money they
[1:01:02] can decorate the tree they can buy the
[1:01:04] fancy as gifts so they're the ones who
[1:01:06] are easily most easily
[1:01:07] deceived into commercialism
[1:01:11] now me when i read jeremiah 10 i just
[1:01:13] can't do a christmas tree at my house
[1:01:16] i just can't do it
[1:01:18] if you want to do i'll say like this you
[1:01:19] want to do a christmas tree let's do it
[1:01:20] scripturally was jesus tree yes was the
[1:01:23] tree cut down yes jesus was crucified
[1:01:25] but when he rose what he looked like did
[1:01:26] he have gold and silver all over him he
[1:01:28] was white robed
[1:01:31] if you want to do it right put white all
[1:01:33] over your christmas tree
[1:01:35] okay
[1:01:40] right
[1:01:40] don't put reindeer on the christmas tree
[1:01:44] reindeer have nothing to do with
[1:01:45] salvation
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:48] if you want to put a sash across that
[1:01:50] christmas tree like revelation chapter
[1:01:52] one go ahead
[1:01:53] he was gird gird about with the loins
[1:01:55] with i'm sorry gird about his paps
[1:01:58] with a sash
[1:01:59] you can put a golden sash across it
[1:02:02] see i just can't do that
[1:02:04] i just can't do that
[1:02:06] but see we got to be careful on our our
[1:02:08] days off or in other words the areas of
[1:02:10] liberty we got to be careful satan
[1:02:11] doesn't start there and pervert our our
[1:02:13] experience with god
[1:02:15] there's nothing wrong with giving a gift
[1:02:16] to a person
[1:02:17] just don't feel pressure i got to give
[1:02:19] one back that's when it gets wrong
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:22] they give it because they want to give
[1:02:23] it if they're giving you a gift just to
[1:02:25] get a gift back give them the gift back
[1:02:28] say no thanks
[1:02:30] i can't afford it this year
[1:02:34] you know just
[1:02:35] give it back i'll say no thanks i'm not
[1:02:37] celebrating christmas this year
[1:02:40] but nothing's wrong with me wanting to
[1:02:41] give my children gifts and reminding
[1:02:43] them remember god gave us the greatest
[1:02:45] gift there ever was his holy son and
[1:02:47] that holy son grew up and died and
[1:02:49] became the lamb of god who took away
[1:02:51] your sin amen
[1:02:52] nothing's wrong with that brother ma'am
[1:02:54] thank up until the very last sermons
[1:02:57] brother man was constantly thanking
[1:02:58] people for all the christmas gifts
[1:03:00] listen dude i've listened to the last
[1:03:01] three or four sermons this last few
[1:03:02] weeks he's constantly thanking people
[1:03:04] thank you for the christmas gift merry
[1:03:06] christmas
[1:03:07] thank you there's a way you can do it
[1:03:08] without getting into sin
[1:03:12] so what they changed first holidays and
[1:03:14] they put statues now that hopefully that
[1:03:16] would never be us
[1:03:17] i know that'll never be us but you know
[1:03:19] in generations people may put statues
[1:03:22] uh in the churches
[1:03:24] i was just looking over there because i
[1:03:25] was thinking about
[1:03:26] some people some people idolized the
[1:03:27] pillar of fire picture by the brand you
[1:03:29] know they you've seen pictures of it
[1:03:31] they just idolized it's like a statue
[1:03:33] it's like an idol to them
[1:03:34] so we have those two
[1:03:36] holy days
[1:03:38] let's tell them what i'm sorry statues
[1:03:40] yeah statues oh yeah eucharist so
[1:03:42] there's communion
[1:03:45] and next was the changing of water
[1:03:47] baptism now thank god we got the right
[1:03:48] water baptism
[1:03:50] but there's only one baptism
[1:03:52] but they change the baptism they remove
[1:03:55] lord jesus christ and put father son
[1:03:57] holy ghost
[1:03:59] and then they added the deed of pouring
[1:04:01] water or sprinkling instead of full
[1:04:03] immersion
[1:04:06] okay so they got to baptism there's four
[1:04:08] things they change right there so these
[1:04:10] are examples of deeds or a preacher well
[1:04:12] i'm gonna be pastor of a couple churches
[1:04:14] now okay so is that okay if i'm the
[1:04:16] pastor of a couple of churches now yeah
[1:04:19] well you know we're preachers we're more
[1:04:20] holy than you so
[1:04:22] we're gonna go seek god together and
[1:04:24] know no brothers and sisters you can't
[1:04:26] join us because we're more holy
[1:04:29] nothing
[1:04:30] or you know i'm i'm top five preacher no
[1:04:32] i just i reached number five i moved up
[1:04:33] from number seven
[1:04:35] this preacher preached something wrong
[1:04:36] so that moved me up to number five this
[1:04:37] week
[1:04:40] ridiculous
[1:04:41] the devil also
[1:04:43] conquered the people by the deed of
[1:04:45] exalting the clergy above the laity
[1:04:47] clergy men were given more power than
[1:04:50] allotted by god ignatius who died early
[1:04:52] in the second century erd by giving to
[1:04:55] the bishop a prominent prominence and
[1:04:57] authority not only unknown in the new
[1:04:58] testament but also what was claimed by
[1:05:00] clement
[1:05:02] okay and there's something i left out
[1:05:04] there
[1:05:07] children's baptism or baby infant
[1:05:09] baptism i left that i thought
[1:05:11] is anyone see infant baptism in there
[1:05:13] okay i must have missed it
[1:05:15] spread yesterday that must be it i
[1:05:16] thought i put infant baptism in there so
[1:05:18] i have to go check it out it must be
[1:05:20] somewhere else in the book now notice uh
[1:05:22] the white horse rider was crowned now i
[1:05:24] don't know if this is the real crown i
[1:05:25] found this back in 2010 online i can't
[1:05:28] find it well i haven't searched for it
[1:05:29] since then here's the website so i need
[1:05:31] to go look that up but apparently these
[1:05:34] this this is a crown of a pope i don't
[1:05:36] know this could be all made up i don't
[1:05:37] know
[1:05:39] but apparently these words mean the
[1:05:41] infallible vicar of jesus christ the
[1:05:43] supreme governor of the world of earth
[1:05:44] the father of nations and kings so
[1:05:47] apparently this is uh pope pius xi tiara
[1:05:51] or crowd
[1:05:53] now of course the crown was given to him
[1:05:54] earlier you know the earlier pope but
[1:05:56] this is an example of some crown
[1:05:58] apparently that belonged to pope pius xi
[1:06:01] apparently
[1:06:03] i don't know but it sure looks like a
[1:06:04] catholic relic doesn't it
[1:06:07] and and that this is basically what they
[1:06:08] do they make the pope
[1:06:10] infallible when he's speaking from
[1:06:11] peter's basilica
[1:06:13] that's right there in their in their
[1:06:14] catechism he's infallible when he sits
[1:06:16] on peter's seat whatever he reads off
[1:06:17] the paper there
[1:06:20] okay so now we're ready for the second
[1:06:22] scene okay
[1:06:23] i i don't know how far we'd get today i
[1:06:25] didn't really want to start another
[1:06:26] series and have to finish it later
[1:06:28] hopefully i'll finish the trinitarian or
[1:06:29] the trinity one on uh wednesday night
[1:06:31] how the train is wrong
[1:06:32] okay the second seal is the ox
[1:06:35] anointing for believers
[1:06:37] ox is a beast of sacrifice and these
[1:06:38] saints gave their lives just as freely
[1:06:41] as they could give them
[1:06:42] the red represents bloody red
[1:06:45] the catholic church waded through the
[1:06:46] blood of everyone that disagreed with
[1:06:48] him
[1:06:49] that's absolutely historical
[1:06:51] of course a horse has a spiritual power
[1:06:54] power was given in the second seal power
[1:06:55] is given to the red horse rider to take
[1:06:57] peace from the earth and they should
[1:06:58] kill one another
[1:07:00] so this brother says this is the unity
[1:07:02] of the church catholic church and the
[1:07:04] state the roman government
[1:07:06] and they're given granting power
[1:07:08] eventually leads to the crusades
[1:07:10] inquisitions and other wars of conquest
[1:07:13] in the roman catholic church
[1:07:15] well and then the bible said a great
[1:07:16] sword was given to the red horse rider
[1:07:18] what is that it's the murdering of over
[1:07:20] 68 million protestants over that
[1:07:23] uh from the time of saint augustine of
[1:07:25] hippo until 1586.
[1:07:28] because the bible said he killed by the
[1:07:29] sword brother ram said he killed by
[1:07:31] political power when the church and
[1:07:32] state united okay very familiar right
[1:07:34] very familiar
[1:07:37] the third seal goodness we're getting a
[1:07:38] little we got past the deeds of nicolet
[1:07:39] and so is that a good review buddy i
[1:07:42] need it too buddy so i'm sure it's a
[1:07:43] good blessing for everybody by god's
[1:07:45] grace
[1:07:45] that's the one we got to watch out for
[1:07:47] the most most of us aren't going to
[1:07:48] start killing each other right
[1:07:50] hallelujah
[1:07:51] i'm sure i'd be the first one killed
[1:07:54] because i'm the one who speaks all the
[1:07:55] time
[1:07:58] uh but satan's going to try to get in
[1:08:00] through the white horse
[1:08:02] that deception the false teaching
[1:08:04] uh separating the preachers from
[1:08:06] everybody else
[1:08:13] oh so now they have the man anointing
[1:08:14] they have anointing of
[1:08:16] a man but the man says the wisdom of a
[1:08:18] man which was a power that went forth in
[1:08:20] the reformers
[1:08:21] black represents the dark ages so that's
[1:08:23] so perfect so beautiful so beautiful
[1:08:27] none
[1:08:28] but i read uh i read uh
[1:08:31] larkin and charles says russell neither
[1:08:33] of them caught that neither of them
[1:08:34] caught that the black horse rider was
[1:08:36] the dark ages only brother brandon
[1:08:38] called that so beautiful so beautiful
[1:08:40] man
[1:08:41] dark horse dark ages i mean it's
[1:08:43] beautiful
[1:08:45] because bro man said it was a time of
[1:08:46] midnight to the true believers that was
[1:08:48] left there was very little spiritual
[1:08:49] light right because they'd taken the
[1:08:51] bibles from the people
[1:08:52] and i'm going to preach on that pretty
[1:08:53] soon during the dark ages rome
[1:08:56] controlled almost this whole the whole
[1:08:58] almost the whole
[1:08:59] territory of europe
[1:09:02] and most people didn't have bibles but
[1:09:03] there were believers on the outskirts of
[1:09:05] the territory that still had bibles
[1:09:08] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:09:11] martin and i are irenaeus irenaeus the
[1:09:13] fourth church age messenger
[1:09:15] i'm sorry columba columba the fourth
[1:09:17] church age messenger was credited with
[1:09:18] keeping the word of god alive amen
[1:09:22] for all those thousands of years and
[1:09:23] because of the fourth church age
[1:09:24] messenger because he started schools and
[1:09:27] he kept the scrolls glory he kept the
[1:09:29] bible alive there could there could be a
[1:09:31] reformation without columbia there could
[1:09:33] be no reformation there be no martin
[1:09:35] luther without columbus he church we
[1:09:37] must find the the prophecy for our day
[1:09:40] fulfill god's word we must do what god's
[1:09:43] leading us to do because it will impact
[1:09:45] the next generation
[1:09:48] that guy columba impacted all these
[1:09:50] generations afterwards
[1:09:52] satan he destroyed it went from like
[1:09:54] the bible was in 200 languages to the
[1:09:56] dark age then it was down to one
[1:09:59] and he destroyed all the bibles kept it
[1:10:01] all in latin so the people couldn't
[1:10:02] understand but the holy ghost believers
[1:10:04] on the outskirts thanks to iranian's
[1:10:06] work hallelujah they kept marching on
[1:10:08] amen hiding out in those caves hiding
[1:10:10] out in those schools of the of the
[1:10:12] believers that they had actually had
[1:10:13] schools of the prophets they did
[1:10:15] they had in the old testament and they
[1:10:16] had it in the new too
[1:10:18] in other words god said i'll never leave
[1:10:20] myself without a witness on this earth
[1:10:22] lord church you've got to rejoice you're
[1:10:24] one of those witnesses praise god there
[1:10:26] aren't many witnesses in akron there's
[1:10:27] not many witnesses in america but you
[1:10:29] and i are some of those witnesses that's
[1:10:31] what jesus said the holy ghost is for to
[1:10:33] make you a witness unto jerusalem judea
[1:10:36] and the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:10:38] even into hackard ohio
[1:10:42] glory
[1:10:45] i love this one the white horse so the
[1:10:47] black horse rider had a pale a pair of
[1:10:49] balances he was capturing the wealth of
[1:10:51] the world stripping his subjects of
[1:10:53] their money
[1:10:54] he was selling indulgences you could you
[1:10:56] could slap a priest for a dollar you
[1:10:58] could rape a virgin for those like two
[1:10:59] dollars you could murder a man for like
[1:11:01] five dollars
[1:11:03] you could pay it either before after
[1:11:05] you pay it wicked
[1:11:07] such wickedness
[1:11:09] but then while he's riding capturing the
[1:11:11] wealth of the world there's a voice that
[1:11:12] cried out in the midst of the four
[1:11:14] beasts amen who is the one who's sitting
[1:11:16] in the midst of those four anointings is
[1:11:19] jesus christ the word hallelujah
[1:11:21] and then a voice cried out
[1:11:24] a measure wheat for a penny and three
[1:11:26] measures of barley for a penny that was
[1:11:28] christ recognizing the writer was
[1:11:30] charging for the natural staff of life
[1:11:33] and the indulgences and false spiritual
[1:11:35] hope
[1:11:36] that's right
[1:11:37] that's what satan was doing he was
[1:11:39] controlling the natural food and the
[1:11:40] spiritual food
[1:11:42] but then jesus cried out those beautiful
[1:11:43] words satan hurt not the oil and the
[1:11:47] wine satan you cannot touch the baptism
[1:11:49] of the holy ghost and the stimulation of
[1:11:52] revelation see church see when christ
[1:11:54] comes in you he's sealed in you and
[1:11:56] satan cannot touch your soul praise god
[1:11:59] your soul can never be lukewarm because
[1:12:01] jesus said he can't hurt it hallelujah
[1:12:04] satan can hurt your mind your body but
[1:12:06] he'll never hurt your soul
[1:12:08] praise god jesus said hurt that the wine
[1:12:11] and the oil praise god
[1:12:13] that's why you need the anointing that's
[1:12:14] why you gotta listen to sermons you need
[1:12:16] some stimulation you need something to
[1:12:17] stir you up because satan can't touch
[1:12:19] that praise god in other words we're the
[1:12:21] only ones that can hold back the oil and
[1:12:23] the wine oh my we do it to ourselves
[1:12:26] instead of seeking god for oil and why
[1:12:27] we seek other things but satan cannot
[1:12:30] touch it he can't hurt it so we can get
[1:12:32] it back let's get our first love back
[1:12:34] let's receive the oil and wine amen
[1:12:37] oh hallelujah
[1:12:39] thank you jesus i love that revelation
[1:12:42] satan don't touch that
[1:12:45] you can't put your hands on my oil and
[1:12:46] wine
[1:12:48] i love it
[1:12:51] whoops
[1:12:53] wrong button
[1:12:56] and then we get to rh church
[1:12:58] and i'm going to read uh my exact words
[1:13:00] out here because it i felt like it came
[1:13:01] to me from god
[1:13:12] i appreciate everybody's
[1:13:15] support today by god's grace
[1:13:18] so the ego-like beast is the flying
[1:13:20] eagle anointing notice he's not an
[1:13:22] earth-bound creature
[1:13:24] we're not bound to the things of earth
[1:13:26] we don't have to be bound satan cannot
[1:13:29] keep us on the ground
[1:13:31] we're supposed to be seated in heavenly
[1:13:33] places
[1:13:34] seed it means you've got authority right
[1:13:36] you're resting
[1:13:37] you're resting in a heavenly position
[1:13:40] because of this you're resting in a
[1:13:42] heavenly authority
[1:13:45] you're sitting in that you're sitting in
[1:13:46] the victory glory you're reigning you're
[1:13:49] reigning in the victory that god has
[1:13:50] given you in heavenly places
[1:13:54] you're seated with heavenly authority in
[1:13:57] christ jesus
[1:13:58] oh the bible's so true hallelujah so
[1:14:00] beautiful brotherhood calls this the
[1:14:02] prophetic age or the eagle age of
[1:14:03] revelation 10 7. ah it's a glorious amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah every mystery the mystery of
[1:14:09] god is finished the bible says
[1:14:11] somebody should write a book on that
[1:14:15] the pan horse rider
[1:14:17] but the man said pale is red and white
[1:14:19] and so mixed together the three in one
[1:14:21] eternal separation from god
[1:14:24] the bible said his name that said on him
[1:14:26] was death brother said god only knows
[1:14:28] how many he causes spiritually die by
[1:14:30] his anti-bible teaching think about all
[1:14:33] the natural death 68 million at least
[1:14:35] natural deaths how many spiritual deaths
[1:14:38] of all those popes they couldn't kill
[1:14:39] and all the all their henchmen and all
[1:14:42] their
[1:14:43] all their workers in the vatican that
[1:14:44] they didn't kill by the sword they just
[1:14:46] died natural deaths how many of those
[1:14:48] did satan kill with spiritual death
[1:14:51] there's the one he put 68 million to the
[1:14:53] sword and killed him probably billions
[1:14:55] look billions died spiritually on his
[1:14:57] false teaching no wonder he could take
[1:14:59] the name death
[1:15:01] oh but there's one he takes the name
[1:15:03] life
[1:15:04] oh hallelujah
[1:15:06] he said i am the way the truth and the
[1:15:08] life i am that living bread that's the
[1:15:10] one that we're partaking of amen
[1:15:13] hallelujah
[1:15:15] thank god
[1:15:17] the one that sets on the white horse
[1:15:18] rider the real white horse rider is life
[1:15:20] jesus christ
[1:15:24] and notice hell follows him now hell
[1:15:26] always follows death in the natural when
[1:15:28] the natural man dies hell follows him
[1:15:30] that's the grave hades see that's in the
[1:15:32] natural but in the spiritual it's a lake
[1:15:35] of fire
[1:15:37] power was given over to this paris
[1:15:39] writer this is still future this is
[1:15:40] still future
[1:15:42] because brother ham said he's riding now
[1:15:43] but he's going to take his final ride at
[1:15:45] armageddon
[1:15:46] through the antichrist that's in the
[1:15:48] fourth seal
[1:15:50] he said the last ride of the incarnate
[1:15:51] devil in the person the antichrist
[1:15:54] fulfilling revelation 13 revelation 16
[1:15:56] he gathers his subjects to armageddon he
[1:15:59] will have a power think about that over
[1:16:00] the fourth part of the earth
[1:16:04] to kill with hunger and with death
[1:16:06] and with the beast of the earth a fourth
[1:16:09] now i just showed you what i just showed
[1:16:10] you uh there's eight billion people on
[1:16:12] the earth well after the capture maybe
[1:16:14] i don't know how many are going to go
[1:16:16] not many
[1:16:17] not gonna be many but a fourth of eight
[1:16:20] is what two two billion
[1:16:22] he's gonna power over two billion
[1:16:25] to kill with the sword
[1:16:26] and with the beast of the earth
[1:16:28] a fourth of the earth two billion people
[1:16:31] killed by the sword
[1:16:33] bob said the beasts of the earth
[1:16:35] will eat them
[1:16:36] that's how big this gathering is at
[1:16:38] armageddon
[1:16:41] actually there's a pretty good time in
[1:16:42] here by god's grace usually i start
[1:16:44] closing at noon usually i start closing
[1:16:45] on you but let me read this before i get
[1:16:47] to the differences of the revelation let
[1:16:49] me read this this is page
[1:16:53] 480 it's broadband admin broadband was
[1:16:56] the other historic so there it is right
[1:16:57] there yes sir about that
[1:17:00] what is this flying eagle anointing mean
[1:17:03] if you use the bible
[1:17:06] a flying eagle anointing is watchfulness
[1:17:09] that we keep during the church ages
[1:17:12] because flying eagles are what are they
[1:17:14] doing up there they're watching for prey
[1:17:17] and potential adversaries glory
[1:17:19] because they've got to protect their
[1:17:20] territory we've seen it when my wife and
[1:17:22] i go walking we see birds protecting
[1:17:24] their territory
[1:17:25] they all do that almost all animals
[1:17:26] protect their territory
[1:17:28] wild animals
[1:17:30] what's a flying eagle do he's looking
[1:17:32] for food and he's protecting his sky
[1:17:35] his area of the sky
[1:17:38] but jesus urges us to sit in heavenly
[1:17:41] places and watch and pray for a second
[1:17:44] coming praise god ah
[1:17:46] there it is amen
[1:17:48] see we're supposed to rule our authority
[1:17:51] we're supposed to rule in our position
[1:17:52] glory god's given me position over this
[1:17:54] church
[1:17:56] god's given me position over my family
[1:17:59] right god's given me a position at my
[1:18:00] job
[1:18:02] i've got to rule over it with the
[1:18:04] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:18:07] i've got to fly i've got to watch amen
[1:18:09] i've got to watch i got to be observant
[1:18:11] i've got to protect the authority that
[1:18:13] god has given me not give an inch to the
[1:18:15] devil praise god
[1:18:17] in other words possess every promise of
[1:18:20] god if the bible says i can have it if
[1:18:22] the body if the bible says i can freely
[1:18:24] have it then i can freely have it for
[1:18:26] free
[1:18:27] i can have it for free praise god
[1:18:29] whether it's love joy peace or patience
[1:18:31] or long suffering or whatever fruit of
[1:18:33] the spirit if it's a free gift freely
[1:18:36] given i can freely have it i've got to
[1:18:38] protect that though i can't let the
[1:18:40] devil take any great blessing or any
[1:18:43] territory that god has given me
[1:18:46] that's where satan gets people he gets
[1:18:48] into their job
[1:18:49] he gets into their relationships
[1:18:51] he gets into the gifts of the spirit
[1:18:54] who is that talking to about that
[1:18:57] saying god and to gift of the holy
[1:18:59] spirit i forget also talking to somebody
[1:19:00] about that they gave me a good example i
[1:19:01] can't remember it now you got to you
[1:19:03] even have to watch gifts
[1:19:05] make sure satan doesn't get into the
[1:19:06] gifts of the holy spirit
[1:19:08] your family you don't want satan to get
[1:19:09] in your family
[1:19:11] start doing damage in the family
[1:19:13] you got to watch that as eagles we've
[1:19:15] got to protect our territory
[1:19:18] watch and pray
[1:19:25] he says uh yeah i wrote holy
[1:19:27] ghost-filled saints are rapture-minded
[1:19:29] meaning their thoughts are on the
[1:19:30] heavenly meeting in the air from first
[1:19:32] thessalonians 4 17 our affection should
[1:19:34] be set on things above
[1:19:37] like the rapture as colossians 3 1 and 2
[1:19:39] declares like a high flying eagle we
[1:19:41] must press toward the mark for the prize
[1:19:43] of the high calling of god in christ
[1:19:45] jesus
[1:19:47] see foolish virgins are not called to
[1:19:49] live as high as we are we're called to
[1:19:51] live higher because eagles live in the
[1:19:53] higher heights
[1:19:55] praise god
[1:19:56] we have to recognize thank god there's
[1:19:58] other people safe but if we're an eagle
[1:20:00] we've got to fly high and we've got to
[1:20:02] protect our territory and we've got to
[1:20:04] be watchful praise god
[1:20:05] that's why that's why god give you that
[1:20:07] prophetic eyesight praise god you can
[1:20:09] see the revelations god sent to his
[1:20:10] prophet
[1:20:13] remember jesus uses the eagle to
[1:20:15] represent end-time believers in matthew
[1:20:17] 24 verses 25-28 for wheresoever the
[1:20:20] carcass is there will the eagles be
[1:20:23] gathered
[1:20:25] we must be one of these eagles gathered
[1:20:27] around the word of god
[1:20:29] anointed with god's
[1:20:31] flying eagle power as you know god
[1:20:33] likens himself unto eagles in revelation
[1:20:36] 19 verse 4
[1:20:38] and also in psalms 103 verse 5 and
[1:20:40] psalms 40 verse 3 he likens you to an
[1:20:43] eagle you can renew your strength aren't
[1:20:45] you glad you can renew your strength
[1:20:46] praise god
[1:20:47] church when you get tired don't give up
[1:20:49] when you get tired don't give in
[1:20:51] wait upon the lord he'll renew you he'll
[1:20:54] strengthen you again that power will
[1:20:56] come again that love will come again
[1:20:58] hallelujah that enthusiasm that zeal it
[1:21:01] will come again praise god
[1:21:03] wait on it praise god wait on the lord
[1:21:05] don't give up territory while you're
[1:21:07] waiting though
[1:21:09] wait on the lord renew your strength and
[1:21:11] the bible says you'll be renewed like
[1:21:13] the eagle
[1:21:15] in other words there must be times the
[1:21:17] eagle gets tired
[1:21:18] he gets tired of flying all around he
[1:21:20] gets tired of you have you seen eagles
[1:21:21] fight have you seen the videos where
[1:21:23] they fight in the sky and they're like
[1:21:24] all their towns are and then they fall
[1:21:26] down and somebody has to let go whoever
[1:21:27] let's go first loses
[1:21:29] and that's how they know who gets the
[1:21:30] territory well after a while you get
[1:21:32] kind of tired of fighting
[1:21:34] all those
[1:21:36] fights sky fights i'll just call them
[1:21:37] sky bites
[1:21:39] and somehow the eagle gets tired
[1:21:42] all that fighting all that meat for my
[1:21:44] for my babies in the nest
[1:21:47] church we get tired too
[1:21:49] we've got to say god restore my strength

[1:22:57] above all earth-bound temptations and
[1:23:00] will eventually lift you in the air to
[1:23:02] meet jesus at the
[1:23:05] god now rapture all you
[1:23:07] scholars out there i'm gonna close with
[1:23:08] this here
[1:23:11] i love i love studying the word of god
[1:23:14] i gotta renew my strength sometimes
[1:23:15] sometimes it's not so easy to study
[1:23:17] i need renewed like the ego so there's
[1:23:20] all these accusations now i was telling
[1:23:21] this to brother austin just so you know
[1:23:23] the current side that's left the message
[1:23:25] they're attacking brother brown they're
[1:23:26] calling him a racist now they're calling
[1:23:28] him a polygamist
[1:23:30] there some of them are even saying he
[1:23:31] was a homosexual
[1:23:33] is some of the most awful attacks
[1:23:37] i'm going to deal with some of them
[1:23:38] eventually you know when i felt the feel
[1:23:39] of the holy spirit i remember the other
[1:23:41] side is worshiping saying him he's god
[1:23:44] we had somebody tell austin this week
[1:23:45] that i that the church thinks i'm god
[1:23:47] remember
[1:23:50] poor fella
[1:23:53] he was around me more he'd see more of
[1:23:54] my mistakes you know
[1:23:57] but see one side worship i just saw
[1:23:59] joseph branham's uh blog post from
[1:24:01] yesterday he said
[1:24:03] uh there's absolutely nothing wrong on
[1:24:04] the tapes he said it's all pure it's all
[1:24:06] fresh water there's nothing wrong on the
[1:24:08] tapes i mean does this guy even listen
[1:24:09] to the tapes i don't know
[1:24:11] i don't know
[1:24:12] then the other side is by the ram is
[1:24:14] this he's that he's that he's that he's
[1:24:16] that one of them is he's a plagiarist
[1:24:18] and i'm gonna prove to you right now he
[1:24:19] was no plagiarist
[1:24:21] remember during the church ages he said
[1:24:23] i got this from his orange 20 times ten
[1:24:26] i counted
[1:24:28] yeah i went back and listened
[1:24:30] 20 times he said i got this from history
[1:24:32] but then other times he said i didn't
[1:24:33] get this from history the holy spirit
[1:24:35] showed me the church age messengers
[1:24:37] and that was exactly right
[1:24:39] brother iran said he got the dates from
[1:24:40] clarence larkin he did so that that was
[1:24:43] something he borrowed
[1:24:44] right or he referenced
[1:24:46] like any scholar would or any any
[1:24:48] teacher would and he said that he said
[1:24:49] the dates weren't given to me by the
[1:24:51] lord he said but the messengers were and
[1:24:53] the length of the church ages were given
[1:24:55] to him by the lord
[1:24:58] and the seals
[1:25:00] okay so his revelations differed greatly
[1:25:02] from clarence larkin who was a baptist
[1:25:04] and boy he was like i showed you he was
[1:25:05] a talented
[1:25:06] talented man he could draw some of those
[1:25:08] beautiful illustrations that future home
[1:25:10] and that's gonna be my favorite i think
[1:25:12] all the time
[1:25:13] that's a beautiful picture
[1:25:14] and then he also uh differed from
[1:25:16] charles hayes russell i've studied these
[1:25:17] two in depth in depth
[1:25:20] now i haven't studied because i got an
[1:25:21] email this week saying uh there's an
[1:25:23] accusation brother uh plagiarized from
[1:25:24] uriah smith i started looking into it
[1:25:26] and nope i did but i got to spend more
[1:25:28] time i got to just devote some hours to
[1:25:30] it
[1:25:32] so brother brown did not plagiarize
[1:25:33] baptist
[1:25:34] jobs witnesses or seventh-day adventists
[1:25:36] and here's the proof
[1:25:39] so for the seven seals
[1:25:41] uh
[1:25:42] larkin said nothing about the seven
[1:25:44] seals
[1:25:46] wait this is seven church ages
[1:25:48] okay
[1:25:50] yep sorry i did a i did a
[1:25:53] this is it yeah sorry i was hoping to do
[1:25:55] the seven seals i just copy and pasted
[1:25:58] that slide and i hadn't updated yet so
[1:25:59] sorry
[1:26:00] so this is the one i did on the podcast
[1:26:02] so
[1:26:03] um brother ram said he got the dates
[1:26:05] from larkin
[1:26:06] larkin gave no church age messenger so
[1:26:08] you can't say he plagiarized that
[1:26:10] now charles says russell the job is
[1:26:12] witnesses he did do messengers but look
[1:26:14] who his messenger is paul that's the
[1:26:16] same saint john was his second messenger
[1:26:19] the iranians
[1:26:20] his third messenger was arius he wrote
[1:26:23] some good things
[1:26:24] but brother rams was martin
[1:26:26] russell said peter waldow was the fourth
[1:26:29] with ramsey columba
[1:26:31] tay said wickliffe brother man said
[1:26:32] martin luther
[1:26:34] tay said luther this the brother man
[1:26:37] said wesley and russell said he was last
[1:26:40] but said it was elijah which we know was
[1:26:41] him
[1:26:44] there's nobody that can tell me he
[1:26:46] plagiarized because i went and studied
[1:26:47] it i've got pictures let me pull this up
[1:26:49] here
[1:26:53] i have i did screenshots you know me
[1:26:56] i took screenshots and i can show the
[1:26:58] exact quotes from the books i've got the
[1:27:02] exact quotes they can't so i went
[1:27:04] through all these seals i can show the
[1:27:06] exact difference between all of them i
[1:27:07] just got to update it i haven't put this
[1:27:09] online yet because i just did the
[1:27:10] podcast
[1:27:11] i can show you the exact wording from
[1:27:13] each man
[1:27:14] on all these seals how brother ram
[1:27:16] taught different he did not plagiarize
[1:27:18] him when he said the holy ghost came in
[1:27:20] that room church the holy ghost came in
[1:27:22] that room
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:24] because it's different from everybody
[1:27:26] else hallelujah
[1:27:28] when jesus christ came to me through
[1:27:29] bible's message it was unlike anything
[1:27:31] i'd ever felt before it was unlike
[1:27:33] anything i've seen before it was the
[1:27:35] spirit of holiness i never felt it like
[1:27:37] that but thank god i never have yet felt
[1:27:39] anything different and we can't get used
[1:27:41] to that we've got to enjoy that
[1:27:42] anointing we know there's something
[1:27:43] different about this message because
[1:27:45] this message points us back to the bible
[1:27:47] praise god the mystery of god should be
[1:27:48] finished the seven seals unveil satan
[1:27:51] but it also unveils jesus christ amen
[1:27:53] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:27:55] musicians can come
[1:27:56] i didn't get to all the quotes but i
[1:27:58] preached an hour and a half already so i
[1:27:59] want to stop right there by god's grace
[1:28:02] is that helpful but amen
[1:28:06] like i said if you have any other
[1:28:07] questions
[1:28:08] you know we can do it next sunday night
[1:28:10] you know before we do the testimony and
[1:28:12] so forth that the lord be willing
[1:28:14] ever enjoy the word today by god's grace
[1:28:17] church we got to be renewed like the ego
[1:28:18] praise god we've got to be growing in
[1:28:20] the understanding of the lord praise god
[1:28:22] we've got to feast on these things we're
[1:28:23] going to wait on the lord he will renew
[1:28:25] our
[1:28:27] hi there strength
[1:28:27] power heads here

[1:28:38] us here as we pray and see god's place
[1:28:41] heavenly father lord it's been a joy to
[1:28:43] look at your word it's been a joy here
[1:28:45] father to go back and look at what your
[1:28:47] prophet preached lord god
[1:28:49] after 12 years lord it's refreshing to
[1:28:51] me to see that lord god again
[1:28:54] your prophet was so honest he said i've
[1:28:56] read read these i've read those i've
[1:28:57] read all these but when the spirit came
[1:29:00] to me he showed me something
[1:29:02] or we can see it's vindicated in the
[1:29:04] bible
[1:29:05] the black horse dark ages
[1:29:09] the red horse
[1:29:10] 68 million martyrs
[1:29:13] the flying eagle the prophetic eyes to
[1:29:16] finish the mystery of god at the end
[1:29:19] lord thank you for helping me teach this
[1:29:20] lord
[1:29:21] you helped me back there in 2010 12
[1:29:23] years ago you're helping me today
[1:29:27] lord my prayer lord is that
[1:29:29] we could constantly battle off that
[1:29:31] white horse rider who's trying to
[1:29:33] battle against us
[1:29:35] or maybe we'd even say lord the pale
[1:29:38] horse rider is trying to get in with
[1:29:39] deception
[1:29:40] since that's the current spirit we're
[1:29:41] battling here at this age
[1:29:44] lord we know what he wants to do
[1:29:47] he wants to bring in his false
[1:29:49] word deeds
[1:29:54] wants to pervert our lives
[1:29:57] but lord you promised if we're your
[1:29:59] bride
[1:30:01] we would stay faithful to you we'd hear
[1:30:03] no other voice but the voice of the holy
[1:30:05] spirit hallelujah and you would wash us
[1:30:07] in the waters of the world
[1:30:09] thank you jesus

[1:30:22] by the power of the holy spirit
[1:30:25] as we yield
[1:30:26] as we trust in you
[1:30:28] strength will rise as we wait upon the
[1:30:30] lord amen hallelujah it will rise up
[1:30:33] like the eagle hallelujah thank you
