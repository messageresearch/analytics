[34:37] for him because he was it was awesome
[34:39] ready yes sir
[34:44] Laurie I mean Zechariah 4 verse 6 then
[34:52] he answered mistaken to be saying that
[34:54] this is the word of the Lord of the
[34:56] ruble saying not by might not by power
[35:02] but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[35:07] oh God the only way you and I are going
[35:13] to make it out of you it is not the mean
[35:16] brother Hanuman brother Jason brother
[35:18] bang and mount I were to start a
[35:19] bodybuilding workout of the session and
[35:21] we're going to pump iron like Arnold and
[35:24] the rest and Ronnie's and all that guys
[35:26] and pop our big big big old cannons on
[35:29] our arms and Beatles eyes and we're
[35:31] going to walk around like we we got it
[35:33] all in control it's not by power not by
[35:36] natural light but it's going to take the
[35:39] spirit of the limit amen yes even we are
[35:44] trusting and depending on that yes yes
[35:48] absolutely not in 2nd Corinthians 32
[35:53] verse 8 because with him is the arm of
[35:57] flesh Jesus but with us is the Lord our
[36:00] God
[36:01] help us into fight our battles a
[36:04] manifesto as you could go through the
[36:07] Old Testament as you go through the New
[36:09] Testament is continually what we're
[36:11] depending on God
[36:12] hey man we are not smart up to bring
[36:15] this rapture out it may be true I have
[36:18] the quickening power it's not our own
[36:20] it's within us but we are weighing on
[36:23] him yes my man but then in another term
[36:27] he is also waiting on us too sure right
[36:32] right it solves 20 verse 6 he says now I
[36:37] know that I the Lord saying his anointed
[36:40] he will hear from him from his holy
[36:42] heaven with the saving strength of his
[36:45] right hand he says some trust in
[36:48] chariots he says seven horses but we
[36:50] will remember the name of the Lord our
[36:52] God which is what the Lord Jesus is so
[36:56] all these you can put your trust in this
[36:58] you can put your trust on that or in a
[37:00] man or a sister or a program or a church
[37:03] ranch but we must put our trust in the
[37:06] Holy Ghost an unseen force that only
[37:09] reveals himself in particular time they
[37:12] met but if we can get into the spirit of
[37:14] it get into the spirit of things that
[37:17] we'll be able to enter in and really
[37:20] meet him face to face
[37:22] are we seeking just for things when I
[37:25] went to go to our prayer closet are we
[37:27] going like this Lord Jesus please help
[37:31] me Lord bless this brother and bless
[37:33] that sister and Lord I need help here I
[37:35] need that when we should be in the
[37:37] closet say Lord reveal yourself to me
[37:42] show me who you are
[37:44] holy God no Lord Mayor anointing and
[37:47] presence be with me or let me see you
[37:49] face to face
[37:50] are we in our prayer closets pray to
[37:54] meet God face to face are we praying
[37:57] that the spirit may come down and
[37:59] changes in a way like no other just like
[38:01] the intended vision where we went if
[38:03] they went into the tent and something
[38:05] happened something changed what was it
[38:07] it was the Spirit of God came down in
[38:10] there and changed him it healed and I
[38:12] made a well full recovery to the rock
[38:14] eh-eh absolute just looked out yes it
[38:19] solves 33 verse 20 is our soul waited
[38:27] for the Lord he is our help he says and
[38:30] he is our shield for our heart shall
[38:33] rejoice in him because we have trusted
[38:36] in his holy name a man named not I might
[38:38] add my power the what I his spirit saith
[38:41] alone yeah I am the name of Jesus Christ
[38:44] we will overcome yes sorry it's all 44
[38:50] verse 4 he says thou art my king of God
[38:57] command deliverances for Jacob through
[39:00] thee when we pushed down our enemies
[39:03] through thy neighbor we will tread them
[39:05] up under that we rise up again he says
[39:08] probably not trust in my boat neither
[39:10] would I trust my sword to sing he says
[39:13] but thou has saved us from our enemies
[39:16] and put them to shame that hated us amen
[39:19] and what we were waiting on God he we
[39:21] can only trust in the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:24] for what these things are happening
[39:27] absolutely there are little others are
[39:29] little trials in life are these little
[39:31] trials that we go through Italy seem
[39:33] fiery and hard a contentious these are
[39:36] small compared to what's coming right
[39:39] thanks God if we cannot love each other
[39:42] through these we've got issues because
[39:45] much more is coming we're going to see a
[39:47] very very dark day right right
[39:51] absolutely
[39:56] in Ephesians 6:11 st. Paul says put all
[40:03] the whole armour of God amen
[40:06] now we're not natural warriors this is
[40:09] not of the Atlas system the Army has he
[40:15] said put on the whole army I've got
[40:16] armor of God that may be able to
[40:18] withstand against and against the wiles
[40:21] of the devil yes now we're battling what
[40:24] Satan it is
[40:26] minions Satan it is demons as with me as
[40:30] a brother circulate yes it is you will
[40:33] right I saw the smart even so so not so
[40:36] smart demons so very ruthless demons
[40:39] right right so where lies the demon
[40:45] powers
[40:45] go to Matthew 12 verse or 30 Matthew 12
[40:50] verse 43
[40:55] what is the demon most powerful when the
[41:01] unclean spirit is gone out of a man from
[41:05] right now you walketh through Dry places
[41:07] seeking rest and find it and done so
[41:12] what now this man has heard the Word of
[41:14] God
[41:14] demon has left he's cast about however
[41:16] and now the man isn't leaving living
[41:19] clean and the demons out what and dry
[41:21] places what good is that team is doing
[41:25] for his kingdom then he said I will
[41:29] return to my house once I came and when
[41:31] he cometh he fight his sweat empty swept
[41:34] and garnished what he did
[41:37] this man had was a sin to be patient he
[41:39] made it all the way to sanctification
[41:42] then he goeth and taketh with himself
[41:45] seven other spirits more awakened yes my
[41:49] then himself
[41:51] you mean this original demon wasn't
[41:54] strong enough to break through the
[41:55] second time at first this man he was
[41:59] taken by one spirit right one spirit or
[42:02] maybe a lolly or or or little thief this
[42:06] or a little stealing of that or whatever
[42:07] and what securing it or anything I got
[42:10] this man he live there enjoy it for
[42:12] years or days or however once right
[42:14] right but then the man muscle got sick
[42:17] of this demon but rise a half to go free
[42:20] spits come pray for me lay your hands on
[42:23] me and connect to God I cast out of the
[42:26] medicine oh I feel so much better
[42:28] hey buddy yes yes and that spirit that
[42:32] lying spirit or whatever kind of spirit
[42:34] was he got lolis he's like man I missed
[42:37] my house
[42:39] he come back and he could not enter into
[42:42] this man so we had to get seven other
[42:45] spirits more powerful right then him it
[42:49] took that much more now to enter into
[42:52] that sanctified bus right which tells us
[42:56] what there are little apples of teaming
[43:00] oh that's right good brother good levels
[43:03] just like our government just like our
[43:06] military is set up in the levels there's
[43:09] the highest man and then it goes down
[43:11] below this and then there's somebody
[43:13] under him and there's somebody under
[43:14] head there's somebody under him and it's
[43:16] all chain of command it's just slightly
[43:18] laughs in this spirit good good right
[43:23] yes sir sure
[43:24] he says he's taken seven other spirits
[43:27] more wicked than himself and they enter
[43:30] in and dwell there they go her come the
[43:33] vessel right and the last state of the
[43:36] man is worse than the first why because
[43:38] he's got seven times more worse demons
[43:41] than he had before that's right bro
[43:43] that's right he says even so shall be
[43:46] unto this wicked generation ah all right
[43:49] good right now where is the power of the
[43:52] strength now look at the promises
[43:53] greatest battle ever fought yes 62 311
[43:57] 8-4 look what he says he says so much as
[44:00] we have here he says a devil is almost
[44:04] harmless unless he unless he can have
[44:09] something to work as that demon was cast
[44:13] on that man the beginning he was
[44:16] hardness he can hardly do any damage but
[44:22] once a demon enters into a person now
[44:25] the can do damage use that person to but
[44:28] damage verbally physically upon people
[44:31] of God upon anyone now the deevak has a
[44:34] vessel something to control Oh almost
[44:38] like a human tank right right absolutely
[44:42] go he's easy almost harmless that he can
[44:46] have something to work in he says you
[44:48] remember those demons and were cast out
[44:50] Allegiant he said they had they watched
[44:52] you more mischievousness so they wanted
[44:55] to go into the horns he says so Devils
[44:58] must have something to work in somebody
[45:01] to work through he said that's the way
[45:02] God does it do God needs to use a sneaky
[45:11] what you Hey thank you Jesus
[45:15] sure ah or Ephesians 6 verse 12 B 6
[45:21] verse 12 eases or we wrestle not against
[45:25] flesh and blood but what against
[45:29] principalities against powers against
[45:33] rulers of the darkness of this world
[45:35] against spiritual wickedness in high
[45:37] places what this is this is a chain of
[45:39] command these are levels of spirits from
[45:42] the highest to the lowest we're battling
[45:44] them off put all your spiritual warfare
[45:47] here amen yes like a hell of salvation
[45:50] you better know that you're safe
[45:52] hey man keep this mind pure all divine
[45:55] now that's loot he's God that's right he
[46:00] says wherefore take the whole armor of
[46:02] God that you may be able to withstand
[46:04] the evil day now that we're in
[46:06] principalities in the Greek it means the
[46:10] chief or the first the principal that
[46:14] rules principalities those are the most
[46:18] dangerous demons you'll ever face the
[46:24] strongest the most annoying the ones
[46:28] that can get in your head and just dwell
[46:30] there and set up a nest if we're not
[46:32] careful right
[46:33] what is it getting our hearts and put a
[46:35] root of bitterness in there or or or
[46:37] this or a demon or something you know we
[46:39] have one weak spot right we regarded
[46:41] with all of our with all of our strength
[46:43] and then one of these strong guys into
[46:46] your weak spot could be finished unless
[46:47] you you laughter you're weeded out right
[46:50] right now look at the Prophet as he's
[46:56] going through his ministry here in 53 he
[47:00] starts as is he's getting he's getting
[47:02] more and more exhausted he's a prophet
[47:04] god he could see in the supernatural
[47:07] demon algae 53 e 12 he says friends
[47:11] they're just as real as your real he's
[47:13] talking about demons he's talking about
[47:15] his personal contact with demons he says
[47:18] I see them some of them are the shape of
[47:20] bats yeah he says look at like long
[47:24] hairs hanging on their legs all the
[47:27] people pieces but an epileptic demon
[47:32] looks like a tortoise with round legs
[47:35] and he's describing these demons of an
[47:38] affliction that are all the people that
[47:40] God is allowed of the cast off him
[47:42] and he's telling people this is what he
[47:45] sings look like there he is
[47:48] he says hanging up like that and he up
[47:51] however they hang up he says but usually
[47:53] a demon of oppression seems to be more
[47:55] like a cloud form he says he says like
[47:59] away and it just makes you go funny
[48:01] noise
[48:02] he's what is what is when you're in that
[48:04] dimension to see the spirit ah so he's
[48:08] describing on how these demons look we
[48:11] know that the destard looks like a hood
[48:13] over you right he says but now he is now
[48:17] you may think that that's wrong but some
[48:20] of the one of these days you'll realize
[48:22] if you could just take a spiritual
[48:24] looking glass and look into your soul he
[48:27] says your your doubt you'll find out
[48:29] what it looks like he says in the
[48:32] greatest devil the chief of all Devils
[48:36] is unbelief he says and there's only and
[48:40] that's the only seat there is oh boy so
[48:45] he's dealing with what these are global
[48:46] level demons right here these all these
[48:49] these cancer causing this night ozone or
[48:51] we're dealing with much greater than
[48:53] that now sure remember those are demons
[48:57] nothing I was like above listen what's
[49:00] the most dangerous kind huh right now
[49:04] and we know how the private talk about
[49:06] that maniac that went to that big strong
[49:08] man he comes up to the services minister
[49:12] or however he said he says I'm going to
[49:14] crush every bone in your body and the
[49:16] Prophet said he was like six
[49:17] however is 200 somehow Palsy said he
[49:20] could and he had the ability to do he
[49:23] come up a challenge of profit and this
[49:24] this and this
[49:25] he says you're nothing but I hired this
[49:27] you're that you're that whatever this is
[49:29] that right challenging the man of God
[49:32] look at the boldness of the devil right
[49:35] right right sure
[49:38] he said now picking up with that story
[49:40] that maniac that monster was going to go
[49:42] knock brother Graham clear across the
[49:44] way that whatever he said when I look at
[49:46] the man I heard myself talking I don't
[49:48] know whether it may sound strange but it
[49:50] was the Holy Spirit speaking he says the
[49:53] Bible said take no thought what you'll
[49:55] to say in that out right this is it'll
[49:59] be added then he says because it's the
[50:01] pious because you have defied the Spirit
[50:03] of God tonight he will fall over my feet
[50:06] and what that man he said well he said
[50:10] well show you who is he doth fall over
[50:12] and he was and he went matches rolls
[50:15] over back like this to put a big old
[50:17] cloud or fist on the prophet's face he
[50:20] says and he truths big on back and
[50:23] started to hit me like he said and I
[50:25] said say kid come on man just about like
[50:28] that in the name of the Lord cheese man
[50:30] hey man he says Indiana's be going back
[50:34] like this two strikes he started the old
[50:39] they see the dizzy Dan sort of hit this
[50:42] is in his eyes rolled back he started
[50:45] going around and around like that and
[50:46] fell down right on right on the prophets
[50:49] feet right this probably said he
[50:51] couldn't move but the policeman said is
[50:52] he dead yet probably he is not dead is
[50:55] he gonna get better he said no he said
[50:56] he loves that spirit that's right
[51:02] since he's healing he said no he says he
[51:04] worships that spirit he won't give it up
[51:07] he says but now look he says but if you
[51:10] just move him off my feet so when I got
[51:13] there I just turned around to see the
[51:14] audience I said as I was saying faith is
[51:17] the substance of things hoped for
[51:19] he says an ax man sitting
[51:21] chair just raised up now what's your
[51:25] place there
[51:28] he hasn't even really even started
[51:30] preaching or however and Satan comes
[51:34] down through a jive dundas man a vessel
[51:38] right and once the not stopped the word
[51:42] from going forth and the Holy Spirit
[51:44] casts it out and all the Prophet does is
[51:48] you start back out says his face this
[51:49] and all of a sudden oh man and
[51:51] wheelchair jumps what took place what
[51:56] was it he says the sheath of that tribe
[52:00] of demons he says had made the challenge
[52:03] and lost it you see and that's when the
[52:06] Spirit of God struck the building he
[52:08] says that everything was healed he says
[52:10] and at that time when the even said I
[52:12] seen their chief man two beauties they
[52:14] just began to rise up on the wheelchairs
[52:16] that cost everything to stretcher early
[52:18] it was done because the it's all right
[52:30] yeah yeah yeah yeah see how it works
[52:34] would you know the higher yes sir we can
[52:39] if we can be the one unbelief that one
[52:43] devil um buddy thanks God nothing will
[52:46] be impossible
[52:46] hey hey hey mad man ah I want to show
[52:52] you something here go to Matthew 17
[52:54] verse 14 so the hierarchy in the
[52:59] spiritual realm
[53:00] chief demons lower level demons those
[53:02] are just trying to stay in the hell and
[53:04] just whatever they are but I'm good up
[53:05] here it would be totally an effective
[53:08] our our I know but they're doing with a
[53:12] hierarchy yes sir
[53:14] but now look with the Saints now look
[53:16] with this devil 50:17 verse 14 and they
[53:22] were going to come down were come to the
[53:24] multitude there came a certain and he
[53:26] leaned out him and say lord have mercy
[53:28] on my son
[53:30] he says for he is a lunatic and sore
[53:34] back from
[53:34] all times you fall it into the fire and
[53:37] off into the water and I've been sought
[53:38] in projects that I disciples and they
[53:41] could not for yes
[53:45] his disciples were powerless yes sir
[53:51] right and then jesus answered and said o
[53:55] faithless and perverse generation how
[53:58] long shall I be with you how long shall
[54:00] I suffer you bring me live to me and
[54:02] Jesus refused to devil right he says and
[54:05] he departed out of him in the child was
[54:07] cured from that very hour now what take
[54:10] place here this is Lucas and then Jesus
[54:13] needed waking up cast him out they said
[54:15] the psychosis why do we not cast him out
[54:17] what you said because of your unbelief
[54:19] all right what's so powerful what is the
[54:24] main thing that I got out of this
[54:26] portion of the chapter of this book
[54:29] record directly before this they did but
[54:38] had what the message the rapture
[54:41] revelation revealed to them d-doesn't
[54:44] been broken in type form the rapture is
[54:48] being the tribulation heal they are
[54:50] caught up of the fiction it doesn't
[54:52] matter how many mysteries you know it
[54:55] doesn't matter this if this messages
[54:57] come to you or not why could not be
[55:00] disciples cast them out they saw the
[55:02] vision they understood what it meant
[55:04] they even talked about Elias
[55:06] I thought Elijah come and keeps that
[55:08] he's putted right but if you receive
[55:14] this message
[55:16] verse 21 howbeit this kind goeth not out
[55:20] but by prayer and fast
[55:24] amen the Holy Ghost was to use your
[55:28] vessel as well that's right if we are
[55:31] not pray and fasting like we should
[55:34] we'll be popping the Holy Ghost is
[55:38] powerless in right amen ah
[55:42] he needs you two vessels you got and
[55:46] what does that prayer
[55:48] passing do it gets us out of the picture
[55:51] it's a supplication it's a real
[55:54] reverence reverencing god of selsun Lord
[55:57] take more control over me as I make
[55:59] myself we die here to my best Amen baby
[56:03] man glory and they could not cast out
[56:08] this chief demon ma the revelation of
[56:14] the hour without prayer and fasting was
[56:16] only so strong yes sir yes sir
[56:20] beautiful now now the Prophet goes into
[56:25] it more and more as he's going into the
[56:27] prayer lines and the prayer meetings and
[56:29] all these things these as his meetings
[56:31] continue on and on and on and he reveals
[56:34] a little bit more to us do you now
[56:39] believe 53 1206 e e9 t 4 he says now a
[56:44] round about her as a dark cloud seems to
[56:48] be about this square when I look at her
[56:49] it's coming in going he says that's the
[56:52] demon he says as soon as how do I know
[56:54] it he couldn't feel it pulling from out
[56:55] here he's so sensitive the spirit he
[56:57] says what is it everyone out there is
[56:59] screaming for help so now he's just
[57:03] showing and revealing it wasn't if
[57:05] there's someone with cancer there's
[57:07] someone with the disease with certain
[57:08] assistance if the demons about ready to
[57:11] cast out and it feels the face of the
[57:13] person on the inside rising and that
[57:15] things going to have to go just like
[57:17] that band that was cured of that one
[57:19] that was a spirit I already cut cleanser
[57:23] didn't garnishing the sky dragon if a
[57:25] spirit within him know he's about ready
[57:27] to leave you know call out for help
[57:29] right right showing what that demon is
[57:32] only so strong against faith that's
[57:34] right I guess the Spirit of God not by
[57:37] my and my power but what the Spirit of
[57:40] God absolutely amen everybody screaming
[57:43] for help because I can feel the face of
[57:45] you believers moving in he says and it
[57:49] can be done it can be done and singers
[57:51] crying help help and their face is
[57:53] crying it can be done they can't be done
[57:55] big man
[57:56] and what we know these demons the real
[57:58] ones cause for more health clothing for
[58:01] spiritual a fallen angel backup power
[58:04] hola try and cook plant seeds that they
[58:08] cannot be healed in their heads real
[58:10] quickly during the service as Malachi 4
[58:12] is preaching a word and from leaving it
[58:14] a telling them they can be hit like a
[58:16] field the demons are now trying to
[58:18] whisper in these broken people's ears
[58:20] and say you can't you can't you can't
[58:23] you're going to be remained this for the
[58:24] rest of your life for the rest of your
[58:25] life for the rest of your life absolute
[58:27] but what the sphere and the people are
[58:28] saying yes we can it can be done it can
[58:33] be done while the demons are crying for
[58:35] more help and more down ma that's sure
[58:39] hey man now verse the contending for the
[58:48] baby that was once delivered unto the
[58:50] Saints 55 let's just say praise the Lord
[58:52] you believe it he says don't be
[58:54] disturbed
[58:55] he says demons will scream at everything

[59:00] no wonder evil spirits cry out they know
[59:02] their time has come
[59:05] yes amen

[59:13] know there's chief demons a little even
[59:15] this is all Chi demons right yes and of
[59:19] course who is the main who is their
[59:22] leader
[59:23] they're led their main henchman is the
[59:25] devil himself lucifer or satan that
[59:28] great old that that old serpent right
[59:30] right now uncertain sound 61 ether t 1
[59:38] he is now he says but citizen tracking
[59:40] anyway you take it
[59:42] sin is attractive to the human be he
[59:44] says because he the subject of a bond
[59:46] race that we are he says and it's
[59:49] attractive Satan knows how to make it
[59:51] attractive he says he's a genius and his
[59:53] job all right right Satan is an absolute
[59:58] geez one time I was hanging out with the
[1:00:00] man you just come into the Word of God
[1:00:03] he's a big man six foot five six equal
[1:00:09] 36 for
[1:00:11] we're talking about the word and he said
[1:00:15] he said of Satan ever he said he said
[1:00:18] the season of Satan's here right now he
[1:00:19] said I'd knock him knock him right
[1:00:21] knocked a block right off I'm looking
[1:00:24] right now Allah but he was singing this
[1:00:27] he was just trying to make a challenge
[1:00:29] of Satan with his own and strength right
[1:00:32] and you know in two weeks he was back
[1:00:36] out in the world my goodness
[1:00:38] Satan said oh yeah I'll get you I'll get
[1:00:41] you in no time
[1:00:42] that's right what you took him out he's
[1:00:44] never been back since
[1:00:45] not good don't ever think that you're
[1:00:47] more than a match for Ziggler out the
[1:00:50] spirit all right yes sir yes sir he's a
[1:00:53] genius you got a spot but he won't get
[1:00:57] us gain or loss but I ain't gonna here
[1:01:02] yes absolutely
[1:01:04] all right here's a did you know that in
[1:01:07] heaven that the devil was God's
[1:01:08] right-hand man at the beginning he knows
[1:01:12] all about God he knows how God operates
[1:01:15] he knows what God my things like he was
[1:01:19] actually there covering the anointed
[1:01:21] covering cherub you're my closest thing
[1:01:23] that God there was in his creation all
[1:01:25] right I know about yes sir and he had a
[1:01:31] realm
[1:01:36] he said that was loosely for the son of
[1:01:38] mourning was given power and the reason
[1:01:42] he brought sin into the world he was
[1:01:44] able to take something that God created
[1:01:45] and perverted back into an evil thing
[1:01:47] see he's a genius how would he even know
[1:01:51] to prefer concentration he's an absolute
[1:01:55] genius how did he figure that out she's
[1:01:58] a cow part of how they were produced
[1:02:00] move on listen this produce move on this
[1:02:05] is this I'm wearing a word we need in
[1:02:07] his mind when you come up with the idea
[1:02:09] bring the serpent and how would he know
[1:02:12] that would cross three right genius yes
[1:02:16] sir good you must had his little scene
[1:02:19] microscope out there take a little skin

[1:02:28] he figured out how to break the
[1:02:30] continuity gossamer yes drew let me know
[1:02:36] the stage was set it was set for God
[1:02:41] allowed him to figure it out amen
[1:02:44] he must left some kind of clue the Lord
[1:02:47] just didn't take it he'll get it he's a
[1:02:49] something the little irises like this
[1:02:51] one's so close to you like this looks
[1:02:53] just like Adam it must be close to this
[1:02:55] right yes sir that's right
[1:02:58] he says the right-hand man of Almighty
[1:03:00] God was loose with the son of Maury the
[1:03:03] first God granted him almost coworkers
[1:03:05] with him he was a co-worker Satan
[1:03:10] himself help me God
[1:03:13] doing the will of God knowing the will
[1:03:16] of God knowing how God can latch onto
[1:03:19] the heart of a person hold it and just
[1:03:21] obviously knowing how the Word of God
[1:03:24] would come in church services in heaven
[1:03:26] right knowing how to worship Wert in
[1:03:30] heaven ah right right brother he knew
[1:03:33] all these things about the church use
[1:03:36] all these things about God's ways

[1:03:46] could not create right he says God is
[1:03:50] the only creator a Satan took something
[1:03:52] that God created him to run back in
[1:03:54] something else you right amen

[1:04:30] close revelations maybe that's why they
[1:04:33] were the revelry
[1:04:34] you know anything is jumping on it like
[1:04:36] it's a steelbook person it's very
[1:04:38] interesting yes sir Laurie but as you
[1:04:42] read the book a Jew he's warning the
[1:04:46] people in Jude 4 he says where there are
[1:04:49] men certain men crept in unawares he's
[1:04:52] more than a wolf come right but now
[1:04:54] they're in verse 5 he says I want you to
[1:04:57] remember some things keep these things
[1:04:59] in remembrance I will therefore
[1:05:02] therefore put you in remembrance though
[1:05:04] he once knew this how did the Lord
[1:05:07] having saved the people on the land of
[1:05:09] Egypt afterward destroyed them to
[1:05:11] believe not yes he said remember this
[1:05:13] man because of their unbelief he brought
[1:05:18] about and because their unbelief yes yes
[1:05:22] yes Jesus and look at the number two
[1:05:26] things says remember and the angels
[1:05:30] which kept not their first estate but
[1:05:35] left their own habitation he hath
[1:05:40] reserved in everlasting chains under
[1:05:44] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[1:05:46] day why would he warn the efficient age
[1:05:50] this about the Angels leaving that
[1:05:55] refers to say these fallen spirits
[1:06:01] leaving their first estate why he warned
[1:06:02] them if they're not spirit II your man
[1:06:08] we're man we're human we're mortal right
[1:06:09] for something daughters of God what he
[1:06:13] reminds of this he says that the Angels
[1:06:16] was kept not their first estate what was
[1:06:20] it Satan rose up against God up in
[1:06:24] heaven before we were even there there
[1:06:28] was a war in heaven and the Bible says
[1:06:30] the Satan wanted to make his kingdom
[1:06:32] greater than Michaels right and he went
[1:06:35] through these these angels now the
[1:06:38] Angels had a certain place a certain
[1:06:40] portion in heaven that was their
[1:06:42] inheritance they were they were created
[1:06:44] there they're supposed to stay there
[1:06:46] Satan deceive these demons and brought
[1:06:48] them down
[1:06:49] and now other false spirits and they'll
[1:06:51] never ever find their place in there up
[1:06:53] again they're done they have there's no
[1:06:56] way to kill a spirit y'all do not die so
[1:06:59] how can you attain for a spirit cannot
[1:07:01] so the spirits head they lost their home
[1:07:05] but God had a home created for hotel
[1:07:08] look at the drive that's right yeah he
[1:07:11] won't leave him homeless oh ha but he's
[1:07:12] going to make it up he's gonna make it
[1:07:14] oil oh just a little trash yeah sure now
[1:07:19] that word reserved he has reserved in
[1:07:25] everlasting change
[1:07:26] he's fallen angels that were reserved
[1:07:31] means to detain or to keep unmarried now
[1:07:38] he's warning the church Jude is warning
[1:07:41] what he said watch out for these false
[1:07:43] Pritchard he says watch out he don't
[1:07:45] fall from what as the angels fell from
[1:07:49] their first estate yes sir yes sir
[1:07:53] he said because they're reserved up
[1:07:56] today we have unmarried now watch this
[1:08:01] the 2nd Peter 2:4 you got to go go there
[1:08:04] but if God spared not the Angels that
[1:08:06] sinned but cast them down to hell and
[1:08:09] delivered them into chains of Darkness
[1:08:11] to be reserved unto judgement right yes
[1:08:14] now look what he says he's there's only
[1:08:16] one way provided by God for anything 63
[1:08:20] 7 31 2 days after my birthday prays 156

[1:08:26] ought to say it but I but yet I believe
[1:08:31] I ought to say no say he says if you
[1:08:36] notice he says I he noticed Lucifer is

[1:08:53] himself a kingdom which was great
[1:08:55] and more beautiful than Michaels Canyon
[1:08:57] we just said that Christ he says he that
[1:09:01] was that was his ambition to achieve
[1:09:03] something like that and what did he get

[1:09:19] their first estate and he took that to
[1:09:22] do it with he could go by herself he
[1:09:26] needed help right now look what he says
[1:09:30] in the next paragraph and today Lucifer
[1:09:34] has got into the church and taken away
[1:09:38] the word and injected denomination is

[1:16:18] under 51 I'm trying to bring you the
[1:16:20] threefold revelation or mystery of God

[1:16:25] wisdoms and education like eat it for
[1:16:28] the angels did Wesley was a man of God
[1:16:30] but what followed him he says fallen
[1:16:34] angels got into it was the Angels first
[1:16:37] creative beings of God but fell from
[1:16:39] Lucifer's wisdom says and you see what
[1:16:41] they become fully Eagles and
[1:16:43] organizations from men of God who went
[1:16:46] forth to establish truth in the earth
[1:16:47] before the truth to go on and proclaim
[1:16:51] and get on to the real revelation of
[1:16:53] Christ see my regatta slowly bringing
[1:16:57] his horse and he makes a church here a
[1:16:59] mustard fits my messenger gives him the
[1:17:01] word as they stay with the word and the
[1:17:04] messenger brings forth the message to
