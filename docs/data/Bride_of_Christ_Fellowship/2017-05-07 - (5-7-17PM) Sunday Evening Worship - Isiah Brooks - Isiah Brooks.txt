family may a member the end of the only family I have amen I thank God for you pray as I'm staying let us turn about the grace of God to first Kings 18 which God there in that scripture is going to read by God's grace beginning at the 33rd verse we kind of rehearsed a little bit of sales I fuel off a little bit on it earlier this morning body large and mom karma showdown yes and here it says in the 33rd version he put the wood in in Auto and cut the bullocks and pieces and laid him on the wood and said filled four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood now remember force to them yes and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said to do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran the round about the altar and he filled the trench also recorder and it came to pass at the times of the offering of the evening sacrifice that in light of the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel excuse me let it be known as David now I got in Israel and that I am the servant is that I've done all these things that that word hear me o Lord hear me that is this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their hearts back again now remember he's turning the hearts of the children that I had he mentioned the worship of the truth and a living God yeah I just basically said Lord I have said I have done I have done all these things you showed me you told me so that has not he lies his plan this is God's plan amen amen so we understand that his showdown was God showdown yeah it was God versus the devil hey my heart versus failed that's right right image show but we realized how gracious God he feels the stretch he does it a third time and today I like to say Lord do it again because amen it is it is here where the Bible tells us listen he says the 37 first hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that there are the Lord God and thou has turned their hearts gain then the fire of the Lord fell so their heart had been turned back to gain by the word and the instruction of Elijah right hand has been the fire fill right the fire was Hall with all that beautiful beautiful right and assume the burnt offering and the second would choose me and the wood in the stones and the dust is linked up all the water that was in the trench and when the people saw it they fell of their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God it is I just said unto them watch this town take the promise of bail and not not one of them escape hello remember it doesn't take a lot of our era if I want to say like that to be for you too I'll be a minister of the devil right right right because this is all Satan had to do was turn one bird changed one word to God word not you put not there right and he became an enemy to God and if they take away you becoming in it is right and when all the people saw there's they'll see because what thing this is what I love off the Lord to me to me let me finish the scripture and as I said take a prize avail let not one of them escape and they took them and Eliezer brought them down to the brook up keshon and smooth fill there one more scripture please yeah we just go let's go to Exodus Street brings and Exodus 3 are starting at the seventh verse we won't be long this evening by God's grace but but I want you to get to see I want you to really see that that come God is not interested in um a rituals right you know he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and God is not interested in rituals right even though do you like you know truth and you may follow those truth to the tee or to the letter but when you lose love for the truth it becomes a ritual and so you've got to learn how to give your all to that what you know see that's what pleases God this is even in Exodus the 3rd chapter says and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their souls and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a goodly land in a large up to a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the Emirati paradise and Hittites and the Gemini's now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel coming to me and I have also seen the oppression which is just impress them come down therefore and I was sitting there to Pharaoh that thou made rain for my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God Who am I I love that question I love that you know because before you can ever know who God is you must come to know who you are right once you are asked Who am I not given tell you right you never know who you are until you question God Who am I see because the world right now is looking they don't know who they are only the people who question God who out lie God they can respond right Moses said Who am i right behold excuse me uh uh and God said unto Moses let me let me back up I lost money when I come in to Childress your shop excuse me where was I the elders and Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he says suddenly I would be with thee and this shall be a token of the tea that I have set thee with all have brought the forth the children out of Egypt you should serve the God upon this mountain see there was a plea that God want to be served and that was the only place at that time that they could serve God was upon that particular mountain yeah right and Moses editor dr. hall when I come into the children of Israel it says to them the god of your father have sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel I am have sent me unto you now if you understand that Jim because a brother mind when I was a layman he had never been to the voice of God not a just a field and as he passed people on the street he was asking them do you know when the voice of God is and he was wondering what people was looking at the strangeness and it just Donald to them is they don't know that there's a building called the voice of God he is looking quite crazy right see that's just how things go people you don't understand what's out there but never the last thing that we laughed about it and I said see that's that's exactly right with what people don't understand the question they don't know how to answer it right and sometimes you'll question they look it's like your sanity but there's a reality behind it because there is a face right so anyway they asked Moses listen what think about it Moses comes with him and they say well who sent you he said on who shall I tell oh oh Sydney and he says go to him and tell him I am sent me tip it to Pharaoh he couldn't come for him that I am sit you who is I am but see they didn't understand it was I am Moses because Moses was the one bringing the message and was that I am speaking out of Moses right so they look right in the face of God and believe you mean at that time Moses was the face of God right and if Moses was the face of God then what face do you have okay see what you must have we got to come up we got to come up into it around where you must understand that you are becoming God and God is becoming you and wherever you go you are here to declare that God is just like Moses see it doesn't stay with a prophet the people of Israel supposed to have the same testimony and they say oh God all of them did except choice when Kayla they were the only two that could be glad that Jehovah was real right okay let's hurry up living alone see and Moses says I am that I am and he said duh says I'll save the children of Israel I am sent me unto you you know why God said that I am that I am because God can be whoever he wants to be right I am was in Joshua I am was emotions I am challah living was in Caleb I am was in t I am whatever remember even even even in the day of Pentecost when he said this is that right because we can come back that disc is right it was God becoming what that now the I am cake became 120 on the day of Pentecost I want you to see come sing if you don't see your face you she's all right you see for the bad news base everybody know he's the seventh angel what about the bride brother man said the movies on the bride so what is she doing who is she hey let's see somebody and she's here and she's declaring the same god oh we get so excited when you say okay Elijah Elijah supposed to get a double poster I've got a portion of what you're supposed to have a ministry we have a ministry and it's the same I am that stuck into Moses supposed to step into you it's normal we don't have times in the fall backward the bride moves oh it she must move forward right and god Shannon will always oppose it thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob shall have just sent me have sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial to all generation hallelujah the I am right so let's pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your greetings we thank you for your mercy we take your father for being so good to us Lord you have been a bell to us that we've been to ourselves lord I pray that you bless the people help them not help us that we may see the truth of who we are because if we can see who we are your prophets saying Lord that we will become an invincible I help us now that we may spy ourselves in the scripture in Jesus Christ's name we pray you make me see that as we see this you show up well why I was brother Branham preach God in warfare huh he preaches that and he tells us that God mask himself yes yes though how can the bride be there at the white throne judgment as a judge it comes throughout all the ages she held the word yes right hey man is that right because remember now when Jesus went down into the region of the law he asked the question why did not believe my word they could have easily said what we never seen you before but he could have said I am was in Noah I was in North and Noah preached my word 300 was my face no was my say no it was my word and you didn't hear it right in any see it was Jesus Christ God himself ignore preaching to Don in the days of the intermediate world that's right brother Amen right and now God is in well kiss me oh yeah reaching to the world and they will be without excuse yes sir why do you say one word or not God has fixed this world in such a place that specially our women when they walk the streets everybody no gay man yeah but they know this out of your name yes sir yes sir don't you wanna meet this so a literally a living word really and Ray that's vital yes all me Laurie and that's what people do they look at you and they read you aim at a man right so you can understand me what when I'm gone with this because I'm trying to tell us this Jesus had to find his place in the scriptures that the Bible yes the Bible said he came to know who he was by the word yes and when he ran away he saw himself did he the word became one that's what we must tell brother panel did not bring all these powerful quotes about the bride just to make our money of some kind of a sensation there's gotta be a people that can not only uh swallow it but digest it all right gloria right so what do you say I'm trying to say difficult what we have done even in this message because of our approach people go because they're with me because I said this before you might not agree with that time but I really believe that where we got off is when we we took the gospel of Jesus Christ and we made it God sent a prophet right right find me in the scripture anywhere in it in a historical fact with a they stop preaching Jesus Christ and start preaching the Prophet right yes sir it's not their people right if it wasn't that it wasn't a part of the scoop to get box when brother Branham lived on earth in the flesh it was all right to say come see you later right right but who can you say come see now that's right brother young fella I'm trying to say not taking away from that gear I'm not taking away it meant from God sends a property because they needed to know that the voice of a prophet was in the land yes right but now listen what John said he said I'm a decrease that he might like increase so the revelation of John's voice because John has the Holy Ghost so as John preached it wasn't John creature it was a Holy Ghost in a John creature and right so when John ministry was earthly finished Jesus came out of the scene now the voice of God was who Jesus himself a man yeah I don't you must understand that when the Prophet dog he preached he preached it but he left unwrap it the voice of God hey man glory am I making sense yes sir because if you can see what I'm trying to tell you an angle that's the Lord help it is because I know how when you when you a pretty much program to hear it stains a certain way you're very cautious on how is here if somebody bring something a little different but I'm not I'm really telling you the way it should have been right right man what has happened is that people have fallen in love with the Prophet and they love Jesus alone right yes sir yes sir right brother you know and that's what I'm trying to tell you we go with oh oh oh if I was in Nevada that's I'm invited Jesus was hot I would have been there I would have been there but let me tell you something all those religious people believed in the law believed in hoses and when they looked at Jesus he became trash that's exactly what a lot of people in this message do when you see a come to a church and they're really excited about the word that praising God and in washing his feet they called them what Pentecostal and when they said when they said they say it in a way like that's trash all right brother right right hello yes sir now if you don't think that God will not judge people for doing that because he judged brother Branham yeah for greeting with his mother-in-law that's right that's right and he lost his wife and his daughter yes sir I guess what his wife told him will you know what these days are happening and the Holy Spirit has already told him over hi Oh River when he was going over getting ready to go over the waterfall what he had done love remember when you call those people trash he said Lord how did he call him trash my mother-in-law called trash you see them saying but he agreed because he did resist what she said I not a stand against silence is a yes right belly right see and he did not go against her when he should have yes sir am I making sense yes so what I'm trying to tell her tell you is that listen I want you I want you to encourage you read your books listen to the cake read your Bible but you need to stay quiet you can hear from God ah amen glory it must become a personal hear me yes of course that must be personal I'll tell you the truth there are times when I wake up in the morning I said lord give me something that can take me through the day and the Lord said turn this on and so and so it'll be just what I need for the day hey mad key if you talk to him like he's a person that's what brother branham said he said that was the they're friends you must know God as a person and not a fig yes glory hallelujah we're good if we would do for me if I prostrate myself before that picture there are people prostrating yourself before the cloud frustrated lord have mercy sitting they come down on the stretcher all right brother well you know God you know you can only bow before God that's right right hallelujah come on somebody in Anderson listen what Google said in all things he said for some people are trying to do something to look like somebody else or impersonate somebody else because they thought they did you see and I Lord I can't call these preachers names but we have renowned creatures in this message and when we have people who preaches just like these renowned creatures and we don't think that's about it we don't even see where it's wrong but as somehow an impersonation right brother right God hid them say they are impersonating a preacher because he's got it together God is telling and he can do it I can do it and I'm gonna impersonate the way he does it and I get the same result right brother right but we said and say hallelujah never say how y'all give me now I told somebody if I wanted a certain preacher to come preach in that church I would I was sin for that pitch I don't want to hear it right right yes because people is not right but we'll let it go on right because of the excitement in all of these days listen he said listen imprisoning somebody else because they thought they did and you see what it does it brings us back into a ritual and of all again right and I know for certain I've heard people saying you see how the way he preaches you see the way he that the style that he's doing it see so much like the way I bring the word god forbid then with the middle like John challenges just take it sword and slice dice all right right brother y'all make yogi what I'm saying you're not trying to get people to see it at all you're not going to make it to heaven being in my college right you're just not going to make de man I'm going to say that you won't make them the trials and the tribulations of the tribulations but you're not going to make bride because she's can't have one spot that's right my understanding her revelation of the God she served must be pure and clean a man it has to be high and you you cha cha Chi God could entrust things to darling your type of the jar nothing to miss it this down because John understood things that a lot of the other decide many others David because you always made it official man yes sir T and the message the real pride Jesus Christ she don't know who to love him right Jesus listen what he says I shall feel that I spilled it out to a spill it out to the sin God said that he hides let me thirty back up and you see what it does is bring foot back into a religious form again is the blood is the blood the light that electrifies and sanctifies your life that's right I just filled it out this it said God said that he's hiding his face from your prayers you've got your ritualistic form yes it is the truth you're doing what he told you but you're not doing it in sincerity and use fall out day and night but God said your sacrifice is a stick to me and I will not receive it any more when you pray under such condition I hide my face from you God don't want your always time to pray yeah but what do you do when you pray all right amen it's just something that your mom quickly for God when I did my our prayer and I'm okay I let me tell you something if you're praying and watching your watch you're not talking to God right brother right amen you're just wasting your words yes sir because when you talk to God hallelujah you internship because I would say some prayers a travel when you get into prayer you travel in that threat and you lose sight of time hallelujah I can tell you O God by His grace have called out got in the breath and when I get a lot of reps we also ball has already gone that didn't do it so prayer is where you go in and you travel God take you places in prayer that you know he knows when you when you down there just being on ritual you might as well studied all father's prayer he ended up with a period she parted route today because i'ma tell you something this ritual thing that everybody is doing yourself what brother who's a kid he would ever tell you something if it wasn't ritualistic you would not see the people the way they dress changing that's right brother ain't Maddox amen huh because that will hold when style if all the fashion comes meaning right hallelujah realistic it's not a sin sharing you're not sincere I don't when you're brushing your dressing that way because you're amazing dress that way you know that's the way message people ought to dress right but what is real man I was telling somebody the other day I said you remember to your sheet that's naked until you see her when she where there would you can see their shape right brother I home somebody hey oh good we promise me when you solving because we'll see that's right yes amen yes amen you know God so good to us you know I'm looking to say I'm enjoying Jesus and I enjoy being a Christian yes I'm not oh no I gotta be a to another day oh I love yes Hey so I named God's grace when he introduced himself to Abraham he said I'm the god away from him I'll shoot a wing introduce yourself the moment he said I'm the carburetor I'm the car without it I'm the god of pickup but it's trying to shove off I know about you all right so you must realize in an hour telling us a lot of you today I said when we get to heaven they're gonna be our galoshes up there which one will be the right one if you want something real I responded to worship aside ready knock down a bit if he gets the supper saw in the right hand I'm here then how can he be God and I start is right here that's right brother right no God help stop in his hand all right Amanda he's a father God like you a part of God yeah yeah yeah okay a mess God do it again but how he's gonna do it again we must charge back to Jesus Lord I in here so click - that's a wild lady he's been glorifying the ride right right somebody all the pride is this the bride is that the bride is this that's all right but can we how did she become that didn't accomplish she is by herself take me to Calgary holy gosh oh my god sake who says hopefully for thought hey glory Jesus said listen I will receive my own glory and I'm not interested in your glory he's making telling those people he said God ha ha he will give me the global yes but this is what I love about st. John 17th his father let me have that same Lord that I had you with you from the beginning and you know what he tells us that he gives his glory to us now how he gives his glory to us is that when he feels us with this Holy Ghost then we become him here to come us right yeah he became our sin that we might become his righteousness and that glory that we have with them in the beginning now shows up because now the whole Bible said that God of the creation is waiting but the manifestation say waiting and groaning for the sons of God hey man if they have to be better texture the understanding that's what the whole creation is wrong before the manifestations of the sons of God why because the creation know that they will have a revival once we have a revival is because the fall of the creation came out of the fall of late that's right amen really caused by not the thought is restored we will cause it to live a game a whole face would be new reading if you want to say like that because we take a position as the Lord oh the earth again a mad is that ok Laura all throughout all the Bible your membership I will resting in his promises none of us can perform of this we cannot do this except God in us right Jesus said I can't do nothing except the father show me I can do nothing except the father sobbing you can't do nothing except the father Geoghan oh think was off this lady I think she was in out of them Tori what it was his old auntie how her son head was tricking with that done the venereal disease yes and she had done prayed Lord where do you live and I'm not shooting my woman right hallelujah and it says keep praying and the Holy Spirit said let go outside stand by the fifth day and I haven't walked back now if you did not know God you would have wondered what in the world telling me to do such a stupid thing is that I have is a be believing so much she was uh perhaps among other than she should have because God told of that hallelujah she didn't wanna miss her blessing hello's about it have you tried out yourselves your turn what about I don't nobody go message go from God will come at the beginning of the topic or happy in another now I take Papa brother parables he makes me know that you know you gotta listen to God boys you got to be connected up future best on there you gotta be connected young lads yes always hate when you don't have internet connections you got a phone but you can't get connect that's just bad news right oh yeah but what about your connection with God to receive from God you must be connected and hallelujah I don't care how much it blows you are Amen if you will have a servant and put that plug in you just a bad machine but if you got somewhere to tap into that energy you won't happen the end of a special machine company that's how it is with bad prayer is your connection it is your energizer and once you connect anything now you quicker your eye from that a man right and what we think well that's just a story come to probably God but you must understand those stories was told to you so that we would know how to be led by the spirit yeah is that is that not one of the messages he talked about in

them a message or do something because God told me to do something God hear what I'm saying little things that you can get intuited awful little things you began to hear God when it comes to grab things and like I was telling the brother when the doctor said I had cancer and if you went through all this nonsense and all of a sudden my wife said to me we were eating all that nasty food they

only a few say and everything else for serpents did you see it that's right walking with you've got a thoroughbred gals out there alright if God seed is coming to it purity is too far but devil is coming to his cure for the field whatever and to Thor alright now you gonna trust God not how can you not trust God in the day ooh think about what I just said listen so we gone and he said listen God comes along and when he wanted Abraham to do something what did he do he gave Abraham part of his name a from Abraham huh because he's getting ready to show Abraham that your true healthy father is a father and so therefore you will be a father of many nations maybe worse wait for him guess what there was nothing that could stop the promises of elegant but God says if I was going to be he walk now we read about him right here but there are kinds of Abraham as a minute I have wondered about the things that God is talking God goes up he go right also go right he goes back there was so many times that Abraham's akima listen to what God said to write in DNA of time in in trouble who came to deliver him I went you must be see well i'ma tell you something sometimes she'd even tell lies did I ever help sell a lot that's right right right what did he tell her I saw because he was afraid come on somebody and you don't you think about it and there was God protected him all the time why because God gave him an unconditional covenant hey man you'll say God protect you oh I'm so holier-than-thou the time because he gave you all today yes amen you know you're better than nobody else other than God gave us a promise yes sir for this call I also found my knees are to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ now - do you think that is a Miss Creek in the Bible he pause understood who he was worshiping yes - the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth it made God don't worship you but I do rush up the dog that's in you that's right amen oh you can say when I give all the to you I'm giving honor to the God that's in you but I respect you I'm respecting the God that's in you know what I'm saying you know get up like you've heard people say when Jesus arrived into Jerusalem that donkey was just so proud all they just screaming at me whoo the donkey got confused that's how I'm screaming for the donkey right right and then when Jesus got off the donkey there was no more screaming in all of that and he says all monies and stop spirits at every time you Jesus leave you that's what happens oh it's right in it yes sir hey man they wouldn't let me live who peed okay but I'm just trying to bring the reality if the brother branham who was the greatest preacher of our any could be so humble right so meek and so lowly Oh that's what I love about him y'all see me now hey Carol you know I love that because brother man not only was a prophet but he was a man yeah and he enjoys being a man he did he laughed he played joking on him saying he was ready he went some scholar some stuck-up selling you know with some type thing around his neck and looking down at you like you need more education right he was right as a group you know I hear some things on record and I don't know whether it's all true but I like yes oh I don't feel so bad you know I know God told me for the seals you got they gotta be more consecrate you know and that's what it is we must be goal consecrated yes for me for us to see what God wants us to do agree you got to be more consecrated always yes sir our of consecration may God help me see if we look at this thing's all brother what are you trying to say what I'm trying to say is that if you are you 94 Christ you ought to act like you're not United with Christ right man let me ask you a question and I know this might sound strange what is Rebecca she left ELISA with the camera trained what if she would win it - Isaac's chant she's oh that Eloisa is something Oh Eloisa so either Ella eat all the things that he told me le either told me by now how do you think I do feel that in his presence all you talked about with him that's right really right now how did you take God feel that in his presence all you think talk about his dealings right brother right see what I'm saying it's simple it's right there in the bar yes yes and he was one to do something I'm getting I've got a study I'm working on here come the bride because you find out that the man that introduced the prior to his husband uh uh you know he moves out of the way yes yes right once the father and we're and mr. father dr. gospel for us and when he moves out of the way yeah buddy you got seen the show now is on the bride and the bridegroom is right he goes and he takes you see y'all you know say yes because now we don't belong to him anymore we have now been given over and that's what Paul saying he said I fear lest you be to God like et boss Yeah right but I feel fearful because I'm afraid you want to be seduced like is a eight loss amen yes I see what was it does he it happened that she was the power because she believed one word that wasn't right that's right right then who was the preacher serpent the devil hmm impulses you've got to be careful now because this gelatin that transformed himself into light let me case something I personally I don't have nothing to do with preachers in this message who's against the Holy Ghost right brother right no well that's too much emotions you don't just I had a brother tell me ah maybe basically separated me from him because he said you know what for the books you know you preach the Holy Ghost like people gotta have all those emotions and you know you you to put too much emphasis on only emotions and I thought yeah I do you know what and it's going to ever forever be that way ma because the early church started on with emotions yes sir yes got the Holy Ghost we will never know that they jumped out of widows and ran down the street screaming he's alive he's alive and let it set for the bedroom told us and that right right brother I ain't you don't react on discrete cities pop you talk about emotions how many of us been filled with old ago so much we jumping out windows right brother right yo heal them say yeah nothing took place what else people talk to these people with trunk with no why hey what is concealed they were acting out normal yeah right yeah yes and let me tell you something I guess I come from the old school I believe the main truly repent like brother ramjet at the time of that baptism God would gift in the Holy Ghost right baby but you know what a lot of people don't know what the in right brother hopefully now explains a tour that's right we never told him what we business only in their minds and no they thinking they were pissing from just these little things but what about all the stuff that's locked in your sub-conscience alright alright see you got the easy all that up you got the ex-con you know what Sidney cleans everything up amen oh wait who your life and God again cleanse you and feel you hey yeah bar you can't be true thought of you not to yourself that's right that's right brother but people don't get it and so as you go along in this message you hear a little something here there's something there Oh Lord forgive me I'm so sorry so you make up forevers a pity you for every pity for every kitchen and all of that stuff but if you had known at the beginning you could have made it one shot one time at the altar right right giving it out to God one time y'all hear what I'm saying yes sir yes sir and it's not the people's fault is the preachers fault right brother how many times you've heard of necessary repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you know why we don't preach that cuz ain't nobody in here to repeat hateful business think about it colorblock y'all girls are not just good but in my charge the same as ever watch they should make an altar call how many I'm gonna let win the last you seem really broken up people right when the last you've been broken right brother right know himself what is it that keeps us from Wheaton before the Lord yes sir you know just that spirit they say is to pillock also to something to something and then we've sometimes build up a conflict like it's wrong right I don't care what y'all think I look like I could look like a monkey in distress amen I when I cry I cry you don't say right yeah whoopee but this is my soul and that's the way you got to look at it this is goes all right I don't know you got yes sure David well oh lord please don't let me be one of those that follow Moses and didn't get the revelation that was what was happening with Moses don't let me follow this message and not north of God that's it the message right I need to know him he knows me but I need to know him then a display don't let these people think because you look look these scriptures and know what brother branham said you go go speaking through the city hallelujah God told Nicodemus you must be born again that's right I have it amen is that right yes I can explain to you now my son though he doesn't say anything when we were we were in the belly of the mother when I use this all the time in my mother's womb I didn't need my hands I didn't heed my eyes I didn't eat my mouth I didn't even on of these facilities that I have not why because she was my mouth she fed me she was my hand she was my feet she did everything for me she used her body for me I they see right in that world but I was fooled I was being formed and shaped for the world to come hell you don't say because in this world I leave in my hands I needed my eyes I needed my mouth and it's a palette that I needed yes while I was your network in my mother's womb I didn't need them what do you think that God killed tells Nicodemus you must be born again cuz flesh and blood with knowledge into the kingdom really things that we have will not be of no use yes you don't need that we won't be working by the sweat of our brow everything that we dominica mean by the word that's what will happen we will be the spoken word really Brendan said this rod has potential to actually speak a word in existence and go literally right better right hallelujah and then one brother said it to brother Brendan said listen let me ask you something do you

his creator yes yeah what's the creator's line those animals and what Nathan a man right that's all he could do it see oh yeah if we could just see what God is taking on we got to stop being just me

accountable I have to keep it straight yes hey man I gotta give an account of garlic gonna judge me one day yes sir and I have to say Lord I did it the best I know how you don't mean I don't want to cut corners I don't cut corners on my own children I tell them the truth now they grow whether they do or not that's up to them but they will say God get up God my daddy never told me true that's right I tell them to to whether they like it or not right mmm I know y'all think I'm crazy the other day my my grandchildren if in this getting where out I said listen my daughter's dead I said I'm gonna stop my grandchildren for coming by my house she got the message if you came through your children in my house don't bring them here to tear it up stay home and treat you can come straight right she didn't come by the next day it's okay cuz I know she can take it you know what it is you don't know say hey right people of God we got to know what's right and what's wrong and we can't you know 60 others at my old praise God I got holy just stepping all over me no Christians hey Christians aren't cowards right right brother what we need to start doing is his large helping correct this individual in the crop oh yes yes we're good word hey man and when Jesus mother when she said when she said your father not he said woman right he was disrespectful he corrected it that's right right and that's what we need to stop let everybody see what everyone's saying we just sitting there like lord have mercy God saying with you gonna say something big right you go tell them to hey bad they need to be corrected with me there yes let me go when I got off on something I'm sorry let me finish this quote is that Alright yes not let you go I will just jump down is where I want to go to paragraph 257 is to see you said like on Mount Transfiguration all the prophets and everything else is finished all the days of the luqman you can understand that cover all the days of America this we can understand they didn't hear all of the Presbyterians we can understand but we can understand this part all the all the prophet and everything else is distended we can't understand never we can understand the Lutheran the Methodist of the Presbyterians you know that they things boom but she prevention is there all right he said they're all right this is my beloved here to him the word of this hour the word of the seals with all the mystery garland that's been here all these years bill is he's a Great Pyramid of Pi we're streaking off he's at the headstone making home down so that the star David was settled into his place and in the great Church of the Living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle has out yonder into the glory and what people don't understand is that until the product yes in place Israel cannot get in place yes your honor I mean we watch it Israel but we must understand the bride must be going Israel gets in place right so she can't give it place until we get it big the star then it cannot sell down in Israel and the real cat with the period and going out of here all right once you Israel all he won't you but the bride must come to what she's supposed to be before Israel can make the next move right hey madness is that okay yes she effect which means if you go back you're on the island authority the charge will come through this is uh this is another quote uh when I'm ending it here the church will come to justification to lose them truce education through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into perfection of the son of man listen that we need husband and wife will be the same self person God would be so manifested in his bride his church till they will be the same they are one how now now you see will react see what I'm saying he said this is what you gotta understand this is your goal this is your objective this is your press this is what you you pushing impressing to become seeing the son of man so much in you which is Christ in you the hope of glory to you in Christ of what yes not potentially in reality yes he's up the Lord I hope you did get something for what was preached because we're Westing on his promises you and I can't bring these thing to pass but because he has spoken these thing God himself through Jesus Christ amen has spoken these things and you and I we cannot come back bored but what they the Lord show me enclosing some prophecies will get settled me but different people how long even know who they are to this day but I would say well if it happens it just happens and that's it that's the wrong attitude when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive everybody's winning in Great Expectations waiting for the promises and add hundreds of years before Christ ever came to the temple and there was only the rest I'm waiting that's right right see we suppose with the prophecy together we supposed to wait with expectation watch we're supposed to pray and look for the Hathaway in us yes Amen right so you and I must take this word and say okay this is all of the things that were said about the bride of Jesus bride I'm kind of looking at watch Lord let this happen Lord let this happen Lord let this be in me let this be me you asking God right to let the word that was spoken be found manifested in you yeah cuz you be needed a man marry when the never had Jesus if she didn't would have believed the angel that's right brother right but she can't believe the prophecy of an angel amen right look what happened to Zechariah when he didn't believe now I made him dumb that's right that's right that's right so God expect us to believe the prophecies and look with expectation for the prophecy to be manifested in us we don't have to rule them there you live in Jerusalem that the prophecy must come forth in and through and by yeah God hey man I'm done folks I hope you bit less yes I tried to pull my heart out to you you know English words I wish I knew another language to talk to you I'm so so confound by by the English language that's all that go but I still feel so compelled I feel like there's more to it and in let's say God there's more to it it's too short of a word and then it convenient anything I just can't stand it up with I can't how to wait till we get that original language that can spread God the way I won't whatever it is I believe that the English press colleagues actually the way I want to it you'll know it and I'm loading would be glorious folk art is so real hey man he's real people loving with all your heart yes G we all fall short but understand God said there's no condemnation that those who walk not after the flesh we try to walk after the spirit and you understand when God is in you there's no condemnation how can he come him you if he's living in right he's already approved you you don't wait for a second from he's already approved you ain't mad please God listed our Lord Jesus Jesus G
