[34:54] under the other that's why we live our

[34:59] your God so here a fresh nor we lay
[35:02] ourselves freshly as a living sacrifice
[35:05] upon your altar Marco
[35:08] upon your word we know Jesus Lord you
[35:12] taught that Lord is the altar or that
[35:15] purifies the sacrifice so Lord here we
[35:20] are we're purified in your presence by
[35:23] your word the washing of your word
[35:25] through the Holy Spirit father we love
[35:28] you we thank you Lord God we come to
[35:30] sacrifices now transform our minds that
[35:33] a sword passed underneath all that would
[35:35] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[35:37] God and transform us by the renewing of
[35:41] our minds today father and we might
[35:43] praise you and love you and worship you
[35:45] in this present world or God read it
[35:48] Lord Jesus as were established and
[35:50] present truth let us receive from your
[35:53] Holy Spirit today we thank you Lord for
[35:55] all your blessings
[35:56] bless His Word we're about to read
[35:58] if we get into our hearts in Jesus
[36:00] Christ let's take our Bibles here
[36:06] let's start with our scripture here
[36:08] we'll be down at Philippians chapter one
[36:13] memory verse let me in Shepherd 1 verse
[36:29] 7 here I got some grace 7 8 h.d how's
[36:38] everything with the sound this is okay
[36:39] thank you
[36:40] it means 1 7 8 9 I'll just read this
[37:01] myself here verse 7 8 9
[46:52] these men that were you know keeping her
[46:54] in slave they could pay and then she
[46:56] would prophesy by demon power and I
[46:58] wasn't real prophesying his demons guess
[47:00] to me right but because they can figure
[47:02] out thing and they they could say what's
[47:03] going to happen to my mama then the
[47:05] woman with the demon powers could tell
[47:07] them I think my mi come to pass and they
[47:10] were making a lot of
[47:19] you
[48:09] the devil hastily expose a then we must
[48:20] you
[50:33] for once could be described by the unit
[50:36] and Paulette have access he would had to
[50:39] pay somebody and he would have to stand
[50:41] there I think it's beautiful
[50:43] you'd have to stand there and say write
[50:46] this and he'd get under the Holy Spirit
[50:48] you stand there and just let the Holy
[50:51] Spirit lead and my god what to say
[50:54] amen and so it's the Holy Spirit all
[50:57] would say Oh first
[51:07] you
[55:47] purchased and vilified so inaudible Oh
[55:50] God with joy outbreak just let the
[55:53] church continue let them get more so
[55:54] saved my let's some of this
[56:54] place going on on the outside right I
[56:57] got to dress the right way and make sure
[56:59] I grow my hair long
[57:00] I make sure thank God the barbers up and
[57:01] knock to get a haircut but a lot of
[57:04] times does message people that they
[57:06] initially come in but then they only let
[57:08] God work on the outside church the
[57:11] message has to change us from the ends
[57:21] you
[1:07:01] raise god your lies are the verification
[1:07:05] that Jesus Christ is still are they men
[1:07:17] you
[1:10:06] to fight for the truth I wonder who
[1:10:08] would defend it
[1:10:09] I wonder who would it be a coward and
[1:10:11] run away from all the arguments praise
[1:10:14] God
[1:10:15] who can I get to fight against evil
[1:10:17] spirits and doctrines of devils I wonder
[1:10:20] who could I'll get that kook knows you
[1:10:22] how about him I need somebody to defend
[1:10:27] and argue for the truth of the message I
[1:10:30] wonder who could do it churches should
[1:10:32] be all of us praise knock hey
[1:10:48] bading that remember I'm not saying
[1:10:50] argue with the evil spirit but all of I
[1:10:53] was that Paul would stand and he would
[1:10:55] proclaim in synagogues and he would he
[1:10:58] would explain the God Lord and try to
[1:11:00] tell him the truth
[1:11:09] you
[1:11:32] I bet myself I will tell you everything
[1:11:34] this is why I do this work but how about
[1:11:36] the Gospel race God
[1:11:44] you
[1:12:55] I got some problems but I'm going to go
[1:12:57] there I'm gonna have to answer any but
[1:12:59] I'm gonna do it real home last time we
[1:13:03] had a brother leave the church by oh I'm
[1:13:04] talking about them
[1:15:09] I really believe it I want everybody
[1:15:12] think I'm a good brother but I know they
[1:15:14] need to love that right Jose I love
[1:15:19] everybody think really good about me but
[1:15:21] I don't Satan is trying to rip our
[1:15:22] church
[1:15:26] now you get better we're supposed to get
[1:15:29] a humble grace guy we're supposed to
[1:15:31] seek God well what is the answer about
[1:15:33] that's why our peoples from what is the
[1:15:36] answer and so when it comes to you they
[1:15:38] say what do you think brother you'll
[1:15:39] have said this
[1:18:11] now verse 9 intent is such a beautiful
[1:18:15] prayer church so what was Paul praying
[1:18:19] he was praying for joy remember he was
[1:18:21] suffering with joy he would be so happy
[1:18:24] brain thank god there's those churches
[1:18:26] and philip i bless of bishops and then
[1:18:29] deacons
[1:18:29] thank you lord i want to see them so bad
[1:18:33] but then here he tells us more when he's
[1:18:36] Frankel let's see if he's praying them
[1:18:43] that God will make them millionaires
[1:18:44] let's see if God will give them every
[1:18:50] fleshly desire let's see if Paul's prank
[1:18:52] them to have meats and cheeses and good
[1:18:55] wines all praying for them since hit
[1:18:58] nods to people since his heart is in
[1:19:01] Jesus's heart we know that what Paul's
[1:19:05] prayer will be is the Heart of Jesus or
[1:19:08] then whatever proposed praying for
[1:19:13] that's what Jesus would have wanted them
[1:19:15] to have to because his heart was unified
[1:19:19] in Jesus's heart now I'm gonna pull some
[1:19:27] rope without of this app it's called a
[1:19:29] sword I don't walk the Greek because I
[1:19:31] didn't I didn't get this one Greek
[1:19:32] definition here helps me to understand
[1:19:35] it and I know YouTube as well by God's
[1:19:37] grace verse yeah verse 9 verse 9 and
[1:19:48] this I pray that your love may abound
[1:19:51] now what's the word about a mean church
[1:19:53] it means super about superfluous to be
[1:20:00] abundant to be enough and to have some
[1:20:04] spare leftover to be better to excel or
[1:20:10] exceed remain over and above so Paul
[1:20:17] prays that you have this superfluous
[1:20:20] overflowing what
[1:20:22] your baby gotta know that your love may
[1:20:28] about get more and more in the knowledge
[1:20:33] I'm sorry in knowledge and in all
[1:20:38] judgment what did Paul want you to have
[1:20:42] a what did Paul want your cup
[1:20:44] overflowing with you missed two things
[1:20:48] here he said through love so if you have
[1:20:51] a lot of love for Jesus you're
[1:20:53] overflowing these things so love of God
[1:20:55] produces it knowledge and all judgment
[1:20:59] oh you can't buy that at Walmart it's
[1:21:04] not available on Amazon you can read a
[1:21:07] book and get some good night that's it
[1:21:09] we've got to make sure that book lines
[1:21:10] up with this model what would a prophet
[1:21:15] pray for God give them you give them
[1:21:21] this and this and that he said God give
[1:21:23] them abounding overflowing love that we
[1:21:27] would see by growing in knowledge and in
[1:21:31] all judgment will knowledge of what what
[1:21:37] do we need to know more about church
[1:21:38] God's work praise God you ever find
[1:21:44] yourself like I'm reading through dirty
[1:21:45] Robby right now you ever find yourself
[1:21:47] it's like you forgot about this powerful
[1:21:49] scripture you could have used and like I
[1:21:52] could have used that like last week
[1:21:55] happens to me all the time I remember I
[1:21:58] preached at how did I forget that we're
[1:22:01] constantly learning new things but then
[1:22:04] we're also forgetting some of the
[1:22:06] knowledge so all silent you costly
[1:22:08] overflowing with knowledge searching
[1:22:11] we're not reading our Bibles more
[1:22:12] something's wrong with us because Paul
[1:22:16] said I don't want you having just a
[1:22:17] little trickle of Bible reading and
[1:22:19] knowledge he said I want you to have a
[1:22:21] overflowing Bible knowledge now
[1:22:27] at this point in my life I'm doing more
[1:22:29] Bible research I read my chapter every
[1:22:31] morning and night but then I'll do
[1:22:33] research and studying the Bible and
[1:22:35] passes and and writing about the
[1:22:37] scripture and that just keeps me
[1:22:41] meditating in God's Word so it's like
[1:22:43] all day long for three or four after
[1:22:45] nomina for three or four hours every day
[1:22:46] I'm just stuck in the scripture it's
[1:22:48] just constantly the Word of God and I
[1:22:50] like that phrase I can tell and I'm not
[1:22:51] gonna do it can you tell what you don't
[1:22:53] do it can you tell what it feels like
[1:22:56] your cuffs we're not overflowing your
[1:22:58] repiy you like that but Paul says this
[1:23:02] is my prayer that the Saints will be so
[1:23:05] filled with love that the knowledge will
[1:23:07] abound it'll superfluous it'll it'll
[1:23:10] flow out of them in knowledge and all
[1:23:14] judgment that's why I mentioned in the
[1:23:19] church of you years ago
[1:23:20] once are few more weeks ago if you don't
[1:23:23] have a Bible reading journal you
[1:23:25] probably need to get one if you're not
[1:23:28] meditating on God's Word and and
[1:23:30] learning more about the word that's not
[1:23:33] good now for me I don't have a journal I
[1:23:36] have a highlighter and markers and I
[1:23:38] just write all over my Bibles yeah do
[1:23:41] you want to see it I just go back and do
[1:23:45] that because if you're just doing a
[1:23:47] chapter to check it off your list that
[1:23:48] torito you really haven't fellowship
[1:23:50] with God are you really growing in
[1:23:52] knowledge with God and then while you're
[1:23:55] reading is something if the Lord put
[1:23:57] somebody on your heart pray for pray for
[1:24:03] you find a question sent me a text reads
[1:24:06] ssme need me I'd like to hear your
[1:24:08] questions we can do a question and
[1:24:10] answer service but Paul's prayer is that
[1:24:13] these Holy Ghost film message believers
[1:24:16] will have a bouncing knowledge so they
[1:24:19] can touch all things I try to reward it
[1:24:26] this morning as I'm Paul prays for their
[1:24:29] growth in love that knows and judges
[1:24:33] everything and it approves only things
[1:24:38] that are holy
[1:24:41] this maintains sincerity and
[1:24:43] blamelessness now with my family and
[1:24:47] with seven children I'm doing this all
[1:24:49] the time our nine children
[1:24:51] I'm trying to improve good YouTube
[1:24:52] videos or bad you too or disapprove bad
[1:24:55] YouTube videos that's right that's
[1:24:58] that's one area I can see end with music
[1:25:00] - constantly oh you heard this new song
[1:25:06] Oh check this out here's a link to a
[1:25:08] YouTube video and I found them the you
[1:25:11] know the more technology we get the more
[1:25:13] approving approving or disapproving we
[1:25:17] gotta do
[1:25:17] it's alright Church hey look guys it's
[1:25:20] making it late on Facebook at YouTube
[1:25:22] with all the thumbs up and thumb down
[1:25:24] those thumbs up and thumbs downs may be
[1:25:26] a witness against people on the day of
[1:25:28] judgment or witness for because Paul
[1:25:32] said you need to grow and be able to
[1:25:35] either prove something or disapprove
[1:25:39] that was his prayer not not that we
[1:25:43] should just say oh I don't know how to
[1:25:44] put on the show if we're saying we're
[1:25:46] putting it on the shelf every time our
[1:25:47] shelf is gonna break right there's only
[1:25:50] so much room on the shelf in Church of
[1:25:54] my life more and more has come off the
[1:25:57] shelf where God is giving me answers now
[1:25:59] do people to agree with me all done of
[1:26:01] course not but it makes sense to me
[1:26:03] God's gonna need a piece about like the
[1:26:05] trumpet's or the Feast of Trumpets or a
[1:26:08] marriage of divorce or whatever there
[1:26:10] are things that we're up on the shelf
[1:26:12] have now come down they're not on the
[1:26:14] Shelf anymore oh it's finished and that
[1:26:19] was post prayer so that we would know
[1:26:21] more and be able to judge the right
[1:26:23] things did you all know that you're all
[1:26:29] a bunch of judges did you know that
[1:26:32] you've got a gamble you've got a
[1:26:35] spiritual gamble you're all dressed in
[1:26:38] your judges robes today
[1:26:40] I can either gonna approve or disapprove
[1:26:42] of this sermon like several programs
[1:26:45] said you're either going to be a better
[1:26:46] Christian when you believe or not it's
[1:26:48] good that right usually an approve say
[1:26:51] Amen
[1:26:52] or rather think about something else I'd
[1:26:56] rather just go back to drifting along
[1:26:58] life's solemn main just drifting rather
[1:27:02] than happening the direction how many
[1:27:04] want to be directed to holiness praise
[1:27:05] God
[1:27:06] that was false prayer he said I want you
[1:27:09] to bow and just have more knowledge in
[1:27:11] the Word of God and more more judgment
[1:27:15] about what's good what's not what was
[1:27:22] the last time everybody read Philippians
[1:27:23] in the book anybody really lately you've
[1:27:25] been a long time since I read it's not
[1:27:27] really gonna join it
[1:27:29] anybody read lately good he's got nice
[1:27:32] review and this is what we stay we're
[1:27:36] resting on as a pastor I'm resting on
[1:27:43] you getting more knowledge and you're
[1:27:46] resting on me the same that's right
[1:27:49] we're resting on them aren't we
[1:27:51] I'm resting on you getting more
[1:27:53] knowledge about the word and also being
[1:27:56] able to judge things better at your home
[1:27:59] the songs you listen to the YouTube
[1:28:01] videos you watch or Facebook videos you
[1:28:03] watch I'm trusting that the pray you're
[1:28:07] throwing that and outgrowing that the
[1:28:12] many times for us will hear a song and
[1:28:14] the song has good lyrics make too much
[1:28:17] rock and roll lot right and that's where
[1:28:20] you guys don't listen to that version
[1:28:22] listen to a good gospel version of it
[1:28:25] praise God like there's different
[1:28:28] musicians I really enjoy but sometimes
[1:28:31] they just get to over in the rock'n'roll
[1:28:32] side and they gotta look it up our
[1:28:34] temperatures just hypocrite Church does
[1:28:36] a good job on music they'll take the
[1:28:39] same song that was the music was the
[1:28:42] wrong way and give it the right music
[1:28:44] and people are screaming shouting
[1:28:45] praises alrighty then hallelujah is the
[1:28:49] song the words a message of the solemn
[1:28:52] was more knowledge of
[1:28:54] but then the worldly Church the foolish
[1:28:56] person kind of perverted it with the
[1:28:58] rock-and-roll message right the style
[1:29:00] but then the real Church of God can
[1:29:03] bring it through and judge it right and
[1:29:04] bring the right message with the right
[1:29:06] style that's right and you know this is
[1:29:12] the time where we have so much time for
[1:29:13] YouTube and Facebook right you can't go
[1:29:17] I can't go to this you can't go to that
[1:29:18] there's not disclosed this is closed
[1:29:20] that's closed have you got closer to God
[1:29:23] through this time or further away
[1:29:24] well that walls prayer was that you get
[1:29:26] closer to God that was his that's what
[1:29:29] I've seen I just talked with a mentor
[1:29:31] brother man last week I was saying I've
[1:29:34] got nothing but blessings through this
[1:29:36] coronavirus time the only bad thing is
[1:29:38] that my briskets or because I'm doing
[1:29:41] all the schooling online and that mouse
[1:29:44] hurts my wrists I feel like sometimes
[1:29:45] getting carpal tunnel but I got to
[1:29:47] review that in Jesus name that's the
[1:29:51] only bad thing about this coronavirus so
[1:29:53] far because remember church
[1:29:56] it's just crow the virus is just a
[1:29:58] little bit worse than the flu the last
[1:30:01] number I saw was an eighty-five thousand
[1:30:03] Americans have died in the worst flu
[1:30:05] season in recent years has been 71
[1:30:07] thousand Americans have died so it's
[1:30:10] it's bad it's just a little bit worse
[1:30:12] than the flu and you know then there's
[1:30:17] arguments that yo they're reporting flu
[1:30:20] deaths as coronavirus they're kind of
[1:30:22] putting all the deaths into the growing
[1:30:24] preference but who knows but this was
[1:30:31] Paul's prayer and this is what we're
[1:30:34] resting on so this is what we want to
[1:30:36] grow in and that's my church it doesn't
[1:30:42] matter to meet the church grows or not
[1:30:44] that doesn't matter but if the church
[1:30:46] isn't growing in knowledge and the
[1:30:48] church isn't growing in judgment and
[1:30:50] then there's something really problem
[1:30:51] then it doesn't matter if you grow
[1:30:53] physically it's is that the point is
[1:30:56] that you grow spiritually how many
[1:30:58] believe that it's all right because the
[1:31:03] Bible says in Acts chapter two million
[1:31:04] that the Lord added to the church
[1:31:06] such as would be saved I can't add to
[1:31:09] the church right you get out of the
[1:31:12] church the Lord has to add to the church
[1:31:15] and like Peter said with this tax for
[1:31:17] men add to your faith virtue so the
[1:31:19] spiritual part is up to you and I so if
[1:31:25] you could write somebody after 11 years
[1:31:26] what would you tell them what would your
[1:31:29] prayer be for that but you never seen
[1:31:31] them for 11 years I haven't seen Wendy
[1:31:32] for 2 months what would I write here's
[1:31:36] what pollard right after 11 over a
[1:31:38] decade is passed it's been a decade he
[1:31:43] said I pray that your cup will run over
[1:31:47] with knowledge about God's Word and
[1:31:50] you'll be able to judge even more things
[1:31:56] did you know even in education I'm a
[1:31:58] schoolteacher
[1:31:58] I learned in college the highest form of
[1:32:03] thinking there's many and there's
[1:32:05] factual thinking you know what the
[1:32:06] highest form is judgment it is the
[1:32:12] highest form of thinking is judging a
[1:32:16] topic
[1:32:18] anybody can squirt out the fact that the
[1:32:23] Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863
[1:32:26] anybody can squirt that out but was it
[1:32:28] right and then defend it how do you know
[1:32:31] it was right judge it all right anybody
[1:32:34] anybody knows the first president was
[1:32:36] George Washington right but judge what
[1:32:41] kind of president what does joy okay now
[1:32:43] we're getting to some higher thank you
[1:32:44] now and so is Paul saying let your minds
[1:32:50] take a break just let anything into your
[1:32:52] mind that you want and it's okay doctor
[1:32:55] judge it was Paul saying that your mind
[1:32:58] lazy or make your mind more sharp what
[1:33:00] was he saying sure make your mind more
[1:33:05] sharp that you can judge everything
[1:33:08] that's trying to get into your home
[1:33:11] everything that's trying to get into
[1:33:13] your church I can tell you're enjoying
[1:33:16] this praise God y'all looking at me like
[1:33:18] a razor sharp like a razor
[1:33:21] praise God so that would be his prayer
[1:33:27] grow with knowledge so you're aware of
[1:33:30] what the scripture says and then grow in
[1:33:33] your ability to judge and he says if you
[1:33:38] do this no there's many times I can see
[1:33:40] you know you can see an are live student
[1:33:42] anyways life you can tell what people
[1:33:43] are really sincere serving God are not
[1:33:45] right and that's what Paul says if you
[1:33:49] are growing in knowledge about the word
[1:33:54] and you're judging things you will stay
[1:33:57] sincere before God that's what he says
[1:34:01] verse 9 I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:34:09] verse 10 that ye may approve or test
[1:34:12] right approve things that are excellent
[1:34:16] that ye may be sincere and without
[1:34:23] offence till the day of Christ so if you
[1:34:27] are constantly growing in the word and
[1:34:29] loving more about sermons and loving
[1:34:32] reading your Bible right now I'm living
[1:34:33] researching I can find quotes here I can
[1:34:36] find scriptures there I'll just love it
[1:34:38] I feel like I'm growing all the time
[1:34:39] I can't we can preach it to you too I
[1:34:41] that's good I'm really enjoying it if
[1:34:46] you're not feeling like that that you
[1:34:48] lose your sincerity and then you start
[1:34:51] doing things that you're guilty of and
[1:34:53] you should be blamed for it right is it
[1:34:57] if it's the opposite if it's the
[1:34:59] opposite you'll be blameless and sincere
[1:35:02] so the effects of not judging everything
[1:35:05] and growing in knowledge you become
[1:35:07] insincere and you deserve to be blamed
[1:35:10] so this is a Prophet's prayer what about
[1:35:17] brother man would pray for me wonder
[1:35:19] what holiday for me right here then you
[1:35:22] will grow in your knowledge of God's
[1:35:24] Word and then you'll be able to judge
[1:35:27] even more things this is right this is
[1:35:30] wrong that's right that's wrong
[1:35:35] and you will remain sincere if you're
[1:35:39] growing in your knowledge and then your
[1:35:41] judgment
[1:35:42] now just we'll get to this event but
[1:35:45] right now I'm writing on this in the
[1:35:46] book there's going to be a section on in
[1:35:47] the next clip by God's grace he polishes
[1:35:51] knowledge and then discernment now in
[1:35:57] this case Paul's not talking about the
[1:36:00] gifts of the Holy Spirit but every
[1:36:02] Christian should have some form of
[1:36:04] wisdom knowledge faith now not everybody
[1:36:07] has divine healing gifts not everybody
[1:36:10] works miracles Paul said it remember not
[1:36:13] everybody prophesize but everybody
[1:36:16] should have on some level of judgment
[1:36:18] because he says all of you need to grow
[1:36:19] in judgment so see some of these
[1:36:21] spiritual attributes everybody will have
[1:36:23] if they're born again right not
[1:36:26] everybody will speak with tongues now
[1:36:29] that everybody will interpret tongues
[1:36:30] now we know that today right he's not
[1:36:33] many people speak with tongues today
[1:36:35] right not everybody knows miracles but
[1:36:39] everybody's for sure has gifts now but
[1:36:43] everybody has for sure a portion of
[1:36:45] wisdom knowledge faith and discernment
[1:36:49] in your character and Paul says invest
[1:36:53] in it grow in it don't get lazy with it
[1:36:59] right don't get lazy no don't fall away
[1:37:04] from it grow in it don't wither away
[1:37:06] from God's presence draw to it praise
[1:37:10] now let's feed you praise the Lord
[1:37:13] grow in God's grace and now to the Lord
[1:37:18] let me spend time here I'll give me 10
[1:37:20] minutes up close here see look at how it
[1:37:24] goes like that how does our six minutes
[1:37:25] already can you buddy then no I can't
[1:37:28] believe it
[1:37:29] now the next word this servant is to
[1:37:33] grow it in all judgment so this is a
[1:37:35] discernment now see church we're growing
[1:37:38] in discernment but we do not judge the
[1:37:41] destinies of people's souls that's where
[1:37:43] we get name-caller right that's where we
[1:37:45] get bitterness
[1:37:47] that's where you get church splits right
[1:37:49] that's ready to get arguments with
[1:37:50] preachers all the time Paul of course is
[1:37:56] emphasizing the Holy Spirit and I didn't
[1:37:59] mean to that that's actually wrong he
[1:38:01] wasn't emphasizing the gifts he's
[1:38:02] emphasizing the attributes of all these
[1:38:05] for like this sermon knowledge I should
[1:38:07] I
[1:38:07] that's a mistake so Paul says I want you
[1:38:12] to have overflowing discernment to know
[1:38:15] right and wrong now go back to Hebrews 5
[1:38:20] 10 this is familiar actually you know
[1:38:22] yeah you got your BIOS but I can pull it
[1:38:26] my god no I don't so you'll have to read
[1:38:28] it sorry I thought that has here's 5 10
[1:38:30] a lot of people said my brother or they
[1:38:34] you know I hear a lot of you run the
[1:38:35] message all we need some meat preaching
[1:38:37] or we need some deep preaching you know
[1:38:40] what that is that's judgment ok get any
[1:38:44] deeper than judging having the Holy
[1:38:47] Spirit in your life to judge whether
[1:38:49] this app is right this relationship is
[1:38:53] right or wrong
[1:38:54] this conversation is right or wrong you
[1:38:57] can't get any deeper than that that's
[1:39:00] the core to the Word of God
[1:39:01] oh come on preach me some meat I don't
[1:39:04] want any milk well let me show you what
[1:39:06] the meat is the meat is discerning
[1:39:09] between the right spirit and the wrong
[1:39:11] spirit Hebrews 5:10 Hall of God is high
[1:39:20] priest after the order of Melchizedek of
[1:39:22] whom we have many things to say and hard
[1:39:25] to be uttered singing you're dull of
[1:39:27] hearing all saying I can't preach I'm
[1:39:30] not cussing to eat because you just
[1:39:31] can't receive it we wouldn't be able to
[1:39:33] understand it aren't you glad he could
[1:39:35] understand about hesita it was Jesus
[1:39:38] before he came to the flat body praise
[1:39:40] God
[1:39:41] hey it wasn't Jesus's body
[1:39:44] it was Jesus's spirit praise God but
[1:39:48] they couldn't handle that imagine they
[1:39:50] see Maragos a new Paul's a new false
[1:39:51] America if they couldn't handle both
[1:39:53] headaches preacher
[1:39:57] first vote for when for the time ye
[1:40:01] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:40:04] one teach you again which be the first
[1:40:06] principles of the Oracles of God now he
[1:40:08] lists them at the next chapter like
[1:40:10] faith America was laying on an eternal
[1:40:13] judgment water baptism he lists all the
[1:40:16] foundational doctrines it that you
[1:40:18] should be able to teach some money and
[1:40:25] are become such as have need of milk and
[1:40:29] not strong meat so Paul says Christians
[1:40:34] message Christians can start off and
[1:40:37] become really strong and start eating
[1:40:40] meat but then by their own choice they
[1:40:44] become little babies again they can't
[1:40:46] head they can't stomach imagine we we
[1:40:48] don't see that right with our children
[1:40:51] thank goodness he makes having a
[1:40:53] seven-year-old see Danny grab my Baba ma
[1:40:56] Makai my Baba imagine an eight-year-old
[1:40:58] chung or a 13 year old child got all
[1:41:02] these teeth oh can I have my Bible for
[1:41:04] bed before I go to bed tonight but Paul
[1:41:07] said you can do that in the spiritual
[1:41:09] you can be so hungry and they see the
[1:41:12] Word of God and rejoice in it but then
[1:41:16] because you get lazy and you don't grow
[1:41:18] up God
[1:41:18] he'll keep feeding you got to go back to
[1:41:21] just the first beginning doctrines I
[1:41:23] don't really understand even the water
[1:41:26] baptism no turkey neck and I say this
[1:41:28] with love
[1:41:29] we then people's leave this church and
[1:41:31] then there they're not even sure if the
[1:41:33] Lord Jesus Christ baptism is right
[1:41:35] anymore by them telling me by them
[1:41:39] telling me they don't know if father son
[1:41:42] Holy Ghost is right anymore or Lord
[1:41:44] Jesus Christ now what is happening this
[1:41:46] is happening they become lazy see and
[1:41:50] not growing in the Word of God not
[1:41:52] asking God for revelation right not
[1:41:55] hungry in the thirsting after righteous
[1:41:57] and now they're not even sure if our
[1:41:59] very foundation they're not even sure of
[1:42:01] their foundation in terms I told you
[1:42:08] recently
[1:42:09] researches sixty-year-old video many
[1:42:12] women come up to me not even sure of
[1:42:14] their saying yes been the message
[1:42:15] churches 30 40 50 years you see how this
[1:42:22] is fun deeply this is a board 60 year
[1:42:27] old men and women come up weeping I'm
[1:42:30] not even sure if I'm saved because you
[1:42:35] don't grow in knowledge you don't grow
[1:42:39] in judgment pretty soon you've allowed
[1:42:41] this are you sitting on that and my
[1:42:43] medicine habits or spirits you get a bad
[1:42:46] habit so listen to this get a bad habit
[1:42:48] to look at that and now your evil
[1:42:50] spirits and now they so confuse you your
[1:42:54] life doesn't even look like a Christian
[1:42:56] and now it's so confused you're not even
[1:42:58] sure if you're saying with a meant
[1:42:59] always wouldn't know that I'm safe
[1:43:00] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:43:02] Ghost right David I don't want to be any
[1:43:05] doubts and hi you that by accepting the
[1:43:07] good approving the excellent and
[1:43:09] rejecting the evil every single day
[1:43:14] since to be at you don't get any days
[1:43:16] off dewy if the day we take off that
[1:43:19] today Satan gets in Christian that used
[1:43:24] to handle preach deep brother Jesse but
[1:43:26] now them I'm sure if I'm saying we go
[1:43:29] back to that and we make sure what was
[1:43:33] that salvation all about can we go back
[1:43:35] over justification again which is up I
[1:43:38] mean it's okay if you need that and you
[1:43:39] haven't studied it for a long time I'd
[1:43:41] say like are you wondering my saved or
[1:43:43] not am i sanctified or not so see they
[1:43:52] become as babes that need milk and not
[1:43:55] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[1:43:58] is unskillful in the word of
[1:44:00] righteousness for he is a babe
[1:44:03] in church i you know when i heard me
[1:44:06] part gave the message i went to churches
[1:44:08] and they told us over the pulpit they
[1:44:10] said we just throw up we do a circle of
[1:44:12] topics we do grace love salvation and
[1:44:16] the crops and they said that's our
[1:44:17] circle we just go round and around that
[1:44:19] circle there they can they
[1:44:21] minutes to me right there that they were
[1:44:24] a Milton Church and even before the
[1:44:27] message even before the message I was
[1:44:29] more hungry and I had to leave I didn't
[1:44:31] go to a Baptist Church because I was
[1:44:32] hungry for more of the Word of God I
[1:44:35] knew that I thought what about the gifts
[1:44:37] of the Spirit what about the super
[1:44:39] dancer what about miracles you see how
[1:44:41] real Christian that loves God real child
[1:44:43] of God real son or daughter they gotta
[1:44:46] have more than milk they gotta have meat
[1:44:48] raised up hey got a real child of God

[1:44:54] will go to meet verse 14 much strong me
[1:45:04] come on preacher preach speak to me
[1:45:06] briefly but strongly belong to them that
[1:45:08] are full of age even those who by reason
[1:45:11] of their use have their senses exercised
[1:45:16] to discern good and evil the most deep
[1:45:21] and impactful sermons should be ones
[1:45:25] that point you to each day
[1:45:27] recognizing the two spirits within the
[1:45:30] framework of the church all right now
[1:45:35] don't give your own there won't be red
[1:45:36] leather days where someone will preach
[1:45:38] his store beneath him go preach up
[1:45:40] America and be the great Mike service
[1:45:42] service will never bring it right with
[1:45:44] any man we talked about that there are
[1:45:46] servants will never forget but you're
[1:45:49] not if you're not growing within those
[1:45:52] red letter days something's wrong with
[1:45:54] your life that right church pretty soon
[1:46:00] you can't handle just the regular I'm
[1:46:03] sorry I should say the regular but yeah

[1:46:06] destruction judge right keep holy stay
[1:46:09] true stay sanctified judge that writer
[1:46:11] judge this right and wrong be holy every
[1:46:14] day living God's presence amen
[1:46:18] pretty soon that becomes old and
[1:46:22] spiritually people wither away and they
[1:46:26] can't understand God's working I don't
[1:46:29] want to be that kind of church Paul
[1:46:30] didn't want the Philippians to be that
[1:46:33] kind of church
[1:46:35] all only a church that grew in grace and
[1:46:37] knowledge in all judgment look Paul was
[1:46:42] so he was so serious he used the word
[1:46:45] jealousy you're ready jealous of your
[1:46:48] husband or wife you know your bread
[1:46:49] everybody jealous on you maybe your
[1:46:50] children or something this was a gothic

[1:46:59] stayed never he said a year and a half a
[1:47:01] year and a half I've been here preaching
[1:47:03] 14 years I've been preaching together by
[1:47:05] God's grace he stayed a year and a half
[1:47:08] with the Corinthians and he said I'm
[1:47:10] jealous over you with a godly jealousy I
[1:47:12] don't want you to become loose in your
[1:47:15] spiritual life I want you to remain
[1:47:17] chaste and pure

[1:47:21] to Jesus in every area of your life
[1:47:23] don't flirt with the world oh praise God
[1:47:26] that's what he wrote where's my ten
[1:47:29] minutes he was jealous or zealous that
[1:47:33] work means zealous to remain pure
[1:47:36] immaculate clean virgins to Christ he
[1:47:43] was jealous oh don't don't let this in

[1:47:49] that don't fall away from God
[1:47:51] don't become a slob little become lazy
[1:47:56] who's so jealous of them
[1:47:58] i I ice for house you I showed you
[1:48:02] Christ and now you must remain faithful
[1:48:04] to Christ you get the same body in terms
[1:48:10] this is powerful I preached this years
[1:48:12] ago no give me your bread the Galatians
[1:48:15] had less circumcision back in the church
[1:48:18] and they believed some of them were
[1:48:21] started leave okay yet to be saved yeah
[1:48:24] you got to believe in Jesus we also
[1:48:25] gotta be circumcised and Paul said am i
[1:48:28] become your enemy because I tell you the
[1:48:29] truth the people that he says you used
[1:48:32] to be you you wouldn't rip off your eyes
[1:48:34] and give them to me but now that was at
[1:48:37] the beginning but now when there he's
[1:48:39] coming against her circumcision that
[1:48:42] doctrine
[1:48:42] he's saying I'm your enemy now and he
[1:48:47] said my little children
[1:48:48] of whom I travail in birth again until
[1:48:52] Christ be formed in you now you know
[1:48:54] what he's saying Church he's saying due
[1:48:58] to your legalism I need to take you back
[1:49:00] and seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:03] because apparently you were not born
[1:49:05] again and that's some serious talk right
[1:49:07] there is it see when people start adding
[1:49:12] documents in that affect your salvation
[1:49:14] that you knows right it proves by the
[1:49:16] way they're not born again but you have
[1:49:19] to go to my church to go in the rapture
[1:49:22] what do you mean you let this demon
[1:49:24] these demon hey it shows I love you and
[1:49:38] if I did it it shows I don't love you
[1:49:41] but if I do everybody the holiness and
[1:49:44] be born again and the best in your gifts
[1:49:47] to be growing in knowledge and growing
[1:49:49] in all these years and that shows I love
[1:49:51] you
[1:49:51] you're in my heart and my heart in the
[1:49:54] bowels of Jesus Christ and I'll stop
[1:50:03] right there I can preach no more tonight
[1:50:09] musicians and you'll come you have some
[1:50:21] church anytime I feel anointed of a Holy
[1:50:24] Spirit in my study to teach on a
[1:50:27] sanctification message
[1:50:29] I know it's God I noticed I don't doubt
[1:50:34] that sometimes I used to doubt it like
[1:50:37] all the people are going to be
[1:50:38] disappointed on I don't doubt anymore
[1:50:41] because that's the very proof that you
[1:50:45] are born again because if not you sir if
[1:50:49] you don't keep your life sanctified and
[1:50:51] purified and clean out you start
[1:50:54] allowing other devils you start a lot on
[1:50:55] other spirits devils and you stop
[1:50:59] growing in the knowledge of the word
[1:51:02] and you get lazy and softball and then
[1:51:05] you can't handle deep retourner anything
[1:51:09] you accept anything but leave anything I
[1:51:12] know it's the Holy Spirit because the
[1:51:16] Holy Spirit pause I'm praying that you
[1:51:17] sanctify your whole body soul and spirit
