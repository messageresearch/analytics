[40:35] our bibles tonight by god's grace
[40:40] praise the lord let's open up to uh song
[40:43] of solomon i want to
[40:44] start there with this uh series here's
[40:46] the pirates by a score of 3-1 today
[40:49] okay somehow it uh
[40:53] caught some key word there you can
[40:54] always uh okay
[40:59] mercy let's uh
[41:03] go to song of solomon here by god's
[41:04] grace when he continues thought on the
[41:06] church
[41:07] mystery of the church as the bride
[41:12] let's go to song of solomon 1 verse 7.
[41:30] quite a book this book is i preached on
[41:32] this years ago it's probably been 10
[41:33] years maybe
[41:36] quite a quite a intense book we'd say
[41:40] but it's all pointing to christ and the
[41:43] church praise god
[41:45] amen so we want to just glean a few more
[41:49] thoughts out of here and look at the uh
[41:51] the church as the bride
[41:54] song of solomon 1 verse 7.
[42:06] i want to start just with this thought
[42:08] about
[42:09] uh the depths of the wife's love
[42:14] for solomon let's read verse
[42:17] seven i don't think i've got a memory
[42:19] verse yet from brother bang so we'll
[42:20] just keep with the uh
[42:24] we'll just keep with the february memory
[42:26] verse from
[42:27] james five so let's sing i'm sorry let's
[42:30] read rather
[42:31] song of solomon 1 verse 7. let's begin
[42:34] on three one
[42:34] two three tell me o thou whom my soul
[42:38] love us
[42:39] where thou feedest where thou makest thy
[42:42] flock to rest at
[42:44] noon for why should i be as one uh that
[42:47] turneth aside by the flocks
[42:49] of thy companions amen now the point i
[42:52] want to bring out there is that first
[42:54] phrase tell me o thou who my soul loveth
[42:58] praise god so this uh schulamite uh had
[43:02] fallen for solomon and he had fallen for
[43:05] her
[43:06] and their love was down to the soul so
[43:09] it was
[43:09] it was past the body right it was past
[43:12] the human spirit
[43:13] and it was down into the soul praise god
[43:16] that's the nature of the human being
[43:19] praise god now let's go to james 5 7.
[43:32] james five seven read seven and eight
[43:46] james five seven and eight
[44:00] all right let's read that seven and
[44:01] eight let's read that on three one
[44:03] two three be patient therefore brethren
[44:07] unto the coming of the lord behold the
[44:11] husband
[44:11] waiteth for the precious fruit of the
[44:14] earth
[44:15] and hath long patience for it until he
[44:18] received the early
[44:20] and latter rain be also patient
[44:23] establish your hearts for the coming of
[44:26] the lord
[44:27] draweth nigh amen let's that word of
[44:29] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[44:31] let's make it
[44:31] unknown unto god here let's pray
[44:33] together heavenly father
[44:35] for we come into your presence lord we
[44:37] worship you we love you
[44:38] thank you for putting the banner over us
[44:40] lord of love
[44:41] you're the one lord who assigned lord
[44:44] the flag that would fly over us lord is
[44:46] love because
[44:47] you love us lord god you you gave your
[44:50] life for us lord god you sent us every
[44:52] good and perfect gift lord god
[44:54] and you're making a way for our union
[44:56] with you lord god you want to be with
[44:58] your people
[44:59] heavenly father lord and you want to do
[45:01] it through your son lord
[45:03] the physical body so lord we're grateful
[45:05] for that lord god thank you for
[45:07] lord our banner of victory lord we know
[45:10] love is how we overcome through your
[45:12] love so lord let your love
[45:14] fill our hearts and our minds tonight
[45:16] lord speak to us by the holy spirit
[45:18] help us lord jesus we just want to be
[45:20] pleasing to you and we want your truth
[45:22] here tonight we're so grateful to be in
[45:24] your house
[45:24] there's no better place to be lord than
[45:26] in spirit and in truth
[45:28] worshiping you so we give you praise and
[45:30] thanks bless the saints that press their
[45:32] way out to the house of god
[45:33] give them a double portion lord of thy
[45:36] holy spirit
[45:37] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[45:39] said amen god bless you as you're being
[45:41] seated praise god
[45:48] all right now i want to go back to song
[45:49] of solomon 1.
[45:54] and let's go to verse 5. i kind of ended
[45:57] this
[45:57] uh message last week with this thought
[46:01] about how the shulamite
[46:05] was jewish but she had gentile
[46:07] characteristics i want to read
[46:09] this verse again
[46:14] song of solomon uh 1 verse 5.
[46:20] now as i said it's a very uh personal
[46:22] and descriptive book right because in
[46:24] verse
[46:24] the very second verse starts with uh
[46:28] them having uh marriage contacts in
[46:30] certain ways right
[46:32] so it's a very uh descriptive book
[46:36] but again it's showing uh the natural
[46:38] love between a husband
[46:39] and wife and it's the the closest
[46:42] expression jesus could have for his love
[46:45] for his wife
[46:47] would be this story of the song of
[46:49] solomon in fact the bible calls it the
[46:51] song
[46:51] of all songs praise god so it's the
[46:55] greatest song is this song of uh
[46:59] love and devotion now verse
[47:02] 5. i just want to share this again bless
[47:05] you sir
[47:06] you're fine sir verse 5.
[47:10] now it says i am black but calmly o ye
[47:13] daughters of jerusalem as the tents of
[47:15] keter
[47:15] as the curtains of solomon look not upon
[47:18] me because i'm black
[47:20] because the son hath looked upon me my
[47:23] mother's children were angry with me
[47:26] they made me the keeper of the vineyards
[47:28] but mine own vineyard
[47:29] have i not kept now we saw this last
[47:33] week that
[47:34] the the shepherd girl the shulamite
[47:38] she's talking with friends and as you
[47:40] read through this book it's a
[47:41] conversation constantly between
[47:43] the bride and her bridesmaids her
[47:46] friends
[47:47] and then groups of jews and her husband
[47:50] solomon
[47:50] it's a conversation you got to be very
[47:52] careful how you uh
[47:54] understand it and uh i want to
[47:57] bring you this thought out here uh with
[47:59] this color
[48:00] black okay i just want to bring a brief
[48:04] thought here
[48:05] because god is all skin colors okay i
[48:08] want to make sure i say that especially
[48:09] to our little girls
[48:12] god loves all skin colors but in this
[48:15] case there was a little tradition they
[48:17] had
[48:17] so the tradition of the jews was that if
[48:20] you stayed out of the sun you were
[48:21] thought to be more pretty
[48:23] if you didn't go in the sun now that's
[48:25] opposite today right
[48:27] in america if you go in the sun you are
[48:30] considered more handsome or more pretty
[48:33] the darker you are today in america the
[48:35] prettier you are
[48:36] right uh switch over real quick i just
[48:38] want to show this picture again when i
[48:40] was a little boy
[48:40] i got really really dark and now it was
[48:43] a good way i loved it
[48:44] but i got tea sometimes because i was uh
[48:47] so dark at sometimes
[48:49] look at my uh white socks here can we
[48:51] just i'll have to zoom in there
[48:52] look at my white socks and look how dark
[48:55] my skin was there look at my white shirt
[48:57] there
[48:58] there's a little brother jesse right
[49:00] there but look how
[49:01] look how much darker i was compared to
[49:03] my sister
[49:04] so people you know had they were
[49:06] surprised sometimes when they thought
[49:08] that we were
[49:08] siblings i just want to bring this out
[49:11] because i i didn't mention this last
[49:13] week and i want all the children to know
[49:14] especially
[49:15] that god loves every skin color but in
[49:18] their time in country
[49:20] you if you were rich and had lots of
[49:22] money you got to stay inside a day
[49:25] and you didn't have to go out in the sun
[49:26] and and work hard and
[49:28] watch the sheep right and feed the sheep
[49:30] and and shave the sheep
[49:32] but the poor people had to okay so i
[49:35] want to make sure you bring that out
[49:36] here that
[49:38] uh when you read the old testament they
[49:40] have many customs that don't apply to us
[49:42] today
[49:43] like i was reading this week i think
[49:44] it's in leviticus 24
[49:47] the men couldn't shape their beards in a
[49:50] curved way
[49:51] right they had to just let their beards
[49:53] grow out
[49:55] and that was because a lot of heathens
[49:58] cut their beards in a circular way
[50:00] because it looked like
[50:01] the moon god or the sun god or the
[50:04] the planetary gods of the saturn and
[50:07] mercury
[50:08] and so they worship the sun and so when
[50:11] they worship the sun they want
[50:12] they cut uh like people do today they
[50:14] cut things in their heads right they
[50:16] come
[50:16] they they shave symbols in their heads
[50:18] and and god said
[50:20] he told moses tell the men not even to
[50:23] round off the corners of their beards
[50:26] now do you think today if somebody trims
[50:27] their beard do you think that's a sin
[50:29] if jose trims his beard or something you
[50:31] don't grow a beard but
[50:32] i can't grow a beard but do you think
[50:34] it's a sin to today for g
[50:36] for gentiles to round their beards no
[50:40] it's not that was a cultural command
[50:43] for israel because all the nations
[50:46] around them
[50:46] were heathens and they worshipped idols
[50:49] so i just want to make sure
[50:50] i was kind of thinking about that last
[50:52] week i want to make sure i said that
[50:54] that god loves all skin colors
[50:58] but especially here uh the jews they
[51:00] were so
[51:01] uh they were so concerned about uh
[51:04] making sure that they stayed out of the
[51:06] sun
[51:07] right and they wanted to make sure that
[51:09] they lived an easy life they didn't want
[51:10] to they didn't want to sweat
[51:12] they didn't want to work hard who likes
[51:14] to work hard raising does anyone like to
[51:16] work hard out there
[51:17] yeah okay good we don't want to be lazy
[51:18] do we we want to work hard right
[51:20] i like getting out in the sun in the
[51:22] summer i like mowing and i like to see
[51:23] my arms get a little darker and
[51:25] i like to see my complexion get dark
[51:27] jose gets dark dunny
[51:29] you're a lot darker or winning the
[51:30] summer buddy
[51:33] it's going to start be 67 next week but
[51:36] i want to
[51:36] make sure that uh especially our
[51:38] children understand that when they read
[51:40] that
[51:41] um this this this girl was ashamed of
[51:44] her dark skin
[51:46] but we shouldn't be ashamed of our skin
[51:48] color praise god
[51:49] because it's something god gave us it's
[51:51] a beauty that god gave us right
[51:54] so i want to make sure i bring that out
[51:56] but in those days the darker skin you
[51:58] had
[51:58] they thought uh the more poor you were
[52:02] and you weren't as good as the people
[52:04] that were lighter skinned
[52:05] okay and that was just a custom that was
[52:08] just a tradition
[52:09] and that's not true at all right it was
[52:11] just a tradition or a custom
[52:13] okay so but the fact was that she worked
[52:17] outside she was a laborer
[52:19] and i like that the bible said she
[52:20] worked with the sheep praise god amen
[52:22] a woman a bride who knew about sheep
[52:25] amen
[52:26] and that's what we should know we should
[52:27] know about sheep today right
[52:29] we're god's sheep he's the great
[52:31] shepherd praise god
[52:32] we should not uh we should not know
[52:34] about wolves too much except when we
[52:36] drive them out right
[52:37] praise god we should have a bunch of
[52:39] sheep in here a bunch of humble obedient
[52:41] sheep
[52:42] not to what just not what i say but to
[52:44] what the word of god says amen
[52:46] when i'm saying what the word says then
[52:48] yes you submit to that
[52:49] but it must be according to the word of
[52:51] god because jesus is feeding his sheep
[52:54] today
[52:54] praise god and so i like this her
[52:57] connection
[52:58] with the sheep and she said my skin
[53:00] though is like the tense of the
[53:02] ishmaelites
[53:03] so we see a connection she's inward jew
[53:06] but she outward
[53:07] looks gentile she did not have a royal
[53:10] life
[53:11] and i like this in her soul the very
[53:14] center of her being she's in love with
[53:17] this
[53:18] man solomon what a mighty man he was
[53:21] he was such a mighty man at the
[53:23] beginning that god appeared to him twice
[53:26] think about that where you would you
[53:27] would say such a prayer
[53:29] that the holy spirit would come to you
[53:30] and and god would speak his word to you
[53:33] because you were so sincere and you
[53:36] wanted to do god's will
[53:39] this was the kind of man he was now
[53:41] god's holy spirit works to the very
[53:43] depths
[53:44] of our being as well now let's go to
[53:46] psalms uh
[53:47] i'm sorry song of solomon 3 verse 1.
[53:52] song of solomon 3 verse 1 by night on my
[53:55] bed i sought
[53:56] him with whom my whom i soul loveth i
[53:59] sought him but found him not
[54:01] i will now rise and go about the city in
[54:03] the streets and in the broad ways will i
[54:04] seek him
[54:05] whom my soul loveth i sought him but i
[54:09] found him not the watchmen that go about
[54:12] the city found me to whom i said
[54:14] saw ye him whom my soul loveth now look
[54:17] this was in her
[54:18] her constant conversation have you seen
[54:20] the one that my soul loves
[54:22] hallelujah she was constantly talking
[54:24] about this one
[54:25] uh with with simon with with how much
[54:28] she loved him
[54:29] right and that's what we should do we
[54:31] should we should tell
[54:32] people how much we love jesus right they
[54:35] should know that we love jesus very much
[54:37] that we love him so much we go to church
[54:39] on wednesday night right
[54:41] we go to church on sunday night we love
[54:42] jesus so much we read our bibles we pray
[54:45] we listen to sermons
[54:47] uh we do we have extra fellowships right
[54:49] we we love jesus so much
[54:51] we just want to hear his word and we
[54:53] want to be with his people
[54:54] i like this she says it over and over uh
[54:57] that she loves him with her soul
[54:59] her nature had expressed its love
[55:04] to this one man praise god i like what
[55:06] it says that
[55:07] uh he's she says i held him and would
[55:09] not let him go until i had brought him
[55:11] into my mother's house and in the
[55:12] chamber of her of her that conceiveth me
[55:15] now this is again a scripture where
[55:16] it's hard to know if they're already
[55:18] married or not um
[55:20] me personally you know i i think she's
[55:23] speaking future tense to when they would
[55:24] be married
[55:26] uh but verse five i'm sorry finishing
[55:28] verse
[55:29] five i charge you all you daughters of
[55:31] jerusalem by the rose and by the hinds
[55:32] of the field
[55:33] that ye not i'm sorry you stir not up
[55:35] nor wake my love
[55:37] until he please okay so of course it's
[55:39] speaking of married life
[55:42] all right now uh in chapters
[55:45] one two and three they're dreaming of
[55:48] their time together they get little
[55:50] short vacations of courtship
[55:52] that's what it looks like and then uh
[55:55] solomon arrives for the wedding
[55:57] in uh verse six of chapter three
[56:02] so let's read uh these last few verses
[56:04] now
[56:06] you may have a scofield bible and other
[56:09] bibles i've read talks about uh he's
[56:12] prepared this
[56:12] bed and so that's why in verse six and
[56:15] seven it seems like solomon is
[56:16] is coming into the city to have the
[56:19] wedding ceremony because he's bringing a
[56:21] bed
[56:22] which there was of course a wedding
[56:23] procession that they would do remember
[56:25] the foolish virgins they said go ye out
[56:27] to meet him right
[56:28] because he was on his way uh to his
[56:31] father's house for the wedding
[56:33] uh reception and and all their wedding
[56:36] festivities so verse six who is this
[56:39] that cometh out of the wilderness like
[56:41] pillars of smoke
[56:42] perfume with myrrh and frankincense with
[56:44] all powders of the merchant
[56:48] upon his bed which is solomon's three
[56:50] score valiant men are about it
[56:52] i'm sorry behold his bed uh of the
[56:55] valiant of israel
[56:56] they all hold swords being expert in war
[56:58] every man had this sword upon his thigh
[57:01] because of fear in the night i like that
[57:04] so solomon comes here his bed is is
[57:07] coming as well
[57:08] and he's also surrounded by warriors
[57:10] amen he's surrounded by those that have
[57:13] swords amen does not sound like
[57:15] armageddon amen
[57:16] jesus comes he's leading the charge
[57:18] right but he's got an army behind him
[57:20] praise god
[57:21] so it looks like the coming of the lord
[57:24] now verse 9 king
[57:26] solomon made himself a chariot of the
[57:27] wood of lebanon he made the pillars
[57:29] thereof of silver the bottom thereof of
[57:31] gold
[57:31] the covering of it purple the myth
[57:33] thereof being paved
[57:35] with what love amen so he's riding in
[57:39] love
[57:39] he lives in love church amen how many
[57:41] want to live in love amen
[57:43] he travels in love i like that he
[57:46] travels with soldiers he travels with
[57:48] swords
[57:49] he travels with the word amen
[57:52] and his way is paved with love he's got
[57:54] the royal colors right a purple
[57:56] amen silver redemption
[58:00] now it's love for the daughters of
[58:02] jerusalem so he
[58:03] loves his people that he rules over
[58:07] verse 11 go forth o ye daughters of zion
[58:10] and behold king solomon with the crown
[58:12] wherewith his mother crowned him
[58:14] now listen in the day of his espousals
[58:17] and in the day of the gladness of his
[58:20] heart so this is why
[58:22] you know a lot of people think here's
[58:23] solomon uh this was him coming in
[58:26] to marry the shulamite now one idea too
[58:29] you know that this may be the shulamite
[58:31] reminiscing about what had already
[58:33] happened in the past
[58:34] so it's hard to know the chronological
[58:36] order
[58:38] but i trust everybody can see that
[58:39] there's a wedding going on
[58:41] the main point we want to see is that
[58:43] these two desperately love each other
[58:45] amen
[58:46] they desperately love each other they
[58:48] love each other more than just with the
[58:49] flesh
[58:50] and the mind they love each other with
[58:52] their souls amen
[58:54] the very depths of their being they're
[58:56] completely devoted
[58:57] and the bible says they love one another
[59:00] with their souls
[59:01] and all they can do is think about time
[59:03] being together all they can think about
[59:05] is
[59:06] is sharing love and and being finally
[59:08] united praise god
[59:10] amen now
[59:14] church we know as well the bible says
[59:16] that uh
[59:18] they love uh she you know they love each
[59:20] other with their soul
[59:21] and the bible says that we love jesus
[59:24] with our soul amen
[59:26] so the bible said we're sealed to the
[59:28] day of our redemption let's uh go to
[59:30] first peter uh malachi can you do some
[59:31] reading lilia can you just remember
[59:33] lily can you pull up first thessalonians
[59:35] 5 23 and malachi
[59:37] first peter 1 22. pull up those two
[59:39] let's look at some scriptures about the
[59:41] soul
[59:42] and how we're to obey with the soul and
[59:44] love jesus from the soul
[59:46] isn't that something that god could give
[59:49] uh saints in the old testament such a
[59:51] love
[59:52] that they knew it was a everlasting love
[59:55] right they knew it was an eternal love
[59:58] even in the old testament but before the
[59:59] holy ghost could fall they knew a great
[1:00:01] connection no doubt right adam and eve
[1:00:04] no doubt they had a great love for each
[1:00:05] other because she was part of him praise
[1:00:08] god
[1:00:09] they would have had a great love because
[1:00:11] they were
[1:00:12] originally one right and we see
[1:00:16] other couples down through the bible
[1:00:19] that their love
[1:00:20] was expressed through the dedication of
[1:00:22] their soul
[1:00:24] amen they were drawn to that person they
[1:00:26] just they just had to be with that
[1:00:27] person because their souls
[1:00:29] told them and showed that they had love
[1:00:32] for just that one person
[1:00:35] all right so can you read that lydia
[1:00:38] first thessalonians 5 23
[1:00:49] amen so jesus promised to make your soul
[1:00:52] blameless
[1:00:52] and the saint said amen your soul your
[1:00:56] nature
[1:00:57] is to be blameless right there's to be
[1:00:59] nothing against your soul
[1:01:01] the bible said jesus will preserve your
[1:01:03] soul he'll protect your soul amen
[1:01:06] he'll keep your soul in a state where
[1:01:08] it's not to be blamed not to be guilty
[1:01:10] but to be guiltless amen to be justified
[1:01:13] and i like that jesus
[1:01:15] he's going to make all three parts of
[1:01:16] you he loves you so much
[1:01:18] he's going to keep your soul safe he's
[1:01:20] going to keep your mind safe he's going
[1:01:22] to keep your body safe
[1:01:23] amen he's going to preserve your love
[1:01:26] for him
[1:01:28] what a beautiful promise malachi 1 peter
[1:01:31] 1 22.
[1:01:45] now look here church a soul can you keep
[1:01:47] that up there honey
[1:01:48] this is beautiful your soul gets
[1:01:50] purified we just
[1:01:51] read that jesus keeps it re preserved
[1:01:54] blameless
[1:01:55] how does it be preserved blameless jesus
[1:01:58] is helping you to obey the word
[1:02:00] amen how many know that each week you
[1:02:02] need more reminders about obeying the
[1:02:04] word
[1:02:05] right that's the second law of
[1:02:06] thermodynamics we're going to get to on
[1:02:08] sunday night
[1:02:09] that that law says everything tends
[1:02:11] towards disorder right
[1:02:13] things just kind of unravel they kind of
[1:02:15] get old that's the law of thermodynamics
[1:02:17] right
[1:02:18] that's what solomon had unfortunately
[1:02:19] went through his love got cold for god
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:23] it got cold for god but the bible says
[1:02:25] here now in the new testament
[1:02:26] the holy spirit is going to purify your
[1:02:29] souls now here's the holy spirit
[1:02:30] as you obey the truth amen so he's going
[1:02:34] to help your
[1:02:35] soul obey the word your soul is going to
[1:02:37] be clean
[1:02:38] purified made new and it's going to help
[1:02:41] you to have genuine love
[1:02:43] amen so the holy spirit here in the new
[1:02:45] testament is working in your soul and it
[1:02:48] will give you
[1:02:48] love for god's people and also give you
[1:02:50] love for your enemies amen
[1:02:53] but that's the the interest of the soul
[1:02:55] god is most interested
[1:02:57] in getting our souls lined up with his
[1:02:59] word amen
[1:03:01] hallelujah praise god this woman says
[1:03:04] have you found the one that my soul
[1:03:05] loveth
[1:03:06] amen that's kind of how we do
[1:03:09] have you heard anything new any new
[1:03:10] prophecies about the lord is he
[1:03:12] do you think he's going to come soon
[1:03:14] right how many people they'll text you
[1:03:15] brother jesse your brother sister so and
[1:03:17] so brother son so what do you think
[1:03:19] is the lord going to come soon are you
[1:03:21] looking for the lord right
[1:03:23] what are we saying have you seen the one
[1:03:25] whom my soul loveth amen
[1:03:27] have you heard any signs have you seen
[1:03:29] any heard any prophecies
[1:03:30] uh do you feel the lord's gonna come
[1:03:32] right we're looking for the one that our
[1:03:34] soul loves amen
[1:03:35] that's why we watch him pray right
[1:03:38] that's the real reason we get on and
[1:03:39] check the news right
[1:03:40] that's the real reason we uh we talk to
[1:03:43] others from overseas and
[1:03:44] we talked to different people about the
[1:03:46] how's it going in your church and
[1:03:48] how are things going there are the
[1:03:49] people encouraged no you want to kind of
[1:03:51] see
[1:03:52] uh if the lord is dealing with people
[1:03:54] and how they're doing in the spirit
[1:03:56] because we want to be ready for his
[1:03:58] coming our souls
[1:03:59] want to be pure praise god our souls
[1:04:01] want to be ready
[1:04:02] and we want to show god's love and we
[1:04:04] want to have a pure heart
[1:04:06] at the coming of jesus amen
[1:04:09] that is getting this soul ready praise
[1:04:11] god
[1:04:14] what a great blessing now in chapter
[1:04:17] four
[1:04:19] here's some of the most detailed parts
[1:04:20] of the of the book
[1:04:22] it looks like the wedding night and uh
[1:04:24] the couple goes
[1:04:26] uh they take turns and they they
[1:04:27] complement each other from head to toe
[1:04:30] uh they both say how beautiful they are
[1:04:33] from head head to toe and then their
[1:04:36] marriage is consummated
[1:04:39] uh as solomon enters into his garden
[1:04:42] right
[1:04:43] uh the scripture says now here uh
[1:04:46] there's a there's a physical union
[1:04:48] and of course that's a type of the union
[1:04:51] of
[1:04:51] christ and the church right and so we
[1:04:54] see that air in chapter four
[1:04:57] uh the language shows a union has taken
[1:05:00] place
[1:05:00] amen praise god and then you
[1:05:04] as soon as uh as soon as that happened
[1:05:06] you start talking about the fruits of
[1:05:08] the spirit amen
[1:05:09] in verse 16 they talk about the fruits
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:12] the the pleasant fruits of the union and
[1:05:15] that's what we see when someone is
[1:05:17] really united
[1:05:17] united with christ you're going to see
[1:05:19] the love of christ amen
[1:05:21] when you're really united with the holy
[1:05:22] spirit you're going to see the
[1:05:23] longsuffering of the holy spirit amen
[1:05:25] you're going to see the temperance
[1:05:27] you're going to see the patience of the
[1:05:28] holy spirit
[1:05:29] you're going to see the fruits of the
[1:05:30] spirit when you're really united to
[1:05:32] christ
[1:05:33] amen thank god
[1:05:39] now chapters five through seven are just
[1:05:42] um
[1:05:42] interesting chapters they kind of deal
[1:05:45] with the shulamite struggles
[1:05:47] she has a struggle to respond quickly to
[1:05:50] her husband
[1:05:51] after the husband is walking all through
[1:05:53] night the husband said he's got
[1:05:55] dew on his hair and he's been out all
[1:05:57] night
[1:05:58] and he knocks and said let me in my dove
[1:06:00] and that's kind of a strange thing she
[1:06:01] said how could i get dirty
[1:06:03] how could i get dusty but by the time
[1:06:05] she gets there he's already gone and
[1:06:07] she goes out in the streets right and
[1:06:09] she tells the watchmen have you seen
[1:06:11] uh the one i love and they beat her
[1:06:14] you know it's a really strange story but
[1:06:17] we can
[1:06:18] but what we can see churches through
[1:06:19] this we can see a struggle that we have
[1:06:23] to respond quickly to that gentle
[1:06:26] uh still small voice of the lord amen
[1:06:30] praise god how many want to respond
[1:06:32] quickly to that call praise god
[1:06:34] amen that's what so what it teaches
[1:06:37] they're already married
[1:06:38] they compliment each other up and down
[1:06:40] they say the nice things they have such
[1:06:42] great
[1:06:42] intimacy but yet she's a little slow to
[1:06:45] respond
[1:06:46] notice he's not slow to respond she is
[1:06:49] amen notice jesus will never fail you
[1:06:51] but sometimes you might fail jesus
[1:06:54] right it's a beautiful story
[1:06:57] it's a struggle for the woman
[1:07:01] here to respond quickly to her husband
[1:07:05] and then diligently seek his presence
[1:07:07] but of course they reunite
[1:07:08] they again compliment each other from
[1:07:10] head to toe
[1:07:13] right in every way and then uh
[1:07:16] and this of course as the uh the church
[1:07:19] right
[1:07:19] the body of christ amen the body the
[1:07:22] body
[1:07:23] in europe right the the body in in
[1:07:25] australia
[1:07:26] the body in japan amen the body in
[1:07:29] mexico
[1:07:29] praise god uh the body in iceland the
[1:07:33] body in the united states
[1:07:34] all of it's beautiful from the top to
[1:07:36] the bottom praise god
[1:07:37] amen from the highest office can i say
[1:07:39] like that from the highest office the
[1:07:41] apostle
[1:07:42] all the way down praise god to the to
[1:07:44] the soul that just got saved
[1:07:46] last night or this morning praise god
[1:07:48] the entire body of christ who's born
[1:07:50] again
[1:07:50] she's altogether beautiful amen
[1:07:54] now of course in this text she's the one
[1:07:57] that's saying
[1:07:58] is saying he's altogether lovely right
[1:08:00] but we know he compliments her as well
[1:08:02] she's completely beautiful in his sight
[1:08:05] and she says the same thing
[1:08:06] he's completely beautiful in my sight
[1:08:11] so chapters five six and seven they go
[1:08:14] on a vacation they
[1:08:15] they go out uh uh to a garden right they
[1:08:18] go check on their
[1:08:19] uh their crops and church this is where
[1:08:23] we can relate
[1:08:24] uh how we want to be with the lord right
[1:08:28] we want to feel his anointing i don't
[1:08:29] want to feel the lord's anointing how
[1:08:31] many want to have times where you're
[1:08:33] shut in with god
[1:08:34] amen praise god you just get tired of
[1:08:37] you know maybe your life
[1:08:38] feels like it's far away and you're just
[1:08:40] longing for more of god and
[1:08:42] you just want to feel like you did at
[1:08:44] the beginning and the church said
[1:08:46] right that's what she's longing for oh
[1:08:48] my the things that uh you know we've
[1:08:49] been married but we're getting busy
[1:08:51] and we haven't had you know time
[1:08:53] together like we ought to oh
[1:08:54] yeah remember he says come away my love
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:57] right come away my lover it's like jesus
[1:09:00] drawing the bride away
[1:09:02] for a time of fellowship amen oh it's a
[1:09:05] beautiful picture
[1:09:06] beautiful picture it's on the book there
[1:09:07] lord women on the book
[1:09:12] now in the final chapter let's go to
[1:09:14] song of solomon chapter eight this is
[1:09:15] such a
[1:09:16] glorious ending to the book
[1:09:20] again it's a little bit strange but we
[1:09:22] got to see the the broad
[1:09:24] principles here that god is trying to uh
[1:09:27] explain here through this woman and this
[1:09:29] man
[1:09:30] remember he had no other love interest
[1:09:32] in the entire book right
[1:09:34] because that would not have type christ
[1:09:35] in the church right
[1:09:37] so we had one love interest the
[1:09:39] shulamite
[1:09:40] from issachar and it was up north i
[1:09:42] looked it up on finally found on the map
[1:09:43] it was
[1:09:44] north it was north of jerusalem and
[1:09:45] everything so the north part
[1:09:48] so in the eighth and final chapter the
[1:09:51] best way they can describe their love
[1:09:54] is a seal a seal
[1:09:59] now let's let's read that let's read uh
[1:10:02] song of solomon chapter 8
[1:10:07] verse 5 who is this that cometh up from
[1:10:10] the wilderness
[1:10:11] leaning upon her beloved i raise thee up
[1:10:14] under the apple tree
[1:10:16] there thy mother brought thee forth
[1:10:18] there she brought thee forth that bear
[1:10:20] thee
[1:10:21] and i'm not sure who says this i think
[1:10:24] it's the the wife
[1:10:25] set me as a seal of paul nine heart as a
[1:10:27] seal paul nine arm
[1:10:29] for love is strong as death jealousy is
[1:10:32] cruel as the grave
[1:10:33] the coals thereof are coals of fire
[1:10:36] which has a most
[1:10:37] vehement flame many waters cannot quench
[1:10:41] love
[1:10:41] so this this woman is seeing you know
[1:10:43] them coming up out of the wilderness and
[1:10:44] they've got their arms around each other
[1:10:47] and it's just quite a picture she's
[1:10:48] leaning on him
[1:10:50] as they're coming closer back into we'd
[1:10:52] say regular life and society
[1:10:54] many waters cannot quench love neither
[1:10:56] can the floods drown it
[1:10:58] if a man would give all the substance of
[1:11:00] his house for love
[1:11:01] it would be utterly contempt
[1:11:05] okay so look seal he said she said set
[1:11:09] me as a seal
[1:11:10] a paul nine heart amen church nothing
[1:11:13] was more permanent in the bible
[1:11:16] than the king seal right in the old
[1:11:18] testament nothing was more permanent
[1:11:20] they had a seal
[1:11:21] normally on their ring right esther
[1:11:24] eight verse 8 says the king's
[1:11:26] proclamation
[1:11:27] sealed with this ring was irreversible
[1:11:31] and so she said set me as a seal
[1:11:35] upon her heart in other words let my
[1:11:37] love or let my love be stamped upon
[1:11:40] your heart let me be marked upon your
[1:11:42] heart amen
[1:11:43] that's what jesus said he kind of says
[1:11:45] the same thing he said you're written on
[1:11:47] the palms of my hands amen
[1:11:49] not just like a regular uh relationship
[1:11:51] but this is a special relationship
[1:11:53] you're written on the very palms of my
[1:11:55] hands you're marked on me praise god
[1:11:58] and that's what she said let me be
[1:11:59] marked upon your heart like a seal
[1:12:02] praise god
[1:12:04] amen as a a love that is irreversible
[1:12:08] it's a unending love it's an eternal
[1:12:11] love
[1:12:11] it's an unchanging love because jesus
[1:12:13] christ is the same today yesterday
[1:12:15] and forever amen that's the best way she
[1:12:19] can describe it
[1:12:20] uh the best way we can give an idea of
[1:12:23] love
[1:12:23] is that it's stronger than death is that
[1:12:26] what the bible said
[1:12:27] love is stronger than death prove it
[1:12:30] yes i will adam prove love is stronger
[1:12:34] than death
[1:12:34] because he purposely chose to die in
[1:12:37] order to be with eve
[1:12:39] amen praise god hallelujah thank god i
[1:12:42] love that
[1:12:44] he proved it he could have lived he
[1:12:46] would have been alone he would have no
[1:12:48] help me right
[1:12:50] had he let eve just go you go and die
[1:12:52] you know she got older and died
[1:12:55] but he didn't want that he knew eve was
[1:12:57] a part of him
[1:12:58] they're the same nature right flesh of
[1:13:00] flesh bona bla
[1:13:02] bona bone word of word spirit of spirit
[1:13:05] life of life amen
[1:13:07] praise god and so adam said i've got to
[1:13:10] prove it
[1:13:11] i love her more than anything so i've
[1:13:14] got to prove that love
[1:13:16] is stronger than death amen he purposely
[1:13:19] chose to die
[1:13:20] to be with eve and jesus did the same
[1:13:24] thing
[1:13:24] he purposely chose to die in church we
[1:13:27] know he's stronger than death
[1:13:29] because he conquered death he defeated
[1:13:31] death amen
[1:13:32] he took the keys of death amen so he's
[1:13:35] stronger than death so
[1:13:37] adam and jesus christ prove once and for
[1:13:40] all
[1:13:40] that love is stronger than death amen
[1:13:44] what a beautiful picture this is the
[1:13:47] eighth and final one
[1:13:48] that we have here of uh old testament
[1:13:51] women that typify christ and the church
[1:13:56] irreversible love i like what ephesians
[1:13:59] 4
[1:14:00] 30 we read it many times but did you
[1:14:01] notice it said
[1:14:03] they're sealed unto the day of
[1:14:05] redemption
[1:14:06] it doesn't say sealed until it's sealed
[1:14:09] unto it praise god in other words you
[1:14:12] don't lose your seal after
[1:14:14] after you get a new body or you die you
[1:14:17] know
[1:14:17] you're still sealed your soul is still
[1:14:19] marked for all eternity
[1:14:21] amen it's sealed to that point
[1:14:25] so at that point you get a new body you
[1:14:27] get a theophany body how many looking
[1:14:29] forward to a theophany body amen
[1:14:31] a perfect body praise god a word body
[1:14:33] amen now we know there's limitations to
[1:14:35] it doesn't know
[1:14:36] everything right uh
[1:14:39] so we look forward to that and that's
[1:14:42] what we're promised here a love that's
[1:14:44] so strong
[1:14:45] it cannot be reversed amen
[1:14:48] and then song of solomon ends almost
[1:14:50] identically
[1:14:52] to how revelation 22 ends in both
[1:14:56] books uh the brides or the churches
[1:15:00] are eager for the bridegroom's return
[1:15:03] amen what a beautiful picture
[1:15:07] so we see in a love story in a love
[1:15:10] story the greatest expression
[1:15:12] is a seal a permanent mark an order
[1:15:15] a declaration of love amen
[1:15:20] and then also the husband and wife
[1:15:23] are longing to be together they're eager
[1:15:27] to be united amen song of solomon 8
[1:15:31] 14 she says make haste my beloved
[1:15:34] and be thou like a row i'm sorry like
[1:15:38] two a row or a young heart
[1:15:40] upon the mountains of spices
[1:15:43] now did you catch that you know in verse
[1:15:45] five they're walking up
[1:15:47] she's leaning on him now verse 14
[1:15:50] she's saying hurry up my beloved and be
[1:15:53] like a row
[1:15:54] so he must gone back up to the mountains
[1:15:56] right he must have left for a little
[1:15:57] while
[1:15:58] and then come back because she's saying
[1:16:00] make haste
[1:16:02] hurry back uh uh i'm missing you
[1:16:05] i love you amen my soul longs to be with
[1:16:08] you
[1:16:08] praise god and john right and jesus
[1:16:12] in revelation 22 said behold surely
[1:16:15] i come quickly amen now what did she say
[1:16:19] said
[1:16:19] she said come like a row come quickly
[1:16:21] like a gazelle right
[1:16:23] like a deer type of a creature like a
[1:16:25] heart
[1:16:26] right like a deer i'm some species of a
[1:16:30] vast
[1:16:30] fast-moving deer she said come quickly
[1:16:34] uh we long to be together my soul longs
[1:16:37] to
[1:16:38] to to hold the one that i love
[1:16:42] and so john finishes the book by saying
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:46] even so come lord jesus so he says
[1:16:49] surely i come quickly
[1:16:51] and then he says amen so be it amen
[1:16:54] he said i'm coming quickly he amends it
[1:16:56] and says so be it
[1:16:58] come lord jesus amen and church that's
[1:17:00] what we should feel today
[1:17:02] we should be greatly anticipating the
[1:17:04] rapture
[1:17:05] we should be looking for his coming we
[1:17:07] should say lord come quickly
[1:17:08] quickly save souls quickly baptize souls
[1:17:12] into the presence of god seal them in
[1:17:14] their souls amen with the holy spirit
[1:17:17] do it quickly do a great work because we
[1:17:19] long to be with you we know
[1:17:21] uh all these kingdoms will fail right
[1:17:23] they'll pass away
[1:17:24] we have no continuing city here we're
[1:17:26] like abraham looking for a city
[1:17:28] whose builder and maker is god amen the
[1:17:31] new jerusalem amen
[1:17:33] so come quickly we're looking for a
[1:17:35] future home
[1:17:36] that's a home of holiness amen it'll be
[1:17:39] a reign of righteousness amen hallelujah
[1:17:41] it'll be the hallelujah highway where we
[1:17:44] live and our addresses and
[1:17:45] it's a longing it's a great anticipation
[1:17:48] for that
[1:17:49] we cannot make this world our home we've
[1:17:51] got to remember that
[1:17:52] the new jerusalem is our home amen
[1:17:55] that's our real home
[1:17:57] and we must say lord jesus come quickly
[1:18:01] why don't i end with this thought here
[1:18:03] on with one more thought
[1:18:07] oh it's a beautiful picture how many
[1:18:10] like that picture there praise god
[1:18:12] what a beautiful picture it ends with
[1:18:14] the seal
[1:18:16] now as you know too it talks about the
[1:18:18] the maturity because she's talking
[1:18:20] how i'm not yet a woman i haven't
[1:18:22] developed
[1:18:23] you know into maturity and so it's
[1:18:26] showing of course that the bride has to
[1:18:27] mature right
[1:18:29] uh the bride has to become mature in
[1:18:30] order to take her position
[1:18:32] and her place so now since we're on that
[1:18:36] adam thought let's close with eve
[1:18:38] now at the end of the chapter i put all
[1:18:40] these other women you can learn lessons
[1:18:41] from that speak to the bride in christ
[1:18:44] and then i end with proverbs 31 but
[1:18:45] let's close with eve can we
[1:18:47] let's close with eve the first female
[1:18:51] came out of adam uh formed from his rib
[1:18:54] the man said that was be because she
[1:18:55] come close to his heart right
[1:18:57] the rib is close to the heart she's a
[1:18:59] piece of his uh spear right
[1:19:01] a part of him and so she's a
[1:19:04] representation of christ's bride
[1:19:07] uh how the bride originated from god's
[1:19:10] mind right
[1:19:11] because she was chosen in adam's rib but
[1:19:14] we were chosen in christ
[1:19:16] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:19:19] hallelujah thank god eve came out of
[1:19:22] adam
[1:19:23] we came out of the mind of jesus amen
[1:19:26] that means our souls are eternal we came
[1:19:29] out of god
[1:19:30] we'll go back to god so that and that
[1:19:33] should mean we live by the word if we
[1:19:35] came out of the word
[1:19:36] we should live every day by the word
[1:19:38] amen not by a creed like all those
[1:19:40] denominations we went through a few
[1:19:42] weeks ago and we should not live by
[1:19:44] those creeds and man-made
[1:19:45] dogmas and denominations but the word
[1:19:48] should become more living to us
[1:19:50] should become more alive to us we should
[1:19:52] be seeing how it more applies to us
[1:19:55] as the bride of christ amen
[1:19:58] but what happened to eve she was
[1:20:00] deceived into sinning
[1:20:01] by that satan filled serpent
[1:20:05] right satan injects his nature in the
[1:20:07] human race
[1:20:09] eve receives two different seeds
[1:20:12] any of us would have fallen so we do we
[1:20:14] don't blame eve too much right
[1:20:16] but the lesson is we never add or take
[1:20:19] away
[1:20:20] from god's word right as repeatedly
[1:20:22] taught in scripture remember like with
[1:20:24] joshua
[1:20:24] don't stray to the right don't straight
[1:20:26] to the left just meditate in the word
[1:20:29] day and night amen don't add one to so
[1:20:32] the lesson
[1:20:33] the very lesson from the beginning from
[1:20:35] from eve
[1:20:37] to moses to joshua to jesus when he
[1:20:40] faced satan he said live by every word
[1:20:42] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:20:44] amen the lesson through the whole bible
[1:20:46] then remember the bible ends in
[1:20:47] revelation 22
[1:20:48] don't add to it don't take one word from
[1:20:51] it amen
[1:20:52] the same lesson brother says it happens
[1:20:54] the beginning of the book
[1:20:55] the middle and the ending of the book
[1:20:57] the whole plan of the book
[1:20:59] is through the love of god keep every
[1:21:01] command
[1:21:02] amen beautiful thought
[1:21:07] but we know e fell just like every
[1:21:09] church would fall right every church
[1:21:11] falls short of the glory of god at some
[1:21:13] point but we have the lesson
[1:21:15] we have the lesson that eve fell because
[1:21:18] her desire
[1:21:19] went to something outside the word
[1:21:22] that's where we've got to be careful and
[1:21:23] all of our plans
[1:21:24] all of our desires all of our decisions
[1:21:26] are found in the word of god
[1:21:32] because god later says well see because
[1:21:34] you've
[1:21:35] done this your desire was to the serpent
[1:21:37] so now your desire will be to your
[1:21:38] husband
[1:21:39] it went to someone else other than her
[1:21:42] true
[1:21:43] headship right all right
[1:21:47] so our desire must only be to christ
[1:21:51] praise god
[1:21:56] and we must not repeat her heirs
[1:21:58] remember paul said
[1:21:59] he said every scripture in the bible was
[1:22:01] written for our admonition right
[1:22:03] that we would learn from it that we
[1:22:04] would not uh tempt god we would not lust
[1:22:07] we would not murder
[1:22:08] right all these are written and they're
[1:22:10] they're suitable for our doctrine and
[1:22:12] our teaching
[1:22:14] so that's what we must learn from eve
[1:22:18] the serpent we know only added one word
[1:22:21] right and true churches when i add one
[1:22:24] thing to god's command i had a brother
[1:22:26] email me this week and said
[1:22:27] he said jesus came and visited me this
[1:22:29] week and i don't even know him he just
[1:22:31] put me on his mailing list from overseas
[1:22:32] and he said he said i'm the eighth angel
[1:22:34] messenger the holy spirit is the eighth
[1:22:36] angel and i said sir
[1:22:38] i said show me one place in the bible in
[1:22:40] revelation
[1:22:41] where there's an eighth messenger there
[1:22:43] is none
[1:22:44] right there's a seventh angel and that's
[1:22:47] it and the church said
[1:22:49] so see even if it's just one edition now
[1:22:52] it sounds good doesn't it well brother
[1:22:53] rahm's gone so we need a messenger
[1:22:55] but it's not according to the bible the
[1:22:57] bible never says an eighth messenger
[1:22:59] we know jesus said he was the messenger
[1:23:01] of all time he said i'll never leave you
[1:23:03] i'll never forsake you
[1:23:04] even to the end of the age amen so he
[1:23:06] never named himself as an eighth
[1:23:08] messenger
[1:23:09] well look how people and then they call
[1:23:11] me uh they call me uh the backslidden
[1:23:13] one because i won't accept their
[1:23:14] doctrine
[1:23:16] because i won't add one word to it
[1:23:17] that's fine call me whatever you want
[1:23:19] i'm backstage from your false doctrine
[1:23:22] i'll say it like that
[1:23:23] but what i'm doing is i'm obedient
[1:23:25] faithful to christ doctrine amen
[1:23:27] you can call me backslidden to your
[1:23:28] false doctrine because i never believed
[1:23:30] it to begin with
[1:23:31] so it's hard to know that it's hard to
[1:23:33] say i'm even baxter from it i just
[1:23:34] reject it
[1:23:37] but that's what we're dealing with
[1:23:38] church dealing with people that will
[1:23:40] just add
[1:23:40] one little thing although we know the
[1:23:43] seventh angel revelation 10 7
[1:23:45] oh just well there's got to be an eight
[1:23:47] messenger no
[1:23:49] the bible didn't say that he's christ is
[1:23:51] the ever-present messenger
[1:23:53] amen praise god and so we learn not to
[1:23:57] add one thing
[1:23:58] or take one thing away
[1:24:02] now the beautiful part about eve's life
[1:24:04] is that we see
[1:24:06] redemption through her life amen how
[1:24:08] many can say praise the lord
[1:24:11] so adam willingly sinned right but eve
[1:24:14] was deceived into it
[1:24:16] but god fell sorry god still made a way
[1:24:19] for the deceived one to be redeemed amen
[1:24:23] god still stop god still knew well she
[1:24:26] fell short there she
[1:24:27] she got deceived but she still came out
[1:24:30] of adam
[1:24:30] i'm gonna redeem her i know she still
[1:24:32] has good qualities she came out of the
[1:24:34] man that i said was good amen
[1:24:37] hallelujah so i'm gonna make a way for
[1:24:40] her to come back praise god
[1:24:42] amen church let me say it like this
[1:24:45] even if we make even if we're deceived
[1:24:47] even if we make a mistake
[1:24:49] god can bring us back hallelujah amen
[1:24:52] if he brought eve back if he brought
[1:24:53] that original church back that first
[1:24:55] woman back
[1:24:56] then god could bring us back if we make
[1:24:58] a mistake or we weren't able to catch it
[1:25:00] or we made just a little mistake there
[1:25:01] god is able to redeem us
[1:25:03] uh he knows we need redemption and he
[1:25:05] knows we'll thank him for redemption
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:09] because we're not god that was the whole
[1:25:10] lie oh you can be like god right
[1:25:12] you can you're you can be greater than
[1:25:13] god you can be equal to god
[1:25:15] that was the whole lie god
[1:25:18] god knew he wouldn't be like that but
[1:25:20] satan lied and so the point of this is
[1:25:22] to show
[1:25:22] mankind redemption and his love
[1:25:26] church remember adam and eve never even
[1:25:28] asked god to come and sacrifice those
[1:25:30] lambskins
[1:25:31] god did it out of his love amen right
[1:25:34] god did it because he loved them and god
[1:25:37] sent jesus christ
[1:25:38] before you and i even cared about it god
[1:25:40] sent jesus to show us his love amen
[1:25:43] while we were yet sinners christ died
[1:25:45] the righteous for the unrighteous
[1:25:47] oh it's a beautiful picture
[1:25:50] praise god she was part of him and then
[1:25:54] adam took her sin upon himself just like
[1:25:57] jesus
[1:25:58] takes took our sin upon him and it was
[1:26:01] god's mercy
[1:26:03] that redeemed us hallelujah amen
[1:26:09] now god made sacrifices so he could
[1:26:13] clothe
[1:26:14] adam and eve in genesis 3 21 and the
[1:26:17] bible said they made coats of skins
[1:26:19] for adam and eve so despite their fall
[1:26:23] god comes around and clothes them with
[1:26:25] his choice
[1:26:26] right and it wasn't bikinis right and it
[1:26:29] wasn't uh shorts
[1:26:31] it was with long tunics of lambskins
[1:26:34] right
[1:26:35] long tunis of lands like long t-shirts
[1:26:37] of lamb skins
[1:26:39] so god provides a sacrifice god provides
[1:26:43] the righteousness
[1:26:44] god provides the blood god provides
[1:26:46] everything
[1:26:47] and god provided a way back through the
[1:26:49] baptism of the holy ghost amen
[1:26:51] he provided a way back pull up isaiah 61
[1:26:55] 10 honey isaiah 61 10.

[1:27:34] soul shall be
[1:27:35] joyful in my god for he hath clothed me
[1:27:39] with the garments of salvation amen

[1:27:44] i'm i i'm clothed i'm wearing
[1:27:47] god's salvation amen i am a living
[1:27:50] testimony that god delivers amen
[1:27:53] hallelujah through he delivered me and
[1:27:56] i'm wearing that
[1:27:57] uh my public testimony speaks that jesus
[1:28:00] is the my deliverer praise god people
[1:28:03] see my life and they should know
[1:28:05] i've been delivered by christ his
[1:28:07] sacrifice is clothing me amen
[1:28:10] oh glory thank you jesus you have
[1:28:14] covered me with the robe of
[1:28:15] righteousness as a bridegroom
[1:28:20] decketh himself now look at this a man
[1:28:22] decks himself with ornaments now that's
[1:28:23] something different
[1:28:25] right you we usually we don't think of a
[1:28:28] man looking all handsome with ornaments
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:30] chains and rings and we just you know
[1:28:33] we don't think about that too much but
[1:28:35] that was what it was
[1:28:37] in the old testament the jewish man
[1:28:38] would no doubt have done that
[1:28:40] and as a bride adorneth herself with
[1:28:43] jewels
[1:28:44] praise god so we we fall short that the
[1:28:48] devil
[1:28:48] uh deceives us we fall short but jesus
[1:28:51] welcomes us back he made a way he made a
[1:28:53] sacrifice he died for us
[1:28:55] and he welcomes us back in and then he
[1:28:57] gives us the clothes that we need praise
[1:28:59] god
[1:29:00] he gives us the jewelry need right the
[1:29:03] righteousness we need
[1:29:04] it's his gift to us he's clothing us
[1:29:08] this is the beauty of eve's testimony
[1:29:12] can i say it like this she took upon the
[1:29:14] clothing of the devil
[1:29:16] right but then jesus provides her
[1:29:18] clothing that washes away her sins
[1:29:21] and she gets a new clothing she gets a
[1:29:23] new
[1:29:24] uh wardrobe can i say like that's
[1:29:26] probably what we do children are grown
[1:29:28] so much we got to get rid of their old
[1:29:29] clothes and get them a new wardrobe
[1:29:30] right
[1:29:31] constantly a new wardrobe my wife's
[1:29:32] switching out the the clothes for zion
[1:29:34] right from the
[1:29:35] three-month-old the six month old nine
[1:29:37] month old it's a new wardrobe
[1:29:40] and jesus has given us a new wardrobe
[1:29:43] hallelujah
[1:29:44] amen this is the beauty of eve's
[1:29:47] testimony
[1:29:49] she's defiled in the midst of the garden
[1:29:51] but god makes a way that when she walks
[1:29:53] out
[1:29:54] she's clothed in his righteousness she
[1:29:56] can say i didn't buy this
[1:29:57] god gave me this amen hallelujah god
[1:30:00] gave me this message church amen
[1:30:03] god gave me this life that i lived the
[1:30:04] life you live god gave it to you
[1:30:06] it's a garment of salvation amen
[1:30:09] and you're clothing it you walk in it
[1:30:11] i'll say this you live in it praise god
[1:30:14] amen you live in the salvation and
[1:30:16] deliverance
[1:30:17] that jesus gave you that's the beauty of
[1:30:19] each testimony
[1:30:20] she walked in it she lived in it she
[1:30:22] knew what it was like because
[1:30:23] i guess it fit her just right praise god
[1:30:26] and this message fits you just right
[1:30:28] praise god other people can't live it
[1:30:30] they can't they can't make sense of it
[1:30:32] they can't figure it out but to you
[1:30:34] it just fits perfectly amen
[1:30:38] thank the lord jesus eve is forever
[1:30:42] connected to adam
[1:30:44] just as the bride is always connected to
[1:30:46] christ
[1:30:48] you know you know jesus called the last
[1:30:50] adam right
[1:30:52] he's called the last adam the first adam
[1:30:54] was a failure right
[1:30:56] but the last adam undid
[1:30:59] what the first adam did praise god
[1:31:04] for since by man came death by man came
[1:31:06] also the resurrection of the dead
[1:31:09] so because a man brought death another
[1:31:12] man had to bring life
[1:31:13] for as in adam all die even so in christ
[1:31:17] shall all be made alive amen
[1:31:21] oh glory so if jesus is the last adam
[1:31:24] the bride the holy ghost filled church
[1:31:26] must be the last eve amen

[1:31:33] and she won't be deceived and shall long
[1:31:36] and desire for christ the word
[1:31:38] amen praise god
[1:31:41] remember brother adam gave us three a
[1:31:43] few examples of that

[1:31:51] went from went from eve
[1:31:52] to haggar right still the wrong seed
[1:31:56] right the sea went to the wrong place
[1:32:00] then it went to sarah because it was the
[1:32:01] right one right it was abraham and sarah
[1:32:03] that was natural seed but then god
[1:32:06] showed the real way the seed is supposed
[1:32:07] to come
