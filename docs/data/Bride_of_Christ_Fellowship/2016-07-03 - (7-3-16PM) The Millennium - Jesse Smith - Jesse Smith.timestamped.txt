[27:30] just use this one sorry buddy I've got
[27:32] to put that my partner Python forgot
[27:35] let's open up to revelation 20 verse 1
[27:40] and I do have some quotes and scriptures
[27:42] and so forth to show later by the bang
[27:44] out to be read the text for tonight how
[27:55] do you feel they're about ready for a
[27:56] millennium and in glory yes there yes a
[28:00] man we're sorting ready for that I
[28:01] believe in him Satan Z to these 35 years
[28:04] i'm ready for a booking I don't know how
[28:07] long we'll be a hero by I'm ready for
[28:09] rest amen no temptation no teary Mentos
[28:13] in I know death those sickness ready for
[28:18] that on God's time even every sane one
[28:21] down to the grave looking for that right
[28:23] meaning for the high that day of sweep
[28:25] around the Bible called yeah so
[28:27] revelation 20 by God's grace we read
[28:30] verses 1 through 6 and I saw an angel
[28:34] come down from heaven having the key of
[28:36] the bottomless pit and a great chain in
[28:37] his hand America that's a chain of
[28:40] circumstance and he laid hold on the
[28:43] dragon that old serpent which is the
[28:44] devil and Satan and bound him a thousand
[28:47] years and cast him into the bottomless
[28:49] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[28:52] him that he should deceive the nation's
[28:55] No More to the thousand years should be
[28:57] fulfilled and after that he must be
[28:59] loose for a little season for God and
[29:01] may God right that's later in the book
[29:04] there sorry previously in the book of
[29:07] Revelation first for here's where we get
[29:11] to the money and I saw Thrones and they
[29:13] SAT upon them and judgment was given
[29:15] unto them and I saw the souls of them
[29:18] that were beheaded for the witness of
[29:20] Jesus and for the word of God which had
[29:23] not worshipped the Beast neither his
[29:27] image neither had received his mark upon
[29:28] their foreheads or in their hands and
[29:31] they live and reign with Christ a
[29:33] thousand years but the rest of the Dead
[29:37] this is such an important Scripture the
[29:39] rest of the Dead lived not again until
[29:41] the thousand years were finished this is
[29:45] the first resurrection glory that
[29:47] beautiful shows that not everybody will
[29:49] live during the thousand years was a
[29:51] pathology of the
[29:52] the dead live because they come to the
[29:54] white throne judgment verse 6 well acid
[29:59] in holy is he that part in the first
[30:00] resurrection on such the second death
[30:03] has no power but they shall be priests
[30:06] of God and of Christ and shall reign
[30:09] with him a thousand years let's turn to
[30:11] Isaiah 65 Isaiah 65 verse 19 very
[30:28] thankful for the word of God amen person
[30:32] maybe penny her brother Ram reads his
[30:34] texts in the future home 1964 to teach
[30:37] all the Millennium because he shows the
[30:39] difference between the future home and
[30:40] the new heavens of new herbs so he reads
[30:42] the scripture right here which worried
[30:45] tonight verse 19 and I'll rejoice in
[30:48] Jerusalem and joy my people and the
[30:50] voice of weeping shall be no more
[30:52] hurting her wow there's going to come a
[30:54] time when there's no more weeping in
[30:55] Jerusalem nor the voice of crying no
[30:59] more cry nutrislim there should be no
[31:01] more than sin infant of days nor an old
[31:03] man that have not filled his days for
[31:06] the child shall die a hundred years old
[31:07] but the sinner being a hundred years old
[31:09] shall be accursed that's the scripture
[31:11] by the Venice that he can't explain that
[31:12] one verse 21 and they shall build houses
[31:17] and inhabit them and they shall plant
[31:19] vineyards and eat the fruit okay they
[31:23] shall not be able and another and have
[31:26] it they should not plan another eat for
[31:27] as the days of a tree of the days of my
[31:30] people and my lecture long enjoy the
[31:32] work of their hands they shall not labor
[31:34] in vain or bring forth for trouble but
[31:36] they are seed of the blessed of the lord
[31:38] and their offspring with them I like
[31:41] this and it shall come to pass that
[31:43] before they call i will answer they talk
[31:47] about a communion with god before you
[31:49] even asked Lord could be the answer is
[31:51] already they need oh that's a real
[31:53] convenient that's a glorified body yeah
[31:55] that's a brand-new poor buddy buddy yes
[31:58] and while there yes speaking I will hear
[32:01] a as have a little more prayer to having
[32:03] it on your heart just picking on it to
[32:04] God tonight
[32:05] Heavenly Father we love you or these
[32:07] things our beautiful future flings Lord
[32:09] we're looking forward to every say as we
[32:12] said died looking for this time when
[32:14] Christ would rule himself physically on
[32:16] the earth the Jews were so confused they
[32:19] thought this time would be right after
[32:21] his coming his first coming where he
[32:23] would rule with a rod of a hybrid but
[32:25] Lord it was to be a longer time away and
[32:27] you kept that from them Lord for a
[32:29] purpose so they would stay on the fire
[32:32] lines they would keep serving you but
[32:34] Lord nine we see where at the end give
[32:35] us grace to keep on the fire lines to
[32:38] keep serving your Lord if we're looking
[32:40] for this brand new day your promise said
[32:42] it's the seventh day to your God and
[32:44] Lord made a break for suit and prepares
[32:46] for that wonderful day we ask tonight in
[32:49] Jesus Christ thing and everybody said
[32:51] hey my god bless you didn't see there so
[32:53] then you can turn over to hdmi to sir
[32:55] thank you boo boo the man just got back
[32:59] traveling from the wedding yesterday
[33:00] right by the been the reason I asked if
[33:02] you meant was because Amen told me he
[33:04] could go see had to work so I'm sorry it
[33:07] might have been a silly question to you
[33:09] his brother younger younger brother qu
[33:11] got married yesterday so okay so i look
[33:18] at the millennium Bible said the line
[33:20] which would lie down with the lamb yeah
[33:23] okay Banshee to read that is actually
[33:26] verse 25 but let's read that now verse
[33:28] 20 but the wolf and the lamb shall be
[33:30] together in the lion shall eat straw
[33:32] like the bullock and thou should be the
[33:34] Serpent's meat they should not hurt nor
[33:37] destroyed all my holy mountain say at
[33:39] the door hmm so let's look good look at
[33:42] the Millennium I actually never preach
[33:44] on the Millennium like a whole sermons
[33:45] this is new to me okay now watching the
[33:47] clock let me start my watch here so I
[33:49] don't go over too much like I said I
[33:52] mainly do that for my physical health so
[33:54] I don't hurt my own body I'm just have a
[33:56] tendency to wear myself out so that's
[34:00] okay we'll try to go 45 minutes here or
[34:03] less maybe by God's grace okay so we
[34:06] read our text here tonight those are our
[34:07] text that we read revelation 20 and
[34:11] Isaiah 65 so if anyone ever asked where
[34:13] do you find the text of the millennium
[34:14] that's a good place to start right there
[34:15] buzz Randy's both of those and we know
[34:18] what set a thousand
[34:19] years in Revelation 20 um for mostly
[34:22] that in familiar with brother branham's
[34:23] quotes he said Jesus comes in three
[34:25] Cummings the first is to redeem his
[34:28] bride and then raptures bride and the
[34:31] rule with her in the millennium so kind
[34:33] like three hours okay it's kinda like
[34:35] the same three hours as this message of
[34:37] the hour he comes to restore the hearts
[34:39] comes to reveal or finish the mysteries
[34:42] then he comes the rapture the bride so
[34:45] this this enzyme message kind of has
[34:48] three hours to I thought was interesting
[34:49] how Christ coming has three hours to
[34:52] redeem rapture rule with the bride
[34:54] brother BAM sells this and blast eNOS
[34:56] names in 1962 God makes himself perfect
[34:59] in 3 i'm skipping down to the blue now
[35:01] he he makes himself perfect in three
[35:04] cummings the first to redeem is bride
[35:06] second time to receive his bride third
[35:09] time in the linen with his bride and
[35:10] everything is perfected threes so
[35:13] there's three comings of Christ right
[35:14] redeemed up and then receive a rapture
[35:18] and then rain with her in the Millennium
[35:20] does the Bible say will be kings and
[35:22] priests in the Millennium okay now
[35:25] here's what modem teaches on a
[35:27] millennium and he teaches out of the
[35:30] future home and out of Isaiah 65 now for
[35:34] those either remember this brother Han
[35:35] teaches this and then a few months later
[35:37] in questions and answers in 64 they
[35:40] asked him about some of these scriptures
[35:42] do they pertain to the future home or
[35:44] not or do they pertain to the millennium
[35:46] and some fun brother Ramesses I don't
[35:47] know so I want you to look at the text
[35:51] for the Rams using now to me this isn't
[35:53] a big deal like someone might say oh I
[35:55] thought he was a prophet how come he
[35:56] can't plainly stay either one well to me
[35:59] uh to me it's because this deals with
[36:01] future things brother Brandon was to
[36:03] restore right yeah peace restore all the
[36:05] loose ends that remove stuff right and
[36:08] he did that he restored the mystery
[36:09] right reveal the mysteries restored the
[36:11] the lost truth so to me it's not really
[36:14] like a big deal but let's just look at
[36:16] what he said so let's get right to it
[36:17] it's in the paragraph 60 he said now the
[36:21] Book of Isaiah you want to put the
[36:22] scripture down his age 65 17 so we
[36:24] started a night team vomit turn back I
[36:26] didn't read 17 and 18 because I didn't
[36:29] want to cause any confusion I wanted to
[36:32] explain that for
[36:32] brother man couldn't exactly say on some
[36:35] of these scriptures which pertains you
[36:36] didn't pertain to the millennium or to
[36:39] pertain to the future home so that's why
[36:41] I started there at verse 19 okay now he
[36:44] says Isaiah speaking of the Millennium
[36:46] that thousands years of rest for the
[36:48] people of God Isaiah spoke of it he said
[36:50] there was all the former things have
[36:52] passed away they'll build houses and
[36:53] have it them if we had time maybe just
[36:55] take time and read this just a minute
[36:58] Isaiah 65 now we begin the verse 17 now
[37:00] I put all of the scriptures in
[37:05] italicized spot okay so this is all
[37:08] scripture that brother random reads
[37:10] during the service in 64 so we'll read
[37:13] that by God's grace he starts in verse
[37:15] 17 and behold I create new heavens and a
[37:17] new earth now that sounds like the new
[37:18] heaven to the new wrestle like the
[37:20] future hope but this is his text for the
[37:22] Millennium right he just said this is a
[37:25] text for Lillian Isaiah the prophet was
[37:28] one of the prophets that wrote exactly
[37:29] the entire Bible his prophecy he starts
[37:32] out in the creation in the middle of the
[37:33] book about the 40 chapter comes around
[37:35] John the Baptist the New Testament winds
[37:38] up here in this book and the revelations
[37:40] in the Lydia there is 66 books in the
[37:42] Bible there are 66 chapters in Isaiah he
[37:45] wrote a complete commentary and now we
[37:48] find out here now he's getting the 60
[37:51] min chapter one more chapter he speaks
[37:52] to the Lydian a notice how beautiful you
[37:54] hold on create new heavens and new earth
[37:56] and the former things should not be
[37:58] remembered nor coming tonight it's the
[38:00] pass away but be glad and rejoice even
[38:03] that which I've created for behold I
[38:05] Craig Jerusalem or rejoice and her
[38:07] people enjoy apartment so he just read
[38:10] verses 17 and 18 now you reads verse 19
[38:14] I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and enjoy my
[38:17] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[38:19] no more hurting her for nor the voice of
[38:22] crime there should be no more that in
[38:24] for the day's an old man that is not
[38:26] those days for a child to die 100 years
[38:29] old and ascender being a hundreds old
[38:30] shall be accursed then shall and they
[38:33] shall build houses and you have it then
[38:35] and then shall plant vineyards and shall
[38:37] either / that
[38:39] now he's at verse 22 in Isaiah 65 now
[38:44] and they shall not build at another
[38:46] inhabit that is your farm your son fall
[38:48] heir to it nor some of your heirs they
[38:52] should not plan another eat there they
[38:54] do their own planting and remain there
[38:55] they got life eternal oh yeah for as the
[39:00] days of a tree are the days of my people
[39:02] and my lung might elect shallow and
[39:04] enjoy the works of their hands they
[39:06] should not labor menor bring forth for
[39:08] trouble they or they are the seat of the
[39:10] blessed the Lord and their offsprings
[39:12] with them but when it says now notice
[39:14] here is where I'm going to get it after
[39:15] a while he's at verse 24 now and it
[39:21] should come to pass that before they
[39:22] call i will answer law they're speaking
[39:24] out here and a wolf and the lamb shall
[39:26] feed together in the lion shall eat
[39:28] straw like a bullock does should be the
[39:30] Serpent's me and they shall not hurt nor
[39:31] destroy and all my holy mountain saith
[39:34] the Lord so he reads basically from 17
[39:36] to 25 years of the chapter calls at the
[39:39] Millennium what a promise of these
[39:41] prophets and great sages teachers of the
[39:43] Bible way back in ancient a seeing this
[39:45] glorious day cup now I'm going to read
[39:47] some more quotes but these are on a
[39:48] black screen so it's going to flip your
[39:50] eyes are a little bit might affect your
[39:52] eyes hope it don't hurt rise hey i'm
[39:54] going to read more of these quotes so
[39:56] about three hours later the sermon
[39:57] brother brahim says the new earth is not
[40:00] the Millennium here's some quotes just
[40:02] as God grid the earth in six days made
[40:04] the earth in six days or six thousand
[40:05] years be how ignorant we read the
[40:07] scripture 1000 years was one day here's
[40:10] the scripture second Peter 381 days with
[40:13] the Lord as a thousand years and a
[40:14] thousand years was born day now he reads
[40:18] these scriptures to that we are already
[40:19] read be read these already they live and
[40:22] reign with Christ a thousand years in
[40:23] Revelation 20 for a revelation twenty
[40:26] five and six ready read these I'm gonna
[40:29] go right to the quote but millennial
[40:31] reign the thousand years is not the new
[40:33] earth see the lineal rain is a different
[40:36] rain that's what we got into the modem
[40:38] but that isn't the new earth and new
[40:39] heaven no no there's just a rest plate
[40:42] that's just the rest place you see a
[40:44] rest period not at all the new heavens
[40:45] and new earth or you see in the blood
[40:47] and we have things that would not go
[40:49] into that it's a type of the old seventh
[40:51] day
[40:52] out at Eden the seven day after he made
[40:54] the world the seventh day he rested Eden
[40:56] and the millennium so the seventh day
[40:59] when he rested in the book of Genesis
[41:00] was a type of the millennium he would
[41:02] rest the millennium is not the end of it
[41:05] there will still be tied after the
[41:08] Millennium the Millennium is a space of
[41:10] time but not the newer knowing do you
[41:12] notice and that will go into it after
[41:14] bit here's the here's the visual I gave
[41:17] you when I preach on the future hope
[41:18] remember that I think it was the first
[41:20] sermons of the new year I think the
[41:21] first weekend in january i want to go
[41:23] over it again a little bit here okay so
[41:25] day one so this is a thousand years
[41:27] since creation we believe there's been
[41:29] about 6,000 years since the since Adam
[41:32] he but been on the earth now there might
[41:33] have been mins of news of yours mother
[41:35] have sycamore that as far as human a
[41:38] human existence upon the earth about
[41:40] 6,000 years because brother Graham said
[41:42] every 2,000 years God destroys the earth
[41:44] or does something major the first two
[41:46] thousand was Noah's Flood second two
[41:48] thousand with Jesus blood and now the
[41:49] third two thousand is then millennium a
[41:51] new heavens and new earth and or I say
[41:54] millennium ok now I'm day to you have
[41:58] the flood nose blood ok day three day
[42:01] four I have the Calvary the blood of
[42:03] Christ hey day 5 a-6 is the seven
[42:07] churches so we're kind of at the end of
[42:10] the sixth day right now program says
[42:11] okay fires going to come next because we
[42:15] walked we must walk out on the ashes of
[42:17] the wicked right so fire has to come in
[42:20] for a lock on ashes of the wicked there
[42:22] must be some type of atomic fire brother
[42:24] BAM says there's some fire you know
[42:26] burning up around the earth and then day
[42:29] seven brother Graham said is the
[42:30] Millennium so a little word dare
[42:32] millennium that's the seven day okay so
[42:36] God created the earthen since seven and
[42:38] seven days was saying interrupted the
[42:40] seventh day he never got a seven day
[42:42] okay so since then since Adam now we've
[42:45] had six thousand more years that's the
[42:46] way I understand brother random teaching
[42:48] if I'm wrong that pardon me I thought
[42:50] that's how he taught it the Millennium
[42:52] it that is the seventh day is the
[42:54] seventh a group of a thousand year
[42:56] period right so the eighth day brother
[42:59] branham set is like going back to the
[43:01] first day just like a Sunday right you
[43:03] start the week all over again okay
[43:06] which represents eternity and program so
[43:09] that represents the new heavens and the
[43:10] new earth okay so seven days William
[43:13] eight days like the first day i guess
[43:15] like you've entered into the the circle
[43:17] of eternity okay now in eternity well on
[43:21] the new heavens and new earth oh that's
[43:23] the eighth day so that's when the earth
[43:26] a heaven comes down to earth right
[43:29] that's the future home coming down dwell
[43:31] on the earth that's what's going to
[43:34] happen i don't think it's that's not
[43:35] drawn to scale out of its that big
[43:36] compared to the earth or not but it is
[43:39] large the new heavens and the new earth
[43:41] rather what to do have it on top here
[43:44] mr. program says see the world has now
[43:46] almost 6,000 years old every 2,000 years
[43:49] had a destruction okay so he talks about
[43:52] this i'm just going to skip ahead to
[43:53] this this is what brother Ram talk every
[43:55] 2,000 years God does something major
[43:57] Noah Messiah and now Son of Man ministry
[44:00] you know son of man ministry or we could
[44:02] say breaking forth in the millennium and
[44:05] so forth I'm going to say it's all major
[44:07] things these are all major things and so
[44:11] that's the seventh like i said here's
[44:12] the seven church ages now that's what he
[44:14] taught the future home okay that's we
[44:16] taught the future hope you'll get that
[44:17] on the future home now he keeps going in
[44:19] burton paragraph two or three and then
[44:22] birds are off and claims at furrs own
[44:24] puts his own back on it and notice not
[44:27] the perfect world disability and it's a
[44:28] type of the seven day so just show you
[44:30] that in the muddiness type of the
[44:31] seventh day or the 7,000 years since a
[44:34] sin then comes the white throne judgment
[44:38] seat we saw a judgment we're still in
[44:40] time in the lid IAM it's a day 1,000
[44:42] years it's a time element I'll get that
[44:44] mixed up with the new earth that cuz
[44:46] it's not all right is that helpful to
[44:49] see that my god is gracious that helpful
[44:50] okay I thought it might be okay to show
[44:52] that again by the great store I love
[44:55] other brands teaching there that's
[44:57] wonderful we've been blessed to receive
[44:59] a prophetess our a tent I wanted over
[45:02] this down there must be a cleansing
[45:04] before the Millennium brother branham
[45:06] said it's the our valve Armageddon so
[45:09] we'll take this in the scripture you
[45:11] have to turn there because I have the
[45:12] Scriptures up here for you the Battle of
[45:15] Armageddon brings in the cleansing for
[45:17] the Millennium orange oh
[45:19] these scriptures and quote safe now our
[45:22] first text revelation 6 is under the
[45:26] sixth seal if you remember that and
[45:27] brother has that's called the
[45:28] tribulation sea or the sixth seal when
[45:30] the two prophets bring down the judgment
[45:33] seal upon the earth that's part of the
[45:35] purging in the cleansing he actually
[45:37] called it the purging seal the pershing
[45:39] time in the sixth seal ecarter now
[45:42] revelation 19 is when we get the picture
[45:45] of Armageddon when Jesus comes back on a
[45:47] white horse that's Armageddon okay he's
[45:50] guy is guys armies on white horses who's
[45:53] that that's you and I were Saints where
[45:56] the armies following Christ amen and
[45:58] then destruction comes when the sword
[46:01] comes out of his mouth destroys the
[46:03] night on the earth and files come and
[46:04] heat up their bodies and shortly after
[46:07] that there must have come fire out of
[46:09] heaven to purge the earth okay so here's
[46:13] the scripture now that's really small
[46:14] I'm sorry about that but this is the
[46:17] this is the the judgment scroll I'm
[46:20] sorry the judgment seal rather under the
[46:23] sixth seal so I'm not going to read all
[46:25] that but you're familiar with that
[46:26] property that's called the great day
[46:28] this wrath I'm sorry I'm so smart I made
[46:30] this a long time ago when I tried to
[46:32] make them bigger fun we will read this
[46:34] one okay revelation 19 19 now this is
[46:39] after Jesus already come back on white
[46:41] horses ok this is the last few
[46:42] scriptures on this and I saw the Beast
[46:45] of the kings of the earth and the armies
[46:47] gathered together to make war against
[46:48] him that sat on the horse it against his
[46:50] army and the Beast was taken with him
[46:52] the false prophet that wrought miracles
[46:53] before so see the Pope's killer
[46:55] numerical shirts prepare yourself now we
[46:58] might not see it that's pretty hope and
[47:00] pray we don't but if we do that's what's
[47:03] going to happen but notice the Pope the
[47:04] false prophet does miracles the Bible
[47:07] says they're lying wonders and miracles
[47:08] right if you read revelation 13 lying
[47:11] wonders and miracles yeah all right
[47:15] verse 20 it's finished that with which
[47:17] he deceived them that had received the
[47:19] mark of the beast and then that
[47:20] worshipped His image these both were
[47:22] cast alive in the lake of fire burning
[47:24] with brimstone and the remnant were
[47:27] slain with the sword of him that SAT
[47:28] upon the horse which sword proceed out
[47:31] of his mouth and all the fowls were
[47:32] filled
[47:33] flesh that's the end that's the Battle
[47:35] of Armageddon okay Jesus takes the beast
[47:39] and the false prophet and throws him
[47:42] into lake of fire burning with brimstone
[47:43] okay remember what is the Beast the
[47:46] Beast is out sphere of Rome it's the
[47:48] unclean Antichrist fear who's the boss
[47:50] prophet as the Pope that's anointed with
[47:52] that spirit they're both cast a line and
[47:55] the laker were burned with fire
[47:56] brimstone here's where he says in
[47:59] victory day 63 it'll finally wind up in
[48:04] the great battle of Armageddon that'll
[48:05] be the last of it when she comes to that
[48:07] alarm again and that'll settle the whole
[48:09] thing just before the great millennium
[48:10] Armageddon is to clean off the earth and
[48:13] she's getting clean out the earth she
[48:17] repute eyes herself with his atomic
[48:19] blowing and the volcanic ash and they
[48:23] sink this soaked blood of men upon the
[48:26] earth and Sid and crime she sinks
[48:28] beneath the earth the volcanic breaks
[48:31] out again and renews and cleanse the
[48:33] earth for the great millenniums phone
[48:35] app says atomic and then he says about
[48:36] cannock cleaning yeah so about halos
[48:39] bursting forth and all those earthquakes
[48:42] that are going to come forth the
[48:43] revelation i think there's three major
[48:44] earthquakes or two in revelation well as
[48:47] having to the earthquakes right there
[48:48] spreads apart sometimes or come together
[48:50] in this case it was friends apart
[48:52] volcano is going to come up right on the
[48:54] mag mode everything live on everything
[48:56] going to come up he cleanses church
[48:59] during that time for people to live
[49:00] there amen I say I like that all right
[49:04] this is one the seventh seal but
[49:06] millenniums coming up and see everything
[49:08] that's got any built-in it is to be
[49:10] purged during the sixth seal that's
[49:13] God's purging time lot of these plagues
[49:16] as buyers and it's going to come to the
[49:18] place and the vials and everything is to
[49:20] purge the earth now do you notice
[49:25] opening to the Seventh Seal it's also
[49:26] three-fold mystery okay and he kind of
[49:29] goes into that he talks about the
[49:32] revelation will be right at the coming
[49:34] of Christ because Christ said so known
[49:35] we return when he comes so that's why I
[49:37] teach that the Seventh Seal the literal
[49:39] opening of it is a day and hour of
[49:41] christ's coming the rapture that's why I
[49:43] teach it like that there's numerous
[49:44] quotes
[49:45] like that that's kind of a whole
[49:46] different topic okay so can everybody
[49:49] see that the millennium before the
[49:51] Millennium happens can nobody see the
[49:52] earth has to be cleaned out and hurt
[49:54] ever see that it has to now let's look
[49:57] at the scripture here if you got your
[50:01] Bibles in revelation 3 i don't think i
[50:02] have this one here but i don't have
[50:04] another slide show out of a revelation 3
[50:11] okay yeah cuz I didn't put the scripture
[50:13] down to brother branham mentions this
[50:14] Jesus sit on the throne of David in the
[50:17] Millennium now how many know that how
[50:20] many know right now Jesus on whose
[50:22] throne he's on the father's throat right
[50:24] now right because that's the throne in
[50:26] heaven but when Jesus comes down to
[50:28] earth he said this is not the Father's
[50:30] throne he said this is my throne which
[50:33] is the throat of the son of David he's
[50:35] got so in heaven is the Father's throne
[50:37] earth is the throne of the son of david
[50:41] all right so here's we're in the key of
[50:44] David was David was not David the king
[50:47] of Israel all is real and has got Jesus
[50:49] the Son of David according to the fact
[50:52] that he will sit on the throne of David
[50:53] the millennium and rain to rule over his
[50:56] heritage surely so the key of David
[50:59] signifies it as Jesus will bring in the
[51:01] Millennial age Laurie here's where you
[51:04] go to the scripture doubt i'm gonna skip
[51:07] ahead to the blue this is a mighty God
[51:09] available for us 1964 now the scripture
[51:13] is revelation 321 I think it's
[51:16] italicized program etat I'm sorry it's
[51:19] italicized there because he quotes in
[51:20] the sermon I'm going to read to him that
[51:23] overcometh will I grit and sit with me
[51:25] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[51:28] sat down with my father in his fro so
[51:32] nobody know that there's two thrones
[51:33] right there's the Father's throne and
[51:36] then there's the sudden throat the
[51:39] father says in heaven the sun's is on
[51:40] the earth amen let's read the blue there
[51:43] when the Millennium he comes the son of
[51:46] David is set up a throne of David King
[51:47] he was to take the throne of David he
[51:49] saw the Father's throne now and then he
[51:53] said he's over covers herself with me
[51:54] and my throne as I've overcome in South
[51:57] my father's home so see
[51:58] so he in the ville idiom he'll be the
[52:00] son of David what is it the same God all
[52:04] the time just changing his bass I love
[52:07] this I like this hopefully this will
[52:09] make sense this is the best picture I
[52:11] can find them how Jesus might look right
[52:13] now interceding for its ok i know it
[52:15] might not be the best picture that's the
[52:16] best i could find are we going on google
[52:18] images so right now right now Jesus is
[52:23] in the office of the Son of God because
[52:25] he's on the father's from right the
[52:27] limbs and Son of Man some of God so
[52:28] David Wright in the Millennium though
[52:32] he'll be on the son of David thrown on
[52:35] the earth and he will be the son of
[52:38] David yes praise God all right there was
[52:44] that siren isha woman said someday would
[52:46] have mercy on me and you won't even look
[52:47] at her and he said he talked about how
[52:51] she's a doll remember that but then she
[52:53] said Lord even the children get the
[52:55] crumbs of the dogs get the crumbs that
[52:57] fall from the Masters taken ass and once
[53:00] she called it Lord then she can minister
[53:02] to him to her right that's right because
[53:06] she kept calling son of David that
[53:07] wasn't that's not how he knew her
[53:09] because he's not son of David he's not
[53:10] and he wants his son of David to the
[53:12] Gentile bedtime right this is a Jewish
[53:15] position right but he grabs the Gentiles
[53:17] into it so he could administered her son
[53:20] of David but when she called lord ruler
[53:21] he's the Lord Jesus Christ right the
[53:25] Lord to the Gentiles then he can
[53:26] minister to her alright so here's the
[53:30] three sons if you need a picture that in
[53:32] your mind I love that Hoffman's headband
[53:34] what a wonderful that's his earthly
[53:36] ministry he was son of man on the earth
[53:40] now he's on the Father's throne as son
[53:44] of God right if the Millennium he'll be
[53:48] set up David and beyond the son of David
[53:50] strongly on the throne on the earth
[53:52] ruling over his real right and of course
[53:54] the bride and everything like that okay
[53:57] does that help by God's grace he comes
[53:59] his three sons okay so the man son of
[54:03] God son of David praise the Lord I love
[54:06] things like this I'd love to see it and
[54:08] I'd like to see the picture of it you
[54:09] know I like that um
[54:12] okay now i think i forgot to take out i
[54:15] want to save this quote to the end some
[54:16] of the closeout it's just a moment I
[54:18] thought I got that out of there ok I'm
[54:21] going to skip that quote I'm gonna say
[54:23] that for the ND i remember slide 34 i'm
[54:30] sorry i missed about 24 minutes left
[54:31] okay spare with me I want to try to keep
[54:33] it shorter so now we kind of went over
[54:35] this the Millennium is the day of the
[54:37] Lord or the thousand years with the Lord
[54:39] and this is his Eden the millennium has
[54:42] got Jesus's Eden right God's eden never
[54:45] got to have because the serpent should
[54:48] use e they call them all manner of evil
[54:52] knaves making fun of it but there's
[54:54] coming a great a notable day when they
[54:56] will wail ohio for the lamb it's coming
[54:58] in Wrath to judge the world that is when
[55:00] the righteous will have their day with
[55:02] the lord for the wicked shall burn and
[55:05] the righteous walk over the ashes into
[55:08] the millennium so once once the
[55:10] millennium scripture Malachi 4 3 and he
[55:13] should run down the wicked for they
[55:14] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[55:16] feet and the day that I subdue them safe
[55:18] the lower I that's what happens before
[55:21] the Millennium Falcon it comes up and
[55:25] burns all the sinners of a medicine
[55:27] maybe atomic fire will burn maybe
[55:29] somehow but all the sinners will be
[55:33] turned to ashes and then the righteous
[55:35] flock of pop walk on in the linen on the
[55:37] ashes the wicked by taking team you said
[55:41] this do you know that you believe him
[55:42] are you sick and tired of Satan's
[55:44] Kingdom are you sick and tired of it
[55:46] yeah do you believe it's coming to the
[55:48] lib unto his full of his to his eating
[55:51] right is a minute so the bloody will be
[55:55] our heated praise God another you oh my
[55:59] beautiful let's go through some Bible
[56:01] teaching and programs quotes on the
[56:03] Millennium now here the righteous
[56:06] literally literally walk into the
[56:08] millennium upon the ashes of the wicked
[56:10] we're literally going to do it the Bible
[56:13] said the day cometh that shall burn us
[56:15] up all the proud here that do wickedly
[56:18] shall be stubble so god help us out to
[56:20] be dry frightful right almost be humble
[56:22] alright and that day that cover shall
[56:25] birth of upset the Lord
[56:26] host but that it shall leave them either
[56:28] rootin or branch well do you that fear
[56:31] my name shall the son of righteous
[56:33] arrives of healing in his being and you
[56:35] should go for the Grove as calves of the
[56:37] skull to imagine the healing we're going
[56:39] to see we're to be walking on ashes
[56:41] never see jesus healed the earth oh nice
[56:45] landscaping he's going to do coming
[56:47] soompi landscapers out to him they do a
[56:49] good job that's nothing like Jesus going
[56:51] to do right I vaginally the original
[56:53] size of all the fruits member how they
[56:55] were packing those fruits into the holy
[56:57] land of the spies back those breaks that
[56:59] were big poor men had to carry him ever
[57:01] more by he's going to bring healing to
[57:04] this world alright man the Sun shall
[57:07] rise with healing in his wings all right
[57:09] and he should read out of the wicked sea
[57:12] for they shall be ashes under the soles
[57:13] of your feet and the day that I shall do
[57:15] as saith the Lord of hosts now this is
[57:18] Christ mystery God revealed now that's
[57:21] about guy not three not four because now
[57:23] a lot that I'm sorry cuz Elijah that was
[57:25] to come to alki for the earth was to be
[57:28] burnt with a bourbon heat and the
[57:29] righteous was to walk out in the
[57:31] Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked
[57:34] see so it's not that one see she's shown
[57:37] the difference between the different
[57:38] Elijah's right because John the Baptist
[57:41] was in Malachi 3 in Malachi 4 but he
[57:43] showed the difference between their
[57:44] ministries that's true that's the next
[57:47] video I'm maybe just so you know this
[57:49] week I'm working on the william branham
[57:50] videos last thing i got up the obama or
[57:54] homosexual is abomination i got those
[57:56] two videos last week on this week i
[57:58] right yesterday i recorded about 45
[58:00] minutes of video on brother branham as
[58:01] the messenger the hour we working on
[58:03] that this week i hope to get that up for
[58:05] you soup by God's grace amen okay church
[58:10] age book chapter 2 now let's get that
[58:13] girl Scripture now we know that the
[58:15] Lord's date I'm sorry now we know what
[58:17] the Lord's Day is not if it is not
[58:20] saturday or sunday what is it well let's
[58:21] put it this way today is certainly not
[58:23] the Lord's Day this is man's name see
[58:25] that today's man's name it is man's work
[58:29] man's doing man church man's idea
[58:32] worship and everything for this man's
[58:33] world or cosmos but the day of the Lord
[58:36] is coming yes it is
[58:39] just at this time of the revelation of
[58:41] Jesus Christ John was taken up by the
[58:43] sphere and transported by the spirit to
[58:45] that great day that is coming the Lord's
[58:49] Day is when the days of man are over the
[58:52] kingdoms of this world will then become
[58:54] the kingdoms of our God amen and keeps
[58:57] going the day of the Lord is when the
[58:59] judgments fall and after that comes the
[59:02] what millennium so the day of the Lord
[59:05] is when he finally deals and judges all
[59:07] this sin upon this earth that's the day
[59:09] of the Lord then comes the millennium
[59:12] right now the world does what it was
[59:15] with the Christian is that right they
[59:18] call the Christian all manner of evil
[59:20] names making fun of it but there's
[59:22] coming that great notable day when they
[59:24] will weigh on how for the lamb is coming
[59:27] in Wrath to judge the world hmm and then
[59:29] he quotes the scripture up walking upon
[59:31] the ash of the wicked right okay so now
[59:34] I know the day of the Lord is the day of
[59:36] the Lord is Armageddon basically you
[59:39] might even with the tribulation there
[59:40] it's when he deals with sin and judges
[59:43] sin and then we walk out into the money
[59:46] now let's get the next one here because
[59:48] I just had my own thoughts that I always
[59:50] tense with my thoughts oh there when I
[59:52] go back and study I want you to give my
[59:54] thoughts and I'm just trying to you know
[59:55] place things together right now say this
[59:58] bow during the Millennium and he's not
[1:00:01] literally on the earth okay st. this
[1:00:05] bounder the Loom he just residence
[1:00:06] earlier say in his literally cash into
[1:00:09] the bottomless pit and he shut up and
[1:00:11] there's a seal upon he's literally shut
[1:00:15] up in there and to change of
[1:00:16] circumstance because my circumstance is
[1:00:18] that literal chains keeping him under
[1:00:20] it's the seal of God keeping him under
[1:00:22] there praise God was stealing the CEO of
[1:00:26] the seals place upon him he shut up at
[1:00:28] the bob was fit and he's kept there by a
[1:00:30] chain of circumstance in his
[1:00:31] circumstances he's under there he's not
[1:00:33] going to get out because God put a seal
[1:00:35] apart okay now here are some good
[1:00:40] questions and answers 1964 does the
[1:00:43] Millennium have to do with the 1000
[1:00:45] years could it not be a generation know
[1:00:46] who says I believe it was on a
[1:00:48] generation a generation the Bible was 40
[1:00:51] years ababa said and
[1:00:53] with Christ a thousand years he'll be
[1:00:54] 1,000 earth because 1,000 years upon the
[1:00:57] earth is only counted for a time for a
[1:01:00] parable like to God is one day 1,000
[1:01:03] years upon the earth is only one day
[1:01:04] with God as God counting time probably
[1:01:06] understands that now so a day with God
[1:01:09] is a thousand years the man I love this
[1:01:12] is so awesome oh we're so blessed that a
[1:01:15] prophet now he keeps going so it's that
[1:01:17] Sabbath day when the church will know
[1:01:20] more labour against sin and Satan is
[1:01:23] bound for little season thousand years
[1:01:25] because the subjects is all in hell so
[1:01:29] all saying subjects aren't hell and his
[1:01:32] the church is on the earth is redeemed
[1:01:34] and write the presence of God so can you
[1:01:35] imagine that all of the demons right are
[1:01:38] kept in that prison house probably
[1:01:42] tormenting those that are being held for
[1:01:43] judgment is warily going to be where
[1:01:47] their souls going to be the whole time
[1:01:48] while the thousand years going on it
[1:01:50] must be a prison-house about so they
[1:01:51] preach the spirits that were in prison
[1:01:53] right right like my dad said you don't
[1:01:57] you don't send somebody to the courtroom
[1:01:58] boom you're you know judge somebody
[1:02:00] without sending to the court right all
[1:02:02] right and so the greatest court that
[1:02:04] we're going to have is the white throne
[1:02:05] judgment that's the course that's the
[1:02:07] course session where the books will be
[1:02:08] open and everybody read and the US those
[1:02:11] are giving eternal life on the right
[1:02:13] hand and goats on the left right so
[1:02:17] they're waiting in a prison until their
[1:02:19] court day they're waiting a thousand
[1:02:20] years in prison until the white throne
[1:02:23] judgment the court day but he said the
[1:02:28] church that's on earth is redeemed and
[1:02:30] write the brides of Christ my hands of
[1:02:32] thousand tears and the friends of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ so he has nothing can work on so
[1:02:36] it's not a chain I said has a log chain
[1:02:38] it's a change circumstance he has
[1:02:40] nothing to do he's helpless and hopeless
[1:02:41] four thousand years that's a tuna he's
[1:02:45] not on the earth he could say under the
[1:02:47] well under the earth remember this
[1:02:49] bottomless pit is okay alright so the
[1:02:54] validity of is the seventh day as we
[1:02:56] already said and the linen is also the
[1:02:57] honeymoon for christ in his bride this
[1:03:00] in the future home this ability or a the
[1:03:03] style years is not the newer little rain
[1:03:05] is the different rain
[1:03:06] that's what we go into the Millennium
[1:03:08] that isn't a new earth the new heaven
[1:03:09] though just a rest place see a rest
[1:03:12] period not at all the new heaven to
[1:03:13] earth for you see in the Millennium we
[1:03:15] have things that we cannot go to that i
[1:03:17] think i read this or did not ok let's go
[1:03:19] to support of this and i notice not the
[1:03:21] perfect world this millennium it's a tie
[1:03:23] for the seventh day then comes a white
[1:03:25] throne judgment see we still have the
[1:03:27] judgment we're still tied of a man it's
[1:03:29] a day 1,000 years i think i read that
[1:03:30] one too ok so here's what I'm going to
[1:03:34] get to now bear with me on this one the
[1:03:38] Millennium is the seventh day ok now he
[1:03:42] says this my man says is not notice it
[1:03:44] was also called the eighth day last a
[1:03:45] feast of the tabernacle notice after
[1:03:48] that after the last feast day after the
[1:03:50] last Church a junker the last complete
[1:03:52] seven days upon the earth after looting
[1:03:54] that is holy convocation comes remember
[1:03:59] this is the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:04:00] Tabernacles we're gathering places amen
[1:04:03] we're in the velineon the Bible said
[1:04:05] they shall build houses they shall not
[1:04:07] inhabit okay so listen just let me try
[1:04:10] to just slowly explain this brother
[1:04:14] branham is looking at the seven feasts
[1:04:16] of Israel the seventh one is the Feast
[1:04:19] of Tabernacles okay the seventh day here
[1:04:25] was the millennium right at seven
[1:04:28] thousand years the Williams here's what
[1:04:29] I mean hope it's not confusing here's
[1:04:31] what's different i already showed you
[1:04:33] this here's what's different can ever
[1:04:34] see these down here the first day of
[1:04:37] personal years is a type of the Passover
[1:04:39] a second is the type of unleavened bread
[1:04:41] and third is type of first fruits those
[1:04:43] are the seven the seven feasts of Israel
[1:04:45] this is just a tight brother branham
[1:04:47] says so if you listen to that and hear
[1:04:49] him say oh the Millennium is a type of
[1:04:53] the Feast of Tabernacles it is because
[1:04:55] it's the seventh okay the Millennium we
[1:04:58] build houses right well the Feast of
[1:05:00] Tabernacles what they do what the Jews
[1:05:01] do they built booths right which is like
[1:05:04] building houses and they drove the boost
[1:05:06] to remember that when they're in Egypt
[1:05:08] they had to build houses themselves at
[1:05:10] bonita okay so i just want to show this
[1:05:13] to you so you don't get confused brother
[1:05:15] adam says the feast of tabernacles is
[1:05:17] like the millennium it's because they're
[1:05:19] both
[1:05:19] the Tabernacles the seventh feast of
[1:05:22] Israel and the linen is a seventh day or
[1:05:25] the seventh group of a thousand years
[1:05:28] okay that's just a tight I'm just
[1:05:31] showing it to you so you won't be
[1:05:32] confused hopefully by God's grace all
[1:05:35] right okay all right oh that's a
[1:05:38] blessing of I God's grace where's the
[1:05:41] work work working with numbers on that
[1:05:42] one okay I got 15 more minutes to bear
[1:05:44] with me here okay but in the newer he's
[1:05:48] already went prepared the place it's
[1:05:50] bill we have nothing to do with the
[1:05:52] building of it case of event says that's
[1:05:54] why the new earth and Lily were
[1:05:55] different than linen we build houses in
[1:05:57] the new earth the house of God comes
[1:05:59] down we got Jesus is the one built in
[1:06:02] that house praise god jesus jesus said I
[1:06:06] go to prepare a place for you and
[1:06:07] brother never said Jesus doing that
[1:06:09] right now somehow he's also building a
[1:06:12] future home the New Jerusalem right now
[1:06:14] Jesus fills that house in the future
[1:06:16] home he built that house but we build
[1:06:19] our own houses during the Millennium all
[1:06:21] right that's why I just want to say that
[1:06:23] by God's grace that's the difference
[1:06:24] between the millennia we built our own
[1:06:26] houses but the future hold Jesus is
[1:06:29] building that house right now a New
[1:06:30] Jerusalem all right now that's just
[1:06:33] yellow sorry about that that just shows
[1:06:34] me when I get a quick visual where I am
[1:06:36] on my notes okay here's some quotes only
[1:06:39] for mother bandits out of quotes I know
[1:06:41] how many scriptures and here's where we
[1:06:43] gather don't confuse okay where I'm
[1:06:45] sorry some people get confused I just
[1:06:47] want to bring this up so you can see it
[1:06:49] some people say we're in the bride age
[1:06:51] and we're no longer in Laodicea now I
[1:06:56] preach this before but just listen the
[1:06:58] bride age is just a baptism of the Holy
[1:07:00] Ghost if you have the bachelor all the
[1:07:02] ghosts you're living has a bride member
[1:07:04] on this earth and it's like you've
[1:07:06] entered into a new reality right it's
[1:07:08] like you've entered into a new age in
[1:07:09] the soul but church the latest in church
[1:07:13] age is still going on from the random
[1:07:15] says until the rapture two people say oh
[1:07:18] they have to see has over where the
[1:07:19] bride a 12 yeah to us to us we're not
[1:07:22] living according to the spirit of labor
[1:07:24] to see anymore but that church age is
[1:07:26] still going on and here's where he says
[1:07:28] that's for the grand point blade he said
[1:07:31] that the church age ed and this black
[1:07:33] doubt and the bride is called out and
[1:07:35] we've already entered in the Tribulation
[1:07:36] Period today that's what they're asking
[1:07:40] Emily the tribulations now and the
[1:07:42] church age is over but I said no no no
[1:07:44] oh you're I wish I could just have more
[1:07:48] time on that seat the bride when she's
[1:07:50] taken from the church then the church
[1:07:53] age will cease okay so they say all work
[1:07:57] no longer let us see it well yeah
[1:07:59] spiritually but but legacy is still here
[1:08:02] turn out they're still here sometime
[1:08:05] people and they get quotes and they just
[1:08:06] go too far on it maybe they haven't read
[1:08:08] this yet yes look let us see the age is
[1:08:11] still going on and we're not living in
[1:08:13] coordinates purity more where the
[1:08:15] spiritual bride age we're living
[1:08:17] according to baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:19] our lives okay so he plainly says it
[1:08:23] right there Leila see it does not end
[1:08:25] until the bride goes in the rapture all
[1:08:27] right then the church age sees okay now
[1:08:30] goes for the rest of these and last time
[1:08:32] events are not going to spend time on
[1:08:33] that here's the great question you had
[1:08:34] right then your mind when we read our
[1:08:36] texts and our children bar on the bloody
[1:08:39] or not by the ramekin the Bible talks
[1:08:40] about infants right and child with 900
[1:08:43] years old well here's what he said
[1:08:44] romance and I don't know which owner be
[1:08:47] border the thousand-year maligno ray
[1:08:50] that's the question in my mind that I
[1:08:53] told you the other day I don't know it
[1:08:58] looks a whole lot like it could be it
[1:09:00] looks a whole lot like it couldn't be
[1:09:03] I'm going to be honest with you as I
[1:09:05] know how to be I don't know to this time
[1:09:08] if God ever reveals it I'll tell you but
[1:09:12] wait it has to come from God praise the
[1:09:16] Lord you're my children I wouldn't tell
[1:09:18] you I don't know whether there will be
[1:09:19] or whether there will not be I can't say
[1:09:21] that's our level brought brother Brandon
[1:09:23] yes he just being honest yeah but I'm
[1:09:26] gonna come down the water bath because
[1:09:27] if ur Godhead he said the say the Lord
[1:09:29] Trinitarians of the devil he says I'll
[1:09:32] say the Lord is only one batches the
[1:09:33] Lord Jesus Christ upstate the Lord right
[1:09:36] that says the Lord Rose will rule up the
[1:09:38] entire yeah God will destroy America
[1:09:40] thus saith the Lord you got I mean when
[1:09:42] he knew and profit when he said that's
[1:09:44] it the Lord he got it when he wasn't
[1:09:45] sure he said I don't know
[1:09:46] yeah I appreciate a man like that
[1:09:48] because he's humble he'll speaking of us
[1:09:50] he's got they'll say the lower can't say

[1:11:18] bring the card under subjection he
[1:11:20] wasn't sweat at that time he just
[1:11:21] speaking the word that's the scripture

[1:11:26] so the ranchers the wedding that's her
[1:11:29] brother in tells them doubted this evil
[1:11:31] age Satan got his age by knowledge
[1:11:34] getting the people to eat for this
[1:11:36] victory of good and evil notice Satan by
[1:11:38] his knowledge causing the people in this
[1:11:39] evil age the equalist tree of good and
[1:11:41] evil he says that he's building the
[1:11:43] greatest Christian civilization by its
[1:11:44] knowledge of good and evil greater
[1:11:46] Christian silylation but Christ little
[1:11:49] version word flock bride don't care for
[1:11:52] his knowledge she keeps Freeman what is
[1:11:54] it let us talk about her a minute she

[1:12:18] name engaged in his name going to a
[1:12:21] wedding to be married to him to become
[1:12:25] part of him see by predestination see
[1:12:27] right now we're engaged to Christ right
[1:12:30] we're married in our salt we're engaged
[1:12:32] them but when we go to the rafts or the
[1:12:34] meeting in the air around so that's the
[1:12:35] wedding that's why we have a wedding
[1:12:37] supper for three and a half years right
[1:12:39] except you have the wedding ceremony and
[1:12:41] you have the wedding supper the
[1:12:43] reception right and then you have the
[1:12:45] honeymoon amen that's got this evil age
[1:12:49] now the scripture says right now we're
[1:12:52] engaged to him in second Corinthians 11
[1:12:53] 2 we're engaged to Christ right now
[1:12:56] we're not physically with them right now
[1:12:57] when the rapture comes will be
[1:12:59] physically with them right now we're
[1:13:01] married in our souls by an invisible
[1:13:02] Union revelation 74 says but yeah we're
[1:13:08] right now we're engaged to Christ
[1:13:09] married in our souls but not physically
[1:13:11] married because when you get physically
[1:13:12] married your husband wife are with you
[1:13:14] all the time right physically will be
[1:13:17] married once we get new bodies and go in
[1:13:18] the rapture that's what he says right
[1:13:21] here to the future home help us Lord
[1:13:24] there's one here that's called this
[1:13:25] wedding supper Atlanta's thousand years
[1:13:27] of millennial reign and then to enter in
[1:13:29] the city after the honeymoon is over the
[1:13:32] millennium is merely the honeymoon then
[1:13:35] she the bride takes his bride groom
[1:13:37] takes his bride home it's hers her
[1:13:40] bridegroom his bride oh he's gone to
[1:13:42] prepare a house since he's become
[1:13:43] engaged see Jesus got engaged to us and
[1:13:48] he's going to prepare a Houston future
[1:13:50] home maybe be true to him who is the
[1:13:53] word where he is the word regardless of
[1:13:55] how others trying to sass us keep us
[1:13:58] away from the Lord Draghi here I got
[1:14:00] five minutes let it close with a few
[1:14:02] things here it's my yellow ones okay now
[1:14:07] this is why I want to close it
[1:14:12] okay let me give you sow I'll go through
[1:14:15] these later in full length but here here
[1:14:18] are some proofs that we're not in the
[1:14:20] Millennium right now I no lorcin I
[1:14:21] talked about this one time into your
[1:14:23] loved ones and thinks no thought we
[1:14:24] might be the money I'm and so forth like
[1:14:26] that but here's here's just the Bible
[1:14:28] proof I think we're not in the
[1:14:30] Millennium right now some people not to
[1:14:31] believe that these are the proofs that I
[1:14:33] can find for those scriptures we've
[1:14:34] already read the line lab did not lay
[1:14:37] down together today in peace or else the
[1:14:39] zoo's would have a lot more you know
[1:14:41] animals in there what have the separator
[1:14:43] so much okay but the Bible said the
[1:14:45] literally light lay down together and
[1:14:47] feet together office strong the Bible
[1:14:49] said that also I'm not literally walked
[1:14:52] upon any action of the wicked right
[1:14:54] right Satan is still here on the earth
[1:14:59] yeah but during the Millennium he's
[1:15:01] found in the bottomless pit four
[1:15:04] thousand years but he's in the
[1:15:05] bottomless pit now because I've quotes
[1:15:07] after the seals her brother branham
[1:15:08] rebuke Satan says lead the audience
[1:15:10] Satan so obviously say it was there
[1:15:13] amongst for the rams meetings trying to
[1:15:14] discourage his meetings he rebukes eight
[1:15:16] and say leave the audience the name of
[1:15:17] Jesus Christ we pray for people with
[1:15:20] cancer and say Satan leave in the name
[1:15:22] of Jesus Christ okay so Satan will be
[1:15:25] here on the earth turn of letting go be
[1:15:27] locked up i sealed up in the bottomless
[1:15:30] pit the Millennium is complete peace
[1:15:33] with Jesus ruling everyday on earth
[1:15:35] as son of David there's no sin on the
[1:15:37] earth and the ligaments Jesus not ruling
[1:15:39] this nation right now he never let that
[1:15:41] law pass right never homosexuality and
[1:15:44] transgender he never let that pass all
[1:15:47] right he's not ruling right now but
[1:15:48] heroes all the nations with a rod of
[1:15:50] iron during the bloody the Bible said we
[1:15:54] build houses as the antitype of the
[1:15:56] Feast of Tabernacles what houses have
[1:15:58] you been lately I'm building right do
[1:16:00] the Bible said you'll build houses right
[1:16:02] some of you might have and he might have
[1:16:04] so you brothers but I never had those
[1:16:07] that they will build houses and brother
[1:16:10] Dale also says the Millennium will be
[1:16:11] someday he said someday in the
[1:16:13] Millennium you not now he says in 1964
[1:16:16] okay now here's what I want to close it
[1:16:18] so bear with me and I'm right i think
[1:16:20] i'm right at 45 minutes here yeah i got
[1:16:22] two mins left okay perfect good good
[1:16:26] he was number 34 yeah here it is yeah
[1:16:31] Curtis okay now here's I want and with
[1:16:34] this the foolish version will miss the
[1:16:37] velineon they'll miss it because they
[1:16:39] don't have the oil to go to the wedding
[1:16:41] right got oil to go in the wedding
[1:16:42] procession quarter not be 20 mater not
[1:16:44] born again it might be version and I'd
[1:16:46] be cleaned out and sanctified but
[1:16:48] they're not filled or baptized with the
[1:16:50] Holy Ghost and brother brad says the
[1:16:53] Millennium is greater in importance and
[1:16:56] Wonder than imaginable here's what he
[1:17:00] says so he's in church age book it is
[1:17:03] the second resurrection wearing the five
[1:17:05] foolish virgins come up notice they
[1:17:07] reversion they did not have a holy
[1:17:08] spirit so they missed being at the bride
[1:17:10] while the five wise we had only become a
[1:17:13] part of that ride look what he says
[1:17:16] about the foolish version but these
[1:17:17] people being separated God loving people
[1:17:21] and trying to abide in the word listen I
[1:17:25] don't want to try to abide the word I
[1:17:27] want to abide in the word that's the
[1:17:30] difference between the booze and the
[1:17:31] wise foolish tried they never get there
[1:17:33] the bride are supposed to get there and
[1:17:35] achieve and actually dwell and by the
[1:17:38] word of God amen that's what's program
[1:17:41] talk teach this they're trying to buy
[1:17:46] you the word according to what they knew
[1:17:47] of it and being a help in the work of
[1:17:49] the Lord will come up at the end time
[1:17:52] they will miss the Millennium which you
[1:17:55] can begin to see by these truths is much
[1:17:57] more important and wonderful and we have
[1:18:00] ever thought or believed the Millennium
[1:18:03] is more wonderful than we had ever
[1:18:05] thought or believed and now i'm going to
[1:18:08] turn to this one i accidentally cut and
[1:18:10] pasted and mrs. left out some of these
[1:18:12] scriptures hey look at this one where
[1:18:18] the foolish virgins dirt the mud him in
[1:18:19] the lid of there in the grave the rest
[1:18:23] of the Dead lived not for a thousand
[1:18:24] years so the foolish version their
[1:18:26] bodies of course Burt their souls must
[1:18:28] be down in prison it must be waiting in
[1:18:31] prison he says they're in the grave
[1:18:33] right yeah they're not born again so
[1:18:36] they can't go up into the sixth
[1:18:37] dimension as far as I can tell
[1:18:39] ramsha there in the grave when the
[1:18:43] Millennium starts how the unbelievers we
[1:18:45] take it off to the earth the unbelievers
[1:18:47] will go down to the Tribulation Period
[1:18:49] with the sickening virgin and all those
[1:18:50] others ultimately neighbors and
[1:18:52] sickening version of the remnant of
[1:18:53] Israel that's to be taken out so they
[1:18:56] did not get a part of the millennium now
[1:19:01] here's our scripture we read early right
[1:19:03] there's my time okay my mind in 45
[1:19:06] minutes just won a few more seconds here
[1:19:07] we read this earlier these are the ones
[1:19:10] who reigned or the hood and they're
[1:19:12] given judgment they set up Thrones and
[1:19:13] they live in a reign with Christ a
[1:19:16] thousand years they live and reign with
[1:19:18] Christ a thousand years was the rest of
[1:19:22] the Dead lived not again until the
[1:19:23] thousand years were finished that is the
[1:19:25] first resurrection now look what it
[1:19:27] calls those who are the in the in the
[1:19:28] polonium Blessid and holy so those who
[1:19:33] actually make it the millennium and live
[1:19:35] a thousand years build houses plant
[1:19:37] vineyards all these things they're
[1:19:39] blessed and they lift their holy and
[1:19:43] they should be what they should be these
[1:19:45] two things they shall be priests and
[1:19:48] kings well Kings are raining there'll be
[1:19:51] kings and priests upon the earth now
[1:19:56] brother Graham what i've read doesn't
[1:19:58] explain too much about what we'll do to
[1:20:00] during the Millennium other than one I
[1:20:02] say a 65 set we'll bill will plant won't
[1:20:05] have it will speak and things will
[1:20:07] happen but let me show you what he said
[1:20:08] about what we should do on earth here's
[1:20:10] the quote I think that any bigger I
[1:20:15] don't know how did this a member of
[1:20:16] premier with this app actually that
[1:20:18] better okay yeah that's a little bit the
[1:20:20] other bit better okay so he reads King
[1:20:22] increases from the church age book now
[1:20:25] I'm gonna underline these things right
[1:20:28] here we are King spiritual kings oh
[1:20:31] we're going to be kings upon the earth
[1:20:33] with him when he sits on his throne but
[1:20:36] now we are spiritual kings and we reign
[1:20:38] over a spiritual Kingdom did you know
[1:20:41] that you are to rain right now you're
[1:20:44] supposed to rule a spiritual Kingdom
[1:20:46] where you're supposed to rule that in
[1:20:47] your home you're supposed to rule the
[1:20:51] spiritual goings-on in your home
[1:20:53] right and we're supposed to rule the
[1:20:55] church look what he says here right now
[1:21:00] I'm sorry let me highlight that that's
[1:21:06] not let me do it I want to do it like
[1:21:07] this I'll just go like this right now we
[1:21:09] reign with Christ having dominion over
[1:21:11] sin the world flesh of the devil amen
[1:21:14] church when you turn down to temptation
[1:21:17] say no I'm not going to love like we
[1:21:18] said last Sunday no I'm not going to be
[1:21:20] greedy though I'm not gonna lie those
[1:21:22] not gonna cheat or steal your actually
[1:21:24] raining right now as a king on this

[1:21:38] is praise and glory showing fourth
[1:21:40] himself for it is Christ at us willing

[1:21:48] tell Senor knocking Oh bed that's ruling
[1:21:53] as a king or king on this earth hey ed I
