[0:03] thank you
[0:05] Hallelujah
[0:07] so I'd like to uh
[0:09] start here by God's grace there in
[0:11] second chronicles 13 again looking at
[0:13] relying on the Lord
[0:15] I looked it up in the dictionary rely
[0:17] means to depend upon
[0:20] someone or something
[0:22] with full trust and confidence so I want
[0:25] to focus on that today
[0:29] as the as the scripture says relying on
[0:32] the Lord abide your relied he depended
[0:35] upon the Lord with full trust and
[0:38] confidence
[0:40] praise God I want to switch over here
[0:42] too and Joshua
[0:48] a visual here and I gotta unplug it here
[0:50] but I want to show this visual here by
[0:52] the grace of the Lord I showed a number
[0:54] of years ago it's been my It's been a
[0:56] number of years but you might remember
[0:58] this uh
[1:00] it's the kings of Judah and Israel we
[1:03] had Saul was the first king and then
[1:05] David and then Solomon and then after
[1:06] that it divided into two separate
[1:09] Kingdoms in other words uh there's a
[1:11] church split there's a civil war
[1:13] right there's a civil war all these days
[1:15] almost all these days
[1:17] of Israel hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:19] almost I mean there's almost a thousand
[1:21] years from Solomon until the Lord Jesus
[1:25] and John the Baptist come on the scene
[1:26] so many hundreds of years of Civil War
[1:30] and division amongst the people of God
[1:31] that's not the way it should be God's
[1:33] people should be United praise God and
[1:36] we should be grateful and we should
[1:37] Endeavor with all of our hearts to be
[1:39] United to one another in Christian love
[1:42] Hallelujah now I don't know if I can
[1:43] zoom in here let's see well let me do
[1:46] this I don't think it will okay it won't
[1:48] let me do that okay but today by God's
[1:51] grace you know I kind of caught the
[1:52] inspiration from uh abijah
[1:56] he was the son of rehoboam grandson of
[1:59] Solomon so I took my text out of abijah
[2:03] because I've been reading like I said
[2:04] through these chapters and I was just
[2:05] and I was encouraged uh by the word of
[2:08] the Lord
[2:09] and so we'll spend some time on uh we'll
[2:11] spend a little bit of time on David
[2:12] Salman rehoboam abijah ASA Jehoshaphat
[2:17] um and then we'll do a little bit on uh
[2:19] Hezekiah as well by the grace of God
[2:22] just some good scriptures here I'd like
[2:24] to go through but how many know that
[2:26] you're a king and priest unto God as
[2:28] well that's what I love about the Bible
[2:30] the Old Testament is all these natural
[2:33] stories like there are natural Kings
[2:35] right they're trying to get natural land
[2:38] you know and that's what people are
[2:39] tempted by today right
[2:41] natural riches right a natural you know
[2:44] Empires and all kinds of lands and
[2:46] houses and and all kinds of things but
[2:48] God brings it over and then in the New
[2:51] Testament we should seek spiritual
[2:52] things praise God as we heard on
[2:54] Wednesday we should speak Spirit I'm
[2:56] sorry seek spiritual riches praise God
[2:58] how many are rich today in Christ Jesus
[3:01] Paul preached The unsearchable Riches of
[3:03] Christ Hallelujah
[3:05] and as I told Simon and I were Simon
[3:07] said that really blessed me brother
[3:08] Jesse when you said when we first heard
[3:10] the message we felt like we were the
[3:11] richest people on Earth and that is the
[3:13] truth we would drive across the whole I
[3:16] drive from Akron to Lima three hours one
[3:19] way just to hear the message preached it
[3:21] was such a blessing it was easy to do
[3:23] wasn't it brother Bank it was easy to do
[3:25] because we became rich men
[3:27] Hallelujah we were poor spiritually but
[3:30] then when we heard the message now we
[3:32] became Rich Hallelujah and it's been
[3:34] enjoying the riches of Christ all these
[3:36] years by the grace of God
[3:39] and so uh I guess I'll detach now in
[3:42] case you left there so you'll probably
[3:43] see the blank screen there
[3:45] uh but I want to look here you've got
[3:47] your Bibles here we'll stay in the
[3:48] scripture
[3:50] so we want to rely Kings must rely upon
[3:52] the Lord so if you have your Bible was
[3:53] the score to Revelation chapter 1 verse
[3:55] 6.
[3:57] I just want to again just quickly go
[3:58] over these scriptures that we Are
[4:00] Spiritual Kings and Priests unto God
[4:05] so Revelation 1 verse 6.
[4:09] I'll turn there as well
[4:17] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[4:19] God and his father to him be glory and
[4:22] Dominion forever and ever amen
[4:26] so we have a spiritual office of being a
[4:28] king we must rule we must put all
[4:31] enemies under our feet how many believe
[4:33] that today amen
[4:35] amen all the enemies you face all the
[4:36] Temptations all the evil spirits can I
[4:39] say like this even the sicknesses
[4:41] even uh uh any Temptation that would
[4:44] come our way we've got to put that enemy
[4:46] under our feet we've got to overcome it
[4:48] because we're made to rule in this life
[4:51] the Bible says we will reign in this
[4:54] life by Jesus Christ Hallelujah the
[4:57] church we all know uh as I've said
[4:59] before you know we can all look in the
[5:01] mirror at the end of the day and we know
[5:02] if we're ruling or if we're in slavery
[5:05] Hallelujah we can know am I ruling over
[5:08] sin or have I become a slave to sin the
[5:11] Bible tells us that we can rule over sin
[5:13] praise God we don't have to be slaves we
[5:16] don't have to be we don't have to live
[5:18] in defeat we can live in Victory how
[5:19] many understand that by God's grace amen
[5:22] and how do we do it we depend on the
[5:25] Lord as the scripture said we rely on
[5:28] God as we're going to see with all these
[5:29] Kings they all had a choice they can
[5:31] either rely on themselves they can rely
[5:33] on their their leagues or their their
[5:36] human friendships or they can choose to
[5:38] rely on God hallelujah
[5:40] now the second verse is Psalms 51 verse
[5:44] 17.
[5:46] Psalms 51 verse 17. I'd like you to read
[5:48] that by God's grace
[5:50] you read it right from our Bibles I turn
[5:52] to it fast praise God
[5:54] now we'll just read verse 16 here for
[5:57] Times Sake for thou deliverest not
[5:59] sacrifice I'm sorry for that desire is
[6:01] not sacrifice else would I give it thou
[6:04] Delight us not in burnt offerings
[6:07] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[6:10] Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh
[6:13] God thou will not despise
[6:16] of course this was the chapter when
[6:18] David took another man's wife he took
[6:20] his mighty man's wife and then had his
[6:23] mighty man killed right in other words
[6:26] there could be hardly any more active
[6:28] betrayal than what David did
[6:31] and he said in this case God doesn't
[6:33] want me to go sacrifice animals God
[6:36] wants me to sacrifice my myself amen God
[6:40] wants me to feel sorry about my sins
[6:42] that's what God wants God doesn't want
[6:44] me to give up more money at this point
[6:45] God doesn't want me to give up uh any
[6:48] any Financial things or give away houses
[6:50] or lands God wants me to feel Broken
[6:53] Hallelujah and church that's the same
[6:55] for us hallelujah if we're going to be
[6:57] priest unto God uh when we fall short of
[7:00] God's glory we've got to confess our
[7:02] sins and say God I'm sorry I feel
[7:04] ashamed of myself I want a new start
[7:07] with God hallelujah
[7:08] amen coming off coming off communion we
[7:12] should feel close to God this week
[7:13] Hallelujah if we've had battles and we
[7:15] know the enemies after us but we can
[7:17] overcome and praise God because we're
[7:19] Kings unto God
[7:21] amen
[7:22] Hallelujah
[7:25] so this is what David said David says
[7:27] when I'm broken when I feel awful about
[7:29] my sin when I want to get close to God
[7:32] that's the kind of sacrifice God wants
[7:34] to see
[7:35] Hallelujah now go to Second Peter 2
[7:37] verse five I'm sorry first Peter 2 verse
[7:39] five sorry first Peter 2 verse five and
[7:42] I'm turning there really quick today wow
[7:44] Hallelujah first Peter 2 verse five he
[7:47] also has Lively stones
[7:49] are built up a spiritual house and holy
[7:53] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[7:55] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[7:59] Christ so we worship by getting in the
[8:02] Holy Spirit we worship by getting in the
[8:04] spirit of Jesus Christ and then when we
[8:06] give God thanks when we give God praise
[8:08] we're actually doing priest work unto
[8:11] God
[8:12] God wants us to join the Angels God
[8:14] wants us to sing along with Heaven how
[8:17] many believe that
[8:18] God wants you to join the angels and cry
[8:20] holy holy holy Hallelujah God wants you
[8:24] to to join the worship Hallelujah he's
[8:26] called you to join the worship
[8:28] he's called you to be a worshiper praise
[8:30] God not a complainer right uh not a
[8:34] denier of the truth I want you to be a
[8:36] worshiper hallelujah amen
[8:39] this is what he's called us to be Kings
[8:41] and Priests God has made us Kings and
[8:44] Priests unto God
[8:45] amen
[8:48] Romans 12 1-2
[8:53] Just A Brief Review here by God's grace
[8:54] Romans 12 1-2
[8:59] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[9:01] mercies of God that ye present your
[9:03] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[9:05] acceptable unto God which is your
[9:07] reasonable service and be not conformed
[9:10] to this world but be transformed by the
[9:12] renewing of your mind that ye may prove
[9:15] what is that good and acceptable and
[9:17] perfect will of God
[9:19] so first separate your body from Evil
[9:22] places
[9:23] don't go to the bars anymore don't go to
[9:26] the clubs anymore right
[9:27] and for us we've got to make sure we go
[9:29] to the right places on our phones and
[9:31] our tablets right gonna go the right
[9:33] places the Bible says separate your body
[9:35] if there's a Temptation don't take your
[9:37] body there stay away from that praise
[9:39] God maybe it's a friend's house maybe
[9:41] it's a neighbor's house but wherever
[9:42] there's Temptations you must sacrifice
[9:45] your your freedom to go there and the
[9:48] Bible says when you do that then God
[9:49] will accept you
[9:51] you've got to keep your body out of
[9:54] places where they'll be tempted and then
[9:56] God says okay now you're drawing closer
[9:58] to me praise God amen verse two and be
[10:01] not conform to this world don't let your
[10:03] mind be conformed don't let this world
[10:05] shape your mind
[10:06] like you can see it plainly you know uh
[10:09] with the media the liberal media today
[10:11] shapes everybody's mind
[10:13] right right like just at the with coven
[10:15] they said oh uh they said mass is going
[10:18] to keep you from getting covered and it
[10:20] didn't help at all
[10:22] see that that's how that's how easily
[10:24] they Shake people's minds they don't
[10:26] conform their mind to the truth
[10:29] right
[10:30] or they said uh uh I don't want to get
[10:33] too far into politics but they said
[10:34] Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian
[10:36] disinformation well now they proved it
[10:39] wasn't
[10:40] but people just they accept whatever
[10:42] they hear they get eat they just follow
[10:44] along they go with the flow and church
[10:46] we're not to glow go with the flow of
[10:48] this world we're to go with the flow of
[10:50] the Holy Spirit praise God
[10:52] in other words we don't accept
[10:53] everything the Bible said prove all
[10:55] things try every Spirit praise God the
[10:58] Bible said we're to judge all things
[11:00] with love in our hearts love for God
[11:02] hallelujah
[11:04] that's what the Bible said conform your
[11:06] mind
[11:07] let your mind be transformed by the
[11:10] renewal of it praise God
[11:12] so if your mind is weary if your mind is
[11:15] tired of fighting you've got to get to a
[11:17] place where you separate your body from
[11:18] your from places where you're going
[11:20] where you're tempted you got to get away
[11:22] from The Temptations and you've got to
[11:24] let the word of God change your thoughts
[11:26] change your mind make you feel new again
[11:29] about the things of God hallelujah
[11:32] I just call it an inspiration from
[11:33] talking to Austin on Wednesday night
[11:35] after church Austin said his mind has
[11:37] been renewed and that stirred me up too
[11:39] by God's grace that's what the Bible
[11:41] says we you and I have to put ourselves
[11:44] in a position where we can have our
[11:46] minds renewed and we're again we're
[11:48] joyful again to read the word of God
[11:50] we're joyful to pray Hallelujah we've
[11:52] got to find that place it's our duty to
[11:54] do that church we know how to do it this
[11:57] isn't some crazy mystery we've got to
[11:58] draw night to God and then God will draw
[12:00] an eye to us praise God
[12:02] it's called a sacrifice we've got to
[12:05] make the sacrifice you and I know this
[12:07] is just reasonable this is what God
[12:09] deserves if we're God's people we gotta
[12:11] draw nigh to God we got to give our mind
[12:13] to God our body to God our soul to God
[12:15] we got to give everything to God
[12:17] hallelujah
[12:19] amen like if you were a real fan of the
[12:22] uh of the Ohio State Buckeyes you would
[12:24] have been over there in Indiana
[12:25] yesterday with all painted up in red and
[12:27] Scarlet right or you've been glued to
[12:29] the TV for three hours yesterday because
[12:31] you're you're you're you're you're
[12:33] you're making a sacrifice to your Gods
[12:35] I'll say like that the gods of Ohio
[12:37] State football thank God we weren't
[12:38] doing that hopefully by God's grace I
[12:40] wasn't
[12:41] but see they give themselves holy to
[12:43] that they set aside everything and how
[12:45] much more should we set aside in our
[12:47] lives for the God who sent his son to
[12:49] die on the cross for our sins amen he's
[12:52] worthy of that praise God
[12:54] and friends it's a it's a uh it's a
[12:56] shame when message Believers will go
[12:58] watch uh football games and then try to
[13:00] come to God and then uh try to act like
[13:03] they're worshiping God you can't serve
[13:04] two masters you can only serve one
[13:06] master praise God
[13:08] amen we're in football season so I'll be
[13:10] preaching more on football probably here
[13:11] then when we get to uh basketball season
[13:14] we'll probably preach on that
[13:16] yeah but it's just it's just the obvious
[13:19] sign whatever whatever you're wherever
[13:21] your mind's uh stirred up wherever your
[13:23] mind is excited that's what you're
[13:25] feeding on that's what you've separated
[13:27] your body to but we've got to take our
[13:29] bodies and we got to separate them unto
[13:31] God and we got to give ourselves
[13:32] completely to God that's how we'll
[13:34] transform our minds that's how the word
[13:36] of God will seem fresh again Hallelujah
[13:38] and my mind has been refreshinged by
[13:40] Chronicles I've been reading through
[13:42] Chronicles these last few weeks it's
[13:44] been wonderful
[13:45] Hallelujah now go to uh last one is
[13:48] Hebrews 13 15. then we'll start looking
[13:50] at some of the Kings here Hebrews 13 15.
[14:07] by him therefore let us offer the
[14:09] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[14:12] that's why we gather three times a week
[14:14] right
[14:16] we got we're called we are called to
[14:18] yield to the holy spirit let the spirit
[14:20] of Jesus enter into us and it will cause
[14:22] us to continually praise God that is the
[14:25] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[14:27] name
[14:28] see if we're complaining or feeling
[14:30] sorry for ourselves we're not doing the
[14:32] act that we should we should be given
[14:34] thanks to God
[14:36] thank God I've got a vehicle thank God
[14:38] I've got food on the table thank God I'm
[14:39] alive praise God thank God that I've got
[14:42] good health thank God I've got the
[14:43] message of the hour amen I can say that
[14:45] today Hallelujah thank God we have these
[14:48] things it's such a blessing Hallelujah
[14:50] and God's called us therefore to do
[14:53] praise to give praise continually come
[14:57] to God's house and give him praise give
[14:58] him praise in your car give him praise
[15:00] in your home everywhere everything that
[15:02] has breath let it praise the Lord
[15:04] hallelujah God wants to be praised
[15:06] Hallelujah now this again kind of goes
[15:09] like uh goes along with the sermons on
[15:10] fighting multiple enemies with
[15:11] Jehoshaphat but you know brother random
[15:13] use many Old Testament Kings to preach
[15:15] sermons
[15:17] some of the most notable was the the
[15:19] king Uzziah brother random preached on
[15:22] Uzziah many times and he called the
[15:23] sermon influences
[15:25] and he talked about how Uzziah was the
[15:27] king watching the prophet Isaiah but
[15:30] when Isaiah went off the scene he kind
[15:32] of found himself in a spot where he was
[15:34] relying on Isaiah the whole time
[15:37] he wasn't really seeking God himself
[15:39] right but then Uzziah had to have his
[15:42] own experience with God hallelujah
[15:45] and so he did have his own experience
[15:47] with God
[15:48] Hallelujah and then Brothers showed us
[15:51] with the life of Solomon program showed
[15:53] how the Queen of Sheba would cross the
[15:56] entire desert just to hear God's God's
[15:59] man preach
[16:00] she she would put everything on the line
[16:02] she'd take every risk just to get In
[16:04] God's Presence Hallelujah
[16:06] and she'll condemn uh the the Pharisees
[16:09] and Sadducees of Jesus day because they
[16:11] wouldn't go to a greater than Solomon
[16:13] Jesus Christ
[16:15] shall have a testimony on the day of
[16:17] judgment because she was willing to
[16:19] sacrifice and she was willing to lose it
[16:20] all she was willing to get robbed and
[16:22] mugged just to hear God's word
[16:24] hallelujah
[16:27] and she'll have a testimony but brother
[16:29] man use that to show that all of us must
[16:31] rally around the gifts of God hallelujah
[16:34] we must rally on where we see God moving
[16:36] where do we see God moving in this
[16:38] church is where we see God moving God
[16:40] speaks to us God anoints us hallelujah
[16:43] God answers our prayer God moves for us
[16:45] God heals us God delivers us God Saves
[16:48] us hallelujah
[16:49] he's faithful where we see God moving
[16:51] we've got to back it up with all we've
[16:53] got Hallelujah
[16:54] amen
[16:56] so there's numerous examples here uh
[16:58] brother I'm using Kings
[17:00] now get your Bibles here I want to go
[17:02] through some scriptures here first
[17:03] Chronicles 10 13. we'll start with the
[17:05] first king and we'll just kind of go
[17:07] down through the chronological order
[17:09] First Chronicles 10 13.
[17:12] so Saul died for his transgression which
[17:14] he committed against the Lord
[17:16] even against the word of the Lord which
[17:18] he kept not
[17:20] and also for asking counsel of one that
[17:22] had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it
[17:26] so God actually took Saul off the scene
[17:29] because he sinned against God
[17:31] you know sometimes you wonder why do
[17:33] people die why do people die sometimes
[17:35] it's because they won't confess their
[17:36] sins
[17:38] right like we just saw that with the
[17:40] communion verse last week Paul told the
[17:42] Corinthians many are weak and sickly
[17:45] because you do not discern the body of
[17:47] Christ
[17:48] think about that many people in the
[17:50] church now our church is small right but
[17:52] just think if many of us weren't here
[17:54] because we were sick so let's say we
[17:56] just had you know the first two rows
[17:57] filled or the first the last two rows
[17:59] whatever
[18:01] I mean that's quite a picture Paul said
[18:03] most of your church many people in your
[18:05] church are either dead or sick because
[18:07] they mistreat each other they try to sue
[18:09] each other
[18:10] they got sexual sins they won't confess
[18:12] right they're they're bragging well I
[18:14] like Apollos more than Peter and I like
[18:16] this preacher more than that preacher
[18:18] and Paul said don't you know you're
[18:19] carnal babies amen
[18:21] you're not mature people because you're
[18:23] arguing about who's greater and you're
[18:25] giving into a sensual lust and you're
[18:28] not serving God the way you should be in
[18:29] you care about money more than forgiving
[18:31] your brother and sister praise God
[18:33] you care about like brother said you
[18:35] care about a few stinking dollars more
[18:37] than having love for your your family of
[18:40] God
[18:41] they'd rather have a few stinking
[18:43] dollars than have peace in their lives
[18:46] well I'm going to take them to get my
[18:48] money back
[18:50] because they'd rather have a few
[18:51] stinking dollars right
[18:54] how many rather have peace of God in
[18:55] your heart I'd rather have God's peace
[18:58] than anything else praise God
[19:00] because it's either have God's peace or
[19:02] demons will torment you
[19:04] right
[19:06] so for like I don't know if I thought
[19:08] about the Christmas but I got saved in
[19:10] 19 brother Chris but for those 19 years
[19:12] basically I was running from God
[19:13] tormented the whole time why aren't you
[19:16] serving God now I was just tormented by
[19:18] my own sins you know my own always was
[19:20] feeling guilty always always ashamed and
[19:23] trying to trying to run away from those
[19:25] feelings
[19:26] but none of it ever left until I came to
[19:28] Jesus I repented of my sins and I raised
[19:31] my hands and I started giving God praise
[19:33] and I surrendered praise God and then
[19:35] the peace that passes all understanding
[19:37] swept into my soul praise God
[19:39] and then I passed from Death unto life
[19:42] praise God but what's that is even
[19:45] Believers that serve God for years
[19:46] decades even they choose to live in
[19:49] torment because they won't confess their
[19:51] sins
[19:52] they don't have enough humility to go to
[19:54] a loved one and just say I'm sorry I
[19:57] should not have done that forgive me
[19:59] right
[20:02] you know those words are so powerful we
[20:05] heard we heard it on the uh
[20:08] we heard it on the uh drama yesterday
[20:10] right on the the Giant Killer that last
[20:13] giant giant Pride what were the words he
[20:15] wouldn't say I repent
[20:17] and what do you say uh remember Victoria
[20:19] he said I repent
[20:22] and I'm grateful for forgiveness thank
[20:24] you another good memory and she wasn't
[20:26] even there
[20:29] that giant bride will not repent and it
[20:32] won't be thankful to God for forgiveness
[20:34] right because it thinks look what I've
[20:36] done it's always looking at me
[20:38] may God help us praise God to get our
[20:41] eyes off ourselves and get our eyes on
[20:43] Christ hallelujah amen he's the worthy
[20:45] one he's the one we got to praise he's
[20:46] the one we gotta mind he's
[20:49] he's the one we got to look to praise
[20:51] God and he will direct our past if we
[20:53] rely on Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[20:56] amen
[20:58] so God took him off the scene
[21:01] because he transgressed and then he also
[21:03] went to witches well today if you go
[21:06] into a palm reader
[21:07] right that's the equivalent today
[21:09] going to a palm reader and say what's my
[21:11] future
[21:13] you know hopefully by God's grace the
[21:15] holy spirit will come in there and make
[21:16] the uh the palm reader Scream and Shout
[21:19] you're a child of God and then
[21:20] get out of here hopefully that's what it
[21:23] would do by God's grace
[21:24] the next verse says and he now look he
[21:27] inquired not of the Lord so Saul stopped
[21:29] asking God about his life
[21:32] therefore God slew him and turned the
[21:35] kingdom of David unto the son of Jesse
[21:36] now remember who knows the Bible said
[21:46] for all those years that he was chasing
[21:48] down David
[21:49] right God was running after him God was
[21:51] trying to get him to turn around
[21:54] God was merciful so it was God's mercy
[21:57] to take him off the scene
[21:59] right absolutely God is Rich and mercy
[22:03] the Bible said God knocks at every heart
[22:05] praise God
[22:07] we'll get to that verse maybe today
[22:08] where uh the Bible said the eyes of the
[22:10] Lord run to and fro upon the whole earth
[22:12] so God can so show himself strong in
[22:15] some believer
[22:17] who wants God to be strong in their
[22:19] lives
[22:20] now if I said who wants God to be weak
[22:22] in their lives hopefully nobody raised
[22:24] their hand
[22:25] I mean I hope you can say
[22:31] when I called out to God he answers my
[22:33] prayer Hallelujah
[22:35] amen
[22:36] oh it's beautiful
[22:38] and he inquired Saul inquired not the
[22:40] Lord therefore God slew him and turned
[22:42] the kingdom over to David the son of
[22:43] Jesse now
[22:45] remember David was the opposite of this
[22:47] in Psalm Psalm 27 4. one thing I desire
[22:50] to the Lord that I will seek after that
[22:52] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[22:53] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[22:55] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[22:59] okay so David was the opposite David was
[23:02] constantly trying to seek God he was
[23:05] constantly trying to find answers for
[23:07] his life by seeking God
[23:10] now is that what you do Church each day
[23:12] now do you have to say Amen if you want
[23:14] you don't want to but each day you see
[23:16] God God what you what do you want me to
[23:17] do today or God why do you want me to do
[23:20] this week hopefully he'll start this
[23:21] week by saying God just guide my week
[23:22] this week
[23:24] what do you want me to do this week what
[23:25] what can I accomplish for your purpose
[23:27] this week
[23:28] see David said that's one thing I desire
[23:31] if I can have anything in life now you
[23:33] finish the sentence in your mind if I
[23:34] could have one thing in life I would
[23:35] have um
[23:36] David said if I could have one thing in
[23:39] my life I'd be in the house of God Amen
[23:41] Hallelujah praise God
[23:44] now it's different if you said uh
[23:47] I thought this you know if there's one
[23:49] battle I didn't have to fight it would
[23:50] be blank that'd be a blessing praise God
[23:53] and maybe God will give you victory over
[23:55] that but even if God gives you victory
[23:56] over that you still have to fight
[23:58] something else praise God
[24:00] right we're either coming out of the
[24:01] battle in a battle or going to the next
[24:02] battle right so
[24:06] we like day and both these were Kings
[24:08] Saul was the King David was the king and
[24:10] church your king
[24:15] now
[24:19] remember church that God can be with you
[24:21] strongly and then as we saw in Hezekiah
[24:24] sometimes God will pull back and see
[24:26] what you're going to do right right he's
[24:29] going to test you in other words he's
[24:30] going to allow you to go through tests
[24:31] that's what God did with Solomon second
[24:33] chronicles one verse one second
[24:36] chronicles one verse one and Solomon the
[24:38] son of David was strengthened in his
[24:39] kingdom and the Lord as God was with him
[24:41] and magnified him exceedingly
[24:45] so see God who's with Solomon as long as
[24:47] Solomon was with God God is with you as
[24:50] long as you remain with him
[24:52] as long as you draw an eye to God as
[24:55] long as you come to ask God questions as
[24:56] long as you come to worship God God will
[24:58] be with you praise God
[25:00] and then there'll be times your life
[25:01] when he'll step back and he'll see he'll
[25:03] let you see yourself what are you made
[25:05] of right now what is your character
[25:07] right now but Church don't be
[25:08] discouraged because your in character
[25:10] can always increase by God's grace amen
[25:12] amen hallelujah that's what life is
[25:15] about increasing your character Simon
[25:17] preached on it and brother Brian
[25:18] preached on it too God wants to increase
[25:20] your character what is your character
[25:21] it's the amount of uh obedience
[25:24] decisions that you make that's your
[25:26] character it's your moral makeup
[25:29] so your character is how many times you
[25:31] obey versus disobey
[25:33] now does that help anybody right
[25:35] right I still remember the first time I
[25:37] went to that message or one of the first
[25:38] times I went to The Message Church up
[25:39] there in Sheffield Brother Richard
[25:41] Sanchez was doing a Sunday school and my
[25:43] wife and I walked in there we're with
[25:45] some of the teenagers where I think
[25:46] we're already married at that point yeah
[25:47] I've already married at that point
[25:49] and uh the first Bible study was on
[25:51] Christian character
[25:53] and brother Richard said I want to
[25:55] define character he said character is
[25:57] your moral makeup and from that moment
[25:59] I've always remembered that
[26:01] it's all the decisions where you make
[26:03] the right choice
[26:04] now think about this morning did you
[26:06] make right choices this morning
[26:08] how about yesterday did you make the
[26:10] right moral choices yesterday or did you
[26:13] disobey right
[26:15] right if we disobeyed church that's why
[26:17] we've got a sacrifice
[26:18] that's why we've got the blood of Jesus
[26:20] Christ that's why we got the power of
[26:22] confession Hallelujah
[26:24] if you confess if we confess he's
[26:26] faithful and just to forgive us not sub
[26:28] but all of our unrighteousness
[26:31] he's faithful that's what the Bible says
[26:35] and so God was with Solomon mightily as
[26:38] long as Solomon was with God then
[26:40] Solomon a second wife in third wife
[26:43] hundred thousand I'm sorry 500 and
[26:47] thousands he let all these wives in
[26:50] and the Bible said they turned his heart
[26:52] away from God
[26:54] anything that turns your heart away from
[26:56] God is an idol right yes
[26:59] did anything try to turn your heart away
[27:02] from God this week watch it right
[27:04] overcome it praise God
[27:06] don't let your heart be turned away from
[27:09] God to try to serve some other purpose
[27:14] like I should like I've said before you
[27:15] know some people that have left our
[27:17] church you know as I've talked to them
[27:19] their hearts were turned away towards
[27:21] business more than the word of God their
[27:23] hearts were turned away more towards
[27:25] um
[27:26] family they wanted to be with their
[27:28] family more than come to church
[27:30] think about that these things they
[27:32] become Idols your family they become an
[27:34] idol
[27:36] right business trying to get a better
[27:38] business and trying to get out of debt
[27:40] to you know early and trying to
[27:42] establish yourself all these things they
[27:44] could become idols
[27:46] but there's nothing worse there's no
[27:48] Idol that's really worth spending your
[27:49] time you're giving your praise you
[27:51] there's only one worthy of Praise
[27:53] Hallelujah Jesus is Worthy of all your
[27:55] praise Hallelujah
[27:57] amen
[27:59] nothing is worth it and that's the story
[28:01] of these Kings it's the story of New
[28:04] Testament Kings and Priests as well
[28:06] Hallelujah
[28:09] remember Solomon had so much wisdom no
[28:12] man was ever like him in wisdom think of
[28:14] think of like the parallel today we
[28:16] could have a person where no one has as
[28:19] much Divine Healing no one has as much
[28:21] testimonies in their life but yet they
[28:23] can still forsake their gifts
[28:25] and they can make Idols in their lives
[28:27] and they can fall away from the things
[28:28] of God
[28:31] Kings must rely upon the Lord
[28:35] that's the thought Kings must rely on
[28:37] the Lord so no matter how gifted you are
[28:39] no matter how many testimonies you have
[28:41] we have to maintain our walk with God
[28:44] we've got to continually give God praise
[28:47] and that's why you're here today praise
[28:49] God hallelujah now remember every King
[28:52] was compared to David
[28:54] because he was a man after God's Own
[28:56] Heart and because uh the Bible said God
[28:58] said I'm making a covenant with you
[29:00] David and all your people after you
[29:03] praise God
[29:04] that was in second chronicles 21 verse
[29:06] 12.
[29:08] and there came a writing to him from
[29:10] Elijah the Prophet this is speaking of
[29:11] jeho RAM
[29:13] saying thus saith the Lord God of David
[29:15] thy father blessed I'm sorry because
[29:18] thou has not walked in the ways of
[29:19] Jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways
[29:22] of Asa king of Judah
[29:25] okay so David thy father
[29:28] all right I got the wrong verse no it's
[29:29] verse 13. yeah it is but Alice walked in
[29:31] the way of the Kings of Israel and it's
[29:33] made Judah inhabitants of Jerusalem to
[29:35] go ahorn
[29:36] like to the of the House of David
[29:38] and also I slain thy brother of thy
[29:41] father's house which were better than
[29:42] thy selves all right see he didn't walk
[29:46] in the ways of the the good Kings he
[29:49] walked in the ways of the fathers right
[29:51] a church that's how we're going to be
[29:53] we're either going to walk in the ways
[29:55] of Christ or walk in the ways of
[29:56] laodicea right one or the other which
[30:00] ways are we to walk in we must find the
[30:02] ways of God and walk in them Hallelujah
[30:06] which past should we choose we should
[30:08] choose the path that pleases God that
[30:10] honors God because God has orders our
[30:12] steps let's stay on the Narrow Path
[30:14] Hallelujah
[30:16] Church remember the Bible said it on the
[30:17] Narrow Path very few people find this
[30:19] road
[30:20] so when you're really walking and
[30:22] serving God there's only a few people
[30:24] you can fellowship with about it because
[30:26] there's not many people on this road
[30:28] they don't know what it's like
[30:30] right they're just going with the flow
[30:31] of the world like I like there's this
[30:33] one Pastor uh the kids know who his name
[30:36] is I'm not going to call his name but
[30:37] he's not in the message but he asked me
[30:39] months ago he's like can you just keep
[30:40] in touch with me to keep me encouraged
[30:42] I'm always encouraged when I see you
[30:44] so I sent him these texts over the over
[30:46] the course of these last few months he's
[30:48] like wow I needed that well I needed
[30:49] that and then some of them you don't
[30:50] reply to
[30:52] right because he maybe just can't relate
[30:54] to that one I think one was about
[30:55] dancing you know rejoicing he couldn't
[30:57] he couldn't relate to that one he said
[30:58] oh I wish I could have that
[31:01] you know and there's just some people
[31:03] that you can really relate to and other
[31:05] people you can't relate to right
[31:08] all right right
[31:09] because they're walking to Broadway and
[31:11] everybody relates to them with their
[31:13] sinful lives but there's only a certain
[31:15] people in a church I'll say like this it
[31:16] ought to be the people in this church
[31:18] that you can relate to
[31:20] remember the church the Bible said if
[31:22] you run if you want a friend you got to
[31:24] show yourself friendly
[31:27] if you want somebody to encourage you
[31:28] text you or call you you've got to call
[31:31] them and text them too
[31:33] Hallelujah you want a friend show
[31:35] yourself a friend praise God
[31:39] that's exactly right but there's not
[31:41] many people we can fellowship with like
[31:43] for me I was telling Austin and I do
[31:45] this with Cam and Simon and other
[31:46] brothers I send them voice messages and
[31:48] we just talk about the scripture back
[31:50] and forth because I don't have time to
[31:51] call them like how many times have
[31:53] happened people call me and I'm taking
[31:54] one of my children to the restroom or
[31:56] something like that people want to talk
[31:58] or I'm right in the middle of studying I
[32:00] only have a certain like amount of time
[32:01] before church and I can't take the calls
[32:03] but I can sure get back to your
[32:04] voicemail later
[32:06] now the brothers might from South
[32:08] America might want to talk to me well I
[32:10] can't talk to them right now
[32:11] so I like that and there's only and it's
[32:14] amazing Church in many of those
[32:15] conversations they're studying or
[32:17] preaching along the very same lines that
[32:18] I've been preaching on
[32:21] like uh and then a couple weeks ago I
[32:23] saw a couple months ago it's always a
[32:25] couple weeks ago but it's usually not a
[32:27] couple weeks ago I saw a pastor from one
[32:29] of the chapel churches I said how's it
[32:31] going how you doing and the first thing
[32:33] you got into Church politics that's what
[32:35] he was inspired by it was about the time
[32:37] we had those Revival services so I was
[32:39] testifying we're dancing and praise the
[32:40] Lord and he's like well our churches are
[32:43] trying to break up and uh from this
[32:45] organization and that was the big news
[32:47] now that's fine if you're going through
[32:49] that
[32:49] but like I couldn't I couldn't
[32:51] fellowship with him about the things of
[32:53] God
[32:54] because his things were about his
[32:57] Fellowship was about church politics
[33:00] now we all got to go through struggles
[33:01] we all got to go through trials
[33:03] but we should be felt we should be
[33:05] trying to encourage one another the
[33:06] Bible said we should provoke one another
[33:08] praise God
[33:09] unto good works
[33:12] right provoke one another find a way to
[33:14] encourage one another by the grace of
[33:16] God hallelujah
[33:18] amen
[33:20] so we're they're all compared to David
[33:22] I'll say like this we're all compared to
[33:24] Christ Hallelujah we ought to be like
[33:26] King Jesus
[33:29] everyone's compared to David because he
[33:31] was a man after God's Own Heart
[33:34] Hallelujah let's make our lives after
[33:37] the will of God Amen oh brother Jess
[33:39] Howard Street well I was seeking God I
[33:41] was digging in the scriptures Hallelujah
[33:43] I was trying to answer people's
[33:45] questions I was trying to answer my own
[33:46] questions praise God
[33:49] like this week I was digging in the
[33:50] sermon marriage and divorce and Emma
[33:52] listened to it this week too because we
[33:53] mentioned it on Kristen's testimony that
[33:56] was I was surprised I was like wow I
[33:58] forgot about that that was awesome I
[33:59] forgot about that not going to explain
[34:01] that now yeah I remember what it means
[34:04] and it was interesting and then uh one
[34:06] of the accusers brother random put out a
[34:08] podcast about how that was a bad sermon
[34:10] those people just they're just so far
[34:12] gone we just got to keep praying for
[34:13] them it was a highly anointed sermon
[34:16] praise God highly accurate sermon but
[34:18] it's rough I mean some of those things
[34:20] are pretty rough
[34:23] like I mean like imagine Elijah going up
[34:25] and telling Ahab and Jezebel the dogs
[34:27] will lick your blood would that be easy
[34:29] thing to preach
[34:31] no like my man said imagine going up to
[34:33] a woman and say hi Mrs dog meat
[34:35] right
[34:37] it's hard it's rough yeah
[34:40] yeah but I'm going to preach on this
[34:41] later too Jesus went to the desire of
[34:43] hornetian woman and he said it's not fit
[34:45] to give the dogs meat right now how many
[34:48] would like Jesus to call you a dog I'll
[34:50] probably preach a whole servant on that
[34:53] Jesus called her a dog
[34:57] in other words
[34:59] you uh we say like this you're a lower
[35:01] level of society
[35:03] you don't you don't get the children's
[35:05] bread because you're a lower level
[35:06] Society now what does that get into that
[35:09] ends into a sermon I heard one time I
[35:10] would like to preach it called wrestling
[35:12] with God
[35:13] you're no longer wrestling against flesh
[35:15] and blood all these desires you know
[35:17] like brothers all these Desires in our
[35:18] hearts our sisters the desires we want
[35:20] the new things the new dresses or
[35:21] shopping or whatever
[35:23] it's not wrestling against flesh and
[35:25] blood
[35:26] it's not even wrestling against
[35:27] spiritual Wicked principalities and
[35:30] Powers but it's wrestling against God
[35:34] how many like to hear a sermon on that I
[35:36] like to preach it
[35:38] how would you like that
[35:40] when even as soon as you cry to God and
[35:42] God is testing you
[35:44] to see if you can overcome the test but
[35:47] church he wouldn't test you unless he
[35:48] knew you would overcome praise God
[35:50] hallelujah
[35:54] like when brother Brandon just says he
[35:56] my wife mentioned in the testimony he
[35:58] said God you owe me you owe me an
[36:00] explanation of why this woman died with
[36:02] these young children and brother Adam
[36:04] said God put a black sheep down between
[36:06] him spiritually and wouldn't hear his
[36:08] prayers for two weeks
[36:10] two weeks that's that's what that's what
[36:12] we see in the Bible right God will he'll
[36:14] pull his anointing away from people
[36:17] and we'll just say things like we
[36:19] shouldn't say
[36:22] right but the thing to do is keep coming
[36:23] to God keep coming to because he's
[36:25] trying to teach you something amen watch
[36:29] your mouth and the church said amen can
[36:31] I say this watch your dirty mouth
[36:34] watch your corrupt sinful mouth
[36:36] don't get in the flesh
[36:38] and demand things from God like you or
[36:40] God or you know about it
[36:43] there's great lessons to learn
[36:44] Hallelujah
[36:46] sometimes churches they take years and
[36:48] years and years to learn
[36:52] right like Saul had to learn these
[36:53] lessons years and years and years of
[36:56] Disobedience he finally learned the
[36:58] lesson at the end of his life
[36:59] he stopped chasing David
[37:01] he got his heart ready so he could go
[37:03] home right to be with Samuel
[37:05] man come on
[37:09] but God is faithful in all of it
[37:11] God is loving in all of it God is
[37:14] merciful in all of it praise God
[37:16] you're still his child you're still the
[37:18] one he's fighting for but sometimes he's
[37:21] got to give us trials to fight for us
[37:23] to teach us to obey the word of God
[37:27] now
[37:28] let's go to Second Chronicles chapter
[37:30] 11.
[37:35] and some of these were just a blessing
[37:37] to me and so I hope there'll be a
[37:38] blessing you second chronicles 11.
[37:42] now as you're turning there I want to
[37:44] look at rehoboam and jeroboam for a
[37:45] little bit they're both Kings and
[37:46] Israel's divided kingdoms and I'm
[37:48] reading off a website here of this first
[37:49] part but we'll get to the scripture so
[37:51] go to Second Chronicles 11 17.
[37:54] rehoboam was one of Solomon's sons and
[37:56] king of Judah in the South jeroboam was
[37:58] one of Solomon's former officials in
[38:00] ephraimite and king of Israel in the
[38:03] North
[38:05] okay
[38:06] so rehoboam uh was Solomon's son and he
[38:10] reigned in the southern part Judah so he
[38:12] got the rain where there was the Temple
[38:14] of the Lord right he got the Reign where
[38:17] the priests were think about that he
[38:18] reigned where the ark was right the
[38:21] church was stumbles me sometimes
[38:23] but I realized later what stumbles me is
[38:25] that all those candies brother bang
[38:27] could have had their priests their High
[38:29] priests walk into the presence of the
[38:31] Ark and get thus saith the Lord and yet
[38:33] they didn't do it
[38:35] think about that brother
[38:37] they had the pillar of Fire
[38:40] they had God's Own presence God said
[38:42] I'll dwell in this house that Solomon
[38:44] made
[38:45] and yet they failed to do it now Church
[38:47] nothing spiritually is that any
[38:48] different from us
[38:50] we might not have a spiritual Pillar of
[38:53] Fire but we we know he promised to be
[38:55] here right right Hallelujah and the
[38:57] church said amen
[38:59] like he promised I'll never leave you
[39:01] know Forsaken and then Jesus said
[39:03] brother man and uh uh Acacia you're more
[39:05] blessed if you haven't seen it yet
[39:07] believed amen
[39:09] right
[39:11] now I love these message churches you
[39:12] know some of them say well we saw the
[39:13] pillar of firearies that's great but the
[39:15] Bible said you're more blessed if you
[39:17] don't see it and still believe
[39:19] Hallelujah
[39:20] I'm glad they've seen it I'm glad you
[39:22] know that's wonderful
[39:24] Hallelujah that just means they got more
[39:26] responsibility
[39:27] God actually lets you see those things
[39:29] like Billy Paul Billy Paul saw
[39:32] uh the angel Lord that visited brother
[39:34] Brown I think when he was 16 years old
[39:35] I'm not mistaken I could have been a
[39:37] little later
[39:38] do you remember the exact year
[39:41] and brother man said God let Billy Paul
[39:44] see the angel so Billy Paul would work
[39:46] with him in the ministry and support the
[39:48] ministry
[39:49] and then and then Billy Paul now of
[39:51] course I know he's off the word
[39:52] but angels visited lots of people that
[39:55] weren't on the word
[39:57] Hallelujah
[39:59] but the point was we're all given these
[40:02] experiences but then we got to be
[40:03] accountable to God with them
[40:05] who remembers how many times did Solomon
[40:07] see God twice
[40:09] twice he saw it God in a vision
[40:12] think about that church he's I'll say I
[40:14] just he saw the pillar of fire he saw
[40:15] Jesus Christ but then he let all these
[40:18] women take his heart away from serving
[40:19] God
[40:21] we must not do that we must rule our
[40:24] Dominion Hallelujah we must conquer the
[40:27] enemy we must possess the land
[40:29] Hallelujah
[40:31] I was hoping for a few more amens than
[40:32] that Hallelujah that's okay God's in I
[40:35] gotta be patient Hallelujah they're the
[40:37] waiting upon the Lord shall renew their
[40:38] strength Hallelujah
[40:41] second chronicles 11 17 so they
[40:43] strengthen the kingdom of Judah and made
[40:45] rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three
[40:47] years for three years they walked in the
[40:50] way of David Solomon think about that
[40:52] what a testimony
[40:54] three years he walked where David walked
[40:58] three years he walked like Solomon
[41:00] walked
[41:01] hallelujah how many would be blessed if
[41:04] God could look down and say for three
[41:06] years she walked like brother Brandon
[41:08] walked
[41:10] Hallelujah
[41:11] and I would say like this for three
[41:13] years he walked like Saint Paul walked
[41:17] Hallelujah
[41:19] or Saint Peter three years
[41:22] this man had a testimony for three years
[41:26] but then he forsook it
[41:30] look at the next chapter second
[41:31] chronicles 12 verse 1 and it came to
[41:33] pass when rehoboam had established the
[41:34] kingdom and strengthened himself he
[41:36] forsook the law of the Lord and all
[41:38] Israel with him
[41:39] verse two and it came to pass that the
[41:41] fifth year of king rehoboam shyshack
[41:44] king of Egypt came against him I'm sorry
[41:46] came up against Jerusalem because they
[41:47] had transgressed against the Lord
[41:49] so let me just put this in modern terms
[41:54] while Rambo was seeking God God was
[41:58] blessing him but when he got strong and
[42:00] when he got comfortable I'll say this
[42:02] when he got a little Prosperity that's
[42:05] when he first took God whenever we
[42:07] needed plenty of savings now I'm sure
[42:08] that supplies when we got plenty of
[42:10] money plenty of food and everything
[42:12] everything's going good isn't that use
[42:14] of the time when we fall away from
[42:16] seeking God
[42:17] this is what happened to Rainbow
[42:19] for three years he strengthened himself
[42:21] he put uh he put garrisons up he put up
[42:24] fences around the cities he just made
[42:27] himself strong and then he just kind of
[42:28] got lazy
[42:30] no more battles to fight
[42:32] because then he started transgressing
[42:34] against the ways of God
[42:36] oh I can dabble a little bit into
[42:38] pornography
[42:40] right I can dabble a little bit uh into
[42:43] gossip
[42:45] I can dab a little bit into these uh get
[42:49] rich quick schemes
[42:51] or I can I can pull this I don't have to
[42:53] report this to the IRS I can do this and
[42:55] make a few extra bucks
[42:56] you see
[42:59] when things are comfortable people often
[43:02] compromise
[43:05] that's right but for three years rainbow
[43:09] walked like David and Solomon
[43:13] and church you know brother Brandon says
[43:14] you know the Bible says and we know the
[43:16] song says we'll walk where the apostles
[43:18] have tried how many know that song the
[43:20] day of redemption is there men's hearts
[43:21] are failing to fulfilled be filled with
[43:23] the spirit your land should be clear
[43:24] look up your Redemption is near Church
[43:27] how many want to walk where the apostles
[43:28] walked amen I mean that's kind of like
[43:30] our our end goal right we want to see
[43:32] the latter rain right we want to see
[43:34] rapturing faith
[43:36] but we can't fall away from God and
[43:38] expect it to happen we got to keep
[43:39] drawing closer to God
[43:42] Hallelujah
[43:43] walking where the apostles have tried as
[43:46] I told you Church
[43:48] as far as Supernatural the greatest I've
[43:50] seen is in South America and Trinidad
[43:53] when I made the greatest sacrifices for
[43:55] God
[43:56] at least the far as numbers of Miracles
[43:58] now we don't know how many miracles
[44:00] there will be in the squeeze
[44:01] I tell you to be in America just have
[44:03] rapturing faith Hallelujah that's a good
[44:05] enough miracle for me praise God right
[44:07] Hallelujah
[44:11] but with great sacrifice God will honor
[44:13] great sacrifice he'll honor with great
[44:15] vindication
[44:17] that's what we want we want God to
[44:18] vindicate Our Lives
[44:20] Hallelujah
[44:23] now let's look at a scripture
[44:26] let's go down to verse 7.
[44:29] so rehoboam gets off the word
[44:32] but then God sends a prophet to give him
[44:34] thus saith the Lord to bring him back in
[44:36] line
[44:38] verse 7 and when the Lord saw that they
[44:40] humble themselves the word Lord came to
[44:42] shamaya saying they have humbled
[44:44] themselves therefore I will not destroy
[44:46] them but I will grant them some
[44:47] deliverance and my wrath shall not be
[44:49] poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of
[44:52] shishek
[44:54] so let's let's just rehearse briefly
[44:56] Ramones serving God with all of his
[44:58] heart then he backslides he goes against
[45:00] the word God sends a prophet he repents
[45:03] and then God gives him some everybody
[45:05] say some
[45:07] the Bible didn't say all God gave him
[45:09] some Deliverance
[45:11] this is why Saints you know sometimes
[45:12] people will get some healing but not all
[45:15] the healing
[45:16] right
[45:17] or they'll get some victory in their
[45:19] lives but not all the victory in their
[45:21] lives
[45:23] it's because they've transgressed the
[45:25] word of God and they haven't fully
[45:27] served God with all their hearts
[45:29] now we don't want to be possessors of
[45:31] sub-promises we want to be possessors of
[45:34] all the promises who wants to possess
[45:36] all promises
[45:38] Hallelujah
[45:40] well this is a scripture just like uh FF
[45:42] Bosworth they asked him they said what's
[45:45] the verse that somebody can lose their
[45:46] healing remember that
[45:48] and FF Bosworth said it was Peter
[45:50] walking on the water
[45:52] as long as he was looking at Jesus he
[45:54] was walking in Supernatural Victory
[45:56] right right
[45:57] but then when he got his eyes off of
[45:58] Jesus he lost his Supernatural work
[46:01] same thing today God can heal us
[46:04] but if we get our eyes off the word of
[46:06] God if we get distracted we can get sick
[46:08] again
[46:09] praise God
[46:11] but God wants our eyes on him let's look
[46:14] to the Cross let's look to the Bible
[46:16] let's look to the Holy Ghost let's keep
[46:18] our eyes totally focused on Jesus Christ
[46:21] amen
[46:23] Glory
[46:26] now one thing about Redbone though he
[46:28] had a rough start because he was rough
[46:30] with the people
[46:32] this is a good reminder let's be gentle
[46:34] with people
[46:34] now sometimes we got to be rough with
[46:36] our children parents so don't get me
[46:37] wrong on that if you spare the rod he
[46:39] spoil the child
[46:41] there's times to be rough but there's
[46:42] times to be merciful right so go to
[46:45] Second Chronicles 10 15. you remember
[46:46] this
[46:48] second chronicles 10 15.
[46:52] so rehoboam is the uh freshly anointed
[46:55] king
[46:57] Solomon anointed him before he died
[47:00] second chronicles 10.
[47:02] remember the story
[47:05] Northern Israel came down to rehoboam
[47:07] and said
[47:09] if you lighten our taxes a little bit if
[47:11] you let up on our taxes we'll serve you
[47:13] we'll serve you with all of our hearts
[47:16] and so Ray above said call me the old
[47:18] man let me talk to the old men let's see
[47:20] what they say the old men thought about
[47:21] it and the wise men they said yes you
[47:23] should be merciful
[47:26] a rehoboam should have took the wisdom
[47:27] of the elders
[47:29] now the elders doesn't always have
[47:31] wisdom right Church
[47:33] right there's a lot of older message
[47:34] preachers out of gate got way off the
[47:36] word of God
[47:37] so I would not take their counsel
[47:39] but in this case rehoboam should have
[47:42] took their counsel
[47:44] be merciful these people have been under
[47:46] bondage
[47:48] they've been under a stress under
[47:50] Solomon they had to give everything
[47:51] they're giving their sons and daughters
[47:52] away they've given such high taxes so we
[47:55] can have all these blessings
[47:57] and then what does rehoboam do you
[48:00] remember what he does he goes and asks
[48:02] his friends that are his age his young
[48:04] inexperienced
[48:06] lacking wisdom friends
[48:08] and what are the young friends tell him
[48:12] they said
[48:13] say
[48:15] if my if my father was like uh my father
[48:18] was like I forget what animal he said he
[48:20] said then if you thought my father was
[48:21] rough I'll be like a scorpion to you
[48:24] right so Redbone thinks about it for
[48:27] three days which one does he do
[48:29] he does the foolish thing
[48:31] instead of giving the people a break he
[48:34] makes their burdens harder and harder
[48:36] and harder
[48:37] right so this is a good lesson if you're
[48:40] a kingdom priest unto God look at what
[48:42] people have been going through and
[48:43] sometimes you got to show them Mercy
[48:45] praise God
[48:47] so like for me sometimes I cancel the
[48:49] second service to give everybody a
[48:51] little break
[48:52] okay but I say like this it's never been
[48:55] a burden to go to God's house
[48:57] I've never ever ever
[48:59] one time felt it was a burn to go to
[49:01] church I've never left this church and
[49:04] said I regret going I wish I would not
[49:05] go on God knows my heart I've never said
[49:07] that right it's always a blessing that
[49:09] you play that piano hear that organ and
[49:11] sing praises to Jesus Christ
[49:14] but what I mean is sometimes you get
[49:16] busy in life and you just want some rest
[49:17] well that's why they make Labor Day
[49:20] that's right you got Monday
[49:22] Hallelujah and you got
[49:26] phase Brothers
[49:27] take a day if you need a day
[49:30] serving God is always a blessing praise
[49:33] God
[49:38] but church then we learn from the
[49:39] scripture God had to have rehoboam make
[49:42] this rough decision because God had
[49:44] already pronounced a temporary judgment
[49:47] on Solomon his dad
[49:50] right because Solomon let all these
[49:52] Wives come in and build up their he
[49:53] built all their uh houses of worship God
[49:56] said because of that I'm going to raise
[49:58] up jeroboam and he's going to take half
[50:00] he took he took ten twelfths of the
[50:02] Kingdom there was only two tribes that
[50:04] followed rayabo right
[50:07] right talk about losing what's that 80
[50:08] of your kingdom
[50:11] maybe more
[50:13] because of his sins he knew better the
[50:16] wisest man knew better than to have all
[50:18] those women
[50:19] and church we're wise men and women
[50:21] today we know better not to go into
[50:23] sinful things and the church said
[50:26] amen We Know Better
[50:28] Hallelujah
[50:30] so see rehoboam got some victory but not
[50:34] all the victory
[50:35] sometimes we'll get some victory but we
[50:38] want all the victory praise God
[50:41] like you've heard people say you know
[50:42] they people say well give me a refilling
[50:44] of the Holy Spirit and we know what that
[50:45] means that means my mind is again ready
[50:48] to see God I just want to see God every
[50:50] day I want to listen to sermons I want
[50:52] to pray all the time I want to
[50:53] Fellowship I want to be around God's
[50:55] people I want more of God hallelujah
[50:57] amen thank God Amen I want to read the
[50:59] church age but yeah all that Zeal right
[51:01] I'm gonna read the seal book
[51:04] you got all that zeal
[51:06] you're back on fire again you got your
[51:08] first love again how many I don't
[51:09] understand what I'm saying
[51:12] I'm gonna go listen that marriage in
[51:13] divorce I'm gonna go listen to trying
[51:14] new God of service without it being his
[51:16] will
[51:17] you got your first love back
[51:20] Hallelujah
[51:22] member Church the Bible says in second
[51:24] Peter 1 3 according as his divine power
[51:28] is given unto us all things that pertain
[51:30] to life and godliness God has given us
[51:32] all things we need to live a Christian
[51:33] life but the Bible says we've got to
[51:36] give all of our diligence
[51:38] so let's just put that up there uh
[51:41] second Peter 1 5. uh Malachi we go back
[51:44] there I think Acacia stepped out for a
[51:45] moment she's probably serving one of the
[51:47] little lambs back there
[51:50] the Bible said in uh II Peter 1 5. and
[51:54] besides this giving all diligence add to
[51:56] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[51:57] knowledge there's very cheap there she
[51:59] smiled
[52:00] Daddy's you're like that sermon I'm glad
[52:02] he did Hallelujah
[52:03] I still remember that
[52:07] so God's given you every blessing but to
[52:11] get it it's conditional you've got to
[52:13] give all of your time and energy to it
[52:18] we can stand here and Shout thank God
[52:20] he's given all this time but then thank
[52:22] God he's giving me everything I could
[52:23] ever want but now you've got to give
[52:25] something to get it
[52:27] it's conditional and I heard of someone
[52:29] on this I want to preach this too every
[52:31] time God gave a promise it was always
[52:33] conditional almost every time
[52:35] remember the one uh Solomon prays
[52:38] Solomon said If my people humble
[52:40] themselves and pray
[52:42] and call out to God I'll hear their
[52:44] prayer from heaven and I'll heal the
[52:45] heal their land let me know what I'm
[52:47] talking about that famous prayer
[52:48] If my people who were called by my name
[52:50] will humble themselves and pray
[52:53] I'll forgive their sins and heal their
[52:55] land right but what's the first word in
[52:58] that promise if
[53:01] if
[53:02] right
[53:03] if like I was telling my barber the
[53:06] other day
[53:07] oh yeah yesterday when I got my haircut
[53:08] I was telling them
[53:10] we're talking about abortion and I said
[53:12] I said you know there's I think there's
[53:14] eight or nine states that have no more
[53:16] abortion they've estimated that I think
[53:18] 20 or 30 000 babies lives have been
[53:20] saved
[53:23] that powerful
[53:25] Thirty A Thousand Lives have been saved
[53:27] and he was saying well that might that
[53:30] might mean they just take their
[53:30] abortions to other heirs well they might
[53:32] they might but they might not
[53:34] right and I said either way there's less
[53:37] sin being done in those States so when
[53:39] there's less sin there's more of God
[53:42] is that right
[53:43] that's what God's saying heal their land
[53:46] and I told him I said I'm praying that
[53:48] for Ohio and we got a first chance to
[53:49] vote for it right we got a first chance
[53:51] of vote in November
[53:53] to keep all this trans nonsense out and
[53:55] this abortions up to birth we got our
[53:57] first chance not only our prayers but we
[53:59] got to do with our votes too right right
[54:02] if you don't believe in that then you
[54:03] don't believe that our founding fathers
[54:05] did the right thing
[54:06] by giving their lives to give us these
[54:09] freedoms
[54:11] they could have sat back and said well
[54:12] just trust God to do it we'll just trust
[54:14] God to give us the freedom that yeah
[54:15] well they did trust God when they went
[54:17] and got their guns out too
[54:19] right
[54:20] George Washington just didn't say well
[54:22] if God wants us to beat the British
[54:24] we'll defeat him
[54:25] you know God God will do it all no
[54:26] George Washington went out there and
[54:28] prayed
[54:29] he went out there and led the the
[54:31] soldiers in the battle how many want to
[54:34] be soldiers for God Amen do something
[54:37] about it praise God
[54:38] call upon God and do as much good as you
[54:41] possibly can praise God
[54:43] so God's given you all things but you've
[54:45] got to give all of your desire you got
[54:48] to give all your diligence to God to get
[54:50] him
[54:51] right
[54:53] just like if you're at a vending machine
[54:55] right if you're in a vending machine all
[54:57] those things are given to you but you
[54:58] got to give something up to get it right
[55:01] you got to give something up whatever
[55:03] you want you got to give something up to
[55:04] God it's it's all free right there
[55:06] that's all free but it's all available
[55:09] and God says draw not to me I'll draw an
[55:12] eye to you
[55:15] feels like we're a little tired today is
[55:16] everybody a little tired today
[55:17] looking forward to going to bed early
[55:19] tonight or something like that
[55:22] I was a little tired today huh
[55:26] now go if you would uh First Kings 12
[55:29] 25.
[55:31] I know what that's like Dude I agree
[55:33] First Kings uh 12 25.
[55:39] I step in today so I'm feeling pretty
[55:41] good
[55:42] maybe you couldn't sleep in First Kings
[55:44] 12 25.
[55:46] now one thing about jeroboam I want to
[55:48] bring out
[55:50] if you don't remember this
[55:53] jeroboam was up north he was far away
[55:56] from the temple of God and remember God
[55:58] said there's only one place I'm placing
[56:00] my name and that's at the ark the house
[56:03] of God I'll put my name in other place
[56:05] you can't pray to any other place you
[56:08] can't sacrifice any other place there's
[56:10] one place for our place my name and
[56:11] brother we haven't come and preach it
[56:12] and said there's one provided place of
[56:14] worship that's Jesus Christ
[56:17] amen it's not Jeffersonville it's not
[56:19] Akron Ohio there's one place it's Jesus
[56:22] Christ it's God's own son Hallelujah
[56:25] so listen to that one if you haven't
[56:26] listened to that one lately God's
[56:27] provided a place to worship
[56:30] if I can't point you to denomination if
[56:33] God hasn't placed his name in the
[56:35] nomination he said where am I going to
[56:36] appoint you to he said I can't point you
[56:38] to the Branham Tabernacle we're just as
[56:40] bad off as any of them
[56:42] in other words you can't trust in a
[56:44] church to save you you got to trust in
[56:46] Jesus Christ to save you praise God
[56:48] that's God's provided place of worship
[56:51] Hallelujah
[56:54] so look at this instead of being united
[56:56] instead of jeroboam being united
[56:59] with a rehoboam and with all of Israel
[57:03] he says he was fearful that he would
[57:05] lose his kingdom
[57:07] so what does he do he sets up Idols
[57:10] where the people can go worship and
[57:12] sacrifice to God he sets up gods in
[57:15] other words exactly what Moses said not
[57:18] to do right Moses said don't make any
[57:21] Graven image
[57:23] right and then he goes exactly against
[57:25] what Solomon said do
[57:29] now I'm gonna
[57:31] verse 27 here's what he says in his
[57:34] heart if this people go up to do
[57:35] sacrifice in the house of the Lord of
[57:36] Jerusalem then shall the heart of this
[57:38] people will turn again unto their lord
[57:39] even an arabome king of Judah and they
[57:41] shall kill me and go again to rehoboam
[57:43] King of Judah in other words if my
[57:46] people go visit this other Church
[57:49] is that right
[57:51] I'm going to lose all my people so I
[57:54] better set up Gods I've always said like
[57:56] this if you'd like to go somewhere else
[57:57] that's fine just leave this church in
[57:59] peace
[58:00] leave us in peace because we want you to
[58:02] be on Beast too Hallelujah
[58:05] I've never asked anybody to come to this
[58:06] church I never begged anybody to come to
[58:08] church now you got to go to church
[58:10] we just want the people that God wants
[58:12] to be here praise God as I've said many
[58:14] times but jeremon got so uh insecure I'm
[58:18] going to lose all my people I better
[58:20] break the word of God and set up a way
[58:22] where I can keep them under my control
[58:24] see a real man of God knows that the
[58:27] people have to let God control their
[58:28] lives they have to choose to let God
[58:31] control their lives
[58:32] I cannot control your life I can reach
[58:34] the word of God tell you
[58:36] probably pray about this but ultimately
[58:38] it's your choice praise God
[58:40] hallelujah it's your choice it's my
[58:42] choice it's my choice
[58:46] the Bible said a an elder leads by
[58:48] example
[58:49] watch my life that's why I try to give
[58:51] testimonies in my life when I went
[58:52] through difficult times
[58:54] I tried to make sacrifices and trusting
[58:56] God and every time God was faithful
[58:58] praise God he's still faithful praise
[59:00] God
[59:02] Hallelujah
[59:04] now
[59:05] verse 28 whereupon the king took counsel
[59:08] and made two calves of gold and said
[59:10] unto them it is too much for you to go
[59:11] up to Jerusalem
[59:13] Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought
[59:15] thee up out of the land of Egypt
[59:18] and he said one in Bethel and the other
[59:19] he put in Dan
[59:22] so here he goes to the he goes with this
[59:24] deception of you know
[59:26] it's too hard to worship it's too far to
[59:28] drive to church
[59:30] church is too long the preacher preaches
[59:32] way too long
[59:34] you haven't seen nothing brother every
[59:36] six hours I haven't reached half of that
[59:38] to you ever I don't even know the
[59:40] longest server I ever preacher maybe two
[59:41] hours maybe
[59:43] I know maybe it might seem long to some
[59:44] of us but that's another brand
[59:46] most of his servants are at least three
[59:47] hours long most of them
[59:50] but see here it gets it gets on the
[59:52] people he tries to make it easier on the
[59:54] people oh it's too hard there's excuses
[59:57] you really can't obey even though Simon
[59:59] said that you can't obey that just
[1:00:01] compromise
[1:00:02] all right just just cut out a few
[1:00:04] Corners here you don't have to obey all
[1:00:06] the word of God no we've got to obey the
[1:00:08] saith the Lord
[1:00:12] Hallelujah
[1:00:13] now brother Brandon used this verse
[1:00:16] uh to show removal from the name's book
[1:00:19] of life so occasions we switch over on a
[1:00:22] show this again just as a reminder I
[1:00:24] thought this would be important to show
[1:00:29] because
[1:00:31] uh Gerald
[1:00:33] everyone set up these Idols in Dan and
[1:00:36] listen Dan let him set it up the people
[1:00:39] of Dan let this Idol be set up church
[1:00:41] let me say like this you don't have to
[1:00:43] let Idols be set up in your life
[1:00:45] you don't have to compromise you're
[1:00:48] called to be a king you're called to
[1:00:50] rule your house
[1:00:51] the church said
[1:00:52] amen you don't have to let sinful things
[1:00:54] come in your house it's your house
[1:00:56] you're called to rule over praise God
[1:00:59] Hallelujah
[1:01:00] like as a leader as a man I can say this
[1:01:03] is happening this isn't happening
[1:01:06] Hallelujah I got that right it's my
[1:01:08] house
[1:01:09] I'm accountable for my house
[1:01:12] but Dan let it go oh it's gonna be
[1:01:14] easier on everybody but also there's the
[1:01:17] other side part of worship is sacrifice
[1:01:21] Jeremy was like you don't need to
[1:01:23] sacrifice so much but part of worship is
[1:01:25] sacrifice
[1:01:29] and the church said
[1:01:32] so here's the tribes that came out
[1:01:35] um here's The Tragically I'm sorry when
[1:01:36] they went to Egypt here's when they came
[1:01:37] out
[1:01:39] God took out Levi and Joseph and put it
[1:01:41] Ephraim in NASA
[1:01:44] I'm sorry put in Ephraim a day
[1:01:47] no I I got this mixed up pardon me
[1:01:50] no I took out Levi yeah Levi and Joseph
[1:01:52] were put out because he went to the
[1:01:54] priesthood and Joseph's two sons
[1:01:56] reported and that's obvious now
[1:01:58] Here's Where We Are
[1:02:02] we walking out because Dan let those
[1:02:04] Idols get set up his name was taken off
[1:02:07] of The Book of Life for Israel his tribe
[1:02:11] is taken off
[1:02:13] and there will be no tribe of Dan
[1:02:17] uh in the 144 000. think about that no
[1:02:20] tribe of Dan
[1:02:22] all because his ancestors think about
[1:02:24] that church some of our decisions impact
[1:02:26] our children
[1:02:28] if we're not careful some of our
[1:02:30] decisions may impact our grandchildren
[1:02:32] if the Lord's Aries
[1:02:34] now I know we're all looking for the
[1:02:35] Rapture who is it but every generation
[1:02:37] that's fast it's still still going on
[1:02:40] so we got it like right so you gotta
[1:02:42] plant your potatoes praise God
[1:02:45] it isn't until Ezekiel
[1:02:48] that Dan gets his name back in there
[1:02:52] what I'm trying to say is if we see
[1:02:54] items in our lives let's get them out of
[1:02:57] our land as soon as possible
[1:02:59] because if we do it proves our name was
[1:03:02] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:03:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:03:05] praise God
[1:03:06] didn't Peter set up the idol of I bet
[1:03:09] we're better than Gentiles and it beat
[1:03:11] yourself that Idol is like I'm not going
[1:03:13] to eat with the Gentiles we're holier
[1:03:15] than them and what Paul had to come
[1:03:17] around and point out that night on his
[1:03:18] life you can't have that in your life
[1:03:21] it's going to struggle you it's going to
[1:03:23] make you fall
[1:03:25] that's how many appreciate when the Holy
[1:03:27] Spirit comes around and shows you your
[1:03:28] faults
[1:03:30] the idols you've set up in your life
[1:03:31] like I said usually it's family
[1:03:34] uh less money
[1:03:36] what's the other one I use from the
[1:03:38] other example
[1:03:39] maybe it's physicians in the church
[1:03:42] you know I forget the other ones where
[1:03:44] people leave
[1:03:46] oh business yeah
[1:03:48] they set up these idols and if they're
[1:03:51] not careful it takes them away from God
[1:03:54] but we're not gonna let that happen how
[1:03:56] many how many will not let that happen
[1:03:58] you've got the power to do it you're a
[1:04:00] king you're a priest under God not only
[1:04:03] can you rule over it but you can pray or
[1:04:05] pray to God to remove it out of your
[1:04:07] life praise God because you're a priest
[1:04:09] Hallelujah
[1:04:10] all right I'm gonna try to find a place
[1:04:13] to close it's almost 12 here that'd be
[1:04:15] an hour and a half okay that's that's
[1:04:16] about my usual hour ahead
[1:04:18] um
[1:04:20] yeah I want to go through just a couple
[1:04:21] more examples how many enjoyed the word
[1:04:23] of God today a little bit of a review
[1:04:25] here but I hope it was helpful like I
[1:04:27] said now I'm gonna get the ones that
[1:04:28] were kind of even some of those with
[1:04:29] rainbow and we're really fresh and
[1:04:30] encouraging to me
[1:04:33] so I'm thinking wow now I've been
[1:04:35] pastoring 17 years what is my testimony
[1:04:37] brother Ben brother Jose I wonder what
[1:04:39] my testimony is in heaven what does God
[1:04:41] say about me
[1:04:43] has Jesse walked in the ways of Saint
[1:04:45] Paul I hope so for all these 17 years
[1:04:49] well one way for sure I know I can look
[1:04:51] at my life and line it up to the word of
[1:04:53] God
[1:04:54] I trust that's what it says by God's
[1:04:56] grace
[1:04:57] I don't want to be like Ray of Omer
[1:04:58] Jesse served God you know for 12 years
[1:05:00] but then after that he kind of left the
[1:05:02] truth
[1:05:03] I don't want that kind of testimony I
[1:05:06] want to testimony that I serve God all
[1:05:07] the days of my life
[1:05:09] praise God I did not let idols be set up
[1:05:13] in my lives and I did not bow down to
[1:05:15] any other God other than the god of
[1:05:17] creation the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] see like I said the the people they'll
[1:05:22] bow to their families family is more
[1:05:24] important than coming to the house of
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:26] or yeah here's another one uh they bow
[1:05:28] to uh they bow to oh we're too tired we
[1:05:31] can't drive to the this message church
[1:05:33] is too far away and then they'll go to
[1:05:35] churches where the women cut their hair
[1:05:36] and wear pads and makeup you know like
[1:05:39] well what's more valuable a little bit
[1:05:41] of sleep or hearing the truth and being
[1:05:43] around Saints of like Precious faith
[1:05:45] because you know if they compromise on
[1:05:47] makeup hair and pants they're going to
[1:05:49] let all these other things in
[1:05:50] you know
[1:05:52] don't you know
[1:05:53] you should know the parable a little
[1:05:55] eleven eleven's a whole lot
[1:05:58] praise God
[1:06:03] now let's go to our text here second
[1:06:05] chronicles 13 18. second chronicles 13
[1:06:08] 18.
[1:06:20] now what I love about the Kings I've
[1:06:22] always loved about the Kings
[1:06:23] is that God gives us a basic overview of
[1:06:26] their lives
[1:06:28] right he kind of gives us a summary of
[1:06:29] their lives like David he did all that
[1:06:32] God wanted to except in the case of
[1:06:33] Uriah
[1:06:35] and Saul Saul served God at the
[1:06:37] beginning to end but he really wasted
[1:06:39] the middle of his life and then God had
[1:06:41] to take him off the earth I just love
[1:06:42] the the summaries of that because God
[1:06:44] God's Gonna summarize summarize our
[1:06:46] lives one way or another it's either
[1:06:48] going to be well done good and faithful
[1:06:49] servant or something else let's make
[1:06:52] sure it's well done good in Fable
[1:06:53] serving amen
[1:06:55] like remember brother Simon said on
[1:06:57] Wednesday some people can see the truth
[1:06:59] some people can't
[1:07:00] and he said why is it because God loves
[1:07:02] us more why does God love us more
[1:07:04] because we love God more
[1:07:08] does the Bible say the Bible says
[1:07:11] to whom God I'm sorry to uh to whoever
[1:07:14] God whoever is forward to God God is
[1:07:17] forward to them
[1:07:20] whoever loves God God will love them
[1:07:23] so by four Nows God knew you'd love him
[1:07:25] more brother Austin that's why he called
[1:07:27] you and Lena beloved Hallelujah
[1:07:32] see ya
[1:07:33] all right they help me in Beatrice we
[1:07:35] can say it about everybody
[1:07:37] God loves you more because he knew you'd
[1:07:39] love him more praise God
[1:07:41] because God is going to give you the
[1:07:43] desire of your heart in other words if
[1:07:45] you want to be a wise virgin God will
[1:07:46] let you have it
[1:07:48] if you want to be a foolish version God
[1:07:49] will let you have that
[1:07:51] like I told that sister from the former
[1:07:54] Amish church I said she said well God
[1:07:56] let the Rapture go if I want to go in it
[1:07:58] I said absolutely not because you're a
[1:08:00] part of the Rapture the very fact you
[1:08:02] want to go in the Rapture shows you're
[1:08:04] going to be in it praise God
[1:08:05] is that right
[1:08:07] if you want to be in it if you want to
[1:08:09] be in the ark don't you think God would
[1:08:10] leave the dark door open until you got
[1:08:12] in
[1:08:13] don't you think
[1:08:15] of course God knew he knew and no one
[1:08:18] else would want to get in and then he
[1:08:19] closed the door
[1:08:21] but all those that want to get in the
[1:08:23] ark got in the ark all those that went
[1:08:25] the Holy Ghost will get it praise God
[1:08:26] all those who want to go on the Rapture
[1:08:28] will get it thank God Hallelujah God's
[1:08:30] got a white robe for you and I
[1:08:31] Hallelujah if we want it God has a white
[1:08:34] robe for us
[1:08:36] Hallelujah
[1:08:40] Glory
[1:08:42] second chronicles 13.
[1:08:44] now we read 18 for our text
[1:08:51] now I want to read verse one though
[1:08:52] second chronicles 13 1.
[1:08:59] now in the 18th year of King jeroboam
[1:09:01] again abide you to Reign Over Judah and
[1:09:03] he reigned three years in Jerusalem his
[1:09:05] mother's name was also
[1:09:06] machaya the daughter of Uriah of gibia
[1:09:09] and there was war between abijah and
[1:09:11] jeroboam
[1:09:12] and if I just set the battle in a raid
[1:09:14] with an army of valiant Men of War even
[1:09:16] 400 000 chosen men jeroboam also said
[1:09:22] 800
[1:09:24] 000 chosen men
[1:09:25] did you catch that abijah has half the
[1:09:28] number of soldiers as jeroboam
[1:09:33] Hallelujah
[1:09:34] anybody ever feel like you're surrounded
[1:09:36] by the enemy and there's more of them
[1:09:38] that's with us it seems like but we know
[1:09:41] the scripture amen
[1:09:43] there's more with us than With the Enemy
[1:09:46] praise God because God fights for us
[1:09:48] praise God
[1:09:50] brother Chris
[1:09:53] Jericho
[1:09:55] yes everyone's enemy in this one yes
[1:09:56] brother good so the enemies got Jerome
[1:09:59] was one that said those two golden
[1:10:00] calves so instead he let the people
[1:10:02] worship idols instead of going down and
[1:10:04] worshiping the true God in Jerusalem
[1:10:06] good yes
[1:10:09] so he got four
[1:10:10] he's got 400 000 abides a good guy
[1:10:13] against 800 000 double with the bad guy
[1:10:16] jeroboam
[1:10:18] now when he's surrounded let's look at
[1:10:20] jeroboam's prayer
[1:10:26] look at verse 8. and now you think to
[1:10:28] withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the
[1:10:30] hand of the sons of David and he'd be a
[1:10:32] great multitude and there with you
[1:10:33] golden calves which jeroboam made you
[1:10:36] for Gods so jeroboam I'm sorry abides is
[1:10:39] crying out to God and church look what
[1:10:41] he prays
[1:10:45] when he prays he gives the exact details
[1:10:49] that the other sins that the enemies did
[1:10:52] and then I love it he gives the exact
[1:10:54] details of how he's walking with God
[1:10:57] in other words he points out how the
[1:10:59] enemy has done Wicked but he points out
[1:11:01] to God he said God in other words
[1:11:02] remember all the obedience I've given to
[1:11:05] you
[1:11:08] is there anything wrong with that I
[1:11:09] don't think so God honored it
[1:11:12] Hallelujah
[1:11:14] did it Hezekiah do that remember when
[1:11:16] Hezekiah got sick what'd he do Isaiah
[1:11:18] said thus saith the Lord set your house
[1:11:19] in order you'll die what do you do
[1:11:21] brother bang Hezekiah threw herself to
[1:11:23] the wall and said God remember me I've
[1:11:25] served you with a pure heart all these
[1:11:27] years what am I telling you when you're
[1:11:30] in trouble call on God and bring to

[1:11:34] forget but it helps you bring to God
[1:11:36] remembrance of all that you've done for
[1:11:38] him praise God

[1:12:56] out the priests of the Lord now look he
[1:12:58] goes into more sins that jeroboam did
[1:12:59] first he built the calves
[1:13:01] and then they cast out the priests of
[1:13:03] the Lord the sons of Aaron Levites in a
[1:13:05] made you priest after the manner of
[1:13:06] nations of the other lands you got
[1:13:09] denominational preachers in other words

[1:18:01] like I love that song I believe that

[1:18:22] how could I ever walk away
[1:18:24] from the one who forgave me of all my

[1:18:43] Christ has forgiven all my sins amen and
[1:18:45] church you and I can say the same thing

[1:18:52] that's why when we call on god let's be
[1:18:54] specific in our prayers let's remind god
[1:18:56] of the evils of the other side and let's
[1:18:58] remind God of all that we've tried to do
[1:19:04] oh

[1:19:10] let's all say Jesus can we say Jesus
[1:19:12] Jesus Jesus Is My Captain

[1:19:16] I'm gonna fail but no God I've been
[1:19:18] faithful
[1:19:19] the best I can I prayed I fasted
[1:19:22] I've gone to church I've said amen I pay
[1:19:24] my tithes come on church I pay my
[1:19:26] offerings
[1:19:28] you got reasons to believe he'll fight
[1:19:31] for you praise God
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:36] the thing we do is we've got to cry out
[1:19:37] to God
[1:19:39] and you'll see what this is all about
[1:19:41] this is why I put the sermon title Kings
[1:19:44] must rely
[1:19:45] on the Lord
[1:19:55] he says let's finish verse 12 there can
[1:19:57] you pull up 12. second chronicles 13 12
[1:19:59] maybe hold God himself is with us for
[1:20:01] our captain and his priest was sounding
[1:20:04] trumpets to cry alarm against you oh
[1:20:06] children of Israel fight ye not against
[1:20:08] the Lord God of your fathers for he
[1:20:10] shall not prosper
[1:20:12] he said this is not right this is my own
[1:20:14] Brethren coming down against me this is
[1:20:16] not right
[1:20:17] but jeroboam calls an ambushment to come
[1:20:20] about behind them so that they were
[1:20:23] before Judah and the ambushment was
[1:20:25] behind them so the real the one who's
[1:20:27] innocent is surrounded before and behind
[1:20:30] he's just surrounded by enemies there's
[1:20:31] no way out but there is a way out
[1:20:34] the devil wants to make him think
[1:20:35] there's no way out but God always has a
[1:20:37] way out praise God hallelujah there's
[1:20:40] always a way out
[1:20:42] verse 14 I want you to look back behold
[1:20:45] the battle was before and behind and
[1:20:46] they cried now what'd they do
[1:20:48] they Cried unto God they started praying
[1:20:52] they started seeking God
[1:20:55] Hallelujah they're surrounded they only
[1:20:57] have half the number of soldiers
[1:21:01] they're surrounded before behind
[1:21:03] everywhere is trouble but they don't
[1:21:05] have to be that way praise God
[1:21:06] hallelujah it might look like I'm
[1:21:08] surrounded but I'm surrounded by Angels
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:12] I'm surrounded by Angel armies Glory we
[1:21:15] looked at that a few weeks ago
[1:21:18] then the men of Judah gave a whisper
[1:21:22] gave a shout
[1:21:24] and as a man of Judah shouted and came
[1:21:26] to pass that God smoked jeroboam and all
[1:21:29] Israel before abijah and Judah just like
[1:21:32] just like Joshua
[1:21:34] you want the victory cry out to God and
[1:21:37] Shout some praise
[1:21:39] Hallelujah that's what I did this week I
[1:21:42] went there and prayed to God to come to
[1:21:44] church I shouted the praise of God Amen
[1:21:47] in other words forget about your
[1:21:48] problems worship God trust in God make
[1:21:51] your requests on unto God and let God
[1:21:53] fight your battles Hallelujah
[1:21:55] hey man
[1:22:00] I don't know how he does it but like we
[1:22:01] sang he'll do it again praise God
[1:22:04] I don't know how he does it but I'm glad
[1:22:06] he does it brother bang Hallelujah
[1:22:09] he's looking at our hearts are we
[1:22:11] serving God with the perfect heart
[1:22:14] and all that means is you confess your
[1:22:16] sins
[1:22:16] daily get Victory and you start getting
[1:22:19] more good days rather than bad days
[1:22:22] Hallelujah
[1:22:25] I'll say that again you start getting
[1:22:26] more good days than bad days Glory
[1:22:31] you got lots more good days
[1:22:34] and they just keep getting gooder right
[1:22:35] Lydia
[1:22:37] gooder's not a word to her
[1:22:40] they keep getting gooder all the time my
[1:22:42] brother Brooks used to say that
[1:22:44] Glory they do Church
[1:22:47] so you keep walking the victory of God
[1:22:50] so how does it end
[1:22:52] God smoked jeroboam and these they look
[1:22:55] at listeners how many of the 800 000
[1:22:57] died
[1:22:58] and the children of Israel fled before
[1:23:00] Judah and God delivered them into their
[1:23:01] hand in verse 17 and abiding his people
[1:23:03] slew them with a great Slaughter so
[1:23:05] they're fell down the slain of Israel
[1:23:06] 500 000 chosen men
[1:23:10] so 500 000 out of the 800 000 died
[1:23:14] because they were idolaters
[1:23:18] that's a lot of people that's a lot of
[1:23:20] carcasses
[1:23:23] how did abide to get the victory
[1:23:26] prayed
[1:23:27] the people cried out to God
[1:23:30] and they they reminded the Lord here's
[1:23:31] all the evils that they've done here's
[1:23:33] all the good that I've done
[1:23:35] and the church said
[1:23:37] you need to remind God Church it'll be
[1:23:38] encouragement to you remind God I remind
[1:23:40] God lord I preach this message
[1:23:43] 19 years I remind God of that
[1:23:46] right
[1:23:47] I've been faithful
[1:23:49] how many of you see me skip church and
[1:23:51] lay at home when I should be at church
[1:23:52] who sees me do that
[1:23:54] who sees me complain when I gotta preach
[1:23:56] and song Lead and teach and do
[1:23:58] everything like that whoever sees me
[1:23:59] complain I don't complain because it's a
[1:24:01] joy to serve God
[1:24:03] I know that it's a joy to serve God why
[1:24:07] because I've served the devil I know
[1:24:08] what that's like it's a joy to serve
[1:24:10] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I feel like
[1:24:13] dancing praise God Amen Hallelujah I
[1:24:15] dance for the devil but now I dance for
[1:24:17] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:24:19] and I'm free indeed brother bang I'm
[1:24:21] free indeed Hallelujah
[1:24:25] Glory
[1:24:30] so 500 out of the 800 000 are slain
[1:24:35] Verse 18 was our text thus the children
[1:24:37] of Israel were brought under at that
[1:24:39] time and the children of Judah prevailed
[1:24:41] because they relied upon the Lord God
[1:24:44] of their fathers
[1:24:46] I better stop there I'm almost getting
[1:24:48] towards two hours here so by the time we
[1:24:50] sing Everything it might be two hours
[1:24:53] now I'm not going to go there but
[1:24:55] the reason I said rely that word rely
[1:25:00] is because a couple Kings later Asa has
[1:25:03] a great walk with God but then he makes
[1:25:04] a mistake and when he has a battle he
[1:25:07] relies upon the king of Syria rather
[1:25:10] than God and he loses the battle
[1:25:13] in other words he put his confidence in
[1:25:17] a man rather than God
[1:25:20] how many want to put their confidence in
[1:25:22] God today
[1:25:23] let's send our feet musicians can come
[1:25:25] in case you put up Hebrews 10 35.
[1:25:29] I think sister Nomi used this in her
[1:25:31] testimony I'm not sure sister but I
[1:25:33] think that you're a third part of your
[1:25:34] testimony I don't know
[1:25:36] and we'll have to look back on the
[1:25:37] podcast
[1:25:41] the Bible said cast not away therefore
[1:25:45] your what Your Reliance on God
[1:25:49] you can't rely on anything else but God
[1:25:52] praise the Lord
[1:25:54] we have to have full trust full
[1:25:57] confidence in Jesus Christ how many want
[1:25:58] to have confidence in Christ
[1:26:01] you can see two kings I didn't read the
[1:26:03] ace one maybe I'll preach that or maybe
[1:26:04] teach that in the Bible say this is
[1:26:05] evening
[1:26:06] but we did preach on abijah
[1:26:09] abijah reminded god of the evils of the
[1:26:12] other side he reminded God of his
[1:26:14] faithfulness and then he shouted prayed
[1:26:16] cried out to God God delivered him
[1:26:20] just like Hezekiah remember God I have
[1:26:22] served you with a perfect heart amen
[1:26:26] although all that means is I was tempted
[1:26:29] to go back to the world but I refused
[1:26:32] I'm serving Jesus Christ
[1:26:35] Church
[1:26:36] by God's grace we serve him with the
[1:26:38] perfect heart
[1:26:39] we confess all of our faults and
[1:26:41] remember if you confess all your sins
[1:26:43] right now you are forgiven right now
[1:26:46] of everything
[1:26:48] if you've confessed it now but sometimes
[1:26:51] God wants to see us with a broken spirit
[1:26:54] that means we really feel sorry for our
[1:26:56] sins when we're broken before God
[1:26:59] how many believe that
[1:27:01] let's bow our heads here
[1:27:04] Kings must rely
[1:27:07] on the Lord
[1:27:15] Heavenly Father Lord we're just happy to
[1:27:17] be in your house today
[1:27:19] thank you for a man like abijah I know
[1:27:21] he wasn't a perfect King
[1:27:23] Lord one lesson it gives us
[1:27:26] reminds me of Hezekiah Lord God
[1:27:30] when we go through battles Lord God
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] and we seem overwhelmed there is a way
[1:27:37] out
