Lord for another opportunity to be here tonight Lord in your house Lord as we tell the story get another part of this grand wonderful story Lord Cohn we're privileged people Lord to be able to know this story here over and over again Lord and Lord we know as your prophet said it keeps unfolding more and more keeps being revealed to us Lord we learn to appreciate it more we learn to love it more God take tonight Lord that's this reading of that word Lord and tonight break it to our hearts Lord speak to us in a special way we presented ourselves before you Lord meekly humbly we've come before you with prayers repentance worship Lord psalms to express our love for you Heavenly Father the Lord break this word to us help us to grow in grace and knowledge of you here tonight floor knowledge is the key that opens the door Lord in many cases to freedom to victory to obedience to joy to all the fruits of the Holy Spirit thank you Lord bless this word as we read it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saint said amen god bless you let's take our Bibles let's go to proverbs chapter 1 verse 9 like to preach on part 5 of the modesty series tonight by the grace of the Lord robbers chapter 1 verse 9 proverbs chapter 1 verse 9 let's actually read verse 7 8 and 9 because it's in the context to understand verse 9 verse 7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction my son here the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck those look at modesty tonight I wanted to show the natural accessories and natural jewelry many times are symbols of spiritual blessings so may God has blessing the reading of his word you may be seated god bless you so Malachi whenever you ready you can switch over here I just have a few slides here and we're going through a lot of Scripture here tonight Lord willing by the grace of the Lord I'll just update you I'm on chapter 6 I'm almost done I have 29 thousand words so I'm up to quite a few words there and then I got two more chapters to go after this but making good progress this week I spent most of my time as you'll see down here at the bottom see how these pictures down here this week I spent most of my time will show these at the end I spent most of my time researching all the articles encyclopedia Britannica's almanacs and then the Bible all the all the proof we have about the downward fall of modesty in America I just kind of that's what chapter 6 is all about so chapter 6 is called connecting Bible history with the history of fashion so I spent most of my week looking at that and I read most of that book you gave me Connie so thank you about sixty pages into that by the grace of Lord I think it's got a couple more chapters that's been a real helpful book it's been nice to see just some different thoughts and different perspectives on this topic okay so let's get started here tonight by God's grace this is part five here's my outline for tonight I don't know I want to get here but we're going to start with all the scriptures not all the scriptures but the main ones on earrings necklaces tattoos bracelets and then I want to move on this thought this is a thought I got from the book that kind of gave me point mints verses makeup I kind of want to show the scriptures on that and then if I have time I want to show the clothing standards that have fell by decade remember we already taught on the swim some swimwear fashions that fell by decade but I like I said spent this week going through all the references and the books that we have on these things and I think that's going to be a blessing to you so remember again these are all the these are guidelines have all fallen they've all fallen over the course the last 150 years these four Bible guidelines covering all areas of nakedness wearing a thick layer of clothing or multiple layers of thinner clothing in other words not see-through kind of transparent clothing gender-specific clothing and then long loose flowing clothing like Jesus and all the saints aware in heaven for all eternity all right so let's start with earrings if you got your Bible let's let's go should I start with neck assistance we just read our text on that so okay I hope everybody can see that necklaces are here are a sign of a spiritual sign of being adorned being made beautiful all right now in our church I don't really I don't really think it's very manly for a man to wear necklaces but if a man wants to you know there's scripture where he could we'll look at that tonight but with sisters brother branham's you know we read the quote this summer last summer where brother Adam said if you got a necklace your husband gave you or necklace that means something to you he said I think that's fine to wear he said just examine the reason why you're wearing it so you have to know your your motive and objective behind wearing something so let's look at these necklaces that were worn now the wisdom of your the parents your teaching of your parents is like a necklace around your neck it adorns you it it shows that you have wisdom when you obey the the teaching of your mother and father it's like a spiritual anointing of the fear of the Lord is on you people can see the wisdom of God upon you so that's what a necklace represents to the spiritual so just to show you natural necklaces let's go to Genesis 41 42 and you can see this by the grace of Lord and who like to read that what anyone have that for me now I like to read that okay when you're ready buddy okay so Joseph as soon as he interprets Pharaoh's dream he gets a ring which we showed was like the signature like a stamp a signet ring to give the approval kind of power and authority and then a necklace some type of necklace I don't know what that means I don't I don't know the the meaning behind the necklace but if God let Joseph wear it who was a type of Christ then we can say that just a man wearing a necklace wouldn't be necessarily a wrong thing it depends why he's wearing it all right let's go to Song of Solomon chapter 1 solomon's bride wore necklace Song of Solomon 1 verse 10 we would like to read that for me tonight Lydia thank you okay so here chains of gulp now if you look at verse a if thou know'st not oh thou fairest among women go thy way forth by that I footsteps of the flock and feed that kids beside the Shepherd's tents I've compared the oh my love to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots okay now I believe that's speaking of the woman I believe I'm sorry I didn't look too soon I'm gonna okay well no I think that Psalm because look at verse one this is the woman talking I am blackbuck calmly so that would be the woman okay so that was Solomon then so I'm sorry Solomon looks like he has chains of gold on part of me mix that one up forgive me okay let's go to Genesis back to Genesis 24 22 now here we see Rebecca getting jewelry at her engagement to Isaac by Abraham's messenger faithful messenger Eliezer Genesis 24 22 and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets from her hands of ten shekels weight of gold okay this is bracelets okay yeah here's bracelets alright now this is a striking one go to Ezekiel 16 of all the times God talks about jewelry in the Bible this is one of the most striking to me right here Ezekiel 16 but I believe you'll see a principle as we read this there seems to be some type of connection between women being adorned either at their engagement or at their wedding day there seems to be some kind of connection where God God loves when a woman is presented as beautifully as she can to her husband there seems to be some connection between jewelry and a new bride or something along those lines or engagement of a bride there is some type of Bible connection because we see it with Rebecca and then we see it right here with God's bride Israel and then we see it at the rapture because remember Jesus is bride she's without spot or blemish amen she's adorned she's totally washed in the blood of Jesus amen no spot no wrinkle he meant glory Ezekiel 16 now and you look at verse 2 son of man calls Jerusalem to know her abominations and say thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem thy birth and I night Nativity is of the land of Canaan my father was an am right and thy mother and hittite and as for that night Nativity in the day thou was born thy navel was not cut that's their umbilical cord remember that name Alma represents the umbilical cord neither was that washed in water too supple thee thou was not salted at all nor swaddled at all so this is a baby that's fresh born not taken care of none I pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou was cast out in the open field to the loathing of that person in the day that thou was born can you imagine a baby being treated like this this is how God saw Israel and when I pass by the and saw the polluted in thine own blood I said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live yay I sent unto thee when I was in thy blood live aren't you glad God found you God won't let you die he said live brother Adam amen live he you're dead in your sins and trespasses like Ephesians 2 said but then he quickened you by his word amen beautiful passage here just amazing verse 7 I have caused the to multiply as the butt of the field and that was increase in waxing great and now are come to excellent ornaments thy breasts or fashions and nine hairs grown whereas thou was naked and bare now when I pass by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was come of love try the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yay I swear into thee and entered into covenant with thee saith the Lord and thou became as - now she's old enough to marry and God says I've espoused you you're mine then washed IV with water yay I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil i clothed thee also with broidered work and shoddy with badger skin and I gird the about with fine linen and I cover thee with silk I decked thee also with ornaments see that day see the connection he's getting engaged he's gonna get married so he gives the bride all these ornaments because she's a mare marriageable age and I put bracelets upon thy hands there's bracelets right we talked about bracelets and a chain on thy neck there's the chains there's necklace and I put a jewel on their forehead now I'm not even I don't even have any scholar scripture for that I don't even go there cuz I think I don't can't even understand it and earrings in nine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head remember this is all spiritual speaking that was I'm sorry this was now decked with gold and silver and thy arraignment was a fine linen of silk and embroidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou was exceeding beautiful and that is prosper until Kingdom does God like a woman that looks pretty you better believe it but Rahab said it's in a woman to want to be pretty he said there's nothing wrong with a woman who wants to be pretty because she wants to be pretty to be a blessing to her husband right and then case she wants to be a blessing to God now of course we know this context she fell away from her love for God just like Israel after they came in the promised land after Joshua died the judges came they fell away they fell out of love with God now look at 14 and Irene and it was perfect through my calm leanness which I put on these saith the Lord God so who put all these ornaments on the woman God did God made her look extra special God made her look extra beautiful but thou distrust in thine own beauty Oh here's where the trouble comes that's my brother may have said yeah you can wear jewelry but just make sure doesn't become a source of pride and plays the harlot because of thy renown and poured out my foreign occasions on every one that passed by his it was can you imagine every men that came by God did all this can you imagine God picking up the baby whose umbilical cord I don't know how that even would work how the umbilical cords not cut cut the umbilical cord train the baby up raise the baby up it'd be a spouse to the baby and then instead of that woman being in love with God she wants every other man but God and that's how the church is right they want every other blessing except the real Word of God they don't want the preowned preaching of the word of God they'll take every other every other doctrine every other thing out there every other thing that shines they'll take everything else except the true Word of God look at verse 17 thou has also taking their jewels of my golden on my silver which I have given thee and maids to thyself images of men and dis commit whoredom with them and took us that boy to garments and covers them and now has set my oil in mine incense before them okay now I'm gonna stop right there I think we can see the picture there so see this is the great balance God Himself talks about adorning his wife in a certain way Rebecca gets adorned a certain way but then remember there's balance to all these things now I'm just gonna kind of preach on earrings this wind I'm sorry this last summer so I'm not gonna spend much time on earrings but let's go to Genesis 35 verse 4 one generation after Rebecca her generation was Isaac and Rebecca one generation after them Isaac was Jacob right Jake was the next generation well after Jacob come down we know he went down to see Laban he came back with his children and he was going to go up to Bethel right but before I could go up to the house of God Jacob said we're gonna clean ourselves out and we're gonna bury everything under this oak tree which was a type of the tree the tree of Christ the cross so Genesis 35 verse 4 and this is where the balance is genesis 35 4 and they gave Jakub all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earring earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by she chim okay so see the balance the previous generation was given all these they must have been passed down to the family but what before Jacob goes up to God's house he's returning to the promised land he's returning to his homeland praise God he's returning to serve God he left he was he ran out of fear he's coming back to his land of possession he's coming back to his promised land and so he buries all these earrings he buries all the strange God's he buries everything that's a hindrance to his family he buries it under the tree and says now I'm ready to serve the Lord so see there's the balance if jewelry and things don't don't cause you to stumble praise the Lord but see when a man gets this like this he wants to rededicate his life if there's any question about anything he's willing to bury it at the cross praise the Lord leave it there at the cross I'll leave it there at the altar I'll get rid of it when I go home after church I'm willing to start afresh I don't want anything that would even tempt me to wanna fall away from the Lord all right hope you can see that by the grace of God remember Rebekah was giving earrings in Genesis 24 22 are not going to go there did you know Joe was given earrings after he was restored he was giving earrings in job 42 11 let's read that Joe 42 11 now again this is where this thought beat might be and this is what I think I've been put in the book to jewelry might have just been a form of currency because they didn't have paper money back then no no we know they had coins but they had bartering if there was no coins or paper they didn't have that ability they would barter they would trade so it may be that job 42:11 job 42 11 then came to him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that have been in his acquaintances before and it eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold so again there you have a balance I don't know piece of money earring of gold like I said it might have been just the gold for his a family that would come after because we know after this he had sons and daughters I don't know if you knew this we go down to verse 14 and he called the name of the first Jemima and the name of the second keziah and the name of the third Caron topic now who knows what Karen topic means anyone know it means a facial cosmetic and so this it literally means that in a couple of dictionaries one dictionary doesn't so you have like two that says I have three dictionaries Easton's Bible Hebrew lexicon and then Smith's Bible dictionary two of them say that this name means a facial cosmetic which also could mean a facial meant it could mean that but one of them says it means something else so this is what some of the people on YouTube and Facebook have not Facebook YouTube have eat and emailed me about saying OC joke stars for makeup and I say well it doesn't say paint the King James Version for cause facial cosmetic is paint it doesn't say they painted their face so to me it must mean something like maybe just oil you would rub all over your face or something like that much like like a face moisturizer or something like that I don't I don't know but we know there's definite separate words for paint and then point man that's we're gonna look at next but let's I just want to share that with you in case anybody ever says did you know job's daughter met makeup it doesn't mean makeup it means some type of facial cosmetic or appointment or something like that but that's where they get that idea and again remember you never see God's women ever wearing painting their faces you never see that in the scripture now we're not going to turn there but in Exodus 32 when Israel back slid made the the Golden Calf they break off their earrings and gave them to Aaron so remember they were a backslidden people at that point Ishmaelites and judges ate the Ishmaelites were known for wearing earrings and Ishmaelites of course were cursed children they were children of the flesh not children of the promise right so you see that scripture in Hosea 2:13 Hosea God told Hosea your your wife was just like Israel she went and played the harlot and she put on earrings and all these things she made herself adorned herself to attract men so again it all depends on your motive and objective behind wearing it the spirit that's on you when you wear these things Isaiah 3 verse 20 we read that last week that showed how the daughters of Zion they had 21 different assessories hon amongst them and God called them unclean God was gonna make them stink and their hair was going to be plucked out and they were because of their their haughtiness because of their pride God was gonna take away all their supposed beauty that they thought they had now here's the principle with earrings I don't see any scripture where a faithful Hebrew or Christian would ever pierce their ears mark their ears or shed blood because all those things are a form of self-mutilation that's what I can see through the scripture okay so that's what I say that's why you know and I said this summer you know I said if somebody walked in here with a clip on earring well I really couldn't say much about it other than I have to preach make sure your heart's right with God that's all I could say now am I gonna teach my girls to wear clip-on earrings not a chance because I don't even want to take one step close to them piercing their ears just like I won't let them put on face paint like when we go to fairs or things like that I'm not gonna let somebody paint their face up because I don't even want them to get one step close to that all right and I and I just believe it's it's safer to stay away from those things and keep yourself unspotted from the world but I would if somebody walked in there like that you know they asked me about it I would say yeah check your check your motive and your objective just like with fingernail polish to me I believe fingernail polish is wrong if it's colorful if it's plain I don't have another I don't have anything against that because it doesn't distract but if it's polished and and painting up well there now you're getting into paint you know no I just want to stay away from paints a man I just don't think I just don't think that's right because who are you trying to press with different colored paint paints on your finger knows what what what practical purpose does that have it's just one step closer to compromise so that's why I don't let my family I just don't see how it glorifies the Lord and again you might go and pay what $50 to get your nails done I don't know sisters I don't know how much it costs I I'm just throwing a number out there but they'll spend $50 here now how much of offering did you give that month did you give $50 of offering and it's gonna chip off and all the all these things and they put these fake nails on there now that's that how can that be right - then you can't work like a woman's hands off to work right a woman's hands were made to work in the home and all I can't wash the dishes because I got these long nails on I thought you're supposed to guide the home you were made to your sensitive touch your feminine touch needs to be seen at the home you got to do the feminine jobs the jobs God has built you for so see I just I think it's better just to stay away from all that and direct my family the right way as well like I said the fake tattoos and the face painting anything fake even the sticker tattoos you know where they're just like real small square stickers I just would rather not do any that I just rather stay away from that I'd rather say instead of putting that on put the joy of the Lord on because that will impress people why should they press but that will speak to people more than anything that's just uh gnats unnatural anything man-made put something holy on let that let that get people's attention the fact that you're holy the fact that you're you're loving or or you love the Lord or you have the joy of the Lord you got a song of the Lord on your heart let that attract people's attention and not the things of the world okay so that was earrings I think we're pretty good on earrings I think you understand that principle that the all's does anyone want anyone need those scriptures then anyone need to write it down and then we write down any scriptures okay let's do two out any 1517 and then Exodus 21 six talk about the all's okay just in case you need those I know even last week somebody text me right afterwards when I preached on Christian Liberty you remember that sermon last week and they said that was a great balance of the scripture brother Jesse I really appreciate you doing that so somebody really was caring about the Scriptures so that's why I just want to say that okay let's go back there tattoos most of us know tattoos that just read out one scripture just so you have it Leviticus 19:28 let's go there too just so we know it again marking for the dead now the sad thing is I appreciate cams couple of years ago and my brother one of my brothers came to visit one who doesn't follow the message and brother Simon after I preached about Simon said that was the most brave sermon he ever heard because I just tore into makeup and tattoos and pants on women I just told you children remember that service when we had okay and I didn't I guess I didn't really feel I was just felt led of the Lord you know I think the sermon was called the few who are truly born again I think that's was the name of the sermon well anyways during the sermon I just felt led to preach on tattoos it wasn't even in my notes but afterwards my brother had a tattoos the one who doesn't bless you the one who doesn't go to the message church and he said his little boys heard me preaching that and he went and he said the little boys went up to the dad after the service said dad you got a tattoo that's wrong and my brother texted me and said thank you for preaching that he said because I knew it was wrong and he got a tattoo to honor one of his friends who died young he got a tattoo to honor the dead that's what the Bible said you don't make a marks to honor the dead which was strike is interesting you know interesting but even that and I wasn't trying to preach on my brother I haven't forgot he had a tattoo I could remember that was years ago but it was just encouraging when you preach God's Word it will discern people's hearts it'll show what's really in their heart and I thought that was beautiful that these little children even little boys you know 2nd 3rd 4th grade he can hear God's Word and believe it and then encourage their parents not to disobey God's Word I know that's beautiful the biggest 1928 okay here's this you shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you I'm the Lord so there's two two restrictions not for the dead nor any other marks see God doesn't want those on you why because you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you're not see that just draws attention in the flesh how many brothers know that that was the temptation all you got big muscles you should put a big barb that's that was the temptation when I was growing up the barbed wire one of the football players at Ohio State started the barbed wire and so every Friday when we had games we would draw a barbed wire on our arms to try to make ourselves feel like we're somebody special what does it do it exalts the flesh but no flesh will glory in God's presence none of that will glory in God's presence a member bales profits cut themselves they mark themselves first Kings 18 the maniac of Gadara cut himself with stones mark 5 2 through 5 ok think I'm done with that okay now augments now this will be brand new I don't think I've ever preached one service on aunt mins before this will be brand new for us here by the grace of the Lord so let me pull this up I have my notes on both of these devices let me pull this up real quick so I can get right to the scripture and we'll go to that ok the first one will be proverbs 27 9 let's go to proverbs 27 9 now as your they're anointment is a South or unjú int I'm not probably probably not saying that right my wife will correct me when I get home unguent a salvo run went for application of the skin and a Sal vis a fatty or oily substance smooth and greasy and texture or appearance I think we all know what a Sal vis like lip balm and something like that an ointment now here's the point I'm trying to make paint was the King King James way to describe facial cosmetics or makeup not aunt Minh Point mint was always for the skin and for the body paint was the word used for face painting the face like I said with job's daughter there might have been some ointment you rubbed on your face there might have been but let's read this proverbs 27 9-point Minh and perfume rejoiced the heart sewed up the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel so these have the same effects a friendly friend a friend that makes you happy it's the same effect that same effect it has on you is the same effect in the Bible days that perfume and oilmen would have upon a dirty person right clean yourself up make yourself feel fresh and clean like for us it like we feel after taking a shower in our day that's kind of what it'd be like but they didn't have access to showers all the time so we know they had to do that so the same effect a shower has for us or you know putting the lotion on or whatever you do I don't know sisters what you did your minds can get so dry in the winter I have to put coconut oil over my head because it just it's flaky white because it's so dry my hands get flaky white because it's so dry so I guess I do a little bit of ointment but not too much I've had sisters more do that but the point is pointman is not the same as painting the face the next one I like this one Solomon was decked anointment too he was he had rubbed upon him Song of Solomon won three Song of Solomon won three now it either seems like Solomon had him on him which we would imagine the kings and royal people would have their bodies clean I believe they would do that but here it compares it to his name so the clean body is likened to a good name Song of Solomon 1 verse 3 because of the savour of thy good aunt 'men same is as ointment poured forth there for do the Virgin's love thee so because Solomon was clean he was a nice-looking King you know he was adorned very well his name because he was anointed his name was as augment poured forth so a sweet smell like a perfume or a sweet smell in a room and therefore the Virgin's love him so see there's in those days there was so valuable have fragrances now those are natural fragrances now my wife tells me honey no the perfumes and stuff like that today they got bad chemicals some of them do so you got to be careful what perfumes you wear I'm gonna have some you know manmade chemicals that are not very healthy so you want to be careful you know the perfumes that you wear for your health as well okay so there's Solomon with joint mints okay the next one let's go to Solomon for tennis I was reading a little text there I don't know if I should read it or not so I'm Solomon 410 now here is where smell the power of smell or fragrance is linked to aunt mints and that's why pointman is not even used for facial pain or makeup because the smell of ointment was what was most important the smell of it and the cleanliness that it brought and so makeup sisters does makeup have any smells it's supposed to make you smell good makeup oh they can't have makeup that make you smell good I didn't know that I didn't think they would I guess they pull out all the stops now but in the scripture I can't find anything where the makeup would make them smell better because the Bible said don't let the harlot take take you with her eyes so we know there was something seductive about the eyes but like rubberband talks about they make their eyes look like cats you know they they try to make them look animalistic which applies which applies to the beastly sensual nature of humans right that don't have the Holy Ghost they feed off the sensual temptations or the beastly temptation so there you go for that Song of Solomon 410 how fair is that I love my sister my spouse how much better is thy love than line and the smell of thine ointments than all spices so it's the smell it's the fragrance of the ointments they would rub upon themselves now next we'll just read it but I'll just say it in Ruth 3 verse 3 Naomi told Ruth and if you want to if you want Boaz to accept you as a wife you've got to go wash yourself and anoint yourself I remember that so she had to be anointed she had to put ointment on should to make herself presentable Jesus when he went to the Simon's room Oh No yeah when wet in Simon's house he said my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment there's the perfume the ointment perfume so this says olive oil went on the heads when you clean your face Olive Oyl went on your head hair everything like that olive oil like we got right here olive oil the only mint though in this case went on Jesus's feet and Jesus said as far as your physical appearance when you fast anoint thine head and wash 9 face so there's another use of olive oil on the head alright let's go to Psalms 104 15 Psalms 104 15 malachi can read out when you're ready buddy alright so this is something very important in those days it was important to have oil to make your face shine notice it didn't say paint to make your face shine it didn't say that the bike we always got to look at the context in every scripture there's a total separation between painting and oils or ointments right total separation between those things there's three scriptures on paint always connected to immoral women and seduction and lust and judgments and then the ointments are always spoke of something good something that smells good something that makes you clean something that makes you look happy alright asked her to verse 12 I've had so many people tell me well Esther wore makeup but the Bible never said she wore makeup Esther 2:12 now when every maid Stern was come in to the King Ahasuerus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner the women for so were the days of her purification 'he's accomplished to it six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of women make up is never said to purify anyone right how does makeup purify your body it doesn't in fact there's numerous women that came on my page supporting me saying I used to put on makeup but then I read about all the awful chemicals in it don't purify it tarnishes you it taints your body right so all these things were done to s-sir to purify her not to taint her and it never says she painted her face like Jezebel never says that now Adam Clark the godly preacher of the 1800's said this the most beautiful of all the young virgins of all the province of Babylon were to be selected now notice Esther's going up against the most beautiful the beautiful she's taking on the most beautiful virgins of all Babylon and she won glory amen and these were taken out of all the classes of people indiscriminately consequently there must have been many who were brought up in low life not just rich women for we know that those who feed on core strong food which is not easily digested to have generally a copyist perspiration and that's true too my wife was tell me about certain people certain people can smell people's fragrances and it kind of tells what they've been eating and my wife even read one online in a real article where a person could smell a disease because it was express our body odor I think it was my wife was telling me about last night of all of all times she'd even know was gonna breach this so the king one of the women had to go through six months up here a year of purification so their bodies would smell the right way too because he took poor women rich women get to make sure their diets were changed and make sure the oils and aunt meant that were on their body produced the right kind of fragrance this is striking so see the food you eat causes you to produce a certain kind of smell that's why I was wondering some people smell like McDonald's all the time or Burger King that used to be me by the way not anymore no but it actually makes you yeah if you eat the wrong food it makes you smell bad it makes your body smell bad now says this in many though in very respect amiable and even beautiful this odor is far from being pleasant pure hosts wholesome easily digested and nourishing ailment I'm sorry alignment with the frequent use of a hot bath continued for 12 months the body frequently rubbed with olive oil will in almost every case remove all that is disagreeable this kind this treatment will give a healthy action to all the sub sub contentious vessels I don't know what that means dirty vessels and in every respect promote health and comfort so see she was going to make sure she got a the king was gonna make sure all these women got a bath regularly right and rub all these ornaments on him and oils and make sure she's eating the right kind of foods so her body puts forth a purified smell and this is what the historians say so the Bible never says s or painters her face the bible said she just purified her body just purified it how many people know that when a person came into God's presence the old testament they had to be holy and clean let me know that we don't have time to read all this remember the priests had to wash their hands at the Laver before they entered the holy place the priests were not to sweat in God's presence in Ezekiel 44 that's why they didn't wear wool that wear linen not wool linen Israel how do we know that God told Moses tell them to wash their bodies and wash their clothes so they're clean in three days when I meet them on Mount Sinai I remember that God wanted his people clean when they came into his presence so God loves beauty God loves cleanliness because God knows if you're not clean what's gonna happen you're gonna get diseased you're gonna get infections you're gonna have swellings you're gonna have all kinds of bad things happen to you God loves Beauty now go to Psalms 27 for let's read that Psalms 27 for Libya can you read that when you get at psalms 27 for Amen why did they even would always be in church why did David always want to be near the ark so he could see the glory and the beauty of God amen how did who you see God's presence was a beautiful thing and so God said when you come into my presence I want you to be beautiful too that's why King Ahasuerus right the king said the women got to be purified they got to be beautiful aren't you glad Christ is purifying you praise God amen he gives you a hot bath after a hot bath purification pointment after ointment but it's the eye salve amen it's the white garments he's giving you spiritual beauty amen that's right God loves David love God's beauty we love God's beauty and God makes everything beautiful in his own time the clothes that God designed for the high priests in Exodus 20:8 were designed specifically for glory and beauty amen that's what David said in your presence is glory and beauty so God said I'm gonna dress you in glory beauty so you match my glory beauty amen and we've got the righteousness of Jesus Christ that's what makes us glory and beautiful praise God amen hallelujah so that's the major scriptures I preached or I've seen in verses ointments versus makeup does that help by God's grace I hope that was it help to you in some way shape or form like I said it's gonna be helped if you talk to people because they're gonna always bring up Esther and you can always say well they never said she painted her face she just put mints okay oil salves she just rubbed salves upon her took baths frequently change their diet in order to produce the right kind of cleanliness for the king all right that's most of my scripture now let's start looking at some of Changez here let's start looking at some of the changes and we'll close with this here how am i doing on time well I'm doing real good on time man thank the Lord okay I think yeah this was good okay okay so 1800s how many know who that is even know who that is Amelia bloomer Amelia bloomer and she is known for creating the bloomers bloomers were pants that the woman would wear under the skirts on this is a real short skirt but these are the bloomers in this case the bloomers yeah would be these pants underneath this now this is out in California when bloomers first struck guess where they were popular first out west there's something about out west where it's really awful you know all the evil things happen out west they come East but let me go back to that picture her bloomers haven't even longer skirts okay now this happened around the mid-1800s I'm gonna read the history in just a moment she had pants under there and that that just made every that made most people upset she tried to get a movement started and the movement really didn't go very far like I said it was acceptable in a few cities like Allen California and a few other places but by the end of her life she died and all the people around her had given up the movement too for women to wear bloomers or pants under their skirts because all the preachers were saying it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong and the people still had some sense of holiness which we know they lack today okay now let me read some of the history here as we're looking at some of these pictures I just have those two pictures and what I'll do is I'm gonna read the history I got you know I got numerous historical references for each time period so let me pull these up and I'll try to have pictures like I said for each time period now in the 1800s the only people known for wearing tight form-fitting pants and showed their bloomers was prostitutes and they did it in theaters which were connected to brothel house in other words whorehouses so that's where we have the association there's some association between actresses and prostitution can say amen to that just like today the most famous actresses they're also the ones who sleep with the most people in the movies right who show off their bodies or expose themselves in nude pictures and all new movies and all kinds of things like that that's what they do they're actually literally prostitutes today they're modern-day prostitutes but that's the only place in the 1800s where you would find tight clothes or women showing off their garments under garments that's where you found it in the 1800s Amelia bloomer introduced the bloomers in 1851 most people rejected it because they were preaching Deuteronomy 22:5 and that's literal history I found that in a book by two women who are not Christians they found history that said the preachers preach Deuteronomy 22:5 the woman shall not wear that which a man puts on if a woman was caught wearing pants and places she could be punishable by arrest and imprisonment and fines bloomers were most accepted by prostitutes and women and lesbians this is according to the same woman one place where women could wear pants was in women's universities so in the 1870s women started having their own universities and they were getting so smart now they're educated and they got so smart that they let them cross dress but only to do their theater plays so see this is how this is how they would compromise well these girls they're not actually prostitutes and they wouldn't let any men there so see that we can break God's Word as long as they're not physically committing adultery or whoredom and then no men see it but that's wrong if you're only given two choices to break the word a little bit or a lot Charles Spurgeon said do neither if you've only got two choices we'll break this or break that he said do none of them amen and so see this is what they see see anytime people compromise it's going to catch up with them that little seed of unbelief is going to grow if it doesn't get cut out like Jeremiah said God said Jeremiah you've got to uproot that seed you've got to uproot that unbelief and if people let us in hang around it's eventually going to kill them it's exactly right and so see where did this start how to get started publicly with the smart college-educated women see you're get so smart but radical you get so smart you get so far away from God there's nothing wrong with you know I know people in here have college degrees I haven't cause there's nothing wrong with that as long as you filter everything by the Word of God and I'm thankful I never had to take one quiz in my science classes I never had to take one quiz that said I believe in evolutions I never had to compromise on that I'm thankful for that I don't I really don't know anybody who has I don't myself but see a Christian can be faithful like I know people that quit college as soon they came in the message and they regretted it later because they had scholarship money but they immediately thought oh it's education God can't be in that well what about Martin Luther what about John Wesley they were very well educated and God they were God's stars for the age that God let them shine because they didn't let the edge exalt themselves in fact they used it to spread the gospel amen that's why I think God allowed me to be a teacher and going to schools and learn how to write a book right because I wrote all those videos of the videos are helping people around the world I basically took all the my education and instruction and made these little videos which are just books on a video and they're helping people today I just I see God's hand in an amen that's where I see so that's where it's starting to get a little bit of momentum for women in pants now with makeup frowned upon oh yeah in the 1800s the only people that wore makeup were prostitutes but the women started wanting to look like them so guess what they did here's what they did to make themselves look like they're wearing makeup they drank vinegar and ate chalk to give them a real pale complexion now you tell me it was a real Christian woman do that I get up in the morning I say my prayers and I eat some chalk to try to make myself look pale can you imagine like what kind of a Christian woman would do that so see these are things that the heathens were doing or we'd say the organized religious the denominational people you can you imagine real Holy Ghost field saying that pray read their Bible and prayed and clap in the church and spoke in tongues and shouted and said a man do you imagine a woman like that with pale face and chok chok coming out of her teeth or something like that can you imagine that you can't because a real Holy Ghost feels Saint today don't care about it either she's not trying to look like the and the prostitutes she's trying to look like Steven who had the face of an angel amen the glory of God on her face yeah by the end of her life bloomer and her colleagues gave up the fight they all quit because their their movement wasn't catching traction it wasn't catching traction they even gave up and you know what caused a lot of people the bicycle cause a lot of women towards the end of the century 1890s the bicycle got so popular and I have in this book this is a book I brought from library one of the chapters is called the devil's devices and it shows how bicycles were a tool a lot of women used to go on sneak off with boyfriends and get pregnant and then also to wear pants and see how the bikes Cove itself is not a bad thing it depends how you use it right but this move got God cut this move short by bringing forth the automobile and then women couldn't drive for a while but anyways it was just showing it was just interesting to see this and everything that came out Satan would use it as a device as a tool all the technology we use it tool but then God's people would always use it the right way education bikes for the gospel right cars planes to preach right Internet to take the gospel everywhere amen all right now let's get back let's go past there now I think I got most of the those are the main points for the 1800s okay now the 1910s women would not be caught dead wearing pants and plug public that's what this reference says by 1915 skirts had shortened to the ankle so skirts were down to the ground by 1915 they came up about four inches see little by little Satan moves it up that's what the historical articles say World War one lasted from 1914 to 1918 during the war men went away the women went into factories and a lot of them wore pants and they started getting a lot of money they started getting independence when the boys came back most of the women the history says they grudgingly went back to wearing skirts and working the home but some of them didn't and that caused the roaring 20s now I hope none of these pictures stumble anybody I tried to look this might be the only one because it's run a little bit of thigh there so I'm sorry price you to cover that up I missed that one but the Roaring Twenties was a time of smote women smoking drinking and men doing out there did it all together high heels and moving up their skirts and this is actually a pretty modest picture now that woman's a little morally dressed there so forgive me for that but the Roaring Twenties were an awful awful time the Roaring Twenties were the first time women ever cut their hair look at this a New York newspaper the headline can you imagine this the headline is this woman right here Irene castle the original bobbed hair woman now she had just a spaghetti strap on there so I covered that up I didn't see that to the end so I thought why better cover that but look Church this is the headline now at the bottom this says barbershops being replaced by beauty shops women's and provement League reports 20,000 women weekly adopting new hair dress 20,000 women would rush in these shops in New York cut my hair cut my hair cut my hair one woman who wrote an article who lived in the 1920s she said when she cut her hair or the 20s she cut her hair then she started working because they need to work in New York she said the men would sit in there and laugh and snicker and get upset about the women cutting their hair and she said it was the biggest decision a woman would make in the 1920s was the cut her hair not because her husband or boyfriend or husband or grandfather father was dead set against it it was the biggest decision she'd make in her life in the 1920s to cut her hair can you imagine that night so there's Irene castle Roaring Twenties awful awful time that's when sports took off Babe Ruth and all these guys the Jack Dempsey the boxer it just took off during that time sports and then transportation the nightlife all those kind of things took off okay you probably know this picture maybe not this is Marlene Dietrich in 1933 let me look here make sure I got the year right she wore pants for she's a movie star she wore pants in Paris and the Paris chief of police wrote her letter and said if you don't get back in women's clothes I'm kicking you out of Paris and this was the pictures so you know what she did she changed back into a woman's dress but she kept the men's suit and hat and everything she kept all that on and they let her stay the first one of the first women to ever wear pants out in public here's the next one Audrey Hepburn she did the same thing one of the first few women to wear pants they and they would go out and they'd push the limits and then everybody would and then they'd stop and that's what Satan does today right a new fashion not everybody does it at first everybody rejects it but then give it a few years and then everybody accepts it that's either yeah that's Katharine Hepburn not Audrey Katharine Hepburn so the 30s were 30s and 40s were just filled with people just trying it out a little bit just a few renegades I'll say like that renegades the God's Word but remember now this time everybody's cutting their hair they're starting to wear makeup now that's okay now history says women would always be found dabbing their noses with powder and painting their faces and all kinds of things all over all over public because that's what they saw in the movie theaters movies became so popular in the 1920s and 1930s because the humor whoo who remembers the Great Depression during the Great Depression history says people instead of going to God the people flocked by the millions to movie theaters and they made the movie so cheap that anybody could afford it even during the time of the Great Depression and so instead of the history literally says us instead of going to God they went and drown their sorrows to get encouraged or they would drink or whatever do awful things and then they were they would go to movie theaters and try to get some type of hope at the movie theater look how devilish Satan is look how look how evil he is he makes it so cheap everybody can afford it the 19 40s and 50s again not much changing here other than the two-piece bathing suit I didn't put a picture that on there because I don't want to put bathing suits on there but this happened in the 19th I'm sorry this is 32 the first woman Alice marble the first woman to ever wear shorts and play sports and they said she played like a man because she had man's clothes on look that bobbed hair shorts on and that's something 1915 I'm sorry nineteen fifties you could not find women in pants and high schools or public schools the shocking thing was a two-piece two-piece bathing suit and capri pants got popular who's that I forget who that woman was that might be Mary Tyler Moore oh yeah I'm sorry that's all thank you Audrey Hepburn thank you she's coming up later so he had Katharine Hepburn this must have been her daughter Audrey Hepburn so she was very famous for wearing capri pants oh it's her sister really well good for you sister I didn't know that really that's 20 years later so she must have been quite younger yeah cuz Katharine was in the 30s and she this is 1952 Yeah right right yeah that started in the Roaring Twenties they got all their vote voting rights all these things it started in the 20s awful so 40s and 50s like I said you had a few renegades now the 60s sexual revolution this this the two decades that destroyed America were the roaring 20s and then the 1960s the sexual revolution this is Mary Quant I'm not sure how to say her name kWe aunt she was a designer in Europe and she's the first one to design skirts that went above the knee the very first one and that's where the miniskirt started in the 60s now you probably know a lot about the 60s so I'm not gonna say a whole lot about that yeah Mary Quant that's I'm just guessing on the pronunciation one of the most awful things of the 60s though was unisex clothing hippies they started experimenting with drugs pretty soon boys grew their hair long girls cut their hair girls and the main thing was girls wearing men's pants and they all were the same shirts and church I believe that I believe that was planting the seeds for what we have today with transgender and people not knowing if I'm male or female and then homosexuality I believe those were the seeds that were planted like the Bible said you sow to the wind you reap a whirlwind that's how I'm going to end the chapter tomorrow hopefully I'll finish the chapter tomorrow if you sow to the wind you'll reap a whirlwind so see the the the the the fashion designers were sowing to the wind they're just sowing their seeds out there they're gonna reap a whirlwind and that's what we have today and of course homosexuality took off 1970s history literally says this the 1970s can be summed up in one word pants it literally says that one word defines the 70s pants women in pen that's Mary Tyler Moore I'm pretty sure you're welcome to correct me I know that's Dick Van Dyke I know that I always knew something was wrong about that guy even growing up I knew something was wrong he said I thought man that's strange fella cuz I saw when he was a little older so she was the first woman to and I told you this last week she's the first woman to wear pants on a TV sitcom live on TV but they'd only let her wear pants in one segment of the show so let's say there's three segments of a TV show 30-minute sitcom she could only wear pants and one of them and that's Mary Tyler Moore she just died last year women started wearing clothes you could see through in the 70s the disco became popular on the nightlife drugs all those things in the 1970s but women in pants was the main one and I have articles from my teachers union they sent us magazines every month one of them I joined the Union in 2004 in 2005 I got a magazine with women and pants right on the front saying where are unions in 1970 and 1971 our unions helped where women sir helped women wear pants to schools in the 1970s so before that a woman could not wear pants to work in a school there was always a separation between male and female right but because of teachers unions they could only wear pants if their pants matched their top it had to match they couldn't wear pants that were of a different color than their shirts that's striking the 1970s okay nineteen oh yeah this is striking 1970s it literally says this Levi's launched their division four pants in 1968 for women so Levi's no one ever made pants for women until 1968 Macy's the store Macy's wouldn't hire a woman in pants until the 1970s nor would AT&T it's right here I got it in history 18 T would not hire woman and then one of the company said yes we'll hire woman as long in pants as long as she doesn't act like a man that's what history says literally what history says now 1980s and 90s I didn't put much in there because it just got worse and worse you had the grunge move you had the punk move punk rockers hip hop of the 80s and 90s they just showed more and more body parts but the the very height of it was on the beaches where they would wear string bikinis and other pieces of articles I don't want to say out loud where you basically saw everything except the private parts that's basically you saw everything in but the private parts and I remember as a child I remember flipping through Sports Illustrated in the 90s and seeing women in stream bikinis like what and then you know and like I told you I got addicted to pornography things like that so pretty soon I had those same pictures of those women from Sports Illustrated hanging all over my walls because of the awful temptation that that brought so fashion basically reached its pinnacle the late 90s you know with those type of swimwear pieces and then now we're seeing homosexual I almost sexuality take over transgender take over don't know what else could be I don't know what else could be left the Bible said in the last days they would lose natural affection and we know that they don't have the same affection I don't have affection for babies so they murder them there were no affection the men don't have affection for women so they have affection for men the women don't have affection for men that so they have affection for women they've lost natural affection and all started with cutting the hair it all started with wear and makeup it all started with these things that we think are people might think are so simple but they mean a lot to God let me close with these two quotes and I'll be done here by the grace of the Lord so to make sure I don't miss anything okay well Graham said now we'll take the Pentecostal women she shouldn't wear shorts makeup or cut her hair but she looks back down to the Methodists and say look at that woman do so-and-so say the woman let's say the woman don't wear shorts but herself with bobbed hair so programs comparing a Pentecost and a Methodist woman that look at each other and they look down on each other but they both have both cut their hair they wear makeup and they don't live a godly life but the Brad said the higher you rise in God the more sinful the whole thing looks and then sometimes in prayer can you think about this sometimes in prayer when you imagine when you can imagine the Holy Spirit takes you up into a sphere then the whole thing looks like chaos what women in pants women cutting their hair it looks like chaos then when you come back down you seem like to the people you're a rascal you're nothing but an old sarcastic because God has taken you so high in hit what his holiness amen he's taking you home in his beauty and his holiness that when you come back down you realize this is awful this is trashy this is disgusting this is dirty this is abominable to God because God's Spirit is so holy and set apart but a man said see these that they say you're a few you're a fool if you preach it because you stand as an old crank always rebuking the people about their physical appearance but if you ever climb into them spheres one time when you can be in the presence of God not through emotion see that's why most women today in denominational churches they just get emotional in God's presence they really don't climb that high in God's presence which in other words mother brother Graham calls that bubble dancing he said there's an anointing for bubble dancing you get so happy you just get happy he said but when you get into the presence of an angel or you get into God's presence you feel like you're gonna die and that's the difference you get so high in God so close to God's presence all of this cutting hair makeup and pants it it seems so awful he said not through emotion but through the genuine Holy Spirit lifting you up the whole thing is ro ichabod the glory of the lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit that's right there's none of them that's right none of them remember Ella Graham said every denomination will take the mark of the beast every single one of them here's a different quote and if you're Church a Pentecostal Church that tells you long hair and stuff it just finances and you got a spare tire in the back of your head and so for them kind of things that man is possessed of the devil think about how many demon-possessed preachers we have just in Akron oh you don't gotta let your hair grow out where the BAM said you're possessed with Satan but they don't froth at the mouth they're not cutting themselves down they might get tattoos that shows they got a wrong spirit there but brother have said you're possessed of the devil when you say you can cut your hair you're fine for God's Word said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair should this on her head if she desires her husband and her husband is the church and the church is Christ she is this religious prostitute naked and don't know it naked don't the Bible say the woman's covering her hair isn't her hair given to her for a covering to show that she's under the headship that means she's under she's obeying the leadership of her husband who her husband's obeying the leadership of Christ and Christ obeys a leadership of God and that is the order of Authority for the entire universe I think about that the whole order of the universe is God Christ man woman that's the whole order of the universe and the way a woman shows that is to let her hair grow long the way a man shows that cuts his hair someday by ministers someday yonder at the judgment bar I've tried to pour the medicine what's the medicine don't cut your hair women men cut your hair women don't wear pants women don't wear makeup women don't smoke all these things he said I pull I've tried to pour the medicine in and I'll hold it with my hands and you spit it right back out between your fingers God will judge them someday that's the say at the Lord thus saith the Lord so in other words brother Graham is preaching and if they're sitting in the congregation that's going in their mouth right like your parents used to force you to take the medicine you didn't want to but they stick the spoon in there anyway my mom did that or she mixed it with some sugary drink or something like that maybe some coke but then they get sick all this tastes awful and it's come spinning out between the fingers all women don't have to cut their or women can cut their hair we don't have to let it grow long or I can wear shorts if I want to I can do all these things I can wear parents if I want to and they're spitting it out and wrote and said that's what it'll look like on the day of judgment they weren't able to digest the medicine of God amen it hasn't been a bunch of foolishness or some crazy old preacher how about a young preacher I'm kind of still young right come on it encouraged me say Amen know some crazy old man all worked up pretty soon I'll be old man of God Aires it isn't because it's the word of the Lord but I can be like brother brand I can say oh they say all yours preaching it cuz you're old man I say no i preach it when I was a young 23 year old man amen I believe it when I was young I believe it when it's old because God's Word doesn't change Amen see it's not a foolishness it's not some crazy old man it's the word of the Lord and a genuine real Christian will cope with that inside man the spirit that was back down to the beginning which is the word let's stand to our feet by God's grace those scriptures are those quotes and scriptures just came on my heart as I was preparing the last few days I hope they were a blessing was that okay by God's grace hope it was a blessing and like I said if you guys if this church you know if you find any pictures like this that will help me out please do you know please provide it for me I find it so fantastic I love sharing these things with people because we're in a generation that do not know the ways of God and for the first time I can't tell you I've had numerous people that tell me brother Jesse I so enjoyed the meek and humble spirit when you presented about makeup or pants on those videos because we never knew it before people appreciate the meekness that it's brought in because I never heard it before because I never heard it before and was brought to me in a meek manner I can share it the same way now brother Bram he could ball him out because they knew better they saw the change he could say mrs. dogmeat and they would laugh he listened to it they laugh because they were raised that way they saw it but if we say dogmeat mrs. dogmeat today everybody gets upset which they might have a right to it's different we're in a different age they don't understand they never even heard it so we don't want to make them we don't want to basically say they're dogmeat and not give them a chance to repent does every understand that but if the Holy Spirit knowing that somebody to say mrs. dogmeat today that that would be the Holy Spirit I'd be up the Holy Spirit but I don't choose to go into churches and be like that or Bible studies I don't go into people home and say well if you paint your face you're mr. dogmeat because it wasn't brought to me that way remember the Bible said be wise as a serpent harmless as doves right and the Bible said in meekness and fear correcting those who are in condemnation right so you have to go to people that are in captivity they're addicted to certain worldly things we got to go in meekness in the spirit of fear spirit of reverence ok praise the Lord all right thank the Lord I'm not sure how many sermons I'll do on this this might be the last one here we'll see but I just this isn't this is my thought church I thought on a few levels it'd be good to review it have you enjoyed the review I really have it's really helped me it's given me more answers to things I didn't have answers for like the Christian liberties what are exactly Christian liberties also aunt minh thats really helped me zimri remember we went over is emery that's helped me there's been new and this history has helped me and the third thing was I can't I don't have enough time to study on modesty and then preach on other things it kind of comes on this I got so much in my life I could I have to preach on what I'm studying at that time so there was three reasons I thought it was a blessing and you know see my children witness to my mother because this was freshly on their heart that's just another vindication and it was it was acceptable unto God to do that by the grace of the Lord okay praise the Lord okay me okay once you come here we'll see let's think I stand in awe of you praise God I don't want to be clean before the Lord how many want to have his glory and his beauty on them that's what I want to praise God then let's remember as we sing this let's remember how beautiful God is how his spirit is so beautiful and holy pure and let's think of all his glory where if he wasn't merciful it would kill us but he's so merciful to us Lord I stay on the scene you know holy God - [Music] I stand oh yes I stand I stand I stand I stand guard - all praises I stand in all

media hey man thank you Lord what a beautiful name I one more song let's sing this song this song just came out of my heart Lord lift me up and let me stand I sing higher ground I believe it's called a hired gun like brother Graham said how many wonder you lift it up in prayer oh my those are those are the best times wouldn't you say that when Christ lifts you up in prayer and you feel his presence in such a powerful way that when you come back down everything just feels useless it seems dirty seems worldly you don't want to touch nothing because you've been lifted so high up in the spirit Oh hallelujah praise God let's see that praise God Lord lift me up or lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table land a higher bleep then I have Lord plant my seed or higher you

utmost high and catch ugly of glory bright but still out pray till heaven our Lord lead me to pyre gerak Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on table Lord let my let's close in prayer Heavenly Father nor this is our hearts desire to be lifted up dear God there's something about you Lord you're beautiful and you really want to adorn your wife the wife of your son we might say Lord you want her to be beautiful as well Lord that's what these sermons are doing Lord to the bride around the world message after message scriptural truth after scriptural truth precept upon precept line upon line it's washing your bride in your word adorn us Lord God may there be no spot wrinkle or blemish in our garments may we would be adorned with such love such power such humility such faith such beauty like Stephen had as we said he looked like an angel Oh God but that'd be our testimony Lord through our constant prayer life through our constant reading of the word listening to sermons studying the Bible studying history to know the truth of God may you transform our countenance more and more maybe we change from glory to glory from faith to faith conform to the image of the Son of God not another image not the image of Hollywood but Lord the image of Jesus Christ his own character as we saw on Sunday our past character is important but our future character is much more important we must have the end of our faith receiving the end of your faith we don't want to fall off the highway as the prophet saw the woman in high heels fall off the highway she tried to skip those three steps of justification sanctification baptism and all he goes she tried to run down that narrow highway or that way of holiness and fell off or maybe not skip any step maybe we walk your steps and then walk your way of holiness may we walk it in a godly manner Lord God that Lord one day at the meeting in the air your bride will be adorned she'll be adorned in beauty and glory and splendor we say she have her bracelets on her spiritual bracelets she has her necklace on her hair is all done she just looks at the height of her beauty Lord God that's what we're designing to do Lord God we're desiring to be clothed by you dressed by you molded shaped by you shape our hearts shape our thought life shape our character Lord God we want to be that spotless beautiful bride we want you to rejoice over the church that we're becoming the people that we're becoming we know the church is a hole Lord we know you don't deal with groups of Gentiles individuals but may as many individuals as possible in our church Lord may they be prepared as a bride adorned for a husband for you God thank you Lord for this time thank you for the effect it's having upon our lives help us be lights and witnesses let's get caught up in the glory and prayer Lord God we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen charge god bless you going for your damage to Lord
