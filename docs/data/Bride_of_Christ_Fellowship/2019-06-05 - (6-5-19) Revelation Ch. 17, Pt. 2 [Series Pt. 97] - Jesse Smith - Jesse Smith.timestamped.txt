[29:31] thankful for God's mercy tonight praise
[29:33] the Lord
[29:41] revelations
[29:42] and would like to just pick up on where
[29:45] we left off last week revelation 17 and
[30:02] I think Lord willing tonight we'll start
[30:05] looking at all the proofs about Mystery
[30:10] Babylon and I think it'd be good for the
[30:13] the children here to go through these by
[30:18] the grace of the Lord it's revelation 17
[30:25] let's start at verse 6 I believe we read
[30:27] 2 verse 5 and let's look to the Lord
[30:31] here after we read our text and ask the
[30:34] Lord to help us here tonight
[30:36] revelation 17 6 let's all read verse 6
[30:49] together then I'll read verse 7 myself
[30:51] Sabri there everybody got their Bibles
[30:53] there thanks girls let's all read verse
[30:56] 6 ready one two three and I saw the
[30:59] woman drunken with the blood of the
[31:01] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[31:03] of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered
[31:06] with great admiration now read verse
[31:09] seven your Lord willing and then verse
[31:12] seven and the angel said unto me
[31:14] wherefore didst thou marvel I will tell
[31:17] thee the mystery of the woman and of the
[31:20] Beast that carried her which hath the
[31:22] seven heads and ten horns let's have one
[31:25] more word of Prayer
[31:27] let's just bow our heads here have any
[31:29] father we're so thankful for your mercy
[31:30] Lord I think of this chapter Lord you
[31:34] called me out of this woman Lord you
[31:35] called me out of this church Nora and
[31:38] her daughters and I thank you for that
[31:39] Lord God that's what your mercy did for
[31:42] me
[31:42] so loadings me great praise though it
[31:44] rises up in my soul Lord I say thank you
[31:47] Lord this is what your mercy did for me
[31:49] it called me out Lord and separated me
[31:51] unto you that I could be your child I
[31:54] could learn to walk with you Lord God
[31:56] and learn to love you bless us here
[31:58] tonight in your divine presence as we
[32:00] preach in your word and sing and worship
[32:02] Lord God the Father will give you all
[32:05] the glory and what I'm trusting you to
[32:06] answer these requests that we've lifted
[32:08] up tonight again thank you for it Lord
[32:10] Jesus we feel you near Lord God and may
[32:13] you be pleased with our worship and
[32:15] father honor these requests in Jesus
[32:17] Christ's name the church said amen god
[32:20] bless you me and Sita then praise the
[32:21] Lord before you get started Lydia if I
[32:28] run out of battery let me know just go
[32:29] like that because it's you know the
[32:31] brothers preach brother Diggs preached
[32:33] with her twice on Sunday and it's been a
[32:34] while since I switched the batteries so
[32:36] case our case I run out let me know well
[32:42] let's look here to the Scriptures last
[32:45] week we looked at part 1 and we showed
[32:47] how wisdom was required to recognize
[32:51] this identity of this woman and we of
[32:55] course we all know it to be the Roman
[32:56] Catholic Church but if somebody didn't
[32:58] know it we're going to start proving it
[33:00] here tonight by God's grace and then we
[33:04] also looked at the confusion around
[33:06] Mystery Babylon who could it be
[33:08] and the the second-closest will on the
[33:11] runner-up we thought and I felt like as
[33:14] after studying it was Jerusalem because
[33:17] Jerusalem is called a harlot and a city
[33:21] but yet I did the math this week as well
[33:28] there's only 11 million Jews in the
[33:30] entire world and 82 percent of them live
[33:34] in the United States and Israel now
[33:37] there's a thousand millions in a billion
[33:42] try to wrap your mind around that one
[33:44] because you can go up to 999 million and
[33:47] then when you get your thousandth
[33:49] million now you've got 1 billion all
[33:52] right so 11 million Jews and there's 1.3
[33:59] billion Catholics so the Jew the Jews
[34:06] cannot be this woman who sits upon Malta
[34:09] and waters and nations and tongues the
[34:11] Jews can't be because 11 million is not
[34:14] even it's not even a tenth of the 1.3
[34:18] billion it's like not even it's not even
[34:21] 1% so it can't be Jerusalem Jerusalem
[34:25] can't be and neither can the Muslims
[34:28] because Istanbul which we'll look at a
[34:32] little bit here
[34:33] Istanbul sits on seven hills and that's
[34:36] a very famous city but if sambal is not
[34:39] even the headquarters of Islam Mecca is
[34:42] Mecca is a different City where they all
[34:44] take their pilgrimage right there their
[34:46] command and once a once their lifetime
[34:48] to go to Mecca and we don't of course we
[34:52] don't have any pilgrim pilgrim ridges
[34:54] and the message although some people
[34:56] might think so but we don't have any the
[34:59] main pilgrim we got to be is just be a
[35:01] pilgrim and stranger all the days of our
[35:02] life and don't let this world become our
[35:05] home praise God we got to have homes
[35:07] gotta have jobs got to have food but it
[35:09] never really is our home our home is New
[35:12] Jerusalem praise God we have to make
[35:14] sure we keep it that way although we
[35:15] appreciate home and brother Branham had
[35:18] said in a couple occasions you know he
[35:19] had a rambling spirit he wished you know
[35:22] he could have stayed in Drew in
[35:24] Jeffersonville that would have been his
[35:25] home but he God had to give him a
[35:26] rambling spirit to spread the message
[35:28] and so we're thankful that you know that
[35:31] we can have a home and I'm thankful I
[35:33] don't have to ramble around the world
[35:34] thank God for that I love to be home so
[35:38] Jerusalem is the runner up but still
[35:40] only has a few matching requirements and
[35:45] so we know this woman has to be Rome and
[35:49] let me start out with this let me read
[35:52] this there was two other church age
[35:54] messengers that believed now of course
[35:56] probably more but at least two of them
[35:58] that I know of that believe Mystery
[36:00] Babylon was Rome one of them was Iranian
[36:03] and one of them was Martin Luther now on
[36:06] top of that you had other church fathers
[36:08] that I've read that believed Rome was
[36:11] Mystery Babylon lack lactantius
[36:15] Tertullian of course he started the word
[36:17] Trinity so he had some things right but
[36:19] he had some things awful wrong Jerome
[36:22] was an
[36:23] other church Father and then Reformation
[36:25] Reformers John Knox
[36:27] John Calvin William Tyndale and John
[36:30] Wickliffe all believed that Rome was the
[36:33] mother harlot and so I we we find it
[36:39] there's much great evidence that this
[36:41] woman is Rome now I have eleven proofs
[36:44] and we'll try to go through these quite
[36:48] quickly or we'll try to go through them
[36:50] quickly so then we can move on
[36:51] Lord winning in the weeks to come but as
[36:53] I realize you know I've gotten numerous
[36:56] emails and calls that people are really
[37:00] enjoying the live stream and so I don't
[37:02] know who's listening but I know I want
[37:04] to go through this this chapter and I
[37:06] want to preach it and of course I know
[37:07] my children need to hear it as well so
[37:09] I'll try to go quick but maybe not too
[37:11] quick now let's look at verse one here
[37:14] I'll try to look at these scriptures
[37:17] here
[37:21] revelation 17 1 and there came one of
[37:23] the seven angels which had the seven
[37:25] vials and talked with me saying come
[37:27] hither I will shew unto thee the
[37:29] judgment of the great that sitteth
[37:31] upon many waters with whom the kings of
[37:33] the earth have committed fornication and
[37:35] the inhabitants of the earth have been
[37:37] made drunk with the wine of her
[37:38] fornication
[37:42] verse three so he carried me away in the
[37:45] spirit into the wilderness and I saw a
[37:47] woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast
[37:50] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[37:52] heads and ten horns and the woman was
[37:55] arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and
[37:57] decked with gold and precious stones and
[38:00] pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[38:02] full of abominations and filthiness of
[38:05] her fornication and upon her forehead
[38:07] was a name written Mystery Babylon the
[38:10] Great the mother of harlots and
[38:12] abominations of the earth I will stop
[38:13] right there now some of these symbols we
[38:16] already looked at remember a couple
[38:17] weeks ago we looked at the horrors
[38:18] forehead remember that 144,000 had the
[38:21] father's name in their forehead but this
[38:25] false church has a whole horse forehead
[38:29] which means she's unashamed of her sin
[38:32] and that's in Jeremiah chapter 2 we're
[38:35] not going to read it because we already
[38:36] read
[38:36] but the Bible said God God anoints
[38:39] Jeremiah to say Jerusalem you have a
[38:41] horse forehead because you're unashamed
[38:45] he said but I'm gonna give you pastors
[38:47] after my own heart that'll feed you
[38:49] praise God and he say the only thing you
[38:51] got to do is acknowledge your iniquity
[38:54] be honest before God confess your sin
[38:57] tell the truth
[38:58] admit where you're wrong and God said
[39:01] I'll receive you if your turn from your
[39:03] sins and acknowledge where you fell
[39:05] short and if you return to me God said
[39:08] I'll return to you amen Oh God is so
[39:10] gracious to forgive and so it's so much
[39:14] greater than we would you know we would
[39:15] give somebody five chances maybe six
[39:17] chances you know but God is so merciful
[39:19] life time after time after time God
[39:22] continued us to have mercy and all we
[39:24] can say is thank God for divine mercy
[39:26] because human mercy can only go so far
[39:29] but God's mercy goes way beyond ours
[39:31] Amen hallelujah now let's look at these
[39:36] reasons now I like to just hit a few
[39:40] scriptures just to kind of give you a
[39:43] place to stand here on the Word of God
[39:47] let's go to acts yeah let's go to book
[39:51] of Acts and I want to read a couple of
[39:55] verses here acts 738 yeah let's just
[39:58] react 738 so I just want to show a few
[40:04] scriptures how a woman is a church and
[40:07] so Israel we know was was a church acts
[40:12] 738 now let's read 38 this is he that
[40:16] was in the church in the wilderness with
[40:19] the angel which spake to him in mount
[40:21] sinai with our fathers who received the
[40:24] lively Oracle's given to us so the Bible
[40:27] calls Moses with Israel and then
[40:30] speaking of God God says I was with the
[40:33] church in the wilderness because the
[40:36] word church of course means called out
[40:38] alright now go to Ezekiel 16 so not only
[40:43] as Israel Church Israel is a woman so
[40:48] john sees a woman in revelation 17 so
[40:51] this woman has to be a church and like i
[40:53] said i'm doing this for the young
[40:55] children I know Beatrice knows this I'm
[40:56] sure Aaron knows this but bear with us
[40:59] were we're laying down the foundations
[41:01] for the children so the children know
[41:02] that all right so zekiel sixteen and
[41:08] let's pull the first one there lady went
[41:11] and pull verse one of this a beautiful
[41:16] chapter it shows how God found Israel in
[41:19] Egypt and the Bible says it's like she
[41:21] was laying in her own blood you know she
[41:23] was just left for dead spiritually but
[41:27] God came and rescued her so it's a
[41:30] beautiful picture of the Lord look let's
[41:35] go down to verse 4 as for thy nativity
[41:40] thy birth in the day that I was born thy
[41:43] navel was not cut neither was now wash
[41:45] and water to supple thee that was not
[41:48] salted on or swaddled at all no I pity
[41:51] thee to do any of these under thee I
[41:53] have compassion upon thee but thou was
[41:56] cast out in the open field to the look
[41:59] no thing of that person the day that
[42:01] thou was born and when I passed by the
[42:04] install the pollutant thine own blood I
[42:06] said unto thee where now what's in thy
[42:09] blood live yay I said in thee when thou
[42:11] wast in thy blood live now let's go to
[42:16] verse 8 now when I pass by thee and
[42:19] looked upon me behold that time was the
[42:22] time of love and I spread my skirt over
[42:24] thee and covered thy nakedness yeah I
[42:27] swear unto thee and entered into
[42:28] covenant with thee saith the Lord and
[42:31] now became as mine now I'm gonna skip
[42:37] down here go down to verse 15
[42:43] without his trust in that own beauty and
[42:45] play the harlot because of thy renown
[42:48] and pours out life or negations on every
[42:51] one that passed by his it was now this
[42:56] is striking isn't it God finds Israel in
[42:59] her lowest most bloody most
[43:02] awful position you could be in and God
[43:04] spreads his skirt over and God then
[43:06] cleans her washes her out adorns her and
[43:09] she gets all beautiful and gets a
[43:10] husband and then she starts flirting
[43:12] with other men now go to verse 3 though
[43:15] I'll go to verse 2 though that you can
[43:16] see this is Jerusalem son of man cause
[43:19] drew 'some to know her abominations now
[43:22] we know God knows the beginning from the
[43:23] end right
[43:24] God knew Jerusalem was going to turn
[43:26] away but even in his mercy even God
[43:28] knowing that they would backside God
[43:30] still chose the khalsa call it Jerusalem
[43:33] out of the world see because he wanted a
[43:36] kingdom of priests he one of the people
[43:38] that would worship Him and serve him
[43:40] amen and so God knows our church if God
[43:43] will forgive drew Israel Jerusalem for
[43:46] all that they've done and still save
[43:48] them through the Covenant of the blood
[43:50] of bulls and goats on Mount Sinai then
[43:52] we know God will be with us despite our
[43:54] mistakes because our covenant is with
[43:56] the blood of Jesus Christ amen my god
[43:59] knew they would backside God knew they'd
[44:01] even crucify his own son but yet his
[44:04] love extend to them how much more does
[44:06] his love extend us amen through the
[44:08] blood of Christ amen
[44:10] see it was a church and it was a woman
[44:13] so a woman children always represents
[44:15] the church and this is good for you
[44:17] nature and virtue that's right good good
[44:18] for them too you know that's this is all
[44:20] good for everybody so you can see this
[44:23] is playing the scripture he's speaking
[44:24] to a city he's speaking to the capital
[44:27] of Israel and he's saying you're like a
[44:29] woman that I cleaned up and I decked out
[44:32] like her wedding day but yet she wasn't
[44:35] faithful to me all right now go to verse
[44:40] 22 so you can see this too and in all
[44:43] that abominations and I whoredoms thou
[44:45] must not remember the days that I youth
[44:47] when thou was naked and bare and what's
[44:49] polluting that blood so see I can I can
[44:52] understand I can relate with how people
[44:54] may get confused with Babylon being
[44:56] Jerusalem because it's some of the same
[44:58] language can everybody see that now of
[44:59] course that's without the understanding
[45:01] the message but see we never want to get
[45:03] prideful and say why can't you see it
[45:05] you know we God has to open their eyes
[45:07] right and they have to be open to God
[45:09] opening their eyes we can't give a
[45:11] revelation we can pray for people to get
[45:13] revelation but only the father
[45:15] said only the father have revealed it to
[45:17] you amen
[45:18] the father has revealed to them so we
[45:22] have to be merciful and that's just a
[45:25] beautiful scripture there that God here
[45:29] says remember the days years now that's
[45:31] what we need to remember church we must
[45:33] never get too far removed from what did
[45:35] we look like before we came in the
[45:37] message or what kind of life did we live
[45:40] you know sometimes I'm sure I'm sure
[45:41] Beatrice you know so we've served God
[45:43] you know I'm coming up on 20 years on
[45:45] most of in the message and and Beatrice
[45:47] probably a lot longer than that but you
[45:49] know sometimes we forget how far God has
[45:52] brought us from but that that's the
[45:54] trouble Israel got in Israel forgot how
[45:57] awful it was in Egypt and we've got to
[45:59] remember say God help me not to get
[46:01] complacent where I forget where you
[46:03] brought me from help me to remember the
[46:05] big pet that I was in before I came back
[46:07] to the father's house amen
[46:09] help me to realize how great I've got it
[46:12] amen
[46:12] help me not to forget all your benefits
[46:14] that you daily bestow upon me amen amen
[46:19] and I was listening to brother Branham
[46:21] you know today condemnation by
[46:24] representation and boat man was saying
[46:26] he said he said look at the master child
[46:29] he said that fornication was so evil
[46:31] that it took forty generations to purify
[46:36] that seed line before that bastard child
[46:38] could enter in the kingdom of God that's
[46:40] over 400 years so of course he could
[46:43] never that bastard child could never go
[46:45] in or is the sentence to 40 generations
[46:48] now that's that that's that's unreal but
[46:52] bro man was saying that's how evil
[46:55] fornication is to God but then we know
[46:57] by the end of the message God gave
[46:59] brother rather the revelation that the
[47:00] blood of Jesus Christ washes all that
[47:03] away and a bastard child today can still
[47:06] be born again and filled with the Holy
[47:07] Ghost amen because of God's great mercy
[47:10] and love but sometimes we forget you
[47:13] know the awfulness of our sin and we
[47:15] forget where we came from that's what
[47:17] God's telling Israel you forgot what it
[47:19] was to be like over there and he says
[47:21] never forget be always grateful and
[47:24] everything give thanks for this is the
[47:25] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[47:27] you amen
[47:29] as our brother was preaching on Sunday
[47:30] about not murmuring and not complaining
[47:33] I thought surely was for me that sermon
[47:36] was really for me because I don't want
[47:38] to complain I want to be thankful in all
[47:40] situations I want to look up where all
[47:42] the blessings come from I don't want to
[47:44] I don't want to get angry I don't want
[47:46] to get upset with situations because
[47:48] anything that happens God allowed it and
[47:50] it's for my good amen all these things
[47:53] work together for good to them that love
[47:55] the Lord now a familiar scripture
[48:00] Bertold Ephesians 5 or well since we're
[48:02] there go to John 329 since we're there
[48:04] so I want the children to see this John
[48:06] 329 I'm trying to let the Lord help me
[48:10] too or just follow lenient leadership of
[48:12] the Lord and maybe show some scriptures
[48:15] maybe the children haven't heard before
[48:18] John 329 this is beautiful you know when
[48:21] I first saw this I just like wow the
[48:23] Bible really says this you know this is
[48:25] really wonderful truth John 329 all
[48:34] right
[48:36] now let's go to the verse 28 though ye
[48:38] yourselves bear me witness and I said
[48:40] I'm not the Christ but I am but that I
[48:42] am sent before him so John the Baptist
[48:45] was sent before to prepare the way for
[48:47] Christ verse 29
[48:49] keep the half the bride is the
[48:51] bridegroom but the friend of the
[48:54] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[48:56] him rejoiceth greatly because of the
[49:00] bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore
[49:03] is filled fulfilled he must increase but
[49:07] I must decrease amen how do any man of
[49:11] God any messenger any forerunner of
[49:14] Christ will always say help me to
[49:17] decrease and may Jesus Christ increase
[49:20] amen hallelujah I children did you catch
[49:23] that John the Baptist is saying I'm a
[49:26] friend to the bridegroom or the husband
[49:28] I am a friend of the of Christ in other
[49:31] words and I rejoice in the voice of
[49:34] Christ but he says he that is the
[49:37] bridegroom he that's the husband is the
[49:40] one who has the wife
[49:41] in other words John saying I'm not
[49:42] married to the church Jesus is married
[49:45] to the church amen the church is not my
[49:47] wife it's not I'm just trying to point
[49:50] I'm the friend of the husband and I'm
[49:52] just trying to bring them together amen
[49:54] brother bands not her husband he's just
[49:57] pointing us to our husband amen now
[50:01] children do you see that John the
[50:03] Baptist calls Jesus the husband and that
[50:06] means the husband has a wife and we're
[50:09] the wife we're the Bride of Christ okay
[50:13] we're called the Church of Living God
[50:15] now go to Ephesians 5:22 and I'm taking
[50:23] a lot of time on this but I want to just
[50:26] anchor in their hearts Asian's 5:22
[50:40] well for times sake let me just skip
[50:44] ahead here let's go to let's go to five
[50:48] 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own
[50:51] husband's as into the Lord for the
[50:54] husband is the head of the wife even as
[50:55] Christ is the head of the church
[50:59] so Christ's wife is called a church
[51:02] alright and he is the savior of the body
[51:06] therefore as the church is subject unto
[51:08] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[51:10] husband's in everything now of course
[51:12] brother man tells us not if your husband
[51:14] tells you to break the word you don't
[51:16] submit to sin but everything that's in
[51:18] the Lord you submit in the Lord now go
[51:22] down to verse 32 this is a great mystery
[51:25] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[51:27] church there it is again
[51:30] so see a church always represents a
[51:32] woman or a group of people and so now
[51:36] getting back to Mystery Babylon John
[51:38] looks up and he sees a woman sitting on
[51:40] a scarlet coloured Beast so this woman
[51:43] is a church alright now that's so the
[51:47] first proof here the first proof that
[51:50] the Catholic Church is Mystery Babylon
[51:51] is that the Catholic Church is a woman
[51:54] in the in the sight of God according to
[51:56] definitions of the Bible because a woman
[52:00] is a church that's the first proof so
[52:05] see it can't be Istanbul Turkey
[52:08] because Istanbul Turkey is not a church
[52:11] right it's just a city of the Muslims
[52:15] where a lot of Muslims live there but
[52:17] it's not a church okay
[52:19] so right there that knocks off Istanbul
[52:21] the Mystery Babylon can't be in the
[52:23] Muslims it's got to be somebody else
[52:25] it's got to be Rome alright so that's
[52:28] the first one second one the Catholic
[52:30] Church is modern day Babylon
[52:33] now children you know in Genesis 10 and
[52:37] 11
[52:38] Babylon is first named at what the tower
[52:41] Babel right now
[52:44] this was a group of men and women that
[52:47] wanted to reach heaven by man-made means
[52:51] while establishing a name for themselves
[52:53] right they said we're gonna reach to
[52:55] heaven right and we're gonna make a name
[52:58] for ourselves so we're gonna reach
[53:00] heaven in our own name and that just
[53:02] gets right into blasphemous names right
[53:05] well we're we're Pentecostal so we can
[53:08] make it to heaven on our own or we're
[53:10] we're Lutheran we're Baptists we're
[53:12] Methodists we're message we can make it
[53:14] there on our own we'll only make it to
[53:16] heaven by the name of Jesus Christ we
[53:19] don't take any other name yeah we got to
[53:20] have a church name on the building and
[53:22] be recognized by the government yeah we
[53:24] got to have a movement that we're
[53:25] associated with message to the our but
[53:28] that's not a real name our real name is
[53:30] mrs. Lord Jesus Christ amen because the
[53:33] whole family in heaven and earth is
[53:34] named Lord Jesus Christ so those really
[53:38] you know message really isn't our name
[53:39] that's just what we call our movement
[53:41] okay just like the Lutheran's were you
[53:43] know they were Lutheran's because that
[53:44] was the movement of their day right but
[53:47] really we're a Holy Ghost fool
[53:48] Christian's married to Jesus Christ
[53:50] that's our real name the Lord Jesus
[53:52] Christ now you know God stopped
[53:58] Babylon's movement by confounding their
[54:01] language
[54:02] now the Roman Catholic Church is modern
[54:04] Babel because it promotes a false
[54:06] man-made path to heaven contrary to
[54:10] Scripture now what it does it gives a
[54:16] false works requirement for salvation
[54:19] which one man calls an arduous process
[54:22] so if you ever read their book which
[54:24] I've read it not all the way through but
[54:26] I've read their catechism it's hard to
[54:28] understand their way to heaven it's
[54:30] really hard there's all these kind of
[54:32] penances they do and there's different
[54:33] levels of sins and they got to go do all
[54:35] these things and confess their sins and
[54:37] member church they can't they cannot
[54:40] have the anointing of the Holy Ghost on
[54:42] them unless that they recently had that
[54:44] wafer did you know that their book says
[54:47] as long as that wafers in their body
[54:49] they got the anointing but as soon as
[54:51] they pass it and use the restroom
[54:53] whatever and the twelve hours goes by
[54:55] digestant they don't have it anymore
[54:57] the anointings off them
[54:58] oh I'm so glad for a seal that stays in
[55:01] my soul the anointings in my soul not to
[55:04] 12 hours but to the day of redemption
[55:06] amen
[55:07] that's why Mel Gibson went in that movie
[55:10] passion you if you read his testimony he
[55:12] took communion every single day because
[55:15] he wanted to make sure he was under the
[55:17] anointing I'm so glad we don't have to
[55:18] do that I'm so glad we don't have to go
[55:20] take a natural way for a natural to make
[55:23] sure I'm anointed what we have to do to
[55:25] make sure we're anointed is pray confess
[55:27] our sins worship because he inhabits the
[55:30] praises of his people amen so see it's a
[55:35] it's a hard thing to get saved in the
[55:37] Catholic Church because it's based upon
[55:38] works and remember it's mandatory
[55:41] according to their paragraph and let me
[55:43] call the paragraph number according to
[55:46] paragraph 1030 it's mandatory that they
[55:50] go to purgatory or hell a form of Hell
[55:53] it's mandatory so when they die it's not
[55:55] a happy thing they know well they think
[55:58] they know that they have to go and
[56:00] suffer in order to go to heaven to be
[56:04] purified oh I'm so glad Jesus does the
[56:06] purification right now Haven Oh what a
[56:09] hope that we have to know that angels
[56:11] are going to pack us or care us not to a
[56:14] place of torment where we have to suffer
[56:16] and say I'm sorry
[56:17] Hail Mary I'm sorry Hail Mary but we can
[56:20] go right to the Friends of God with a
[56:22] brand new body get a theophany body and
[56:24] rejoice with the millions of others that
[56:27] have theophany bodies that will come run
[56:29] and hug us and say my precious brother
[56:31] my precious sister amen
[56:34] it's not a sad thing it's pure joy amen
[56:38] to cross over in that land hallelujah
[56:43] but see just as the original babel
[56:46] exalted their own name Babel Rome does
[56:50] the same thing because they call
[56:52] themselves the holy sea or the Holy
[56:54] Church so they've exalted the name of
[56:57] the Holy See above Jesus Christ
[56:59] they've exalted Mary's name the mother
[57:01] of God they've exalted that above the
[57:03] name of Jesus right because now she's
[57:07] the mother of God well who's higher than
[57:09] God well the only person that could be
[57:10] higher than God is the mud
[57:12] of God because the mothers a wonder that
[57:15] the offspring comes out of right so the
[57:19] mother of God is actually above God now
[57:21] they've exalted another name there's
[57:23] another way to get to heaven through the
[57:25] mother mine so the Catholic Church is a
[57:30] matter today at modern-day Babylon and
[57:32] you and I know that the image in Daniel
[57:34] chapter 2 had four parts to it now of
[57:36] course the last part had the feet and
[57:38] the feet that were both iron and clay
[57:40] but the head was Babylon but we know
[57:45] that each part was Babylon because it
[57:48] was the same spirit right just in a
[57:51] different Kingdom right so is the same
[57:55] demons of Babylon demons that was in
[57:57] Babylon with the Medes and Persians
[57:59] right and then the same demons were a
[58:01] king the Alexander the Great and the
[58:04] same demons were the the Roman Empire
[58:07] but now all those demons are in the
[58:09] unholy Roman Empire right the Roman
[58:12] Catholic Church so we know this so now
[58:16] we know the second proof not only is
[58:18] she's a she's the church it's the Roman
[58:20] Catholic Church it's a woman but the
[58:22] second one is that she's the modern day
[58:25] Babylon that's right now let me say
[58:30] there's two let's go to a scripture here
[58:32] let's go to Daniel 2:35 you got your
[58:36] Bibles and Lydia maybe could board up
[58:37] there Daniel 2:35 now some people say
[58:44] that Rome is the final Kingdom and this
[58:48] this image of Daniels already fulfilled
[58:50] but that's it can't be right because of
[58:52] Daniel 2:35 then was the iron the clay
[58:57] the brass the silver the gold broke into
[58:59] pieces together and became like chaff of
[59:02] the summer threshing floors and the wind
[59:04] carried them away that no place was
[59:07] found for them and the stone that smote
[59:08] the gray image became a great mountain
[59:10] and filled the whole earth some people
[59:13] say that that Jesus when he came the
[59:15] first time was his stone that came and
[59:18] broke the Roman Empire and now now the
[59:22] the images no more the Roman empires no
[59:24] more
[59:25] but anybody with half half half a wisdom
[59:28] or half an ounce of discernment knows
[59:31] that Christianity doesn't reign on the
[59:33] earth
[59:34] Christianity hasn't filled the earth
[59:37] right in fact jesus said he has to
[59:40] shorten the time at the end so that
[59:42] somebody can even be saved so
[59:44] Christianity is not growing Christianity
[59:46] shrinking and we're part of a shrinking
[59:49] group but thank God we're part of it
[59:51] amen we're just like Noah were some of
[59:53] the last believers brother Aaron amen
[59:55] we're some of these last ones that are
[59:57] coloring up who will come into the Ark
[59:59] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:00:02] not in that's right but who will come in
[1:00:04] and be saved in this Great Escape the
[1:00:06] Great Tribulation his brother have said
[1:00:08] our Ark today is Jesus Christ weren't us
[1:00:12] were part of the shrinking movement a
[1:00:14] dying way a shrinking movement not dying
[1:00:17] maybe dying in number but living an
[1:00:20] eternal life praise God but see Jesus
[1:00:23] first coming did not fill the earth with
[1:00:26] Christianity this has to be the second
[1:00:28] coming this has to be the millennium as
[1:00:31] we read last week right because that
[1:00:33] stone becomes a mountain the stone hits
[1:00:36] the earth or the the image the image
[1:00:38] breaks up like chaff and that stone
[1:00:40] grows and covers the whole earth amen
[1:00:43] haha let us know what kind of science is
[1:00:46] that a stone that can hit the earth and
[1:00:49] then expand and cover the whole earth
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:52] it's the growing power of God's Word
[1:01:03] you
[1:01:06] the stone has not come back yet we're
[1:01:09] still waiting for that stone and Babylon
[1:01:12] is still here it's just in a different
[1:01:13] form it's in the feet form of that image
[1:01:17] the feet form
[1:01:18] all right everybody got that okay
[1:01:22] puts the same Neiman Powers just in a
[1:01:25] different form and let me read this
[1:01:28] quote this is from March 1962 brother
[1:01:34] Branham said Russia
[1:01:38] I'm sorry Russia communism isn't going
[1:01:40] to conquer nothing God's Word can't fail
[1:01:42] Romanism is going to conquer the world
[1:01:44] it isn't Russia it's Rome thus saith the
[1:01:47] Lord so we know we've got thus saith the
[1:01:50] Lord Rome has to rule that that that
[1:01:53] image is going to stand until Jesus
[1:01:56] Christ returns for Armageddon praise God
[1:01:59] and then Armageddon the sword goes out
[1:02:00] of his mouth it breaks up everything
[1:02:02] dies right the birds come down and eat
[1:02:04] and that symbolizes that symbolized when
[1:02:07] when the sword comes out and destroys
[1:02:09] them that symbolizes chaff that image
[1:02:12] breaking up and dividing like chaff and
[1:02:14] then God's Word and holiness you know
[1:02:17] will burn up the whole earth and then
[1:02:18] righteousness will reign for a thousand
[1:02:20] years hey I'm halia praise God amen
[1:02:24] that's what it represents that's number
[1:02:26] two we got eleven of these I'm not sure
[1:02:27] how far we'll get tonight number three
[1:02:30] the Catholic Church is the mother of
[1:02:32] harlots so see the Roman Church is the
[1:02:36] first human organized and man led church
[1:02:40] God is not leading the mother harlots
[1:02:45] now the Roman Catholic Church claims
[1:02:48] that on their in their book that they
[1:02:50] are the mother church the church which
[1:02:52] every church took its start that's not
[1:02:55] true they're the church which every
[1:02:57] false Church took their start this
[1:02:59] church did not take a start for Rome our
[1:03:02] church started on the day of Pentecost I
[1:03:06] don't know yeah amen and we can trace
[1:03:09] our lineage all the way back praise God
[1:03:11] from brother Branham to John Wesley
[1:03:13] Hardin Luther and you could take them
[1:03:14] all the way back to st. Paul amen and
[1:03:17] keep taking them back all the way to say
[1:03:19] Peter amen our church started on the day
[1:03:21] of Pentecost and still going strong amen
[1:03:24] in the in the minority of believers
[1:03:27] we're still going strong in that small
[1:03:29] little group as we said we're a
[1:03:31] shrinking number but it's still going
[1:03:33] strong in their lives because the blood
[1:03:35] of Jesus Christ has never lost its power
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:40] now she claims to be the mother church
[1:03:46] but because of her traditions
[1:03:48] she makes the Word of God of none effect
[1:03:50] she limits the Holy One of Israel praise
[1:03:55] the Lord
[1:03:59] now because she calls herself because
[1:04:03] she's called mother harlot so revelation
[1:04:05] 17 she's a mother of harlots and then
[1:04:07] the Catholic Church in their own book
[1:04:09] says they're the mother church Jesus
[1:04:12] calls her mother
[1:04:13] Jesus causes mother Jezebel in
[1:04:15] Revelation 220s let's read that again I
[1:04:17] know we preach down the church agent
[1:04:19] let's go to revelation 2:20 Jesus calls
[1:04:23] out this mother again and gives her a
[1:04:25] name she's called Jezebel there's got a
[1:04:29] lot of names done she's got mother
[1:04:30] harlot Mystery Babylon and here in
[1:04:34] revelation 2 Jesus calls her Jezebel
[1:04:37] because she's we're told that she has
[1:04:41] daughters revelation 2:20 this is in the
[1:04:44] authority of church age the darkest of
[1:04:46] all church ages we have the most
[1:04:48] deceptive but this is the darkest verse
[1:04:50] 20 notwithstanding I have a few things
[1:04:52] against thee because thou sufferest that
[1:04:54] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[1:04:56] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[1:04:59] servants to commit fornication and to
[1:05:00] eat things psycho sacrifice unto idols
[1:05:03] and I gave her space to repent of her
[1:05:05] fornication she repented not behold I
[1:05:08] will cast her into bed with them that
[1:05:09] commit adultery with her into Great
[1:05:10] Tribulation except they repent of their
[1:05:13] deeds and I will kill her children so
[1:05:16] now we have Jezebel as a mother with
[1:05:19] children exactly right with death
[1:05:25] and all the churches shall know that I'm
[1:05:27] he would searches the reins of the
[1:05:28] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[1:05:31] you according to your works ok children
[1:05:36] can everybody see that there that there
[1:05:39] Jesus names a mother's name and it's
[1:05:41] Jezebel and she's got daughters so there
[1:05:47] can't be two different churches there's
[1:05:49] only one false church right and she's
[1:05:51] the mother church right now this is
[1:05:58] quite striking let's go to a few
[1:06:03] scriptures here let's go to Ezekiel 16
[1:06:06] 44 oh we were just there yeah does he
[1:06:08] kill 16:44 let's read that but there and
[1:06:19] you want to read that for us when you
[1:06:20] get there brother he goes 16:44 now
[1:06:23] here's a great proverb that fits Jezebel
[1:06:27] and her daughters whatever you ready
[1:06:28] brother
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:37] amen
[1:06:39] now this works good for godly women but
[1:06:41] it also works for evil women like
[1:06:43] Jezebel and I'm so thankful my children
[1:06:47] my daughter's got a wonderful mother I'm
[1:06:49] so thankful Naomi had a great mother
[1:06:51] over there sister Beatrice because as
[1:06:55] the mother is so is the daughters and
[1:06:57] the church said right now this is
[1:07:00] speaking of Jerusalem and Samaria
[1:07:02] Jerusalem the mother Samaria the
[1:07:04] daughter they both went a whoring after
[1:07:06] other idols right but this can be used
[1:07:10] in a good way to write with natural
[1:07:13] Gauley mothers that train their
[1:07:15] daughters to serve the Lord but
[1:07:17] concerning Jezebel she had an awful
[1:07:21] daughter named Athaliah I'm sorry Ethel
[1:07:24] Ethel ayah so let's turn there let's
[1:07:27] just read one scripture about her it's
[1:07:29] in second Kings 11:1 let's read that
[1:07:31] same Kings 11:1 and we
[1:07:36] she was an evil woman we know that she
[1:07:41] once her husband died she took over the
[1:07:45] kingdom and she tried to kill all the
[1:07:50] male's that could take her spot except
[1:07:52] the godly people found a little baby
[1:07:54] right they found that little boy I
[1:07:55] forget his name now but they hid him
[1:07:57] away so she couldn't kill so God never
[1:08:00] left himself without a witness praise
[1:08:02] God amen then when he come of age I
[1:08:04] think it was in the seventh year I think
[1:08:06] it was seven years old they came out in
[1:08:08] the seventh year which is a type of this
[1:08:10] church ages right and he comes out and
[1:08:12] they they kill Ethel ayah and they put
[1:08:15] the man the holy seed the godly seed
[1:08:18] they put the man back on the throw amen
[1:08:20] a type of the church so second Kings 11
[1:08:25] and it was verse 1 oh yeah we got it
[1:08:28] right up there I'll just read that up
[1:08:30] there sorry got this and when after why
[1:08:34] the mother of as I has ayah saw that her
[1:08:37] son was dead she arose and destroyed all
[1:08:39] the seed royal so we know Jezebel was a
[1:08:43] murderer and look her daughter does the
[1:08:46] same thing amen remember the Bible said
[1:08:51] I think Jezebel killed 400 or 500 Hebrew
[1:08:54] prophets was it it was a whole bunch and
[1:08:57] of course nabe off for his vineyard you
[1:09:01] know she had him killed
[1:09:02] deceitfully so she was a murderer to the
[1:09:06] core now Jezebel was a murderer just
[1:09:09] like the Roman Catholic Church in their
[1:09:11] Wars and their inquisitions oh there's a
[1:09:15] great parallel Jezebel in the Catholic
[1:09:17] Church both did the same things they
[1:09:19] both had death their murders
[1:09:21] they're both I doubters and they both
[1:09:24] have sexual abuse sexual immorality amen
[1:09:29] Jezebel killed the Roman Catholic Church
[1:09:32] had Wars and inquisitions Jezebel wasn't
[1:09:35] I doubt her she built had a have build
[1:09:37] all these houses and what does the Roman
[1:09:39] Catholic Church do they have what's
[1:09:40] called the veneration of images and
[1:09:43] statues they venerate them which means
[1:09:45] honor but really they worship them right
[1:09:49] there
[1:09:50] to kiss them they're allowed to pray
[1:09:51] they think there's like a holy anointing
[1:09:53] on them so they worship them and they
[1:09:55] lay sacrifices you can see it all over
[1:09:57] their own website their own YouTube
[1:09:59] channel if you want they have it all
[1:10:01] over there so they death murderers
[1:10:05] idolaters the sex the third thing was
[1:10:07] sexual immorality the Bible said Jezebel
[1:10:11] caused people to commit whoredoms so we
[1:10:13] don't know she was involved with the
[1:10:16] whoredoms or she just let people do it
[1:10:19] but we know this the Roman Catholic
[1:10:21] Church is guilty of millions of sexual
[1:10:25] abuse cases with the the men clergy but
[1:10:29] also the nuns now that's starting to
[1:10:31] come out too those nuns are doing just
[1:10:33] as evil things as the men so do you see
[1:10:36] that how the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:10:38] perfectly parallel to Jezebel does
[1:10:40] everybody see that
[1:10:41] idolatry murders sexual immorality and
[1:10:45] every be every word be established in
[1:10:48] the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:10:49] there it is right there
[1:10:50] Amen that's right now every church is an
[1:11:01] every Church that supports the mother
[1:11:03] harlot and doesn't speak out against her
[1:11:06] is a daughter of her right because who
[1:11:09] how can two walk together except there
[1:11:11] be agreed now I'll be friends with
[1:11:13] Catholics I'll say this like brother Ram
[1:11:15] my brother may have said he believed
[1:11:17] Catholic people could be saved but for
[1:11:19] us to say all they're they're all good
[1:11:21] people the systems are good people to
[1:11:24] say that the system is a good system to
[1:11:26] say that is a lie and to compromise
[1:11:29] against God's Word the reason people
[1:11:33] don't attack the Roman Catholic Church
[1:11:36] like they ought to is because of the
[1:11:38] Trinity doctrine right which is a great
[1:11:40] lie and program said there are that the
[1:11:42] other thing is communion they try to say
[1:11:46] well it's okay as long as they're having
[1:11:47] communion but remember they they they
[1:11:51] change the bullet the wine into literal
[1:11:54] blood and they change the bread and the
[1:11:57] literal body of Christ and that's what
[1:11:59] the word mass means sacrifice so every
[1:12:01] time they have communion it's
[1:12:03] like there there on Golgotha right maybe
[1:12:08] you didn't know that chair but that's
[1:12:09] what they believe every time they take
[1:12:10] the mass and the wafer and they drink it
[1:12:12] it's like they're at gal Gotha right
[1:12:14] there that's how real they say communion
[1:12:21] is that it's like Jesus is crucified
[1:12:23] again and so that's wrong that's not the
[1:12:28] Bible said he was crucified once and for
[1:12:30] all amen
[1:12:31] not every time Amen but once it fell
[1:12:33] praise God
[1:12:34] not every time they have you know their
[1:12:37] communion so see the mother has traded
[1:12:43] the word for Creed's and any church that
[1:12:47] does the same thing trades the words for
[1:12:49] Creed's and and and loves the mother and
[1:12:52] submits the mother is guilty of partaken
[1:12:55] of the same thing she's guilty of
[1:12:58] because of proverbs 17:15 that he pulled
[1:13:01] up there proverbs 17:15 and people say
[1:13:06] well you know every church has has
[1:13:09] hypocrites and you know we shouldn't
[1:13:10] judge the Catholic Church listen we
[1:13:13] should judge the church we should not
[1:13:14] condemn the people though because the
[1:13:17] people can be saved
[1:13:18] but the church can never be redeemed
[1:13:20] because Christ gave her space to repent
[1:13:22] and she repented not Amen see that the
[1:13:25] people there's some people that can be
[1:13:27] saved but the church cannot she's the
[1:13:30] mother of harlots she already turned her
[1:13:31] back she'll never be saved she's right
[1:13:33] for judgment look here see he that
[1:13:37] justifies the wicked to justify the
[1:13:39] Catholic Church to say well that church
[1:13:41] is going to come back and have revival
[1:13:42] it's impossible and he that condemneth
[1:13:45] that just even they're both an
[1:13:47] abomination to the Lord so see to
[1:13:50] justify and say well well you know Jesse
[1:13:52] your church has sinners in it too you
[1:13:54] know you shouldn't condemn the Catholic
[1:13:55] Church no we don't we've got the Bible
[1:13:58] say we passed now one way yes but
[1:14:00] another way no in our in our bodies we
[1:14:02] have sinned but in our souls we know
[1:14:04] they men because the soul the Bible said
[1:14:08] the soul has no more sin the Bible said
[1:14:10] the soul cannot see a name ahead oh yeah
[1:14:14] that's what the word of god says this
[1:14:17] eat of God cannot sit anymore amen
[1:14:20] so see we're not we have a part of us
[1:14:22] that doesn't sin anymore those churches
[1:14:25] don't have that because they can't be
[1:14:27] born again and remain in a dead church
[1:14:29] if you're born again and you've got life
[1:14:31] you've got to go to a place where you're
[1:14:33] getting life amen
[1:14:35] you'll die if you don't get fed the Word
[1:14:37] of God so it's impossible to be born
[1:14:39] again and stay in the denomination
[1:14:41] because there's no life there
[1:14:43] there's only life in the message of the
[1:14:45] hour amen see to justify that that woman
[1:14:51] is a she's a nice woman
[1:14:52] well she's done they have food pantries
[1:14:55] every weekend and they do nice things
[1:14:56] that that's fine it's good to feed the
[1:14:58] poor but the systems did the systems of
[1:15:01] the modern-day Jezebel she's guilty
[1:15:04] she'll never come back and we should say
[1:15:06] come out of her my people alright number
[1:15:10] four the Catholic Church sits on many
[1:15:13] waters and I said this earlier but let's
[1:15:16] go to Revelation 17 15 so I only done
[1:15:21] three proofs so far and Jerusalem can't
[1:15:24] meet this root three requirements
[1:15:26] neither can Istanbul Turkey
[1:15:29] neither can Albin II New York like we
[1:15:31] saw last week none of them can meet
[1:15:33] these requirements there's only one
[1:15:35] place in the world that meets the
[1:15:37] requirements in its Rome now and he said
[1:15:42] to me the waters which thou sawest where
[1:15:43] the sitteth are multitudes
[1:15:44] people's multitudes nations and tongues
[1:15:50] now here's recent data that I found
[1:15:52] online there's 1.3 billion Catholics
[1:15:57] that's almost 20% of the world's entire
[1:16:00] population so almost one out of five
[1:16:03] people are Roman Catholic in this earth
[1:16:05] one out of five
[1:16:07] now that's one that's one thousand three
[1:16:12] hundred million people that's 1.3
[1:16:15] billion they have nearly
[1:16:19] a quarter million parishes worldwide
[1:16:21] that's a lot of churches they built so
[1:16:24] see just building a church doesn't make
[1:16:25] you save the false church builds you
[1:16:27] know the false church builds churches or
[1:16:29] we're building churches that's good but
[1:16:31] that don't mean you're saved anybody can
[1:16:33] do that
[1:16:35] they have parishes in nearly every
[1:16:37] country on the earth and nearly every
[1:16:40] nation has diplomatic or other political
[1:16:42] relations with the Holy See the number
[1:16:47] of Catholics is greater than that of
[1:16:48] nearly all other religious traditions
[1:16:50] there are more Roman Catholics than all
[1:16:52] other Christians combined and more Roman
[1:16:55] Catholics than all Buddhists or Hindus
[1:16:58] the only thing that's even close is
[1:17:00] Muslims and they're they're going to
[1:17:02] catch up pretty soon because they have
[1:17:04] so many children and then of course
[1:17:05] Christians don't well I shouldn't say
[1:17:06] Christians I should say denominational
[1:17:08] churches don't because they don't
[1:17:10] believe in fulfilling the Word of God
[1:17:12] that's true all right now the two
[1:17:20] largest Protestant churches are Anglican
[1:17:22] and Methodists and they both have eighty
[1:17:25] million members approximately so eighty
[1:17:29] million is nothing compared to 1.3
[1:17:31] billion okay billion so eighty is
[1:17:37] nowhere eighties not even close to a
[1:17:40] thousand right 80s like eight percent of
[1:17:45] a thousand so it's not even close
[1:17:48] I mean to sign me close when you put
[1:17:50] Protestants next to Catholics it's not
[1:17:52] even close okay so can everybody see
[1:17:56] that that the Roman Catholic Church sits
[1:17:57] on many waters okay yeah Bri see that
[1:18:01] all right number five the Catholic
[1:18:04] Church sits on seven mountains or Hills
[1:18:07] now it's in revelation 17 nine if you
[1:18:10] got your Bible revelation seventeen nine
[1:18:18] they didn't even pull up there thank you
[1:18:21] and here is the mind which hath wisdom
[1:18:23] the seven heads are seven mountains on
[1:18:25] which the woman sitteth
[1:18:33] now by God's grace let me pull this up
[1:18:36] here real quick I can list the names of
[1:18:37] them yeah I got all the seven names you
[1:18:45] probably not familiar with any of them
[1:18:46] Aventine sealian Palatine s Quillin
[1:18:51] Capitoline women'll and Carr quieren all
[1:18:56] Hill and these seven hills are only five
[1:18:59] miles from the Vatican Toki if you take
[1:19:03] a if you took a worldwide perspective
[1:19:05] the Seven Hills are really close to the
[1:19:08] Vatican right so this woman sits on
[1:19:12] seven mountains or Hills she's right
[1:19:14] there really close to it it can only be
[1:19:17] the city of Rome yeah five miles and
[1:19:27] remember Istanbul Turkey has seven hills
[1:19:30] as well it's religious majority are
[1:19:34] Muslim the second largest religion in
[1:19:36] the world but Istanbul's not the
[1:19:39] headquarters or the mother city of Islam
[1:19:41] that goes to Mecca and that's been
[1:19:44] proven just that's proven just by
[1:19:45] general fact Mecca is the mother city of
[1:19:48] Islam not assemble okay that's number
[1:19:52] five now we're gonna move a little
[1:19:53] faster number six the Catholic Church is
[1:19:56] a harlot or a to Christ now here's
[1:20:00] what the word means one who yields
[1:20:03] herself to defilement for the sake of
[1:20:05] gain and so this church has two very
[1:20:12] evils defilement for gain and idolatry
[1:20:17] so it has those two things so the
[1:20:21] Catholic Church spreads their church for
[1:20:23] gain they're trying to make money right
[1:20:26] and they're trying to increase idolatry
[1:20:30] rather than true worship all right now
[1:20:37] let's show this let's go to Romans seven
[1:20:39] for that you don't need to read this -
[1:20:41] and this would be a good reminder for us
[1:20:42] adults that note it because I haven't
[1:20:44] preached on Romans seven for a long time
[1:20:46] it's like a marriage and divorce
[1:20:48] Scripture so children here's why the
[1:20:56] Catholic Church will be judged as an
[1:20:58] unfaithful wife because anyone who takes
[1:21:02] the name of Jesus claims to be married
[1:21:04] to Jesus
[1:21:05] whether it's Catholic Lutheran Methodist
[1:21:08] Protestant whatever anyone who says I'm
[1:21:11] a Christian I believe in Christ you
[1:21:14] whoever says that is claiming to be
[1:21:16] married to Christ because they're a part
[1:21:19] of the church and we saw a church as a
[1:21:21] woman Christ is the bridegroom and the
[1:21:24] church is the bride all right now
[1:21:28] wherefore my brethren you also become
[1:21:30] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[1:21:32] that you should be married to another
[1:21:34] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:21:39] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:21:41] God amen glory the scene before we
[1:21:45] became filled with the Holy Ghost we
[1:21:47] were married we're married to the law of
[1:21:49] sin and death
[1:21:49] is that right you're married to it she
[1:21:53] used to obey I used to obey it by the
[1:21:55] custom and by the addictions and by the
[1:21:57] the bad pictures and the bad movies I
[1:21:59] used to obey that I used to be married
[1:22:01] to it I was tied to it but Jesus
[1:22:03] divorced me from that Amen hallelujah
[1:22:05] those chains have been broken you know
[1:22:08] the divorce papers have been signed amen
[1:22:12] I'm divorced from sin and death and I'm
[1:22:14] married to Jesus Christ the word see
[1:22:18] that's what the word says
[1:22:19] so Malachi you need to be married to
[1:22:21] another to Christ case Yun Haven and
[1:22:24] cares and virtue and sorry nature sorry
[1:22:32] all those names my fault everyone you're
[1:22:36] married to Jesus Christ when you say how
[1:22:40] would it be a new creature I'm baptized
[1:22:42] and I'm going to serve guys you become
[1:22:44] married to Christ now you're married now
[1:22:47] you got to be true to your husband so
[1:22:50] this is how the Catholic Church can be a
[1:22:51] because they take the name of
[1:22:54] Christ within they make love with idols
[1:22:57] with evil spirits right doctrines of
[1:22:59] devils the Bible said claiming to
[1:23:03] believe this book claiming to love this
[1:23:05] book when tell their members well don't
[1:23:07] go don't go too crazy with it right
[1:23:09] don't read it too much don't become like
[1:23:11] brother Ray was telling us a few weeks
[1:23:13] ago remember he was Catholic but they
[1:23:15] said well if you read it don't become
[1:23:17] like crazy like those fanatics they said
[1:23:21] oh they said just listen to your priest
[1:23:22] mostly they said you can read it but
[1:23:24] just don't go crazy like those fanatics
[1:23:26] in the front that he's talked about the
[1:23:27] Protestants that's what he was told as a
[1:23:30] child in the Catholic Church you can
[1:23:32] read it but don't become one of those
[1:23:33] fat fanatics
[1:23:34] I'm glad to be a fanatic for Christ amen
[1:23:36] you're gonna be a fanatic for somebody
[1:23:39] let's be a fanatic for Jesus amen let's
[1:23:41] go all the way for Christ to see Romans
[1:23:47] seven says you got to be married to
[1:23:49] Jesus Christ
[1:23:55] alright I'm looking at a few scriptures
[1:23:58] here that we could read see which ones
[1:24:00] you might want to read yeah let's just
[1:24:04] go and read this Lydia Pope John 13 I'm
[1:24:06] sorry John 15:3 now this is after Judas
[1:24:12] had already got filled with Satan and he
[1:24:15] left in chapter 13 now Jesus is
[1:24:18] preaching them he said now you are clean
[1:24:21] so Judas is there so Judas can't be
[1:24:23] clean through the word which I've spoken
[1:24:26] to you and it just struck me right now
[1:24:28] see the only way to be clean is to stay
[1:24:31] with the word Judas walked for a long
[1:24:34] time but not long enough when he left
[1:24:36] the word he's no longer clean only the
[1:24:39] people that stay with the Lord all their
[1:24:41] lives are gonna be clean in a glory just
[1:24:44] struck me like that see he's already
[1:24:46] left in 3rd chapter 13 he's not there
[1:24:48] anymore they're there singing hymns or
[1:24:50] making their way out to you know guess
[1:24:52] M&E but you're only clean so a wife to
[1:24:56] Jesus will only be clean through the
[1:24:59] current spoken word amen hallelujah
[1:25:01] that's what we've got the spoken word
[1:25:04] the original seed of God's Word amen
[1:25:08] thank your order we can be clean we can
[1:25:11] be a clean Church amen if we stay with
[1:25:13] God's Word hallelujah that's why it's so
[1:25:19] important but the Roman Catholic Church
[1:25:23] has received the wrong seed or false
[1:25:27] teachings of Satan and then share those
[1:25:31] lies with the peoples from nearly every
[1:25:34] nation the Bible said in verse 17 verse
[1:25:38] 2 ladypau 17 to Revelation 17 - she
[1:25:42] commits fornication with the kings of
[1:25:44] the nations of the earth and she does
[1:25:48] this by pleasing the governments and
[1:25:51] people rather than pleasing her husband
[1:25:54] Christ the word okay so we got that can
[1:25:58] every see that the kings of the earth so
[1:26:01] the Catholic Church goes in the
[1:26:02] countries and they say things that
[1:26:05] please the earth the kings of the earth
[1:26:06] remember I showed you a few weeks ago
[1:26:09] well I told you about
[1:26:11] the Pope kissing the feet of those
[1:26:13] leaders from Africa I forget their name
[1:26:21] yeah I pulled up here real quick as
[1:26:24] Sudan yeah Sudan North and Southern
[1:26:26] Sudan yeah all she got to do is like it
[1:26:31] here's a quick picture kind of hard to
[1:26:36] see there but the Pope kissed their feet
[1:26:39] come on the Pope kissed their feet did
[1:26:42] you see that a couple of weeks ago see
[1:26:45] the Pope the Pope goes into their
[1:26:47] country and he kisses their feet he
[1:26:51] pleases them that's him kissing the feet
[1:26:53] of the the Sudan Kings because they stop
[1:26:56] their civil war so he goes in there and
[1:26:59] he and he basically flatters them right
[1:27:02] he kisses their feet and the Bible said
[1:27:04] don't fall down and worship any man's
[1:27:06] feet right amen
[1:27:09] don't worship any man right where's him
[1:27:12] Christ now I mentioned this a few months
[1:27:15] ago too but I'm gonna say it again when
[1:27:17] the Pope vis the United States in
[1:27:19] September 2015 he addressed Congress and
[1:27:22] he called for cooperation unity and
[1:27:26] peace but he never rebuked the nation
[1:27:28] for all the murders of abortion that
[1:27:30] they've been doing he rebuked the he
[1:27:34] rebuked the country more for not let me
[1:27:40] say it I want to read it exactly I want
[1:27:43] to read it the right way oh for clim
[1:27:47] change he rebuked America because we're
[1:27:50] not making greater sense for climate
[1:27:52] change and he he left out all the 54
[1:27:55] million abortions that have been done in
[1:27:57] this country which you're probably more
[1:28:00] than that Steve he's pleasing the kings
[1:28:04] of the earth 54 million but don't you
[1:28:08] know the Bible says the blood of Abel
[1:28:10] cried from the ground up to heaven
[1:28:13] and if that was just one man what about
[1:28:15] 54 million voices crying up to heaven
[1:28:18] right and they're all crying up there to
[1:28:23] say God have mercy and the Pope just
[1:28:24] comes in and says you need to do a
[1:28:26] better job with your with your exhausts
[1:28:29] coming out of your car you need to do
[1:28:32] more recycling and yet all these voices
[1:28:34] are crying up to heaven mercy on a
[1:28:37] revenge on blood and you know Jesus is
[1:28:40] going to avenge their blood amen
[1:28:41] this nation is going to be judged all
[1:28:44] these tornadoes and floods and
[1:28:46] earthquakes it's God's judgment against
[1:28:48] this nation so all those millions of
[1:28:51] voices going up there but you had this
[1:28:52] Pope what does he do he commits
[1:28:55] fornication with the kings of the earth
[1:28:57] did you know when he came there was
[1:29:01] eleven thousand people in lined up on
[1:29:05] the streets by the White House and they
[1:29:07] hired trumpeters to Trump it and they
[1:29:10] had they hired a course of people to
[1:29:12] sing out a man as he passed the but the
[1:29:15] the article said they had a course of
[1:29:17] amens as the Pope drove by coming to the
[1:29:21] White House see heaven is trumpeting for
[1:29:26] him and I'm sorry earth is trumpeting
[1:29:29] and saying amen for him but heaven is
[1:29:31] condemning him because he won't stand
[1:29:34] for God's Word because they're
[1:29:36] committing fornication with the Obamas
[1:29:39] or if the trumps near the Trump's or the
[1:29:42] Bush family whoever it is if they
[1:29:45] compromise on God's Word they're
[1:29:47] committing fornication right now God can
[1:29:50] forgive it
[1:29:50] thank God he can forgive but when we
[1:29:53] repent we got to have fruits worthy of
[1:29:55] repentance and so we all need amen
[1:30:02] fifty-four million voices crying to God
[1:30:07] but how does he come in like a wolf in
[1:30:10] sheep's clothing
[1:30:12] my goodness now let me close with this
[1:30:15] I'm just gonna close with these last few
[1:30:16] things
[1:30:17] I'll give me ten minutes hear me closest
[1:30:25] false doctrine is like unto bad seat
[1:30:29] right because remember way in the
[1:30:31] parable Jesus told the good Soler's of
[1:30:33] son of man he's so good seat but then
[1:30:36] the the saying came around so bad seed
[1:30:38] right so false doctrine is like bad seed
[1:30:42] and so this church spreads her wrong see
[1:30:46] she's friends she spreads her false
[1:30:48] converts around the world with false
[1:30:51] doctrine now I'm gonna go through a list
[1:30:54] let me see one two three four five six
[1:30:58] seven let me I'll close of these just
[1:31:00] last seven quick points so here's some
[1:31:07] of the false doctrine she spreads around
[1:31:08] just seven quick things that you can all
[1:31:10] see how evil it is the first one is
[1:31:13] mandatory clerical celibacy which means
[1:31:16] priests are not allowed to marry and
[1:31:19] look what this has caused sexual abuse
[1:31:22] and they get that because they say well
[1:31:27] like Jesus and Paul you know Catholic
[1:31:30] Catholic men should be more they should
[1:31:32] have free from distractions so they can
[1:31:34] serve God
[1:31:35] but the Bible says a bishop must rule
[1:31:37] his own house and his children before he
[1:31:40] can rule the house of God amen now
[1:31:43] really what the church is trying to
[1:31:45] they're trying to save money so that
[1:31:46] they don't have to pay the preacher and
[1:31:48] feed his children - that's what they're
[1:31:49] trying to do right that's and that's
[1:31:52] what videos
[1:31:53] that's what news videos say when these
[1:31:57] when these abuse victims come and they
[1:31:59] and they they expose the Catholic Church
[1:32:02] that's what they say I've seen that I've
[1:32:03] seen that on their own videos That's not
[1:32:05] me that's what they're saying the reason
[1:32:08] they don't want these men to marry is so
[1:32:10] that the church does have to feed the
[1:32:11] mouse of those children that's what
[1:32:14] that's what they say
[1:32:15] so they could have more money for the
[1:32:16] Roman Catholic Church shame on them
[1:32:19] that's an evil doctrine that's a
[1:32:22] doctrine of devils the Bible said that's
[1:32:24] a seducing spirit and a doctrine of
[1:32:26] devils and it's led to this sex abuse
[1:32:30] epidemic through this false doctrine
[1:32:33] that's right now every now and then
[1:32:36] Church you'll have a man who's really
[1:32:37] strong and anointed and can be celibate
[1:32:40] you know there's a few around the
[1:32:41] message that they never get married and
[1:32:42] they're strong for God they can serve
[1:32:44] God that way and God bless them for that
[1:32:46] st. Paul said I wish you were all like
[1:32:49] me but if we're all like him there'd be
[1:32:51] fewer Christian converts right there be
[1:32:54] surely less pastors we'd have no home
[1:32:57] churches because the pastor asked the
[1:32:59] rulers own children first before he can
[1:33:01] rule the house of God second was the one
[1:33:03] I told you transubstantiation it teaches
[1:33:07] the bread and wine are the literal
[1:33:08] substance of the body and blood of Jesus
[1:33:11] Christ
[1:33:12] this is idolatry this exalts the bread
[1:33:19] and the wine into deity can you imagine
[1:33:21] that it's like this right here if we're
[1:33:25] at the Catholic Church this would change
[1:33:27] into deity this is God now come here and
[1:33:31] drink God is what they'd say that's what
[1:33:33] they're saying
[1:33:33] drink God like it's some natural real
[1:33:37] thing but we know when we drink in the
[1:33:39] anointing or when we drink in God's Word
[1:33:41] that's DNA coming at us amen see how
[1:33:45] close it is it's so close but it would
[1:33:47] not deceive the elect because the elect
[1:33:49] be deceived amen
[1:33:51] see they're saying drink this eternal
[1:33:54] life but that's what we do every service
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:57] a fresh anointing and we're drinking in
[1:33:59] the living waters of God amen
[1:34:01] see it's such a closed thing but it's so
[1:34:04] perverted at the same time the Bible
[1:34:09] calls
[1:34:09] the cup of blessing aren't you glad for
[1:34:11] the blessing we get just just in the
[1:34:13] natural cup it's symbolic it's not a it
[1:34:17] but we do get a blessing by doing that
[1:34:20] now number three is the Pope office and
[1:34:24] the the Holy Father title now if Pope
[1:34:27] means father and Latin if you didn't
[1:34:29] know that Pope means father in Latin but
[1:34:34] the bottle said the five preaching
[1:34:35] officers Pope's not in there it's
[1:34:37] possible prophet teacher pastor
[1:34:38] evangelist there's no father in there
[1:34:42] jesus said call no man father in matthew
[1:34:45] 23:9
[1:34:49] but paul said there would be some
[1:34:51] preachers that were like a father to you
[1:34:54] because he described his relationship
[1:34:56] with timothy as a son with a father and
[1:34:58] he claimed the corinthians were begotten
[1:35:00] to christ through the gospel which paul
[1:35:02] preached and paul said you have many
[1:35:04] teachers but not many fathers so you can
[1:35:07] have a father figure someone that
[1:35:09] preached the message the first time you
[1:35:10] heard it you've heard it you were born
[1:35:12] again of the Holy Ghost so Mel Brooks is
[1:35:14] like a father figure to me
[1:35:16] well I don't call him Holy Father we
[1:35:18] come preach for his Holy Father you can
[1:35:20] you dedicate my children Holy Father can
[1:35:22] I kiss your feet I never call him father
[1:35:25] because the Bible says have call no man
[1:35:26] father but you can look to someone as a
[1:35:29] father who's preached the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:31] you got saved and filled the Holy Ghost
[1:35:35] so when they call the Pope the Holy
[1:35:38] Father it's a complete robbery of God
[1:35:41] the father's title in John 17:11 Lydia
[1:35:44] pulling up there John 17:11 the title
[1:35:47] Holy Fathers used one time in the Bible
[1:35:49] and the Roman Catholic Church steals the
[1:35:52] title from God and gives it to a man how
[1:35:56] wicked is that its total idolatry Jesus
[1:36:01] says Holy Father keep through thy no
[1:36:03] name those whom thou has given me that
[1:36:05] they may be one as we are so the
[1:36:08] Catholic Church is so arrogant that they
[1:36:10] take a title that belongs only to God
[1:36:12] and they give it to the man and you saw
[1:36:15] Barack Obama could called him Holy
[1:36:16] Father I don't know if Trump did or not
[1:36:18] but Barack Obama called him Holy Father
[1:36:20] that's idolatry that's
[1:36:22] to me to take a name that belongs to God
[1:36:26] and give it to a man that's blasphemy
[1:36:31] because that's God's name Jesus said
[1:36:34] Holy Father see and so the Catholic
[1:36:39] Church as a woman takes this false word
[1:36:42] and she spreads it to this country and
[1:36:44] now every every every president every
[1:36:46] tyre says Holy Father Holy Father Holy
[1:36:49] Father and they're blaspheming the name
[1:36:51] of Jesus Christ okay number five
[1:36:55] I'm sorry number five before kissing a
[1:36:59] Pope's ring or priests and I'm bowing to
[1:37:02] a pope or priest this is wrong
[1:37:09] recently it was in the news the Pope
[1:37:11] someone tried to kiss his ring and you
[1:37:13] know what he did he turned it away he
[1:37:15] said because so many people had kissed
[1:37:17] it that he said their germs were on
[1:37:18] there and he said it was flu season so
[1:37:20] he and he got he got he got a bunch of
[1:37:21] flack for that Oh Holy Father why would
[1:37:24] you turn your ring away and he's like I
[1:37:27] don't want you to get sick well if
[1:37:29] you're so holy how can there be even
[1:37:30] meat germs there doesn't your holiness
[1:37:32] burn those germs away see and then the
[1:37:36] article says they've been kissing his
[1:37:38] ring and kissing his feet for centuries
[1:37:41] everybody knows this and it's idolatry
[1:37:44] it's man worship it's a forerunner to
[1:37:46] the Anti Christ the Bible teaches do not
[1:37:51] bow to any man in Exodus 20 verse 5
[1:37:55] revelation 19:10 in revelation 22 8 and
[1:37:58] 9 or never kiss any man's hand according
[1:38:01] to 2nd Samuel 15 5 do not kiss a man's
[1:38:04] hand this is man worship and it breaks
[1:38:07] the first commandment all right let's
[1:38:09] say into our feet let me close to these
[1:38:10] last few the fifth one
[1:38:15] his veneration of statues and images
[1:38:17] already kind of went over that one the
[1:38:24] Bible said
[1:38:25] no make no graven image or likeness that
[1:38:29] is in heaven or earth in the water and I
[1:38:34] and Rome is the chief global seat of
[1:38:36] idolatry spread through the worship of
[1:38:38] statues and images let me do two more
[1:38:44] number six the communion of saints the
[1:38:48] Catholic Church says there is an
[1:38:50] exchange of spiritual goods through
[1:38:52] prayers between the disciples currently
[1:38:54] on earth and those that are in glory so
[1:38:57] the Catholic Church says you can pray to
[1:38:58] disciples in heaven and that's called
[1:39:02] the communion of saints and they're
[1:39:06] supposed to pray that they may be loosed
[1:39:09] from their sins but the Bible said Jesus
[1:39:13] blood already forgives all of our
[1:39:16] trespasses right now amen
[1:39:18] so they're praying to people to forgive
[1:39:22] their sins when the Bible said it's
[1:39:24] already forgiven the Catechism says that
[1:39:29] believers should fly to Mary in prayer
[1:39:33] and request prayer from her but nowhere
[1:39:40] does the Bible ever teach that this is a
[1:39:44] form of spiritualism so if they're not
[1:39:46] contacting Mary
[1:39:47] if you can't pray to Mary and if you
[1:39:49] can't pray to disciples and who they
[1:39:51] contacting they're contacting demons
[1:39:54] which brother Graham said is the highest
[1:39:56] form of spiritualism is praying to dead
[1:39:59] people because you're not you're not
[1:40:01] contacting dead people you're actually
[1:40:03] contacting demon powers that are
[1:40:06] disguising themselves as dead people so
[1:40:10] yeah it's it's very serious and this is
[1:40:15] what she's spreading he's spreading this
[1:40:16] to all these nations these nations the
[1:40:21] last one this is kind of what we
[1:40:23] I can come here and start playing the
[1:40:27] last one is deifying the Virgin Mary
[1:40:29] let me quote they call Mary the all holy
[1:40:32] one that's what they call in their book
[1:40:33] all holy one know only God's holy only
[1:40:38] Jesus is all holy they say Mary was
[1:40:43] preserved from all stain of original sin
[1:40:45] you know that's not true either the
[1:40:49] Bible said that Mary rejoiced in God my
[1:40:52] Savior if she was all holy she doesn't
[1:40:55] need a Savior but she needed a Savior
[1:40:57] amen hallelujah
[1:40:59] she rejoices that thank you God you're
[1:41:02] my Savior I had to be saved for my sins
[1:41:06] no not true she's not the all Holy One
[1:41:11] she was not a preserved from the stain
[1:41:15] of original sin like the Catholic Church
[1:41:19] says was she forgiven of all of her sins
[1:41:22] yes by the blood of Jesus that's right
[1:41:29] when they looked into heaven heaven in
[1:41:31] Revelation 5 they said who's worthy to
[1:41:33] loose the seals that Mary come up and
[1:41:35] say I'm worthy now the virus that no man
[1:41:39] was found in heaven or earth through the
[1:41:41] sea or under the seat the woman was
[1:41:43] found anywhere only Jesus was found
[1:41:45] there's only one worthy not Mary Jesus
[1:41:49] Christ the Catholic Church says she has
[1:41:54] a saving office she's the mother of God
[1:41:57] Queen over all things advocate help her
[1:41:59] benefactors and Mediatrix but the bible
[1:42:02] says in isaiah 40:3 God is the only
[1:42:05] Savior amen and the Eternal Spirit of
[1:42:11] God has no mother the Bible says that
[1:42:14] clearly in Hebrews 7 verse 3
[1:42:17] without father without mother ain't had
[1:42:20] an area
[1:42:23] my goodness Mary was only the mother to
[1:42:28] the human body that human body program
[1:42:31] says and we know the Bible says that
[1:42:32] human body wasn't iya T it could die it
[1:42:36] could get tired if you get sick but the
[1:42:38] sphere that came and gone that body was
[1:42:41] deity amen and Jesus Christ is the only
[1:42:47] mediator between God and men now do you
[1:42:51] like that church we got through six of
[1:42:53] the eleven proofs the next week Lord
[1:42:55] willing we'll get all the way and
