[0:01] all right thank
[0:08] you praise God praise God 2 Chronicles
[0:11] 16:7 then we'll read Hebrews 10:35 thank
[0:14] you casa great job already on the
[0:15] computer right on top of everything
[0:17] thank
[0:21] you so last time we looked at uh King
[0:25] abijah and how King abijah relied upon
[0:28] the
[0:28] Lord and God honored him for relying on
[0:32] God rather than relying on man but
[0:34] here's a verse where
[0:39] um a king did not rely on God so it just
[0:43] kind of gives us the contrast and we
[0:44] want to learn uh we want to learn of
[0:47] course from abijah but I just want you
[0:48] to see here this verse here verse 7even
[0:51] I'll read this one but then we'll all
[0:52] read Hebrews 10:35 together at that time
[0:57] hananiah the Seer came to ASA king of
[1:01] Judah and said unto him because thou has
[1:02] relied on the king of Syria and not
[1:05] relied on the Lord thy God therefore is
[1:08] the host of the king of Syria escaped
[1:11] out of thine hand so we see the king
[1:13] loses uh a battle because he did not
[1:16] rely on the Lord all right now let's
[1:19] read Hebrews uh
[1:26] 10:35 Hebrews 10:35 just a wonderful
[1:30] scripture reminds us to keep our
[1:32] confidence in God that's what relying
[1:33] means relying means to have full trust
[1:35] and confidence in something or someone
[1:39] and so we want our full trust and
[1:40] confidence to be in the Lord Jesus
[1:42] Christ let's read this together ready 1
[1:45] 2 3 cast not away therefore your
[1:48] confidence which ha great recompense of
[1:51] reward may God add his Blessing to re
[1:53] his word you may be seated praise
[1:58] God
[2:01] okay so I don't have any
[2:03] uh well I guess you know I guess yeah we
[2:05] can hook up and have this kind of ready
[2:07] to
[2:08] go actually you know what let's not
[2:10] let's hold off on that I got a few
[2:11] things I'll show just a few visuals
[2:13] eventually but let's get let's go to the
[2:15] scripture here uh by the grace of the
[2:18] Lord now just in a review remember last
[2:20] time we looked at Kings rely on the Lord
[2:22] and we showed the New Testament
[2:23] scriptures how we are Kings and Priests
[2:26] unto
[2:27] God what do we Reign Over we re over sin
[2:30] we re over the sin that dwells within us
[2:32] and we re over the evil spirits the
[2:35] spiritual wickedness in high places that
[2:36] try to tempt us right to do evil we
[2:39] Reign Over that the Bible said by
[2:41] casting down uh evil imaginations right
[2:45] so when Satan comes and he brings a
[2:47] Temptation we've got to uh think about
[2:50] that and we've got to cast that down and
[2:51] say I'm not going to dwell on that I'm
[2:54] not going to accept that thought right
[2:56] what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
[2:57] my trust and put my thoughts on the word
[2:59] of God Goden Hallelujah so that makes
[3:01] you a king when you and and I say a
[3:04] queen for our sisters if that makes you
[3:05] feel uh better um when you cast down
[3:09] evil thoughts and evil ideas from the
[3:11] enemy and you're able to to reject those
[3:14] and accept the word of God you're now
[3:16] ruling over evil spirits and we know the
[3:20] Bible teaches that plainly uh by God's
[3:22] grace good to see you Brother Marlin God
[3:24] bless you sir and that teaches you know
[3:27] uh it goes along with the Bible where
[3:28] Revelation 1 vers vers six says we are
[3:31] Kings and Priests unto God so in the Old
[3:34] Testament they were Kings naturally
[3:35] right God wanted to establish uh uh you
[3:38] know all the kings of Israel you know
[3:40] Saul David and Solomon all the way down
[3:43] God wanted to establish natural Kings
[3:44] but now in the New Testament God's not
[3:47] uh trying to establish natural Kings
[3:49] although he would like Godly
[3:51] leaders um but God wants us to be
[3:53] spiritual Kings and Reign Over sin and
[3:57] the wicked one Hallelujah
[4:00] and then the Bible says we're priests
[4:02] unto God uh again in Revelation 1:6 and
[4:06] we do that according to Romans 12 by
[4:07] presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice
[4:09] that's why we've got to come to church
[4:11] that's why we've got to pray at home
[4:12] that's why we got to read our Bibles at
[4:14] home you actually have to present your
[4:16] body as a sacrifice right you have to
[4:19] choose to not do something that would be
[4:22] more easy or more
[4:23] pleasurable uh by denying pleasurable
[4:26] things and coming to church and so forth
[4:29] uh by God's grace we make our bodies a
[4:31] Living Sacrifice unto God hallelujah
[4:34] like I said on Sunday I've never seen it
[4:36] fail I've never regretted once coming to
[4:38] church because the spirit of God is here
[4:41] hallelujah it gives us strength and joy
[4:43] and victory and repentance and healing
[4:46] whatever we have need of that's what the
[4:48] Holy Spirit does it gives us what we
[4:50] have need of in that hour praise
[4:52] God and we also as priests you know we
[4:55] first got to take our bodies Away From
[4:56] Evil things and then the Bible said we
[4:59] got to to give God thanks and we got to
[5:01] offer spiritual sacrifices onto go unto
[5:03] God it's so important to sing to God to
[5:06] to say praise the Lord to say thank you
[5:09] Jesus it's so important that's part of
[5:11] our role as a spiritual priest unto God
[5:14] and also pray for other
[5:16] people intercede for other people in
[5:19] other words uh just don't pray for
[5:21] yourself all the time right that's the
[5:22] Habit bad habit we get into me me me me
[5:25] me but that that's not really a
[5:27] sacrifice a sacrifice is praying for
[5:28] other people praise God Amen and that's
[5:31] what God wants us to do intercede for
[5:34] others Hallelujah and so we saw that and
[5:37] then we saw um how you know rabom and
[5:41] Jobo uh rabom would serve God but then
[5:44] you know would fall away uh but then how
[5:47] God kept them you know because rabom
[5:49] sought God God kept them from a civil
[5:51] war right and then we ended with King
[5:55] abijah uh there was
[5:57] 800,000 of his fellow
[6:00] Israelis uh fighting against him but
[6:02] because he relied upon the Lord the Lord
[6:05] slew 500,000 of them all because he
[6:09] called out to God in his dark moments
[6:13] right amen Church we've all had dark
[6:15] moments praise God right and so uh if we
[6:18] haven't been faithful in those dark
[6:20] moments let's let's decide in our hearts
[6:22] tonight the next difficult time we have
[6:25] the next dark moment we have we're going
[6:27] to cry out to God in that moment amen
[6:29] rather than cry out to another person or
[6:31] or you know indulge in some sin or
[6:34] something like that or try to drown away
[6:36] our our our trials you know with some
[6:38] other thing but to call on God and give
[6:41] God an opportunity to save us amen give
[6:44] God an opportun opportunity to help us
[6:47] hallelujah amen that's what abijah did
[6:50] and so God honored him because he relied
[6:53] upon the Lord though surrounded by a an
[6:56] army twice the size of his army
[6:59] Hallelujah God honored him abide of
[7:01] course being Solomon's
[7:03] grandson now as I said last time I
[7:05] didn't get a chance you know to finish a
[7:07] few of these Bible kings I wanted to
[7:09] preach on because remember we can look
[7:11] at their lives and we can learn from
[7:13] their lives we can learn spiritual
[7:14] lessons from their lives amen they were
[7:17] physical
[7:18] Kings uh but we're spiritual Kings and
[7:21] so we can gain understanding Hallelujah
[7:25] and so we want to learn from that by the
[7:27] grace of
[7:28] God
[7:30] and you know while I Was preparing I
[7:31] just thought of a few simple examples of
[7:33] how Believers relied upon uh other
[7:37] things other than God but yet God was
[7:39] merciful to them right Abraham and Sarah
[7:42] relied on their own understanding of how
[7:44] can we have a son they you know they
[7:46] said well Abraham you marry Hagar that
[7:49] will produce the promised child well he
[7:51] wasn't the promised child right he he
[7:54] was a wild man the Bible said that he
[7:55] only caused trouble and they still to
[7:58] this day his descendants still cause
[7:59] trouble to Israel Israelis today they're
[8:02] the ones persecuting
[8:04] Israel um but but God forgave them right
[8:08] and God gave Abraham another chance
[8:10] hallelujah amen and God helped Abraham
[8:13] and Sarah to believe the word of God to
[8:15] rely on God even when he was 99 and she
[8:19] was 90 right right God helped them learn
[8:22] to rely on him because they were the
[8:25] friends of God and remember they were
[8:27] the friends of God because they trained
[8:30] the Bible said Abraham trained his
[8:31] household to obey the word of God and
[8:34] fulfill the word of God that's why it's
[8:36] so important train your children right
[8:38] train yourself right train your spouse
[8:40] and however however more uh train your
[8:43] household to honor the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:45] amen hallelujah and God will be your
[8:47] friend that's what the Bible says we're
[8:50] the friends of God because we're the the
[8:52] the spiritual descendants of Abraham
[8:54] because we have faith in Jesus Christ
[8:57] amen I thought of you know King numerous
[8:59] times you know he relied so much on
[9:01] himself he relied on his own timing
[9:03] remember he sacrificed right before
[9:04] Samuel got there only prophets were
[9:06] supposed to make that sacrifice but he
[9:08] intruded into the prophet's office and
[9:11] missed the timing of God therefore God
[9:13] said I'm taking the kingdom away from
[9:15] you because you didn't rely on me you
[9:17] didn't rely on my timing you didn't
[9:18] think I could I could make this happen
[9:20] in a certain
[9:22] time and he intruded into the office of
[9:26] a
[9:27] prophet and then remember at the end of
[9:29] his life he went to a witch the Bible
[9:31] said he went to the witch of Endor the
[9:32] equivalent today would be like doing the
[9:34] horoscope or going to the Ouija board
[9:36] some evil thing like that trying to
[9:38] figure out your future try to gain some
[9:41] uh some favor by going to demonic Powers
[9:44] rather than God right and the Bible said
[9:47] he didn't you know he didn't rely on the
[9:49] uraman Thum that breastplate where the
[9:51] high priest would take it before God and
[9:53] and ask God a question and if it was God
[9:55] it would Shine the lights would shine
[9:57] right and they'd know yes or no is this
[9:59] from God or not but he didn't rely upon
[10:01] God he relied upon a witch and the Bible
[10:04] said God killed him prematurely because
[10:07] of
[10:08] that and the Bible says in the New
[10:10] Testament many are SI sick and weakly
[10:13] among you and many sleep because they do
[10:15] not discern the body of the Lord that
[10:18] that means they mistreat other
[10:20] Christians and so the Bible tells us
[10:22] plain in the New Testament God will
[10:23] cause Christians to go to a premature
[10:25] death because they don't treat other
[10:27] Christians the right way God help us to
[10:29] be full of compassion praise God full of
[10:33] mercy and for forgive one another as we
[10:36] need forgiven who doesn't need forgiven
[10:38] today is there anybody that made it
[10:40] through the day without a sin no we all
[10:42] need forgiveness so Jesus says you know
[10:44] forgive us our debts as we forgive those
[10:47] who sin against us right amen amen
[10:51] hallelujah and so we see you know can
[10:54] think of many many examples of how
[10:55] people rely on other things rather than
[10:58] God but let let's be determined in our
[11:01] hearts to rely on God when we have
[11:03] difficult times
[11:05] Hallelujah because the Bible said we do
[11:07] not want to Cast Away our confidence
[11:09] think about that our confidence would be
[11:10] like this Bible and and when when we
[11:13] take matters into our own hands it's the
[11:15] equivalent of just throwing this Bible
[11:17] across the room now that'd be a
[11:19] sacrilegious act wouldn't it but the
[11:22] same thing's true when when we say well
[11:23] I'm not going to pray about this I'm
[11:24] just going to do what I want to do it's
[11:27] the same thing right
[11:29] but is there is there mercy and
[11:30] forgiveness of course amen but we're
[11:33] Kings and Priests unto God and let's
[11:36] overcome let's act like kings and queens
[11:39] right let's act like a spiritual priest
[11:42] or a priestess we'd say always want to
[11:45] make sure this is uh appropriate for
[11:47] male and female
[11:50] right let's act like that let let's
[11:53] let's be determined next time I have a
[11:54] struggle I'm going to go right to prayer
[11:56] amen or I'm going to go right to singing
[11:57] a song of worship to to encourage me by
[11:59] God's grace I need that we all need that
[12:01] praise God Amen now I want to read
[12:04] through a few verses to kind of get a
[12:06] few good examples here let's go to uh 2
[12:09] Chronicles 14 like I said I've been
[12:11] reading through these uh Kings it's just
[12:13] been really
[12:15] refreshing 2 Chronicles 14
[12:25] verse1 and remember what brother Bram
[12:27] said it was it's just a good word of
[12:28] wisdom try to find someone in the Bible
[12:30] that's like your life right and then and
[12:34] then mimic their life in other words see
[12:36] how they overcame their difficulties and
[12:39] then model your life after them right
[12:41] praise God so when I first started
[12:43] pastoring I looked at Hezekiah I don't
[12:45] know if my wife remembers that or not
[12:46] but he started uh um he started reigning
[12:49] when he was 25 well that's when I
[12:51] started pastoring I looked right there
[12:52] in the Bible I'm like wow I need to
[12:53] follow what he did right he started
[12:56] ruling over people at 25 and I'm not
[12:58] ruling by it myself I'm ruling by the
[13:00] word of God the Bible says that uh obey
[13:03] them which have the rule over you that
[13:05] preach the word of God to you and they
[13:07] they live their life as an example
[13:09] before the people and so for a while I
[13:11] looked at him and I look at St Paul I
[13:13] look at David look at different ones I
[13:15] can who can I model my life after and so
[13:19] we can see that about uh ASA you know we
[13:22] have a friend up there in uh uh Lorraine
[13:25] yeah Sheffield and his name is as I
[13:27] always wonder why is his name as and
[13:29] then I went and read about ASA he was a
[13:31] mighty man of God right he was a mighty
[13:33] king now he had his mistakes but don't
[13:35] you and I have our mistakes too see
[13:37] sometimes we're so quick to judge other
[13:39] people but what would we have done if we
[13:41] were in that
[13:42] situation right I think if we're honest
[13:44] we'd say well we would have fell short
[13:45] at some point right we all would have
[13:47] fallen short of God's glory right so
[13:49] let's not be too quick to judge ASA or
[13:52] you know condemn somebody we of course
[13:53] we never want to do that anyway let God
[13:55] do the judging Hallelujah we have to
[13:57] condemn sin but uh God God's the one who
[13:59] does the ultimate judging of souls
[14:01] Hallelujah 2 Chronicles 14 I'm not there
[14:04] yet so just had that thought there verse
[14:08] one so abijah slept with his fathers and
[14:12] they buried him in the city of David and
[14:13] ASA his son reigned instead in his days
[14:16] the land was quiet 10 years now look at
[14:19] that it's quite a blessing to have peace
[14:22] for 10 years right right it's quite a
[14:25] blessing now if you've suffered over a
[14:28] year or even a few months you know the
[14:30] pain of
[14:32] suffering so to have peace for 10 years
[14:34] that's a quite of a stamp of approval
[14:36] God just blessed you right amen 10 years
[14:40] no war now
[14:42] Israel's famous for you know leaving God
[14:44] and then all the enemies will surround
[14:46] Jerusalem right how many times has
[14:48] Jerusalem been destroyed rebuilt
[14:50] destroyed re it's the story of a
[14:52] believer's life right right a Believer
[14:54] gets victory for a while and then they
[14:56] let up and then they they need some
[14:57] correction right they need a difficult
[14:59] time to drive them back to God Amen it's
[15:02] just a beautiful story but here
[15:05] ASA ASA gets 10 years of
[15:10] quietness that should remind you of the
[15:12] New Testament right right we'll get to
[15:14] that in a moment verse two and ASA did
[15:16] that which was good and right in the
[15:18] eyes of the Lord is God don't you want
[15:19] God to say that about you amen Lydia did
[15:22] that which was good and right I can't
[15:24] use my children right
[15:26] amen verse three for he took away the
[15:29] altars of the strange gods look he took
[15:31] the idols out of the
[15:33] land now for us to be taking out you
[15:35] know the the care for riches right uh
[15:38] lust for money
[15:41] pornography uh dirty movies right I mean
[15:44] just take Evil songs right Wicked songs
[15:46] worldly songs any Idol movie stars
[15:50] whatever be take all these Idols got to
[15:52] be cast down in Jesus name right amen
[15:55] right some people can make an idol of
[15:57] just being depressed right
[15:59] self-pity you know feeling sorry for
[16:01] themselves they can make that their Idol
[16:03] that's what that's all they care about
[16:05] getting attention from others so we can
[16:07] learn from this a man or woman that does
[16:10] good and right in the sight of God takes
[16:12] all the idols out of their
[16:13] lives they live to God for everything
[16:16] and the high places and break down the
[16:18] images and cut down the Groves and
[16:20] commanded Judah now that's quite a thing
[16:22] command them to seek the Lord God of
[16:24] your their fathers and to do the law and
[16:28] the command
[16:30] and he took away out of all the cities
[16:32] of Judah the high places and the images
[16:34] and the kingdom was quiet before him
[16:36] look at that and church isn't that true
[16:38] you know the the more Temptations we get
[16:41] out of our Lives the more simple and
[16:43] wonderful and enjoyable our lives are
[16:45] amen how many can say Amen to that right
[16:47] yes when you make sure you you you're
[16:49] you're limiting anything other outside
[16:51] the word of God you're just more happy
[16:53] right amen life is just more simple
[16:56] right right life isn't so hard
[16:59] because you've got rid of all the
[17:00] distractions right amen and life just
[17:03] seems to go smoother
[17:06] amen I love
[17:08] that the land the kingdom was quiet
[17:10] before him verse six and he built fence
[17:13] cities in Judah for the land had rest
[17:16] and he had no war in those years because
[17:18] the Lord had given him rest ain't that
[17:20] awesome Amen you can you can love God
[17:23] and serve God so Faithfully that God
[17:26] will give you rest from major trials
[17:29] amen that's what the Bible
[17:33] teaches and I like that in his days of
[17:35] rest he wasn't uh you know slacking on
[17:38] God what was he doing he was building up
[17:40] and strengthening other cities amen now
[17:42] for us if God gives us peace and quiet
[17:45] we should build up our lives amen we
[17:47] should look at our lives and say what
[17:49] areas of my life are weakest how can I
[17:51] make them stronger right and another way
[17:54] to to to get stronger is to build up
[17:56] other people amen right right focus on
[17:59] other people build them up make them
[18:01] stronger help them out
[18:05] right see look outside of your city look
[18:07] to somebody else who can I protect who
[18:10] can I pray for who can I be a blessing
[18:13] to this was a time of rest therefore he
[18:17] said unto Judah let us build these
[18:19] cities and make about them walls and
[18:22] towers and Gates and bars while the land
[18:24] is yet before us because we have sought
[18:27] the Lord our God we sought him and he ha
[18:30] given us rest on every side so they
[18:33] built and prospered would that be great
[18:36] just to have peace in your
[18:38] family peace at home peace at work peace
[18:41] at school right peace at church peace at
[18:45] Aldi when you go to ALDI right right
[18:49] wherever you go peace it's just
[18:52] peace God blessed him with peace why
[18:55] because he sought the Lord and He took
[18:57] all the idols out of his life amen and
[18:59] God said because of that I'm rewarding
[19:01] you with the time of Peace amen not
[19:03] going to fight all these difficult
[19:06] Wars you're not going to have all this
[19:08] Bloodshed in these this decade think of
[19:10] that a decade of Peace we should be we
[19:13] should be striving for that praise God
[19:15] Amen Lord give me a decade of Peace
[19:17] Hallelujah 10 years of Peace verse eight
[19:21] and ASA had an army of men that bear
[19:23] targets and Spears out of Judah 300,000
[19:25] and out of Benjamin that bear Shields

[20:27] support in abortions I still pray for
[20:29] them to repent I don't know if they will
[20:31] but I'm commanded to pray for them right
[20:34] right just like anyone anyone who would

[20:57] Hallelujah
[20:58] that's the scripture verse three for
[21:01] this is good and acceptable in the sight
[21:02] of God our savior so a church who's on
[21:05] fire with the Holy Ghost they should be
[21:06] constantly praying and God will give
[21:08] them peace in their lives amen amen a't
[21:11] that wonderful God will give us seasons
[21:14] of Peace we just got to pray for our
[21:16] leaders we got to pray for you know
[21:17] State you know local state federal uh
[21:21] pray for everyone everyone that we're
[21:23] aware of we should pray constantly pray
[21:24] for them keep putting in those good
[21:26] prayer requests Hallelujah prise that's
[21:28] exactly right now go to acts 9 now this
[21:31] is off of memory this might be the wrong
[21:32] verse Acts 9:31 but in case you don't
[21:34] hold me on that
[21:38] one okay it is yeah that's right I wrote
[21:40] down right before service but I left the
[21:42] paper inside of my
[21:43] office then had the churches rest
[21:46] throughout all Judea and Galilee and
[21:47] Samaria and were edified and walking in
[21:50] the fear of the Lord and in the comfort
[21:53] of the Holy Ghost were multiplied look
[21:55] at that Holy Ghost filled Saints they
[21:57] they once were persecuted of course
[21:59] we've never lived through that in
[22:00] America yet we know the Bible said it's
[22:02] going to come the Bible said every
[22:04] nation uh will have the mark of the
[22:06] beast place down where if you don't take
[22:08] their Mark you'll be killed and you
[22:10] can't buy or sell without it so we know
[22:12] that's coming we don't know when
[22:14] though but here the Bible said God gave
[22:17] them rest God edified them so even while
[22:20] you're resting God can make you stronger
[22:23] Now isn't that the type of the natural
[22:25] how many like to get a good night's rest
[22:27] right how do you feel when you get a
[22:28] good night's rest you feel weaker or
[22:30] stronger well you're supposed to feel
[22:33] stronger that's the same thing spiritual
[22:36] as we're spiritually resting we can get
[22:38] stronger while we're resting in the
[22:39] promises of God Amen but we walk in the
[22:42] fear of the Lord we don't want to sin
[22:43] against God right
[22:45] amen and God gives us comfort in the
[22:48] Holy Ghost amen he's with us he's with
[22:52] me he's given me
[22:54] rest it's a great it's a great uh
[22:57] concept you so church can we see it we
[22:58] can see in the Old Testament right and
[23:00] we can see in the new can everybody see
[23:01] that God gives seasons of
[23:05] rest we can see it plainly in the
[23:07] scripture now if you would uh let's go
[23:08] to 2 Chronicles 17 so we're going to
[23:10] skip a few chapters ahead 2 Chronicles
[23:14] 176 2 Chronicles
[23:26] 176
[23:30] now this speaking
[23:32] of
[23:35] Jehoshaphat now this verse was striking
[23:38] verse six I don't know if you've read
[23:39] this lately but listen to this and his
[23:42] heart was lifted up now how does that
[23:44] sound right away it doesn't sound good
[23:46] right but actually this is good usually
[23:50] we say people are lifted up they're
[23:52] prideful but this must mean Jehoshaphat
[23:55] has a lot of confidence in God amen
[23:58] right his heart is not depressed down in
[24:01] the ways of the Lord his heart is lifted
[24:04] up in the ways of the Lord amen in other
[24:07] words he's got confidence in
[24:10] God and his heart was lifted up in the
[24:13] ways of the Lord moreover he took away
[24:14] the high places and Groves out of Judah
[24:17] see every time God's moving people are
[24:19] getting rid of their sins and the church
[24:20] said amen so if we want to see God move
[24:23] more we got to get sin out of our Lives
[24:26] got to talk to somebody about it or talk
[24:27] to eles about it or pray about it lay at
[24:29] the altar lay at your chair you got to
[24:31] get sin out of your life and then God
[24:33] comes on the scene praise God Amen
[24:35] Hallelujah verse 7 also in the third
[24:38] year of his Reign he s he sent to the
[24:40] princes even to Ben Hal and to Obadiah
[24:43] and to Zechariah and to nethanel and to
[24:46] Miah to teach in the cities of Judah and
[24:50] with them he sent Levites even and I'm
[24:52] not going to skip all I'm going to skip
[24:52] all those names he just names all the
[24:54] people the Levites and Priests verse 9
[24:56] and they taught in Judah and had the
[24:57] book book of the law of the Lord with
[24:59] them and went about throughout all the
[25:00] cities of Judah and taught the
[25:03] people now I sent these verses to
[25:06] another bible message preacher down in
[25:09] South Carolina and scoffield calls this
[25:12] section the Revival under
[25:15] Jehoshaphat I thought that's beautiful
[25:18] how do you have what Revival means to
[25:19] make alive again right so the land was
[25:22] dead because of the idols but as soon as
[25:24] they got the idols out and they started
[25:26] teaching the word of God now they're
[25:28] having Revival right amen that's always
[25:30] the way to have Revival Hallelujah get
[25:32] the sin out of your life and be enjoy
[25:35] the word of God hear the word of God
[25:36] believe the word of God hallelujah amen
[25:39] and notice they were teaching the word
[25:41] of God so that's why I sent it to a
[25:42] teacher and he said Oh Glory to God he
[25:44] sent me these texts with these emojis
[25:46] that was such a blessing and I said it
[25:48] wasall see when you're having Revival
[25:51] sins out of your life and you want to
[25:53] learn more about the word of God Amen
[25:56] see you always hungering for more of
[25:58] God's word
[26:01] amen so how do they have Revival they
[26:03] got rid of sin and they wanted to learn
[26:05] learn more be taught the word of God
[26:13] hallelujah and then you know in the next
[26:14] in the rest of the chapter he he
[26:17] grows um he grows Israel he in verse 12
[26:22] he racks he waxes great rather he builds
[26:24] Judah he builds cities of storehouses
[26:27] and he he develops his businesses raise
[26:30] up Mighty Men of
[26:32] Valor and all these men the Bible said
[26:34] in verse 16 willingly offer themselves
[26:36] to God so during this time of
[26:39] Peace uh they built up each other they
[26:42] got stronger they learn the word of God
[26:45] hallelujah amen it's a great lesson for
[26:48] us if we want to be strong in God we've
[26:50] got to rely upon God we've got to get
[26:52] sin out of our lives and we've got to
[26:53] Hunger for More of the word of God right
[26:56] amen
[26:58] I'll just give a case little pat on the
[27:00] back you know recently I've been noticed
[27:01] her been reading the church age book and
[27:02] she's been asking me some good Bible
[27:04] questions I thought right there look at
[27:06] that 14y old girl just reading a few
[27:08] pages every morning right few pages
[27:10] every morning same thing I used to do
[27:12] when when I used to read that book I
[27:14] read through that book a couple times
[27:16] and I that's a great example of just
[27:17] drawing n to God and see when you when
[27:19] you when you Feast on the word of God
[27:20] you ask questions about God's word right
[27:23] right and and that makes you want to
[27:24] grow closer to God Amen and you want God
[27:26] you come to church asking God questions
[27:28] Lord let the preacher preach on this let
[27:31] somebody preach on this we got brother
[27:32] bod coming on Sunday right he don't know
[27:34] nothing I'm preaching I'm sure he don't
[27:35] listen to me who would listen to me
[27:37] right but Le let's let's pull upon God's
[27:40] word and let's see if God will minister
[27:42] to some of our questions amen it happens
[27:45] so often yeah so often if we just come
[27:49] hungry to hear God's word amen amen
[27:56] amen okay now now I want to switch over
[27:58] here just show a few things you know um
[28:00] I was thinking about my life and I said
[28:01] this
[28:02] um I think last Wednesday when I
[28:05] preached it
[28:06] here you know I look back at my emails
[28:09] and
[28:10] uh you know it was uh July of
[28:14] 2018 when I started what I feel like has
[28:17] been a season of rest for me and I told
[28:20] you about you know just generally just
[28:22] about some church problems we used to
[28:23] have with certain certain
[28:25] individuals and uh I would lose sleep
[28:28] about it I was telling that to Serena uh
[28:30] on the drive to church with with
[28:32] Casa it was just hard to sleep you know
[28:35] it was just it was pressure stress just
[28:37] worrying how's this going to work out um
[28:40] and during during that season beforehand
[28:42] it was difficult sometimes to come to
[28:44] church it's difficult to see people and
[28:46] shake their
[28:47] hands right because you never know when
[28:49] the next critic I felt like when when am
[28:51] I going what what have I done wrong this
[28:53] time you know the next criticism the
[28:55] next criticism next criticism like I
[28:57] could never do anything
[28:58] right um but I just thought it was
[29:01] interesting you know in July of
[29:05] 2018 uh this this this uh group left and
[29:09] then remember August of 2018 who
[29:11] remembers August 2018 what happened
[29:14] that's when the church
[29:15] flooded remember
[29:17] that and I forgot about it but at that
[29:20] time another group uh had left as well
[29:23] so two months in a row and and uh you
[29:26] know God bless those individuals but
[29:28] they they were some of my biggest
[29:30] criticizers and I'm not saying that
[29:31] critical because some of them come back
[29:33] later and apologize so they admitted
[29:35] they were wrong and just in my in my
[29:37] heart of hearts and my in my love for
[29:39] God I was just trying to get through it
[29:41] and understand Lord have I done wrong
[29:42] and you know I'm scratching my head
[29:43] pulling out my hair you know have I done
[29:45] something
[29:47] wrong and but we've all we all witnessed
[29:50] back then if you remember back to 2018
[29:52] it was like God allowed that flood to
[29:54] come in here we had a month over at the
[29:56] YMCA right we come back and God is our
[29:58] witness it's like we had a brand new
[30:01] church and not just the brand new carpet
[30:04] cuz it don't look new anymore but it was
[30:07] the criticism was gone the evil spirit
[30:09] of criticism was gone and now there was
[30:11] peace and love and joy back in the house
[30:13] of the Lord
[30:15] amen right so it's been five years since
[30:18] then now we've had some great I
[30:21] personally have had some great
[30:22] highlights in this season of rest uh
[30:24] remember the Bible says Paul you know
[30:27] went around strengthening all the
[30:28] disciples right we just read how when
[30:31] when the Kings had rest they sent the
[30:32] word of God and it strengthened them
[30:35] right in the New Testament the Bible
[30:36] says let the word of God dwell in you
[30:38] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[30:39] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[30:41] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[30:43] Grace in your hearts to the
[30:45] Lord so we saw in the Old Testament when
[30:47] they had seasons of rest God gave them
[30:49] teaching and God gave them the word of
[30:50] God and God strengthened them amen and
[30:54] remember you know you preach on Joshua a
[30:55] few years ago remember the Bible shows
[30:57] us the way to have strength in God
[31:00] repent and be humble the Bible
[31:02] says remember God's promise of his
[31:05] faithfulness amen right God told Joshua
[31:08] remember the word remember the promise
[31:10] and then keep all the commands you
[31:13] can right and Jesus said that uh Jesus
[31:17] uh says man should not live by bread
[31:19] alone but by every word that proceeds
[31:21] out of the mouth of God we live by the
[31:23] word of God right amen and then the
[31:26] Bible says constantly speak God's word
[31:29] and constantly meditate upon God's word
[31:31] then you'll be strong amen so we know
[31:34] the way to be
[31:36] strong and if I'm having a season of
[31:38] Peace then I I I need to make myself
[31:41] strong because I know a battle's coming
[31:43] eventually right we know awful Winters
[31:46] eventually
[31:47] coming we know the icy roads are
[31:50] eventually coming right we know negative
[31:52] 10's probably coming again so we got to
[31:54] keep our pipes from bursting right
[31:57] we know it's coming it's
[31:59] inevitable seasons of Trials are coming
[32:02] it's inevitable so let's strengthen
[32:04] ourselves now right in a season of rest
[32:08] right and that's what I feel like God
[32:10] has done uh in my life of course and I
[32:13] believe in this church but remember the
[32:14] Bible says the joy of the Lord is your
[32:16] strength and the Bible said how do we
[32:17] have joy in thy presence is fullness of
[32:19] joy amen so we want to be strong so how
[32:21] do we be strong we got to get in his
[32:23] presence amen
[32:25] right and the I said how do you come in
[32:27] his presence give Thanksgiving and Make
[32:29] a Joyful Noise un the Lord amen so come
[32:32] to church give God thanks give him
[32:34] praise get this presence that makes you
[32:36] joyful and then that Joy gives you
[32:38] strength praise God Amen oh the Bible
[32:41] gives us all these beautiful formulas
[32:42] amen amen these spiritual formulas these
[32:45] spiritual checklist we can use to honor
[32:48] God and obey his
[32:50] word and church and I thought again 2018
[32:54] my season of rest started and I
[32:56] published my first book in in 2019
[32:58] that's not a coincidence I remember
[33:00] there was a break in there when I
[33:02] stopped writing because I was
[33:03] discouraged and I was going through
[33:04] trials so isn't that interesting I
[33:06] couldn't finish that
[33:08] book and that book has now helped many
[33:10] many people yeah I still get testimonies
[33:12] about
[33:13] it and then in 2021 I put out my second
[33:16] book and I thought wow in my season of
[33:18] rest God's allowed me to get the word of
[33:20] God
[33:21] out just like the Bible just like
[33:24] Jehoshaphat he got the word out he had
[33:26] the word to be taught in a season of
[33:30] rest Hallelujah and church we've had
[33:33] some great things we've learned some
[33:34] great
[33:35] things you know this has helped many
[33:37] people too about water baptism I preach
[33:38] this down at the uh uh former Amish
[33:41] committee when we baptized 17 of them
[33:43] back in April 17 former Amish baptized
[33:46] they were baptized in Father Son and
[33:47] Holy Ghost but they didn't know if you
[33:49] keep reading 10 days later after Jesus
[33:52] said this Peter said baptize in the name
[33:55] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah M right uh
[33:59] and then James and and John James and
[34:01] Peter baptized in the name of the Lord
[34:03] Jesus and then Peter baptized in the
[34:05] name of the Lord and then Paul baptized
[34:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus and then
[34:08] Paul was baptized in the name of the
[34:09] Lord which Father Son and Holy Ghost
[34:11] then equals Lord Jesus
[34:14] Christ the disciples never used father
[34:17] son Holy Ghost and when those former
[34:19] Amish saw it they went right to the
[34:20] water to be baptized that's been a great
[34:22] highlight of this season hallelujah
[34:25] hallelujah a great season of rest
[34:28] right so we got to recognize the seasons
[34:31] and what God has been showing us
[34:33] here I'm going to go back to this one um
[34:36] we saw how God you know over the years
[34:38] God showed us that we have three parts
[34:40] and we need the Holy Ghost in all three
[34:42] parts right most churches just get the
[34:44] first two parts they feel the Holy Ghost
[34:46] on their body you know they'll cry
[34:48] they'll say I got goosebumps or you know
[34:50] something like that that's fine that's
[34:51] good that's the Holy Ghost no doubt but
[34:53] it's got to get deeper inside you amen
[34:56] and then some of them will even get the
[34:57] Holy Ghost in their mind which is good
[34:59] they're thinking about the word of God
[35:00] they might speak in tongues they might
[35:02] prophesy but we all know people that
[35:04] have spoken tongues are prophesy and
[35:05] then go live a sinful life right and the
[35:08] Bible says in the New Testament perfect
[35:10] Holiness in the fear of God Amen other
[35:13] words make your life more holy as you
[35:15] become a Christian right as you become a
[35:17] more experienced Christian you should be
[35:18] more holy amen less sin in your life
[35:21] more Holiness amen amen that's what the
[35:23] Bible teaches but we found
[35:27] that real Holy Ghost filled Christians
[35:29] let the Holy Ghost go deeper than that
[35:31] down to the soul where God comes and
[35:33] lives in the very depth of their being
[35:36] amen their nature the soul is the nature
[35:39] of the person that's why some people
[35:40] have a sinful nature right they live a
[35:42] sinful life because they got a sinful
[35:43] nature but when you have God down in the
[35:45] soul you want everything in your life to
[35:48] obey God's word right amen and you say
[35:50] God I'm throwing open all the doors come
[35:52] in every area of my life fill every area
[35:54] of my life Hallelujah that's right take
[35:57] control of every area of my life amen
[36:00] right my thought life my finances uh my
[36:03] marriage right my my parenting
[36:06] Hallelujah my money already said money
[36:08] yeah uh my church life you know my my
[36:10] relationships my friendships my
[36:13] education right make everything God's
[36:15] spirit makes a difference in every area
[36:17] of Our Lives hallelujah amen and that's
[36:20] a real person who's really filled with
[36:21] the Holy Ghost they want every part of
[36:23] their life directed by God Amen obedient
[36:27] to the word of God and this this
[36:30] actually takes three steps right to be
[36:32] filled with God's spirit takes three
[36:34] steps somebody go back
[36:36] there just like being born takes three
[36:39] steps water break blood Breath of Life a
[36:42] man's spiritual birth is three steps
[36:44] justification you're saved you're
[36:46] forgiven but you got to be Sanctified
[36:48] you got to be cleaned out and then you
[36:49] got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[36:51] in your soul amen most churches stop
[36:54] right here they say okay you're saved
[36:55] and they they don't move the people on
[36:57] to a more separated cleaned out life
[36:59] right but we want to go beyond that
[37:01] praise God Amen we want to go to the
[37:03] filling of the Holy Ghost where your
[37:05] soul is immersed in the spirit of God so
[37:09] every part of our Lives is directed by
[37:10] the holy spirit amen Israel even it took
[37:13] them three steps to get out of to
[37:15] possess the land they left Egypt they
[37:17] went through the Wilderness and then
[37:18] they possessed the promised land amen
[37:20] the Tabernacle was cleansed in three
[37:22] parts the outer core the holy place the
[37:24] Hest of
[37:25] holies the Earth was cleansed by Noah's
[37:28] flood then Jesus's blood and it's going
[37:30] to be burned by
[37:32] fire right before the
[37:34] Millennium and then ezekiel's prophecy
[37:36] said there'll be three steps to be
[37:38] filled with the Holy Ghost God gives you
[37:39] a new heart a new spirit and then God's
[37:42] spirit comes and dwells in you Jesus
[37:44] said the Holy Ghost is like a plant a
[37:46] wheat plant with three stages the blade
[37:48] comes forth then the ear then the full
[37:50] corn right amen and then Jesus said I am
[37:53] the way the truth and he gives you the
[37:55] Holy Ghost life hallelujah oh beautiful
[37:58] praise God it's just the Bible is so
[38:00] beautiful it's so rich amen amen
[38:04] um so these are all great highlights of
[38:06] this season of rest here and as you know
[38:09] my family we're almost reading through
[38:10] we're almost done reading through the
[38:11] the the 12 New Testament Mysteries book
[38:14] but remember brother Ram spoke over 30
[38:16] times to thus sayth the Lord in other
[38:18] words God told him 30 times to say I'm
[38:21] speaking this with my
[38:22] authority and that's what I always say
[38:24] if anyone has a question about brother
[38:25] BR go that 13th chapter of that book
[38:28] because that lays it out as best as I
[38:30] possibly could by the help of God
[38:32] brother raham gave us at least five
[38:34] fulfilled prophecies that have come to
[38:36] pass he gave us six thus say the Lords
[38:38] about New Testament Mysteries he gave us
[38:41] eight doctrines with thus sayith the
[38:43] Lord and he's given us 11 future
[38:45] prophecies with thus sayeth the Lord all
[38:49] these great uh blessings they've come in
[38:52] this season of rest right and I can
[38:55] recognize that in my life as a season of
[38:58] rest you know how many times have I
[39:00] looked at my wife or we talked and maybe
[39:01] just I've said honey we sure enjoying
[39:03] these Golden Years these last five years
[39:06] have been I mean they've all been
[39:07] wonderful being married to her you know
[39:08] but I'm talking about like you know
[39:10] troubles and trials we've really had
[39:13] we've had really had some wonderful
[39:14] years
[39:15] here where they're
[39:18] peaceful and they're in obedience and
[39:20] we're growing in the things of God Amen
[39:23] I just got an email this week of the
[39:24] brother said uh forget where he's from
[39:26] some foreign country but he said brother
[39:28] Jesse your video about how to overcome
[39:29] pornography he said it set me completely
[39:32] free from pornography thanks the Lord
[39:34] hallelujah what are we doing we're
[39:36] trying to strengthen other people amen
[39:39] we're trying to strengthen the Saints
[39:41] like they did in the Bible get rid of
[39:43] all these Idols no doubt pornography is
[39:44] an awful Idol you got to break down that
[39:47] Idol you can overcome that Idol praise
[39:49] God crush it like they did in the Bible
[39:51] amen crush it Hallelujah yes get rid of
[39:54] it Hallelujah and fill your life with
[39:55] the love of God God hallelujah
[39:59] amen so we had these great uh highlights
[40:03] you know in this uh season of rest been
[40:07] very thankful for all these God has done
[40:09] wonderful things and so I want to
[40:11] recognize that I want to thank God for
[40:13] seasons of rest and we we've learned to
[40:16] rely upon the Lord praise God right I
[40:20] hope that you feel this way as a church
[40:22] we rely on each other's prayers right
[40:25] right some of our families maybe don't
[40:27] believe in God or they don't believe the
[40:28] same way we do which is you know that's
[40:29] their choice and we love them still but
[40:32] you you know you wouldn't maybe ask them
[40:33] to pray for you because you know they
[40:35] don't have faith like they should have
[40:38] right and so who do you go to when you
[40:40] need prayer hopefully one of us by God's
[40:43] grace right
[40:44] right because you have confidence in
[40:47] their prayers amen
[40:49] hallelujah because God has strengthened
[40:52] us over the years in quiet years God's
[40:56] Building up our confidence in the word
[40:58] of God God's teaching us to trust in his
[41:00] word even in the quiet times God's
[41:04] Building up fences around us amen God's
[41:06] putting Gates around us praise God Amen
[41:10] God's uh putting doors in front of us
[41:12] hallelujah amen he's given us Shields of
[41:15] Faith hallelujah amen now we're getting
[41:17] into the the full armor of a Christian
[41:20] hallelujah amen he's given us a sword to
[41:22] battle with praise God Amen and all the
[41:25] Army
[41:27] of a fully armed Christian amen God has
[41:30] been strengthening Us in these Seasons
[41:33] amen and it's been a great blessing but
[41:36] yet Kings must rely upon the
[41:42] lord it's a great thing to do Church to
[41:45] rely on the lord it's a great thing to
[41:47] do it's hard to do right people want to
[41:51] rely on their own smarts or their own
[41:53] plans or their own their own ideas about
[41:55] the future they want to rely upon family
[41:58] or friends or their boss whatever they
[42:01] want to rely on so many other things
[42:03] other than relying upon the Eternal God
[42:06] right and that's we've got to learn to
[42:08] rely on the Lord
[42:10] Jesus
[42:14] Hallelujah so we saw there uh getting
[42:16] back to our
[42:18] text this same King ASA who did such a
[42:21] wonderful job and had the 10 years of
[42:24] rest he was the one that when the the
[42:26] enemy came the syrians I'm sorry another
[42:28] enemy came against him he hired or the
[42:31] Syrian King and tried to hire him to
[42:34] help him out to fight his battles and
[42:37] God said because of that you've lost the
[42:39] battle you've lost the battle because
[42:42] you relied upon the hand of man rather
[42:44] than the strong arm of the
[42:47] Lord hallelujah think about that church
[42:50] sometimes sometimes we don't think about
[42:51] enough God says my right hand is my
[42:54] right hand of strength right
[42:56] right God's God God's got power
[42:58] Hallelujah he's not short on power he
[43:00] can deliver he can save he can heal
[43:03] Hallelujah he can provide hallelujah
[43:05] amen it's a right hand of power the
[43:07] Bible says amen amen and he wants us to
[43:10] rely on him praise
[43:14] God now what we see is that sometimes
[43:16] people get they rely upon themselves
[43:18] right they get
[43:21] prideful and we must not let Pride build
[43:23] up in our lives that's just an awful
[43:25] Idol as something else might
[43:28] be right like greed or something you
[43:31] know or lust or something awful is just
[43:33] as awful to be prideful like I can rely
[43:36] upon myself or I can trust me I know I
[43:39] won't fail well just give yourself five
[43:41] minutes you might fail right you might
[43:43] fail right you might not do what you
[43:45] said you were going to do so we've got
[43:47] to put all of our trust in God Amen
[43:51] Hallelujah how many want to put their
[43:52] trust in Christ tonight amen hallelujah
[43:56] I'm almost done here by God's
[43:59] grace so we go through these Seasons
[44:01] church and we've we've got to learn here
[44:04] to strengthen ourselves in these Seasons
[44:06] like here tonight tonight's service is
[44:08] not in vain this should be an
[44:10] opportunity where you can leave here
[44:11] saying I'm stronger than what I was when
[44:14] I came am that's right right I'm
[44:17] stronger I'm more joyful amen right I
[44:21] know the word better right amen some of
[44:24] you might want to print out his life
[44:26] there and just hang it up on your fridge
[44:28] there right get rid of all the idols
[44:30] season of rest God prospers everything
[44:32] in my life right I mean who wouldn't
[44:34] want that but you got to be willing to
[44:37] break down the
[44:39] idols praise
[44:41] God that means everything comes into
[44:44] subjection to the word of God right
[44:47] everything comes into subjection to
[44:50] God's word remember the Bible just says
[44:52] it like this it's just a matter of
[44:54] yielding right right Malachi and I drive
[44:56] to taekwondo every every Monday night
[44:59] and we always go to copy Circle right
[45:01] Malachi right before we get right before
[45:03] we get there what do we got to do we got
[45:05] to yield right there we got a choice we
[45:07] can either burn through it and I'm glad
[45:09] he doesn't do that somebody taught him
[45:11] well to
[45:12] drive must been my
[45:15] wife he don't try to burn through and
[45:18] I'm not yielding every time he's yielded
[45:20] so far keep it up
[45:22] buddy yield you just have to let the
[45:26] other person have their way right and
[45:28] the church said now I'm not saying don't
[45:31] let people walk on you sometimes Jesus
[45:33] says you have to let people do that but
[45:34] I don't mean I mean it not in bad ways
[45:37] like physical abuse mental abuse sexual
[45:39] abuse never allow that sometimes you got
[45:42] to lend money to people and hope they
[45:44] don't pay it back right like that's what
[45:46] Jesus said lend money and hope they
[45:49] don't pay you back all right or make a
[45:51] meal for somebody and you know they
[45:53] would never make a meal for you that's
[45:56] real
[45:56] Christianity right helping the people
[45:58] that can't help you back right but
[46:01] that's what the Bible says following the
[46:03] Holy Spirit each day is just yielding to
[46:06] God's spirit letting God's word have its
[46:08] way in your life and not taking your way
[46:12] and things that you want to go or things
[46:14] that you want to do and the way you want
[46:16] your life to go but yielding to God's
[46:19] way and the way you know it's God's way
[46:20] is it obeys God's word right Hallelujah
[46:24] obeying God's word
[46:27] and so you know in these last five years
[46:28] I feel like God has really strengthened
[46:30] me you know as as I've told you you know
[46:32] my only real persecution these last five
[46:34] years has been
[46:35] online right but sticks and stones may
[46:38] hurt my I'm sorry Sticks and Stones
[46:40] how's that
[46:42] go may may break my bones that's right
[46:44] break my bones but words but comments or
[46:47] thumbs up or thumbs down will never hurt
[46:49] me on YouTube right that'll never hurt
[46:50] me on YouTube it won't hurt me it make
[46:53] me nervous and upset you know and but it
[46:56] won't hurt me thank God we're in a
[46:57] season of Peace amen but we get stronger
[47:01] because we still have battles to face
[47:03] but God's word makes us stronger God's
[47:06] word makes us joyful God's word edifies
[47:09] us hallelujah God's word keeps Our Lives
[47:11] clean hallelujah
[47:13] amen that's what God gives God gives us
[47:16] peace prosperity restoration he rebuilds
[47:20] Our Lives amen hallelujah gives us a
[47:24] fresh start he turns the page as we've
[47:26] said right right God let you turn the
[47:29] page start a new chapter in life oh it's
[47:32] so wonderful just like these wonderful
[47:34] kings that God had raised up there ASA
[47:36] and
[47:37] Jehoshaphat
[47:40] hallelujah it's also a great time to
[47:42] store up treasure in heaven if You' got
[47:43] peace that's a time to serve other
[47:46] people fast pray give arms store up
[47:50] Treasures in Heaven where nobody can
[47:52] break in and rob the bank in heaven
[47:54] Hallelujah no devil will rob that bank
[47:57] amen hallelujah he protected by the
[47:59] spirit of Holiness
[48:01] hallelujah oh it's
[48:06] beautiful now remember let's read a
[48:08] couple more verses uh I'm done with that
[48:11] I
[48:12] think let's read just a couple more I
[48:14] just had a couple more
[48:17] verses uh 1 Chronicles 49 1st Chronicles
[48:20] 4:9 I recently heard this preach and I
[48:22] thought well this would be a good
[48:23] reminder for all of
[48:24] us
[48:31] 1 Chronicles
[48:34] 4:9 actually nine and 10 in case you
[48:37] when you get a chance there this
[48:38] familiar now somebody wrote a big famous
[48:40] book about this it kind of took it the
[48:43] wrong way but if you take it the right
[48:44] way this this this uh testimony is
[48:47] really powerful it's about JZ how many
[48:50] remember the book of JZ the prayer JZ I
[48:52] read the book it's a real short book
[48:54] it's all positive positive positive and
[48:56] that's
[48:56] good but if you take some new testament
[48:59] Scriptures it really balances it
[49:01] out okay so let's read that
[49:09] there and Jaz now his name means sorrow
[49:13] so think about that you know when he was
[49:15] born his mom looked at him and said
[49:18] sorrow that's pretty sad name right youd
[49:22] want your name to be like blessing or
[49:23] virtue or something
[49:26] that'd be a good name to have or Joy or
[49:29] something like that healing or faith or
[49:32] something but mom looks at Jaz
[49:36] sorrow sorrow this baby is sorrow to
[49:40] me and jabz was more honorable than his
[49:44] brother and his mother called his name
[49:47] jabz saying because I bear him with
[49:49] sorrow so it was a difficult birth right
[49:50] difficult delivery and Jaz called on the
[49:53] god of Israel saying oh that th would
[49:55] bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and
[49:58] that thine hand might be with me and
[50:01] that thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil
[50:03] that's the ticket right there that's the
[50:05] key right there keep me from evil in
[50:07] other words I'm not asking for more so I
[50:09] can enjoy the lust of it I'm asking so
[50:11] I'll avoid evil amen I want to have more
[50:15] responsibility I want to have more in in
[50:17] his case land so that I can do good with
[50:20] it amen I want to be kept from Evil
[50:23] things right
[50:26] I don't want all these Temptations I
[50:28] want to serve God
[50:32] Amen and look at that let your hand
[50:34] might be with me the Bible said God
[50:36] stretched forth his hand to heal
[50:37] Hallelujah so he wanted healing
[50:40] Hallelujah he wanted blessings he wanted
[50:42] all his needs met it's a beautiful
[50:45] testimony here I guess I overuse the
[50:46] word beautiful it was a tremendous
[50:48] testimony here that's another word I've
[50:51] overused for 10 years uh that enlarge my
[50:55] my Coast that thy hand might be with me
[50:57] that thou Keep Me From Evil and that it
[50:58] may not grieve me see he didn't want a
[51:00] life of constant grief right suffering
[51:03] and disappointment and
[51:06] despair he wanted strength he wanted
[51:08] happiness right and what did God do God
[51:13] gave him what he asked for amen well
[51:16] those moms said well you came to this
[51:18] world
[51:20] sorrow yet he said Lord make me a
[51:23] blessing amen bless me so I can avoid
[51:26] evil and I can expand my Coast course
[51:29] that would mean right land would be
[51:30] either animals or right grains or so I
[51:33] can be a blessing to people amen and
[51:36] notice that more honorable so that means
[51:38] his other brothers they enjoyed a little
[51:40] bit of sin but not Jaz Jaz was against
[51:43] sin hallelujah amen and that in church
[51:46] just you know in the natural we all many
[51:48] of us have brothers and sisters some of
[51:49] us has seven brothers and sisters
[51:52] right or five or nine right or eight
[51:57] yeah we got a lot of big families
[52:00] here and so it's not a competition you
[52:02] know against your siblings but your
[52:04] desire should be Lord I want to be kept
[52:06] from all evil amen I don't want to play
[52:08] with sin in other words right I want to
[52:11] live holy to Christ amen and God will
[52:15] look down and say I'll bless a prayer
[52:16] like that
[52:18] amen so I've got four brothers and a
[52:21] sister and I'm not in competition but my
[52:24] desire is Lord Keep Me From Evil right
[52:27] do whatever you have to do to keep me
[52:28] humble walk in the ways of God that I'll
[52:31] live holy to glorify your name amen if
[52:34] that means I I'm I'm more honorable than
[52:36] praise God I know they'd say I've heard
[52:38] cam preach the same thing so that's just
[52:41] that that's what every Christian wants
[52:42] right every Christian wants to honor God
[52:44] and live clean to God hallelujah amen
[52:47] but we need reminders of that that's why
[52:48] this is a good reminder for us amen now
[52:51] the balance on this is that it's not all
[52:53] fun and games if you get your your Coast
[52:56] enlarged or I've got more money or I've
[52:58] got more influence because Jesus said to
[53:01] whom much is given much is required
[53:04] right so so in other words on the day of
[53:06] judgment God's going to ask you now what
[53:07] did you do with that extra money what
[53:09] did you do with that extra platform I
[53:11] gave you right what you do with that and
[53:14] you want to be able to say Lord here's
[53:15] what I've done I did like you told me I
[53:18] did what was right I did which was good
[53:19] and right in your sight amen and
[53:23] remember the Bible says preachers will
[53:24] be judged most harsh I'm bringing that
[53:25] up mainly for my sake and any of the
[53:28] maybe future preachers where's Zion is
[53:29] he there where's Malachi any any brother
[53:33] you know if they would consider those
[53:35] things they got to consider that you're
[53:37] going to be judged more
[53:39] harshly right more strictly because of
[53:42] your
[53:45] position and so this is the great uh
[53:47] this is just a great prayer you know he
[53:50] called on God he said
[53:52] God I want to do more for your name
[53:54] Hallelujah I don't want a life of Sorrow
[53:56] I don't want a life of grief I want a
[53:57] life of blessings and God heard that
[54:00] humble
[54:02] prayer what did he want to do he wanted
[54:05] to rely on the Lord amen amen he didn't
[54:08] want to rely on other people he said
[54:10] Lord enlarge my Coast so I can be a
[54:12] blessing to other
[54:13] people that's a wonderful prayer that's
[54:16] a prayer of a sincere heart and that's a
[54:18] prayer that God will answer
[54:22] Hallelujah last verse
[54:26] I just read this one this morning I
[54:27] thought well it's perfect 2 Chronicles
[54:29] chapter 32 this is my chapter this
[54:31] morning 2 Chronicles 32 then we'll be
[54:33] finish up right about 8:00 right school
[54:35] night trying to watch the clock here try
[54:38] not to get too caught up in Heavenly
[54:39] places here
[54:41] tonight who's ready to dance around the
[54:43] church
[54:46] Hallelujah 2
[54:48] Chronicles 32 verse 20 and 21 there's a
[54:51] time there's a season to dance no doubt
[54:53] about that
[55:03] all right now in this case uh if you
[55:05] just go back and read the chapter maybe
[55:07] in your free time sen a cherub was a
[55:09] king and he sent letters first he
[55:11] gathered around Israel and then uh you
[55:14] know they prayed nothing happened then
[55:16] he sent a letter right a threat
[55:19] sometimes that's how like our text
[55:21] messages are like threats right modern
[55:22] day modern day threats from the Bible
[55:24] Tex you or emails oh I got this
[55:28] email I got this i got this text it's
[55:31] our modern day sen
[55:34] cherub and it was quite intimidating and
[55:38] he and he said what makes you think your
[55:39] God will save you all these other
[55:41] nations said their gods would save them
[55:43] and I've destroyed all of
[55:46] them and so what did the prophet and the
[55:49] King
[55:50] do Hallelujah very
[55:52] simple and church this is how simple it
[55:54] is for us verse 20 and for this cause
[55:58] Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah
[55:59] the son of Amos prayed and cried to
[56:03] Heaven see that church sometimes prayer
[56:06] isn't enough sometimes you got to cry
[56:08] some tears that's right amen not just
[56:11] they just didn't pray they cried amen
[56:14] and God saw their tears amen praise God
[56:19] grown men grown men Isaiah a man who
[56:22] wrote a 66 chapter book of the Bible he
[56:25] saw God High lifted
[56:27] up and a coal touched his mouth is that
[56:30] right right he said here am I send me
[56:33] and here's a man that could cry and pray
[56:35] to God
[56:37] am what' God do with all these threats
[56:41] with all these uh all this intimidation
[56:45] against him did God hear their cries
[56:48] absolutely verse 21 and the Lord sent an
[56:50] angel aren't you glad he sends Angels
[56:53] amen and cut off all the Mighty Men of
[56:55] Valor and the leaders and the captains
[56:57] in the camp of the king of Syria Assyria
[56:59] and he returned with shame of face to
[57:01] his own land and when he was coming in
[57:03] the house of his God they that came
[57:05] forth of his own bows slew him there
[57:07] with the sword not a very pleasant
[57:09] ending to this man's life but he spoke
[57:12] against the god in other words he spoke
[57:14] against the Holy Spirit and so he reaped
[57:16] what he sowed he blasting the Holy Ghost
[57:20] and look what happened to him right he
[57:22] went beyond mercy and he was judged but
[57:26] we want to be the group like Isaiah and
