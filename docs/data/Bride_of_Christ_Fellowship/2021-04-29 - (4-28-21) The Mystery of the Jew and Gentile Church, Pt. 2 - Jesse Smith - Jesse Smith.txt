audio okay that's fine that's better than nothing thank you praise the lord so sorry yeah we did switch desks today so maybe that's why i want to get rid of that older desk i just get like a more modern simple desk so maybe i threw off some some cord or something like that so we'll see i know vang and amen can fix it probably maokai and lydia if they got a chance to fix it i'm sure they'll do a good job with that uh so anyways let's go to our bible tonight here let's go to uh ephesians chapter three and then we'll read our memory verse from brother jose and i believe sister naomi you're up for for may so maybe be meditating on a scripture if you'd like if you'd like to do one you don't have to but i think you're up for me by god's grace so look forward to that by god's grace boy it's hard to believe april's almost over uh but thank the lord it's been a wonderful month uh beautiful weather today man just what a what a blessing what in a refreshment an encouragement uh god is so gracious so good to us i like to look again at uh the new testament or the mystery of the jew and gentile church i'll just kind of keep it shorter brother braham calls it uh the mystery of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile i like to continue on this thought here tonight so ephesians chapter 3. it's actually verses 1-11 we won't read all those but we kind of have a good understanding of them a couple years ago we preached on the whole book of ephesians so it's not as if we've never heard it but as christians we know and as humans we just need reminders i always ben i'm always benefited i forget so much i've preached so much i've read so much but i always forget so much so i just need uh constant reminders from the holy spirit uh in this particular portion paul uses the word mystery four times and he's talking about this same revelation the same revelation of the jew and gentile making one church and i'm so glad to be a part of it praise god what a blessing remember the bible said before we were heathens without knowledge without covenants without blessings we had nothing but now we got the full benefits amen we had no inheritance before but now we're the sons and daughters which song it says that we're we're the son now we're the sons and daughters seem like there's a song we've been singing lately that we were the beggars now yeah that's what i'm thinking we were the beggars now we're royalty i think it's kind of that one we were the prisoners now we're roman free by god's grace one of those songs ephesians chapter 3 thank the lord jesus amen so much to thank him for i'm singing to that scripture this week and how deuteronomy 28 said therefore he said god said because you did not serve the lord your god with joyfulness and gladness in the heart therefore you will serve your enemies which i'll send against you so it was just an encouragement to me i always want to praise god and be joyful i always want to serve god it's a joy to pray it's a joy to come to the house of god our flesh doesn't think so but our soul does and we've got to bring that bodiness objection amen so we thank the lord for that ephesians 3 what a beautiful revelation it was not made known before the church ages they had no idea about this mystery none they just thought it was always going to be jews but god revealed it to paul the pharisee of the pharisees what a what a revelation verse 4 let's read verse 4 and we'll read well let me read four and five and then we'll all read six okay let me read four and five myself whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit so they just cannot understand it i heard a man today said when the jews in the old testament looked at prophecy they saw mountaintops they saw the coming of christ they saw the millennium they saw the future home but it's like they missed the gentile part the church ages because it was hidden from them it's like that was the that was the valleys all they could see was the mountains and the white throne judgment right daniel saw the white throne judgment and jesus sitting on his throne the son of man and it was hidden all those valleys were hidden from them they could only see the mountain peaks for the gentile people i'm sorry for the jewish people israel but god hid it but he made it known by the apostle paul let's read verse six together on three one two three that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen let's go to uh sorry psalm 24. psalms 24 7. let's read this together on three one two three lift up your heads o ye gates and be lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory salah let's have one more word of prayer here heavenly father we love you we bless your holy name you died for us we know you love us now help us lord to love you more we know your love will never change towards us lord god there's nothing that can separate us from your love thank you god for such an amazing promise now lord help us to love you more help us to die to ourselves lord god and walk in the spirit lord god crucifying the lust of the flesh and the affections thereof that we might produce the fruits of the holy spirit bless the saints that press their way out to the house of god we appreciate their great sacrifice in the in the middle of the week lord god and we pray you'll bless them abundantly also bless the saints listening and father may the holy spirit have preeminence in our hearts and lives and and just direct every word to where it needs to go in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i want to just uh kind of start back to where we left off we kind of ended with the uh the the liberties and so i just wanted i just had a few more things to say about christian liberties uh we ended last week with numerous scriptures about that so i just want to say that god as we saw last week uh with this with this revelation god uh god destroyed any separation right he destroyed he eliminated any uh discrimination we said now remember god purposely discriminated israel and abraham so he could teach them it would be a school master to bring them to christ to show them that they couldn't earn salvation right they were going to show them through all the multitudes of sacrifices at one point god told isaiah what is this multitude of sacrifices to me he said it's a stink in my nostrils right think about all these animals that had to die because of the sins of israel but god was using it as a teacher to show them that they couldn't earn it animal blood could never wash away sins but the blood of jesus christ could wash away sins amen and that's what it was teaching and we saw last week how god loves variety we know he gives us uh uh he gives us differences in the foods we eat uh also the the holy days we observe uh wine and jewelry okay so we looked at that last week a little bit and then we kind of ended uh i might have i think i stopped the live stream but we kind of ended on some some uh some issues that may relate to us a little more like sometimes we discriminate against the poor right or someone rich walks in you can tell right away we treat them extra special right or we may do that hopefully we don't but we might do that we might fall short of god's glory because remember peter was a holy ghost-filled man and yet he separated himself from the gentiles right for a short time he and he even influenced barnabas to do that we must be careful about our influence that we have with others right so we see that that was one that we could relate to oh rich people are on the message they might get better uh better treatment also if your name uh is near branham or if you're related to branham or are related to a well-known preacher you might get some preferences right you might get treated a little better also maybe if people don't smell as good as others or don't take care of themselves or brush their teeth like they ought to we say the more dirty people the people that don't keep hygiene they might not get treated as well but see the love of jesus christ is what separates us right from uh that makes us actually the true bride of christ because jesus said my disciples are known by their love one for another and while some of these people that come amongst us maybe the extra rich or those that have a name or those that are not clean or don't brush their teeth or uh they don't take care of themselves uh they may not be christ's people right but we're still to love our enemies so no matter what whether they're in the body of christ or whether they're enemies to christ we are to show them some level of love now you also got to balance that with paul who we ended with last week he gave us permission separate yourselves from those that cause division so we can separate from people and yet still love them sometimes love is tough right but you know real christian love though should also be sweet at times paul calls it tenderhearted so sometimes we have tough love but many times we need to have tender hearted love praise god that's what we forget sometimes as messages message people we hear so much love is correct love is correct and that's true but sometimes we need to remember love is tenderhearted too praise god uh so we remember that uh sometimes love speaks words of grace right word seasoned with grace and not so uh not not so hurtful or we say maybe direct uh so we have to remember that and keep that in mind now see so so christians today that come into christianity but yet they're eastern christians they will probably make different choices than you and i on food holy days wine and jewelry right they may do that okay so if we hear about you know eastern christians worshiping different than us we must be not quick to judge see message people if they're not careful they get quick to judge i'm talking about judging their souls right we're supposed to judge fruits we just preached on that recently right we're to judge fruits but we're also we should be wise enough to to not judge people's souls and just and judge is this a liberty or are they actually breaking the word of god right and these are some of the areas uh that we may see people differ than us so instead of being quick to judge we should reach out and love and seek to understand we should ask questions right like i did with the jeffersonville like the prophet the prophet's sons i reached out to them with questions first i got answers from joseph i didn't get any from billy paul that's fine they don't have to you know they're kind but we should seek to understand first before we uh make any official statements right or judging unless the holy spirit would give us some certain insight like a discernment spirit okay and as paul said we must respect others convictions and be thankful they're trying their best to worship jesus right because we can be confident that if god started the work of salvation in their lives then god will finish it just like he's doing in our lives amen think about when you first came the message did you have everything figured out i still don't but i'm very thankful for what god did show me at the beginning right and i'm still learning and as i said i haven't changed many doctrines but i'm learning to have a more uh a more patient mindset towards people and not quick to judge because god does give areas of liberty and if we're sensitive to the holy spirit we'll continue uh to be guided into all truth right now today there's a lot of there's just a lot there's a few message churches that are now bringing jewish traditions into their worship which is fine they're allowed to do that like we have friends that have visited us before that do that i've talked with their pastor on text never face to face or never over the phone but through text and he told me how they they dance they have dance they have the young girls have a dance team and they got the long dresses on and they got flags and they'll dance in front of the churches and and he told me lots of message people have condemned them for having girls dance on a dance team but the bible says praise the lord with dancing amen so he encouraged me you know to that's when i had my my daughters in the dance class you know they don't do it anymore because they're covered in different you know they don't want to that's fine but there's nothing wrong with uh with a choreographed dance right just like there's nothing wrong with a choreographed song special right is that right and that's how the jews dance was it was choreographed many times right they just and that's what the brothers showed me show me videos and that you know the women would all dance together they'd they'd go in a circle they'd all be in a circle and they'd some of them would have tambourines and they'd have a certain step and they would kick and you know they just had their own cultural dances what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that right just like today a lot of message churches do those plays right they do the holy ghost plays brother and call them a holy ghost play what's wrong with that that's all choreographed right and that's not even really singing all the time or it's not even preaching it's just telling a story it's storytelling what's wrong with that well nothing that's their liberty as a christian but we can never let like stories uh storytelling or any of these things that can never take the place of the preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the gospel is the power of god unto salvation amen like you can't let the songs take have more prayers than the preaching songs are good that's how we stay in the holy spirit the bible says speak yourselves in psalms and spiritual songs and hymns making melody in your heart to the lord right through singing but it can never take the place of the preaching of the word the bible said wow they peter yet spake the words the holy ghost fell on them that heard the word of god amen so see that's how the baptism of the holy ghost falls but anyways message believers today that are messianic they have that right i've seen and then the brother told me he said they celebrate like a feast of tabernacles uh purim you know they celebrate those but like they don't take the whole seven days like jews do they'll take a weekend and do that they'll set up booths you know and they'll go sit in the booth but then at the end of the day they actually go home that's not how the jews did it the jews actually slept in the booths because it was a it was a reminder that they were in uh tabernacles right god brought them out of egypt as a reminder they didn't have permanent homes for a while they were sojourners and strangers right it was a reminder of that and it's also to point forward and remind them that god is going to tabernacle with his people amen the holy city of god is going to come down to earth from heaven the new jerusalem amen it's god tabernacling with his people amen so what's wrong with that what's wrong with a brother keeping a nazarite vow nothing paul did it but at some point he needs to cut that hair right because it's a shame for them to have long hair and so we have to look at these liberties and the kosher diet like like that church they don't eat meat some of them don't eat meat yet brother branham ate squirrel right he shoots squirrels he says it's from the best tasting meat i don't know i've never had squirrel but they believe brother brown's a prophet and yet they have enough liberty to let brother man eat his squirrel meat but they won't eat meat or they won't eat pork right they'll eat the other meat cattle you know steak because that's that's uh un that's clean to god from the old testament but what's wrong with that nothing's wrong with that they have their liberty to do that now it's wrong if they think they're more holy than us right if we eat squirrel meat let's say i don't but let's say you did they're not more holy because they sit in t and boost you know throughout the day uh they're in august or i'm sorry it's uh september uh that doesn't make them more holy right what makes us holy is the holy spirit praise god and walking in the spirit that's what makes us holy right being born again in the soul and then keeping your mind holy that's what makes you holy so i want to just say that that there's there's a numerous message churches which is fine they're bringing in some of these jewish traditions like for passover they'll they've researched how did the jews actually set the table and so they set up their tables like that and on that thursday night before uh uh monday thursday they called i think they set up the passover they have passover like the jews would well that's fine that's their liberty to do that right just like paul kept the vow we saw that in acts 18 a few weeks ago with the children's bible study these are no longer required under the law but paul was the one who said we're not under the law yet he kept the nazirite battle so he so see he was showing that he has liberty to express his faith through his personal convictions amen remember paul said i have become all things to all men so one of the reasons he may have kept that vow was because the jews around there in jerusalem he wanted to show them that he was a brother that he still accepted their faith and and they were christians right that made that may have been one of the reasons he said to those with with the law i became as those with the law to those without the law i became as without the law right i became all things to all men that i might win some amen praise god so the very man that said we're no longer under these laws he would keep some of them uh to be a light to other people how many can see the wisdom of god in that god gave him the bulk of the new testament and yet he would keep some of the vows and everything like that so see church as the jews chinese muslim hindus all come to christ by the thousands we should rejoice that they're coming respect their liberties right and then if it ever comes to us to help them understand we'll help them understand like aquila and priscilla amen if it's ever our duty god calls us to correct somebody or they ask us questions i get questions all the time on youtube so maybe me i get emails all the time and maybe me might be you you you might uh answer someone's question why do you they might they might watch our service why do you do this like i get asked all the time why do we have a picture of jesus uh isn't that idolatry and i say no the very god that said don't make an image said set up two cherubims and then they're they're usually they're usually consent by that just like brother branham use that same scripture to make people content there's nothing wrong with that as long as we know that's not jesus jesus is in heaven right his spirit's in heaven and his spirit's in us praise god and we don't bow down or worship it's just a reminder and i like that reminder i like looking over there every now and then every service and reminding me that he's present right here amen it's just a little reminder to my eyes amen and so we have that liberty to do that that doesn't condemn us to have a photograph or a picture so what it really comes down to is now as western christians in the western hemisphere we have to humble ourselves and realize we're ignorant about many middle eastern things i'll be the first to say it i'm one of the most ignorant what do i know about jewish traditions what do i know about eastern or asian traditions nothing i don't know anything and many gospel stories can't be understood unless you know the culture of the jews right like the wedding garments why would why would why would that why would the father kick out the man for not having a wedding garment because it was a disgrace that man's having a wedding for a son he bought all these brand new garments and you're going to turn down his beautiful garment he wants you to look your best when his son gets married and if you won't do that that's an act of disrespect just like in ghana the greatest compliment you can do is give somebody clothes i read that one time and so brother william got us close that's a great compliment amen that's a great cultural compliment right that's the same thing you see in the jewish tradition i'm giving you a new garment because my son you are my honored guest i'm honoring you to witness the marriage of my son remember the wine bottles we never would have understood the wine bottles unless broadband would have told us how the jews treat wine bottles right we thought what difference does it make if you put wine in a new bottle road bottle well an old bottle's already stretched out it can't stretch out anymore so you need a new bottle right how about the bridegroom coming at midnight how would you have sisters like that if if you would uh uh i don't think they would like that how would you sisters are like that if the husband could have came and said oh it's wedding time it's midnight and you had to have your dress ready you had to have your hair ready you had to have your veil ready i don't know what everything they need but you had all that ready and you didn't know when he was coming now look at the look at the westerners we know exactly the the hour we got it all lined up on a sheet it's all going to happen like this god was opposite see so see how we we just can't understand some things like that i remember down in south america i told you that we sat there and it was opposite the brother sat there on the front row he said like right here and he's sweating it out you know it's like 100 degrees there he's sweating out he's got a suit and tie on he just saw he don't look happy at all he's just sitting there like when is his sister gonna show up we sat there for an hour or two waiting for this sister to drive up and pretty soon we heard honking horns and this here comes the bride with all of her friends she's got the bridesmaids with her and then finally he stands up and then here comes the bride and they they do the wedding and i'm like boy that's a long way so it's switched in south america at least in that part in guyana the brother sits there and waits he's all sweating it out and he's just waiting for the bride to come but see uh we have to respect these and understand that we must be meek because jesus said to learn of me you must be meek and lowly of heart so this mystery shows again god breaks down all discrimination and if there's ever a time the people of god should have love it's right now amen because all these mysteries have been revealed amen they're all the mystery of god is amen hallelujah and so the love of god is shut abroad in our hearts and if any time we should have walls broken down and the love of god should flow out of us right now amen hallelujah now for my next few minutes give me a half hour here that'll be about 45 minutes now i'm going to start getting into the the deeper scriptures on this revelation i thought it would be most interesting to start with uh how for us the mystery is how could jews it's kind of flipped right how could jews come into the message how could jews how can they bring their their culture into the message of the hour because it's switched because gentiles receive the message first and so we have to understand it that way but in the in the bible days it was opposite how could god bring filthy gentiles into this holiness right so let's get your bibles ready let's do some uh some reading here lydia can you get exodus 12 37 and 38. malachi can you get um second chronicles 2 17. so lydia exodus 12 37 38 malachi 2 chronicles 2 verse 17. so now let's start getting into the biblical evidence for the revelation about jews and gentiles composing one church one church now before we read this keep that up there but before we just let me just say remember god had handpicked abraham to start a holy nation a kingdom of priests right that's what moses eventually said those 400 or 500 years after abraham god had had enough they they you know mankind ruined it at the tower of babel you know he flooded the earth he gave them another chance and they all said let's all be one so god said you got the wrong idea i'm going to scatter you over the face of the earth all mankind is just destitute i'm gonna find one man that will be my friend amen that was abraham praise god and god called abraham unto himself and made his seed exclusive from all other nations in the abrahamic covenant abraham we know had two seeds isaac and ishmael the promise went to isaac who meant laughter i like that laughter god made him laugh there's the joy of the lord hallelujah who have the promises the one with joy isaac amen isaac had the promises that was the seed of abraham amen the true spiritual seed of abraham and so god narrowed it down to abraham and then god narrowed it down to isaac seed not ishmael's seed and then even in isaac seed he had jacob and esau then he narrows it down again to jacob and not esau and esau had a great nation come out too right so see god was he was just narrowing it down and eventually showing that man's not going to be able to keep the commands so i've got to open it back up to everybody amen i found a man i love abraham he's a godly man uh he's my friend but i'm going to show him in his seat that they can't keep the commands i'm going to show them this and then and then i'm going to open the door of faith to the gentiles i'm going to open up to the whole world i'm going to pull out a bride unto myself from every nation tongue kindred and people amen hallelujah glory now jacob's family went into egypt with 75 people and they come out with millions so lydia read exodus can you read that for us amen this is where we get about two million people if just the brothers were six hundred thousand and many of them had wives and many offspring you know if you just double the brothers and everybody's got a wife right there's a million right a million two hundred right two hundred thousand million two hundred thousand well then you got little kiddies running around there all those little babies right multiplying all the all over the place and god remember god blessed them when uh pharaoh tried to destroy them god blessed them more amen god opened up the wounds and wounds even more to bless his people make them stronger on the way out now look at god does he blesses the people he brings them out of egypt right now once they come out we know we're looking at the joshua series he takes them into the promised land and gives them a prophet joshua they go into judges and then kings uh by the time we get to the days of solomon there are many many gentiles so malachi can you read that second chronicles 2 17. amen now look at that church look at that they came out of egypt with about 2 million all hebrews fast forward 500 years later they have uh 153 000 gentiles among them right now god had prepared them and said you're going to start getting some gentiles that was in uh actually that was through abraham genesis 17 12. i'll read it out of my bible here i just flip to it real quick and he that is eight days old should be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in his house or bought with the money of a stranger which is not of thy seed so god starts planting these thoughts in abraham's mind you're going to get some people in your house that aren't your seed they're strangers they're sojourners right and then verse 27 says and all the men of his house born in his house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him so god said abraham as long as you circumcise them they can stay these gentiles can stay praise god and 500 years after that when abraha i'm sorry when solomon was ruling they're already up to 153 000 gentiles so we they have to all the gentile men have to be circumcised and they enjoyed many of the privileges of the law but they could not be priests right because the priest had to be the child of abraham i'm sorry the seed of levi sorry the seed of levi that was in uh the scripture that's in leviticus 22 10. so can you read that please or pull it up there i'll read it leviticus 22 10. so gentiles could start getting close to god remember we talked about that with the waters of separation they could come to the outer court my but they could never get into that holy place oh church state aren't you glad church you don't you're not kept outside god invites you and aren't you glad that veil was torn amen oh honey you are not kept out you are invited in amen glory they were purposely kept out they i'm so glad to live in this hour amen i know it's hard i know we got trials i know we got you know laodicean age but at least we can get into god's presence all the way amen we don't have to be a certain kind of race or a certain kind of family as long as we're in god's family we can go to the outer court the holy place and we can dwell and live in the presence of god almighty oh thank the lord what a blessing leviticus 22 10 there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of the priests or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing remember brother adam said you're feasting on the body word of the son of man amen you're feasting on the mysteries of god brother said it's this last day shoe bread that we're feeding on amen they couldn't eat of it but the gentile today feasts on the living word of god jesus said i am that bread he said i'm that living bread that was come down from heaven amen hallelujah i just read that this week john chapter six beautiful so gentiles could be a part they had to be circumcised they could stay in the outer core they could get forgiveness of sins but they could not get into the holy place or the holiest they had to observe the sabbath according to deuteronomy 5 verse 14 they had to keep the passover laws according to exodus 12 19 and they had to rejoice on feast days according to deuteronomy 16 verses 11 and 14 and they had to be purified ceremonially through the red heifer's waters of separation in numbers 19 verse 10. praise god so as even though it seemed like god was keeping all the gentiles out he was gracious and he had a way if they really wanted to get in they could get into the promises of god but they were still kept at a distance my what a what a thing what a thing what a picture that we get god was basically saying now you can come pretty close but you better stop right there church our our walk with god we should never feel like that we should never feel like god's saying oh you can't come any closer we should always hear jesus saying you i want you to come closer i want to know you more praise god i want to i want every door of your heart to be open right but in the old testament he said you can come this far and that's it but jesus says come unto me all you that weary and are heavy laden and i'll give you rest for your souls amen even said let the little children come unto me amen hallelujah and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of god the little children let them come unto me praise god now god chose many gentiles to use in prominent ways like rahab right rahab was the uh great great grandmother of david we've been looking at her in the joshua series right she was a harlot but god by grace purified her through that outer court and then brought her in the very lineage of jesus christ and out of rahab came boaz boaz married ruth another gentile right and they had obed obed had jesse jesse had david right so both rahab and ruth gentiles they don't belong into it but they're married into it and they're brought into the holiest sea lion amen showing that the most important seed line is the spiritual seed of god aren't you glad that your soul can hold the very spiritual seed of god amen hallelujah when we say royal blood flowing through our veins we don't mean a natural blood we mean spiritual life amen the life of god is flowing through our soul it's flowing out of our mind and it flows out into our praise it flows out into our worship it shows we are the children of god we look just like god amen we look just like jesus because his life flows through our body it flows through all parts of us amen we are vessels we're temples jesus bought us we are temples of the holy ghost and we must not frustrate the grace of god hallelujah i like uriah the hittite did you know he's a gentile oh my we know he was slain that david could take his wife on sadly but before that he was one of david's mighty men imagine that he wasn't holy enough to come into the holy holy place or the holy s of holies but he was holy enough to defend david praise god to fight david's battles amen he also became a chief officer or of the mighty men as well this wasn't some you know weak guy this was some strong man a gentile who by grace was brought into the promises of god and few people had loyalty like uriah had remember david tried to get him drunk and say well go see your wife remember that he said how can i go uh be with my wife when the armies of israel are fighting the lord's enemies oh he was so loyal amen he had such a warrior's heart praise god he carried his own death sentence can i say like that he carried that own death sentence back to the general and then he sent him into the very heat of the battle what a warrior and this guy wasn't even a jew right and no doubt the lord loved uriah praise god he exalted him as a general as an example to us he fought the lord's battles that's what we should do fight the lord's battles amen he had extraordinary devotion to jehovah that's what we need hallelujah that's how our lives should show forth extraordinary devotion to jesus christ hallelujah thank the lord amen that's why i don't feel bad when people criticize me for writing books or making videos i don't feel bad it's just my devotion to jesus they might even be jealous i don't know they might even be critical i don't know why they would be do why they'd feel that way but we should be so devoted paul said make your i'm sorry peter said make your calling an election sure in other words do something for jesus amen brother said if you can only get one soul saved get somebody saved amen do something for the kingdom of god show your devotion show your extraordinary love for god can i say like this we all have phones right all you gotta do is when we're listening to a sermon we gotta click two buttons send i'm sorry share you gotta click share and then type in an address and send that's all you got three buttons a click and we can share the word of god right look how that's devotion right that's devotion being able to share god's word or just send somebody a text message you can you can just talk to your phone right and say uh hey phone send the text to so-and-so say i'm praying for you i love you god bless you that's how easy it is right to show extraordinary devotion to god and encourage the saints right and try to help them and be a blessing to them that's how easy we can do it that reminds me sister naomi we want to share a good song with you it's by charity gale i forgot to send that to you this week it's called thank you jesus for the blood applied so i want to share that with you after service isn't it wonderful children man i started crying i was worship i was saying it i sing like two hours in a row every morning this week when i was studying and praying and doing you know my finances and everything like that i just want to share that i got to share that with sister naomi she's going to like that i think i share it with brother amen too i got to share with the saints i share with cam and simon yeah that's right so we want to build each other up right we want to have extraordinary devotion to god and to jesus we want to fight the lord's battles amen hallelujah thank god now i got about 15 minutes here so let's jump in the next section that's the first section there i just want to show how god had a provided way for gentiles if they wanted to come in and inherit some of these promises and these blessings they could do it but they had to come god's provided way now let's look at prophecy church so uh let's get some readers there haven you want to read nature you want to read all right haven uh genesis 12 verse 3 haven nature galatians 3 verse 8. so haven genesis 12 3 and nature galatians 3 verse 8. now i want to look at uh tonight we'll probably finish with this thought let's look at prophecy that foretold that god would open the gospel to the gentiles now i love this because all these scriptures were laying before him and it's like it just went over their head it's like god just put blinders god put blinders on the prophets and they couldn't see that the gentiles were coming in they read these every week right it's kind of like jesus right the bible says uh jesus told them over and over again the son of man is going to go to jerusalem i'm going to give my life i got to die i'm going to be committed in the hands of sinful men but i'll raise on the third day and the bible said they didn't understand it because god was hiding it from them oh let me say like this lord if there's anything hidden from me please reveal it to me amen i want to know and i'll lay before you in prayer i'll lay before here you before you in church i want to know the wisdom of god amen i want to know god's secrets praise god but it was hidden from them so they couldn't see it the prophets couldn't see it the disciples couldn't see it it shows god has a time and season for everything amen now haven uh genesis 12 3 the first prophet who foretold of the gentiles coming in was the god prophet god go ahead haven genesis 12 3. amen great job haven we're not gonna clap first time but we love you okay we'll save that one for later uh galatians 3 8 nature got that one galatians 3 8 starts with and the scripture foresee great reading nice job wonderful so the who prophesied first of the gentiles coming into the blessings of god it was god himself amen i like that paul said god preached before the gospel unto abraham so that scripture is the gospel in thee abraham shall all families of the earth be blessed thank god i'm a son of abraham amen i see the blessings of god on my life i see it naturally i see it spiritually that's all possible because god prophesied that i'd be part of it amen oh hallelujah thank god amen god foretold it praise god amen now for human prophets foretold of it as well at least so when i wrote this chapter for some reason uh i guess the first ones i found i found four of them right away there's possibly more okay there's possibly more so the four prophets are david isaiah hosea and jeremiah all foretold the gospel coming to the gentiles david twice says all nations would worship the lord oh hallelujah psalm 22 verse 27 can you pull it out there 22 verse 27 chapter 22 verse 27 psalm i'm sorry psalm 22 27. all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord look at that they're going to all the ends we'll turn to the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee so the jews reading that they'd be like that's interesting they just move on they wouldn't catch somehow that oh god's going to have grace on the gentiles they would they would think oh well the world's going to be full of jews then right because we're self-centered people right that's just how humans are everything revolves around us oh the whole world's gonna praise the lord there's no gonna be no more gentiles thank god we're just gonna have jews right but god was hiding it david was inspired to write it and god fulfilled it amen now he says it again in psalm 86 9 people psalms 86 9. david says it a second time all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and glorify thy name amen all nations so you would think they would have got it on this one but they didn't they must been thinking natural nations right i'm sorry no spiritual nation they must be thinking oh spiritual there's only one spiritual uh nation is israel they missed it it just wasn't known before until paul revealed the mystery oh my now let's look at isaiah isaiah has at least five references so get your fingers ready acacia yeah it'll be lightning fingers tonight isaiah 9 verse 2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shine oh aren't you glad church god called you out of death amen god called you out of the night time he shined his light on you now you see praise god you were in the valley of death we're talking about spiritual death some of us natural death right but many of us spiritual death and he shined his great light upon us to make us see his love and his goodness he didn't have to but he foretold he'd do it he's rich and mercy amen we didn't have covenant we'd have promises we have no blessings no nothing we were in darkness but he shined his great light upon us oh thank the lord thank you isaiah for giving us the word of the lord matthew 4 explains that this was fulfilled in jesus's ministry to the gentiles let's read that matthew 4 13. i'm going to take time on this because this is so beautiful i love how god anointed these new testament writers to pick up the understanding of the old testament and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the seacoast and the borders of zebulun and neph nephilim next verse 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulon land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galileo the gentiles in verse 16 where we're going the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region in shadow of death light has sprung up so jesus and his disciples went to gentile cities and the bible said they saw a great light amen they didn't see a beautiful man they saw a rather homely man jesus a little man but his love and his power and his healing was the light of god it shined brighter than any hollywood makeup could could make him shine right the love of jesus the power of god the humility of god and the power of the holy spirit is the greatest light you young people can shine don't worry about being fancy or dressed up or rich rich fancy clothes or makeup or anything like that don't worry about that jesus said no beauty that we would desire yet he was a great light amen remember church when he wasn't holding uh healing services he was in the synagogue teaching see i'm a teacher so i like i like to use that one because people say oh there's too much teaching we need more power well you gotta have both really you got it both right when jesus was not doing campaigns and healing the bible said he was in the temple or in the synagogues teaching the word of god that was still light right both are light his whole life was like everything he did was light amen we don't criticize jesus for teaching the word of god we praise him for it amen because it was a plan of god okay that's the first one from isaiah we'll try to finish isaiah now back to isaiah 11 verse 10 isaiah 11 verse 10. oh this is a beautiful scripture right here beautiful probably my favorite word right now right here it's my favorite word right here and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an end sign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious oh thank god amen who's rest david's right the seed of david right the root of jesse jesus jesus's rest would be glorious he said come unto me all you that labored heavy laden and i'll give you rest for your souls i'll give you christ in you the hope of glory amen hallelujah go to isaiah 28 uh yeah isaiah 28 12. thanks hon i forgot how fast you are you're really fast way faster than me to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear this scripture was fulfilled on the day of pentecost according to paul see the gentiles will have a glorious rest resting from their own labors right and working and laboring by the power of the holy ghost amen that's a testimony of my life any good that comes out of my life it was the laboring of the holy ghost right we're resting on him and as we surrender we just let christ work through us and it's jesus working through us we're resting in him but we're yielding our bodies and minds to his spirit and that's what's causing us to labor is the grace of god but our souls are resting on the promise of god oh thank the lord amen his rest is glorious our souls rest our souls are not warring and are my saved am i going to heaven am i going am i the bride or not our souls are not fighting our souls aren't rest our nature is at rest where's nature she's out there our nature is at rest our character is at rest praise god but we've got to yield to that spirit so we can labor and do god's will while we're on this earth amen and paul said i was giving and i was giving myself to be spent for you he said so paul's soul was that rest but his mind and his body were constantly laboring for the people he was spending his energy for the people of god that's what we should do amen so we see the gentiles rest will be glorious that's the baptism of the holy ghost jesus is the root of jesse third reference isaiah 42 isaiah 42 or read verse 1 i imagine because it's a long it's a long passage i'm always worried about that time i should say always sometimes isaiah 42 1 behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles now go to matthew 12 please matthew 12 14. so this scripture was fulfilled also matthew 12 14 through 21. i'm just going to take a brief look here in my my bibles my scriptures verse 15 but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from dense and great multitudes fouled him and he healed them all and charged him that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul as well please i'll put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the gentiles amen hallelujah amen all these miracles all these people jesus healed it was showing god's judgment to the gentiles right that god could judge sin right that god had already judged sin amen he's going to judge it through the blood of jesus praise god and provide healing for sin amen now go down to verse 21 and in his name shall the gentiles trust so now you have all these scriptures showing that everything jesus did it was also shining great light it was sent to the jews first we'll get to that lord willing next week but it also showed great light to the gentiles and the gentiles you and i should trust in jesus christ right that great light that he shined we trust in his light now i'm thinking of a scripture here before i forget uh let me turn to it real quick yeah there it is okay i don't want to miss this i kind of want to close with this all right uh isaiah 49 verse 6. you're doing a great job tonight in case you always do but i'm going to make sure i tell you that isaiah 49 6 and he said is it is a light thing that thou should just be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the friends of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth paul and barnabas quote this scripture in acts 13 47. now can you hop over there you're doing a great job i always get nervous when i'm typing and people want me to type i i'm backspace back to backspace i make all these mistakes you're good acacia you're pretty good for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light for the gentiles that thou should especially salvation unto the ends of the earth paul's saying in other words paul's saying i'm fulfilling this scripture today this scripture is fulfilled i am a light to the gentiles can i say like this you are a light to the gentiles in this age amen you are light praise god you might remember remember john was a shining bright light for a season and they were willing to rejoice in his light for a season i'm thankful church that we can rejoice in brother branham's light for a season amen because his light was jesus he's pointing us to there's only one life that's jesus christ he's the light of the world amen hallelujah ah that's beautiful finally the last isaiah scripture isaiah 60 verse 3. oh thank you lord so glad i'm walking in the light as he's in the light church we could have been walking in darkness i was walking in darkness but i've seen a great light oh thank you jesus hallelujah see i gotta laugh because if i don't laugh i'm gonna start crying right you start if you really if you really think of the depths i got to have some emotional outlet right if the bible said it's joy unspeakable and full of glory we got to have some outlet for this joy praise god and a merry heart make us good medicine right is that right virtue a happy hearts medicine to everybody else when you smile when you love the lord and you sing and worship the lord it's medicine to anybody that has a real sincere heart praise god the joy of the lord is medicine that's usually what happens i usually laugh during the sermon because i'm so happy i usually not always and then i'll cry at the end because i'm finally just like i gotta get it out oh my goodness gracious i love jesus all i can say is thank you jesus for saving my soul praise god i was a wretch but he reached out his hand for me isaiah 60 verse 3 and the gentiles shall come to thy light and the kings to the brightness of thy rising for the prophets oh there's no way the gentiles ah now that's a spiritual meaning or maybe they just maybe just they just read over it and it just didn't even register because god blended their spiritual eyes but the bible said this was not known that god was going to say look at this over 2000 almost 2000 years now right almost 2 thousand years we're almost at 2000 years because it was 80 30. wow we're so close my goodness we're so close but they couldn't see it until paul pointed out in the word and it was time to be revealed god has a time and season for forever aren't you glad god no matter what stage of life you're in god has something special for that season every season has something special right who doesn't like you like yeah you like eating snow you children i've seen all you eat snow out there who doesn't like win i mean there's good things about winter right there's something good about every season do you jump in leaves girls do you jump in leaves when it's when the leaves are falling yeah look at that thumbs up so fall has great things summer you like going swimming you like spraying yourself with the hose i know my girls do they always spray they'll spray themselves with a hose you can and this is spring we love spring we love the weather there's something beautiful in every season praise god but brother man tells us the most beautiful one is death autumn because that's when they get those beautiful colors precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints that's gonna be that sermon i'm gonna preach lord willing here pretty soon the best is always yet to come now that's a condition though if you honor the lord the best is yet to come because people can start out right they can start running the race but then they can trot and underfoot the son of god afresh and they can lose their salvation so it's all on conditions uh acts 26 23 repeats this scripture uh isaiah 60 verse 3. so acts 23 or 26 3. so i'm sorry 26 23 mercy i'm trying to slow down acts 26 23 that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and show light unto the people and to the gentiles praise god let's stand uh but keep your bibles out musicians you can come keep your bibles out go to john 5 if you got your bibles how many want to manifest the light of god praise the lord how many want to be a light to the gentiles in your life now we want to be lights to jews and gentiles right but we don't not maybe around as many jews but we want to be a light to the gentiles we want to be a light to the jews well how do you be a light the same way jesus was a light john 5 19. can you pull that up there john 5 19. i was reading this this week and i was like oh what a blessing to read over this i you know we just forget about it but look what jesus said verily verily i say to you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for whatsoever things he doeth these also the sun likewise church can't you say amen to that that we can do nothing of ourselves jesus christ could not do anything of him his own self his own human mind right he had to wait to the father showed him and then he acted upon what the father showed him and then his works were blessed in other words he had to follow the leading of the holy spirit if any good was going to come out of his life hope that encourages you but go to verse 30 as well let's put ourselves in there bride of christ fellowship can do nothing of ourselves but when we're yielded to the holy spirit then god can do something in our lives look at verse 30 i can of mine own self do nothing see preachers say you know i'm not talking about messages but there could be they're trying to say oh you you're so great you're so great you're so great you know you're handsome right you're beautiful you're they're trying to build you up but jesus says i can't do anything and he wasn't handsome so no matter how much he claimed it he was never going to be handsome right oh my goodness the only way we'll ever do anything is yielding to the holy spirit obeying what god tells us to do and thankfully church all we gotta do is open up this book and ten times out of ten we're gonna hear god's voice telling us what to do like i like that preacher he said you wanna hear god's voice he said uh he said you wanna hear god's audible voice just open up his bible start reading it out loud you'll hear god's voice right the voice of his word you want to get a uh you want to hear hear god speak to you he said read it out loud or have the have the computer play the bible out loud you hear god's voice in other words you hear his mind may not hear the literal voice but you hear the mind of christ because it's found right here in the word let's stand here are you encouraged tonight by god's grace he oh he foretold this for 1500 years he foretold this almost 2 000 years before told i'm going to show the gentiles the light you're going to be blessed through abraham praise god you won't be cursed you'll be blessed amen what a promise the church the best part is it doesn't go over our heads this is not hidden to us praise god there are some things hidden to us right now like the day in the hour of the rapture the new name of jesus the name of my god and the city of my god there may be some mystery to that jesus's new name but this is not into us this is for us to know right now amen lord [Music] let's pray let's ask the holy spirit to work through us to show us what he wants us to do each and every day [Music] jesus said of my own self i can do that i see that i do that i hear that i speak amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your word tonight thank you for the revelation of this mystery you've eliminated discrimination you you bought us lord with your blood of your
