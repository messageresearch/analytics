[0:04] James 5 verse 10.
[0:18] That will give me plenty of time to
[0:19] preach as well here by God's grace. I
[0:21] don't got to feel rushed. But I
[0:22] appreciate everybody supporting the the
[0:24] Lord, the work of the Lord here tonight
[0:25] by the grace of the Lord. James 5
[0:27] chapter 10. Remember that prophets are
[0:30] men who speak in the name of the Lord.
[0:32] Now, of course, there can be women
[0:33] prophets. Uh so those those sisters
[0:36] would speak in the name of the Lord. Uh
[0:39] but God never called of course a woman
[0:41] prophet to lead anyone as far as uh men.
[0:44] Uh so we understand that. But they could
[0:47] have a gift to prophesy, be a minor
[0:49] prophet gift. Uh not a major, not a
[0:51] leader type uh as we see with the rest
[0:54] of the scripture by God's grace. You
[0:56] know, Deborah had a gift to prophesy,
[0:58] but she wasn't the leader. She wasn't
[1:00] the spiritual leader. She was more like
[1:01] a judge, we'd say, like a judge down at
[1:03] the courthouse. And uh but she was not
[1:05] leading the people. They had the
[1:06] priesthood and they had the king as
[1:08] well. So, uh she was not leading the
[1:10] people in any way. She just had a gift.
[1:12] Praise God. How many How many grateful
[1:14] you have a gift? Hallelujah. There's
[1:15] some gift in your life God wants to use.
[1:17] He's probably already used it before.
[1:19] He'd like to use it again. How many know
[1:20] that he wants to use the gifts he's
[1:23] given to us? Praise God. So James
[1:25] chapter 5:10. Let's read this if we can.
[1:27] Ready? 1 2 3. Take my brethren the
[1:31] prophets who have spoken in the name of
[1:33] the Lord for an example of suffering,
[1:36] affliction, and of patience. Amen. May
[1:39] God add his blessing to Reena's word.
[1:41] You can be seated. I do have quotes to
[1:43] show. As I said, I've worked on this
[1:44] many times over the last few months. uh
[1:47] by God's grace.
[1:54] I was kind of hoping Jared would be here
[1:55] to hear this one, but God knows. God
[1:58] knows by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[2:01] So, we want to look at we have thus
[2:03] sayeth the Lord part three. How many
[2:04] know that we're a a privileged people on
[2:07] the earth? Praise God. Think of all the
[2:09] church uh all the churches out there
[2:11] that you've been to. Think of those
[2:13] maybe you haven't been to. How many can
[2:15] say that they have uh thus sayeth the
[2:18] lords from a prophet who had lived
[2:21] recently? Very few can say that. Right?
[2:24] So we consider ourselves very privileged
[2:26] people. Most of us didn't go looking for
[2:29] this. It came looking for us. Praise
[2:31] God. If I if I remember Beatatric's
[2:33] testimony, it was she was walking by a
[2:35] message church. Was that right, Sister
[2:37] Beatatric? and then just wanted to go in
[2:39] and check it out because of the the
[2:41] worship and the the zeal and the sound
[2:44] of praise and everything. Uh just the
[2:46] worship caught her attention. Praise
[2:48] God. And then she gets in there and her
[2:50] life's officially changed. Hallelujah.
[2:52] Amen. Thank God for that. U you and I,
[2:55] we didn't go looking for the message.
[2:56] The message came looking for us.
[2:57] Hallelujah. It's the message of Jesus
[2:59] Christ, what he's done in this hour.
[3:01] Praise God. And even brother Angley knew
[3:03] Brother Brandham, right? Or knew of him
[3:04] by God's grace. He knew of him. Amen.
[3:06] Oh, you're doing well. Praise God.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Wonderful. That's so
[3:14] wonderful. Hallelujah. Then, brother uh
[3:16] Rod knows Max Manning. He was a brother
[3:18] that was uh prayed for by Brother
[3:20] Brandham. Is he still alive, brother?
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Praise God.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:37] Amen.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[4:06] Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Let's thank the Lord for
[4:10] that. Amen. Hallelujah.
[4:13] That's so wonderful. I just love how God
[4:16] had already given brother Rod some uh
[4:18] fellowship with people who knew about
[4:19] Brother Ram's ministry even before we
[4:21] met. So I thank the Lord.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, you did? Okay. I didn't know that.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Awesome. So, we feel united on
[4:33] this by God's grace. Amen. So, we have
[4:36] Thus Say the Lord part three. And uh if
[4:38] Jared was going to be here, I had this
[4:40] slide in case he was going to be here.
[4:41] You know, when I when I preach some
[4:42] sermons, there's numerous types of
[4:44] sermons. There's more than four kinds of
[4:45] sermons, but uh tonight would be a
[4:48] topical sermon, which is when you take a
[4:50] subject and you use different verses
[4:53] from all over the Bible, right? Uh now,
[4:56] a lot of people today uh well, not a lot
[4:58] of people, but serious Christians like
[5:01] this type of preaching as well. It's
[5:02] called expository sermons because that's
[5:04] that's that's what brother Jared did. He
[5:06] took a text and he just he didn't leave
[5:08] that text. He just stayed in that text
[5:10] and explained it. Now, of course, he
[5:12] would reference other scriptures, but
[5:13] the whole point is to teach through a
[5:14] chapter or teach through a section of
[5:17] verses and just explain those with the
[5:19] rest of the Bible. Praise God. Now, a
[5:21] textual sermon focuses on a short text
[5:24] or just one scripture and not not a
[5:27] whole topic of like a topic throughout
[5:29] the whole Bible. So, like last week, we
[5:31] looked at we wrestle not against flesh
[5:32] and blood. So, that was again a a
[5:34] topical sermon, right? Because we went
[5:35] from Jacob and then we went to the New
[5:37] Testament, right? the the unjust judge
[5:39] and the widow woman. You know, we were
[5:40] in different places around the Bible.
[5:42] And then Ephesians chapter 6, wrestling
[5:43] not against flesh and blood. So, that
[5:46] was more of a topical sermon as well.
[5:48] And it seems like brother Ram done a lot
[5:49] of these by God's grace. Uh brother did
[5:51] a lot of these. Now, the church ages in
[5:53] the seven seals, brother Ram did
[5:54] expository preaching. Hallelujah. He
[5:57] taught every single verse from
[5:59] Revelation 1 all the way to the end of
[6:01] Revelation chapter 3. uh and then he
[6:04] took Revelation 6 and Revelation 8 and
[6:07] preached the seven seals by God's grace.
[6:09] Beautiful testimony there. Now, a
[6:11] narrative is like a sermon that tells a
[6:13] Bible story and draws lessons from it.
[6:16] Uh so, it's more of like a storytelling
[6:18] uh method as well or theme uh by God's
[6:21] grace. So, tonight I was if brother
[6:22] Jared was here, I was going to tell him
[6:23] this is topical because he probably used
[6:25] to expository, right? And so, I do
[6:28] expository. I was I've been preaching
[6:29] through First Corinthians, but I've
[6:30] taken a long break because I had the
[6:32] summer and had all these different
[6:33] thoughts come to me, but eventually I'll
[6:35] get back to it by the grace of the Lord.
[6:37] Um, and so just we've we've gone two
[6:40] parts here and thus sayith the Lord or
[6:42] we have thus sayith the Lord. Brother
[6:44] Ram gave us thus sayith the Lord on the
[6:46] interpretation of the church ages,
[6:49] the seven seals, Malachi 45 and 6,
[6:53] Revelation 10:7. So, uh, these two
[6:56] especially relate to his ministry. This
[6:59] is more chi church history,
[7:01] understanding church history with thus
[7:03] sayeth the Lord. And of course, exposing
[7:05] the antichrist. We heard that on Sunday
[7:06] again. Wonderful message there from
[7:07] brother Simon by God's grace. Church
[7:10] ages uh reveals Jesus Christ through the
[7:12] 2,000-year church ages. Marriage and
[7:14] divorce. We have thus sayith the Lord on
[7:16] that. Uh modest clothes, clothing and
[7:18] hair length uh from 1 Timothy 2 and 1
[7:21] Corinthians 11. The baptism of the Holy
[7:23] Ghost. We see that in Colossians chapter
[7:25] 1, Acts chapter 1. And brother Bam said
[7:28] classical preaching is of the devil. So
[7:31] educational preaching where you don't
[7:33] preach against sin and just watering it
[7:36] down so everybody can receive it. But
[7:38] Ram says that's of the devil. And if
[7:40] that was bad in his day, it's a million
[7:42] times worse today, right? We're we're
[7:44] aware of that because it just allows
[7:46] people to come to church, but it doesn't
[7:47] challenge them to change their life. It
[7:49] doesn't convict them. It wouldn't call
[7:52] it wouldn't even call them a fool. Like
[7:53] Jesus called his own disciples fools,
[7:56] &gt;&gt; slow to believe,
[7:58] &gt;&gt; right? So this type of classical
[7:59] preaching, it doesn't preach against
[8:01] sin. Doesn't call anybody any names or
[8:03] anything. And I'm not advocating for
[8:05] name calling. I'm just saying Jesus did
[8:07] it.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus did it. Not giving a
[8:10] license for every preacher to call
[8:11] names, but John the Baptist called him a
[8:13] brood of serpents, right? A den of
[8:15] snakes. And so there there's times, you
[8:17] know, you you uh as a preacher, you try
[8:20] to yield to the Holy Spirit, but
[8:22] classical preaching is more just like
[8:23] tickling the ears preaching,
[8:25] &gt;&gt; right? Like the Bible says itching ears.
[8:28] There it is, brother. Amen. Thank you.
[8:29] And then brother Ram said, "God won't
[8:31] deal with his church. I'm talking about
[8:32] he's talking about the whole church
[8:33] denomination until they come back to the
[8:35] message of the hour."
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Right? And we see that every
[8:38] denomination eventually falls away,
[8:40] loses conviction. Uh they try to they
[8:43] try to please the culture, right? rather
[8:45] than pleasing God. But brother Bam tells
[8:48] us we don't have to please anybody but
[8:50] God. Right? Even even as a pastor, I'm
[8:53] not to try to please you. I'm only
[8:54] trying to please God. Hallelujah.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Right, brother Chris?
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:02] Exactly right, brother. You're exactly
[9:04] right. Yes, sir. So many examples,
[9:06] right? Even with clothing and
[9:08] entertainment and politics, right?
[9:10] Trying to just please everybody, right?
[9:12] But we're not here to please anybody but
[9:14] God. Hallelujah.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Then brother Ram said, "Look at
[9:16] denominations. Thus sayith the Lord,
[9:18] look at the fruit they produced." Right?
[9:21] And I told you a testimony when I went
[9:24] to the chapel and I went to different
[9:25] churches. I saw the fruit of what they
[9:27] had produced. And as I grew in the Lord,
[9:30] I realized that's not the fruit I want
[9:32] to see in my life. There's got to be
[9:33] more fruit than that. Hallelujah. Amen.
[9:36] If there's a deep call, there's got to
[9:37] be a deep to respond. Praise God.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then brother man said on the day
[9:41] of Pentecost they were informal holy
[9:44] rollers. Thus sayith the Lord. In other
[9:47] words they weren't copying off of the
[9:49] Pharisees and Sadducees. They were being
[9:51] led by the Holy Ghost. Right? And so we
[9:53] want to get in the spot. Now we can see
[9:55] brother Ram's life, you know, in his
[9:56] testimony. A lot of his services have
[9:58] the same pattern, right? And and so
[10:01] we're allowed to get in a pattern. Of
[10:02] course we want a God-honoring pattern
[10:04] for our services. But we don't want to
[10:06] get stiff and starchy. We don't want to
[10:08] get denominational.
[10:09] We want to be open to praying for the
[10:11] Holy Ghost to move. Hallelujah.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not being in uh not being formal.
[10:16] Everything's the same every single
[10:18] service. We need to be uh led by the
[10:20] Holy Spirit to change things up.
[10:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[10:25] And then brother Ram said, "Thus sayith
[10:26] the Lord, there's only one prophet
[10:28] messenger in the Leodysian church age."
[10:30] So that would be his ministry. Other
[10:32] people have claimed to be messengers.
[10:34] Other people have claimed to be uh
[10:36] prophets at the end time. But thus
[10:38] sayith the Lord, there's only one
[10:40] because the Bible said uh that spirit of
[10:42] Elijah will anoint someone to turn the
[10:44] hearts of the children back to the
[10:46] apostolic fathers. There's only one.
[10:49] Now, Brother Ram uses 1 Corinthians 11
[10:52] uh to say any woman, I don't care how
[10:54] much she sings, dances, shouts, cries,
[10:57] speaks in tongues, prophesies, if she
[10:59] cuts her hair, she's not born again.
[11:01] Brother Random says that's true because
[11:04] the Bible says that she defrauds her
[11:06] husband, disgraces her husband if she
[11:08] cuts her hair, right? And and there's
[11:10] not one verse in the Bible where God
[11:12] ever says a woman should cut her hair. A
[11:15] godly woman,
[11:16] &gt;&gt; right? So that means that means all down
[11:18] through history, the godly woman, even
[11:19] think of Eve, think of how long her hair
[11:21] must have been. All these women down
[11:23] through the Bible had all had long hair.
[11:25] Praise God. Not one of them had bob hair
[11:27] like we see today.
[11:30] So, uh, that's thus sayith the Lord. Uh,
[11:33] and of course that's scriptural as well
[11:34] because she dishonors her husband that
[11:36] way. And then, uh, divorce and remarage.
[11:39] Brother Ram gives us thus sayith the
[11:40] Lord on that as well as we've talked
[11:42] about. There's only one cause for that.
[11:45] Uh, unconfessed fornication before
[11:47] marriage. And then, Brother Ram says
[11:49] denominational fruit. And I don't
[11:50] remember that one necessarily. I don't
[11:51] remember that one. But I do remember
[11:53] this one. Every nation was dominated by
[11:54] Satan. We see that numerous places.
[11:56] Daniel chapter 2. We see that in Matthew
[11:59] chapter 4 where Satan tells Jesus, "I'll
[12:01] give you the kingdom kingdoms of this
[12:03] world." Right?
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we see it today, of course, in the
[12:05] deep state, right? We can see how Satan
[12:07] is in control, right? Uh sad, but that's
[12:10] the truth. You know, uh all the murders
[12:12] and the abortions and the the woke
[12:16] agenda, all these things, Satan is in
[12:18] control, right? He's Satan dominates the
[12:21] government.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Now, so so far we got to 17. And
[12:24] remember says, remember who's speaking?
[12:27] He said, "Remember that I speak to you
[12:29] in the name of the Lord." Right? That's
[12:31] what the Bible says. The Bible says, "If
[12:32] a man speaks in the name of the Lord and
[12:34] it comes to pass, fear him. If he speaks
[12:36] in the name of the Lord and it doesn't
[12:37] come to pass, don't fear him."
[12:40] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Man spoke in the name of the
[12:42] Lord, it came to pass. It was true. So,
[12:44] we're to respect him. We're to listen to
[12:46] him, take what he says back to the word
[12:48] of God. Hallelujah. And I' I've I like
[12:51] that. I said, "Did any or has any other
[12:54] preacher spoke like this recently?" So
[12:56] many. That's already 17. I don't know
[12:58] how many times brother Angley did, but
[13:00] I'm sure if he did it, it was right
[13:01] every time if he did it. If he's a true
[13:03] man of God. Uh, but for me, I'm counting
[13:06] now. I'm counting 17. Now, we got some
[13:09] more. I think we'll get up to 27 here
[13:10] tonight by God's grace. If if time
[13:12] permits, you know how time goes. So, I
[13:16] have never heard any preacher talk like
[13:18] this. That's why when I heard brother
[13:19] Brandham, I started crying shortly
[13:21] after. I never heard a man talk about
[13:23] Jesus like that or his love for the Lord
[13:25] or what he had to endure to serve the
[13:27] Lord. And so I never heard a man preach
[13:30] like that today. To this day still, I've
[13:32] never heard a preacher preach like
[13:33] brother Brandham because he had the
[13:35] spirit of Elijah, the Holy Ghost that
[13:37] had the attributes like Elijah and
[13:39] Elisha and John the Baptist. Praise God.
[13:42] Amen. Now, uh I think I think tonight
[13:45] I'm going to skip this. I have this
[13:46] mainly for Jared or any other visitor.
[13:48] Uh I guess I'll just go fast here.
[13:51] Okay, so remember uh here's what I was
[13:53] saying. The test for a true prophet is
[13:55] when a prophecy comes to pass. Okay,
[13:57] Deuteronomy 18 20-22.
[14:01] Elijah when he would speak, he would
[14:02] say, "For thus sayeth the Lord God of
[14:04] Israel." So brother Ham will say, "Thus
[14:06] sayeth the Lord." Right? Ezekiel would
[14:09] say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, smite uh
[14:11] thine hand and stamp with thy foot." So
[14:14] he would he would smite his hands.
[14:16] Ezekiel would say and smite his foot and
[14:18] say, "Alas, all the evil abominations of
[14:20] the house of Israel." See, it wasn't fun
[14:23] to be a prophet.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Prophets a lot of times didn't say nice
[14:27] things.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet to rebuke the people,
[14:32] &gt;&gt; to warn the people, to reveal things to
[14:35] the people.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Most times they hated the prophets.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the same yesterday, today,
[14:40] and forever.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Ram's always balling out the
[14:43] immoral women. You know, he's always
[14:45] balling out weak men and weak pulpit
[14:48] because he was a prophet. Hallelujah.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; And most of the people are in a lost
[14:52] condition or deceived condition or a
[14:55] condition where they they're just
[14:57] scarcely saved.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Just scarcely saved.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he said, "For they shall fall
[15:03] by the sword by the famine and
[15:04] pestilence." And that's exactly what
[15:06] happened to the house of Israel. It was
[15:08] thus sayith the Lord, and it came to
[15:10] pass.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:13] Now, as uh as I was reviewing, remember
[15:16] God can change the thus sayith the Lord
[15:18] or allow his per I'm sorry to allow his
[15:20] permissive will. We saw that in two
[15:22] cases. So, whenever we judge brother
[15:24] Brandham or judge any prophet or give
[15:26] them the the prophet test, maybe the
[15:28] word judge stumbles people. Well, if
[15:30] that's the case, then we give them the
[15:32] prophet test, right? But the Bible said
[15:34] that we have to judge all the prophets.
[15:35] The Bible says that 1 Corinthians
[15:36] chapter 12 or 14, judge the prophets.
[15:41] Uh we saw that uh Isaiah gave a thus
[15:43] sayith the Lord and he was turned around
[15:45] walking out and God sent him back in say
[15:47] don't tell him I'll give him 15 more
[15:48] years. Right? And then numbers in
[15:51] numbers 22:12 God told Balam don't go.
[15:54] He goes back a few days later prays
[15:56] again God said go ahead and go.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; What God can God can change his mind? No
[16:02] God can't change his mind but God will
[16:04] give you over to his permissive will if
[16:05] you don't want his perfect will.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh now remember these four uh
[16:10] these four were were prophets. Uh and
[16:13] this proves not every word they say that
[16:15] comes out of their mouth is thus sayith
[16:17] the Lord. Okay we don't have to go
[16:19] through that. It's been a while. We
[16:20] preached the questions and answers back
[16:21] in the winter. And brother Rod we went
[16:24] over this in part two. No I'm sorry.
[16:25] Part one. Denominations teach the
[16:27] traditions of men. So their a lot of
[16:29] their worship is in vain. I'm not saying
[16:30] all their worship but a lot of their
[16:32] worship is in vain. And let me prove
[16:34] that the Pharisees. How many know their
[16:35] worship was in vain? Jesus said so. But
[16:37] who was in there that was a true
[16:38] worshipper? Nicodemus,
[16:41] &gt;&gt; right? The Sanhedrin. You know, all
[16:43] their they had all these traditions of
[16:45] men, but there was a real believer in
[16:47] there. Praise God. But what was God do
[16:49] doing? God was drawing them out slowly
[16:52] but surely. Hallelujah.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Some come out fast, some come out slow,
[16:56] but all God's children will come out of
[16:58] the system.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then remember, creeds limit
[17:02] the holy one. Just like Israel limited
[17:04] the Holy One of Israel, a creed will
[17:07] limit and say, "Well, God can only move
[17:08] in this Methodist way or or this." And
[17:11] I'm not referring to Jared. I'm just
[17:12] It's just the first one that came to my
[17:13] mind, but it could be God can only use
[17:16] move in the Catholic way or the Lutheran
[17:18] way,
[17:19] the Assembly of God, the oneness way,
[17:22] the Tunis way.
[17:24] And then God calls people out of the
[17:26] mother denomination. We see that in
[17:28] Revelation 18:4. But then God promised
[17:31] he would destroy the mother and all her
[17:32] daughters in a tribulation bed. We'd
[17:35] say, "Okay, Revelation 23 through23."
[17:39] Now, new for tonight. I I kind of think
[17:40] these are new for tonight. Um we'll go
[17:44] through six these these real fast. We'll
[17:46] review those and then here's some more
[17:48] by God's grace. I think maybe we've done
[17:51] some of these before. And if if so,
[17:53] pardon me, but uh there were six I got a
[17:57] video on this six times at least. Now,
[17:59] another brother shared a video or a
[18:01] document with me, but it's really long.
[18:03] It's like 20 pages. I haven't gone
[18:04] through it. And he said he has at least
[18:06] 10 thus sayith the Lord's where brother
[18:08] Brandham told somebody something on tape
[18:09] they'd get well. And then he has that
[18:11] quote and then he has the quote months
[18:13] or years later when they actually got
[18:15] well and they came back to the church to
[18:17] testify. So that would make 16. But I
[18:19] haven't gone through that one. Okay. So
[18:21] everyone understand by God's grace. So
[18:23] there's at least there's six there's
[18:25] possibly 16 or maybe more. So he told
[18:28] Marilyn Hickeyi, "Thus say the Lord, if
[18:29] you believe you have a baby," she had it
[18:31] 10 years later. She has that video on
[18:32] YouTube. She's uh very uh open to
[18:35] telling that about Brother Brandham.
[18:37] Brother Brham said, "There never be a
[18:38] greater gift to the Gentiles before the
[18:41] rapture than his gift." And there hasn't
[18:43] been, right? He would stand there day
[18:45] after day, month after month, year after
[18:47] year, discern these people, sometimes
[18:48] tell them 15 secrets like Eva York, five
[18:52] secrets, 10 secrets. and every time it
[18:54] was right with thus sayith the Lord. In
[18:56] 1962 he said women would continue to
[18:59] strip and that's obvious. 65 he had
[19:02] three he said the USA church would be
[19:04] led by a witch and dancing to rock and
[19:06] roll in immoral clothes and basically no
[19:10] moral standards smoking cigarettes and
[19:12] all kinds of stuff like that. Well,
[19:14] that's come to pass. uh the death of
[19:16] Florence Shakarian. He predicted that
[19:18] although it was hard uh because uh
[19:20] Florence's brother was his good friend,
[19:23] Deus Shakarian,
[19:25] but he had to prophesy it while all and
[19:27] the that that was so amazing was because
[19:29] all the preachers were saying God was
[19:30] going to heal her. And brother Ram said,
[19:32] "Well, God told me she was going to go
[19:34] with thus sayith the Lord." So again,
[19:35] it's brother Random, it's one prophet
[19:37] against many. Does that sound familiar?
[19:39] Micaiah against everybody else. Elijah
[19:42] against everybody else.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Right? So we see that. We see that a
[19:45] prophet, they're just different. They
[19:46] got thus sayith the Lord. They don't
[19:48] always they don't always stand with the
[19:49] majority. Very rarely do they stand with
[19:51] the majority.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; And I love this one. I quote this one
[19:54] all the time. Uh anointed ones of the
[19:56] end time. Brother said, "No denomination
[19:58] will ever break up and come back to the
[20:00] word." That's thus sayith the Lord. He
[20:01] said they'll go into the Antichrist
[20:03] system as well. So that's why I've told
[20:05] family members of friends here, you
[20:06] know, you got to come out of that
[20:08] denomination because if you live into
[20:09] the time of tribulation, they're going
[20:11] to push the mark of the beast on you.
[20:13] And your only hope uh if you don't want
[20:14] to die is to run to some cave somewhere,
[20:17] right? And try to survive for the next
[20:18] three and a half or seven years,
[20:19] whichever one you believe it is, right?
[20:21] Doesn't really matter. We just don't
[20:22] want to be here. Praise God.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, every nation is dominated by
[20:25] Satan. Brother said, I think I read this
[20:27] one, but uh it's worth repeating. Every
[20:29] nation is dominated by Satan. Woo. Never
[20:31] heard many amens on that, but it's the
[20:33] truth. Thus sayith the Lord. Every
[20:35] nation on earth is dominated by Satan.
[20:38] Satan took Jesus up on a mountain and
[20:40] showed him the United States and all the
[20:41] other kingdoms. Think of that. He said,
[20:43] "I'll give them all to you if you bow
[20:44] down and worship me." Now, and I maybe I
[20:47] read this too, but lots of people are
[20:49] expecting a national revival, even a
[20:51] worldwide revival, but they're confusing
[20:53] scriptures that pertain to the 144,000
[20:55] Jews in Millennium Verses. Raise your
[20:57] hand if you remember this. Have I
[20:58] preached this recently? Does anybody
[21:00] remember? Nobody. Nobody remembers that.
[21:03] Okay. What's this?
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. I thought I might have read it.
[21:07] So, that's why I was looking for a hand.
[21:09] So at least one person, pardon me.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Might have. I
[21:16] was wondering how recent it was. Thank
[21:18] you, sister. But there even brother Ram
[21:21] says this, people are confusing verses
[21:23] that contain to the 144,000 Jews and the
[21:26] millennia verses that do not pertain to
[21:28] the end of the gentile dispensation.
[21:30] Because remember, the Jews are blinded
[21:32] right now. Uh God cut off the the Jewish
[21:34] branch. He grafted in the Gentile
[21:36] branch. They have the life of God now
[21:38] through the Holy Ghost. But God's going
[21:40] to cut the Gentiles off and graft back
[21:42] in the Jews.
[21:44] Right? So, a lot of the promises they're
[21:46] hoping for are when the Jewish branch is
[21:48] put back in, grafted back into the holy
[21:51] tree and not during the time the Gentile
[21:53] branch is grafted to the tree. Brother
[21:56] Chris,
[22:03] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[22:07] Well, that uh most people think no, but
[22:10] we don't have thus sayith the Lord on
[22:11] it. Uh it's because of Revelation 22,
[22:13] brother. So, go there. Revelation 22. I
[22:15] think it's 10 or 7. Uh here's why most
[22:17] people think no.
[22:22] I mean, it's quite a question because uh
[22:24] if people say, well, I I guess I guess
[22:27] they say no because remember, as I just
[22:28] said, the the gentile branch is cut off.
[22:32] So if a branch is cut off, is there any
[22:34] more life getting to the branch? So then
[22:36] then people would say, "Well, there's no
[22:37] more salvation to the Gentiles." So in
[22:40] other words, whatever the Gentiles were
[22:41] at the time of the rapture, whether
[22:43] they're raptured or they they they stay,
[22:46] that's what they're always going to be.
[22:48] That's what some people believe. They
[22:50] they believe there's no more mercy for
[22:52] the Gentiles after the Gentile rapture.
[22:55] But there's even questions about that
[22:56] because technically the Jews are cut off
[22:58] now, but the fifth seal tells us God
[23:01] will save them because they're keeping
[23:02] Moses's covenant. I'm talking about
[23:04] there's very few Jews that keep it. Very
[23:05] few, right? We know most Jews are not
[23:08] very faithful to the Torah, right?
[23:10] Especially the rich ones, but not all
[23:12] rich ones, but the majority. Okay.
[23:14] Revelation 22, brother. Good question.
[23:16] Uh it's verse uh uh 11. He that is
[23:19] unjust, let him be unjust still. So
[23:21] there's going to come a time when
[23:22] whoever's unjust, they're just still
[23:23] going to be that way no matter what.
[23:25] They're just going to be that way. No
[23:26] hope for them, right? And he which is
[23:28] filthy, let him be filthy still. He that
[23:29] is righteous, let him be righteous
[23:30] still. And he that's holy, let him be
[23:32] holy still. So brother Ram would use
[23:34] this verse for the rapture. As soon as
[23:35] that rapture happens, whatever you are,
[23:37] that's what you are for the Gentiles.
[23:40] But the Jews, of course, Jesus comes to
[23:42] them and they they get the baptism of
[23:44] the Holy Ghost. They get the seal of God
[23:46] in their forehead. Okay, good question.
[23:48] Give to class, brother. Now, here's the
[23:50] deception. the NRA which is all these
[23:51] false prophets like Kenneth Copelan and
[23:54] U Bill Johnson and all these false
[23:57] prophets they teach a seven mountain
[23:59] mandate which teaches the church will
[24:01] rule the seven realms of education,
[24:02] entertainment, government, religion,
[24:04] family, media and business. It will be
[24:06] these antichrist movement that will
[24:09] control Yeah, I'm sorry. It will be the
[24:11] antichrist movement that will control
[24:13] the seven realms because it has to be so
[24:15] close that it would deceive the very
[24:16] elect if it were possible. It's got to
[24:19] be so close, right? But it won't be the
[24:22] Holy Ghost filled bride in control of
[24:24] entertainment.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; What entertainment would we put out if
[24:28] we were in control of it?
[24:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we put forth a
[24:31] biography of Charlie Kirk, the biography
[24:34] of William Brandom, Ernest Angley,
[24:35] right? Godly men if we were in charge.
[24:38] But we ain't going to get in charge.
[24:39] They ain't going to let us get in charge
[24:41] because we'll tear down their Disney and
[24:43] all their nonsense.
[24:45] Now, we might have read this, too. And
[24:46] I'm sorry if it's a repeat. I was trying
[24:48] to I was just trying to keep a record. I
[24:50] was just trying to keep track, but it's
[24:51] good to hear. Thus sayith the Lord
[24:52] anyway. Praise God. There must be
[24:55] someone rise up that's got to come with
[24:56] thus sayith the Lord. Malachi the 4th
[24:58] chapter. That's exactly what he said he
[25:00] would be the sign just before the coming
[25:01] of the great and terrible day of the
[25:02] Lord. I'll send you Elijah. What he do?
[25:04] Turn the hearts of that's Malachi 4:6.
[25:06] Turn the hearts of the children back to
[25:08] the doctrine of the fathers. Back to the
[25:10] Bible out of these denominational
[25:11] difference and come back to the Bible.
[25:13] Back to God. That's what he would do.
[25:14] Notice what a great time we're living
[25:16] in. We stand today with thus sayith the
[25:18] Lord that the water baptism in the last
[25:19] days is to be in the name of Jesus
[25:22] Christ. Now we go a step further. We say
[25:25] Lord Jesus Christ but we know what the
[25:26] Bible says. Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus
[25:28] Christ. Lord Jesus, you know. So
[25:30] brothers get basically saying uh it's
[25:33] not father, son, holy ghost. You got to
[25:36] call upon the name of Jesus Christ.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Right? Because there's only power in the
[25:40] name of Jesus Christ.
[25:42] and another man stand and perform
[25:44] miracles in a trinitarian. Show me the
[25:46] word trinity in the Bible. Okay, so
[25:47] we'll go past that. That's very familiar
[25:49] to us. But the Bible said as he promised
[25:51] in the last days he sent the spirit of
[25:53] Elijah and would call the people the
[25:55] children of God back to the original
[25:57] faith like it was in the beginning of
[25:58] the word. He says that word was
[26:00] confirmed the son of man in the last
[26:02] days. So son of man is another way for
[26:04] to say a prophet if you read the book of
[26:05] Ezekiel. So a prophet in the last days
[26:08] the same as it was in Sodom yesterday,
[26:10] today and forever. Who is the prophet
[26:11] during the time of Sodom? Abraham,
[26:13] right? And he wasn't perfect, but he was
[26:15] perfect with thus sayith the Lord
[26:17] because he was a prophet, right? He
[26:18] spoke in the name of the Lord. Came to
[26:19] pass. It's God's promise. It's thus
[26:22] sayeth the Lord. Amen. So, a spirit of
[26:25] Elijah would be here with thus sayith
[26:26] the Lord in the end time. Now, I love
[26:28] this statement by brother Ram. He nails
[26:30] it down. It has to be brother Ram's
[26:32] ministry because he says, "Thus say the
[26:33] Lord, it'll come to pass in this day."
[26:35] He said, "Search the world. Take every
[26:37] cult clan. Take every man. Take every
[26:39] church. I charge you in Christ's name,
[26:41] do this, you preachers. I charge you to
[26:44] read the newspapers or take
[26:45] consideration anywhere you want to go
[26:47] and see if it isn't on the earth right
[26:49] now. Amen. Church, that leaves out
[26:53] Joseph Brandom as being a prophet or
[26:55] anybody else. That wasn't a lie back
[26:56] then, right? Had to be somebody with
[26:58] thus sayith the Lord giving us the
[27:01] original Bible faith giving up giving it
[27:04] back to us back to the scripture. Just
[27:06] the scripture, a faith that keeps all
[27:08] the word of God. All right. Now, more.
[27:12] Oh, yeah. I must have some repeats in
[27:13] here, so pardon me. There's a repeat.
[27:16] Now, I I love this quote, but says this.
[27:18] Trinitarianism is of the devil, where
[27:20] they say, uh, God is three persons.
[27:22] That's of the devil. The Bible never
[27:24] says he's three persons.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; As I told you that not long ago, if
[27:27] Jesus was fully God, why did he need
[27:29] another fully God person to film the
[27:31] Holy Ghost? and then a third holy go uh
[27:34] holy ghost or I'm sorry a a third all
[27:37] god person to fill him. Why does an all
[27:39] god person need two other all god
[27:41] persons to fill him? It makes no sense,
[27:44] right? It's it's just confusion, right?
[27:46] It's nonsense.
[27:49] See, trinitarianism is of the devil. I
[27:51] say that thus sayith the Lord. Now what
[27:52] do they do? The trinitarians, they
[27:54] change the name of God from Lord Jesus
[27:56] Christ to fathers and holy ghost. They
[27:58] go like this or whatever they do,
[27:59] whatever nonsense they do, you know,
[28:02] look where it come from. It come from
[28:03] the Nyian council when the Catholic
[28:04] Church come in rulership. The word
[28:06] trinity is not even mentioned in the
[28:07] entire book of the Bible. As far as
[28:09] three gods, that's from hell. There's
[28:12] one god and church. I have the document,
[28:14] brother Rod. There's a a PhD
[28:16] trinitarian. He says he says uh
[28:18] unofficially we rotate between three
[28:20] gods and one god. That's what he put in
[28:22] his textbook. I've got the textbook. He
[28:25] said, 'But we would never say he's three
[28:27] gods, but they'll call him three
[28:29] persons. So they admit they have to
[28:32] rotate between three gods and one God
[28:35] unofficially. Church, we never
[28:37] unofficially dabble with any false
[28:39] doctrine.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Officially or unofficially, we just
[28:43] believe Bible doctrine. Praise God.
[28:46] Amen. But but now look what brother Ram
[28:48] says. He gives him grace. Do you believe
[28:50] all these trinitarians of hell? No, sir.
[28:52] They're Christians. But the hours
[28:54] approaching when they're sincerely
[28:55] wrong. And that's because uh the
[28:57] antichrist probably it's probably going
[28:58] to be the pope. And what's it what's one
[29:00] of his favorite teachings? The trinity.
[29:02] He's going to be pushing the trinity,
[29:04] the father, son, holy ghost. Right? So
[29:06] there's coming a time before the rapture
[29:07] where you really need uh where everyone
[29:09] if they're going to be saved and want to
[29:10] be saved need to leave the Catholic
[29:12] Church and this uh father, son, holy
[29:14] ghost uh grip that they have upon the
[29:17] people.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:22] now. And I, as I told you, remember I
[29:23] was I debated earlier this year with uh
[29:25] it was it was a very friendly debate
[29:26] with a trinitarian preacher. I walked
[29:28] up. I just seen him a couple weeks ago.
[29:30] Well, last month I seen him. I said,
[29:32] "Love you, brother. God bless you." He
[29:33] he he just said, "Thank you." He won't
[29:35] even say, "God bless you back because I
[29:37] because I told him Trinity is wrong." I
[29:41] said, "I appreciate your family." I
[29:42] mean, I was really trying to go all out
[29:43] and say nice things just to see if he'd
[29:45] say something to me. And he's a nice
[29:47] man. He's a nice man. But his wife now,
[29:50] she used to smile at me. She don't smile
[29:51] at me anymore. And I don't know if
[29:52] that's she's just having a bad day or
[29:54] what. But they won't even say, "God
[29:56] bless you." Because I deny a a teaching
[29:59] that is not even in the Bible. Three
[30:01] persons isn't even in the Bible. But can
[30:04] they be saved? Yes. Because as long as
[30:06] they're trusting in the blood of Jesus
[30:07] Christ, they can be saved. He said,
[30:10] "Thus sayith the Lord, the baptism using
[30:12] title, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is
[30:13] false. Thus sayith the Lord, I command
[30:15] every one of you on here or on tape that
[30:18] has been baptized in the name of Jesus
[30:19] Christ, be baptized again in the name of
[30:22] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[30:25] Okay. Goes on there. Now, this is one I
[30:27] haven't been refreshed on lately, but
[30:29] he's talking about uh Peter. He said,
[30:31] "Never was in Rome by the scriptures.
[30:34] Thus sayith the Lord, it's all a pagan
[30:36] idea." So that idea trying to put Peter
[30:39] in Rome to be the first pope. He said,
[30:41] "It's not in the Bible. Thus sayith the
[30:43] Lord. Now how many know that's true?
[30:45] &gt;&gt; You won't find it. Peter talks one time
[30:47] about Babylon, right? He talks about
[30:49] he's talking about Rome. So there he
[30:51] wasn't there but he rebuked him. Yeah,
[30:54] that's right. Amen.
[30:56] And now here's a a great quote too.
[30:58] Remember this is the ending of the
[30:59] Gentile dispensation. Remember it's thus
[31:02] sayith the Lord. It's time for the
[31:03] Gentile age to cease. And when it ceases
[31:06] then the gospel goes to the Jew and it's
[31:08] all over then.
[31:10] Okay. Now let's go. Let's prove that
[31:12] here. What's the next one? Okay. Yeah,
[31:14] because I'm doing good on time. Let's go
[31:16] to that. Let's go to Luke 21. I want to
[31:17] show that to brother Chris. Luke 21,
[31:19] where Jesus talks about uh uh the times
[31:22] of the Gentiles being fulfilled.
[31:30] And I'm just going by memory here, so I
[31:31] hope I can find it here. Uh
[31:37] yeah, there it is. Verse 24. Yeah. Luke
[31:39] uh 21:24.
[31:43] I've forgotten this one lately because I
[31:45] haven't used it too much by God's grace.
[31:46] But let's all let's all read that
[31:47] together, can we? One, two, three. And
[31:49] they shall fall by the edge of the sword
[31:53] and shall be led away captive into all
[31:56] nations. And Jerusalem shall be trotten
[31:59] down of the Gentiles until the times of
[32:02] the Gentiles be finished. Okay? So Jesus
[32:06] talks about there's going to come a time
[32:07] when the gentile time is finished.
[32:09] That's what that verse is about, brother
[32:11] Chris, about Revelation 22. He that's
[32:13] holy still, let him be, let him be that
[32:15] still. In other words, there's going to
[32:15] come a time when whatever you are,
[32:17] that's what you are, right?
[32:20] Okay. Uh they must be so Jerusalem will
[32:22] be trotten down the Gentiles. And how
[32:24] many know it's trotten down in the
[32:24] Gentiles, right? With the Muslims with
[32:26] their uh Dome of the Rock and
[32:28] everything. And they have a they have a
[32:30] they have a section for the Muslims.
[32:31] They got a se a section for the Jews and
[32:33] a section for the Christians, right?
[32:35] It's trotten down of the Gentiles until
[32:38] the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
[32:39] And then the Bible says that Israel will
[32:42] uh rebuild a temple, right? That's what
[32:44] Revelation 11 says. And they'll control
[32:46] the Temple Mount or some area in there.
[32:48] It doesn't actually say Temple Mount,
[32:50] but they'll have control of the courts
[32:52] of the temple, but then the the Gentiles
[32:54] will still have control of the outer
[32:56] court. Let's read that. Revelation 11,
[32:58] just so you got that, Brother Chris. Of
[33:00] course, a refresher for all of us too
[33:02] here by God's grace.
[33:04] Revelation 11.
[33:07] Okay. Uh verse one. Revelation 11 1 and
[33:10] two. I'll read one. We can all read two.
[33:12] And there was given me a read like unto
[33:13] a rod. Brother Rod. And the angel stood
[33:16] saying, "Rise and measure the temple of
[33:18] God and the altar, and them that worship
[33:20] there." And let's read verse two. One,
[33:21] two, three. But the court which is
[33:23] without the temple, leave out, and
[33:26] measure it not. For it is given unto the
[33:29] Gentiles, and the holy city shall they
[33:32] tread underfoot 40 and two months. Okay,
[33:36] so notice that the court which is
[33:38] without the temple leave out and measure
[33:40] not because that's part of the Gentiles.
[33:42] That fits perfectly what Jesus said.
[33:45] The the Gentiles will trotten down parts
[33:48] of Jerusalem until the Gentiles raptured
[33:50] away. Then the Jews will get control of
[33:53] somewhere, maybe the temple mount to
[33:54] build the temple, but they'll only have
[33:56] control of the the part of the temple,
[33:58] the courts of the temple. They won't
[33:59] have control of the outer parts of it.
[34:02] Now, I don't know if that's the outer
[34:03] court or I don't know if that's court of
[34:04] the women, court of the Gentiles
[34:06] outside. I'm talking about the courts of
[34:08] Solomon. You know, they had courts of
[34:10] the Gentiles and courts of the women.
[34:11] They had all these different courts.
[34:14] Okay, so now you got that. Let's go to
[34:15] uh Romans 11. We'll hit that, too,
[34:17] because we just got a couple more quotes
[34:18] here uh with thus sayith the Lord. I
[34:20] think there's four more, right? Oh,
[34:21] yeah. Four more general. There's four
[34:23] more general. Thus said the Lord. So,
[34:25] Romans 11.
[34:30] Okay. Verse 25. Romans 11:25.
[34:34] Now, if you want a good understanding on
[34:35] Ro uh Romans, I'm sorry, on Israel's
[34:38] blindness, read Romans 11. I preached
[34:41] through Romans last year, right? We got
[34:42] all the way preached the whole book. Um,
[34:45] so I got we got recordings on that if
[34:47] you want a refresher on that. And I got
[34:49] a whole chapter on on this this mystery.
[34:51] The Bible calls it a mystery of Israel's
[34:53] blindness. God has blinded them. So they
[34:56] the true Jews cannot see Christ as the
[34:59] Messiah. But they will. Praise God. They
[35:01] will during the tribulation period. So
[35:03] verse 25.
[35:05] Let's all read that there. One, two,
[35:07] three. For I would not, brethren, that
[35:09] ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
[35:12] lest ye should be wise in your own
[35:14] conceits. that blindness in part is
[35:18] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[35:20] the Gentiles come in. Okay? So, Brother
[35:24] Chris, they're going to be blind until
[35:25] all the Gentiles that were on the Lamb's
[35:28] book of life or the book of life have
[35:30] all received the Holy Ghost or received
[35:32] salvation. Okay? And then once all those
[35:36] names are they're believers, they got
[35:37] the Holy Ghost or they got salvation and
[35:40] it's all over, then God cuts off the
[35:41] Gentile branch. He grafts in the Jewish
[35:44] branch, right? takes the the Holy Ghost
[35:46] fil. The wise virgin takes them up in
[35:48] the rapture and the foolish go out and
[35:49] try to get the Holy Ghost, but they
[35:51] ain't going to make it. They're not
[35:52] going to make it to the marriage supper,
[35:53] right? They get they get locked out.
[35:55] Jesus said, "I never knew you because
[35:56] you never were born again." They turn
[35:58] down the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[35:59] Think about that. They turned down the
[36:00] gifts of the Holy Ghost, the the
[36:02] preaching, the prophecies, all these uh
[36:04] what they got 20 27 thus sayith the
[36:06] Lords. They turn them down. They don't
[36:07] want thus sayith the Lord, right? They
[36:09] just want church membership.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; You understand? like they don't want to
[36:13] get down and obey all this word. They
[36:15] want to say, "Oh, that hair stuff and
[36:17] that modesty stuff. That was just for
[36:18] the Corinthians." But Paul comes around
[36:20] and says, "I teach this in every church.
[36:23] I teach this everywhere in every
[36:25] church." Praise God.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Okay, four more. I'm closing up here. By
[36:28] God's grace, get this guy good rest
[36:31] tonight. By God's grace.
[36:33] Now, brother Ram said, "The bride unites
[36:35] with thus sayith the Lord." So all these
[36:37] doctrines, right, that were given thus
[36:40] sayith the Lord on, we've got to unite
[36:42] with them. Our marriages have to line up
[36:44] with thus sayith the Lord, right? Our
[36:46] holiness, our physical uh our physical
[36:50] presentation of a modest clothing that
[36:52] has to line up with thus sayith the
[36:53] scripture, right? We have to unite with
[36:55] that. In other words, we have to unite
[36:57] with the word of God. Praise God.
[37:01] Brother Ram said God is uniting his
[37:03] bride four months before he passed away.
[37:04] No, I'm sorry. Well, this is two years
[37:06] and four months. Sorry. I thought it was
[37:07] 65 to 63. She's coming together from the
[37:10] east and west and the north and south.
[37:11] There's a uniting time and that's on
[37:13] right now. What is she uniting for? The
[37:15] rapture. Amen. God's getting her ready.
[37:17] Yes, sir. Uniting. What is she uniting
[37:19] with? With the word. For all heavens and
[37:22] earth will pass away, but my word shall
[37:24] never pass away. She's uniting herself
[37:26] with thus sayith the Lord. Regardless of
[37:28] what any denomination or anybody else
[37:30] says. Amen. She's uniting herself. She's
[37:33] getting ready. Why? She's the bride.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Remember uh the Bible said in John, "He
[37:38] that hath the bride is the bridegroom."
[37:40] Praise God.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; And the bride has the bridegroom.
[37:43] Hallelujah. We're married to Christ.
[37:45] Christ is married to us. He's called us
[37:46] to this marriage. Praise God.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. She's united herself
[37:51] with her bridegroom. See, and the
[37:52] bridegroom is the Let's say it together.
[37:55] The
[37:55] &gt;&gt; word.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Word. The bridegroom is the word.
[37:58] Remember, he comes back in Armageddon.
[38:00] And what's he got written? He's got
[38:01] written the word of God. He's the word.
[38:05] His character is the word. Hallelujah.
[38:07] So, we must unite with the word.
[38:09] Hallelujah. In the beginning was the
[38:12] word. The word was with God. The word
[38:13] was God. Speaking of the logos, the
[38:16] first uh visible form of the Holy Ghost.
[38:19] Hallelujah. And the word was made flesh
[38:22] and dwelt among us. So, church, that
[38:24] should be our desire to unite with thus
[38:26] saith the Lord.
[38:29] Now, maybe I'll go back at the end is
[38:30] and and maybe ask ourselves. We should
[38:32] ask ourselves that. Is there any thus
[38:33] sayith the Lord we're having trouble
[38:34] uniting with? Let's ask God for help to
[38:37] unite with it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Because we have to. If we're going to be
[38:42] married to the word, we got to be the
[38:44] word. In other words, we got to be
[38:46] totally surrendered to the word of God.
[38:48] Not perfect like Job, but we got to hate
[38:50] evil and constantly pray, confess our
[38:52] sins every day so we can be one with the
[38:54] word.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Right? God's not asking for perfection,
[38:57] right? Because if that's the case, we
[38:59] don't need Jesus, right? We need Jesus.
[39:01] We need the blood of Jesus Christ. We
[39:02] need the Holy Ghost. I love what Brother
[39:04] Rod said, plead the blood all the round.
[39:06] Always plead the In other words, call
[39:07] the call the prince of Jesus around all
[39:10] the time in your daily life. Amen.
[39:14] Now, I think this one was more directed
[39:16] to Chicago, Illinois, because in 1961,
[39:19] Brother Ram says he's given an altar
[39:20] call at the end of the service. He said,
[39:22] "Now, just remember, I speak in the name
[39:23] of the Lord. The hour is coming when you
[39:25] will scream for a meeting like this. Now
[39:27] church, I've never screamed for a
[39:29] meeting uh like a real Holy Ghost
[39:31] meeting, but I have wept and cried for
[39:33] greater Holy Ghost meetings. I have laid
[39:35] on this altar and wept and say, "God,
[39:37] give us a revival. God, send the Holy
[39:39] Ghost. I haven't screamed yet, but but I
[39:42] guess brother John and I one time,
[39:44] brother John Graham and I did pray for
[39:45] 45 minutes and we were screaming for a
[39:47] move of God." And then God gave us a
[39:48] beautiful revival there in 2000 2010.
[39:51] It's like three years in a row, just a
[39:52] really nice, wonderful revival.
[39:55] But he says, "The hours coming when
[39:57] you'll scream for a meeting like this,
[39:58] you'll be so you won't be so anxious to
[40:00] get up and go out. It'll be too late
[40:02] then." So, I think he's prophesying
[40:04] perhaps of when the when the revival
[40:06] would end in Chicago,
[40:09] okay? But I don't know for sure. But it
[40:10] it seems to be like a word for the
[40:12] Chicago congregations. But I want you to
[40:14] know, church, we want we should be
[40:16] honest with ourselves. We need to cry
[40:17] out for more revival. Praise God. in our
[40:19] life.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; God, give us a move of the Holy Ghost.
[40:23] How many remember when brother uh Paul
[40:24] Griffin was here the last time we had a
[40:27] 4-hour service as far as there was
[40:28] people praying for four hours, Brother
[40:30] Rod? He just preached on uh getting your
[40:33] first love back and I just loved it
[40:35] because I'm like, "Wow, I've wanted this
[40:37] my whole time being a pastor and it
[40:38] finally happened. People at the altar
[40:41] just praying for three hours or four
[40:43] hours after service. It was just a
[40:46] wonderful move of the Holy Ghost." And
[40:47] see what see we can't impersonate that.
[40:50] God has to do it.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; But what do we do? We keep waiting, keep
[40:53] believing, asking God to send the Holy
[40:56] Ghost. Hallelujah.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Was that right, church?
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Now, this is just means uh thus sayith
[41:03] the Lord, the move is on the bride. That
[41:04] just means it's our time to get in
[41:06] contact with God. It's our time to be
[41:08] grafted into the holy tree. If if you
[41:11] listen to this quote, preachers use this
[41:12] for all kinds of reasons,
[41:14] you know, but alls it means if you
[41:17] listen to brother Brandham, it means we
[41:18] need to come up and pray for people. We
[41:20] need to be moved by the Holy Spirit. We
[41:22] got to get people saved. It just means
[41:24] it's our time to have the gospel.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Okay? So listen, listen what he says.
[41:28] He's doing an altar call in Shreport.
[41:31] This is a month before he passed away.
[41:33] Now, real quietly, I'm going to ask you
[41:34] consecrated men and women. And he just
[41:37] notices how there's one woman at the
[41:39] altar and more men. He just notices
[41:40] that. He said, "Some of you consecrated
[41:42] Christians, come here and stand with me
[41:44] in prayer just a minute on the altar
[41:45] wherever you are on the platform.
[41:46] Somebody that really knows God just
[41:48] knows how to stand here just a few
[41:50] minutes for prayer with them. Then we'll
[41:52] dismiss the audience. Everybody be
[41:54] reverent now. Don't leave. Just come
[41:55] here and stand around." That's why
[41:57] church, you know, when people are
[41:58] sometimes over here, they have special
[41:59] needs, I'll call people out of the
[42:01] audience. I want someone who's got
[42:03] faith. I want somebody who's believing.
[42:05] I want somebody who's anointed with the
[42:06] Holy Ghost to pray like me. Praise God.
[42:08] Or pray like this person who's got this
[42:10] burden. It's a serious burden. I want
[42:13] people that know God. Amen. Praise God.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; We want somebody to pray who knows God
[42:19] and God hears them.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; See,
[42:24] and church, I'll say it like this. It's
[42:26] a dangerous thing when other people
[42:28] don't often come up and pray for other
[42:30] people because you don't have a burden
[42:31] to pray for other people.
[42:35] You know, I'll just say it like this.
[42:37] Over the years, if we have a new person
[42:38] come up here, we're like, "Brother Chris
[42:40] or somebody and and and people don't
[42:42] feel led to come pray for them, what's
[42:44] wrong?" Now, I understand if it's a
[42:45] sister, right? If it's a sister, I don't
[42:48] expect you to lay hands on a brother.
[42:49] Does everybody understand that?
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Unless God tells you to put on his
[42:53] shoulder or something like I I don't I
[42:56] don't I I understand that if if it's a
[42:58] brother and I don't I don't expect the
[42:59] sisters to come up for that. But if
[43:01] there's a one of our sisters and I feel
[43:03] like our other sisters should have a
[43:05] burden to come pray for them. Let's care
[43:07] about somebody for somebody other than
[43:09] us. The move is on the bride.
[43:11] Hallelujah.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; This is this might be the chance that
[43:13] God touches them. Hallelujah.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; This might be the time they get a
[43:17] supernatural experience.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Like brother Aman even testified,
[43:22] you know, when Simon Simon comes out
[43:23] here and lays his hands on him and he
[43:25] had a supernatural experience. He said
[43:27] he said it felt like it was the the hand
[43:29] a super huge uh hand like the hand of an
[43:32] angel. But Simon's got small hands like
[43:33] all Smiths have small hands.
[43:37] But it it was now what if he would have
[43:39] said well I'll just let the brother pray
[43:40] for himself. But see the moves God wants
[43:43] to move in us. Praise God. God's here to
[43:46] move. So we should be more concerned
[43:47] about other people than ourselves
[43:49] sometimes.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; I understand if you got a burden. Yeah.
[43:52] You you can only see in your situation.
[43:54] You know I understand that there's times
[43:55] that Yeah. There's times I I feel like
[43:57] that too. God, I need something. I need
[43:59] something tonight. But if you're feeling
[44:01] good and you see somebody who has a
[44:02] need, let's go pray for them. The Holy
[44:04] Ghost is trying to move on. They're
[44:05] coming here to find God, and you can
[44:07] help them find God. Hallelujah.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; So, let let me encourage. I haven't said
[44:14] that for a while. Maybe I've never said
[44:15] that, but sisters, if you see a sister
[44:17] up here, seek your heart and see if God
[44:20] might lead you up here to pray for them.
[44:22] Same things for our brothers. You see a
[44:24] brother up here seeking God, even if
[44:26] it's me, come pray for me. I could use
[44:29] your prayers. Hallelujah.
[44:31] You know, you know, let's just let's be
[44:33] concerned about somebody else. Brother
[44:34] Ram's calling people up. Where's
[44:36] somebody that knows God? Come pray for
[44:38] people.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Some of you people that really believe
[44:41] this to be the truth. We're entering
[44:43] another age. We're entering the rapture
[44:45] age. Amen. So, he's talking about the
[44:47] the another word is the latter rain
[44:49] time. The Bible calls it the latter
[44:50] rain. I'm not sure, brother Rod. I don't
[44:51] have to familiar with that. But the
[44:53] latter rain is the last reign before the
[44:54] harvest. So the Bible says there's a
[44:57] former latter rain. The latter rain will
[44:59] be the last revival right before Jesus
[45:01] raptures the church. Okay? So that's
[45:04] what brother say. We're getting close to
[45:05] this rapture age. You know the church
[45:07] can't go in its condition and it can't
[45:09] get any better. It must get worse. How
[45:11] many knows that? Right? The church it's
[45:13] got to get worse. It can't go like this.
[45:14] It's got to be something. It's moving
[45:16] right now. Friend, see the move is on
[45:18] for the bride. That's the truth. That's
[45:19] thus sayith the Lord. So, see, brother
[45:22] brother was saying, "Thus sayith the
[45:23] Lord." God's trying to get the people
[45:25] filled with the Holy Ghost back then,
[45:27] &gt;&gt; right? Because time goes so fast. Praise
[45:29] God.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, it just it just goes so fast. No
[45:34] one knows when the rapture is going to
[45:35] happen. We got to be ready for the
[45:36] rapture. Praise God.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Come." Now, he says,
[45:40] "Move up." He said, "The move's on the
[45:42] bride." So, look what he says. Move up,
[45:43] you consecrated Christians. That's what
[45:45] we need today.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. that wants your record to find out
[45:49] those these who come sincerely. You want
[45:52] to come and offer prayer with them as
[45:53] your brothers and sisters come up around
[45:55] the altar. Stand around here just for a
[45:57] moment. Just for I mean it ain't going
[45:58] to be all day. Just come pray for a
[46:00] moment. Praise God.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen for prayer. Someone else want to
[46:04] come stand around here. Just kneel down
[46:06] by them. Just walk where you men and
[46:08] women around there. You women sweet
[46:10] humbly ask prayer for them.
[46:14] And I think that's the last one. Oh, one
[46:15] more. This is the last one. Yeah, that's
[46:17] the last one. All right, last one.
[46:18] Everybody take a deep breath in. Ready?
[46:20] And I'm a little past my time. I'm
[46:22] surprised I lost track of time. I am
[46:24] surprised. I've been doing a pretty good
[46:25] job. Well, I hope so. Last quote.
[46:29] Brother Ram says, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[46:31] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[46:34] that place." He's speaking about heaven.
[46:37] For that's all there was there.
[46:41] in order to get there. Another in order
[46:43] to get to the place of perfect love, you
[46:44] got to have it now.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Right? Death only changes your location.
[46:48] It doesn't change your character.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; But says you're taking your character
[46:52] with you.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Whatever you are on earth, you'll
[46:55] take that with you.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; You don't change. Samuel was still a
[46:58] prophet. Right? When he got called up,
[47:00] he was still he was still Samuel. Still
[47:01] a prophet. Right? That's what we'll be
[47:03] too. Whatever you are now, whatever you
[47:06] what do you whatever you live to be,
[47:07] whatever you grow to be. And if you pass
[47:09] on the other side, that's what you'll
[47:11] always be.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; But you have a perfect glorified body.
[47:14] Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; No more sin nature.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; That's all there was there. No matter
[47:19] how many religious demonstrations, how
[47:21] many good deeds you've done, whatever
[47:23] you done, that won't count nothing on
[47:24] that day. It'll take perfect love. So
[47:27] whatever you do, you lay aside
[47:28] everything else until you're just so
[47:30] filled with the love of God so you can
[47:31] love those that hate you.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Okay? And I think I'll stop with that.
[47:39] Let's stand to our feet. By God's grace,
[47:41] resistance can come.
[47:43] How many enjoyed that? 27. Thus sayith
[47:45] the Lords.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I think I got through my whole
[47:47] document. If I'm not mistaken, I'll
[47:49] probably study again and I may do a part
[47:51] four. We'll kind of see how that goes.
[47:53] But aren't you glad you've heard thus
[47:54] sayith the Lord for today,
[47:56] &gt;&gt; church? Most people, this is just a
[47:58] history book. You know, they they'll
[48:00] read a thus sayith the Lord. Well,
[48:01] that's a nice story.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Well, church, we have a prophet who's on
[48:04] tape. We can hear him say on tape. This
[48:06] is thus sayaith the Lord.
[48:09] It's thus sayith the Lord about water
[48:10] baptism, the Godhead, your hair length,
[48:13] your clothes. We have thus sayaith the
[48:15] Lord on the perfect will of God.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have thus sayith the
[48:20] Lord. We're going to need perfect love
[48:22] to make it over to heaven. Hallelujah.
[48:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads here.
[48:28] Father God, we thank you for tonight,
[48:29] Lord God. We thank you for perfect love.
[48:32] Lord, we are a privileged people, Lord,
[48:34] to have thus sayith the Lord. I so
[48:36] enjoyed the Methodist service, Lord. I
[48:38] really did. I felt so good with Rod
[48:39] there and brother Jared.
[48:41] But Lord, I can also recognize when I
[48:44] come back here, we have thus sayith the
[48:46] Lord.
[48:48] And I thank you for that, Lord God.
[48:52] Lord, we're no better in our own
[48:54] ability. You've just given us more
[48:56] grace.
[48:58] That's all, Lord God.
[49:00] But Lord, I believe the scripture would
[49:02] tell us it's our duty to share it with
[49:03] them so that they could have a chance at
[49:05] the grace of God as well.
[49:09] Perhaps Lord, we just heard it before
[49:11] they did, Lord God. And Lord, we know
[49:13] few there be that find the narrow road
[49:15] that leads to life. Lord, we know that.
[49:17] We believe there saved people in their
[49:18] church. Lord, we just want to be saved
[49:20] and filled with the Holy Ghost, too,
[49:21] Lord God. We're not making ourselves
[49:23] better, but Lord, we're thankful that we
[49:25] have thus sayith the Lord.
[49:27] where when it comes to a question about
[49:29] the Godhead, will not say, "Well, I like
[49:31] this doctor degree. I like that uh I
[49:34] like I like that guy who's got the
[49:36] double doctor degree." Lord, we're
[49:39] thankful that we don't have to argue
[49:40] about that or even think about that.
[49:42] We've got thus sayeth the Lord. God is
[49:44] one person. Hallelujah. We got thus
[49:46] sayith the Lord. We don't have to
[49:47] wonder, should I be sprinkled with holy
[49:50] water apparently?
[49:52] Should I be buried in the three times
[49:54] forward or backwards like my trinitarian
[49:56] friend told me? You got to go three
[49:57] times backward because that's how you go
[50:00] in a casket. You go head down and head
[50:03] or face up. Lord, we don't have to
[50:05] wonder. We've got thus sayith the Lord.
[50:07] Hallelujah.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; We call upon the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:10] Christ. Oh, we're so blessed, God. And
[50:13] we got thus sayith the Lord. The move is
[50:14] on the bride. Lord, the move is on those
[50:17] who love the word of God. Hallelujah.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Those who want to be married to the
[50:23] word. Lord, I want to be married to the
[50:24] word, the Lord Jesus. We all want to be
[50:26] married to you, Lord Jesus.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You're the bridegroom. We're the bride.
[50:31] So, Lord, let our character match
[50:33] &gt;&gt; the character of Jesus Christ. May we
[50:36] constantly plead the blood. Hallelujah.
[50:38] May we have faith for supernatural
[50:39] miracles if it be our gift, Lord God.
[50:42] Let us be faithful with the gifts you've
[50:43] given to us, Lord God. And let us have
[50:46] perfect love that we can love our
[50:47] enemies, oh God. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[50:51] That we can love our enemies, Lord God.
[50:53] Those who speak against us, we can pray
[50:56] for them. Those who use us, we can pray
[50:59] for them. Those who speak evil, we can
[51:02] say something good about them.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord Jesus. Thank you that the
[51:08] move is on us. Help us to have perfect
[51:10] love. Cast out all fear.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Live for you, Lord Jesus, as we look for
[51:16] your coming. Thank you, God. What a
[51:18] wonderful,
[51:19] wonderful message we see in the
[51:21] scripture here, Lord God. remember the
[51:23] prophets who've spoken in the name of
[51:25] the Lord. Father, we remember them
[51:27] tonight. And Lord, I didn't do it, but
[51:29] Lord, remind us of that list. If there's
[51:32] something we're falling short on that
[51:33] list, God, help us to raise up quickly
[51:35] and obey it. Lord God, give us the
[51:38] character to keep it, Lord God.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord Jesus. Grant it, my
[51:42] father.
[51:44] Lord, and as I said, there's many times
[51:46] I've cried, "Send a revival. Send the
[51:48] Holy Ghost in a great way, Lord God."
[51:50] like it was in the in Brother Ram's
[51:52] ministry. Lord God, send it like that,
[51:54] Lord. We pray. We know it's still
[51:55] possible. We've seen it, Lord. Last
[51:57] year, we saw it. We saw it in 2023, Lord
[52:00] God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Send the
[52:02] Holy Ghost in a great way, Lord God. We
[52:04] miss those oldfashioned meetings, Lord.
[52:06] We need the visitation of the Holy
[52:08] Ghost.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; He said they'll scream for it, Lord God.
[52:10] But for us, it's not too late, dear God.
[52:13] For us, we have the grace of God. We
[52:15] have the mercy of God, Lord Jesus. Thank
[52:17] you, God, for your mercy and grace.
[52:19] Lord, we know there's time for planting
[52:21] and harvesting and then the rain falls
[52:23] and brings forth the seed, brings forth
[52:26] the seed back to its original condition,
[52:28] Lord, as we've been looking at. So,
[52:31] Father, hear our prayers tonight. We
[52:32] thank you, God, for every effort of the
[52:34] saints. Bless your people for coming out
[52:36] to the house of God. We're so excited
[52:37] for the people that keep coming back,
[52:39] Lord God. Bless your people for
[52:41] continuing to come back to the house of
[52:42] God. We're so thankful, Lord Jesus. God,
[52:45] hear our prayers tonight. And if anyone
[52:46] needs prayer, hear our prayers tonight.
[52:49] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And
[52:51] the saints said, "Amen."
