[0:00] Uh, 1 Corinthians. I'm going to take a
[0:01] little break
[0:06] there. I'd like to preach on David this
[0:10] morning. I preach a little bit on him on
[0:12] Easter Sunday. Hallelujah. And so I'd
[0:15] like to go back and look at the life of
[0:16] David. I'd like to preach on David's
[0:18] battle against David. Hallelujah. So I
[0:20] want to look at iniquity. How we battle
[0:23] iniquity in our lives. I'd like to
[0:25] preach on David this morning. David's
[0:26] battle against David.
[0:29] You know, I've been reading through the
[0:30] book of Psalms. Um, I always read
[0:32] through the Bible. I always start at the
[0:33] back. I always start in Revelation. I
[0:34] read Revelation. I work my way forward
[0:37] because I felt when I would try to read
[0:38] it from the beginning, I would get a
[0:40] little bit uh I would just get a little
[0:42] bit frustrated. So, I like to start at
[0:44] Revelation. So, I start at Revelation
[0:46] and I go all the way uh back. And now
[0:49] I'm in Psalms. And I've just been
[0:51] reading about the life of David
[0:52] repeatedly. You know, I'm in I'm up to
[0:54] chapter 45, I think, this morning.
[0:57] uh really enjoying it. But I've been
[0:59] through so many verses here where
[1:00] David's talking about his battle with
[1:02] sin. And so it's been uh uh quite eye
[1:06] openening to me uh and encouraging,
[1:08] inspiring. I hope it'd be inspiring to
[1:10] you today. Praise God. So uh Psalm
[1:19] 40:12, we can probably all read that one
[1:21] here when if you're there. If you're
[1:22] there, say amen. Amen. Let's read verse
[1:25] 12. Psalm 40:12. Let's begin on three. 1
[1:27] 2 3. For innumerable evils have
[1:31] compassed me about. Mine iniquities have
[1:35] taken hold upon me so that I am not able
[1:39] to look up. They are more than the hairs
[1:42] of mine head. Therefore, my heart
[1:46] faileth me. Anyone ever felt like that
[1:49] before? You're so discouraged by your
[1:51] sin. You're so frustrated. you have a
[1:54] hard time even looking up to heaven. May
[1:57] God add as a blessing to the reading of
[1:58] his word. You may be
[2:04] seated. So, I'd like to uh if you'll
[2:06] just show this slide, this uh visual. I
[2:09] just have a couple visuals and then uh
[2:10] I'll turn it off and you could do a lot
[2:12] of uh scriptures today by the grace of
[2:14] the
[2:16] Lord. So, let's look at here if we can.
[2:18] Uh now, remember I put this up here on
[2:20] uh was it Easter? Yeah, we looked at
[2:22] this uh how uh the sword uh Jesus said,
[2:26] "I have the power of death in hell." And
[2:28] we saw it was Jesus taking the power. He
[2:30] had now power over death. And it was
[2:33] foreshadowed in the life of David.
[2:34] Praise God. Uh and so, uh David got the
[2:38] power over Goliath, right? And he took
[2:40] Goliath's sword. And we saw that was a
[2:42] type of Jesus taking the power of death,
[2:46] hallelujah, away from Satan. And so, we
[2:48] see a a great parallel in their lives.
[2:50] How many appreciate the parallel here?
[2:52] Amen. Isn't it awesome to see how uh
[2:54] David was from Bethlehem and uh Jesus
[2:57] was born there in Bethlehem? And uh
[2:59] Jesus was the spiritual shepherd while
[3:01] David was a
[3:02] natural. Uh David was anointed there at
[3:04] the beginning of his life by Samuel just
[3:06] as Jesus was anointed at the River
[3:08] Jordan. And then they both went to their
[3:11] uh great battle uh the great battle over
[3:14] the giant. And Jesus took on the giant
[3:16] of uh death and hell and the grave and
[3:19] sin. Even the Bible said all of our sins
[3:21] were placed upon Jesus. Hallelujah. So
[3:23] Jesus fought for us. Hallelujah. He took
[3:25] on our giant. Hallelujah. And just as
[3:28] David defeated Goliath and uh and
[3:31] everybody then started took courage,
[3:33] Jesus defeated death on the cross and
[3:35] now all the believers take courage.
[3:37] Hallelujah. We take courage that we can
[3:39] defeat uh the enemy. Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:44] And so uh but of course after Jesus uh
[3:47] I'm sorry after Jesus died he was uh he
[3:50] was rejected there and uh humiliated of
[3:52] course on the cross and suffered on the
[3:54] cross but then he went down to hell and
[3:56] he got the army of the Old Testament
[3:58] saints just as David after he defeated
[4:00] Goliath. He entered to a long period of
[4:02] suffering and affliction and rejection.
[4:05] We're going to look at a few of those uh
[4:06] this morning. And then he got an army.
[4:09] remember all the all the uh men that
[4:11] were in debt and uh all the soldiers
[4:14] that were uh we we would say fleeing
[4:16] from Saul and didn't like Saul's
[4:18] leadership, they all came to David and
[4:20] gave David their allegiance. Praise God.
[4:22] Just as Jesus got the army of Old
[4:24] Testament saints during his time of uh
[4:27] rejection and
[4:28] suffering. But then uh Jesus rose,
[4:31] right? And then he sent the Holy Ghost
[4:33] and became king. Hallelujah. The Bible
[4:35] calls him king of kings and lord of
[4:36] lords. Hallelujah. The Bible calls him
[4:39] king of saints. Hallelujah. Amen. So we
[4:42] know Jesus is our king today.
[4:44] Hallelujah. And uh just as David went
[4:46] and got uh uh David became king over
[4:49] Hebron at first. Hallelujah. And then
[4:52] David became king over all Israel just
[4:55] like Jesus king. He Jesus started out as
[4:57] the Holy Ghost, you know, fell upon the
[4:59] Jews. That was like Hebron. The Holy
[5:01] Ghost fell only on the Jews. But then it
[5:02] went to the Samaritans and then it went
[5:04] to the Gentiles in Acts chapter 8 and
[5:06] Acts chapter 10. Hallelujah. And then uh
[5:09] Jesus was building his church of
[5:11] Gentiles. And um David was ruling from
[5:14] his temple or the tabernacle, right? Uh
[5:16] I'm sorry, the the yeah, the tabernacle
[5:18] that he built just as Jesus rules from
[5:20] his heavenly throne today. Praise God.
[5:23] And then David allowed Solomon to come
[5:25] into power uh and a time of peace. Uh
[5:29] brother brother Ram calls it uh uh the
[5:31] greatest time of Israel's uh rule is
[5:33] when they had peace under Solomon.
[5:35] Praise God. And then of course we'll
[5:37] Jesus will lead us into the millennium a
[5:40] thousand years of peace. Hallelujah. So
[5:42] we're looking forward to that by God's
[5:43] grace. Now today if we could I like to
[5:47] uh do a new slide here. Uh this is what
[5:50] I was working on for the sermon today
[5:53] here. Uh by God's grace. I just I'd like
[5:55] to look at you know some of David's uh
[5:57] shortcomings here. And uh so I took out
[6:00] the things that type Jesus and just I I
[6:02] gave a little little bit of scriptural
[6:04] references. you know, he was anointed uh
[6:07] by Samuel and then he played for Saul as
[6:09] well in 1st Samuel 16, he defeats
[6:11] Goliath in 1st Samuel 17. Uh now
[6:14] remember right after uh he defeats
[6:16] Goliath, he has to flee uh sometime
[6:19] shortly after that he has to flee from
[6:20] Saul and some people say he flee he was
[6:23] uh fleeing perhaps for five, seven, some
[6:26] people think up to 13 years he was
[6:27] running from his his father-in-law. So
[6:30] it was a very long stretch of time where
[6:32] he was rejected uh by his brethren,
[6:34] right? Rejected even by his
[6:36] father-in-law. So he flees from Saul in
[6:38] chapter 19. He hides in the wilderness
[6:39] for about six chapters from 20 to 26. He
[6:43] even church moved in and lived with the
[6:46] Philistines in chapters 27 through 30,
[6:49] right? He moves in with the enemy,
[6:52] right? And here's a man, remember,
[6:54] here's a man who defeated the greatest
[6:56] giant in all the land, all the world.
[7:00] But he got to such a place where he
[7:02] leaves the promised land. Uh and seems
[7:05] like now and he at the end of this he
[7:07] even starts going out to battle against
[7:10] King Saul. But then the Philistines
[7:13] don't want him battling and so they tell
[7:15] they send him back and say no we don't
[7:17] want you. He was in a spot where he was
[7:19] actually going to fight against his own
[7:21] his own people. Hallelujah. That that's
[7:24] how low this time of suffering and
[7:26] rejection and humiliation was. in
[7:28] church. Think about people today.
[7:30] They'll fight against us.
[7:32] Church members, right? People we love
[7:34] will fight against other church members.
[7:37] Isn't it a sad thing? That's why the
[7:39] Bible said the Lord hates those that
[7:41] cause division amongst the family of
[7:43] God. Sixth thing the Lord despises.
[7:45] Seven things the Lord hates, right? Is
[7:48] to sow discord among the brethren. But
[7:51] we can see it here that it was such an
[7:53] awful thing and David was out of the
[7:55] promised land and went through these
[7:56] sufferings. And then of course God knows
[7:59] God knows how to bring his word to pass.
[8:01] Amen. Hallelujah. He was anointed all
[8:03] the way back here but had to go through
[8:04] such suffering until he experienced uh
[8:07] the joy of being king or the the promise
[8:10] of being king. Sometimes promises will
[8:12] hold off for a long time. But church
[8:14] keep waiting on God. If God gave you a
[8:16] promise the promise will be fulfilled.
[8:20] You might have to wait through much
[8:21] suffering. You might have to wait
[8:22] through much rejection or humiliation or
[8:24] even personal failures.
[8:27] But God is going to bring his promised
[8:29] word to pass. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[8:33] became king over Hebron for seven years.
[8:35] And then uh then he becomes king over
[8:37] all Israel in chapter 5 of 2 Samuel. Uh
[8:40] his awful fall with Bashibba. Uriah was
[8:43] chapters 11 and 12. Abselon rebelled
[8:46] against him in chapter 15. And then he
[8:48] numbered Israel in 2 Samuel
[8:52] 24. All right. Now I just I'll leave
[8:55] that up there just for a little bit.
[8:56] Now, uh, if you got your Bibles, let's
[8:58] go for just a little review. Uh, let's
[9:00] go to for our battles here. Let's go to
[9:02] Ephesians chapter 6. And just remember
[9:04] that we're not fighting flesh and blood.
[9:07] Our enemies today are not physical
[9:09] enemies. Praise God. We're fighting
[9:11] spiritual wickedness in high
[9:17] places. So, let's go to Ephesians
[9:18] chapter
[9:20] 6 verse 10.
[9:27] Ephesians 6:10. Finally, my brethren, be
[9:30] strong in the Lord and the power of his
[9:33] might. Is that how you feel today?
[9:34] Praise God. Hallelujah. If not, let's
[9:37] get strong today. Praise God. Or if
[9:39] you're in the spot like David where you
[9:41] can hardly look up to the preacher,
[9:42] hardly look up to heaven while you're
[9:44] singing, take courage. God is able to
[9:46] lift your head and encourage you.
[9:49] Hallelujah. Because David, remember, he
[9:51] went through all these feelings. He went
[9:52] from the mountaintop of killing Goliath
[9:55] to the valley of running for his life.
[9:57] Hiding out in caves, hiding out in the
[9:59] wilderness. Praise God. As we saw today,
[10:01] not even able to lift up his head to
[10:03] heaven. Church, that's a pretty
[10:06] discouraged
[10:07] state. Right now, we've seen it amongst
[10:10] our church recently. People are so
[10:12] discouraged they can't even lift their
[10:14] head up and praise
[10:15] God. But that that's how David was as
[10:18] well. We just have to remember we got to
[10:20] pray for people when they're discouraged
[10:22] because God knows how to bring them out
[10:24] of the discouragement.
[10:26] God knows how to encourage them. God
[10:29] knows how to bring restoration.
[10:30] Hallelujah.
[10:32] And God is the author. Amen. God is the
[10:35] author and finisher of our faith.
[10:36] Hallelujah.
[10:38] God knows how to lift your
[10:41] head. That's right. Now uh verse 11, put
[10:46] on the whole armor of God that you able
[10:48] to stand against the ws of the enemy. So
[10:51] we see strength is when you put on the
[10:54] armor of God. If you want to be strong,
[10:55] put on God's armor. In other words,
[10:58] don't put on your feelings. Don't put on
[11:00] your thoughts. Uh don't don't put on
[11:02] your ideas. Put on the word of God.
[11:04] Hallelujah. In other words, you've got
[11:06] to speak the word. You've got to believe
[11:08] the word. You've got to trust in the
[11:10] word of God. That's how you're going to
[11:11] be strong. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[11:17] right. Now, verse 13, I'm sorry, verse
[11:20] 12. For we wrestle not against flesh and
[11:22] blood, but against principalities,
[11:23] against powers, against the rulers of
[11:25] the darkness of this world, against
[11:27] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[11:30] Hallelujah. So again, you're not
[11:32] fighting a brother or sister. You know,
[11:34] if someone in in the church or someone a
[11:35] believer is against you, and Jose sees
[11:38] it a lot on Facebook, right? They they
[11:39] sure like to battle on Facebook, don't
[11:41] they? uh believers, some believers,
[11:43] they'll be fighting against other
[11:44] believers, but your battle's not against
[11:48] Facebook. Your battle is not against uh
[11:52] someone that would uh be mean to you.
[11:53] Your battle's not against them. It's a
[11:55] spirit that's behind them anointing
[11:57] them, right? It it it's not against that
[12:01] individual. It's against actually
[12:03] spiritual wickedness in high places
[12:05] trying to set up uh snares, right? The
[12:07] devil's trying to set up snares. The
[12:09] devil's trying to get you in a snare.
[12:12] But he's using other people to try to
[12:14] get you in a snare. But the Bible says
[12:16] don't get focus on other people. The
[12:19] Bible says focus on getting your armor
[12:21] on.
[12:22] Amen. Focus on having the word of God on
[12:26] you, walking in the spirit, being ready
[12:28] to battle against the enemy.
[12:32] And church, we know the six pieces of
[12:33] armor, right? Six is the number of
[12:35] anointed man. Adam was the anointed man.
[12:37] day on day six, Jesus had six anointings
[12:40] in Isaiah
[12:41] 59. But look at verse 18. Ephesians
[12:44] 6:18. What is this armor call you to do?
[12:47] Pray always with all prayer and
[12:50] supplication the spirit and watching
[12:51] there unto with all perseverance and
[12:54] supplication for all saints. So see,
[12:58] when you've got the spirit of of when
[12:59] you've got the armor of God on, you're
[13:01] praying as you're talking to this person
[13:03] that's giving you trouble, right? You're
[13:05] praying when you when you leave the
[13:07] presence of that person. You're praying,
[13:09] right? That's what the Bible says.
[13:11] Praying for all. Hallelujah. With all
[13:15] perseverance. Now, perseverance means
[13:17] that keep trying. Keep fighting. Don't
[13:20] give up. Don't be discouraged.
[13:24] Hallelujah. Keep going. Don't quit the
[13:26] fight. Praise God. So, it's all prayer
[13:29] and all perseverance. Amen. Church, you
[13:32] either have two choices. Keep going or
[13:34] give up. Let's keep going by the grace
[13:36] of God. Hallelujah. Let's not give up
[13:39] the fight. Praise God. Because again,
[13:41] like David, he could have gave up here.
[13:43] But what if he would have gave up? He
[13:44] never would have experienced the joy of
[13:46] being king. Hallelujah. Praise God. I'll
[13:49] say this. Let me say like this. In
[13:51] predestination, God's not going to let
[13:53] you give up. Excuse me, brother.
[13:56] Hallelujah. You might feel like
[13:57] quitting. You might feel like giving up.
[13:59] God's going to help you not to give up.
[14:01] Hallelujah.
[14:03] Amen. He's going to send his spirit to
[14:05] uh in other words, God's spirit is going
[14:07] to get you out of all the messes.
[14:08] Remember, David almost fall almost. But
[14:11] God stepped in and delivered him. Amen.
[14:15] That's right. God's going to help you
[14:17] not to give up. Hallelujah. God's going
[14:19] to help you to overcome because God is
[14:22] fighting your battles. Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:24] You put on the armor of God and God's
[14:27] spirit fights your battles. Hallelujah.
[14:30] That's right.
[14:32] Now, let's also go back to Romans 7
[14:34] here. Just a reminder, I was I've been I
[14:36] listened to all four uh this week, you
[14:38] know, I'm off of work now. And now you
[14:40] guys Now you brothers are done with
[14:41] school, right? School year is all done.
[14:43] Well, praise the Lord.
[14:45] Amen. Enjoy it. I'm enjoying it by God's
[14:48] grace. I hope you enjoy it. Maybe get a
[14:50] summer job or spend more time in the
[14:52] word of God. Hallelujah. Enjoy it,
[14:54] brothers and sisters. Right, Anna?
[14:55] You're all done now. Glory. Now enjoy
[14:57] your time with the family and with the
[14:59] Lord. Hallelujah. So, this week I
[15:02] listened to all four of the sermons,
[15:04] questions and answers in 1964. If you
[15:06] haven't listened to those, you'll be
[15:07] blessed. Uh, it's so it's so awesome.
[15:09] You'd hear Brother Ram talk to his
[15:10] church like like I talked to you on the
[15:12] Sunday night services. Sometimes I'll
[15:14] laugh, sometimes I'll joke, sometimes
[15:15] I'll be I'll cry. You can see brother
[15:17] Ram do all of those. He laughs, he
[15:20] jokes, he uh they they asked him, "Can
[15:23] can women shave legs?" And he said, "Am
[15:26] I reading that right?" He said, "I'll
[15:28] just leave that up to you.
[15:30] He just laughs. Everybody laughs in the
[15:32] church. You just get to see what would a
[15:34] prophet be like with his people, right?
[15:37] And it gives us a it just gives us an
[15:39] encouragement. That's how sometimes the
[15:41] pastor is with the
[15:43] people. Hallelujah. It was just so
[15:45] wonderful to listen to those this week.
[15:46] If you haven't done it, you ought to do
[15:48] it. But in one of those questions, they
[15:51] asked Brother Brandham, um, I can't seem
[15:53] to get victory over sin.
[15:56] and he take and and so brother Ram takes
[15:58] him to Romans 7 where Paul talks about
[16:01] his battle with
[16:02] sin.
[16:04] Okay, now let's go down to verse uh 15.
[16:08] For that which I do I allow
[16:11] not. For what I would that I do not, but
[16:14] what I hate that I do. So Paul's talking
[16:17] about his battle with
[16:18] sin. When I set out to do something
[16:21] good, sometimes I don't do it. And
[16:24] sometimes I do things I actually hate
[16:26] that I
[16:27] do. See church, it's okay to hate the
[16:30] sin. The Bible said to hate the sin.
[16:34] Right? Okay. So we see the even the
[16:37] great apostle
[16:39] Paul. Even he did things that he
[16:42] hated.
[16:45] Hallelujah. Verse 17. Now then it is no
[16:48] more I that do it, but sin that dwells
[16:50] within me. So see, when we sin, we've
[16:53] got to remember it's really not me
[16:55] sinning. It's not the soul that's
[16:57] sinning. It's the flesh that's sinning.
[17:00] And of course, the mind gave the mind
[17:02] gave the flesh permission. And the
[17:04] church said, "Right, so part of you did
[17:07] allow it. Your spirit allowed your flesh
[17:09] to sin, but the soul of you, the soul of
[17:12] you can never sin and has never sinned."
[17:14] Praise God. When it's anointed by the
[17:16] Holy Ghost. Right? So Paul points that
[17:19] out. I do things I hate, but really it's
[17:22] not me. It's the flesh man, right? And
[17:25] it's the human spirit. It's the human
[17:27] thinking that gets the wrong anointing
[17:29] on it. It's the battle against yourself.
[17:33] The greatest battle ever fought. Verse
[17:35] 18, for I know that in me that is in my
[17:37] flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to
[17:39] will is present with me. Now I have this
[17:41] I have this desire. I have this will
[17:44] that I want to do right.
[17:47] But how to perform that which is good, I
[17:49] find not. I have good intentions when I
[17:51] start the morning, but I don't do the
[17:54] things I want to do sometimes. Now, you
[17:56] ought to rejoice when you do. When you
[17:59] do the things you set out to do for God,
[18:01] you ought to rejoice.
[18:03] But all of us know this week maybe there
[18:05] was a day we didn't do what we we should
[18:07] have
[18:08] done. Paul says, I understand that,
[18:12] right? Verse 19, for the good that I
[18:16] would, I do not, but the evil which I
[18:18] would not, that I
[18:22] do. Hallelujah. And then in verse 20, he
[18:25] says, it's the sin that dwells within
[18:26] me. Now, I want to go down to verse 23.
[18:29] But I see another law of my members,
[18:31] waring. Let's all say waring, can we?
[18:33] War. So Paul says, this is the war. I
[18:36] want to do good, but then sometimes I do
[18:38] sin. I do things that I hate. It's a war
[18:42] I've got to overcome.
[18:44] Right? And so we see David and when we
[18:46] get to David and look at some of his
[18:47] mistakes today, it was a war. He had
[18:50] lost the battle, but he never he never
[18:53] quit fighting. Hallelujah. He might lose
[18:55] a few battles, but you're going to win
[18:57] the war. Praise God.
[19:00] Amen. Now, look at verse
[19:04] 24. What does Paul say about himself?
[19:07] Oh, holy man that I am. Did I read that
[19:09] right? What'd he say, church? Oh,
[19:13] wretched. Oh, wretched man that I am.
[19:17] Who shall deliver me from the body of
[19:18] this death? Did you see the video I put
[19:20] out this week? Brother Ram called
[19:21] himself a
[19:23] jellyfish. Brother Ram called him a son
[19:25] of Kish, which is Saul, King Saul. He
[19:28] look at that. Brother Ram puts himself
[19:29] on the level of Saul who was chasened
[19:31] after David, a
[19:34] murderer. And remember church, remember
[19:36] the quote? Brother Ram said, "I was in
[19:38] the shoes of Balum in 1947 when he was
[19:41] bringing all the hardest cases in the
[19:43] prayer line first." Brother Ram said, "I
[19:45] did that for six months, and the angel
[19:47] Lord rebuked me for it." He said, "I was
[19:50] basically tempting
[19:51] God." Hallelujah. So that there's three.
[19:53] Brother Ram says, Brother Ram says, "I'm
[19:55] like Balum sometimes. I'm like a
[19:57] jellyfish sometimes. I'm like Saul
[20:01] sometimes." And and then Paul says, "I'm
[20:04] a wretched man sometimes.
[20:07] Praise
[20:08] God. So, what am I I'm letting you know
[20:11] that it's okay to fight the battle of
[20:13] sin. You're going to lose some battles,
[20:16] but don't focus on the flesh. Get your
[20:18] focus back on the soul.
[20:23] Yes. He says, "Oh, wretched man that I
[20:26] am." Verse 25, "I thank God through
[20:28] Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
[20:30] mind, I myself serve the law of God, but
[20:32] with the flesh the law of sin."
[20:35] So there's this great battle between my
[20:37] mind and sin because the soul is always
[20:40] going to do what's right. It's it's got
[20:42] eternal life. Hallelujah. But it's the
[20:45] battle between the mind and the flesh.
[20:48] But look at chapter 8 verse one. Now
[20:50] there is now no condemnation. Let's say
[20:53] no condemnation. Ready? No condemnation
[20:55] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[20:58] walk not after the flesh but after the
[21:00] spirit. That's what we have to have. We
[21:02] have to have a short memory, church.
[21:03] Remember, we have to have a short
[21:04] memory. Yes, I'm a wretched man, but
[21:06] there's no condemnation. I'm still going
[21:09] to heaven. Praise God.
[21:11] I have no fear on judgment day because
[21:13] Jesus paid for all my sins. The wage of
[21:16] sin is death and Jesus paid those wages.
[21:19] Praise God. He died for me with my sins
[21:23] upon him. Hallelujah.
[21:27] Amen. And then church, don't forget,
[21:30] hallelujah. Chapter eight of Romans is a
[21:32] great encouragement. Praise God.
[21:38] Hallelujah. The Bible gives us so many
[21:41] encouragements in chapter
[21:43] 8. The Bible says in verse 28, "All
[21:45] things work together for them that love
[21:47] the
[21:48] Lord." Hallelujah. If God be for us, who
[21:51] shall be against us? In verse 31. Verse
[21:54] 33, remember he talked about how he was
[21:57] sinning, right? But verse 33, who shall
[21:59] lay anything to the charge of God's
[22:01] elect? It is God that justifieth.
[22:05] So we must recognize we're we're like
[22:07] wretched people here. Our flesh is wreck
[22:09] wretched here. But Jesus has already
[22:12] assured us a future with no sin. Amen.
[22:16] He's already assured us a place in
[22:18] heaven. Hallelujah. Because nobody can
[22:20] put any charges to us. There's no
[22:22] condemnation to us. Oh church, sometimes
[22:24] we forget what the cross did for us. We
[22:27] forget that our Goliath was defeated.
[22:29] Praise God. Amen. Don't forget Goliath
[22:32] is defeated. Death is defeated. Praise
[22:35] God. We have a champion who overcame for
[22:38] us. Jesus Christ the righteous.
[22:40] Hallelujah.
[22:42] Glory to God.
[22:44] Amen. Yes. Verse 34. Who is he that
[22:48] condemnth? Who's going to condemn you on
[22:50] judgment day? There's no one to condemn
[22:52] you because Jesus took your
[22:54] condemnation. Amen.
[22:56] And then verse 35, who shall separate us
[22:59] from the love of Christ? What makes you
[23:02] a happy man? What makes you a uh what
[23:05] gives you perseverance? The fact that
[23:07] Jesus loves you.
[23:12] Verse 37. No, in all these things we are
[23:15] more than conquerors. I'm a wretched
[23:17] man, but I'm more than a conqueror.
[23:19] Praise
[23:21] God.
[23:23] Verse 39, nothing shall be able to
[23:26] separate us from the love of God which
[23:29] is in Christ Jesus our
[23:31] Lord. Nothing can separate you from the
[23:35] love of
[23:36] God.
[23:38] Hallelujah. So, Brother Ram reads Romans
[23:40] 7 and they ask him, uh, Brother
[23:43] Brandham, uh, why can't I surrender to
[23:46] God? And brother Ram says, well, if
[23:47] you're a wife, when you get married,
[23:49] don't you surrender to the leadership of
[23:50] your husband? And brother Ram says, "Do
[23:52] that with Jesus." And then brother Ram
[23:55] says, "Whatever sin you're battling
[23:56] with, do the
[23:58] opposite." Right? So this is how you do
[24:01] it. Uh the Bible said, "Him that steal,
[24:04] let him steal no more, but let him be
[24:05] generous and let him give with his
[24:07] hands." Makes things and give with his
[24:09] hands. That's in Ephesians chapter 4. So
[24:12] that's the key to overcoming any sin. If
[24:15] you're stealing things with your hands
[24:17] or if you're if you're stealing things
[24:18] with your
[24:20] computer, then you then give instead.
[24:23] When you feel the temptation to steal,
[24:25] give,
[24:27] right? Hallelujah. When you feel the
[24:30] temptation to lie, tell the truth
[24:34] instead. Do exactly the opposite. If you
[24:37] feel the temptation of dirty thoughts,
[24:39] turn those thoughts directly to
[24:40] something good. Praise God.
[24:42] do exactly the
[24:45] opposite. Something rises up and you
[24:47] want to say something, you want to say a
[24:49] word back instead of saying something
[24:50] evil, say something good. Amen. Remember
[24:54] when brother's wife, remember that story
[24:55] when Brother Am's wife slammed the door
[24:57] in his face? How would you like it if
[24:59] somebody slammed the door in your face?
[25:01] What would be the first words out of
[25:02] your mouth? You know what brother's
[25:04] words were? Poor little fella didn't
[25:08] mean that. Now, that's what we need
[25:10] today. Praise God.
[25:12] Hallelujah. Look at that. It's a perfect
[25:14] example. Instead of getting mad and say,
[25:16] "Oh, she slammed in my face. Let me go
[25:18] tell her what. Let me open that door and
[25:19] I'll tell her some something about it."
[25:22] No, brother said, "Oh, he felt sorry for
[25:24] her. Oh, she didn't mean that." Now,
[25:27] church, that is the That's the perfect
[25:29] example. Uh, I didn't even plan to say
[25:31] that. That's a perfect example of say
[25:33] the opposite of what your flesh wants to
[25:35] say.
[25:37] Hallelujah. That's right. Do exactly the
[25:40] opposite. Now remember, she got a tumor
[25:42] because of
[25:43] that, right? Sister Ma, what a faithful
[25:46] servant she was. What a faithful
[25:49] servant. Brother Ram said, I was
[25:51] listening to 64. Brother Ram said he
[25:53] would come and say, "I love you, honey."
[25:54] And she would joke around and say, "No,
[25:55] you don't." And brother Ram's like,
[25:57] "Well, maybe I don't show her enough
[25:59] signs." He said, "Because as soon as he
[26:01] gets in from the meeting, he wants to go
[26:03] out and hunt and fish." That's what he
[26:05] said. And then Brother Ram would say,
[26:07] "Can you sit down with me?" She's like,
[26:10] "I I've got to go wash dishes. I can't,
[26:11] Bill." He's like, "Come on. I want to
[26:13] show you." So, when he would want to
[26:14] show her some love, she's like, "I got
[26:16] too much to
[26:17] do." When she wanted when when when she
[26:19] would want some love, brother Ram said,
[26:20] "I got to go out and fish and hunt,
[26:23] church. You should listen to that." He
[26:26] said, "But we get along fine, don't we?"
[26:29] Now, I'm not giving you brothers
[26:30] permission to leave your wives, right?
[26:32] And go hunting on hunting trips and
[26:34] stuff like that. I'm saying that look,
[26:36] every marriage has issues they got to
[26:38] work
[26:40] through. But in moments of like this, at
[26:42] moments when there's disrespect, the uh
[26:45] look at the Holy Spirit, come on,
[26:47] Brother Brandham. He does exactly the
[26:48] opposite of what his flesh probably
[26:50] wanted to do. Poor little fella. She
[26:53] didn't mean
[26:54] that. Now, let's let's make sure we say
[26:56] that to somebody today or this week that
[26:59] hurts our feelings. Oh, they didn't mean
[27:00] that. I'm going to forgive them right
[27:02] away. You know what the Bible calls
[27:04] that? Have tender compassions on one
[27:06] another.
[27:09] Tenderheartedness. Hey, how many want a
[27:10] tender heart?
[27:14] So, brother Ram says, when you got a
[27:15] complex or you can't overcome or you
[27:17] have this battle, oh, I just keep
[27:19] falling into sin. I do things that I
[27:20] hate. Do the exact opposite of that.
[27:24] So, like if your phone, if you're having
[27:26] trouble with your phone, set your phone
[27:28] down and walk away. Amen.
[27:32] Now, church, you've already got to make
[27:33] sure I put this little sticker on here
[27:35] because there's already radiation. You
[27:36] can't you shouldn't keep it on your body
[27:38] very much, right?
[27:40] And the this little sticker will take
[27:42] some of the radiation away from it.
[27:43] It'll deflect the radiation instead of
[27:45] like So, it's already a good idea to
[27:47] physically set your phone
[27:50] down and be a Rod tells me that all the
[27:52] time now, Brother Jesse. He said, "You
[27:54] got to you got to do that. I set my
[27:55] phone down. I just leave it leave it
[27:56] alone." What a good example for all of
[27:59] us. If we have ever ever have anything
[28:00] on the phone tempting us, set it down.
[28:03] Just go walk
[28:06] away. It's a good idea. Do the exact
[28:09] opposite. Don't see. Don't Don't keep
[28:11] looking. Don't keep scrolling. Set it
[28:12] down. Walk away. Go do something
[28:14] productive. Praise God.
[28:17] Yes. Now, all right.
[28:20] Now, church, there were so many times in
[28:23] David's life where he committed
[28:25] iniquity. Now remember, iniquity is
[28:27] called wickedness in the Hebrew or
[28:31] Greek. And it's and brother Brand makes
[28:33] it simple. Iniquity is when you know
[28:36] something you shouldn't do, but you do
[28:38] it anyway. Sound like Romans
[28:40] 7. It's a perfect uh illustration.
[28:43] Romans 7 is a perfect illustration of
[28:46] iniquity. And church, you all got them.
[28:50] We all got iniquity. We all did
[28:53] something this week we know we should
[28:55] not have
[28:55] done including
[28:58] me. So let's be honest today.
[29:01] Hallelujah. Let's let the word of God
[29:03] speak to us today. I think this will
[29:05] help you because it helped me. Helped me
[29:07] so much I started doing a little Bible
[29:08] study on it. So I thought it would help
[29:10] me so much. But remember there's
[29:12] numerous times David committed iniquity.
[29:15] Uh we're going to see today he lied to
[29:17] the
[29:18] priest. Talk about that. What what would
[29:20] be the equivalent today? lying to your
[29:23] pastor. Hallelujah. Or lying to the
[29:25] guest preacher,
[29:28] evangelist. He lied to the priest.
[29:31] That's iniquity. And church, he knew it
[29:33] was a He knew it was
[29:34] wrong. He pretended to be insane. It
[29:38] wasn't a real thing. It was
[29:42] pretend. Third, he committed
[29:45] adultery. Fourth, he had Uriah
[29:48] murdered. Fifth, he had polygamy. He
[29:51] married too many women. The Bible said
[29:52] he wasn't The Bible said kings should
[29:54] not multiply women to
[29:56] themselves. He He knew better, right? He
[30:00] knew better. He knew the law of
[30:03] God,
[30:04] right? And he had poor fathering.
[30:07] Remember, he failed to correct his son
[30:09] Amnan on the awful sin Amnan did. And
[30:12] even Abselon, he wasn't the best father,
[30:16] we'd
[30:17] say, right? And then remember at that la
[30:20] at the end of his life, what did he do?
[30:22] He numbered Israel in pride. Oh, how
[30:24] great is my church become? Well, I want
[30:26] I should count how big is my church and
[30:28] how how great am I
[30:30] today? That's
[30:32] iniquity. Praise
[30:34] God. So, if you have your Bibles, let's
[30:37] go to 1st Samuel
[30:39] 21 verse
[30:44] one. Let's look at a couple of these.
[30:46] Maybe we I had looked at them for a
[30:47] while. They were kind of fresh to me
[30:49] when I heard him
[30:51] preached. 1st Samuel 21 verse
[30:57] one. Then came David to Knob to Alec the
[31:00] priest. And Aim him was afraid at the
[31:02] meeting of David, and said unto him, Why
[31:04] art thou alone, and no man with thee?
[31:09] And David said unto him the priest, "The
[31:11] king hath commanded me a business, and
[31:13] hath said unto me, let no man know
[31:15] anything of the business whereabout I
[31:17] send thee, and what have I commanded
[31:20] thee? And I have appointed my servants
[31:22] to such and such a
[31:24] place." Was that the truth,
[31:27] church? That was a bold-faced lie. We'd
[31:30] say the king Saul did not send him
[31:33] there. He was running from King Saul.
[31:37] Is that
[31:39] right? Wow. So, David lied to the
[31:42] preacher. Well, yeah. It's kind of like
[31:43] how Abraham lied twice to two kings. So
[31:46] did
[31:47] Isaac. Kind of like how brother Ram lied
[31:49] to the
[31:52] IRS. Praise
[31:55] God. So, David's running from Saul. And
[31:58] of course, Saul wanted to kill
[32:00] him. And he's he pretends to be on a
[32:03] secret mission. Now, church, let's be
[32:06] honest. How many times do we pretend
[32:07] everything's going good? Oh, I'm living
[32:09] holy. Uh uh I'm serving the Lord with
[32:11] the best that I can. Are
[32:14] we? But sometimes we
[32:17] pretend. You know, the opposite of
[32:19] pretending is uh guile. No, no, I'm
[32:22] sorry. Uh pretending is guile. Yeah,
[32:25] pretend. The word guile means to
[32:27] pretend. And remember Jesus told
[32:28] Nathaniel, he said, "You're a man in
[32:30] whom is no pretending." And the church
[32:33] said, "Hallelujah.
[32:36] Now church, how do we live in a state
[32:38] where we don't pretend? We constantly
[32:40] confess our sin and we know the gravity
[32:42] of our
[32:43] sin. In other words, we realize how evil
[32:46] sin
[32:47] is and we are we're actively trying not
[32:51] to sin. Praise
[32:53] God.
[32:55] Hallelujah. So he lies. Now therefore,
[32:58] what is under thine hand? Give me uh the
[33:01] five loaves of bread in mine hand or
[33:02] what there is present. And the priest
[33:05] answered David and said, "There is no
[33:06] common bread under mine hand, but there
[33:08] is hollowed bread, if the young men have
[33:10] kept themselves at least from women."
[33:12] And David answered the priest and said
[33:14] to him, "Of a truth, women have been
[33:15] kept from us about these three days
[33:17] since I came out, and the vessels of the
[33:19] young men are holy in the bread as it as
[33:22] in a manner of common. Yay, though it
[33:25] were sanctified this day in the vessel."
[33:27] So the priest gave the hollowed bread
[33:29] for there was no bread there but the
[33:31] shoe bread that was taken from before
[33:33] the Lord to put hot bread in the day
[33:35] when it was taken
[33:37] away. Hallelujah. So we can see this
[33:41] story church and what a
[33:42] story. Now this story uh it shows
[33:46] David's failure right? But it also shows
[33:49] the grace or we'd say the mercy of God
[33:51] on his life
[33:53] right? So grace is a unmmerited gift but
[33:56] mercy is less punishment than you
[34:00] deserve. Now let me do you remember the
[34:03] story as it as it
[34:05] unfolds uh in the next chapter King Saul
[34:09] learns that David went to a himch and
[34:11] what did he do? He killed at least 85
[34:17] priests. So David had some part in this.
[34:20] He didn't tell Ahimch all the
[34:23] truth, right? And then it gets back to
[34:27] King Saul that David was there and A
[34:28] himch didn't uh himch didn't know what
[34:31] had happened. But through David's lie,
[34:34] this is King Saul's response. So David
[34:36] has some part in this. I'm not saying
[34:38] he's totally guilty, but he has some
[34:40] part in this because he lied. Look what
[34:42] happens when we lie. Trouble comes
[34:44] afterwards.
[34:46] Hallelujah. Only trouble is going to
[34:48] come from lying.
[34:51] Everybody see
[34:53] that only trouble comes from lying. But
[34:56] does does David get help? Yes, he got a
[34:58] sword, right? And he got bread and he
[35:01] keeps living. So God has mercy on
[35:05] David. And then if you know Matthew,
[35:07] let's go to Matthew
[35:10] 12:1. If you haven't read this
[35:13] recently, Jesus speaks of this
[35:21] situation. Matthew 12
[35:27] 1-8. And and this is the story uh
[35:31] Scoffield calls it. Jesus declares
[35:32] himself Lord of the Sabbath. And in
[35:35] verse one and two, uh the disciples are
[35:38] walking on the Sabbath. They're picking
[35:40] corn to
[35:41] eat. And they say, "Oh, it's not lawful
[35:44] for you to do that. You're not supposed
[35:45] to do that on the Sabbath." Verse three.
[35:48] But he said to them, "Have you not read
[35:49] what David did when he was hungered and
[35:51] they that were with him? How he entered
[35:54] into the house of God and did eat the
[35:55] shoebread, which was not lawful for him
[35:57] to eat, neither for them which were with
[35:59] him, but only for the
[36:02] priests?" So the Pharisees are are are
[36:05] being so legalistic about this.
[36:08] Oh, you can't even if you're hungry, you
[36:10] can't even uh pick
[36:12] corn. They're being too legal about
[36:14] this. But Jesus says, "Listen, go back
[36:17] to David. Haven't you read in David
[36:19] where God had mercy on David because he
[36:21] was
[36:23] hungry? David got to eat bread that he
[36:25] wasn't supposed to eat." Right? David
[36:29] wasn't of the tribe of Levi. He was a
[36:32] tribe of Judah. Praise God. Amen. The
[36:34] lion of the tribe of Judah. Hallelujah.
[36:37] But yet he gets to eat shoeb bread that
[36:39] doesn't belong to him. Why? Because he
[36:41] just needed it.
[36:44] And so God showed mercy on David. He
[36:47] needed a weapon and he needed food. So
[36:50] God provided it. Maybe it didn't come
[36:52] the way he expected, but God was showing
[36:54] him mercy. Even when he was out of the
[36:57] will of God. Hallelujah.
[36:59] Even when he's running away from Saul
[37:02] and lying and pretending and not telling
[37:04] the truth, God still shows mercy when we
[37:07] make
[37:09] mistakes. Are we going to suffer for it?
[37:12] Yes. Are there going to be consequences
[37:14] when we lie or lust or get prideful or
[37:17] whatever we do? Yes, there's going to be
[37:19] bad consequences. But that doesn't mean
[37:21] God forsakes you. The love of God can
[37:25] nothing can separate us from the love of
[37:26] God. Hallelujah.
[37:32] And then he reads verse five. Now this
[37:34] is encouraging to me. Or have you not
[37:37] read in the law how that on the Sabbath
[37:38] days the priests in the temple profane
[37:40] the Sabbath and are blameless. So Jesus
[37:43] saying David was blameless when he ate
[37:45] the bread. Now he wasn't blameless when
[37:47] he
[37:48] lied but he was blameless eating the
[37:50] bread because he had a need of it.
[37:53] Hallelujah.
[37:55] And here the priests they they work on
[37:58] the Sabbath. They would kill the
[37:59] sacrifices, right? They would do all
[38:01] this work. They would burn them. Uh they
[38:04] would do all they would uh they they
[38:06] were involved on all four five
[38:08] sacrifices, right? The burn offering,
[38:11] the uh uh the meal offering, the thank
[38:14] offering, uh the sin offering, I can't
[38:15] remember the fifth one, trespass
[38:17] offering. They they they worked the
[38:20] whole Sabbath day. But God said, "Even
[38:21] though you're working, you're blameless
[38:24] because you need to
[38:25] work." It was
[38:28] needful.
[38:31] Hallelujah. Verse six. But I say unto
[38:34] you that in this place is one greater
[38:35] than the temple. But if ye had known
[38:38] what this meanth, I will have mercy and
[38:40] not sacrifice, ye would not have
[38:42] condemned the guiltless. So Jesus says
[38:44] David is is innocent of eating the bread
[38:48] and the priests are innocent when they
[38:50] work on the
[38:51] Sabbath. Hallelujah. Because something
[38:54] has to give. Hallelujah. God has to show
[38:57] mercy. Praise God. For the son of man is
[39:01] Lord even on the Sabbath day.
[39:03] Hallelujah. He's Lord of the Sabbath
[39:06] day.
[39:07] Hallelujah. So the Sabbath was created
[39:10] for the man, not man for the Sabbath.
[39:13] Hallelujah. So God wants to show us
[39:16] mercy. That's the key word, mercy. I
[39:18] love that name, brother. Hallelujah. We
[39:19] see that a lot. I will have mercy and
[39:22] not
[39:23] sacrifice.
[39:26] Hallelujah. So I want you to see that
[39:28] there. Now, Brother Brandham reads that
[39:31] verse. And again, I heard it yesterday.
[39:35] They asked brother Brandham, "Could
[39:36] people that are divorced and remarried
[39:38] like two or three times, they ask
[39:40] brother Brandham, can they go in the
[39:41] rapture?" And brother Brandham says,"I
[39:44] can only say one thing. Adulters will
[39:46] not inherit the kingdom of heaven."
[39:47] That's all I can
[39:49] say. He says, "But please let me give
[39:51] you a little scripture. If you're happy
[39:54] living with your husband, living with
[39:55] your wife, just remain that way. Don't
[39:57] leave them little children without a
[39:59] home and things like that."
[40:02] He says, ' And you remember Jesus said
[40:04] of David when he was hungry, he entered
[40:06] into the temple of God and eat the
[40:08] shoebread which is only lawful for the
[40:09] priest but is found blameless. The
[40:12] priests also blasphemed the Sabbath upon
[40:15] the Sabbath day and are found blameless.
[40:17] And a greater than the Sabbath was
[40:19] here. He said, "Let's leave it up to God
[40:23] and just live the way you are. Just live
[40:26] for Christ now." He said, "There might
[40:28] be a chance of you getting in. Two
[40:30] wrongs will never righten
[40:32] one. Right? So, it'd be wrong for these
[40:36] adulterers to leave each other and leave
[40:38] the children without
[40:39] homes. So, brother just said, "Stay
[40:42] together. Uh, just stay there. There's a
[40:45] chance you might get in because God
[40:47] showed mercy to David and God showed
[40:49] mercy to the
[40:53] priests." Then, Brother Ram says, "I'll
[40:55] say this. You got if you got the wrong
[40:57] companion in this life, he says you'll
[40:59] have the right one in the other one. All
[41:01] wrongs will be made
[41:03] right.
[41:06] Hallelujah. Praise God. So the first one
[41:09] that we went through there, he lies to
[41:11] the preacher. We'll say like that so we
[41:14] can
[41:16] understand. And yet God shows him
[41:19] mercy. So that was yeah during this
[41:21] time. This was chapter 21 there. He's
[41:24] hiding. He's running from Saul and he
[41:26] tells the iniquity of
[41:28] lying. Now next he pretends to be
[41:31] insane. So let's go back to First Samuel
[41:33] 21
[41:36] 10-15. 1st Samuel 21
[41:44] 10-15. Now church, this is amazing story
[41:46] because he goes to Gath. He goes to the
[41:49] hometown of Goliath. And it's amazing he
[41:53] lived through
[41:54] this. That was Goliath's
[41:58] hometown. Are you with me,
[42:01] church? Think about walking into the
[42:03] hometown of the man that you that you
[42:06] defeated their champ. He was their
[42:09] champion. You walk in their town and
[42:11] somehow somehow there's a hedge of
[42:14] protection around him. We know how. It
[42:16] was the spirit of the living God.
[42:18] Hallelujah.
[42:21] It' be like walking in the house of the
[42:22] man that you knocked out or defeated or
[42:25] amongst his family. He's right there in
[42:29] Gath. My goodness. Verse 11. And the
[42:32] servants of Ach said unto him, "Is not
[42:34] this David, the king of the land? Did
[42:36] not they sing one to another of him in
[42:39] the dances, saying, Saul has slain his
[42:40] thousands, and David is 10 thousands?"
[42:43] And David laid up these things, these
[42:44] words in his heart, and was sore afraid
[42:46] of Akish, the king of Gath. Now,
[42:51] church, David wrote a song about this
[42:54] experience, which we'll read next that
[42:57] I'd forgotten about, but I came across
[42:58] it this week when I was reading through
[43:00] the book of
[43:01] Psalms. So, he look what does he do? He
[43:04] stores these words up in his heart. In
[43:06] other words, he gets
[43:09] afraid. But he just didn't get afraid.
[43:12] He
[43:13] prayed. I hope you pray when you get
[43:16] afraid. Hallelujah. It's okay to feel
[43:19] fear. Remember Paul said, "I fear fear
[43:22] within and fear without." Remember that
[43:25] scripture. So in this in this particular
[43:27] chapter, we only see David getting
[43:29] afraid. But next, we're going to go read
[43:31] what what he did when he got
[43:35] afraid. Verse 13. I love what the king
[43:38] says here. It was It's kind of funny.
[43:40] and he changed his behavior before them
[43:41] and fainted himself mad in their hands
[43:43] and scrabbled on the doors of the gate
[43:46] and let his spittle fall down on his
[43:48] beard. So he acts like he's insane. He's
[43:51] got spit all over his
[43:56] beard. This is the same man who defeated
[43:58] Goliath. He said, "You he said, "Oh, you
[44:01] guys are afraid. I'll go fight him. I
[44:03] don't even need a sword. I just need
[44:04] stones."
[44:06] He's he's so he's he's so bold against
[44:09] this giant. But here amongst the king,
[44:10] he acts he he thinks of what what what
[44:12] way can I get out of this? I'll just act
[44:14] crazy. I'll let my spit fly all over.
[44:16] Now he's got spit hanging off his
[44:21] beard. Church, you'll do a lot of you'll
[44:23] do a lot of things. You'll be surprised
[44:25] when you're
[44:26] afraid. I'll say it like this. You might
[44:29] stoop really low when you're afraid, but
[44:32] don't be discouraged. God will bring you
[44:33] out. Amen.
[44:36] You might embarrass yourself
[44:38] tremendously, but don't be discouraged.
[44:40] God will bring you out of it. Praise
[44:42] God. He'll bring you back. I can't say
[44:45] it like this. He'll bring you back to to
[44:46] not pretending, and he'll bring you back
[44:49] to feeling bold again.
[44:51] Amen. That's right.
[44:56] I love this
[44:57] story. Look at verse 14. Then said Akish
[45:01] unto his servants, "Lo, you see the man
[45:03] is mad. Wherefore then have you brought
[45:05] him to me? Have I need of mad men that
[45:08] ye have brought this fellow to play the
[45:10] mad man in my presence? Shall this
[45:12] fellow come into my house?" He's like,
[45:15] "Do I need more crazy people? I've
[45:17] already got enough crazy people in
[45:19] Gath. Do I need any more of
[45:23] these?" Hallelujah. Isn't it amazing,
[45:26] church?
[45:28] He's in the hometown of
[45:31] Goliath. The king is He's in the prince
[45:34] of the king. But the king's like, "I He
[45:37] must have had a bunch of crazy men
[45:38] around him recently. He's like, I don't
[45:39] need one more. Just throw him out of the
[45:42] city. Why didn't he kill
[45:44] him?" Because God had mercy on him. God
[45:49] had his hand on him. Praise
[45:51] God. Aren't you glad God has his hand on
[45:55] you? Absolutely. Now, there's a whole
[45:58] song David writes about this. Psalm
[46:02] 34. Let's turn there. Just read it this
[46:06] week and I was like, "Oh my, I'd
[46:08] forgotten about
[46:10] this." So, when David heard he was
[46:13] before Akish in the giant's hometown,
[46:18] talk about being on enemy
[46:20] grounds. He got afraid, but he just
[46:23] didn't get afraid. Thank God he wrote
[46:25] down his song that he
[46:27] sang. Can I say it like this? He made
[46:30] sure he had a little praise and worship.
[46:31] He did his He did his devotion time and
[46:34] sang songs before church. Can I say like
[46:37] this? He He did his devotions and sang
[46:39] the song at the end of the day even
[46:40] though he was
[46:42] afraid. Praise God. In other words, sing
[46:45] to God even when you're afraid. Read the
[46:48] Bible even when you're afraid.
[46:51] Even now, church, you know, you know
[46:52] this. It's just going to feel like
[46:54] you're going through the motions, but
[46:55] you're not.
[46:57] God sees your effort. Amen. God sees how
[47:00] you're trying to cast down anything that
[47:02] exalts itself against the word of God.
[47:04] God sees you're persevering. Praise God.
[47:07] Amen. Amen. Even if you don't feel it,
[47:10] go through the motions. In other words,
[47:12] bring your body into subjection to the
[47:14] word of God. That's a pretty good
[47:17] clap. Verse Psalm 34. Even before verse
[47:21] one, a psalm of David when he changed
[47:23] his behavior before Aimilec, I'm sorry,
[47:25] Aimilec who drove him away and when he
[47:29] departed. So we get his song before and
[47:33] we get a song after. I wonder if we can
[47:36] see the before and after in the
[47:38] story. I will bless the Lord at all
[47:42] times. His praise shall continually be
[47:44] in my mouth. Why? because I should have
[47:46] died in the hometown of of my greatest
[47:49] enemy. But I'm alive today. Amen.
[47:52] Church, you're alive today. Despite the
[47:54] struggles you've had, God has kept you
[47:56] alive. Amen. So bless the Lord at all
[47:59] times.
[48:03] My soul shall make her boast in the
[48:05] Lord, and the humble shall hear
[48:07] therefore and be glad. Oh, magnify the
[48:10] Lord with me, and let us exalt his name
[48:12] together. I sought the Lord and he heard
[48:14] me and delivered me from all my fears.
[48:17] So see he was afraid Akish is going to
[48:19] kill him but he sought the Lord. So
[48:22] there must have been a prayer meeting in
[48:24] there and the church
[48:26] said see when you're afraid church just
[48:28] stop and bow your head and say God be
[48:30] merciful to me. I am afraid right
[48:36] now. Verse five, they looked upon him or
[48:41] I'm sorry, they looked unto him and were
[48:42] enlightened and their faces were not
[48:44] ashamed. This poor man
[48:47] cried. This poor man cried and the Lord
[48:50] heard him and saved him out of all his
[48:52] troubles.
[48:54] See, so in the moment of your troubles,
[48:56] just look to God. Just cry out to God.
[48:58] God, there's got to be a way out.
[49:04] Now, church, here's a beautiful verse.
[49:06] The angel of the Lord encampeth round
[49:09] about them that fear him and deliver
[49:11] them. Hallelujah. So church, while
[49:14] David's spitting, now get that picture.
[49:15] He's spinning, acting crazy. He's just
[49:18] being crazy. The angel Lord is standing
[49:20] there protecting him.
[49:22] That's the reason Akish couldn't destroy
[49:25] him is because the angel of the Lord was
[49:28] guarding his servant. Praise God. Amen.
[49:31] Now look at that. You act so silly. You
[49:33] act You might act so ridiculous. You
[49:35] might act so wretched and poor and yet
[49:37] the angels they're commissioned to
[49:39] protect you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Think
[49:42] about that, church. Even when you sin,
[49:45] the angel Lord is encamped around you.
[49:48] Why? Because you fear the Lord and you
[49:50] really don't want to sin, but you give
[49:52] into your flesh.
[49:54] Is that right? That's right.
[49:58] He's acting like a mad man spitting all
[50:00] over the
[50:02] place. And yet the angel stands there,
[50:04] church. Now I don't know if it's sword
[50:06] drawn or not, but I'll just have it like
[50:07] his sword drawn. The angels there are
[50:08] protecting. This is God's
[50:12] servant. And look, he his influence is
[50:14] able to change the mind of the king. The
[50:16] king's not thinking about Goliath being
[50:18] dead. The king's like, I've got too many
[50:20] crazy people around
[50:22] here. The angel, the Lord, is protecting
[50:25] his servant. So see church, if the angel
[50:29] never left David when he's lying on the
[50:32] run, neither will the angel of the Lord
[50:34] leave you when you've lied and you're on
[50:36] the run.
[50:38] Or you embarrass yourself.
[50:44] Thank God the angel never leaves us.
[50:46] Amen. He takes a camp around
[50:49] us. Amen. You know, all these years,
[50:51] right, we quoted this scripture, the
[50:53] angel Lord encamps around those who fear
[50:55] God. What's the context? The context is
[50:57] David's acting like he's insane. Yet
[50:59] God's spirit never forsakes him.
[51:03] Amen.
[51:04] Hallelujah. In the hometown of his
[51:07] enemies. Praise God. Oh, the Bible said
[51:10] he prepared a table for me in the
[51:12] presence of my enemies.
[51:14] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Ah, never saw
[51:17] it like
[51:19] that. Verse eight. Oh, taste and see
[51:21] that the Lord is good. Blessed is a man
[51:24] that trusts in
[51:26] him. Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints,
[51:29] for there's no want to them that fear
[51:30] him. So, we're thinking about that Shane
[51:32] and Shane song, right? What's the
[51:34] context of that song? Acting like a
[51:36] crazy man in the presence of a
[51:38] Philistine
[51:40] king. I prayed before I went and
[51:43] pretended like I was
[51:45] insane. I cried upon God. I cried out to
[51:48] God and God heard my humble prayer.
[51:51] So, we'll think a little differently
[51:52] when we sing that song today, won't
[51:56] we? Verse 10. The young lions do lack
[51:59] and suffer hunger, but they that seek
[52:00] the Lord shall not want any good thing.
[52:03] Come ye children, hearken unto me. I
[52:05] will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[52:07] What man is he that desireth life and
[52:08] loveth many days, that he may see good.
[52:10] Now, why is he writing about that?
[52:12] Because he should have died. He should
[52:14] have had shorter days, right? Because
[52:16] that was the king of Gath.
[52:19] That would have been Goliath's
[52:21] king. But yet God extended his life. God
[52:25] gave him more years because of God's
[52:30] mercy. Keep thy tongue from evil and thy
[52:33] lips from speaking guile. See what what
[52:37] he just lied to the also he just lied to
[52:39] the
[52:40] priest. So David had just done two e
[52:42] evil things. He lied and
[52:45] pretended. And yet he's learning not to
[52:48] do it
[52:52] anymore. I trust somebody is being
[52:54] helped today by God's grace. Verse 14,
[52:57] "Depart from evil and do good. Seek
[52:59] peace and pursue it. The eyes of the
[53:01] Lord are open, I'm sorry, are upon the
[53:03] righteous, and his ears are open unto
[53:05] their cry. The face of the Lord is
[53:07] against them that do evil to cut off the
[53:10] remembrance of them from the earth. The
[53:11] righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and
[53:14] deliverth them out of all their
[53:15] troubles." That's the second time he
[53:17] said it, church. God is going to deliver
[53:20] you out of all your
[53:24] troubles. Maybe I'll say it again like
[53:26] David. God is going to deliver you out
[53:28] of all your
[53:32] troubles because he's the same
[53:34] yesterday, today, and
[53:36] forever. Verse 17. I'm sorry. Yeah.
[53:40] Yeah. 17. The righteous cry, and the
[53:42] Lord hearth him. Okay. Verse 18. The
[53:44] Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[53:45] broken heart, and save as such as be of
[53:47] a contra contrite spirit. So David was
[53:50] broken. He was crying before he went
[53:52] unto King
[53:53] Akish. He cried. He was praying,
[53:56] weeping. And God saw the broken heart.
[53:59] So God had mercy on
[54:02] him. That's what some of us need to do.
[54:05] We need to cry more to God. Hallelujah.
[54:07] We need to be more sincere with God and
[54:08] actually cry and tell God why we're
[54:12] afraid or why we're struggling. We need
[54:13] to tell God all about our troubles.
[54:15] Praise
[54:17] God. Verse 19. I wonder if anyone will
[54:20] say amen after this one. Many are the
[54:22] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[54:24] Lord deliverth him out of them
[54:28] all. He keepeth all of his bones. Not
[54:31] one of them is broken. Evil shall slay
[54:34] the wicked, and they that hate the
[54:36] righteous shall be desolate. The Lord
[54:37] redeemth the soul of his servants, and
[54:40] none of them that trust in him shall be
[54:43] desolate. Oh church, you have so many we
[54:46] have so many promises in this chapter.
[54:48] Praise God. God's going to hear me when
[54:50] I cry. God's close to me when I'm a bro
[54:53] when I'm brokenhearted. The angel of the
[54:55] Lord is right by me. Praise God. He's
[54:58] going to deliver me from all of my
[55:00] troubles. Praise God.
[55:02] Oh glory.
[55:05] Amen. Oh
[55:08] my. I will not become de desolate
[55:11] because I trust in God
[55:15] Almighty. All right. Sounds like
[55:17] everybody's getting tired, but bear with
[55:19] me here. Bear with
[55:22] me. Now, if you would go to Psalm
[55:25] chapter 40, this is where we started.
[55:32] Now, we're not told when this
[55:35] uh we're not told when this chapter was
[55:38] written like like like the other one,
[55:39] right? We're told the other one was
[55:40] written when David fained himself
[55:43] mad. This one we're not
[55:47] told. But if you look in verses 1 and
[55:50] two and three, he was in a pit. In other
[55:54] words, he was in a trap or a snare.
[55:57] Verse one, I waited patiently for the
[56:00] Lord. He inclined unto me and heard my
[56:03] cry. He brought me up also out of an
[56:05] horrible pit, out of the miry clay. See
[56:08] where we get that song? He brought me
[56:10] out of the miry
[56:11] clay and set my feet upon a rock and
[56:15] established my goings. He hath put a new
[56:17] song in my mouth, even praise unto our
[56:19] God. Many shall see it and fear and
[56:23] shall trust in the Lord.
[56:27] Let's keep going. Verse four. Blessed is
[56:29] the man that maketh the Lord his trust,
[56:31] and respect not the proud, nor such as
[56:34] turn aside to lies. Look at verse five
[56:37] again. This is this is very familiar,
[56:39] right? It's like Psalm 139. Verse 5.
[56:42] Many, oh Lord my God, are thy wonderful
[56:44] works which thou hast done. How many
[56:47] know God's done many wonderful things
[56:48] for you?
[56:52] and thy thoughts which are to usward,
[56:54] they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
[56:57] thee. If I would declare and speak them,
[57:00] they are more than can be
[57:02] numbered. So God has done so many great
[57:05] things. He's done millions of miracles.
[57:09] That that's a song we'll be familiar
[57:10] with. That's what David's saying. God
[57:13] has done so much for me. He has so many
[57:15] good thoughts toward me. Have you
[57:17] thought about that recently? What does
[57:18] God think about me? David said he has
[57:21] lots of good thoughts about
[57:23] me. You know why? Because David
[57:26] protected him when he was amongst his
[57:28] enemies. Has God protected you from your
[57:30] enemies today,
[57:31] church? Anybody faced any enemies this
[57:34] week? Maybe the pride of life, lust of
[57:36] the eyes, lust of flesh. Anybody face
[57:38] any of those enemies this week? Who
[57:40] stood with you? Jesus stood with you.
[57:42] Amen.
[57:44] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[57:47] Oh, David, thank you for getting in the
[57:49] spirit. Remember, this is the spirit
[57:51] giving him a
[57:55] song. Oh
[57:59] my. Look at Let's go down to verse 11. I
[58:02] got to I got to finish up here. I'm
[58:03] almost out of hour. Withhold not thou
[58:05] thy tender mercies from me, O Lord. Let
[58:08] thy loving kindness and thy truth
[58:10] continually preserve me.
[58:14] And then verse 12, for innumerable evils
[58:17] have compassed me about. Now I would
[58:19] think church, this is my guess. If you
[58:20] want to look up here, my guess is he
[58:22] wrote it during this time of his life.
[58:24] Not so much this time because this is
[58:28] this is a time when he was I would say
[58:29] at his
[58:31] lowest, right? Because even here, even
[58:33] when Abselon rebelled, he still had
[58:36] people with him. Now we know he had an
[58:38] ar well sometimes he had the army here.
[58:41] Sometimes he was all alone.
[58:43] So Psalm 40 seems to be when David was
[58:46] going through the hardest time when he
[58:49] was running from
[58:52] Saul. Innumerable evils have compassed
[58:54] me about church. We've all felt like
[58:57] there's been times where how can it get
[58:59] any worse? What else could go
[59:01] wrong? Why is everything why is life so
[59:06] hard? There's times David couldn't even
[59:09] number all of his struggles.
[59:13] And not only that, church, look at that.
[59:15] Not only does he have innumerable
[59:17] adversaries around
[59:19] him, my iniquities have taken hold upon
[59:22] me so that I'm not able to look
[59:26] up. My
[59:28] what?
[59:30] Iniquities. My
[59:32] iniquities. Yes. The sins I know I
[59:35] shouldn't have done, but I did them.
[59:38] It's made me so ashamed of myself, I can
[59:41] hardly look up to
[59:43] God. Have you ever felt that way,
[59:45] church? Have you ever felt so guilty you
[59:48] have a hard time singing at
[59:51] church? Ever felt that
[59:54] way? Ever have a a time where you feel
[59:57] so guilty you don't even feel worthy to
[59:59] open up your
[1:00:01] Bible? You ever feel so unworthy you
[1:00:04] don't even feel like God will listen to
[1:00:05] your prayer?
[1:00:07] You're not alone. David felt like
[1:00:10] that. Hallelujah. And church, we know
[1:00:13] the end of the story. God would bring
[1:00:15] him to a new season of his life. God
[1:00:18] would fulfill the promises in his life.
[1:00:22] And God is the same yesterday, today,
[1:00:25] and forever. God will bring you to a new
[1:00:27] season of your life,
[1:00:29] too. That's right. I've seen it many
[1:00:31] times in my
[1:00:32] life.
[1:00:34] His iniquities are more than the hairs
[1:00:37] of mine head. And I forgot to look it
[1:00:38] up. I looked up. I think there's like
[1:00:39] 10,000 hairs on every head. Something
[1:00:41] like
[1:00:42] that. Something along those lines.
[1:00:44] There's thousands of hairs when they if
[1:00:46] they if they can count unless you're
[1:00:48] losing them, you
[1:00:49] know. There's thousand 10,000 maybe. I
[1:00:53] think it was maybe
[1:00:54] 13,000. Therefore, my heart faileth me.
[1:00:58] So, there was times David could only see
[1:01:01] enemies. He could only see his
[1:01:05] iniquities and it got him so discouraged
[1:01:07] he could hardly he couldn't even raise
[1:01:09] his head to look up to heaven. And we
[1:01:11] can all do that today. We could all look
[1:01:13] up to heaven say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:14] You're so kind. I love you, Jesus." But
[1:01:17] there's times David couldn't even lift
[1:01:18] up his
[1:01:21] head.
[1:01:23] Amen. Did he quit? Did he give up? Did
[1:01:28] he leave the message, brother
[1:01:29] Mercy? No. He stayed with the message
[1:01:33] because he was carrying the message.
[1:01:35] Hallelujah. He was the word made
[1:01:37] manifest for his
[1:01:39] day. Ah, that's right. Hallelujah. God
[1:01:43] was living in David. Hallelujah. God's
[1:01:46] angel was protecting
[1:01:47] David. The angel Lord encamps around all
[1:01:50] those that fear the Lord. Verse 13. Be
[1:01:53] pleased, oh Lord, deliver me. Oh Lord,
[1:01:55] make haste to help me. Let them be
[1:01:56] ashamed and confounded together that
[1:01:58] seek after my soul to destroy it. Let
[1:02:00] them be driven backward and put to shame
[1:02:02] that wish me
[1:02:04] evil. Let them be desolate for a reward
[1:02:06] of their shame that say unto me, "Aha,
[1:02:09] aha." Let all those that seek thee
[1:02:12] rejoice and be glad in thee. So see
[1:02:15] this. David said there's times I can't
[1:02:17] even lift my head. But if you just keep
[1:02:19] seeking God, what is God going to do?
[1:02:21] He's going to raise your head and cause
[1:02:23] you to rejoice and say, "Praise the
[1:02:25] Lord." Amen. He's given me a new song.
[1:02:29] He's given me hope for the future. God's
[1:02:32] going to lift your head and allow you to
[1:02:34] get your joy back. He's going to restore
[1:02:36] the joy of your salvation.
[1:02:43] Let such as love thy salvation say
[1:02:46] continually, "The Lord be
[1:02:49] magnified." I want to try that someday.
[1:02:51] I want to try that. I just want to say
[1:02:52] that all day. The Lord be magnified. God
[1:02:54] bless you. The Lord be magnified. Hey,
[1:02:55] God bless you. The Lord be magnified.
[1:02:58] Oh, that's the news that happened with
[1:02:59] the president or Elon Musk. Oh, the Lord
[1:03:01] be magnified. Praise God. Oh, that
[1:03:04] happened with Russia or Ukraine. Oh, the
[1:03:06] Lord be magnified. I don't understand
[1:03:07] it. I'm just going to keep praising God.
[1:03:08] The Lord be
[1:03:10] magnified. Because that's what David
[1:03:12] said. When God has delivered me, I'll
[1:03:14] say the Lord be magnified all day.
[1:03:18] Hallelujah. Verse 17. But I am poor and
[1:03:21] needy, yet the Lord thinkketh upon me.
[1:03:24] Hallelujah. Church, you always you
[1:03:27] always got somebody thinking about you.
[1:03:29] Praise God. Amen. God is always thinking
[1:03:32] about you. Even church, even when we
[1:03:35] don't think about him,
[1:03:38] we choose to think about other things.
[1:03:40] We focus on other things. But guess
[1:03:41] what? God is always thinking about you.
[1:03:44] Amen. A I thought you'd like that. Amen.
[1:03:48] Hallelujah. He says, "I'm poor. I'm
[1:03:51] needy. And yet God is thinking about me
[1:03:54] all the time. because he's got his angel
[1:03:56] right here to protect
[1:03:59] me. Thou art my help and my deliverer.
[1:04:02] Make no tearing, oh my God. So, not only
[1:04:04] he's got an angel here, he wants God's
[1:04:07] spirit to come and help him,
[1:04:09] too. Ah, talk about a double
[1:04:14] blessing.
[1:04:19] Glory. Now, I want you to see this
[1:04:21] church here. Um, I might have to do a
[1:04:23] part two maybe Wednesday. So, I'm almost
[1:04:25] at my hour. Go to Psalm 25:7, would you?
[1:04:29] I preached this a while ago, but uh I
[1:04:31] just want to bring this out again about
[1:04:32] the life of
[1:04:45] David. Can we all read that together?
[1:04:47] Everybody's got that. Uh Psalm
[1:04:51] 25:7. Let's read that on three. One,
[1:04:54] two, three. Remember not the sins of my
[1:04:57] youth, nor my
[1:04:59] transgressions. According to thy mercy,
[1:05:01] remember thou me for thy goodness sake,
[1:05:05] oh Lord. So look, David, now let's go
[1:05:08] back here on our timeline. When David's
[1:05:10] a shepherd, what did he have, church?
[1:05:15] transgressions, sins of his
[1:05:19] youth, sins of his youth. So church, now
[1:05:23] is this is this making more sense? He
[1:05:24] had sin as a child. Even before he
[1:05:26] defeated Goliath, he had sins of his
[1:05:29] youth. And then he had sins before he's
[1:05:32] king. And then he had sins after his
[1:05:35] king. After he was king. Sound familiar?
[1:05:38] You had you sin when you were a child,
[1:05:40] right? You sin before you had the
[1:05:42] greatest testimonies in your life and
[1:05:44] you'll sin when you're later on in life,
[1:05:46] but yet God will never forsake you.
[1:05:47] Praise God.
[1:05:49] His angel will still encamp around you.
[1:05:53] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank God. Amen. That
[1:05:56] he encamps around all those that fear
[1:05:58] the Lord. Amen. Oh my. I love the story
[1:06:01] of David. Ever since that David sight
[1:06:03] and sound, this has been a it's been
[1:06:04] like a brand new book. Praise God. Just
[1:06:08] to see it in a new light.
[1:06:12] Look at verse 18 of that same chapter.
[1:06:15] 25:18. Look upon mine affliction and my
[1:06:17] pain and forgive what? All my
[1:06:21] sins. Do you think God did that? Yes,
[1:06:25] God did do that.
[1:06:28] God did
[1:06:29] that. See, church, if we just confess
[1:06:32] our sins, keep persevering, God will
[1:06:35] forgive our sins, even the sins of our
[1:06:38] youth.
[1:06:40] even the iniquities when we're a grown
[1:06:43] adult and know
[1:06:45] better.
[1:06:47] Hallelujah. Then he'll forgive even some
[1:06:50] of our most wretched of all sins. Wasn't
[1:06:53] that a wretched thing to
[1:06:55] do? Incredibly wretched. Murder,
[1:06:58] adultery, number the people,
[1:07:01] pride, wretched. But that's what exactly
[1:07:04] what Paul said. Oh wretched man that I
[1:07:07] am. Now church, you know, we believe in
[1:07:09] the New Testament, we're not going to
[1:07:10] commit these things if we're born
[1:07:12] again, right? Because the Bible said now
[1:07:14] Jesus said, "Now you have power to be a
[1:07:16] witness. Power they didn't have
[1:07:19] beforehand, right? The Holy Ghost was
[1:07:21] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[1:07:23] glorified in John chapter
[1:07:25] 7. So we have greater power now, but yet
[1:07:29] Paul, even with that greater power,
[1:07:31] says, "I'm a wretched man. I do hateful
[1:07:33] things I don't like to do."
[1:07:36] I hope you're encouraged today by God's
[1:07:38] grace. That was my goal to help you uh
[1:07:41] be encouraged. I think I'll preach a
[1:07:43] part two uh and just close up with a few
[1:07:46] more things here
[1:07:49] uh by God's grace. Yeah, I'll just
[1:07:50] probably preach a part
[1:07:53] two. Uh now, Kesha, would you put put up
[1:07:56] uh Psalm I'm sorry, put up 1st Samuel
[1:07:58] 13:14.
[1:08:04] 1st Samuel
[1:08:07] 13:14. But now thy kingdom shall not
[1:08:10] continue. The Lord hath sought him a man
[1:08:13] after his own heart, and the Lord hath
[1:08:15] commanded him to be captain over his
[1:08:17] people, because thou hast not kept that
[1:08:19] which the Lord commanded thee. So this
[1:08:22] is Samuel talking to King Saul and he
[1:08:26] says, "God's going to take the kingdom
[1:08:27] for you from you and give it to a man
[1:08:30] who's after my own heart." So see
[1:08:32] church, what's what's the main thing
[1:08:34] you're after in life? Are you after
[1:08:35] money? Are you after
[1:08:37] pleasure? Or are you after God's
[1:08:41] heart? That's ultimately what David was
[1:08:44] after. David wanted to please the heart
[1:08:47] of
[1:08:49] God. Anything that came, anything else
[1:08:52] that came around that, you know, was
[1:08:53] God's gift, God's blessing. But his main
[1:08:56] desire was God, I want to please you. I
[1:08:59] want to know your heart and I want to do
[1:09:01] your will for my life.
[1:09:04] Yet he lied to the
[1:09:06] priest. Yet he pretended to be mad when
[1:09:09] he
[1:09:10] wasn't. Right? Yet he committed
[1:09:13] adultery,
[1:09:15] murdered, numbered the people, and yet
[1:09:18] God still calls him a man after God's
[1:09:22] own heart. It's amazing to me, church.
[1:09:25] It's amazing. It's amazing grace that
[1:09:28] saved a wretched man like Paul that
[1:09:31] saved a wretched man like
[1:09:33] me. Amazing
[1:09:36] grace. First Kings 15:5. Remember this
[1:09:38] one. First Kings 15:5. I appreciate it,
[1:09:41] Case. Thank you. Saves us a little bit
[1:09:43] of few seconds
[1:09:44] here. Because David did that which was
[1:09:47] what? Right in the eyes of God. Yet with
[1:09:50] all those iniquities, God didn't
[1:09:52] remember those iniquities when he wrote
[1:09:54] this. God said he did what was
[1:09:58] right in the eyes of the Lord and turned
[1:10:01] not aside from anything. Wait, I thought
[1:10:03] he lied. I thought he was it was in
[1:10:04] polygamy. He did, but God didn't God
[1:10:06] forgave him of
[1:10:09] that. Those must have been minor things,
[1:10:11] church, because look at
[1:10:13] this. The Bible records the only major
[1:10:17] sin he committed was in the matter of
[1:10:19] Uriah the Hittite.
[1:10:22] So in God's
[1:10:23] eyesight, everything else was minor
[1:10:26] except that adultery and murder, even
[1:10:29] numbering the people, even lying to the
[1:10:32] preacher. Think of that. Lying to the
[1:10:35] preacher, that was all
[1:10:38] minor. God could easily, more easily
[1:10:41] forgive that. But the that one thing
[1:10:43] that was very sinful was adultery and
[1:10:47] murder. And yet he's still a man after
[1:10:50] God's own heart. So church, what am I
[1:10:52] saying? Don't let the devil try to
[1:10:54] convince you to live in
[1:10:56] guilt. Don't let the devil to try to
[1:10:59] convince you to be condemned. There's no
[1:11:02] condemnation to David.
[1:11:05] There's no condemnation to them that are
[1:11:07] in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. Who
[1:11:10] walk after the spirit and not the
[1:11:15] flesh. Last verse, Romans 4.
[1:11:19] I just had to end with this one here.
[1:11:25] Hallelujah. Romans chapter 4. What
[1:11:28] chapter did brother Brandham say he
[1:11:30] would always go to when he felt blue or
[1:11:34] depressed? He said Romans chapter
[1:11:41] 4. There's my hour. This is my last
[1:11:45] verse. By God's grace, we'll pick up
[1:11:47] maybe a part two on Wednesday night.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. How many enjoy the life of
[1:11:50] David? I got there's so much more as far
[1:11:53] as examples from David's life. I trust
[1:11:56] you're encouraged today. I trust you
[1:11:58] will
[1:11:59] persevere because God's angel camps
[1:12:02] around you and God will deliver you from
[1:12:05] all your troubles.
[1:12:08] Call upon the
[1:12:11] Lord. Romans 4. All
[1:12:20] right, I'm in chapter three. Sorry. Yep.
[1:12:21] I was wondering on the right
[1:12:26] page. Verse one. What shall we say then?
[1:12:29] That Abraham our father as pertains to
[1:12:31] the flesh hath found. For if Abraham
[1:12:33] were justified by works, he hath
[1:12:35] wherefore to glory, but not before God.
[1:12:37] In other words, all your efforts are not
[1:12:40] going to get you to
[1:12:41] heaven. Anything that you do good is not
[1:12:45] good enough.
[1:12:47] You're not justified or declared
[1:12:48] righteous by your works. It's through
[1:12:50] the blood of Jesus
[1:12:53] Christ. What saith the scripture,
[1:12:56] Abraham believed God, and it was
[1:12:58] accounted unto him for righteousness?
[1:13:00] How many will believe God today that God
[1:13:02] forgives all your sins? Amen. Like
[1:13:04] David. Amen. He forgave me all my
[1:13:07] sins. That's what you got to believe,
[1:13:11] brother Nia. I just believe
[1:13:13] it. I just believe it, brother Jose.
[1:13:16] Despite all my sins and my failures and
[1:13:18] my shortcomings, the wretched man that I
[1:13:20] am, I've either got two choices. Doubt
[1:13:22] God or believe I'm going to believe God.
[1:13:24] Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] Because if God could save David, God can
[1:13:28] save me, too. Hallelujah.
[1:13:31] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Glory.
[1:13:35] Now, to him that workketh is a reward
[1:13:37] not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
[1:13:39] trying to be good enough, trying to uh
[1:13:42] save your own self, you can't do
[1:13:44] it. But to him that workketh not, but
[1:13:47] believeth on him that justifith the
[1:13:49] ungodly, his faith is counted for
[1:13:53] righteousness. Even as who? Our good old
[1:13:57] friend David. I tell you, brother said,
[1:14:00] one day I'm going to walk up to Uriah
[1:14:01] the Hitittite. Can I just shake your
[1:14:03] hand, brother? And he's going to say,
[1:14:04] "Thank you for living your life. Your
[1:14:07] testimony meant something to me on this
[1:14:09] earth. That's what brother's gonna say
[1:14:11] to Uriah. Love you, buddy.
[1:14:15] Patrick, but you know what? I I I'll
[1:14:18] probably do that, but I'm going to walk
[1:14:19] up to David. So, Patrick's going to be
[1:14:21] David. I'm gonna say, "David, your
[1:14:23] testimony meant something to me on this
[1:14:25] earth. When I when I saw that you
[1:14:28] committed all these iniquities and yet
[1:14:29] you had faith in God that God was going
[1:14:31] to forgive all your iniquities, that
[1:14:33] meant something to me." When you said
[1:14:35] the angel of the Lord camps around you
[1:14:37] even when you make a fool of
[1:14:39] yourself, that meant something to me,
[1:14:42] David. And it helped me on my earthly
[1:14:44] journey in
[1:14:46] 2025. That helped me. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:52] It mean it's going to mean something to
[1:14:53] me to walk up to David said, "Thank you
[1:14:55] for being led by the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:58] writing those precious
[1:15:01] words." That reminds me, God forgives
[1:15:05] all my
[1:15:08] iniquities. David, thank you, David.
[1:15:10] I'll say like you, David. Thank you for
[1:15:12] describing the blessedness of a man
[1:15:14] who's
[1:15:17] forgiven. What is that blessedness,
[1:15:19] church?
[1:15:20] It's the blessedness unto whom God
[1:15:23] imputeth righteousness without
[1:15:27] works. Saying verse seven, blessed are
[1:15:31] they whose iniquities are
[1:15:34] forgiven. Hallelujah. God will look past
[1:15:37] and say, I forgive you, David, of your
[1:15:40] murder. I forgive you of your adultery.
[1:15:43] I forgive you of pridefully exalting
[1:15:45] yourself. I'm going to forgive you of
[1:15:47] that. Blessed is that man whom God
[1:15:52] forgives all of his
[1:15:56] iniquities and whose sins are covered.
[1:15:59] Blessed is the man whom the Lord will
[1:16:02] not impute
[1:16:06] sin. What a beautiful story this is of
[1:16:11] David. Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] Then brother Brandon will go down and
[1:16:18] read verse
[1:16:21] 18. Well, just we'll just go to verse
[1:16:23] 20. Let's
[1:16:24] stand. Verse 20. He staggered not at the
[1:16:27] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[1:16:30] strong in faith, giving glory to God.
[1:16:33] Musicians can come. But Ram said, "This
[1:16:36] is where I go when I'm feeling
[1:16:39] depressed.
[1:16:42] I go to this book where it says,
[1:16:43] "Abraham wasn't perfect. David wasn't
[1:16:46] perfect, but they served a perfect God."
[1:16:50] Thank you,
[1:16:52] Jesus. Just play that. Created in me a
[1:16:54] clean heart, oh
[1:17:05] God. Church, this just struck me this
[1:17:07] week as I was studying the life of
[1:17:09] David.
[1:17:10] His testimony is going to mean something
[1:17:13] to me when I get to heaven. I want to go
[1:17:14] right up to David when I get a chance. I
[1:17:16] want to spend 10,000 years at the feet
[1:17:18] of Jesus. As brother
[1:17:20] said, let me spend 10,000 years at my
[1:17:24] savior's feet, kissing those feet that
[1:17:27] have nail scars in
[1:17:30] them. Let me spend 10,000 there crying,
[1:17:33] praising
[1:17:35] God. But then I'll probably get up,
[1:17:37] Brother Jose. I'll go thank brother
[1:17:38] Brandon. I'll spend a while thinking
[1:17:42] brother then I say can I talk to King
[1:17:45] David where's that prophet can I talk to
[1:17:48] and it'll be a long line Jose and I'll
[1:17:50] just get to wait and watch
[1:17:53] everybody pretty soon it'll be my
[1:17:55] turn say thank you David I just want to
[1:17:58] tell you that when I was on earth as a
[1:18:00] Holy Ghostfilled Christian your
[1:18:02] testimony meant something to
[1:18:04] me you admitted your your your sins you
[1:18:08] confessed your sins
[1:18:13] And yet you recognize how God was rich
[1:18:15] in
[1:18:16] mercy. He would forgive you so
[1:18:20] freely. You taught me just to confess my
[1:18:23] sins, move on, persevere, fight the good
[1:18:27] fight of
[1:18:28] faith, and the angel of the Lord would
[1:18:32] be encamped around me because I fear
[1:18:35] God. How many fear God today?
[1:18:39] Let's
[1:18:41] pray. Friends, I hope you're encouraged
[1:18:43] today. David's life thoroughly
[1:18:46] encourages me
[1:18:49] today. It lets me know that I can still
[1:18:52] be a man after God's own heart, even
[1:18:54] when I fall
[1:18:57] short. David fought awful battles
[1:18:59] against Goliath and the Philistines, but
[1:19:02] he also fought against
[1:19:04] David, his battle of iniquity.
[1:19:08] And Lord, we know what that's like. Lord
[1:19:10] God, we're fighting the greatest battle
[1:19:13] ever fought. Our greatest enemy is
[1:19:16] ourselves. Lord, I hope the people can
[1:19:18] see it now more clearly, Lord God.
[1:19:25] that we have a heavenly protection, that
[1:19:28] we have a heavenly high priest who will
[1:19:30] freely forgive our
[1:19:31] sins and protect us and guide us into
[1:19:35] all
[1:19:38] truth. Lord, none of us are worthy today
[1:19:40] of heaven, Lord, as we saw here in
[1:19:43] Romans 4. Dear God, we thank you for
[1:19:45] today. Lord, we want to offer this
[1:19:47] prayer. Thank you, Lord, for putting a
[1:19:49] man like this in the scripture. Lord
[1:19:50] God, he's called a man after God's own
[1:19:53] heart. He's called a man that did what
[1:19:55] was right. He just missed one thing. But
[1:19:57] yet, Lord, we can see he sinned in his
[1:19:59] youth. He sinned as a a young man. He
[1:20:01] sinned as an old man. Awful
[1:20:04] sins. And yet, he was blessed because
[1:20:06] you would not impute sin unto him. Oh
[1:20:09] God, thank you for this man. Lord
[1:20:14] God, no wonder I always love the life of
[1:20:16] David. Lord
[1:20:18] God, always wanted to have a David of my
[1:20:21] own.
[1:20:24] Maybe I thank you for a man like this,
[1:20:27] Lord, who can cry out to you when he's
[1:20:31] afraid. You'll protect him by your
[1:20:34] angel, and then you'll give him a new
[1:20:37] song after showing him mercy after
[1:20:41] mercy after mercy.
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:48] Hallelujah Jesus. Hallelujah. Blessed is
[1:20:51] that man, Lord God, whom the Lord will
[1:20:54] not imbue iniquities, Lord God.
[1:20:56] Hallelujah. Praise God. Lord, may we
[1:21:00] leave here with assurance, with a
[1:21:02] blessed assurance that you've forgiven
[1:21:04] our sins,
[1:21:08] God. This is amazing grace that we live
[1:21:11] in.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. Lord God, you brought us out
[1:21:17] of the merry clay, Lord God. You placed
[1:21:19] our feet on the rock to stay, Lord God.
[1:21:23] Hallelujah. You're the God who delivers
[1:21:25] the righteous out of every affliction.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah. You delivered us from all of
[1:21:30] our troubles, Lord God. We want to say
[1:21:32] thank you
[1:21:34] today. And Lord, forgive us of our sins
[1:21:36] today, our iniquities, especially, Lord
[1:21:38] God. The wickedness we do, that we hate
[1:21:41] that we do.
[1:21:42] Create in us a clean heart today, Lord
[1:21:45] God. Give us a new song, Lord
[1:21:49] God. Let us go about, Lord, testifying,
[1:21:52] "The Lord be magnified. The Lord is
[1:21:55] good. God is so gracious to me." Give us
[1:21:59] a song, Lord, in our
[1:22:01] hearts. Give us a praise in our tongue
[1:22:04] like David. We thank you, God, for this
[1:22:07] day. bless your word now in the hearts
[1:22:10] of your people in Jesus Christ's name.
