[0:00] The reality is his wife has made herself
[0:02] ready. Hallelujah. So, it's a great
[0:05] promise. Hallelujah. His wife has made
[0:07] herself ready. We just want to be made
[0:09] ready by the grace of God. 1 Corinthians
[0:11] 15. Let's go to verse 12. Trust you've
[0:13] been enjoying this series. I'm trying to
[0:15] finish it up here. I've been focusing
[0:16] mainly on this uh to get this uh book
[0:20] done. It's been a great book.
[0:22] I think it's tied in perfectly uh with
[0:25] what our church has gone through the
[0:26] last couple years here by God's grace
[0:29] and a lot of great lessons from here as
[0:31] well by the grace of God.
[0:35] I forgot to pray for brother Greg. So
[0:37] we'll read our verse and we'll pray for
[0:38] him. That's the one thing I forgot while
[0:40] I was singing. I was like that's right.
[0:41] I forgot brother Greg. So and I invited
[0:43] him back to church. So thanks. Keep
[0:45] inviting him brother Chris. That was
[0:46] really good you invited him. It's so
[0:47] nice to see visitors by God's grace.
[0:50] Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Amen.
[0:58] Amen. So, we got through verses 1- 11 on
[1:01] Sunday, and I will read, we'll try to
[1:04] get uh if we can from 12 to 34 tonight
[1:08] if that's possible. Kind of see how that
[1:11] goes. Like I said, I'll try to preach a
[1:12] little shorter here. I think somebody's
[1:14] got to get up at 4:45 tomorrow. So, I
[1:17] just want to be mindful of that.
[1:19] Thoughtful of that. verse 12. If you're
[1:21] there, say amen.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:12. We'll just read
[1:25] that one verse here and then we'll have
[1:26] a word of prayer uh for brother Greg. I
[1:29] asked him right at the table. I said,
[1:31] "Brother Greg, are you saved?" He said,
[1:32] "Yes, sir, I'm saved." So, I trust he is
[1:35] saved. Hallelujah. That was a good
[1:36] answer. Of course, God knows all hearts
[1:39] and but if he's really saved and wants
[1:42] to get right with God, we'd be a great
[1:44] church to come to. Hallelujah. Uh but
[1:46] any other Bible believing church, you
[1:48] know, we just want to see people serving
[1:49] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:52] Verse 12. Let's read that on three.
[1:53] Ready? One, two, three. Now if Christ be
[1:56] preached that he rose from the dead, how
[2:00] say some of you that there is no
[2:03] resurrection of the dead. Amen. Let's
[2:06] have a word of prayer. If you have a
[2:07] need on your heart, let's make an order
[2:08] to God. We also pray for brother Greg.
[2:11] God, we thank you again for today. Thank
[2:12] you for the songs of Zion. It just lifts
[2:14] our spirits, Lord. It's so wonderful to
[2:16] hear the saints shout out, sing out,
[2:18] praise your holy name, Lord God. And I
[2:20] imagine, Lord, we'll be doing this all
[2:22] throughout eternity. So Lord, it never
[2:24] gets old. As brother Random said, I
[2:25] never get my fill of singing. As
[2:28] Ephesians chapter 4 says, be filled with
[2:30] the spirit, singing unto each other in
[2:32] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[2:34] Lord God, it's such a blessing to sing
[2:36] and worship, Lord. That's one of our
[2:38] attributes as priests unto God, giving
[2:41] the sacrifice of praise with our lips,
[2:43] Lord God. So, we're grateful for this
[2:45] opportunity. Bless all the saints. They
[2:47] made a a great effort to be here. Seems
[2:49] like a lot more people here tonight.
[2:51] It's a good feeling, Lord. And we're
[2:52] grateful for all the sacrifices, Lord,
[2:54] that have been made to be in your house
[2:56] here tonight. So, God, minister to your
[2:58] people by the Holy Spirit. I can help no
[3:00] one. It takes the only real preacher,
[3:01] the Lord Jesus Christ. So, Lord Jesus,
[3:03] just use me. Use the word, Lord, and use
[3:06] uh the prayers at the end, Lord, to
[3:08] magnify your holy name, Jesus, and meet
[3:10] the needs of your people. Remember our
[3:12] dear brother Greg. Lord, it was nice to
[3:14] meet him and he had some good knowledge
[3:16] of the word, Lord. Said he was raised in
[3:18] church, but Father, he's going through
[3:19] difficult times, Lord. And maybe that's
[3:21] why, Lord, that he came because he's
[3:23] going through difficult times to drive
[3:25] him to church. But remember him, Lord,
[3:27] his in his mind, in his body, wherever
[3:28] the needs are, maybe relationships. Lord
[3:31] God, I know he said he and his wife
[3:33] would like to have children. So, Father,
[3:34] you know all things, dear God. Lord,
[3:38] minister to our dear friend and Lord,
[3:40] uh, this new friend I'd say we have,
[3:42] Lord, and help us, Lord God, to
[3:43] encourage him to come back, Lord God.
[3:45] Bless Brother Chris for being a witness,
[3:47] inviting him to church, Lord God. That's
[3:48] a real good sign, Lord, that you're
[3:51] working in more and more in Brother
[3:53] Chris's life. So, we thank you for that,
[3:54] Lord God. And bless our brother again on
[3:56] his birthday. Father, take this word
[3:57] that we've read, break it to our hearts
[3:59] now. We pray that we could understand,
[4:00] as the Bible said, to grow in grace and
[4:02] the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:04] And let's remember every word in your
[4:06] Bible is thus sayith the Lord. May our
[4:08] hearts receive thus sayith the word of
[4:10] God tonight in Jesus Christ's name. And
[4:12] the saints said,
[4:14] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[4:15] seated. Praise the Lord.
[4:18] Look forward to this weekend. You know,
[4:19] we got brother Cam coming. So I look
[4:21] forward to that. Two services there on
[4:23] Sunday. So that'll be a wonderful time
[4:26] in the Lord. It's been a while since
[4:27] we've seen our brother. I just remember
[4:29] the last time he came. You know, Austin
[4:31] was so blessed by the word. He's like,
[4:34] "That meant so much to me." And so I was
[4:36] really grateful for that. And we've had
[4:38] so many wonderful testimonies uh with
[4:41] brother Cam down through the years, you
[4:42] know. Um last time I was there, I shared
[4:45] it with some of the I shared it with his
[4:47] home churches how Cam and Simon have
[4:49] been such a blessing to us and God has
[4:51] done a lot of wonderful things. Uh
[4:53] answered prayers and so forth. So uh
[4:55] let's just be ready to pull on the word
[4:57] of God on Sunday, right? Just like you
[4:58] do when I preach. You're such a great
[5:00] audience. Everybody listens and pays
[5:02] attention and I appreciate that. If you
[5:04] put up with me, you'll do a great job
[5:05] with anybody else. Hallelujah.
[5:08] Amen. So, we got through verses 1
[5:10] through 11. And here tonight, we'll try
[5:11] to get from 12 to 34. This amazing
[5:14] chapter right here, this is just a
[5:15] powerful uh Holy Ghost anointed chapter.
[5:19] There's so many great truths in here. I
[5:21] was reading down through uh some
[5:23] commentaries and the first 11 verses we
[5:25] preached on that was used by you know
[5:27] Calvin uh Martin Luther uh many of the
[5:30] reformers down through the years just
[5:32] use those first 11 verses to kind of
[5:35] ground the people in the faith right
[5:37] because now we know how Paul started the
[5:39] church we know what he preached
[5:41] &gt;&gt; he preached Jesus Christ died for our
[5:44] sins was buried and then he raised
[5:47] according to the scripture
[5:49] &gt;&gt; that's how he started part of the
[5:51] church. Hallelujah. And if we're
[5:53] expecting something more than that,
[5:54] well, then we've got another thing
[5:56] coming. Hallelujah. We're not getting to
[5:57] heaven except through the blood of Jesus
[5:59] Christ.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; And all the additional revelations, yes,
[6:02] that's part of it. But the foundation is
[6:04] faith in Jesus Christ.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, just neat, neat, and
[6:08] wonderful to see that. Refreshing to to
[6:10] see that by God's grace. And today,
[6:12] we'll look at the resurrection of the
[6:13] dead. I think it was Claude had a
[6:15] question about this uh text a few months
[6:17] ago. So, I think I I touched it a few
[6:19] months ago, but we'll get through here
[6:21] by God's grace. Now, we looked at Paul
[6:24] has at least three purposes for writing
[6:26] this chapter to promote faithfulness
[6:28] because Paul realized people can fall
[6:30] away from faith.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Just like the Bible said, Jesus said,
[6:33] "You can have that seed there on your
[6:34] ground, but then Satan can come and
[6:36] snatch it away." Well, at one point they
[6:38] had it, right? They received it at one
[6:39] point, but they didn't stand in it. And
[6:42] Paul said, "There's three steps. You got
[6:44] to receive it, stand in it, and then you
[6:46] have to remember it. Hallelujah. Keep it
[6:49] in memory. That was in verse three.
[6:50] Hallelujah. So he said he's promoting
[6:53] faithfulness through remembering the
[6:55] word of God. How many love when you
[6:57] remember something that you've
[6:58] forgotten? Right? Don't you love that?
[6:59] Oh, I remember that. That was so
[7:00] beautiful. How could I forget that?
[7:02] Well, you could forget because so many
[7:04] days and nights happened to you. Amen.
[7:06] Month after month, year after year,
[7:07] trial after trial. That's why you
[7:09] forget. But God's Holy Spirit will bring
[7:11] all things to remembrance at the time
[7:13] you need it.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second, he said he wanted to
[7:16] assure the believers of their future
[7:18] bodily resurrection. As we'll look at
[7:19] here tonight, he said, "How can some of
[7:21] you say that? That there's no
[7:22] resurrection from the dead." Think about
[7:24] that. A church filled with tongues,
[7:25] interpretation, prophecy. Everybody had
[7:28] a gift. And yet some of them didn't even
[7:29] believe in a resurrection. That's quite
[7:32] a paradox to understand that you don't
[7:34] believe in a resurrection. You just
[7:36] believe in there's only power now.
[7:37] There's no power after death. But see,
[7:40] they sure believed in the power in the
[7:41] church, right? They sure believed in all
[7:43] the operation of the gifts, but some of
[7:44] them did not believe there was power
[7:46] after death.
[7:49] And then third, his third reason was
[7:51] explaining how the dead are raised and
[7:53] which bodies they possess. So this is an
[7:56] this is a wonderful chapter. This
[7:58] chapter tells more about the
[7:59] resurrection than the rest of the entire
[8:01] Bible.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, how did Paul know this? He
[8:04] met Jesus in the deserts of Arabia.
[8:07] Right? For three years, three and a half
[8:08] years, he was there and he received the
[8:10] revelation from the Lord Jesus. And then
[8:12] when the questions came up, he could
[8:14] address each and every one, write with
[8:15] thus sayeth the Lord, writing scripture
[8:17] to them. Imagine the Bible said it was
[8:19] God breathed. When Paul was writing that
[8:22] or had some other man write it for him,
[8:23] it was as if God was breathing the
[8:25] thoughts onto the paper. And we get to
[8:27] read it tonight.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[8:33] So, as I said, we'll try to uh preach 30
[8:35] minutes here now. Let's see if that's
[8:36] possible. by God's grace. Hallelujah. I
[8:39] think I've done it before. Haven't I
[8:40] done 30 minutes before? Okay. Yeah. Case
[8:41] is a witness. All right. So, it's
[8:42] possible. I thought it was possible,
[8:44] too. Now, if Christ be preached that he
[8:47] rose from the dead, how say some of you
[8:49] that there is no resurrection of the of
[8:51] the dead? So, Paul's starting a new
[8:53] paragraph here. That's what that uh Bill
[8:56] Crow, is that what that was called? I
[8:57] forget the name of it already. It was in
[8:58] my notes earlier. Certain paragraph
[9:00] symbol there. So Paul says, "How can
[9:02] some of you deny our resurrection if you
[9:05] believe preachers claiming Jesus is
[9:08] resurrected?"
[9:09] How can Jesus raise but not his
[9:11] followers?
[9:13] &gt;&gt; So some people would recognize, "Well,
[9:14] Jesus rose. That's what they're
[9:15] preaching." But then some of them would
[9:17] say, "Well, we're not going to raise.
[9:18] Just Jesus is going to raise."
[9:21] &gt;&gt; So Paul says, "How is this possible?" Um
[9:24] he says, "But if there's no resurrection
[9:25] of the dead, then is Christ not risen?"
[9:29] So he he goes right away to the general
[9:31] resurrection. If there's no general
[9:32] resurrection, then Jesus didn't raise
[9:35] &gt;&gt; because he knows what he's going to
[9:36] introduce later about the first fruits.
[9:38] And if Christ be not risen, then is our
[9:41] preaching vain and your faith is also
[9:45] vain? Now if you study the history, you
[9:48] know, uh Corinth was near, of course,
[9:50] Athens and a lot of the wisdom and
[9:52] philosophy came out of the Greeks,
[9:54] right? Now the Greeks, a lot of the
[9:56] philosophers of the Greek uh philosophy
[9:59] uh they believed the body was an
[10:01] absolute curse basically and to die was
[10:04] actually being set free. Now there is
[10:06] some truth to that and the church said I
[10:09] do agree there's some truth in that
[10:11] right brother Ram calls it a pest house
[10:13] right you now we want to keep this as
[10:15] healthy as we can right we want to we
[10:17] want to stay away from sickness as much
[10:18] as we can but what what we're saying is
[10:22] we just we despise the sin nature it's
[10:24] like why do I have to be trapped in the
[10:25] sin nature all the time why can't I just
[10:27] get a break from this sin nature right
[10:30] but now the Greeks of course without
[10:31] faith in Jesus they took that thought
[10:33] and took it too far and they just
[10:35] believe when you die you're finally set
[10:37] free and then you don't have to worry
[10:38] about it anymore and of course they
[10:40] might have believed in different things
[10:40] after life but of course they didn't
[10:42] believe in Christ but that thought had
[10:44] spread over into Corinth because
[10:46] remember it's a religious it was a
[10:47] religious city very religious and
[10:48] wealthy as well and so they had trade
[10:51] between all these great cities so it had
[10:53] spilled over into the church but God
[10:55] sent a prophet to clear up their ideas
[10:57] &gt;&gt; just like God sent a prophet named
[10:59] William Brham to clear up our ideas
[11:00] amend
[11:02] always sends a prophet as we did our
[11:03] Bible study a couple Sunday nights ago,
[11:05] right? When there was a flood, what did
[11:07] God do? Sent a prophet.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh when God wanted to do
[11:11] anything, what did he do? When he wanted
[11:12] to give two tables of stone, what did he
[11:14] do? He sent a prophet.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he wanted when he
[11:17] wanted to send his son Jesus Christ,
[11:18] what he do? He sent a forerunner named
[11:20] John the Baptist. He sent a prophet.
[11:22] Hallelujah.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; And before he finishes the gentile
[11:24] dispensation, what does he do? He sends
[11:26] Elijah. Hallelujah.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; A man with the spirit of Elijah. That's
[11:29] right.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Now, so he lists three three powerful
[11:32] statements here. Yay. If that's true, if
[11:35] there is no resurrection, we are false
[11:37] witnesses. Now, the Bible said the
[11:40] spirit bears witness that our spirit
[11:42] that we are the sons of God. Now, Paul's
[11:44] the one that wrote that to the Romans,
[11:46] right? But he's saying here, if there's
[11:48] no resurrection, then none of you are
[11:50] witnesses.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; You cannot have a witness of Christ
[11:53] unless there is a resurrection.
[11:57] Because we have testified of God that he
[11:59] raised up Christ whom he raised not up.
[12:01] If so be that the dead rise not.
[12:04] Hallelujah. So if nobody's rising, then
[12:06] Jesus didn't rise.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; So here we just in summary, look at
[12:10] this. Paul's making a statement here. If
[12:12] there's no general resurrection of
[12:14] everybody, then Christ is not raised.
[12:17] Our preaching is useless. Our faith is
[12:20] vain or empty. And we are liars.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; All of us are liars. That's right.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ did not raise from the
[12:28] dead and there's no general
[12:29] resurrection.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; So the resurrection is foundational for
[12:33] Christianity.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Without the resurrection, we don't have
[12:36] anything.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[12:38] &gt;&gt; that's why brother Ram said over and
[12:40] over the greatest of all days was
[12:43] Easter.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Now we we don't like to use that word.
[12:46] So resurrection day.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; All right. If that word stumbles you,
[12:50] forgive me. You know, I don't use that
[12:52] word a lot.
[12:53] What we want to say is resurrection day,
[12:55] brother Chris.
[12:59] Well, Easter was the word that the
[13:01] pagans used for their celebration right
[13:03] around that time, right? So, the Bible
[13:05] mentions the word Easter, but it's
[13:06] actually identifying that pagan
[13:09] celebration. And so then people over the
[13:11] years have just well, we'll just call it
[13:12] Easter. But I over the years I've I've
[13:14] gone against that. I call it
[13:15] resurrection Sunday because I don't want
[13:17] to be attached to pagan things. But
[13:19] anyone that knows me knows my heart. I'm
[13:20] not trying to live a pagan life. I'm
[13:22] trying to live a Holy Ghost fil life.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; So if I use the word Easter, forgive me.
[13:26] I don't mean to. It's resurrection day.
[13:27] Hallelujah.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Or we could call it first fruits day. We
[13:31] could do that. If you really want to get
[13:32] real Hebrewaic or real real Hebrew and
[13:35] get back to that, we'll call it first
[13:36] fruits day. Hallelujah. So without the
[13:39] resurrection, church, we have absolutely
[13:41] no hope of coming here tonight. Right?
[13:44] &gt;&gt; If there's no resurrection, we could
[13:46] take our Bibles and it' be sacrilegious
[13:48] to do this, but burn them or throw them
[13:49] in the trash or throw them. If there's
[13:51] no resurrection, then there's no use of
[13:53] anything that we're doing here tonight.
[13:55] But if there is a resurrection,
[13:58] &gt;&gt; amen, then everything we do has an
[14:00] eternal blessing attached to it. Praise
[14:02] God. Amen. That's what Paul, that's the
[14:05] point Paul's trying to make. Now, think
[14:06] about this, church. On top of all the
[14:08] other sins, then Paul had to deal with
[14:10] this. on top of suing people, sexual
[14:12] immorality, divisions about the favorite
[14:14] preachers, rich people, pe people
[14:16] getting drunk, women preachers, people
[14:18] not Christians not being generous. ON
[14:21] TOP OF ALL THAT, NOW WE got half the
[14:23] church saying there's no resurrection.
[14:26] Talk about a church with problems. And
[14:29] as I said, church, we don't have any of
[14:30] these problems. So, thank you, church.
[14:33] Let me just thank you as a pastor. Can I
[14:36] just thank everybody for not taking on
[14:37] evil spirits?
[14:39] Thank you. Because who would have to
[14:41] deal with that? Likely me, right?
[14:43] Because if there's a problem, go talk to
[14:44] the pastor. It's not, well, there's a
[14:45] problem, go talk to a brother, sister,
[14:48] which is okay. I understand that. That's
[14:50] what I signed up for. Hallelujah. But I
[14:52] just thank you for keeping the Holy
[14:54] Spirit in your life and not getting
[14:56] doctrines of devils.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's my thanks to you. And
[15:01] we're in the season of Thanksgiving.
[15:02] Hallelujah.
[15:04] Now, if you ever heard of this man, now
[15:05] he's not a message believer, but he's a
[15:07] good apologist named Wes Huff. He uses
[15:10] the historical apologetic argument for
[15:12] the resurrection of Jesus. And his case
[15:15] for the strength of the resurrection is
[15:17] really powerful. First, you have the
[15:19] empty tomb. That's a historical fact.
[15:22] You have eyewitness claims over 500 at
[15:24] once. The Bible said we we went through
[15:26] them on Sunday because that's in chapter
[15:28] 15 as well. The credible death by
[15:30] crucifixion. So all the historians
[15:33] record that Jesus died by crucifixion,
[15:35] right? And then I'll even add in uh oh
[15:37] yeah next the rapid early growth of
[15:39] Christianity
[15:41] and it's powerful because all these men
[15:43] ran away from Jesus and then after that
[15:46] they all died for Jesus. And don't
[15:49] forget this is totally different than
[15:50] the Muslim religion. They when they die
[15:52] they kill people. But when Christians
[15:54] die they're the only ones that die.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Totally different. It shows
[16:00] it's a totally different spirit. Praise
[16:01] God. It's the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; And then third, you have such powerful
[16:08] early documentation. I'm just going to
[16:10] give a few uh because I've heard these
[16:12] videos over the years. I like listening
[16:13] to them because I like seeing how how
[16:16] strong Christianity is, just the
[16:17] historical fact of it, right? Uh there's
[16:21] more historical evidence for Jesus
[16:22] resurrection than any other event in the
[16:25] history of mankind.
[16:27] We have over 25,000 copies of the 27 New
[16:30] Testament books. 27,000.
[16:33] Now, because all the copies of copies
[16:35] over the years, they've just compiled
[16:37] up. In other words, of all the
[16:39] historical documents, which one did
[16:41] people want to copy the most over the
[16:42] years? The Bible.
[16:44] So, it proves the Bible's way more
[16:46] important than any other document or
[16:49] historical resource. And then we have
[16:51] over 17,000 for the Old Testament. Now
[16:55] these are super important too because
[16:57] all the prophecies of Jesus's
[16:59] resurrection
[17:01] that's one thing that separates the
[17:02] Bible from any other book. No other book
[17:04] has such accuracy accuracy 100% accuracy
[17:08] on prophetic events. No other book can
[17:09] even come close to it. Praise God.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why the Old Testament
[17:14] documents are so important.
[17:18] So these copies that we have these over
[17:20] 30 looks like I'm sorry 42 42,000 copies
[17:23] they have the highest textual accuracy
[17:25] of any documents ever kept in other
[17:28] words whoever copied them gave their
[17:30] life and put every effort into it to
[17:32] make sure it was the right copy
[17:35] because remember people were dying to
[17:36] make copies of the Bible right many men
[17:39] and women have died mostly men but many
[17:41] men men copying Bibles have died to try
[17:43] to produce one copy I heard this week
[17:46] that in the old days before the
[17:47] Gutenberg impressed. It took 10 months
[17:49] to copy one Bible.
[17:51] 10 months.
[17:54] Think about all the effort that would go
[17:55] into copy every single word for 10
[17:58] months.
[18:00] And church. And then we have a hard time
[18:01] reading it. Hallelujah.
[18:04] When we go through trials, if we're not
[18:06] devoted, if we backslide, right? We must
[18:09] remember all the sacrifices that went
[18:11] into this. God God protected this. The
[18:14] Bible said he did it for every
[18:16] generation.
[18:17] So, it's here for you. It's here for
[18:20] your children. It's here for your
[18:21] family. Let's access it. Hallelujah.
[18:24] Let's live by it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[18:26] Also, the copies are the closest copies
[18:29] to the originals of any documents on
[18:32] earth. And we have solid confidence we
[18:35] have what the early Christians wrote.
[18:37] Hallelujah.
[18:40] Now we can have more confidence uh in
[18:42] the ineresy of scripture than any other
[18:45] historical events and other books such
[18:47] as some of these you've heard. They have
[18:48] uh historians have uh documents from a
[18:52] long time ago. But the the New Testament
[18:55] Old Testament documents we have many
[18:58] more of those in comparison to any other
[19:00] historical document.
[19:02] Homer's Iliad, which was a poem written
[19:05] about the Trojan War. It's written about
[19:06] 500 years after the Trojan War. They
[19:09] have copies of that, right? And they're
[19:10] historically accurate supposedly, but
[19:13] the Bible has way more. Hallelujah.
[19:16] Julius Caesar's assassination around 44
[19:19] BC. They have copies of that, right?
[19:21] They they've they have record of that,
[19:23] but it pales in comparison to Jesus
[19:25] Christ's martyrdom and resurrection.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Then you have Alexander the Great, who
[19:30] was not great. There's only one great
[19:32] one.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; But even his uh his death was around 336
[19:38] BC. Remember he was the third step in
[19:41] Daniel's vision. Remember you have
[19:43] Babylon, messes the Persians, ancient
[19:45] Grecians,
[19:46] right? So he was the brass on that image
[19:48] of the man. And then Rome was the iron
[19:51] and the clay was Romanism and
[19:53] Protestantism. And the church said, well
[19:56] Ram said that was thus sayith the Lord.
[19:57] He said Romanism will rule at the end
[19:59] time, not communism. He said that's thus
[20:01] sayith the Lord because of Daniel
[20:02] chapter 2. Hallelujah. But we have
[20:05] writings about him. We have historical
[20:07] records of him. But we still have way
[20:10] more records of Jesus Christ. And then
[20:13] Socrates, this famous philosopher from
[20:16] he died around 399 BC. We have some of
[20:18] his writings, but none none of that
[20:21] worldly wisdom compares to the wisdom of
[20:23] the Holy Ghost that we have today.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just thought I'd lay that in
[20:27] there because I like stuff like that.
[20:29] Amen. I like to know where I stand.
[20:30] Hallelujah.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. For if the dead rise not, then
[20:36] is not Christ raised? So if all of us
[20:40] don't get raised, then Jesus wasn't
[20:41] raised.
[20:43] If Christ be not raised, your faith is
[20:46] vain. And listen, you're yet in your
[20:49] sins.
[20:51] So the resurrection was absolutely
[20:53] crucial for forgiveness of sins. Why?
[20:56] because it proved death was defeated.
[20:59] Amen. The wage of sin is what?
[21:02] &gt;&gt; The w So your payment, your paycheck for
[21:05] all your sins was death. But death was
[21:07] defeated. So that means your payment has
[21:10] already been paid for. Hallelujah.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Your sin debt has already been paid for.
[21:14] It's called a ransom. Jesus paid your
[21:16] ransom. Now you don't have to be uh you
[21:18] don't have to be killed. You don't have
[21:19] to be tortured for your sins. Jesus
[21:21] already took that curse upon him.
[21:23] Hallelujah. And the price is paid for.
[21:25] And now you've got hope because Jesus
[21:27] Christ took the punishment for your
[21:29] sins. Hallelujah.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll say it like this, church.
[21:32] Look at me. You're not in your sins.
[21:34] You're forgiven.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Let's say let's say this. Let's say I am
[21:38] not in my sins. Let's say it together.
[21:39] Ready? I am not in my sins. Where am I?
[21:42] I'm hid in Christ Jesus. That's where
[21:45] you are, church. And if the devil fights
[21:47] you on that, take him right to here. I'm
[21:48] not my sins. How do you know Jesus rose
[21:51] from the grave?
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He perfectly loosed me,
[21:54] right? He washed me, which means
[21:56] perfectly. And if it's a perfect
[21:57] sacrifice, it's perfect forgiveness.
[21:59] Hallelujah.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; And if he took the curse, there can be
[22:03] no more curse because he perfectly took
[22:05] all the curse. And that means all the
[22:07] blessing is on you and I.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like those amens. Thank you.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. Then they also which are
[22:15] fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
[22:18] Hallelujah. So if Jesus didn't raise,
[22:20] you're still in your sins. And all the
[22:22] ones you loved and your ancestors that
[22:24] were believers, they're not saved
[22:26] either.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; So look, he just puts all this weight on
[22:29] this. He's putting all the weight that
[22:31] Jesus resurrected. All this weight.
[22:34] Everything in our faith is stacked upon
[22:36] the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And
[22:38] then the Bible says you get a down
[22:40] payment of it. Amen. Hallelujah. That's
[22:43] right. And the Bible says in Romans, if
[22:45] you've been quick, if you've got that
[22:47] spirit in you, it'll also quicken your
[22:49] mortal body.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; If you have a portion of that spirit,
[22:53] then the the Holy Spirit will come upon
[22:55] your body and quicken it and raise it up
[22:58] and make it live. If you've even got a
[23:00] portion of that Holy Spirit,
[23:03] &gt;&gt; what a down payment. Hallelujah.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Verse 19, we're
[23:09] making good progress here. Hallelujah.
[23:11] in if in this life only we have hope in
[23:14] Christ, we are men most miserable. Now,
[23:16] we've all we've all experienced this.
[23:18] All of us sometimes walk around, we're
[23:20] like we're just miserable because we're
[23:21] going through so many battles and we're
[23:23] in the US and we get spoiled. You don't
[23:26] have to say amen. You can just say ouch,
[23:28] right? We live in the US and everything
[23:31] is just easily handed to us and we
[23:32] really don't know how hard trials can be
[23:34] until somebody gets cancer, you know,
[23:36] some car accident, some tragedy strikes,
[23:38] right?
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Because our life is so blessed. God has
[23:40] so blessed America.
[23:42] But the early believers didn't have that
[23:45] uh blessing. They had to pray, "God,
[23:47] give me this day, my daily bread." They
[23:49] had to wonder, "Where's my next meal
[23:50] coming from?" Right? They didn't have
[23:53] Aldi. They didn't have uh Walmart. They
[23:55] didn't have all these grocery stores
[23:56] they could go to. They literally had to
[23:58] pray, "Give me today, Lord, some food
[24:00] today."
[24:02] Hallelujah.
[24:03] But that's the hour that we're living
[24:05] in. We can't change it. Right. And we
[24:06] don't want to change it. We don't want
[24:07] to change it. Right.
[24:09] Right? We don't want to get rid of all
[24:10] the food and uh have to live like that.
[24:13] But I just want to bring this up that he
[24:14] says we are the most miserable if
[24:16] there's no resurrection. So church,
[24:18] let's just take the attitude, let's not
[24:20] be miserable. Let's be thankful.
[24:22] Hallelujah. We have so much hope. We
[24:25] have eternal hope in Christ. We can't
[24:27] even put into words how much hope we
[24:29] have. So let us not be miserable, but
[24:32] let us be thankful. Let us be holy. Let
[24:34] us have hope for the future.
[24:38] Only those who don't have faith in Jesus
[24:40] Christ should be miserable. You and I
[24:43] should not be miserable.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; We should be hopeful by God's grace.
[24:49] I just want to emphasize that point. But
[24:51] now is Christ risen from the dead. In
[24:55] other words, we're not to be miserable
[24:57] and become the first fruits of them that
[25:00] slept.
[25:02] Hallelujah. So now Paul gets in this
[25:04] thought I mentioned earlier. Paul's
[25:06] going to say the reason everybody
[25:08] resurrects is because the first fruit
[25:10] resurrected.
[25:12] Remember on the 16th day of Nissan, they
[25:15] had the the feast of the first fruits,
[25:18] right? You had Passover on the 14th day
[25:20] that was fulfilled by Jesus's
[25:22] crucifixion. Then you have the feast of
[25:24] unleaven bread that was fulfilled as
[25:25] Jesus uh going down to hell, right? Uh
[25:28] getting the keys of death in hell. And
[25:30] then you have the 16th day, the first
[25:31] the feast of first fruits that was
[25:33] anti-ype or that was fulfilled through
[25:35] Jesus's resurrection.
[25:38] And that was the first fruits of barley
[25:40] waved before the people. And that was
[25:43] waved to let everybody know if the first
[25:44] fruits came to maturity, the rest will
[25:46] come to maturity.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; If the first fruits raised, everything
[25:51] else will raise.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:54] And so Jesus is raised first into
[25:56] eternal life and then he raised many of
[25:59] the Old Testament saints. Not all, but
[26:02] many. The Bible said the graves were
[26:04] open and many bodies of the saints which
[26:06] slept arose and came out of the graves
[26:08] after his resurrection and went to the
[26:10] holy city and appeared unto many. Now
[26:13] you remember this. The Bible says it
[26:15] plainly many of the saints. So Gideon
[26:18] was one of the furthest ones away. He
[26:19] was buried near Bethl. of David and
[26:22] Solomon and all the faithful believers
[26:23] that were buried there in Jerusalem, the
[26:25] city of David. And Abraham, Sarah,
[26:27] Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, all their bones
[26:29] were in Hebrron, just about 20 miles
[26:32] south of Jerusalem. And they all wanted
[26:34] their bones to be there. They all wanted
[26:36] their bones to be near Jerusalem. Why?
[26:38] Because they knew the Messiah. And I
[26:40] would say Job's in there, too.
[26:41] Hallelujah. Ezekiel, Daniel, all the Old
[26:44] Testament saints. Hallelujah. They all
[26:46] wanted their bones there because they
[26:48] knew one day they would see their
[26:50] redeemer as Job said, "I know my
[26:52] redeemer liveth and I'll stand with him
[26:55] on the earth at the last day. And though
[26:57] the skin worms destroy this body, yet in
[27:00] my flesh, amen, resurrected flesh, I
[27:02] shall see God." Hallelujah.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; And so that's why they went and got uh
[27:07] Saul's bones. And that's why they went
[27:09] and got Samson's bones and they brought
[27:11] him to Jerusalem because they they knew
[27:13] there was a resurrection. And they knew
[27:16] God, if God made that body, he's not
[27:18] done with it. Amen.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Although that body falls apart, God's
[27:22] able to put it back together.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; They knew our bodies are in the image of
[27:26] Almighty God. Hallelujah.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; And that's where the Greeks missed it,
[27:30] right? They didn't realize, yes, the
[27:31] body's a trial, but the body is also in
[27:34] the image of Almighty God. And
[27:36] therefore, it's holy. Therefore, it's
[27:38] God's creation, and God's not done with
[27:40] it. GOD IS JUST GETTING STARTED WITH IT.
[27:42] HALLELUJAH. God's going to resurrect
[27:44] that body and give it a glorified
[27:46] condition and you can get to enjoy that
[27:48] body eternally world and ages without
[27:52] end.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Now for some of us who are shorter, we
[27:56] hope we get a bigger body.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; For the some of us who don't like some
[28:00] parts of our body, like I heard a man
[28:01] say, "I hope I'm resurrected with buff
[28:02] muscles or something like that." Now
[28:04] that's super carnal. But the point is
[28:08] God is not done with this body. God
[28:10] created that body. And remember the
[28:11] Bible said God knit your body together
[28:13] in your mother's womb.
[28:16] Hallelujah. And we know God's a God of
[28:17] variety, right?
[28:19] And so we just we have to respect God's
[28:21] choosing, right? Although we might feel
[28:23] a certain way about our bodies or
[28:25] something like that. Uh we might be
[28:26] discouraged or something or feel less
[28:28] than church. We're not less than. God
[28:30] made us into just his perfect plan. All
[28:33] things work together for good that that
[28:35] that love the Lord and them that are
[28:37] called according to God's purpose.
[28:40] Hallelujah.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 21.
[28:47] For since by man came death, by man came
[28:51] also the resurrection of the dead. So I
[28:53] like this thinking. Man produced death.
[28:55] So man has to produce life.
[28:58] And these are the simple truths. How is
[29:00] Paul going to prove to haters that don't
[29:02] believe in the resurrection? He's just
[29:03] got to use simple arguments like this.
[29:05] You either accept it or you don't.
[29:08] Right.
[29:10] And that reminds me of something I gota
[29:11] look up here. U so don't forget here. I
[29:16] just thought about that.
[29:19] It's in Timothy.
[29:22] Just bear with me here. I'm going to
[29:23] bring it up in just a moment.
[29:29] There it is. Glory. So get that just a
[29:32] moment. Verse 22. For as in Adam all
[29:35] die, even so in Christ shall all be made
[29:39] alive. Hallelujah. Now, this is
[29:41] interesting, too. I just put this
[29:42] thought in here. Adam caused all men to
[29:44] die. It says all, but almost all because
[29:47] Enoch didn't die. Unless there's some
[29:50] mystery in there. We don't know, right?
[29:52] Because the Bible the Bible thus sayith
[29:53] the Lord. So, this could be hyperbole.
[29:55] It's probably hyperbole, right? Or maybe
[29:58] Enoch's got to come back and die. I
[30:00] don't know, right? We don't know.
[30:03] Hallelujah. And Elijah to die. Now, we
[30:05] believe it seems likely that Elijah and
[30:07] Moses will come back and Elijah will
[30:09] have to die. It seems like that, but
[30:11] maybe not. Okay. Uh
[30:15] yeah. Well, I'm not ready for that other
[30:16] part with Moses. But so, uh Adam caused
[30:19] all men to die. Therefore, Jesus causes
[30:22] all to live. This is his reasoning. Man
[30:25] produced death. Man produces life. Adam
[30:28] caused all to die. Jesus made all to
[30:29] live. These are his reasonings. And
[30:32] we've got to believe it. Hallelujah. If
[30:34] not, church, we're just the most
[30:35] miserable people on earth. But I don't
[30:37] want to live a miserable life. I want
[30:38] people to look at me. He's a happy. He's
[30:40] a joyful man. And the church said,
[30:43] &gt;&gt; "He's a joyful person." What's he always
[30:45] smiling about?
[30:46] Because Jesus loves me. Hallelujah.
[30:48] Amen. As I said, my wife loves me. My
[30:50] children love me. Why should I not be
[30:52] happy? Amen. The church loves me.
[30:54] Everybody loves me. All my friends in
[30:56] the saints, Jose loves me. Amen.
[31:00] All these people love me. Why should I
[31:02] be happy? Praise God. Amen. Verse 23.
[31:07] But every man is resurrected in his own
[31:09] order.
[31:11] Christ the first fruits. Afterward they
[31:14] that are Christ at his coming. So again,
[31:16] we see God is the God of order. He makes
[31:18] sure the gifts are in order. The
[31:20] headship of the home and the church is
[31:22] in order. And he makes sure
[31:24] resurrections go in order. Everything's
[31:27] in order. Now, this is where some people
[31:29] go too far and they say, "Well, if it's
[31:30] an order, then we can predict the day of
[31:33] the rapture, right? Because it's an
[31:34] order,
[31:36] right? Like they try to predict it. Some
[31:37] fool tried to pred predicted last year
[31:39] around the time of the tabernacles.
[31:41] Tabernacles don't represent the rapture.
[31:43] Tabernacles represent the millennium.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; It just just with that fact alone, these
[31:48] people should have known that these
[31:49] people are deceived. Other all and
[31:52] that's on top of Jesus saying, "No man
[31:53] knows the day or the hour." It's just
[31:56] foolish.
[31:57] But see that they see they see some
[31:59] truth that God's a God of order like
[32:01] Jesus resurrection. Well, that was on
[32:03] the actual feast of first fruits. That
[32:05] was and so they think because of that,
[32:07] you know, 2,000 later, years later, God
[32:09] might do that again. Well, he might, but
[32:10] he might not.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:14] And it's foolish to try to know the day
[32:15] or the hour. It's foolish to do that,
[32:18] brother Chris.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:25] Yeah. And he will, brother. He will
[32:26] because all men will try to guess and
[32:28] he'll make sure it's a day they can't
[32:29] guess and they're also not looking for
[32:31] him. But the Bible says to all that love
[32:33] him, he'll appear unto them. Hallelujah.
[32:36] So, we have to love his appearing. We
[32:38] won't know the day or the hour, but
[32:39] we'll love that he's coming. Hallelujah.
[32:41] Good question, brother. Good question.
[32:43] All right, I'm almost done here. Hard to
[32:44] believe. I'm almost done already. But,
[32:45] uh, verse 24. This is a beautiful
[32:48] thought. Now, I cannot I still to this
[32:50] day I can't fully explain this, but it's
[32:52] in the scripture. Now, he jumps into the
[32:55] godhead. Who would have thought with the
[32:56] resurrection? Now Paul said, "We'll jump
[32:59] into let me give you a godhead nugget."
[33:03] Then come at the end when he shall
[33:06] deliver up the kingdom of God. Did you
[33:08] know Jesus has to deliver up the kingdom
[33:09] of God? Everybody know that
[33:12] he's going to give the kingdom back to
[33:14] the father.
[33:16] Everybody know that.
[33:19] Isn't that what any faithful son would
[33:20] do? If your father gave you something to
[33:23] take care for a while, wouldn't you give
[33:25] it back to him?
[33:27] I don't know, brother Jesse. That's what
[33:30] God did. That's what Jesus is going to
[33:31] do. Jesus will give the kingdom back to
[33:34] his father after he puts down all rule,
[33:38] all authority, and all power.
[33:41] So Jesus has full power over the kingdom
[33:44] now. And the Bible says we see we serve
[33:46] a kingdom that cannot be moved. Nothing
[33:49] can shake the Holy Ghost kingdom that
[33:51] we're a part of.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And we know Jesus Christ is not the king
[33:56] of this world. Satan's the king of this
[33:57] world, but Jesus is the king of saints.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is the king of this spiritual
[34:03] kingdom. He's not the king of the earth
[34:06] yet.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Satan has all these rulers. He's
[34:09] the god of this evil age, God of this
[34:10] evil world. He's not king of this world
[34:12] yet. Now he's king over all the
[34:14] universe. Right? But right now, he's
[34:16] king of a spiritual invisible kingdom
[34:19] that rules over our lives every single
[34:21] day.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because the Bible said
[34:25] the kingdom of God is within you. And
[34:27] you're supposed to seek ye first the
[34:29] kingdom of God. So every day you're
[34:31] seeking God. Let your kingdom grow in
[34:33] me. In other words, rule my life so that
[34:36] my life helps your kingdom to grow.
[34:42] So after the first fruits, after all the
[34:44] order of everybody gets resurrected,
[34:46] then comes the end where Jesus gives the
[34:48] kingdom back to the father.
[34:51] Now there's there's three domains here,
[34:53] right? He said he's got to get victory
[34:54] over all the rule, all the authority and
[34:56] power. And I tried to make sense of this
[34:58] so you could understand it. He's got to
[35:00] get power over all the spiritual rulers
[35:03] like the prince of Persia, like the
[35:05] prince of America,
[35:07] &gt;&gt; right? Let's let's bring it to our day.
[35:10] Right? Like the prince of Rome.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. All these demon powers
[35:16] that rule over. Jesus has to bring all
[35:18] those rulers down. And he will.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has to get victory over
[35:24] with all authority. And those are the
[35:26] civil governments because the Bible said
[35:27] there's no power, there's no authority
[35:29] but of God. So God will conquer the
[35:33] actual civil authorities. He'll conquer
[35:36] every nation. Hallelujah. And then he's
[35:39] got to get uh victory over every power.
[35:41] And the Bible said the pope antichrist
[35:43] has power with signs and lying wonders.
[35:46] So he's got to bring down the antichrist
[35:48] power. Hallelujah.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; It's awesome. It's kind of like a cat in
[35:52] a mouse, right? You've seen we've seen
[35:53] cats. I've seen my cat just throw mice
[35:55] around, right? Smack the mice around.
[35:57] And that's what Jesus when he comes
[35:58] back, he's going to take the pope and
[35:59] just the pope antichrist and just throw
[36:01] him in the lake of fire. Hallelujah.
[36:04] That's might be a little hard thing to
[36:05] to imagine, but that's the truth.
[36:08] He's going to get power. I'm sorry. He's
[36:09] going to get victory over all three of
[36:11] these areas. All the rule, all the
[36:12] authority, and all the power. King
[36:15] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; For he must reign till. So, did you know
[36:21] there's an end to Jesus's reign?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; And it's okay that I don't get many
[36:25] amens on that because I don't fully
[36:27] understand it either. All I can say is
[36:30] amen. It's the word. Can I explain it?
[36:33] No, I can't. Don't expect me to unless
[36:36] you can explain it. Hallelujah. But he
[36:39] will reign until he hath put all enemies
[36:42] under his feet. The last enemy that
[36:45] shall be destroyed is death because
[36:48] death and hell are cast into the lake of
[36:50] fire. Hallelujah.
[36:55] For he hath put all things under his
[36:56] feet. God God put all things under
[36:58] Jesus' feet. But when he saith all
[37:01] things are put under him, it is manifest
[37:02] or clear that he is accepted or outside
[37:06] or beyond or besides which did put all
[37:09] things under him. Now, I don't quite
[37:11] fully understand that verse, but it just
[37:13] shows that Jesus had everything put
[37:16] under him by God. And so, when Jesus has
[37:18] fully accomplished it, he's going to
[37:20] give it all back to God
[37:23] because that's the headship of eternity.
[37:25] Hallelujah, brother Chris.
[37:37] Yes, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Yep. Good
[37:39] question. Yeah, for sure. Uh yeah,
[37:41] because the Bible said the fullness of
[37:42] the godhead body dwelt in Christ. Yeah,
[37:45] the Bible never says well u he said yeah
[37:48] he said I I'm dead I was alive and I
[37:51] live forever more. So that body, that
[37:53] glorified body of Jesus is always going
[37:54] to be the image of God because the Bible
[37:57] said he is the image of the invisible
[37:59] God. Very good question. But it seems
[38:02] like the reigning or the control over
[38:05] the kingdom, that body, Jesus will give
[38:07] it back to the father.
[38:09] I can't explain it, but I believe it.
[38:13] And when all things shall be subdued
[38:15] unto him, then shall the son also
[38:18] himself be subject unto him, the father
[38:21] that put all things under him, that God
[38:24] may be all in all. I imagine Paul just
[38:26] blew everybody's mind in Corinth. They
[38:28] were just asking about the resurrection.
[38:30] Now Paul goes all the way back to the
[38:32] after all the resurrections, then it all
[38:35] go Jesus gives everything back to God
[38:37] the father. Okay, Paul, you you lost me.
[38:40] That's what I would have said if I would
[38:41] have been a church. I would have said,
[38:42] "Amen." But I don't understand it. I
[38:45] believe it. Paul, you met Jesus. You got
[38:47] all the requirements in in the book of
[38:49] Second Corinthians. He goes through all
[38:50] of his resume of how he was a a true
[38:52] apostle of God, but I don't understand
[38:53] it. And even Peter said, he writes some
[38:55] things that are hard to understand.
[38:58] Do you remember that verse? Yeah. Peter
[39:00] says that he said, "But the evil men
[39:02] twist or rest the scriptures and make
[39:05] Paul say something that he didn't say."
[39:08] And he said, "They'll be condemned for
[39:09] that.
[39:11] So the son after every enemy's defeat
[39:14] after death is put away the pope
[39:16] antichrist all these things even the son
[39:18] then will be subject or obedient unto
[39:21] God. So God can be all in all.
[39:28] So right now God is not all in all.
[39:32] I don't understand it. But God will be
[39:35] all in all after every enemy is defeated
[39:38] and Jesus gives the kingdom back to God.
[39:42] Hallelujah.
[39:47] Brother Ram explains it like this,
[39:48] brother Chris. He said, "On top of Mount
[39:50] Zion will set the lamb." Speaking of uh
[39:52] the new Jerusalem, "And the city will
[39:54] need no light, for the lamb is the light
[39:56] thereof, and above the lamb will be the
[39:58] father, which is the logos, God, the
[39:59] great light, that eternal light that'll
[40:01] shine just above the throne." So brother
[40:04] Ram his idea was Jesus will sit Jesus
[40:06] will sit on the throne on the new
[40:08] Jerusalem but then there will be a
[40:09] pillar of fire over his head to remind
[40:11] us or some pillar of fire to remind us
[40:13] that Jesus is even under the headship of
[40:16] the father that's what brother Ram says
[40:19] all all we all the scripture we have is
[40:21] that Jesus is the light so that city
[40:23] will not need the sun or the moon that's
[40:25] what the scripture says
[40:27] and Jesus will not be on his father's
[40:29] throne he'll be on his throne and the
[40:31] father will hover over the son. I see I
[40:33] like this just because it's just it's
[40:34] just one idea. It's not thus sayith the
[40:35] Lord. Just one idea. The father will
[40:37] hover over the son which the father and
[40:39] son will be one. And while they're yet
[40:41] speaking, the Old Testament says, I'll
[40:43] answer.
[40:45] Before they can think, I'm thinking for
[40:48] them.
[40:50] This is how much God is going to possess
[40:52] each one of us. The Bible says that
[40:54] before they call, God will answer. So
[40:57] they get ready to say, "Lord, what
[40:58] should I do?" And the answer will
[41:00] already come before you can even get it
[41:01] out. It's kind of like when your phone's
[41:03] ringing, right? You go to your phone,
[41:04] but before you even go there, the
[41:06] answer's already there, right? When just
[41:09] as soon as you need something, oh, it'll
[41:10] be there. Glory.
[41:13] That's how much God wants to be one with
[41:15] us. Praise God.
[41:18] That's right. And Jesus will commit,
[41:20] here it is, a perfect age to a perfect
[41:23] living God that he has redeemed and give
[41:26] give over to the father.
[41:29] He said, "Is that right? We'll turn to
[41:32] God the Father, which is spirit,
[41:33] invisible spirit, not a man. Spirit, all
[41:35] nature of goodness gathered together.
[41:38] That's God."
[41:40] And again, I don't understand all this,
[41:42] brother Mercy, but I believe it.
[41:44] Hallelujah. Jesus has to commit it back
[41:47] to the father. Father, I've been
[41:49] faithful. I've done everything you told
[41:51] me to do. I'm committing this back to
[41:53] you, Father. I'm now becoming in
[41:55] subjection to you.
[41:57] But I thought Jesus was always in
[41:58] subject to the father. He is. But this
[42:01] must be another level.
[42:04] Hallelujah. Because that's what the
[42:05] Bible says. I just believe the Bible,
[42:06] brother Patrick. I don't I don't I don't
[42:09] claim to understand everything, but I
[42:10] believe everything.
[42:13] We're almost done.
[42:15] Now, this is one uh Claude asked me
[42:17] about this summer. Else what shall they
[42:20] do which are not which are baptized for
[42:22] the dead if the dead rise not at all?
[42:25] Why are they, notice he doesn't say us,
[42:28] why are we, or he doesn't say we, I
[42:30] should have put in there, why are they,
[42:33] not we, then baptized for the dead.
[42:38] Paul's not teaching baptism for the dead
[42:40] here.
[42:42] He's simply recognizing that it exists
[42:45] amongst the Corinthians.
[42:47] Someone is baptizing for the dead.
[42:50] He's asking, "If the dead do not rise,
[42:52] then why are there groups baptizing for
[42:54] the dead?
[42:55] He's just making a point. Now, church,
[42:57] you have to remember this. Just because
[42:59] something's in the Bible doesn't mean
[43:00] the Bible's teaching you to do it.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a couple examples. Just
[43:06] because Saul went to the witch witch of
[43:08] Andor, that's not teaching you to go to
[43:10] witches.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible, but it's not teaching
[43:13] you to go to witches. Now, this can be
[43:15] serious for the brothers. Just because
[43:16] Paul circumcised Timothy doesn't mean
[43:18] you brothers got to go circumcise
[43:20] another man.
[43:22] It's in the Bible. But Paul's not
[43:24] teaching you what to do. And the church
[43:25] said,
[43:26] &gt;&gt; "Those just two examples I can teach
[43:28] you, right, brother?"
[43:30] So you have to understand, he's not
[43:32] saying, "We baptize for the dead." He's
[43:34] just recognizing some people do it.
[43:36] Well, why do they do it if there's no
[43:37] resurrection?
[43:40] Now, that's one way to look at it.
[43:41] Brother Brandham looks at it this way.
[43:43] Look what Brother Ram says.
[43:45] Brother Brandham says this, "Esest what
[43:48] shall they do which are baptized for the
[43:50] dead?" In other words, the dead is the
[43:53] Lord Jesus Christ
[43:55] if the Lord Jesus Christ rises not at
[43:57] all. In other words, why do they baptize
[44:00] for the the dead Lord Jesus if the rest
[44:02] of the dead rise not at all? That's what
[44:04] brother Brandon says, which that makes
[44:06] sense. That's kind of hard for me to
[44:07] understand, but it does make sense. He
[44:09] says in 1954, Paul speaking here was
[44:11] talking of the dead Jesus Christ.
[44:14] And remember in 1 Corinthians, I believe
[44:15] it's chapter 1, the Bible says, uh, you
[44:18] you're baptized in the name of the one
[44:20] who died for you. Let me get that real
[44:23] quick. That way, you got it. And I still
[44:26] got my other verse here. I'm going to
[44:27] close with that one.
[44:32] Yeah, there it is. It's It's If you have
[44:34] your Bible, 1 Corinthians 1:13. I'm
[44:36] going long here. I I got to I got to
[44:38] finish it. Uh, verse 12.
[44:42] Now this I say that every one of you
[44:43] saith, I'm of Paul. I am of Apollos. I'm
[44:46] of Cphus, and I have Christ. Is Christ
[44:48] divided? Was Paul crucified for you or
[44:50] were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[44:51] There it is. That proves you're baptized
[44:53] in the name of the one who was
[44:55] crucified,
[44:56] &gt;&gt; the dead one who raised again from the
[44:58] dead. So brother says, see, Paul's here
[45:01] talking of the dead Jesus Christ. If the
[45:03] dead rise not, why are you baptizing in
[45:05] Jesus Christ's name then if the dead
[45:06] rise not? So that's another that seems
[45:09] to be a very likely understanding of
[45:11] that verse. In other words, in other
[45:14] words, you're baptizing for the dead,
[45:15] Lord Jesus Christ. Right?
[45:18] Why are you doing that if the dead don't
[45:19] rise?
[45:21] Hallelujah. Because Jesus defeated
[45:23] death. Hallelujah.
[45:25] Okay. And then we're getting down to the
[45:27] end here. Yeah. Last last few verses.
[45:29] We're almost to verse 34. Now, if you
[45:31] have your Bible, go to second Timothy
[45:34] um
[45:36] verse uh 2 Timothy 2:15,
[45:40] Paul says uh so so he gives he gives one
[45:43] reason. He said they're baptizing for
[45:45] the dead. Why would they do that if
[45:46] there's no resurrection? Here's another
[45:48] example. He says, "And Paul continues to
[45:50] poke holes in their arguments and their
[45:52] false teachings about no resurrection.
[45:54] And why do we stand in jeopardy every
[45:56] hour?" In other words, why do we risk
[45:58] our lives if there's no resurrection?
[46:01] Right? Why if there's no if if this is
[46:03] all we had, I wouldn't risk my life. I
[46:05] do everything to protect my life if
[46:07] there's no resurrection.
[46:10] Hallelujah.
[46:13] Now, this is this has always been a just
[46:15] a a difficult wording to understand, but
[46:18] it's because I'm not smart enough. It's
[46:19] not because Paul's super smart. And
[46:21] remember, Peter said, "Some things are
[46:22] hard to understand, but I've just never
[46:24] been smart." So, I looked it up in some
[46:26] commentaries by Matthew Henry and Albert
[46:28] Barnes and Jameson Falset Brown, and
[46:30] they all kind of agreed on this. He
[46:32] said, 'I protest by your rejoicing which
[46:35] I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die
[46:37] daily. In other words, I'm putting my
[46:39] life on the line every single day
[46:41] because there is a resurrection. Now,
[46:44] here's another way to say it. In other
[46:45] words, I'm so certain of the
[46:46] resurrection hope in Jesus Christ for
[46:49] all of you Corinthians that I put my
[46:51] life on the line every single day.
[46:54] That's how convinced I am there's a
[46:55] resurrection.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Church, I don't know if you know what's
[46:59] coming next, but did you realize this?
[47:01] Paul fought beasts at Ephesus.
[47:04] So they would put Paul like in like a a
[47:07] human circus like the Roman coliseum.
[47:09] Now he's talking about Ephesus here, but
[47:11] Ephesus must have had a coliseum. And
[47:12] Paul, they'd throw Christians in there
[47:14] to wrestle wild animals.
[47:16] And Paul even had to fight wild animals.
[47:20] But look, God protected him. God got him
[47:23] through it. Look how far Look how far he
[47:26] was willing to go to stand up for
[47:27] Christianity. What if you got thrown
[47:30] into a pit with a bunch of wolves?
[47:32] Would you go in there? They say,
[47:34] "Recant, and we won't throw you in
[47:35] there." Paul went and fought the beast.
[47:39] And he stood, he'd do anything to prove
[47:41] that Jesus Christ was resurrected. He'd
[47:43] sacrifice anything. He put his life on
[47:45] the line. What a man of God.
[47:49] If after the manner of men, I have
[47:51] fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
[47:52] advantage it me if the dead rise not?
[47:55] Why would I put myself in harm's way and
[47:58] fight beasts if there's no resurrection?
[48:04] Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we
[48:06] die. So if there's no resurrection, he
[48:08] said, "Let's just take the attitude,
[48:09] eat, drink, and be married. We're going
[48:10] to, you know,
[48:14] let's just live it up."
[48:17] But look what he says. Be not deceived.
[48:19] Now, here we get to the point of this.
[48:20] The the whole sin behind this no
[48:22] resurrection is this attitude of let's
[48:25] just eat and drink and be married.
[48:27] There's no consequences to what we live.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody see that?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; So this was an evil false belief that
[48:36] there's no resurrection. Just live your
[48:38] life now. Uh live your best life now as
[48:41] Joe Olsen erroneously says because he's
[48:44] talking about he's talking about
[48:46] prosperity now. You should live your
[48:47] best life now for Jesus Christ
[48:49] spiritually.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; You might not be healthy. You might not
[48:52] have money, but you could be still
[48:54] filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; And not be prosperous financially.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Because you might not be called to be
[49:02] financially prosperous, but you might
[49:03] be. And if you are, be careful. There's
[49:06] a lot of snares. The Bible says riches
[49:08] are snares. You're going to get tested a
[49:11] lot if you got a lot of money.
[49:14] So, the whole point of this, don't be
[49:15] deceived. Corinthians, evil
[49:17] communications, all those false
[49:18] doctrines about no resurrection, that
[49:20] will corrupt your good manners that you
[49:22] have, your holy life. Now, Paul saw the
[49:26] other way, too. 2 Timothy 2:15, "Study
[49:28] to show thyself approved unto God." See,
[49:30] we got to keep studying the word of God.
[49:32] A workman that needeth not to be
[49:33] ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
[49:34] truth, but shun profane and vain
[49:36] babblings, for they will increase unto
[49:38] more ungodliness.
[49:40] And their word will eat as death a
[49:42] canker. It's like a flesh-eating
[49:44] disease. of whom is Himanius and Fletus
[49:47] Felitus who concerning the truth have
[49:49] erred saying that the resurrection has
[49:51] passed already and overthrow the faith
[49:53] of some. Now look, you got two extremes
[49:56] here. Some say the resurrection's
[49:58] already happened,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; so don't worry about it. Just live your
[50:01] best life now. Others say there's no
[50:03] resurrection. Just live your best life
[50:05] now. Both extremes are liars.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Both extremes have missed the mark. Both
[50:12] extremes are uh we say spiritually
[50:15] deathly diseases you don't want to get.
[50:18] You want to make sure you live a godly
[50:20] life right now
[50:21] &gt;&gt; because there's consequences eternally
[50:24] to the way you live your life right now.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:29] That's my last my that's my last one.
[50:31] Right. This my last one. So he says wake
[50:33] up to righteousness. In other words, see
[50:35] this false doctrine of there's no
[50:37] resurrection. It just taught people
[50:38] there's no consequences. I can live
[50:40] however I want. Yet the Bible, the Bible
[50:42] says every deed will come into account
[50:45] before God. So you better confess every
[50:47] deed so it's thrown in the sea of
[50:48] forgetfulness. Hallelujah.
[50:51] Every idol word, you better confess
[50:53] every idol word and make sure it's
[50:54] thrown in the sea of forgetfulness so
[50:56] you don't have to answer for it.
[50:58] Hallelujah.
[51:00] Because remember, who can lay any charge
[51:02] to God's elect?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Which demon's going to say, "Well,
[51:06] remember when you said that? Remember
[51:07] when you looked at that? Remember when
[51:08] you did that? Remember when you treated
[51:09] that person like that? You can't lay
[51:11] anything to the account of God's elect
[51:13] because it's all forgiven by the blood
[51:15] of Jesus Christ. Perfect loosing,
[51:18] perfect forgiveness.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Wake up Corinthians. There
[51:23] is a resurrection
[51:25] and sin not for some have not the
[51:27] knowledge of God. I speak this to your
[51:29] shame." So again, he shames this church.
[51:33] Hallelujah.
[51:35] He doesn't congratulate them. He shames
[51:37] them. Let's stand to our feet.
[51:41] musicians can come.
[51:44] So, church, I'm not shaming you tonight.
[51:45] I'm blessing you tonight. How many
[51:48] believe there's going to be a
[51:49] resurrection?
[51:50] &gt;&gt; How many know whether your body goes to
[51:52] the grave and whether skin worms eat up
[51:54] this body in a casket or in a ground or
[51:56] whatever you do with your body, how many
[51:58] know Jesus Christ is going to raise that
[52:00] body up?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you'll receive of all
[52:04] the good deeds you've done in this body.
[52:06] It is a promise. We are people most
[52:09] hopeful. Hallelujah. We are people most
[52:13] victorious in this life by Jesus Christ
[52:16] our Lord. How many believe that tonight?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the most evidence for our
[52:21] faith church. The most proofs. And on
[52:24] top of all that, all the proofs I said
[52:26] out there, on top of that, we have a
[52:27] proof on the inside.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Ghost.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His spirit bears witness
[52:34] that with our spirit that we are the
[52:37] children of the eternal one.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And if the eternal one resurrected,
[52:41] you'll resurrect.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Get that song ready. That same spirit
[52:45] that raised Christ from the dead dwell
[52:46] in you. It'll quicken your mortal body.
[52:47] How many thankful for that tonight?
[52:49] &gt;&gt; As brother Ram said, I'm more thankful
[52:51] for that than anything I know in the
[52:52] world. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father
[52:55] God, we love you tonight. We thank you
[52:57] for the word we've heard. Lord, I pray
[52:59] it would sink down deep in the hearts of
[53:00] your people. This is thus sayith the
[53:02] scripture. My words might have failed,
[53:04] but your word, Lord, will never fail. Oh
[53:08] God, may every person have their hope in
[53:10] the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Oh,
[53:13] we're not most miserable. We're most
[53:15] blessed. Hallelujah.
[53:17] We are most hopeful.
[53:20] We should be most encouraged, Lord God.
[53:22] Help me, Lord. Help every one of us to
[53:24] be encouraged here tonight. not
[53:25] miserable,
[53:27] not worried about the future,
[53:30] but willing as Paul to go to any lengths
[53:34] to stand on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[53:38] For it is the gospel, the good news.
[53:42] Hallelujah.
[53:44] It is hope for the hopeless.
[53:46] It is peace for the anxious.
[53:50] It is encouragement for the discouraged.
[53:54] Hallelujah. It is life for the lifeless.
[53:58] Thank you, Lord, for the truth that we
[53:59] have in your word today. Lord, it's such
[54:01] a joy to preach it. As Paul said, it's
[54:02] like honey in our mouth but bitter in
[54:04] our belly, Lord God. Oh, it's so sweet
[54:06] tonight, Lord, to know all you've done,
[54:08] Lord Jesus, and to see all that Paul
[54:10] went through to deliver this gospel.
[54:13] And I want to thank you, Lord, just as I
[54:15] thank the church. Thank you for a church
[54:16] that doesn't get these evil spirits of
[54:19] suing, of division,
[54:21] of sexual morality. Lord, keep our
[54:23] church clean, I pray. May we have a hope
[54:26] for a resurrection.
[54:28] I remember what Solomon said in his last
[54:30] words of Holy Rit. Let us hear the
[54:33] conclusion of the matter. Fear God and
[54:35] keep his commandments. For God will
[54:38] bring every action into judgment,
[54:40] whether good or evil. The last words of
[54:43] a man who had all the money, all the
[54:45] women, all the power, all the
[54:47] construction ability,
[54:51] the pools, the gardens, he had
[54:52] everything.
[54:54] And yet his conclusion was, "Fear God.
[54:57] Keep his commands." And Lord, we fear
[54:59] you and we also love you as well, Lord
[55:01] God.
[55:03] For we know faith works by love. We love
[55:06] you tonight for the old rugged cross.
[55:08] Lord, Jesus died. He was buried. being
[55:10] resurrected according to the scriptures.
[55:11] Lord God, thank you for this blessed
[55:13] hope, this blessed promise that we have
[55:15] in Christ Jesus our Lord. Hallelujah. We
[55:18] are men most thankful tonight.
[55:21] Men and women most helpful. I'm sorry,
[55:24] hopeful, dear God. You've given us all
[55:27] the help we need as well. So bless your
[55:29] people here tonight as we worship and
[55:30] sing in Jesus Christ's
