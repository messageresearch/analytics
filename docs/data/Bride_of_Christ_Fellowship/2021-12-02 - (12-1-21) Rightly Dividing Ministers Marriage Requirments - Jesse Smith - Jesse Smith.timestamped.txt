[11:39] it's not been a good day
[11:42] so let's remember her please in prayer
[11:50] so her name is kathy let's remember
[11:52] kathy kathy's done a lot for me

[12:37] and our ministry he donated a large
[12:40] amount to get the last book published so

[12:44] but if it's out on the internet now it's
[12:46] too late now you know
[12:48] of course he wouldn't want any public
[12:50] acknowledgement of that but
[12:51] couldn't have been done without his help
[12:53] and of course brother cam's help
[12:56] but he's 34 i believe today

[28:11] let's go to second timothy two second
[28:13] timothy two verse fifteen i'm gonna text
[28:15] my wife real quick
[28:16] i'm going to ask her how does
[28:18] the mic
[28:20] alone sound now
[28:27] i'd like to do a little different topic
[28:28] here tonight by god's grace
[28:31] i've been studying this week and
[28:34] been in contact with a few people
[28:36] not from our church but
[28:37] i'd like to look at rightly dividing
[28:40] ministers marriage requirements i've
[28:42] been studying on that i'm going to make
[28:44] i'm actually in the process of editing
[28:46] the video so i've been kind of studying
[28:47] on that lately and i'd like to go over
[28:49] this i think it's really going to be
[28:50] helpful for our church
[28:52] and then anyone else you know there's
[28:54] numerous people who have contacted me
[28:56] preachers even and pastors from
[28:59] i mean just a few but from all around
[29:01] the world and they
[29:02] they kind of ask me these questions and
[29:04] so i want to just
[29:06] look at it
[29:09] so i want to
[29:11] try to uh address this here tonight by
[29:13] god's grace i think it'll be a blessing
[29:17] so my wife says the volume is uh very
[29:19] quiet except when i'm very loud
[29:22] so i'll try to maybe just hold us a
[29:24] little closer here i'm sorry if i'm
[29:25] blasting everybody i don't want to do
[29:26] that but
[29:29] and then we have you know we have some
[29:30] people at church i've allowed them now
[29:31] to
[29:33] just call our church home our church
[29:34] their home church but they don't live in
[29:36] the u.s
[29:37] they don't have a home church
[29:39] so i just said please
[29:41] watch every service and then i'm going
[29:43] to try to
[29:44] reach out to them every week with a
[29:46] email see how they're doing
[29:48] i mean they've asked me numerous times i
[29:50] just said well okay let's try this see
[29:51] how it goes
[29:52] if you don't have a
[29:54] pastor you know we will be free
[29:57] we'll try to feed their souls by the
[29:59] grace of god
[30:00] so we'll try to do that
[30:03] that's why some of these topics i
[30:04] believe will be important for those
[30:06] who maybe have never heard this subject
[30:07] before
[30:09] um so i i've never preached it live i
[30:11] preached it one time in 2016 in the
[30:13] other sanctuary there
[30:15] but i didn't make it i didn't make it
[30:16] public well i'm going to make this one
[30:17] public of course and then i'm going to
[30:19] make a video on it
[30:20] because i believe it'll help especially
[30:22] preachers if they can really get a grasp
[30:24] on this
[30:24] i believe it'll help them and especially
[30:26] the young people if the lord tarries
[30:27] they're going to grow up they're going
[30:28] to hear all kinds of questions
[30:30] about different message churches why do
[30:32] some believe this why do some believe
[30:33] that and it needs to be answered uh i i
[30:37] think a lot of people uh
[30:40] a lot of churches maybe do a disservice
[30:43] when they don't answer questions that's
[30:45] what i personally believe i'm a very
[30:47] inquisitive person you know
[30:49] so when when these people left the
[30:51] message you know in 2012 i wouldn't know
[30:53] why why would you leave the mess this
[30:54] has been heaven to me
[30:56] i didn't know the message i came into it
[30:58] it's been heaven to me why would
[31:00] somebody leave it
[31:01] well as i started studying that well
[31:03] then i could have an understanding of
[31:05] why people
[31:06] might have questions or why they would
[31:08] uh maybe not understand a subject
[31:12] i still don't think it was reason to
[31:14] leave
[31:16] but anyways let's look at this topic
[31:18] here i know i'm doing a lot of talking
[31:19] here let's get right to the word of god
[31:20] here
[31:23] so my wife says we'll have to keep it
[31:24] right up here so i'll try not to speak
[31:26] too loud here
[31:27] but i can't promise anything you know
[31:29] there's there's times and you know how
[31:30] it is times and seasons
[31:32] second timothy 2 15. let's read this
[31:34] together
[31:35] ready one two three
[31:37] study to show thyself approved unto god
[31:41] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[31:44] rightly dividing the word of truth
[31:48] praise god
[31:49] now let's go to leviticus 21 if we could
[31:52] leviticus 21 this is the verse brother
[31:54] branham uses about ministers marriage
[31:55] requirements
[31:58] in 1965 marriage and divorce february
[32:06] verse 7
[32:08] and we'll read verse 9.
[32:11] these are of course
[32:12] mature verses here
[32:16] and you know when young people have
[32:17] questions i always try to just answer it
[32:20] as generally as possible
[32:22] and then
[32:24] say
[32:24] if you still don't understand it just
[32:26] wait a few years when you're older i'll
[32:28] address it then when you're older
[32:30] or parents can address it whenever they
[32:31] want because they're the parents
[32:33] but for me if i'm teaching someone
[32:35] else's children then i always say that
[32:37] you know this is as far as i can explain
[32:39] it
[32:40] and then as you mature we'll revisit
[32:42] this again but some of the some of these
[32:43] things aren't important for children to
[32:45] understand yet
[32:46] the main thing is get them saved praise
[32:48] god main thing is i know they're a
[32:50] sinner and the blood of jesus christ can
[32:52] remit all their sins away
[32:54] and get baptized and be saved by the
[32:56] grace of god that's the most important
[32:58] thing
[32:59] leviticus 21 7. you don't have to read
[33:01] it with me i'll read it but
[33:02] verse 7 they shall not take a wife that
[33:04] is a or profane neither shall they
[33:06] take a woman put away from her husband
[33:09] for he is holy unto his god
[33:12] verse 9 and the daughter of any priest
[33:14] if she profane herself by playing the
[33:17] she
[33:18] profaneth her father she shall be burnt
[33:20] with fire
[33:21] that's quite a serious scripture right
[33:23] that's quite a scary scripture
[33:25] verse 13
[33:26] and he shall take a wife and her
[33:27] virginity now of course is speaking of
[33:29] the high priest now
[33:31] a widow or divorced woman or profane or
[33:33] in harlot these shall he not take but he
[33:36] shall take a virgin of his own
[33:38] people to wife
[33:40] all right let's bow our heads let's have
[33:41] a word of prayer here
[33:44] heavenly father god we just thank you
[33:45] for your grace and mercy we just ask god
[33:47] that you anoint me god to preach your
[33:49] truth which i believe as a workman i've
[33:51] studied myself approved unto you
[33:54] lord rightly dividing the truth by your
[33:56] holy spirit i pray you'd help me lord
[33:58] god
[33:59] to stay with thy truth lord god and i
[34:02] pray god you'll bless your people here
[34:03] tonight lord and those that are
[34:06] live-streaming god i just pray a special
[34:08] understanding for them may they just
[34:09] silence any phones they have lord or any
[34:12] other
[34:12] any other distractions and may they just
[34:14] focus right into the holy spirit under
[34:16] the atmosphere of the anointing of god
[34:18] in jesus name lord to give them the
[34:20] spirit of truth
[34:22] and so father we'll be happy to give you
[34:23] thanks and praise in jesus christ's name
[34:25] and everybody said
[34:26] amen praise god
[34:36] so i'm going to text my wife and say at
[34:38] any time
[34:39] if it gets quiet let me know
[34:48] all right so we'll start here and i will
[34:50] try to do you know 45 minutes this might
[34:51] be a two-parter maybe i'll finish this
[34:53] on sunday and remember also sunday we'll
[34:55] do a 10 a.m service so
[34:57] we'll try that and uh
[35:00] i like to i like to be flexible and if
[35:01] the people you know it seemed like
[35:03] numerous people wanted an earlier
[35:04] service you know i'm happy to do that
[35:07] like i said you know i just hope i know
[35:09] you'll be flexible with me too i think
[35:10] there'll be times and seasons where i
[35:11] want to have a later service again so i
[35:13] can go visit some churches and
[35:15] stick my face in there and say how you
[35:17] doing god bless you would your pastor
[35:19] like to have my books about the message
[35:21] you know so
[35:23] so i want to do that by the grace of the
[35:25] lord
[35:26] all right so um
[35:28] this is not going to work good here so
[35:30] in case you just go back to the
[35:31] scripture okay it's not really going to
[35:32] be good for me to show that because
[35:34] i'm kind of referencing two documents
[35:36] okay i'm referencing a document i made
[35:38] and then another one that has kind of
[35:40] more quotes on it
[35:42] and i'm sorry let me blow my nose for
[35:43] you i just had a runny nose all day
[35:44] today
[35:51] thank you
[35:52] so sorry about that
[35:54] okay so let's look here uh
[35:57] so my my title is rightly dividing
[35:59] ministers marriage requirements
[36:05] now this is a course a very personal
[36:08] subject right that's why i've never put
[36:10] it publicly but i kind of feel like this
[36:11] is the time i've talked to numerous
[36:13] brothers over the last week or so and i
[36:15] just feel like it would help a lot of
[36:17] people
[36:20] so i think it's worth
[36:23] putting out there
[36:24] and i think it'll be a help to people by
[36:26] god's grace so
[36:28] the question comes
[36:30] after you listen to brother brahms
[36:32] sermon marriage and divorce the question
[36:34] is are new testament ministers
[36:37] or preachers required to marry virgins
[36:40] that's the question
[36:42] okay and for many of the years of
[36:43] somebody say this as a minister i just
[36:45] thought it was that way for many years
[36:48] i never really studied it i always had a
[36:50] lot of questions you know my friends and
[36:51] i are in the message always had
[36:53] questions we couldn't quite understand
[36:54] it but we always just said okay
[36:56] it's on tape i'll just believe it
[36:59] but as
[37:00] time goes on i find so many other
[37:02] doctrines that i have questions about
[37:05] and
[37:06] i find so many opinions of brother
[37:08] branham's and just uh
[37:10] huma that we he calls it the human side
[37:13] i find so many of those that i start
[37:15] studying it more and i look at it from a
[37:16] more mature perspective
[37:19] uh so
[37:21] after all these years
[37:22] i think i came to the conclusion around
[37:23] 2016
[37:25] um that i i no longer thought that was
[37:28] scriptural so i thought that was just
[37:29] brother branham's opinion now
[37:31] so now i would say i believe the
[37:33] bible-based answer is no
[37:36] a new testament minister is not required
[37:39] to marry a virgin
[37:40] okay and i have at least six reasons why
[37:43] but i kind of want to background a
[37:45] little bit so you can see the
[37:46] understanding on it
[37:49] and i'm sure you know people will no
[37:50] doubt no doubt disagree right away
[37:52] they'll say who are you to correct god's
[37:55] prophet
[37:56] and my response would be to that
[37:59] uh would be
[38:01] every prophet
[38:02] needs their human side corrected
[38:06] every prophet
[38:08] male or female needs their human side
[38:10] corrected
[38:12] the divine side is the only part that
[38:14] doesn't need corrected
[38:17] okay so that's my answer and that's what
[38:20] brother branham said
[38:22] and he cares do you care for me
[38:25] 1963
[38:27] and lord willing we'll get to that let
[38:29] me just briefly reference it church
[38:32] before months before that sermon brother
[38:35] branham preached over the pulpit that
[38:36] martin luther king jr was going to lead
[38:39] millions into a death trap
[38:41] into a revolutionary war over school
[38:44] segregation
[38:46] and i could show you the quote later
[38:48] maybe i wanted to try to play it later
[38:50] on if i could
[38:53] brother branham says now remember it's
[38:55] on tape
[38:57] so brother bam lets them know
[38:59] he thinks there is going to be a
[39:00] revolutionary war because of this
[39:03] in the south
[39:06] and he says remember this is on tape
[39:08] well a few months later they asked him
[39:10] was that a prophecy and brother brahm
[39:11] says no he says i have nothing on it
[39:14] from from the lord that's just my
[39:16] opinion
[39:17] so what do we learn we learn people can
[39:19] be very opinionated and the church said
[39:23] you can be very opinionated right you
[39:25] can have strong opinions i can be very
[39:27] opinionated
[39:28] right and i try to i know i'm not
[39:30] perfect i know you're not perfect either
[39:32] but we try to when we're opinionated we
[39:34] try to let us let people know that's
[39:36] just our opinion
[39:38] okay
[39:39] for example i put that on my joseph
[39:40] branham video i don't believe he's a
[39:41] prophet in my opinion so a joseph
[39:43] branham guy emailed me this week and
[39:45] said well yeah you're right that's just
[39:46] your opinion you're wrong
[39:48] i think i'm right but that's my opinion
[39:50] but i try to be humble enough
[39:53] where that shows perhaps that guy wasn't
[39:55] very humble
[39:56] but i try to be humble enough to say
[39:59] that i stand to be corrected and that's
[40:01] why i say that i want i invite people to
[40:03] try to correct me to see if they have
[40:05] anything i don't know because if they
[40:07] have something i don't know i want to
[40:08] know it and then i can grow as a
[40:11] christian but if i just shut everybody
[40:12] off and say i'm not open to correction
[40:14] i'm not open to any other opinions which
[40:15] many people act like even though they
[40:17] don't say it
[40:18] right
[40:19] then they they fail to grow as a
[40:22] christian if they're wrong because
[40:23] nobody has everything right only jesus
[40:25] christ has everything right
[40:32] so let me just preface it with that
[40:34] who are you to correct god's prophet
[40:35] well
[40:36] i'm going to make another video and show
[40:38] how lots of people corrected brother
[40:39] branham i have a whole list of people
[40:41] that corrected brother branham including
[40:43] his wife
[40:44] brother neville
[40:46] uh brother sherrod
[40:48] there's so many people that corrected
[40:50] brother branham
[40:52] and he accepted it
[40:53] he said i always make time
[40:56] because i want to be right
[40:58] praise god
[41:00] and so what i found is that that
[41:01] statement who are you who corrects god's
[41:03] prophet it's usually just a cover for
[41:06] i'm too lazy to go study the scripture
[41:08] myself
[41:10] or i'm afraid
[41:12] to have a different opinion than brother
[41:13] branham about a topic that's a minor
[41:16] does everybody know there's majors and
[41:17] minors
[41:18] how many look it up there's there's
[41:20] scores of quotes another man talks about
[41:22] the difference between a major doctrine
[41:24] and a minor doctrine
[41:26] what does he say church what does he say
[41:28] the majors are salvation and the baptism
[41:31] of the holy ghost
[41:34] those are majors
[41:36] right
[41:37] he says he said other things like the
[41:39] coming of the lord are minors he
[41:41] actually says that in a quote
[41:45] so
[41:46] um
[41:47] now i would go as far as saying this i
[41:49] believe marriage and divorce about being
[41:50] married one time is a major
[41:54] but i believe this subject of a marriage
[41:56] requirement for a minister is a minor
[41:59] because we don't find
[42:01] brother branham's opinion in the word of
[42:03] god
[42:04] in the new testament
[42:06] okay and i know there's lots of
[42:07] questions on that we'll try to get to
[42:08] that by the grace of god
[42:12] but you know people say oh you don't
[42:14] believe the message i've given my whole
[42:15] life to this message
[42:16] i've left everything for this message
[42:18] i've been rejected by my family kicked
[42:20] out all my friends at college no one
[42:21] ever contacts me all because of this
[42:23] message
[42:24] if i would
[42:25] if i wanted to be popular i would have
[42:27] never come in the message i came in the
[42:29] message because i saw much truth in it
[42:30] praise god
[42:32] but when you come to any man or any
[42:34] woman you're going to have a human side
[42:36] that's not divine
[42:38] and god is going to allow them to make
[42:40] mistakes god's going to allow them to be
[42:42] human
[42:43] so we all can learn and grow in church
[42:45] we're going to find out
[42:47] that when there's a question someone
[42:48] who's really born again will seek god
[42:50] for the answer
[42:52] they won't just say well i'll take
[42:53] brother braham's word rather than
[42:55] searching it out well
[42:57] that's really not an honest approach
[43:00] if you believe god's infinite and god's
[43:02] eternal and god's still revealing truth
[43:04] then you would have a hungry heart you'd
[43:06] hunger and thirst for righteousness and
[43:08] you'd seek god for an answer on a
[43:09] question you had
[43:11] it's but it's easier it's lazier just to
[43:13] say i'm just going to take what the tape
[43:15] said well what if the tape has something
[43:16] different
[43:18] on the contrary side which this subject
[43:20] does
[43:21] there's a quote where brother bam is
[43:22] talking to a woman
[43:24] she's a former prostitute and drug
[43:26] addict and brother brahm says don't you
[43:28] want to be free from that he said you'd
[43:30] make a really good
[43:31] wife for a tire little preacher of gods
[43:36] a prostitute now prostitute
[43:38] now does that sound familiar like rahab
[43:42] that god can forgive a prostitute
[43:45] and bring her into a a holy marriage
[43:48] like he did with rahab
[43:50] right
[43:51] so you have quotes on both sides
[43:55] but let me say again brother rahm only
[43:56] preached this in one sermon he never
[43:58] preached this sermon before or after
[44:02] that's one of the the main points i need
[44:04] to make i just want to state that so you
[44:06] got it
[44:07] at the beginnings because i'm sure some
[44:08] people listen for five minutes okay i'm
[44:09] done with this guy he's a blasphemer
[44:11] he's a heretic and they won't even
[44:13] consider these other things
[44:15] see that shows they're in a they're in a
[44:17] complacent lukewarm state when you can't
[44:19] even receive when you're afraid to hear
[44:21] anything outside of what you believe
[44:23] then you don't have the spirit of truth
[44:25] you have the spirit of fear
[44:26] because if you've got the truth church
[44:28] you can stand there like a rock of ages
[44:29] amen i know the truth i've studied i got
[44:32] the word of god i know what's right
[44:34] praise god
[44:36] so see people like that well there's
[44:37] really nothing you can do to help them
[44:38] other than pray and show them the love
[44:40] of god brother bram said they have to
[44:41] know you love them first so that's why i
[44:42] got this smile on my face i love all my
[44:45] doubters or haters you know i love all
[44:46] of them all the spies that spy for the
[44:48] other side you know i love all them and
[44:51] i'm not afraid of what i believe because
[44:52] i've studied it myself and i know what i
[44:54] believe
[45:00] i do want to say of course i respect
[45:02] both sides
[45:04] i respect the side that upholds this
[45:06] teaching
[45:07] but i respect the side that doesn't
[45:09] uphold this teaching
[45:11] and i found a lot of preachers don't
[45:13] uphold it but they're scared to talk
[45:14] about it because they're going to get
[45:15] rejected by their other message preacher
[45:17] friends
[45:18] who are more popular and have more
[45:20] influence and so i don't want to live
[45:22] like that i'm glad i don't have to live
[45:23] like that i don't have to live by the
[45:24] spirit of fear i'm going to live by the
[45:26] spirit of faith praise god
[45:28] because i don't care who rejects me or
[45:29] not all i know all i care is about jesus
[45:31] accepts me praise god and i know he has
[45:33] amen
[45:34] hallelujah because i i was there when it
[45:36] happened praise god
[45:38] hallelujah
[45:40] and i can't see from the bible how
[45:42] the new testament requires ministers to
[45:44] marry virgins
[45:46] so i feel this statement my brother
[45:47] brand was his opinion it's not a major
[45:49] it's a minor
[45:52] now consider there's numerous examples
[45:54] of brother branham's doctrines
[45:56] and opinions changing or just being
[45:59] wrong because he was human
[46:01] let's do four real quick
[46:03] four doctrines that were changed were
[46:06] the godhead went from three persons
[46:10] he
[46:11] said he said oh third person how we love
[46:13] you and how we want you to burn in our
[46:14] hearts how you're burning in our hearts
[46:16] tonight third person the trinity
[46:18] and later a year later he condemns it
[46:21] and says it's thus saith the lord it's
[46:22] of the devil
[46:24] okay so there he is he's growing in his
[46:26] doctrine
[46:28] he's praying and thinking he's praying
[46:30] to the third person inside of him and
[46:31] later he calls that idea of the devil
[46:35] the baptism of the holy spirit brother
[46:36] man believed the baptism of the spirit
[46:38] and the filling were two different
[46:39] things
[46:40] he believed that for many years up to
[46:42] 1963 after that now he believes they're
[46:45] one and the same he puts it in print in
[46:47] the church age book where he says the
[46:49] filling and the baptism the ceiling are
[46:51] all one and the same
[46:53] that's a major too right
[46:57] third man's three parts brother branham
[47:00] changes on this back and forth
[47:02] i found today first he said the soul was
[47:04] the most innermost being
[47:07] and then he said in 1962 the spirit was
[47:09] the innermost being
[47:11] and then he goes at the end and now he
[47:12] says back to soul at the end of his
[47:14] ministry so he went just back forth back
[47:16] and forth that's how daniel 70 weeks is
[47:18] too
[47:19] he goes sometimes he says it's
[47:22] christ was crucified in 33 a.d sometimes
[47:25] he says 30 a.d
[47:26] sometimes he says there's a week there's
[47:28] seven years left for the tribulation
[47:30] sometimes he says there's three and a
[47:31] half years left
[47:34] and that's okay is that related to
[47:36] salvation no it's related to the future
[47:39] right
[47:40] man three parts is that really related
[47:42] to salvation no because uh whether you
[47:44] understand that or not uh you can still
[47:46] repent of your sins and be saved by
[47:48] jesus christ
[47:50] okay
[47:51] um
[47:52] and last fourthly brother brahm said the
[47:55] white horse rider was the holy spirit i
[47:58] think on at least three occasions
[48:00] in the in the first seal
[48:03] and then in 1963 and from then on he
[48:05] knows it's the antichrist spirit with
[48:07] thus saith the lord
[48:09] that's a total
[48:11] 180 right from satan i'm sorry from god
[48:14] to satan it's a total 180.
[48:17] so those are just four others there's
[48:19] many more doctrines you could go with to
[48:21] show that but those are just four
[48:23] and so brother brahm could be wrong
[48:25] about the godhead and grow
[48:28] that no doubt he could be wrong about
[48:30] this minister's requirement as well
[48:33] but again it's not related to salvation
[48:36] it's a minor
[48:38] now here's four opinions that we know
[48:40] were either wrong or he changed
[48:42] in 1951 brother branham said billy paul
[48:45] was his promise joseph sarah the baby he
[48:48] thought would be joseph wasn't a boy
[48:49] it's a girl and he loves her with all of
[48:51] his heart
[48:52] well four years later in 1955 they had
[48:54] joseph
[48:56] okay so that that opinion changed
[48:58] right
[48:59] but he never addressed it brother i'm
[49:00] just going to let it go and he kind of
[49:02] went on
[49:03] we never hear him addressing it on the
[49:04] tape
[49:06] 19 or a second one is brother i believe
[49:08] the usa would be totally annihilated
[49:10] with only tree stumps left by 1977.
[49:13] karen lived through that she saw that
[49:15] dolores they saw it many people went on
[49:18] spending sprees to live it up before
[49:19] jesus came
[49:21] lots of people did a lot of bad things
[49:24] uh before 77 thinking they could live it
[49:26] up before the end and it came and went
[49:30] so we know that opinion was not right
[49:33] the third one
[49:35] uh brother brahms said in 1964 he said
[49:37] there's so much mental retardation in
[49:40] arizona's public schools he said we
[49:42] can't have another generation
[49:45] and here we are we're 50 almost 57 years
[49:48] we've had another generation
[49:51] i don't know for sure but i think
[49:52] brother brown does have great
[49:53] grandchildren if not
[49:55] i know he has grandchildren for sure
[49:57] i don't know does he have great i will
[49:58] have to ask that later maybe he has
[50:00] great great so we've had
[50:01] you know generation afterwards
[50:05] and fourth that what i mentioned brother
[50:07] brandon said martin luther king jr would
[50:08] lead millions to the death trap in a
[50:10] revolutionary war battle
[50:12] but then he said months later i could be
[50:14] altogether wrong in my opinion about
[50:17] martin luther king jr
[50:20] so i just showed you four doctrines by
[50:21] the ram change which were important ones
[50:23] right godhead
[50:24] three parts of man uh baptism holy ghost
[50:27] the seals very important right that's
[50:29] part of the fulfilling the the
[50:31] revelation 10 7 finishing the mystery of
[50:34] god
[50:36] and then four important opinions
[50:38] that we saw were either wrong he
[50:39] admitted or didn't admit them but we can
[50:41] look now and see well
[50:42] those were just his human opinions
[50:45] all right
[50:48] now i want to
[50:50] state this one reason message believers
[50:52] cling to this minister's marriage
[50:54] requirement so much
[50:55] is because at the end of the sermon
[50:57] brother branham said
[50:58] his sermon was thus saith the lord all
[51:01] the way through
[51:04] and let me just caution our friends we
[51:06] have to be very careful how we interpret
[51:08] every thus saith the lord
[51:10] okay very careful
[51:13] because brother branham said thus saith
[51:15] the lord it will be about the brown bear
[51:18] but he didn't shoot it
[51:22] right
[51:23] now all that happened with the brown
[51:25] bear he did see the brown bear he just
[51:26] didn't shoot it i'm sorry they saw the
[51:28] brown bear he didn't see it but the
[51:29] brown bear was there
[51:31] so he never said thus saith the lord
[51:33] i'll shoot it but he just said thus
[51:34] saith the lord it will be and all the
[51:36] part that god did was but then brother
[51:39] branham failed the vision
[51:42] just like people can fail the vision of
[51:43] acts 2 38.
[51:45] just like joshua there were people in
[51:47] joshua's generation not joshua but there
[51:49] was people in joshua's generation that
[51:51] failed the vision and they didn't drive
[51:53] out all the canaanites
[51:55] right
[51:57] just like
[51:58] saul king saul failed the vision he
[52:00] didn't obey samuel's vision so the
[52:03] kingdom of god was taken from him i'm
[52:05] sorry the the
[52:06] the kingdom of israel was taken from him
[52:08] sorry
[52:10] and so samuel said you would have ruled
[52:12] forever had you just obeyed the vision
[52:15] amen
[52:18] so
[52:19] there's so much different now with
[52:21] brother branham because we have all
[52:23] these
[52:24] audio recordings of him we have no other
[52:26] prophet like that
[52:27] not martin luther or of course he had
[52:30] the gift of prophecy but he wasn't a
[52:31] prophet john wesley paul we don't have
[52:34] their human side so much
[52:36] and so we've really got to be careful
[52:39] as we listen to brother branham
[52:41] and the other example is brother brahm
[52:43] said i don't care if a woman shouts
[52:45] screams speaks in tongues if she cuts
[52:47] her hair she's dead thus saith the lord
[52:49] first corinthians 14 well that's the
[52:52] wrong chapter
[52:54] so
[52:55] there's one breath between thus saith
[52:57] the lord in first corinthians 14 and
[52:59] brother branham flipped from his divine
[53:01] side to his human side in that one
[53:03] breath
[53:05] so that's why we got to be very careful
[53:07] how we listen to every thus at the
[53:08] lord's statement because hair is not in
[53:10] first corinthians 14 hairs in first
[53:12] corinthians 11.
[53:14] but see a lot of people don't study
[53:15] these things maybe they don't hear them
[53:17] maybe they never heard it before so
[53:18] that's why i'm giving the background
[53:21] and if malachi raises up and you know
[53:24] sometimes let's say time goes on god
[53:26] takes me off the scene people got to
[53:28] know how to rightly divide the word of
[53:30] truth
[53:31] right because we don't know how long
[53:32] we're going to be here
[53:33] did brother rams
[53:34] or did all those people following
[53:35] brother brown think we'd be here in 2021
[53:38] absolutely not
[53:41] we may be here in 2041. we mean we may
[53:45] be here in 2061.
[53:47] we don't know but we want to be faithful
[53:50] and we want to rightly divide the truth
[53:52] while we're here praise god
[53:54] because the danger with this is if if
[53:56] it's applied wrong it becomes legalism
[53:59] where men glory in their flesh
[54:03] or women glory in their flesh rather
[54:05] than glory in the cross of jesus christ
[54:09] that's the danger and that's what i've
[54:11] seen i've seen at least two ministers
[54:13] major on this they major on this and one
[54:15] of them uh he majored on it
[54:18] and he allowed cutting hair makeup and
[54:21] now he's out of the message all he does
[54:22] is attack brother branham now
[54:24] and some of his children don't even
[54:26] believe in god anymore and i know that
[54:27] because i've heard it on the podcast
[54:31] because it was
[54:32] he must have presented the wrong way he
[54:34] must have been presenting william
[54:35] branham instead of jesus christ
[54:37] right so his children never got a real
[54:38] experience with god
[54:40] but we're not going to do that here
[54:41] we're going to present jesus christ
[54:43] first amen yes he had a servant named
[54:45] william branham yes he had a server
[54:46] named john the baptist but we give more
[54:48] honor we give all the worship jesus
[54:50] christ is the one increasing here praise
[54:52] god
[54:53] and of course we read brother bam's
[54:55] quotes we thank god for our prophet we i
[54:57] got the church age books out there the
[54:58] seven seals books all those things
[55:00] but jesus christ is the one increasing
[55:02] that's the one the children need to know
[55:04] most amen
[55:09] brother braham said i may not do it i
[55:11] may not live to see it he said but
[55:13] jesus or this message will introduce
[55:15] jesus christ to the world
[55:18] in other words brother am is not going
[55:19] to be the one introducing the message to
[55:21] the world because he's going to go off
[55:22] the scene so we need somebody else to
[55:24] introduce the message it's living
[55:26] preachers preachers that believe the
[55:28] word of god are sisters with a testimony
[55:30] amen
[55:31] right
[55:32] brothers with a testimony young men not
[55:34] preachers maybe but with a testimony you
[55:36] and i witnessing about jesus christ and
[55:38] then they get to hear what god's done
[55:41] in the past generation praise god
[55:44] because it's no longer in this
[55:45] generation it was a past generation but
[55:48] now we're taking up the mantle by the
[55:49] grace of god
[55:53] okay
[55:56] so brother bram says thus saith the lord
[55:57] all the way through
[56:00] now church if you remember brother ram
[56:03] said the same thing about the church
[56:04] ages and the seven seals at the end of
[56:07] the seals in the seventh seal sermon
[56:10] does anyone remember that he said he
[56:12] said the church ages plus the history
[56:14] plus the seals
[56:15] he says to the best of my ability it's
[56:17] thus saith the lord that's what he says
[56:20] but if you go back and listen were there
[56:21] mistakes on those tapes yes there were
[56:24] some mistakes he said 700 instead of
[56:26] seven thousand
[56:28] okay
[56:30] he also changed the years he said the
[56:32] the ephesian i'm sorry the laodicean
[56:34] church a started in 1900 well then he
[56:36] changed it to 1906.
[56:39] right there's
[56:40] there's numerous things that were
[56:41] changed he didn't mean every word was
[56:44] thus saith the lord he meant the
[56:46] revelations that were backed by the
[56:47] bible those were thus saith the lord
[56:50] and so it is with the marriage and
[56:52] divorce sermon not every word in there
[56:54] is thus saith the lord and the proof is
[56:57] about jacob brother bram said jacob had
[56:59] at least 12 wives
[57:01] but he only had four
[57:03] we'll look at those scriptures later
[57:06] okay so you have to be very careful
[57:08] how we listen to god's prophet because
[57:11] there's the human side
[57:14] now imagine the prophets that wrote the
[57:15] bible
[57:18] amen the church did you ever think about
[57:20] that
[57:20] how long did isaiah have to write to
[57:23] write 66
[57:25] and listen church not miss one word
[57:30] think about the anointing you'd have to
[57:32] be under
[57:34] co could you and i even write one
[57:35] paragraph and not make a mistake with
[57:37] the word of god
[57:38] it'd be very very hard right because
[57:40] we're not prophets we couldn't do it
[57:43] so see brother ram was not like a
[57:45] writing bible prophet where they got
[57:47] they had to make sure every single word
[57:50] was exactly thus saith the lord
[57:52] now some people might argue the pickup
[57:54] in pen section now that might be i'd
[57:56] have to study more on that
[58:00] but brother brahms every sermon was not
[58:02] that way at brother ham's every sermon
[58:04] was not a chapter in the
[58:06] bible a lot of it was his human
[58:09] understanding
[58:10] right it's human emotion
[58:13] just like brother bram said uh i prayed
[58:16] for billy paul to be fully a prophet did
[58:18] you know that's a quote
[58:20] brother man said i pray billy paul is
[58:22] going to fully be a prophet is he fully
[58:23] a prophet no
[58:25] but brother man prayed
[58:27] and brother man prayed let rebecca lord
[58:29] take my place someday
[58:35] did that happen
[58:36] did rebecca take brother man's place
[58:39] no not in any fashion that i can see
[58:44] so there's so much of it is the human
[58:46] side he says i've always asked you to be
[58:48] careful what you're listening to
[58:50] okay
[58:53] all right so let's just start here
[58:55] let's just go to that jacob one okay go
[58:56] to since i'm already on it here go to
[58:58] genesis 31 and kesha this is where you
[59:00] can put it up there
[59:03] 31 47. i'm gonna need some readers here
[59:05] genesis
[59:07] my voice is definitely shot here
[59:10] but it's better than uh sunday and
[59:12] monday
[59:14] it's malcolm why don't you start from me
[59:15] buddy uh genesis 31 read verses 47 to 55
[59:19] 31 47-55
[59:39] oh
[1:00:13] okay thank you sir
[1:00:15] look jacob swears
[1:00:17] he makes an oath to god and said i won't
[1:00:19] marry any other women than your two
[1:00:21] daughters and then they're concubines
[1:00:25] so there's no way and if you there's
[1:00:27] other scriptures too we're not going to
[1:00:28] read them but for those listening
[1:00:30] genesis 32 22 genesis 35
[1:00:34] 22-26 and genesis 46 verses 5-27 show
[1:00:39] jacob's twelve sons by these four wives
[1:00:42] and there's no other counts of jacob
[1:00:44] having at least a dozen wives
[1:00:47] okay
[1:00:48] so there's your proof that that
[1:00:50] statement doesn't mean in marriage and
[1:00:52] divorce it doesn't mean every word in
[1:00:53] the sermon was thus saith the lord
[1:00:54] there's your proof he swears by the
[1:00:56] living god
[1:00:59] now if you swear by the living god and
[1:01:00] then break that then you're in big
[1:01:02] trouble
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:04] so again i offer a friendly challenge
[1:01:06] can anybody show me where jacob had at
[1:01:08] least 12 wives at least now that could
[1:01:10] mean there's 13 14 20 30 40. i know
[1:01:13] gideon had a lot of wives
[1:01:16] can anybody show me that in all the
[1:01:17] years i've shared this with numerous
[1:01:19] ministers sister and all the years none
[1:01:20] of them can say one thing against these
[1:01:22] points that proved it to me along with
[1:01:25] my own study in god's presence and
[1:01:26] praying i remember i fasted and prayed
[1:01:28] to understand this subject i don't know
[1:01:30] anyone else that's done that no no doubt
[1:01:32] there probably could be
[1:01:34] but i have laid on my face
[1:01:36] praying asking god let me understand
[1:01:38] this subject and this is where the holy
[1:01:40] ghost has directed me right to the word
[1:01:44] okay
[1:01:45] so i offer that
[1:01:47] humble challenge and i also say this i
[1:01:49] don't have any personal agenda on this
[1:01:51] my wife and i both met the purity
[1:01:53] requirements when we were married
[1:01:55] in 2003 by god's grace
[1:01:57] so this is not a personal
[1:01:59] vendetta i'm trying to get back at the
[1:02:01] preachers that don't like me because i
[1:02:02] don't meet their requirements no i meet
[1:02:04] their requirements although i don't
[1:02:05] agree with their requirements because i
[1:02:07] don't believe it's in the new testament
[1:02:09] praise god
[1:02:12] i don't mind saying that because i don't
[1:02:14] i don't i'm going to stand before god
[1:02:15] right i want to stand there as an honest
[1:02:16] man
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:20] now
[1:02:23] there's at least 20 requirements just to
[1:02:26] be a minister
[1:02:28] in the new testament
[1:02:29] there's at least 20 there could be more
[1:02:33] one of them is related to marriage
[1:02:36] and that is he's the husband of one wife
[1:02:39] that's all it says
[1:02:41] doesn't say anything about a virgin
[1:02:43] either side
[1:02:44] male female
[1:02:45] it just says
[1:02:47] husband and one wife
[1:02:49] and brother branham and the bible
[1:02:50] interprets that for us because
[1:02:51] adulterers will not inherit the kingdom
[1:02:53] of god
[1:02:54] any man preaching with a living spouse
[1:02:57] who's not his current wife that's
[1:02:59] adultery that man's disqualified and
[1:03:01] that would disqualify a lot of men
[1:03:03] preachers and women preachers if they
[1:03:05] actually believe the bible
[1:03:07] okay
[1:03:09] so let me go over this real briefly
[1:03:11] there's 20 requirements at least 15 of
[1:03:13] them are in first timothy three
[1:03:15] one to seven
[1:03:17] he's got to be blameless husband and one
[1:03:19] wife vigilant sober good behavior
[1:03:21] hospitality given to hospitality rather
[1:03:24] apt to teach not giving to wine no
[1:03:26] striker he's not quarrelsome he's not
[1:03:28] greedy or filthy luker he's patient
[1:03:31] covetous i'm sorry not covetous rather
[1:03:33] yeah i'm not covered just sorry not
[1:03:34] covetous ruling well his own house not a
[1:03:37] novice and he must have a good rapport
[1:03:39] of them without there's 15.
[1:03:42] now there's five more he must be born
[1:03:43] again brother man tells us you must have
[1:03:45] a burning bush experience
[1:03:48] 16. you must be called by god
[1:03:51] right you gotta have a calling
[1:03:55] 18 there's three more in the church age
[1:03:58] book
[1:03:59] power of spoken and written word i've
[1:04:01] seen that with my book and i've also
[1:04:03] spoken to mountains of obstacles and god
[1:04:05] has moved those mountains
[1:04:06] i've seen that in my ministry
[1:04:08] the power of the written word i've
[1:04:10] written all these brothers about this
[1:04:11] subject and no one's ever been able to
[1:04:13] show how it's wrong
[1:04:15] again that's the power of the written
[1:04:16] word
[1:04:18] 19 you've got to have fruit of your
[1:04:20] ministry the people that are saved and
[1:04:22] strengthened under your ministry
[1:04:24] and then six you got to be completely
[1:04:26] true to the word of god there's 20
[1:04:27] requirements to be a preacher one of
[1:04:29] them is about your marriage it's the
[1:04:31] husband of one wife
[1:04:33] okay
[1:04:36] hopefully that's true and again i'm open
[1:04:38] to all the correction okay let's go
[1:04:40] through the six reasons why i believe
[1:04:42] this doctrine is
[1:04:44] not scriptural
[1:04:46] first of all it's based on only one
[1:04:48] quote there's no quotes before
[1:04:51] no quotes after
[1:04:53] let me briefly read the quote
[1:04:58] uh where brother branham talks about
[1:04:59] this
[1:05:02] well first first here let me read the
[1:05:03] quote from marriage and divorce
[1:05:05] now brother says now let us in view of
[1:05:07] these vindicated truths of god search a
[1:05:09] little further if you want to now this
[1:05:10] may hurt just a little bit
[1:05:12] i'm going to skip ahead a little bit
[1:05:13] there's no minister that can marry a
[1:05:15] widow
[1:05:17] do you know that you wanted to read that
[1:05:19] all right it's he said leviticus 21 7
[1:05:21] and ezekiel 44 22 it will show you that
[1:05:25] the priesthood was not to be
[1:05:26] was not to marry a woman that's been
[1:05:28] touched by a man
[1:05:30] this type is of the virgin bride of
[1:05:32] jesus christ because they handled the
[1:05:34] fire of god the priesthood aaron's sons
[1:05:37] we haven't got time to read it and get
[1:05:39] out by noon we got 20 minutes yet
[1:05:44] and them as aaron sons them handled the
[1:05:46] fire of god so they could not marry a
[1:05:48] woman that's been touched by another man
[1:05:49] the unchanging god said so now look at
[1:05:51] some of these words in here
[1:05:53] these are really strong powerful words
[1:05:55] right
[1:05:56] there's the unchanging god said so
[1:05:59] but it's not thus saith the lord
[1:06:02] brother branham church also said
[1:06:04] the holy spirit
[1:06:06] i heard the holy spirit say joseph thou
[1:06:08] art a prophet now you show me any proof
[1:06:10] no one's been ever been able to show me
[1:06:12] any proof that man's a prophet
[1:06:14] but yeah brother brother brahm thought
[1:06:16] the spirit of god told him that
[1:06:19] but brother adam also thought the spirit
[1:06:21] of god gave that woman that dream that
[1:06:22] showed he was going to be shot upon and
[1:06:24] die going into a meeting to preach some
[1:06:27] series of services but the man said the
[1:06:28] spirit said not now but yet later
[1:06:32] okay
[1:06:33] so church we do the same thing sometimes
[1:06:34] we say we think the holy spirit told us
[1:06:36] something or and turns out it wasn't
[1:06:38] that way sometimes we say god did this
[1:06:40] god did that and turns out it wasn't
[1:06:42] that way
[1:06:49] i was just thinking about maybe one i
[1:06:50] could share here um
[1:06:53] oh
[1:06:55] i'm just gonna say this there's a
[1:06:56] brother in a church that was and i
[1:06:57] haven't shared this with him i forgot to
[1:06:58] share it but i'm going to share it with
[1:06:59] him on sunday hopefully he's watching
[1:07:01] there's a brother in our church now
[1:07:02] i was preaching at my house during coven
[1:07:04] last year
[1:07:05] and this white thing come up in front of
[1:07:07] the camera
[1:07:10] and the brother text me and thought it
[1:07:11] was the holy spirit
[1:07:13] well i didn't know what it was it's just
[1:07:15] this white thing it looked like it was
[1:07:16] looked like it was something strange
[1:07:18] well a couple weeks later i was at the
[1:07:20] house i was in my room and i was i was
[1:07:22] making the bed from helping my wife and
[1:07:24] i saw those white things it was a
[1:07:26] feather for my pillow
[1:07:28] so there's a wonderful brother in our
[1:07:30] church and i forgot to tell him that so
[1:07:31] i'm sorry brother
[1:07:33] he thought it was the holy spirit but i
[1:07:35] saw the same thing later it was a
[1:07:36] feather for my pillow
[1:07:40] so that's just one simple example right
[1:07:41] where we we think
[1:07:43] it's something out of the ordinary we
[1:07:45] think it's something different it must
[1:07:47] be god
[1:07:50] and i didn't know i thought it was god
[1:07:51] at first i agree with the brother i said
[1:07:52] praise the lord maybe it's a dove
[1:07:55] it turned out to be a feather of a bird
[1:07:57] close but not the dub we were talking
[1:07:59] about
[1:08:00] but it looked like that it looked like a
[1:08:02] fly
[1:08:03] and the brother set me in slo-mo it
[1:08:05] looked like a flying bird but it was a
[1:08:06] feather
[1:08:10] so we got to be very careful
[1:08:13] and remember brother man said the
[1:08:14] unchanging god said so but he also said
[1:08:17] remember i'm on tape martin luther is
[1:08:19] going to
[1:08:20] lead millions into a death trap can you
[1:08:23] imagine saying that on tape
[1:08:26] come back and later said i had nothing
[1:08:27] on the lord from that i nothing on the
[1:08:29] lord from that
[1:08:31] he said that's just my opinion
[1:08:34] see what do we have we have humans who
[1:08:35] are very strong willed strong opinions
[1:08:38] and that's fine as long as they're led
[1:08:40] by the holy spirit with the grace of god
[1:08:42] to know sometimes they have their own
[1:08:43] human side and that side may not be
[1:08:46] god's side
[1:08:47] or may not line up with god's side i
[1:08:49] should say
[1:08:56] now brother brandt mentioned this he
[1:08:57] later in the sermon he said a priest
[1:08:58] could only marry a woman that was a
[1:09:00] virgin
[1:09:01] now that was true
[1:09:02] then he says but a priest could not do
[1:09:04] that because he had he had touched or
[1:09:06] got a woman to be his wife that was
[1:09:08] already been some man's wife so that
[1:09:09] shows the vergency of the church of the
[1:09:11] lord jesus christ the bride we have to
[1:09:13] be unadulterated the word not one word
[1:09:15] missing nowhere
[1:09:18] now i counted the church brother ma'am
[1:09:20] spent two minutes and 14 seconds talking
[1:09:23] about this subject i believe it was over
[1:09:25] two hours sermon if i'm not mistaken
[1:09:27] that is a very short time
[1:09:30] to speak on a subject and then all these
[1:09:32] people around the world make it a thus
[1:09:34] saith the lord legalistic doctrine and
[1:09:36] don't even question it
[1:09:39] and he even said in there i don't have
[1:09:40] time to read it
[1:09:42] he didn't even have time to address it
[1:09:44] fully
[1:09:46] okay
[1:09:52] now church one more thing about that
[1:09:54] quote a priest could marry a widow
[1:09:57] if it was
[1:09:59] the widow of another priest but brother
[1:10:01] brahm didn't say that so brother brahm
[1:10:02] left out part of that scripture so even
[1:10:05] the quote brother branham has a human
[1:10:07] heir of leaving out part of the
[1:10:09] scripture
[1:10:10] he said there's no minister that can
[1:10:12] marry a widow well that's not true let's
[1:10:14] read it ezekiel 44 22 it wasn't fully
[1:10:17] the truth
[1:10:21] just like the 1977 prediction just
[1:10:24] wasn't fully the truth it was his own
[1:10:25] human opinion
[1:10:27] just like billy paul being his promised
[1:10:28] joseph that was his own human opinion
[1:10:32] he thought it was true
[1:10:33] right he did the best he could
[1:10:36] ezekiel 44 22.
[1:10:44] neither shall they take for their wives
[1:10:45] a widow nor her that is put away but
[1:10:47] they shall take maidens of the seat of
[1:10:49] the house of israel or a widow that had
[1:10:52] a priest before
[1:10:55] that's the key statement church that's
[1:10:56] the key statement right there
[1:10:59] because brother branham said there's no
[1:11:00] minister that can marry widow well the
[1:11:02] bible said they could
[1:11:04] if it was a widow of another priest
[1:11:07] everybody understand
[1:11:09] so in other words brother man's quote
[1:11:10] was incomplete he left this
[1:11:13] truth out of his quote
[1:11:16] okay so that's one thing i caught on
[1:11:17] right away too oh what about that this
[1:11:19] shows brother man was giving his human
[1:11:21] side in my humble opinion
[1:11:26] okay
[1:11:32] now let me say this church not for
[1:11:34] everybody but there's some people if
[1:11:36] you're not born again
[1:11:37] there's been numerous message ministers
[1:11:39] that have listened to marriage and
[1:11:41] divorce and thought brother branham
[1:11:43] supported polygamy in that sermon
[1:11:47] brother branham didn't support polygamy
[1:11:49] in the way they're thinking
[1:11:52] but if a person is not born again and i
[1:11:54] know i know people personally that have
[1:11:56] had this problem
[1:11:58] people will listen to that sermon and
[1:11:59] think brother man says it's okay to do
[1:12:01] polygamy
[1:12:02] it's not what brother brahm is saying is
[1:12:04] that the man is the only one who could
[1:12:06] have a living spouse divorced and
[1:12:08] married to another if she didn't confess
[1:12:10] her fornication when they got married
[1:12:13] but that's very few people it happens to
[1:12:15] very few people at all it's very rare in
[1:12:18] the world and the example was joseph and
[1:12:20] mary joseph thought she'd had
[1:12:21] fornication unconfessed
[1:12:25] so she could have or he was thinking
[1:12:27] about putting her away and get another
[1:12:29] because it was a un it was an untrue vow
[1:12:32] it's a false vow
[1:12:34] but then the holy spirit came down and
[1:12:36] show joseph the proof praise god or the
[1:12:38] truth of it
[1:12:39] okay
[1:12:40] does that make sense by god's grace
[1:12:43] that's the only case so that's the only
[1:12:44] polygamy that would be allowed
[1:12:47] but that man would still have just one
[1:12:48] wife that first wife that was put away
[1:12:51] she couldn't marry again and that man
[1:12:53] could have no other wives but people
[1:12:55] that are not born again in countries all
[1:12:57] over even in america countries all over
[1:12:59] the world they think that means a man
[1:13:01] can marry as many women as he wants
[1:13:03] that's a lie that's from hell
[1:13:06] but if you're not born again and you
[1:13:07] don't rightly divide every quote you
[1:13:09] could come up with that because you're
[1:13:10] not born again
[1:13:12] and you've got evil habits you've got
[1:13:14] evil spirits on you like we preached on
[1:13:15] on sunday praise god
[1:13:19] now i hope that's clear i hope everybody
[1:13:20] can see that by god's grace
[1:13:23] and like i said if the lord tarries the
[1:13:24] children got to know this i want them to
[1:13:26] know this
[1:13:28] okay now the quote where brother graham
[1:13:29] is on the other side is from that time
[1:13:32] 1961
[1:13:33] brother man went to a catholic insane
[1:13:35] institution and he said i talked to a
[1:13:38] woman and said and she said i started
[1:13:40] right back drinking and prostitution
[1:13:42] again
[1:13:45] and brother bam said you're a beautiful
[1:13:47] girl you'd make a real sweet heart for
[1:13:50] some tired little preacher i'm sorry
[1:13:52] little tired preacher of god's
[1:13:55] in 1961 praise god
[1:13:58] four years before marriage and divorce
[1:14:00] was preached
[1:14:02] even then he saw how
[1:14:04] a woman that was immoral physically
[1:14:07] glory
[1:14:08] could be forgiven by the blood of jesus
[1:14:10] christ and develop such a character she
[1:14:13] could be a wife of a minister
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:17] and the holy spirit didn't correct him
[1:14:19] at that point
[1:14:20] because i believe it was right
[1:14:23] that's what i believe
[1:14:25] because there's like i said there's six
[1:14:26] reasons i only got to i'm only on number
[1:14:28] one right now
[1:14:31] so that's the quote if people want to
[1:14:32] look it up well see now look church you
[1:14:34] got quotes on both sides so which one
[1:14:35] you gonna take well normally they'll
[1:14:37] take the marriage and divorce one
[1:14:38] because it's later
[1:14:40] but when you go to the scripture you
[1:14:41] don't find that requirement in the new
[1:14:43] testament
[1:14:46] well if that's the case what about
[1:14:47] deacons because it's not said that about
[1:14:49] deacons in the new testament either
[1:14:51] the word virgin is used 14 times in the
[1:14:54] new testament it's never mentioned in
[1:14:56] relation to any office in the church
[1:15:00] it's not even no office
[1:15:03] all
[1:15:03] it says is that god would that
[1:15:05] you would be all sanctified and
[1:15:07] abstained from
[1:15:08] fornication that's the perfect will of
[1:15:10] god god wants everybody to do that but
[1:15:12] of course not everybody's going to do
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:15] but god can still remember in first
[1:15:17] corinthians 6 the bible said such were
[1:15:19] some of you you were fornicators
[1:15:20] adulterers
[1:15:22] he said such were some of you but now
[1:15:23] you're washed you're sanctified you're
[1:15:25] justified by the spirit of the lord god
[1:15:28] in other words jesus christ blood washes
[1:15:30] away the stains
[1:15:32] from your fornication or your adultery
[1:15:34] or your even homosexuality god washes
[1:15:37] that away and you become white by in by
[1:15:39] the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:41] amen
[1:15:43] so that's the first reason second reason
[1:15:45] first reason there's only one quote and
[1:15:46] you have quotes on both sides second no
[1:15:48] new testament scripture teaches this
[1:15:50] doctrine
[1:15:51] and brother brahm said every doctrine
[1:15:53] must be genesis the revelation
[1:15:57] he said or it's not a solid doctrine
[1:16:04] okay that's a very short one because
[1:16:06] i've already covered most of that
[1:16:08] there's 20 new testament requirements
[1:16:10] for a minister at least and the only one
[1:16:12] says husband of one wife
[1:16:15] number three church the levitical
[1:16:17] priesthood was forever changed so have
[1:16:20] you got hebrews 7
[1:16:24] hebrews 7 11 and 12.
[1:16:32] verse 11 if therefore perfection were by
[1:16:34] the levitical priesthood for under it
[1:16:37] the people received the law what further
[1:16:39] need was there that another priest
[1:16:40] should arise after the order of
[1:16:41] melchizedek cannot be called after the
[1:16:43] order of aaron for the priesthood being
[1:16:46] changed there is made of necessity a
[1:16:48] change also of the law
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] so see we're no longer under the aaronic
[1:16:55] priesthood in fact in the church age
[1:16:56] book brother branson said be careful of
[1:16:58] the deeds of nicolaians they're going to
[1:17:00] bring you back under an aaronic
[1:17:01] priesthood
[1:17:03] so that's what i believe the ministers
[1:17:05] that have made this subject marine
[1:17:07] version such a legalistic thing they've
[1:17:09] made themselves another law a man-made
[1:17:12] law
[1:17:13] when i forgot to tell you the other
[1:17:14] preacher that used to
[1:17:17] really emphasize this well he still does
[1:17:19] he's still a preacher he's the one in
[1:17:20] minnesota i was telling you about
[1:17:22] he's the only one that's ever
[1:17:23] interrupted me in 17 years of preaching
[1:17:25] he stood up and said you better be
[1:17:26] careful preaching that i said sir just
[1:17:28] give me a moment take a seat and listen
[1:17:30] please listen to the word of god when i
[1:17:31] was preaching this very subject in iowa
[1:17:34] now the preacher is not from iowa where
[1:17:36] the preachers from minnesota
[1:17:38] and he still lives in minnesota
[1:17:40] and i sent him a letter asking all these
[1:17:42] questions never wrote me back that's
[1:17:44] what it is they're too scared they're no
[1:17:46] they don't have the depths of the word
[1:17:47] of god to even answer a simple question
[1:17:50] because they're scared
[1:17:52] god's not scared the bible said
[1:17:54] be always ready to give an answer for
[1:17:56] the hope that you have within you praise
[1:17:58] god
[1:17:59] always have an answer ready and none of
[1:18:01] these preachers that i've talked about
[1:18:02] this none of them have ever been able to
[1:18:04] show anything against this
[1:18:07] so that proves again to me that the
[1:18:09] spirit of truth has directed me to the
[1:18:10] word of god
[1:18:15] now
[1:18:17] if the levitical priesthood has changed
[1:18:19] then we can't take every word in
[1:18:21] leviticus 21 as required in the new
[1:18:23] testament
[1:18:24] because especially
[1:18:28] it's verse
[1:18:30] uh let's see
[1:18:32] church in verse leviticus 21
[1:18:35] what's the verse here let me i'm sorry i
[1:18:36] skipped it
[1:18:38] in leviticus 21 verses 18 through 21 the
[1:18:41] bible said a man can't be a priest if he
[1:18:44] has a blemish in his eye
[1:18:47] who had a blemish in his eye in the new
[1:18:49] testament that was a very important
[1:18:51] preacher
[1:18:53] so if you apply that one about marriage
[1:18:55] why don't you apply the one about the
[1:18:57] eyes
[1:18:58] if you do paul is now disqualified well
[1:19:00] who do we got then who who's the first
[1:19:02] church age messenger
[1:19:04] is he even saved
[1:19:06] you know if if he doesn't meet the
[1:19:08] requirements of the medical priesthood
[1:19:10] earlier in the chapter church the bible
[1:19:12] says in verse 5 and 6 leviticus 21 5-6
[1:19:15] if a man makes himself bald he's
[1:19:17] disqualified what about the preachers
[1:19:19] that shave their heads
[1:19:20] how are they going to be a minister
[1:19:23] if they shave their head the bible said
[1:19:25] if you make baldness you're disqualified
[1:19:27] for being a preacher
[1:19:28] in the old testament
[1:19:30] so how far do you take it
[1:19:34] the truth is we're not under the
[1:19:35] levitical priesthood we're under the
[1:19:37] priesthood of jesus christ after the
[1:19:39] order melchizedek
[1:19:41] all right i'm going to try to keep
[1:19:44] going here finish up
[1:19:48] because most of these churches i'm sure
[1:19:49] you've heard me preach over the years
[1:19:50] but it's been a long time it's been five
[1:19:52] years since i preached it
[1:19:54] um
[1:19:55] the priesthood is now changed
[1:19:58] the priesthood has now changed
[1:20:03] if if you hold up one of them why don't
[1:20:05] you hold the other ones then paul will
[1:20:06] be disqualified
[1:20:10] the fourth reason
[1:20:12] there's my 45 minutes the fourth reason
[1:20:14] is there's an obvious double standard
[1:20:16] against sisters in this doctrine
[1:20:19] most people only require the sisters to
[1:20:21] be virgin
[1:20:23] but the bible said men had to be virgin
[1:20:25] too
[1:20:27] because the type brother gives us the
[1:20:29] type it's christ and the church was
[1:20:31] christ a whoremonger
[1:20:33] was christ a fornicator
[1:20:35] no but i know numerous preachers in the
[1:20:37] message the men
[1:20:39] were fornicators but allowed to preach
[1:20:41] as long as they married a virgin woman
[1:20:43] that's hypocrisy that's a double
[1:20:45] standard
[1:20:47] that doesn't meet the word the very word
[1:20:50] they say they believe
[1:20:52] so it's an obvious double standard that
[1:20:55] targets sisters
[1:20:58] and it glorifies the flesh of the men
[1:21:00] right
[1:21:01] and glorifies the flesh of the sister
[1:21:03] too
[1:21:04] it actually forgets the flesh of the men
[1:21:05] and just focuses glorifying the flesh of
[1:21:07] the sister
[1:21:11] now we don't have time to read these but
[1:21:13] deuteronomy 22 28-30 a man that laid
[1:21:17] with a woman had to marry her in other
[1:21:19] words any man that knew a woman could
[1:21:22] not put her away and marry somebody else
[1:21:24] he instantly had to marry her in other
[1:21:27] words he gave that woman his virgin
[1:21:29] urgency or whatever more
[1:21:31] virginity
[1:21:32] and he had to marry that woman so that
[1:21:34] proves any common jewish man or any
[1:21:37] priest
[1:21:38] the woman they knew the first woman they
[1:21:39] knew they had to marry that person in
[1:21:42] other words god wanted all jewish men
[1:21:44] not just priests and high priests all
[1:21:46] jewish men had to marry the first woman
[1:21:48] that they knew
[1:21:50] it just wasn't priests it was all jewish
[1:21:52] men
[1:21:53] hallelujah that's deuteronomy 22
[1:21:56] 28 through 30. also you see the same
[1:21:59] thing it was death
[1:22:01] to lay with another man's wife or death
[1:22:03] to rape a woman if the man just wanted
[1:22:05] to lay with her then leave he'd be
[1:22:07] stoned
[1:22:09] because god said you gotta
[1:22:11] marry the first one you're with
[1:22:13] deuteronomy 22 verses 22 through 27. i
[1:22:17] challenge anybody read that see if it's
[1:22:18] not right
[1:22:22] and then levitical the high priest
[1:22:23] leviticus 21
[1:22:25] 15 the high priest could not profane
[1:22:27] their seed
[1:22:32] okay so there's four
[1:22:34] does these sound pretty good so far
[1:22:35] sound pretty biblical
[1:22:37] do i have scriptures to back them all up
[1:22:38] yes i do do i have quotes to back them
[1:22:40] up yes i do
[1:22:43] number five
[1:22:45] this is ultimately legalism i'm sorry
[1:22:47] not always some people make this
[1:22:49] legalistic which ultimately glorifies
[1:22:51] the flesh and i already hit on this
[1:22:52] earlier
[1:22:54] so i'm not going to spend much time on
[1:22:55] this i believe this was brother
[1:22:56] branham's opinion it was men not brother
[1:22:58] brand brother man didn't make this a
[1:23:00] legalistic thing men made it a
[1:23:01] legalistic thing after brother man went
[1:23:03] off the scene
[1:23:04] brother bram never preaches after he
[1:23:05] preached at one time he never made a
[1:23:07] legalistic thing
[1:23:13] yeah and i'm i keep getting back to that
[1:23:14] minnesota brother he's the one that's
[1:23:16] broken up marriages
[1:23:18] and then allow people to marry in the
[1:23:20] church he split churches he does all
[1:23:21] kinds of evil things
[1:23:22] he's the one that put on plays he lets
[1:23:24] him wear makeup
[1:23:26] i mean it's just it's awful he's one
[1:23:27] that says you got to contact me before
[1:23:28] you
[1:23:30] purchase the car or do anything at all i
[1:23:32] i choose who you marry it's in america
[1:23:35] and this is his main thing his main
[1:23:37] thing is ministers must marry virgin
[1:23:39] that's his main doctrine
[1:23:40] and he's the only one that's ever tried
[1:23:41] to interrupt the holy spirit preaching
[1:23:43] through me
[1:23:44] in all these years of preaching 17 years
[1:23:46] the only one that would do it
[1:23:50] paul said in galatians 6 13
[1:23:52] men brought in circumcision to keep the
[1:23:54] law that they made glory in your flesh
[1:23:57] and that's exactly what's happened with
[1:23:58] this doctrine not circumcision but
[1:24:00] they're bringing in this doctrine some
[1:24:03] people are not all they're making it
[1:24:04] such a huge issue it glo people they're
[1:24:08] spreading it to try to glory in their
[1:24:10] flesh
[1:24:12] because again it's not fair to the uh
[1:24:15] it's not fair to the sisters they only
[1:24:16] require the brothers to do it what about
[1:24:17] this
[1:24:18] i'm sorry the only cries of the sisters
[1:24:20] would be virgin not the brothers what
[1:24:21] about the brothers
[1:24:23] that proves it's a legalistic idea
[1:24:25] because you don't find it in the word of
[1:24:26] god
[1:24:30] all right sixth and lastly
[1:24:33] to me this is the most beautiful one
[1:24:35] here the sixth reason is that
[1:24:38] the blood of jesus christ washes away
[1:24:41] all sexual sin i've been hitting on this
[1:24:42] earlier for his spiritual bride now look
[1:24:45] at this for a moment how many bride
[1:24:46] members we got here that love jesus
[1:24:48] christ and
[1:24:49] look at this
[1:24:50] the blood of jesus christ has forgiven
[1:24:52] you of any natural physical sexual sin
[1:24:56] and his blood has so washed that away he
[1:24:59] can still call you a spiritual virgin
[1:25:03] and even though you've been handled by a
[1:25:05] man or a woman i'll say it like that for
[1:25:06] all the men watching if you've been
[1:25:08] handled by another man or woman jesus
[1:25:09] christ will still forgive you of that
[1:25:11] spiritually and you'll just be handled
[1:25:13] by him for all eternity
[1:25:16] not only that
[1:25:18] but we've all been handled by a man's
[1:25:20] system
[1:25:22] or the law paul says go to romans 7.
[1:25:24] i'll prove it to you romans 7
[1:25:27] in other words you were all married to
[1:25:30] someone before christ
[1:25:33] either the world or the law
[1:25:36] so in other words everybody's been
[1:25:38] handled spiritually by some man
[1:25:41] a man's system
[1:25:42] or just your own fleshly desires
[1:25:46] but jesus christ forgives your natural
[1:25:49] fornications
[1:25:51] he forgives that still calls you a
[1:25:52] spiritual virgin now you have to there's
[1:25:54] going to be consequences to natural
[1:25:55] sexual sin of course we know that i'm
[1:25:57] not saying jesus
[1:25:59] doesn't allow that of course he allows
[1:26:01] consequences
[1:26:03] but he looks at your soul and he can
[1:26:05] still call you a virgin to him praise
[1:26:07] god oh my that's looking through eternal
[1:26:10] eyes amen
[1:26:12] that's looking through real eyes of love
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:16] you can still look at your soul and say
[1:26:18] you're a virgin to me you've never been
[1:26:20] handled by a man or woman
[1:26:22] oh my
[1:26:27] romans seven one through three
[1:26:30] maokai i get it can you read it for me
[1:26:36] roman okay you're not okay okay i got it
[1:26:38] i just thought you there romans 7 1-3
[1:26:41] know ye not brethren for i speak to them
[1:26:42] that know the law how that the law had
[1:26:44] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[1:26:47] for the woman which hath the husband is
[1:26:48] bound by the law to her husband so long
[1:26:50] as so long as he liveth
[1:26:52] but if the husband be dead she's loosed
[1:26:54] from the law of her husband so then if
[1:26:56] while her husband liveth she'd be
[1:26:57] married to another man she should be
[1:26:59] called an adulteress but if her husband
[1:27:01] be dead she's free from that law so that
[1:27:02] she is no adulteress whether she
[1:27:05] be married to another man now look at
[1:27:06] verse 4 wherefore my brethren ye also
[1:27:09] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:27:11] christ that ye shall be married to
[1:27:15] another
[1:27:17] to him who raised is raised from the
[1:27:19] dead that we should bring forth fruit
[1:27:21] unto god
[1:27:22] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:27:23] motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:27:25] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:27:27] unto death but now we are delivered from
[1:27:29] the law now look there's a law
[1:27:32] that being dead wherein we were held
[1:27:34] that we should serve in the newness of
[1:27:36] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:27:38] letter there it is right there
[1:27:40] we were all handled by some man's system
[1:27:43] we're all married to one
[1:27:44] system either the flesh or the law
[1:27:48] before we came to christ but then our
[1:27:50] first husband died
[1:27:52] even though we were handled right by
[1:27:54] another man system or the law
[1:27:56] rehearsed husband died and then later in
[1:27:58] first corinthians or 2nd corinthians 11
[1:28:00] paul says i want to present you as a
[1:28:03] chaste virgin to jesus christ
[1:28:06] how could god how could paul call the
[1:28:08] corinthian church virgin because they
[1:28:10] were they had adulterers they didn't
[1:28:12] they didn't mourn over sexual sin in
[1:28:13] chapter five of book one how can he do
[1:28:16] that because the blood of jesus christ
[1:28:18] washed over their souls and their souls
[1:28:21] cannot sin they now have a new seed that
[1:28:23] new seed in their soul produces a new
[1:28:25] life and god only looks at that seed
[1:28:29] let's say under our feet
[1:28:31] musician can come
[1:28:35] now that's a short version
[1:28:38] but i've never found anyone who's ever
[1:28:41] able to show me anything different on
[1:28:42] that i say that love i don't say that
[1:28:44] arrogantly i say that humbly
[1:28:46] i just mean it boldly
[1:28:48] i'm open to all challenges i'm open to
[1:28:50] anybody
[1:28:51] all the streamers all the shares
[1:28:52] whatever
[1:28:55] no one's ever been able to show anything
[1:28:56] all they say is i'll take what the
[1:28:57] quotes say but you have quotes on both
[1:28:59] sides
[1:29:00] then you're just cherry-picking how you
[1:29:02] ever how you ever want to act and
[1:29:03] believe
[1:29:04] right
[1:29:06] and what do you do if you say every word
[1:29:08] is infallible what do you do with that i
[1:29:09] don't know what do you do with that
[1:29:11] that's an awful situation you just say i
[1:29:12] believe everywhere on the tape that's
[1:29:14] all i believe
[1:29:15] right
[1:29:16] in that blind spiritual state that many
[1:29:18] people are in
[1:29:19] but how many know that the bible's right
[1:29:21] praise god
[1:29:22] and i don't say this to try to correct
[1:29:24] but god's prophet as far as that way
[1:29:27] it was brother ram's opinion
[1:29:29] and i'm here laying out the true
[1:29:30] doctrine
[1:29:32] about ministers marriage requirements
[1:29:34] and george some people don't remember
[1:29:36] this brother braham hardly slept any
[1:29:38] that night before preaching that sermon
[1:29:40] he was so nervous about preaching that
[1:29:41] sermon you can listen to i listened to
[1:29:43] it on saturday that sermon
[1:29:45] he said i hardly got any sleep he was up
[1:29:47] all night he was under a lot of pressure
[1:29:50] he he said i don't have time to teach
[1:29:53] this doctrine and read all the
[1:29:55] scriptures
[1:29:57] and remember we can't find where jacob
[1:30:00] had at least a dozen wives he swore to
[1:30:02] god only have four
[1:30:06] so it takes a lot of humility it takes a
[1:30:08] lot of prayer
[1:30:09] it takes
[1:30:10] the holy spirit to direct us to the word
[1:30:12] of god
[1:30:14] and have the true teaching on ministers
[1:30:15] marriage requirements
[1:30:17] again i respect both sides
[1:30:20] but i believe the truth is
[1:30:23] ministers must only marry a holy
[1:30:25] ghost-filled woman and have one wife
[1:30:27] praise god
[1:30:28] one living spouse i believe that's
[1:30:30] requirement plus the other 19.
[1:30:32] let's power our heads forward to prayer
[1:30:40] now church i knew this would be a very
[1:30:42] focused subject i knew the sisters maybe
[1:30:43] they wouldn't
[1:30:45] maybe understand this or i should
[1:30:47] understand it but maybe it wouldn't mean
[1:30:48] much to them but i hope the ending meant
[1:30:50] something to everybody and even you
[1:30:52] young malachi i don't even know if it
[1:30:53] meant much to him but the end should
[1:30:55] mean everything to you that the blood of
[1:30:57] jesus christ will call your soul a
[1:30:59] virgin to him
[1:31:01] which means you're totally pure in his
[1:31:03] eyes your soul
[1:31:04] when the holy ghost is living in there
[1:31:07] because god's seed remains inside of you
[1:31:11] and god's seed cannot only want a seed
[1:31:13] inside your soul praise god a seed that
[1:31:17] remains
[1:31:18] and cannot sin that's what i want by
[1:31:20] god's grace
[1:31:22] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:31:23] for tonight lord god
[1:31:25] thank you for the truth of your word
[1:31:26] lord i went fast through it but
[1:31:28] lord i i felt led to do it lord god i've
[1:31:31] had numerous questions about it
[1:31:33] it was all in my mind it's all my heart
[1:31:35] i just feel led to preach it thank you
[1:31:37] god for giving me the grace to do it i
[1:31:39] just pray any sincere heart will ask me
[1:31:42] humble questions in our church or those
[1:31:44] listening in lord god
[1:31:46] we just approach it humbly lord and look
[1:31:48] to the word of god
[1:31:50] and then like the bible says be ready to
[1:31:52] always have an answer
[1:31:54] for those who have a question about the
[1:31:55] hope that's inside you second peter 3 15
[1:31:58] i believe it is
[1:32:00] lord just let your truth prevail in our
[1:32:02] lives that the blood of jesus christ
[1:32:04] separates us from all sin
[1:32:07] that we can rejoice knowing that lord
[1:32:09] you see us as virgin
[1:32:14] lord that you're looking lord for us to
[1:32:16] be ready so you can come to rescue us
[1:32:20] away from the great tribulation period
[1:32:22] which we're honored lord if you do that
[1:32:24] father we to be eternally honored dear
[1:32:25] god
[1:32:26] for the marriage of thy son
[1:32:30] lord i know this sermon will
[1:32:32] be controversial no doubt
[1:32:35] lord i believe it also help many sisters
[1:32:37] and brothers who've been wounded by
[1:32:38] preachers who hold legalistic teachings
[1:32:40] dear god
[1:32:42] like we mentioned at least two cases
[1:32:44] i've seen dear god
[1:32:45] pray your people would be set free
[1:32:47] your people would hold on to the truth
[1:32:49] and the truth would make them free
[1:32:55] father we just worship you tonight we
[1:32:56] thank you god for this opportunity to be
[1:32:57] in your house in jesus christ's name and
[1:33:00] the church said
[1:33:01] amen praise god
[1:33:04] thank you jesus for the blood applied
[1:33:05] can we listen
[1:33:07] that's what i'm thankful i'm thankful
[1:33:08] for that tonight

[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:11] i just say this for the children
[1:45:17] it means
[1:45:18] so much to me the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:21] because i can remember saying cuss words
[1:45:24] i can remember wearing immodest clothes
[1:45:28] i can remember telling people
[1:45:30] i hated them
[1:45:33] i could remember committing all kinds of
[1:45:35] sins and then jesus will come around and
[1:45:37] say you're a virgin
[1:45:39] to me
[1:45:42] church that makes
[1:45:43] children you know that makes the blood
[1:45:45] of jesus christ the most valuable and
[1:45:47] the most precious thing there could be
[1:45:49] in this lifetime
[1:45:50] can everybody say amen to that
[1:45:53] it's such a paradox how can jesus call
[1:45:55] me a virgin
[1:45:57] i like i didn't sin like i didn't do
[1:45:59] that but yet he does that because i have
[1:46:01] a new life inside of me
[1:46:03] i've been given a new start inside of me
[1:46:06] that's the kind of god i want to serve
