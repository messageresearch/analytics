[40:16] great week in the lord
[40:17] thankful for god's mercy uh and his
[40:20] grace
[40:22] i want to uh just have a little visual
[40:24] here acacia so you can switch over here
[40:29] uh we'll look at uh mystery of iniquity
[40:31] again but i just like to
[40:34] um you pull up the three parts of a man
[40:37] here
[40:37] briefly and just use it as an
[40:40] illustration here
[40:42] if we can we'll try to be real careful
[40:44] with the time here by god's grace
[40:48] i forgot to recognize solomon right
[40:50] salmon uh
[40:52] johnny and sarah's nephew let's give him
[40:54] a round of applause god bless you sir
[40:56] [Applause]
[40:58] looks a lot like his dad harry don't he
[41:00] looks and i like it
[41:01] god bless you simon good to see the
[41:03] saints appreciate the sacrifice
[41:06] saints have made pressing out to the
[41:07] house of the lord today
[41:09] you know wednesday by god's grace we
[41:10] started looking at the characteristics
[41:12] of
[41:13] satan and cain and how iniquity started
[41:16] in satan's heart in heaven
[41:18] and then on wednesday we saw how when he
[41:20] came to earth
[41:21] uh that nature uh of course of satan it
[41:25] went into the serpent and then the
[41:27] serpent seed passed
[41:28] into cane and then cain because he had
[41:31] the wrong seed
[41:32] started producing the same
[41:34] characteristics of his father
[41:35] for adam was not his father praise god
[41:38] uh adam was a son of god
[41:40] cain was the son of the wicked one but
[41:43] of course we now know through the flood
[41:45] and everything that that nature has
[41:46] creeped into every human
[41:48] being and that's why god had to send a
[41:50] greater nature
[41:51] praise god on the day of pentecost he
[41:53] sent the divine nature amen
[41:55] down into the soul of man deeper than
[41:57] the flesh
[41:58] where you could feel him on your body
[42:00] deeper than the mind where you would
[42:01] think beautiful thoughts and prophesy
[42:03] and
[42:03] see dreams and visions but down into the
[42:06] soul
[42:06] down into the very nature of the
[42:08] christian amen praise god remember
[42:10] you're
[42:11] directed the nature of your mind is your
[42:14] soul
[42:14] so we want to look at that lord willing
[42:16] today a little bit more by god's grace
[42:18] we saw five characteristics of the
[42:21] mystery of iniquity
[42:23] and so the first one is they go through
[42:25] vain yet beautiful religious acts
[42:28] creating their own traditions and so we
[42:31] want to make sure our it's okay to have
[42:33] traditions
[42:34] the bible says that paul said it's okay
[42:35] to keep traditions as long as they're
[42:37] bible traditions
[42:39] praise god as long as they're as long as
[42:41] they are
[42:42] are are sincere and as long as they're
[42:45] pleasing to the lord there's nothing
[42:46] wrong with having a tradition
[42:47] we know there's christian liberties
[42:49] right uh you can have different
[42:50] liberties paul says there's some people
[42:52] that really honor this day
[42:53] there's some people that really honor
[42:55] that day paul said as long as you've got
[42:57] goodness in your heart as long as you're
[42:59] not causing to stumble
[43:00] he said that's fine go ahead and do that
[43:02] praise god so we are thankful for
[43:04] christian liberties praise god
[43:06] but uh the the the spirit of
[43:09] uh antichrist in the spirit of iniquity
[43:12] develops
[43:13] sinful traditions that break the word
[43:16] and we saw on wednesday that it creeps
[43:19] it slowly creeps into the house
[43:22] it's slow it's a slow thing it's not
[43:24] instant usually
[43:25] it's usually slow one one day uh
[43:28] it gets in a little bit the next day a
[43:30] little more a little more a little more
[43:34] uh like you know i'll just be honest i
[43:36] had a gentleman from overseas text me
[43:37] this week and he was trying to get
[43:39] he he started off by watching uh the
[43:41] evil movies just like rated our movies
[43:44] and uh and then he went to pornography
[43:46] and then he was even
[43:47] uh hiring prostitutes and he's like how
[43:50] do i get rid of this brother jesse pray
[43:51] for me he said
[43:52] he said i know the righteous a prayer of
[43:54] the righteous man availed much
[43:56] and so i was sharing with him how it
[43:58] slowly creeps in
[43:59] it starts with one little mistake and
[44:02] then that
[44:02] if you don't repent of that and clean
[44:04] that up it goes a little further
[44:06] a little deeper a little deeper until
[44:09] it's
[44:09] a total corruption it's like the power
[44:12] of leaven
[44:13] but i thank god that uh the
[44:15] spirit-filled christians life
[44:16] is the opposite its footsteps are
[44:19] possession one step at a time amen
[44:21] one day at a time sweet jesus that's all
[44:23] i'm asking of you
[44:24] praise god it's for each day to grow
[44:27] closer to the lord
[44:28] each day at a time and let holiness
[44:32] uh further take over our houses praise
[44:35] god
[44:36] and secondly workers of iniquity don't
[44:38] abide in the truth
[44:39] they despise the truth as cain left the
[44:43] presence of the lord
[44:44] and john said they went out from us
[44:47] because they're not of us and remember
[44:49] church this all happens here
[44:51] in this in this realm here because
[44:54] remember in your soul
[44:55] you start with a holy desire now i wish
[44:57] i would have put that in there the holy
[44:58] thirst
[44:59] but abraham says every every person
[45:01] starts with a holy thirst and
[45:04] and if they fill their minds and so they
[45:06] fill their spirit minds
[45:08] with with evil thoughts with evil
[45:10] desires
[45:11] if if they keep feeding their mind evil
[45:14] things
[45:14] then they will hush this this holy
[45:17] thirst in the
[45:18] soul and then the soul disbelieves
[45:20] because the soul that sinneth
[45:22] the soul that disbelieveth it shall die
[45:25] and so the mystery of iniquity is is is
[45:28] going through acts religious
[45:29] acts uh but filling the mind with evil
[45:33] thoughts
[45:34] right and then ultimately that hushes
[45:36] the holy thirst where they don't desire
[45:38] for all of god
[45:39] remember church we're not kept outside
[45:41] of the holy spirit
[45:42] the holy the veil's been torn we're
[45:44] invited in praise god
[45:46] i'll say like this there's angels
[45:47] inviting us come in in other words let
[45:50] the
[45:50] be born again let the holy spirit fill
[45:52] your soul
[45:53] let god's nature become your nature
[45:55] praise god
[45:56] the angels of god are trying to usher us
[45:58] into the presence of god
[46:00] amen and yet the antichrist spirit will
[46:03] deny that
[46:05] and it will create its own traditions
[46:07] and then it will lead the presence of
[46:09] god
[46:10] third they deny the full power of the
[46:12] holy spirit they have power for
[46:14] miracles right they have power for
[46:15] prophesying powerful anointings
[46:18] but it's only temporary it's not
[46:20] permanent
[46:21] and then we saw forth that satan's
[46:23] children just lie all the time
[46:24] they lie they lie in their doctrine they
[46:27] lie in their
[46:28] their daily lives they lie all the time
[46:30] in fact i was listening to brother
[46:31] peregrine's testimony brother jose and
[46:33] he was talking about these well-known
[46:34] ministers that were wrong with brother
[46:36] branham are not going to name their
[46:37] names
[46:37] because it might really it might really
[46:39] stumble people is that what you were
[46:41] thinking
[46:44] praise god amen men that were very close
[46:47] to brother branham
[46:48] and years after brother and passed they
[46:50] would go talk and they would they would
[46:52] assemble together and they and they
[46:54] would get to talking about different
[46:56] doctrines and the brothers some of them
[46:58] that were very close to brother branham
[46:59] would admit to hating other preachers in
[47:01] the message
[47:02] now isn't that a sad thing when we when
[47:05] we think we're so smarter
[47:06] we think we've got so much revelation
[47:08] that we can start hating other people
[47:10] the only thing we should hate is sin
[47:13] praise god and a lot of that church is
[47:16] in your flesh it's in your members
[47:19] there's a part of us that we hate a part
[47:21] of us amen not the soul
[47:23] but the flesh amen but see this is how
[47:26] people can be so close to brother
[47:28] abraham
[47:28] now look they can l they live so holy
[47:30] church because they know the man of god
[47:33] is holy
[47:33] but when he goes off the steam they
[47:35] backslide
[47:37] because their holiness never was their
[47:38] own it was somebody else's
[47:40] but i don't want to know jesus through
[47:42] somebody else i want to know of myself
[47:44] amen
[47:45] i want to know him in the power of his
[47:48] resurrection
[47:49] so i can see his life resurrected living
[47:51] in me
[47:52] amen and that's when it comes down to
[47:55] the life these people were anointed
[47:57] uh in brotherhood's time they respected
[47:58] brother brahm but the life never got
[48:00] into them
[48:02] and so they hate and you know what i'm
[48:04] talking about
[48:05] they would hate and they'd try to get a
[48:06] repent these brothers wouldn't even
[48:07] repent they said well that's how brother
[48:09] graham said i was
[48:10] that doesn't mean brotherhood never said
[48:11] it's okay to remain in sin
[48:13] praise god so see they have all these
[48:15] excuses and i'm not saying everybody
[48:17] that's just a few
[48:18] but see they lie they lie and they hate
[48:21] they're full of hatred
[48:24] see because they they hush this holy
[48:26] thirst they won't let god
[48:27] into the very depths of their being and
[48:30] so they backslide here more and more and
[48:32] more
[48:32] all the time in their minds they think
[48:34] that wrong thoughts
[48:35] they say the wrong words and then they
[48:38] persecute and kill the righteous
[48:40] we know like lucifer starting wars and
[48:43] kane the first murderer
[48:44] and jesus said if you're even angry with
[48:46] somebody without a cause you're in
[48:48] danger of hell fire
[48:51] now the sixth attribute the last one i
[48:53] have at least lord willing in the book
[48:54] here
[48:55] uh will be satan's seed have sorrow
[48:58] over their sins but they never repent
[49:00] now that's worldly sorrow i've preached
[49:02] that to you many times
[49:03] but let me just go over briefly
[49:05] everybody
[49:06] feels bad when they sin right
[49:09] and when and when a worker of iniquity
[49:12] sins they feel bad but their life never
[49:14] changes see how it's all about the life
[49:16] amen
[49:17] it's all about the life of the seed of
[49:19] god within us amen
[49:21] they don't have the life they never
[49:23] change their behavior
[49:25] now cain doesn't have a record of godly
[49:27] sorrow about murdering abel
[49:29] you know but you know what he has he has
[49:31] sorrow because god cursed him from the
[49:33] earth
[49:34] isn't that awful first listen to this i
[49:36] wrote this i felt led of the holy spirit
[49:38] god sentenced him to become a fugitive
[49:40] in a vagabond
[49:41] and look the pitiful lying wretched cane
[49:45] he's only sorry for himself
[49:48] look think about that he just killed his
[49:50] brother and he's not sorry for his
[49:52] brother
[49:53] he's sorry about the punishment for
[49:55] himself
[49:57] that's serpentine right he's complaining
[50:00] about his punishment
[50:01] no remorse for his dead brother and so
[50:04] see church serpents eat our workers of
[50:06] nuclear
[50:06] they only care about themselves
[50:10] now jose interesting he he could cry his
[50:13] own voice in my he said my
[50:15] uh my punishment's greater than i can
[50:17] bear but he couldn't hear the blood of
[50:19] his brother crying from the ground amen
[50:21] oh god now church i'll say like this
[50:24] there's times i pray
[50:25] and i feel like i can hear the the blood
[50:28] of these innocent children that were
[50:30] aborted it feels like i can feed them
[50:32] i can hear their voices crying out to
[50:34] heaven this nation's under judgment
[50:36] and god help us just to pray and save as
[50:39] many as we can in this wicked age
[50:42] 46 million since 1964 46 million
[50:46] uh blood voices crying up to god for
[50:49] vengeance
[50:50] upon this earth oh my
[50:54] all he can do is think about himself
[50:58] he has emotional pain but it never
[51:02] he has pain here but it never breaks
[51:04] down to where he would change his
[51:05] desires
[51:07] see see souls that choose hell
[51:10] are worthy of it i hate to say that but
[51:13] it's because they refuse to respond to
[51:15] their sorrow
[51:16] see sorrow and pain is a good thing i
[51:19] was listening to a testimony
[51:21] from a preacher and he was saying he met
[51:23] a woman whose daughter was born and she
[51:25] couldn't feel pain
[51:28] so she would touch hot stoves it would
[51:30] burn her skin but she couldn't feel it
[51:33] and it broke the mother's heart she
[51:35] would touch
[51:36] you know like needles and bleed and
[51:38] wouldn't feel it
[51:40] and the the preacher was making a point
[51:42] he was saying the mother
[51:43] prays now she gets injured right she got
[51:46] injured and her body's injured but she
[51:47] can't feel it
[51:48] and the mother he's making the point the
[51:50] mother is praying
[51:52] god help my daughter to feel pain
[51:55] ah in church god
[51:58] thank god that god allows us to feel
[52:00] pain praise god
[52:02] see potentially that little girl can
[52:04] lose her life because she doesn't feel
[52:06] pain
[52:07] thank god for pain amen thank god for
[52:10] conviction is what i'm saying amen
[52:12] thank god that we feel bad when we sin
[52:14] because that's the way we rejoice
[52:16] in mercy and forgiveness amen
[52:20] that mother praise god help my daughter
[52:22] to feel pain
[52:24] and that's my prayer today isn't it
[52:25] yours amen god help me to feel the pain
[52:28] if i hurt my brother
[52:29] if i hurt my sister god help me to feel
[52:31] that so i can make it right
[52:34] and not cause people pray but cause of
[52:36] joy praise god
[52:39] pain is a good thing sorrow here
[52:43] is a good thing that's right church
[52:48] but yet the serpents see they hate
[52:49] holiness they fight against it
[52:51] they blaspheme it and god will strive
[52:53] he'll be patient he'll send them pain
[52:55] pain pain to finally he knows when they
[52:58] sell their souls to the devil which is
[53:00] called the reprobate mind
[53:02] and the bible says god shall send them a
[53:04] strong delusion to believe a lie
[53:05] that they all might be damned who
[53:07] believe not the truth but add pleasure
[53:09] in unrighteousness we should thank god
[53:12] for pain
[53:13] we should thank god when we're ashamed
[53:15] of ourselves
[53:16] praise god the bible says we can hate
[53:20] our sin and jude 1 23 hating even the
[53:23] garment
[53:24] spotted by the flesh jude is not talking
[53:26] about your clothes getting a stain of
[53:28] barbecue sauce on it that's not what
[53:30] he's talking about
[53:31] he's talking about your spiritual uh
[53:33] your spiritual character
[53:34] getting a stain of guilt on it
[53:38] and he's talking about we should hate
[53:39] the garment we should hate our spiritual
[53:41] state
[53:42] that's spotted by the sins of our flesh
[53:45] amen
[53:47] yes our souls if we're born again our
[53:49] souls never sin
[53:50] but paul said everybody but jude says
[53:52] here your spirit in your mind
[53:54] your mind gets defiled in church if you
[53:56] lose that battle you
[53:57] your soul can't do much if your spirit's
[53:59] not winning the battle praise god
[54:02] sometimes you wonder where's my
[54:04] spiritual armor how come i'm not winning
[54:05] the victories
[54:06] because the soul the life of the soul
[54:08] has to come out to the mind
[54:10] right and it's gotta we gotta have full
[54:12] confidence in our mind that god's gonna
[54:13] hear me
[54:14] because i've confessed my sins i've
[54:16] washed my garments white
[54:18] and i can have confidence that god will
[54:19] hear my prayer
[54:21] yes it's the garment spotted by the
[54:24] flesh
[54:25] that human mind now when i preach it i
[54:29] said how
[54:30] sinners have worldly sorrow they have
[54:33] emotion they feel awful for their sins
[54:36] but they don't bring forth fruits of
[54:37] repentance
[54:40] praise god can you look at your life and
[54:43] see fruits of repentance
[54:45] so like if if a friend was causing you
[54:47] to struggle did you see a repentance
[54:49] where you confess your sin or maybe you
[54:51] separated yourself from your friend
[54:54] or can you see if you offended a friend
[54:56] that you had enough fruit to go back and
[54:58] say
[54:58] i'm sorry that's fruit
[55:02] let me understand what i'm talking about
[55:03] that's real fruit that proves
[55:05] you are really sorry that proves you
[55:08] really felt the sorrow
[55:10] of how that that that sin hurts the
[55:12] heart of god
[55:14] yes that's right and so church that's
[55:18] what the
[55:18] the the mystery of iniquity they won't
[55:20] have the fruits of repentance it's never
[55:23] visible in their life
[55:25] now they get close right because you can
[55:28] you can be very close
[55:29] pharaoh and here's the examples pharaoh
[55:31] admitted he sinned against the lord on
[55:33] multiple occasions
[55:34] and he even asked moses to bless him oh
[55:37] everybody wants to be blessed right but
[55:38] they don't want to
[55:39] live the life balaam admitted to the
[55:41] angel
[55:42] that he was sinning when he when the uh
[55:44] he met him there and the donkey kicked
[55:46] him remember
[55:47] he admitted it but the angel still let
[55:49] him go now balaam
[55:50] really would have been sincere he would
[55:52] have said no i realize i'm wrong i'm
[55:53] going to go back
[55:55] but see he wanted to go so the angel let
[55:58] him go
[56:01] aiken acknowledged his sin but the
[56:03] fierce anger of god
[56:05] caused him to be stoned and burnt by
[56:06] israel king saul admitted his sins of
[56:09] rebellion and stubbornness
[56:10] against god to the prophet samuel but
[56:12] then he spent years hunting david's life
[56:16] and finally repented right before he
[56:17] died ahab is one of the most
[56:20] amazing examples ahab repented and he
[56:23] and
[56:23] god told elijah go look how he humbles
[56:25] himself
[56:26] he fasts and rents his clothes now
[56:28] church when was the last time
[56:30] you know when you fasted because of your
[56:32] sin
[56:33] when was the last time you said god i'm
[56:35] not going to eat because i
[56:37] i don't want to sit in this this manner
[56:38] again
[56:40] that's that's real sincerity that's real
[56:43] sincerity
[56:44] now we don't have to fast like we're not
[56:46] catholics right
[56:47] we don't have to fast to prove it with
[56:49] our penance or anything like that
[56:51] but that i'm trying to show you the
[56:53] level of sincerity
[56:55] that ultimately a serpent seed went
[56:58] but he never he never obeyed in holiness
[57:02] it was just a short temporary sort of
[57:05] victory it wasn't a permanent victory
[57:09] because remember later just a few
[57:11] chapters after that
[57:13] makaya comes back and uh
[57:16] remember jehoshaphat's there and he says
[57:18] shall we go up to raymond gilead
[57:20] and jehoshaphat's like you got 400
[57:22] prophets you got anybody else
[57:24] see he could feel that that this this
[57:26] crowd is wrong
[57:28] you ever felt that way you go to certain
[57:29] churches i know this crowd is wrong
[57:32] they might look happy they might look
[57:33] excited but i know they're wrong
[57:36] they got the lying spirit on them
[57:40] remember he says he said you got anybody
[57:42] else he's got yeah
[57:43] i've got one more holy roller preacher
[57:45] but i hate him
[57:47] a man that was just fasting sorrowful
[57:50] for his sins a murdering
[57:51] letting jezebel murder these problems he
[57:53] was fasting and
[57:54] upset and then a few if you see a few
[57:57] weeks later months later whatever years
[57:59] later
[57:59] he's back to hating righteous people
[58:01] again
[58:03] oh my
[58:06] how many are falling in love with your
[58:08] enemies we got anybody out there
[58:10] falling in love with your enemies as
[58:11] time goes on
[58:13] are you making more friends or more
[58:14] enemies church which one are you making
[58:18] now one way you might be making more
[58:19] enemies but you still should love them
[58:22] right i mean
[58:26] but look at this periods of real
[58:29] devotion sister look at that sister
[58:30] wendy
[58:32] of really fasting and asking god
[58:34] humility brother
[58:35] it real humility but then hating the
[58:37] word of god later
[58:39] righteousness that's iniquity he knew
[58:42] better because he fasted he knew it was
[58:43] wrong
[58:44] he bastard humming himself but now he's
[58:45] not humbling himself now he's exalting
[58:47] himself in pride
[58:49] like he's got a he knows more about it
[58:50] than a prophet the prophet knew more
[58:53] about it because he had visions
[58:55] amen god showed him the throne of god
[58:57] amen
[58:58] and the lying spirit come up to deceive
[59:00] ahab he had
[59:01] greater understanding now
[59:05] let me uh make sure i hit this real
[59:08] quick
[59:10] uh one of those six attributes is they
[59:13] leave them the ministry of god the
[59:14] fightful ministry
[59:16] okay so let me pull this up i've never
[59:18] seen this quote in this way before i
[59:20] think the holy spirit revealed to me
[59:21] this week here now
[59:22] just a simple thing uh my next video
[59:24] will be about uh
[59:25] the tape boys are not in the fivefold
[59:27] ministry i'm gonna keep blasting that
[59:30] that it's wrong
[59:33] it's wrong i know i laugh but it is so
[59:36] wrong
[59:38] brother man said you can't change one
[59:39] word
[59:41] you can't change one word now uh
[59:46] but here's where my brother ram says let
[59:48] me turn the sideways there we go that's
[59:49] better
[59:50] and then it skips down the silly thing
[59:53] i don't like evernote very much
[59:56] sometimes
[59:57] okay brother ram says he said some in
[1:00:00] the church teachers apostles prophets
[1:00:02] healings workers and miracles all these
[1:00:03] things are sent to church do you believe
[1:00:04] that i never did say
[1:00:06] i never did say where they'd be set out
[1:00:08] of the church he said them
[1:00:09] in the church for the perfecting of the
[1:00:11] church and to be in the church
[1:00:13] until he comes again remember church
[1:00:16] you have to take all these quotes back
[1:00:18] to where the bible
[1:00:20] where does the bible say pastors need to
[1:00:22] stop preaching and press play
[1:00:24] can somebody ever show me that can
[1:00:26] anybody
[1:00:27] no you'll never be able to find it and
[1:00:30] so when you look at the quotes overall
[1:00:32] you can see how brother branham was a
[1:00:34] word prophet and he told us to stay with
[1:00:36] the word
[1:00:37] they asked brother bran point blank are
[1:00:39] you the only preacher he said no we need
[1:00:41] all of god's men that are called to
[1:00:42] preach the gospel
[1:00:45] now there's lots of quotes here i'm
[1:00:46] going to skip past some of these brother
[1:00:48] bran's vision for the
[1:00:48] future and i look what he says and
[1:00:50] taking sides with jesus he's talking to
[1:00:52] brother christ brother junior jackson
[1:00:54] he said you're young man i'm getting old
[1:00:55] brother neville's getting old we're
[1:00:56] middle-aged men if time rolls on
[1:00:58] we're going to walk off the scene after
[1:01:00] a while and you've got to press
[1:01:01] play is that what he said
[1:01:05] no he said you've got to fill our shoes
[1:01:08] praise god he said go out there press
[1:01:11] play
[1:01:13] church the meaning of preach means to
[1:01:16] publish
[1:01:17] the news to publish with your voice
[1:01:21] what's already happened
[1:01:22] brother then jesus christ has raised
[1:01:24] from the dead amen
[1:01:26] and he's here in the power of his holy
[1:01:28] spirit to minister to all those who love
[1:01:31] him amen
[1:01:33] publishing with your voice
[1:01:36] and one of the points i'm going to make
[1:01:37] in that video lord willing if the lord
[1:01:38] will help me
[1:01:39] the bible said how beautiful are the
[1:01:41] feet of him who bring the good news
[1:01:43] and publish the gospel of peace since
[1:01:45] when does a cell phone
[1:01:47] or a tape player have feet on it
[1:01:51] do they have features does the tape
[1:01:53] player have feet no
[1:01:55] a preacher's got to have his own voice
[1:01:57] he's got to be living
[1:01:58] and he's got to have feet praise god and
[1:02:01] how beautiful these are now church they
[1:02:03] don't look very beautiful to me there i
[1:02:04] got new shoes on but they're
[1:02:06] they're not very that beautiful as far
[1:02:07] as my feet you should see my toenails
[1:02:09] hold on let's not go there
[1:02:12] but the bible says look at look at the
[1:02:14] one look who's willing to sacrifice
[1:02:18] john wesley traveled 40 000 miles a year
[1:02:21] on horseback amen
[1:02:23] preaching the gospel how beautiful are
[1:02:25] the feet of those who preach
[1:02:26] and proclaim god's good news to this
[1:02:29] generation
[1:02:30] that all they see is bad news but christ
[1:02:32] is good news how beautiful are those
[1:02:35] feet
[1:02:36] that will publish peace
[1:02:41] it's god's system
[1:02:45] when my days is finished i'm done best
[1:02:47] if i be god's servant god will raise him
[1:02:49] up another tape
[1:02:50] in that day when i'm gone
[1:02:55] so there's no need of me sitting around
[1:02:56] here in my theology
[1:02:59] it's me to live the life that i have
[1:03:00] wait on god for the next generation to
[1:03:02] come
[1:03:02] he will have a tape there when that
[1:03:05] generation comes up isn't it ridiculous
[1:03:07] church
[1:03:08] and yet millions church millions of
[1:03:10] people are swayed by that
[1:03:12] what is it brother jose it's the mystery
[1:03:13] of iniquity
[1:03:15] one word one word one word
[1:03:18] now watch there's a lot of there's a
[1:03:20] real there's a lot of people in there
[1:03:21] but if they've got the holy spirit
[1:03:23] god will guide them out of that
[1:03:26] because it breaks the word it exalts a
[1:03:29] man uh
[1:03:30] there i hate to say like this but
[1:03:31] they're letting dead a dead man preach
[1:03:33] and they they act like he's alive he is
[1:03:37] alive in the other dimension but not
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:40] and god he said god told joshua moses my
[1:03:44] servant is dead
[1:03:45] it's your turn amen you preach you lead
[1:03:48] him in there amen
[1:03:49] my servant brother bran was dead but now
[1:03:52] christ is in the fullness of the bird
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:57] it's iniquity get off on one word just
[1:03:59] get them off on one word
[1:04:00] and then there'll be a snowball effect
[1:04:02] all right
[1:04:04] now there's so many quotes like this but
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] bifold ministry for the perfecting of
[1:04:09] the church there's five offices
[1:04:12] he names the five gifts but they're all

[1:04:18] little phone line

[1:07:33] offices what is that that's god's dress
[1:07:35] where

[1:07:42] any
[1:07:43] they're denying the prophet office and
[1:07:46] teacher
[1:07:47] then it's not god's dressing

[1:07:59] clothing
[1:08:00] oh i'm so glad i found this quote watch
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:03] watch that fellow beware of him
[1:08:07] everybody like bows down to
[1:08:08] jeffersonville right
[1:08:10] they bow down you should hear some of
[1:08:14] the things they say
[1:08:15] every word is infallible every words
[1:08:17] thus saith the lord
[1:08:20] i don't worship brother branham but i
[1:08:21] worship the god in him now when did god
[1:08:23] ever tell us to do that
[1:08:24] when did paul ever say worship the god
[1:08:27] that's in me when did paul ever say that
[1:08:31] when did brother branham ever say that
[1:08:33] all of you stand and worship the god
[1:08:34] that's in me that's idolatry
[1:08:38] they say that all the time i just heard
[1:08:39] of this week somebody sent me a video
[1:08:41] of the leadership there saying that
[1:08:43] that's that's not it
[1:08:45] that's not what we do we worship the god
[1:08:47] that's in all of us amen
[1:08:49] the god that's in us the god that's with
[1:08:51] us the god that's above us
[1:08:53] the god who goes before us the god who
[1:08:54] goes behind us we worship the god who is
[1:08:57] unlimited amen
[1:09:00] but see they want to put all of god in
[1:09:01] brother ham in fact i saw i heard
[1:09:02] another idolatrous thing this week
[1:09:04] where the leadership said uh brother
[1:09:07] branham was exactly like jesus christ
[1:09:09] except the corporate body
[1:09:11] that's paganism right
[1:09:14] because jesus had a perfect mind brother
[1:09:16] vayne brother branham did not
[1:09:18] right you got three parts body spirit
[1:09:21] soul
[1:09:23] so they're saying brother branham has
[1:09:25] jesus mind
[1:09:26] fully fully and fully jesus's soul i'm
[1:09:29] sorry
[1:09:30] that's blasphemy that's my humble
[1:09:32] opinion i'm not saying thus saith the
[1:09:33] lord
[1:09:34] that's my humble opinion
[1:09:38] and that's the leadership there that's
[1:09:39] the family
[1:09:41] and you should see the people i can show
[1:09:42] you the video after but i'm trying to
[1:09:44] show you after service but
[1:09:46] i can show it to you everything they're
[1:09:47] shaking their heads like this
[1:09:48] everybody's shouting screaming praise
[1:09:50] the lord that's nonsense
[1:09:51] we should we only shout and scream for
[1:09:53] jesus christ
[1:09:55] he's the one amen he's the one that we
[1:09:57] give all worship honor he's the only one
[1:09:59] that can perfect us amen
[1:10:03] remember though that's god god's hiding
[1:10:04] behind this dress work
[1:10:09] now here's the quote i want to get to
[1:10:12] everybody look at this here
[1:10:13] this is in questions answers part 2 64.
[1:10:16] let me know there's four parts right so
[1:10:17] the questions answered 64.
[1:10:19] so in the second part brother man said
[1:10:20] the bride's elected of god the church
[1:10:22] goes through
[1:10:23] whosoever will don't come but the bride
[1:10:25] is the elected of god
[1:10:26] there's five offices now it goes through
[1:10:28] the offices now i'm skipping down god
[1:10:29] did that
[1:10:30] man has deacons so forth everything but
[1:10:32] god said in the church for the
[1:10:33] perfecting of the church can't divide it
[1:10:37] okay now how many remember the quotes i
[1:10:38] read earlier the the church is perfected
[1:10:40] through the five full ministry but it's
[1:10:42] christ in the five full ministry
[1:10:44] it's not me i can't i can't perfect you
[1:10:46] i can't do anything i can't help anybody
[1:10:48] only christ can help somebody now here's
[1:10:50] a quote where now
[1:10:51] uh the leadership will say uh we don't
[1:10:54] need the fivefold ministry to perfect us
[1:10:56] but watch the quote closely
[1:10:59] remember one week before he said we're
[1:11:01] perfected by the five-fold ministry
[1:11:03] a week later a person that he already
[1:11:06] knows from oregon
[1:11:08] says ephesians 4 do we get the
[1:11:12] perfecting the saints through the tapes
[1:11:13] or should we be here where the gifts of
[1:11:14] the spirit are operating
[1:11:16] and different places offices of the
[1:11:18] church to help us now this person from
[1:11:20] oregon
[1:11:21] i believe i know who it is so brother
[1:11:22] man knows this person
[1:11:25] see it's oh yes i certainly do okay your
[1:11:26] boy the person's here i know you're not
[1:11:28] it might have been last sunday your son
[1:11:31] flies conservations he knows a lot about
[1:11:33] him
[1:11:34] he's the one that invited me over to go
[1:11:35] elk hunting with your brother in oregon
[1:11:37] this is that's right now i know the
[1:11:39] person in my letter and so
[1:11:40] no they want to come to the church
[1:11:43] for the for the perfecting so look at
[1:11:46] brother man a week before
[1:11:47] he said perfection is through the
[1:11:49] fivefold ministry but now a certain
[1:11:51] family
[1:11:52] wants to move to jeffersonville to be
[1:11:55] perfected
[1:11:55] in jeffersonville that that'd be like
[1:11:58] saying we all need to move to
[1:12:00] jeffersonville so we can be perfected
[1:12:01] by that part of the five full ministry
[1:12:04] and broadband says
[1:12:05] no they want to come here for the
[1:12:06] perfecting he said that's we get
[1:12:08] fellowship with uh
[1:12:09] one another here at the church but the
[1:12:11] perfecting because it comes between
[1:12:13] us and god so see these are people
[1:12:16] brother amen they're trying to worship
[1:12:18] brother brown
[1:12:19] they're trying to just think well i can
[1:12:20] only get perfected if i go to
[1:12:22] jeffersonville
[1:12:24] the blood of christ is what perfects us
[1:12:27] in the holy spirit
[1:12:29] so see the leadership in jeffersonville
[1:12:30] will take this and say oh see we don't
[1:12:32] need the fivefold ministry but man says
[1:12:33] the perfection doesn't come
[1:12:35] through the fivefold ministry yeah but
[1:12:37] he did a week earlier
[1:12:40] so if this seems like a contradiction
[1:12:41] you've got to dig a little deeper
[1:12:44] and that's where you do it he says they
[1:12:45] want to come here they thought
[1:12:47] coming to jeffersonville would perfect
[1:12:49] them but he brother has to take it off
[1:12:51] and say it's not coming to the physical
[1:12:52] building
[1:12:53] it's coming to hear the preaching and
[1:12:55] then that will perfect you
[1:12:56] between you and god alone
[1:13:00] so see how he's see how church he's
[1:13:02] discerning spirits
[1:13:03] for all these years he say the fivefold
[1:13:05] ministry perfects the fivefold ministry
[1:13:07] perfects
[1:13:07] one person says we've got to come to
[1:13:09] jeffersonville to be perfected he said
[1:13:10] no
[1:13:10] it's between you and christ see the
[1:13:13] balance there everyone understand
[1:13:15] see this will stop this will stumble
[1:13:17] people because they don't read the other
[1:13:19] quotes
[1:13:20] oh forgive me what happened
[1:13:24] and one thing i want you to know i put
[1:13:25] it up there brother abraham never said
[1:13:27] perfection comes through the tapes only
[1:13:30] they asked him does it come to the tapes
[1:13:33] does it come through
[1:13:34] coming to jeffersonville he says it's
[1:13:35] between you and christ and the blood of
[1:13:37] christ
[1:13:38] amen thank the lord for that hallelujah
[1:13:43] and remember brother i'm never said
[1:13:44] rapturing faith is on the tapes he said
[1:13:46] rapturing faith is a ladder rain
[1:13:49] but do we listen to tapes absolutely
[1:13:50] that's where we get our inspiration from
[1:13:52] all right i got about 10 minutes here so
[1:13:53] let me jump back here that's where i
[1:13:55] left off in my studies
[1:13:59] is that okay by god's grace you would
[1:14:01] you'd be surprised
[1:14:03] one quote can cause a person who has an
[1:14:05] antichrist spirit on them
[1:14:06] to reject all the other quotes and just
[1:14:08] hang their soul on this one quote
[1:14:11] that shows it's the wrong spirit because
[1:14:13] the bible said if you've got the holy
[1:14:14] spirit you'll search the scriptures
[1:14:16] daily
[1:14:16] now this ain't a bible but you'd search
[1:14:18] the scriptures daily whether those
[1:14:20] things are right
[1:14:22] that means brother johnny i preach on
[1:14:23] sunday it's your job my job to go read
[1:14:25] the bible on monday
[1:14:28] it's all your jobs brothers sisters it's
[1:14:30] all your jobs
[1:14:31] search the scriptures daily christ is
[1:14:34] going to perfect you
[1:14:35] if you accept christ preaching on the
[1:14:37] weekends amen
[1:14:39] if you if you accept this week as
[1:14:40] preaching on the weekends and wednesday
[1:14:42] and then you're studying all through the
[1:14:43] week oh you're going to grow up into a
[1:14:45] real creature in christ jesus
[1:14:47] a new creation in christ because it's an
[1:14:50] everyday walk with the lord
[1:14:54] kind of like with brother amen and i on
[1:14:57] wednesday i had two songs i wanted to
[1:14:58] sing
[1:14:59] and i didn't tell brother amen he sang
[1:15:01] one of them
[1:15:03] and i didn't even ask him during the
[1:15:04] song service and then i was saying then
[1:15:06] he sang the second one at the end of the
[1:15:07] service
[1:15:08] and those the very ones i had written
[1:15:10] down on my sheet of i want to sing those
[1:15:12] i didn't tell them
[1:15:12] and probably said see the holy spirit
[1:15:14] will get into the psalm service
[1:15:16] and vindicate the preaching by the song
[1:15:18] service or vice versa
[1:15:21] amen see it it's what it's supposed to
[1:15:24] be a unity
[1:15:26] the holy spirit dealing through the
[1:15:27] songs dealing through the word
[1:15:30] dealing with our hearts to meet our
[1:15:31] needs that we need
[1:15:34] praise god so i hope that was i just
[1:15:37] felt led to stop
[1:15:38] and go over there now one more point
[1:15:42] jesus in the parable church of the
[1:15:45] the wedding garment je the king comes
[1:15:47] down to the banquet
[1:15:49] right before the rapture and so the holy
[1:15:52] spirit is going to come down in the
[1:15:53] latter rain right before the rapture
[1:15:55] and go through and take out all the
[1:15:58] foolish virgins out of the church
[1:15:59] that don't have the holy ghost praise
[1:16:02] god
[1:16:02] i mean that's what i believe that's part
[1:16:04] of the latter reign the holy spirit has
[1:16:06] to make one more trip
[1:16:07] he's got to make sure okay sealed sealed
[1:16:09] sealed
[1:16:10] sealed sealed sealed oh you're missing
[1:16:12] the baptism the holy ghost notice i
[1:16:14] didn't point any of you guys did you
[1:16:15] know what i'm saying
[1:16:17] sealed sealed sealed not sealed
[1:16:20] or not sealed you see him in there
[1:16:25] he's got to come down one more time amen
[1:16:27] glory
[1:16:28] the king himself brother amen the holy
[1:16:31] spirit himself has got to come down one
[1:16:33] more time and you got to separate those
[1:16:35] who have
[1:16:36] the garment from those who don't i want
[1:16:38] to be one of those who have the wedding
[1:16:39] garment on praise god
[1:16:41] i've got a testimony i can speak my
[1:16:43] testimony with my mouth
[1:16:44] i've been saved i've been satisfied i've
[1:16:47] been filled with the holy ghost
[1:16:48] thank god for the wedding garbage
[1:16:56] see even christ will come down and he'll
[1:16:58] separate even though they're not a
[1:17:00] even though the man without the wedding
[1:17:01] garment wasn't a worker of iniquity he
[1:17:04] wasn't born again so he still has to
[1:17:05] separate that
[1:17:06] desire that person who didn't desire to
[1:17:08] be born again he still got to separate
[1:17:10] them from the church
[1:17:16] now
[1:17:19] just got a few minutes here let me let
[1:17:21] me close with this thought here
[1:17:24] now let's just go back here i just want
[1:17:25] to briefly go over this again
[1:17:27] how does iniquity originate
[1:17:30] so in the book i'm going to call how
[1:17:31] iniquity originates in
[1:17:33] and fills the human mind
[1:17:37] now most of us know what we're talking
[1:17:38] about here iniquity originates in the
[1:17:40] human spirit right because we start with
[1:17:42] the holy thirst here
[1:17:44] but satan starts working on this to
[1:17:46] tempt us here in this realm of the human
[1:17:48] spirit right
[1:17:48] the mind he has full access to the body
[1:17:51] and mind as long as god allows it
[1:17:53] but thank god god has to allow it it'll
[1:17:55] never give us a battle we can't handle
[1:18:00] see everybody begins with that holy
[1:18:01] thirst
[1:18:04] and then jesus describes it in luke 12
[1:18:07] we're not going to read it but we read
[1:18:08] it recently
[1:18:09] the rich man who desired to build his
[1:18:11] new barns
[1:18:12] he silenced his own souls thirst for god
[1:18:17] he said soul that has much goods laid up
[1:18:20] for many years take your eaves
[1:18:22] eat drink and be merry he said stop
[1:18:24] thirsting for god settle down
[1:18:26] just enjoy the pleasures of this life
[1:18:29] instead of preparing for the next life
[1:18:34] in his mind he got so preoccupied with
[1:18:36] his architectural drawing of his new
[1:18:38] farm buildings and his his grain bins
[1:18:42] ah brother he could see it he drew it
[1:18:44] out on one of those cab programs those
[1:18:46] computer cad programs
[1:18:48] he had a 3d printer print off a little
[1:18:51] copy of him
[1:18:52] oh guys look at this look here's there's
[1:18:54] my barn for my
[1:18:55] my seeds and here's this here's my dried
[1:18:58] fruits and
[1:18:58] here's my dried meat and whatever he had
[1:19:00] i don't know what else he had
[1:19:02] but he was so consumed with with his
[1:19:04] fleshly needs
[1:19:06] he told his soul stop thirsting for god
[1:19:08] when jesus said you ought to sell
[1:19:10] your goods and give them to the poor and
[1:19:12] come follow me and then you'll have
[1:19:14] treasures in heaven
[1:19:17] see told his soul stop trying to have
[1:19:19] treasures in heaven
[1:19:21] lay up treasures on this earth progress
[1:19:24] that was the same man as rich young
[1:19:25] ruler
[1:19:27] so that's a concrete example see that's
[1:19:30] where iniquity filled his mind and jesus
[1:19:32] said you fool
[1:19:33] your soul is going to be demanded back
[1:19:35] this very night
[1:19:37] he let all these thoughts come in and no
[1:19:39] we don't we don't see any adultery we
[1:19:40] don't see any murder
[1:19:42] just love of money just love of the
[1:19:45] world
[1:19:46] oh big barns financial bank accounts we
[1:19:49] i mean
[1:19:49] we all need savings but this guy was
[1:19:51] going way above and beyond church
[1:19:52] this guy was going for more than one
[1:19:54] month savings right or a thousand
[1:19:56] dollars in the bank account he's talking
[1:19:57] about
[1:19:58] years and decades and decades of money
[1:19:59] he'd probably never be able to spend
[1:20:01] that's why jesus says fool you should
[1:20:04] have given some of this to the poor
[1:20:09] so in his mind it was all about him just
[1:20:11] like judas
[1:20:12] i'm sorry just like cocaine it's all
[1:20:14] about him
[1:20:15] his life was all about himself instead
[1:20:18] of helping other people
[1:20:19] and church please sometimes i ask some
[1:20:21] of you this face to face but please
[1:20:23] if i can help you in any way financially
[1:20:25] if i can help you with any spiritual
[1:20:26] blessing or prayer or bible study
[1:20:28] please let me know i'm just begging
[1:20:30] everybody now if i can help you
[1:20:33] help me to know so i can help you if the
[1:20:35] holy spirit don't show me maybe then you
[1:20:37] just gotta
[1:20:37] tell me okay i'm not mr discernment like
[1:20:41] brother man i can discern all the
[1:20:42] thoughts and tense of all your heart
[1:20:43] well naomi needs this
[1:20:44] when he needs that i pray i pray for
[1:20:46] that i pray for your needs
[1:20:48] but if there's some way i can help you
[1:20:50] please let me know praise god
[1:20:51] because brother bang i don't want to
[1:20:52] live for myself and i pray for everybody
[1:20:55] here i pray for them but i want to live
[1:20:57] a life
[1:20:57] where i can store treasures in heaven
[1:20:59] where i can help out the people god sent
[1:21:00] me to
[1:21:02] there's my time so give me two minutes
[1:21:06] boy that went fast today's one of those
[1:21:08] days i could probably reach
[1:21:09] two hours but i'm not going to
[1:21:16] next week
[1:21:19] i probably will just because this is
[1:21:22] really hard i want to preach it
[1:21:24] um but you understand right everybody
[1:21:27] understand those are all pretty simple
[1:21:29] concepts but uh this is so helpful now
[1:21:32] and church oh my
[1:21:33] help me jesus bill i was studying billy
[1:21:36] graham's book this week billy graham has
[1:21:37] a book
[1:21:38] you can read most of it online it's
[1:21:39] called the holy spirit how to activate
[1:21:41] your faith and activate the spirit
[1:21:43] billy graham believes as soon as you as
[1:21:44] soon as you say you're sorry you're
[1:21:46] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:21:47] baptized with the holy ghost he said one
[1:21:50] baptism many
[1:21:51] refillings
[1:21:55] and church i watch his son go on
[1:21:57] interviews and they sit across from
[1:21:58] these
[1:22:00] painted up jezebels and high heels
[1:22:02] showing off their
[1:22:04] their chest you can see billy graham do
[1:22:06] the same thing he goes have interviews
[1:22:07] with people that are
[1:22:08] these women that are half naked and
[1:22:10] these are like sister
[1:22:13] i don't know about that
[1:22:16] i don't know but brother amen it was so
[1:22:19] clear to me this week
[1:22:20] that's why god had to send this message
[1:22:23] to take our holiness
[1:22:24] past the flesh past and see
[1:22:28] most of them billy graham's message
[1:22:29] thank god for it but it only got
[1:22:31] to repentance here it never got down to
[1:22:34] the desire of the soul
[1:22:37] it never got down to the where the
[1:22:38] person says all i want is christ
[1:22:41] amen i don't want anything with the
[1:22:44] world all i want is christ
[1:22:46] he never got he never got done he never
[1:22:48] got down to that realm
[1:22:52] and he gives his examples he gives us
[1:22:55] all his supposed reasons but he never
[1:22:58] mentions this
[1:23:00] never mentions how man has three parts
[1:23:04] and how you have to be sanctified and
[1:23:06] then fill with the holy ghost
[1:23:09] and so see then they can never live the
[1:23:11] kind of life that god has called
[1:23:13] us to live the church don't get me wrong
[1:23:15] god's calling everybody in every church
[1:23:16] to live the way we're supposed to live
[1:23:18] but we can see it because we've accepted
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:23] in ephesians two verse two i'm gonna
[1:23:25] read a few scriptures here
[1:23:29] as i close
[1:23:35] in church this is where the revelation i
[1:23:36] believe i believe this is fresh
[1:23:38] revelation in the last few years about
[1:23:40] the soul thirst when i listen to that
[1:23:41] last year
[1:23:42] i believe this is fresh revelation
[1:23:44] because i've never understood this
[1:23:45] before
[1:23:46] but everybody starts with that holy soul
[1:23:48] thirst and then your mind your conscious
[1:23:50] your active conscience here
[1:23:52] it either satisfies that thirst of the
[1:23:55] soul or it satisfies the thirst of the
[1:23:57] flesh
[1:23:58] right bigger barns bigger bars more
[1:24:01] money
[1:24:03] or it says forget that more of god
[1:24:06] amen more of the word amen hallelujah
[1:24:10] more of jesus amen
[1:24:14] do one or the other ephesians 2
[1:24:17] verse 1 and you hath thee quickened
[1:24:21] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:24:25] where in time past you walked according
[1:24:27] to the course of this world
[1:24:29] according to the prince and power of the
[1:24:31] air now look at this the spirit that
[1:24:33] worketh
[1:24:34] in the children of disobedience
[1:24:37] where does that spirit work inside them
[1:24:39] in their human minds
[1:24:41] remember there the bible already says
[1:24:42] sin dwelleth in your members
[1:24:44] your flesh already wants to go right
[1:24:46] along with with the devil right
[1:24:48] it's all ready you don't even you don't
[1:24:50] got to prime it right
[1:24:52] you don't got to prime up your flesh
[1:24:53] already wants to do it
[1:24:55] unless you just got off like a fresh
[1:24:56] anointing or something like that
[1:24:58] you wake up in the morning most of the
[1:24:59] time your flesh will go right along with
[1:25:01] the world
[1:25:04] and so see paul saying when you were
[1:25:05] dead in sins you had a spirit
[1:25:07] of disobedience in you in other words
[1:25:10] the antichrist spirit the spirit of
[1:25:12] iniquity
[1:25:13] obeying the desires of the flesh
[1:25:17] in verse three among whom also we all
[1:25:19] had look all church all of us were
[1:25:21] sinners
[1:25:23] all had our conversation in times past
[1:25:26] in the lusts of our flesh
[1:25:28] fulfilling the desires of the flesh see
[1:25:29] there's that fleshly thirst right
[1:25:32] oh now this message is perfect when you
[1:25:34] get to the revelation of it like the man
[1:25:35] said you got a human side
[1:25:37] and you got an inspired side and you
[1:25:38] have to rightly divide the word of truth
[1:25:42] see somebody that just says oh
[1:25:43] everything on the tape they don't know
[1:25:46] they don't know if 1977 annihilated the
[1:25:48] world or not
[1:25:50] they don't know because it says that
[1:25:51] it's going to they don't know if the
[1:25:53] white horse riders the antichrist or the
[1:25:55] holy spirit they don't know
[1:25:56] they can't say because it's all inspired
[1:25:58] but we know because god has made it
[1:26:00] known to us
[1:26:01] because we desire to know because the
[1:26:03] mysteries of god are given to you
[1:26:05] amen blessed are your eyes blessed are
[1:26:08] your ears for they here
[1:26:12] is my promise brother rams promise
[1:26:14] joseph billy paul or is it joseph
[1:26:15] because he said it's billy paul in 1951.
[1:26:19] oh thank god for the holy spirit
[1:26:22] the lust of the flesh fulfilling the
[1:26:24] desires of the flesh and of the mind see
[1:26:25] you have desires in your mind
[1:26:27] oh i'd like to think about that barn oh
[1:26:29] i want to think about that
[1:26:30] ah that new car whatever it is
[1:26:35] and we're by nature see the children of
[1:26:38] wrath
[1:26:38] even as others let's stand verse four
[1:26:41] but god
[1:26:42] who's rich in mercy
[1:26:45] for his great love wherewith he loved
[1:26:48] bride of christ fellowship
[1:26:50] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:26:52] quickened us together with christ
[1:26:55] by grace ye are saved
[1:26:58] and has raised us up together and made
[1:27:00] us sit together
[1:27:02] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:27:06] so that what can happen verse seven so
[1:27:08] that in all the ages to come
[1:27:12] what is he gonna do he's gonna show the
[1:27:15] exceeding riches
[1:27:16] of his grace and his kindness
[1:27:19] i wonder what that first age will be
[1:27:21] like in the new jerusalem
[1:27:25] what if they'll call it the ephesian age
[1:27:27] i don't know what they're going to call
[1:27:28] it
[1:27:29] with that first age he's going to show
[1:27:31] us how kind he was to us

[1:27:54] i might be driving you out now but
[1:27:57] pretty soon i'm gonna bring you back
[1:28:00] and all the saints will cried weep and
[1:28:02] praise the lord
[1:28:06] all because of his grace and his
[1:28:09] kindness
