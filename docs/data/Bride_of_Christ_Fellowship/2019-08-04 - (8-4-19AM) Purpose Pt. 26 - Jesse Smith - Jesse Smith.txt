forgive me I didn't forget to pray read my Bible though thank the Lord for that thank the mercy and His grace won't forget to preach God's Word amen thank you sir as your attorney let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 elective continue on the purpose series in a visitor this morning Daniel he says he knows a William Branham give you around flaws I Danny nice to meet you sir happy to be in the house of Lord today I mean God for all he's done all he's graciously done for us I got an email this week from a person in south calipari Southern California and he'd been going back and forth about water baptism and he saw our video on the Lord Jesus Christ and he just got baptized this week so we think going for that he said he's just happy about that thank the Lord he said now he said if you know anyone else in Southern California needs baptize you said let me know that's it all right sir so very thankful for what God is doing you know as we turn their classes chapter 3 no we want to remember we had there was two to mass shootings yesterday so as we read our Scripture and pray let's remember all those affected that's awful you know when those things happen it's incredibly sad but you know the Bible said there's no new thing under the Sun it's been happening for all of time you know Cain and Abel started there we want to pray for them the thought came to me you know when I was when I first saw the one about Ohio there's one in Dayton there's a shooting in Dayton last night about this morning about 1:30 a.m. the thought that came to me was how many how many abortions were done yesterday you know people make big big deals about these school shootings and yes they are a big deal I looked it up and there was over around the world there's over 125,000 abortions every day so we have to only we want to weep with those and more with those but also Anna pray for change that God will change people's hearts change the Supreme Court we prayed for that last year but just keep praying but we have to keep this in mind you know the media tries to create this big thing but you know it's been going on forever we just are our duty is to pray for those people and the it light if it impacts any of us that we can be a help to them but we should be just as burdened about the people that had to suffer last night as the unborn we should remember them but we saw last week they don't have a voice we need to be kings and priests we need to stand up for those who don't have a voice and so our prayer is that that God will change things in our world also in our nation and I did I emailed the state of Ohio a couple months ago and they they did pass another law limiting abortion so I thank the Lord for that of course there's more work to be done please ask these chapter three we're looking at verse 7 I got a little more on a time to be silent the time to speak I want to preach them on that and then we'll look at a time to love and a time to hate this morning by the grace of Lord let's all read verse 7 together please ask these three seven on three one two three a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak verse eight let's read it together a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace that's that one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make a note unto God let's just lift our hearts and haven't have any father we love your Lord we pray you bless our fellowship speak to Lord healing means there's a spiritual means there's work needs in Jesus name Lord let your spirit flow God receive all the glory nothing's too hard for the Lord the police needs minister Lord to us through the word in Jesus Christ's name Amen may be seated by God's grace more willing will it's all honey I'm sorry son sorry about that okay well yeah this is on I'm not sure what's going on yes are we having a little bit of YouTube dip technique or technical difficulties earlier now you said which which ones not on okay the lights on though is it on now okay okay well let's have to worry about it for the second service I'm not gonna make big deal but thank you on for letting me know also oh I do have services today if you're part of our home church and you didn't get a message companion make sure you get one of those just think bangs got to get one I think that everybody's got one by God's grace we'll have a carry in on September 8th so we got plenty of time to prepare for that the next few weekends were busy I'm out preaching in a couple of weeks so September 8th ok September 8th way back Arian I'll make sure I text everybody remind everybody by the grace of the Lord ok Liddy you can switch over here Lydia or mom you said the live stream is OK or at least it sounds good in there yeah that sounds good in there I'm sorry praise God let's look to the Lord here as we would preach God's Word amen tonight normalling will not want to start a little series on spiritual warfare I have a lot more to go on the kingdom of heaven there's a lot of parables there's I think 15 or 16 parables now I think I found another one about the kingdom of heaven so we like to continue on that but I think I want to just look at spiritual warfare tonight and hopefully the Lord will deal with us with that so let's look at purpose today I want to finish this 12th season here the Bible said there is a time to keep silence and a time to speak so I want to just look at this now what I added here is we never want to speak negative especially when we're in a difficult situation we never want to speak negatives that's the first thought I want to follow up on we of course know there's we always speak the Word of God against our temptations right we always if we're being tempted we always speak God's Word it's always the time and season for that but if we're going to use a gift we have to wait for the leadership of the Lord and then God will anoint us just like when the God anointed brother Branham to speak the squirrels or got anointed by the bram to tell howdy right to speak the word God will anoint us to bring the past great moves of the Lord or we'd say thus saith the Lord God would join us for that praise God but we got to be in a position to be anointed for that now let's look at this I want I mentioned these last week but I never read them I want to read them to you there's this season here there's a couple seasons where sister Mita was helping brother Branham and so I'm using this as a time to be silent and never speak negative when you're going through a trial and what I mean by that is you never say well maybe God hasn't called me to be saved or maybe I'm not saved or maybe I'm no good maybe God doesn't want to use me you know just things that I said like this idle words because Klaus and we shouldn't say idle words so we want to be careful in the midst of trials to say positive things or say nothing at all right so here's the one I mentioned last week brother Hammonds talking about his new ministry and he said the other morning I said to my wife I'm already fifty honey fine do anything for the Lord I've got to hurry so brother is putting a lot of pressure on himself I got a hurry I got a hurry and she said bill God trained Moses 80 years and said he can train you for another 50 years to get one day of service from you he's got a purpose for you so just stand still she said I thought that's a lot of wisdom stand still God moves every head just according to his great plan just be still God don't don't try to push she said you get ahead of him then it's a whole lot better to try to follow than it is to lead because he's the leader amen how many sheep we got here this morning I want to follow the leaders leadership of the Lord so this is a time where he's getting he's putting pressure on himself I've got to do this I've got to this and his wife asked to remind him listen I've got a perk God's got a purpose for you just stand still so she must have been able to watch his his mannerisms his behavior he was getting uh he was getting maybe stressed out he was putting a lot of pressure on himself but remember the Bible said the wisdom of God is always gentle right it's always peaceful we looked at that last week from James chapter 3 that's how the wisdom of God is it's filled with the peace of God amen and so that's the first situation a few my later brother branham had a febrile e for eight or nine days I think we'll read it in here so this is April of the next year so this is about what fun six months later he said then I laid in bed for nine days with just a high burning fever many of the Brethren come to me many famous brothers came prayed for me here come brother Graham Snelling and brother Otto all these brothers all gathered and praying and everything else me pray he said try my best couldn't even whisper I wonder what's it all about my lovely little wife sitting there her and then praying for me just kept on just staying the same they couldn't understand so here's a time when God doesn't seem like he's answering how many can say him into the head but answer well the church even the pastor you ask every every call that a guest preachers that came in evangelist prayed for me and God still not moving he said what's it all about he said they couldn't understand many times we go through seasons where we can't understand but maybe it's a season for you to learn to say the right thing Amen or be silent because God has a purpose for everything he said then after the meetings was over so he missed these meetings he was scheduled to preach Monday I just you know I'm so thankful for a god-given wife aren't you brother in a real wife a real companion i sat down at motion or got over close to me I said Mita sometimes I wonder you can barely whisper you can hear brother Ram sometimes I wonder I wonder what's the matter I said why would their meetings be there and God let me lay like this said why was it now here's the bad words right sometimes I wonder if he even gone can you picture that see we've got the same way to it I lost my voice and I wonder I do something wrong a few years ago and so we you know he goes through these city seasons and then his wife says she said ain't you ashamed of yourself now of course she didn't say no we're in a bad way but a humble way and she told me bill don't you know that god knows what he's doing with you just be quiet God takes away your voice just be quiet if he shuts down special meanings if he does these things just be quiet he said I went that kind of rebuked me a little so when it laid on the bed and she come and change his sheets and she got the things out on her arm and just started out and I looked there and then brother Graham sees a vision how God was gonna do more things in his ministry and I can't remember the exact vision it was I think it was with a third Pole I can't remember but Jesus appeared to brother Graham right after this I should have got the quote I didn't pull it up wouldn't be hard to do that after service but see God was kind of slowing him down to give him another vision something else to do God had to slow him down and sometimes we can think how could it be God's will for me to not go to these meetings or not free cheese meetings where I'm a preacher for brother branham but see God sometimes slows us down in order to speak clearly to us amen he has to give us a little time he draws us aside to be tested and tried right where the valley my soul amen humility and so we see this as a season where be better to be quiet when if we're gonna say something negative it's best for us to not say anything negative every say then so even the prophet of God even those who are we say most spiritual most gifts most powerful even the most gifted of us are still human we still need God's grace in our lives they meant to show as was prophet by his wife there's a time to be quiet amen and so that's the way with him we know where these are seasons now as I was studying here this came to me this week I know there's another proverb scripture last week we showed you the one where answer not a fool an answer of cool there's times you don't answer a fool because you'll get that spirit on you but there are times you do answer fools now this one came to me again even a fool when he ordered this peace is counted wise and either shutteth his lips as esteemed a man of understanding so it's always wise it's generally wise to wait until you're inspired to say something praise God and so the Bible said even a fool people might even consider a fool being wise if they just shut their mouths right so it's so important for us to remember these scriptures for our lives that we need to be slow to speak I'm gonna be slow to speak and then quick to listen amen right now there are our time so I want to show the other side of the season where blind Bartimaeus cried out more if the congregation's tell him be quiet be quiet be quiet but he says son of David have mercy on me and they say be quiet shut up stop bothering the preacher right but he knew this is Jesus this is the Messiah he's got the anointing if I'm ever gonna be helped it's right now amen so here's the other side of the season where you know Jesus doesn't come around like this all the time right and their seeds of our life where we don't feel maybe the anointing like we do in a certain time amen and when we feel that anointing when we know God's presence with us that's the time we need to cry out to God amen because he cried out said they went before and rebuked him and said hold your peace but he cried so much the more now son of David have mercy on me amen and so the scripture goes on to say and then he comes in what will you have that I do unto you and he said Lord that I may receive my sight and Jesus to them receive thy sight that faith has safety and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw gave praise to the Lord now a member of the number the the maniac of Gadara at Legion he went to come follow Jesus but Jesus said no you stay there you be alight to your community but this blind man he said no you come follow me Amen see because God has a purpose for all of our lives we got to hear what God sang amen we got to hear where God's placed me lord where do you want me where my position is it the following is that the father missionary or is it to find a place where you want to plant me and you want me to grow and you want me to be a witness to all those of my testimony amen see God wants us to have a testimony praise God see both men were testifying EJ was testifying well a maniac of Gadara now delivered and then also the next man was testifying the black Bartimaeus now Peter had to testify to the Gentile or to the Jews that the Gentiles receive the Holy Ghost they were are there are kind of upset verse 17 for as much than as God gave them the gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God because the Jews were saying Oh God how could God for the Holy Ghost on the Gentiles but then when Peter says listen they acted the same way reacted when the Holy Ghost fell they rejoice they declared the wonderful works of God they ran all over the city they shouted three right amen and when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God here's a good example people that were wise Holy Ghost filled people that were wise and they didn't speak against the Gentiles receiving the Holy Spirit instead they glorified God amen so they chose not to be critical see they held their peace with criticism they could have criticized it but instead they held their peace and they didn't speak against it and then they glorified God saying God is also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life amen what is it show Church that we need to be born again well we're born again God will lead us to be silent and then it'll lead us to praise the Lord amen but we got to be so in touch with God that we know which time it is is it time to praise God there's a time to be silent we have to have the leadership of God to do that that's why a lot of people say things and ruin churches are not born again so say things out of the strike church those same things that destroy a relationship or a friendship or a marriage or or something like that those because they're not born again but see those who are born again they ask God Lord set a gate before my lips amen and help me not to say anything except it would glorify you praise God so here's a good example when you're born again now church there's no way that how could they have known that God in the great heavenly was changing dispensations he was changing seasons amen how did they know God was going due to the Gentile they didn't know they had to have something inside of them to recognize they had to be born again in church we won't recognize what God's doing except we're born again amen so we need to be born again and recognize what God is doing in our myths amen see and those who are born again of the Holy Ghost they're to recognize the change when it gets close to the third ball in the squeeze it's not gonna be a change for the world must be changed for us because they're gonna come against us amen it the foolish virgin will recognize it there they're off trying to get the oil they're all trying to work for that is that the foosh bird will outwork the wise merchants a hundred to one he said the trkage book our works as far as labor and effort won't compare them he said because because they're doing it all for the glory of their churches rather than for the glory of the gospel amen see there that's why they'll have you know relays for cancer that's why they'll raise money in and while they're there they're sown alcohol you know and drinking alcohol they'll have a have a supper of spaghetti suffered raise thousands of dollars for cancer survivors or something and get drunk while they're doing it see though I'll work though how all these works and it seem like it's a great thing but it's not a great thing a man the great thing is doing the will of God amen jesus said that say many I you know you can't stop Devils you did many wonderful works but I never knew you because your workers of iniquity praise God so our work seemed to be works of righteousness amen the most important thing is doing the win of God obeying the word of God amen see how could they recognize that they had to have the Holy Spirit inside of them amen now Jesus has to tell Paul not to be silent now later in Corinth they had a lot of persecution as you know and they eventually had to leave but the Bible said Christmas the chief rule of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized then spake the Lord to Paul in the night vision be not afraid but speak and hold not your peace amen remember Paul was forbidden to go up and preach in Asia right we saw that last week in chapter 16 he was for Britain per minute so that was a time not to speak but here is a time to speak and he's all nervous he's all scared so Jesus himself has to come and say don't be afraid speak my word amen I like that I believe the Holy Spirit will inspire us when to speak don't you if God helped this man when he was afraid to speak the work God will help you and I if we're afraid to speak his word amen it's God's will if God wants us to speak then God will lead us to speak praise God Paul couldn't get away from her he he went through fear as well he let the difficult seasons but the Holy Spirit was there to say speak or hold your peace and we gotta listen that still small voice to hear for ourselves amen he said for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee praise God pride much people in this city remember when Jesus sent out the disciples he said I give you power over demons and all these things and he said nothing shall by any means hurt you praise God so see Jesus when he calls you when he puts you in a certain assignment know how long it'll ask is eventually Paul remember Church Paul got whipped what five times there was times that he was allowed to get beat up here's one time where he got spared from it oh my it's gonna take some maturity on our parts see we think well first that by God will never suffer any pain will never suffer under persecution no one would ever attack me well that's not always true it depends what God's will is for that season praise God that's true like when you hear about you know other mentioned churches are you know having people that that die in tragic accidents or something like that and we must not wonder where was God God knew what he was doing Amen god knows what he's doing our lives are laid out before him as a great a great plan he's got the great map just laid out and he knows all about it he knows that for beginning from the end our God is a great God amen he's a great director he orders our steps in his word amen but see there's times to speak no one's going to hurt you when there's times you're gonna have to get whipped five times Paul so we got to be we got to have wisdom we got to have understanding we just got to trust God no matter what we're going through trust the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he continued their year in six months teaching the Word of God among the various teaching teaching the Word of God so God had to say relax Paul you got a year and a half to preach you got a year and have to teach no one's gonna hurt you during this year and a half but after that he said you said you have to suffer great things for my name's sake praise God all right now what a stop there I want to move on now to the 13th season I think I just want to preach the rest of time on this so this 13th season I got a couple examples they just came to me while I was praying here so I don't have all the slides on these but I want look at this now now the 13th we're almost done with this little series that I want to get into the gifts of the Holy Spirit the purpose for your life and all those great things about the purpose I got some questions marks out here because I actually forgot to remove those now in the in the natural and the opposite with love and hate these from what I can see from Scripture deal with relationships now it could be sins and everything like that but I think that works more in the spiritual complementary but in relationships you see this a lot in the in the scripture so let's go to Deuteronomy 22 13 let's go there you know this is a sad thing but you know Moses had to deal with it because the people weren't born again and the Bible said there was a mixed multitude amongst them Deuteronomy 22 here are me 20 to 30 let's go to 12 oh yeah I'm sorry no 13 your honor II 20 to 13 if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and give a cage of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came in her I found her not a maid then shall the father the damsel and her mother take the bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity under the elders that sing the gate and the damsels father shall say to the outers I gave my daughter this man to wife and he hated her and lo he hath given her occasions feasts against her saying I found out my daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of the my daughter's virginity and they should spread the clock before the elders of the city and the owners of that city shall take the man and chase chastise him and they shall merce him in and hundred shekels of silver and give them under the father the damsel because he has brought upon an evil an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days so in this case is this a strange situation really shows you these people weren't born again they weren't even close they weren't even close here's a man who would take a virgin and love her but then after he marries her he finds something he doesn't like about her and the love switches to hate right and he puts a lie on her but then the Bible said the father brings the cloth and then he's got to pay a hundred dollars because he hundred shekels because he brought an evil name upon this version and he has to still marry her now look at us it's quite a season no doubt during the courtship they're all happy making plans how about the number of babies are gonna happen how big a house they want and you know I'm making all these great plans but then it's switch some evil spirit got on this man right he was piercing get all men to how many believe that it's all men or women so it's switch it was a no season they went through a season of love and they went through a season of hate and so God gave them wisdom in every season how to deal with the problems in every season praise God I don't have this one but you know this one between Jacob and Esau before Jacob took it they the the blessings they love each other right and then he hated Jacob I remember that he's gonna kill him so Jacob had to run away get a wife two wives and then some Compu binds and then when he come back he wrestled the angels at God you've got to change me I'm gonna face my brother and he got a new walk which represent the Holy Spirit and then when he walked in Friends of Esau Esau forgave him so they went through a long season many years where there's a season of love and a season of hate praise God in my life I've told you this before when my dad left my mom with six kids and my dad went to come to my games of sports I hated him but then I became a Christian and I loved him yeah you know cuz I signed I realized how much God loves me praise the Lord and I realized I've been realizing this more that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood so that's why Jesus says if you can't forgive someone I'm not gonna forgive you because you got to look at every situation realize who ever hurt you it's not the person it's the demon behind there and that's what we look at tonight the different levels rest against principalities and powers and high places and all these things our battles is is above human battles it's a spiritual battle and this is the area here where God is showing us these things that we've got to we may go through a season where we hate someone or something but by the grace of God he's gonna bring us back to love and notice this is right before the end the final season which the Bible said marked the godly man his end is peace so we know the one represents kind of birth you know and and then this is kind of represents the end maybe where the cycle starts again so this is at the end of the cycle and so God has to teach us Church in to love those who he once hated that's difficult how many can raise your answer that's difficult it's difficult but it's a season that God has laid out in our lives and God are going to Solomon to show us that and so we had we can have the victory often it's in relationships but now spiritually these are all spiritual seasons too we've got the hate the garment stained by sin and this may again connect to the first love of how we got to hate everything that pertains to sin so Jesus says now this season can't pertain to spiritual because we're never supposed to hate anybody we're supposed to love our enemies except the devil and the demons we don't hate them because they cannot be saved there's no redemption for them you have heard that have been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemies they've heard this but I say to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust amen I know yeah so we must love those who hate us so this season's doesn't give us a license while I'm allowed to hate this person now listen let me say this you may hate somebody but it may be a season so the next time you go through a difficult trial somebody hurt you you won't hate them you'll learn to forgive them right away like with me and my father now I know if somebody really hurts me I can't I used to say that a lot I hate my dad I hate him I'll never forgive him I'll never go visit I used to say those things but now I've learned that if somebody does something against me I've got to go with my prayer closet and I've been doing that recently I love sister so-and-so I love brother so-and-so people that have hurt me and on the fax we got to go to the closet and say that we have to say that I love them because the Bible said when you pray forgive jesus said when you pray forgive amen so you've got to take that person's name and your prayer closet and you've got to speak their name and say I forgive them because Jesus forgives them hey we can't hate our enemies we got to love our enemies amen now the Bible said if any man come after me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children brothers and sisters yay and his own life also he shall be could not be my disciple now you got a balance in Scripture because Jesus doesn't mean you hate because that would just do away with what he said here right he just said love your enemies and now we got to understand that maybe they could have chose a better Greek word or something or a better word but because if you look at the parable passage in Matthew 10:37 he said he that loveth father or mother more than me amen it's not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me so we have to make sure we check our Greek words in our understanding because God doesn't want you to hate Jesus not saying you that's okay to hate them now like I said you may go through a season where you do but you need to say God take the hate out of my heart give me love and forgiveness but here in a parallel passage what he's saying is you've got to love God he's got to be your first love amen cuz he said love your enemies right if your mother mother father's your enemy you still gotta love them you're not gonna hate them you gotta love them so it takes a great a great teaching of the Holy Spirit to help us out on these things amen because there's a season to love and hate Jesus is plainly that you cannot love two masters at the same time now Mammon may represents money or the world Jesus said you will eat no man can serve two masters either will hate one or love the other or else he cannot hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon praise God so if someone's not born again yeah they may go through seasons where you know coming to church of the message church feels like they hate it because it's all rules and regulations but I see it as love and protection when God says don't hey he's protecting me from demon powers ain't ya when God saying don't fornicator don't commit adultery he's saying I'm keeping you from AIDS I'm keeping you from murder I'm keeping you from lust I'm protecting you God's Word protects amen its protection amen so see but Jesus says in in the very soul of the person they know which one they love amen a church we got to remember we met you know at work especially at work once again cigarette butts women here you get tempted every time a man says something is that lust spirit and he's got to turn that down and so you know in our work situation the same thing may happen so I'm going to say something to get you hurt your feelings or they they criticize you the spirit of hate or anger may come over you and we've got to hate that you know once we really bread once we really close your eyes and pray will realize that we love Jesus and we hate the world but your flesh if I would say no good thing grows in your flesh nothing amen the sin nature dwells in your flesh your flesh will always hate the Word of God but your soul are always loving amen this we had to make sure we're living from the soul man because yesterday I seen the guy he got his tobacco tin out and my flesh would like to do that right but my flesh ain't in control my soul is in control my flesh is not my control tower my soul's the control tower where God directs all the ships all the decisions all the thoughts God directs it all amen and all the thoughts got to come back to the soul when you're a real Holy Ghost filled Christian amen so see we got to remember that that our sin or flesh still loved sin once the sin and when we're in those atmospheres we gotta remember that's the time to pray and if we leave that place and we gotta pray when we get home and say god I don't love that I love you praise the Lord because it's such a great temptation I'm not above temptation I go to those places and I've got to suffer through that I hear the music I used to sing when I was a teenager I've got a cast that down because your fleshly the flesh wants to dance you know my flesh literally wants a dance that old rock and roll but I've got to bring it under subjection my body's not thine own I realized that my body was purchased on the cross of Calvary by the shed blood of God's Son Jesus Christ our Messiah amen he bought this money it's his body and I've got to be an overcomer and I've got to overcome all those things by his grace amen it's not my body it's his body he bought it amen with a great price so see this is why I'm saying you know the world whenever we go out there sometimes I like to leave home but we have to because you just get around this trash you know you get around this atmosphere and it wants to serve the world but we've got to always remember to serve from our soul praise God that's our true master now the Bible said in Romans 12 let love be without pretending that's what this simulation means pretending so be sincere in your love abhor or hate that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kind the affection one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another to try to prefer your brother-sister give them the first choice do something nice for them see the Bible said this is theirs this is why these things happen all the time love it love love and hate is a season spiritual season that we go through we're I mean how many are learning to hate sin more and love God more see we go through scenes of that where a written we don't hate sin as much and we're getting loosened but God has for - we got it remember to hate sin and then love righteousness amen because we all get tested we all get tried remember you know we were listening to the supernatural in our van Bam's life story and we're right at the part where he goes to South Africa and the second set a trap for him and you remember the story you know he almost died after that because he got amoebas in South Africa because he catered to men he catered denominations rather than the Holy Spirit so this would be the time where we'll say like this brother didn't hate that enough he didn't hate that denominational spirit enough because he surrendered to it praise God so see that's what I'm saying like we get under you know we get around people we got to get peer pressure to even the message right Church believe that we get around that we get influence and we've got to remember to hate anything that goes against God's Word amen no matter who's trying to influence you brother have said I always have with trouble with a bunch of Frazier's he said now those aren't good preachers those are bad preachers I know a bunch of good preachers but but see and then he learned to hate that denominational spirit and he never disobeyed after that remember the denominational preachers wanted to take him just to the small churches but the Holy Spirit want to take him to the massive services so more people could be healed but because they're denominational you know jealousies and and pettiness I don't like that preacher program we're not going to that preacher see my program catered to their schedule rather than to God's schedule just like he catered to his mother-in-law and the church said at one point bro Gramm cater just enough he turned down that offer for the Pentecostal churches see he didn't hate it enough I hated it but not enough may God help us he will go through seasons where we learn more to hate sin so we don't do it again the next time it's presented to us amen that's right hallelujah that's what I'm talking about like lifelong lessons to your life right like with my tune tobacco and cigarettes I threw up a cup you know the reason why I didn't hate it enough but once I hate enough anybody then the love of God came in how did it yeah you've got to hate your sin more than anything and that's when you'll get more love for God amen that's the reason people go don't get delivered like program said with that maniac that felt on his feet he said he's not deliver Satan left him but there was more demons there remember he said Satan leave the man and he fell down at his feet and never believed says he's not delivered because he worships those spirits he loved those spirits and couldn't get delivered so see you didn't hate them enough amen but then Mary Magdalene was seven demons let's go to the very depths and gets us it gets so low that will finally start hating sin that's when we'll get the victory amen I hate acting like it like this I hate orange is getting defeated here I hate that God give me the love of God give me the victory and you know Jesus will bring it amen I know you that's right Church those spirits can stay as long as people don't hate them but they love them those spirits are gonna stay right there so we all love the things of God more than we love anything else see I just want to share those scriptures now I want to deal with this because I mentioned this a few weeks ago if you got your Bible go to first Corinthians 12 I really felt inspired when I said this and I felt I felt the lay of t was even more if not the I'll just say like this I thought the ladies more important than the preacher because there's more of you because listen if you have a preacher okay let's just use me and you I'm a pastor and a church you can go on without me but I can't go on without you right if you all say well but you understand I'm just used as a general example but if the pastor leaves or I get sick or God calls me away somewhere you all can still go on because you're the church the preacher just one person but when we think about a church who do we say Church who do we mention first the pastor not the people see how we ignore makes it easy to identify but why don't we use church names don't just say Brian Kretsch toship because we just like to attach it to a man because it gives you know the man gives the church an image but when God looks at it God's like I'm not giving honor to the what the part you see I give more honor to the part you don't see amen and the success of our church is based upon the prayers of the people the success of brother Mannis meetings were based upon the prayers of fastings of the people amen so my ministry as a pastor will only music successful as your prayers there right but rather said give all the credit to the people fasting you remember behind the curtain memory said that known as evangelistic meetings he would go to certain cities and they'd have people set up praying before bo-ram came and he said give the credit to the people because they're praying and fasting in other words they're trying to contact God they're seeking God asking God to move praise God now if you don't understand that I haven't preached on it too much but let's look at this here this will help you revelation 2:5 Jesus and his bride I love this hate the deeds of Nicolaitans not just Jesus but his bride does to Nikolay tourism is conquering the lazy one holy man well let's wait till he gets anointed wait till he gets annoyed wait now don't don't get me wrong if we leave all the things happen everybody's got to be north i anointed all over the service just the priests and the Catholic another church what he said remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy candlestick out of this place except thou repent but this thou hast and this thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate I've searched that out and make our ears go like this what does Jesus hate Jesus hates Nikolay 'it isn't where you put all the anointing on one person like brother branham right or like a preacher you put all the anointing on men and the people seemingly don't have a ministry he said see how it all started early church it was called deeds and it became a doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh I started out so small so quietly so in offensively it looks so good it seems so sound then it caught a hold like a Python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh that false - subtle it's like an angel of light until it gets a hold of you now I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in leadership of the Holy Ghost through the word I believe also the guy that set men of the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also the church is ruled over by men that God says that take charge amen but that is the rule by the word so that is not man really ruling but the Spirit of God for the word in the sphere are one now then he quotes this I love the scripture remember them which have the rule over you have spoken to you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation so you're supposed to be able to see my faith and other preachers faith and follow that kind of faith however they live their life godly in the godly manner we're supposed to follow that faith right I said by the RAM quotes here he said but see what was happening back there that false vine was getting ahold and it was teaching that rulership my man was right and taught that the church had to be governed it sought to control over the people but instead of doing it God's Way they simply took authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with the Holy priesthood sitting between God and the people they went right back to the old ironic system they became Antichrist for they disposed of his meat ownership and imposed their own will God hated that he sensative that and any true believer will hate it too amen in other words the preachers now the Catholic Church is the best example they treat the priest now I will join with you afraid but as I pray with you I'm putting my faith with you to touch the high priest he's taking the place surprised I'm not taking this place I'm joining my faith in with you that we will touch Jesus because he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities amen and that's by the word because men rule by the word by the Spirit of God not by their own thoughts we would have to be stoned blind not to see the same thing at work all through the ages and right now this the worst of it all so we should be able to see it the clearest of all all right now what it was was an organization that separated the people God's people are supposed to be one amen by one spear they're all baptized into one body and everyone I love this is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God [Music] don't wait til Amen get to the spirit don't wait til I or Malachi or sister Sola don't wait till they get the spirit you and I everybody get in the spirit of God but men one the preeminent so they took over control and bishops became Archbishop's and with imposing titles they bypassed the Word of God and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship to not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost these deeds were the beginning of apostolic succession from apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to church membership as the means of saving grace the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his spirit was predominating the church this is church you a say because you come to our church sup - Jesus Christ amen Romancing you can be baptized that is filled with the Holy Ghost is all those things it is but it should be more he said more seen right now it's the worst of all right now so in other words there's more church membership today than there is relationship with Christ which we know that's not a surprise to us but the trouble is that does surprise us when it lurks in the message churches right because masters people think well I'm Esther job you got a prophet I'm okay no you're not you got to be under the blood of Christ just the same ways everybody else and see the way I want to see it and when you and I need to be we need to all put effort in to bring in the Spirit of God to every service because everybody needs to participate in the worship of God hey man now before I do this let me look up a quick quote Church just give me a I thought it was in here but it's not so let me pull it up the subtle priestly program called it a subtle priests in I thought I had it but apparently I didn't I don't want to move on till I get this one here okay yeah here it is Paul saw it coming he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with his false doctrines so the deeds and Nicolaitans always comes by preachers preachers preachers try to shut down the move of the Holy Spirit in the church that's who do preachers he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a Holy Spirit ministry and even right today amongst those who claim to be free how many claim to be free how many claim to be for the Spirit amen there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there this is over bit it's a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship hey I want everybody to come to church with a song right with that Scripture wanna go with the song with the revelation with a doctrine with something to build other people uh praise God we should all come to church letting the Holy Spirit alright first Canadians travels first Kenny's twelve now um let's just read it I've never preached out of this chapter I don't think on extensive an extensive series well yeah I did yeah I'm sorry it's been a while though it's been a while that's when we were out the other place in warming let's go verse 13 for about one sphere were all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I am NOT of the body is it therefore not of the body now what if I tried what if you walk around one foot church how would you do this after church right every part of the body is some part you're so important you and I we're all important to God's body amen when you're not here not good right when I'm not here unless I'm preaching it's not good that doesn't happen very much so see we're all a part of the God's body we all play an important part in the things of God verse 16 if the ear shall say because I'm not the preacher wait are we there because I'm not the I see I am NOT of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were the hearing where were the smelling but now God has set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him so God gave you a gift that pleased him we just got to find out what gifts we got and how do you know you can do it you can do it because when the Holy Spirit gets on you you can do it that's how you know verse 19 and if we're all one member where were the body but now are they many members but yet one body and the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of thee nor I go to the head I have no need of you see we need every person in this church right to play our part I need everyone from the the sister the brother no matter what far we need everybody in the church to play their part we have need of everybody verse twenty-two see we need you to pray we need you to worship we need you love God we need you to be led by the Holy Spirit amen nay much more those members here it is right here nay no much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary so the ones that we think are feeble they're actually more necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable well we always yeah we should on to the preachers well that's what we do it too much sometimes right those members which we think to be less honorable upon those we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant communists for our comely parts have no need but God tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacks honor so who do we honor we honor anybody that's got a gift preaching if anybody does miracles we honor them with the most honor it's okay to honor them right but we need remember God honors those that are least honored praise God verse 25 why does he do this that there be no division or schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church the first apostle see the missionary that's the highest calling secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts the healings helps government's diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers America's of course no have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts yet I show unto you a more excellent way praise God everybody catch that the Bible said cover earnestly the best gifts so prophecy is one of the greater guess because the Bible said in the next few chapters because it edifies everybody right so prophecy is one of the pretty important gift because it will benefit the most people now I want you to see that covet earnestly the best gifts there's nothing wrong with preachers are you there's nothing wrong with you saying my I want to see God move more in the church that's what I say I see that all the time I pray for that every Sunday I print that every Wednesday night God move by Holy Spirit and thankful what he does through gifts but there are seasons where God's planting right where God's watering and then in the season where God gives the increase the thing is God learned patience I gotta learn patience we all have to learn patience but we all have to find our position in the body as well that's a mystery the will of God we'll get to that one day in the future Lord willing now this I just read this last night or this morning know this morning so brother Rama is asked a question right at the beginning of the church age series he said one wanted to know if is it wrong for women to testify or sing or give messages and tongues interpret the messages or prophesy in the church but ma'am said no it isn't wrong as long as it comes in the place in order see the church is in order only when and the real true way to do it is for those who speak with tongues and things their messages are given before the message from the pulpit never during that time of course the Holy Spirit's moving just from one place at a time as Paul spoke of there but women are gifted with prophecy and get there with tongues interpretations and everything but being preachers and the church said glory so that means women can have a gift the wisdom a word of wisdom she's got to open her mouth and wisdom and give a word word of knowledge which is understanding by the same spirit women can have to get the faith the gifts of healing the gift of miracles prophecy discernment of Spirit divers kinds of tongues and interpretation tough day men nor sisters can have all can have any of those gifts right everything but being preachers Oh hallelujah they're not to be preachers they're forbidden breach of the churches that's right take the place or be a teacher anything else in the church unless brother man says later they can teach Sunday school they're just kids they're not men the Bible said a woman can have a syrup authority above a man he says and can occupy one of those nine spiritual gifts the corner perks canoes twelve as under Noah bond is that her message should not come forth in its place you see each message waits for its time if there be one who speaks with tongues there be no interpreter let him hold his peace - they're beginning interpreter see and these meetings are given usually just before the meeting that's right messages then the profit of the preacher which is the New Testament prophet a preacher when he comes forth God begins to move through him see then when he's finished then messages begin another man then just before it's always an order always but a woman does have the right amen how about all these preachers say like the message given rights Amen it's right there he'll get away now of course he takes me right to wear makeup because that's just America right that's not a god-given right amen what's a saying you have every right the sisters have every right to prophesy or discern spirits praise God well hoping this will help the church someday as the Holy Spirit moves more in our congregation that's my desire I know it's yours too we want to see the fullness of Pentecost being the bride and so that would mean however God wants to move he can move through any gift everybody's born again everybody will use wisdom everybody will stay out of the flesh and they'll just do what God tells them to do and that could mean a woman having a disservice per say excuse me brother the Holy Spirit maybe this word here of the sermon for you the most you have to serve your thoughts intents of your heart you're thinking about that that's the wrong funky thing about this how many vows gonna honestly handle a woman telling you that right right but that's the real reality of the Holy spirit we had that happened one time I told you about it brother Brooks and I were at our dedication in 20 2007 our dedication sister Karen Saunders walked out there and gave it thus saith the Lord and kind of reviewed brother Brooks right in front of both of us and I and a church she rebuked him for something he admitted to me that morning while we were taking a jog at the at the park and she was three hours away in Lima at that time see that's why I knew was the Holy Spirit because mel brooks brotherís was saying i don't give enough testimonies i don't tell enough testimonies i need to write a book on this and he's feeling all bad well she come around that night it must been eleven o'clock at night she said and the people and I can't remember all the words but it was social it discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart and I we're both witnesses we just talked about it see the Holy Spirit is with us wherever we go amen we just got to live such a godly life church that God can use us to do some of these things amen then we got to be humble enough to receive it no matter if it's from a man or a woman well that man is not my husband we'll see then we got it then that man maybe should go through your husband then it's gonna take some wisdom to do these things to take some humility see a woman the message restores the woman's rights the rights of the nine gifts to the Holy Spirit that's right church now here's where I was trying to tell you earlier God is not the god of the pulpit as far as like God only cares he only cares he's only right here making sure everything's okay other man said he's just not the guy the pulpit he said now the thing that we're talking this question was should women and so forth that's exactly what the church or started the church in this case at the beginning they takin all this salon it's solemnity so solemn it II from the audience and placed it in the pulpit God but God is the God of the audience amen Oh amen that oughta make you shocked he was ready be led by the Holy Spirit or just absorb try to get it it's the guy the pulpit and the audience amen like that song said he's gone at the pulpit he's got at the back door he's got in the Amen Corner he's gone all over the floor that's right my man says it plainly here each person has to give to the Holy Spirit and God wants us all to know what we're called to do remember Jesus says I hate that doctor the Nicolaitans when they try right see Bobe I said the Holy Spirit's working through the preacher now because of then the service maybe there's a word to come forth hey man you never know but see people got to come knowing that God used me if you want to use me I got a cut with my heart clean all sins confess I gotta come prayed up amen see he works in every human being oh just preachers know every human being he lives in every heart oh yes he finds those gifted people works through them now if the devil can't catch them on one thing then he comes over and just makes a big conglomerate of nothing that runs the people to be used see we want to be used by the Holy Spirit he said said but if one speaks with tongues by revelation gives interpretation of it something to edify the church then the whole church identified by something that will speak and God speaking in languages that we know nothing about and we'll give it to one and interpret it by another one and say a certain certain thing that happened just exactly the way it said then you've got to the Spirit of the Lord among you and oh let's strive for that friends let's keep that fire burning hey see what does it take it takes a fire in prayer it takes us hungry for the things of God bran never said oh let's get rid of all the gifts I got a call right before he died he said all nine gifts in the spiritual church he said that's a Kazakh if I ever knew it and there's a church age book clover but I said the gifts were made at church until Jesus returns in the rapture amen see let's keep that fire burning so that's what we're to strive for we're to were to try to come here and say God moved by your Holy Spirit that's why I plead on my face every service God moved by your Holy Spirit move amongst us I'm striving I want to see God help us people amen and don't have to be through a gift every time but it can just be through the preaching but I'm saying I want to see more of it so that's why I come to pray for it amen because obviously God the audience - how does he got a notice he got on the acoustic guitar under C got on the no honestly got the pulpit I wanna see godly computer honestly got in the back chair we want to see God in the audience amen we want to see God everywhere no these are seasons because remember Paul even pause to go through seasons where he hated his shortcomings for we know that lost spiritual and I'm carnal sunderson for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I can set unto the law that it's good so Paul went through times he he loved the Lord Jesus Christ in his soul but he hated this this whatever sin it was a besetting sin he would actually do that instead he hated it but he would do it now that is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me so he realized this is not something my soul wants to do this sin is trapped inside my members in other words that made him belong to one a new body amen Gouri the more you saw this sin trapped in his body the more he wanted that sin swallowed up in life amen for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not I might look like a good pastor I might be a good friend of you but I tell you when I'm all alone and I'm there's times I hate what's inside of this guy right here I hate it I look down to myself and say what am i doing how could I think that how could I say that how could I do that what's wrong with me but I'm just like Paul I do it but I hate it I love the things of God but I do things that I hate amen but next time I'll get the victory amen hallelujah so he had to recognize it's not and I had to tell it to haven Haman's Haven was asking me this morning about you know when you sin or notice yesterday she's asked me about I said honey when you sin it's not you I said it just your flesh because the Bible said the seat of God doesn't sin remember first John if the seed of God's in you it doesn't sin Paul says you sent in your flesh and your mind your flesh and your spirit that's where you sin but you don't sit in your soul that's God's seed that's God's nature that's the and everything that's in you all your let's say all the gifts you ever use all the healings you ever see all the other Americans ever see it's already in that seat yeah glory now the Bible says you must hate others sin so much that you go try to reach out to them this is where I need help this where we all need help because we don't want to fend people but we need to be led of the Holy Spirit keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference so see you can't have compassion on everyone there's not enough time in your day my brother man almost killed himself by praying for so many people going without brakes he had to learn to take breaks it was in 1949 he almost died he had to take a break he was six months off the field and they started up meetings back in January 1950 right and that's when the pillar fire came a little break he had amen see he thought and memory you can hear on tape brother Ram says anytime you need me he said call me this is before his break he said call me I'll be there rain or shine and he did but then he had to find out later no I can't do that because I'll kill myself and God doesn't want me to kill myself I said last week on weeks ago God want you to have vacation God doesn't want you to kill yourself you have to balance and if some have compassion making a difference you can't have compassion on everybody and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now that's how you should feel you should hate to see your loved ones dabbling in sin right or your friends you should hate to see friends dabbling around with sin the Bible said you should hate that and that should cause you and movie to have compassion and try to make a difference in their life right can I help you do you need a Bible can I pray for you do you want one of my pastors books about modesty you want a message companion book anything try to help try to have compassion can I put a prayer request in for you you need some money need some food we need to have compassion trying to help people amen all right now here's what was special about Jesus I'm the Bible said David wrote about well you know what was special about him he loved righteousness and he hated iniquity uh-huh now here it is because Jesus hate iniquity that was the key to his anointing because the Bible said therefore because he hates sin therefore God anointed with the oil gladness above his fellows amen if we look for more more noisy means more hatred so we live [Music] therefore I'll anoint him above everybody else because he hates iniquity thank you Jesus see that's why maybe some some sermons brother brother amen brother Aaron some sermons got more anointing than others but we don't really know anything maybe people haven't been hatin sin like down too but that's okay we're patient right we love each other we're a body we eat each other there's their seasons for cleaning to praise God their season the Wren their season the show glory amen their seasons but see the more we hate sin the more God anoints us here's a bold claim this is this is pretty powerful he's talked about Christ in the church so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he's at love with his life loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh there's never been a man that hate his flesh you say what about a suicide guy well that wasn't him that was the devil doing that that man treated he washed his body he combed his hair brushed his teeth he put on deodorant he took care of himself he didn't hate his body because the Bible said every man nourish and cherish his body even as the Lord the church you say what about a scruffy old man a hundred up in the woods he still feeds his body he's got he still lays in a soft bed somewhere he don't lay on spikes and stones and scratching his back he's no man never hate his flesh but see we've got to learn to hate it we got to learn to hate sin that dwells in our flesh and obey the Holy Spirit I'm almost done bear with me here this was a lot of the scriptures and the Bible actually talked about this that's why I put a lot in here this book actually first John deals with this he's assay if he's in the light and the message and hated this brother he's in darkness even till now well I believe the message but I hate this church I hate that you don't have the light yet from you he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there's none occasion of stumbling in him but he said hey this brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knoweth not whither he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes hatred blinds people's eyes because he says later you can't hate a man and then that you can see aim in other words however you treat the people you see that's how you treat God amen Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you people some years let him hang around and see how much they love everybody after a few years right we've seen people would hang around our church for years and years here's I'm pretty soon it's a little bit bitterness may come in a little bit of hatred so that's why this church is the best place to stay and love everybody amen whatever Church God calls you stay there love them stay there decade after decade forgive 70 times 7 amen none of you have ever forgiven me 490 times have you if so yeah let me know about it that's a big number 490 times forgive somebody that's how you know you pass from death on the life you can forgive those that you used to hate amen whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say oh I love God I love Jesus and hate his brother he's a liar there's a lot of church splits brother William seen him I've seen him we've seen Jose seen a lot of the church foots but and people hate each other when they split you can't love God and hate your brother we're either loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can you love God whom you've not seen in other words your love for God is seen through the people that you see amen everybody sees your love on how you treat the people that you see hey you can't be good you don't know right I can't treat you good I don't love God I can't love you and forgive you and pray for you and help you if I can't love you I can't love God because we can't love someone invisible if we can't love the visible and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also hey I'm trying to get let me see where I got I'm almost there I feel bad like I'm going too long I'm almost there yeah the false church is filled with hate not but not us right because the Bible said they're full of hateful birds you listen to a Catholic sometime I'm listening to someone you listen to him at all let's just listen for a while see what's going to come out of our mouth if this is scriptural they're gonna hate a lot of things that they shouldn't hate because they're full of it that's the mother and she got daughters just give people a little while you listen to them pretty soon I start talk about all the things they hate all the things going wrong in my life all the bad things the Bible says and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus amen we all struggle we all go through trials but we all got it all turn around the right season see it's hateful they're full of hatred in the foster but we're full of love amen or love for the word love a lot of love for sin we got love for the word yes yeah I think I have some quotes on that I put my thoughts in there sometimes I forgot to go through that take them out yeah I mentioned that yeah Bob Ram said people actually love the devil programs reading X's 21 verse 5 and we preached on this recently with the man who took the all if the servant we didn't want to go free the Jubilee he take a halt this is that text right here and if the servant that's the man that was to be free shall say plainly I love my master and now here's what uses that for today oh I like to go to dances I had given up my dances for nobody I ain't giving up this or that or other nobody my wife my children this earth and I love now look here brother Graham I'm gonna tell you do you mean I have to you have to stop nothing you just come in and it stops itself but you say well I wouldn't do that I'd I don't have to do that I belong to church I'm just as good as you or anybody else all right brother that's all right you hear what's the truth what I listen here ain't father son Holy Ghost just as good well if you want to keep to that way you just go right ahead you've heard what you heard that trumpet sounded and you heard a note of given the Bible said Oh God look at that wouldn't that make for a text right now in the next hour if the trumpet give an uncertain sound for if your denomination says polish and only ghost that no sound like the trumpet if the trumpet gives the uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for war now he reads it again and the servant shall say I love my master I don't want to be free the Holy Ghost and he says this is what people are really saying I love the devil that's making me do these things that's making me hate my brother I love it oh that's making me do this sexual sin I love the devil that's making me so afraid they love those things so program uses that time I'd rather stay with my master where people are saying that today I'd rather stay with the devil he says and I think you're too narrow mind up there I just think you're too narrow all right I love the things I think about to have these big things like this have dances Bunco in the church things like that all good time they're just as good as any a bunch guys but there all right all right he says and I will not go out seeing the freedom of the Spirit you talk about so going free of the Jubilee is freedom in the Holy Spirit and then his master the devil shall bring him to the judges and should also bring him to the door what who's the door congregation says Jesus Christ I set before you a door when did that mark of the beast come in this age where the door was sent the final marking of the Beast and how do we know that we have life is because we hate sin and we hate sin so bad till we know that death associates there and we shun the very appearance of it any way we can get affront away from it we jump run anything that we can do to try to keep away from from sin because sin has death in it and we sure don't want to associate anything in death we want to keep away from that man so he was talking to young Christians the day before he said if you were standing out there on the road and the car was coming down the road at 90 miles an hour out of control you would get out of that highway as quick as you could you jump slide you anything to get away that car and that's the way sin should be to a Christian because sin is associated with death and as soon as you see sin in any form jump from it get away from it I don't care what you have to do get away from the very appearance of evil because remember yes to associate with sin is death just the same as standing there and let a car strike you don't just wait and see what it'll do get out of the way the very appearance of evil shut it quickly then you see a temptation coming up you know it's if something's wrong that death is lurking after you see then get away from it just as quick as you would get away from my autumn will be approaching at 90 miles per hour see you'd want to get away from it right quick out of the way jump slide run just get away from it let's say into our feet by God's grace amen praise God gotta get away from it now the next time we look at warm peace there's national Wars peace treaties within their spiritual Wars so what close of that one next time by the grace of God how many love the Lord today we looked at a lot love and hate today we looked at seasons and musicians I'm sorry musicians you can come look at these seasons of love and hatred let's just bow our heads here I think the thought that you know I felt the Holy Spirit dealing with a lot was do we love all of our brothers and sisters do we hold any grudges against anyone do you have any roots of bitterness is there any sin that we love that we shouldn't love remember comes in any form and Satan just lurking around waiting to come around and try to knock somebody over right like Bob em said hit somebody with a ninety mile per hour car they come so fast don't they become so fast Satan is lurking around he's watching your behavior he's testing you he's tempting you and then the temptation will come so fast [Music]
