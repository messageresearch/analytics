TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to read again from matthew the 13th chapter he said this morning we'll just be picking up where we left off and trying to further the thought that we have continued on matthew chapter 13 read verse 24 to 30. another parable put him forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like and unto a man with sow good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servant of the householder came and said unto him sir this not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hatha tares and he said unto them an enemy hath done this and the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the time of the harvest and in the time and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather you together first the tares and bind them in bundles that to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now i'd like to drop down to verse 37 in which jesus actually now interprets the parable to them and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of the kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth let's just bow our hearts to him heavenly father we're just again thankful for your presence that we feel here this evening as we have come together lord just to sit at your table god knowing that we don't have to come and just sit in an empty plate but lord we can come this evening father and sit down to a full course meal lord a meal that you have prepared for us within your word and father we come tonight my heart is hungry lord god and i'm just ready to receive from you lord i pray that you would take the scriptures that we've read lord the thoughts that i have laid before me father that you just come and open them to our hearts and to our minds lord even as we spoke this morning father that we've got to look beyond just those things that we've been taught the lord we've got to look into the pages of your bible and find out what your word says and lord that's why we're here tonight father god is not to just to to to sit around and talk of our beliefs but lord we want to see what your word does say we just pray that you just touch every heart every life that's here minister to every need god whether it's a physical need or a spiritual need you know the hearts of your people you know the conditions of their life we just ask that you would minister to them anoint me tonight your servant fathers just stand here at my postal duty i pray that you would just speak to me tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i'd like to say that it's good to see with isaiah brooks and the saints from amen to church there in lime and fellowship with us tonight and just trust the lord with us speak to your hearts as we continue with this with the word i want to you know just give me a few moments maybe i'll just kind of just do a brief recap of what we kind of touched on this morning and just tried to build back up into where we left off at and i want to just just to say again as i said this morning that we're living in an age in which there are so many beliefs and so many people have so many ideas concerning the word of god and we find that as i said that you know you take all out of them just maybe in this town alone of how many churches there may be and you'll find that as you sit down with each organization each church every one of them has a system of beliefs by which that they view the word of god by and to understand the word of god we cannot take the word and filter it through um through belief filters but we have actually got to look at the word of god in light of what god said within it and i showed this morning how that that that as i told you that my parents had taught me wrong from a child and just in the simplicity of the very fact of the wise man being at the manger scene we took the word of god we showed that according to the scripture the wise men never was at the manger scene but when the wise men come to find christ he was two years old and they found him in a house and the bible didn't refer to him as a babe but referred to him as a young child and so in just looking in light of that if if in such an area that is so minor is that that we can be misled to believe something and this is something that i held and i fostered as truth and i believed it as truth and i and when i would go you know to the court and see in the courthouse and the different place in time when christmas would come and here was the manger scene and the wise men and the shepherds was there and here i always identified that as truth but later in life god when i looked into the word of god i realized that it was error and so the thing that i had to do was cast my formal belief aside to be able to accept the truth of the word and so to fully understand the word of god we cannot try and even tonight when we go into the father part of what we was ministering upon this morning i'll probably dare say that the majority of what i'll be saying may cut across a lot of what you've been taught from childhood but don't just sit and try to figure something out or cast something aside just because it is contrary to what your mother and your father always taught you are from what the maybe the great religious teachers of the day is even taught as well because we know that not all of them is wrong and i could show them many different points where where different organizations is wrong as we showed this morning that you take a child that's been born in the catholic home the bible in christianity means one thing to him a child that's born in a baptist home the bible in christianity means another thing to him a child that's born in a pentecostal home the bible in christianity means another thing to him but by what standard is god going to judge us to to those if we went down to the first baptist church tonight they're going to tell you that god is going to judge you by what they teach you go to the to the united pentecostal church they're going to tell you that god is going to judge you by what they preach but the fact of it is when when there's so many beliefs and so many different facets of religion where where do we stand at and by what standard is god going to judge us we know the bible said that heaven and earth will pass away but he said my word will never pass away so when it comes down to the finality of it there's only one thing that god is going to judge his people by and that is by the eternal word of god he's not going to judge us by experiences he's not going to judge us by sensations he's not going to judge us because we shouted he's not going to judge us because we danced in the spirit but god is going to judge us by his word amen so i want to just kind of just emphasize on those areas again as we we point in tonight now we have shown in the scriptures that from genesis to revelation and this is the thing i emphasized on this morning which is important to understand the part we want to deal with tonight that from genesis to revelation there are two seeds and all through the bible god identified the two seed we showed how that he spoke of those cursed children that was on his left hand we see that there was a right hand and there was a left hand of god we just read in matthew 13 where jesus speaking identifies the two seeds as the tare and the wheat which was sown by two different souls in first john 3 and 10 he speaks of the children of god and the children of the devil we show that there is a cursed seed and there is a non-cursed seed we've shown this morning that in genesis how that adam wasn't cursed eve wasn't cursed but the serpent was cursed and the cain was cursed then in john 17 and 9 jesus praying he said father he said i pray for them but i pray not for the world and so over and over and over again all through the scripture jesus explicitly shows a separation between two separate seed lines there was the elect of god and the non-elect of god may acts 13 verse 48 identifies those that was ordained unto eternal life jude the fourth verse or speaks of those that would be for old ordained unto condemnation so we find that there are those ordained to life those that are ordained to death one is born of god and the other one is born of satan now i and this morning we left off with matthew the seventh chapter and i'd like to go back to matthew 7 again and we're just going to pick up from here and just move right on into the thought this evening now in matthew 7 and there's a few other things that i want to point out here before i we proceed in in looking into another area within the word but again as i say we're going to be going through a lot of scriptures i hope you have your bibles to turn and read along with me so that you'll realize that i'm not just saying these things of my own accord but it's from the word of god now in matthew the seventh chapter beginning with the 17th verse notice now the what jesus begins to speak of and you're going to see as i said that he constantly identifies and separates two seed lines and even here in matthew 7 he speaks of in verse 17. notice how he starts out even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit now notice what he does immediately and starting off he now identifies a a good tree and a corrupt tree and he says now a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit and neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruit you shall know them not every one that say it unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now this morning we were showing how that we are we are chosen in god before the foundation of the world and i was showing that i asked the question to you when did god recognize us as his children was it the day that we come to the altar and we confess our sins no that is not when god recognizes you as his children because we showed that in hebrews the seventh chapter and verse nine where it said as many as i may also say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham god recognized levi abraham was levi's great great grandfather and god recognized lee by generations before levi ever came upon the earth and so we find that when did god recognize us as seed we know that the scripture said in ephesians 24 as i said this morning according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so we realize that we were chosen in god before the foundation of the world and her name was not put on the book the day that we come to the altar but if we were elected of god and if we are the children of god our names was all the book before the foundation of the world because he said in revelation the 13th chapter verse 8 and whose names were written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world then in second timothy 2 19 he said the lord knoweth them that are kids now we come to matthew 7 and we run into something very interesting because jesus now began to speak to a people that he declared in verse 23 he said i never knew you now here was a people remember now that ii timothy 2 19 the lord knoweth them that are kissed now remember a father knows who his children are and here was a people that prophesied in his name they spoke in tongues they killed the sick they raised the dead they've done many signs wonders notice now and everything they'd done they've done it in the name of jesus christ because they said lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thine name of cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works here was a people that within their minds they believed they was totally right right because here they are standing lord we're christians we've done all of these marvelous things and notice now jesus begins to identify but notice what he said in the 20th verse he said wherefore by their fruit you shall know them now he said so you will know the kind of seed it is by the fruit it produces now i want to ask you a question and there's something i want to lay in here just before i proceed what is the fruit of the believer what's the fruit of believers so oh bless god if we speak in tongues that's the fruit of believer no it's not if we prophesy if we call them out and tell them what's wrong with them that's the fruit of believers no it's not if we heal the sick that's the fruit of believers no it's not because here was a people that as far as having experiences with god they could say i've had experience i've prophesied i've spoken tongues i've healed the sick we've done many wonderful things in thy name but yet jesus said depart from me i never knew you so the fruit he was looking for was not whether they could speak in tongues the fruit he was looking for was not whether they could dance the fruit he was looking for was not whether they could prophesy that was not what christ was looking for but notice if you have your bibles what he said in second thessalonians the second chapter and the 13th verse because here it raises something that begins to bring a lot of things into more perspective ii thessalonians 2 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren be loved of the lord notice this laughs part now because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation now notice how god chose us to come to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so how do we come to god how do we how do we how do we know that we are the elected of god how do we know that we are the seed of god if you come to god the way the bible says you'll come to god which is through the which is through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so the fruit of the believer or the evidence that they are the right seed is that they will believe the truth and what did jesus say the truth was he said in the bible thy word is truth so we are we come to christ the belief of the word not a belief in our beliefs you don't come to god through a belief in in your beliefs but we come to god through a belief in the word so it's not if let me just say it to you like this the same thing that paul said paul said that there is some that has risen up among you that has begun to pervert the gospel of christ and he said if any man come preaching any other gospel then what i have preached let him be a curse notice now here paul was identifying a people that was preaching they was not just totally doing away with the word but they were still preaching preaching christ but they actually began to bring judaism back into the law of grace and here paul began to identify that because they had aired from the word of god that they was removed from christ and they were a curse so it is not just taking a part of the word and i want to just inject this sin people say well bless god if we don't understand it now we'll understand it on the other side i hate to bust your bubble but if you don't understand this book now you're not getting to the other side because why would he say in this bible in daniel that he revealeth the deep and secret things if jesus if god reveals the deep and secret things then there must be a people that he is revealing the deep and secret things too remember what he told the scribes and pharisees he told them the disciples asked him said lord why do you speak unto them in parables modest jesus was just speaking to them he was telling the same story when he would sit down and speak a parable he was telling the same story but there was two classes of people that were sitting there hearing the scribes and pharisees the religious leaders of that day all that they was hearing was some nice little story but he said to those disciples blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear in other words you're going to see things and you're going to hear things that nobody else is going to see and hear so the fruit of it of the believer or the evidence that they are the right kind of seed and i want to just say this and i'm not saying this very lightly i'm hoping you're not basing your your relationship to god on some sensation because i can take you to people in the catholic church that has testified and it is on account with many witnesses that has had a many experience but the very thing that they believe is 100 contrary to the word of god now do we believe the word of god or do we not believe the word of god it's not just taking a part of the word and single down say oh i believe that but i'm not going to believe that because that is a little bit different than the things that i've always been taught so the evidence wasn't signs wonders and miracles because had it been these would have been believers they had that they had prophesied they killed the sick they spoke in tongues but they didn't have the belief of the truth they had a belief in the word but it wasn't the right belief there's a big difference in having a belief in the word and having the right belief of the word now i want to just show you one more thing before i move on mark the 16th chapter because this is pretty interesting to me when you look at matthew 7 in connection to what jesus said in mark 16. notice what he says mark 16 begin with the 15th verse and he said it to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now i don't know about you but if i were just to read the word of god what jesus said right here at face value would almost make those in matthew 7 believers because notice what he said in verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe notice the next thing he says now in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants notice now mark 16 jesus is telling them that the signs of wonders and the miracles are done in his name well with these in matthew 7 stood up they said lord we prophesied in your name we've done many wonderful things in your name but yet when jesus ends this conversation with those in matthew 7 he said that he tells me he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you so now in mark 16 we have the we have jesus speaking to the believers but yet in matthew 7 we find him speaking to the non-believers but the believer and the non-believer both had signed wonders and miracles now that just strikes me a little bit and that's a whole other message in itself that if i had time i would speak on but i don't but notice this now what was the difference between matthew 7 and mark 16 when they both had signs wonders and miracles when they both were speaking in times when they both was raising the dead when they both was doing all of these great things what made the difference because one group was believers and one group was non-believers one group was a good tree the other group was a corrupt tree one group was ordained to life the other group was ordained of condemnation notice they both had signs and wonders and miracles they both had faith in god to believe god for signs wonders and miracles but they didn't both have the word because notice now what he tells them now the original commission and people say all these sons shall follow them that believe that is truth but the original commission is found in verse 15 by which jesus said and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and notice what he says in verse 16 where so many people misconstrue this scripture because they single it out itself and he said and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned then they go right into the next church and these signs shall follow them that belief and they see see if you've got enough faith signs wonders and miracles will follow you but let me say this faith for a miracle will not save you you can take a prostitute off the street that can have enough faith in god and get healed i've seen people that that was of no account of whatsoever claimed no christianity at all but yet would have enough faith in god to kill him and then you take a believer that that is a bible believing christian and not even have enough faith for healing so this believing when it speaks of believing here it's not dealing with the faith believing it's not to have enough faith to conjure up enough faith but what are we to believe notice what he says he that believeth and is baptized what are we believing verse we've got to believe what he said in verse 15 preach the gospel to every creature and to kill that believer to him that believeth what that believes the gospel that's being preached well what is the gospel the gospel is the anointed word for the hour it's the unadulterated word of god and jesus said he said preach the gospel to everyone and to him that believeth and this baptized shall be saved but notice what he says now because this is very important the next phrase to understand matthew 7 and he that believeth not he that believeth not shall be damned now what was happening to the group in matthew 7 signs wonders and miracles but christ when he ends his conversation from them depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you what was happening the gospel do you know what iniquity is iniquity is to be presented with truth iniquity is to be presented with truth and fail to walk in it and here was a people that was being presented truth they was being presented the unadulterated word of god and they failed to work in it they believed not therefore jesus had to carry out his own word and damn them you know it's what it that's what it is because he goes right into the next verse 24 in matthew 7 he said therefore whosoever heareth these saiyans of mine and vieweth them in other words has obedience that's what doing is obedient he said i would liken him to a wise man so we find now that mark 16 is a people that heard and believed and walked in the obedience of what they heard matthew 7 is just the opposite a people that was presented with the truth of the word and rejected it and turned it down maybe because it was contrary to what their pastor had always preached to them but for what cause it was they they walked in iniquity they was presented truth and they turned it down and jesus said he said you are he said i don't even know you you never proceeded forth you never come for me i'm not your father depart from me you workers of iniquity now i want to just move on if i may now let's go back to first john the third chapter the tenth verse because here we s we see two c two c's two seeds one believing the truth another one rejecting the truth of god and this to this pattern runs from genesis to revelation i wanted to say this to you you cannot build a doctrine for one scripture but it's got to tie from genesis to revelation when you can see something from genesis to revelation you know it's the truth of god now notice now first john the 3rd chapter the 10th verse because i want to now move into an area of where does these two feet come from where is their origination where do they where do they spring from notice now first john let me get there i thought i was there but i was first john 3 10 invest the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever death not righteousness is not of god neither is he that loveth not his brother now here we find john speaking of the seeds that we have been looking at and john identifies these two seeds as children and he calls them the children of god and the children of the devil so when we just take the comparison just a moment of looking at mark 16 versus matthew 7 we see the two sets of children we see the children of god and we see the children of the devil one that can accept and believe the word of god and one that cannot accept and believe the word of god now the word child declares that you have a father now i want you to understand this now to be a child you had to have a father and if there is two sets of children there had to be two fathers now just think a while to be a child you had to come from a sea and the child is the product of the life that was in the seed and produces the same life now notice what he said again in the 10th verse of first john 3 in this the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever death not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his john tells us in this latter part neither he that loveth not his brother and john tells us that whosoever doth doeth not righteousness is not of god and then takes us to the beginning in verse 11 where he said for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another and he tells us that cain wasn't of god because it was he that didn't love his brother this is the message you have heard from the beginning notice what john's doing now john's taking us all the way back to the beginning and he is now he's identifying the children of god and the children of the devil and he begins to show that whosoever doth not righteousness is not of god not of god neither he that loveth not his brother this is the message you have heard from the beginning amen that he said that we should love one another none they'll notice now we find that cain showed his connection to the wicked one by his hatred and by slaughtering his brother because what verse 12 not as king who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and went for slewing him because his own works were evil and his brothers were righteous now notice now cain hated abel right genesis 3 15 i will put enmity between thy seed and her seat and the word enmity there is hatred i will put hatred between thy seed and his seed verse 12 tells us that cain was evil and abel was righteous not as king who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore showing him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous you see each seed produced the life of their father now remember that verse 10 speaks of children with separate fathers the children of god and the children of the devil now watch here now let's go back a minute to matthew the 13th chapter because when jesus speaks a parable in the bible he wasn't just speaking it just to to make up time but he was actually relaying something that had a very significant importance to it it was a message it was something that when he told the disciples he said it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom and how was he teaching him the mysteries of the kingdom he was teaching them the mysteries of the kingdom through parables and when jesus would sat down and began to speak to them and tell a story he was actually trying to reveal something to them he was revealing something that is a mystery and a mystery is something that is not fully understood or known but can only be understood by a divine revelation given unto you to know the mystery just given unto you to know those things that are not fully understood but can only come by divine revelation that's what jesus was telling the disciples and here now he comes and he begins to break into them and begins to speak to them apparently begin to speak to them a mystery of the kingdom something that is not fully known or understood except by divine revelation so notice now in matthew the 13th chapter beginning with the 24th verse again i want to just emphasize on this here it comes with the parable now and another parable put it forth say unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is lacking unto a man which sowed good faith in his field and while he's well men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so so the servants of the house only came and said unto him sir just not thou so good seed and thy field and from which had the tears and he said unto them an enemy has done this and he said now the servant said unto him what thou that we gather them up and and he said nail us while you gathered the tears you rode up also the wheat with them but let bro both go together until the time of the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather yet together first the tariffs and bind them in bundles of to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now here jesus places the parable out but then he drops down in verse 37 and begins to identify what he was trying to say to them notice what he says now in verse 37 but he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one and the enemy that showed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels and as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be at the end of the world notice this now in matthew 13 verses 24 to 30 and verses 37 to 39 we find here that there is two sowings of seed by two different sowers the siege was not sown by the same soil but the seeds were sown by two different sowers one was sown by the son of man and the second one was the enemy which was the devil now notice now each seed that was sown produced after its kind remember the law of genesis 1 11 and 12 when he said let every seed bring forth of its kind remember what he said in matthew 7 jesus was not just saying things ideally but everything he was saying was trying to shed farther light onto something and in matthew 7 he said wherefore he said a good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit of amen so what was he showing us that the kind of sower the life whatever the sower soul that's what the seed had to be the tear was a tear and the wheat was a wheat and they could not change what they was they produced the life of their souls which in this case i want to just go ahead and say fathers because in matthew 13 verse 38 he calls these seeds children for he said in verse 30 the filters of the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom and he said but the tares are the children of the wicked ones so we had two swords or two fathers that was showing two separate seeds and each seed produced the nature of its father one came out of terror you know what a terror is a tear is an impersonator of the wheat on the outside it looks just like the wheat but when you break it open there is no grain on the inside of it and that's what you had in mark 16 you had a genuine wheat seed but in matthew the seventh chapter you had nothing more than an impersonator of christianity that on the outside looked like everything but the seed was wrong amen the word of god now cain and abel and i want you to hold on to your seats a while but cain and abel produce the life of their fathers cain's works were evil while abel's was righteous for he said in first john 3 12 not as cain who was of the wicked one and his own works were evil but abel his brothers was righteous remember cain was cursed not able right genesis 4 11 and now art thou cast from the earth but abel was not cursed you might say well i thought cain and abel had the same fathers well that's where i'm going to differ with you because the word of god and the bible teaches totally differently amen now as i said you're going to have to go beyond your formal beliefs you've got to go beyond the wise men of the means you're saying you've got to go and say well lord what does your word say because that's what i want to know that only those that are going to make it is going to make it through a belief in the truth right now according to the bible i believe that the original sin was not eating an apple but the sin that came to the human race was through a sexual act you might say that the bible said that they partook of a forbidden fruit and that's what caused the fall that's exactly right if you have an understanding of the scripture and tie it from genesis to revelation you can't just single out one scripture and try to understand something but you've got to look at the continuity of the word from genesis all the way to revelations notice now turn with me in the second peter the first chapter of the fourth verse ii peter 1 verse 4. i want you to notice what the scripture says now i'm going to begin to lay some things in scripture after scripture after scripture and i want you to see this for yourself and second peter the first chapter the fourth verse notice what peter begins to say now whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be the partakers of the divine nature notice this last phrase now having escaped the corruption having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now peter tells us that the corruption came into the world through lust and lust is a desire for what is forbidden and so corruption came into the world through the original sin now go to psalms 51 verse 5. psalms 51 5. notice what david says now in relation to what we just read behold i was shaping iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me now i want to ask you a question how was david conceived in sin if his parents were married and the bible said the bed was undefiled because it is not a sin for me to have sexual relations with my wife because that is a part of marriage and david's mother and father was married but yet when david relays this he said in sin did my mother conceive me he it wasn't sin for him to be conceived but through that sinful act which brought corruption into the world this is how david came to recognize it as sin he was brought into the world through a sinful act of adultery in which the serpent begotted go to genesis the second chapter now genesis 2 verse 8 and 9. notice now here jesus says how god is speaking now and the lord god planted he planted a garden eastward in eden and very put the man whom he had farmed and out of the ground made the lord god grow every tree that is pleasant to the site good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil verse 16 and 17 now and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die now verse 9 when he says out of the ground may the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the first part deals with trees growing that was good for food and then there's a semicolon which is a pause or a change of thought and he says now after the semicolon after the pause after the change of thought he said then in the midst of the garden was two more trees the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now notice now in verse 9 it says that out of the ground grow every tree that was good for food out of the ground got every tree that was good for food but notice in verse 17 but of the tree of knowledge and good and evil thou shalt not eat but from the day that you deserve it thou shalt surely die now i want to just make one statement here any tree that will kill you isn't good for food right and in verse nine he said it out of the ground may the lord god grow every tree that was blessed inside good for food chemical and the tree of life also notice what he's doing now he is making a separation between the trees that grown out of the ground and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and grown out of the ground so there was something forbidden that would bring death to the human race something forbidden that would bring death to the human race let's go to genesis the third chapter now genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yeah if god said you shall not eat of the heat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees the trees plural of the garden and notice now but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the servant said you said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god does know that in the day that you either of your eyes shall be opened until you shall be as god knowing good and evil now notice you drop down into verse to verse 15 and you see after from here all the way down to verse 15 you come into verse 15 and i will put enmity between thy between thee and the woman in between thy seed and hershey now somewhere between matthew between genesis 3 and 1 and genesis 15 there was two seed lines showed up and prior to this there was only one adam seedlings but between genesis 3 and genesis genesis 3 1 and genesis 5 3 15 2 seedlines shows up now my previous teaching as i said to you and i emphasize over and over again you cannot base your salvation on your previous teaching you've got to base it on the word of god and my previous teacher would have me to believe that this is a snake wrapped around a tree eating an apple and talking to eve you know why i believe that when i was a child because i used to have me a children's bible and in there when it come to genesis 3 here was standing there with a big bright bread apple and the python was wrapped around a tree and and so this is the image that's projected into our mind and we believe something off a stupid cartoon right now notice this now according to the scriptures there's no way that the teaching is right because first of all the serpent doesn't become a slytherin snake until after the curse because in genesis 3 1 he's not a serpent as we would think it as a snake now i want to just look at the characteristics of this serpent because i want to first of all shatter your theology that it was a snake wrapped around a tree and if i could shatter that theology then maybe you'll open your mind up enough to understand what god is actually saying here the first thing as i said is that the serpent here isn't a reptile well the bible said that he was more subtle than any beast of the field never said he was a sceptile identified as a beast so now i've taken your snake out of the tree and put him on the ground he stood at the head of all inferior animals for wisdom and understanding because the bible said in verse 1 of genesis 3 that the serpent was more stepped off and the word settle is cunning either sly intelligent whatever this was it was very intelligent it was very cunning it was very artful another thing about this serpent that i think is very important to point out is that he won't erect for this is implied in his punishment when he said in verse 14 and the lord god said unto them said because thou has done this to our curse above all caliber every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and the dust shall eat all the days of thy life so we know that by the curse he wasn't slithering before this because after the curse the part of the curse was upon thy belly shalt thou cross so prior prior to the fall the serpent stood erect he stood upright like a man and he was subtle he was cunning he was intelligent and we find that he was he was also endued with the gift of speech for the scriptures identifies that he had a conversation with him he was also endued with the gift of reason for we find him reasoning and disputing with eve he was very quick to respond to even verses four and five as in their conversation so he was reasoning everything she was saying it is also important to point out that these characteristics were very common to the serpent it wasn't something that just happened to show up one day because it is evident that even seen him walking wrecked like a man she had seen him talk and she had seen and seen him reason and there is no implication in the scripture that she was surprised or even intrigued that this serpent was talking to her now i don't know about you the rest of you sisters in here but i know my wife if she was walking through the garden one day and a serpent said hey my wife's not going to stand around to talk so it wasn't something that caught her by surprise it wasn't something that shocked her it wasn't something that she was just walking by and here the serpent begins to speak and to oh my god this thing's talking but eve had seen this before for these were the characteristics of the church this was how god created him you see how the serpent never been known to speak before his addressing eve it would have surely excited her and even filled her with caution hey you better believe if i'm walking through the woods and something that's never spoke to me starts speaking to me i'm going to be very cautious but eve had no doubt spoken to this serpent on prior occasions and this was quite normal for her because i also want to point out that the way the scripture is written it implies that this is only part of the conversation that he's had with the serpent at this particular conversation because notice how the conversation begins yeah it wasn't that this was just the beginning of a conversation but when moses goes back and god permits because remember when moses wrote this these people were dead and moses was seeing by vision and he was writing what god was permitting to see and he was writing just enough of history to give us insight to what took place back there every instance of what took place was not there but yet he'd give us just enough and now we can link it with everything else that's in the bible and begin to formulate an entire picture now i also want to just show you that that this in this conversation it seems to be the continuation of the discourse in which the preceding part of the conversation isn't given and the proof that the serpent and the proof that the serpent in the question was endued with the gift of reason and the speech for no surprise is testified on the part of me she just simply just kind of you know yeah well you know he's talking about something very casual there's no doubt she's spoken to him before this account now the serpent was almost human because he had a human characteristics about him now i wanted to say something here because science tells us that there's a missing link between the animal kingdom and the humans and i'll say this to you they will never find the sling because the church the curse changed it from a beast to a snake see i have already have a jump start on them because i know what the word of god said they're running around looking for it we already know what it is now remember that satan was cast to the earth for trying to overthrow god's kingdom because in revelation 12 and 9 the bible said there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against looser and his angels and he said he was cast out for there was no place found for him in heaven and soon as satan is cast out of heaven the first place we find satan is in the garden of eden because turn we did zeke of the 28th chapter the 13th first ezekiel 28 13. here's god speaking now to lucifer he said thus been in eden in the garden of god that's been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covenant the sod is a topaz and the dime of the world the onyx the jasper the sapphire the enemy cabunacle and gold and the workers ship without tablets and our pipes were prepared to be in the day that thou was created now here he is speaking to the devil and the first place when he says he said thou art spinning and eating the garden of god now i want to ask you this question now when god cast him out of heaven down to earth what was satan doing in eden let's go to isaiah 14. maybe this will answer the questions isaiah 14. notice now in these passages of scripture god gives us a look into the mind and into the heart of satan these scriptures reveal satan's intent and his purpose god breaks into discernment now and speaking to this devil he said power thou fallen from heaven o lucifer now god's asking the question how is it that you're falling son of a morning how have thou cut down to the ground which did us weaken the nations now notice now now he's going to tell why he fell for thou said in thine hearts i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god which the stars of god are the sons of god because remember what god told abraham he said look to the stars of the heaven and he said so shall i see thee i will exalt my throne above the stars of god above the sons of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the side of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high he said yet shalt thou be brought down to hell to the size of the pit notice there was a war in heaven because satan exalted his will above the will of god there shouldn't be but one will and that is the will of the word and if you've got anywhere that is contrary to this word you've got to get rid of that word because even jesus had to deny his own will in the garden when he said father not my will but thine will be done and here was satan that exalted his will above the will of god and now iniquity was found in his heart because he said in ezekiel he said that was perfect in the day that was created until iniquity was formed indeed but notice now god begins to give us insight into the very mind and the very heart of satan and notice now what was satan doing in eden verse 13 begins to give us understanding now for thou said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i would sit upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north notice now satan wanted everything that god had satan desired so much to be like god but he could not create he could only pervert creation god had children so satan desired children god had a seed so satan wanted to see because notice he said i in verse 14 i will be like the most high now i want to just inject this eve had the ability within her to produce life satan couldn't create on his own but eve had the ability of creation within her own world so satan goes to that source and this was as close to creating that satan can get so satan goes to the garden of eden and he incarnates himself into the serpent and went to eve so that he might create life now remember that satan was in eden already and had already been cursed so he already had a wicked life source now i want to just break this down to you now so you'll see something that maybe you've never seen before in verse 13 i want to read this scripture again but i want to focus on a phrase for thou said in the heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation now how are you going to do it he said i'm going to go to the side anymore now this word science in the hebrew comes from the hebrew word yaric which is y-a-r-e-k comes from the hebrew word yara and this word sides in the hebrew means something different than what you think it does in the union because in the hebrew the word yaric means the thigh the extreme part feminine the loins as a seat of pro-creative power it means the generative part and the word generation is having the ability to originate produce or procreate of or relating to the production of offspring and satan says i want to be like the most high i will exalt my throne above the sons of god who was the son of god adam was and he knew that god had children in the earth and satan desired to be like god but he could not create within himself so he went to the closest things he said i'll go to the skies and the others i'll go to the feminine to the thighs to the seat of procreative power i'll go to the generator parts and which it also meant the loins and the loins of the lord out of including the reproductive organ and this word north in the hebrew comes from a word that i cannot pronounce but it means the treasure or the secret place and satan says i'm going to do this and i'm going to the side of the north i'm going to the generative part and from there i will exalt my throne above the stars of god what do you think what's going on in the world today what do you think happened when cain and abel was on earth and king killed abel satan was trying to exalt his throne above the stars of god so satan was in eden using the serpent to beguile eat and produce life something that he couldn't do on her own you see through the woman satan once again seen an opportunity to have what god had and in genesis 3 notice this now genesis 3 again i hope you give me a watch more time i'm not going to ask for a little bit because i'd probably be lying but genesis 3 1. notice here now let's just actually let's just read in verse psalms let me see here let's just read it read it all the way down in verse 3 let's just read verse 3 for the sake of time but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die now this word touch this word touch in the hebrew comes from the hebrew word naga which is naga which means to touch or to lie with a woman it's in your go to your strong concordance you'll find these words yourself it means to lie with a woman and he tells them now not to touch it now notice in genesis 20 and 6 speaking to abimelech which took abraham's wife's share god shouted to him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the entire integrity of the heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i be not to touch her what is he doing he is identifying this word touch of sexual intercourse in proverbs 6 29 so he that goeth into his neighbor's wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent then in first corinthians 7 and 1 now concerning the things wherefore you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman so genesis 3 3 when speaking of touching is without doubt referring to a sexual intercourse between a man and a woman and we see by these scriptures that touch gives reference to such a relation as well as just to touch something shall we look at it even just a little bit farther let's look at genesis the third chapter the sixth verse now genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good food and that it was pleasant to the eyes now let's go ahead and give you a little insight on this this word pleasant there means lust a lustful appetizer so that it was pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise she took and the word took there and the hebrew means to marry or to take a why and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat now the eat here is speaking of a sexual act proverbs 30 and 20. proverbs the 30th chapter verse 20. notice here now proverbs 30 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eat uh and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wicked solomon is showing that this woman speaking of the acts of adulterous women in other words what he's saying is when a one when an adulterous woman a prostitute enters into sexual relations she wipe at their mouth which is what wife means to blot out of memory and saith i have done no week in other words she doesn't see her sexual asses anything that's wrong just said brother chris but i thought it was eating apples well let's go to song of solomon because if you want apples i'll give you apples i mean i'm not ashamed to give you apples because the bible says something about apples strongly solomon chapter 2 verses 1 to 6. notice here now song of solomon chapter 2 verse 1. this is the love story from christ comes right now i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valley as a lily among the farm so is my love among the daughters as the apple tree among the trees of wood so is my beloved among the sun i sat down under his shadow in other words that phrase there actually means i have become his spouse i sat down under his shadow she sat down underneath the apple tree and she's become his spouse i said another shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste and he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love stay me with flagons which is why comfort me which the word comfort there is to make me a bed comfort me with apples for i am sick of love and his left hand under my head and his right hand just embraced me now this is christ and the bride and solomon he wrote many love stories the roles of sharon and the lily of the valley was jesus in verse 4 it says he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love in other words he had dinner with her then he made love to her in verse 5 he gives her wine and with their intimacy and she declares that i am loved sick and in verse 6 it shows their intimacy while eating apples before she said he says his left hand is under my head and his right hand up and raising i don't know about you but i've never ate an apple that way this is a love scene a beauty well christ will embrace the girl which is justification he will kiss the girl which is sanctification and then he will make love to earth imparting his sea life which is the baptism of the holy ghost but yet it is identified and the whole relationship is identified in eating apples you gotta understand the bible is a parable you see eve committed an adulterous act with the serpent and then took what she had learned to adam and they did the same act and this simple act made them realize they were naked and i'll say this if eating apples lets people know they're naked we need to pass the apples out again amen go back to genesis 3 3 with me because i'm not done genesis 3 3 what are the fruit of the trees which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it bless ye now i want you to notice now of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden he says you shall not eat of it but touch it he's unless you shall die now we must understand that the bible is full of metaphors and a metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase that ordinarily designates one thing is used to designate another and here in genesis there was a fruit in the midst of the garden that was forbidden first of all it's important to point out the trees in the bible often refer to people i'm not going to read all the scriptures but i'll tell you whether that mark the 8th chapter 24th first you'll find when jesus healed the blind man of the sight jesus asked him what he said i see him walking psalms 52 and 8 you'll find again people identified as truth song of solomon the seventh chapter verses seven eight you'll find i'll be speaking as a people as palm trees then also in jeremiah 11 and 19 is to destroy the tree with the fruit which what he was actually declaring was destroyed the prophet and his teachings and so over and over again from the bible people was always identified as trees but this is the part that i want you to see that there was a fruit in the midst of the garden now go to song of solomon the fourth chapter song of solomon 4 beginning with the 12th verse because let's find out what this fruit in the midst of the garden was song of solomon 4 verse 12 a garden in calls is my sister my spouse a garden in clothes is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain seal thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits camphor with spaghetti saffron and calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices a fountain of gardens a well of living water the stream from lebanon here solomon is describing his spouse as a garden and he says now verse 15 of fountain of gardens a well of living one of the stream from lebanon awake o northwind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruit now in verse 12 solomon identifies a woman as a garden and this woman that he is speaking up here is the bride of christ and the reason why we know it's the bride of christ is because in this garden it is enclosed which this word enclosed is it's it's locked and inaccessible to all but the owner in other words when it comes to his spouse to his garden to his wife she's she is inaccessible to anybody else what he's saying is that his bride will not commit adultery on him that's what he's saying and he said a spring shut up a fountain shield and when he speaks of this fountain being sealed he is saying that she is chased she's a pure virgin none has ever entered this garden the seal of this fountain hasn't been broken she has preserved the seal of her virginity she's untouched that's what he's saying concerning this garden then in verse 16 notice what the bride calls now the bride calls for the bridegroom to come and eat of his pleasant fruit notice now let my beloved come into his garden notice in verse 12 he said a guardian encloses my sister my spouse so let my beloved come into his wife let him come to his bride let him come to his woman and eat of his pleasant fruit in other words then she is telling him that there is a fruit in the midst of the garden and she is inviting him to come to her what is she designing she was designed to be impregnated with his seed life now notice now genesis 3rd chapter the 13th verse told us what she says now 13 and the lord god said unto the woman what is that devout john and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat this word begotten here in the hebrew means seduce to lead astray morally seduce utterly you know she said the serpent morally seduced me and she was saying that he polluted her and notice now as soon as she says in verse 13 in verse 3 we know that there was a fruit in the midst of the garden that was to be untouched and now in verse 13 she said the serpent beguiled me he seduced me he pulled he polluted me then in verse 15 as soon as she declares i've been begotten i've been morally seduced utterly two seeds show up in which he said and i will put enmity between thee and the one in between thy sea enter see it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his head now notice the serpent has a seed because that is who he's speaking to and lord god said in the seventh and verse 14 because thou has done this above all the cattle above every beast in the field upon my belly shall they go in the dust shout thou eat all the days of our life notice he's addressing the serpent in verse 14 continues right on in verse 15 and i will put enmity between thee speaking of the serpent and the woman between thy sea the serpent that beguiled her ends up with a signal now that's what my bible says and if you're looking at the bible you're just saying the same thing now maybe contrary to everything you've been taught but it's still saying but it's still saying something different because the serpent hasn't seen genesis 3 15 identified that he does so the fact is that eve was impregnated by both adam and the serpent now we're medical reports and i wish i would have brought it because i actually had an article at home in johnson city tennessee where i live and i wish i'd have brought it now but i don't have it but medical reports have proven that a woman can be pregnant by twins by different fathers there has been numerous of cases where a woman in one particular case of the case that i have the article on is where a black man and a white man slept with the same woman on the same day and she ended up with twins one baby come out black one they become that white it don't happen all the time but it does happen and it's proven scientifically now eve was pregnant with twins one was adam's child the other was a serpent's child you see cain and abel were twins remember but matthew 13 the parable of the sowers in matthew 13 there is two seeds in one field two seeds in one field by two different showers now what was jesus identified he was identifying something all the way back in genesis to try to get the disciples to understand why they could see the revelation of the word and the rest of them couldn't notice genesis 4 i'm gonna i'm going to hurry up now and just come to a few more points and we'll stop genesis 4 verses 1 to 4. so many areas that you really need to emphasize a lot of things on but you just for the sake of time you can't do it genesis 4 1-4 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear came and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep that came with the tiller of the ground but notice here now i'll just stop right there adam knew eve once and she can see there was one conception but two children notice here now what it says again and adam knew eve his wife and she can see and bear came and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel notice now one conception adam knew the word new there is a sexual relationship i can show you all the way through the bible and adam knew even his wife and she conceived in their cain and said i've gotten a man for one and she again bear one conception two children by adam don't notice this now in verse two notice it said and she again bear there was one conception until verse 25 comes notice now in verse 25 what it says and adam knew his wife again in verse two in verse one adam neuer she produced two children the next time we find adam having sexual relations with his wife is in verse 25 when adam knew his wife again and she bear seth and seth was born so now i wanted to say these and i'm going to come to a place to just drop all of these things that i've been saying and just bring them to a head now cain was not adam's son because he was the seed of the serpent how many believe the bible is infallible now notice in first john 3 and 12. first john 3 and 12. first john 3 12. notice this now not as cain who was up that wicked one now notice adam was not uh not the wicked one satan was the wicked one because remember matthew 7 verses 17 to 20 a good tree good fruit a corrupt tree corrupt fruit you'll never blame cain on adam right adam or abel was adam's child and in genesis 3 15 you'll start seeing the enmity between the two seeds and this is the product of their fathers the same war that was in heaven in in revelations 12 and 9 now comes down to earth and is now being manifested in the seed line between cain and abel and through cain satan is going to try to exalt his kingdom above the stars of god cain offered to god the thing that was cursed because he didn't have the revelation like about i mentioned that to you this morning now i want to go to genesis the fifth chapter and i'm going to show you just emphasize some more points that cain was not abel's adam's son rather king was not adam's son genesis 5 verse 1-3 now notice here now this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man and the likeness of god made him valentino created them blessed and called their name adam and they when they recreate adam lived a hundred and thirty years and he got a son in his own likeness and after his image he called his name seth now the word this when it says this is the book of the generation of adam the word this means this is it there is no other there never could be another this is it this is the general book of the generation of adam now it is important also to see in genesis the third chapter verse 20 that the bible said and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living but you will never find any place in the bible that declares adam to be the father of all living but it does say that evil is the mother of all leaders living cain is never mentioned in adam's lineage he's never mentioned in adam's reigns because he isn't adam's son jude the 14th verse jude 14 notice now and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints now i wanna ask you something do you believe the bible is an exact record and it cannot and it cannot contradict itself and so here the jude under inspiration begins to prophesy and said enoch also the seventh from adam now i want you to go to luke the third chapter we're almost done we're just hanging this a little bit longer luke the third chapter verses 37 and 38 now notice this now which was the son of methuselah which was the son of the now if you'll start counting from enoch now here's the generation of adam the genealogy of adam and remember this is it there is no other never could be another this is it and under this genealogy you will find that it is from enoch which was the son of jared which was the son of melio which was the son of canaan which of the son of enoch which was the son of said which was the son of adam which was the son of god from adam to south you'll count it you'll start you'll see one two three four five six seven which makes enoch prophecy right enoch also the trevor from adam all right when he says it when he says this now when jude prophesied this enoch also the seventh from adam so now enoch is exactly the seventh from adam but if cain were adam's son then they would break the continuity of the word now cain in fact had his own lineage genesis the fourth chapter if you want to look at it later genesis 4 17 to 23 you'll find out that cain had his own lineage he never was even in the lineage of adam because he never was adam's son because a serpent morally seduced utterly eve and then she ended up with his seed so the bible said now let's go to second corinthians 11. second corinthians 11. there's a few more scriptures verses two and three notice here now here paul is speaking now concerning the church but notice how he begins to address the situation of the church and notice what he reflects back upon for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but notice verse 3 now but i fear lest by any means of the serpent begotten even through his subtility so should your mind be corrupted to this from the simplicity that is in christ in verse two spaul speaks to presenting us as chaste virgins virgins to christ with one husband remember the bible said that eve took of the fruit and the word took there was to marry or to enter into marriage in other words he actually took her a second husband more or less because she took him to something that was only giving rights to her husband and here paul now addressing this he said but i fearless by any means the serpent begotted and he speaks presenting us as a chaste virgin to christ but in verse three said that he fears that we would be begotten the same as he was you see paul was afraid that the church would lose their virginity the same as eve did when she walked out on adam and committed adultery and this is why eve was in the transgression and not adam first timothy 2 14 and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now why was adam not to see but the eve but the woman was deceit and she was in the transgression this word deceived here in the greek means to wrong from safety help and virtue to cheat to seduce holy in other words adam was not deceived adam did not cheat on his spouse but the woman being deceived was in the transgression adam was not deceived because evil was his wife and he had rights to her body as a husband and eve committed an adulterous act she was the one who roamed from virtue let me just say this to you eating an apple never caused one pregnancy i want to ask you a few questions as i close now if it wasn't sex in genesis then why did god curse the woman if she ate someone and god cursed him now here's another question to really think deep on now why was the covenant that god made with abraham in his private party because he come to abraham and give abraham a seal of circumcision now god could have god could have given him an azerite vow let your hair grow along god could have put a put something in his place god could have done anything but when god come to abraham i made a covenant with abraham and was telling abraham i'm going to take this is my seed life god comes to abraham and he says i want to make a covenant with you but i want it to be a steal of circumcision i'll answer the question for you because that was where the seed passed from and the blood that come from the sill of circumcision was a sign that the blood of christ would cover adam's seedling one more question composing this why did jesus have to come before her the answer he bypassed the sexual unions
