[34:43] how nice it is to be back in house let's
[34:45] see the weather was agreeable coming up
[34:47] the road nice and clear and all that I
[34:49] I'm an old Ohio boy even though I live
[34:51] in Tennessee and most of my people come
[34:53] from Tennessee I asked for the Jessie I
[34:55] said well once the roads look like he
[34:57] said nice and clear I said praise Laurel
[34:58] what I want to hear a man that's that's
[35:00] the way but so thankful to be here I
[35:03] thought I was going to have me another
[35:04] Smith for a Bible this week I was
[35:06] supposed to pretty sure your brother
[35:07] this coming weekend and Napoleon but we
[35:10] rearranged things just a little bit my
[35:11] pastor and I say this for this purpose
[35:14] on they they found a lump in his
[35:17] mother's long and she'd had cancer once
[35:20] before and so he's making a trip next
[35:22] week to go up I think they got some
[35:23] testing or some kind of a thing we use
[35:26] of course bring you greetings from the
[35:28] church their Murphysboro
[35:29] but ask you also to pray if you would as
[35:32] brother goes up there to visit his mom
[35:33] that you know the Lord would just bring
[35:35] the test back negative no problems no
[35:37] nothing like that
[35:38] so but anyhow Willa will see brother can
[35:40] the following weekend which is that
[35:42] right in the new year and so god bless
[35:45] you and we certainly we wish you a Merry
[35:49] Christmas but not like the song with all
[35:51] the Santa Clauses them other things
[35:52] we're talking about Jesus this time of
[35:54] year in and we should be talking about
[35:57] him every time of year I don't care what
[35:58] the season is whether it's blazing hot
[36:00] or freezing cold he should be the reason
[36:03] for every season I think and I sure
[36:05] appreciate the Lord glad to have my wife
[36:07] with me this is a good time for you
[36:09] schoolteachers you can kind of kick back
[36:11] let your hair down a little bit in it
[36:12] and glad to have her with me and so
[36:14] we're we're thankful we made it in real
[36:17] safely and come in last night and the
[36:20] Lord helping us we had a real nice trip
[36:22] in and
[36:23] just as I was going this morning I got a
[36:26] couple things on my heart that I was
[36:27] gonna try to bring and I was looking
[36:30] down at some of these notes now God
[36:31] helped me I'm gonna try to get done
[36:34] within you know today today today you
[36:37] know today ends at midnight tonight so
[36:39] we'll just see how it goes but I got so
[36:42] much hay on the floor so I hope you come
[36:44] hungry a man this morning feed on the
[36:46] word of the Lord and I don't know how
[36:48] long it'll take me to get out but I'm
[36:49] gonna try to watch the clock as quick as
[36:51] I can to get out and we're gonna have
[36:54] probably lunch over to Giant Eagle or
[36:55] whatever you call that place over yonder
[36:57] and and and and then come back eat at
[37:00] the Eagle and then Eagles come back and
[37:01] eat again Amen that's right
[37:03] and so we thank the Lord now I just want

[51:43] this morning
[51:44] that if you're a part of God's great
[51:46] economy and you got the Holy Ghost this

[51:51] eyes up to heaven and say father I have
[51:55] a need this morning father
[51:57] we've got trouble in our home we got
[51:59] problems at work we need your grace we
[52:02] need your strength you know my Bible
[52:04] told me and if a man will call upon his
[52:07] name he will hear from heaven and he can
[52:10] pray he can talk to God and God promised
[52:14] that he would hear the words coming out
[52:16] of his mouth I wonder this morning would
[52:19] you be able to say but then I've got a
[52:21] need this morning I guess something in
[52:22] my heart something I need from God I
[52:24] wonder if you raised your hand this
[52:26] morning to say I'm testifying right now
[52:29] I believe if I pray God can hear my
[52:31] prayers hallelujah
[52:36] [Music]

[53:58] something I can do

[54:13] to know you can prove me all you gotta
[54:17] do is pray and Jesus Jesus will heal
[54:27] until the walls come down until there's
[54:32] healing all around that's something I do
[54:40] yes I can

[55:19] thank you Lord bless His Holy Name can
[55:25] we stand together this one bless His
[55:29] Holy Name aren't you glad you can pray
[55:33] amen it's become quite a bit more real
[55:36] to me over the last few weeks and just
[55:40] little things God let you go through you
[55:43] know sometimes you kind of wonder about
[55:46] life and how things go sometimes you
[55:47] know and sometimes you do doubt wonder
[55:49] and sometimes you have a lot of
[55:51] curiosities but we have a real promise
[55:53] this morning take heart Church take
[55:55] courage if you pray you'll hear your
[55:57] prayers I believe that you've got your
[56:01] Bible Luke chapter 13 verse 27 and then
[56:04] I want to pick up Matthew 12 and 21 I
[56:07] want to take two places this morning the
[56:08] Lord helping us pardon me pardon me and
[56:15] the Lord giving us the strength to get
[56:18] through as much of this message this
[56:20] morning as we can get through I want to
[56:22] try to get as much in as I can and I'm
[56:24] not going to be lengthy now but I'm just
[56:25] going to try to try to get it in and I I
[56:27] teased you about preaching long and then
[56:29] and then I only preached about an hour
[56:31] and ten minutes after all their singing
[56:33] and everything so really I know that
[56:34] long but anyhow we we want to try to
[56:38] take for a thought this morning and I I
[56:39] may have used this here a number of
[56:41] years ago even if the over at the old
[56:42] building but I've kind of given an
[56:46] update a reboot and slap some new paint
[56:48] on the walls and give it a little
[56:49] renovation and and and it's really been
[56:51] a blessing to me over the last several
[56:53] weeks that I've been bringing this and I
[56:55] want to use the subject now if you
[56:57] recognize this that I've preached this
[56:58] before it's a different thought but the
[57:00] same title I'm just going a different
[57:02] direction with it and that is the fear
[57:04] of being rejected and the joy of being
[57:08] accepted the fear of being rejected and
[57:12] the joy of being accepted some of y'all
[57:15] might recognize that I think I preached
[57:17] that several number of years ago way
[57:18] back but we we were going a different
[57:21] way with it and
[57:22] and I like oh brother jewel Forney you
[57:25] know he's an evangelist he's not a
[57:26] pastor and so he'll go somewhere and say
[57:28] this is part four of a sermon serious I
[57:30] think it's something like that I like
[57:32] that but anyhow Luke 13 verse 27 now
[57:36] what I want to do for the first
[57:37] scripture is I want to take the negative
[57:39] side of this okay and I want to look at
[57:41] the rejection part and then let's read
[57:44] Matthew 12 21 for the positive side
[57:47] which is the joy of being accepted now
[57:50] Luke 13 27 now notice these words you
[57:54] shall say I tell you I know you not
[57:57] whence ye are depart from me all you
[58:02] workers of iniquity now the word for
[58:04] depart here is to draw away to cause to
[58:09] withdraw to remove to withdraw from one
[58:12] or to fall away now you'll notice that
[58:16] terminology fall away this is what Paul
[58:19] spoke of when he said in the last days
[58:21] there would be a great falling away and
[58:24] that's what we've seen in the hour we're
[58:25] living is a falling away now Matthew 12
[58:29] 21 now here comes the positive side of
[58:32] this or the joy the first was the fear
[58:34] and now the joy now let's look at this
[58:37] Matthew 12 21 short little scriptures
[58:40] here I'll let you be seated just a
[58:41] moment and you can get settled in and
[58:44] we're gonna really dig deep in this the
[58:46] Lord helping us this morning and I just
[58:49] want to try to take a couple of these
[58:51] verses like this hold your Bible by you
[58:53] now because we're gonna go we're gonna
[58:54] go through several places this morning
[58:56] god help us like the Bible amen I like
[58:59] it too Matthew 12 21 and in his name
[59:02] shall the Gentiles trust now the meaning
[59:06] of this word trust is things hope for
[59:10] sound familiar to anybody as in Hebrews
[59:14] 11:1 faith is a substance of things
[59:17] hoped for so our faith must be married
[59:21] to hope in order to be profitable
[59:25] fruitful faith alone don't do it hope
[59:29] alone don't do it you must marry the two
[59:31] together in order to produce the results
[59:34] that faith will bring now
[59:36] let's ask the Lord to help us if you
[59:37] will bow your heads with me just a
[59:39] moment and you've already raised your
[59:41] hands Satan to the Lord this morning
[59:42] during the song that you had a need and
[59:44] now we want to ask the Lord to recognize
[59:46] those needs if we can my hands up to
[59:48] Lord Jesus we love you so much
[59:50] we counted a privilege to be standing
[59:52] here and what I read your prophets say
[59:54] the other day the feeding place this is
[59:56] the Shepherd's spot where not a man now
[59:59] but Lord your prophet said you come to
[1:00:02] this place to feed your hungry sheep how
[1:00:05] we love you how we adore you and Lord
[1:00:08] Jesus as we come before the presence and
[1:00:10] the throne of God today we do so in the
[1:00:12] name of Jesus Christ and we're asking
[1:00:14] you Lord to recognize every need amongst
[1:00:17] this body may the Holy Spirit we pray
[1:00:19] give to us what we are asking for out of
[1:00:22] the depths of our heart God to grant to
[1:00:24] us the desires of our heart and greater
[1:00:26] than all things as we seek first the
[1:00:29] kingdom of God we pray that you will add
[1:00:32] to our lives the very revelation of
[1:00:35] yourself and ourselves as a part of this
[1:00:38] great truth of the last day how we love
[1:00:40] you we thank you for this little body
[1:00:42] may you speak to us and recognize every
[1:00:44] uplift at hand this morning as we come
[1:00:46] to the word now we're asking that you'll
[1:00:48] anoint us and that you'll speak through
[1:00:50] us and receive through us in the name of
[1:00:52] Jesus Christ we pray and the saints of
[1:00:54] God said a man you may be seated may the
[1:00:57] Lord bless you real good now
[1:00:59] I want to I want to just introduce to
[1:01:04] you for a moment so I take my jacket off
[1:01:05] amen a fella can't work and eat in a
[1:01:09] jacket I'm gonna be working you're gonna
[1:01:10] be eating a manís way it goes now just
[1:01:14] you just to kind of bring this in a
[1:01:16] little bit about this rejection part
[1:01:18] first now what I want to point your
[1:01:20] attention to on this rejection is not
[1:01:23] necessarily life rejection or people
[1:01:26] rejection or Church rejection and we all
[1:01:28] experience those type of things to one
[1:01:30] degree or another but this rejection is
[1:01:33] on the level of between you and God and
[1:01:36] we can speak about different types of
[1:01:38] rejections such as you know say a
[1:01:41] college student trying to get into a
[1:01:42] certain college they send them what they
[1:01:44] call a rejection letter maybe a man
[1:01:47] would ask a woman to marry him and
[1:01:49] she would reject his offer to her
[1:01:51] marriage and his proposal say trying to
[1:01:54] do certain things in life file for a
[1:01:57] grant or patent item and somebody reject
[1:02:00] now those type of rejections they have
[1:02:02] emotional responses of course but this
[1:02:05] type of rejection is something that lays
[1:02:08] even deeper in the hearts of man and
[1:02:10] woman it goes even deeper than just
[1:02:12] necessarily an emotional response but
[1:02:15] this is a awareness if you will of a
[1:02:18] spiritual rejection from God and when a
[1:02:21] person reaches this place of depart as
[1:02:25] we read there in Luke 13 verse 27 about
[1:02:27] depart from me now this word depart
[1:02:30] which is fall away it points us to an
[1:02:34] understanding that those that will
[1:02:36] quote-unquote fall away now this is not
[1:02:39] what we would say every day misgivings
[1:02:41] and ups and downs and turmoils of life
[1:02:43] but this departing here is those that
[1:02:47] are referenced in Hebrews chapter 6
[1:02:49] where Paul tells us that they'll come
[1:02:51] right up to the border taste of the
[1:02:53] powers of the world to come partake of
[1:02:55] heavenly gifts and gift the Holy Spirit
[1:02:58] and then of course fall away from that
[1:03:01] place of going even further into the
[1:03:03] blessings of God or into their position
[1:03:06] as a believer and we realize that this
[1:03:08] group of individuals that fall away the
[1:03:10] Bible said very clearly that there was
[1:03:12] no way that they could renew themselves
[1:03:13] unto repentance because now they become
[1:03:16] guilty of crucifying the effects of the
[1:03:19] gospel to their lives as you see friends
[1:03:22] many people can crucify Jesus stand and
[1:03:25] crucify Jesus at crucifixion and you
[1:03:28] know mock him and pulled his beard many
[1:03:29] of them stood there and done such things
[1:03:31] but a greater crucifixion has taken
[1:03:34] place in the last hours than what took
[1:03:36] place on Golgotha there was only a small
[1:03:39] population of people that was gathered
[1:03:41] around the Israelites and the different
[1:03:43] ones and you know was responsible for
[1:03:45] putting Jesus to death by capital
[1:03:47] punishment but an even greater
[1:03:49] crucifixion has taken place than what
[1:03:52] that was because not only was it maybe
[1:03:55] the thousands that was gathered on the
[1:03:57] hillside that day or those that would go
[1:03:59] up to see the criminals just like we
[1:04:00] would pass by a jail cell or see
[1:04:03] police cargo bias they would be passing
[1:04:05] by Golgotha they'd see the men hanging
[1:04:07] in the tree there might have been you
[1:04:09] know might have been maybe ten thousand
[1:04:10] people will say that would view Jesus
[1:04:13] and these criminals hanging there on
[1:04:15] guard off the hill but you imagine since
[1:04:17] that hour coming to the last hours when
[1:04:20] the full word has been restored to the
[1:04:23] body of believers not just thousands of
[1:04:26] people but untold millions has crucified
[1:04:29] the Lord Jesus again the effects of the
[1:04:32] Lord Jesus by crucifying the gospel
[1:04:35] today and realized Mother ma'am indicted
[1:04:37] this generation in 1963 and brought an
[1:04:39] indictment to the whole world and it
[1:04:41] goes spans for the entire generation as
[1:04:43] a crucifixion those that have crucified
[1:04:47] Him out of the churches and you realize
[1:04:49] that as leaders will stand up in the
[1:04:51] platform and maybe take an individual
[1:04:53] that believes you know a certain certain
[1:04:55] way of looking at the supernatural and
[1:04:57] maybe he doesn't allow the supernatural
[1:04:59] to operate in its full abilities and
[1:05:02] what more and then when you come ask him
[1:05:04] about it show him a scripture he said oh
[1:05:05] we don't believe that today that was for
[1:05:07] another time well in that very respect
[1:05:09] they have put to death the effects of
[1:05:12] the Lord Jesus
[1:05:13] again rightfully they have crucified
[1:05:14] again right there in the house of God
[1:05:17] any church that Noah kill the gifts any
[1:05:19] church that will kill the prayer life or
[1:05:22] kill Revelation or a moving or a flow of
[1:05:25] the Spirit of God that church is guilty
[1:05:28] of crucifying the effects of the gospel
[1:05:31] now in an individual's life it's very
[1:05:33] much the same way take an individual for
[1:05:36] example a person that will hear the
[1:05:38] gospel in some manner that individual
[1:05:41] has a choice that they can make either
[1:05:42] they can believe the Lord forgive me or
[1:05:46] they can trust in the Lord that can have
[1:05:48] some kind of a confidence in the Lord
[1:05:50] and allow the Lord Jesus to move in
[1:05:52] their life and a great degree or they
[1:05:55] can crucify Paul said Hebrews six the
[1:05:57] effect of that word in their life and
[1:06:00] how do we do that when Ram tells us in
[1:06:02] greatest battle ever fought 1962 how
[1:06:04] that a person by taking the channel of
[1:06:07] reasoning can actually shut off or
[1:06:10] paralyze the effects of the gospel in
[1:06:13] their life did you realize that you can
[1:06:15] put brakes
[1:06:16] deity by disbelief you can put brakes on
[1:06:19] deity by pulling back your own wheel
[1:06:22] your own way your own thoughts and what
[1:06:24] more and placing that before the word so
[1:06:27] a person could reject the presence of
[1:06:29] the Lord and ultimately be rejected by
[1:06:32] God now let's just understand something
[1:06:34] right now oh really it's not the Lord so
[1:06:36] much rejecting them as much as it is
[1:06:38] them that is rejecting the Lord because
[1:06:40] you see brother God will give you every
[1:06:42] opportunity Jesus will give you every
[1:06:44] opportunity to serve God in that right
[1:06:46] he will allow you to serve Him to live
[1:06:49] for him to rise to all these untold
[1:06:51] levels and unseen levels of grace and
[1:06:53] mercy if you will allow him to do it but
[1:06:56] what stops God has nothing to do with
[1:06:59] you know whether I oh you know our Lord
[1:07:02] I'm a good Pro none of that none of that
[1:07:03] kind of stuff really matters when it
[1:07:05] comes to God he don't look at our
[1:07:07] goodness he don't look at our our
[1:07:08] abilities or our ability to achieve you
[1:07:11] don't look at our brains you don't look
[1:07:13] at her education level he looks at one
[1:07:15] thing and one thing only and is that the
[1:07:18] idea of surrender in our life if we are
[1:07:20] able to surrender to Him you understand
[1:07:23] that to be a Christian means you've got
[1:07:26] to learn how to surrender to God it does
[1:07:29] not come by study it does not come my
[1:07:31] prayer you can pray every day and every
[1:07:34] night and fail to surrender and your
[1:07:36] prayers are meaningless that's right it
[1:07:39] all comes down to surrender so when he
[1:07:41] says here depart from me all ye that
[1:07:44] work iniquity I remember the people that
[1:07:46] he's referring to here are not
[1:07:48] individuals with ups and downs in
[1:07:50] everyday life these are those that have
[1:07:52] fallen away or crucified the effects of
[1:07:55] the gospel in their life now if you have
[1:07:58] your Bibles let's turn to first John
[1:08:00] chapter 2 verse 28 now as you're taking
[1:08:03] notes I see pens and pencils out which
[1:08:04] is good I want to give you some articles
[1:08:07] that I'm going to use or themes if you
[1:08:09] will that I'm going to use to kindly lay
[1:08:12] out the tracks of this message you know
[1:08:14] driving down the road you got milepost
[1:08:15] to kind of tell you about where you are
[1:08:17] well I'm gonna give you some milepost
[1:08:18] this morning to go by and some of these
[1:08:20] phrases and phraseology is that I'm
[1:08:22] gonna give to you they're not things I
[1:08:24] read out of Hagee's book or Osteen or
[1:08:26] knew these other guys these are things I
[1:08:27] just put together while I was praying
[1:08:29] and studying the mess it's now I want to
[1:08:32] just give you my first article now this
[1:08:33] is what we're gonna look at on this fear
[1:08:35] of being rejected and this joy of being
[1:08:37] accepted first and that is this we must
[1:08:40] have confidence in him to hear our
[1:08:43] prayers
[1:08:44] that's article number one we must have
[1:08:46] confidence in him to hear our prayers
[1:08:49] now that in itself is a gigantic thing I
[1:08:52] mean I just literally handed you a
[1:08:53] mountain and asked you to climb up it
[1:08:55] without a man no climbing gear you ain't
[1:08:57] got no cleats on you ain't got nothing
[1:08:58] but by the grace of God I believe that
[1:09:01] if we can learn that have a confidence
[1:09:03] about Jesus hearing our prayers because
[1:09:06] you see this we're gonna read in just a
[1:09:07] moment that God can give us the ability
[1:09:10] to believe and give us the confidence to
[1:09:12] believe that he can give us our answer
[1:09:16] to our prayers or give us our desires or
[1:09:18] ever what you want to say we believe God
[1:09:20] can make these things happen if brother
[1:09:23] Jesse we will work according to the
[1:09:25] outline if you will or the law of which
[1:09:28] prayer works by let's remember this is
[1:09:31] not blab it and grab it name it and
[1:09:32] claim it come on somebody hey man this
[1:09:36] is not I'm just gonna ask God and he's
[1:09:38] going to give it to me no matter what
[1:09:39] just like the electricity works in this
[1:09:41] room this morning amen you have to have
[1:09:43] a current you have to have a certain
[1:09:44] flow you couldn't take the electricity
[1:09:47] and push it down a little pipe like
[1:09:49] water goes if the current won't carry
[1:09:51] you couldn't take a piece of round wood
[1:09:53] and run electricity through that wood
[1:09:55] and get the current to carry it there's
[1:09:57] a law there is a mechanism and there's a
[1:09:59] law that brings that electricity of
[1:10:01] these lights you don't think so just get
[1:10:03] you a little wire clipper and go up
[1:10:05] there and cut one of them wires and to
[1:10:06] flip your switch on and on and on and
[1:10:08] see if the light ever comes on and
[1:10:10] remember that's the way it is with
[1:10:12] prayer we can pray and pray and pray and
[1:10:14] pray and pray flip flip flip flip flip
[1:10:16] on off on off on off but if we're not
[1:10:18] working according to the law of God the
[1:10:21] prayer cannot be answered now we must
[1:10:24] have confidence in him to hear our
[1:10:25] prayer said hey man
[1:10:26] now watch this in first John chapter 2
[1:10:28] verse 28 now just take this beginning
[1:10:31] part if you will on little children
[1:10:33] everybody see that and now little
[1:10:35] children right here this first little
[1:10:37] part right here children now that word
[1:10:39] children if you'll stop for just a
[1:10:41] moment and think that word children put
[1:10:43] in the
[1:10:43] Bible there that's not just placed in
[1:10:45] there as we'd say for filler that's not
[1:10:47] just words that John use to throw in
[1:10:50] there just to occupy space or make it
[1:10:52] sound flower tea now that's regular
[1:10:54] writing I mean when we're writing books
[1:10:55] or whatever we're trying to write or
[1:10:57] dissertations or thesis or whatever you
[1:10:59] know we put in little words to make it
[1:11:00] pretty and make it sound good and all
[1:11:02] that but remember the Bible is wrote in
[1:11:05] a manner that it is inspired by the Holy
[1:11:07] Spirit and so when he says children
[1:11:09] there is a purpose and a meaning behind
[1:11:12] that word not a meaning like what I
[1:11:14] would choose if I said you know a
[1:11:17] supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Amen
[1:11:19] like the Disney movie there's a purpose
[1:11:21] behind him nonsensical words there's a
[1:11:23] purpose if I was to say you know
[1:11:26] retrogressive or if I used a word like
[1:11:29] pneumatology have you don't even know
[1:11:30] what I mean talking about a meant but
[1:11:32] some of them words they have meanings
[1:11:34] behind them they have thoughts behind
[1:11:36] those words that people are using those
[1:11:39] terms to convey a message well when you
[1:11:41] read the Bible you're not looking at a
[1:11:43] man's thought behind the word hallelujah
[1:11:45] but you're looking at God's thought
[1:11:47] behind that word
[1:11:48] praise the Lord when God says children
[1:11:51] there's a meaning behind that word hey
[1:11:54] man and what is that children same as
[1:11:56] Jesus said in the Lord's Prayer our
[1:11:58] Father I like what Spurgeon said one
[1:12:00] time he said well when he said our
[1:12:02] Father he said our he said meaning that
[1:12:04] it wasn't just Jesus saying I have a
[1:12:06] father but he was saying we have a
[1:12:09] father and if we have a father then
[1:12:11] there must be children for that father
[1:12:13] to be called father by so if it is
[1:12:16] children then that means that we are not
[1:12:19] just here by happenstance get that
[1:12:21] through your mind you are not just here
[1:12:23] because you're a product of your mother
[1:12:25] and father but you are here amen with a
[1:12:28] divine purpose from Almighty God there's
[1:12:31] a reason you can say Amen little
[1:12:34] children when he says little children
[1:12:35] that means that you're a believer at
[1:12:37] every stage it means there's a child of
[1:12:40] God there's not a speck of doubt on the
[1:12:42] inside of me there can't be if there is
[1:12:44] I'm not a child huh
[1:12:47] because if I'm born again and I am a
[1:12:49] child of God then that means I'm a
[1:12:51] believer God has confirmed my
[1:12:54] hey by saying you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] I'm saying I am a believer 100 percent
[1:13:01] there not one IOT this off not one not
[1:13:05] one I believe 99.99% that little bit
[1:13:07] caused all that death but if you're a
[1:13:09] child if you're talking about child is
[1:13:11] the Bible that means everything there's
[1:13:13] not a spot there's not a wrinkle there's
[1:13:15] not nothing in your faith it's perfect
[1:13:17] before God
[1:13:18] now friends that ought to encourage you
[1:13:20] and if you listen to me close this
[1:13:21] morning you're going to think it in your
[1:13:23] life and you go to looking back on
[1:13:24] different things you've done and ways
[1:13:25] you've acted and things you've said and
[1:13:27] I trust as you go back through there and
[1:13:29] the devil tries to point you to areas in
[1:13:31] your life where you've done this that or
[1:13:33] the other and try to tell you you're a
[1:13:34] doubter and you don't believe I just
[1:13:36] want you to point that old ugly face
[1:13:38] thing to this little word up here
[1:13:39] children this morning put it right back
[1:13:41] on him and say if I am a child of God
[1:13:43] then I am a believer no matter what
[1:13:46] doubt may creep in my mind no matter
[1:13:48] what fears may attack me no matter how I
[1:13:50] may get weak in my human faith if I am a
[1:13:53] child I am a believer in every stage of
[1:13:56] my walk with God I love to say this
[1:13:58] sister Wendy at no time have I ever been
[1:14:00] an unbeliever once I was a child once I
[1:14:04] was born at no time have I ever been an
[1:14:06] unbeliever Amen there not a website
[1:14:09] powerful enough to pull me out
[1:14:11] come on somebody him a man there are not
[1:14:14] enough big preachers to fall and take
[1:14:15] the name of Jesus Christ off their
[1:14:17] churches they ain't enough men running
[1:14:18] off with piano players and deacons
[1:14:20] running off with Trustees wives or not
[1:14:22] they never that just stopped me from
[1:14:24] serving God I'm a believer at every
[1:14:26] stage of my walk with God hallelujah oh
[1:14:29] you say but it's bad is bad yes it might
[1:14:32] be bad for the world but remember the
[1:14:34] world is sealed out if you're a child
[1:14:35] and Christ is sealed in hallelujah
[1:14:39] all but you see all the surround me I
[1:14:41] know that surround me but if I am a
[1:14:43] child
[1:14:44] I am hid away with Jesus Christ in a
[1:14:47] secret place oh praise the Lord and
[1:14:50] hallelujah amen if that'll make you
[1:14:52] shout or shout you're shot he's broken a
[1:14:54] man I'm glad you come to church get it
[1:14:56] fix a little bit now watch this little
[1:14:58] children abide in him that when he shall
[1:15:02] appear we may have but
[1:15:07] confidence don't don't miss that little
[1:15:10] word right there because if you break it
[1:15:13] up just a little bit what do you see
[1:15:15] confide now there's a secret behind this
[1:15:19] word the word confidence as it appears
[1:15:23] here in the Bible and also in different
[1:15:26] translations of this would say firm
[1:15:28] trust boldness is another one of these
[1:15:32] meanings perfect way moves translation
[1:15:36] says have a perfect confidence in him oh
[1:15:40] I know I'm turning you upside down
[1:15:42] already ain't I because in your mind you
[1:15:45] they met all the times that Jane trusted
[1:15:46] the Lord like you should but remember
[1:15:48] we're not talking about what takes place
[1:15:49] in this flesh we're talking about what's
[1:15:50] in that soul and that soul if it's
[1:15:53] sealed by God there's nothing can shake
[1:15:54] it Amen we either believe the Bible or
[1:15:58] we don't the Bible said once you're
[1:15:59] sealed with the Holy Spirit you're
[1:16:00] sealed in the day of your Redemption
[1:16:01] there's no way I can escape this there's
[1:16:04] no way it can escape me if I am a part
[1:16:06] of this then I am confident that God can
[1:16:10] do what he promised all right now watch
[1:16:13] another meaning to this word I love this
[1:16:16] here it means to speak fearlessly
[1:16:19] woo glory not getting that begging mode
[1:16:22] you're now putting some people are and
[1:16:24] they getting start talking to God they
[1:16:25] start that begging thing oh god oh god
[1:16:27] oh god I'm a worm I don't don't don't
[1:16:30] talk about God's property like it's
[1:16:33] trash because of God saved you you're
[1:16:36] not a worm you're not scum you're not
[1:16:38] even a sinner anymore if you're saved
[1:16:40] come on somebody
[1:16:42] people hallo I'm a sinner saved by grace
[1:16:44] I was a sinner but if I'm born again I'm
[1:16:47] not a sinner anymore I may live in a
[1:16:50] sinner's body but I am NOT a sinner the
[1:16:52] real me I am NOT a sinner anymore Amen I
[1:16:55] am justified as though I never did it in
[1:16:57] the first place that's what brother
[1:16:58] Branham taught us hey you say watch
[1:17:00] brother Brandon what about the Bible
[1:17:01] Paul use the same word justified it
[1:17:03] means you cannot lay an accusation to
[1:17:06] those that have never done any wrong
[1:17:09] amen that's what I am I'm justified if
[1:17:11] I've got the Holy Ghost I have a
[1:17:13] fearlessness
[1:17:14] I got a boldness I can walk right up
[1:17:17] before and say god I've got a need and
[1:17:19] I am I like this meaning of this word
[1:17:22] confidence also means to speak without
[1:17:26] concealment now remember our heart
[1:17:30] there's many doors as one door to comes
[1:17:34] in the church here you get a door there
[1:17:35] door yonder door yonder your honor
[1:17:37] yonder yonder yonder in the human heart
[1:17:40] there's one way that we can let Jesus in
[1:17:43] comes through the mind our eyes our ears
[1:17:45] all of that attached to our mind it
[1:17:47] opens up the channel let Jesus come in
[1:17:50] his word comes and hits our ears or hits
[1:17:52] our mind or our thoughts or whatever you
[1:17:54] want to say and and as all of this is
[1:17:56] entering into us there's all kinds of
[1:17:59] doors on this inside of the human heart
[1:18:01] that have to be looked at now the one
[1:18:04] thing about being a Christian that I
[1:18:06] want you to remember is that in order
[1:18:07] for him to truly be Lord he can be your
[1:18:10] Savior but in order for him to be your
[1:18:13] Lord there can't be any concealment of
[1:18:16] any doors in your heart I must say
[1:18:21] something as young people sitting here I
[1:18:22] want them to hear this as a minister we
[1:18:24] need to be we need to be transparent
[1:18:25] with all of us one thing you're going to
[1:18:28] find as you grow up around the ranks of
[1:18:29] this message you gonna find out one
[1:18:30] reason people in the shape they in is
[1:18:32] because they still got cupboards and
[1:18:34] drawers and doors and closets and all
[1:18:37] kinds of stuff that they never opened up
[1:18:39] to God to let him get in and dig it all
[1:18:40] out and make it right I my are my
[1:18:43] favorites preachers deacons trustees
[1:18:45] lowliest housewife the littlest
[1:18:47] ragpicker I don't care what they are
[1:18:49] might be a trashman you're gonna find
[1:18:52] the reason that people aren't further
[1:18:54] along than what they are is because deep
[1:18:56] within their guts deep in their hearts
[1:18:58] they've never allowed the Lord Jesus to
[1:19:00] go right down in every door and drawer
[1:19:02] and cupboard in their house and do a
[1:19:04] clean job on the inside and you remember
[1:19:07] he can't give you the Holy Ghost until
[1:19:08] he's out of access to every part of you
[1:19:10] that's why the part of this confidence
[1:19:13] is the ability to be able to confide in
[1:19:14] him to be able to speak without
[1:19:17] concealment so when you walk before the
[1:19:19] throne of grace as you walk out before
[1:19:21] the throne you ought to be able to bear
[1:19:23] yourself open to God and say every
[1:19:25] drawer is yours every closet every door
[1:19:30] my life is yours you take over and do
[1:19:32] what you want to do you understand that
[1:19:35] in order for a person to really be right
[1:19:37] with God
[1:19:38] you cannot conceal not one place in your
[1:19:41] heart you can't do it it's a friend of
[1:19:44] mine told me a number of years ago I was
[1:19:45] preaching to some of the people about
[1:19:47] you know receiving the Holy Ghost and I
[1:19:49] like what he said he said you realize
[1:19:52] that if you got a temper on the inside
[1:19:53] of you
[1:19:54] he said you realize if God sealed you
[1:19:56] where the Holy Ghost with that temper on
[1:19:57] the inside of you you'd have that temper
[1:19:59] through eternity because whatever God
[1:20:01] seals in there it's sealed to the day of
[1:20:03] your Redemption so God's got to get all
[1:20:05] of that out of your heart before he can
[1:20:07] place the seal of God on you now I
[1:20:10] realize I rise we could preach
[1:20:11] sanctification going up through the
[1:20:13] steps of the virtues in the pyramid we
[1:20:14] go inside upside down what I'm talking
[1:20:16] about is I'm talking about before God
[1:20:18] can actually move on your heart and he
[1:20:20] can do all three stages justification
[1:20:22] application baptized Holy Ghost in a
[1:20:23] moment's time it depends on what your
[1:20:25] will and they're not concealed it
[1:20:28] depends on what you're willing to open
[1:20:29] up before him I'm not talking bout
[1:20:31] running to the altar 30 times in every
[1:20:32] youth camp I'm talking about being able
[1:20:34] to open up your heart said right here in
[1:20:36] the house of God open up your heart say
[1:20:38] Here I am Lord take over let me tell you
[1:20:41] when God sees that out of a person's
[1:20:43] life it don't take a month it takes
[1:20:45] moments and God can do things in less
[1:20:49] than a moment than we could take me
[1:20:51] years to do what he can do in just a few
[1:20:53] seconds time because he's got the
[1:20:56] ability to move upon our heart now if
[1:20:58] everything on the inside of me is open
[1:21:01] then and I can confide in him or pray
[1:21:04] then whatsoever we ask now we're looking
[1:21:07] down here let's just pick up 1st John
[1:21:09] chapter 3 now verse 20 and and and pull
[1:21:12] this down just a little bit now for if
[1:21:14] our heart condemn us not the word he
[1:21:16] uses for condemn there is present in
[1:21:19] sincerity and what that means is that
[1:21:23] when a person let's just say that you've
[1:21:26] allowed something to come in now all of
[1:21:28] us have served the Lord we know when we
[1:21:30] mess up I mean there there ain't no two
[1:21:33] three ways about it you know when you've
[1:21:34] blown it and when you've fallen flat on
[1:21:37] your face
[1:21:38] wham-o you know it ain't nobody got to
[1:21:40] tell you you don't need a sermon or an
[1:21:42] article you know what your own
[1:21:43] conscience
[1:21:44] declares to you that you've messed up
[1:21:46] nah you don't even have to have the Holy
[1:21:48] Ghost for that your own conscience will
[1:21:50] let you know when you do wrong how do
[1:21:52] you think the world turns God away he
[1:21:54] convicts their heart without the Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost he convicts their heart and
[1:21:57] convicts them a sin using their own
[1:21:59] conscience letting them know what is
[1:22:02] right and wrong you were bet to know the
[1:22:04] difference between the two don't think
[1:22:05] so go back to the Garden of Eden look
[1:22:07] see what tree you was born off of he was
[1:22:10] born off the tree to no good from evil
[1:22:12] every man a woman without the Holy Ghost
[1:22:15] they don't need a church service their
[1:22:17] own conscious declares to him what's
[1:22:18] good and what ain't that's why brother
[1:22:21] Branham could look out of nature and see
[1:22:22] God out of nature and go out and pin a
[1:22:24] letter to the tree trying to find God
[1:22:26] out there because his own conscience let
[1:22:28] him know God was out there somewhere now
[1:22:29] that's why as a boy even though I was
[1:22:31] raised in the message I look up to the
[1:22:33] Stars and try to figure out where God
[1:22:35] was hiding it behind one of them stars
[1:22:37] maybe because in my conscience I knew
[1:22:39] there's a God and I was trying to
[1:22:40] contact him hallelujah amen so if our
[1:22:44] heart condemn us that's present in
[1:22:46] sincerity remember the bread told lie
[1:22:47] and had to go make it right about the
[1:22:49] baby and I went to go pray for the Lord
[1:22:51] told him he wasn't fit to pray for the
[1:22:52] child and had to go back and fix that
[1:22:54] light well that was present in sincerity
[1:22:56] now watch I love this now he's talking
[1:22:59] about children now these are these are
[1:23:00] children of God these aren't just
[1:23:01] anybody but if our heart condemn us God
[1:23:04] is greater than our heart so they're not
[1:23:08] a speck of guilt they're not a boo-boo
[1:23:10] they're not a oh never a mess-up
[1:23:13] that God is not greater than on the
[1:23:16] inside of your heart you say well man I
[1:23:19] I don't know I this feels like a madness
[1:23:22] setting on me God is greater than that
[1:23:24] he's greater than your heart greater
[1:23:27] than that feeling greater than that
[1:23:29] guilt and knoweth all things you see
[1:23:31] this is why he can rightly just and and
[1:23:34] decide and cast judgment on our
[1:23:37] situations because he knows the hearts
[1:23:40] the only thing that's kept me alive all
[1:23:42] of these years is God knows what's
[1:23:44] inside of my heart it certainly had been
[1:23:47] because of my depth or my experience in
[1:23:49] preaching they got nothing to do it that
[1:23:50] I've spent my life in the pulpit but I'm
[1:23:52] a knucklehead let me tell you God knows
[1:23:54] my heart
[1:23:55] come on somebody amen and fellow
[1:23:58] knuckleheads holler a man a man a man we
[1:24:01] all do we all fellas in the same ship
[1:24:03] come on we've all got these little
[1:24:05] things on that way we're in little ways
[1:24:07] that we do but God is greater than our
[1:24:11] heart and knows all things he knows
[1:24:14] exactly what's laying on the inside of
[1:24:15] me and you and he understands what it's
[1:24:18] like that's why when you come to church
[1:24:20] or you're trying to live a Christian
[1:24:22] life and you make some kind of a mistake
[1:24:23] don't beat yourself up day and night if
[1:24:26] you didn't mean to do it don't you think
[1:24:28] God knows that but we remind him of it a
[1:24:31] thousand times a day oh god I'm sorry
[1:24:33] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry look I get
[1:24:35] it I get it when we get upset and we
[1:24:37] lose our temper whatever we do we want
[1:24:39] to let the Lord know how sincere we are
[1:24:40] but always remember he knows what's in
[1:24:43] your heart you say what does this got to
[1:24:46] do with having confidence in him here in
[1:24:48] my prayers
[1:24:49] how you gonna pray right if you don't
[1:24:51] have confidence that God knows what's
[1:24:52] really real and true hmm you say well I
[1:24:57] I pray I ask him I talked to him
[1:25:01] I'm already straightened out yeah that
[1:25:06] right there is usually the first sign
[1:25:07] that you ain't because a real child of
[1:25:10] God they're always struggling and
[1:25:12] fighting for the next rung on the ladder
[1:25:13] they're always looking for the next step
[1:25:15] in Christ come on don't get quite on me
[1:25:17] right they're always looking for the
[1:25:20] next element of what God's going to do
[1:25:21] and how he's going to do it and
[1:25:23] whatsoever we ask now watch this it love
[1:25:25] it if our heart condemn us not then we
[1:25:28] have confidence same word toward God and
[1:25:31] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:25:34] because we keep his Commandments and do
[1:25:37] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:25:38] sight now let's pick up 1st John chapter
[1:25:41] 5 now verse 14 and 15 now look here 1st
[1:25:43] John 5 14 and 15 and this is the
[1:25:46] confidence same word that we have in him
[1:25:50] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:25:58] will all so not just a
[1:26:02] asked for asking sake but asked
[1:26:06] according to his will because he
[1:26:09] realized this is where a lot of people
[1:26:11] get in trouble right here
[1:26:12] well I asked God to do it and he didn't
[1:26:15] even listen to me did you ask him
[1:26:16] according to his will or did you even
[1:26:18] bother to find out if it was words a man
[1:26:21] in case some y'all forgot it did we even
[1:26:26] stop to say now father
[1:26:27] is this your mind should I go this way
[1:26:30] should I do this what should I do you
[1:26:32] tell me and I'll do it
[1:26:34] how did you say the time we just will
[1:26:36] have it and grab it name it clear ass
[1:26:38] getting that God I want it but what if
[1:26:40] God would say no the question is then if
[1:26:44] I'm asking according to his will he
[1:26:46] hears me but what if he don't want to do
[1:26:49] it don't as soon as I sees where we get
[1:26:53] in trouble because we look at God like
[1:26:55] an errand boy God is greater than your
[1:26:57] heart he's no errand boy he does what he
[1:26:59] wants to do it's not me trying to get
[1:27:02] him and persuade him to do things for me
[1:27:04] it's for me to persuade myself to stay
[1:27:06] in the center of God's will to keep me
[1:27:09] lined up and doing what I should do come
[1:27:11] on now preach to me not just walk around
[1:27:13] say oh well whatever it be and well I
[1:27:15] just ask God for it it'll be that way
[1:27:17] you could ask God day and night it's
[1:27:19] just like when a father and his kids
[1:27:21] come running up or in they're in a store
[1:27:22] you know daddy I want daddy I want daddy
[1:27:24] I want we just kind of brush them off
[1:27:26] it's cuz we don't want them to have it
[1:27:29] we know they've done got 4738 little
[1:27:33] dolls and they ain't played with one I'm
[1:27:35] the second I get the clothes all pulled
[1:27:36] off one they throw them in the floor and
[1:27:37] that's it we know they're not interested
[1:27:41] in another toy they're just a kid so
[1:27:43] what do you do as a father you just kind
[1:27:46] of push them up no no no that's why
[1:27:47] Jesus says us sometimes we will holler
[1:27:50] and holler oh god oh god oh god and
[1:27:52] sometimes you said freeze cop we said
[1:28:01] not my lord
[1:28:02] really so you've got biblical evidence
[1:28:04] to prove that God answers every prayer
[1:28:07] do you well let's look at Paul can we
[1:28:10] because paul asks God again and again
[1:28:12] and again that word thrice er actually
[1:28:13] doesn't mean three times it actually
[1:28:14] means again and the
[1:28:16] and again and again again and again
[1:28:17] again and when Paul kept asking God
[1:28:21] finally just shook his head and said
[1:28:22] Paul I said no woo preach to me that now
[1:28:28] that's a hard thing for us to receive
[1:28:29] because we look at God as almost like
[1:28:31] some kind of a spiritual cash cow
[1:28:33] whatever I want
[1:28:35] I get only if it is according to his
[1:28:38] will friends and you ought to be
[1:28:41] thankful to God and I should be to that
[1:28:43] the God doesn't always answer every
[1:28:45] prayer you prayed how many ears ever
[1:28:48] prayed that they should quit so all of
[1:28:52] your liars and so we need to preach
[1:28:53] online come on now how many ever said
[1:28:57] I'll just give up Lord I just want to
[1:28:59] quit I just get me out of this mess now
[1:29:02] you may not call that prayers but when
[1:29:03] you're talking to him you are praying
[1:29:06] aren't you glad that Jesus never
[1:29:08] answered that prayer for you what if he
[1:29:11] looked down said okay I'll grant it to
[1:29:12] you what if it was almost like the
[1:29:14] Christmas story about It's a Wonderful
[1:29:15] Life maybe the man you can marry he
[1:29:17] asked God to let him not ever be born
[1:29:18] and then he sees his whole life of not
[1:29:20] being born and what kind of effect what
[1:29:22] if God would treat you the same way that
[1:29:23] the first time you got discourages I
[1:29:26] just cannot Gus it okay done now how
[1:29:31] often do you think you really get
[1:29:33] victory in your life if it was that way
[1:29:34] we've used quite as a Methodist this
[1:29:36] morning come on well I'm trying to show
[1:29:39] you brother is that if we have
[1:29:41] confidence in him to hear our prayers we
[1:29:44] must know it's got to be according to
[1:29:46] the will of God it's not according to
[1:29:49] the will of God then God doesn't hear
[1:29:51] the Bible said so right there in front
[1:29:53] of your face and thank God he doesn't
[1:29:56] thank God he doesn't hear and answer
[1:29:58] every prayer now notice why then of
[1:30:03] course the question is and well why
[1:30:05] would I be afraid when it comes to
[1:30:09] praying well it's very simple rejection
[1:30:12] often we don't want to say this out loud
[1:30:14] a lot of times but often we're kind of
[1:30:16] afraid that if we ask God for something
[1:30:19] he's going to reject us and we may not
[1:30:22] say that loud but deep in our heart
[1:30:23] that's part of the fear of this the fear
[1:30:25] of being rejected we are afraid that if
[1:30:27] we ask our lost
[1:30:29] of the times in paralyzed mother Jessie
[1:30:31] around the world that people have come
[1:30:33] to me and they have not asked me for a
[1:30:34] deep I have very few that come and say I
[1:30:36] will you pray for me that the Lord have
[1:30:38] helped me understand the Fasil
[1:30:39] I need your prayers that I can figure
[1:30:41] the thunders out rather beyond I've been
[1:30:43] struggling this week with the anointing
[1:30:46] once at the end time could you please
[1:30:47] pray that God will help me get through
[1:30:49] that very few have I ever had I've had a
[1:30:53] few I'm asked me to pray for revelations
[1:30:54] and things like that but very few
[1:30:56] usually when they come up it's always
[1:30:58] the same type of theme again and again
[1:31:00] and again I don't know if God's hearing
[1:31:02] me I prayed and asked him Lord I'm just
[1:31:04] not sure he's listening oh brother that
[1:31:07] ought to guide us as ministers into the
[1:31:09] realm of where people are really living
[1:31:12] at it's not the depth of the bulk of
[1:31:15] Revelation that many of them struggle if
[1:31:18] it's this it's this they just don't know
[1:31:22] if God is listening to them when they
[1:31:25] pray they're just not confident please
[1:31:32] but we must have confidence in him to
[1:31:36] hear our prayer so if I follow this
[1:31:38] formula the lights are come on do you
[1:31:43] walk up to a light switch and flip it
[1:31:44] and go boy I hope man I hope now you
[1:31:49] walk up to the light switch and you have
[1:31:51] two things that are operational
[1:31:52] functional within your spirit first of
[1:31:55] all you know if you flip the switch you
[1:31:56] have confidence and expectation the
[1:31:59] light is going to come on seconds you've
[1:32:01] got faith or you can say first or so
[1:32:03] first a second which everyone will order
[1:32:05] them up and that faith inside of your
[1:32:07] heart is you know that switches operate
[1:32:09] lights you know that but your
[1:32:11] expectation is when you flip the switch
[1:32:13] lights come come on so faith and hope
[1:32:16] have to be married together well what if
[1:32:18] your hope is fear faith and fear cannot
[1:32:22] coexist so I've got to know when I flip
[1:32:26] the switch God's gonna answer that light
[1:32:28] he's gonna bring the lights on and don't
[1:32:30] forget children of God and I will call
[1:32:32] your children cuz the Bible just did
[1:32:34] here a few moments ago but remember what
[1:32:36] he said hallelujah in the last days of
[1:32:39] the hour we're living in the darkest
[1:32:40] hour it's ever been he said there is a
[1:32:42] man
[1:32:43] here who can turn on the light blue
[1:32:47] glory to cops oh not we're gonna have a
[1:32:51] revival right here in this one and keep
[1:32:52] talking that way now notice again I want
[1:32:55] to give you this next of this next order
[1:32:56] next article which is God will accept
[1:33:00] our repentance based upon the sincerity
[1:33:04] of our heart and not the markings of our
[1:33:07] body now I want to read this quote how
[1:33:09] the faithless son of God you remember
[1:33:10] that state of that young man in Memphis
[1:33:13] Ibrahim went and visit he had the social
[1:33:14] disease of the low mammy out by the gate
[1:33:16] and he's reading to the I'm reading to
[1:33:19] you now from a quotation where he's
[1:33:20] talking to the boy and sad talked to him
[1:33:22] for a little while and I said some would
[1:33:23] you become a Christian and he said I
[1:33:25] want to brother branham I'm afraid that
[1:33:27] God won't receive me I have been so
[1:33:31] sinful
[1:33:31] now notice brother brems answer to him
[1:33:34] oh yes he will oh yes sir he will
[1:33:36] receive you you think he would take me
[1:33:39] and a disease like this what I've got
[1:33:42] there's got the equivalent of what we'd
[1:33:44] say like AIDS or he's got syphilis or
[1:33:46] gonorrhea or some kind of a social
[1:33:47] disease sexually transmitted disease and
[1:33:50] here this young man in the presence of
[1:33:53] this prophet of God trying to come
[1:33:54] before the presence of the Lord has
[1:33:56] feared that God will not receive him
[1:33:59] because of the deeds that has been done
[1:34:01] in his body now I read this and I placed
[1:34:03] this article before you because in
[1:34:05] talking about confidence before God and
[1:34:08] the joy of being accepted then we must
[1:34:10] realize that the fear of being rejected
[1:34:13] it cannot be upon the basis of okay I've
[1:34:16] been molested I've been raped
[1:34:18] I've been a drug addict I've been an
[1:34:19] alcoholic I've done this I smoked
[1:34:21] cigarettes for years and now I'm coming
[1:34:24] to the Lord you know I've always
[1:34:25] wondered about these characters I see
[1:34:26] out on the field you know but I'm travel
[1:34:28] out yonder and they got big gauges in
[1:34:30] their ears like this and they've got
[1:34:32] tattoos all over their forehead and I
[1:34:33] saw one guy with tattoos over his
[1:34:35] eyelids the other day and somebody sent
[1:34:37] me a picture sometime ago of a fella
[1:34:39] that was being conformed into a lizard
[1:34:42] had little bumps and things put up
[1:34:44] around his eyes he looked like a lizard
[1:34:45] in his face had his tongue split in half
[1:34:47] and I thought you know what would happen
[1:34:49] if those individuals ever got the Holy
[1:34:51] Ghost and you mean you think a
[1:34:52] preacher's tire swings around what would
[1:34:54] you think
[1:34:55] gages in the mirror lobe just going
[1:34:57] around while they were shouting and
[1:34:58] praising the Lord now for many of us we
[1:35:00] would look at people like that
[1:35:02] and we would say there is no way at all
[1:35:05] I could receive somebody like that but
[1:35:07] remember it God is not receiving you
[1:35:10] based upon the marks done in the body
[1:35:12] but on the sincerity of your hearts
[1:35:17] hallelujah now that ought to give you a
[1:35:19] confidence to know God hears your
[1:35:22] prayers okay if you got tattoos all over
[1:35:27] your body I think a brother Steve
[1:35:30] Delaney whenever I heard his testimony
[1:35:32] the first time and he said I would take
[1:35:35] my shirt off and show you but I'm
[1:35:36] embarrassed of it he said got tattoos
[1:35:38] all over my body and I thought about how
[1:35:40] people in the message probably would
[1:35:41] receive that brother Jesse I got to
[1:35:44] think about that one day and I preached
[1:35:45] a message called the woman at the wells
[1:35:47] first day at church I thought about how
[1:35:51] it would look like whenever that priest
[1:35:53] should be standing there that not priest
[1:35:55] but that you know that that preacher's
[1:35:57] standing there in the synagogue you know
[1:35:59] they put the women up on a platform like
[1:36:00] this and the men on the floor and the
[1:36:02] women in the balcony and here he is and
[1:36:04] Moses said and Moses said and Moses said
[1:36:06] in Moke and there's a woman of the whale
[1:36:09] sitting up in that balcony
[1:36:10] I wonder what some of them how they
[1:36:12] would have reacted what a lot of scum
[1:36:14] like that doing there it's not the same
[1:36:16] attitude that people have about former
[1:36:18] sinners coming into the house of God
[1:36:20] they look at them based on the look of
[1:36:23] their body but remember God does not
[1:36:25] bring salvation because of your good
[1:36:28] works or how you look or how you don't
[1:36:30] look but you are saved by grace and
[1:36:33] faith alone hallelujah to God you are
[1:36:36] not saved because you are good because
[1:36:39] you are clean because you are pure if
[1:36:42] that was the case you would not need
[1:36:44] salvation but God saved you because you
[1:36:48] could not save yourself hallelujah
[1:36:53] so the essence of a real child of God
[1:36:57] all praise be to God it's not upon the
[1:37:00] marks done in the body but the sincerity
[1:37:03] of their hearts I don't care if he's a
[1:37:06] homosexual or she's a homosexual
[1:37:09] okay what kind of lifestyle they live
[1:37:10] when they come to Jesus he'll receive
[1:37:12] them on the sincerity of their heart
[1:37:15] praise God
[1:37:17] now let's look at my next article here
[1:37:19] this morning and that is we must believe
[1:37:22] that he has our best interest in his
[1:37:26] mind this was a tough one for many of us
[1:37:30] but I want to show you this using
[1:37:33] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 12 now just
[1:37:37] just if you'll look here at this
[1:37:38] scripture for just a moment and make
[1:37:40] sure you kindly put a little star next
[1:37:42] to this one this would be a goodie to
[1:37:43] keep keep around for a little while now
[1:37:45] watch this Ephesians three and twelve
[1:37:48] now we must have confidence we must know
[1:37:50] that he has our best interest in his
[1:37:53] heart all right Peter chapter three
[1:37:56] verse 12 Paul said in whom we have
[1:37:58] boldness and access and confidence by
[1:38:03] the faith of him did you notice how we
[1:38:06] get there not by our faith let me let
[1:38:10] you know something right now your faith
[1:38:12] don't amount to a hill of beans if
[1:38:15] you're gonna get right with God it's his
[1:38:18] faith that gets you here hey man I feel
[1:38:22] like shouting not my faith not by works
[1:38:26] of what I've done but what God has done
[1:38:28] through me and for me it's very very
[1:38:32] simple if you let him do it
[1:38:34] he'll do it huh if you'll let him do it
[1:38:39] he'll do it 90% of the time friends the
[1:38:42] things that don't happen in our lives
[1:38:44] they don't happen because we offer
[1:38:46] resistance that we're flipping the
[1:38:48] switch flipping the switch and then
[1:38:49] we're also trying to stop the current
[1:38:50] the lights gonna come on in like Harlow
[1:38:53] I don't want it that way you get it
[1:38:54] exactly the way he wants you to have it
[1:38:56] this is his program not mine so I live
[1:39:00] by the faith of the Son of God come on
[1:39:02] now Oh glory to God so if we have
[1:39:05] boldness we also have that boldness
[1:39:08] remember was confidence there and with
[1:39:10] boldness and also we have access all of
[1:39:13] this the meaning of this word simply if
[1:39:17] I could just put it in plain terms it'd
[1:39:19] be like coming to the church this
[1:39:20] morning okay
[1:39:21] I welcome everybody into this church we
[1:39:23] say I welcome you welcome to the house
[1:39:26] of the Lord right brother Jesse we
[1:39:27] welcome it all right welcome to the
[1:39:28] house of God
[1:39:31] now that's wonderful as long as you're
[1:39:33] willing to behave yourself libram said
[1:39:35] you stick around long as you want to
[1:39:37] long as you're willing to behave but now
[1:39:41] there's a difference in that listen
[1:39:43] close then if I say welcome to the house
[1:39:46] of God or if I look and say but I
[1:39:49] welcome you everybody's welcome but
[1:39:54] that's a different invitation and that's
[1:39:56] a different greeting than me saying but
[1:39:58] I welcome you so Jesus will allow
[1:40:01] everybody to have access to faith at
[1:40:04] some point in their life they have
[1:40:06] access to be able to believe God under
[1:40:08] righteousness but we're going a step
[1:40:11] further than just believing God under
[1:40:13] unto righteous unto Him going under the
[1:40:15] piano under the chair unto righteousness
[1:40:17] we are believing God even deeper than
[1:40:19] that meaning that whenever we come
[1:40:22] before him with the right attitude the
[1:40:23] right thoughts the right spirit and
[1:40:25] everything else he doesn't just say
[1:40:26] welcome but he says I welcome you not
[1:40:30] just you are welcome but I welcome you
[1:40:33] Oh glory to God there's a big difference
[1:40:37] between the two
[1:40:38] a person's may be welcome to stay under
[1:40:41] the general call remember the general
[1:40:42] call was go to the world and preach the
[1:40:45] gospel everybody can have a chance to be
[1:40:47] saved but not everybody is welcomed into
[1:40:50] the grace of God fully remember only the
[1:40:53] bride can truly repent truly repent
[1:40:57] fully repent because repentance brings
[1:40:59] the Holy Ghost not everybody will get
[1:41:01] the Holy Ghost fullest version those
[1:41:04] have been good to the Brethren oh no no
[1:41:05] no no it'll be many of them to the
[1:41:07] tribulation had been saved I never had
[1:41:09] the Holy Ghost well that's what he said
[1:41:11] oh I know Russ bus bride elite people we
[1:41:15] don't believe anybody's gonna make it
[1:41:16] into heaven but us bride people let me
[1:41:17] tell you God's got a whole economy that
[1:41:19] ain't never heard the name William
[1:41:20] Graham yet now if you want to be bride
[1:41:24] that's where you got to come of course
[1:41:25] that's where rap shouldn't face that
[1:41:28] we're talking about rapturing faith is a
[1:41:29] whole different category all together
[1:41:31] yes but Debbie branches that in the
[1:41:33] general call go say welcome whoo
[1:41:35] never will remember the bride is not
[1:41:37] whosoever will her name was on the
[1:41:40] Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation
[1:41:42] of the world there's a difference and a
[1:41:45] general call to the whole world and then
[1:41:47] him saying but I welcome you this is
[1:41:50] what this word access means he actually
[1:41:53] grants us I welcome you into my kingdom
[1:41:57] glory to God oh thank you Lord so then
[1:42:00] if I have been welcomed in then we must
[1:42:02] remember that he has our best interest
[1:42:06] at heart why would he welcome us and
[1:42:08] give us a formal welcome if he didn't
[1:42:11] have the best thoughts for us in mind do
[1:42:14] we honestly believe that the reason God
[1:42:15] put us in the kingdom of God is so you
[1:42:17] can make fun of his tormentors and
[1:42:18] treats like circus monkeys sometimes I
[1:42:22] believe that's the way some people treat
[1:42:23] Christianity almost like God's playing
[1:42:25] tricks on him and trying to be mean to
[1:42:27] him he doesn't do those things friends
[1:42:29] that's the carnal mind at play Oh
[1:42:33] hallelujah come on now preach to me a
[1:42:35] little bit now watch here in Hebrews
[1:42:38] chapter 3 now if you wanna write two
[1:42:39] stanzas verses five and then 12 through
[1:42:42] 14 and Paul simply said that you know we
[1:42:46] said take heed brethren verse 12
[1:42:48] if there be any in your heart of
[1:42:49] unbelief in departing from the Living
[1:42:51] God that we exhort one another daily
[1:42:53] wide is called today lest any of you be
[1:42:55] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:42:57] sin and then he says before we were made
[1:42:58] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:43:01] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:43:03] unto the end so the reason that some
[1:43:06] people don't last to the end is because
[1:43:08] they lose their confidence they quit
[1:43:10] believing that God has the best interest
[1:43:13] in mind for them but he does absolutely
[1:43:15] does now my next article here is we
[1:43:19] cannot draw back from him amen you all
[1:43:23] see that that's hebrews chapter 10 and
[1:43:25] verse 38 and 39 Paul said the just shall
[1:43:30] live by faith but if any man draw back
[1:43:34] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:43:37] now the word he uses here for draw back
[1:43:39] is timid shrink or conceal remember what
[1:43:46] I said a few moments ago that when you
[1:43:48] come
[1:43:49] for him with confidence confidence means
[1:43:51] you don't conceal any area of your life
[1:43:55] but this person drawing back is
[1:43:57] concealing timid shrink I've seen him do
[1:44:00] that in churches you know whenever you
[1:44:02] start preaching in there tater patch
[1:44:03] I've seen him actually hide behind the
[1:44:05] person in front of them to keep me from
[1:44:07] making eye contact with them usually
[1:44:09] when that happens I go get in the aisle
[1:44:11] where they're standing I go get on the
[1:44:13] I'll go stand on the bench next to them
[1:44:15] if I got to stand up in the seat I'll
[1:44:17] get up next to them and look at my
[1:44:18] eyeball to eyeball I figure if you're in
[1:44:20] church they're not here to hide anyhow
[1:44:23] praise the Lord so the Lord draw back it
[1:44:26] means to be timid now you remember what
[1:44:29] brother I'm someone to be calling
[1:44:30] somebody in a prayer line and the Holy
[1:44:31] Spirit will be hovered over that person
[1:44:33] and they wouldn't answer quickly so uh
[1:44:35] you're gonna miss it he said now see you
[1:44:37] have to answer quickly he said because
[1:44:39] the Holy Spirit is timid when he goes to
[1:44:42] move he wants you to respond back not in
[1:44:44] a timid way Lord I'm not so sure I had
[1:44:47] just Greaves always ready just jumps
[1:44:49] away okay if you're not gonna believe me
[1:44:51] then I'll just move so Paul said such a
[1:44:54] man God will have no pleasure in him and
[1:44:57] brother you realize it's not the sins of
[1:45:00] things you commit sometimes it's the sin
[1:45:02] of neglection things that you fail to do
[1:45:05] that God has told you to do oh praise
[1:45:09] the Lord can you say Amen right so
[1:45:13] sometimes then we have to understand
[1:45:17] that we've got to be verse 39 not verse
[1:45:19] 38 which 39 is we are not of them who
[1:45:21] draw back unto perdition look at this
[1:45:23] draw back in other words this isn't
[1:45:25] people just got scared or got you me
[1:45:27] worried or intimidated or they bowed
[1:45:30] down to pressure or they you know they
[1:45:31] they just they just misstep somehow but
[1:45:34] these are people that have drawn back
[1:45:36] unto perdition other words they have so
[1:45:38] moved away from the Holy Spirit God I
[1:45:40] want nothing to do with it timid shrink
[1:45:44] or conceal now you realize when brother
[1:45:46] Adam said in the last days that Ananias
[1:45:48] and Sapphira would return you realize
[1:45:49] that is the theme of Ananias and
[1:45:51] Sapphira life in the book of Acts they
[1:45:53] were concealing theft
[1:45:56] because God told them but out there and
[1:45:59] sell all your goods and distribute among
[1:46:01] everybody equally you you realize that
[1:46:02] that principle may not apply to us down
[1:46:04] here and lady OC yeah but at the time in
[1:46:06] order to propagate the gospel in the
[1:46:08] kingdom of God they were dividing
[1:46:09] severally amongst the brethren and the
[1:46:11] sister so that there could be equity
[1:46:13] among all of them they were trying to
[1:46:16] make sure that the saints were cared for
[1:46:18] praise the Lord that there wasn't
[1:46:21] beggars on the street that the gospel
[1:46:23] could propagate on this day we're living
[1:46:24] in it may not be the same way but it
[1:46:26] should be the same attitude that if I
[1:46:28] have an abundance I should be willing to
[1:46:30] give to you and that's not just money
[1:46:31] all the time that's wisdom that's advice
[1:46:33] that's experiences do you know how many
[1:46:36] people in this church alone just this
[1:46:38] little group of people right here do you
[1:46:40] have any understanding how much of a
[1:46:41] wealth of experience is sitting right
[1:46:43] here in this building right now think
[1:46:47] about the experiences you've had alone
[1:46:49] just you things that you could share
[1:46:51] with these young men and women things
[1:46:53] little pitfalls in life this is one
[1:46:56] reason I believe churches so to have
[1:46:57] testimony meetings from time to time now
[1:47:01] I don't know how you operate here but I
[1:47:02] mean in general the Church of the Lord
[1:47:03] we should be able to testify and share
[1:47:05] our experiences other people but folks
[1:47:07] are so timid sometimes they conceal
[1:47:09] things they don't want to share nothing
[1:47:11] with nobody
[1:47:12] I've seen brethren oh I don't want to
[1:47:15] talk to people because you know people
[1:47:17] talking to get on Facebook and it might
[1:47:18] come back to me well yeah I understand
[1:47:20] that but if God has given me a wealth of
[1:47:23] experience I'm gonna rack it y'all at
[1:47:25] both ends and I'm gonna tell people what
[1:47:29] I know some people so what one guy said
[1:47:32] to me said you just talk all the time
[1:47:34] don't shy said you know it's funny ain't
[1:47:36] nobody ever gets mad at a basketball
[1:47:38] player for dribbling the ball either get
[1:47:39] mad at preachers for talkin totally
[1:47:43] being called to do praise the Lord
[1:47:45] yeah how much experience could we share
[1:47:49] with somebody how many personal things
[1:47:51] that we've been through could we turn
[1:47:53] around and tell somebody else about it
[1:47:55] sure that we might have equity amongst
[1:47:58] the entire body I realize you sweep your
[1:48:01] steps and I'll sweep mine but don't
[1:48:03] forget we're we're also together as one
[1:48:05] Accord in one body we should be of one
[1:48:07] mind be looking to help other people and
[1:48:09] be able
[1:48:09] share our experiences of the people and
[1:48:11] Isis safar wasn't people like that now
[1:48:14] we realize when those days return we're
[1:48:16] looking for somebody to fall dead in the
[1:48:17] church let me tell you them days are
[1:48:19] already here
[1:48:19] people are concealing goodness they're
[1:48:22] concealing a wealth of knowledge a
[1:48:24] wealth of experiences they're concealing
[1:48:26] their there come on they're hiding it
[1:48:30] and they're not sharing it with the rest
[1:48:32] of the body praise the Lord I always get
[1:48:37] tickled
[1:48:38] Jesse's a schoolteacher and he's a
[1:48:40] pastor so it's a double whammy and I you
[1:48:44] know pastors or rule makers and teachers
[1:48:45] or rule makers you know and how is get
[1:48:48] tickling I don't mean this in a negative
[1:48:49] way I think it's good and it's got the
[1:48:51] little cleaning instructions back here
[1:48:52] in the back and I thought that's a good
[1:48:54] idea sway should be gotta lay it out let
[1:48:56] my know the roles responsibilities
[1:48:57] thanks but I get tickled some people how
[1:49:00] I want to do something for God you got a
[1:49:03] good strong back what is church got
[1:49:10] quiet I you we think if we're not given
[1:49:15] a thousand dollars a week in the tithing
[1:49:16] plate we ain't done nothing from God
[1:49:17] just dust in the pews we'll be a good
[1:49:19] start watch some of these pastors like
[1:49:25] evangelist like me I kind of help you
[1:49:26] get some things done and nice and so far
[1:49:34] ahead that from them from the rest of
[1:49:36] the body they said we'll take what we
[1:49:38] got and we'll hold it back do you
[1:49:40] understand what damage was done because
[1:49:42] they would not share with the rest of
[1:49:45] the body of Christ that kept back a part
[1:49:46] of it for themself how many people might
[1:49:49] they have hurt and God knew such a thing
[1:49:51] God knew their attitude and he knew it
[1:49:53] didn't stop there he knew that the
[1:49:55] minute that started he's there'd be no
[1:49:56] end to it that's the reason why he
[1:49:58] rebuked him when he used Peter to say
[1:50:01] wives Satan filled your heart to hold
[1:50:02] back there's a lot of things we hold
[1:50:05] back as the body of Christ I'll give you
[1:50:08] another good example when a preachers
[1:50:09] preach and I'll tell you sod do you want
[1:50:10] do something for God it wants do
[1:50:12] something for the Lord in you half of
[1:50:14] you don't will raise your hand you think
[1:50:15] I'm gonna get she does it you want to do
[1:50:18] some for the Lord I'll tell you a good
[1:50:19] way to do it pull on the word
[1:50:22] amen and praise the Lord and hallelujah
[1:50:24] glory to God how many times have we held
[1:50:26] back our applause or held back our a
[1:50:28] man's or held back our worship because
[1:50:30] we're tired or were wore out oh we've
[1:50:32] had a long week you're doing the same
[1:50:34] thing in a nice and so far I did you
[1:50:37] know what it brings it brings spiritual
[1:50:38] death to the body it hurts the churches
[1:50:41] because when you have people in a church
[1:50:43] that aren't interested in participating
[1:50:45] and all they want to do is be spectators
[1:50:47] you got one guy up here doing everything
[1:50:48] and everybody out there enjoying it at
[1:50:50] least you think they are you hope they
[1:50:53] are as I'm telling you something some
[1:50:56] folks man you want to check your pulse
[1:50:57] when you sit in church come on
[1:51:01] ah I've seen him sit and look and barely
[1:51:05] even shake their head barely even
[1:51:07] hollering man the Lord of God and praise
[1:51:08] the Lord well y'all think you kept
[1:51:10] Church for this is the place you're
[1:51:13] supposed to be able to let loose if
[1:51:16] you're a Walmart cashier you can't stand
[1:51:18] out your cash register and say that'll
[1:51:20] be 498 Laurie God hallelujah you gotta
[1:51:23] hold it back but the man said so he said
[1:51:26] you might be cutting up on you some man
[1:51:28] you can't stand it he said but you don't
[1:51:29] get out on the street corner in front
[1:51:31] everybody and carry on what do you think
[1:51:34] you come to church this is where you
[1:51:36] come to let loose let off the steam this
[1:51:41] is where you come to worship God don't
[1:51:44] be like that and I sin so far and hold
[1:51:46] back you're a man in your praise in your
[1:51:48] Halloween causes death in the church
[1:51:52] sure does it kills it kills the preacher
[1:51:55] it kills the atmosphere at kill I've
[1:51:57] seen people in the song service barely
[1:52:02] moving they just think you want to get
[1:52:04] up underneath them see bruising breath
[1:52:05] coming out and why because they're
[1:52:10] holding something back
[1:52:11] God don't want you holding anything back
[1:52:13] amen
[1:52:15] he wants you to be able to stand out
[1:52:16] there or the promise of God don't be
[1:52:18] timid don't straight don't conceal
[1:52:20] yourself come to the house of the roast
[1:52:22] of God Here I am I need to take my own
[1:52:28] medicine sometimes sometimes in
[1:52:31] preaching the gospel hey listen you
[1:52:33] think it's easy
[1:52:35] if you think this preach and things easy
[1:52:36] I advise you come give her a try it's
[1:52:41] hard you know how it is if you've ever
[1:52:43] had to give a public speech it feels
[1:52:45] good when you're sitting back yonder you
[1:52:47] get up in front of all them eyeballs
[1:52:48] staring a hole through you sir thank God
[1:52:51] for a gift and thank God for anointing
[1:52:53] all right in Timothy to death because
[1:52:54] whether you realize this or not I'm
[1:52:56] actually quite a shy person I am I know
[1:52:59] you wouldn't think of it I just had
[1:53:00] years of experience of trying to
[1:53:01] overcome that but I just missed the
[1:53:03] shower would he raised my head look at
[1:53:04] people sure
[1:53:06] and yet God called me to preach before
[1:53:09] what a joke Lord you are a joker man
[1:53:11] you're a funny guy God said I ain't
[1:53:14] jokin
[1:53:16] get out there and do it alright here we
[1:53:18] are now what if a man was to say oh I
[1:53:21] can't do it let me tell you something
[1:53:22] when the Lord told me to leave Ohio and
[1:53:24] go to Tennessee I told him no I did I
[1:53:27] found out six months later you don't
[1:53:29] tell God know about nothing because my
[1:53:32] people were Tennesseans and all I never
[1:53:34] knew about Tennesseans was just my Bunch
[1:53:36] which was a bunch of gunslingers and
[1:53:38] drunkards and everything else in the
[1:53:39] world and I said I'm not going down
[1:53:40] there around that much trash forget it
[1:53:42] no boy when he come back around six
[1:53:46] months later and they asked me so how
[1:53:49] about it now I said you know I was just
[1:53:51] kidding that whole time Lord I was just
[1:53:52] I was just teasing you a little bit I
[1:53:54] just wanted to see if you was really
[1:53:55] serious it's amazing how your mind
[1:53:58] changes but you want trouble just
[1:54:01] conceal yourself get timid shrink back
[1:54:04] when the Lord ask you to do something
[1:54:06] whoo come on bridge to the church huh
[1:54:11] sure you mean--you is bold enough to
[1:54:14] tell god no yeah sure did I was ignorant
[1:54:17] too brain did almost right now watch
[1:54:22] this my next article is we cannot be
[1:54:25] fearful of standing on God's promises
[1:54:28] right got 55 minutes in coming into an
[1:54:30] hour now I'm gonna try to get a little
[1:54:32] spot we'll pick us up this afternoon now
[1:54:33] watch here he said in Java Jerry said
[1:54:36] now if Jesus come to this platform
[1:54:38] he said if you believe you become his
[1:54:39] platforming these people will produce
[1:54:40] the same kind of life and do the same
[1:54:42] things they did on earth will he accept
[1:54:44] you for all your needs but asked them
[1:54:46] said will you raise your hand up and
[1:54:47] said I'll accept it all right
[1:54:49] the Lord bless you number the Brenham
[1:54:50] aren't you afraid to make that kind of
[1:54:52] statement no sir
[1:54:54] he promised it it's his promise no
[1:54:58] matter anything contrary to it I say
[1:55:01] it's a lie a man God said so that
[1:55:04] settles it
[1:55:05] again I hear you him someone said
[1:55:07] brother Branham aren't you afraid no sir
[1:55:10] just as the Eagle I feel and know the
[1:55:14] Holy Spirit is here I know that he
[1:55:16] called me to do this I have not one fear
[1:55:19] it's his work not mine that's why we've
[1:55:24] got faith in what we're doing because
[1:55:25] it's what God has done not what we have
[1:55:28] done all right so we cannot be fearful
[1:55:32] of standing on the promises of God and
[1:55:34] yet we do and yet we are come on don't
[1:55:41] look at me like a bunch of angels you're
[1:55:45] super men here in church you get out of
[1:55:47] this door and you become Clark Kent my
[1:55:49] time you walk out the door huh I believe
[1:55:54] you Lord of God and Halliday sure you
[1:55:56] say that until the pressures on and then
[1:56:00] when things get rough that's whenever
[1:56:01] you start shrinking getting timid
[1:56:04] concealing the matter so well Lord I
[1:56:07] believe you know if you one of the
[1:56:09] biggest excuses I hear people make is
[1:56:11] what God wants it to happen it'll happen
[1:56:13] what your dough already told me is that
[1:56:15] you don't believe you can do it
[1:56:17] as you're just throwing that off on God
[1:56:20] but you have a responsibility yourself
[1:56:22] either you have to believe it for
[1:56:23] yourself that God can do it and that
[1:56:25] you're standing on the promise of God
[1:56:26] see that's not a testimony if God wants
[1:56:28] to do it he can do it the testimony is
[1:56:30] if I'm going to testify
[1:56:31] I believe God can do it for me don't
[1:56:33] know how don't know when don't know how
[1:56:35] it's gonna show up but I believe God can
[1:56:37] make it happen when you get that I
[1:56:40] believe in there now you're making a
[1:56:41] testimony of what you're saying yeah we
[1:56:45] live in a society of his expression goes
[1:56:48] que sera sera as the song went what's
[1:56:50] whatever will be will be whatever I
[1:56:53] gotta do he'll do it whatever that's
[1:56:55] later you'll see it for you right there
[1:56:57] but God doesn't want someone adjust to
[1:56:59] whatever it just if it'll happen it'll
[1:57:02] happen
[1:57:02] let go let it happen God wants people
[1:57:06] that are not fearful of standing on the
[1:57:09] front line out there and saying the
[1:57:10] doctor said I got cancer but I believe
[1:57:12] glory to God what God said
[1:57:15] he's already healed my body and he wants
[1:57:19] people to stand out on the promises of
[1:57:21] God why don't we do it fear of rejection
[1:57:26] we're afraid if we really make a stand
[1:57:28] that somehow another will miss the mark
[1:57:31] and be rejected in the end we'll make
[1:57:33] shipwreck and that's true we should be
[1:57:35] concerned before we make any kind of a
[1:57:37] statement or Boulder you know
[1:57:39] affirmation of any kind we ought to know
[1:57:41] what we're talking about before we make
[1:57:43] because the devil is listening to you
[1:57:44] you know he's paying attention to how
[1:57:46] these things are being said and what's
[1:57:48] going on and if you make a proclamation
[1:57:50] and you really don't believe it the
[1:57:52] devil is gonna make you it's gonna make
[1:57:54] you prove it anyhow you said you
[1:57:56] believed it oh well you better know what
[1:57:58] you're talking about
[1:57:59] but once you do know what you're talking
[1:58:01] about we cannot be fearful of standing
[1:58:04] on the promises of God all right I'm
[1:58:05] gonna give you a couple more articles of
[1:58:07] faith and fear here first I want you to
[1:58:09] write this down people fear the unknown
[1:58:11] and people fear mesi know what I mean
[1:58:18] messy you know what I'm talking about
[1:58:20] don't you like when you walk into a
[1:58:22] house and things the kids been cutting
[1:58:24] up all day long and stuff laying all
[1:58:25] over the place and I'm gone on messy
[1:58:27] people fear it
[1:58:29] they fear messy but as most of you know
[1:58:32] when you've worked in kind of a job or
[1:58:34] you've had any kind of a renovation
[1:58:36] project or like we just prepared on the
[1:58:38] church here and you had new painting and
[1:58:40] put a wall out or whatever you had to do
[1:58:41] most people know that in order for the
[1:58:43] thing to be done right it's got to get
[1:58:45] messy first before it can do it
[1:58:49] that's one reason I believe God set us
[1:58:51] down here with a mess age because the
[1:58:57] mess age the message the mess age it
[1:59:01] brings us into an understanding that God
[1:59:03] had to splatter the thing to the four
[1:59:05] winds
[1:59:05] tear it all the pieces to get it
[1:59:07] straightened out right don't forget part
[1:59:11] of Elijah's ministry was to destroy Tara
[1:59:15] all of these ideas that were contrary to
[1:59:17] the Word of God so when they put their
[1:59:20] car together it was office looking thing
[1:59:21] you ever saw they had the steering wheel
[1:59:23] in the trunk and I had the trunk on the
[1:59:24] hood and they had the hood on the wheels
[1:59:26] and had the wheels in the seat and here
[1:59:29] comes this prophet of God Elijah and
[1:59:30] start ripping things out throwing little
[1:59:32] bolts and nuts and stuff going every
[1:59:34] which direction it was messy but God
[1:59:36] required messy in order to get the
[1:59:38] things straightened out we fear messy we
[1:59:44] do we're afraid when it's messy that
[1:59:46] things are going to go wrong actually
[1:59:48] that's proof of it going right and we
[1:59:54] fear the unknown we don't know what
[1:59:55] homes what what the future holds I don't
[1:59:57] know what the next five minute hold
[1:59:58] hopefully it's closing I don't know what
[2:00:02] the next few minutes of my life holds I
[2:00:04] have no ability to predict tomorrow less
[2:00:06] God showed me a vision of some sort
[2:00:08] unless he comes spoke to my heart and
[2:00:11] said okay and such such time such that's
[2:00:12] gonna happen go down this road you'll
[2:00:14] meet so-and-so unless God give me some
[2:00:16] kind of a foretelling I don't know it's
[2:00:17] gonna happen
[2:00:18] the very next seconds of my life that
[2:00:20] are ahead of me every moment that is
[2:00:22] ahead of me
[2:00:22] lays in the hands of God no matter how
[2:00:24] little or how big and we fear that we
[2:00:27] fear that unknown element we fear that
[2:00:31] unknown element it's just like in
[2:00:32] martial arts I took a little karate
[2:00:35] Taekwondo when I was a boy and I made it
[2:00:39] up through a few belts
[2:00:40] I enjoyed it it was it was good activity
[2:00:42] and and kept it healthy and all that
[2:00:44] kind of stuff of course I was in the
[2:00:45] sports stuff so they put you in these
[2:00:46] competitions where you guys kicked your
[2:00:48] head off your shoulders and this is back
[2:00:51] in the 80s his a long time ago and and I
[2:00:53] remember one of the instructors walked
[2:00:55] up I was a little bitty old guy and he
[2:00:57] put me up against somebody that was my
[2:00:58] size and I mean when I say my size I
[2:01:00] mean he was three of me put together
[2:01:01] than one big dude and I had to I had to
[2:01:06] knock him down I had to roll his leg up
[2:01:08] and I had to come over and smack him in
[2:01:09] the nose of the back of my fist and I
[2:01:11] had to get him to tap out when I got him
[2:01:12] in that leg hole and I thought well I
[2:01:16] don't know if this guy's gonna do to me
[2:01:18] and my instructor they call him sensei
[2:01:21] my instructor said to me said son that's
[2:01:23] the reason we teach you how to fight
[2:01:24] because the fighting doesn't give you
[2:01:27] all of the tools exactly
[2:01:29] my point but it gives you the ability to
[2:01:32] defend yourself against the unknown and
[2:01:35] I thought what a good message because
[2:01:38] that's what God has done with the bride
[2:01:39] we don't necessarily know how the devil
[2:01:41] is gonna attack us tomorrow but the word
[2:01:43] the message the Bible gives us the tools
[2:01:46] the Holy Ghost low-rate gives us the
[2:01:48] tools to be able to fight against the
[2:01:51] unknown I made to God tap out by the way
[2:01:56] although I think he was just doing that
[2:01:58] not to hurt my feelings
[2:02:02] Alleluia now just just just a little
[2:02:06] moment here amen I want to give you
[2:02:10] another one here we'll pick this up
[2:02:11] tonight the future belongs to you how do
[2:02:18] I know that Saint John chapter 14 verse
[2:02:20] 1 let not your heart be troubled you
[2:02:23] believe in God believe also in me verse
[2:02:24] 2 in my father's house are many mansions
[2:02:26] if it were not so I would have told you
[2:02:27] I go to prepare a place for you verse 3
[2:02:30] and if I prepare a place for you I'll
[2:02:32] come again receive you unto myself that
[2:02:33] where I am there ye may be also well why
[2:02:38] would he make a future home for me
[2:02:40] brother Jesse if he didn't plan on
[2:02:43] giving me a future or to God the devil I
[2:02:49] tell you you have no future how do you
[2:02:51] put this in the Word of God then he put
[2:02:55] it in the word because the bride has a
[2:02:58] future I don't care what kind of thing
[2:03:01] you've been through I don't care how bad
[2:03:02] it's been or how ugly it's been or what
[2:03:04] somebody said about you and how your
[2:03:07] past is what all that looks like God
[2:03:09] give you an evident future and he wants
[2:03:11] you to look to the future I know I know
[2:03:13] I know I know I know
[2:03:14] man's always praising God for what he
[2:03:16] will do what he did do and Miss and what
[2:03:18] he's doing I get that but there are
[2:03:20] elements of your walk with God that has
[2:03:22] to be tied to expectation there are
[2:03:24] elements of your faith that has to be
[2:03:26] tied to an expectation you can believe
[2:03:28] God all day but if you have no
[2:03:29] expectation that's going to happen it'll
[2:03:31] never come to your doorstep you've got
[2:03:34] to expect it in other words you've got
[2:03:35] to look to the future of things that are
[2:03:37] although we're not supposed to look to
[2:03:39] the Mantegna father tomorrow that's not
[2:03:41] what Jesus is referring
[2:03:42] to Jesus is referring to don't make a
[2:03:45] bunch of plans that you don't know if
[2:03:46] it's gonna work out that way or not
[2:03:48] always seek first the kingdom of God in
[2:03:50] the will of God because when you make
[2:03:52] plans that's what you want make God
[2:03:53] laugh you want to tell him a joke tell
[2:03:55] him your plans God I'm gonna do this I'm
[2:03:59] gonna do that I'm gonna do the other be
[2:04:01] careful when you're making plans because
[2:04:02] you don't know the will of God for your
[2:04:04] life so if you take thought for tomorrow
[2:04:06] you hear them saying to you if you take
[2:04:09] thought for tomorrow tomorrow must be
[2:04:11] like this God you know what tomorrow is
[2:04:13] I'm committing tomorrow to your hands
[2:04:15] today and whatever you look for me I'm
[2:04:19] here to let you walk me into that vision
[2:04:21] remember what he said if you're sick and
[2:04:23] you want to be well it said catch a
[2:04:24] vision of a well person and walk until
[2:04:26] you can step into that vision of that
[2:04:28] well person there's nothing wrong we're
[2:04:30] looking to the future but you got to
[2:04:32] remember the future is not determined by
[2:04:34] what we want or what we say or what we
[2:04:36] think the future is determined on what
[2:04:38] God wants for our lives that's why when
[2:04:41] Jesus said take no thought for the day
[2:04:43] suffice the evil in other words what
[2:04:45] he's saying is I can't say well I'm
[2:04:47] gonna be a schoolteacher maybe I will
[2:04:49] maybe I won't I'm gonna be a doctor I
[2:04:52] don't know maybe I will maybe alone I'm
[2:04:54] gonna be a lawyer maybe you will maybe
[2:04:56] you won't take don't take the thought
[2:04:58] for tomorrow like that wake up tomorrow
[2:05:00] saying God whatever your will is that's
[2:05:03] what I want but remember the principle
[2:05:05] is God's gonna give you a future ever
[2:05:07] what that future is there's Lord people
[2:05:13] make plans and their plans aren't
[2:05:16] necessarily huh maybe what God expects
[2:05:19] him to be I mean let's just let's just
[2:05:21] face facts when Martin Luther was
[2:05:23] standing there in that Catholic Church
[2:05:25] and he was going through all of his
[2:05:26] doctors degrees and he was becoming a
[2:05:28] great man I highly doubt that Martin
[2:05:31] Luther would have jumped up and realized
[2:05:32] one day that he'd been sitting out there
[2:05:34] almost the most hated man in the
[2:05:36] Catholic Church if he wasn't the hated
[2:05:37] man I'm sure he never realized that his
[2:05:40] message of justification would start a
[2:05:42] Reformation that would sweep the entire
[2:05:44] globe decide that little spot in Germany
[2:05:47] down there I'm sure that John Wesley
[2:05:49] never thought of himself as being much
[2:05:52] more than just a regular old student of
[2:05:53] college not knowing that God had made
[2:05:55] him a star before even
[2:05:56] realize that he was a son and as he
[2:06:01] stood out there and God moved on him
[2:06:03] with the Holy Spirit and showed him the
[2:06:05] message of sanctification and how to get
[2:06:06] right with God I'm sure he never
[2:06:08] realized what his future would be what
[2:06:10] about brother Branham in this day he
[2:06:12] said all these branham's I knew he said
[2:06:14] my branham's they died with their boots
[2:06:15] on he said none of them was nothing but
[2:06:17] a bunch of alcoholics and here stands
[2:06:19] with the Brenham and a leader of the
[2:06:22] entire generation God made him a great
[2:06:25] man so if he'd have made plans he'd have
[2:06:27] been in trouble oh here we go
[2:06:30] brother Brennan made some plans one time
[2:06:33] he tells us about it standing in the gap
[2:06:35] in 1963 he got discouraged because he
[2:06:37] didn't think people wanted to hear his
[2:06:38] message and he'd made some plans he was
[2:06:40] going to go to the woods like a prophet
[2:06:42] and come out with us say if the Lord is
[2:06:43] he's gonna go be a trapper up in Him
[2:06:45] woods and God said if you carry on your
[2:06:47] plans your wife will leave you Billy
[2:06:48] won't stay with you it'll ruin
[2:06:50] everything and God had to give him a
[2:06:51] picture of what his future looked like
[2:06:53] he was standing in a trash dump talking
[2:06:55] about used to be a leader of the bride
[2:06:57] that's what your plans look like but if
[2:07:01] you stick with the program God gives you
[2:07:04] a future he gives you a few Tura cording
[2:07:08] to his own choosing praise God
[2:07:12] Oh aren't you grateful to the Lord for
[2:07:14] it I'm so thankful a man I love this
[2:07:20] Amen he gives you a future brother mem
[2:07:23] said like this in future home he said
[2:07:25] there's a said help us Lord he said
[2:07:27] there's one that called to this wedding
[2:07:28] supper the land this thousand years of
[2:07:30] millennial reign to enter into the city
[2:07:33] after the honeymoon is over he said the
[2:07:34] Millennium is merely the honeymoon they
[2:07:36] said then she the bride the bridegroom
[2:07:38] will take his bride home it's hers
[2:07:40] glory her bridegroom his bride love this
[2:07:43] statement and he's gone to prepare a
[2:07:45] house since he's become engaged and in
