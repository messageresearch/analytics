[0:00] Lord such beautiful lyrics Lord it just
[0:02] takes us back to why we are saved
[0:04] because of the Cross Hallelujah it
[0:06] reminds us we'll always remember Lord as
[0:09] even Revelation 5 shows these 24 Elders
[0:12] they got these beautiful crowns but yet
[0:13] when the lamb walks out they throw the
[0:15] crowns down at the feet of the Lamb
[0:17] they'll always remember Calvary Lord God
[0:20] and so we remember it tonight Lord God
[0:22] that you died for our sins you make us
[0:24] blameless spotless without rebuke
[0:27] Hallelujah you did that Lord God it's
[0:29] your Amazing Grace
[0:30] we're Justified as we would like to be
[0:33] Hallelujah forgiven by the blood of
[0:35] Jesus Christ forgiven all trespasses
[0:39] Hallelujah the scripture says Lord
[0:41] there's no one that can condemn us who
[0:43] shall lay any charge to God's elect we
[0:45] thank you Lord for that and we know your
[0:47] elect because we've responded to your
[0:49] word Lord God we know that can't happen
[0:51] unless Lord You've ordained it you
[0:53] predestinated Lord God that we could you
[0:56] given us the gift of faith Hallelujah
[0:58] given us the gift of Grace Lord God we
[1:00] thank you for Amazing Grace we come
[1:02] humbly tonight Lord God bless your word
[1:05] bless the reading of Thy word Lord Jesus
[1:06] let these words sink down into our
[1:07] hearts Lord God use us God For Your
[1:10] Glory we thank you Lord God have your
[1:12] way here tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[1:14] Saints
[1:15] said amen God bless you let's take our
[1:17] Bibles here tonight thank you musicians
[1:19] appreciate
[1:20] that let's go to Mark chapter 11 here by
[1:23] the grace of the Lord I'd like to
[1:25] continue on this little series of uh
[1:26] songs that we've been sorry sermons that
[1:29] we've beening singing in that
[1:31] song so I'm going to preach on perfect
[1:33] Faith tonight by God's grace Mark
[1:42] 11 22 Mark
[1:53] 1122 trust everybody's had a good week
[1:55] in the Lord by God's grace hallelujah
[1:57] it's good to see the Saints again amen
[1:58] hallelujah
[2:07] this might be a part one we'll kind of
[2:08] see how this goes here tonight you know
[2:10] voice seems to go slower than what I
[2:12] think it's going to go it's kind of the
[2:14] nature of the preaching by God's grace
[2:18] so Mark 11:22 here
[2:31] I'll read 22 uh and then we could all
[2:33] read
[2:35] 23 and then after that I'll do 24 25 and
[2:39] 26 so the main verse we' like to read is
[2:41] 23 together by God's so I'll start with
[2:43] 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them
[2:46] have faith in God let's read 23 1 2 3
[2:51] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[2:54] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[2:57] removed and be thou cast cast into the
[3:00] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[3:04] shall believe that those things which he
[3:07] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[3:10] whatsoever he saith amen I just thought
[3:13] while we're praying here or reading that
[3:15] I just thought of Zechariah so I'm write
[3:17] that
[3:20] down where he uh he spoke to the Mount
[3:24] right told the mountain be thou removed
[3:27] so interesting Zechariah would tell
[3:30] rub this mountain shall be removed but
[3:33] it wasn't a mountain
[3:35] Hallelujah that would probably play into
[3:38] the word of God here verse
[3:41] 25 I'm sorry verse 24 therefore I say to
[3:44] you whatsoever things soever you desire
[3:46] When you pray believe that you receive
[3:48] them and you shall have them and when
[3:50] you stand praying forgive brother man
[3:52] will tell us later in this
[3:53] sermon faith is based on forgiveness
[3:57] wasn't it very timing you know brother
[3:58] Brooks preached that little message
[3:59] there forgiveness what a wonderful
[4:01] message by God's grace if ye have all
[4:05] against any so if you have anything
[4:07] against anybody and you're standing
[4:09] there praying forgive them as you're
[4:11] praying right as you're standing there
[4:13] worshiping God or you're here in the
[4:14] house of God if you have anything
[4:16] against anybody let Let It Go by God's
[4:18] grace forgive them Hallelujah if you
[4:20] need to go talk to that person then go
[4:22] talk to them by God's grace you know
[4:23] there's some things that we don't have
[4:24] to go confess to people if it's you know
[4:26] something maybe small that they did or
[4:28] something like that if they really hurt
[4:29] you you can't get over something then
[4:30] yes you want to definitely go talk to
[4:32] them by God's grace I think as we mature
[4:34] as Christians we understand when we need
[4:36] to do that don't you think that by God's
[4:37] grace
[4:42] Hallelujah that your father also which
[4:45] is in heaven May forgive you your
[4:47] trespasses so what a lesson that is God
[4:50] will not forgive us until we forgive
[4:52] others think about that someone could
[4:53] say I'm sorry God forgive me God a
[4:56] hundred times and God will withhold that
[4:58] forgiveness until that person forgive
[5:01] somebody else there's that no doubt
[5:03] that's why many people come to church
[5:05] they ask God for forgiveness and they
[5:06] don't even feel it right they don't feel
[5:08] forgiven because in their hearts they
[5:10] know they've got to forgive
[5:12] someone God will withhold that feeling
[5:15] of
[5:16] forgiveness and that's why no doubt
[5:17] people can't have joy people can't have
[5:19] uh Victory many times because they don't
[5:21] forgive verse 26 but if you do not
[5:24] forgive neither will your father which
[5:26] is in heaven forgive your trespasses
[5:28] they God add his Blessing to read his
[5:30] word may be seated praise
[5:32] God so again I'm going to hit the
[5:34] highlights here by the God's grace you
[5:36] know I couldn't I couldn't uh it would
[5:38] take me weeks and weeks just to preach
[5:39] one sermon if I preached all the quotes
[5:42] what I'm hoping you've done if you
[5:44] haven't done it yet is you've gone
[5:45] listen to recognizing your day in this
[5:47] message I hope somebody's done that by
[5:48] God's grace and I hope maybe somebody's
[5:50] listened to serpent seed
[5:53] 1958 I sure enjoyed that last week that
[5:55] was such a blessing that message now
[5:58] here of course perfect Fai it's a short
[5:59] message I think it's only an hour and 40
[6:01] minutes you know it's not going to take
[6:02] you forever to get through it's a
[6:03] beautiful message I listen to it
[6:05] numerous times and uh I'm going to hit
[6:07] the highlights here again we'll see if
[6:09] we do one part or maybe two parts here
[6:13] by God's grace brother Ram starts off
[6:16] the opening prayer by saying we've
[6:17] assembled together to only believe just
[6:19] believe the Lord Jesus there are those
[6:22] here tonight who are sick and Afflicted
[6:24] and we've dedicated our service tonight
[6:25] to the healing of the sick and broken
[6:28] body and then he finishes the prayer he
[6:32] said' Grant it Lord and help us as we
[6:33] look to the word now now look look to
[6:35] the word to find Faith sufficient for
[6:37] this hour we ask it in Jesus name so
[6:41] just a good reminder you know the reason
[6:43] we're in a service is so that we can
[6:44] find faith in that word that we're going
[6:46] to hear that night you know the reason
[6:48] you were here Sunday was to hear what
[6:50] brother Keith was preaching so you could
[6:52] receive something from that sermon
[6:54] Hallelujah same thing down there you
[6:56] know in uh Junction City I'll just share
[6:58] a little bit uh
[7:00] after the service you I was wondering
[7:01] why I was preaching the message I was
[7:02] preaching I have I had a real hard time
[7:04] knowing what to preach sometimes I know
[7:05] exactly what I'm going to preach other
[7:06] times I feel like I'm just wandering in
[7:08] the dark you know I I don't even know
[7:10] what to say Sunday was one of those
[7:12] times I didn't know what to preach I
[7:13] just had no idea um I preached on but in
[7:16] the days of the voice of the seventh
[7:18] angel I just was preaching a Ministry
[7:20] teaching more or a service on brother
[7:21] R's Ministry I went a lot through
[7:24] Revelation 10 and I got to the end you
[7:26] know and it wasn't Extremely Loud
[7:28] service or W I felt more free as the
[7:31] service went on but I didn't see
[7:33] anything Supernatural maybe going on
[7:35] until we started the prayer line at the
[7:37] end and then I said uh you who has need
[7:40] of requests and there was many people
[7:43] numerous people I should say many
[7:44] there's numerous people come up for
[7:45] prayer they're a small Church like us
[7:46] right but numerous people come up for
[7:48] prayer but then two people in a row had
[7:50] dreams just that week about witnessing
[7:54] to specific people in their family and
[7:57] they come up weeping and crying and the
[7:59] whole point of my message was it's our
[8:02] turn to eat the book Revelation 10 is
[8:04] brother braham's Ministry is done now we
[8:06] eat the
[8:07] book and I just emphasized a few times
[8:10] over the course of that sermon you know
[8:12] you're going to eat the book right and
[8:13] it's sweet in your mouth in other words
[8:15] it's lovely to talk about right but it's
[8:18] something else to become one with that
[8:20] word it's bitter right it's not easy to
[8:24] digest right it's not it's not easy to
[8:27] live all this these wonderful
[8:28] Revelations that we're
[8:30] hearing and so I emphasize that numerous
[8:32] times it's our duty now you know it's
[8:34] we've got a responsibility we've got to
[8:36] eat the open book John literally didn't
[8:38] fulfill uh taking the gospel Revelation
[8:41] 1011 he didn't fulfill that he didn't
[8:43] travel much after the a Patmos and then
[8:45] he died as an old man you know we know
[8:46] the
[8:47] story uh the disciple of Love they
[8:49] called him you know at the end of his
[8:50] life he was saying oh children he
[8:52] couldn't preach anymore and they just
[8:53] say John you want to say something from
[8:54] the back maybe he say little children
[8:57] love one another that's what history
[8:58] says about John brother R repeats it
[9:01] numerous times you hear him say that
[9:02] kind of like how John Wesley died and
[9:04] the last things he said I told you that
[9:06] was uh the best part of all is that God
[9:08] is with us remember think of that his
[9:10] last words he said the best thing is God
[9:13] is with us and the soul went to meet
[9:16] Christ amen what a testimony and then he
[9:19] was with Christ Hallelujah forever for
[9:21] eternity in a brand new body Hallelujah
[9:23] as one of the stars in the hands of
[9:25] Jesus
[9:27] Hallelujah and so you know I just
[9:29] thought and then you know to see them
[9:30] cry to see the sincerity my wife even
[9:32] remarked afterwards you know just to see
[9:34] these people are so sincere you know
[9:36] they're they're at the they're at the
[9:37] fresh stages of coming the message right
[9:39] they've been in the message one year you
[9:41] think about when you were in the message
[9:42] one year you know we'd all have to go
[9:44] back to that what was that like you know
[9:46] when there was explosion of Revelation
[9:48] in every service you know there was
[9:50] fireworks every service oh oh man
[9:53] serpent seed non- eternal hell water
[9:55] baptism godhead you know Divine Healing
[9:58] Miracles you know all the revelations
[10:00] anointed ones of the end time you know
[10:02] marriage and divorce it was every
[10:03] service was a firework service I know
[10:06] that's how was for me you know uh but to
[10:10] see them come up and they're praying
[10:11] Lord we want to see and there a lot of
[10:13] them are being rejected by family right
[10:15] now and persecuted now I need to put
[10:17] that sermon out maybe I'll do that
[10:18] tomorrow morning before work or
[10:20] something like that I just keep
[10:21] forgetting to do that um but it was just
[10:23] such a wonderful thing you know in other
[10:25] words they didn't let the service go by
[10:28] without seeing how does this apply to my
[10:30] life and they came up for prayer and I
[10:32] said ABS I said absolutely I believe
[10:34] with all my heart those dreams were from
[10:36] God you know uh because it's they were
[10:39] praying and it in the case it was
[10:41] sisters that wanted to speak now that's
[10:43] something right because sisters uh they
[10:45] the devil might make them feel oh you're
[10:46] just trying to preach what a but it's a
[10:49] testimony it's not a preaching it's a
[10:51] testimony right and so these these
[10:53] sisters wanted to go share with
[10:54] different family members testimonies
[10:58] right about the message
[11:00] and God I believe God is leading them to
[11:02] do that praise God and I just shared
[11:04] with them I said you know I believe
[11:05] that's of God you just wait on God I
[11:07] said maybe you'll write a letter I've
[11:09] done that with numerous people I've
[11:10] shared the message through letters if
[11:11] they won't talk on the phone or they
[11:13] won't talk to me at all I said just
[11:15] watch it I said now watch it remember
[11:17] this prayer because it might be a few
[11:19] years down the road with the Lord teres
[11:20] where they might get to witness that
[11:22] family member right my wife and I we
[11:24] told you we had dreams and maybe it
[11:25] wasn't until a year later two year two
[11:27] years later few I I told Brother Brooks
[11:29] about that dream I I told you about the
[11:31] man playing tennis he's like that's
[11:32] right I forgot about that he said no
[11:34] doubt that was fulfilled but it took
[11:36] years you know it took a few years to
[11:37] get to that point but our Point as I
[11:40] said is that we want to look to the word
[11:42] tonight to receive Faith sufficient for
[11:45] this hour
[11:48] Hallelujah brother Ram say now it's not
[11:50] too often we get to do these healing
[11:51] Services because usually now brother
[11:53] says usually the holy spirit will come
[11:55] around when there's an emergency case
[11:57] and discern it right quick
[11:59] and pick out something about something
[12:02] and then say
[12:03] it he said but I believe in Healing The
[12:06] Sick I believe it's a Bible command uh
[12:09] case you put up uh Mark 1618 we cannot
[12:12] preach that without the Full Gospel
[12:15] without including that so the gospel
[12:17] means good news Jesus did not just go
[12:19] around teaching all the time he healed
[12:21] the sick hallelujah it's part of the
[12:25] Gospel they shall take up serpents and
[12:27] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[12:29] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[12:31] the sick and they shall recover amen so
[12:34] brother man said it's a Bible command
[12:36] we've got to do that we've got to lay
[12:38] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[12:41] Hallelujah now before brother M gets to
[12:43] the text he says uh now he talks about
[12:46] how people have been TR driving many
[12:48] miles to hear his sermons he said many
[12:51] of you will be waiting over to the
[12:53] morning that's got a long distance to go
[12:54] and I appreciate that effort some of you
[12:57] will drive home tonight cuz you got to
[12:58] go to work by daylight in the morning I
[13:00] know it's hard and then when I think he
[13:02] said I see that he said I get spells too
[13:05] you know you know I get moody anybody
[13:08] ever know brother R got
[13:10] Moody I get moody I get to a spot where
[13:13] what gets me is where I get those spells
[13:15] when I get all
[13:17] overworked anybody feel stressed out
[13:19] from work this
[13:21] week and Satan comes telling me why
[13:23] nobody cares for you you haven't got a
[13:25] friend in the world see so brother ad
[13:28] could see a pattern of his life every
[13:30] time I get overworked Satan comes in he
[13:32] tells me the same thing over and over
[13:34] again nobody loves you nobody cares
[13:36] about you you don't got a friend in the
[13:38] world nobody in this whole world even
[13:39] cares about
[13:40] you
[13:42] Hallelujah he said you're not alone he
[13:44] said we all go through that he said
[13:46] remember I'm not immune to
[13:48] Temptation see I got to overcome that
[13:52] but then when I looked back and see
[13:53] something like this he's talking about
[13:54] people driving up from Georgia to hear
[13:56] one sermon in Indiana
[13:59] from
[14:00] Georgia I think it was eight hours he
[14:02] said eight hours for one sermon some of
[14:05] us got I got to drive 25 minutes to
[14:08] church he said I put that right back in
[14:11] his face Satan and say what about that
[14:14] he said that helps me to overcome what
[14:16] about that Satan hallelujah praise God
[14:19] Amen so see church when Satan lies to
[14:22] you you got to find something to put
[14:23] back in his
[14:24] face this proves you're wrong
[14:27] Satan Hallelujah
[14:31] so we all get moody we all get
[14:33] discouraged we all go through
[14:34] Temptations but the whole point of that
[14:36] is so you'll overcome that remember God
[14:39] allowed you to go through these things
[14:41] so you would
[14:42] overcome God allowed Satan to whisper
[14:44] that in your
[14:45] ear right he had to get
[14:48] permission so find a way to overcome
[14:51] find a good scripture tonight to
[14:52] overcome Hallelujah and then brother R
[14:54] reads this text as we read before
[14:56] brother ra takes this this text he says
[14:59] now let's turn in now into that blessed
[15:02] Bible anybody open up your blessed Bible
[15:05] this morning and read it it's a bless
[15:08] it'll be a blessing to you if you
[15:10] do I want to read a passage that used to
[15:13] just turn me around we just thinking
[15:14] about being picked up and turn around
[15:15] well this is a different turn around
[15:17] that's a turnar around when you get
[15:18] saved Hallelujah brother said reading
[15:20] the Bible used to turn him around in
[15:23] other words I don't understand what's
[15:24] going
[15:26] on he said uh
[15:30] and then he says uh that was he said
[15:32] when I spoke this he said when God had
[15:34] me speak the seven squirrels into
[15:35] existence he said that was the very
[15:37] scripture I was thinking on Mark 11:22
[15:40] it's always been a puzzle anybody ever
[15:42] had any puzzles in the Bible you read
[15:43] the Bible looks like a puzzle all
[15:44] scattered about pieces are all over the
[15:48] place he said if ye say not if I say if
[15:52] you say so that's what puzzled brother
[15:54] brandom where Jesus would say if you
[15:56] speak to the mountain it will move
[15:59] move right now of course if you know the
[16:02] context earlier in in Mark 11 the
[16:05] context is Jesus went up to a fig tree
[16:08] this is right before he passed away
[16:09] right sorry right before he was
[16:10] crucified rather and he he went to get a
[16:13] fruit off and it wasn't even in in
[16:15] season it was out of
[16:17] season and there was no fig there and he
[16:19] says no man eat of this tree from
[16:22] Hereafter he basically cursed the
[16:24] tree and you know some people might be
[16:26] confused about that but it's it's this
[16:28] idea idea of this fig tree represents
[16:31] Israel right the Fig Tree represents
[16:33] Israel so Jesus came to Israel to get
[16:37] some fruit to get some Believers am but
[16:40] they weren't
[16:41] producing
[16:43] right and really uh it it was a very
[16:46] good type of their Jesus coming to
[16:47] Israel and they had no fruit to
[16:50] give but God wanted
[16:53] fruit right God wanted fruit and since
[16:55] they didn't have fruit God cursed them
[16:58] right God the blood curse to come upon
[17:00] them that's why the Holocaust happened
[17:02] that's why they're still battling now of
[17:03] course there's a ceasefire now thank God
[17:04] for that we'll see how that goes but
[17:07] it's a type of Israel and then they go
[17:09] into Jerusalem they come out and the
[17:10] disciples see ma it's withered already
[17:13] just wasn't very long maybe it was a day
[17:15] I think it was wasn't very long at
[17:17] all and they're said my how how how
[17:20] powerful this is and this is the context
[17:22] where Jesus says if you say to the
[17:25] mountain and don't doubt you'll have
[17:27] what you asked for
[17:29] right Hallelujah and that's what turned
[17:31] brother Bram around he's like not not if
[17:34] God says but if you
[17:36] say hallelujah now I'm sure you already
[17:39] know the balance to this because you've
[17:41] already I'm sure you've already tried at
[17:42] some point to name it and claim it
[17:44] haven't we all as young Christians right
[17:47] you know you know as a new Christian you
[17:48] know God will answer some amazing
[17:49] prayers right we'll become new
[17:50] Christians I think of Austin and myself
[17:52] you know God did these great prayers and
[17:54] then we think well what else could God
[17:56] do which is it's okay okay thing to
[17:59] think but it's
[18:01] immature like like you know we I
[18:04] witnessed in one Souls right away when I
[18:06] got saved and I'm just like wow I'm
[18:07] going to win some more souls this
[18:09] person's going to come in this person no
[18:10] doubt this person will see it well if I
[18:12] just speak it but they don't come in
[18:14] just because I speak it it's got to be
[18:16] led of God hallelujah it all comes back
[18:19] to that praise God hallelujah this is
[18:21] what brother Ram learned of
[18:23] course and so we see that now hold your
[18:25] spot there I do want to read that in
[18:26] Zechariah because that just no man all
[18:29] these years man did I forget this
[18:31] Zechariah Chapter
[18:32] 4 amazing how I mean I just if I forgot
[18:35] that Lord forgive me that this is what
[18:37] the Bible says Doctrine must be built
[18:39] line upon line precept upon precept here
[18:42] a little there little Isaiah
[18:44] 28 Whom Shall God teach Doctrine the
[18:46] Bible said Whom Shall he wean from the
[18:49] breast right in other words who will be
[18:52] a child of God
[18:54] elhadi that could be there's more to
[18:56] study on that but Shad means breast and
[18:58] God came to Abraham as the elhadi the
[19:02] breasted one according to scoffield so
[19:05] God was telling Abraham you got a nurse
[19:07] you got to be real close to me you got
[19:08] to nurse your strength from me
[19:11] Hallelujah and then Isaiah says who's
[19:15] going to learn the doctrine it's those
[19:16] who come close to God and draw their
[19:19] strength from God
[19:20] hallelujah but like like a mother knows
[19:23] or anyone who's seen a baby they don't
[19:26] just drink all the time or they just
[19:27] don't pull all the time they they got to
[19:28] have little breaks right they got to
[19:31] have breaks I think I know what I'm
[19:32] talking about I've had eight children I
[19:34] think you just can't drink all night you
[19:37] know and uh they got to have a little
[19:38] break so it's here a little there a
[19:40] little they wake up in the I know this
[19:42] for sure they'll wake up in the middle
[19:43] of night and want a nurse you know I
[19:45] know that for sure I've shared my bed
[19:47] for 20 years huah with
[19:49] babies they' woke me up many time even
[19:51] this little this big guy down
[19:53] here not not a little guy
[19:56] anymore and so God gives this this
[19:58] picture
[19:59] this is what it's like to understand
[20:01] God's word you got to feed a little bit
[20:03] on God's word here a little bit of there
[20:05] a little bit of there hallelujah amen
[20:08] this whole time did I forget this my
[20:10] forgive me Lord if I forgot this but
[20:11] Zechariah Chapter
[20:13] 4 because I I know I preached it before
[20:16] that it's not necessarily speaking of
[20:17] mountains now if you were in the Old
[20:19] Testament or something like that or you
[20:21] needed a mountain moved or some physical
[20:23] thing mov yes you could they'd speak to
[20:24] the mountain it even happened in the New
[20:26] Testament right uh Paul and Barnabas uh
[20:28] were in the prison right and they just
[20:30] sang they just prayed and it shook the
[20:33] jail and the jail was broken up and the
[20:36] prisoners were set free Hallelujah a
[20:38] natural Mountain Moving Hallelujah a
[20:42] natural mountain and even Jesus speaking
[20:44] of that fig tree it's the same thing
[20:46] right it's a mountain moving it's an
[20:48] obstacle moving something's happening
[20:51] instantaneously praise God hallelujah
[20:54] Zechariah
[20:56] 4 now yeah there it is verse uh verse
[21:00] six then he answered and spake unto me
[21:02] saying this is the word of the Lord un
[21:03] iserable saying not by mind not by power
[21:05] but by my spirit sayi the Lord of hosts
[21:07] so how do mountains move by the Holy
[21:10] Spirit not by our thinking not by our
[21:13] power if I can just work myself enough
[21:15] enough faith of that's impossible you
[21:17] can't work it you don't even have any
[21:19] faith Hallelujah you've only got a
[21:20] natural faith we got to have the Faith
[21:22] of Christ Hallelujah I can already tell
[21:24] this going to be a part one
[21:26] Hallelujah this ain't going to get I'm
[21:27] not going to finish these no
[21:29] who art thou oh great mountain and he's
[21:31] talking about he's talking about the
[21:33] political forces that were making Israel
[21:36] afraid of finishing the
[21:39] temple remember they had a they had a
[21:41] they were working hard they built the
[21:43] altar right but then they started
[21:46] building the Temple and they got letters
[21:47] from the government and they're afraid
[21:49] so they stopped building for 16
[21:52] years and how is God going to get them
[21:54] to start building again he's got to send
[21:56] prophets amen amen he's got to send
[21:59] somebody with thus sayith the Lord
[22:00] hallelujah what gets you going when you
[22:03] hear a scripture you forgot about amen
[22:05] when somebody preaches something you
[22:07] know God's talking to you that causes
[22:09] you to believe the word of God and the
[22:11] Bible said they prospered through the
[22:13] prophecy of heah and Zechariah
[22:17] amen what s you up only the word s you
[22:21] up praise God like just like
[22:24] them he says before he said oh great
[22:27] Mountain he said before Zub Thou shalt
[22:29] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[22:31] The Headstone that was the top of the
[22:33] temple right the last Stone in the
[22:35] temple with shoutings crying Grace Grace
[22:38] unto it a double portion of favor
[22:41] hallelujah praise God more favor but and
[22:43] I preached that sermon last year
[22:45] remember I preached this uh uh uh Grace
[22:49] Grace yeah the head head Shone shouting
[22:51] Grace Grace and it's just double favor
[22:54] it's like a double anointing
[22:56] Hallelujah Glory Elisha had a double
[22:59] anointing so he said he did double
[23:00] miracles in
[23:01] Elijah Hallelujah and brother man types
[23:04] this last Stone as Jesus coming back
[23:06] because remember he's a stone that comes
[23:08] back like Daniel chapter 2 he's a stone
[23:11] that comes down and he strikes the image
[23:12] at the feet he's a stone he's a precious
[23:16] Cornerstone
[23:20] amen and it comes down with Grace Grace
[23:23] but here we can see a pattern how many
[23:24] can see a pattern how many can see the
[23:26] pattern if you speak to the mountain if
[23:28] you speak to the obstacle and it's God
[23:31] leading you to do it it's going to move
[23:35] Hallelujah all right now back to Mark 8
[23:38] Mark 11
[23:44] sorry now brother man says now faith is
[23:46] based on forgiveness because we read
[23:47] that it's also in James 5:15 so in case
[23:49] you when never ready uh pull that up now
[23:51] look what brother man says uh brother
[23:53] Dennis McBride used this quote a couple
[23:55] years ago when he was preaching it
[23:56] wasn't this last time uh it was a coule
[23:58] a couple years ago brother R said we're
[24:00] trying to get the church into a place to
[24:03] where we could really see Apostolic
[24:04] times moving Among Us how many want that
[24:07] where you're excited to come to church
[24:09] right now we're all going to battle but
[24:11] we all know there sometimes we're more
[24:12] excited than others oh I know brother
[24:14] Brooks is in town I know I'll get there
[24:16] you know I'll be more excited during the
[24:18] service
[24:19] right that's the pastor you know the
[24:22] pastor's always there you know so I
[24:24] understand I want you to be excited for
[24:25] brother I want you to be more excited
[24:26] for brother Brooks than me okay I I want
[24:28] that I'm here all the time um but here
[24:32] Apostolic times though is the fear of
[24:34] the Lord that's what I'm talking about
[24:36] the fear of God where we know God's
[24:39] moving and we don't want to miss what
[24:41] God's doing we don't we don't want to
[24:43] grieve the Holy Spirit praise God we
[24:45] want to be ready for the spirit of God
[24:47] to move
[24:48] Hallelujah like we uh like I think it
[24:51] was uh sister Nomi that put that text in
[24:53] there for the group you know we needed a
[24:54] dance service after all the legal things
[24:56] you know just the fears you know it was
[24:59] like attacks of the devil you know it
[25:00] really was I know I was going to bed
[25:02] fearful I know I had to quote the
[25:03] scripture just to go to bed a season of
[25:05] fear and then and then on top of that
[25:07] the identity theft and all these things
[25:09] it was an awful month it was aw uh but
[25:12] thank God it's over Hallelujah by God's
[25:13] grace by God's grace by God's grace you
[25:15] never know what these some of these
[25:17] people but he says now we want to see
[25:20] Apostolic times Among Us that were all
[25:22] hunger for it's just laying right at the
[25:25] door see but we want to see more of it
[25:27] we want to see such a a flow that it'll
[25:29] be a help to us and flow out to others
[25:33] amen I like that see so when we're on
[25:35] fire for God we want to see God flow in
[25:37] our lives and then bless somebody else
[25:39] as well Amen in other words I want to
[25:41] see God use this old bag of bones can I
[25:44] just quote that song that we sang
[25:45] earlier God use this bag of bones
[25:47] Hallelujah just use this old uh pest
[25:50] house brother BR calls it use me flow
[25:52] out of me flow through me Holy Spirit
[25:55] Hallelujah we sing that song flow
[25:56] through me Holy Spirit flow through me
[25:58] as I lift my hands to worship and
[25:59] magnify the name flow through me Holy
[26:01] Spirit flow through me hallelujah amen
[26:04] it's that that's what we're talking
[26:05] about Apostolic
[26:08] times so that's what brother M's prayer
[26:10] is before he starts I'm sorry a
[26:12] statement right before he starts
[26:13] preaching on this now uh brother R says
[26:16] I want to preach you on a different type
[26:18] of Faith he says perfect
[26:20] Faith
[26:23] Hallelujah he said that's a great thing
[26:25] now we're told in the Bible Faith cometh
[26:26] by hearing you cannot be saved with
[26:28] without faith faith is something you
[26:29] have to have to believe it's there that
[26:31] not that really nothing else will
[26:33] declare it it's there but
[26:35] Faith now I'm trying to bring you bring
[26:38] Faith to you so that you can be ready
[26:39] for this prayer line in the next few
[26:42] minutes so in a healing service brother
[26:45] R is specifically preaching on faith to
[26:47] raise their faith so that when we pray
[26:50] God can
[26:51] move but remember in the in we always
[26:54] know with wisdom of God it's still got
[26:55] to be God's time and season
[26:58] right it's always got to be God's time
[26:59] and season but as I've told you before I
[27:01] believe it's over 90 some per of the
[27:03] time God wants to move in many in in
[27:06] sick cases I'm talking about when people
[27:07] are
[27:09] sick right like even with brother Phil
[27:11] who would have thought God did over
[27:12] eight miracles for him with just your
[27:14] prayers I
[27:16] mean make a guess how long did you pray
[27:18] for Phil when I sent that text did you
[27:20] did you pray a minute I don't
[27:22] know
[27:24] maybe you know but think you know God
[27:27] and then he he he says thank the church
[27:29] for praying for me so see it it don't
[27:32] have to be an hourong prayer now if God
[27:33] leads you to that wonderful but God sees
[27:36] the sincerity of our hearts hallelujah
[27:38] it's the quality Hallelujah if we're if
[27:40] we're if we don't have a lot of time
[27:42] then God looks at the quality of it
[27:45] Hallelujah but see the the preaching of
[27:47] the word that's something I want to grow
[27:48] in too you know I'm as I told you I'm
[27:50] I'm I'm a teacher many times you know in
[27:52] a pastor of course I want to uh I think
[27:54] these sermons help help me also get my
[27:56] thoughts on the supernatural as well
[27:59] Hallelujah so I want to be able to
[28:00] preach that Hallelujah by God's grace
[28:03] brother R said now Faith he that cometh
[28:05] to God must believe that he is that's
[28:07] Hebrews 11 and it's impossible to please
[28:09] God without faith you cannot please him
[28:12] now remember faith is Assurance Church
[28:14] Assurance that's the actual meaning of
[28:16] it you cannot please God without
[28:19] assurance that God hears you where God
[28:22] sees you and it Assurance is a substance
[28:26] that's what faith is it's a substance
[28:28] and brother says nothing else declares
[28:30] it does your clothes today or Malachi
[28:34] and Austin got a nice haircut does your
[28:35] haircut declare faith is that does that
[28:37] declare Faith No just your shirt or your
[28:40] shoes or does that no you have no proof
[28:43] of it the only proof you have is inside
[28:46] of you
[28:47] amen the only proof is that you know
[28:50] something inside of me believes God I'm
[28:54] trusting God Amen and that's why good
[28:57] Services help stir that up Hallelujah CU
[28:59] we'll go throughout the day we'll forget
[29:00] about what we believe we'll forget about
[29:02] our promises that we're holding on to
[29:03] Hallelujah we'll forget about the future
[29:06] we forget about God's word and all these
[29:07] things and so we need reminders to stir
[29:10] up that Faith Hallelujah get it moving
[29:12] amen that's right because it's an
[29:15] invisible thing it's the spirit of God
[29:18] inside of us it's a substance of things
[29:21] hoped for it's the evidence of Things
[29:23] Not
[29:24] Seen how do you know you're saved well I
[29:26] don't have any proof outside
[29:28] I just got faith inside how do you know
[29:31] you're going in the Rapture I can't
[29:32] produce anything to tell you that I've
[29:34] just got a faith on the inside I believe
[29:36] it's for me
[29:37] Hallelujah it I can't show it to you
[29:39] really now you can get a clue by
[29:41] watching my life you can see the fruits
[29:43] of my life that gives a good that gives
[29:45] a good clue he you know he or she may go
[29:46] in the Rapture praise God but it's
[29:49] nothing that I can't prove it to you
[29:51] it's a substance and you cannot please
[29:53] God until you've got that substance amen
[29:56] and you cannot get that substance until
[29:57] you receive it by a gift of Grace amen
[30:00] be like I'm reaching out pull him up out
[30:01] of the pit amen that's what the word pit
[30:04] mean pull him out of the pit Hallelujah
[30:06] save them amen God save our faith
[30:12] Hallelujah
[30:14] Glory now brother man said now these are
[30:16] real deep lessons here he says and I'll
[30:19] catch the top of it then you dig down in
[30:22] it see so if you want to go deeper in
[30:26] perfect Faith go listen to this sermon
[30:28] and listen to it
[30:29] slowly right I've listen to it while I
[30:31] drove to that funeral a couple weeks ago
[30:33] I listened to it while I was mowed the
[30:34] grass listen to in the drive to work you
[30:37] I've just listened to it over and over
[30:38] again he said these are deep lessons and
[30:41] you'll catch the top of it then dig down
[30:43] in it okay so brother admits I can only
[30:46] hit the
[30:47] highlights and you've got to go down and
[30:49] dig down in these scriptures Hallelujah
[30:51] I love that amen I love what brother R
[30:53] said brother R said any man that says
[30:54] he's got all the answers he said watch
[30:56] that man he's a false prophet
[30:58] he said only Jesus has all the answers
[31:01] right and then I'm talking about the
[31:02] spirit of Jesus the body of Jesus
[31:04] doesn't even know the day or the hour
[31:06] right I'm talking about the spirit of
[31:07] Jesus knows all things Hallelujah
[31:09] because you understand by God's grace
[31:10] the
[31:12] scripture all right
[31:14] now I'm just going to read these because
[31:16] I think they're important I don't want
[31:17] to skip over them here hallelujah now if
[31:20] you could see Jesus it would be no more
[31:23] faith because your faith has now become
[31:26] sight right faith is a substance of
[31:29] things not
[31:31] seen right so these are important points
[31:34] to point
[31:35] out he said see anything that the senses
[31:38] declares it's no more faith it's a
[31:40] scientific fact see it's no more faith
[31:42] but you have to accept him by faith he
[31:45] that cometh to God Must Believe God and
[31:46] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[31:49] Amen what what just what a simple
[31:51] reminder it is for us if we want to
[31:53] receive from God if we want to please
[31:55] God we just got to believe what God says
[31:58] and there even if there's no evidence
[31:59] just believe the word hallelujah just
[32:02] believe the word and then God as brother
[32:04] said God will lead you to believe all
[32:06] the things that he wants for your life
[32:09] hallelujah amen everything that God
[32:11] wants for you he'll lead you to believe
[32:13] it amen you had to lead Abraham and
[32:16] Sarah to believe no it's for Sarah not
[32:18] just Hagar it's for Sarah Hallelujah he
[32:22] led them to believe it
[32:26] Hallelujah it's Honey in the Rock
[32:30] Hallelujah he said you must first
[32:32] believe God's word and you must come to
[32:34] God by the word just take the word what
[32:36] it says say that's right everything else
[32:38] is contrary to it is not right Abraham
[32:41] had to believe just what the voice told
[32:43] him and when he's 100 years old 25 years
[32:45] later he was Stronger believing it than
[32:47] he was 25 years ago when it was given to
[32:49] him he believed it he staggered not the
[32:51] promise of God through unbelief but was
[32:53] strong giving God praise notice brother
[32:55] is quoting the scripture that helps him
[32:56] overcome his depression too remember I
[32:58] read you that quote every time I'm
[33:00] feeling a little blue what do you read
[33:01] brother R Romans chapter
[33:04] 4 Abraham stagger not the promise of God
[33:07] but he was strong in faith giving God
[33:09] praise got any strong Saints in here
[33:11] tonight by God's grace I saw you I saw
[33:13] your praising God we have some strong
[33:14] Saints in here hallelujah you may not
[33:16] feel like it but you give God praise
[33:18] anyway Hallelujah that's strong faith I
[33:22] don't see any effects to it I don't see
[33:23] the mountain moving yet but I believe
[33:25] God's going to move it Hallelujah
[33:29] God is able to perform what he's
[33:32] promised he said but you have to be in a
[33:35] position to have that faith and that's
[33:36] what we're going to talk on see to
[33:38] receive that Faith he says faith is the
[33:41] substance of things hoped for now here's
[33:43] where many people fail to receive their
[33:45] healing and what they're asking for
[33:47] because they take Faith to be something
[33:48] that it's not it's not an imagination
[33:51] it's an actual
[33:54] substance Hallelujah now listen real
[33:57] close it's not what you imagine it's
[33:59] just as real to you as any sense of your
[34:01] body will declare anything else it's
[34:03] just as real as my eyes say this is a
[34:05] piece of
[34:06] paper it's just as real as to say that
[34:09] that is a light brother starts pointing
[34:11] things out in the church it's just that
[34:14] real now see here's where we're going to
[34:16] get down to some maturity right because
[34:19] if we've got faith and faith means a
[34:21] revelation then we've got to be
[34:23] absolutely sure it is what it is amen we
[34:27] got to be absolutely sure we know it's
[34:29] God's word that's why I love those words
[34:32] if the Lord willing because if I don't
[34:33] know I'm going to say if the Lord is
[34:36] willing and that's a that's an okay
[34:38] thing to say that's what the Bible says
[34:39] don't don't just say well I'm going to
[34:40] move there next year and make a certain
[34:41] amount of money in James he said say if
[34:44] the Lord willing I'm going to go do that
[34:47] right you want God to bless you and
[34:49] ultimately what we want is God's
[34:51] will
[34:54] right but we must look to the will of
[34:56] God first
[34:58] brother BR said' it's just as real as I
[34:59] feel my coat or as I hear that baby
[35:02] somebody some baby cries and he says I
[35:04] hear that baby talking back there that's
[35:06] a baby's talk right it's
[35:08] crying it's making its noise see it's
[35:10] just as real as that music Malachi was
[35:12] playing it's just as real is I taste
[35:14] anything in my mouth it's that real only
[35:16] you can't show it to somebody
[35:20] else right it's like say Malachi can't
[35:23] you see my faith can't you see what I
[35:26] believe can't you see that I believe I'm
[35:28] going in the Rapture he can't see
[35:29] it he can't feel it neither can I but
[35:33] alls I know is it's inside of me praise
[35:35] God that's what faith is it's a
[35:38] revelation hallelujah how do you know
[35:41] you're saved I just know it amen I it's
[35:45] inside of me praise God hallelujah it's
[35:48] just that real
[35:50] amen you you have it alone it's yours
[35:54] faith is a substance it's not a myth
[35:57] brother man said these are deep things
[35:58] he says these are deep lessons notice
[36:01] it's something you possess you already
[36:03] have it you really have it it's just as
[36:06] real as you're riding in an automobile
[36:08] it's just as real as you're sitting in
[36:09] the church it's just as real as you hear
[36:11] my voice it's not in Emotion not an
[36:13] imagination it's something you have it
[36:15] comes to you by hearing the word of
[36:18] God now see church now that put it that
[36:20] puts it on us if we're lacking a
[36:23] revelation we've got to hear the word of
[36:25] God with a more sincere heart
[36:28] right and many times that comes by first
[36:31] we got to hear the word of God then
[36:32] we've got to act upon it and we got to
[36:34] obey it because remember the Bible says
[36:36] if we just hear the scriptures if we
[36:38] just hear the sermons of brother Keith
[36:39] but we don't act on what it says then we
[36:41] deceive
[36:42] ourselves so it comes back to that we
[36:45] got to hear the word of God we've got to
[36:47] act on it right and in doing that we'll
[36:50] get a revelation of God's word
[36:55] Glory he said Faith Comes by hearing
[36:58] hearing the word of God that puts it
[36:59] back to where your faith then is it's
[37:02] not some individual it's not in a man
[37:05] it's not in an organization it's not a
[37:07] group of people it's in God because God
[37:10] is the
[37:11] word see you so then it comes down to
[37:14] this if Keith prayed for you on Sunday
[37:15] or if I prayed for you or brother Diggs
[37:17] or anyone uh brother Brooks if anyone's
[37:20] prayed for you your faith is not in them
[37:22] your faith is in the word of God and
[37:25] brother R tell us at the end of the
[37:26] sermon he said all I am is an
[37:28] intercessor I'm holding up your request
[37:30] to God asking God to minister to your
[37:33] needs amen he said but I'm not the one
[37:36] your faith isn't in me your faith is in
[37:39] the one who answers prayer Hallelujah
[37:42] your faith is the one who gave you the
[37:43] gift of faith
[37:44] hallelujah
[37:50] amen now
[37:54] uh let me read this here
[37:57] he said now Faith is a substance and in
[38:00] there we find out in Hebrews 11 what
[38:02] faith was and what those did that had
[38:05] Faith there's many times that people
[38:07] have faith today and tomorrow they
[38:09] haven't got it okay so that's where
[38:11] we've got to watch ourselves right
[38:13] because then is it really a faith or not
[38:15] if we don't have it tomorrow then it
[38:17] wasn't faith it was a hope so right
[38:20] everybody understand
[38:21] that he says and something else but when
[38:24] God once anchors it you see there's
[38:26] nothing ever going to make you move from
[38:29] it you're just poking or reaching or
[38:31] presuming to presume is to venture
[38:34] without Authority you're just trying
[38:35] this and trying that and going this way
[38:37] and that's what I've told you before
[38:38] with Divine Healing when amen asked me
[38:39] that question a few years ago how do you
[38:40] know if it's God or not or how do you
[38:43] know and I said well you know sometimes
[38:45] God will give you the Revelation by uh
[38:47] anointing you with oil because that's
[38:49] what the Bible says anoint them with oil
[38:50] pray for the sick sometimes it's a
[38:52] prayer cloth we got all these prayer
[38:53] cloths up here Jose you know had at
[38:55] least a couple of friends he said we
[38:57] sent cl to and they were healed of their
[38:58] cancer that was a couple years
[39:01] ago sometimes God will use that right
[39:04] other times you just you God will drop
[39:06] it in your heart and I know I'm well I
[39:09] know I'm I'm going to get over I always
[39:11] remember that one time I was sick and it
[39:13] was a Sunday night after I preached
[39:14] twice and I felt like I was going to
[39:16] throw up I just we were still sleeping
[39:18] upstairs that was a while ago I got down
[39:20] on my knees by the bed and I say I grab
[39:22] I I touched my stomach I said Satan I
[39:24] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I
[39:26] said I'm too busy to get sick I got to
[39:28] preach I got to work I got up there I
[39:31] walked around I still felt sick within a
[39:32] couple minutes I was walking around it
[39:33] all left me I felt sick that whole day
[39:37] I'm like no I'm not getting
[39:39] sick that wasn't my faith that was God's
[39:42] Gift Amen in other words God gave me the
[39:44] grace to not get sick amen right and
[39:47] then the one time when I passed out I
[39:48] stayed up all night sister who and I was
[39:50] saying devil get behind me I SHP thrope
[39:52] you know remember Kevin I was with Kevin
[39:54] and John grahon bang I stay up all night
[39:57] at the old church at w I said I'm going
[39:59] to preach anyway I said come here I was
[40:01] hot and sweaty I hot chills all night I
[40:03] said I'm going to believe by faith God's
[40:04] going to heal me pretty soon I passed
[40:06] out they caught me called the ambulance
[40:08] and you saw your pastor getting rolled
[40:10] out to the ambulance so thank God I
[40:12] didn't have to go to the hospital I
[40:14] tried all night by
[40:16] faith at least I can say I tried right I
[40:19] didn't give up you
[40:21] know that really
[40:24] embarrassing but I was just trying to
[40:26] just press through you know you
[40:28] know and I didn't I didn't stop
[40:32] confessing I I I was confessing the
[40:34] whole
[40:36] time pretty soon everything start
[40:37] getting dark dark dark dark dark dark
[40:39] dark go to
[40:42] sleep who turned out the lights brother
[40:44] brother John you turn out the lights
[40:47] here so sometimes you know you have that
[40:50] sometimes God will give you that
[40:52] Revelation other times I try to press
[40:54] through and I was just hoping God would
[40:56] I just believe God would honor my
[40:58] request I want to preach I'm the
[41:00] pastor well it wasn't God's will that
[41:02] time so I learn now try to make sure I I
[41:05] feel led of the
[41:07] Lord hallelujah but you know honestly
[41:10] church I'm not a prophet so it's
[41:12] sometimes it's hard to tell and it may
[41:14] be that way for you for you too I don't
[41:16] know I would imagine you know I imagine
[41:17] we're all not prophets you know if you
[41:20] are let me know by God's grace
[41:25] Hallelujah he said I want you to get
[41:28] this now the church has got to lift
[41:30] itself in the power of God but how we're
[41:33] too close to the end now I believe the
[41:34] church is condition where we can teach
[41:36] it a little deeper things and rub some
[41:38] of this make believe
[41:40] out and get into something real it's got
[41:43] to be something that you
[41:45] know and church let me just say to you I
[41:47] don't believe you know you our church is
[41:50] in a lot of make believe right we're
[41:53] past that we're past the uh the infancy
[41:55] stage of being a Christian
[41:58] right we're past the point of I'm just
[41:59] going to name it and claim it I'm just
[42:01] going to believe it you know we're past
[42:03] that but we can we we definitely can
[42:06] benefit from uh reminders right we
[42:09] definitely can benefit from reminding us
[42:11] what real faith is hallelujah now um AAA
[42:15] let's see maybe I got this to work here
[42:17] let's see I left my other laptop at
[42:21] school so I got the iPad here tonight
[42:24] thankful to have always always want to
[42:25] have a backup device if you ever a
[42:27] preacher make sure you get a backup
[42:29] device one of them is going to fail
[42:31] eventually all right can you uh project
[42:34] this H so I use these at brother cams
[42:36] you've heard me use these before
[42:37] hopefully it works if not then I
[42:38] apologize
[42:40] okay now um I'm going to read all these
[42:42] quotes but let's keep all these things
[42:44] in mind I think uh Matthew 13:58 is one
[42:48] of our uh just concerns as a Christian
[42:51] in Matthew 13:58 the Bible said Jesus
[42:54] could not do many mighty works because
[42:55] of their unbelief
[42:58] now nobody here wants to fail God right
[43:02] and say like well I didn't have faith
[43:03] for
[43:04] that who wants to fail God don't raise
[43:06] your hand I else
[43:08] go right but but but that that that's
[43:10] what you and I battle right that's what
[43:11] I know I battle as a pastor I don't want
[43:14] to fail God in other words brother
[43:15] Austin I want to be in the right
[43:16] condition when God wants to move I don't
[43:18] want to fail God I don't want to be the
[43:21] aen right I don't want to my sin to Har
[43:23] harm harm somebody else's request
[43:29] right and so we have to put all these
[43:32] scriptures together we don't want to I
[43:33] don't want to be the one that fails God
[43:35] because I didn't believe enough right I
[43:37] don't want people to think well I don't
[43:39] want to think well it's my fault this
[43:41] person didn't get healed that that
[43:42] that's awful thing to live under I don't
[43:44] want to live under
[43:46] guilt now is it possible sometimes I
[43:49] didn't have enough faith and it was my
[43:50] fault certainly
[43:51] certainly but the Bible said there's no
[43:53] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[43:55] Jesus
[43:57] so I so we confess our sin or if we had
[43:59] any unbelief forgive me Lord now try me
[44:02] again Hallelujah let me R ready the next
[44:04] time praise God let me be
[44:07] consecrated remember Jesus could not do
[44:09] many mighty works because of their
[44:11] unbelief and remember and here here's
[44:13] what it is here's here's where I think
[44:15] we can recognize Church uh Luke 5:17
[44:18] said the power was present to heal
[44:23] them so in order for something to be
[44:25] healed there's got to be power there
[44:26] first
[44:27] first in other words we we will
[44:30] recognize the
[44:31] anointing like wow something different's
[44:34] here
[44:35] today right and sometimes you catch at
[44:37] the beginning of service sometimes you
[44:39] catch in the middle of service sometimes
[44:42] like on Sunday I didn't catch it to the
[44:43] end of the service I'm like what is God
[44:44] doing here Lord what am I doing you know
[44:46] sometimes I wonder what am I preaching
[44:47] what what in the world am I doing here
[44:48] today am I help am I helping anybody you
[44:52] know but then you catch it by the end
[44:55] like and then I'm weeping we're all
[44:56] weeping crying we're rejoicing we're
[44:57] singing to God praising God and we're
[44:59] all you know it just we just got to wait
[45:01] on the holy
[45:03] spirit so as Believers we don't want to
[45:06] we never want to fail we never want to
[45:08] have unbelief so we got to recognize we
[45:10] got to recognize we're children of God
[45:13] God has a purpose all things in our
[45:14] lives work together for good because
[45:16] we're the called of God and we got to
[45:19] recognize that God will raise our faith
[45:21] and God will help us to recognize the
[45:23] moments when the power of God is present
[45:26] and he wants to one of us praise God
[45:29] everybody understand what I'm
[45:32] saying so this means you know when when
[45:34] the when the power was there as I wrote
[45:36] there God was trying to get the
[45:38] Revelation for healing you know with
[45:40] these different cities that turn him
[45:42] down but they wouldn't get under the
[45:44] anointing so see Church what's our
[45:46] responsibility get under the anointing
[45:48] of the Holy Spirit and church I'm not I
[45:51] don't think any of us like brother man
[45:53] said none of us sit around like wall
[45:54] flowers no I'm not going to worship
[45:56] today
[45:58] pretty good balance there by God's
[46:00] grace oh no I'm not going to stand up
[46:02] I'm not going to I'm not going to clap
[46:04] I'm not going to sing I'm not going to
[46:05] raise my hands we don't sit around like
[46:07] wall
[46:09] flowers but also we know are we giv all
[46:13] of our worship or not are we real are
[46:16] are we distraction free
[46:19] tonight and I know it's hard that's part
[46:21] of the battle right once we get all back
[46:23] past the distraction then the power of
[46:25] God can come amen
[46:28] hallelujah then the power of God can
[46:30] come Hallelujah we can get past the
[46:32] distraction and we can get in the Holy
[46:37] Spirit Hallelujah so the Bible says do
[46:40] all gifts of healing no so if there if
[46:42] there's no gifts of healing or there's
[46:44] fewer Gifts of healing well then uh it
[46:46] all depends that that that determines
[46:48] how often the spirit of God can come to
[46:52] heal right like uh uh like we see you
[46:55] know other churches may have more
[46:56] Miracles well maybe they have the more
[46:58] gifts of
[46:59] Miracles other churches may have more
[47:01] tongues or interpretation well they got
[47:03] the gifts to they got the gifts of it so
[47:06] as I've said many times before it's our
[47:07] responsibility to find out what gifts we
[47:09] got Hallelujah and then if we can get
[47:11] under the anointing if we can all get in
[47:13] one Accord and one place is that
[47:15] something they only needed two things
[47:17] one Accord and one place amen that's the
[47:20] only thing they needed for the Holy
[47:21] Ghost to fall Hallelujah and church we
[47:23] got one place amen hallelujah let's get
[47:25] in one Accord amen
[47:30] am I don't remember the exact quote
[47:32] brother ra said if we could just all get
[47:34] in the same mind and want for the Holy
[47:36] Spirit to move I can't remember the
[47:37] exact quote he said then God could do
[47:38] anything tonight how many believe that
[47:41] by God's grace it's it's a reality it's
[47:43] a reality God could do anything if we
[47:45] just get in one
[47:47] Accord Hallelujah that's what faith is
[47:49] all about
[47:50] Hallelujah faith is Assurance right
[47:52] faith is getting a revelation we all get
[47:54] one Accord we get our thoughts all on
[47:56] Jesus right we get and then his power
[47:59] comes to give us
[48:01] something whether it's healing or
[48:03] knowledge or understanding or
[48:04] discernment Hallelujah that's what a
[48:07] spirit does now this is why I shared
[48:10] with brother cams I was talking about
[48:11] you know the the goat movement of the
[48:13] message preachers I said I appreciate
[48:15] the results they get but and I
[48:17] appreciate their gifts but they also
[48:19] have failures you know stating God's
[48:20] going to heal and then God doesn't do it
[48:22] okay so they they they leave out the
[48:24] main thing is finding the will of God
[48:26] and that's what this perfect faith is
[48:28] tied
[48:29] into it's got to be the will of God Amen
[48:32] I've labored on that but I'm going to
[48:33] keep laboring on that Hallelujah now
[48:35] Faith is a revelation from God now Faith
[48:37] is a revelation that's where I want to
[48:38] stay there just a moment it's a
[48:39] revelation he's revealed it to you by
[48:42] his what Grace Grace Grace that sound
[48:45] famili anybody tonight it's nothing you
[48:49] did for zerubabel to finish that that
[48:53] that Temple it wasn't anything he did
[48:56] Glory amen hallelujah so when God does
[48:59] your miracle that you've been praying
[49:00] for when God heals a person or God does
[49:03] something when God does that it wasn't
[49:05] going to be you it's going to be
[49:06] Christ you're just there when it happens
[49:11] Hallelujah that's how it was with every
[49:13] person in the
[49:14] Bible and the situations with Jesus are
[49:17] all unique because they're actually
[49:18] getting thus sayth the Lord as they talk
[49:20] to Jesus they could get it and hear it
[49:23] we don't always get that right church we
[49:26] don't get to walk with with Jesus and
[49:27] say could you heal my uh my servant at
[49:30] home like the Roman Centon could you
[49:32] could you he said yeah I I I'll I'll go
[49:35] to your house no you don't even have to
[49:36] go just speak the
[49:38] word or like the leper I read that a
[49:40] couple times this week Lord if thou will
[49:42] make me whole if it's your will it's a
[49:45] it's a perfect question if you will make
[49:48] make me whole he says I will be Thou
[49:51] made clean be Thou made whole right
[49:54] asking the will of God well it's
[49:55] different we have done say the Lord
[49:57] there well now if brother manam said
[49:59] Jesus Christ is the same in every detail
[50:01] today except the Corporal
[50:04] body whoa now that takes it up to a
[50:07] different level
[50:08] Hallelujah that means we'll be able to
[50:10] hear from Jesus but just not ably it's
[50:13] got to be spoken on the
[50:16] inside and this is where how many want
[50:17] to grow in this area
[50:19] Hallelujah feeling the will of God
[50:21] feeling the leadership of the Holy
[50:23] Spirit why I feel led to do this that's
[50:25] what I want by God's grace
[50:27] I feel to do this I feel to do that I
[50:30] feel God leading me to do something
[50:33] praise God I can't just sit here I got
[50:35] to do something
[50:37] Hallelujah he gave it to you by Grace
[50:40] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[50:41] yourself up into Faith you ever have
[50:43] faith it give to you by the grace of God
[50:45] think I always think of Gideon God's
[50:47] like you're a mighty man of Valor like
[50:50] give me some
[50:51] signs prove it to me right that's what
[50:55] sign after sign after sign sign one more
[50:58] sign okay one more give me more you need
[51:00] it too if you're going against an
[51:01] innumerable Army right I would need it
[51:04] too but see it's it's not something
[51:06] Gideon did Gideon didn't work himself
[51:08] into it God helped him believe amen God
[51:12] strengthened his faith and that's what
[51:13] God's doing here tonight God's trying to
[51:15] strengthen our faith
[51:16] hallelujah
[51:19] amen and God re reveals it to you
[51:22] therefore faith is a revelation the
[51:24] whole church is built on Revelation
[51:30] in the in an audience of people where a
[51:31] prayer line comes through you'll find
[51:33] they were all good people will say
[51:34] there's some that trying hard to believe
[51:36] it trying to work themselves into it
[51:37] some just can't do it at all and others
[51:39] it's just by Grace it's just given to
[51:41] them now there's a difference see that
[51:42] does it that's the real Revelation
[51:44] because faith is a revelation from God
[51:47] it must be revealed first Hallelujah
[51:52] Jesus clearly expressed that when he
[51:53] said no man can come to me except my
[51:55] father draws me first that's interesting
[51:57] brother Ties That in that's about
[51:59] salvation God drawing you to Salvation
[52:01] he applies that though to
[52:03] Healing God's going to draw you in come
[52:06] on in here son son or daughter come on
[52:08] in here daughter I'm going to give you
[52:09] your healing now let's apply it like
[52:12] brother R did this is your time to be
[52:14] healed come forward Hallelujah and the
[52:17] church said I'm draw I'm going to lead
[52:19] you into this healing just like with
[52:20] Abraham I'm gonna lead you into having
[52:22] Isaac I'm gonna lead you into this

[53:01] in that you act
[53:04] accordingly I forgot to set the timer
[53:06] but I know I started about 8 7:15 here

[53:10] minutes but until you got that
[53:13] Revelation Church every preacher in the
[53:15] world could pray for you brother Keith
[53:17] brother Brooks brother Jesse brother cam
[53:20] brother Simon every preacher can pray

[53:24] help you it would encourage you
[53:27] how many encouraged when you go for
[53:28] prayer I am I'm always
[53:30] encouraged but until that Fai see the
[53:32] healing power is in you but it don't
[53:34] come from the preacher it comes You by
[53:36] Revelation not by my there it is good
[53:39] wow what a Vindication I forgot about
[53:41] that not by mind not by power but by my
[53:43] spirit sayith the Lord my spirit by
[53:45] Grace reveals this to you and there's
[53:47] nothing can take it away by Faith by
[53:50] Revelation then brother R says when you
[53:52] know want to know what God wants you to
[53:54] do get in the spirit of God first amen
[53:56] so never forget
[53:58] Elisha remember ahab's son and uh
[54:02] Jehoshaphat said we need we need a
[54:04] prophecy he said bring me a
[54:06] Minstrel bring me a Malachi bring me an
[54:09] amen bring me a Lydia amen
[54:12] hallelujah bring me somebody that can
[54:14] worship God and I'll get under the
[54:16] anointing and then we'll see what God
[54:18] says hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[54:21] Amen is that beautiful
[54:29] so he says get in the spirit he said and
[54:32] then it's all over he said we need to
[54:34] get in the spirit and then things will
[54:36] be done so that's why we got that's why
[54:38] we come here we pray we worship we sing
[54:40] We we try to yield ourselves to God lord
[54:43] I want to be in your spirit so then
[54:45] things can get
[54:47] done hallelujah I want God to do things
[54:49] in our church don't you amen
[54:52] amen we got to get in the spirit of it
[54:55] first
[54:58] and now as you know I pushed back
[54:59] brother uh Dennis a few weeks there by
[55:00] God's grace we had a lot of guest
[55:01] preachers and I need you need a little
[55:04] break we need a few extra weeks there by
[55:06] God's grace had a lot of preachers in so
[55:09] I asked him you know brother could you
[55:10] come come in a few more weeks so that
[55:11] worked out thank god it worked out by
[55:12] God's grace um it it all it's all good
[55:16] by God's grace I sure enjoyed all the
[55:17] sermons that I've heard Hallelujah I've
[55:18] been blessed but we just need to take a
[55:21] little few more weeks but that'll give
[55:22] us some time to build up some Faith
[55:23] praise God some not just some faith some
[55:26] perfect
[55:28] faith in other words look to God for
[55:30] Revelation right and then when God's man
[55:33] comes in trust God to speak to us
[55:35] hallelujah he sure did it last
[55:37] time he said don't go through the acts
[55:40] first get in the spirit and then go
[55:42] through the acts and watch what God will
[55:45] do
[55:47] Hallelujah so his example was with
[55:49] Divine Healing don't try to go figure
[55:51] out your healing he first and then get
[55:53] in the spirit get in the spirit first
[55:56] then then see what God does in other
[55:58] words start worshiping God start
[56:00] praising God loving God falling in love
[56:02] with God asking God for his will that's
[56:04] it right there amen get in the spirit of
[56:06] God ask for God's Will and then see what
[56:08] happens praise
[56:10] God all right I think that's it yep I
[56:13] preach on something else all right you
[56:15] can uh can go back to the scriptures I'm
[56:17] almost
[56:19] done
[56:21] hallelujah so church I I I went over
[56:23] that again to show you the foundation
[56:25] it's got to be God's will first but see
[56:28] God will gently guide you into his
[56:30] presence like we sing that song you
[56:32] gently call me into your presence
[56:34] guiding me by your Holy Spirit right
[56:35] same thing with Abraham and Sarah that's
[56:37] a great example they God just drew them
[56:39] into these promises that he's going to
[56:41] do in their lives now Church can't we
[56:44] trust God to draw us into his will for
[56:47] our lives can we trust God for
[56:50] that brother said one of the worst
[56:52] things when a Christian does he he or
[56:53] she tries to be like somebody else
[56:56] brother said don't never try to be like
[56:58] somebody else just be who God made you
[56:59] to be so what does that take it takes
[57:02] you loving
[57:04] Jesus it takes you submitting to God uh
[57:08] remember make yourself a Living
[57:09] Sacrifice pres just present yourself
[57:11] before God God here I am Use Me For Your
[57:14] Glory I've always just tried to do that
[57:16] right I've just you you've always tried
[57:18] to do that too just keep doing what
[57:20] God's called you to do just be yourself
[57:22] Hallelujah now don't get me wrong you
[57:24] can learn from other people too but I
[57:26] tell you this I'm going to tell this cuz
[57:27] my wife knows it's true there's a
[57:28] certain person that tried to impersonate
[57:31] another uh person like with prophecy and
[57:34] so forth at another church and it caused
[57:36] a lot of pain I think because the woman
[57:39] gave a false prophecy and then tried to
[57:40] cover it up and say it wasn't and it
[57:43] didn't turn out right and it caused a
[57:44] lot of pain maybe I'll tell you more
[57:46] about it on a Sunday night service but
[57:47] we got to wait a couple weeks by God's
[57:50] grace plus y'all would to have a
[57:53] questions and answers right after this
[57:54] sermon here God oh no brother I just I
[57:56] got to go to work yeah me too Hallelujah
[57:58] I I remember that that's
[58:01] right I'd like to tell you those
[58:03] personal things because then you'll
[58:05] learn from it that's how brother BR was
[58:07] that's how Jesus was the Bible say Jesus
[58:08] would tell these Parables I went through
[58:10] it and then when they're all alone
[58:11] they'd ask him Jesus tell us a little
[58:13] more about that Parable so we can
[58:15] understand it
[58:16] Lord right we have this personal
[58:19] relationship right we're we're a
[58:20] close-knit body of Believers that's what
[58:22] we are by God's
[58:23] grace brother R said I told brother said
[58:26] I I told you everything the Lord would
[58:27] allow me to tell you that's what brother
[58:28] Ram
[58:29] said and he gets criticized for telling
[58:31] all these things but the Holy Spirit
[58:33] told him to tell the people and I'm glad
[58:34] he did I love hearing brother R stories
[58:37] I I love it I love to see how he he uh
[58:39] he would go through his battles and
[58:40] trials how he'd uh get through his Moody
[58:43] spells how he'd overcome
[58:46] overwork you ever get
[58:48] overworked amen I love how how'd you get
[58:51] through that brother raham I took the
[58:52] word of God I stuck it in the devil's
[58:54] face Hallelujah

[59:01] back
[59:04] there so church this these quotes and
[59:07] these scriptures about finding the will
[59:09] of God first it gives you the foundation

[59:14] spoken word the third pole and even
[59:17] rapturing
[59:18] Faith
[59:21] Allelujah and God is going to give you
[59:24] all these things by his grace
[59:27] am by his
[59:30] election which means
[59:33] choosing God chose you before the
[59:36] foundation of the world remember brother
[59:39] Brooks preached on that God chose you
[59:41] Hallelujah by pre by forn knowledge
[59:44] right God chose you God made you a
[59:47] certain type of a
[59:50] vessel
[59:54] Glory you're a believer so you're a
[59:57] vessel of honor God wants to use you to
[59:59] honor His holy
[1:00:01] name God God you you God didn't create
[1:00:04] you to be a dishonor to him like these
[1:00:06] Sinners that we see going headlong into
[1:00:08] the into the grave into the pit right
[1:00:12] blasphemy in God blaspheming the message
[1:00:13] all these
[1:00:15] things if they don't repent they're
[1:00:17] going down to the pit God didn't use you
[1:00:19] for dishonor God used you for Honor
[1:00:22] Hallelujah God wants to use your
[1:00:24] testimony this is going to be honor to
[1:00:25] my name because they believe my word
[1:00:28] they keep my word they've got an
[1:00:29] invisible substance called Faith
[1:00:31] Hallelujah I've given it to them it's
[1:00:33] theirs and they're living by faith
[1:00:35] Hallelujah we have to sing that living
[1:00:37] by faith Hallelujah as we closed by
[1:00:39] God's
[1:00:45] grace let me see which one I should
[1:00:46] close on here I got a lot I still got a
[1:00:48] lot left here
[1:00:57] ah help me Jesus help me
[1:01:01] Lord I
[1:01:04] think I think I'll end with this
[1:01:10] here let me end with the uh some of the
[1:01:12] examples brother R uses for perfect
[1:01:14] Faith but now in with with our
[1:01:16] understanding of brother R's final
[1:01:18] Divine Healing service works as Faith
[1:01:21] expressed right uh November 1965 we got
[1:01:24] to look at perfect faith through those
[1:01:26] lenses in other words all these examples
[1:01:29] CH listen he gives all these
[1:01:31] examples the first example he uses is
[1:01:35] where did I write
[1:01:39] down is the woman with the blood issue
[1:01:41] that's the first example he uses he said
[1:01:43] that woman had perfect
[1:01:45] Faith what did she say she said the
[1:01:48] Bible said she said in her heart if I
[1:01:49] can just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:01:51] I'll be made
[1:01:53] whole how did how did she know
[1:01:56] it was revealed to
[1:01:58] her that gave her the muscles think
[1:02:00] about that a little woman gave her the
[1:02:02] muscles to push through all those
[1:02:03] Brothers let me I got to touch him you
[1:02:06] know think of they big Burly men like
[1:02:09] Malachi and Austin and all they she just
[1:02:11] pushed through nothing's going to stop
[1:02:13] her because it was revealed to her and
[1:02:16] even Jesus didn't know it God had not
[1:02:18] reveal it to him he said who touched me
[1:02:19] he wasn't
[1:02:21] lying it wasn't revealed to Jesus it was
[1:02:23] revealed to her he said daughter great
[1:02:25] is your Faith your faith has made you
[1:02:27] whole great is the Revelation the gift
[1:02:29] of God that God revealed to you
[1:02:31] Hallelujah she didn't work herself up
[1:02:32] into it it was God's Gift Hallelujah God
[1:02:36] revealed it to her the next example was
[1:02:38] uh Jesus healing the epileptic child the
[1:02:42] the disciples prayed over it and he the
[1:02:45] child didn't get well and and and the
[1:02:47] parents came to Jesus and said your
[1:02:49] disciples couldn't cast out the devil
[1:02:50] and Jesus said oh ye of little faith and
[1:02:53] they and then Jesus rebukes the devil
[1:02:55] the child cl's well they say Jesus why
[1:02:57] couldn't we do it this kind only goes
[1:02:59] out by prayer and fasting oh so now we
[1:03:01] get a deeper Revelation
[1:03:03] here if we want if we want God to move
[1:03:06] through us we got to be consecrated at
[1:03:08] certain
[1:03:09] times in other words if we want a
[1:03:11] revelation from God if we want to see
[1:03:13] God do his will we got to be in the
[1:03:14] channel for it we got to be praying
[1:03:15] about it got to be giving up some meals
[1:03:18] about it these are the first two
[1:03:19] examples I want to get through this list
[1:03:21] here then I'll
[1:03:22] close you all love the word of God don't
[1:03:24] you Hallelujah
[1:03:28] next one is Joshua spoke to the son
[1:03:29] brother BR say didn't have to pray about
[1:03:32] it right he said just stand there I have
[1:03:35] a need I'm in the service of the Lord he
[1:03:37] sent me over here to do this job and I'm
[1:03:38] doing the best that I know how and the
[1:03:40] enemy's routed and they're out there if
[1:03:42] I let the sun go down they'll get
[1:03:43] together and cause me more trouble so
[1:03:45] son stand still he said Moon you hang
[1:03:49] there brother man said that was perfect
[1:03:51] Faith he just called for it but see that
[1:03:55] wasn't Joshua
[1:03:56] that was Christ in Joshua Hallelujah it
[1:03:59] was revealed to him that he could do
[1:04:01] it
[1:04:03] Hallelujah just like what brother Ram
[1:04:05] said you about all these individuals
[1:04:06] they all had to have it revealed to them
[1:04:08] brother Ram said God revealed to David I
[1:04:10] think it's in here too that David could
[1:04:13] would defeat Goliath that's why he could
[1:04:15] say those things that's why he could say
[1:04:17] I'm going to cut your head off today and
[1:04:20] uh overcome you I'm going to defeat you
[1:04:23] right because God showed him what was
[1:04:25] going to happen
[1:04:26] happen that makes it a lot easier if I
[1:04:28] know what's going to happen doesn't it
[1:04:29] brothers sisters it makes a lot easier
[1:04:32] to speak the word of God if I know what
[1:04:33] God wants me to
[1:04:36] say the next one he goes through is
[1:04:38] jesus' Miracles all of jesus' Miracles
[1:04:40] he said he said uh if I don't do the
[1:04:43] works don't believe me he said and I
[1:04:45] only do what the father shows me amen so
[1:04:48] brother R labors on Jesus more than all
[1:04:50] the other examples he had perfect Faith
[1:04:52] CU he knew what he was and he also heard
[1:04:54] what the father said
[1:04:56] Hallelujah and that's how we'll have
[1:04:58] perfect faith is when we know what the
[1:05:00] father's telling us to do and now as I
[1:05:03] honestly told you before even Jose has
[1:05:04] been healed numerous times these last
[1:05:06] this year last year and each time it's
[1:05:08] coming up in the prayer line normally
[1:05:10] well I don't always I don't have the
[1:05:12] Revelation I just ask him you know and
[1:05:13] you've heard me say too have you confess
[1:05:15] your sins and then we can take charge
[1:05:17] then we feel like we have authority but
[1:05:19] it's always if it's your will
[1:05:21] Lord right unless unless maybe I maybe I
[1:05:24] forget to say it and maybe then God is
[1:05:26] speaking that God is God's completely
[1:05:28] yielded me over or I've completely
[1:05:30] yielded over the Holy Spirit and God can
[1:05:32] speak something through my
[1:05:33] mouth praise God or whoever prayed it
[1:05:35] doesn't have to be me it could be
[1:05:40] anybody and that's what I found in my
[1:05:42] life you know most times we don't even
[1:05:43] we don't even know what we're doing
[1:05:45] we're just yielding to the Holy Spirit
[1:05:47] and God would do a supernatural work in
[1:05:49] our lives we wouldn't even call it
[1:05:50] perfect faith we just would feel like I
[1:05:52] I just believe God's going to do this I
[1:05:55] just know it's going to going to be all
[1:05:57] right I just know alls well Hallelujah
[1:05:59] God's going to be on our side Hallelujah
[1:06:02] that's perfect Faith although you don't
[1:06:03] say thus sayith the Lord somehow God's
[1:06:05] given you this unction this leadership
[1:06:07] of the Holy Spirit and you just speak
[1:06:09] God's word and it's perfect faith in
[1:06:10] your
[1:06:12] heart the next brother B said Elijah old
[1:06:15] Elijah out there on Mount Carmel he
[1:06:17] walked up and down before that I don't
[1:06:19] say won't you call a little louder maybe
[1:06:21] he's
[1:06:22] pursuing he know what was he was going
[1:06:24] to do because God had told him what he
[1:06:26] was going to happen he said let the god
[1:06:28] that answers by be or by fire be
[1:06:32] God he said then he even poured water on
[1:06:35] the altars they cut themselves they done
[1:06:36] everything oh ba o bail answer Elijah
[1:06:39] was just as calm as he could be so
[1:06:41] brother man says with perfect Faith
[1:06:43] you're just as calm as you can be he
[1:06:45] said uh maybe call a little louder maybe
[1:06:48] he's out pursuing maybe he's on a
[1:06:50] fishing trip keep calling to your God
[1:06:52] maybe he's doing something else you see
[1:06:54] just made fun of them because he knew
[1:06:56] what was going to happen hallelujah amen
[1:07:00] church that's why all these examples one
[1:07:03] after another all the way down through
[1:07:05] the Bible that's how they all had
[1:07:07] perfect Faith because God was leading
[1:07:09] them and God had showed them what was
[1:07:11] going to happen now in our case if we're
[1:07:14] not
[1:07:15] prophets we have to Simply follow the
[1:07:17] leadership of the Holy Spirit make sure
[1:07:19] what church all of our sin is
[1:07:22] confessed Hallelujah make sure
[1:07:24] everything's under the blood blood right
[1:07:26] then nothing will hinder the prayer if
[1:07:28] you're praying for somebody else ask
[1:07:30] them make sure all their sins are
[1:07:32] confessed Hallelujah and then see many
[1:07:35] times for me it's see what God will pray
[1:07:37] through me what will God bring to my
[1:07:39] mind as I'm praying for them I just try
[1:07:41] to pray what the holy spirit will bring
[1:07:43] to my mind praise
[1:07:46] God hallelujah I think I'll stop right
[1:07:48] there by God's
[1:07:50] grace there's so many other things to
[1:07:52] say uh but I think I'll preach a part
[1:07:53] twoo if that's okay
[1:07:57] so perfect Faith then is a perfect
[1:08:00] Revelation right God has made his will
[1:08:03] known to you and so you can speak to
[1:08:05] that mountain but we know most time it's
[1:08:07] not a physical thing it's a spiritual
[1:08:10] thing that we got to speak to now let's
[1:08:13] stand our feet musicians can come and
[1:08:15] think about the mountains in our lives
[1:08:21] here
[1:08:23] hallelujah you know as I was preparing I
[1:08:26] was thinking of if you haven't watched
[1:08:27] Simon's testimony in a while that I made
[1:08:29] a few years ago you might want to make
[1:08:30] it Simon's had this speaking to the
[1:08:33] mountain thing move numerous
[1:08:38] times so if you don't get if you haven't
[1:08:40] listened that I would encourage you to
[1:08:41] listen to
[1:08:42] that Simon uh numerous times has been
[1:08:45] led by the Holy Spirit and I've and uh
[1:08:48] one one time I was a part of it other
[1:08:50] time was with my brother with my brother
[1:08:53] uh my brother's uh youngest child was
[1:08:55] born with a heart defect and Simon felt
[1:08:58] led the Holy Spirit to go over there and
[1:08:59] Simon told him all these testimonies and
[1:09:01] you have to watch nobody can say like
[1:09:05] Simon and Simon just gave one he said by
[1:09:08] his stripes we're healed Simon just went
[1:09:09] through one verse another this is what
[1:09:11] makes Simon such a good Christian to me
[1:09:13] you know just just a humble Christian
[1:09:14] I'll say like that just I admire him
[1:09:17] he'll go over there and you know he's
[1:09:19] he's you know physically smaller than
[1:09:21] others but he's raising their faith
[1:09:25] he's building them up through the word
[1:09:28] of
[1:09:29] God and Simon told so many testimonies
[1:09:31] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:33] Well yeah they're goingon to have to
[1:09:34] have surgery on the
[1:09:35] baby and watch that watch that testimony
[1:09:38] if I got it wrong forgive me I always
[1:09:39] exaggerate I always say something wrong
[1:09:42] because I'm not perfect but you
[1:09:44] understand the point I'm trying to make
[1:09:45] by the end of it Simon had so built up
[1:09:47] my brother's faith my brother stood up
[1:09:49] and he said that boy is
[1:09:51] healed glory amen hallelujah
[1:09:55] and they took the baby there and didn't
[1:09:57] have to have they said we don't know
[1:09:58] what happened but his heart doesn't have
[1:10:00] the hole anymore praise God their scans
[1:10:02] showed a hole in the heart Simon built
[1:10:05] up his faith and then the my brother
[1:10:07] just said he's
[1:10:09] healed he spoke to the mountain of a
[1:10:12] hole in the heart and the mountain had
[1:10:14] to move hallelujah amen
[1:10:17] Glory Hallelujah I know because I heard
[1:10:20] about it from my own Brothers
[1:10:22] amen hallelujah
[1:10:26] another time impacted me my one of my
[1:10:29] best high school friends his dad I
[1:10:30] remember he had a stroke I remember he
[1:10:31] told you this
[1:10:33] story and he called me up he was my
[1:10:35] friend was crying he's like can you pray
[1:10:37] for I said yes I'll pray and all for
[1:10:40] some reason brother all was I can think
[1:10:41] it was Simon
[1:10:43] Hallelujah I called Simon I said bro
[1:10:45] Simon can you go pray for him he said I
[1:10:47] just work 12 hours I do he said I'll try
[1:10:50] to go pray for him I hung up the
[1:10:53] phone uh
[1:10:55] before Simon went to bed he went in his
[1:10:57] prayer closet I believe and he said Lord
[1:11:00] if that man his name is Tom if Tom is
[1:11:03] still alive in the morning then I'll
[1:11:04] know that's your sign for me to go pray
[1:11:07] for him well goes to bed wakes up he's
[1:11:09] still
[1:11:10] alive Simon worked all day that ain't no
[1:11:14] easy work either this guy works like a
[1:11:17] dog or a ax let me say
[1:11:21] ax ax is way better
[1:11:25] and Simon said the whole time he's
[1:11:27] walking the spe he said he he walked
[1:11:28] through the uh as he's going to the
[1:11:30] hospital where my best friend or my
[1:11:31] former best friend and his brother and
[1:11:33] family was at in the waiting room he
[1:11:35] said he was looking for
[1:11:37] signs and he said each sign he saw on
[1:11:39] the wall was like a healing sign or
[1:11:41] something like that and and as he's
[1:11:43] going along he's seeing all these signs
[1:11:46] building up his faith now remember my
[1:11:48] friend's dad had an 1% chance to live
[1:11:52] just to live on a
[1:11:54] ventilator my friend told me on the
[1:11:55] phone he's got a 9 90 99% chance if he
[1:11:59] to live and if he lives he's going to be
[1:12:01] on the ventilator they said he's going
