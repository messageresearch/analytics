dear mother Granite Lord Jesus bless our songs special the tithes and offerings Lord and our little announcements Lord God we're grateful to be in the house of Lord in 2018 we give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name sure said God bless you you may be seated there by God's grace this song the lyrics are a little bit unusual but what it's about is that how God uses our trials and tests to mold our character into the character that he wants [Music] from the fields of thunder comes a lovely drop from the refiners fire a soul that's tried and true and from a heart that's broken on the mighty Rock [Music] great deserts of experience were righteous man place upon the fire where character is forged the gift of God salvation is shaped by victory and the furnace of temptation Christ warms his bride from the refiners fire a small that's tried-and-true oh great over infinite in wisdom and in strength we place our lives before you as [Music] material to build the house [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen just have a few announcements here by the grace of the Lord banks not here yet but I was gonna do the officer Appreciation this morning so maybe if I still a little bit he'll walk in here in just a moment so I just want to have a few announcements here by God's grace the first one is brother Adam was voted in as a deacon so I asked him to sit back there by the back door and just remember you know he's here to help he's gonna do it with grace and and everything like that I've asked him specifically to just be mindful to try to open the doors for mothers who are trying to get their children out that are crying and then also like you know some my children and just children sometimes they they get away from their parents and in the past some I've had to catch some of my own children may be talking out in the bathroom or spending too much time talking by the water fountains so these are little small little concerns you know our church is very well behaved but just as a deacon that's one thing up to watch just to keep everybody focused and focused on the worship and he is God's bodyguard for the preaching of the gospel a deacon is a policeman to protect the pulpit so I want him to look at every person that walks in that door I want him you know if he hears the door open and wondering who it is I want him to walk out there and see who's out there because we know there's a lot of church shootings and things like that we don't live in fear but brother Branham said that Pastor that got that Baptist pastor the God shot he said that wouldn't happen if there was deacons at the door protecting the preaching of the word he protects the atmosphere of the holy spirit brother Branham said any person that would get upset with a Gauley Deacon trying to correct person he said they have the wrong spirit or the RAM said the most strict office in the house of God is a deacon so I was the only deacon here for last six months but it's nice to have help here but Adam will be a great help to me and I when I'm sitting there on Wednesday night Sunday morning Sunday night whenever we have service as you notice we have a couple of Saturday night services coming up in February brother Joe Adams will be preaching on a Saturday night because he has to fly out Sunday afternoon and then also have to look on my schedule there I can't remember who else Oh Troy Troy sueda suede II from Iowa he'll be preaching on a Saturday night in April if I'm not mistaken April so got a lot of guest ministers lined up recently so I hope you're excited about that I certainly am by the grace of the Lord so let's just let's - thank the Lord for brother Adams service to the Lord thank you about Adam just a reminder you know on be you know just watch where you're sitting you know we want to let the women and children sit in the last three rows but like I said if some families are out then yeah you can sit wherever you want we don't have to worry about that on Sunday morning by God's grace also the second noun sment if you have food for sister Naomi like I'm sorry an already announced set let me know you can give it to me or I can text you her address and I'm sure she'd really appreciate some help there by the grace of the Lord that's nice she has Beatrice with her though thank God for that I was gonna thank brother van for his service in 2017 out the wait till he gets here the last announcement everybody has manila envelope out there on the counter or the prayer request table inside you have a copy of your final Giving statement from our records as treasurer and then I put a copy of the email I sent out last night so I have I'm just lookin always looking for feedback so if anyone has any suggestions for bang myself or brother Adam please come to us let us know also if you have any questions about anything that's been preached please come let me know about that as well and then if you desire meeting with me I'm happy to meet with anybody by God's grace and the last thing was just an invitation to prayer I'm gonna talk about it more on the sermon here but as we've seen God move in Iowa North Carolina I really believe God is calling us to more dedicated lives I really I really believe that I don't believe that well that's just the pastor's opinion I believe that's thus saith the Lord I believe the Holy Spirit has given me such a witness that what we're preaching here is the right gospel and we need to be more dedicated that's kinda what this morning's message to beyond his discipline we must be more disciplined to God so I believe that's it I was sure hope and bang would walk in there I know he teaches Sunday School but I was hoping to honor and thank him for his labor of love okay well let's just sing a couple more songs here you love the Lord this morning amen certainly love the Lord thank God for all he's done for us let's sing humble thyself on the side of the Lord amen let's sing that by God's grace humbled humble thyself in the side higher and higher and me well if you I'm a vessel I self in the side of the Lord humble thyself in the side of higher and me will live more time humble thyself in the side of the Lord humble thyself in the side of the Lord and He will lift you up higher and higher and he will you up into heaven I'm in heaven and he will if you sing again he will lift you up higher and higher and he will lift you up in the rapture I'm in the rapture and he will lift us you gotta get humble thyself in the side of the side will lift amen let's thank the Lord praise God let's sing will work till Jesus comes praise God I know it's in the book here I know there's numerous verses Malachi how many verses are all there will work till Jesus comes three okay let's sing the first verse can you pull that up there all right let's sing that let's stand our feet here we'll get into the Word of God after this amen [Music] can you start us there oh land of rest [Music] whose are with the course then Jesus comes again [Music] Jesus comes we were to Jesus comes we'll be gathered okay let's get Lord Rama falls amen like I just assumed our brother knew that some song that's my fault brother praise him then let's sing little as much when God is in it then we'll get into the Word of God aren't you glad God's in a little group as well using the big group he's in the little one thank God he's with this phrase much when God is in it labor not for well for and you can win it if you go in the harvest fee for you to do heart the voice of God is calling to the heart this call little is much when God is in it labor dot for well for there's a crowd and you can win it if you go in Jesus does the place does the place your call to Labour's seemed so strong it is great if God is in it and he'll not little is much when God is in it favor not for well there's a car and you can win it Jesus when the conflict when the god licked here is ended and our race he will say if we are [Music] little is much when God is in it labor not for wealth or if you preach and if you pre-heat in Jesus if you'll sing and if you'll see in G and if you'll pray if you'll pray in Jesus name let's go around thank you Jesus he's God let's go to numbers 19 let's take our Bibles this morning I like to preach on part 8 of the worship series to Sunday nights ago we preached part 7 the altar of incense but I'm gonna go get back to that Lord willing in the next few weeks and months if God's willing by God's grace numbers 19 verse 14 bang here yet okay no all right this would be a good time to recognize him because we're kind of in the transition here numbers 1914 I like to preach on part 8 of the worship and let's call our tents so we preaching about the homes that we live in and the atmosphere we're creating in our homes and I'm preaching this based upon the move of God I saw in Iowa in North Carolina just a tremendous move of God for repentance so I want to look a little deeper this two Sundays ago I preached on the red heifer to the holiest of holies I preached that same message in Iowa I preached at our church the following Sunday and I preached at last Sunday morning in North Carolina and just saw some tremendous effects to that message so I know that wasn't my thoughts it was God thoughts so we're thankful for God's thoughts numbers 1914 this is the law when a man dies in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days notice when there's death in the tent everything's affected the whole life the whole management of the home the whole routine of the home everything is affected in the home when something dies in the home and every open vessel and I'm liking this unto open minds as our children have open minds our spouses we all have open minds we're all open to receiving influence every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean and whosoever touches one that is slain with the sword and the open fields or dead body or a bone of a man or a grave she'll be unclean seven days and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burn half for a purification for sin and running water shall be put there two in a vessel and a person I'm sorry in a clean person so see the preacher has to be living a clean life as well a preacher living in sin cannot help cleanse a family or individual that's not living right before God it has to be someone who's walking in the anointing of the Holy Spirit and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon that touched a bone or swine slain or one dead or grave let's just bow our heads in that word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God somehow God sees every desire father in heaven we love you Lord God and we're grateful for these songs little as much when you're in it that little little boy just brought a little lunch and yet lordy when he brought it to you you were in it and so you blessed that effort Lord I know why we've said it before you know we just might have a one Talent Church here we might just I might just have a one Talent gift of preaching or pastoring but Lord I'm just bringing this little gift before you we're bringing our little licks before you our gifts our desires our prayers and father I pray your blessing in Jesus name Lord God take this word help us Lord God to be renewed in our minds Lord God help us to look at the condition of our tents our homes so father we just give you honor and glory and help me your servant help me Lord guard the gate of my lips Lord as the scripture says that it would not say anything that would displease you but I would just say things that would please you for Lord you ordained the foolishness of preaching to save them that would believe the world causes foolish but Lord you call it eternal you call it supernatural so Lord have your way this morning in Jesus lovely name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God Adam can you look out there real quick and see if Bank came in please thank you sir I just want to see if I can catch him one more time because you know I'm going to forget at the end of service I'm gonna forget then so we want to try to remember it by God's grace okay I'm going to show just a few slides here when you're ready okay that okay pretty good all right man can you just keep walking and come up to the front please and just keep walking don't sit down yet I know you got precious cargo come on up here sir I just want to thank brother vang for his faithful service and you know I was just brother bang I just want to say thank you you know I was thinking yesterday how bang got us in here with all the cords when we first moved in here in 2015 then he transferred everything over there and then when we downsized he transferred everything back here he has put countless hours in and so this is just a token of our appreciation let's get brother bang round plaus thank you sir love you say thank you for your faithful service brother and I know God will bless you richly for that God never forgets our labor of love never forgets our labor in love so thank you sir so I want to just pull up you know the recent leadership of the Holy Spirit the last month has just been it's been astonishing to me I'm trying to think of the right word just to see the move of the Holy Spirit in Iowa and North Carolina and I'm just so grateful and I just want to just I'll be sharing probably some of these things throughout this message but like I told you I don't wanna get you in maybe I needing a chance to tell you but in Iowa we preach a Saturday night in Iowa City which is a Congolese church and I preached on this redheffer thought and the 12 tables there's 12 loaves of shewbread and we just had probably you know 10 15 people come up for prayer three of the brothers I believe went up to brother Brooks the next week and said they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost as we pray we praying and saying for an hour I was jumping shout and praising the Lord at the end of the message it was a really tremendous atmosphere lots of people repenting of not paying ties Hollywood in their lives all kinds of things and I just got to the point where I said you have to tell me you know doctor tell me the next morning I preached an IO and Des Moines that the church that brother Brooks started and saw the same results we had a three-and-a-half-hour service we started at 9:30 I don't think we are there till one o'clock and everybody stayed there everybody sat there and I just preached the same thing I preached you there from the red heifer to the holiest of Holies and this is where we had marriages you know we had couples come up weeping confessing pornography and and inability to love their spouse and all kinds of problems and I was even counseling one of them yesterday on the phone you know count still could do in some marriage counseling you know by the permission of brother Brooks and so forth like that and and it was just a tremendous move of the Holy Spirit and then last week was II I hate to say it was just so powerful I have a hard time describing it but all my children saw it which I was just thanking the Lord afterwards that they could see the same word that I preached in Akron is the same word I preached everywhere it's God's Word it's the message of the hour and brother Tim Humes you know many of you know him a wonderful man of God his mother was healed of tuberculosis in 1954 in brother Graham's meetings it's on tape you can listen to it I shook her hand in 2010 when I was there preaching and she said you preached just what brother Branham preached and I said thank you that's one of the best compliments I could have because I stay with the prophets message by the grace of the Lord but anyways brother Tim Humes after the morning service I preached the same thought I start there was four people that came up for prayer started praying for the first one and mother Tim whisper and said I need to change the order the service and I got nervous I thought what did I miss the moving of the Holy Ghost or what it's a church of 300 and I said yes sir brother Tim whatever you feel led to do he's been the Africa over 20 times South America 20 times this is a man who does a work of apostle he's an apostle as well as a pastor and you can have multiple gifts we know that's in the scripture and he said I'm stopping this prayer line and I'm calling the entire church up for repentance and the whole church came up to the altar and he he started praying and the prayers got louder and louder and louder we prayed maybe 20 minutes maybe 15 minutes and he was confessing he was repenting of his failures he was asking the church to confess all their failures he got down on his knees weeping and crying asking God to bring revival to the church and now listen Church they've had three cancer healings in the last year and he said the church was still back slid so even miracles don't prove we're on fire that just proves the Holy Spirit was present but he was crying out for people to put God first in their homes and that's all I preached was just sin that enters into people's home compromises the same thing I preached at our church I didn't preach anything different over there and he's on his knees weeping and crying crying out to God it got so powerful he was cursing the demons of television he was cursing the demons of the Internet you know it's evil spirits to get on people you know when they watch the wrong thing he was cursing you know sickness he was cursing anything that would be in your home in the name of Jesus Christ and was so powerful people men were shouting and screaming and there was all kinds of worship it was just tremendous and then when we really I knew really knew it was God was when a young sister was throwing herself around and when it was the devil she was throwing herself around hitting people she hit him 95 year-old brother from brother Donnie Reagan's church she hit him and he got kind of an upset you know and so she she came up and took the microphone tried to take the microphone out of Timmy Hughes hand and Tim Humes you know he has enough experience to know that the Holy Ghost is a gentleman she was out of order and she was trying to say something good she was trying to say brother Tim I have a word from the Lord I had a dream last night she's trying to be prophetic had all this emotion and zeal but he said you're out of order and it broke the atmosphere but afterwards you know we still prayed and rejoice for a while but the fact was God was so in this preaching this message that I've been preaching God was so in this message that Satan anointed someone who was sincere but got them sincerely wrong and missed the order the order should have been if she had a dream or a prophetic word she should have brought that to the pastor before the service it doesn't erupt the angel of God who stands behind the pulpit you don't interrupt the spirits are subject to the prophets right Spears to the prophets or subject the prophets and as we talk later she had a dream she had a burden for the young people she was concerned about one of her friends and that she just let the devil she said when I win if he called everybody up for prayer she said she blacked out and that's when the devil came upon her the devil jumped on her I mean she was throwing herself and we're all praying it and she's got up there and tried to take the mic out of his hand and and so I saw it and they were kind of tussling that's why I turned around and saw so I went up there and I started rebuking the demon in Jesus name then she fell down and and after the service we brought in the back and brother Tim explained that's wrong you're out of order no matter how sincere you are like David no matter how sincere you are with the Ark it's got to come God's provided way and she admitted that she humbled herself and apologized for that and I just saw that as a sign that God Satan was trying to stop God moving back into people's homes and then that was just really powerful and I had people come up and say that he said that was probably the one of the best services in 30 years of having a church is they started the church in 1988 now that's that's humbling to me to know that I'm just I'm just little old pastor but that God would use the word it was the word because man can do nothing one man plants one man waters it's God that gives the increase his wife said that was nothing but God from beginning to end it was thus saith the Lord just what the church needs for revival to clean out the homes and then even for our midweek services I had a minister call me up and tell me well actually I called him I was asking him a question and he said my daughter was live streaming your Wednesday night service when I was preaching on the open door with Charles Spurgeon and William Carey you remember that brother hadn't when we were preaching on that a few Wednesday nights ago I don't know who streamed that but we were preaching on that and afterwards I was just saying how we got to be more devoted and dedicated filled with the Holy Ghost and even in that little service there we have maybe four or five people here the minister told me his daughter I think she's 19 or eight twenty maybe maybe eighteen she was just weeping on her knees after we were done preaching as we're praised and I see here it looks like so quiet and you know we're just there's the small little church but the Holy Ghost wants to speak to all of us and so she's in her home miles away many miles away on her knees weeping and dad can you pray with me so I'll be born-again the Holy Ghost this word has power we just have to open our heart to this word all of us I myself all of us and so now the brother Minister tells me his daughter's seeking the Holy Ghost like never before so church I believe with all my heart we're following the leadership of the Holy Ghost in these sermons that are coming forth it is not is not an idea of a man it's the Word of God and so this morning when I look at cleaning out our tents by the grace of the Lord now you know the scripture is clear the tent is a type of the home we know that and the tent is also the type of the individual because Paul said you are the temples of living God and we know these are types here so you know here's that picture the famous picture that it's under copyright so I don't know all the details but you can buy a copy from Happy Valley I know that so you know we have all these tents outside and each one of those tents you know represents our homes you know and of course we're not all gathered together or in a closed matter we all don't live in Akron but we all have a tent that's rally around the message of the hour how many understand what I'm talking about we're all this is the message of ours this is the holy ghost word and in the holiest of holies that's the prends of Jesus Christ that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all God's people are camped around the message of the hour does that make sense all right and so I want to just look at four examples from the scripture as I was preparing yesterday and I guess all week I had two days off this week that was great at Thursday and Friday often had more time with the family and more time in the presence of the Lord I just love being a teacher I just think there are so many nice benefits to being a teacher the first one is death in the tent which we covered and this was numbers 19 any dead thing in a house perverts the house and yeah I think that's good maybe open up the window I know it's real real hot in here and does that open okay can you feel coming in thank you appreciate that I know we have trouble with heating we have trouble with cooling I don't know why and it's only this room the other room worked fine it's only this room and I'd asked Beverly about it and she doesn't know and you have to pay somebody to climb up there or something I don't know sorry about that we just try to keep as comfortable as we are or as we can but Church we know our lives are much more comfortable than lives just fifty years ago so we don't have anything to complain about you know we have to be thankful we have so much to be thankful for and so as I like I said as I was at death in the tent you know as I was at ministering about the last few weeks you know the unclean tent from the scripture it cuts you off from the congregation which means you cannot enter into the worship of God you'll be around it but you'll never really enter and you never feel it okay so you won't feel forgiven because forgiveness takes place when the sacrifices is killed because you you put your hand on the head of the sacrifice and the sin of the sinner is transferred to the sacrifice so you net you really can't be forgiven if you've got sin in your life and you won't confess it in your home you can't feel forgiven you can brush it off and you can try to you know let something of the world satisfy you for a little while whether it's friendships or whether it's chocolate or whether it's coffee like I like coffee or whether it's uh you know events traveling vacations you can try to hush that voice of the Holy Spirit that feeling that you need to repent but it will never go away if you're a real child of God if you're not you can sear that and then that's when you cross the line between mercy and judgment remember Simon preach that message Cain went to the east side of the garden Cain Judas Loretta there on the east side so which is the ministers errands and Moses tensed over here so the serpent seed were trying to impersonate the true seed of God and they still lived a religious life but they never really entered in and I have a quote from the church age where brother Bram said Judas just faked justification he just faked it because the Bible says when you're justified you're already glorified that means you already have a glorified heavenly eternal body in heaven so someone that has sin in their house or their life they don't feel forgiven they don't feel right with God next if that's the case then they don't see the light they don't they can't appreciate the light of the seven church ages because that's the first thing you see when you walk in is the candlestick they'll never see the real shining light oh this is what a Christian in Laodicea needs to live like they'll never be the city on the hill they'll never be shining the light of Christ like they ought to because they're cut off they've got sin and they've got some sin in their tent and they're not allowed they're cut off from enjoying the light of their church age amen and then they don't enjoy the bread and this is where we see today like I was saying a couple weeks ago the bread the twelve loaves are the twelve New Testament mysteries that brother Branham gives us in cercis is the endtime there's twelve mysteries the Bible calls New Testament mysteries and people will they'll physically come to church but they won't even enjoy the preaching of the bread and they won't even joy the bread because they're cut off spiritually they don't even joy preaching anymore you can preach any mystery you want they're still not going to enjoy it because they're cut off spiritually they've grieve the Holy Spirit and in all spiritual and all spiritual application they don't feel forgiven they don't they're not shutting the light they don't experience the light of the church age then they're not feasting on the bread and then their prayer life is hindered which is the most important step to getting into God's presence because the last thing is cut off from God's fellowship and I have quotes and I could I could preach to you all day I have quotes but from the basis of fellowship 1961 brother Branham said when you get sprinkled out here he said you get you get divine healing he said sprinkling out here you get forgiven you can be forgiven and isn't that true you can have a sit brother BAM said he saw prostitutes he prayed for prostitutes and they would repent of their sin so much they got healed in his prayer line and then he saw said he would see real dedicated Christians with not enough faith to receive their healing it's I mean it's true like number like Matthew 7 Lord we've done many marvelous works it we've done many wonderful works in your name we've cast out devils we prophesied see they got clean for a little while they got sprinkled with the anointing but they never entered into a real worship because they were workers of iniquity which means they never really repented of their sins they were repent for a little bit they get sprinkled for a little bit but after that after that explosive move of God by the Holy Spirit they would go back to being workers of iniquity see they weren't every day Holy Ghost field Christian that's what we need today every day Holy Ghost field Saints Amen that keep the Word of God without compromise leave that with all of my heart and brother Tim miners came up afterwards they were weeping at the altar - he said brother that was such a deep message now to me I didn't think it was that deep but maybe it is maybe it is this message this all types our Holy Ghost experience with Christ how many understand that it types it perfectly and this is why people can come to church their prayers their not their prayers that feel like they're not even going past the ceiling tile because why they've got death in the tent they've got unconfessed sin they feel unclean well then you are unclean even if you're getting condemned by a guilty spirit you've got to cast that down you've got to feel forgiven how do you do that you've got to cast that down and you got to enter into the gates with Thanksgiving in your heart you've got to go through the steps you've got to thank God brother Bram said I never got out for my knees without thanking God for Jesus's death on Calvary so that's why we have to come in here we should be happy about the blood we should be happy about Jesus dying for our sins we'd be lost without the blood we need a fresh experience we all need it I'm part of it we all need a fresh experience of feeling like we're forgiven if we don't have that it's going to be very hard to get into the holy place where we can experience the light of our church age where we can be hot for Jesus and experience that light where your wick your wick is dipped half of it's dipped in the the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the other half is outside the Holy Ghost that's your flesh where people see you on fire for Jesus amen Laurie half of a part of my life is hid in Christ part of my life is visible for the world to see I love that I want to be a wick that's on fire for Jesus and so you know this is why and I hate to move from this slide I just hate to do this but maybe I'll come back but this is why the last few weeks when I went to Iowa and North Carolina I just preached on simple things I preached on Netflix cuz that woman out in Minnesota a couple years ago at the Labor Day meetings altar weeping and crying she said I've been ignoring my children at home while my husband's at work and I go hide myself in the laundry room and I watch Netflix seasons of evil shows and brother Tim was cursing Netflix do you understand what I'm saying now see these things are all the same internet smartphone they all have evil on them they're all a tree of knowledge of good and evil a TV cable my smartphone these are all trees of knowledge of good and evil what matters is how you control it are you controlling it or is it controlling you so this woman wasn't control it was controlling her the happiest part of her day was not ministering to her children trying to get them saved but it was sneaking off and watching some evil - TV shows so I'm trying to bring a balance of this you know movies you know it's preaching on Star Wars like I did a few weeks I've really hard and that's the good and I guess there was many young people there that some people knew we're into Star Wars I know it's the God you know I know it's God trying to help us to see the real Star Wars praise God which is the Bride of Christ the stars of God amen that's the real war that we're in and then I had like I said numerous people confessing the robbing god of tithes and offerings not having enough faith because the Bible said when you don't pay tithes and offerings you lack fear for God you fear the bank more than you fear God and God gave you a hundred percent Aussie asses for 11% back right or can I say ten point one you have to have offerings too you have to have offerings if not you're robbing god of an offering and it shows your freewill offering your heart is not in the right place you're just paying ties because you got to cuz you know God's gonna get you if you don't but when God put up the tabernacle with Moses and David the first issue was find somebody who's got a willing heart to bring an offering that's what actually established the first Tabernacles was willing hearts offerings set up the first Tabernacles of God amen offering wasn't tithes it was offerings see because offerings come from the heart and you can honor God with your lips or I love the message I believe brother Branham I believe Jesus and your heart can be so far from God the willingness for you to give of yourself and I'm just not talking about just money yes you should give offerings and money you should get offerings to the poor people and it's you shouldn't take away your ties to do that brother Branham said then you're robbing God there and you should be concerned about the poor you should be concerned about you should be doing these things in secret there's so many times Church I just have a holy zeal I hope you can understand this I see people the church is on Facebook they have all these have you seen them like like they do food preparations and they say they put all these food packages together and they send them overseas to people and I think it's so nice but the thing is they're just they're just broadcasting and Jesus said when you do that you have your reward there's no reward in heaven like they put on these hair masks you what are those hair masks all the kitchen cafeteria women put them on I forget you know they have those hair mask so hair don't fall into the food they'll make twenty thousand meals I saw in one Facebook post these megachurches right around here and they'll broadcast it look what we're doing for Jesus look what we're doing for Jesus but Jesus said don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing sometimes I get such a whole easy like I want our church to do something like that but we don't want it to bring glory to ourselves we want Christ to get glory so I feel like I just got to keep reminding the church if you are not giving to people that are poor than you praying God will show you to give it to somebody that's real Christianity what is pure religion pure religion and undefiled before God is visiting the widows and fatherless in their affliction and keeping yourself unspotted from Laodicea Lori that's pure religion finding somebody that's got it worse off than you and helping them and not asking for anything in return well brother Jeff's only have two mics left well there's a woman with two mites that gave it all to Jesus one time you understand its gateway and but see if we don't for not praying if we're not in the channel of prayer we won't we won't feel God's heart for people that are less fortunate than we are and then I preach really hard on church attendance the Bible says we must gather more as we see that Day approaching I don't know how you're doing it but I know how I'm doing it I'm having Sunday night services to gather more if the Bible said you literally so much more gather together with the Saints as you see that Day approaching that's my way to do that and like I said carry ends I forgot those who that the last few months but bro Graham said you will never be as good of a Christian by not hearing the Word of God than if you came to the house of God don't we all want to be good Christians but see we get lacks we get lazy we got our eyes off our eyes get filmed over the eagle eyes get filmed over sometimes we've got to gather more as we see that day approaching and that's you know that's a it's a it's a topic that was taking place at Iowa North Carolina all these took place and both pastors were up there crying yet brother Brooks was crying and brother Tim Humes are crying you know and when I went there I just know I'm gonna preach what's on my heart a burden for my church I'm gonna preach it for them and God was in a tremendous way and then complexes root of bitterness this is one this was the big cry at North Carolina there was brothers and sisters just when he was cursing complex and he was cursing I was praying and cursing roots of bitterness I mean people were just weeping and crying and it was a real move of God jesus said if you've got something against someone he said go to them one on one talk to them about your concern right how many can say amen to that if they won't hear you if they were pet get somebody else go be a witness and that's a thing in the message we don't do enough of we got to do more of that praise the Lord you have to do more of that if not it's gonna be a root of bitterness and it'll kill the anointing in the church that's right and neglecting the family like I said at numerous couples coming up their marriages are falling apart right one couple say they hate each other you know can you imagine and what is it Satan got in there and I said I said listen you're talking from your mind you have to talk from your soul in your soul you took that vow with that individual you vowed to be married them till death do you part and your soul you love that person but you let Satan build up some complex toward your spouse all these lies you've got to cast that down and they said that helped them tremendously you've got to stop living from the mind we must live from the soul what we know is right we must do what is right and then neglecting the family you know fathers not loving their wives parents not parenting their children and I think this one goes a lot law along with church attendance because when we don't put God first above everything else it sends a strong message to our children that God is not in the top priority God is just something we do on Sunday morning but see for the real family of God their life centers around Christ see that's what I said whenever whenever one of these dead ideas or dead spirits enters into home it affects everybody if a profiler compromises it's gonna instantly affect his children because he's gonna treat his children in the wrong way you can treat his wife the wrong way and then when you got husband and wife both with the complex or both with one of these lustful spirits or or selfish spirit or some some of these bitterness spirits when you've got that that's directly gonna impact the children double and people wonder why there's death in the tents and church I was looking out there preaching in Iowa in North Carolina and everybody can almost finish the quotes that I'm saying but they're all sin they're dead now not all I'm just saying like the people that need to repent you understand what I'm saying they can the Scriptures they can finish the quotes but because there's dead things in their homes the word doesn't mean nothing to him anymore they can finish the quotes they got this memorized they can tell you where that's found they can tell you all these things but who's got their first love very few people in the churches I've just visited and our church how many people have their first love and your first love is only known by the works that you do for Christ because when you have your first love jesus said you'll do the first works so you have to remember what works did I do when I was first Saved if I've got my first love I'll act just like that and the church said that's not the stage I see I'm not promoting my own idea that's the Bible those are red-letter words those are the words of your Lord and Savior my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ do you believe those words amen you you're the only one who knows if you're giving your first love to Jesus but I can tell you these these had an impact they had an impact and you know how they act in the next few days weeks that will prove that will prove if they really got washed they're sprinkled or not that will prove it now I just want you to prove I want to prove to you what a sprinkling means so I'm gonna try to go there I've got all these notes and ya got all these notes and I want to make sure I get to them and I want to be time because I want to make sure I got to help sister Naomi by the grace of the Lord let's go to I can't find it real quick here Airness okay sorry let's go to first Peter 1 verse 2 I'm gonna go back to that image there because I just think it's so powerful this one right here I just think that's so powerful to me and and I was just after I was preaching I was just weeping thanking the Lord in both places for showing me this cuz now now I can truly understand why people can come to church and I will fast and pray I'll pray my heart out I'll preach my heart out and they leave and it's like they never even heard nothing and you've seen it too with sinners we invite sinners here josè even interprets for people you know when Kevin grew up and by those guys that was so nice to him I don't know what impact the word had on them but any person whether have said anyone who gets in the presence of Jesus Christ will never be the same and you can't tell me the spirit of Satan is here because that's the spirit of lusts and confusion but what's here is order and the Word of God and that's the Holy Spirit that's the Spirit of Truth amen hallelujah I know that with all my heart so the only way someone could walk out of here and not feel the effects of having genuine fellowship thus saith the Lord God speaking directly to them the only way that can happen is if the individual kept themselves from being clean that's the only way the first Peter 1 verse 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through how are we elect how do we know we're elect because we let God sanctifies us sanctification of the Spirit unto what so when you say well brother gesture myself I want to be more sanctified what does that mean that means you obey more of God's Word because it's sanctification unto obedience and what sprinkling that means anointing so see we're elect according to the sanctification of the Spirit unto what so we'll be more obedient to Christ and we'll be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ and we know that sprinkling is not a physical blood it's the life of the blood the token amen the life of the blood so sprinkling symbolize purification or renewed cleanliness and the believer was enjoined or commanded to live in obedience to the Covenant because that's what Hebrews 9 says Hebrews 9 verse 18 whereupon neither was the first Testament was dedicated or consecrated without blood she always had that blood you always have to have a sprinkling you always had to be sprinkled you have to be enjoined or commanded or connected or anointed you have to be connected to that covenant for when Moses had spoken every precept to the people according to law he took the blood of calves at him goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people so he took that Holika he took that blood and he sprinkled the book huh me know there's an anointing on this book hallelujah hallelujah if there's not you better get clean because at one time you thought there was an anointing on it when you first came in the covenant but see you've let something dead come into your home and now the book doesn't seem anointed but the Bible said it's anointed Amen it's sprinkled oh I don't like to read my Bible shame on you you better clean out that deadness out of your heart and the church said that's the word just the word see sprinkle both the book and all the people praise God the Bible's inspired the people should be inspired amen they're enjoying to this covenant saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined or commanded unto you that means commanded in other words you've got to go bei this moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission of sins thank God for the shed blood of Jesus amen now can everybody see this type here is this clear is this clear that's why like you can preach on the rapture people aren't moved you can preach our marriage and divorce people aren't moved you can preach on the church age people aren't moved it's because deadness has struck them and some sin has taken them bitterness like I said greed whatever may be lusts and it's taken them and they can't enter in God actually cuts them I mean Oh God does that it's an are words are called grieving the Holy Spirit go to numbers 1913 you'll see this God would literally cut them off if you're gonna continue to live in sin and not repent God said I'm cutting you off you will not come to church and receive the same things you used to receive Oh hallelujah amen glory I'll tell you after these last three weeks I felt like a new Christian praise God just to see God take his word and bless the people and bring them to repentance all was just a powerful thing numbers 1913 whosoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead and purifies not himself see who's responsible to purify themselves the person who sinned the person who touched something dead they have to admit they're unclean and they have to purify themselves preachers can't make people confess they've got to confess themselves see because he purifies not himself he defiled the tabernacle of the Lord and that soul shall be cut off from Israel God said if you won't come to my house clean I'm cutting you off which means the effects of the Holy Spirit they won't even have fellowship with God and as we'll get to at the end then people just come for fellowship with other people then church is just a social affair and it's more important about who you talk to after service than who you talk to during in service we must talk to Christ in service amen because they cannot fellowship with God because God showed them if you do this you've touched something dead you're unclean I cannot fellowship with you while you're unclean and you know better so they just churches a social affair now it's it's it's eye-opening it's eye-opening to see oh now I can see people can be so happy after church but not happy during church how can you not be happy singing about the precious blood how can you not raise your hands or you can't even clap your hands in here but then somebody tell joka you'll cut your hands out there something's wrong with that the Bible said clap your hands o priests of the Most High God amen the Bible said lift up holy hands because we're supposed to worship God but see if people are cut off what can you what can you do you can't do anything God Himself cuts them off the person has to confess their sins look at verse 20 but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself he'll refuse to repent she'll refuse to repent that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he had to file this sanctuary of the Lord the water separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he's unclean God cuts them off I don't like you but I don't want God to cut me off the opposite is you've got to cut off the sin we'll get to that in a little bit that's the reality of it either you get cut off or you've got to cut something off of your life that's exactly right Church so we've seen the sprinkling now just for the sake of Bible continuity or the pattern of the Holy Ghost throughout the scripture go to Deuteronomy 1:25 the generation that could not enter in the promised land they murmured 10 times or they they they tempted God 10 times and God said after that tenth time you are not entering into the baptism of the Holy Ghost they had a promise in verse 25 but verse 26 notwithstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God to see they obeyed a lot of commands Israel but there was the the command to literally go into land the command that you don't have to be afraid of the battles in the baptism of Holy Ghost you can possess the land you are more than a conqueror to cast out the Giants that are in the land they were scared of the battles they were scared that they couldn't win the victory they were in other words they were scared they couldn't make the rapture they were scared they couldn't have enough faith for a body change so why even try they were scared they couldn't be as dedicated as they need to be dedicated oh my but see Joshua and Caleb had a different spirit they weren't afraid they knew God's calling Jin me that God if God's calling me their God will give it to me God will equip me if God's calling me in there if God sent him in there he'll give me the tools to go in there and be more than a conqueror but see they rebalance that we can't do it we're scared look how little we are look look at this now look at verse 27 and he murmured in your tents where did this happen it started in their houses remember the story of Elijah and the children that got eat up by she-bears remember that the RAM said what happened their parents used to mock Elijah old bald head in their houses so they learned to mock the preachers in their homes brought it out to public and then they got judged in public where to start in their tents so their tents spiritually were unclean spiritually and because they were unclean spiritually God cut him off now murmur means to backbite and whisper they will not enter the land murmuring or complaining about the preaching or complaining about the Word of God or the Bible says this or the Prophet said that they don't worse whisper back by or complain about that they ask God God give me understanding God give me grace to possess the promises of God I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I know if you call me to that position I'll make it by your grace amen they don't remem and do opposite of the word of God they do the word of God a third example Josh was 7:21 a can is spilling his beans we'd say he's confessing the sin to Joshua and he says when I saw among the spoils a goodly babylonians garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then I coveted them remember the Bible says covetousness is idolatry so akin get this in your mind akin did not have a a picture of William Branham up and bowing down and praising William Branham William he didn't have that he'd have Star Wars accessories he didn't have a Darth Vader statue saying I worship Star Wars he didn't have that he just had sin buried deep in his life unconfessed if you walked into his house he could have passed the test of other Bram said let me walk into somebody's house and let me look at their walls Oh hallelujah let me listen to what music that he could have passed the test but he couldn't pass the test of God Amen God because God saw pass just an outward profession outward religion God saw what was down deep in the ground of his heart exactly right and where was the sin in his house in his tent and what did God do to him swallowed him up in the earth right he tried to hide his sin in the tent and he hid it from everybody even hid it from it you know it's in there from his family I don't know what the three-part type is there but there's three Rob's there's closed money in a wedge I'm not quite not quite sure what that is I sure when I look into that later I can't I can't force God to give me a revelation it'll come in God's time a fourth and final one then we'll move on is Acts five nine with Ananias and Sapphira s' then Peter said unto her how is it that you have agreed together the temp that speared the Lord when did they agreed together to tempt the spirit it hadn't been somewhere outside of church because when they came in the church they lied and they fell down dead in the church and they had to pack him out and that's because there was some death there was some lie there were some Antichrist thought out there in their house that they agreed together to support - they agreed to lie to the Holy Spirit before coming before the Word of God in that striking the tent it's all about our tent it's all about our home in fact your attitude towards the church right now is what your attitude toward God is at home so when you see people not excited about church or now join the word anymore it's because they're not enjoying the word at home it is because just like at home you have a husband and wife just like in the church you have a husband and wife program said the pastor is the husband of the church praise God if you let the word of God get common at home and things does get common at home then everything's gonna be common at church you're not gonna have fellowship with God and not in something gonna feel like God's not even there well I can just go visit that church I should go visit that church I said maybe I should change my membership well maybe you should follow the leading of the Lord but it's not the word of God's fault if you're not having fellowship with God it's the fault of death in the tent amen we never beg anybody to stay here you want to come here hallelujah I'm going to preach the word to you I'm gonna try to live the word before you but this is the problem they don't that people don't enjoy we all know there's a honeymoon period with your marriages there's a honeymoon period just like there's a church when people move in here the church or people get freshly saved mother so on fire and that's just a many times that's a natural excitement but give it a few months and you'll see who's really in love with Christ but Dennis McBride written he and I were talking lately he said well Jesse I've learned over the years he said I get excited about the people who stay not about the new people that come and I said brother that's a lot of wisdom right there because you would get you get excited when your husband sticks with you even though you made a mistake or your wife sticks with you even though you made a mistake why because it's a vow of love and you've got commitment to make this fresh to make this work we're going to make this work we're in this to the end that's how we should be with our home church wherever God tells you to be we should be fully devoted fully committed and this is just the reflection of what's going on in your tent in your house nothing but the truth and like I said I've seen two pastors weep over this lately so I know it's just not my burden it's all genuine pastors it's all their burden that's right weeping is not enough to cry over sin is not enough it's a good start you can have a dried out confession but weeping is not enough numbers 25 verse 6 teaches us that Israel had been tempted by Balaam to go out to meet with Balaam at bale peor it was a feast of make believers Oh with I say like this make believers they were tempting people that thought there were believers from Israel they were tempting them with sexual lusts and member 24,000 died remember that brother man likens that unto bride or people who go to message churches that get tempted to go to denominational churches because they let them do any old sin they want to do say you're still going to heaven you said I'll say like this I don't know who's going to heaven but I know those who got the Holy Ghost will be in the word all the way and they'll be so sprinkled with God's blood that there will be obedient and sanctified to the day of their exemption amen so there's this awful plague going around because of the sexual sin and in verse 6 the Bible said behold when the children of Israel came and brought us under a brother and a mini nice woman the side of Moses to the side of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation so everybody's are weeping everybody's crying right here I'm sorry right everybody's crying right here oh there's such an awful plague Oh sin is so awful and church sin is awful sin is awful you feel like you feel like you're not forgiven if you like you you don't even you feel dark like there's no light you feel like you're hungry there's no there's no bread feels like your prayers or do you mean hurt it feels like God's not even listening to you amen but weeping is just the start because they're just weeping and then what happens the plague didn't stop because people came up to the altar weeping the plague stopped when a Phineas got ahold of the spear and he went into the tent of that Israelite man and he thrust it through the man and the woman who are committing fornication and then the penguins of the plague would state that's when you'll get your victory back when whatever you were holding on to gets cut off and it dies amen we've been as not enough they were all leaping right here but Phineas said somebody's gotta have a burden to get this sin out of the church amen and God said I'm going to make him a priest forever because he was zealous for the tabernacle of God amen glory God make me a Phineas let me be a Moses or Aaron whatever I just want to be on the Lord's side amen he said while he was zealous for my sake among them I consume not the turn of Israel in my jealousy God said because Phineas did this I'll give him my covenant peace he'll always have peace with God who always that fellowship with God because he was zealous to cut out any sin out of their lives and it was the it was the Prince of a chief house this wasn't just a regular message church member this was a prince message member he was a well-known message member and so as his adulterous nurse it may be adulterous or fornicating woman she was a daughter of a chief house of midian these were well-known famous people this is well this is a heavy type air heavy offering give her this is somebody who's really well-known in the church and it'll go there and cut that sin out of the church see because Finnish knew either we're going to call it the sin or God's going to cut us off so he cared more about the people that he did about one family that's how we are - we care more about the body of Christ than just one individual who won't repent or something like that what we have to do is make sure there's no leaven in the house amen weeping alone won't do it it's going to take going home and cutting out the dead thing in Matthew 21 Jesus cleansed the temple for the second time he cleaned it on the first year of his ministry he comes back in the third year of his ministry and he cleanses it in Matthew 21 verses Alette or 12 13 and 14 after he cleanse at church in verse 14 the Bible said and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and He healed them once all the dead things were caught out once all the money grubbing was cut out of church now people could get healed amen just like here people could get healed if they'll just get the deadness other tent get away from it get anointed then the prints of God and God will heal us God will heal you God can heal me God can heal anybody if they'll just repent of their sins amen and cut it off and this word brought three up say like this with all the people combined maybe 350 people to their faces and I appreciate that sincerity see God cuts them up because in Matthew 13 58 he said he did not many works there because of their unbelief if someone won't realize and you know I am I am unclean if someone won't admit that and humble themselves and come before the gate there then God said I'm gonna cut you off they really don't believe the message right they really don't believe it he could do men not many mighty works because of their unbelief in 1st Peter 3:7 if a man doesn't treat his wife right the Bible said his prayers are hindered this is a perfect type God cut you off you won't have any fellowship with your prayer a man that won't treat his wife the right way he has no altar of incense in his house I'm glad God hears our prayers amen if God doesn't hear your prayers there's probably something dead in the house never understand God cuts off your prayers if you won't treat your family right if there's death in your tent if there's some bad feeling in your house I'm not even listening to your prayers it's a perfect type that's why to me it was it was thus saith the Lord to me it was this is the word all tied together praise God like I said I couldn't preach this the first year came the message God had to add one thing at a time I had this add that add that that and God showed it to me first John 3:21 beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God an unclean man could not come in he could have no confidence with God he's cut off remember the Bible said in James chapter 1 if you asked for wisdom but then you're tossed back and forth like I don't know God heard my prayer the Bible said let not that man think he shall receive anything from the Lord God cannot take even unbelief even unbelief or doubt is a unclean sin and you need sprinkled for unbelief how many could say amen to that just even in your prayer is God gonna meet my financial need God's gonna give me wisdom with this difficult situation with my family I don't know how to handle this with somebody at the church you can't even doubt that you've got to have faith to know that God wants to help you amen God will help you but a spirit of unbelief is uncleanness and let not that man think he'll receive anything from God because he's cut off so uncleanness is as simple as doubting God and that pastor with brother Tim Eames was praised that God let the people start listening to their tapes again in the homes praise God you know I think whatever IFC happened and maybe Wendy and brother John and those of you know but we've been cutting together since we come in when we first came in there was so much preaching on people that all just memorized brother Branham memorized brother Branham but they weren't doing what brother Branham said I think there was so much preaching on that Satan may have used that oh yeah I'm a listener brother Ram so much and you can quarter this than that I think Satan use that to get people well it's not how much I listen to brother Branham but yet if you believe the Bible you will hear God's prophet if you are hungry for truth you will press play on your phone or on your mp3 player right you will do that but I think that was used so much and yes it was right because there are some people that worship brother Branham that break the word and they listen to tapes all the time but they only do what they want to do on those tapes not what the Holy Spirit is telling them to do and they'll never play a tape that burns their hide they'll never do that because that evil spirit wants to hide behind it that religious thing and say we'll look how we're listening to message we're faithful all these things like that let's listen to it and let's confess if we're wrong let's repent if we're wrong let's obey all the Word of God clarissa don't you know even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sin of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for it because he cuts him off if they won't repent of the and like I said last week it's for us in the message it's not what not well we need more new stuff we need to live the old stuff we need to do what we know is the right that's the problem we're not doing what we know we should do God's getting second place or some spirits got in there we're disobedient though were the words not fresh anymore but God said it's always gonna be fresh how can God say the words always gonna be hot and fresh whether you say it's not hot and fresh some somebody's ruling here you are God I don't know I think you're wrong it's always hot fresh bread before the throne of God for people who are clean in God's eyes amen it's exactly right see critical murmuring see sin because they love sin they speak against God's Word it's exactly right remember in our adultery when Jesus preaching on adultery don't you love when he magnified the law I love how the Bible said he magnified the law what is the magnifying glass do brothers it makes things that are small it enlarges them and Jesus came and he enlarged the sin of adultery it's not the physical act but we got to see things that were previously unseen that's what a magnifying glass does you can't see those little cells but when you look through there that Magnum microscope now you can see something living that was previously unseen and when Jesus came to Sarah preaching on lust their spirit / lusts what was he doing he was magnifying the law so now we can see the effects of these unseen living things these unseen fallen angels these demons amen glory he magnified the law he largest so we can see all there's living things under this cancer and the church said there's a life inside of that cancer there's a life inside that tumor you've got to get to the unseen thing and he magnified the law that we could see and understand these things so jesus said if you've already lusted in your heart you've already committed adultery he said if your right eye offends you keep it for a while let it hang on for a few months and see if you can enjoy sin for a season and still be a Holy Ghost field Christian no no Jesus said if that right eye offend thee pluck it out he said cut it off cut it out don't let that sin remain in your tent he said it for its profitable for thee that one of your members should perish and that not the whole body he said be cast into hell he said if the right hands offend you cut it off see the less law of God either you cut off the sin or the unbelief or God's gonna cut you off right and in every temptation we read on Wednesday night God makes a way of escape you can't say well well I couldn't overcome this bill jester I couldn't do that no sir God had an exit sign somewhere you've got to look around for the exit side amen now we need one over there actually I think to meet code though trustees bang bang you know I've got to work on that I do honestly think we might need one I don't have to look into that I know we have one down the end of the hallway that's just some small but anyways God I just gotta throw in Spyder God says there's got to be an exit sign amen there is a way out the promise we're too busy looking at the sin then looking at the exit sign and he said flee from idolatry run from it don't run to your phone run to Christ don't run to the backbiting run to Christ or run to that person and talk to them about your problem how many love Lord so let me close with this how what time is it okay I never set a timer I forgot I was you know giving bang his gift there I want to just close with this thought this is the discipline I'm calling like I said in my invitation to the church I'm calling everybody to be more disciplined this year it's up to you you know if you know if you don't feel the pole the Holy Spirit that's fine but I feel the pole after what God has done in the last three weeks and also the previous year I feel a pole to be more dedicated to Christ I brought my children here the last two months every Sunday and we prayed 30 minutes before service right here and my children their behavior home has tremendously improved I'm a witness to that and I'm praying every Sunday film what the Holy Ghost film what the Holy Ghost let them love you Jesus more than I do give them a double portion of what's on me because I know you're telling me there's a lot of love for Jesus and if they could a double portion when I got hallelujah they'll love Jesus even mihari men and that's my prayer so it's the leaders remember if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house how should he take care of the house of God a man rules his own house which means presides over that means he's the guardian see he's supposed to make sure death doesn't come in the house it means the protector he's supposed to protect his children from evil influences he said it means to give attention to he's supposed to diligently pay attention to the affairs of his house but see we got so many things distracting us mainly for brothers it's work you know we get so tired at work right mother bangs not in there yeah I'm the same way you know when I get so busy work or there's different things that come up and you know just a normal things of life it just takes our focus off our homes but we're the ones brothers we have to answer to God for the state of our homes and we can't expect to rule the house of God or be a leader in the church if we're not leaders in our home which means presiding over giving attention to our homes making sure there's no sin in our homes and then women have a role in this too did you know the word the Bible said that women are to marry bear children and guide the house did you know that guide you know if that means manage family affairs she is to manage the family affairs while daddy's out her hubby's out she's the manager so he's like the CEO and she's like the manager is that okay illustration right but the CEO comes to check on the managers is that true I'm just trying to give you an illustration he can't be there all the time but he's gonna come and check in this how's this going I need to preside over this I need to watch how's it going never I understand I'll tell you when my wife when she gives the order those children line up because she's the manager there she's guiding the home sometimes I gotta shake myself a little bit I'm so tired you know all right be the man preside over you know because she's just used to being in the channel being a manager which I appreciate that but as a man I've got to come home and I've always got to be ready to be the presider the overseer I've got to be able to give grace and help to my wife and strengthen my wife and love to my wife right husband's mistreat your wives no husbands love your wives wives tell your husband's what to do no sir wives submit yourself to your own husband's as unto the Lord in everything let's say together let's say everything ready everything she's to submit in everything but see a man's got to be led of the Spirit for her to submit to that he's got to be a loving leader he's got a stain he's gotta be a Phineas - he's gotta stand up against it he's got he's got to be a real man he's got to rule this house who's responsible for the dedication overall in the house it's the man who's responsible for the discipline of the house it's really the man it should be and he's called to that and let me say this I really felt like and then you can you can maybe disagree with me on this I felt like when I preach the Thyatira in church age I thought God I felt like God gave me a thus saith the Lord on Revelation to the 2:19 let's read that I felt it was like a dust say at the Lord to me it's the secret to being an overcomer and that's what I was preaching out with the other places and I told it to you here I felt brother man said Jesus gonna whisper secrets for the rapture to his wife until he comes back and I felt this was a secret Christ whispered into my soul that the way to be an overcomer is not to decrease your service to Christ but increase it because just think of it logically just be logical to have your first love you have to do your first works right but then Jesus said I saw your first works but I saw your last to be more than first so it was revealed to me that a Holy Ghost filled Christian or someone who's an overcomer they're able to capture and harness the love and zeal they had for God when they first came in the message and actually increased it until they died or rapture amen how did he appraise God Damon it's revealed to me Solomon what he what he stopped doing he stopped the ministry of God he started building temples for idols he never kept his first love he actually decrease in the amount of service and Tabernacles and sacrifice he actually decreased as he went along and so when I see people decreasing ties offerings church attendance decreasing attention during service decreasing anything - decreasing fellowshipping with the Saints what's what's happening here we shouldn't decrease we should increase and you can you can bring me I'm happy to meet anybody you can bring me a Bible argument or quote argument anywhere and I'll meet you right in that room right there or we can meet right here at the pulpit but if anybody can show me anything different I'd sure like to see it and have a word message and everything together I sure like to see it if I'm wrong because I know I'm not wrong cuz it's God's Word that's how you know you're right you got the word okay revelation 2:19 I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last works to be more than the first works but jesus said if you want if you want to get right with God you got to go back and do the first works yes you do you see you've got to go back and new your first works what was I doing for Jesus when I first came in the message you've got to go back to that replicate that reproduce that do it again and then actually find more ways to increase your service to God is that clear is that Bible teaching we all say Amen it is amen it is amen Lynette so what a lesson this is there's no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the Lord see because people that really love the Lord they're serving him and giving him more of their time more of their service because they're not their own they were bought with the price I do not belong to myself I belong to Jesus Christ he shed his eternal plan to save me and the least I can do is find more ways how to serve him in my life amen but if I decrease my service what I'm sure is that I've let something dead come into my house my life it's actually drawing away it's actually I'm less influenced by the Word of God unless influenced by these things they don't mean as much to me and now I've got dead things that I love more in my home than I love the house of God hallelujah praise God amen thank you Jesus buh-bam said that is the secret I thought it was thus saith the Lord to me sister Wendy I thought I no wonder I had to preach these Church ages no wonder I preached 50 messages on the church pages let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord see that's what Satan's doing now he's trying to decrease the amount of service you do to God money witnessing church attendance you name it time on your phone he's trying to decrease your service and brother man tells us what our reply is Satan saying oh you don't have to do this come over here you just take a little break he said take a little break brother BAM said our reply is increased service so when Satan saying brother Jesse just you know relax a little bit don't get so uptight about serving God I look at him and say shut up devil I'm gonna give God more of my time now get behind me because I'm resisting you and the Bible said you've got to flee amen he might sound like he's talking all around your ear keep resisting him he's got to go eventually amen you have to suffer through you know trials all this time the reason we feel like Satan keeps binding us in these things is because we let him stay because we obey what he says rather than resisting what he says but if you resist him and knew what's right he has to flee that's the st. the scripture amen and so just as a little testimony here let me show this I've steered my brother Scott a couple weeks ago I started writing a book about your outward appearance I've given every moment of my time now I've got an introduction introductions done 500 words chapter one has done six thousand three hundred twenty six words chapter two how to apply Old Testament scripture the New Testament four thousand five hundred eighty five words I preached three times a week sometimes five because twice at middle school Bible Club I've got fifty two YouTube videos all about the message of the hour I'm gonna write a book by God I told you last summer remember adamant bow I told you how the minds day I said God's leading me to write a book and so I've got two chapters done I'm gonna find a way to fulfill Revelation 219 in my life I will not be a Solomon I will be a Christian I will find a way to give more of myself to Christ because it is only Satan himself it is only the Antichrist pale death horse rider that's trying to say just decrease your just decrease your service a little bit be less they they dedicated to Christ I'm gonna be more dedicated to Christ my reprise show up Satan I'm giving God every moment of my time amen let's stand to our feet by God's grace and I'm just doing that as a little testimony here I'm finding every channel I can to be a blessing of the Bride of Christ so see a real overcomer he's the most diligent or she's the most diligent person on the earth is a real overcomer because they're diligently giving more of themselves to Christ they go back when they repent they go back to their first works and then they increase it the overcomer the secret habit and overcomer is also sacrificing more of their time for christ more services for christ more dedication which leads to more success Joshua said you have good success if you do three things speak the word don't let the part of your mouth think only on the word meditate on the word obey the word he said you'll be a good success how many want to be successful as a Christian I do so see the secret habit of the overcomer is that they they are more organized than the foolish person because they organize their entire life to set around more service to Christ they are better planners they're more organized they're better planners they have better meditation they're more disciplined than foolish Christians because their service to God is always increasing so they have to say no to everything else and they have to say yes to Jesus Christ well Graham said when people get lacs and they become drifting like the ephesian church age they were drifting he said they stopped doing what they used to do and start doing things they initially wouldn't do initially wouldn't miss church I initially wouldn't miss paying my tithes and offerings I initially wouldn't watch that but now we watch it sometimes you see how death enters in so simple but the Christian the secret that Jesus I believe is whispering like I told these charges the secret is whispering is give me more of your time put me first be more organized for me plan ahead more like we shouldn't be missing church we shouldn't even be late to church you have to plan if your letter the Holy Spirit you plan all the events so you can get there to enter into the Holy Spirit and I appreciate people that drive long distances I think that's tremendous I think that's fantastic but we used to drive three hours to church in Lima and we were there at nine o'clock or 9:15 every Sunday morning for Bible study with brother Craig and church started at 10:30 see the real Holy Ghost field Christian they hear the whispering of Jesus if you want your first and then I'm calling you to more service that's the Bible are we always decreasing in the work of the Lord or abounding who can finish that sense for me we are always what anybody abounding 1st Corinthians 15:58 wherefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord that means increasing for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord therefore as you abound in everything Christians and faith some people don't have enough faith to put on a tape you know I'm enough faith to come and pray or lay their hands on somebody somebody's at the altar I don't have enough faith to come up and help them pray why cuz there something's dead something's dead and they feel unclean but see we abound in everything in faith and utterance we're always talking about the Lord talking about the message talking about the word in knowledge and in all diligence and in your love for us see that you abound in this grace also diligence means your earnestness your striving after anything your interest what are you most interested you should be more interested in the message of the hour and the church said if not then you've lost your diligence and the orders only one way to get it back go back and do what you used to do cut off everything else that distracts you from the Word of God and give Jesus everything that's the only way that is the secret to a Christian brother BAM says increase your service saying said oh just cut this corner here don't go to church on Wednesday night don't even try to livestream it's not worth your time oh it's worth more it's worth everything it's worth everything you won't be as good a Christian on Thursday without the Word of God on Wednesday because God is able to make all grace abound to you I don't know how it's gonna work God but I know I'm gonna put you first I might be a little tired at work or I might be a little short on some bills but I'm gonna put you first anyway the Bible said God will make all grace abound to you if you abound your life and time to Christ he'll make all his grace abound to you amen bori may abound to every good work see how habits reveal what spirit is anointing us Butler have said habits our spirits I've got a habit not to pay my tithe I got a habit to skip preaching I've got a habit not to play brother Branham at home it's because you got an unclean spirit on you and the church said habits you just got a bad habit amen ask me a few months ago he said but Jessie can you preach on habits so I just said it on my to-do list I'll do that preaching on right now these are just habits Netflix smartphones bad apps bad videos there's just habits spirits I mean you can get to work half an hour early but can't come to church half know early I'm not making it a law I'm just saying like Jesus said we should increase you know and bound in our works for Jesus how does work and family get more devotion than Jesus Christ how can it happen it's because something died somebody is cut off they don't even hear they don't even hear God's God we used to whisper come fellowship with me I like to feed you my word I have a table spread where the saints of God have a and I'm inviting you come and have fellowship with me coming here if I say it the Lord but it's like I'll just make an excuse I've got a marriage I gotta attend to I've got a field I got attend to I've got a yoke of oxen and pretty soon pretty soon there's no more fellowship with Christ well God doesn't talk to me at the church anymore did he use to is God still talking or not what do you think church is God still talking or not who is the most disciplined person who is the most organized person who is the most successful person who is the most abounding person those who are giving Jesus Christ more of their time more of their attention more of their service how many believe that habits are spirit so we just got in a bad habit of doing this you see what happened for whom a man is overcome of the same he's brought in bondage some temptation over Cain you so now you're a slave to that spirit that's true whoever overcome whatever whatever robs you from this fellowship with God that you used to have now your slave to that spirit and like I said I've seen pastors and congregations weep over this thought weep but crying is not enough gotta be cut off the home life has to change does every understand the home life has to change but llores if you'll come here let's close here I hope everybody can see this is not my thought this is the Word of God and I believe that's another fresh revelation I believe it's a revelation that just struck me yesterday as I'm studying the last works you're the end of your life should be more dedicated than the beginning of your life that's the secret to being overcoming Christian that's to me that's a it's a thus saith the Lord so I know any time someone tries to talk me out of doing more for God I know I can look the devil in the face and say say and get behind me God has spoken to me in his tabernacle I had fellowship with God at church one night and I know I'm not to compromise on the Lord I'm gonna give Christ all of my time I'm a servant of Jesus Christ I'm a prisoner of Christ I don't want to be prisoners again that's just by our heads here I'm opening the altar if anyone's come up and pray you're more than welcome to come pray I believe that I believe that this message has the power to change people's lives and what's called renew them because I think all of us would say we've come to church and we've enjoyed the the light of the church ages and the bread but sometimes it tastes stale and that's not God's fault that's a that's a delusion that's a deception God always has fresh bread if we're not happy with our fellowship with God it's not God's fault it's our fault we've got to cut something off from our lives there's some parasite attached to our lives it's sucking our life away and we're not as strong as we used to be so I'm going to open the altar here to have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank you Lord for this message I flew hundreds of miles to Iowa then I drove a thousand miles to North Carolina and I seen this same message produce a real response Lord I just felt burdened one more time to try to preach it to our church Lord to help anyone that needs help in this area in orders I gave that invitation on the paper I believe that with all my heart I believe we should all be more dedicated and disciplined true discipline is beating your body in this objection and increasing your service to Jesus Christ not decreasing increasing [Music] Lord I stand upon this word you said I must study myself approved that I would not be ashamed of what I preach I have nothing to be ashamed of because I've only preach your word and you reveal it to me in that room over there lord god you're the one you reveal that to me we must go back to the first love and then let that first love grow and produce more and more and more for Jesus Christ I'm happy to do it Lord just have mercy when I fail just help me to come back and get sprinkled at the church Lord get sprinkled in my prayer life at home Lord just let me come back and be sprinkle that I can enter back into the worship of the Lord and I can joy the cross again I can enjoy the church ages the light of the age I can enjoy the mysteries of God and I can have a real prayer life that brings me into your presence so I can hear the say it's important thank you Jesus hallelujah you said I'll meet with you there between the cherubims upon the mercy seat or than we know now our heart is the mercy seat Lord God we know that meet with us Lord upon the tables of our heart Lord God speak to us Lord God may church feel like thus saith the Lord again and not just some tent out in the wilderness where there's stale bread or lamps have gone out may it feel like communion with Christ again Lord it's up to us we're the ones that have to come and get sprinkled it'll take more than weeping Lord in our lives it'll take cutting off the influence bless us now Lord God I don't know what's gonna happen from here on out Lord I the service I don't know well Lord I know you've revealed to me that I must increase my service for you that's why I'm writing the book I'm giving every moment that I possibly can to this gospel use me Lord God use me as a vessel of righteousness use the church Lord God help us to have a burden for prayer on Sunday mornings help us have a burden for the Word of God increase our service that's my prayer for 2018 Lord God thank you for your love and the Word of God in Jesus Christ's name Amen draw me nearer blessing to the cross [Music] domine border Armenia oh well Bram said we do not come in the sanctuary the Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God then go to our homes you come here to talk to him and let him talk back to you as we sing this talk to him would you you'll hear him talk back to you it'll be a still small voice and it will not point you outside the word it'll point you to the word missing that again just talk to him Church or Jesus may the Saints talk to your Lord God talk to you now [Music] I just keep playing that what a privilege people we are to hear the word of God if you're thankful for the word just tell him thanks in some way maybe in your heart maybe by lifting your hands just talk to Jesus for a moment Lord thank you for using this message in these two cities these three City forces thank you I'm thankful for this word it has been thus applied it to my life I pray Lord each person will be sprinkled under obedience anointed until they obey anointed so they can obey what you're telling them to cut off if there's something to cut off if they feel like I don't have the fellowship I used to have nor have the prayers the bread isn't as fresh God me they cut it off our first love requires first words thank you for this word Lord draw me near or draw me near Oh near a vessel to the cross where thou has died call me near through nearer blessed Lord to thy precious one more time just play that drumming Jesus

heart Lord with the Holy Ghost that it fill him Lord God then it fill his heart and mind and soul may he yearned for you may hunger and thirst right upon the fleshly tables of his heart the Word of God will cause him to keep every word of God hallelujah let me sprinkling every day in prayer sprinkled into obedience Oh God use him for your glory Lord Jesus empower him Lord God hallelujah may he have this fellowship with you Lord Jesus thank you Lord that he can have fellowship Lord with you in the holiest let him come with boldness we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name I mean here Oh Oh let's heal around Falls amen thank you Jesus we love your word Lord at Bride of Christ fellowship help us to love your word Lord praise the Lord God is so good to us I trust that most of us many of us have had fellowship with Christ today that's when we know we're in the holiest of Holies when we come to church and we have thus sayeth the Lord in our lives and we're ready to obey it I hope everybody will be more disciplined and able to show more increase of service and dedication to the church this coming year find a way to give more dedication to Christ this year you'll always know you're in the perfect will of God when you're giving more time to Jesus Christ you always know that we don't want Satan to get any amount of our time we want to give Christ all of our time last night
