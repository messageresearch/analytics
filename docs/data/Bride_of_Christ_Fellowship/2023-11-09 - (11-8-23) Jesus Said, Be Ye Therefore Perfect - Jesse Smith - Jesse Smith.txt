========================================

you know this actually this thought came from a brother I think it was Ben NAD or uh kadre digs I can't remember but he was talking about be perfect and he said you know what scoffield said scoffield said this wasn't a sinless condition so I just looked at my Bible and sure enough uh by Matthew 5:48 there's a footnote I think nature of virtue were asking about the footnotes or the comments in the Bible remember we talking about that and so the footnote says scoffield said the word implies full development so Jesus said be ye therefore fully developed Jesus didn't say be ye therefore perfect and never sin again he never said that he said be therefore fully developed right the word implies full development growth into maturity of godliness in other words be therefore mature that's what he's saying don't be a baby Christian don't be a child Christian right when I became a man I put away out is things right not sinless Perfection scoffield says he says In this passage the father's kindness not his sinlessness is the point in question so we'll look at the context here right now so You' got your Bibles let's read it let's go to Matthew 5:43 so Jesus is not asking you and I to never sin that's not what he's asking us okay now does he want us to live as close to him as possible yes but he's not trying to make us feel condemned if we sin every day right and that's another one I'm not sure if we can make it through a whole day without sinning that's another one I'm not sure I'll say Amen because all things are possible to them that believe right it could be possible right um like I would think I would imagine on the day Enoch got raptured Elijah I would imagine they were pretty close to God right God was going to take them off the earth I I don't know how God could take them off the Earth in a sinful condition so imagine they were really close to God on those days and we don't know I'm not sure what time of the day they got raptured okay so Matthew 5:43 I think scoffield had a a good thought on this he says ye have heard that it have been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you so let's stop right there a perfect Christian blesses those who curse them loves their enemies does good to them that hate them and pray for those who persecute you and despitefully use you in other words a mature Christian will love their enemies that's what this passage is about it's not about well I didn't sin yesterday or I didn't sin last week or I didn't sin whatever that's not what it's about it's about being a mature Christian having the kindness of Christ in fact actually it's the kindness of the heavenly father right now we know Christ CH was kind as well but this context is Jesus saying being be like the father who sends rain on the just and the unjust okay verse 45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye are you mature if you only love the people at church the people that patch on the back or hug you or Shake Your Hand are you are you mature if you just love the people that are kind to you no you're actually immature right people should know us right away wow that that person that sister that brother they can treat somebody really good who treats them really bad what reward do you have ver finishing verse 46 do not even the publicans the same now just bear with me Publican in the Greek means a tax collector or a toll collector they were detested not only by the Jews but by other nations also both on account of their employment and the harshness greed deception which they did on their job Jesus said even the harsh greedy deceivers are good to those that are good to them he said you got to be different you got to be more mature than a harsh greedy deceiver right because just loving the people that treat you good anybody can do that that's not maturity that's immaturity right verse uh 48 so then he said I'm sorry verse 47 and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which in is in heaven is perfect Hallelujah all right so the Greek definition of this of the word Perfection it's it's number uh 5046 it's brought to its finished end wanting nothing necessary to completely so it means you lack nothing Jesus says be therefore perfect other words be in a spot where you don't lack any anointing amen hallelujah praise God be in a spot where you're not lacking kindness we're not lacking uh love and mercy that's Perfection where you where you have enough of God's spirit to be kind to people that are awful to you that's perfection in other words be filled with the Holy Spirit Hallelujah it also means that which is perfect or complete it's consumate consummate human integrity and virtue so it's the highest level of Integrity it's the highest level of uh virtue there there's virtue there's I like how that name keeps coming up praise God we need a faith in here right we need a faith virtue now we need a knowledge in here and a Temperance in here surely we get a patience here one of these things Hallelujah it says it's the highest level of integrity and virtue of men full grown adult of full age mature so Jesus says be ye mature be ye lacking nothing even if someone deceptive or greedy or angry or someone would mistreat you you can show the love of God to them that's the context of what this is saying all right so Jesus is not talking about sinless perfection there's only one that could do that Hallelujah the one who's talking Hallelujah Jesus okay so Jesus is saying do not be a hypocrite and do not be like the Hypocrites be full with God's anointing who can be a mature Christian this means the publicans were just spiritual babies right they were spiritual babies if even they were spiritual at all they were just harsh greedy deceptive they could not love their enemies of course they had a lot of them right someone that would take your money you got a lot of enemies right for us it might be the modern day IRS agent or something like that but that that's what Jesus is saying in context it's saying we must be mature we must be filled with God's spirit we must have love or fruit that we can give to someone who's dishonest or deceptive or angry or or deceiver we must be able to be kind to them as well now before we move on to some more scriptures here's the foundational truth remember uh Romans 310: 111 say there's none righteous know not one there's none that understands there's none that seeketh after God so think about that brother brandham or Billy Graham or Martin Luther John Wesley none of these guys on their own sought after God no no matter the great Miracles or the great revivals none of them really sought after God God sought after them praise God in other words they weren't perfect brother Ram plainly tells us I wasn't perfect he Saidi not fit to live in in all sincerity he said I'm not saying that to be humble he says in this flesh in our flesh none of us are fit to live none of us are have sinless Perfection praise God the Bible said uh yeah there's none that seeketh that through God now also I love what Paul says you know Paul says that we should despite this We should strive to perfect Holiness in the fear of God in 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness so see Paul wants us to strive to always be free from filth right of the Flesh and of the spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God so it's the fear of God that will drive us to live as close to God as we can I don't want to I don't want to disappoint God I don't want to grieve God's spirit I want to please God hallelujah so we should have that desire I like to go a whole day with without sinning I like to go long time without sinning I don't want to be a slave to that and I actually heard a preacher say this not even the message but he said he said really you know when we say we're addicted really we're not and he gave a good illustration he gave an illustration of a man who's addicted to porn let's say he had his phone right there let's say he's in a room all by himself and then let's say he used the Isis guy now today to be a Hamas guy right and then let's say the man he's right there ready to click and he says well I'm addicted let's say a Hamas guy comes in with a hostage and said if you click on that this person's losing their life now are you addicted no so see how it's a deceptive Spirit see it's it's a spirit even making you think you're addicted you wouldn't be addicted if oh you'd throw the if the man or whatever was the woman they'd throw the phone away no spare the life spare the life I'm not that addicted so see it's the enemy's trick to make you to make us think sometimes we're addicted when really we're not we're just down in the dumps so maybe we're backlin and maybe we're weary but there's overcoming power there's a law of restoration for us amen hallelujah hallelujah see I thought that was a great illustration we say we're addicted or we're saying We Can't Stop but think about it you probably can now I know everybody here I'll say like this I know you can because you're real saints I know you you all are just not uh brother said you're not fresh recruits into the war of Christianity you ain't some fresh ones well well you just started the battle last week you're just learning how to fight you all know how to fight I'm not preaching in to babies Hallelujah neither is a baby preaching I know how to fight I know how to overcome but sometimes we just got to change our perspective Hallelujah we just need a mind that's transformed hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God and remember the Bible says we should have total sanctification in other words we should always strive to live a separate sanctification means a separated cleaned out life that's in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 actually I'll read 5:22 abstain from all appearance of evil and that's what those weekend meetings do right they take up almost all of our time so we got to get our mind back on God I like that about the weekend meetings like that when we went to Brother cams in April I love that because it was just I was with my f my mother the whole time you know I was with I saw my dad I saw Mike mski I didn't have time to waste on the on the computer right I didn't have time to waste on my cell phone and with politics or news or anything it was just all Jesus all Jesus that's a great weekend praise God this this weekend was a great weekend praise God I like that when we can just give all of our time to God but the Bible say abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you partly no sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole Spirit now that's your whole mind right your whole soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and like this faithful are the Believers no Faithful Is He that called you who also do it praise God Amen don't forget Philippians 1:6 he that began a good work in you is faithful to complete it praise God like the Bible said he's going to keep you from falling Hallelujah he's going to keep you Sanctified he's going to keep you from evil just do your part just keep drawing n to God keep confessing sin keep serving God and God will sanctify you holy hallelujah amen I love what Paul says in Romans 717 he said now then it is no more I that do the sin but sin that dwell Within Me so on those days we get discouraged remember it wasn't really me that sinned the real me wouldn't do that hallelujah it's the sinful nature in me that does it but not the real me Hallelujah Verse 18 for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not in my flesh for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth Within Me praise God I am not sin the real me is not a sinner the real me never sinned to begin with praise God Amen is that right the Bible says he that's born of God does not commit sin 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he's born of God that's why brother R said it's as if though you never did in the first place think about that when you get a new body you the sin is gone so it's going to be as if you never did it praise God you don't have the sin nature anymore you got a brand new glorified body hallelujah amen but you'll still remember your sin that you sin right because the Bible say you'll sing about the Redemption of the Lamb right the Saints in the in the in the Book of Revelation they sing uh Worthy is the Lamb who has redeemed us unto God out of every Kindred Nation tribe and tongue and people hallelujah amen so we have a body free from sin but our mind still remembers we did sin but I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah remember the Bible said we're to give all diligence 2 Corinthians 8:7 it says therefore as you abound in everything in faith so see we should be growing in faith in utterance speaking the word and knowledge understanding and all diligence diligence is earnestness to accomplish something see Earnest to get to work Earnest to do something for God Earnest to invest in what God's placed in your life Hallelujah and in your love to us see that you abound abound in this Grace also of course that's the grace of giving charitably to people that are poor and then second Peter 1: 15 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith my friend virtue and to Virtue knowledge Hallelujah so there's virtue again see giving all of your earnestness giving all of your motivation right give all your moot be motivated to add to your to let God add to your character amen how do you let how do you do that just open up and receive more of the word of God am fill your mind with the things of God right brother said it's like an animal eating right animals what do they do you ever watch our chickens what they just want to eat all day right they start off these little tiny peepers you keep feeding them no now they're pretty big by God's grace that's all they do is eat all day brother said that's what you are he said we the Bible calls us we'll be like Calves in the stall we will feed and feed and feed on the word that's what we got to do keep feeding and feeding on the word Malachi eats amen just eat like that guy but eat spiritual Hallelujah right keep eating keep enjoying the word keep saying amen keep feeding yourself keep meditating on the things of God and God will bless you Hallelujah that's how you'll grow keep eating on the word of God all right now that's just foundational that's maybe five minutes or 10 minutes on foundational things now um while you're uh turning there go to Hebrews 10 chapter I'm sorry Hebrews 10 Hebrews chapter 10 sorry verse one I'm going to read a quote from brother Brandon so I'm I'm really shortening this for time's sake because it's it's not necessarily a super deep thing but I want you to see how brother brandom answers this question he preached it mostly in the 1950s he would say Jesus asked you to be perfect how can I do it think about that you ever did you ever think that when you read that verse how am I going to be perfect like God maybe if I work really hard you know May if I get really legalistic I could be perfect of course Jesus doesn't want us to be legalistic right he doesn't want to we're not supposed to add to the word of God legalism is adding to the word of God but you know I'm sure we've all read that and said well how can I be perfect Lord I'm trying I'm doing my best that's all God wants is your best Hallelujah and he's not asking for sinless Perfection he's asking for maturity he's asking for you and I to be able to give kindness when people don't deserve it he's asking us to have a level of love and compassion that Sinners don't have in other words he's asking us to be what we're called to be Christians all right so Hebrews 101 now while you're there I'm going to read this he says now what this is from uh the law having a shadow 1954 what's the subject Paul's speaking of here Perfection he said God requires Perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says no one is perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then the scripture says None is perfect we've all sin and come short of the glory of God read that tonight how we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he uh requires Perfection isn't that a good question Heaven requires Perfection right Jesus said believe in me and The Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of a person a Perfection Hallelujah so brother R said he he kind of dramatizes it and then brother raham goes to the Old Testament brother Ram would dramatize it like this I'm just going to paraphrase it brother Braham said the Old Testament sinner he would come he would bring his lamb or his bulock or whatever he had he would bring that he would offer it uh he would you know the Bible said he'd lay his hands on the sacrifice the sins would transfer from The Sinner to the sacrifice they'd cut the throat of the animal let's say it's a bu and then the bulock would shed its blood and then they they give they cut it in pieces if it was a peace offering sin offering I preached on that a few years ago you know each offering had a purpose the Bible said The Sinner here The Sinner his sins went on the sacrifice the sacrifice died and now God said now The Sinner Is Forgiven but brother said then the but the sinner although he's forgiven he would leave with the same desires right because the blood of bulls and goats could never take away the the conscience of sin okay so they'd be forgiven or their sins would be covered over forgiven but the sinner would leave there still defiled right in his mind knowing I'm going to go back there but church we don't have to go back all the time hallelujah amen we don't have to go back Hallelujah I've never gone back to smoking Hallelujah never gone back to drinking Hallelujah never gone back to a lot of awful things why because we have a different sacrifice now we have an all sufficient sacrifice hallelujah amen hallelujah in church in other words we'll never go back to the major sins yes we'll have minor sins we'll be tempted tried tested sometimes for life like brother man was tested by that critical prideful Spirit almost his entire life but he finally got victory over it praise God when he got a new body Hallelujah now Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once Pur should have had no more conscience of sin hallelujah look at verse three but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year now church I have found this honest to God in my life there are so many sins I even forgot I did think about that first for a moment I'll go out to a restaurant and I'll hear a song like oh yeah I used to rock to that song and do a lot of evil things with that song but I forgotten about it the blood of Jesus Christ had taken away the remembrance of that hallelujah praise God hallelujah that was impossible under the blood of bulls and goats but with the blood of Jesus Christ now it's as if we get a fresh start we be we get a new life amen hallelujah and I'll say like this the longer we serve God the further those things will feel away praise God hallelujah they'll really feel like they're separated as far as the East is from the West praise [Applause] God it's happened numerous time you know uh these last few weeks you know uh we go to different restaurants and heard these songs and my wife are like oh that's right I remember that song you know bring back certain memories I'm like wow and then my brother was telling me some things where we were with my brother and I was like wow I for forgot I even did that I thought I forgot that ever happened I thought wow that was the blood of Jesus Christ right because we were before we're chained to those things but Jesus is the chain breaker Hallelujah he breaks all those chains and then there can be a forgetfulness of sin praise God not a remembrance of sin but a forgetfulness of sin Hallelujah I see I'll say like this you've heard it before probably right but if God can forget about our past sins why can't we the the fact is we can amen hallelujah just keep applying the blood keep drawing closer to God see the closer you get to God the further those things get away from you that's what the purpose of the blood of Christ was to make us forget about our old sin to separate us from our sin and make us new creatures in Christ Jesus Hallelujah now skip down to verse 10 now it goes through the animal sacrifices but in verse 10 he says by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all one sacrifice did all the sanctifying amen one death did all the cleaning out praise God not every year we got to come back now see that's what we got to make sure we don't got to make sure I just have Revival every time we have Revival Services we can have Revival every time Hallelujah we can have Revival anytime we want it praise God Hallelujah we don't it just see we can't make an attrition well we can only have Revival next summer it can't be like that we can have Revival any time we want praise God it takes a repentance of sin it takes a drawing night to God remember the three things brother said we must have these things to be on fire for God a fervent desire to please him a passion to know his word and a reaching out in the spirit praise God hallelujah so we see it now brother ad says he says how can you be perfect he said oh let's get it and then he reads down to Hebrews 10:14 everybody's everybody should be really staring down there hold up so you want to hear that you want to see the Revelation brother R used this is in the laws of shadow of good things to come 1954 brother says oh let's get it let's see what is your Perfection glory for by one offering he hath perfected forever bride of Christ Fellowship that are Sanctified Hallelujah let's apply to your life amen Hallelujah that's what he's done the blood perfects us as far as forgives all of our sins it say like this the spirit of the blood matures us amen the spirit doesn't make us babies and immature the spirit makes us real men and women who are mature in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen that love our enemies will be good to those that despitefully use us will bless those who curse us that's what the spirit of Christ that's what Jesus is saying be perfect be mature sure I want you to know there is a different meaning for Perfection and that is all sins are forgiven so I say like this I'm both Perfection you are both uh definitions of perfection you're perfect because you have no more sin and you're perfectly mature hallelujah hallelujah you got both definitions both are for you if you're trusting in Jesus Christ brother this is the answer to that question how can I be perfect God requires Perfection to get to heaven this is how I can be perfect I get Jesus's Perfection Hallelujah he took my sin that I might get his Perfection Hallelujah am amen he said that's the only way anybody gets to Heaven hallelujah it's through the Perfection of Jesus Christ Our Lord how many glad you're perfect tonight oh thank God now there's get your Bibles there's 17 other I'm sorry there's 16 other verses that use this Greek word perfect which means we have to have a full age we got to be fully developed Christians right so let's go through these so you can see how this word is used it doesn't mean I've I don't sin today now you you want to try not to sin today you want to try to make it out of the service without sinning by God's grace right help us Jesus Hallelujah but that's not what Jesus is saying he we know the scriptures says we're already Perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ in other words all of our sins there's no record in heaven remember the Bible said they're nailed to the cross of Jesus Hallelujah remember Colossians 2 that's one of my favorite chapters Hallelujah they're already nailed the the the the all the sins were already nailed to the cross Jesus already triumphs over all the sins remember the Bible said Satan would not have crucified Jesus if he known what it would have produce what it produce it prod It produced perfect Christians amen hallelujah It produced Christians that he can't bring an accusation against Hallelujah because it's under the blood hallelujah amen he would not have done that and not only that now we get eternal life Hallelujah and now we get power to drive him out hallelujah oh he would not have done that right because it divide up the Holy Spirit into 120 licks of fire praise God and put that same anointing that was on Jesus upon us and church it's on us tonight hallelujah amen how do you know because you're walking after the spirit not after the flesh right you didn't come here to get a million dollars that would have been walking after the flesh you didn't come here for any sinful purpose you came here because you love Jesus amen you're walking after the spirit that proves you're led by the spirit Hallelujah that's what brother Ram uses that's the quotes I got all these quotes on here I could read but I'll say with the scripture just for now and get to a few quotes at the end I'm almost done it's almost 8 o'clock by God's grace that's pre is learning a little lesson this preacher is fully developing on how to be uh not so long winded on a Wednesday night when everybody's got to work and everything like that there's a time for long winded Services there's certainly time for that uh the first one's Matthew 19:20 this so Cas I'm going to need you to be super fast here the Rich Young Ruler Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler to be perfect but he wasn't saying never sin he was saying be more mature you kept some some Commandments but you need to sell everything you need be mature and not think money is your way to get to heaven you have to understand money is not going to make your life successful it's did you obey Christ yeah with your money but also with every in his case a preaching gift he neglected his preaching gift okay the young man said to him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet look brother said look he knew he lacked Jesus said to him if thou will be perfect so if you'll be more mature go and sell that thou Hast and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in and come and follow me he loved his riches more than he loved his call to preach right and Jesus said if you want to be mature you got to sell all that you got to follow me of course we know he he went Jesus Jesus rebuked him and he went away sorrowful but Jesus even loved him the Bible said another place Jesus loved this man and that will help you church when that voice told Brother brandom All That You Ever Loved is here in heaven we got to care be careful how we interpret that because Jesus loved this rich man and then brother BR said this rich man was in hell so even that's right even Jesus loved a man and that man couldn't get to he couldn't get to heaven so we got to be careful how we interpret brother man's Visions I know you're good with that I I just want to share that a fresh if you haven't heard that lately all right Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and what perfect will of God so this is the definition the highest virtue and integrity virtue that's what this means prove the highest level of Integrity on the will of God prove that right prove that this is God's will for you this is God's uh level of virtue for you this is God's level of uh Integrity prove that's the will of God the perfect will of God okay see so I hope that helps there by God's grace next one um First Corinthians Ians 2:6 I like this one how be it we speak wisdom of among them that are perfect that doesn't mean they never sinned now this one means mature yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory and what was all the wisdom in here it was the preaching on communion preaching on hair it was preaching on the gifts of the Spirit tongues that was the wisdom of God that we speak in a mystery praise God hallelujah so see we can only speak the word of God to them that are mature right Hallelujah now now remember when remember when we went to akan uh the First Baptist church I preached a deeper Doctrine right and what what the pastor say I'm walking on clouds he said said that's the wisdom of God most churches would not accept that preaching it's a good thing he's not really he didn't go to Seminary Paul didn't did you know that that's why I like to go preach for him he didn't go to cemetery right so that's why I can preach I can preach a and the baptism of Holy Ghost is a mystery the Bible says I can go in there and preach I can preach the mystery to them that are perfect Hallelujah then that are mature and the mature ones will catch it in other words they'll go for more the Holy Ghost I don't know how many Baptists were mature there but I know we are Hallelujah see that preach those deeper things of God that's the wisdom of God we speak in a mystery but I'm sure a lot of those people Church don't you think a lot of those people just went right over their head well what's he talking about the mind the body the what's he what's he putting those crazy licks of fire those paper licks of fire on him like that why is he doing that that's so silly but it's a truth all right now it go to 1 Corinthians 13 uh verse verse um 8 now this is a greatly misunderstood scripture among message people because they asked brother brandom in 1964 does does this apply to his ministry and he said yes now that's the only quote on this and I'll explain it what I mean here charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish vanish away for we know in part and we Pro phes in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with now stop right there message people will say see we have the perfect Revelation so we don't need gifts anymore and that's a lie see they misinterpret this quote or this scripture see when that which is perfect is come now here perfect has the meaning of when we see Jesus face to face so look at the next verse when I was a child spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child when I became a man I put away childish things so Paul's saying there is going to come a day we'll put away the gifts but that day is not today amen hallelujah verse 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly so see we prophesy we dream dreams we we have gifts and we pretty sure they're right right but then we'll be face to face with Jesus now I know Paul says I know in part he wrote most of the New Testament and he says I know part of the thing I know part of it but then shall I know even also as I am known okay so this is speaking of when that which is perfect is come when the glorified bodies come then we'll see Jesus face to face and then we know won't need gifts anymore because our body all the sin will be gone Hallelujah we'll have perfect bodies we'll be a perfect being we'll be without sin Hallelujah but some people will say well see brother braham's messag has come brother braham's message is perfect so we don't need gifts anymore that's a Lie from Hell brother said in the church age book the gifts remain until Jesus comes back Hallelujah and we're still waiting on Jesus how many still looking for Jesus hallelujah hallelujah uh go to 1 Corinthians 14:20 Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men now that word men is the word perfect that Jesus used be ye therefore mature so Paul says he says in understanding be mature right understand the Bible Hallelujah all right next Ephesians 4 uh verse 11 of course is the fivefold ministry Ephesians 4:12 the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the saints that doesn't mean they never sin it means they're mature so being around five-fold Ministry preachers real five-fold Ministry preachers if you believe what they say you'll become more mature as a Christian how many can say Amen to that Hallelujah some of you wrote me letters the Pastor bation said you've learned so much much to the preaching I said praise God hallelujah that proves it right there the real preaching in the fivefold ministry makes you more mature makes you closer to God hallelujah that's exactly right and actually if you go down to verse 15 in case well I guess 13 to we all come in the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man see it doesn't mean now I'm sinless it means I'm a mature person unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so there's a certain measure of Christ's character that you can attain think about that Jesus got slapped on the face there's a certain measure that you could attain to that someone might slap you someone might hurt you we don't know someone might spit on you and you could stand there and love them right brother Brooks told this story I don't know if you remember back in April I don't know if you remember this sister Zur sister who or sister Naomi brother Brooks said he was at an ATM and but brother Brooks is a black man and he said this white man walked up and started cussing him out blankety blankety blank like you've been at the ATM too long I'm trying to get my money out and brother brother Brook said the anointing of the Holy Ghost come over him and this guy probably started using some racist language and brother Brook said I looked at the man and I felt sorry for him and I loved him and he said oh I'm sorry sir I'll try to move on as fast as I can now can you imagine that now how many of us would say let me tell you something I want to tell you talk to me like that brother Brook said the Holy Ghost he said It felt come down the anointing and he said I I'm sorry I'll try to go on as fast as I can Church said that's maturity right there now it's brother brother Brook's perfect no well he's Perfect by the blood let me get that in there he's Perfect by the blood but he's not sinless Perfection right every day he's maturing though and the Saints said so are you so are you Hallelujah and now look at verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may you what now here it is growing up see we're supposed to be mature Christians be therefore perfect be mature grow up into Christ in all things who's the head even Christ grow up into Christ be more like Christ there's more areas of Our Lives where we can be more like Jesus Philippians 3 Paul says forgetting those things 313 forgetting those things which are behind we're going to coming up on the New Year pretty soon I'll probably use this scripture right brother brother used scripture forgetting those things of 2023 and reaching forth under those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm going to forget this any mistakes from last year and I'm going to press on and I'm going to try to win the prize Hallelujah next verse 15 let us therefore as many as be mature that doesn't mean I never made a mistake last year he actually just said forget your past sins right he just said forget the past right and the blood of Christ will help you do that hallelujah amen you have you have a you you don't remember the sins right the sins are under the blood all you think about is the goodness of God hallelujah amen think about that went through four Services we never saying the goodness of God wow that's quite an accomplishment there every church I hear things I'm like oh hear it again there it is again there's again God is good though hallelujah amen but see as many as are mature be thus minded that if anything be otherwise minded God shall reveal this even to you anything you need to know God will reveal it to you praise God Amen I like that uh in uh Colossians 1: 27- 28 in verse 27 Paul says Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost verse 28 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that ye may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus again Paul wants us to present people mature I like that both Jim and brother Cam said it's easy to preach to your church brother Jesse I said Hallelujah can I get a high five sister you're right can I get a high five Jim said I didn't feel any resistance while preaching that's why he looked like a 20-y old guy I mean 42 and then brother brother Cam said the same you saw him Jump Around Here cam cam sweating and everything he didn't feel any hindrances and then they they loved the worship as well see church maybe you don't know it but maybe I'm just let you know you're a mature church we don't have these sins and problems like these other churches Thank God now we got we got we're not perfect but let me say this we're growing up into Christ into all things praise God remember brother dig says the same thing I go to all these churches they just want the choir to sing but I come to your church and you want to worship the church wants to worship it's easy to preach to you you're not you're not grieving the Holy Spirit say no we don't want I don't really want to be here you want to be here you love the word of God you're feeding on God's word God is with you you're mature Church hallelujah amen Paul wanted to to present every man perfect mature in Christ Jesus Colossians 4:12 epis one day maybe there'll be a boy named epis around here who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect mature and complete in all the will of God remember that's a great prayer to pray if you want to pray for somebody pray that they'll be in the perfect will of God that's a real sincere this is a holy ghost filled man epif he started the church in colassa remember he started the church well no wonder he wanted them to be in the perfect will of God right he wanted them mature he like the Bible said you don't want to be a baby tossed around by every wind of Doctrine right like for example like with Divine Healing somebody could toss you around you could toss on this side just speak it just speak it you speak it for a while it doesn't work then you get tossed around just get anointed with oil and every every time you get anointed with oil you're just tossed back and forth which one do you go which one do you go the thing is get a revelation first get a revelation what is the will of God hallelujah see that see see I mean that's just one example now we all we all gone through that and it's normal to go through but as we mature we realize brother BR said the first thing is find the will of God and all these preachers you know have have missed uh have missed the will of God call they call themselves the greatest of all time the most powerful men of all time and they never do the first thing so if they're wrong on the first thing about Divine Healing what else are they wrong on if they can't get to the first base on Divine Healing to find the perfect will of God or to find the will of God or seek the will of God what are they missing on other things well they're missing a lot of things right especially with pride and so forth like that but see we don't want to be tossed we don't want to be children we want to be mature we want to grow up in the word of God hallelujah all right almost 8 o'clock my goodness this might have to be a part two next Wednesday here we see how work help me Jesus help me help me Lord yeah I didn't really get to any of the quotes So maybe I'll preach a part two um but I just wanted you to see these these are the same uh uses of the word perfect in 16 other verses Jesus is not saying you got to be perfect why aren't you perfect today M okay be like your heavenly father not your Earthly father lyia why'd you do that today you weren't perfect today that's not what he's saying saying be mature M and you know what a mature person does when they sin they say God forgive me that's my mature and God help me not to do that again help me by your grace that's what a mature person does right they confess their sins and then who's faithful Christ is faithful to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so spiritual maturity is perfection according to the Bible isn't that interesting that's the word Jesus chose he could have used you know pristine or he could have used beautiful tremendous or Masterpiece he could use any of these words but he says be perfect be mature in other words have everything you need get ready so you don't you're not lacking anything when somebody mistreat you be ready to have some love some kindness to repay their evil with good we don't overcome evil with evil We Come O we overcome evil with good that's a perfect Christian that's a mature Christian I'll close with this one here it's already 8:00 uh first John 4:17 I want everybody to read this the last verse I promise unless the Lord leads me somewh first John 47 it's been really easy to preach you tonight because everybody's polling tonight by God's grace I haven't felt any resistance the Revival is still long hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory amen I felt no resistance now this will hopefully help us here here in is our love made it's not it's not saying well I love God all the time I never sin it's just mature here's how our love is made mature that we may have boldness in the day of judgment it's not because well I didn't sin the last year of my life now I'm ready for the Judgment no that's impossible because as he is so are we in this world wow what a statement Amen in other words God's looking at us through the blood of Jesus Christ right he looks through red the red blood of Jesus and sees us in our white robes the blood of Christ Verse 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear now doesn't this give a new understanding of the scripture perfect love doesn't mean well I I loved everybody perfect today because surely you didn't right if you're honest with yourself you mean you gave money to every poor person you passed on the way here you mean you gave a smile to everyone who got mad at you on the drive here all day every day this whole day so it doesn't mean perfect love like oh I was perfect all day now I can cast out fear it means mature love will look at the situation and say yes my in my sin I feel fear but I can cast that out amen because I've got a greater one that's in me than he that's in the world Hallelujah right we talked about this before a wave of fear goes over over us every time we get those Amber Alerts like or tornado oh Lord have mercy right it's natural fear just rushes over you but if you have a mature love amen pretty soon you'll say ah I can't worry about this I got to pray about this Hallelujah and that's perfect mature love will eventually cast out that fear Hallelujah and that's why we said House of Hell spirit of fear give way to the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you you can hold you know those people in the Bible they had sicknesses for 18 years blood issue for 18 years all these things see had held them for a while but eventually perfect love mature love cast out all the fear Hallelujah and they said House of Hell give way I'm touching Jesus's garment and the Bible said as soon as she did the blood dried up in her and she got her healing and cast out all fear Hallelujah am she have to worry anymore I'm out of money I can't afford medicine Jesus was her medicine hallelujah amen and that perfect mature Love by Revelation right that was a revelation the perfect re the revelation of that gave her perfect peace right we say per mature mature Faith to cast out all the fear because you you know what because fear has torment Jesus doesn't call us to live in torment of fear or torment of anything guilt right greed and bitterness Jesus doesn't call us to live in that we can cast that out the window Hallelujah we can cast it out in Jesus name he that fearth is not made mature in love see in other words if we constantly live in fear we're fearful all the day long fearful about everything right if we're just fearful all the time that person person's not maturing in love but as we mature God is helping us to overcome all of our fears how many can say Amen to that amen let's stand to our feet musicians can come I went a little over 8 o'clock I'm at 8:04 now so please don't hold against me I trust you enjoyed that last verse there by God's grace now why did I preach that because brother Ram said this in 1960 thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you to that place thus sayith the lord well that that's the scripture perfect love mature love has has to cast out all fear brother Bram said because that's all was there brother BR went beyond the curtain of time remember all the women ran to him first and that interesting all the women ran to him he was called a woman hater and all the women came first we love you brother they said we would not have been here unless you come and preach and then the brothers came next ladies first brother said I didn't feel any of those feelings hugging all those because all those uh hormones were gone all those feelings were gone brother gets back from that he says oh I don't want to leave this place but the voice said you've got to go back you got to finish you got to preach the Seven Seals got to preach marriage and divorce Hallelujah got to preach all these Revelations and he he says he says thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there that's all that was there it'll take perfect love so whatever you do right of Christ Fellowship whatever you do after this revival you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you and the church said Hallelujah that's what Jesus was talking about bless those who curse you love those who hate you do good to those who despitefully use you brother Ram said it lay everything aside remember just a couple weeks ago I preached on lay aside the sin that does so easily the sin lay aside anything that's making us not grow closer to Christ lay it aside and get that mature love that doesn't that help even with that quote doesn't that help it doesn't mean I never uh I I never sin today it just means I've got mature love right I'm just mature now and now I can be good to those who are evil to me Hallelujah lay aside everything brother Bram says so you can have perfect love and church perfect love isn't always smileing like I love you I love you even though you cursed me I love you Jesus got the ropes out right whipped him out then other times Jesus looked at the Pharisees in Anger sometimes perfect love looks a little angry right it just depends on the situation so let's not get this you know this this false picture in our mind it's always smiling it's always easy oh I'll have perfect love when everything's going good for me that's not Jesus rarely had everything going good for him constantly accused constantly uh badgered brother used the word badgered he was always badgered by the Pharisees and religious people especially at the end of his ministry but yet he had perfect love why because he had mature love he was able to overcome all the all the haters against him he was able to say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing how many would say they'd like perfect love here tonight by God's grace I would say that and church let me tell you in one way you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ all your sins are paid for I think I'm going to preach out on Sunday I'm going to show them those scriptures you are unblamable the Bible says Satan cannot blame you you are unreprovable Satan can't rebuke you all your sins all your trespasses you are forgiven I think I'm going to bring this in there you're already perfect in the mind of God in heaven you're perfect sinless but here on Earth we are maturing and we're confessing our sin and brother man says as long as we're walking in the spirit he says then we're we're doing what we must do to become mature we're walking in the spirit not walking in the flesh let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer before I pray brother Ram said how can you be perfect not in yourself but in him Hallelujah in Christ I'm Perfect Sisters there in Christ I am not me though not the sin I hate the sin sister who I hate the sin that's within me but in Christ I'm perfect it's so are you now you're perfect in Christ not of yourself I can't be perfect in myself but I'm perfect in the perfect one because I'm part of Christ I'm an attribute I'm a thought of God I was chosen in the mind of Christ before the foundation how do I know because I've accepted his word today that's how I know brother Bram said that's how you know that's brother Braham in the in the Seven Seals how do you know your Lamb's on your names on the Lamb's Book of Life he said because as soon as you hear that word you want to obey it that's how I know my name's over there as soon as brother Jim preaches that as soon as cam preaches that I want that I want to recognize God in the present I Want To Praise His Name with dancing amen hallelujah oh sorry Hallelujah I want the law of restoration I want God to restore anything I've lost I want God to restore back praise God sorry he up my wisdom let's pray father God we thank you for today Lord God Lord God thank you for these great thoughts from the scripture and from your quotes from your Prophet Lord God he said oh let's get it Hebrews 10:14 by one sacrifice he hath forever perfected them that are Sanctified we're so grateful Lord each one of us can lift our hands and or bow our heads and say thank you Jesus we're perfect in heaven we're without sin and here on Earth we are being matured or perfected through the growing process of feeding on your word confessing our sins daily and Lord being good to those who are not good to us blessing those who curse us I think of that song I follow Jesus hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Lord the next time someone tries to cuss me out Lord God the next time someone gives me the the wrong finger in the car help me Lord God to have mercy and compassion on them help me to love those who are unlovable forgive me Lord if I'm not driving the right way also dear God Lord that's the time I can think when people get mad at me Lord if people on the job or children get mad at me or teachers or

God I want to grow I want to be closer to you Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus and Lord when fear comes on Hallelujah May perfect love may mature love cast out fear for Lord no doubt it comes on me
