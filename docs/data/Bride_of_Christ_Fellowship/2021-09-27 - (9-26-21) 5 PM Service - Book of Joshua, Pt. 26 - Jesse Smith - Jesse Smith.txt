========================================

praise god is this is one of the few that are actually spoken of great blessings a lot of people call the blessings a couple um happens shall praise my father's children shall bow down before the father that's that word you're the king that's in the room tonight lord thank you jesus we just ask god as the holy spirit has been felt around this place lord you've anointed me god to preach your word uh the people to receive them all we all need you or they're going to need to receive it as well but all of us will be what a coordinator tonight that's a humble little gathering but yeah we're so grateful to be in the house of the lord the great deployment people and all the efforts that can make weekends jesus christ spelled out prophetically it's just another great testimony around the holy spirit where in this case we're looking at judah if it was this prophecy some of these prophecies didn't have the past for 640 years imagine we won't even wait about 57 years 56 years since our property went off the scene it was 640 years until this prophecy of jacob came to pass so it really shows how the holy spirit is prophetic and holy spirit is very detailed too all about judah and all about each other and uh again i just want to show this like this is a quote we have to balance right because brother adam says the heart is burned each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to their children she spoke the very place in your labor of where they would be positioned in the prophecy this the thought is beautiful right in other words there's prophecy about where the boys would end up but some of the details go around with just guessing maybe he had confused with other things he said oh it's a great study we only go in the details we take hours after hours someday when we get our church fix i decided to come and take a solid month or two and stay right in so as we looked at the bible church the last few services there wasn't the mothers placing them it was the father or moses the prophet again look at that tonight by the grace of the lord okay so i went through uh and showed these here it seems like just two of them are the prophecies for told about specific places in the land again some is one of the two that specifically told about the land it said zebulun would live at that pavement in the bible uh but it specifically says he's going to live by the sea of canaan of the sea and then it mentions the mountains he's gonna have a pleasant land and mentioned the mountain which one is ion not sure which one that's referring to but it kind of mentions land right asher mentions bread and yellow but again no land it does mention bread joseph had mentioned land mountains and hills that could be a lot of different places but just so you know it does mention that and then gad mentions he gets a portion of the law giver he was seated amongst that so does this possibly in judah's land actually say that without having enough yet death tally is definitely a second one now this is quite mysterious he says downtown possesses the west and the south yeah i think i have a picture but i have the picture where um natalie is up at the north and he's doesn't really look like the south oregon maybe it means like west and south or some other location so it's just a little bit mysterious to defend some of these prophecies in the bible and kill the spirits and then asher says it mentioned he had a split with oil but doesn't say where so i just i'll just show you out of the ones i've read out of jacob and moses it looks like only two give specific definitions about the land okay roman said all the mothers told them where they'd be in their land okay all right so these are the ones they don't these these have nothing said about them remember we read rumen this morning don't say anything about reuben's land doesn't doesn't say anything about simeon other than he'd be divided from levi levi gets no land he only got cities right this portion was the lord judah as we write as a reader tonight i'll show you it doesn't say anything about his land it's all prophetic about christ and david okay benjamin doesn't mention details about his land or dan okay so that's six of them right so that just gives you an idea so we're trying to balance this out by the word of god yes it is a beautiful thought but the prophecy is more to deal with like their future interactions with each other not so much the land there's like right places okay let's look at judah and uh um so judah the first scripture genesis 29 35. his name needs to be praised because his mother praised the lord that she was given another son they did say anything about the land right i'm saying that critically i'm just saying that a matter of fact they said we could rightly divide the world but let's read his past this is a beautiful long prophecy that was our text okay we only read verse 8 john 3 9 10 11 9 after it says you have the neck of thy enemies and the father's children will bow down before judah is a lion's wealth from the my son now are gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as an old man who shall rouse them up so it kind of sits like a lion who's kind of in his comfortable position right dude is like this comfortable line so strong but yet he's just nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh comes so judah's been a rule but he wasn't the firstborn reuben was the firstborn right the scepter shall not depart from judah verse 10 nor a law giver from between the speech so all the law givers then they're going to come out as you this is spoken 640 years before david he's the first lawgiver this is all speaking of prophetic david's coming and then he's out today praise god all right uh next finish and unto him shall the gathering of the people be so everybody would gather unto jesus and of course christ verse 11. now here's the strength this is the strange i don't understand i need his skull onto the vine i'll try binding his hole into the diving hide his donkey to your body and his asses coal unto the choice vine he washes garments in line and is okay so did anybody say anything about land in there and same thing about we'll see ruling and then some food and supply okay all right so let's go to moses that was jacob let's go to moses prophecy in deuteronomy 37. so moses just put one person here about you and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear o lord the voice of jesus bring him unto his people and his hands be sufficient for him to be thou of help to him from his enemies this is speaking of god delivering the kings of judah remember there was no good kings out of samaria remember after solomon they broke into two halves right northern and then right this is speaking of the god being with judah because they had some godly kings right josiah okay so just one verse from uh moses about judah now the result we'll look at this in the next slide but nothing said about the land yet he possessed over a third of it out of all the land judah had a third of it this is how great jesus is going to be in the eyes of god this man and then of course the tribe of jesus okay so now program says but go back and judo whatever judah means that his position placed among the children of israel so i'm not sure about that quote because his name means to be friends right so that doesn't really speak up position naturally but it speaks of a theme right the kingship and here's where i mentioned this this morning remember we must always look in the bible if there's a question but there's really no questions for us about acts 23 so i found with this study i had to look in the bible more often because i'm not very familiar with some of these things okay so let's go back to judah who was jewish leader one of his leaders was caleb he holy followed the lord he was a man said give me my mountain i'll take on the giants this is where jesus came out praise god this is where david came out of praise god the tribe of judah he was one of the spies he marched and no yeah he was and he had alliance pictures he was the one that held the the banner of the line remember there was four there was four beasts right or for uh banners and they each had a symbol and this was the lion symbol it talks about again kingdoms ministry the inheritance was first fully one-third of the whole country of jordan about 2300 square miles within a second distribution when simeon received a lot in it about a thousand miles of the portion of judah and joshua 19. and that was meant remain in judah it was still a very large portion of the church okay so he gave up something right you saw that i was saying like mostly he prophesied because he was already right now i just i just want to show this i'm not going to read through all this but judah had undone pasture ground between the hills and the desert this became my favorite camping guide of the old patriarchs in other words hebron remember abraham abraham he didn't have rash you know so there was good pasture ground there also there was valleys and lowlands and this was like a garden right and this was like the drainage ice they had a place in the desert they also had a place for pastures and a place for a garden it had so much land and so many resources and then a hill country here an elevated plateau stretching from hebron to jerusalem uh look at that look at all these resources they had corn wine oil and fruit i think look at this how come simeon didn't get that because he wasn't gonna be faithful how come reuben didn't get that he wasn't gonna be faithful so look god already had the blessing set up for you and i thank you amen praise god how can we get the blessing sometimes why do we give blessings other people don't because god is rewarding his people look at that they get awful they get this beautiful land of blessings because god knew they were going to be a faithful tribe amen i knew there was going to be a daily coming out of there there's already a payload can come out of there so god could bless remember caleb's son-in-law he was a mighty man of faith he was the first judge so this is gonna be a tribe full of men that had faith in the word of god that god was gonna bless them with some rich corn wine oil fruit they had daring shepherds that led their flocks far over the neighboring plains and through the mountains the florida city this is a beautiful place it didn't have some barren ground but it was good still for the sheep and the goats to pasture and also there'd be wide animals there like leopards bears goats outlaws so jude is like a huge place that has all kinds of different land but it's exactly what they needed to meet the needs of the people right they have all these dresses the greenery right oil wine fruit everything so it means to be praised the word judah means to be praised the messiah and all the kings would come out of this tribe all the good kings david was from this tribe a man after the heart of god was from this drive praise god now notice judah received the promise in shiloh i'm sorry that shiloh would come but shiloh means a place of rest that had to be christ but christ said i come to give you rest okay we'll look forward to that in just a little bit here in judah was ruler of the family also shown in praise and his brothers would bow down before remember that as in verse eight his brothers were bowed down before 49 verse 8. yeah that's right my father's children shall bow down before thee so this shows where reuben lost uh he lost the blessing of the family because he slept with his father's servant and so because of that he's unstable as water and it's as if as if jacob and the holy spirit said i'm not giving it to the firstborn i'm giving it to judah judah as a faithful son inherits all these blessings he was the only one waiting to see joseph brother that guy got all many many blessings why because he was faithful who was like joseph the bible said it was almost a perfect name right he's only just said lie a little bit about the shepherds one time but look how he's faithful to prison he was faithful at his father's house faithful part of his eyes he's faithful to pharaoh this was just a faithful man you can trust him with everything right you trust him with your wife right right he was a good apart of his wife you can trust this guy with anything he wouldn't dishonor god he was always honoring god praise god and so god if you lift you read these i heard the preacher said judah and joseph get exalted as two of the most prominent sons of the whole family and out of judah of damon and also jesus christ that's a testimony what a testimony that jesus christ comes out of the tribe of judah amen so here judah takes the leadership from reuben the firstborn due to his sin reuben sin david took the scepter that's what we read there the bible said you have the scepter in verse 10 yes the bible said the scepter would come to him but he had to wait 640 years to get this scepter and all the good things came out of judah remember there was none that come out of northern part samaria let me just add this too did you realize that after after they broke up in the northern and southern did you realize all the tribes were called judah right but judah just because all the good kings came out of judah all those all those tribes that had land underneath the northern part they just all called him judah because that was such a good name and that's why that's where we get the name jews from you know the word jew comes from judah because judah became such a prominent uh tribe and it ruled all the others so well that they just started calling all israelites jews because they came because they were led by judah so their name becomes the name of god just like the lord jesus christ becomes the name of the bride amen there it is right now right now see like all jews are known by judah because he's the one that's losing praise his tribe was one of the greatest tribes the brothers bowed down the scepter was giving him all the kings came out of all the good people it's tremendous like god raised up judah right reuben falls sidney falls levi rises judah rises that's how our lives are right you know i hope all of our brothers and sisters get saved but if not church we're the ones rising praise god by the grace of god by the grace of god we want all the rights right i want all the rights but we're not guaranteed that we couldn't pray for it we could hope for it we can ask for it we should not we should ask for it we do ask for it but by god's grace we're gonna be the ones arise because we're in the house of the lord we love jesus jesus is in our homes amen see so that's this is this is where i love the the part about god's poor god god knows which of the sons are going to raise so he prepares blessings for them amen that's what we are church we are the ones that are going to raise by the grace of god now this is beautiful too jacob when he's prophesied here in genesis 49 he actually gives this is a prophecy of the messiah but it's not the first prophecy the first prophecy was genesis 3 15 right the serpent is going to bruise i'm sorry the messiah is going to bruise the serpent's head the serpent will bruise his heel but then genesis 12 had another prophecy about the messiah he's going to come through abraham's seat and now god look how god just gives you more revelation amen as time goes on and now he says not only he's going to be a bruiser the serpent satan not only is going to be abraham see now he's going to be of this specific tribe so god is giving more revelation as tide goes that's just what happened with martin luther right john wesley now brother we've got we're giving more and more revelation all the time amen we have way more revelation than luther i went to a methodist church today we saw we have way more revelation than methodist by god's grace it's only by god's grace but that's exactly how he did it then that's how he does it today praise god he just gives more revelation to each generation that's seeking him god gives him more revelation about his second coming amen okay now let's examine just those scriptures again so verse 40 i'm sorry the holy spirit said judah will present will have the neck of their enemies and let's read psalms 18 40. psalms 18 verse 40. this was literally fulfilled in david here's the son of judah that i say like he's a offspring of judah saying i'm possessing the next of my enemies which which his grandfather prophesied this is over a thousand yeah i'm sorry about 700 700 years later he's fulfilling what his great great great great great grandfather said about him here david is possessing the promises of god amen that's beautiful i think the prophesied of it david fulfilled it way down the line now a lion's wealth the war speaks of the authority and power of a lion the leader right why it's king of the jungle so judah was going to be king of the tribes right because he's going to have christ is going to come out of him because christ is called the line of the tribe of judah also a law giver speaks of the succession of kings of judah until christ came i wish i had a list of those kings but you can see all the good things that come out of here so law giver rulers lions scepters this is the highest privilege was given to judah that's what it looks like because christ the messiah comes out of judah praise christ comes out of praise he anoints our praise now that remember that scripture we read it was kind of strange where he's going to have a vine around the whole neck that's interesting because all this kind of speaks of natural prosperity right but also speaks of christ because he wrote the coat he wrote the cult the foul of an ass remember when he came in on good friday and then also the bible said he treads the wine press of the wrath of almighty god so these scriptures seem to point to christ somehow prophetically you know the bible said that jesus uh would eat butter and honey did you know that and i was speaking of a spirit book so let's read that let's go to isaiah 7. you guys can see that that was so strange because it prophesies of judah having wine and milk but the messiah was going to have also oil they also have honey so isaiah 7 15. this is speaking of the spiritual blessing here say seven fifteen also have now eating butter and honey doesn't make you live a good life right but this has to be spirit i wish it didn't we'll give you passing that out right but butter and honey this must be thinking of spiritual things but it sounds really good just confess go go to your friends to tell them their fault sounds good but it's harder to do it's harder to accomplish not sure what's better than them brothers is yeah so this is the same section of this chapter seven you haven't mentioned you know what honestly i think about that i don't know so it doesn't seem obviously and then i put up here i put oil wine that's where the good samaritan jesus pours in oil and wine so again we have that connection his eyes are red with wine and he's got water judgment right to be an angry equipment but it can also be lessened right revelation uh first peter two verse two says desire the sincere milk of the word well here's the messiah now this milk his teeth are violent so he's he knows how to feed the people he's got the deal right in revelation 6 6 uh oh yeah he said touch not the oil on the line praise god you see jesus christ always associated with butter honey oil you see them connected with all these so i just think it's interesting those are connected with the other prophecies about judah being a lion and having a scepter it's all connected to jesus christ oh dan has dan is an interesting character he has a good start but then like later on a really nice start it just seems like the fathers of the faithful faithful but then not later on remember he was removed from under him i you can be recognized in heaven but not on earth okay so what does his name mean a judge because remember the mother said god is judge me and give me a son i think it was genesis 49. i hear this dan should be a serpent by the way and certainly he's going to be a snake an adder in the path he's going to be a snake aligned with that what kind of life imagine god describing your life well jesse's just going to be a laying in the back doesn't sound very good right it doesn't compare to like you're just ready it doesn't sound good like judah or joseph okay he's in the path that bited the horse's heels now he's biting horses so that part sounds negative moses said dan is a lion's wealth again he shall lead from god so i have a few history notes on that yeah let's give you a daily job oh yeah that's right yeah yeah and that's a great story he said so again the line is well and then he leads from the shop so let's look at this here so there's no mention you see the mention of land about dan no it's that quote from my grandmother here's some history he's the fifth son of jacob his mother was bill rachel's name god has judged me she said i'm grateful for herself the blessing pronounced on him by his father was dance of judge's people probably an illusion this is where it is uh to the judgment of samson who was of the tribe of dane remember he ruled he only will church for 20 years you know that chance didn't rule very long he only judged for 20 years but the holy spirit prophesied that dan would judge the people in other words the holy spirit was prophesied by the great man right because he had a special place in the plan of god bring down the philistines right now here uh they have their place in the march it says they receive a portion of land now their territory extended from the west of ephraim and benjamin to the sea it was small but very fertile small place of really good sounds like archer small church were very fertile you go to church big church they have all kinds of false doctrines right or it's called as a that is a dominant right nobody wants to pray nobody wants to sing and you know so we got to remember you could have small but you can vary fertility very blessed it included among others the cities of lida akron jabo his farm is northern boundary but the district was too limited squeeze into a narrow strip between the mountains and the sea its energies were great behind its numbers okay now this is interesting they were they couldn't overcome the amorites in philistines so they long for another place so let's get down a little bit they sent out spies and then when they got reported back 600 of them girded on their weapons of war and taking with them their wives returned they marched to the foot of hermione and fought against the shem and took it from the sedonians and dwelt there and changed the name of the conquered town to dan this is where we get the idea where moses said he's going to be alive he's going to leap from so he left this his land wasn't big enough so he left to another land and overcame them that's interesting they couldn't defeat the one the two there but they could defeat the other right so that's interesting they have enough faith to defeat those two and rights of philistines but they come down there to herman and they defeat the sidonians so i'm not sure how that type works out right but the land they were promised they couldn't handle so they leave as a lion to another place and they get the victory right there this is all perfect this was four tall uh this one is supposed to be this wasn't too long for this is that processing some people have to wait a long time other people have to wait very well you had to wait 640 years joshua 19 okay this is four wow that was only seven years later moses died only seven years later uh they jumped from their other they left that land and they come and potentially introduce just like the holy spirit okay great now here so see they start out good right they get a good victory now here's where they fall away we're going to read this one too so the so this this gentleman named manny must be a historian he compares dan lot was under a similar temptation they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them they sunk down in the condition of semi-hedianism from which they never emerged the grounds of ruin which marked the site of the holy city sorry beside the city show that it covered a considerable extent but there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate trump nothing good on this drive other than samson that's all they had their name disappears from the role book of the natural and spiritual israel right and that's where everything is very fine this is slide 27. this is where dan disappears right so dan's here when they come out of egypt remember dan's missing so because he started out good but because he got idols god took him out of the tribes and he's not even recognized right now but he will be recognized in the military exactly because that's the dead he raised back up right began himself religious people just facing people and then he'll get a land glory they're going to land in that look at a portion of that land with no wars this time he's got jesus christ praise god he's got the messiah there praise god with the rod of iron okay does that help my god dan started out good but then because of idolatry fell away yes you brought the idolatry solomon's son in terrible but that's what we saw at least he died he saw a dad going down to worship that's a great lesson for us we always have to feed our children you know the ways of god never let them see so this this this tribe basically lasted 500 years until the descendants said okay jeroboam okay king of the northern king right not judah the uh um um is in our life it was so crucial all right so now let's go back to what they said uh moses said dr jacob said he's gonna be a serpent right this could have two meanings it can be it could mean dan could be small uh and wise right the jesus said be harmless as a serpent why is it done but it looks like it means it refers to that idol jeroboam was set up because it caused people to stop me right like just like a serpent would cause that force to throw up with rider their idolatry threw off the whole tribe right now the tribe has thrown off their power ready their connection to god they're throwing off because there's something you know the safety taking the senior members idolated so for me it looks like idolatry i can't really see this one but it was possible remember dan was a small tribe the serpent's a small animal uh so after dan it seems like jacob just takes a break and he says i have waited for thy salvation about all the sons and then he breaks into the next group of the second half of sons but notice that's the this is the first time the word salvation is used in the bible this is the first time um okay here we see dan was removed on the book under heaven either okay so the lions well oh yeah it also could mean this when samson saw that line remember so it could mean that dan is a lion's wealth so he has been strength and strong like a lion with the spirit lord everybody so you guys have any questions about this you know anything that you thought this morning or anybody's false doctors it seems like jacob just takes out joseph joseph decided to go nobody thought joseph died right all those years ago in his life the rest of the holy spirit like you know taking out lehigh right taking out kills maybe the brother of joseph he also said he was so thankful he was such a wonderful son you couldn't have just one tribe god that's another thumbnail this is where he adopts him jacob adopts his grandchildren and now my two sons even master which were born they should be mine yeah verse 8 literally the blessing from the youngers so yeah that's that's all i can find in scripture today somehow it looks like god just want to bless joseph plus i might not have that answer any questions about yourself um is at the very end myself okay government um oh is wow i think your righteous development uh there okay is they um uh sit down with abraham is you uh it
