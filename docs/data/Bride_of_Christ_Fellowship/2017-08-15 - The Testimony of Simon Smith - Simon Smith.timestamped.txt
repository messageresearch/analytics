[0:07] Green's my name is
[0:09] Smith how is the oldest of six
[0:13] children born to Snooki and Ruby Smith
[0:19] when I was born my mother and my father
[0:22] they were Catholic by tradition or
[0:24] however and they took me as a baby and
[0:28] they sprinkled me as a Catholic baby so
[0:32] I was already initiated into religion
[0:34] early on as a child then my mom shortly
[0:37] after that she left that's the Catholic
[0:41] Church and moved to a Pentecostals
[0:43] Assembly God Church and that's where I
[0:46] remained the remainder of my life in
[0:48] Defiance Ohio somebody's God and then we
[0:51] moved from there to Delta Ohio
[0:56] Assemblies of God but when I was five
[0:58] years old my mother had always been
[1:01] teaching us about Jesus being faithful
[1:03] she took all six children to to church
[1:06] faithfully every Sunday every every
[1:08] Wednesday even before we go to school
[1:11] she made sure we didn't we didn't go to
[1:13] school unless we prayed and then we
[1:16] didn't go to bed until we prayed so our
[1:19] life growing up was centered around
[1:21] prayer and I remember early on if five
[1:24] years old probably my mom was driving me
[1:27] uptown in Holgate Ohio to a gas station
[1:30] or to a supermarket or whoever and we
[1:33] were talking about the Lord she was
[1:34] telling about Jesus and I said mom I
[1:36] want to give my heart to Jesus Christ so
[1:38] she pulled over the car right and one of
[1:41] the county roads there and we sat on the
[1:43] side of the road and she led me to the
[1:45] Lord my hand was in her mama hand there
[1:48] and she led me to the Lord and I was so
[1:50] joyous and I was excited that day I was
[1:54] five years old and I just later on that
[1:57] week I went to spend the night at one of
[1:59] my friends named Danny Noah one of my
[2:02] good buddies back then and I was so
[2:05] excited about Jesus actually was able to
[2:06] lead him to the Lord through a prayer
[2:09] and leading him like a little to a
[2:11] sinner's prayer and I was able to lead
[2:13] him to the Lord that was exciting for me
[2:15] as a little little child so
[2:22] but after that you know we get it uh my
[2:25] mother and father had marital problems
[2:28] back in 1982 my dad actually was praying
[2:32] in the closet and he met God and it
[2:37] changed his life and then after directly
[2:40] after that he started God starting
[2:43] dealing with his life revealing
[2:45] mysteries to him that are hidden in the
[2:47] scripture and he would set all four of
[2:49] us boys me cam Sam and Jesse down at
[2:52] four chairs and he'd preach to us for an
[2:54] hour hour and a half at a time and one
[2:57] thing that was revealed to him was the
[2:59] parable of the wheat and tares and he
[3:01] would tell us he said boys he says
[3:03] so-and-so was a tare someone supposed to
[3:05] tear and this is false and that's false
[3:07] and we're just sitting as young children
[3:09] just absorbing these things not knowing
[3:10] what he's even talking about and so he
[3:13] didn't believe in going to church and my
[3:15] mother did and we went religiously every
[3:17] Sunday and Wednesday and my dad would
[3:21] watch these televangelist in the 80s and
[3:23] one by one he would tell us Simon
[3:27] whoever Jesse Paul's him or salmon cam
[3:30] he said that minister is going to fall
[3:32] because he's off the word this Minister
[3:35] is going to follow he's Antichrist and
[3:37] this one's lifting himself up he'll fall
[3:39] and we're little children being fed this
[3:41] to us and one by one we're watching
[3:47] these things as children and boom this
[3:49] televangelist would fall this one would
[3:51] fall from grace that one was caught in
[3:53] this and they'd fall and were and as a
[3:55] little child I'm absorbing these things
[3:57] and how did my dad know these things I
[4:00] know he met God back then how did he
[4:03] know these things and he didn't even go
[4:05] to church and hear the pastor preacher
[4:06] nothing and yet God showed him this
[4:09] one's fallen that one's fallen that
[4:10] what's wrong so we grew up and I grew up
[4:12] in a really confusion confused situation
[4:15] we did it religiously my momma went to
[4:20] church my dad didn't believe it so we
[4:21] have conflict there and then I see where
[4:24] my dad's right and my mom's wrong and
[4:26] yet I see where my mom's right my dad's
[4:28] wrong so it's very very confusing so
[4:31] then we end up moving to Delta Ohio to
[4:34] go to church in
[4:36] Delta something's a god and we moved to
[4:37] Liberty Center where I spent the
[4:39] remainder of my years in high school so
[4:42] growing up in this situation
[4:45] my parents sent him getting divorced
[4:46] when I was a sophomore in high school
[4:48] really ripped ripped our hearts apart
[4:51] pretty well I find myself not knowing
[4:54] which who to go to and the weekends we
[4:58] go with mom do I go with dad who would I
[4:59] stay with you know so it was really a
[5:01] tough time for me but I knew God was
[5:04] real my grandpa's old-school Pentecostal
[5:08] Mexican man and he would tell us
[5:10] constantly on how God raised his own
[5:13] wife from the dead just a year just
[5:15] being a year Christian and his my
[5:18] grandma had died giving birth to my my
[5:20] youngest uncle and he went and prayed by
[5:23] the prayer of faith over my grandmother
[5:25] in the wind in the morgue and God raised
[5:27] her up supernaturally then growing up
[5:30] we're still just in Delta my mother came
[5:33] down with cancer she they were given
[5:35] only a couple months to live and we
[5:37] being young children we thought we were
[5:41] going to have a mama and my dad wanting
[5:43] one night and snuck in he told me and
[5:46] laid his hand on my mom's hand on my
[5:48] mom's head and he said he started
[5:50] praying the prayer of faith and his hand
[5:52] got red-hot warm he said and then the
[5:55] very next day was the surgery the
[5:56] surgeons the doctors went in and they
[5:59] could not find the tumors the size of a
[6:01] softball I believe a grapefruit one of
[6:02] those too and so growing up I hear these
[6:05] testimonies from my grandpa and seeing
[6:07] it on my own life from my mother and and
[6:10] because of these I had a grandma garza
[6:13] raised up and because that also I had a
[6:16] mother that was able to raise these
[6:17] recipes six children up and feel very
[6:20] blessed I knew God was real and so he
[6:24] raised up that had a respect for my
[6:26] grandparents from my pastor at the time
[6:28] his family and just what God was doing
[6:31] for us of course we weren't born again
[6:35] we lived a little bit like the world my
[6:37] mother was really strict
[6:44] so then as it came to as I came to age
[6:47] at age 18 it was time for me to go to
[6:48] college I decide to go to college and I
[6:50] said man I better get baptized to keep
[6:53] me through these colleges ages and I
[6:55] remember going down and I sold a pastor
[6:58] I said pastor Trowbridge I said I need
[6:59] to get baptized I'm going to college you
[7:01] know I don't wanna get involved he
[7:03] baptized me in the name of the Father
[7:04] Son and Holy Ghost so I went up to
[7:08] college and I became an absolute heathen
[7:11] lived like the devil partied
[7:14] Geraint got drunk constantly run around
[7:18] with women girlfriends here and there or
[7:20] whatever just filthy and I get given up
[7:24] on God mostly due to confusion in
[7:26] religion I see in the household and I
[7:29] didn't know what else to do so I just
[7:30] was now the temptations are coming and I
[7:34] just went a full head hedonism so but at
[7:38] the end of four and a half years in
[7:39] college the Lord allowed me to destroy
[7:41] my life
[7:42] I lost a girlfriend college funds had
[7:45] run out and now I come back to my
[7:47] mother's house a college dropout and in
[7:52] a deep depression for six months I
[7:55] didn't know what to do so I gave up I
[7:57] said Lord I said I had to go back I went
[7:59] back to my mother's Church and I gave up
[8:01] I repented and I realized that I cannot
[8:04] I can't even live my own life so I had
[8:07] to move on I started praying for a job
[8:10] God gave me a job
[8:12] my brother cam had already gotten saved
[8:14] was at the church and we started raising
[8:15] up as youth in the u.s. ministry there
[8:18] and they saw us as leaders because we're
[8:20] older and we were on fire for God
[8:23] witnessing to everyone we could tell and
[8:26] we were excited for what God I all the
[8:29] burden all the pain had left my my
[8:31] spirit realm I feel so good I was so
[8:33] glad to be a Christian and then as we
[8:36] grow as I'm raising up in the youth
[8:38] group I see sin in the church and I went
[8:40] up to my old pastor I said pastor preach
[8:42] against sin he said I said if they had a
[8:44] problem with you you tell him to come
[8:46] see me I was real bold you know but he
[8:48] would never preach against sin like I
[8:50] thought because I saw in the youth group
[8:51] and then I started seeing things as I
[8:53] read the Bible now a new Christian
[8:55] uh things contrary to the Word of God
[8:58] like speaking in tongues of the EMAs of
[9:01] the Holy Ghost so when I seen that
[9:03] doctrine coming I'd watched the people's
[9:06] lives as spoke with tongues because if
[9:09] they had spoke with tongues they had the
[9:10] Holy Ghost so I'd watch their lives and
[9:12] I could live a cleaner life without
[9:15] speaking in tongues without the Holy
[9:17] Ghost than they could with him so now
[9:20] I'm getting confused I didn't know what
[9:23] to do mean for the cam is Elias every
[9:27] extra service from any denomination we
[9:29] would go to it on a Friday night
[9:31] Saturday night just looking for more
[9:33] truth whether we knew it or not so we go
[9:38] there and hear this church and that
[9:39] church and that church even though being
[9:41] faithful to our are one thing about my
[9:43] old Pentecostal church they loved you
[9:46] they express love real genuine love and
[9:49] I respect them for that I love them for
[9:51] that
[9:57] and then so I didn't know what to do and
[10:00] then the thing came started ringing in
[10:01] my ear was my dad always told me he said
[10:06] Simon if you want to meet God he said go
[10:08] pray in your closet so I took that
[10:11] serious one time was the end of I got
[10:14] saved the spring of 2000 and by the end
[10:17] near the end of 2001 I started going in
[10:21] my closet every night and I said one
[10:24] simple prayer and I prayer was this I
[10:26] said Lord if this is not the truth
[10:30] talking about the Pentecostal rankings
[10:32] some ways a God if this is not the truth
[10:35] send me the truth I don't care how crazy
[10:37] it is I'll believe it and I said a
[10:39] one-sentence prayer for three and a half
[10:41] months in my closet now to back this up
[10:45] brother Brooks Isaiah Brooks my first
[10:48] pastor and the message I love the man
[10:51] dearly I just got off the phone with him
[10:55] recently he said that at that time I was
[10:58] praying in the mud in those closet for
[10:59] three half months three months prior to
[11:02] that
[11:03] he started fasting and praying and he
[11:06] had serviced almost every day for six
[11:09] months praying for a revival I didn't
[11:12] know it was that intense but he said he
[11:14] had and he was the only one preaching
[11:16] his over services every day he had
[11:18] service every day he said praying and
[11:21] fasting the church would as a body would
[11:23] fast praying for a revival so then at
[11:26] this the end of 2001 there I've been
[11:31] praying these things and at the end of
[11:33] the three and a half mark 911 hit where
[11:37] the towers fell and two weeks before
[11:40] that I was actually in New York looking
[11:41] directly up at those towers are
[11:43] underneath was looking up so it was a
[11:46] sign throat for me from God
[11:48] so I was praying for truth and then
[11:51] another brother named brother Craig he
[11:53] was working at Sauter's I had previously
[11:56] worked disorders and my best friend was
[11:58] still working as auditors so a 9/11 hit
[12:01] all this all the denominational seed or
[12:06] however the people at Sauter's started
[12:08] coming to brother Craig said
[12:09] at the end of the world is this the end
[12:11] of the world was this the end of the
[12:11] world but the correct we are he said we
[12:13] are at the end so from my understanding
[12:15] he went to brother Isaiah and said
[12:18] brother would you let me do but the book
[12:20] said start a service in your house so
[12:23] they started printing out flyers and
[12:26] getting all these copied out flyers to
[12:28] start a service on a Saturday and I just
[12:31] talked to my best friend and borrowed
[12:33] his truck for a week and he let me
[12:36] borrow it and he was going back to
[12:38] solder and as a brother Craig and
[12:41] brother Dave Llewellyn called Big Dave
[12:43] Llewellyn there they had these flyers
[12:46] now they're passing them out at Sauter's
[12:47] they see my best friend
[12:49] juan garcia and i love that man to this
[12:53] day juan garcia he's a he's a real sweet
[12:57] gentleman and brother dave Llewelyn
[13:01] specifically took one of flyers and he
[13:04] had just heard that I got saved Dave
[13:08] Lewallen told my buddy Juan said Juan
[13:11] make sure you give this the Simon so the
[13:15] flyer was passed from brother Dave
[13:17] Llewellyn to my buddy juan garcia jr.
[13:20] and add lights returned his truck at the
[13:23] end of that week Juan gave me that flyer
[13:25] he said hey Simon he said hey it was
[13:27] I've done her clapping hands and I said
[13:29] what's up man and he said hey go to the
[13:32] service he says I'll meet you there
[13:34] and I'm like okay I took the fire I was
[13:36] looking at okay and I was just have been
[13:38] praying for truth for three and a half
[13:39] months in my closet every night and I
[13:43] said okay I'll meet you there buddy and
[13:45] we hugged and shook hands over and that
[13:47] Saturday night I showed up and a little
[13:50] house church on you could live Euclid
[13:52] Avenue on Defiance Ohio and I sat down I
[13:55] had my little third day hat on beanie
[13:57] and I pull in there and I had my Bible
[13:59] and I sat down and it's strange it's in
[14:01] a house there's chairs and there's a
[14:03] pulpit up there and I sat down for my
[14:05] first message sermon
[14:09] being preached there and Brooks I
[14:12] believe preached and then brother Craig
[14:14] I went back Saturday after Saturday
[14:16] after Saturday and brother Craig and
[14:19] brother Brooks would alternating one
[14:21] would preach here the other one
[14:22] appreciate
[14:23] I'm hearing things I've never heard
[14:24] before and I'm saying wow what is this
[14:28] so one night after a couple maybe a
[14:30] month or so of these services on
[14:32] Saturday
[14:33] I pulled brother Craig and Big Dave
[14:35] aside I said I said I got to ask you as
[14:38] a question they said yeah yeah by the
[14:40] sign when I said I said where are you
[14:42] getting this because I sat in the church
[14:46] from a baby if it were raised up my
[14:48] entire youth in a church and these
[14:52] things they're teaching in one month I
[14:54] understood and heard things I never
[14:56] heard before beyond what I've been
[14:59] previously taught and they're teaching
[15:01] it straight from the Bible so they said
[15:04] you really want to know I said
[15:06] absolutely they said come follow me they
[15:09] went into their bedroom they took me
[15:10] into the bedroom and we did like a three
[15:11] or four hour Bible study all the way to
[15:14] 2:00 p.m. 2:00 a.m. in the morning and
[15:16] I'm sitting there with my all the
[15:19] scriptures and revelations running
[15:21] through my brain
[15:22] I don't thinking whoa this is it and
[15:25] then I step coming faithful hungry I
[15:28] hear the word I'm hungry I'm hungry I'm
[15:30] hungry for more of the word and brother
[15:34] Craig would be faithful he was the one
[15:36] that pretty much set the good gospel
[15:38] foundation in the word for me it was
[15:41] probably a year and a half later I
[15:42] actually received the Batson's of the
[15:44] Holy Ghost after when the services
[15:46] brother Brooks had preached and that was
[15:48] one of my greatest experiences is
[15:50] receiving the baptism the Holy Ghost
[15:52] where God Himself comes down and comes
[15:54] in
[16:01] so as I'm receiving this word it comes
[16:05] now down to Thanksgiving it was two
[16:07] months after 9/11 hit and I started
[16:11] hitting my entire family up and one of
[16:14] the first people the two people that got
[16:16] actually pressed of my heart to witness
[16:18] to is my brother Jesse Smith he's a
[16:20] faithful pastor now in Akron and he
[16:23] almost received it immediately he's seen
[16:26] it right away and then I felt led to hit
[16:28] my dad up because when I was taught
[16:29] original sin urban seed as soon as that
[16:33] served that Bible study was being taught
[16:34] my mind went back to what my dad was
[16:37] preaching us 15 years earlier the wheat
[16:41] and tares that man's a tear that man's a
[16:43] tear and I think my dad was right so I
[16:47] knew God had contacted my dad revealed
[16:50] to him wheat and tares appreciate to his
[16:52] baby boys there and then now I'm hearing
[16:55] it through the Word of God from Genesis
[16:57] all the way to revelations and I said
[16:59] absolutely I knew that was right
[17:01] I went got baptized in England sheezus
[17:03] Christ and then the kind of from my area
[17:07] the stir started taking place brother
[17:09] Jesse became a witnessing machine he he
[17:11] brought in Tim Myers and Scott Overmeyer
[17:13] and brought him right in and he was
[17:15] witnessing to all the Liberty Center
[17:16] boys this and that
[17:18] but I did find resistance within my own
[17:20] family my mother and brother cam they
[17:24] fought me tooth and nail for an entire
[17:26] year one time I was working with brother
[17:29] cam we worked at the same location and
[17:31] we tried to work together back and forth
[17:34] and we're riding back home and he had me
[17:36] drive and as I was driving I looked over
[17:39] and I never seen this before there was a
[17:41] rainbow in one cloud and as I'm as I'm
[17:45] driving I go man cameras you ever see
[17:47] that before and he looks over like this
[17:49] because man I never seen it before and
[17:51] I'm watching this as I'm driving and
[17:54] that rainbow jumped from cloud to cloud
[17:58] to cloud for 20 miles west and I go cam
[18:03] are you seeing this and he's just like
[18:05] whoa we took a left south on 109 headed
[18:09] to her house and that cloud that rainbow
[18:11] jumped from cloud to cloud
[18:13] so in this the Lord is dealing with my
[18:17] my brother cam now he's seeing something
[18:19] supernatural take place while I'm
[18:21] driving as soon as we get home that that
[18:23] rainbow was too I ran up upstairs to my
[18:26] room I looked out the window and that
[18:28] rainbow was right in the cloud right
[18:30] outside my window and I said praise be
[18:33] to God I knew that was the promise that
[18:35] God had you know the rainbow represents
[18:38] a covenant God made a promise with me a
[18:40] confident amen so we're the cameras
[18:43] seeing these things and so Liam brother
[18:44] Jesse went on we started witnessing to
[18:46] every single person we could there was
[18:48] quite a stir we tried to pull as many
[18:50] from any church any soul lost or
[18:53] whatever we could do we went out with
[18:54] zeal witnessing the entire group was
[18:57] witnessing machines by God's grace at
[18:59] that time at that time that the the
[19:02] Saturday night study had moved from
[19:04] defiance to Florida Ohio on the corner
[19:07] of Church and Vine so much do I
[19:11] I walked many of the streets in defiance
[19:13] I walked almost the entire town of
[19:16] Holgate passing out flyers
[19:18] I walked almost the entire town of
[19:20] Florida Ohio passing out flyers
[19:22] I walked parts of Toledo Ohio passing
[19:25] out flyers so we went out with zeal
[19:27] tried to hit as many as we could and
[19:30] then after one year the message fighting
[19:32] my own back my own pastor now brother
[19:35] cam where the cam was Lord was dealing
[19:39] with him at the same time he left the
[19:42] old church because of he caught one
[19:44] revelation we brought in it that a woman
[19:47] shouldn't preach it and brother cam he
[19:50] felt solid on that doctrine because he
[19:51] goes if you could see it that's what God
[19:53] allowed him to see so he was faithful on
[19:56] that so one night he showed up in
[19:58] Florida Ohio at our one of our Saturday
[20:00] services and I had already brought a
[20:01] towel and sandals and everything for
[20:04] some reason I just packed that night cam
[20:07] shows up was dropped off because the
[20:09] other guys didn't want to come was
[20:11] dropped off there and he listened to the
[20:14] service after service he's like sigh can
[20:17] you drive me home and I was like yeah
[20:19] absolutely so we're driving home and
[20:21] cameras for the cam was like so the
[20:24] revelation or
[20:26] understanding that the Father Son Holy
[20:28] Ghost the name is Jesus Christ right
[20:30] that's it yeah that's right
[20:32] and then he we it was silence for about
[20:35] a couple minutes and I do say so sigh
[20:38] the the name of the Father Son and Holy
[20:41] Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ I said
[20:43] absolutely brother you know and I'm I
[20:45] was on guard because I you fight you
[20:47] know and you're ready for a battle at
[20:49] any time you won't have your sword ready
[20:50] and I was expecting it and then the
[20:54] great was like a third time he said
[20:56] Simon he says the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:58] Christ is is the way to be baptized in
[21:03] the following ghost I said absolutely
[21:05] that is the interpretation of that
[21:07] scripture and he turned to me and maybe

[21:46] walk down by the canal there's a little
[21:48] waterfall and that waterfall falls into
[21:50] like a pool of a nice pool water and
[21:52] that's where baptized a majority of our
[21:54] Saints by the grace of God right there

[25:01] Scotty I'm going I'm going with you he
[25:03] said oh thank you sigh thank you

[25:16] o'clock son like that
[25:16] is it okay I'll be there so I I get off
[25:19] the phone and Betsy one day in the
[25:22] skirts sis iemon I'm going with you
[25:24] I said yes amen but the Randy said I'm
[25:27] going with him but I can still his anger
[25:29] issues he said I'm not going I said it's
[25:31] pretty celibate
[25:32] so as me Betsy in brother Randy went
[25:34] down I grabbed all my histories all my
[25:37] scripture notes everything had a pile
[25:38] like this going into this meeting and it
[25:41] was at night it was already dark at the
[25:42] time so we drove out to the Methodist
[25:46] Church went down into it and lo and
[25:50] behold I find myself sitting among there
[25:53] was a half-circle five or six pastors
[25:56] and their wives my actually my old
[25:58] pastor their denomination was there his
[26:01] wife and then there was about forty
[26:03] Christians to here to view this meeting
[26:07] sitting that way my mother was included
[26:09] as well and their Scott over Meyerson
[26:11] with his mom and dad then my sister
[26:14] Betsy said right next to me and brother
[26:15] Randy said right next to me and the
[26:18] Methodist pastor stood up said all right
[26:20] we called this meeting together because
[26:22] we want to talk about what you're doing
[26:24] to our youth in this area how you're
[26:26] spreading these false doctrines
[26:27] especially demon seed and I go to
[26:29] serpent seed he goes now demon seed I
[26:31] said fine and he went on and he says he
[26:35] goes how are you bringing this through
[26:37] the Bible I said okay I said I'm going
[26:41] to teach you a Bible study on surface
[26:43] seed and if you can see in the scripture
[26:47] then you have to agree with it if I can
[26:49] bring it right from this Bible then they
[26:51] all agreed they're absolutely so I
[26:53] started real slow into the Bible study I
[26:55] probably got five or six scriptures in
[26:57] and one started yelling at this you
[26:59] can't teach that and you can't do this
[27:01] and what about this and I throw the
[27:02] scripture here I'd wrote with Scripture
[27:03] there I drew a scripture there but the
[27:05] Lord the Holy Ghost had given me wisdom
[27:07] and he taught me showed me how to set a
[27:10] trap that that in that instant he showed
[27:13] me how to set a trap and I kept feeding
[27:16] that I tried this net and finally
[27:18] they're out almost like an up
[27:19] or asked my sister they're up and upward
[27:21] business not yelling at me and screaming
[27:24] and this and this and finally I waited
[27:26] for the moment where I felt like I said
[27:28] change it and I said hold on I said less
[27:30] I said let's switch to baptism you know
[27:33] let's just switch from service he let's
[27:35] just go right to baptism why we teach
[27:37] baptism different absolutely and the
[27:39] Lord was giving me wisdom how I had to
[27:41] get him to say in unison and all want to
[27:44] court a certain thing so I started
[27:46] working baptism now show them this
[27:48] scripture showing that scripture went to
[27:50] 29 to 20 19 went to acts 2 X 8 X 10 X 19
[27:55] and isn't that and the the major
[27:57] consensus after the whole little study
[28:00] pretty much in use and they said we'll
[28:02] believe the red letters will believe
[28:05] what Jesus said over what Paul and Peter
[28:09] and Philip said any day of the week will
[28:13] take Jesus's words in other words
[28:15] they're saying the rest of the scripture
[28:16] doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
[28:18] they did in the book of Acts and when I
[28:21] had them to the point where they said
[28:22] will believe Jesus's words over there's
[28:25] any day of the week I had them when they
[28:30] said that now the Lord directed me to go
[28:33] back to original sin I said hold on now
[28:36] you just said that if Jesus said it
[28:39] you'd believe it they said absolutely I
[28:40] said let's go back to serpent seed it's
[28:42] okay all right all right
[28:44] there is a rough spirit in there if you
[28:47] can imagine so I started working Matthew
[28:52] 13 I said you said you told me that if
[28:56] Jesus appreciate you believe it is
[28:58] absolutely absolutely okay all right I
[29:00] started Matthew 13 and I took the two
[29:03] first parables I said you know he
[29:05] preached a parable of the sower let's
[29:07] read that and I read the parable to
[29:09] sober I said does anyone have a problem
[29:10] here I said this is Jesus own words it's
[29:12] a no problem I said one thing I love
[29:15] about these first two parables that
[29:16] Jesus gave his own interpretation of
[29:18] these parables what they meant so I and
[29:22] you cannot add to or take from it I said
[29:24] absolutely
[29:25] let's read the interpretation of the
[29:27] perilous sower we read it I said does
[29:29] anyone have a problem they said
[29:30] No I said let's go to the next parable
[29:34] and this is the one my daddy preached to
[29:36] this boys and that was just taught to me
[29:39] the truth on I said let's go to see what
[29:41] Jesus said about the wheat and the tares
[29:44] I said let's read the parable I read the
[29:48] parable what does it mean does anyone
[29:51] have a problem with this parable I said
[29:54] no absolutely not
[29:55] I said one good thing about this parable
[29:57] is that Jesus interpreted it a parable
[30:00] is something hidden that's not revealed
[30:03] it's not open but Jesus actually opened
[30:05] this parable I said this is the serpent
[30:09] seed preached right here and I started
[30:12] reading the interpretation in Matthew 13
[30:14] of what Jesus said on the parable of the
[30:17] wheat and tares and saints of God it was
[30:21] silence I was watching them as they
[30:24] glanced back and forth looking at one
[30:27] another one lady got up and prophesized
[30:29] that you can't read it like that this is
[30:32] of the devil Allah you can't I said I'm
[30:34] reading the scripture do you believe the
[30:37] scripture or not this is Jesus's own
[30:39] words do you believe him or not she sat
[30:41] down and it was silence and it sounded
[30:45] like that for about a minute pin drop
[30:46] style and the pastor said you know what
[30:49] let's switch back to something else but
[30:53] at that moment I knew it was opened up
[30:55] to them they saw it let this be a
[30:59] witness to them and they went we went on
[31:03] for almost an hour and a half two hours
[31:05] doctrine the doctrine and then finally
[31:07] one man stood up said let's go over here
[31:09] and dress why are you teaching them to
[31:11] dress this way this way I said
[31:13] absolutely sir started going through
[31:14] hair and dress and at this time my
[31:16] sister started bawling or weeping a
[31:19] little bit she's one day in the in the
[31:22] Word of God one day dress and holiness
[31:25] for the first time went to Walmart
[31:26] bought three skirts just like that she
[31:28] was wearing one of them sin that night
[31:31] she's she started weeping and I started
[31:33] I'm thinking oh she's breaking please
[31:34] Lord hold her hold her Lord ISTEP
[31:37] teaching hair and dress holiness a clean
[31:40] living how women's to let her hair grow
[31:43] and where's
[31:43] Hertz and these things list such that
[31:45] nature and finally after a couple
[31:47] minutes or maybe 10 minutes she was
[31:48] bawling she was actually just weeping
[31:51] and I'm thinking oh Jesus help me and a
[31:53] pastor out of nowhere stood up said why
[31:56] don't you let your sister speak for
[31:58] herself and I'm thinking oh my god help
[32:02] us for Jesus and my sisters there was
[32:05] bent down like this just crying and my
[32:08] sister stood up out of her chair like
[32:10] this
[32:10] and she goes with her finger like this
[32:12] and she says I've never been so
[32:15] persecuted in all my life I just want to
[32:18] go to Saturday night Bible studies I
[32:20] want to go to and hear the true Word of
[32:22] God they can prove this from Genesis to
[32:24] revelations and I'm getting emails and
[32:26] text calling me a devil and deceived in
[32:29] a demon and this miss earnest and my the
[32:32] Holy Ghost had my sister tear them up
[32:35] and right after my sister got done with
[32:39] her speech there the Methodist pastor
[32:43] said stood up said ok we're done we're
[32:45] calling this meeting it's over and
[32:47] that's how it was
[32:48] so saints of God you don't have to be a
[32:52] rebel aiding man you don't have to be a
[32:55] preacher you don't have to be anything
[32:58] all you have to have is the leading of
[33:00] the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Spirit
[33:04] working through me and we took on five
[33:07] and six pastors with 20 years 30 years
[33:09] who knows how many years of experience
[33:10] and their wives and these people and the
[33:13] Holy Ghost left a witness right there
[33:22] so after that
[33:24] can you Vaughn in the Word of God my
[33:26] sister now in my brother-in-law they got
[33:28] married now in brother Randy a powerful
[33:31] preacher singer than the message that he
[33:34] came in and the Lord continued to do
[33:37] miraculous things so we continued on in
[33:40] the word and this message a couple
[33:43] things I'd like to hit is I was just
[33:45] maybe a year into the message I started
[33:47] pipe fitting and I was at a job site and
[33:50] an older man was working to us young a
[33:52] ladder he was on six foot ladder he fell
[33:54] down dead he fell down dead and as my
[33:58] first experience time with death and but
[34:00] I knew the promises of God and I had
[34:02] didn't have a whole lot of boldness with
[34:03] healing yet I could witness all day long
[34:06] but I didn't have the boldness for
[34:08] healing and in my mind I closed my eyes
[34:10] I said lord please spare his life and it
[34:12] wasn't 15 minutes later he was back up
[34:14] and alive so I started seeing you know
[34:17] the God answers even silent prayers and
[34:20] your thoughts that the Prophet said your
[34:21] thoughts speak louder than your words
[34:23] and actions do in heaven so it was a
[34:27] couple years after that I was on the job
[34:29] site again and a carpenter a drywall
[34:31] finisher had a seizure while he was on
[34:34] stilts finishing high drywall he fell
[34:36] down
[34:37] smacked his head cracked his head on the
[34:39] concrete floor me and my Foreman run in
[34:42] there and he's already in later I find
[34:44] out it was called the death rattle
[34:46] because my Foreman James Rocchi a
[34:48] wonderful man he was a paramedic at a
[34:50] time or knew about those things he did
[34:53] runs with the fair the firefighters all
[34:55] the time he said Simon he said he was in
[34:57] his death rattle and now a little bit
[35:00] further growing up in Christ on the
[35:01] power of God I went down and I just
[35:04] touched his foot as he's having his
[35:06] death rattles and I said in the name of
[35:08] Jesus Christ and it wasn't five minutes
[35:11] and he was back to his self he lived and
[35:15] they carried him off an ambulance so now
[35:18] I'm seeing the power of God as it moved
[35:20] through my grandpa and my mother and my
[35:22] father and then last year I was at
[35:26] another job site where a man was on two
[35:28] stories up until some scaffolding and I
[35:31] was down 15 feet away 10 15 feet away
[35:33] working on my my pipe there in age
[35:36] in Michigan and I heard a big boom
[35:39] I didn't think getting of interior's
[35:41] loud noises all day long
[35:43] and I looked over and there's a there's
[35:45] a man laying there half his shoulder on
[35:47] the scaffold scaffold outrigger and I'm
[35:50] thinking oh my goodness and he's he's
[35:52] breathing like barely breathing I run
[35:55] over to him and I'm looking at his his
[35:56] coworkers and they're not doing anything
[35:58] and I'm like what is going on here
[35:59] they're just watching him so I I was
[36:02] like man Lord 911 all my thoughts and
[36:06] then it was a couple minutes later I was
[36:08] like Lord what do we do whatever do so
[36:10] then two of his co-workers come right
[36:12] over and I was waiting for kind of to
[36:14] take concern you know somebody do
[36:15] something here and they just looking and
[36:18] I just stood there looking at this man
[36:20] laying on this ground and he was like
[36:21] breathing and it was really loud
[36:26] and it was just like that death rattle
[36:28] that I heard years before so I knew is
[36:31] its I told those two men I took control
[36:33] of the situation this time I said bow
[36:36] your heads we're going to call out for
[36:38] his name in the Jesus Christ name Jesus
[36:39] Christ I went down I prayed a one-minute
[36:42] prayer probably calling for this man's
[36:44] life his breathing is slowing now as
[36:47] he's doing the death ran I was getting
[36:49] real slow I got done with the prayer
[36:51] I've said that some young first-year
[36:53] apprentice I said call nine one now call
[36:55] nine one one I ran into the the school I
[36:57] was working at and I got the nurse I ran
[37:00] out by the time I got back he was
[37:02] conscious and breathing normal I was
[37:06] rejoicing um we have witnesses of what
[37:09] was done and they shipped him off and
[37:11] what I found out with a life flighted
[37:13] him all the way to Ann Arbor the more
[37:15] the most specialized hospital there now
[37:18] it was two weeks later that his this
[37:20] man's Foreman comes and hunts me up on
[37:22] the jobsite big six foot five man's and
[37:25] he comes up to me looking down like this
[37:26] he's like you're the guy who prayed over
[37:28] him I said yes sir he said you're not
[37:31] going to believe this I said what's dad
[37:33] he said when he fell he said he
[37:36] fractured his skull there was blood on
[37:39] his brain he broke his shoulder he's and
[37:42] his ribs were pointing into his lungs
[37:43] and bleeding in his lungs and they life
[37:46] flighted him all the way to n Arbor that
[37:47] night they got their face
[37:49] his head was starting to swell his brain
[37:51] was swelling and his shoulder started
[37:53] swelling out of controllably he said the
[37:56] very next day all the swelling was gone
[37:58] he was up talking and walking around and
[38:03] I whoa I said I looked up this big six
[38:06] with like five six foot five guy I said
[38:08] you tell that man Jesus Christ saved his
[38:11] life that day I heard on reason yes sir
[38:13] yes sir so I see the healing power of
[38:18] Jesus Christ on the jobsite and then
[38:22] years before that my brother had just
[38:26] had his one of his last boys there named
[38:30] Weston and he was born on a Saturday
[38:33] after church on Sunday I called him I
[38:35] said Sammy I want to come over to your
[38:37] boy and he was really down I said Sammy
[38:39] what's wrong man he goes side he was
[38:41] they want to operate him a new board
[38:42] they want to operate him necessary
[38:44] operate I go what I said Sammy let me
[38:47] come over pray tomorrow after work he's
[38:48] like yes sir
[38:49] so I was ready to come over and pray and
[38:53] then right before I rounded up my wife I
[38:55] said we're going to pray and she's like
[38:56] okay and then I got a phone call it was
[38:59] from sister Karen Sanders down in Lima
[39:01] and she fed me two hours of testimonies
[39:04] and the Saints my faith was so high I
[39:09] knew something was going to happen and
[39:12] it was already late now by the time
[39:14] those testimonies are over I called him
[39:15] my brother same as Tammy I'm coming over
[39:17] he said come over side come over so we
[39:19] rolled over there in the car we got
[39:22] there and you can tell they're real down
[39:24] and my sister-in-law and my brother roll
[39:27] down I said saying to God we're going to
[39:29] pray over this child and what was wrong
[39:31] the aorta was completely deformed of the
[39:35] heart one of the valves was not working
[39:38] or closed there was a hole in the heart
[39:40] and I also had a murmur to it so there's
[39:43] four things wrong with this heart and so
[39:47] we said a prayer we gathered hands and
[39:50] prayed over this baby
[39:51] we just cried out the name Jesus Christ
[39:54] for the healing of this baby the miracle
[39:56] whatever was we needed it we needed we
[39:58] needed it
[39:58] everybody's weeping and crying the Holy
[40:00] Ghost had come down and then fine as
[40:02] soon as
[40:03] I started feeding my brothers faith give
[40:05] him Scripture
[40:06] I said Sammy by His stripes he's healed
[40:09] seems like that's right that's right I
[40:11] said if Jesus Christ was here right now
[40:13] we couldn't hear mama Nico's what I said
[40:15] because he's already human seems like
[40:17] Sam goes that boy is healed and I knew
[40:22] it was right the very next day they went
[40:24] in for the pre pre surgery scan and they
[40:29] actually did a 4d scan of the heart
[40:32] however that works and the doctors got
[40:35] the pictures back and they said we don't
[40:37] need to do a surgery the heart is
[40:40] totally changed it's a miracle because
[40:43] my brother Sam just called me on the way
[40:44] home from where sighs I we don't have
[40:46] they cancel the surgery he's healed he's
[40:48] healed I said praise the Lord Sam by
[40:50] God's grace by His stripes he's you it's
[40:52] done he said praise God so now I have a
[40:55] wonderful six-year-old nephew that God
[40:58] has come down totally changed his heart
[41:01] made him a young healthy healthy boy
[41:10] in closing I hope this was beneficial
[41:12] and hope it encourages the saints of God
[41:16] right now as of right now I've got three
[41:21] brothers in this message serving two of
[41:24] them are pastors my little baby brother
[41:26] just come in about three years ago to
[41:28] the word believing the word my sister
[41:31] has been faithful so I have one brother
[41:34] my mama and my daddy and we got them all
[41:38] and then we're ready for the flight so
[41:41] be praying for us but we want to give
[41:43] all the praise and glory honor to our
[41:46] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's no
[41:48] one like him or depending fully on him
[41:51] and hope this has been a blessing god
[41:54] bless you
