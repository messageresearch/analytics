[0:51] here how many believe every word of this
[0:54] is thus sayith the Lord I believe that I
[0:57] believe the B Bible's the infallible
[0:59] source of of all truth
[1:01] hallelujah verse one says and I Brethren
[1:03] could not speak unto you as unto
[1:05] spiritual but as unto carnal even as

[1:18] neither yet now are ye able let's read
[1:21] verse three together ready 1 2 3 for ye
[1:24] are yet carnal for whereas there is
[1:28] among you envying and strife and
[1:31] divisions are ye not carnal and walk as
[1:35] men may God add his Blessing to the
[1:37] reading of his word you may be
[1:40] seated that's quite a Thanksgiving text
[1:43] isn't it
[1:44] hallelujah hallelujah I'm really not
[1:46] preaching on Thanksgiving today I'm just
[1:48] trying to I've preached on that before
[1:49] over the years I've been preaching from
[1:50] this Pulpit 18 years so not every
[1:52] holiday do I preach a Thanksgiving or
[1:55] Christmas message or uh I always do a
[1:57] Easter and Good Friday but not every
[1:59] other holiday like you know July 4th or
[2:00] something like that uh although we're
[2:02] very thankful for our independence
[2:03] Hallelujah we want to be thankful in all
[2:05] things but I don't really have a
[2:07] Thanksgiving message I mean it may turn
[2:08] out to be that and at the end I may read
[2:10] through that just a short list of some
[2:12] of the testimonies from this year what a
[2:14] blessing uh this year has been by God's
[2:16] grace but I want to um read through a
[2:18] few verses here and uh preach a little
[2:20] bit let me set a timer and I can try to
[2:22] get us out here on a good time the Lord
[2:23] willing as as God would lead us here so
[2:26] praise the
[2:28] Lord so verse one says and I Brethren
[2:31] could not speak unto you as unto
[2:32] spiritual but as unto carnal even as
[2:36] babes in Christ Hallelujah so I just
[2:39] want to back up real briefly chapter 2
[2:41] we looked at uh Sunday proclaiming
[2:43] Christ crucified you know when St Paul
[2:46] was preaching to new people especially
[2:47] sinners like in Athens he said he tried
[2:50] to preach Christ and him crucified Paul
[2:53] we saw it on Sunday Paul didn't go into
[2:55] the depths of predestination or even the
[2:58] depths of the godhead or any of the
[3:00] depths of the Jew and Gentile uh
[3:02] dispensation you know the church ages
[3:05] Paul didn't go into any of that he
[3:06] stayed with repentance Hallelujah
[3:09] repentance from sins and knowing that
[3:12] Jesus Christ died was buried resurrected
[3:16] and everyone will stand before the
[3:17] Judgment seat of Christ Hallelujah he
[3:20] kept it very basic uh he said yes you're
[3:22] The Offspring of God he said but you're
[3:24] too superstitious so Paul when he when
[3:27] he preached to to Sinners he told them
[3:29] some of their mistakes not all of them
[3:30] of course you know he didn't have time
[3:31] to do that but he told them some of
[3:33] their mistakes and he said the solution
[3:35] is the Gospel of Jesus Christ the good
[3:37] news Hallelujah so we saw how Paul was
[3:40] so humble uh uh and sometimes there was
[3:42] Miracles when he preached a groups
[3:44] sometimes there wasn't now what's
[3:45] interesting isn't this interesting he
[3:47] was when he was preaching to the
[3:48] Athenians God didn't do any Miracles
[3:50] there because they were so intellectual
[3:52] right the Bible records no Miracles but
[3:54] when he preaches to a bunch of
[3:56] ignoramuses we'd say on the island of
[3:59] Mita God heals every one of them with
[4:02] Supernatural Miracles Hallelujah it just
[4:04] goes to show church sometimes the
[4:06] hardest people to preach to are the
[4:08] intellectual ones they know so much
[4:11] right but they know so much of the wrong
[4:13] thing they've gotten so intellectual
[4:16] that they have no faith in the Living
[4:17] God right but it just goes to show let's
[4:20] be humble who wants childlike Faith here
[4:22] tonight praise God God keep us humble
[4:25] yes there's deep seen things of God
[4:26] we'll get into that tonight there is a
[4:28] time for the Deep things of God but
[4:29] there there's also a time for the
[4:30] elementary things of God as well
[4:33] Hallelujah just when the the timing is
[4:35] right and the holy spirit's leading it
[4:38] Hallelujah so we looked at chapter 2 on
[4:40] Sunday we he proclaimed Christ crucified
[4:43] amongst the the Corinthian Church which
[4:44] was a very intellectual Church they were
[4:46] a very uh large Church uh Jesus said you
[4:50] he said I have much people in this city
[4:51] so this was a large church and remember
[4:53] they had all nine gifts of the holy
[4:55] spirit Paul said you don't lack in any
[4:57] gift they had all nine gifts operating
[5:00] which was amazing you know we've seen
[5:02] all nine operate but they don't all
[5:04] operate you know at the same time it's
[5:06] spread out over numerous years but it
[5:09] seems like the Corinthian Church had all
[5:10] nine of them operating but they also had
[5:13] a lot of carnal things going on right
[5:15] they were suing people they were arguing
[5:17] who is the greatest preacher and who
[5:19] baptized me and who baptized you uh one
[5:22] of the man had a sexual immorality
[5:24] sleeping with his stepmother and
[5:25] wouldn't even repent to the church you
[5:28] had uh just so many awful things going
[5:30] on people getting drunk before communion
[5:32] this was just it was a it was a good
[5:34] church in some ways but a there was a
[5:36] lot of a lot of sin in the church as
[5:38] well and so Paul you know tried to come
[5:40] just in the humility of Christ preaching
[5:42] Christ crucified and then he says the
[5:44] wisdom of the Holy Spirit takes you into
[5:46] the deep things of God and it helps you
[5:49] judge all things the holy spirit will
[5:51] help us tonight by God's grace to look
[5:53] at our lives and judge our lives uh is
[5:56] my life uh as close as I possibly can
[6:00] uh to obeying Jesus Christ is my life
[6:02] does my life glorify Christ as much as
[6:04] it should we're all at different states
[6:06] you know uh in serving the lord you know
[6:09] some of us are more mature than others
[6:10] some of us a little more younger in the
[6:12] faith you know and we just thank God
[6:14] Wherever We Are Tonight we thank God he
[6:15] called us out of the world Hallelujah so
[6:17] we don't compare ourselves with
[6:19] ourselves we compare ourselves to Christ
[6:22] Hallelujah We compare our Christ you
[6:24] know where what does Christ show me uh
[6:26] what truth should I know what should I
[6:28] be living uh God wants us to live what
[6:30] we've heard Hallelujah we've seen it in
[6:32] the Bible God doesn't ask anybody to do
[6:34] anything that that uh that they don't
[6:35] know about right you know God only asked
[6:38] us to live what he showed us hallelujah
[6:40] and so we look here in in in in chapter
[6:43] 3 verse one I'll break into this now
[6:46] here just briefly just a very short
[6:48] introduction um he says you are babes
[6:51] under Christ he can now think about that
[6:53] a prophet of God a a prophet like Paul
[6:56] couldn't preach to their church as
[6:58] spiritual he had to PR preach to them
[7:00] like their spiritual babies What a Sad
[7:02] condition that is and again because
[7:03] they're suing people the rich people
[7:05] think they're better they're getting
[7:06] drunk they're sleeping around sexual
[7:09] immorality they're suing people like
[7:11] this is a very immature church this is
[7:14] not a spiritual church but the opposite
[7:16] is true too if we're not suing each
[7:18] other if we're living sexually pure if
[7:20] we're not getting drunk then we're a
[7:22] mature
[7:24] church amen hallelujah that makes me
[7:26] happy amen because I know we're a mature
[7:28] Church by God's grace
[7:30] it's not judged by how many people are
[7:31] there it's judged by how much you love
[7:33] Jesus because Jesus said if you love me
[7:35] you'll keep my
[7:37] commands so it's the it's not the the
[7:39] size of the church it's how much the
[7:41] church loves Christ and how much the
[7:43] church obeys
[7:46] Christ so you know as we would admit yes
[7:50] there's churches all around us but
[7:51] they're all judged by the word the
[7:53] spirit God says uh the spirit of God
[7:55] judges each person and leads them to
[7:57] judge their life according to the promis
[7:59] is the commands of God is my life
[8:02] obedient to the commands of Christ but
[8:05] he said Paul says you know this
[8:06] Corinthian Church you're carnal he says
[8:09] you're not mature you're babes in Christ
[8:11] and babe means the infant these are baby
[8:14] Christians yet they got tongues they got
[8:16] interpretation they got prophecy they
[8:18] got words of wisdom words of knowledge
[8:20] they got miracles uh they got
[8:22] discernment they got all these things
[8:24] and yet they're
[8:26] babies imagine imagine uh
[8:30] uh uh imagine if if if if in the nursery
[8:32] you know let's say in a little bit you
[8:33] know we have some babies over there
[8:35] imagine if somebody came in there and
[8:37] said let's say we got little uh Adena in
[8:39] there right let's say we got the future
[8:41] baby sarpong in there and then the
[8:43] future baby Smith imagine if I walked in
[8:45] there okay it's time to teach you babies
[8:47] now it's time to preach to you the
[8:50] gospel what could I teach him not much I
[8:53] could teach him you don't want to be
[8:54] around a guy like me you want to be
[8:56] around your mama that's all I could
[8:57] teach him right you don't want to be
[8:58] around a smelly guy guy like me spitting
[9:00] and you know spitting and stuttered all
[9:03] over the place that's all I could teach
[9:04] him and that's what Paul was walking
[9:06] into Paul was walking into a church of
[9:09] babies now what could he teach
[9:11] them not very much right clean up your
[9:14] lives don't live sexual immor immorally
[9:18] you know don't Sue each other don't
[9:21] think you're better than anybody stop
[9:22] arguing about who the greatest preacher
[9:25] is right this is the kind of church he
[9:27] walked into and God again God help us to
[9:30] be a mature Church Hallelujah I'm
[9:33] thankful church I am thankful he they
[9:35] they're they're babies in Christ they're
[9:37] infants they're childish untaught
[9:40] unskilled in the gospel so again whoever
[9:43] that Pastor was of the Corinthian Church
[9:44] I hope he got saved because he sure
[9:47] wasn't very mature if he allowed all
[9:48] these things to happen and he never
[9:50] tried to correct it he never tried to
[9:51] pull people side said listen you
[9:53] shouldn't do this this is a very sinful
[9:56] thing to do Christians shouldn't do this
[9:59] oh what a what a sad condition but again
[10:02] at the beginning he says thank God
[10:03] remember the chapter one he says thank
[10:04] God grace and peace be multiplied to you
[10:08] yet he still was positive with them
[10:10] there's Hope For You Hallelujah There's
[10:11] Hope for little babies right to grow up
[10:13] and be mature someday of course there's
[10:15] hope and so the same thing is spiritual
[10:18] if the natural is true babies in the
[10:19] nursery There's Hope for them to grow up
[10:21] then surely There's Hope for the
[10:22] spiritual babies Hallelujah that they'll
[10:25] grow up so Paul had to talk to them like
[10:27] their babies
[10:29] and uh you we we know churches like that
[10:31] right we know churches like that they
[10:33] might have gifts and shouting and loud
[10:34] music and miracles but if they have sin
[10:36] in their lives and they're not uh
[10:38] they're not getting the sin out of their
[10:39] lives they let the sin continue then
[10:41] they're spiritual
[10:42] babies right and thank God for the gifts
[10:44] right but we we saw the greatest gift
[10:47] you can have is what church love okay
[10:49] couple people remember the sermon from
[10:50] two weeks ago okay glory to God the
[10:53] greatest gift you can have is love love
[10:55] is greater than Faith and Hope Charity
[10:57] is the greatest gift you can have you
[10:59] can speak to Every Mountain in your life
[11:00] every obstacle you can speak to it it'll
[11:02] move Miracle after Miracle every person
[11:04] you lay hands on they're healed you can
[11:06] give all your money away you can do all
[11:08] these things but if you don't do it with
[11:10] love it doesn't profit the church
[11:11] anything it's got to be with the love of
[11:14] God in other words what is love love is
[11:16] interest in the other person's
[11:18] well-being and not your own that's what
[11:21] love must be that's what praying for
[11:23] praying for the sick is giving money
[11:25] away the interest of them not my not my
[11:28] interest but the interest of the other
[11:30] person how can I make their life better
[11:33] that's real
[11:34] Christianity verse two I have fed you
[11:37] with milk so Paul could only preach milk
[11:39] messages which are okay if that's what
[11:41] they need and not with meat for hither
[11:44] to you were not able to Bear it neither
[11:46] yet are yet now are ye able so Paul as a
[11:51] prophet could look at the church and say
[11:52] okay you got all these things going on
[11:54] suing people uh greatest of goat
[11:56] arguments who's the greatest of all time
[11:58] sexual sin okay I'm not able to preach
[12:00] deep things yet till you get your life
[12:01] cleaned up right in other words no
[12:04] matter how deep I could preach or Paul
[12:06] no matter how deep Paul could preach and
[12:07] tell you these mysteries of God which we
[12:09] we know the mysteries of God we've seen
[12:11] them it's not really going to help you
[12:14] unless you have sin out of your
[12:16] life it's not going to encourage you
[12:18] it's not going to strengthen you at all
[12:19] if the man keeps sleeping with his
[12:20] stepmom whe whether he knows about
[12:22] predestination or the godhead or baptism
[12:25] that's not going to help him until he
[12:26] gets the desire for sexual sin out of
[12:29] his heart right he's probably on the way
[12:31] to hell right we don't know I mean only
[12:33] God knows the people's hearts if he
[12:35] doesn't get the sexual sin out or the
[12:37] pride I'm better I'm richer I'm better
[12:39] than these poor people in the church oh
[12:41] it's okay for me to get drunk and it's
[12:42] okay for me to drink alcohol till I'm
[12:44] tipsy until you get the sin out and
[12:47] nothing else that that's important uh
[12:49] that that's a deep mystery of God none
[12:51] of that's going to help you because
[12:52] you're o you're given over to evil
[12:54] spirits everybody see that so that's why
[12:57] Paul says I'm not going to preach these
[12:59] Deep Thoughts like I can do to other
[13:01] churches because there's too much sin in
[13:03] the church so again this might be a
[13:05] Thanksgiving message Hallelujah it might
[13:08] make us thankful that God is cleaning
[13:09] out our lives
[13:12] Hallelujah now the word milk means it's
[13:15] a metaphor uh in the Greek for less
[13:19] difficult Christian truths so Paul you
[13:22] know in this in this book he gets down
[13:23] to it you know he talks about well now
[13:25] if your tongue's interpretation only do
[13:27] it if there's an interpreter in the in
[13:28] the church now he said you can speak in
[13:30] tongues as much as you want at home I
[13:31] never have but I I have numerous friends
[13:33] who have and I'm thankful for that I
[13:35] prayed to God and asked God let me speak
[13:36] in tonu but God won't let me do it
[13:38] that's fine I'll wait maybe later on in
[13:40] life Hallelujah maybe one
[13:42] day uh but he says now now it's less
[13:47] difficult it's very easy just do two at
[13:49] the most three in a church service right
[13:52] he started giving them some simple
[13:53] things okay just three okay don't go 5
[13:57] 10 15 20 30
[13:59] just go three he's trying slowly brings
[14:02] brings them easy things to fix in the
[14:03] church and remember with this man in
[14:05] sexual sin what'd he say he said don't
[14:07] even let him come in the church kick him
[14:08] out of the church and give him over to
[14:11] Satan that his body might be destroyed
[14:14] so that Satan destroy his health kind of
[14:15] like what happened to job but of course
[14:17] job didn't do anything wrong right he
[14:18] was just being tested but this man who
[14:20] did the sexual sin give him over to
[14:22] Satan let let Satan take his health away
[14:24] so that his soul could be saved that in
[14:27] that in that position of laying in a hos
[14:29] hosital or laying in a whatever a drug
[14:30] house on your back and dying whatever it
[14:32] be in that moment he could repent of his
[14:34] sins and actually get saved
[14:38] Hallelujah Paul wasn't playing games
[14:40] with sin he didn't play games with sin
[14:42] in the
[14:43] church but that that's a it's a less
[14:46] difficult thing than than getting into
[14:49] the deeper things of God with Revelation
[14:51] and the mysteries of
[14:53] God like we've been preaching on the
[14:55] Rapture that's a mystery that's very
[14:57] difficult for many people understand
[14:58] because you have to know know the
[14:59] secrets of God the mystery of the
[15:01] revelation of God you have to know the
[15:03] mind of God the timeline of God the
[15:06] understanding of God's terms and
[15:07] definitions you have to know that it's a
[15:09] deeper thing but why would why would
[15:12] Paul preach about the Rapture if the
[15:13] people are living in sexual sin they're
[15:15] not even ready for the Rapture first
[15:16] they got to get cleaned up so they can
[15:18] be ready for the
[15:20] Rapture so you know there's there's
[15:22] deeper truths of the Christian faith
[15:24] that are hard to understand yet the
[15:27] spirit of God searches the Deep things
[15:29] of God it searches all
[15:30] things so see that's why we got to spend
[15:33] we got to keep spending a lot of time in
[15:35] the word of God right we got to search
[15:37] the scriptures I'm reading through uh
[15:39] Ezekiel it's been a tremendous blessing
[15:41] I'm amazed at all that God had Ezekiel
[15:43] prophesy I just read in chapter 23 uh
[15:46] and and and God said thus sayith the
[15:48] Lord Ezekiel tell them all their
[15:51] Abominations in their sight and so he
[15:53] names uh sexual sin
[15:56] adultery uh abortion basically burning
[15:58] babies is what they did back then they
[15:59] burn the babies as a sacrifice to a
[16:01] false god and he names uh they're taking
[16:04] too much interest on people like all
[16:06] these Abominations he just lays them out
[16:08] and I'm like if that isn't America I
[16:09] don't know what is
[16:12] right right but thank God there's a
[16:14] small Remnant God always protects the
[16:15] remnant praise God that even though most
[16:18] people are giving over to sin that
[16:19] doesn't discourage me because I know God
[16:21] always protects those that want to live
[16:23] holy Hallelujah God will not the suff
[16:26] God will not suffer the righteous to be
[16:28] punished with the the wicked Hallelujah
[16:30] so we're encouraged Hallelujah God sees
[16:32] our our our efforts to please him and
[16:34] love him God sees it
[16:37] Hallelujah and you know uh and brother
[16:39] brandom you know the prophet that we
[16:41] believe God sent to this generation of
[16:42] course passed away in 1965 he said the
[16:45] meat doctrines were like predestination
[16:47] out of Romans chapter 8 speaks of
[16:48] predestination election is a meat
[16:50] Doctrine it's a meat Doctrine it's a
[16:52] very uh thick it's a it's a hard
[16:55] understanding thing to understand takes
[16:56] a lot of chewing a lot of thinking a lot
[16:58] of praying CU we we're either drinking
[17:01] milk or chewing the meat of the word of
[17:03] God also sitting in Heavenly places and
[17:07] all the writings Paul wrote to the
[17:08] Ephesian Church those were deep
[17:10] Mysteries like the mystery of the Jew
[17:12] and Gentile they used to be two separate
[17:13] now they're one church that's a deep
[17:15] that's a deep teaching it's a deep
[17:17] understanding because a lot of people
[17:19] think oh God's just done with Israel and
[17:21] Israel is the synagogue of Satan you
[17:23] know they misunderstand scriptures in
[17:24] the Book of
[17:26] Revelation now most of Israel's lost
[17:28] just like mes most of the Gentiles are
[17:29] lost but Israel will have a a faithful
[17:33] remnant of 144,000 the Bible tells us
[17:36] that in Revelation 7 Hallelujah so again
[17:39] there's a remnant of Israel there's a
[17:41] remnant of the Gentiles there's always a
[17:43] small group that really love God and
[17:45] really want to please him
[17:47] Hallelujah there are deep things of
[17:49] course many deep
[17:51] things uh the the writer of Hebrews the
[17:53] author of Hebrews said the same thing we
[17:55] believe it was likely Paul because he
[17:57] says almost the same thing
[17:59] um he said the Hebrews there couldn't
[18:02] handle the Deep teachings like
[18:04] MDC right that's a deep teaching uh on
[18:07] the godhead and Hebrews 5 and chapter 6
[18:10] list some Elementary teachings so I
[18:13] would like AAA if you put that up there
[18:14] Hebrews 5:14 up
[18:16] there thank you
[18:20] hun and so Paul We believe this is Paul
[18:23] I'm not going to argue about it with
[18:24] anybody because he doesn't say his name
[18:25] in the letter but uh just it looks like
[18:27] the very same language but strong meat
[18:29] belongeth to them who are full age even
[18:31] those who by reason of their senses are
[18:34] exercised to discern between good and
[18:36] evil so other words a mature Christian
[18:38] in their everyday life they're
[18:40] constantly trying to figure out is this
[18:42] good or is this evil that's a mature
[18:44] Christian but the Christian that just
[18:46] goes headlong into sin that's an
[18:48] immature Christian that's a baby
[18:50] Christian they just think oh it's okay
[18:52] for me to uh get drunk it's okay to me
[18:54] for me to have sexual immorality it's
[18:56] okay for me to think I'm greater and
[18:57] debate who's the greatest preacher
[18:58] forever it's okay for me to sue people I
[19:01] mean that's that's uh
[19:04] immaturity right that that's a that's a
[19:06] baby
[19:07] Christian chapter 6 verse one uh two and
[19:12] three give us six these are baby
[19:15] doctrines here but again I want to
[19:16] remind you this so you can see it six
[19:18] baby doctrines therefore leaving the
[19:20] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[19:21] us go on to Perfection not laying again
[19:23] the foundation of repentance from dead
[19:25] works that's the first baby Doctrine you
[19:28] can't be a Christian say well it's okay
[19:29] for me to sin Jesus Loves Me no you have
[19:32] to repent from your dead Works
[19:35] Hallelujah and that's what most churches
[19:37] don't even get that baby
[19:39] Doctrine they let them smoke drink get
[19:42] drunk do drugs adultery marri two three
[19:45] four times you know they just they never
[19:47] get over that they never get over that
[19:48] they let them cuss and swear watch
[19:50] filthy movies uh I mean they just never
[19:52] even get to this Elementary
[19:55] teaching uh Paul said he that names the
[19:58] name of the
[19:59] he that names the name of Christ let him
[20:01] depart from
[20:02] iniquity if you call if you call
[20:04] yourself by Christ's name Christian then
[20:06] leave all sin and the church said a
[20:09] Christian wants to leave all sin because
[20:12] the sin is what had been put on Christ
[20:14] that sin is what caused to be crucified
[20:16] our Lord was bruised because of the sin
[20:18] so so sin breaks our heart and we don't
[20:21] want to sin we don't want to uh we we we
[20:24] don't want to partake in the the works
[20:25] of darkness we want to live a holy life
[20:28] we want to please Jesus
[20:29] Hallelujah second is Faith toward God
[20:32] most people have faith toward their
[20:33] church or faith towards their finances
[20:35] right they trust in their finances most
[20:37] people trust in their finances or their
[20:38] preacher your faith is not in me your
[20:41] faith is not in the song leader or the S
[20:43] you know the musician your faith should
[20:44] be in Jesus Christ Alone hallelujah amen
[20:47] you hang around long enough I'm going to
[20:48] upset you I'm going to uh I'm going to
[20:50] let you down but Jesus Will Never Let
[20:52] You Down Hallelujah and guess what
[20:53] you'll let me down too not just me it
[20:57] works both ways Hallelujah we all fall
[20:59] short of God's Glory Hallelujah that's
[21:01] why our faith must be in Christ yes we
[21:03] honor one another we always give honor
[21:05] but our ultimate faith our trust TR
[21:07] faith is trust or Assurance our
[21:08] Assurance is in Jesus Christ
[21:11] alone that's the second and see that's
[21:13] is elementary and baptism there's at
[21:15] least three baptisms there's the baptism
[21:17] of the mind that's what the Old
[21:18] Testament Saints had the Bible said that
[21:19] they were filled with the spirit in the
[21:20] Old Testament then there's a baptism of
[21:22] the soul in the New Testament and then
[21:24] there's the water baptism there's more
[21:25] than one baptism and most churches don't
[21:27] even know that right they don't even
[21:29] know they're just babes they don't know
[21:32] it doesn't matter if I'm baptized or not
[21:33] doesn't even matter how I'm baptized
[21:35] what does it matter Jesus died for me he
[21:36] loves me that's true but Jesus has
[21:39] Doctrine too Jesus has instruction for
[21:41] you Jesus wants to teach you he said and
[21:43] Jesus said remember in the Great
[21:44] Commission in Matthew 28 he said go
[21:46] teach them to observe all my
[21:49] commands right teach them to observe
[21:52] whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I'm
[21:54] with you even to the end of 2024
[21:57] hallelujah amen in 2025 if the Lord T
[22:01] see laying on of hands most people don't
[22:03] understand that there is power in laying
[22:05] on your hands for Divine Healing there's
[22:07] power in that because it represents
[22:09] Christ laying his hands on you there's
[22:12] laying on a hands of also of ordaining
[22:15] people that we see that in the Bible
[22:17] they laid their hands on them they
[22:18] ordained the missionaries same thing for
[22:20] pastors and so forth there's power in
[22:22] that but most people don't have that
[22:24] understanding and of resurrection of the
[22:26] Dead most people don't know there's two
[22:27] resurrections there's the resurrection
[22:29] when the dead in Christ rise first and
[22:31] we which are alive meet them they go up
[22:33] first we meet them in the air but then
[22:35] after that is the seven-year tribulation
[22:37] period And then after that is Armageddon
[22:39] the Millennium and after the Millennium
[22:41] in gagam Magog then is the second
[22:42] Resurrection where all the sinners rise
[22:45] so in the first resurrection it's all
[22:46] the Holy Ghost filled Saints rise but
[22:48] it's only for Holy Ghost filled Saints
[22:51] but then there's a resurrection of the
[22:53] the the general Resurrection where
[22:55] everyone who ever lived gets resurrected
[22:57] there I want to be a part the first
[22:58] resurrection Hallelujah that's what I'm
[23:00] living for
[23:02] Hallelujah and then also Eternal
[23:04] judgment now this is what most churches
[23:06] miss most churches think God is going to
[23:07] punish people eternally that's insane
[23:11] it's impossible for someone to be
[23:13] punished for eternally because they
[23:14] don't have eternal
[23:16] life in order to have eternal life You
[23:18] Got to Believe In Christ and if these
[23:20] people are going to hell they don't
[23:21] believe in Christ right they didn't have
[23:22] faith in Christ so they can't be burned
[23:24] eternally the Bible says that no murder
[23:27] hath eternal life therefore the murderer
[23:29] can't burn
[23:30] eternally but see this is and this is
[23:33] baby this is baby
[23:35] Doctrine this is baby think about that
[23:38] most churches you walk in there Mo most
[23:40] churches just uh spiritually they got a
[23:42] baby on this Pew baby on that one b and
[23:44] I'll tell you babies are cute baby here
[23:46] baby there and now think about 400
[23:48] people or 500 people in the congregation
[23:49] most churches they're just little babies
[23:51] there that's what's the preacher got to
[23:52] give them John 3:16 hey that's good milk
[23:56] that that milk tasted good when I got
[23:57] saved
[23:59] Hallelujah love your neighbor that's
[24:00] real good too The Lord's Prayer that's
[24:03] good I like that's good that's good milk
[24:05] that's that's
[24:06] delicious but that's what but they don't
[24:08] go on to the deeper things of
[24:10] God see we should be thankful that God
[24:13] feeds us meat in the house of the Lord
[24:15] hallelujah because Paul said I can't
[24:16] even preach to you the the the the Deep
[24:19] things of God because you have all this
[24:21] sin in your life a bunch of babies in
[24:24] the church now I'm not saying that in a
[24:25] mean way I'm just saying that they're
[24:27] not growing into into the things of God
[24:29] that they're living in sin when they
[24:30] shouldn't live in sin I'm not trying to
[24:33] be upset here you know what I mean I'm
[24:34] not trying to I'm not trying to be
[24:35] critical is what I'm trying to say
[24:38] because uh remember a lot of these
[24:40] people eventually fall away put up
[24:42] Hebrews 6
[24:43] verse6 see if if and Paul says if if
[24:46] people don't go if they just stay as
[24:47] babies many of them will fall
[24:50] away if they shall fall away to renew
[24:52] them again to repent seeing They
[24:54] Crucified to themselves the Son of God
[24:55] aresh and put him to an open shame so
[24:58] they walk out say I'm a Christian
[24:59] where's my K's light or where's my Bud
[25:02] Light and they get drunk and if they
[25:03] keep going that way they could fall away
[25:07] Hallelujah because they're babies they
[25:09] don't go on you must repent from all the
[25:11] dead
[25:12] Works Hallelujah but see they're not
[25:15] that people aren't taught that preachers
[25:17] are afraid to preach it because they
[25:18] have a small Church like ours well
[25:19] there's some good things about having a
[25:21] small Church
[25:23] Hallelujah God's not always in the big
[25:25] things Hallelujah there's good things
[25:27] about it
[25:29] and Jesus as we we know Jesus even said
[25:31] he said fear not little flock it's your
[25:34] father's Good Will to give you the
[25:35] Kingdom so Jesus tells us plainly a lot
[25:38] of times he gives the kingdom he gives
[25:39] the rulership The Authority the
[25:40] government he gives the the power and
[25:42] the authority of the church to a small
[25:44] little group
[25:46] Hallelujah and when people sin they call
[25:48] themselves Christians and they openly
[25:49] sin in front of everybody I can do this
[25:51] it doesn't hurt me to do this it doesn't
[25:53] well it hurts Christ I know that and it
[25:55] hurts your walk right hurt hurts your
[25:57] testimony a lot of those people
[25:59] eventually fall away that's right I've
[26:01] seen it over the years I've been a
[26:03] Christian since 2000 so I've been a
[26:04] Christian 24 years I've seen a lot of my
[26:06] friends who said they were Christians
[26:07] Fall Away They don't serve God anymore
[26:10] why because they never got past the baby
[26:12] milk they never got past that and grew
[26:15] up and became a real strong Christian
[26:17] God help us to be strong tonight
[26:18] hallelujah amen now verse three First
[26:22] Corinthians 3:3 what a Thanksgiving
[26:24] message here for ye are yet carnal for
[26:28] whereas there is among you envy now here
[26:30] he goes into some specific
[26:34] sins how do you know a church is a a
[26:37] baby church because they Envy one
[26:39] another oh if I wish I could just have
[26:41] what that sister has if I just could
[26:43] have what that brother has and I can't
[26:45] believe they have that position and I
[26:46] want that position right or money or
[26:49] whatever they got or that husband or
[26:50] that wife you know what I mean or that
[26:52] house or that car or that that job my
[26:55] where' they get that job you know
[26:57] anytime there's ening in the church it
[26:58] shows
[26:59] immaturity that's a baby Christian right
[27:02] and strife so actually coming out and
[27:05] debating that word strife means debate
[27:08] or
[27:08] competition well we'll see who's the
[27:10] best piano player Malachi we'll see
[27:12] right now let me show you what I
[27:14] practiced this week I'd never win we
[27:17] know
[27:18] that but competition debating and
[27:21] divisions means dissension or sedition
[27:23] someone uh purposely making this person
[27:26] think bad about that person gossip
[27:29] right this is this is this is not mature
[27:32] Christianity he said are you not carnal
[27:34] and walk as
[27:35] men now see they're not walking as Sons
[27:38] and Daughters of God they're walking as
[27:40] just any other beastly person would or
[27:42] any other human would right second Peter
[27:46] 2:12 says it but these As Natural brute
[27:49] beasts right so Paul says you're walking
[27:51] as men not as Sons and Daughters of God
[27:53] As Natural brute beasts made to be taken
[27:55] and destroyed now this speaking of evil
[27:57] people but I'm getting the point that
[27:59] Paul I'm sorry this is Peter Peter calls
[28:02] them uh beasts these men and women are
[28:05] beasts because they're not obedient to
[28:07] the spirit of
[28:08] God right there's nothing better there's
[28:10] nothing different between a sinful man a
[28:12] man that'll be a hormonger they go who
[28:14] go sleep with like 10 women in a in a
[28:16] lifetime there's nothing difference
[28:18] between him and any old dirty animal
[28:20] that would sleep around right there's no
[28:23] there's no different they're brute
[28:25] beasts and Paul says you're acting like
[28:27] men you shouldn't act like men or humans
[28:29] you should act like children of God
[28:31] hallelujah amen right children of God
[28:36] hallelujah let's not be divided let's
[28:38] not have strife and debates and envying
[28:41] uh envying is jealousy where's Eden Eden
[28:42] had a good question on that one let's
[28:44] not be jealous let's be thankful for
[28:45] other let's be happy for other people
[28:47] because you know if you're happy for
[28:48] them God's going to bring it around for
[28:49] you
[28:50] Hallelujah right and again even as I
[28:52] said earlier even if God doesn't he
[28:54] still died on the cross for me I'm going
[28:56] to heaven hallelujah what do I to be say
[28:58] about amen what do I to be uh the victim
[29:00] mentality for I'm already saved I'm on
[29:02] my way to heaven I'm shouting the
[29:04] victory
[29:05] Hallelujah that's
[29:08] right verse four 1 Corinthians
[29:13] 3:4 for a while one saith now he says so
[29:16] so you got debate you got Envy you got
[29:18] jealousy and you have this in the church
[29:20] for one says I'm a Paul Paul save Paul
[29:24] preached and I got saved under Paul's
[29:25] Ministry another says I'm of Apollo
[29:28] Apollos was a lot more eloquent remember
[29:29] he was one of the best spoken preachers
[29:32] he was he never stuttered like me he
[29:34] never spit he never forgot verses he
[29:37] just he was El and thank God for people
[29:39] like that thank God we got some good
[29:40] Christian preachers like that I'm
[29:42] thankful Paul said but he Paul said
[29:44] remember he said I come in Weak and
[29:45] trembling in fear so Paul came that way
[29:47] to the Corinthians he was real humble I
[29:49] don't want to say the wrong thing Saints
[29:51] now listen now you got to get this
[29:52] sexual sin out of the church but but
[29:55] Apollo's come up and every word flowed
[29:58] together and it was just beautiful
[30:02] eloquence made you want to say who's
[30:04] that guy up there what a man what a
[30:06] preacher but that was God's way God had
[30:09] these different kinds of gifts in the
[30:10] church but see when you think I'm better
[30:12] because of I'm under this preacher or I
[30:14] got saved on that preacher he says
[30:16] aren't you carnal aren't you just uh I
[30:19] think the word what what was the word
[30:21] for
[30:21] carnal give me another word uh oh yeah
[30:24] yeah animal appetite that's what it is
[30:26] in the Greek the aren't you just an
[30:28] animal right we see the chickens they're
[30:30] always fighting over food right that's
[30:32] what these church members are arguing
[30:34] over who's the who's the best right
[30:36] right hav who's who who's got who's the
[30:40] stronger uh believer who who's got the
[30:42] the more famous preacher amongst them
[30:44] just like a bunch of chickens fighting
[30:46] over some food right right that's what
[30:48] say animal appetites that's what it is
[30:53] right and notice Church they're using
[30:55] their words remember they use their
[30:56] words to debate show their jealousy uh
[30:59] show their
[31:00] envy and now they're using their words
[31:03] I'm a Paul I'm of
[31:04] Apollos and they're using their words to
[31:07] cause divisions we should use our words
[31:09] to bring
[31:11] Unity because remember the power of life
[31:14] and death is in the tongue or I'll say
[31:16] it in the thumbs if you text like this
[31:19] or maybe you're like one of those old
[31:21] time I saw my brother say I'm yesterday
[31:22] he's
[31:24] like because he he's and I'm not making
[31:26] fun of him because he always says that
[31:27] he's he says Jess I don't like to text
[31:30] it took him a while to get a smartphone
[31:31] now he's
[31:33] like I'm like brother speed up man come
[31:35] on let me do it let me text for
[31:38] you no I'm just kidding he's a he's a
[31:41] he's a sweetheart I love my brother Sam
[31:43] what what a good good man there's power
[31:45] in the life I'm sorry there's power of
[31:47] life and death in the tongue or in your
[31:49] text or in your emails or in your
[31:51] YouTube videos or in your Instagram
[31:53] posts or your Tik toks whatever it is
[31:55] there's power and so we must use our
[31:57] power we must use the power of the Holy
[31:59] Spirit to bring life to people verse 5 1
[32:02] Corinthians 3:5 who then is Paul that's
[32:04] a good question who is
[32:07] Paul who is
[32:09] Apollos put your favorite preacher in
[32:11] there who
[32:12] is does that sound familiar that sounds
[32:16] like when God came down to job and said
[32:18] who is
[32:19] this who is this huh I see God and Paul
[32:23] saying the both both the same thing who
[32:24] are we brother R would say it like this
[32:27] brother said who who are you he said
[32:28] you're a pile of Indiana dust now we're
[32:31] a pile of Ohio dust there's my 30
[32:35] minutes I'm GNA go a little over 30
[32:36] today usually go an hour said he said
[32:40] you're just a six you're six feet2 of
[32:41] Ohio
[32:43] dust I'm
[32:45] 5'11 of Ohio dust now we're saying that
[32:49] to be humble who are we I mean
[32:51] what where do we come
[32:54] from are we are we the great ones and
[32:57] that's what Paul's saying why you're
[32:58] arguing about which preacher saved you
[33:00] or not Sav you but preached you so it
[33:02] could be saved Paul says the same thing
[33:04] as God said to Job who is this who who
[33:06] who are they why why are you so
[33:09] concerned about human beings who are
[33:11] they they're servants he says they're
[33:13] ministers by whom you believed who are
[33:16] they they're just God's servants now
[33:18] church I want to bring the balance uh
[33:20] the Bible says give them that labor in
[33:22] the doctrine double
[33:23] honor so see in in a carnal Church he's
[33:27] got to he's got to bring the people down
[33:28] stop magnifying these men but once you
[33:30] get mature then the mature people want
[33:32] to say yes I want to honor brother so
[33:34] and so or sister so and so see what see
[33:36] what I mean it depends where the people
[33:38] are at if they're worshiping if they're
[33:40] worshiping preachers are worshiping
[33:41] their favorite brother or sister then
[33:43] you got to bring them down and say
[33:44] they're they're nobody we're nothing but
[33:46] then when you get mature and you get
[33:47] respectful let's give honor to brother
[33:49] Diggs let's give honor to brother
[33:52] McBride it's not worship it's just we're
[33:54] mature now and we realize they just
[33:57] yield to God and God blesses their
[34:00] sacrifice
[34:03] amen who who are they they're ministers
[34:06] they're servants they're your servants
[34:07] they're the people that serve you but
[34:10] God is the leader God's the sender
[34:12] Hallelujah they're The Messengers God's
[34:15] the sender God is the
[34:17] message the lord gave you servants
[34:20] ministers so he's the great one because
[34:22] for God so loved he gave the giver is
[34:26] the great one Hallelujah
[34:28] God's the great one because God said who
[34:31] is this job who who's this he didn't say
[34:33] job he said who is this
[34:36] Hallelujah The Giver is the great one
[34:38] and it's as true as as as as us as well
[34:41] when we give of ourselves when we
[34:42] sacrifice for others that is great in
[34:44] the eyes of God when we live for other
[34:47] people and we don't live for
[34:49] ourselves
[34:53] Hallelujah that's a good question who is
[34:55] this right who is this
[34:58] like everybody's excited about Trump now
[34:59] who is this God would say who's this
[35:02] he's my servant I mean I'm thankful
[35:04] don't get me wrong I'm super thankful
[35:06] you you know me you know what I voted
[35:08] you know what I prayed you know you see
[35:10] me cry at the altar you see me cry in
[35:11] prayers you know you know me but who is
[35:13] this like it's it's just God's servant
[35:15] and God can use a servant whatever way
[35:17] he wants right I I don't know if he's
[35:20] saved who knows if he's even saved but
[35:21] God's protecting him God's using
[35:24] them verse six I have planted a watered
[35:28] but God gave the increase so see it's
[35:31] okay for preachers to say boy I remember
[35:33] when I preached that and it just sunk
[35:34] right down into Austin's heart about
[35:36] Abraham I remember that brother it just
[35:38] planted it right there in your heart and
[35:40] aw will tell me I remember brother cam
[35:42] preach that restoration message that was
[35:43] just plant it right there in my heart
[35:45] it's okay for preachers to say yes God
[35:47] used me to plant that sermon on the fear
[35:49] of the Lord right or uh God used brother
[35:52] Simon to come around and that watered oh
[35:54] uh that message just watered it just
[35:56] gave me uh life it just refreshed me God
[35:59] used that different preacher to water
[36:01] that seed that was in my soul it's okay
[36:03] to say that because Paul said I did this
[36:05] I planted apilus water but God gives the
[36:08] one God's the one who gives
[36:10] growth the preacher didn't make you grow
[36:13] it's God's spirit that made you grow the
[36:15] Preachers did their component their part
[36:17] of it to either plant or water but God's
[36:20] spirit had to come around and make that
[36:22] thing grow so you could see growth in
[36:24] your life Hallelujah
[36:27] so man just does his part the word grow
[36:29] means to give increase I'm sorry God
[36:31] gave increase it means to grow to grow
[36:33] up to increase to become
[36:36] greater now I'm not calling everybody
[36:38] great here tonight but just you you get
[36:41] uh more like God you become more like
[36:43] God more yielded to God your character
[36:46] is more like
[36:48] Christ means to grow to
[36:50] increase see so it's fine for ministers
[36:53] to say yes the Lord had me preach that
[36:54] message there uh the Lord let a little
[36:57] outpour when I preach that the Lord
[36:59] poured down but then God gave the
[37:02] increase remember the seed is the word
[37:05] Jesus says in Luke chapter 11 the seed
[37:07] is the word so God gives the word to the
[37:09] preacher he preaches it and sometimes
[37:10] it'll get planted right there in your
[37:12] spirit right and then God another
[37:14] preacher come around and water it and
[37:15] then God makes it
[37:17] grow so God alone gives the life God
[37:20] alone gives the growth to the seed that
[37:22] you've heard Hallelujah so we don't give
[37:25] that to credit we don't give credit to
[37:26] anybody oh it was all brother Jesse's uh
[37:29] work that that I'm the Christian I am
[37:30] today it actually was none of mine I I I
[37:33] don't give any increase God gives the
[37:36] increase right Hallelujah so you have to
[37:39] keep the right balance we got to uh keep
[37:41] the right understanding of the
[37:42] placements of the preachers and the
[37:44] placements of every individual gift in
[37:46] the church Hallelujah preachers plant
[37:48] their sermons go down deep in our
[37:50] Spirits another preacher will come down
[37:52] and God will pour out the spirit to give
[37:55] water to that seed God will pour out
[37:57] understanding to you God will pour out
[37:59] wisdom God will pour out knowledge God
[38:01] will pour out faith God will pour out
[38:03] grace through a sermon but God has to
[38:05] make that grow in your life Hallelujah
[38:08] and I'll tell you you'll find out if it
[38:09] grew on Monday or Tuesday morning or
[38:11] definitely by
[38:13] Wednesday definitely you have a battle
[38:14] by Wednesday morning if you if you
[38:16] haven't had by Monday or Tuesday right
[38:18] you'll be tested on what you said to
[38:19] Amen in the church sometimes we're
[38:21] tested on Sunday night right after
[38:24] church right but you'll know oh I over
[38:27] come this time ah God gave me the
[38:29] increase hallelujah thank you Lord
[38:33] hallelujah 1 Corinthians
[38:38] 37 and eight so what's Paul's conclusion
[38:42] to these people that argue about who's
[38:43] the greatest preacher and and debating
[38:45] and all these things and jealous and
[38:47] what's his solution so then neither is
[38:49] he that planteth anything that word
[38:52] means certain he's not any certain
[38:54] thing neither he that WTH
[38:57] but God that giveth the increase so
[39:01] God's the special one in all this right
[39:05] the same is true just we know some
[39:07] people had a garden last year right
[39:09] thank God for the people that planted
[39:10] the the uh the seeds thank God for the
[39:13] people that come by a water Caris how
[39:14] many times did you water your garden
[39:16] this summer a lot almost every day now
[39:18] you got a good increase right but you
[39:20] know you could have done you could have
[39:21] done the planting the watering but if
[39:23] God doesn't shine upon that seed if God
[39:25] doesn't give life to that seed does
[39:27] nothing happens right same same thing in
[39:29] the spiritual so really he that plants
[39:33] of waters they're really not anything
[39:34] they're not any certain special thing
[39:36] God has to give life to the
[39:39] seed but we see in verse eight though
[39:41] there is some Unity God there is Unity
[39:44] there is Oneness now he that plants and
[39:46] Waters are one so all these preachers
[39:47] are just the same we're all just
[39:49] servants we're all just ministers we're
[39:51] all doing our part so God can give us
[39:53] life Hallelujah so God can make us grow
[39:57] I Hope Church you come to the end of
[39:58] 2024 and you can say without a shadow of
[40:01] a doubt I've grown in Christ this year
[40:03] if not it's time to receive some water
[40:05] it's time to get some seed planted in
[40:07] your heart Hallelujah if we don't grow
[40:10] it's not God's fault it's our
[40:13] fault
[40:16] Hallelujah I love this now he brings it
[40:18] down to
[40:19] this now he that planteth and WTH that
[40:23] WTH are one so they're unified they
[40:25] they're just they're doing the same work
[40:26] they're working working to get uh to
[40:28] allow God's spirit to fall and God's
[40:31] spirit to give growth and every man
[40:33] shall receive his own reward according
[40:35] to his own labor so God brings it back
[40:37] down to the individual level preachers
[40:40] are one and we're United in that we
[40:43] we're not anything certainly special
[40:46] right we're not we cannot cause any
[40:48] growth so if people are trusting in a
[40:49] preacher to give them growth it's
[40:51] impossible only God gives
[40:54] growth the preacher can put the seed
[40:56] there the preacher can water right there
[40:58] but God has to shine upon that and God
[41:00] has to cause it to grow
[41:02] Hallelujah only God can cause you to
[41:04] grow only God can give you an increase
[41:08] but you got to have the right conditions
[41:09] of your heart right that's the parable
[41:11] the T the four seeds the four the four
[41:13] sers that's the parable you got you and
[41:16] I got to keep the weeds amen we got to
[41:18] keep the cares of life out of our
[41:20] hearts we got to spiritually weed all
[41:22] the time take anything we're caring
[41:24] about too much things we're thinking
[41:25] about too much that don't apply to God
[41:27] any sins in life we got to root that
[41:29] out and put our hearts in a condition so
[41:32] when the word uh when the spirit and the
[41:34] seed and the water and the light all
[41:36] comes together we have some growth we
[41:37] became better Christians hallelujah amen
[41:40] by the grace of God and then God gets
[41:41] the glory and every man will be rewarded
[41:44] for his own
[41:46] labor hallelujah look at my time here
[41:50] let
[41:50] me every preacher will be rewarded for
[41:53] his own
[41:54] labor so there's individual Rewards
[41:58] Hallelujah like we see in the military
[42:00] you know we see it uh sometimes the
[42:01] president will put a purple medal around
[42:03] people and the Medal of Honor medal of
[42:05] freedom metal all these things there's
[42:06] individual rewards right but then
[42:08] there's group rewards too but here we
[42:11] can see there's individual rewards if we
[42:13] labor honestly if we labor sincerely God
[42:17] will give us a reward for that
[42:19] Hallelujah I just put out a video I'm
[42:21] not I don't have time I I was thought
[42:23] thought I might have time I'm not going
[42:24] to have time uh I put out a video a few
[42:26] weeks ago about the Judgment seat of
[42:28] Christ the Bible Paul says all people
[42:31] will stand before the Judgment seat of
[42:32] Christ to receive what you've done in
[42:34] your
[42:35] body so every person will come up let's
[42:38] say this is the Throne of God every
[42:39] person will call your name called
[42:41] Malachi Smith yes
[42:43] sir here's what you've done in your body
[42:46] right Jesse Smith come before the Throne
[42:49] of God and I'll receive here's what you
[42:51] did in your body and remember they might
[42:53] show us a screen there might be a screen
[42:54] in heaven with all the things that we
[42:57] did and Jesus is going to say either
[43:00] well done or I never knew
[43:02] you so we need to know Christ Hallelujah
[43:07] we need to know him and know his word so
[43:09] well that no man can deceive us
[43:12] hallelujah right he's either going to
[43:14] say Well done you invested your whole
[43:16] life in the word of God or he's going to
[43:18] say depart from me I never knew you
[43:21] because you worked iniquity iniquity is
[43:23] lawlessness in other words nobody could
[43:25] tell you even though the Bible said it
[43:26] you just went ahead and did whatever you
[43:28] want God help us to be obedient
[43:30] Hallelujah CU that's that's the final
[43:32] thing it's either comes down to either
[43:34] you invested in the in the ways of God
[43:36] well done Malachi well done Jesse well
[43:39] done Austin I can name all the brothers
[43:41] here tonight all you do all the sisters
[43:43] next week or depart from me I never knew
[43:46] you those are the worst words we brother
[43:48] man said the best words you want to hear
[43:49] are well done good and faithful servant
[43:52] the worst words would be I never knew
[43:55] you we want to know Jesus in the power
[43:57] of his
[43:58] resurrection now if you're not a
[44:00] preacher it's it's it's simple as well
[44:02] what are you supposed to do as a
[44:04] Christian if you do what you're supposed
[44:07] to do then Jesus will say Well done my
[44:10] good and faithful servant Hallelujah so
[44:13] if you're married what are you supposed
[44:13] to do love your spouse if you're a wife
[44:16] submitting everything as long as it all
[44:18] lines up with the word of God right if
[44:20] you're the man you better love that wife
[44:21] as Christ loved the church don't love
[44:24] yourself love your wife right if you got
[44:27] children train them up in the ways of
[44:28] God
[44:29] hallelujah right whatever whatever God's
[44:31] called you whatever job whatever talents
[44:33] God has placed in your life use it for
[44:35] the glory of God say Lord I did this I
[44:36] did this to glorify you I helped out as
[44:38] many as I could I donated here I I did
[44:40] all these things that remember do it in
[44:42] secret and if you do it the way Jesus
[44:44] tells you he'll say Well done my good
[44:46] and faithful servant you've been
[44:47] Faithful over a few things I'll make you
[44:49] ruler over
[44:50] much we just got to be faithful with a
[44:53] few things in our life Hallelujah but I
[44:56] don't have to time to go that cuz I want
[44:57] to go this
[44:59] way so see there's going to be a uh a
[45:02] reward and now later in this chapter um
[45:05] there's going to be a fire go down to
[45:08] verse
[45:09] 13 Every Man's work shall be made
[45:11] manifest for the day shall declare it
[45:12] because it be revealed by fire our God
[45:15] is a consuming fire so in the presence
[45:17] of Jesus when you come up to the throne
[45:18] the presence is going to be like a fire
[45:20] right he might have a he might have a
[45:21] theophany body he might look like an
[45:23] Ancient of Days old man with white hair
[45:24] like fire in his eyes there's the fire
[45:28] but the fire of the eyes of Christ you
[45:31] won't be able to lie there you won't be
[45:32] able to hide anything that's why we
[45:33] better confess everything right now by
[45:35] God's grace trust that the blood of
[45:37] Jesus Christ forgives us of all sin
[45:39] now and strive with all we have to live
[45:42] pure before God but see the the fire
[45:44] will declare the eyes of Jesus Will
[45:46] declare Our Lives we won't be able to
[45:49] lie or uh small small white lies we
[45:52] won't be able to do it there's you won't
[45:53] you won't have any opportunity to do
[45:55] that in the presence of Christ
[45:57] everything uh that you've done will be
[46:00] revealed by fire what type of work was
[46:03] it what type of ministry was it what
[46:05] kind of man were you what kind of woman
[46:06] were you there's no other
[46:12] genders whatever you were it'll be
[46:14] revealed by fire because you can't lie
[46:17] to Jesus Christ
[46:20] Hallelujah and so I'm going to bring
[46:21] this down for a little my little
[46:22] testimony I just felt let the Lord to
[46:24] share this here
[46:28] you know uh when I first got saved of
[46:30] course uh I was part of the Assemblies
[46:32] of God Church
[46:38] um but but I I started to finding out
[46:40] right away
[46:43] um do I join this church or not and I
[46:46] found out you have they said you have to
[46:47] speak in tongues to be to be filled with
[46:49] the spirit I was like no the Bible says
[46:51] it right here Pastor he said well that's
[46:52] just what we believe so I said see you
[46:54] later I'm not can't can't be a part of
[46:55] your church that's what the Bible says
[46:57] and then went to the chapel for numerous
[46:58] years that was a great church but then
[47:00] when it come down to this with the
[47:01] godhead and water baptism we disagreed
[47:04] now listen church I'm going to be judged
[47:06] by what I preach right the Bible said it
[47:09] my my preaching my Ministry is going to
[47:11] be judged by fire the fiery eyes of
[47:15] Christ and I'm going to each and each
[47:17] one of you you're going to get a reward
[47:19] for what you've done for Christ so I've
[47:21] had to take a stand you've had to take a
[47:23] stand on certain things in your
[47:24] life and sometimes Jesus even said he
[47:27] said I don't come to bring peace on the
[47:28] earth I come to bring a sword Hallelujah
[47:31] in in Matthew chapter 10 I'll turn your
[47:32] your your mother-in-law against your
[47:34] your your your daughter-in-law I'll turn
[47:36] the the father against the son the
[47:37] brother against the sister I'll turn all
[47:39] these things because I want to see who
[47:40] really loves the truth
[47:42] hallelujah and so this was a thing that
[47:44] separated me from of course the
[47:46] Assemblies of God and when I went to the
[47:47] chapel I still love those people I
[47:49] always love those
[47:50] people but just as a few examples here
[47:53] um you know when I went to these other
[47:57] churches they said God was three
[47:59] persons but the Bible doesn't say God is
[48:02] three persons and then my trinitarian
[48:04] friends said I was a heretic for not
[48:06] believing in the Trinity did you ever
[48:08] ever did I show ever show you this video
[48:10] the godhead is the father son Holy Ghost
[48:12] right ever show that well we know the
[48:14] son we know the son was Jesus right now
[48:18] the Bible said it it pleased the father
[48:21] that in him Jesus should be all the
[48:23] fullness dwell so all that God was was
[48:25] in Christ
[48:28] right and then Colossians 2:9 says for
[48:30] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[48:32] godhead B so you have two two verses say
[48:34] all that God was was in
[48:36] Christ the Bible never says there's
[48:38] three
[48:40] persons so that means the father had to
[48:42] be in Christ because Jesus said the
[48:44] father is in me and the father that
[48:46] dwelleth in me he does the works so
[48:49] according to Jesus the father's in
[48:51] me is that
[48:53] right well don't the Bible also say the
[48:55] Holy Ghost was in Jes
[48:57] Jesus yes it says the spirit Abode on
[49:01] Jesus and the spirit remained on him and
[49:04] God giveth the spirit unto
[49:06] him well now he's got two persons inside
[49:09] of him is this guy a
[49:12] schizophrenic does he have multiple
[49:14] personality
[49:16] disorder
[49:17] no no the father and the Holy Ghost are
[49:20] the selfs same thing they're it's the
[49:22] eternal spirit of God hallelujah wait
[49:26] did I all I'm sorry I clicked the wrong
[49:28] button sorry I started all over let me
[49:31] fast forward if you put these verses
[49:34] together it's very plain and so I had to
[49:36] take a stand I to see well what am I
[49:38] what what do I believe well the Bible
[49:40] says God anointed Jesus with the Holy
[49:43] Ghost and with
[49:46] power right
[49:48] so the all all of God was in Jesus all
[49:51] of God so did were two other persons
[49:54] inside of a third person no
[49:57] it was the spirit was in the body of
[49:59] Flesh and I had to take a stand on that
[50:02] and I'm going to be judged by what I
[50:04] preached but do I do I have the Bible
[50:06] for that yes look look look at sometime
[50:10] look uh here here here's a
[50:13] concordance here's what I did with my
[50:15] friend I said type three persons into
[50:18] and search the Bible is there any verse
[50:19] that says God is three persons in the
[50:21] Bible no the Bible only has three
[50:24] persons in one verse Jeremiah 5
[50:27] 23 and it says all persons in the 3 and
[50:31] 20 20th year of Nebuchadnezzar that's
[50:33] not even talking about
[50:35] God it's not even talking about God it's
[50:38] not even in the Bible and I'm going to
[50:39] show you the Trinity Doctrine came over
[50:42] 200 years after the last Apostle died it
[50:44] wasn't even preached by the
[50:47] apostles and then my friends called me a
[50:50] heretic because I wouldn't add to the
[50:52] Bible well who's the real
[50:54] heretic those who stay with the Bible or
[50:56] those who added the
[50:58] Bible I heard somebody say adding to the
[51:00] Bible the real heretic is those who add
[51:03] things to the
[51:06] Bible so the Heretics are actually
[51:08] calling me the
[51:10] heretic that's okay I love them always
[51:15] well so the
[51:17] godhead and the Bible said there's one
[51:19] name for the godhead what's the name of
[51:21] God the Lord Jesus
[51:23] Christ that's why every person ever was
[51:26] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:28] Christ so I I don't I don't remember
[51:30] this the father Son and Holy Ghost are
[51:31] all manifested in one body the all of
[51:33] God was in Jesus the Bible says it twice
[51:36] let me show you the
[51:38] uh I I'm I have too many these are old
[51:40] animations I was just playing I was just
[51:42] playing around with him actually just
[51:43] trying to learn how to use animation all
[51:44] those years
[51:46] ago but then if people would
[51:49] understand uh you know my my friends at
[51:51] the chapel and the Assemblies of God
[51:53] said you got to be uh baptized in the
[51:55] titles father and Holy Ghost what that I
[51:58] R read the Bible no 10 days after Jesus
[52:01] said this Peter said baptize in the name
[52:03] of Jesus Christ but this remember this I
[52:06] had to take a stand I was separated I
[52:08] had to se I had to choose do I believe
[52:09] the Bible or do I believe somebody's uh
[52:12] theology degree with a doctorate degree
[52:14] behind
[52:16] it and yet some of those guys smoked
[52:18] cigarettes and some of those guys got
[52:19] drunk and some of those guys were
[52:21] married two three times now it makes it
[52:22] a lot easier to take the stand where I
[52:24] am now and the church said
[52:27] Hallelujah because they had a lot of
[52:29] leav shows their babes in Christ see the
[52:34] Bible also says water baptism was done
[52:36] in the name of the Lord Jesus in Acts
[52:38] 8:16 and then acts uh 10:48 he Peter
[52:42] said we were baptized in the name of the
[52:44] Lord and then Paul said we're baptized
[52:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus and then
[52:49] Paul says we're baptized in the name of
[52:50] the
[52:51] Lord and so by scripture alone what is
[52:54] the name of the father son Holy Ghost
[52:56] it's the Lord Jesus Christ but IAD take
[52:58] a
[52:59] stand and my preaching is going to be go
[53:02] through the fires of Christ well who
[53:03] wrote the Bible Christ amen what's the
[53:06] name for Christ he's the word of God
[53:08] hallelujah amen and if the way I baptize
[53:10] is in the word of God then that's the
[53:11] right way Hallelujah so see my other
[53:14] friends were telling me just do this and
[53:16] ignore all this Ah that's called taking
[53:18] away from the Bible see I can agree with
[53:21] I can agree with all that because 10
[53:22] days after Jesus said this listen Jesus
[53:24] spirit filled Peter and then Peter said
[53:26] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and
[53:29] the church said Hallelujah is that right
[53:33] is that right they were filled with the
[53:34] Holy Ghost and he said be baptized
[53:37] repent of your sins and be baptized in
[53:39] the name of Jesus Christ that's right
[53:41] church that's right I I was playing
[53:44] around with these animations you know
[53:45] this was from 2013 that's quite a while
[53:47] ago um there's just another way to look
[53:50] at it and remember church I have uh how
[53:53] many got here 14 I have 14 historical
[53:56] references now in all these I can zoom
[53:58] in I don't know if it'll let me do it
[53:59] here no it won't okay sorry it's just
[54:01] kind of stagnant
[54:02] there I have 14 I went through all these
[54:05] Bible almanacs Chris and I when before
[54:07] we were married we would take dates to
[54:09] the library I talk about a romantic
[54:13] Vagabond you're the most romantic guy I
[54:15] know Jesse yes I take my wife to the
[54:17] library so we can study Bible
[54:22] books maybe I got her supper after that
[54:25] or something like that
[54:27] but look you know all the books say the
[54:28] same thing they all say that water
[54:31] baptism was always done by the apostles
[54:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[54:35] then a hundred years after that they
[54:37] change it to father son Holy Ghost they
[54:40] all say that and I I I don't have time
[54:43] tonight I I'm already at my hour I could
[54:45] go through all
[54:46] these but see I've I've got a I've got
[54:49] to answer someday for what I preach and
[54:51] I want to preach the truth of God's
[54:54] word okay now I'm going to
[54:57] well I guess I guess that that actually
[54:58] might be helpful here so the the the
[55:01] baptism timeline from uh Resurrection to
[55:04] Pentecost Jesus was resurrected he was
[55:06] seen for 40 days so 40 days later after
[55:09] being seen he ascended and that's when
[55:12] he spoke he said baptize them in the
[55:14] name of the father son Holy Ghost right
[55:15] but 10 days later on the day of
[55:17] Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and then
[55:20] 3,000 were baptized in the name of Jesus
[55:24] Christ so there that this means there's
[55:26] one name to the father Son and Holy
[55:28] Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ he
[55:31] didn't say baptize them in the names of
[55:33] the Father Son and Holy Ghost because
[55:34] father's not a name son's not a name
[55:36] Holy Ghost is not a
[55:38] name like just like me I'm I'm I'm
[55:41] Haven's dad right I'm a dad I'm
[55:46] Christian's
[55:47] husband I'm your father uh I'm the son
[55:50] of Snookie and Ruby Smith I'm a father
[55:53] son brother husband how many people am I
[55:56] one how many names I got
[56:00] one right I can only sign my check with
[56:03] Jesse Smith I can't sign it with uh
[56:05] father brother husband Pastor teacher so
[56:08] so so so
[56:09] so
[56:12] failure stutterer spitter I can't I
[56:15] can't sign it like that bad joke teller
[56:17] dad bad dad joke teller I can't sound
[56:20] like that the same thing here 10 days
[56:22] later Jesus saying there's one name
[56:24] because remember there's one name the
[56:25] father son Holy Ghost was in one person
[56:27] what was his name Jesus Christ
[56:29] Hallelujah the fullness of godhead was
[56:31] in one man Jesus
[56:33] Christ and it was a mystery the Bible
[56:36] calls it a mystery the mystery of
[56:37] baptism is you baptize in the name of
[56:39] the one crucified amen that's in uh 1
[56:42] Corinthians chapter
[56:43] one all right I know I'm going long here
[56:45] I'm going try to okay so all those 14
[56:48] documents call this Lord Jesus Christ
[56:51] they call the apostolic baptism so Peter
[56:54] baptized um in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:57] around is 30 or 33 ad it's there there's
[57:00] just there's actually I personally
[57:01] believe now it's 30 so forgive me I've
[57:04] been growing in my little understanding
[57:05] of history but 26 years later Paul
[57:08] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:10] so all the apostles baptized the same
[57:13] way according to the Bible now 40 years
[57:15] later the false baptism formula was
[57:18] introduced the Liturgy baptism and the
[57:21] non- apostles so people that didn't know
[57:22] Jesus they start saying father son Holy
[57:24] Ghost because they didn't have the
[57:25] revelation
[57:27] that there's one name to the father Son
[57:29] and Holy Ghost there's only one person
[57:30] the godhead it's God right and he became
[57:33] flesh the word became flesh and dwelt
[57:35] among
[57:36] us hallelujah so so my friend said oh
[57:41] Jesse you need to baptized father and
[57:42] the Holy Ghost well that's not what the
[57:44] apostles did and they had the Holy Ghost
[57:46] these guys it's very questionable if
[57:47] they had the Holy
[57:49] Ghost and the church said right okay so
[57:53] again the apostolic baptism all the
[57:55] baptis in the book of Acts say to be
[57:57] baptized in the name of Jesus
[57:59] Christ and I've got to take a stand I'm
[58:02] I'm going to be judged by my preaching
[58:04] but see I feel confident over here I
[58:06] feel confident I have all these verses
[58:08] The Eyes Of Fire will will will burn out
[58:11] anything wrong I've done but it'll
[58:12] reveal that I preach the right baptism
[58:14] and the right godhead now is it
[58:16] mysterious yes Austin I we talking about
[58:18] that yes it's very mysterious how can
[58:20] God be one person but manifest in in a
[58:22] thousand way I'm sorry manifest in three
[58:24] ways right it's very mysterious but yet
[58:28] we can't add to the Bible and call God
[58:30] three
[58:32] persons right or else Jesus had was a
[58:35] person who had two people living inside
[58:36] of him well that wouldn't be very good
[58:39] would it to have two people Liv inside
[58:40] of you
[58:43] right just I don't want to be silly but
[58:45] it just doesn't make any sense
[58:48] right but everything we believe lines up
[58:50] with the
[58:51] scripture okay now here uh okay see yeah
[58:56] just again a
[58:59] visual I don't I'm not sure why I did
[59:01] all these I think I was to around now
[59:02] here's what I did today now here's with
[59:04] the word Trinity the word Trinity is not
[59:06] even in the Bible now I understand what
[59:08] it means three as one as long as you say
[59:11] that that's fine but once you say three
[59:13] persons in one now you got a problem
[59:16] because God never says I'm three
[59:18] persons the Bible doesn't say it look it
[59:20] up in the Bible doesn't say three
[59:22] persons and the Bible said don't add one
[59:24] word to the Bible right
[59:27] Jesus saidif you add one word the
[59:28] plagues will be added to you if you take
[59:30] one word away your name will be taken
[59:31] out of the book of life so it's a very
[59:33] serious thing so I I shrunk these down
[59:36] right so now we got 33 we got 100 200 3
[59:38] 325
[59:40] ad so the the B the apostles kept the
[59:43] baptism until people started
[59:45] interjecting their thoughts their
[59:47] misunderstanding of ma U Matthew
[59:49] 28:19 and then 80 years later theophus
[59:53] called God a Trias or a trinity tulian
[59:56] called him Trinitas in the Latin and
[59:59] then by 3:25 now they add three persons
[1:00:03] but the writer of our Bible Paul Peter
[1:00:06] they never called God three persons not
[1:00:08] one
[1:00:09] time now who's the heretic
[1:00:12] now they say Jesse you're the heretic
[1:00:15] I'm taking my side with the apostles I'm
[1:00:18] not taking my side with these other guys
[1:00:19] I'm taking my side with the men that
[1:00:20] wrote the
[1:00:22] Bible see that that and that's what
[1:00:24] people do when they're afraid they call
[1:00:27] names because they're afraid just like a
[1:00:30] wounded animal in a corner they're going
[1:00:31] to fight at you they're going to Claw at
[1:00:33] you that's what these preachers do when
[1:00:34] you got them in a corner and they're
[1:00:37] they know they're wrong well they they
[1:00:38] start name calling you well you're just
[1:00:40] a nobody you never went to school it
[1:00:42] doesn't matter what I went to As Long As
[1:00:43] I went to the upper room and got the
[1:00:45] Holy Ghost that's all that matters amen
[1:00:48] hallelujah and they go to school and
[1:00:50] they get corrupted and they learn all
[1:00:51] these lies most schools not every school
[1:00:53] most school all right
[1:00:57] I'm a little I'm almost at my hour here
[1:00:59] of preaching actual
[1:01:01] preaching see before I say I don't want
[1:01:03] to go along and then I want a few more
[1:01:05] minutes why do I keep changing my mind
[1:01:08] okay um okay now here's another one too
[1:01:11] you know uh with crossdressing when
[1:01:13] Chris and I first came uh out of uh
[1:01:16] Assemblies of God and Chapel we were
[1:01:18] introduced to how we dress now and the
[1:01:21] Bible says if you cross dress it's an
[1:01:22] Abomination that means it's a disgusting
[1:01:24] thing to God let me show you a more
[1:01:26] recent one here when we when Chris and I
[1:01:29] first became Christians we listened to
[1:01:30] this uh this uh group called cadman's
[1:01:34] call they were uh they had some really
[1:01:36] good
[1:01:37] songs well guess what they did a few
[1:01:38] years ago the lead singer and they all
[1:01:42] switched what genders now can anybody
[1:01:45] look at this and say that looks right in
[1:01:47] the sight of
[1:01:49] God doesn't look
[1:01:52] right now who would who would let that
[1:01:54] guy lead songs
[1:01:56] would we let that guy lead songs no he
[1:01:59] he's got something wrong up here right
[1:02:02] he doesn't know what he
[1:02:03] is and God said God said it's it's an
[1:02:08] Abomination for a man to put on a
[1:02:11] woman's
[1:02:12] garment
[1:02:14] right and so I've got to take a stand
[1:02:16] who am I going to stand with am i g to
[1:02:18] stand with the churches or I'm going to
[1:02:20] stand with Christ I got to stand with
[1:02:22] Christ now the the shock that we saw
[1:02:25] especially Chris and I we we liked
[1:02:26] cadman's call we like some of their
[1:02:28] songs I used to sing I thought praise
[1:02:30] the Lord what a great but imagine the
[1:02:33] shock when we saw this now the shock we
[1:02:35] saw with this was the same shock in
[1:02:37] 1930 when Marlene hebburn started
[1:02:40] wearing men's pants it was a same
[1:02:43] thing right same thing th these are
[1:02:47] equal that's equal to that she's wearing
[1:02:50] men's clothes he's wearing women's
[1:02:54] clothes and no one here is comfortable
[1:02:56] with a man dressing in woman's clothes
[1:02:58] and walking into the women's restroom no
[1:03:00] one's comfortable with
[1:03:02] that well
[1:03:04] then well then why why can she wear that
[1:03:07] if he can't wear that why can she wear
[1:03:10] that that's called a double
[1:03:12] standard and the church
[1:03:14] said see I had to take a stand my
[1:03:17] preaching is going to be Tried by fire
[1:03:18] gonna be Tried by the word of God am I
[1:03:21] standing on the word of God are we
[1:03:22] standing on the word of God or are we
[1:03:23] standing on the society
[1:03:27] who we trying to please here are we
[1:03:28] trying to please men or we trying to
[1:03:30] please God we trying to please

[1:03:57] to plant these truths in my heart and
[1:03:59] I'm very thankful for it and then God
[1:04:01] would use another preacher to come down
[1:04:03] come around and he'd water it oh and I
