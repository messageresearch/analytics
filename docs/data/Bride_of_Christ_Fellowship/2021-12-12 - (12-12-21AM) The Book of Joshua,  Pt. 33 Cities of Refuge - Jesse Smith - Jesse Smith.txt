good so let's go to joshua 20 here verse 1. this is part 33 on a series we've been looking at um thank you brother appreciate that buzz david joshua chapter 20 verse 1. and we'll let's look at this book of joshua here this morning and the thought is we like to look at the thought of the cities of refuge so we'll look at that as like our sub-topic the cities of refuge okay all right joshua chapter 20. all right verse verse one and we'll read down here i'll read down to verse 6 verses 1 to 6 and then we'll read this we'll have a word of prayer then we'll have everybody be seated by god's grace now let's all read verse six together after i read one through five so i'll read one through five then by myself and then verse six we'll all read out loud okay so the lord spake unto joshua saying speak to the children of israel saying a point out of you cities of refuge whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. verse 4 and when he that doth flee into one of these cities shall stand at the sorry she'll stand i'm sorry i lost my spot i'm going to go back in verse 4 and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them verse 5 and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not a four time now let's read verse six together so can you put thank you honey let's read this on three one two three and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled amen let's have a word of prayer before we're seated here and ask god to help us to understand the spirit of god's teaching from this this scripture here heavenly father lord we just bow our heads to you we thank you again for these songs lord god we thank you for the prayer request lord god and we're just trusting in you god to heal our sick oh god raise them up in jesus name some in arizona someone here in akron dear god just raise up the sick one in pennsylvania raise up the sick in jesus name god do something great today lord and minister by the hand of the holy spirit lord we ask it and father god anoint me to preach your word anoint each and every person to hear lord help me to hear as well and god made the scripture become a reality to us lord god as we look to you today father and lord we give you all the glory we give you all the praise be magnified in the preaching of the word in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god you can switch over here i have some notes i like to share i like to use like a powerpoint it kind of just slows me down and helps me to kind of clear out my thoughts a little bit so we're looking at part 3 or 33 today so since february we've been looking at the book of joshua we preached all the way through this now we haven't preached every single verse but we preach the main thoughts of this and i trust to be a blessing to you so here's just a little picture church if you wanted to just i'll reference this again but the point of this passage is that god set up cities in israel where you could flee to if you were in trouble if you accidentally murdered somebody and you didn't do it on purpose god had a place that you could go to to find mercy because in the old testament it was eye for an eye tooth for tooth in other words if you took out somebody's eye your eye had to be plucked out if you knocked out somebody's eye i'm sorry knocked out somebody's tooth rather you had to get your tooth knocked out it was uh it was there was it was law it wasn't grace it was law but even in this law god had some grace hiding in there god was hiding this as a place it was show for it was showing forth the grace to come in the new testament and we'll look at that so we see in the picture it looks like a woman here is running and you know these men have been chasing her like the arrows flies here and falls in the ground right before she reaches her uh her destination in other words it's a it's a drama right it's a dramatic experience i've done wrong and and uh and people are after me to kill me and rightfully so because i've killed someone else right but if i didn't do it on purpose there was a place i could run to it was called a city of refuge so we'll look at this thought here and we'll bring it down and how it applies to us in the new testament today now let me just background i want to background this here uh just real briefly uh that joshua was an old testament figure he was the prophet after moses so moses uh moses brought israel out of egypt through the exodus and and then uh moses brought them through the red sea god brought them or moses brought them all the way to we'd say like the edge of the promised land but then he died because he glorified himself moses glorified himself and so god would not let him in the promised land so god let moses die and then god raised up joshua and joshua was the next leader and joshua actually brought the people into all the promises that god had promised them amen and so you know moses of course was a type here of the old testament and jesus christ is the type of joshua in fact the name joshua means jehovah is our salvation okay and the name jesus is actually the greek form of joshua so joshua jesus's real name is joshua okay but in the greek you say joshua by jesus and so when they interpret the bible they didn't want to keep calling jesus joshua joshua they want a distinction between the old testament joshua and the new testament joshua amen so jesus christ is the new testament joshua the hebrew word is actually yeshua yeshua is how you say jesus name in hebrew or joshua's name in hebrew so joshua was a foreshadow of jesus christ how the holy spirit was going to bring us into the promises of god amen hallelujah that's why joshua's such an amazing person brother austin he defeated 31 kings 31 kings he defeated joshua did and that and he defeated all the kings that god had him that god had called him to defeat and that's a type of jesus christ jesus christ spirit will cause us to defeat every enemy before us amen every foe shall be defeated in the name of joshua amen in other words the name of jesus christ amen every every enemy will be defeated by the holy spirit praise god amen part of me so joshua fulfilled the third step in this exodus so i gotta uh remember the scripture deuteronomy 6 verse 22 22-23 god shows us an exodus requires it requires coming out of egypt but it also requires going into the promised land amen and the lord showed signs and wonders and great and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all's household before our eyes he brought us out from fence he brought us out of egypt that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swear unto our fathers so i just want to show this here as a beautiful this is a type church this is a three-step type so here's egypt moses brought israel out of egypt but he just didn't bring them out to stay in the wilderness god wanted to take them somewhere right so that's the first step was bringing them out the second step was bringing him through the red sea and the wilderness and then the third step is what joshua accomplished there's basically three steps coming out going through the wilderness and then entering in praise god and so moses did the first two he brought him out and he brought him through the red sea to the wilderness but then god had to raise up joshua to bring them into the third step which we know is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost amen so let me in other words god always uses three steps to do something right just like a baby's born first the water breaks and then there's blood and then there's the breath of life there's always three steps praise god i'm going to skip down here israel what we're talking about israel left egypt that was the first step next they went out in the wilderness and the third step they took the promised land that's what joshua did joshua took him to the promised land now that was a representation of us being born spiritually we're all born naturally but god wants us to be born spiritually praise god so the first thing is we get justified we get saved that's what the word justified means saved and forgiven praise god that's when you get baptized that's when you come out of here so so right here's where they cross the red sea they think at least i know it's a great debate about where they crossed it but they come out and they cross through the water this water represents their baptism so see that's when you get saved you repent of your sins and when you go take him and baptize you in the lake praise god in the name of jesus christ because you're deciding i'm leaving the world i'm being i'm living a new life i'm making an exodus from the sinful life that i used to live i'm leaving that and i'm going forward in the promises of god so that's where we get water baptism from they cross through the waters as a water baptism unto moses amen and that's in the first corinthians chapter 10 praise god now the second stage was sad you know they went up there to cadiz barnea but then they turned down the opportunity to go into the promised land so they wandered back out here wandered around here for 40 years and after moses died they finally were able to go up to uh jordan river and cross into jordan so this represents a christian life first we got to come out we got to leave our sinful life we got to get saved baptized in water and then we start going through the wilderness praise god all the tests of faith all the trials of faith right all the all the battles they had they'd battled numerous kings amalek moab yeah moses fought numerous battles and so did joshua they had to fight numerous battles in order to get to the promised land but once they got to the promised land the ark took them over can i say like this the bible takes you over amen the bible the ark of god the presence of god right this represents god's word god's presence the ark of god if you put it first if you put it on your shoulders if you exalt the word of god god's word will take you into the promised land amen it'll take you into the baptism of the holy ghost just put god's word first just carry god's word amen exalt it lift it high amen live it carry it and let the word of god take you into what god has planned for your life amen hallelujah now there was also three steps to cleaning out the tabernacle outer court holy place holiest of holies god cleans the earth through three steps noah's flood jesus's blood and then the fire that burns the earth after the battle of armageddon so then god can bring his people down in the millennium and live on this uh cleaned off earth now there's all and there's here's another way to look at the three steps of grace new heart ezekiel said i'm going to give you a new heart new spirit and then my spirit will cause you to keep my commands that's again justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said it's the three works of grace are like a wheat plant first you have the blade right that first little blade out of the ground then you have the ear and then you have the full corn hallelujah and then jesus said there's three steps to heaven i am the way i am the truth and the life he said sanctify them through the truth thy word is truth amen and then he says the life is the baptism of the holy ghost so three steps i hope that helps you understand now now scripture is clear church that people sometimes can fall short of god's promises because god's promises are conditional in other words all israel church 2 million people were promised to make it here but only 2 out of those 2 million did did you know that moses brought two million people out brother but they all died except joshua and caleb they're the only ones that went over see so in other words god's promises are conditional they're only going to be fulfilled by those who believe them amen right two million people came out only two made it now what as the two million died there rose up another generation so there was about two million people that actually went in but they were younger people in other words the older generation that didn't obey all the word of god they died god let them die because they didn't believe it they were scared of the giants they were scared of the baptism of the holy ghost but we can't be scared of it amen we we should fear no man we should only fear god amen we should not fear any man or any situation and we should not fear any problem we should just trust god and know that god is going to bring us through amen hallelujah how's that how's that volume sound back there some okay pretty good hopefully it sounds good for our you our live streamers because it looks like we got a lot of sick people today in the church we're almost empty amen uh so hopefully they're enjoying it and can hear it so this is our life god brings us out of egypt right out of our sins we get baptized and we we we progress we make our way into the promised land and then once we're in is life easy no we're not really life starts getting more battles praise god because once they got in that's when joshua started really fighting but you've got power to overcome amen hallelujah so joshua fought a couple battles out here but he thought he fought 31 kings inside his baptism of the holy ghost experience at church that's what we've done too we've had we'd have battle off pride we have to battle off arrogance and and complexes and mind battles and lust spirits and greed spirits but god has brought us through every single one just like joshua said the holy spirit said no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life if you just meditate on the word and that's what we found in church we're able to have a church we're able to have uh believers and the devil can't defeat him because they meditate on god's word and all their foes bow at their feet all the foes bow and all the foes flee because jesus is fighting our battles amen hallelujah praise god amen and that's what we do we put our trust in jesus christ and he'll make every enemy fall before our feet amen that's the beauty of being a christian praise god he makes you more than a conqueror in christ jesus now here let me show you those these three scriptures though these scriptures show that people can start in the promises of god but if they don't get born again they can fall away and be lost just like just like this one there was 2 million people that died before they got here 2 million right now some of them were believers like moses and miriam and aaron good believers but the majority of them the bible said were unbelievers and died so let me prove it to you okay the first one now here's a very serious scripture here of how much sore punishment in hebrews chapter 10 verse 29 suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trod and under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace so the example of this is judas iscariot judas iscariot preached with jesus for three and a half years he cast out devils he raised the dead but at the end of jesus ministry he he found a plan can i sell out jesus i'll bring jesus to you if you give me 30 pieces of silver so he started right he started with a sincere heart but then he sold out jesus for money but see the the what we're supposed to do is sell out the world for jesus amen hallelujah that's what austin did when he got rid of all those music see you sold out the world and now you're serving jesus amen see that's exactly what we have to do we have to sell out the world he desires and follow jesus but judas did the opposite he started good but then at the end of his life he he stopped going on he stopped progressing towards the baptism of the holy ghost and he turned on jesus at the end and said i'd rather have 30 pieces of silver than jesus and it's it's as if he took jesus's blood and threw it on the ground and stomped on us and i don't want this anymore i want the money and the bible said this kind of person that does this will have a sore punishment in hell because they started off leaving egypt but they never got to jericho oh god help us to get to jericho help us to get in the promised land so we can really fight for god live for god and we can find our place of rest amen because once they defeated all the enemies the bible said now it's time to rest amen now it's time to rest and enjoy the land enjoy your families enjoy your homes enjoy the good land that god has given you and praise the name of the lord all the days of your life so see there are great punishments for despising god's gifts or god's covenant so let me go back to this and just let me just give a picture again so it's like judas got saved the bible said judas iscariot baptized people the bible said jesus baptized nobody but his disciples baptized people so judas came all the way here can i say like this judas came to kadesh barnea and said well i can't i don't want to get born again i'd rather get money whatever it was fearful he was probably fearful because remember he gave the money back he was probably fearful about his future and if jesus was going to be king or not so he sold out jesus for money and then he died he never made it into the promised land oh but thank god even though some people made mistakes like peter peter denied christ but yet peter found a way to repent and say i'm sorry lord forgive me and then he found himself going into the promised land on the day of pentecost hallelujah praise god and he was the spokesman on the day of pentecost as well so don't be discouraged by your failures just say i'm sorry lord give me another chance and god will speak through you again hallelujah it looked it looked like peter was more uh or just as wicked as jesus because he denied jesus three times i don't know him i don't know the man he cussed and swear i don't know that man and yet god forgave him amen but judas just won the money and he and he never he never repents he never came back to god oh there's hope for us how many believe there's grace today for us amen there's grace church if you want grace there's grace for you praise god but the bible said there's people like judas who they they were look they were even sanctified they got all the way to the wilderness but then they they said this i don't i don't want to live this anymore i don't believe this anymore and they stomped on it and they said i'm not going to live a holy life they're speaking bad about jesus people do that today the bible says you can crucify jesus today how do you know that let's look at it uh it's hebrews chapter six if you got your bibles there i'll pull it up here so you can see it do you know that jesus was crucified 2 000 years ago but people crucify or kill the effects of his holy spirit today let me say like that that's what katy perry did that's what beyonce did they were raising church that's what aretha franklin did they knew uh whitney houston we could just start naming them all off they all started in church but at some point they said i'd rather have money than jesus and what they do they they trampled on that they sing about sex they sing about drugs they sing about immorality and if they're not careful what they've done is they've crucified the effects of the holy spirit in their lives and like whitney houston died in the bathtub uh high and drunk with a heart attack elvis presley died on a toilet stool saying he was the king of rock what a lie see what have they done they crucified the effects of the gospel to themselves in other words we can't crucify the gospel we've got to crucify our desires amen we've got to daily crucify not what jesse wants but i'm going to do what god wants to do amen that's crucifixion amen a daily crucifixion praise god look at look what the bible says this is just like this is just like the bible says uh and have tasted anyone who's tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame see any any woman any singer any famous singer katy perry she started in the church right and she tried to make it with the christian contemporary music but she wasn't popular so she she actually it's all there's a video on youtube she said i sold my soul to the devil and now look at her now she lost her soul and what has she done she'd crucify because she couldn't get famous through the christian music she crucified the gospel and don't sing about the gospel she sings about lesbian works right and she's not careful she don't repent she'll be lost for crucifying jesus christ the effects of it not living it not believing it and not sharing it thank god that we live it we believe it we share it let's always do that praise god let's try to get people saved by the grace of god see so this is a very real picture church oh what did i have done okay there we go i actually i almost erased it now here's one that specifically says after god brought israel out he destroyed those that believe not now look he the bible says this letter was written shortly after christ for there are certain men crept in unawares they're creeping into your church who were before of old ordained this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lashiviousness that means lawlessness so anybody that says oh you can be a christian it's okay to do whatever you don't have to really obey this they're turning grace into lawlessness and they'll be condemned at the day of judgment for that and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance that though ye once knew this how the lord listen having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not in other words a lot of people start serving god but you can't stop serving god you got to continue serving god amen you got to say i'm not just going to serve god for five years i'm going to serve god all of my years i'm going to give god all my strength all of my youth amen i'm glad i got saved at 19 amen i was able to give god all these years of my youth now i'm 41 praise god i'm able to give god these these young years of my life i didn't i uh you know god helped me to overcome all the desires and lust that i had i'm so thankful praise god now i have some scars from before that but the scars look tiny compared to the blessings of god i see in my life amen that's what we can all say praise god the longer you serve god the more blessing you see in your life amen here's another one where jesus christ now these are supposed to be red letter words i didn't have time to really uh i guess i could do it now but it's not really important these are red letter words jesus said if people do not overcome the world he's gonna blot their name off the book of life in other words there's a book in heaven that has names of the people that are saved and if people like judas if they or like some of these famous singers we're talking about if they will not overcome those sins jesus will blot their name off and their name will not be in the book of life anymore they lose eternal life look what he said jesus said he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels praise god in other words if you overcome now then god will call you an overcomer he'll reward you later in heaven in front of all the angels and in front of all the believers down through the years praise god he'll look over and say you were an overcomer brother you were an overcomer sister you overcame and so your name is still on the book of life praise god hallelujah now that's a background i just want to show what joshua's really all about joshua is a foreshadowing of us coming out of the world being sanctified and then going into the baptism of the holy ghost and ready to fight battles in jesus name now we read joshua 1 to 6. now i don't think i have time to read all this but yeah now for a complete understanding of the cities of refuge god actually talks about it first in numbers 35 verse 6 and verses 9 to 34. and if we don't have time to read that but if we would we would find that there were six cities in israel that god told moses tell joshua make sure these cities are cities of refuge so when anyone murders he said and they murder someone and they don't mean to do it it was not premeditated murder then the guilty person can run and escape their their their murderers or the slayers and they can have peace and safety in the city of refuge okay now once they got there so let's let's say let's say somebody was you uh i think the example is like using an axe you're using an axe and you're cutting wood but all of a sudden the axe had flies off when you go like that and it flies over at your buddy and the accent hits your buddy and he dies well all the family of your buddy is going to want to kill you because you killed them and so you drop you drop everything and you just run you you have to run and the whole time you can hear they're after you that's how i mean god god god wants people to be avenged of wrongs right god is good there's nothing wrong with wanting vengeance or wanting justice like i like to see justice like that famous guy who did that hoax this week with a racist hoax i like to see that justice is done i'd like to see that if you're wrong you should pay the price but if you're right you should be forgiven i mean you should have nothing wrong to you right who doesn't want justice on hitler who doesn't want justice on hitler over 6 million jews killed shouldn't he have justice yes he will but it will be at the white throne judgment he's going for we're gonna have to wait for the justice then some people get justice now some people get justice then there's nothing wrong with wanting justice because that's what god god god cares god feels our pain amen he feels that and so they would be chasing him and he would run and the bible said once he got to the the city he he knocked on the gates and said let me in let me in and they come out and say oh what happened well i was chopping with my axe and i hit my friend and i killed him i didn't mean to and so then all the uh the slayers would come up and they'd say okay we gotta have a court trial here just one person couldn't cause this person to be killed it had to be in the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established and so they would have a public trial they'd say okay you tell what happened you tell what happened and then they say well if he didn't mean to do it they would say did you mean to kill him did you not like your friend do you not like your buddy he said no i loved him i i'm so sorry i did it and so the judges would stand there and either decide is he guilty or innocent if he's innocent he'd say you've got to go you can't kill him because he didn't mean to do it we let him into the city and now he's going to dwell in our city he found a place of safety amen even though he did wrong he didn't mean to do it so he found a place of safety and god made a way for a place of safety if you don't if you didn't mean to do god that's what god calls integrity god loves integrity amen when you have no i have no intent to hurt anybody i have no intent to do any wrong that's called integrity just like king abimelech remember hallelujah king abimelech took sarah and he's like oh i can't wait to marry sarah and god says if you marry her you're like a dead man he's like what do you mean he said you know my heart she don't have a husband he god said yes he does yes he does have a husband it's abraham and he lied to you but abraham's got to pray for you because he's my prophet now that just about blows my mind a lying prophet yet he's got to pray for you right because remember not all their wombs were were cursed after abimelech took sarah she already had a husband all the wombs in his house were cursed he said what's going on he said lord you know the integrity of my heart and god said yes because i knew your integrity that's why i kept you from taking sarah another man's wife and that's what we should rejoice in that if we don't want to sin god will make a way where we are vindicated as being truthful praise god amen god loves a heart that wants to live holy amen and doesn't want to do wrong and once i do ride god loves that kind of heart that's a heart after the heart of god amen now that's pretty beautiful this man had to live in the city if he was if he accidentally killed his friend he had to live in the city until the high priest died and then he could go free now it's interesting church if he left early and said you know i really gotta go see mama i really need to see daddy if he left early and his buddy's family saw him they could kill him on the spot and it was okay because he was not allowed to leave that place of safety for him see because god god feels what people feel when they lose loved ones right and god god knows that every heart needs to feel justice when they lose someone especially if it's it's an evil way right it's a very sad way because church the bible says this blood defiles the land the shedding of blood and the killing of people it defiles a land remember when the first murder in the bible was two brothers cain tried to offer god a plant sacrifice and god said i don't want it he said i require a blood sacrifice remember that abel his brother brought a lamb and god said i like that that's my sacrifice but god didn't receive canes and so cain got mad he went out with his brother and killed his brother in the field and then cain went away and god said cain where's your brother abel uh he said cain where's your brother abe he says i don't know am i my brother's keeper and he lied to god and what did god say cain your brother's blood cries to me out of the ground see when people are murdered or killed that blood cries up to heaven for justice justice give me justice people want justice god's going to have justice now church think about this over 60 million abortions have been done in this land that means there are 60 million voices crying out god judge america god judge america but you just keep praying we might get a victory here uh overturn abortion pretty soon texas already got that big uh uh 15-week abortion thing and they estimated that saves over a hundred babies lives every day amen hallelujah that's a step in the right direction amen i don't know yet god doesn't want anybody to die right and we we would we'd like abortion to be banned but we should pray for god give us victories give us victories that lord you can forgive people and if the woman did it and she didn't know god will forgive her she can still be saved it's going to it's going to bother her the rest of her life and but she can still be saved she can still experience forgiveness david was a murderer moses was a murderer and yet they still serve god amen you know god can say he can forgive he can still use us if we're willing to say i'm sorry it was my fault forgive me lord but the bible says jesus christ he was killed but the bible said his voice speaks better things than that of abel hey in other words jesus voice says father forgive these murderers they don't know what they're doing amen oh hallelujah praise god abel's blood said avenge me god avenge me avenge me but the blood of jesus says forgive them they don't know what they're doing have mercy on them amen hallelujah oh it's a beautiful story church i wish i could uh i hope you're getting it by the grace of god now in verse 4 the bible said he had to stand at the gate and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city in other words they had to give all the witnesses here's what happened i was chopping with my ex my axe had flew off and killed my friend and if he said the truth they would take him in the city and give him a place to dwell among them now here here we see the importance of a public testimony such as water baptism when you get when you get saved we take you out to the lake and we baptize you in the name of jesus christ you go under the water and you come up and everybody's there and you're declaring to everybody that i'm dying to my old life and i want a new life in jesus christ god always wants a public testimony amen because jesus said whosoever is ashamed of me and my words and the adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels that's why we've got to learn no matter where we are we can't be ashamed of jesus that's why i wear that jesus hat i want everybody know i love jesus amen i'm not ashamed of him he saved he healed my mama cancer praise god he saved my soul he filled me with the holy ghost praise god he's changed my whole life i'm not ashamed of him i want everyone to know the jesus that i know amen but see sinners many times are unashamed of their sin so just like we're unashamed of jesus sinners are unashamed of their sin like here's when the bible says the homosexuals in the days of isaiah which was about 800 years before christ the bible said their faces their countenance witness against them they declare their sin is sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves you know that in akron every year they have a gay a gay parade every year in akron we pass it when a couple years ago we passed the gay parade what are they doing out there they're just declaring we're breaking god's law we're against the law of god we hate god's laws basically what they're saying and so see they're unashamed of their sin they ought to be ashamed of it but see we're unashamed of of the gospel of jesus christ because it is the power of god under salvation to us amen it is god's power in our life to make us live holy and make us live pure and make us live the way god wants us to live see there's three great sins on that homosexual spirit first it's like this it's this gay pride right they call it gay pride but it's actually it's a public declaration of i love sin that's how you recognize the spirit of homosexuality they're proud of it right and god said because of that they'll be judged because they're unashamed of their sin second this spirit is aggressive and violent right if you don't agree with it they call you a hater right they say you're wicked or you you're the oppressor right so it's they're not afraid of it as the first type of the sin the second part of this they're aggressive in violence towards us right and they target people uh that speak the truth in love and third it's an unnatural spirit the bible says they've left the natural use of the human body parts and done done went to the unnatural part see and the bible said they're actually abusing their own bodies when they partake in these homosexual acts so that's three characteristics they boldly proclaim it they're aggressive against you and they're unnatural they like things that are unnatural god didn't make them that way but they're so into their lust that they now enjoy things that they should actually despise and hate and abhor yeah brother amen brother uh allison all right you know i actually found something out there so you know wow yeah it is brother yep there it is there it is pride month yes sir yeah i appreciate that that's right total demon that's what the demon is right demon has those characters that's very good brother very good i like that yeah it's hidden right in there that's good amen that's yeah the bible says demon powers in other words like a demon tempts them and say you should try this this is good and pretty soon that demon enters into their mind and now that's all they think about right that's how they live their lives and they're possessed with evil spirits very good brother very good also you must have a public testimony of the baptism of the holy ghost rahab had to display her red core remember she her record had to hang outside publicly for all the world to see so it is with jesus christ in our lives we have to have a public testimony that i'm serving jesus christ his blood was shed for me now i'm living for him now notice this beautiful type here churches of just a beautiful type in verse 6 of joshua chapter 20 the unintentional slayer was set free from the city of refuge after the death of the high priest now this preacher named fb meyer said this he said this was a type of our lord and thus the death of each high priest pre-signified that the death by which captive souls are freed and the remembrance of sin made to cease so in other words this this foreshadow when a high priest would die the the unintentional murders were set free this this foreshadowed the high priest that was going to come named jesus christ and when jesus christ died for our sins every captive was made free praise god and then his sins his previous sins were no more remembered because the high priest paid for those sins amen hallelujah it's a beautiful picture church of jesus christ amen oh hallelujah in other words i have to be in this place and say thank god it's a peaceful place but i'm in this place until the high priest dies and then i'm set free and my sins and my iniquities are remembered no more thank god that jesus christ died and we are set free through his blood and forgiven beautiful joshua seven one through nine now in the in these verses joshua seven uh 27-9 these cities of refuge were for both israelis and strangers or gentiles that sojourned among them and these cities of refuge they magnified god's grace and compassion upon mankind isn't that so kind of god that if you make a mistake and you do something now listen church if you accidentally killed somebody think about that you'd have to live with that pain the rest of your life can you imagine i remember there's that football player i don't remember his name he was a retired football player i don't know you might know his name brother no i'm gonna go different one yeah yeah he did an awful thing i think we think he was probably guilty of that one yeah i mean everything everything in match i don't know how he got out of that one sure looked like it but there was a tight end a few years ago he retired and it was a really sad case he was in a hurry in his in his driveway and he got in his truck backed out and he hit his own child and the child passed away can you imagine i mean he's a millionaire right multi-millionaire but now he'll never have that daughter and he'll have to live with that the rest of his life all because he didn't take a few seconds and look before he he backed up and that's what we're talking about but see god is so compassionate he knew people would make mistakes or maybe the ox the oxes uh maybe they had the big horns they would they would uh horn somebody and they'd die accidentally god had a way and if you did something on accident god had a way to protect your life as well because god cares and god is so merciful in church let me just say this like i was telling brother amen yesterday his sickness is just a test of faith we prayed and if god doesn't heal a miracle then we just got to wait it out god could do a miracle we know god's done miracles before for us before but if he doesn't then it's a test of faith in other words god in heaven allowed anew i'm gonna allow this brother or this sister be tested for two weeks or three weeks or a month or whatever job went through the test for months the bible said where he had boils on his body for months and it was all a test he you know he had done things wrong but we all do things wrong right we and he confessed his sins he killed the sacrifices the animals he was forgiven but yet god let him be tested and so so it is in this case too sometimes god will let accidents happen or things happen in your past and it's a test will you overcome that sorrow or or not or you give in to that sorrow will you live into depression despair or will you rise above that and say thank god that he kept me thank god that he still forgives me thank god there's still hope in my life amen amen hallelujah that's what god wants you to do god i want you to rise up and say though i made mistakes god has a future for me i can still be free amen hallelujah i can still be afraid because the high priest died amen and now my sins iniquities are remembered no more praise god amen do you know the bible said that let's go to romans here you've got your bibles new testament romans let's just well i'll put it up here too romans chapter 4 church the bible says when you confess your sins god does not remember your iniquities anymore yep romans chapter 4 sir yes sir uh let's go to verse verse four now these are really uh these are really wise and sophisticated words we'll say right so we'll just try to make it as simple as we can and that's great because paul was a very wise man romans 4 verse 4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt in other words if you're trying to earn salvation you'll never get it because you can never pay off your sin debt you're not holy enough to pay off your sin debt but if it's grace look at verse 5 but to him that worketh not in other words the people that just trust in god but believe on him that justifies the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so let me encourage brother austin and sister lena you can never earn salvation you just have to accept the free gift you'll never earn it because you can't you can't pay off all your sins what good because you'll keep sinning you can never earn salvation it is a free gift of god and then when you believe that that's a free gift the bible said righteousness comes upon you amen i know when you believe that god wants to freely forgive you his righteous anointing anoints you your anointed with faith praise god because you're saved by grace through faith hallelujah there it is right there amen verse 6 even as david also described the blessedness of this kind of man unto whom god imputes righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin praise god so when you just believe god and say god forgive me my sins i'm guilty i want to be saved and you accept that then you are no longer guilty god doesn't remember those sins you are now saved and your sins went on jesus and jesus righteous went on you amen hallelujah where's that scripture about free gift let me look it up here i preached on a few months ago yeah go to chapter 5 verse 15. romans chapter 5 verse 15 but not as the offense so also is the what the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead that's adam much more the grace of god the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many in other words the work of jesus christ his work on the cross has caused many people to be saved adam's sin caused everybody to die right but jesus victory over sin on the cross caused all believers to live and no more have to deal with their sin because god remembers their sin no more hey that's what the bible says praise god let me look up the other free gift yeah verse 16 yes the next verse and not as it was by one that sin so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation adam but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification praise god there's one more verse about the free gift verse 18. so three times church in the same chapter god says it's a free gift it's a free gift you just have to accept it therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so the r by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life praise god in other words god is offering this free gift to every person here today and of course most of you have received it right you've accepted that it's a free gift god just offers you the gift and say i'm off i'm giving you eternal life if you repent of your sins and believe in me and all you have to do is say yes lord i'm repenting of my sins i believe in you and then god no more imputes those sins unto you god totally forgives you it's a free gift of grace we call it amazing grace hallelujah praise god amen so see these cities are types of being saved right you're guilty of sin you and i are guilty of sin but god has a place amen for those people that want to be saved hallelujah praise god amen so look at look at the map here church if you read joshua 20 there were six cities where they could run six cities they have kedish way up here not katish barnier kanesh barney is way down here they have kiddish golan ramoth gilead shechem bezer and hebron and notice god places them out god spreads them out praise god sick cities god said i know there's going to be accidents i'm going to allow people to be tested with trials and difficulties in life but if they want to be free i'm going to make a place where they can be safe but it's their choice in church so it is our choice today too do we want to be saved do we want to be lost what do we want god god's going to allow us to have whatever we want right god's not going to force us to do anything so if you want to be saved there's a place for you to be saved it's in the city of refuge it's in jesus christ hallelujah now here's what my home and bible study says at home these three cities were west of jordan and three on the east of jordan they were spread out across the land so that a person was never far from one oh can i say it like this church we need to learn that we are never far from jesus christ we're never too far there's always a place amen there's always a place that we can run to and find god's grace can i say it like this it's a place of prayer it's a place of worship amen it don't have to be at the church it can be in your home on the job but you've got to run to jesus he's never far from us he's very close to us he just wants us to escape escape the devil that's chasing us right amen that's that's a beautiful thought church satan's the bible says satan comes to steal kill and destroy so who's the one chasing you satan's the one chasing you saying i'm going to kill you i'm going to take your life you're going to go to hell well of course he's saying that but you got to run you got to run the race set before you you got to run until you reach that city amen that city of refuge that city of safety run until you reach jesus christ oh my god you're never too far from jesus amen hallelujah that remember god set this up in the old testament so we would understand the new testament we're never far from christ that's what the bible says go to acts 17. uh the bible said though they be not far from him i'm gonna put those from each one of us i think it is yep acts 17 27 church you realize that jesus christ is never far from you he's oh don't let the devil tell you he's so far yeah you might have grieved the lord but he's just waiting there he you might have offended him you just wait he's waiting there for you to accept him i'm sorry that's acts 17 27 so in the new testament it goes matthew mark luke john x it's the fifth book in the new testament let's see how you doing there what's that one oh yeah right there good yeah right there awesome nice job acts 17 27 but austin you want to read that for us brother verse 27 yep amen praise god now look at the first look at the verse before that church god made all nations of one blood right we all have the same blood to dwell on the earth on the face of the earth and have to determine the times in other words god knew he'd live in the 21st century before appointed and the bounds of their inhabitation god knew where you would live god placed you in akron or california or arizona or mansfield god placed you there why so you would seek after god amen and feel after him and try to find him because he's not far from you in other words god god put you close to a real believer praise god there's somewhere in your life where god placed you close to a believer so you could feel after god and say do you believe in jesus you really worship god the bible says that god placed you in the right spot in other words he's not far from you amen if you just turn and look for him and feel after him you'll find jesus today amen hallelujah he's not far from all of us the bible said he's very near to all of us don't believe the devil's lie today let's believe the the the son of god who is the faithful witness hallelujah amen jesus christ is the faithful witness all right i'm trying to close here let me give me about 15 more minutes here i'll try to close sometimes i preach two hours brother so just bear with me here once once you get all in this you start seeing all this i mean it's hard to stop because you see of all i see oh i see jesus christ everywhere and joshua in genesis he's everywhere praise god you just get so caught up in this it's beautiful jesus is the city of refuge amen he's our city and all we've got to do is run to him here now i read this on wednesday night at the end of the service now if you want to do right how many want to do right in their life i don't want to do wrong i don't want to go to hell right on my hands up too if you want to do right i'm so glad tonight to tell you there's a city of refuge that's jesus christ oh thank you lord he's my city of refuge amen he's where i run to him prayer when i need him praise god if you don't want to do wrong see the enemy's after you then there's a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ there's a place where you can come and let off the steam see can you imagine church running all those miles and you've got people chasing you oh you can hear the swords clanging you know you can hear the arrows you'd be tired you've got so much pressure but once you got there to the gates you could grab ahold of the gates and say i'm safe i'm safe that's what he's saying when you run to jesus christ all the pressure goes off because you know you're in his nail scarred hands amen hallelujah you know he's holding you in the palm of his hand the bible says glory he said but if you love sin and you don't want god then the enemy is going to overtake you somewhere like we said we saw the enemy overtake elvis we saw the enemy overtake judas iscariot right whitney houston we saw the enemy overtake them they thought they could run them from it by drinking and they found out you can't get away from the devil by drinking you got to get rid of the drinking and run to jesus amen you got to drink on the holy ghost wine that's right amen you got to get drunk on jesus amen that's what you really need to get drunk on hallelujah that's what the bible says the bible calls it new wine amen hallelujah praise god amen you get drunk on that you you don't know how you might act amen you might just be crazy because god has filled your heart and soul you're a new creature you're stimulated you're moved to act differently because you've drank down his goodness amen you've drank down his love you drank down his grace so you act crazy amen crazy to the world amen but you act just fine to god hallelujah amen you can't come to christ because the people don't want to and when this man comes to christ this place of refuge when a man come in the old testament the first thing pardon me he had to come upon his own free will and that's the way you have to come to christ see if the man killed his friend he could he could he could stay there and be killed but if he could give up in the depression right he could have gave up and depressed and say oh my life's never going to amount to anything or he could go find a place of escape eventually be free and then raise his family amen or that may be saved and then maybe work on tools to make sure that don't happen again right just like you see some of these parents you see some of these parents in america whose kids have overdosed on drugs what do they do a lot of them start up speaking engagements to try to train the next generation don't get started on drugs see but what if they would have gave up and quit and committed suicide they wouldn't be able to help the next generation so if we suffer if we make a major mistake we must learn from that and then the rest of our lives try to urge people not to commit that same mistake and that will honor god that will save lives and maybe church save souls as well praise god if you can get them to know jesus christ hallelujah he said another thing you must be satisfied while you're there remember the bible says if that man left the city before the high priest died he could be killed because he left the place of protection brother brahm says you can't hang around every day crying i'd like to get out of here i like to get out of here they put you out you must willfully want to stay it must be that you must come you want to stay in that city and when you come to christ you can't look back to the world the bible said he that puts his hand on the plow and turns look back is not worthy of plowing now there's where now there's where many so-called christians make their mistake see they act like they're going to plow but the first little thing comes up they blow up about it so see church as you start serving god don't let anybody try to turn you back into your life your life of sin brother rahm told a story in this in this sermon letting off the pressure and i'll just tell briefly he met a man uh he was going out hunting and a man uh somehow they they met uh some i think they met some prisoners who were like cleaning up the roadside brother i talked about they were they're on their way to hunt and they came across these guys that were uh cleaning up the roadside i believe and the brother man said you're such a nice-looking young man what happened to you why were you in prison he said i'll tell you the story i started off as a good man my wife and i had a baby they called me holy bishop because i loved god he said but then i got mixed up with the wrong friends he said these friends took me to the dance halls and i would leave my wife and girl at home and one day i was at home and wife said come in for dinner and he said okay but then those guys that took him to the dance hall came up and said hey can you take us down to get groceries and his wife is like stop hanging out with them they're going to get you in trouble and she said honey come in it's supper time my dog our daughter's here let's eat together he said no i got to help these guys out so he took him down to the grocery store he said they went in to buy something he sat on the car but ram told this story he said pretty soon the alarms went off his friends come running out with guns they stole stuff and he said drive he said i'm not driving they hit him on the head and made him bleed until he drove away while the cops caught him and this guy got 10 years in prison just for being accomplice and he didn't even do anything wrong and brother ban said let's pray that you'll get parole i don't know if he got parole but that's a good prayer to pray the other guys they murdered and they were the thiefs they got print they got life in prison that was back in the 60s and see what it was he this is a man who he he was accidentally a part of something and he was asking god for mercy but he never would have done that if he would uh stay with the right crowd right he if we just want to listen to his wife amen like our wives give us wisdom many times and not mix up with evil men and be faithful to your family and don't back don't backslide and go dance for the world dance for jesus amen just dance right here you know dance and say praise the lord you can do whatever dance you want dance for jesus love jesus because the devil's trying to kill you he's trying to chase you down but when you once you get to jesus that's where you're safe amen you're safe in christ amen you're safe here in jesus christ amen satan's trying to chase you down and kill you but run the best part is you can run faster than him amen because you've got god's love in your heart you've got god's power amen you think satan can ever track down somebody who wants to reach jesus christ impossible god will break down every bear to make sure you get to the city amen he'll hold satan back and say no don't touch him don't touch him i'm going to protect him if you want god god's going to help you find him amen because he's close to you he's not far from you he's close to you hallelujah amen thank the lord how many i think it was like five guys when i went to college five guys that i went to college with for football quit within the first year they didn't get their degrees they had a full-ride scholarship and i realized later that could have been me if i would have started drinking like they did because i started drinking those first few years because i wasn't saved and they had pictures of me drinking with them but i never liked it i was still a sinner but it was a few months after that i got saved and then the guys would say hey you're saved right i said well yeah i love jesus christ they say hey i got a picture of you drinking and smoking at college i said fine i said keep it that's the last time you're ever going to see that because i serve jesus now and they made fun of me but by the end they respected me but i saw had i not run to jesus in college that would have been me i could have wasted over a hundred thousand dollars but thank god i had it for my scholarship thank god i didn't waste it and these other guys go off and they they miss out on these great opportunities church we gotta run to jesus amen we got to make a decision if you feel the enemy chasing you leave leave the enemy leave that situation run to christ get some help jesus will be your help amen brother i said oh sinner friend let me warn you flee from the wrath that is to come there's only one hiding place and i'm glad that god made a city of refuge jesus christ we can run in and be safe oh my hallelujah brother bran talks about let's go to blue words here how can we think of those great cities built of refuge when the pursuer after the man he got into the tower he was safe nothing could touch him oh god let us run and make haste to the lord today for he is our refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble so church do you see yourself in this scripture let me see yourself in this scripture i see myself in this scripture be when i got saved the devil was after me but i knew i had to serve god and i went to that i went to that conference and i saw that big six foot three guy raised his hands and that's when i said i repented right there i said jesus forgive me if this six foot four guy who goes to ohio state he plays football if he can raise his hands forgive me i'm ashamed of myself and that's when i first started raising my hands for jesus that's when i ran to that city of refuge amen i always remember when i entered that city hallelujah i've been safe ever since amen i didn't i've had protection god has protected me and i've been safe and i've been forgiven ever since that day i repented of my sins and ran to jesus christ i remember that day for you praise god oh you'll never forget that day when satan was on your trail but god gave you strength to run and god opened the doors of heaven amen god opened the doors of the church and you got saved hallelujah so see church really ask yourself this question when you were sinning did you really want to blaspheme jesus's holy name no of course not how many of us used to cuss so we don't have to raise our hands but every time we would cuss we had to blast me you just say oh my oh my god or you'd say you you'd use jesus name in vain that's blasphemy that's disrespecting god that's using god's name as a curse but now we look back did we really mean that do we really mean the curse to curse the god who gave us life of course not i didn't mean to do that i was just caught in a bad spirit so now we see ourselves we're like the ones that unintentionally did it right we're like the unintentional slayers now because i really wouldn't want to curse the god who made me just like you wouldn't use your mom's name as a cuss word why because she loved you she brought you to this world she she nursed you she fed you you wouldn't use your mom's name as a cuss word neither do we use jesus name as a customer because he gave us our spiritual life amen did you really want to defile your body with sexual sin and yet jesus purchased that body on the cross the bible said you were bought with the price look at this the bible says you are bought with the price therefore glorify god in your body in your spirit which are god's right any sexual sin we may have done before we were married that's sin do we really mean to defile jesus's blood you know and the body that he purchased no so this is how we relate church to the cities of refuge we may not have murdered somebody accidentally but we certainly may have blasted god's holy name we may have cursed other people we may have defiled this temple god give us but through the blood of jesus christ through repentance god now forgives us forgives us of our sins he protects us and now we can glorify god in a safe place let me close with this go to john chapter 8 verse 1. john chapter 8 verse 1. matthew mark luke john it's the fourth book of the new testament john chapter 8 verse 1. i'm almost done here my 15 minutes i got one minute left in my 15 minutes so i'm almost done i'll be out about an hour and hour hour and a half this is just hour and a half today and i just want this verse to encourage your church i just wanted to encourage you i'm going to pull that picture up here real quick again what a beautiful picture that is okay john chapter 8 verse 1. then went i'm sorry jesus went under the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again in the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and the pharisees brought onto him a woman taking adultery and when they had set her in the midst they said master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law command us that such should be stoned but what saith thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so jesus ignored their accusation and he stooped down and started riding in the dirt verse 7. so when they continued asking him that he lifted up himself and said to them he that is without sin among you let him first cast the stone at her what a statement oh you want her to die okay well the first one can throw the stone if you never commit a sin before who are you to kill her when you deserve in other words how can you kill her when you deserve to be killed you're an unintentional murderer as well is what he's saying right she had unintentionally got an adultery she didn't mean to do that really right we wouldn't mean we why would we want to break our marriage vow why would we we told everybody we're going to keep our marriage vows why would we want to break it she didn't mean to do that and jesus said well if you've never done wrong go ahead and stone her and yet church the bible says she should have been stoned but not just her the man too and that's that's what i believe jesus is writing in the ground i believe jesus was writing the scripture that they were breaking the bible says take the man and the woman and stone them so jesus was showing how can you condemn her when you're not even keeping the word of god you're just trying to tempt me because jesus was the word you couldn't trick him because he was the word you couldn't make him forget the word because he was the word amen hallelujah and look we did in verse 8. he said again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last this show they still had hope right because the older people were more wise and they realized my he's right i am quite a sinner now think about that if you're older person you can think of all the times you've sinned over the course of your life so the oldest ones were like oh yeah i'm a sinner i sin all the time they left first finally the younger ones they're not so wise right yeah i guess i've sinned too i got caught up in the moment and look now who's left just jesus and the adulterous woman praise god hallelujah and when jesus lifted himself up he saw none but the woman and said her woman where are thine accusers hath no man condemned thee glory and she said no man lord not anymore right they were condemning her but now there's none here and jesus said to her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more that's what i was telling lena with that good question she said should people come as they are to church absolutely this woman came as she was i mean she was forced to it but she came to jesus anyway what did jesus say i don't condemn you just go and sin no more in other words recognize you're forgiven and don't do that again and that's how we should come to christ that's what jesus if jesus said that once he has to say it every time because he can't change the bible says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if we're guilty of sin all you have to do today is say jesus no man accuses me forgive me my sins and he'll say you're forgiven go and sin no more don't do it again amen and you're forgiven praise god although you should die you're worthy she was worthy of death but because jesus took away the accusers amen because jesus takes away satan's accusations amen we can be forgiven and there's no accusation there's no condemnation to them that are in or with jesus christ in the city of refuge amen that's awesome man hallelujah see she really didn't want to do it her and her lover should have been stoned but jesus was bringing in mercy jesus is bringing a new covenant i'm bringing in grace i'm bringing in forgiveness see church no man no devil can accuse you because they're all guilty of themselves how can satan accuse you he's guilty himself so we don't listen to satan here we listen to the bible here amen hallelujah don't listen to the devil listen to christ praise god we should receive our forgiveness receive our part and say thank you jesus i'm forgiven and i'm going to sin no more i'm going to live a life showing my love and gratitude i'm going to show my thanksgiving by making every life or every day of my life glorify jesus and brother stephen did you ever see this type here brother i preached this years ago do you see the son of man stoop twice to the earth did you see that look this is a beautiful type brother you'll catch it maybe austin alina might be able to catch it they're kind of new to some of the the types and shadows you see that verse 6 brother it says but jesus stooped to the ground and rode on the ground and then look at verse 8 and he again stooped down and rode on the ground so twice he stooped so brother catches the son of man come down to earth twice two visitations of the son of man touching earth hallelujah the first stooping was jesus's first coming right the second stooping was luke 17 30 in the days of the voice right i'm sorry the son of man right it's luke 17 30. i'm having a hard time quoting that right now so see the second stooping was the son of man he stooped down the earth jesus christ in the ministry of brother branham stooped down and told us you never did it you have no accusers you're forgiven in other words brother jesus came the first time declared it and jesus came in brother ramsey's ministry and declared it he said you don't have any accusers praise god you're forgiven go and sin no more to that guilty woman what are we we're a guilty church right we're a guilty woman but jesus makes us free and we go and sin no more let's stand to our feet praise god musicians can come i hope you can see that my preach at about 10 years ago it came came to my mind this morning let me read luke 17 30. there's two comings of the son of man even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so jesus stooped down to earth one time he raised back up and said ye without sin cast the first stone they left he stooped down again he touched the earth again and god touched the earth through the ministry of brother branham he touched the earth he expressed the word on the earth there it is right there he expressed his written word glory he wrote he had the written word on the earth he wrote his word on the earth amen he fulfilled his word on the earth the second time the son of man did oh my i remember that afternoon when that revelation came i sat and i sat in what's now haven's room i sat in there and studied for like three hours until god dropped that revelation down jesus christ had two the son of man had two stoopings to the earth because that song says stooping to woo to win to save my soul there it is oh how i love him oh how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all how do you remember that song praise god see he stooped down stoop down to woo and save our souls praise god i hope you can see it let's bow our heads church kasia can you put that picture back up there let's just with our heads bowed maybe we can look up for just a moment let's look at this picture one more time i'm sorry honey is this you today is this you do you feel like you're running from your your past every time anybody feel like that you're just running from your past now as a christian i'm not running from my past anymore because i've been serving god a long time but there's times where i feel like i'm running for my problems in my current life so you can look at this as just getting saved or you can look at this i've already been serving god but i feel like something's chasing me in my past and i want to be free from that i don't want to die i don't want to be guilty i don't want to be overtaken we don't want to be overtaken by satan is there is there anybody here that wants satan to overtake them and destroy their life i don't think so so picture yourself if you feel like you're past that your mistakes are hunting you down let me tell you there's a place of safety praise god there's a place of rest it's in the blood of jesus christ today and all he's got to do is run to him that's why we sing that song and he ran to me and ra in the reality church god's running to you praise god you might feel like you're running to him but

hallelujah even though we were guilty o god hallelujah you had a place of grace for each one of us oh god and lord may those who don't feel like they have that place may they find that place today
