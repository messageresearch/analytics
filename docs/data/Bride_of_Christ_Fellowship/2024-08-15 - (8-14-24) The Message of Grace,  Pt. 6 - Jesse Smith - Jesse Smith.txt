receive the word of God and we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you you being SE praise God so I want to look at uh the message of Grace part six I was ready to preach you know this part I thought I'd get to David last week but I didn't even get through Moses I really didn't get through all of Moses but I I might go back to Moses I think I maybe one more part on this you I don't understand you know I guess God just doing something you know because when I preached uh uh that first uh sermon um I only have taught two parts on it you know I I think serpent seed I only preached maybe two parts on it but for some reason I can get get you know six and seven sermons out of this one I don't know I guess it's just the it's the need of the people I imagine you know uh we just need we need God's grace Hallelujah I imagine it would just be that um trying to think of the previous title I can't think of the previous title but um oh yeah even perfect Faith just two sermons on that you know but uh we know if we have confessed our sins we can have perfect faith if we have confessed our sins and God makes something known to us then we just have perfect faith it might be something on the job it might be a relationship uh it might be finances uh it might be just personal healing or Victory or whatever uh if we can confess our sins and we're walking in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness and he can give us a leading right give us a word and then we can have perfect faith in that word amen what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to take all the mysticism from around that that that thought you know I'm just talking about in my life too you know uh and I think around the message you know people they think of perfect faith and like oh it's got to be something like the prophet of God it don't have to be just like that it just has to be you getting a word from God and then you believe God's word that's all had just that simple right the Bible said not all our Apostles not all our prophets not all our pastors not all our deacons everybody's got a place Hallelujah but everybody can have God's word hallelujah for their life so I just thought I just I don't didn't really plan to say that but amen anyhow Hallelujah so we even looked at Adam and Eve Noah Abraham Israel's a nation we looked at Moses I might go back there's maybe one more thought on Moses there but I don't want to get to that tonight and even last week I was very careful what I said with our visitor here our our Paige you know our good friend Paige right I was very careful I didn't want to use brother Bram too much so like uh like Paul said when Paul was here Paul Griffin he said you know when I see a visitor come in I maybe I'll take a little or I'll I'll say things differently you know because I don't want everything to go over their head right and so I tried to do that last week I I didn't maybe read all the quotes from brother Brandon because I I didn't want to uh you know I I didn't want to just maybe overemphasize that in in her sight for you and I it wouldn't be overemphasized because we understand his place in the scripture but with a visitor like that I just felt led to you know use less quotes you know just to uh make us not seem so odd but yet we're oddballs amen hallelujah we're oddballs every Christian always is a Oddball so I'm I'm jumping to David and like I said I had I had most of this ready last um Wednesday but I will let you know the parts as I was driving home today I was getting milk today and I was driving home and the Holy Spirit brought this thought back two years ago I heard a sermon on bitterness and I remember oh there was a part in there about David I knew I was preaching on David tonight uh I I I I relate so much to David you I can relate so much uh you know just wanting to be a just wanting to be a man after God's Own Heart Right yet suffering Temptation and so forth like that and um you know wanting to be victorious who doesn't want to be a Victor who doesn't want to take down Giants I mean Mercy there there's so much we love about David but as I was driving home the Holy Spirit must have brought this back because I haven't thought about this sermon uh on bitterness for two years I couldn't find it in my first search but then I went and found that part and so I'll let you know there's a little part in there I'm going to add in uh and I'm going to give the credit where the credits do it wasn't my thought it was from this brother from Canada so I just love how the Holy Spirit that's how I know it's the holy spirit because I'm not looking for it and then God will bring me thoughts like I was telling William I think I told I don't know if I told amen or Austin but last uh Saturday before the service I was studying and it's like a thought dropped down from heaven and it was two words secret believer and I was like that's a strange thought brother brandom said that and so I went and studied it there's 20 quotes on it so I got a sermon waiting to preach maybe Sunday I'll preach that one but it's that's a moment like I'm not thinking of that and something just drops down that's kind of how it was today that's how God does it with uh any gift you know something you just comes to you it's God coming to you Hallelujah right no man sought God right God's drawing Us in Hallelujah even when we seek God it's really By Invitation God's drawing Us in it's not like oh I'm such a holy Christian I'm going to seek God well no it's God drawing you into Fellowship praise God hallelujah we know we understand that but I want to look at David tonight uh one of of our favorite characters and if I always tell people if you haven't seen that David movie that's the best movie I've ever seen in my life I know I'm young I'm a young man I'm not an old man that's the best movie I've ever seen even my uh uh my brother shared that with my dad my dad loves that movie because it's a story of redemption I love how it focuses on the fall and then the Redemption at the end it's just a beautiful story no wonder so many people can connect to David because we all fall short of God's glory so brother Braham starts on this section he says whatat could we say of David now remember he just preached through all these people with Grace right he chose certain people by the leading of the Holy Spirit remember this remember this whole sermon brother Ram said was to was to prove that God was with his message of Grace just like God was with his message of the godhead where he saw the three rainbows brother said just like that God gave me this message on Grace and over the years I'm sure if you've listened to different ministers maybe brother Jose over the years I've been the message you know 20 uh basically 22 years uh I've heard so many preachers preach out of the message of Grace it's it's a very often quoted sermon because I believe because of that brother Braham brought such a great balance on the grace of God right I mean and next week we'll even look at some other statements he makes like you can't bargain for God's grace what an amazing statement like Esau tried to bargain for it well was tears he tried to get it back and God's like no you weren't called for this right you sold it out you know and and so like just amazing facts and then uh the one we we closed with last uh Wednesday night where brother randam said I hope my obituary or he said I hope my commentary about my life is just like Abraham's when God writes it that I didn't stagger at the promise of God that God only saw what I'm trying to do Hallelujah that's what I want written about my life God didn't see that mess up that mess up that mess up God will uh throw those in the sea of forgetfulness thank God for the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah I guess that's why there'll be no more sea we won't need any more forgiveness of sins because we'll have brand new bodies Hallelujah that just struck me there hallelujah what can we say of David the grace of God that great warrior to whom God himself said he's a man after my own heart that great warrior David how could he do such a thing as he done to take your right his Soldier when he had a handful of Gentiles out there as soldiers listen close to this little story just for a moment he says he says when they had their soldiers out there and Uriah was the one who stood by Dav remember he was I said yuah was a proelite he was a hittite remember even Hittites were not to come to the Tabernacle right God said no hittite no no no Pro no no moabit could come there for 14 Generations but see that was hyperbole right right because if they got converted then they could come in right Ruth was a moabitas she came in to worship because she was a proelite amen see so that means a unrepentant hittite a hittite that rejected God's grace a moabit that rejected the grace of God he was a proelite to the Jewish religion and them them men loved David so much I'll say like this we love Christ so much Christ is our David Hallelujah that's what he says next they seen the anointing was upon him although he was a fugitive he was oued out from his own country he had to live with the Philistines Saul was hunting him but yet those men they saw the anointing upon him they knowed he was coming into Power Glory to God now look what brother man says next he takes a spiritual application of this he says I'm so glad to be a fugitive today because I see that Christ is coming in to be king amen remember I can't remember exactly what it said about those uh those men that came to him in the cave they were all debtors the Bible said we had a debt we could not pay Hallelujah but Jesus came and washed that dead away Hallelujah so brother man puts himself as one of those Mighty Men eventually they became Mighty Men but they weren't Mighty Men At first amen Moses became a Meek man but he wasn't Meek at first Hallelujah but God molded him into a Meek man God molded David into a man after his own heart Hallelujah that's right he said he said you can elect all the kennedies and I'll say this the trumps and whatever more you want but Christ will be king the anointing is upon him and upon the me his message of his coming amen the the anointing is on the message of the pre-tribulation Rapture Hallelujah the anointing of God is on that Hallelujah and he'll be king brother Bram said he said what they do one day he was standing up there thirsting for a drink of water now I'm not going to read this tonight but you remember the Bible from the gate out there at Bethlehem when he used to go out there to her the sheep and you know what two of those men took a sword and cut through 15 miles of human flesh to get him a bucket of water because his greatest I'm sorry because his least desire was a commandment to them think of that and they cut through those men all the way to the top of that mountain to where they said he was standing it'd be about 15 miles they went through there and every man raised up they'll duel with him till they killed him went on through and took his bucket and got a bucket of water right through the enemy's line two men to get their King their brother a drink of water when he had the water there to drink but he wanted that water so it's a special request from the King and these men wanted to meet the king's special request Hallelujah he said oh God now now now brother makes himself one of those Mighty Men see he I like that he's placing himself in the scripture he said oh God let me take the sword of the word and cut through every organization to bring now to bring what now look what he's going to make the water to bring the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that's the drink Jesus wants tonight Hallelujah he wants us to keep baptizing people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the water Jesus wants a drink of I love this amen he said and the power of the resurrection and the Holy Ghost back to the people because he's coming into Power he's coming into Power he'll stand alone but it's cut through every organization cut through every Theory every man-made Creed until you bring the Savior back a sheep that's gone astray somebody bring back the Bible doctrines again that's what I'm doing amen of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says the grace of God hallelujah so whatever part you whatever part you have in there to get people baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to get them filled with the Holy Ghost in their soul Hallelujah to bring back Bible Doctrine amen whatever part you play You're the you're the a mighty warrior bringing that drink bringing that sacrifice back to Jesus you're bringing it back to him so he can have a good drink of it amen whether it's win Soul whatever it is that's you you're the Mighty Warrior fighting through every enemy line amen year after year month after month you're fighting through every enemy uh Power in order to bring Jesus what he wants Hallelujah he wants so saved amen he wants the power of God in the church he wants people baptized the right way in the water and in the soul Hallelujah I like how each person just keep talking to our new our new Believers like brother Nia come up and sister Z ie appreciate you talking to Nia because uh brother Nia come up he said brother Jesse there he said there's three baptisms I said that's a good thought brother Nia I preach that brother actually there's I underst understand what he was saying there's more than that but it was a great thought I was like that's right brother there's a baptism for your flesh the water there's a baptism they got in the Old Testament a a transformed mind and there's a baptism of the soul I said brother Nea you keep pressing in until you get all three I said I know you got one of them amen I I like that amen just keep feeding them the word of God that's what they need amen they need God's word hallelujah and when we draw people in with that we're actually bringing that water to Jesus our David hallelujah amen he said look at David how could he have done he said but then he he jumps back to the Mighty Man one of them jumped into a pit and killed a lion I think that was BAH if I'm not mistaken that's where Cam got that name cam kept that name secret for all those years he's like I didn't want to tell anybody that name I'm going to use that name for my son I'm like good brother good thought there not many Banias out there there's quite a few Malachi I love that name well when I saw my when I saw Malachi it me my messenger I was like God make him a messenger and we brother man said we all carry the message I'm not trying to pressure him to preach you know I already put enough pressure on the boys to preach around here you know uh but just when I saw that like ah so I like how cam you know saw that he's a might man how could David take 's wife that beautiful basba when he had 500 of his own now there just so you know there is no verse that says he has 500 wives the most I found was I think nine if I'm not mistaken nine or eight my wife might remember you remember how many wives okay oh seven okay it might be seven yeah might be seven but it was less than 10 that they actually list them they're listenting in the Chronicles um of course we know Dave I'm sorry Solomon had uh 300 wives 700 concubines so the Bible actually lists that but just FYI but he seen her taken a bath and there's the negligence now brother man says but she just forgot to pull the shades down when she was taking her bath and know that King made a trip there by there every day down over that wall now that's not exactly in the scripture either I I don't know if brother R read that from a commentary or uh brother B did read uh biblical fiction right um he talks about it Prince of the House of David brother am read it if you can look up the quote and the Messiah there there's other books he read uh that were biblical fiction so they they you have the Bible story but then they just add details to make it a really good story Lamplighter does that like with Titus comrade of the Cross that's a Biblical fiction story so I'm just letting you know uh alls the Bible says about basba why don't we just read it it's uh 2 Samuel 10 what what I've seen is that God showed Amazing Grace to bash Sheba and that's what I like about Sight and Sound you know not that really do any matters I just I just don't want to put anything on basba if she wasn't guilty of it you know like if the Bible don't say it then I just want to I don't want to put much on our sister we're going to see her someday we're going to shake her hand that's our sister it was verse uh two and it came to pass in an evening time that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman walk Wasing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon so it doesn't and then David sends for her she didn't you know the Bible doesn't give us any clues about her fault right and the fact she had four Sons a son was a very great blessing in the Bible the fact she had four four is Deliverance right Fourth Man of the fire uh it looks like God delivered her from what David influenced on her because God puts all the judgment on David okay so just just just so you know that that's what brother says brother says she was negle NE negligent to pull the shade down okay I I don't know now but you look at it you know like uh look at it you know like you would think if she lived there she could look up and see the king's you know Palace or whatever more you know just we just we don't want to add to the word of God okay so uh brother Ram then after says that brother talks about how women today they're not negligent they purposely take off their clothes I'm talking about evil women not our precious sisters God blesses you with the spirit of temperance amen hallelujah well brother man said he gets into that and uh uh how they're causing men to lust after them Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her in his heart already he says remember Sister you'll answer for committing adultery though you never done it actually in all your life but that sinner looked at you the way you dressed be guilty of adultery because remember you have to have a Spirit to wear those kind of clothes because you know and I know me too one time I told you this story one time I was walking around I was a football player I was walking home without my shirt on and these girls R by in a Jeep and they did I'm like who's whistling of me what no world they did the wolf whistle at me and I'm like oh maybe I should put some clothes on right you know it just in other words I know everybody knows if we take off clothes it's a sin and the church said amen it's a sin everybody has that oh what am I doing but you know when they start young they just get used to it and they they uh they get calloused what's the Bible say they lose their feeling they've lost feeling for it says uh she be she you'll answer the day of judgment for committing adultery and uh he he'll say look here look on my book it says committing adultery with who Mrs John Doe then Mrs John Doe what about that and she'd say well you know you I swear you know my record I never live with another man but my own but the angel answer her back but you dress yourself till you cause this man to commit adultery and you're guilty of adultery with him that's when he done it you are to blame you was the one that presented yourself now remember I always remember this verse and I don't want to forget it that's why I love going through the Bible over and over uh Proverbs uh I'm going to keep my spot there Proverbs 7:10 okay y I think that's the verse oh you're so fast bless your heart and behold there met him a woman with a tire of Harlot and a subtle of heart this has been written in the Bible for over 4,000 years I'm sorry 3,000 years because this is by Solomon right yeah Solomon 3,000 years that means it's just common knowledge right everybody knows when you take off your clothes it's a spirit of lust right and then I believe God will even show the secrets that was in that woman's heart the reason she dressed like that why did she dress like that not just cuz her husband wanted her to she wanted to as well right because we know people that do we love them but they have to have a willingness in their heart to do it don't they right because if they really wanted to be modest they'd be modest because the Holy Spirit would make you modest Hallelujah not didn't really plan to preach that either by God's grace Hallelujah now brother man says basba done wrong just like Eve done wrong and I like how uh they kind of did it on the Sight and Sound it's almost like he David forced bash Sheba into it like she just didn't have a choice I mean it was either death or go to David's Palace the King's house but really she should have chose to die and David probably would not have killed her anyway I don't know who knows maybe he would have I don't know but in other words you always have a choice like we were talking about remember all those marriage questions a few weeks ago there you always have a choice if you're an adult you have a choice death is a choice right because you have a choice am I going to live with a pure heart or an unpure heart a clean conscience or an unclean conscious we always have the choice right he said but basba done wrong just like Eve done wrong but Adam was included in it I think we're always Hing about women too now look what he says you sons of God so now he rebukes the men and the sister said I like brother Ram said uh he said you ought to uh you men ought to love your wives and he thought sister I forget the name of the sister he say sisters I thought I should have heard some more amens from you on that he said you sons of God men I know you're the strongest Bunch that's right the strongest sex you're over the women that's true so act like it but says don't overpower them to try to take some little girl ruin her life but be a Son of God tell her she's in the wrong and stand like a Son of God she's your sister yes sir he says what we try to do what so-called sons of God today belong to churches and take out every little girl they can like boys today will try to date every girl they can Brothers blasting the boys with their lustful Spirits right he says remember that's because uh there's an immoral woman may may be uh because some married man ruined her too so pot can't call kettle black in other words there's women that are guilty there's men that are guilty they're all guilty Hallelujah that's the point he's Mak it so just remember it's sin that does it all and we're all subject to death and should die for it when David did that evil thing look at listen this remember this I love this his own judgment should have killed him David judged himself even though he didn't know he was doing it he was judging himself guilty of death when that Prophet came up there he thought it was hid when that Prophet came up there and stood before him he said David is everything all right he said everything's fine 2 Samuel 11 right David in his high robes in his big crown and he had joob out there that great General and all the fighting going on he was keeping all the enemies off the borderlines and things and everything was going right he had a a baby by this basba and had poor little Uriah go out there and had joab stand by his side until he withdrew from him and the boy died when the son went down with a battle knife in his hand blood on his shield where he had stood for Israel yet a proelite he was to their religion think about that he left the P Pagan religion to come into the True Religion and the true religion is what killed him that's called friendly fire right that's called Friendly Fire he says joab came back and he says David thought well everything's all right now I've got his wife and everything will be all right got a baby but the baby took sick the baby started dying and he done everything he could to save the baby's life perhaps every doctor came no good finally the baby died there was afraid to tell David that the baby was dead and he died then he thought everything was hid so he comforted bash Sheba he had already taken her to be his wife after all those other wives and that old Prophet old baldheaded fellow of something I don't know why he always calls prophets baldheaded but it's I think a dramatic uh a dramatic act right he's trying to make it more dramatic he always said Paul had a big hook nose kind of thing he said old Nathan out of the woodness sat down and said David how's everything going and David said fine fine old prophet of God live forever Hallelujah oh he was just he thought everything was fine he thought he could hide it brother man says but you can't hide from God that's what we all need reminders of right we none of us can hide anything from God I think I said it on Sunday after the service but U brother brand said your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words are on earth that's how much God knows our thoughts right but he I was even quoting this scripture I think uh Sunday where was it uh Sunday night maybe maybe Monday on the drive the Bible said I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me I was like God give me the right thoughts Hallelujah help me to think the right thing I have a choice I can live in peace or I can leave or live in war right I can live in Temptation or I can live in peace peace of God cover me hallelujah amen hallelujah oh prophet of God live forever Hallelujah he was acting all religious but you can't hide from God he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the building this morning knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you've done for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God had revealed it to that prophet he said David there's a Rich Man live on this side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep oh he's very rich a man lived on this side of the road was poor had one lamb he treated like a daughter he fed it out of the same spoon he eat with that's like Simon eats from the same cups that his dogs eats from right that's the kind of love that he has he slept with the lamb everything was it was like a daughter to him and one day a visitor come so instead of the rich man taking one of his own sheep and making a feast for the visitor instead of that he went over and took the poor man's Lamb by force took the lamb and slay it and made a feast now that was David's passions see remember you got the three so what did David battle lust of the eyes lust of Flesh pride of life right think about I was thinking about this one think about uh Uzziah what did Uzziah Uzziah was that great king he was one of the greatest Kings of all but what was his battle pride of life he said I can be a I can be a preacher I can be a priest he went right into there and he got leprosy so what I'm saying is that Satan Works in all three channels and all three are equally bad right but every sin has repercussions Hallelujah that was David's passions he had 500 wives but when he seen uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wives to appease or satisfy his passions he went and took another man's wife and killed Uriah when she become a mother David didn't know what he was doing why he was ready to pronounce judgment now he didn't know what he's doing when he's speaking judgment on himself that's the way we are now like this that's the way we are and the church said that's the way I am that's the way you are we can always judge the other fella but when it comes to us oh that's different Hallelujah church I'm talking about your sin nature right I'm not talking about your soul Amen in your flesh or even sometimes in your mind if your mind's not renewed if you don't renew it every day if you don't renew your mind you'll think the worst thoughts and you and you might have done the very same thing but you'll put some judgment on somebody else that wouldn't be the same you'd put on yourself that's why Jesus said like brother MCB was preaching when you stand stand praying and forgive if you want to be forgiven right how many want to be forgiven David didn't realize see because he still had this he had there it is he has unconfessed sin like brother Dennis preached the last time uh hiding a sin right secret sins see see see when when when we when we have unconfessed sin it creates this uh like like a blinders on us right and we don't we can't see our real spiritual condition Hallelujah that's right that's the way we are always ready to pronounce judgment but not on ourselves David said this man will pay with his life that old Prophet them eyes narrowed down he said David surely you'll not die he said you're the man right you're the man that you just pronounced judgment on watch Grace there go to work right quick Amen in the hour when we deserve judgment I pray and I I ask that God will show us Grace in the hour where we deserve judgment Hallelujah that's what David got instead of God's judgment God gave him Grace God gave him Mercy although he in his own judgment remember the word of a king is absolute in his own judgment he should have he should have uh he should have died right and that was according to I I forget the chapter I think it's Leviticus 20 I can't remember the exact might be Leviticus 20 something you don't have to look it up on but I was reading in uh the says any adulterer should be stoned any murderer should be stoned there's two verses right he should have been killed on two accounts but God gave him Grace and the only reason I can think why is because God had to fulfill things through him in the rest of his life there was still work for him to do and also my wife found that verse U sent it to me the Bible makes it sound like this is the only major sin David ever committed that means think about that the rest of his life every other thing he did was really small like we'd say minor brother man tells us there's major sins there's minor sins I made a video of that earli this year that was really well received because people need to know that and with different kinds of sins are different consequences and so it's like David just did all minor sins can you imagine a life like that H God make us like that amen I told you this before I see all these preachers bigname preachers and it seems like every one of them had just one thing that you know I don't want to go through that I want to I I just want to have minor sins amen if God if God needs a like Brother Ray told us if God needs to protect me in a real small Church to do that then praise the Lord amen I'll be happy to be a bational pastor amen I'll be I'll be happy to work my tail off and not and and uh you know not not have many uh uh you know not have a full-time pastorship I'll be happy just keep me from sin amen help me to magnify the name of Jesus may I bring no reproach upon this glorious name that saved me Hallelujah First Kings 15:5 because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord and turn not aside from anything that must be major that he commanded him all the days of his life because the Bible said we sin every day right we have to Die daily this must mean in major sins he never turned aside except one time in all the days of his life save only in the matter of Uriah the hittite imagine that testimony there's only one major thing what a what a testimony like I can think of the biggest name message preachers I can find at least one on all the well except for maybe one every other preacher has one major thing like or maybe two I guess the more I think about I probably find more that's good what what I've noticed though is with a lot of them there is something major in every one of them but God help us to live such a life where we don't fall into any major sin now what was this adultery murder major sins right God help us he said watch he said David you'll surely not die that's Grace going to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet and saved David's life amen so so Nathan might have been walking up there to tell him he's going to die but brother man said right at that moment the Holy Spirit struck him and said David you'll not die amen God's giving you Grace in this uh murder and hiding of sin and and adultery I'm giving you Grace but you'll suffer for it let's read it verse 10 now therefore the sword I'm sorry 2 Samuel 12:10 sorry 2 Samuel 12:10 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus sayith the Lord behold I'll raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wise before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son talk about a punishment talk about a punishment he brother B said like he had all those wives he could have just took his passions with one of the wives but he didn't he stole another man's wife God said because of this someone will lay with your wives and publicly because you did a private sin so see that church I know we talked about secret sins right I just I just want private sins that don't go publicly David had a private sin that went publicly right we just want small private sins and the church said and by God's grace try to walk out of those amen try to live above those by the grace of God Amen just have little things that you battle verse 13 love this and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord shall also put away thy sin Thou shalt not die God think about that God put away murder can you imagine that God put away adultery it just reminds me last week three times God could have killed Moses he killed a man God put murder away he didn't circumcise his son he should have died for that God put that away church we serve a God who believes in Amazing Grace Hallelujah amen we know we serve a God who authors Amazing Grace Hallelujah then brother R said he could have died because of uh you know smiting The Rock instead of speaking to it God could have smoted him there but there was a consequence he had to wait about 1500 years to get in the promised land but he got there Hallelujah because God's a god of Mercy hallelujah amen because God won't disappoint us amen God won't let us down Hallelujah God sees all of our labor of love amen God sees our years and our decades God sees our labor love and God's not going to forget all that you do for him Hallelujah that's right Amen Hallelujah by and the prophet said surely you'll not die you'll not die David because Grace has saved you it was Grace at David that saved him brother R says oh my if it hadn't been for Grace where would we all be and the church said what if ever think about that what if your life was written in the Bible like that and some of your mistakes some of my mistakes were written in the Bible and everybody had to read about my mistakes so I I think I feel pretty little don't you everybody had to know all my mistakes but God allowed it right so see we must remember that God had Grace for each and every person and if God had Grace for that God has Grace for us hallelujah if it hadn't been for Grace where would we all be and I love what brother man says Sovereign Graces from a sovereign one he says Sovereign can do whatever it wants to that means God doesn't take anybody else's opinion he does what he wants to do so brother's defending how God forgave David God can do that because God's Sovereign he can do whatever he wants amen he can have mercy on the vessel he can make vessels of Mercy vessels of Honor or he can make vessels of Dishonor he can do whatever he wants you don't have to ask anybody amen so that's why we should pray God have mercy mer on me may I be a vessel of Honor Hallelujah let your mercy be on my vessel Hallelujah especially when I make mistakes Hallelujah especially when I fall short of God's glory let God have mercy on me he said Sovereign can do whatever once Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God's Sovereign so he can give out his Sovereign Grace and he said Sovereign Grace doesn't have to ask anybody it don't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful God don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do that can I must I will I it doesn't do it it does it itself because Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the viest he can save the worst he can save the impur he can save the immoralist and he he can heal the sickest brother said Hallelujah he said he can save a Wretch like Me and what is it it's Grace William brandom a drunker son that don't make any difference the grace of God save me hallelujah praise God he says I'm a son of a drunk man but God's grace could extend to me hallelujah hallelujah I think about what I'm the son of sometimes too my poor father but I'm just praying for grace I I know there's going to be Grace I know there has to be Grace there has to be God has to hear my prayers amen if I'm his beloved I'm just believing in God's grace I'm believing in secret Believers Hallelujah that's what I'm believing amen I'm believing there's secret Believers out there they won't come to church like I was telling brother William I was basically preaching the half of my sermon to him right standing out right out there after service brother let me preach to you you got a few minutes here let me preach my sermonette to you by God's grace he's like Oh Glory you know how he says it oh praise the Lord oh good I'm getting a good test here you know the church going to like this message or not it don't matter I'm preaching anyway God showed it to me I studied myself approved I'm going to preach it anyway I lost my train of thought but praise God God is gracious yeah they they might they might not come to church they might not uh they might not like your posts they might not like your videos they might not ever tell you they got saved but it's between them and God we don't know what happens between them and God that's why brother R said there's going to be surprise on the day of judgment because of secret believers people we never knew we thought they went to hell we never knew they secretly confessed their sins right and that's the group with the six acts in Matthew 25 they said Lord when did we do this see there they were secret Believers when do we when did we see you Jesus they didn't even know they weren't deep enough in the I'm already preaching my sermon for Sunday praise God they didn't know they didn't have enough Bible knowledge to know that Jesus Christ is in his bride like they they didn't know that it's Christ in you the whole they didn't even realize when I went to visit this True Believer When I visit them in the hospital they got sick or when they didn't have food and I fed them I was actually feeding Jesus Christ and so see what are they they're saved by grace because they were already a secret believer and just like on the thief of the Cross all they have to do it think think of that they just have to say in their heart God forgive me Jesus Is Right their their Way's right Lena's right Kristen's right Jose's right I can't live it like them but they're right God the the they serve the true God and if they say that in their heart and they say Remember Me Jesus will remember them Hallelujah because he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah amen he proved it right there on the cross without baptism without the Holy Ghost without nothing just a secret believer who in God's mercy just wanted to be remembered in he just wanted to be remembered in Mercy David he gave a judgment on himself 2 Samuel 12:6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and he had no pity he was talking about himself and I heard a preacher preaches this not my Revelation I'll tell you when it's my Revelation well I'm sorry not mine but when God gives it to me personally like with this the serpent seed in the Seven Seals I'll tell you what that those are just special moments but in David's judgment he needs to restore fourfold what he took this four-fold judgment God poured out on David remember that his four sons died terrible deaths four of his sons died terrible deaths because he killed Uriah it was first that baby 2 Samuel 12148 that first son the baby died because he pronounced judgment on himself and didn't Jesus say judge not that you be not judged so see God is the same yesterday today and forever the baby died even though David fasted prayed and he knew God could change God God can give another word right God can give another thus say the Lord it'd be the permissive will of God right we know that from hezekiah's Life second amn amod Dishonored and I'm saying that in a very general way wickedly Dishonored his half sister Tamar and then he was murdered by Tamar's brother but but amnon was David's son two sons murdered I'm sorry one died one Mur third Absalon was murdered Absalon won the hearts of the people right smooth talking I called a preacher on the internet I said you're you got an Absalon Spirit he's smooth talking people he calls me the Pharisee from akan I call him you got the Absalon Spirit you're a false prophet stealing people out of churches to do internet church I'm sorry you that's not scriptural you have to gather more as you see that day approaching sometimes you got to call him out Jesus called him out sometimes God revealed that to me while I was praying that's why I did that God revealed that to me while I was praying and reading my Bible he'd attacked me and I'm like I I was just waiting to get back at him now not in a bad way but I'm waiting to say what I what I believe and God gave me that I I read oh that's I was praying I read it I'm like there it is right there there it is he's got the Absalon Spirit lording over other people's sheep it's exactly right and remember Absalon was successful with his overthrow of David's Kingdom remember that David fled right and Absalon occupied Jerusalem he was finally anointed king of Jerusalem uh remember he lay with David's wives on the tent in front of everybody in front of everybody he took each one all the people could see him each one take one in at a time because of what David did in secret but then after David was out in the woods you remember this abson went out there to try to kill him he was going to kill his own father he says uh but absalon's forces were totally defeated and while he was trying to escape his long hair entangled him his Beauty entangled him just like Lucifer he got entangled he was lifted up because of his beauty of his heart and that's why brother Bram says oh yeah one of my girls heard uh I think it was Haven or Carris one of my girls I was listening to brother brandom and brother brand said beauties of the devil and they said Daddy is beauty of the devil I said well you got to understand it you know I said was it you Haven yeah and I had to say oh and I understand that's a great question that's a great question it's not a sin to be beautiful it's a sin to make yourself uh uh to make yourself immodest and what and be beautiful according to the devil's standards and people attack brother B for that shame on them they just don't they just take him out of context they just take them they just don't keep reading they just they don't they stop reading right they splice his quotes to their own shame and Folly but look he got entangled because of his so-called Beauty he was left hanging while the mule rode off he was dispatched by joab uh and then he oh yeah yeah then he was killed yeah that's right he was killed while he was hanging he's think about that he's he's got these beautiful hair he's hanging there in the tree and he gets shot and killed and that's how he dies that's number three he pronounced a four-fold judgment on himself the fourth one you might remember this one is adonijah this is the one I needed more reminding on I'd forgotten about him he was the fourth after the death of amnon chileab and abson he became the eldest son and then when DAV was getting older strength was declining he tried to take the crown remember that he tried to take it from Solomon remember that and then remember he ran for Mercy right he took hold of the horns of the Altar and Solomon gave him Mercy but then uh after the death he begged for basba uh so he could marry abishag who' been the wife of David in his old age this was regarded as being equivalent to a fresh attempt on the throne because she was she had to she spent that time with David as a wife he's trying to take the wife of the former King so it is equal to trying to take the throne because he's trying to take the wife of the king the previous King and there uh Solomon ordered him to be put to death by bah there we go another bah there so remember the the Bible says God will not be mocked whatever a man SWS that shall he reap right and he pronounced judgment a four-fold judgment that's what he got right and as Jesus said judge not that you be not judged that's why I love even brother Dennis we I preach it over the years too he said what was the best thing Jesus said on the cross father forgive them they don't know what they're doing Stephen did the same thing think about that even before those stones started deforming his head think about think about how those peaches get deformed that's what his head was like you know you squeeze a peach but before that he'd already fallen asleep hallelujah praise God going home to see Jesus Hallelujah and before think about that before the first th Stone hit him he'd already say forgive these people for now what would you think if someone had a gun at you and they're about ready to shoot you would you say oh forgive them I hope we would by God's grace I hope in that moment the spirit of God will give us Supreme faith for the Supreme hour because we might live to see it we don't know someone's going to live to see it we might have to go through that Christians are already dying in Nigeria Iran China uh Kenya all the hundreds of thousands of Christians are dying around the world already they already go through that why are we here well there must be something God wants us to do praise God but this is the faith that they had and God will give you faith for the hours uh that you needed in your darkest trials Hallelujah for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again Hallelujah so however we judge others that's how God will judge us David's the example so how many want to be merciful I want to be merciful without being what's the word without compromising right I want to be merciful without compromising now it might look Mercy might look like compromise especially with David that kind of looks like what is going on there how could this man get to live a murderer and an adulterer like Grace is Sovereign Grace does what it wants God had more things he had to fulfill he had to keep storing up all the uh all the gold and silver and wood for the temple right and he had to get Solomon in there Hallelujah he had to do it there's his his ministry wasn't done yet right so God showed Mercy on David also thought this too God had mercy on David because David could have took Saul's life twice and God saw he said I so respect him I won't touch God's anointed that's one reason I think God had mercy on David he had the spear right there remember the movie he could have he could have took it right there he said I'll just cut off a little piece of the skirt of His Garment I could have taken your life but I'm not going to because I believe in Mercy amen I believe in Gra cuz I'm going to need it Hallelujah I'm going to need it later on and he sure did need it by God's grace Hallelujah church I want to look at this here um I had this in my notes um 2 Samuel 12 I didn't read it yeah verse n wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight so when David decided when he looked down there he despised the Commandment think about that he knew the Commandment don't take another man's wife but in that moment he wasn't fighting he's like I don't care what the Bible says I have passions and I want her go get her the word despise means to disdain I can't stand that command it also means to regard with contempt to scorn or dismiss I dismiss these Ten Commandments why do I have to follow them all the time why can't I just have a break from it every now and then he despised the command of God it means to to be vile to be worthless this these commands are worthless I can't stand I got to obey these all the time that's what happened when he got the comp or I'm sorry the lustful Spirit there it is the lustful Spirit maybe it was a complex too you know complex over a beautiful woman I don't know I'm just saying but this is think about that a mighty king who he wrote songs he praised god let's praise the Lord there's joy in the house of the Lord today but because of whatever happened I can't stand this why disre I'm dismissing this I don't this is a worthless command I need that woman Nathan said because you did that here's what's going to happen the sword will never leave your house David paid deeply for his adultery and murder because he despised the Commandment of God and I love what oh yeah even God said that he said because you despise me God said because you despise me where's that verse I wrote it down I think it was nine and 10 or no was it 10 yes yeah thank you Mal because thou despised me it was thus sayith the Lord You've despised me not only to despise the word of God he despised God now what kind of evil spirit could have convince him to say I have you know that I got to have that woman although I've got all these other ones she's so much better I got to have her than all these other ones the Bible said a a wife is like a a a a well Brothers right just drink from your own well right but this evil spirit come on him and think about that despise where where do we hear that word despise before Mall despised David's dancing she despised him why you got to take off your King's robes and wear that uh ephod why you got to dance like that naked he wasn't naked he just took off the king's robes he had the ephod on so David despises God just like Mcall does Mcall got the Judgment David got Grace amen hallelujah why cuz David was a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah and it was Grace it was Sovereign Grace amen Sovereign Grace Church that's what I'm trusting in I'm trusting in Sovereign Grace because I won't make it by my works I'll make it by Amazing Grace Hallelujah no matter what mistakes hopefully all my mistakes are small God's grace I got 22 years into this message and all small mistakes as far as I understand as far as I Believe by God's grace now people on the internet might say different they might call me any might call me this and that and he's crazy the way you call crazy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers Hallelujah I'm just quoting Paul so look God had mercy God had Grace on David uh the timeline of David's life um he defeated Goliath around 15 to 20 years old then he was a fugitive uh uh from 25 to 30 so about five years he was a fugitive no home from cave de Cate wondering am I going to live uh am I going to die remember he was so convinced he moved to the Philistine country and was on the Philistine Army he was so convinced that his King was or his father-in-law was going to kill him he joined the bad guys Z always talks about the good guys and the bad guys where's he at David joined the bad guys because he was so afraid that's what fear would do right but then he became king of Hebron from 30 years old to 37 at 37 he became king over all Israel now think about your age church at 47 most people believe at 47 is when he committed that with bash Sheba 10 years 10 years of Victories 10 years of undefeated right what's that song say about David David can't do anything right David can do anything this is why God made him King for 10 years he thinks I can do anything and then he thought well I can take her too I can do anything I despise the command not that one can't do that you'll pay for it two years later Tamar was ravished and then his son died right of course the first baby died amnon died two years later when he's 49 from 50 to 53 years old had the three-year famine now look when God brought it look look when God brought it right after he did this evil think about that three years how many of us like to go three years where there's not much in the fridge I don't think anybody would say Amen to that but he had to suffer through that and then he did the at 55 years old remember uh tens of thousands of people died in that tens of thousands people three days of famine right at 61 abson became King as a 61 year old man he had to flee and Absalon died when he was 61 of course as then later he got back at 65 to 67 he was so exhausted in battle he couldn't fight anymore they died five to uh five to three years later at 70 so from 47 to 70 the last 23 years of his life the sword never left his house pain here pain here tragedy tragedy tragedy tragedy because of he despised the word of God and he acted on it remember Church there's a four-step process for sin go to James 1 I just struck me right now you got to stop it before uh it conceives you and I have to stop sin before it conceives just like the four horse riders right you got to stop it don't let it turn into action Hebrews and James verse 14 James 1:14 but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and entice and when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death so you have uh you have lust and then lust enticed you got to stop it before it gets to sin now we know thoughts are sin too but I'm talking about the actions of sin like David's actions of adultery and murder you got to stop it before it becomes the actual physical act right Church you got to stop it there will be consequences God will not be mocked right David paid for every or David paid the rest of his life for that I will uh yeah I'll preach one more I'm gonna preach one more thought now this is the thought I got from the brother from Canada okay this is not my original thought I heard it two years ago and I'm like I'm going to save this I'm going to put this in my back pocket for one day well today is that day I take it out of my back pocket just a beautiful thought um if you got your put up here H um geta um 2 Samuel 1623 2 Samuel 16:23 I'm closing with the life of uh a hopel that's a tough name to say a hopel now look what the Bible says about him and the Council of a hopel which he counseled in those days was as if a man had inquired at the Oracle of God so was all the counsel of ayapel both with David and with Absalon so here's a mighty Gifted Man talk about wisdom think about that you ever had a friend or ever had just a moment where it's like someone told you exactly what you needed to do and it was like the wisdom of God opened it up and like there it is you just spoke the word of God to me that's how ayel was all the time he walked up and said say go do this brother he say sister you need to go say that you're like whoa it's like you've been talking to God but Church no matter what gifts we have we have to be careful to keep bitterness out of our hearts because that's what happened to him now the sermon from the brother was called bitterness right and brother Dennis preached on it and then I preached on it two weeks ago right in the other The Green Room now what is amazing church is that go to 2 Samuel 17 yeah 171 when absin comes in a h theel now now I'll get to more why later but he at at this point in the next chapter he turned on David before he gave David thus sayith the word it's like I'm talking to God wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom all the time you have this gift of wisdom but here he turns on David we'll see why in just a moment moreover a hopel said unto abson let me now choose out 12,000 men and I'll rise and pursue after David this night I will he's like I'm going by myself I'm going to go chase that man down so he's one man chasing another man right and I will come upon him while he's weary and weak-handed I'm gonna wait till he's weary and weak and will make him afraid now look see what this bitterness does the bitterness wants to find you in a bad condition and then bring the fear on you like that's what that uh that's what that event from April did oh the identity theft I can't think of that man kind of I didn't get good sleep last night not gonna say why Zion I guess I would say why that's just Happ we had a long day yesterday see that's what the uh bitter Spirit would do and church I know what I'm talking about I had toward my dad I know what I'm talking about I've been there Hallelujah the church said I mean we all we all battle this and all the people that are with Him shall flee and I'll Smite the king only so he's like I'm going on a oneman mission I'm GNA be like a I don't know some type of a oneman army and I'll chase him down I'll wait till he's he's weak and tired and then I'll come on him I'll bring fear on him I'll both swords out or however you know whatever drama he says and I'll strike him dead and I'll kill him I'll make him afraid sounds sounds like those uh Hamas guys right they want to put fear in you before they actually kill you that's what but he now remember before all he did was talk about God God gave him exactly what to say but bitterness turned his heart away from God and now instead of giving David the word of God now he wants to bring death on David now here's the background that why this is important to this uh sermon today now in this chapter ayapel gives his advice and then another man gives his advice abson doesn't take a Hy's advice so it's like he's sad I've lost my anointing I've lost my favor he goes and hangs himself a man that was so used by God all the time to give thus say the Lord the oracles the wisdom of God he gets a bitter Spirit he wants to kill David he doesn't get the chance to he goes commits suicide now what happened to him here's the kicker in the uh Smith's dictionary it said he was a prively counselor of David whose wisdom was highly esteemed though his name had exactly opposite sign signification his his name means brother of foolishness that's what his name means brother of foolishness he became a fool because he let the spirit overtake him here it is church he was the grandfather of basba so what caused him to be bitter imagine some of you men some of you parents imagine your children have children ayapel was bash sheba's grandfather so he stood there he he knew David well he would give David all kinds of thus say the Lords right but he watched David take his granddaughter adultery and then he watched David kill his granddaughter's husband and that caused him to go against David now church I'm not saying it's easy to forgive I've told I've told everybody this I've always preached this you have to forgive but you're still going to have scars you're still going to feel it when you think about people right you're still going to think about people you're still and these are extreme sins most of us thank God most of us haven't don't have to deal with some of these things some people do but H Hy theel instead of seeking God for forgiveness and mercy he took the bitterness and he used it to try to destroy David see that so now we can see a little bit more about basba and this see this puts basiba in a very good light right because even her grandfather is trying to avenge what happened to her right that's why it doesn't seem like basba did anything wrong other than I mean she could have died right that's the only choice she had and then God will bless her later on right with four Sons they're in the lineage of Jesus Christ God puts bash Sheba in his family because God is a god of Grace let's stand to our feet and church why I bring this out is I just had my notes here he's a man who had such a close walk with God but then he became bitter against David it seems he was trying to avenge himself but remember I love the Bible says vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord this is a sermon about Grace hallelujah thank God for Amazing Grace just play marvelous Grace I think we sang that a couple weeks ago by the grace of God yeah I think I'll preach maybe one more part on this here uh Lord willing let's bow our hearts here before the Lord here today I love the story of David because it's a story of redemption it's such a warning to us [Music] is such a profound story such incredible victories in his life and then such incredible Loaves and [Music] failures but that's why God is a god of Grace David's life makes me want to draw so close to God makes you want to pray and ask him repeatedly I don't know if I'd say the word beg but I just oh God don't let me do a major sin God do everything in your power to keep me humble to protect me as brother Ray told [Music] us that could live such a humble life of [Music] Grace that I would never despise the commands of God I would never despise the word of God I'd never despise you Lord God but I would just learn to trust you like Ron hesterman he says the Lord gives and the Lord takes away we're so richly blessed especially to live in America Lord God as Christians are dying all around the world Lord God thank you for the favor you've given to us thank you for making us vessels of Honor Lord [Music] God but I believe you brought these thoughts to me Lord God today that they' be a help to the people of God your word is always inspiring your word always has [Music] life Jesus you said my words are spirit and they are life [Music] Lord I'm reminded of some key points Lord help us before we speak a judgment against someone help us Lord to remember Mercy we're so quick to judge the other guys as your Prophet said but when we judge ourselves well that's different Lord help us to be the same for everyone Lord God like Nathan to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord God Lord this is not an easy part of David's life to preach I knew it wasn't going to be a shouting maybe rejoicing message although it does make me rejoice in the grace of God hallelujah in my soul makes me thankful for your protection on my life Lord [Music] God and even Lord on the words where you had Nathan tell David the Lord has put your sin away from you Lord and we know the word remission means to send away you put our sins far away from us Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus that you separate our sins as far as the East is from the West Lord God we thank you for tender compassion Lord God Tender Mercies and Lord this makes me think of my father I pray you'd help my father to overcome bitterness Lord I've prayed with him before I've asked him
