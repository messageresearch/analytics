praise God amen let's say it and take our Bibles tonight by God's grace let's get right into the word of the Lord it's good to be with the Saints we missed you this weekend and God bless everybody hope you had a wonderful time and the Lord we sure did we went to brother cams and just a wonderful service I didn't preach I just got to sit back and feed on the word it was just a tremendous message can't preach a great message on harvesting and hopefully maybe he'll preach it this weekend we'll see what the Lord has I never tell anybody what to preach you know sometimes ask Simon if he'll preach a certain message like when he preached her proceed a few years ago I did request that that was a great blessing and he preached the church age sermon last year I really enjoyed that I wanted to hear that so I'll be writing on that topic soon but very thankful by God's grace I got a few scriptures let's go to Book of Psalms here tonight I like to look at the purpose series again I know last Wednesday we left you off with Revelation 12 but as I was studying and preparing I just had a few thoughts I just couldn't get away from that usually is how God works with me I'll take those thoughts search them out and preach them by God's grace oh I'm 39 for so I'm 39 four and then we'll go Lord willing to James 4 so start at the Psalms 39 4 yeah we got up there why don't we read this one together here on three one two three Lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that I may know how frail I am now you just go to James 4:11 Hebrews and James James 4:11 tonight we'll be looking at the temporary assignment I left you off a couple of Sunday nights ago with the trust how God sees our life as a metaphor of a trust and we had one more left and that God likens our life to a temporary assignment James 4:11 I'll read this inand will read one more speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evils of his brother and judges and brothers speak of the evil the law and judges the law but if thou judge the law thou arts not a doer of the law but a judge there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life that's a great question is it what is your life is it even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanishes away for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now you rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing as evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and do it there not to him and is sin let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here that's the Lord to speak to us if you ever need on your heart just making on unto God Heavenly Father or my hands are up Lord I surely need you tonight thank you for this gathering thank you that we can cast our burdens down Lord and father we feel so much better when we do that Lord God when we confess our sins or we stop confessing unbelief but we start quoting your word it feels so much better thank you for your guidance Lord God speak to us tonight Lord on this temporary assignment let your will be done Lord God manifest your sweetness of your presence that we might draw closer to you and Lord as your prophet said our main reason for gathering here is to find our weak spots and father that we might be better Christians we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God well have a few slides here I'm gonna be quoting a little bit out of chapter 6 out of the book and I got the thought I want to get to is how brother Branham struggled I mentioned that a few weeks ago but brother Branham struggled greatly at the end of his life and that was a thought that struck me I thought oh I never really searched that out so I want to show at the end of the message how much brother Branham suffered at the end of his life and we know he had the stomach problem that there was other other sufferings he was going through and I'm not sure how much I don't know if I've ever preached on that or not by wanting to bring it out to the church tonight by God's grace how many thankful you know God's purpose for your life praise the Lord amen surely thankful for that I didn't read Psalms 119 but the Bible does say in the scripture we're strangers on the earth David said I'm a stranger I'm a pilgrim in a stranger right we've seen that song I'm a pilgrim and a stranger so that is so true we looked at the four metaphors of God's view of our purpose we saw a couple Wednesday's ago how it's a race we've got to run the race and then it's also a test we have to pass the test that the teachers given to us and then a couple Sunday nights ago we looked at how it's a trust God is entrusting us with a talent and we saw a talent was like I what was it $160,000 that's one talent and then the Jesus I'll give you one somebody gets to that's like 320 and then somebody got five which was like eight hundred and sixty thousand dollars during their lifetime and that's what they were to invest in the kingdom of God and so we've got to be faithful with what God gives us praise the Lord and tonight no let's look at this temporary assignment I'm not gonna review I think I'll just get right to the Word of God if I have time too I want to show you a little a video up and I watched one time and it was just a really good illustration of how life is so temporary I'm not sure if you ever seen it but I want to show it to you it's another preacher he's not in the message but it's a good illustration so I'm gonna pull some thoughts from my reading year as I've been reading back going back over I read it one time last year I've been going back over it and kind of meditating on it I want to just read a few portions out of here and like I said I'm the main thought is to show our brother branham struggled in this temporary assignment in life although he was a prophet he saw visions had innumerable miracles we'd say he still struggled greatly and he had a difficult time and he even longed even long to go home even long to to be finished with this temporary assignment and to go see Jesus and so when times when we feel like that we know that's normal right because Paul said there's times I wish I could he said I want to be absent from the body to be with Jesus but he said then I want to be with you he said I'm in a strait betwixt the two he says I don't know which one I should do should I stay with you and helped you teach you or should I go be with the Lord so it was hard for him now I want to just read a few quotations here it says life on Earth is a temporary assignment the Bible is full of these metaphors we've gone through them too make the best use of your life you must never forget two things compared to Eternity life is extremely brief second earth is only a temporary residence you won't be here long so don't get too attached right think about that how long did Solomon live Simon lived 3,000 years ago David lived 3,000 years ago have they spent more time on earth or they spent more time in glory think about that this is just a very short time we're here we're going to spend wealth the Lord tarries I guess we won't spend too much and if we get raptured and the Lord doesn't tarry we actually spend more time here but most of the saints that have lived before us in the Bible the Old Testament nu have will definitely be longer there than they were here right but for us it could be different if we're some of those blessed the Bible said those that are alive and remain praise God that's my desire to be alive and remain when Jesus Christ comes but even if not the Bible said the dead in Christ rise first I'll rise first right will rise first in our order he said you won't be here too long so don't get too attached to Akron Ohio right or wherever you live Florida or Georgia and he says ask God to help you see life on Earth as he sees it remember opening scripture David said lord help me to realize how brief my time on earth will be help me to know that I'm here from just a moment more my life is so frail right our time here so short help us to see our life as a temporary assignment the Bible compares life on Earth to living in a foreign country and we know that it reminded me of when I went to Guyana I've been there four times but when I would go there at church I wasn't really I wasn't really caring about who was around me I was there I had one purpose there I was there to preach the gospel and I could forget it I did have to pay bills mine was such a glorious time I didn't have to return anybody's emails because I had no cell phone service it was one of the greatest you know 10 or 13 days of my life no responsibility all I had to do was just preach the study fast and pray preach pray for the sick that's all I had to do but you know our lives are like it unto being in a foreign country the Bible calls us pilgrims strangers aliens sojourners visitors travelers that's what describes our time on earth well I'm gonna read that Psalms 119 19 let's read I'll just read that because I do believe it says literally that you and I are strangers here I'm not gonna pull it up there cuz I got to switch over from one thing to the next so one 1919 here it is it says I am a stranger in the earth hide not thy Commandments from me amen David says I'm a stranger look he was like a alien that was sent down to earth and killed Goliath like an alien he was like it invading he was like an invading alien praise God and that's what we are right that's what we we came from the mind of God and we're down here so journeying for a little time and our purpose is to destroy the works of the Satan while we're here amen sorry you know just like David took down a natural giant we're supposed to take down spiritual Giants hallelujah we're supposed to do more than just take down natural things we're supposed to move mountains Church what's bigger a giant an eight-foot giant or a mountain a mountains bigger we're supposed to move mountains with God's Word amen hallelujah thank God we've seen it praise the Lord and the little miracles God's done here he's moved mountains for people praise God very thankful for that now Peter says at first Peter 1:17 if you got your Bible and turn there of course you don't have to just take me a moment to get there first Peter 1:17 Peter states it plainly he says and he says if ye call on the father who without respect to persons judgeth according to every man's work past the time of your sojourning here in fear so see we're just so journey we're just here for a little journey but we must pass our time here in fear we must live in the fear of the Lord that's right he says then you'll live be holy for I am holy praise God so the only way will live holy here is to remember that I'm just here for a short time I'm not gonna be here very long that's right now Healy gives an illustration about a green card so I don't know if our sisters have had green cards or not do the dude you have green cards okay so he says in California where I live many people have moved from other parts of the world to work here but they keep their citizenship with their home country they're required to carry a visitor registration card called a green card which allows them to work here even though they aren't citizens Christians should carry a spiritual green card to remind us that our citizenship is in heaven and I do it's called the baptism of the holy ghost hey it's our seal and I pack it with me everywhere I go praise God that's our seal it's our mark right it's a mark it's my token Amen hallelujah it's my ticket that I was from another country I'm going back there amen he says God says his children are to think differently about life from the way unbelievers do he said real believers understand that there's far more to life than just a few years we live on this planet your identity is an eternity and your homeland is in heaven when you grasp this truth you will stop worrying about having it all on earth God is very blunt about the danger of living for the here now and adopting the values priorities and lifestyles of the world around us when we flirt with the temptations of this world God calls it spiritual adultery let's read that James for James 4:4 that's scriptural I told you this is a pretty good book couple of the Saints and tomia I'm not one to read that book and I said you ought to read that book you can't afford a copy let me know I'll get you one you ought to read this this is a good read it's very short that's broken up into 42 short chapters you can read one chapter a day and it's just full of the scripture you just gotta watch out for two trinity references we will not fellowship with three persons in heaven I put that on Facebook this week and nobody said anything about it nobody can say anything when Ezekiel went to heaven he saw one God sitting on a throne when Isaiah went to have an N see three gods he saw one God and his train filled the temple can you imagine that train that train that write that great robe that he had he saw one person when John went up to heaven in Revelation 4 he said I saw one God seated on the throne amen he didn't see 3 Thrones he saw 1 throne he saw one person for four James 4:4 now look at this the adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of this world is enmity with God who sever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God now you're gonna see I'm gonna close to this thought brother Branham had lots of friends in this world in fact the people he was most friendly with were people from Jeffersonville did you know there's a family there's a family in Jeffersonville I was watching a video for one of the families from Jeffersonville and their family owned a hotel and brother bran would have preachers stay there and they said every year program when he would go hunting he would and he would get game he would bring some of those steaks and give it to them every time and they didn't go to his church and they weren't very religious and that was the man's testimony he was just saying brother Branham was a loving man brother Branham was a giving man and that's and so all even though they didn't go to church all they only had good things are saying about brother Branham see cuz he was a friendly man he was a good man he's somebody you want to be around right amen but he said friendship with the world is enmity with God so brother Brandon bring a friend of the world those worldly people or whatever the nominal Christians that wasn't the friendship they're talking about here the friendship they're talking about here is sinning with the world right because the Bible said you have lusts so when you when you enjoy the lust of the world that's enmity against God not being kind to Catholics or Baptists or or Lutheran's or or Buddhists or something like that I saw my Buddhist friend this week and she said hi mr. Smith how you doing I said I'm doing good I'm phrase the Lord I'm doing good you know because she told me one time that you're the first real example of Christianity that meant a lot to me so we can be rhymes with the world we just can't enjoy their sin we just can't lust after the things they lust after shouldn't lust at all so see God calls it spiritual adultery when so-called Christians lust after the things of the world that's spiritual dull sure because it's not our home so you love the things of the world love of God's not in you now he gives the illustration imagine you were has to be a basa dur for your country and let's say you went to Ghana let's say you went we'll just use Ghana since we have Ghana representatives here today did you see bender art was in Ghana this week did you see that on Facebook yeah he was in God and he was preaching to God I don't maybe brother William saw but he had some good pictures there with the Saints and Ghana he said suppose though you became so comfortable when you're visiting the foreign country that you fell in love with it preferring it over your homeland your loyalty and commitment would change your role as an ambassador would be compromised instead of representing your home country you'd starting like you start acting like its enemy you'd be a traitor so let's say we all went to Ghana and say oh I love this I like to stay here forever and then that would mean we'd be a traitor to United States if we're supposed to be ambassadors of the United States we're supposed to represent the United States interests in Ghana but instead we fall in love with the warmth no more snow which we might like that but we would be a traitor to our purpose of being an ambassador and bringing the word or economy of us to Ghana and that's the point he's making he said sadly that's what many church members do the Bible said we are Christ's ambassadors right we're heaven's ambassadors come down to earth that's right now let's go another scripture here let's go to Center in these five 20 and then first Peter 2:11 sin Corinthians 5:20 let's read that real quick this shows were the ambassadors of heaven I'll be honest sure sometimes I have I go through struggles sometimes I forget that I'm an ambassador from heaven I'm not supposed to act like this is my home I'm supposed to act like I came out of God I am and we all forget no we I know I forget sometimes sometimes I just forget I just get in the routine of paying the bills and going to work and I forget that I'm I'm really not I'm not really here gonna be here very long I'm supposed to act like I'm representing heavens interest and I'm supposed to do the father's business and I'm supposed to bring the Kingdom of Heaven to other people's lives that's right 2nd Corinthians 5:20 now can you read that for us you got it oh okay it's got I thought maybe you guys had a new Bibles out there sorry now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God so Paul saying I am in the stead of Christ I am acting like Jesus Christ to your church he said be reconciled to God I'm sent down from heaven Paul saying I'm sent down from heaven I'm God's ambassador I'm standing where Christ would stand if he was here and I'm saying be reconciled to God in other words let heaven and earth kiss amen let heaven come down to earth and now you be an ambassador for heaven as well yes now go to first Peter 2:11 back to first Peter first Peter 2:11 alright I'm in the wrong book first Peter 2:11 dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul now beseech means to beg right so Peters can imagine a preacher begging a preacher that's walk with Jesus on water a preacher that's been done so many miracles people got healed in his shadow and he's begging them would you please be a stranger and pilgrim on this and don't get involved in fleshly lusts which war against the soul don't let money or sexual relationships or anything no than anything war against your soul against heaven now this is why this scripture is why many people can never have peace with God because the Bible said when a Christian tries to enjoy the things of the world it starts a war inside of them and they constantly feel no peace with God they constantly feel like they're fighting against the Holy Spirit and they are there grieving the Holy Spirit and it brings war to their soul and what is the soul it's the nature of a person so they're there their desires that their fleshly desires that their worldly nature is still holding on the things the world and it wars against the nature of God in other words the unholy nature they have is warring against the holy nature of God amen praise God not only do we have to fight demons right church we're going to fight demons outside of us we've got to fight wars inside of us sometimes can you imagine that by now we've got to fight demons up here my metals up here sometimes the battles right here am I saved or not mine well I am I having such a struggle am I going to heaven or what's going on and we battle that because at the same time we're flirting with the world with fleshly lusts but when you cast our lust out then you have peace with God a man it's no more Waller you're not struggling with that anymore because you you're not fighting against God you're letting God's spirit flow through you how many one have peace with God I don't want experience war against God war my soul I would have peace with God in my soul and that goes for all of us it creates a war in your soul so not only you have the ever fought right here sometimes people have Wars of the soul that's pretty good that's a good thought some people are fighting wars on two battlefields brother Aaron I'll just take one battlefield I don't really want to fight too more bad two battles because I just want one battlefield is that right Church amen how many just want one battlefield I don't want to battle Satan on two fronts now you might sometimes you might have to like if you get sick and you gotta cast up say Satan get behind me Satan get Miami by your stripes I'm healed by you have to fight so there's times we might the fight on two fronts but I certainly don't want to fight on three fronts and I in you and I are the only ones who can limit the number of battlefields because you and I have to cast out any lip fleshly lusts which war against the soul so the choice is ours you can fight as many battles as you want but I would like to limit my battles right I'd like to limit my battles I'd like to just fight the battle of the mind amen Jesus keep me healthy the Bible said I would that you prosper in health even as your soul prospers amen that's it right there glory help me just to keep this battle on one battlefield the Battle of the mind in church I'm you know if you get up early and pray right away read your Bibles sing worship right away how many know you're gonna really have much better time in that battle of mind oh yeah you have much better time if you can put God first he said I pray brother that's how I pray first of a morning first he prays and your battle be greatly lessen if you can pray first I like that that's a good scripture there this world is not our home praise God now let me go a little bit further here okay I was looking for the scripture okay there it is where I left off first corinthians 7 31 let's read another scripture here i want to show a video and i want to show about programs life here 731 actual church jump up 229 now this is speaking of marriage so you got to take this in context here and it's it's from a man who was not married right so it's Ron Paul because there's times in this chat where Paul says this is me not the Lord right because Paul says I wish all of you didn't get married now who wouldn't like that one I would not like that so much I like to get married but Paul was the so he was so Stern he said this is not the Lord this is me I wish all of you didn't get married well that's okay that's a good thought for him but look what the Bible said 29 but this I say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both a that have wives be as though they had none so Paul was so sure the rapture is gonna come he said you should live even if you're married live like you don't have a spouse verse 20 30 30 and they that weep as though they weep wet not and those that rejoice as though they rejoice them and they that buy as though they possessed not so what he's saying here don't get caught up in one thing don't get caught up and just rejoicing all the time or weeping all the time don't get stuck in a spot right don't miss out on your calling he said if you're stuck in a calling he said get out of it and try to serve the Lord verse 31 and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passes away everybody has got one of these cell phones right and it's okay to have one as long as you don't abuse it is that right it's okay to have one of these TVs as long as you don't abuse it with sin that right it's okay to go to school as long as school doesn't exalt itself against the Word of God some people say brother an was against education no I can show you about four quotes where brother Graham based his preaching schedule upon the education of his children it meant so much to him that sometimes he wouldn't preach in tabernae at the brown tabernacle because he had to go out back out west for the kids school what brother man is saying never exalt science above God's Word right never exalt any thing above the Word of God course true science will line up with the Bible if it's true science ok so you have that now 31 yeah that's right so see we must be in the world but don't abuse the world don't let it become an abuse to you don't abuse your mind don't abuse your soul right don't abuse your body that's the wisdom of God all right now let's go to Sega Riggins 4:18 Sankranthi ins 4:18 you got that brother Aaron you want to read that for us sir oh no problem oh sorry I saw your Bible now guy you got it ok yeah I should let you know before I ask you a mint things that we see our temporary things that we don't see are eternal in verse 17 it says it really good too for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory amen it's just a moment if we're sick it's just gonna be for a moment if we're rejected it just gonna be for a moment if we're cast aside if we're mocked and made fun of it's just gonna be for a moment but that's working to us a weight of glory in other words weight a heavy lasting testimony in heaven amen I don't know yeah amen because Church there's not talking about physical weight it's not like well I'm gonna carry around like a bigger crown than everybody as heavier than everybody else it's a spiritual testimony it's a weight of glory it's a measure of a testimony and we want to have a testimony that pleases Jesus Christ your light affliction now down here produces a heavier testimony in heaven amen of course we know to be used on the day of judgment at the white throne where we'll stand up this person I couldn't I couldn't be a Christian like I couldn't pass her a small church and later to see ya but God may raise up Jesse Smith could you do it I could do it by God's grace right well I couldn't repent there was just too much football and sports going on but God will raise up Jesse Smith did you repent and did you reject football yet you did stand up your witness see so in every age we got to have witnesses and our lives now are laying up a weight of glory in heaven hallelujah now this is not our ultimate home because even though we experienced difficulty sorrow and rejection it's not the end of the story thank God for that in order to keep us from becoming too attached to earth God allows us to feel a significant amount of discontent and dissatisfaction in life praise God God does that Church on purpose God makes us feel discontentment and dissatisfaction I just can't get satisfied in this life I'm just so discontent in this life he does that on purpose so that will long for heaven so daddy now amen as much as we longed you know as much as we long for peace here we'll never find it so that makes us long for peace over there amen in that great heavenly country praise God we're not completely happy here because we're not supposed to be happy here praise God let me show this video here I don't know if let me pull it up real quick I don't know how the volume will do here so bear with me this is a preacher he's a kind of like a holiness preacher in some ways how many ever heard of francis CH and this is a really beautiful illustration now think about what we've been saying here life is just a really short temporary assignment right and he gives this nice illustration I want you to see it it's got 1 million views but he takes this rope and I wanted to do it here but I just never thought about buying a rope I should ask somebody buy me or hope he has this rope that stretches all across the pulpit and he colored just a little end of it red and he compared that here look that's your life that red part of the Rope is your life and the rest of it is all eternity now look what he says it's really nice illustration I hope you like it here I hope the sound works here I can't think of a better way to to explain it I actually didn't use a rope back then I used a remember remember computer paper when it was all stuck together and they had the holes on the side the TFG long I remember that but I remember being a youth passion I put that computer paper all the way around the room and but I'm gonna use a rope now because I can't find that computer paper a bunch of this rope can pretend this rope just goes on forever ok just imagination pretend it goes around the world few times it doesn't it ends at the rock but let's just imagine this thing goes on forever now imagine that this rope is a time of your existence he just exists forever he sees right can we see that red there it's just red on the end you've got a few short years here on earth and then you've got all of eternity somewhere else that's course this is your existence now of course we don't believe people burn for eternity right but he may believe that but we don't believe that they may burn bro barrister they may burn for millions and millions and billions of years but at one point they're gonna eventually be annihilated so I just want to say I don't agree with everything on here I want you to see how he takes it though he really focuses on this red part don't live your life for the red part live your life for eternity amen oh man I can't wait to hear you know I'm gonna work hard imma save Solaris is that what people do I'm gonna save up for my retirement and they're just living for that last little red strip on that on that that red part I want to work 40 years then I can finally live the good life what a shame what about all the stuff it's is this crazy me because because the Bible teaches that what I do during this little red part deep Germans how I'm gonna exist for millions and millions and millions of years forever and and so why would I spend this little red part try to make myself as comfortable as possible enjoying myself as much as I can Paul says look I'm gonna live my life for this mission I'm gonna spend my life invest my life for this moment when I cross that finish line see I'm gonna forget about all this stuff I could enjoy it I'm not gonna look around I'm gonna be like a runner just looking at that moment when I face God because when I face him but I don't get this chance over again we get one chance at this life on earth then I ended any second for any of us we got one chance at this and then comes eternity I'm not gonna spend my life down here some people look at some of my decisions oh you're so stupid because that's gonna really affect this I don't know you're stupid cuz it's gonna affect all it is yeah I don't believe a name call so crazy you are so crazy yes you're gonna do that right now just to enjoy right now not even knowing if you have tomorrow and you think that's smart and that I'm dumb it doesn't make any sense Paul goes I'm not gonna look around at all this stuff and it's tempting it's tempting to all of it that's what I'm saying down here it's crazy because everyone lives that way everyone lives for the red part no one's thinking about the millions of years afterwards it's is this the crazy deception that we can't get out of our minds and Paul goes I'm not doing that you're gonna keep my eyes on that I keep my eyes on that finish line and I'm gonna forget way man yeah I'm straining because I'm straining forward I'm like stretching forward for that mark I'm gonna pass this thing I'm gonna live this out and I'm gonna face him I'm gonna come before the judges and he's gonna hand me that trophy he was I'm gonna get it I haven't gotten there yet he was probably better believe I'm using every muscle exerting every bit about me because I'm gonna pass that line well a menu like that that's beautiful maybe one of these weeks I'll finally buy one of those ropes and I'll preach it on a Sunday think about that church we just got this little red part and we should not now it's okay to have a retirement don't don't get me wrong it's okay to have a retirement but we shouldn't live and say oh boy my life's gonna be good when I finally retire and when and then I'll be able to eat better foods and all these things worrying about little things like that when we have all the rest of eternity if your life's like that and broadband should we get a thousand years with each person think how long your fellowship is with a with one person the thousand years you have more time with one person if you just live right now for Jesus Christ and make sacrifices and put God first I thought you'd really like that did you like that that's just a good a good visual of that now I want to start looking at Bram's life but I just want to read a couple more things the author goes on to say it's a fatal mistake to assume that God's goal for your life is material prosperity or popular success as the world defines it the abundant life has nothing to do with material abundance and faithfulness to God does not guarantee success in a career or even in ministry never focus on temporary crowns amen so if you serve Jesus Christ well that doesn't guarantee you're going to be the best worker at your job or them at the highest office or I'm gonna be the most popular preacher it doesn't mean that at all in fact it's usually the opposite and he uses some examples Paul was faithful and he labored more than everyone else but where'd he end up prison John the Baptist was faithful he leveled out those mountains and he raised up the valleys so it's just like he took like a piece he just took a tool like a rake and he raked down all those mountains and he just filled up the valleys with him that's where John the Baptist didn't where did he end up in prison with his head cut off see millions of people have been faithful and yet have been martyred and lost everything and have come to the end of the life with nothing to show for it but the end of life is not the end amen like that in God's eyes the greatest heroes of faith are not those who achieve prosperity success and power in this life but those who treat this life as a temporary assignment and serve faithfully expecting the promised reward in eternity praise God amen now let's look at bit of suffering in brother branham's life and I'll bring it down to close here I may give me about twenty or fifty minutes I'll do 15 minutes here more now so see how I was preaching a few weeks ago and all of a sudden this thought came look how brother branham was persecuted does anyone remember when I preached it I said we've all got to suffer persecution right and in the days of Jesus and Paul it was the lion anointing right and so there the lion hunting and then the Beast anointing came after that and they willingly gave their lives martyrs you know 68 million right we know brother Graham gives us that number from foxes Book of Martyrs or gosh Smuckers glorious Reformation rather but brother Branham and us we're we're not living in that age we're not living at a time where people are gonna hang us just because we're a Christian or shoot us just because we believe the message at least not yet you don't know what what it will happen we don't believe it will go in the tribulation but there the Bible said there and so there will be a period to squeeze the temptation of trial so I just had that thought what about brother Branham how did he suffer in life and so I want to bring out some of these and I found a quote this week I heard listen to the sermon twice brother Graham said he never suffered more than the end of his life and it wasn't the stomach trouble that was a great suffering but that wasn't the real suffering so let me move to that so in 1955 here's some of the suffering brother Branham had to do when he first found the Pentecostal groups and they were speaking in tongues and interpreting and casting out Devils and they were the oneness Pentecostals that baptized in Jesus Christ Nate he had to suffer a little bit because I heard he said the longer I stood here the better I felt what's with the Pentecostals he said that seems pretty good I thought there ain't nothing wrong with them people they ain't crazy I got to talking to some of them they were fine people I said well now that's the same meaning that I went out and stayed all night that night and the next day I went in and you've heard me tell that my life story I was on the platform with 150 or 200 other ministers maybe more and they wanted everybody just raise up and say their name and I said evangelist William Branham Jeffersonville and set down Baptist and so for sit down each one tell where they were from so the next morning when I got in there I slept in the field all night that night have you ever had to sleep in a field to attend a church service have you sister Beatrice ever had to sleep in a field okay I never have I to know I don't know what your country's like I did there I never had to sew but brother branham suffered by having to sleep in a field and in order get the wrinkles out he pressed his trousers between the two seats can you imagine taking your pants sisters your skirts and pull sticking them into the seats and then on the other side pulling them out to try to get the wrinkles out of them just so you don't look all wrinkly when you go to church I just dropped mine off I just I said okay I got five shirts I got five pairs of pants I'll see you in two days I can pick them up and they're all pressed perfectly now brother branham not in the 30s you know an old seersucker trousers a little t-shirt you know I get to wear a tie and I got a nice long shirt with a collar he had to wear a t-shirt when he first started preaching a t-shirt I think Haven has a t-shirt underneath her dress right David no looks like one sorry so the next morning I went through the meeting a little t-shirt on now I've got a t-shirt under nests but I'm not gonna take off the shirt that's how I went to church the prophet of God with a t-shirt on trousers have been pressed through his ford seats the night before and look what he ate for dinner Church I didn't have about three dollars and I had to enough gasoline to get home and I got me some rolls so I saw brother Aaron brought some rolls that kind of old you know but I was all right and I got to a hydrant can you believe this a fire hydrant and I got me a glass of water you know and they were pretty good can you imagine when up to fire hydrant out there I don't know what tool he would have used what kind of wrenched and got a little water out and close it up and now he's got rolls and he's got water and the so I soaked them up a little bit and had breakfast can you imagine dipping those rolls tonight and that's your that's your that's your supper you don't have anything at home or you're gonna go sleep out in the field tonight ooh soggy soggy rolls first dinner delicious now I could eat with them now they eat twice a day they only ate twice a day you get mad at or you and I may get mad if we don't eat three times or four times a day right think about that but this was not his greatest suffering of his life not even close so I wouldn't sponge on them I'm not sure what sponge me I wouldn't sponge on them I'm not sure what that means in 1960 program tells stories about flying on dangerous plane flights now listen to this I know some of you have flown on some big flights longer than I have I've never flown across the Atlantic like our sisters have but listen to mother brown describe his plane flight I don't preach the gospel because I think I'd go to hell if I didn't I preach the gospel because I love him hey hey man that's the same reason I preach it praise God I preach the gospel he says certainly you think I crossed those stormy seas and then planes diving back and forth and Lightning flashing around and everything else at most any minute and everybody's screaming have you ever been on a plane fly where everybody was screaming and Hail Marys are going through the plane so everybody seen and you got covers of the Hail Mary Mother of God well grace and truth and all these things but RAM so do you think I'd do that just for fun so I don't go to hell and everything and then people are swinging in them safety belts you know how the safety belts drop down or the suction cups he had safety belts he says safety belts are swinging around the plane get your belt on get your man out Mary Mother of grace got him the truth and all these things they say and program crossing the oceans planes diving shaking have you ever been on a plane that shakes like that when I flew from Boston to Maine or we just flew in those little planes and that's what I felt it was storm and lightning and the planes going like this and I'm thinking oh god have mercy I'm gonna die tonight but it's nothing like this then we were saying Hail Marys nobody was screaming and the pilot sank enough gas the last 15 minutes longer don't know where we're at no do you think I do that just for the fun of doing that is that fun no you get a pit in your stomach and you feel like this is the end and you're gonna die and what am i doing what have I done to myself where'd I miss God's call and this is what brother branham endured not because he was scared to go to hell but because he loved Christ so much this thorough still was not his worst suffering of his life you think I get back there in the jungles now look at this did I okay so here this quote and the next quote tell about the same thing where German soldiers had their put their arms around me like this each night and take me in and out of the meeting until the Holy Spirit began to perform miracles look at this church communist setting with night scopes to shoot me a mile away can you imagine that brother branham went to the pulpit knowing there's snipers out there a mile way that could shoot him now would you do that would you go to church service if you knew there were snipers the next door this is my brother Brandon Church we all need our faith raised don't we realize our life is not so hard after we battle out of mind battles but that's not too bad remember the Bible said this is a light affliction because it's just temporary it doesn't last forever it's just temporary you think I do that just for the fun of it he says because something in me love there's humans that Christ died for Paul said I'm not willing to go up to Jerusalem but I'm going up there to be crucified I'm going to die I'm going to go up there to die for the cause of the Lord it's something love constrains you that makes you that's exactly right here he gives another telling of it would you be willing to be a martyr for him with the sumerians if it come to this spot that you had to face death or take it back would you face it yes sir Oh God it would be a pleasure he says a pleasure to face death as a Christian yes sir that's the way I want to go riding the pulpit he says look at this that's right I thought I got it and gonna get me in Germany here not long ago oh there was going to shoot me through a night scope and German soldiers run all around me and held back like that they must have got in front of the pulpit to block them so brother Ram could preach I thought what a wonderful thing it would be to die for my lord right here on the field Mac and what a thought when he knows their snipers out there oh just be wonderful that if I died in the pulpit we might be saying oh it's awful can we can we go to a safer place to preach but this is what love constrained our prophet to do in 1961 in Chicago many you know this quote brother Branham was cornered trapped by 300 ministers about the serpentine doctrine and the water baptism he said I asked the other day in Chicago before 300 ministers that sit over there to debate me to ask me and the Lord told me gave me vision told me where we'd be at and what to do I stood before 300 Trinitarian ministers and I said now if I'm so wrong in this doctrine some of you men stand up here and show me where I'm wrong by the scriptures without a textbook he says if there's no such thing as a serpent seed or something like that that I've been teaching just come here show me by the scriptures nobody move because it can't be done hallelujah persecution suffering 300 people sitting there knowing they dislike everything you say they wish you would be quiet and not preach they don't agree with one thing that you say 300 against one now I'm gonna skip down to this there's about 50 or 75 of them said I'm coming down there to be rebaptised did they come not a one of them why he give them space to repent eat but he will cast their children to death spiritual death can you imagine 75 people saying brother Aaron I'm gonna be there I'm gonna go to your church I want you to bat I want you to get me baptized I'll be there 80 people shake your hand say yes I want to be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ and they never show up that's called major rejection right where that 70 people lying to your face say they want to be baptized but they're lying right to your face this the greatest he said the greatest suffering of his life now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna skip ahead and then come back to this how many numbers stomach job we had for seven years I'm sorry every 7 years rather I'm just gonna briefly go over this I want to spend my time my last few moments of the message on that other thought but madam said his stomach would get sour every 7 years he had a he had a vision and he saw he said he saw a squirrel a really ugly looking squirrel jump in his mouth and he says only the boy said it's only six inches long and brother branham kept saying he would pray and pray look at this I cried I begged I pleaded God for it to leave and never left at the end of his life he saw another vision of the squirrel dead and the squirrel he noticed how the squirrel was out there and in the in the desert but it wasn't in eating it fell on a cactus and it died and then he saw a dove he saw dove come and after the dove came the Holy Spirit said that this is over he said it was only six inches long he saw seventh of and seven represented complete healing amen and so program ends that sermon on the wings of a snow white dove singing and thanking God that he's never going to have the stomach trouble again he said God revealed to him he never have it again and only lived about you know three or four weeks after that before the Lord took him home so I'm gonna that but look look look at the suffering Oh God have mercy it's killing me he would have this sourness he just felt like he was gonna die and he told stories I think there's a story now to get a chance to get to it there's a story in there where brother Branham says he had the stomach trouble the sour stomach and he prayed for a man that had cancer on his face and the cancer fell off but he remains sick was with sour stomach ha can you imagine I cried I begged God heal me you just healed cancer can you heal my stomach and God was silent during that time but that still wasn't as intense suffering as the rejection he experienced having ever been rejected out there was ever never been rejected let her have said the rejection in Tucson was some of the hardest rejection of his entire life worse than eaten rolls for supper worse than fine in planes that you think they're gonna follow the sky worse than seeing snipers get ready to shoot you brother branham said in Tucson he suffered like he never suffered his entire life so this is from what house will you build me in Tucson 1965 now brother Simon and I guess preached a little bit this on Sunday morning he preached about Moses with the pillar of fire Paul and then brother branham so now remember sermon was not actually really a sermon a complete sermon brother branham was just saying a few words before brother Perry green preached that morning message and brother band before this program says there was many times he heard brother Perry green preach and was really blessed by his preaching you can listen to that if you'd like to and I says I find this one of the great moments of my visit to Tucson I come here because I was led to come here I come here because the Holy Spirit through a vision sent me here I know that might seem strange maybe but he as far as I know anything that I know of God I was sent my vision and to son I've wondered how I was ever sent to this desert place and then here where there is spiritually speaking I listen all over the city I don't know any place that's any more spiritually dead than the City of Tucson now what a spiritual death look like Church to brother Graham he's gonna tell us right here so this will tell us if we're spiritually dead or not but I'll give you a clue we're alive in Christ there's war between the churches do we have any war with any message churches here no we don't bars I know there is fusses between the congregations do we have any Foster's with any other churches nothing I'm aware of there is no unity and everyone grabbing and holding and squeezing and trying to get this one and proselyting am i trying to pop proselyte people from other churches I'm not it is a desert spiritually speaking also hope that encourages you tonight by God's grace if we have unity here we're not fussing with the churches in Sheffield or Albion or Lorraine and if we're not trying to proselyte say oh you gotta come to my church you should leave your church come on church now it's good if you're saying that to Catholic or a Presbyterian or Luther right trying to point them to the truth of God but brother him says this is a dead church he said a dead church is when you're warring with other churches you're proselytizing you fusses between congregations he said that's spiritually dead but then I read in the Bible where God called Moses away from the loved ones it all was dear to him and sent him in the wilderness to write the laws of the Bible then I find that in the book of the New Testament where Paul which is the author or not the author but the ride of the New Testament he also has drove out from among his people and by the sphere into Arabia where he was three and 1/2 years to find the inspiration and pause the chief writer of the New Testament Simon Reid that on Sunday by a chance didn't remember Simon reading that quote okay and now if the Old Testament had to be drove from if the rider had to be drove from his people in the wilderness to get inspiration to write the Old Testament and the New Testament the rider was drove by the author into the desert to get the inspiration to read the New Testament and the books are sealed with seven seals ha ha ha it would also require the same I believe in these days to open the seven CEOs ha ha if God had a job moves this out to get inspiration and then got into drive Paul out to get inspiration and the book see was seven seals God without the drive brother brought him out to give him inspiration to loose and break all those seven seals amen hallelujah beautiful now look look what he look what he had to go through a church look he had to leave what you hold dear to what you cherish and a little home that was given me by the people remember remember uh there was a meeting where the people paid for programs house you guys remember that brother branham's autobiography remember that do you remember that Lydia one of that one of the campaigns took up a love offering and paid for a house for his family that's on tape because they were they they heard about how he's living in an awful house and they didn't know what brother ham said give it back and they said how are we gonna give it back it's all cash we don't know who gave what so both my brother and actually accepted that money and had a house built so it was already paid for he left the little hole that was given me the people and amongst all my people and friends and a church that was flourishing had nothing lacking so that's what he calls a flourishing Church you have anything lacking and to leave that Pope away from it and move away out into desert where you knew nobody and everything against you so now you're starting to see why his life was the hardest at the end harder than eaten soaked rolls water soaked rolls the hardest part of his life was living in a spiritual desert where all the churches are fussing against each other people are prophet isin there's no unity and you don't know anybody so you feel all alone and everybody's against you well as long as God's with you you could handle it Amen and if anybody was with brother brand it was God here's where he says it but there's something about God that he drives a man number I preach on that at the beginning this series God drives you to your purpose then your purpose drives you amen look at my friend said God drives a man to do things that's beyond any thinking of his own so it can be to the glory and honor of God God drove me to be a pastor I never thought I'd really be a pastor preacher when I came to the message that's when I realized I need to be up there preaching but before that I had no idea I'd be a pastor started church I start a church and preach a hundred some times a year I would do that I never thought I'd do that but God drives a man to do something and I feel that and I look not self honor but man's not bragging but I feel was a privilege that it was to leave everything that was called dear to me to get here in this waters and suffer like I have what never suffered in my life here in the wilderness praise God sleeve being in a field eating water-soaked rolls was not as bad as suffering as living amongst bittering bickering christians and the church said now you know about church splits right sister Beatrice you've seen surface I've seen some Church myths not here we've never had a church but thank God but I've talked to brothers the message that go through church splits it rips their hearts apart it totally tears it causes some people even to lose the faith it rips people apart because a church represents love it represents family and when there's fighting and what's supposed to be a loving family it tears people apart roots of bitterness are planted and all the thorns grow up and they choke the life of God in the churches is that right program said I have never suffered like this in my life let that soak in just for a moment but I believe that in doing that and obeying what God command to be done God has opened to us the mysteries of the last day oh thank you lord without that there'd be no marriage in divorce revelation amen holiday right there beating on those other great messages that came after brother man moved out west in January of 63 there never would have been the seven seals right there never would have been the token then it would have been the masterpiece there never been any of those other messages had not God drove there not from his flourishing church his home everything he loved and caused him to go in the wilderness so God could reveal himself to him oh thank you lord hallelujah thank you Jesus then I wonder why I got to be away from all my family all my five siblings and my mom and dad are all on the other side of the state and I've got to be all out here all by myself sometimes I wonder why I got to do that well God's got to do a certain thing in Akron Ohio praise God and he called me out here and I just leave everything I loved in order to do what God's called me to do preach just be a pastor feed God's sheep praise the Lord no he skips out a little bit and I look what he says and now they need a Sunday School teachers talk about Perry greens church they're going to need a staff and I want to say this to you thoroughly understand this is my church now the Jeffersonville people never admit this but brother man said now that Perry green started a message church he said this is my church now I don't know if I that many people say that how come people don't give that quote out to people but man said I don't have to travel back to Jeffersonville to make a tape anymore I can preach it right here he said because Peregrine is my associate and he said Peregrine believes the same message the same way I do amen Jeffersonville is not his church anymore according this quote because he didn't live there anymore now he lived in Tucson and his wife would visit would go attend brother Perry greens church when he was out of town that's what he says on this tape see how important your home churches brother branham and bromium in this tape says the only thing that bothered him about the Holy Spirit driving him out west was there was no home Church there he says on this tape he said but he's almost crying said but thank God that brother Perry followed the leadership of the Holy Spirit and he opened up a church he says of like precious faith hallelujah sometimes we forget how important it is or how how much of a blessing it is that we have a home church that's right that's the only thing that bothered brother brother Brandon brother Aaron was there was no home Church where they were had a message Church and a live preacher is that right Lydia as you listen to this tape it's only it's only 27 minutes long you can listen to it on the drive home we could too but usually we do the the videos for them this sort the Bible stories for the kids obviously that's like three times last week or this weekend just over and over to hear how brother branham's so ports the home church so much and live preaching now look at this this is another part of his suffering I've been here three years and I've only had one door open to me one door one invitation to preach and Tucson this is my home now I've only got one person invited me to preach in three years he says I've never suffered like this in my life that was brother Mac asked me to come by and preach god bless him I haven't been invited by any other people not nothing against them there all right brother Broc a good friend of my brother Gilmore ladies Pentecostal brother in here are very very good friends of mine I love them nothing against them I understand their position they can't invite me in there and remain there organization see they can't do it because if they do they're kicked out so you see their position I have the same thing to my face but may my may it always be seek ye first the kingdom of God the will of God amen I'm so glad nobody can kick me out of this trip praise God amen you all can vote me out but no organization can kick me out because we're not tied to man we're tied to Christ amen hallelujah and that's what we're looking for I need a church in Arizona that where it believes the same message where I can preach where I have open doors he said thank God for a man like Perry green and what did that what a pair of greens Church dude you know out of that church spraying all these other wonderful loving message churches so before it was spiritually dead before the prophet got there but after the prophet got there preached and let the seed and then the the fruits of his of his preaching started growing and produce a lot of good things Haim ahead it went from spiritually dead to spiritually alive Amen hallelujah hey man thank you Lord that's beautiful and now the green God has sent him here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe in we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service take every place that we can for us to pray to seek let's do business be soldiers just be anxious to do it let's send our feet here I got one more thing I want to say we've got to be careful how people use quotes with with persecution I just want to balance this go this was on Facebook I think a few days ago see people are quoting brother Branham remember if you follow Christ you're hated by people for all that live godly in christ jesus o selfish of for persecutions i just want to bounce this quote out because brother Branham was hated by some people but not by everybody I just want to balance this out here's the actual remember you follow Christ if you hated by people for all the little in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution if you come to Christ you'll not come by any church or any denomination or any Creed you'll come by the blood I'm gonna skip ahead look if we look what brother Han said the fifth seal did you know this progressive some of the best friends that I know of our message believers know no doubt that's true some of the best friends I know of are Catholics did you know he said that do you realize now Burnham tells his story they would not have the bram Tabernacle bill unless a Catholic man went into the the Jeffersonville government and sit up for brother Bram and said give them a loan that's what he tells right here a Roman Catholic stood to his feet in the court and went in front for me boy like nobody would do they couldn't turn it down that's right so because of a Catholic man the brand Tabernacle was built I wonder if that man has a reward in heaven or if God's gonna say no you're Catholic you're going to go to hell automatically no I don't think so he was one of the good he stood up for brother branham he stood up for a believer in a time of persecution just like gamellia did just like Nicodemus did they set up for somebody who was so unpopular but so right with God in heaven now you keep on the story the man said all that church I know the pastor that Church has been there the rest you can add it why can't they Roman Catholic good friend of mine see I want to balance that quote out some people use that quote saying oh you're gonna be hated you are gonna be hated by some people but a lot of people they're gonna feel your love and you're gonna be able to love them and they're gonna be able to be your good friends brother Jesse you can't have a good friend that's a Catholic why not brother branham did as long as I don't partake of their Hail Marys why can't I have a friend that's a Catholic but look what he says this boy's a Catholic a real loyal friend of mine was talking to me he was certain heart he had a certain hardware store before I left and said Billy I know you don't believe in our system of religion he said but I'm telling you right now God has honored your prayers so much for us I believe if you get in trouble anywhere in this nation every Catholic in the country would come to you now what a good testimony that is his testimony wasn't I hate you you're Catholic I hate you it wasn't that his testimony was can I pray for you could I ask God to be merciful to you now look what he says Catholic or Jew or whatever it is there are human off the same tree that we come from brother Branham says there are people who love and eat and drink and sleep and just like anybody else so he must never condemn them in jus individuals no we mustn't condemn them but as a minister I have to strike that surfer that's out there just to myself I wouldn't do it if it wasn't a commission from God that I'm duty-bound to do it I must hold that true and faithful it's the last one yeah that's the last one but a Catholic or do whatever he was even if he was a Muslim Greek Orthodox whatever he'd be if he come here to be prayed for I would just pray uh sincerely for him as I would for my own that's right certainly because why program it's a human being I pray for Buddhists Sikhs Jains mohammedans every kind you see like that I don't ask them no questions I just pray for them because there's somebody a human being that wants to get well and try to make life a little easier along the road for them the church says hey man Malik I want to come to the piano here how do you like that message is that okay the way to end that he said I never suffered in my life like the end of my life because of rejection so I wanted you to see all these things he suffered but none of them were as hard a suffering as a spiritual oppression rejected wars in the church no unity nobody invites me no no friends I don't know anybody everybody's against me there was no suffering like that suffering now how many other says all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution well then that this thing this is the example a brother branham suffering persecution then you can switch over to the songs I hope that helps somebody tonight because it really helped me when I heard him say that I was like what did I just hear that I hear that right I'd agree I said Siri rewind one minute let me hear that again I've never suffered like this in all my life thank goodness that's just our heads for a moment and think about the suffering we go through and help us let's pray and ask God to help us remember it's just temporary whatever suffering we go through it won't always last it's so small in that red line of the rope right in such a small little section but we can just be faithful that that small red section the rest of eternity awaits us of a glorious promise an eternal weight of glory he's God Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight we thank you for your word that we've read Lord I'm just a pilgrim the Saints here we're just sojourners strangers [Music] the world system is not our home paying taxes all these government regulations this part of the world is not our home we're a part of a heavenly kingdom and we're thankful for that Lord God and lord thank you lord for this inspiration I was so inspired to hear your prophets say that and he never suffered his life like this kind of suffering Lord and I could relate to it Lord God I feel like I've been away from my family and to leave everything that was dear to me had to come out of here where I don't have any clothes churches really for fellowship I've nobody in Akron support me other churches but I'm sure many times we feel alone dear God and father just because of where we are Lord God just like you pray place your prophet but Lord tonight I pray for this Lord just as the prophet got to know you better and open the seals because of his rejection I pray Lord you would open up closer walk with God for us Lord hears we're separated Lord God call it out for that great name Lord God I pray you'd help us Lord God and encourage us by opening up more revelation to us no doubt Lord your book sea turtle no doubt we need more spiritual food each and every day I pray Lord God in our condition that we're in Lord God not having a lot of fellowship around us being very small not have a lot of support I pray Lord God that in the midst of this situation Lord God we could have such sweet fellowship with you durability Alleluia Jesus that's my prayer Lord God Lord I feel like I personally I can just relate so much to brother right about this I hope it meant a lot to your people because it's trim it a lot to be good as your prophets said Lord many times you drive a man to do something he normally wouldn't do it seems so far from what others might expect but yet it's God's Way it's God's will Lord bless your people tonight Lord to serve you Lord as a temporary assignment lord help us to remember this world is not our home this world system help us to live Lord for the Father's business Lord there's me about your business dear God remember that we're ambassador sent here from heaven to represent heaven and show this world it show this generation what a real crook named Lord while we're down here help us to be like brother branham and have friends Lord from maybe different religions and we can tell them on how we differ with them but yet then pray for them and show them common decency the friendship like your profit sharing is deer meat I can profit praying for Muslims if they might have a better life thank you Lord for your word Lord God bless us now father we worship you may we know that you're with us in the midst of the tribe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God thank

esis versus we have four Lord you're more precious in silver he pulled up I thought there was four he just pulled up there I seen that Lord you are more precious and silver porking we'll just go into

beautiful than silver amen he's God and that's why prophet will be willing to leave everything he loved to go out a desert to hear the say at the Lord oh god help us may God help us to leave anything leave anything behind in order to do God's perfect will may we be so submissive that we can let God drive us to do His perfect will praise the Lord let's bow our heads for where the prayers were dismissed hear Heavenly Father this words of the song are so true it's your love that's within us it's your love that's growing we're growing as a Christian and we wouldn't be fully conformed to be like your son Jesus we don't just want to be a Sunday or Wednesday Christian we want to be an everyday Christian hallelujah nor we want to understand our what a persecution and trial means for today and thank you for helping us tonight Lord God to see that sometimes rejection and sometimes being alone as some of the hardest trials we'll ever face in this life but more were comforted to know that as you were with Moses so you be with Joshua as you were with your prophet so shall you be with your bride dear come the Lord many of these trials are here Lord to drive us closer to You Lord God thank you lord thank you Lord that you won't let us get comfortable here on this earth you won't let us for it with the things in the world but God you keep drawing us back Lord correcting us as a father does his sense these trials will push us from drive us closer to you Lord may it be as you told your prophet may you be our portion or God we never see Lord retirement as our portion and we never see fancy dieting or fit worldwide travel as our portion may we see eternal life as our portion we're headed Lord God we all work to retire we all want to eventually do more for you but let Lord the comforts of those times not be what we're living for but maybe the freedom of those times to do more for the kingdom of God the Lord now our while we are where we are how much the work for you help us to find our purpose and do something for you Lord God that not one day is wasted that we can redeem the time because the days are evil dear God that we might invest our one talent or two or five talents and bear much fruit that our Lord would say well done good and faithful servant you've been faithful a little a little I'll make your rule over munch let us serve your purpose bless your people tonight as they travel as we fellowship in Jesus Christ to the church say Amen god bless you church gold for your definition of the Lord or without some time to fellowship [Music]
