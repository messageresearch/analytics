========================================

the Holy Spirit praise God enjoy these those series here I'm trying to get through the Romans one and this acts one looking at all these examples here and for me you know I feel allowed to do this you know we looked at U you know the Deeds of nians on Sunday I don't see any false doctrines in our church you know so I feel like uh we are trying our best as brother R said to be the book of Acts Church um and as we go through the book of Acts to me it gives us peace giv me calm it gives me Comfort it gives me courage we can see a lot of these same things they're going through we go through a lot of the same testimonies they had we can see we have those testimonies as well so it's a great refresher to go through this and see the gifts of the holy spirit working uh through uh the Saints in the book of Acts church and we want to see uh that the same thing work in our lives how many want to see it more praise God that's that's a main thing that we see you know main thing I preach we want to see more of it we're grateful what we have seen we want to see God continue to move Among Us we know he will but there's also the human ele element where we must Draw N to God and God will draw a n to us praise God I'm going to set timer for an hour here by the grace of the Lord just to kind of give me a measure of how we're going here acts 5:12 try to finish 5 this morning here by the grace of Hallelujah so I'll read 12 down to 16 but we'll just save our voices from verse 16 so then I'll read 12 through 15 myself and then we can all read 16 together the Bible says and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and miracles wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch Solomon's porch was that area in the outer Court where anyone could go Jew and Gentile that's where Jesus often taught he would sit there on the porch and he would teach the people the words of God remember when he was arrested and he said wasn't I always in the temple sitting on Solomon's porch teaching you every day you come out against me as like a thief with staves right but he was constantly there so we see the Saints doing the same thing Jesus did Jesus would sit amongst the people and teach the people the word of God verse 13 and of the rest of no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them so there was a great reverence around them right as we saw when ananas and SAA died we saw that no one would join themselves to the church God had to be guiding them in there was such a reverence there was such a love there was such a respect for God verse 14 and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women and God kept bringing in people in at the right time verse 15 in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them let's read verse 16 together ready one two three there came also a multitude out of the Cities round unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone may God has blessing to reo's word you may be seated God bless you so we're grateful uh for today Hallelujah be the house of the Lord and just looking at that scripture again you know I was reminded you know how the Lord has allowed me to see casting out Devils a number of times um and I'm grateful for that I'm aware that the same God is here today Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said in my name they shall cast out Devils praise God and so I believe God has given us a witness here in this hour in our generation that the book of Acts is continuing remember brother brandom said uh the true church will always try to be as much like the book of Acts as possible talk that in the church age book Hallelujah and so that's what we see in our life our church here we're trying to be like the book of Acts as close as possible you know one testimony I don't know if I've ever shared with you but verse 15 says the shadow of Peter would strike people and they'd be well that there was a testimony a brother Perry green gave do you remember that brother Jose Perry green would go over overseas and and people would try to get in his shadow and people would be made well even as his shadow that's how much reverence there was for brother bram's Ministry that was probably in the 80s or uh maybe 70s brother Perry green even saw that in his ministry uh where people would be so uh inspired by Brother R's Ministry that they would they'd follow the man after brother brandom and they would see the same signs wonders and miracles so it's a wonderful testimony God is the same yesterday today and forever praise God hallelujah so those are just a few testimonies we see uh there now I would like to um just briefly if you got your Bible let's read a few verses I got a few uh emails about you know prayer meetings uh and I've appreciated those and I'll just want to show you the scriptures that uh I'd like to share with them let's go to acts 27:20 so I believe you know uh if there's a desire uh if people want to pray more that's wonderful um and I I feel like if we can start praying more as a church when we have services and if there's still a great hunger for prayer then we can call extra prayer meetings as well that's what you would see the church do the church in the book of Acts you there wouldd be times and Seasons where they'd have extra prayer meetings there would be times and Seasons where they would do remember they would pray when when someone got in jail remember they would have like a prayer chain right like when Peter got in jail and so people you know are feeling led to pray more well then we want to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit and this is what I've said over the years you know with Exodus uh 27:20 um anybody got that can read that real quick anybody got that there you got that anybody you get there I actually didn't turn to I was talking Exodus 27:20 then I'll get John 1213 so car whenever ready Exodus 2720 I'll get John 1213 amen praise God now we look at this verse and we see uh Israel the Old Testament couldn't have service they couldn't have their daily service unless the people brought the oil as well and so I use this verse to show each one of us must bring the Holy Spirit we must bring uh a faith right we must bring a a revelation and we looked at it on Wednesday night every one of you have a PSAL so there's some Services you want to bring a song to church praise God there's some Services you might want to bring a doctorine to church like sister be just read 1 Thessalonians 4 The Rapture scripture on Wednesday right and we shared that on Wednesday night that was a a Doctrine she want to share just reminding us of the doctrine of the word of God but this is true for everybody this is for me true as a pastor my family we all got to bring the leadership of the Holy Spirit I typed it out when I preached the um when I preached that series on uh the Waters of Separation I typed it out as you know we won't have light in the Holy place or sanctification we won't have a great sanctification unless everybody brings the anointing of God if everybody lives a Sanctified life you know we'll get sprinkled by the holy spirit for repentance we'll come to the outer Court we'll enjoy the sacrifice of Jesus Christ right at the Brazen altar We'll Wash in the labor the washing of Water by the word right that's the outer core justification that's also represents water baptism but then we come into the holiest so when we need a real sanctification when and God wants his church Sanctified praise God the people bring the oil and then the oil lights up the manora praise God in other words the light of all seven Church ages is shining in our lives in other words we can see our lives in the Bible we can see how our church is a part of the book of Acts Church praise God Amen but each person's got to bring their oil each person has to bring an anointing of the Holy Spirit I feel led to do this I feel led to do this I feel led to pray for that person I feel led to sing this song uh this verse is really blessing me I want to share it with somebody so each person brings some type of anointing a leadership one of those channels and since I'm there I'm going to go and read the one we read brother R uses this in the church age book and it's applicable 1 Corinthians 1426 because like we said we are not under the Antichrist Spirit we're under the spirit of God so the Antichrist spirit will come in like a wolf right the Antichrist spirit will come in to divide the church to separate brothers from brothers and friendships from friendships that's how the Antichrist comes Spirit comes in and we don't want to bring that Spirit to church we want to bring the oil to church praise God so that's John 14:26 so this is how you bring oil Paul says how is then Brethren when you come together everyone everyone you have the song which is a song everyone has a Doctrine like be just had that Rapture Doctrine on their heart everyone have a tongue see if you have the gift of tongues everyone has a revelation a revelation is the the revealing of the will of God right it's a substance of things hoped for some someone might have a a fresh Revelation and half an interpretation of an known tongue let all things be done under edifying so we see if we bring in the anointing we're going to want to edify the people of God you'll especially see when a preacher brings the wrong anointing he'll want to tear the people down but a preacher under the anointing of God will want to build them up praise God Amen so if I brought the oil I'm here to build you up today praise God hallelujah yes we must repent of our sins preachers must rebuke sin and by God's grace when we're mature we can feel the rebuke of the holy spirit in our own lives praise God then we can confess confess our sins make everything right bring the oil have some type of anointing have some type of leadership today Hallelujah and be led by the Holy Spirit to speak to somebody by God's grace amen all right now John 12 so I use that and brother Ram says uh in the the breach message brother Ram says that a church should pray before service right and so I've said you know I invite you to church half an hour beforehand or you can pray at home whichever one but the thing to do is pray for the service R said if a preacher is not praying before service he gets all confused during service every's going to be watching me make sure I'm not confused today right because I did pray before service Austin was here we prayed as a family Hallelujah but brother brother said you got to sit in the quietness of the Holy Spirit and then you gather into worship with the Saints hope I'll get to that quote eventually here maybe Wednesday night by God's grace all right so this verse here John 12113 uh took the branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried Hosanna blessed is he that blessed is the king that cometh Sor the king of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord so this is Jesus riding on the cat the foul of an ass but notice and this is I just I drawn a tip from here if we bring out the Palms which I just I know we're talking about plants but here I'm talking about our our palms of our worship if we lay down our palms or if we pray if we humble ourselves before God then the king of glory will ride in amen hallelujah how many believe that am if you bring worship if you come here to love God if you come to pour out your praises the king of glory is going to slide through here praise God am he's going to come through here like a wind of the Holy Spirit like a rushing Mighty Wind but in both cases see you got to bring oil in this in this case here the second case you got to bring Palms you got to bring worship that's why I always say I bring my Palms here I I lay down at the altar and let the king of glory ride in Hallelujah that Jesus's will be accomplished in our lives Hallelujah now the third one one was um Joshua 6 ver7 so You' got your Bible birthday girl you want to read that birthday Joshua 67 he people amen praise God so this is of course when the walls of Jericho came down now brother Randon gets the order of our services from the scripture okay um it was singers you know in this we have singers then the ark and then the armies but what I found when I read it there before the singers was also armed men so armed men if you're armed you've got the word of God brother R said I got the sword of the king it's the sword that I live by anybody live by that sword when the enemy comes in like a flood what do you get out your sword praise God Amen you fight the enemy off you live by it but also the full armor of God in Ephesians 6 if you got all six pieces of armor five defensive six off I'm sorry one offensive what does the Bible say you're praying always with all prayer and spiritual supplication amen amen so when you're walking on the anointing you're constantly praying remember the Bible said pray without ceasing how many try to do that this week just talk to the Lord I try to talk to the Lord when I'm at work and talk to the Lord as I'm driving about my errands just talk to the Lord pray without ceasing tell the Lord you must tell Jesus all your troubles praise God tell Jesus all your trials Hallelujah he'll help you praise God so this is the third one here now um so there's three examples we got bringing oil laying down the palms and then before the walls fall you got armed men worshippers trumpets which represents the singing and then you have the Ark of the Covenant is that landscaper out there is that what keep noises I keep hearing would you go check just to be sure I've heard a couple things that just it's good to know he usually usually comes on Saturday I wish didn't come on Sunday um verse eight and it came to pass when Joshua had spoken on the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord F them so see there we see trumpets first and then word Ark it represents the word the anointed word hallelujah remember the armed Men passed on before the ark so we have armed soldiers we got soldiers and how many know we need some prayer warriors praise God Amen how many how many are a prayer Warrior by by Grace by grace so see the armed men go first the prayer warriors then you got the music the trumpeters then you got the word of God hallelujah amen it's a beautiful it's a beautiful uh testimony and remember like getting back to the oil you can't have oil and unless you beat out the oil you stomp on the olives right it's a lot of stomping right it's it's a lot of work you got to you got to labor to produce this oil is he out there okay just curious our friends out there so see there's there's always there there's spiritual ual uh effort that must be put forth I I don't like to use the word work but the Bible said we have good works and we're not earning the anointing of the Holy Spirit but we're making ready for it we've got to prepare for the anointing of the Holy Spirit if we want more of God if we want to see more of God we got to put more into God Amen right because we're either putting things into the world or our life or just Christian Liberties we're putting things into that but if we want more of God spiritually we got to put more effort into it spiritually Paul calls it diligence praise God Amen put more diligence be more Earnest in the things of God whatever we put into God that's what we'll get out whatever you put in the service that's what you'll get out amen hallelujah exactly right okay now verse n is where I want to get to and the armed men went before the priests see that that blew with the trumpets so brother R gave us trumpets and and and Ark but see before that we got armed men we got soldiers ready to fight we've got saints that got the sword of the spirit in their hand Hallelujah let's not lay down our swords let's have our swords ready to fight am because this is how the army of God marched on praise God now to me as brother R said this is more information about the same Revelation it's the same Revelation before the word you got to have worship but the further re the further information shows us we got to have armed soldiers going before we have to have people that are anointed with the holy spirit with the armor of God on praise God I don't have much voice here didn't realize must have sang it all out during the song service so I apologize but everybody can can see that by God's grace you have armed soldiers trumpet music and then you got the word of God that's the order that it goes through praise God now the last one acts 131 now we'll get to this eventually but I just thought it was a fourth example in the mouth of two or what two or three Witnesses I'm going to give you four of course there's way more than that two or three Witnesses let every word be established Acts 131 I think it's a wonderful thing when we want to have more prayer I think uh first let's pray more when we're together if we can do that if we can have that everybody in One Accord then we'll have extra services but of course as I told people too if you want to come pray on your own I'll get you a key to the church you can pray as much as you want to pray uh one thing we want we want you to pray by God's grace numerous times when we were going to Lima and we didn't have this church here I would uh go to Lima to pray on Saturdays before preaching on Sundays my brother Brooks was out and I'd preach for him I would go Saturday I'd pray up Saturday before the service that's just one thing I always like to get alone with God I would just say brother can you let me into the church and brother Mike would let me into the church I just go in there all by myself those were some sweet times Hallelujah now it makes it a little harder on my wife but you know that's that's her uh that's her responsibility with the children there but each one of us should desire to have times with the Lord now acts 13:1 now this is right before they started their missionary work and they needed God's leadership Hallelujah so here's what you do when you want God's leadership I was reminded today how brother Randon would get many many invitations I would I would say maybe say let's say a 100 invitations a year think about that think about if people invited you to a 100 different services this year which ones would you go to right that's a lot of a lot of invitations I hardly get any invitations so it's very easy but brother there's quotes and I couldn't find them I didn't have time to find them but brother lay all the imitations all the letters on the table in front of the church it would be the uh communion table and they would pray and say God as we start this next year let's you know as we're coming to 224 but before you would start 1963 say Lord you know all these requests guide us onto which ones we go to and he said I have no leading I said I just got to pray and see which ones God might have me to go to and the point of it is church there's some things God lets us work out on our own right God wants to see what you're going to do about it right there's some things that you know God doesn't tell us remember the angel Lord Brother was so discouraged he would only pray for like five or seven people a night and all robbers would pay pray for 500 in one service and the people started putting that brother Ram's ear and he's like Lord what should I do and finally the angel Lord came to him and he asked the angel Lord which way do I do it and you know what the angel of Lord said just as you feel led Hallelujah so see in the book of Acts we have we have this standard of the book of Acts but we don't have all the details okay amen so in each case we got to pray seek God first right seek God put your put your sacrifice before God put your fleece before God and see how God's leading you to go praise God and right now at our home you know for our Bible time we're reading through the book of generations the book Jose got me I keep mentioned it but we read through we probably read through seven or eight of those and each one of them each one of them has some type of testimony from the discernment lines of brother Brandon it's amazing they saw people get healed from Poli tuberculosis crippled walk and so see when brother was given the choice do I do 500 or do I discern each one slowly he chose a slow discernment but look at the testimonies that come out of it right Hallelujah remember the main thing is that we're serving Jesus Christ right because if you get well if you get a miracle that's great but are you going to keep serving Jesus right that's the most important thing Hallelujah but see that I just thought that's a great example of you know we all have Liberty the holy SP like I said with holidays we looked at holidays you know on Wednesday with the the uh Deeds of nickads and some people are really against holidays other people see the Liberty in it I see the Liberty in it but I got to make sure that my Liberty doesn't become sin it does which would be a distraction right so whatever we do we must find the Liberty remember brother Rand had a Christmas tree brother random said Merry Christmas Hallelujah brother Ram gave gifts out to his children brother Ram uh celebrated uh Thanksgiving Easter brother R celebrated all these holidays but in each case you gotta you got to stay in communion with the holy spirit so you don't get distracted you don't go too far you keep the balance and you stay in the liberty of the holy spirit amen amen so now I can read acts 13 boy my voice is really out my goodness wasn't really happy about that now there were in the church that's at an certain prophets and teachers and Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and LU of sirene and Manan which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and saw isn't this interesting God saved a man out of the political system he was brought up with Herod right so we'll say like this A man was involved in the White House and God saved him out of there gave him the Holy Ghost praise God I like that amen God can save him from anywhere remember the Bible said there's not many wise there's not many great that God's called but there will be some great ones that God calls to this message praise God amen amen oh yeah like this I know a uh I was I'm in contact with a a pastor from Minnesota and he used to be an NFL football player brother Austin I never knew it his name's Brian really and he believes a lot of the same things we do and I thought wow there's an example I he prob make millions of dollars he's a backup player but I forgot about that God called him uh out of the the NFL and now he's a pastor now he's an older man now I think he played in the 67s OR 80s I thought there's a good example God calls a great great person great by the world standards and shows him the nonsense of that and brings him into the truth praise God Amen now look at verse two as they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereinto I have called them so see how do they minister to God did you ever realize that sometimes it's your duty to minister to God right amen right we always say God bless me God God I need this that's God ministering to you but has ever been a a reality where sometimes you need to minister to God now the Bible said God doesn't need anything right but when you want when you want God's will for something it's as if you go make sacrifices and you go make offerings right and it's that it's as you're ministering to God and then God will speak back amen like I just read about Samuel and Saul when Saul became king and before Saul was King went to Samuel's town and they said hey we got a prophet in town you better take him some bread and some meat right take take the man of God a present I'm not asking for presents because I'm not a prophet brother R is a prophet Hallelujah we might have Minor Prophets but I just like that look at the respect look at the the respect when when they need a word from God they go offer a sacrifice amen now it's not legalism we're not making a legalistic item for us mainly it's just confessing sins and worshiping God when we need something from God we got to confess our sins we got to bring an offering we got to worship God we got to minister to the Holy Spirit praise God Amen okay and that's why you know if we want to have separate par means that we can it's a good idea but we got to have a a motive behind it the motive behind this is what do we do for missionary work Hallelujah right and so God answers here as they fasted they ministered the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work called them to do verse three and when they fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away and so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed unto salua and from then they sailed to Cyprus amen so see if you desire prayer meetings that's a wonderful thing we all should desire prayer meetings hallelujah amen right if we need leader especially if we need leadership or we need an answer from God or we got a big decision to make or we want to go out this ministry we feel led to do you must pray seek God you must minister to God hallelujah and then God will minister to you praise God Amen now see church that's why many times I'll fast on a Sunday and then I'll come here and pray what am I doing I'm trying my best to do this on a very regular basis or I won't eat Wednesday before church I won't eat fast and just pray and meditate get on the word of God what am I trying I'm trying to get wisdom from the word of God and I believe God's helped me by God's grace amen there's been times I haven't known what I preach and maybe I preach something that was just for you or something or God K somebody at the end of a of a service what do I give that I give that credit to the word of God because the word of God has taught me I've got to minister to God I got to show God some love and respect hallelujah amen I got to consecrate myself unto God and then God will answer my prayer hallelujah amen see that so there's four examples of just just going over the preparation uh the Saints must make in the Supernatural book of Acts church and the church said bring the oil you got you got to stomp it out you got to get it ready you got to filter it out right you got to filter the oil out you don't want pieces of oil or olives in their oil you got to filter it out you got to bring the Palms you got to go out get the branches and bring the Palms you got to get your sword sharpen you got to get your gear on Amen Hallelujah and here you got to pray and fast and call on God Amen and gather together with Saints of light precious Faith so those are all I love the requests when people want to do extra prayer so I I say let's pray first together and if we see this if we see the Zeal if we can see some Zeal coming up then we'll do extra prayer meetings as well by God's grace amen all right Hallelujah now let's go to Acts chapter 5 we read 12 through 16 Acts chapter 5 so that's a little bit of a review but it's been years since I've actually preached that probably 2017 or so haven't preached that for years I just want to lay that out there and that's we do we see these types in the book of Acts because that's what brother brand did Brother looked at the type of Jericho Joshua chapter 6 and he brought it to his church okay we'll have trumpets we'll have the songs and then the word hallelujah so we can learn from that by God's grace so in Acts chapter 5 we see the power of a holy church Scofield calls it Hallelujah no no doubt these Apostles had many signs and wonders wrought amongst the people and notice they brought the sick ones to the apostles that were vexed and they healed them everyone now remember earlier with Jesus they couldn't heal some because they weren't doing what they weren't praying and fasting right so if they're healing everyone what have they learned amen they've learned to pray and fast hallelujah amen now remember chch I'm not making this legalism but I'm saying if we want God to use our gifts if we want to see more Supernatural we got to be consecrated to our gifts like I read that quote on Wednesday ra said you got to be just as interested in your ministry as the pastor is in his I'm trying to be very interested in my Ministry I'm trying to now I'm trying to post a quote from Brother brand every single day that not just helps the YouTube but just to keep me in the word of God that's why I'm doing that too amen I just want to stay in that word as much as I just want to be reminded because I forget a lot of quotes there's a lot of quotes out there there's a lot of scriptures I forget there's a lot of quotes I forget I want to stay in that channel remember the word of God meditate on the word of God because you never know God might use what you place if you put those little seeds in there God will water and it'll it'll bring forth at the right time it'll bless somebody at just the right time praise God Amen put all these seeds in there and then God will bring forth those seeds in the right time and season our hearts and Minds Hallelujah now verse 17 here's the second persecution against the church then the high priest rose up and all that were with them which is the sect of the Sadducees and they were filled with indignation they laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life amen hallelujah what a testimony now again remember when I demonstrated this with Malachi you know they laid their hands on them and they drag them off to jail now would we would our face stand if that was the case in America would our face stand or we say oh no no you got the wrong guy I I I want my freedom don't take me to jail would you recant or would you go to jail for Jesus Hallelujah now it's come down to some people it's starting to come down for some conservatives on that right they've been taken in jail uh of course we're seeing it more and more slowly it's the birth pain of slowly moving into that more and more but the but remember as I said last time just like with job Satan had Satan was before God and God had to say you can take them to jail just don't take their life so if you go to jail or if anything bad happens to you you know God allowed it right right God didn't abandon you God's letting you be tested so you can overcome praise God he wants your faith to go through the fiery test of Affliction that it may come forth as gold God let these trials these bad things happen to us they'll make us more like Christ amen amen just like job he come out better he come out repenting God I I said things I didn't I didn't understand I I I made myself more rightous in you forgive me that God says I'm blessing you with double what you had before you passed the test Hallelujah so they lay hands on him and I love this the Angel takes him out and what does he say go speak the words of this life not legalism it's life this Bible produces a life how many enjoy the life God Gave You amen it's not a life it's not a death it's aive praise God Amen he says go stand in the temple and and speak the words of the light what do we got we've got eternal life hallelujah amen we've all got natural life but that's not what the angel was talking about the angel was telling them go talk about eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen that's what he's telling them so what they do here's another gift now this is my favorite one of I shouldn't say my favorite gift this is the gift that I got verse 21 and when they heard that they entered in the temple early in the morning and talk see there's teaching so does the book of Acts church have teaching yes just like had tongues in Chapter 2 right just like it had miracles in chapter 3 and the saint said amen it has all these just like had a miracle right there the angel opened the prison doors set them free they didn't have to escape but the angel of Lord let them out of prison a supernatural Miracle this is the supernatural book of Acts Church hallelujah amen as we saw what were they doing praying fasting they were dedicated to God their hearts and Minds were on God all the the time they were able to use God's gifts that God had given them they were faithful to God's gifts Hallelujah but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the Senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within Hallelujah now when the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where to this would grow then came one of them uh saying behold the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people just like Jesus right there's times remember there's two types of preaching there's two types of of preaching there's preaching and there's teaching preaching raises your faith for Supernatural it's public it's publicly declaring the power of God teaching gives you instruction this is how you serve God right so what what have I giving today I'm giving teaching we need to fast and pray right we need to come together we need to everyone needs to bring an anointing of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen see that's teaching you to teaching that these scriptures tell us what we need to do to serve God better Hallelujah all right verse 26 then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people that they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in his name and behold you have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us okay so see that they brought them and they laid them before the councel said didn't we tell you not to teach in this name I love these words Peter says verse 29 then Peter and the others Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men amen even if I get arrested I'll obey God rather than men right we're seeing more of that coming around as we said in America there's more crooked uh Das there's more crooked judges than ever before so we don't know what we're going to have to do we don't know what we have to suffer but we must speak the name of Jesus Christ especially I want to share this with the adult especially with 2024 coming the last presidential election we had what happened Co came in they tried to strip a lot of our Liberty so adults we got to pray here we go here we go 20124 it was all set up by the government yeah we got to pray about death remember there the government that killed JFK it was a Government tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan our own government our own government paid for the co virus and Unleashed it right that was four years ago here we come another time so the thing to do is just be ready and pray don't live in fear but let God hear your prayers Hall remember each time it's a harder pressure right just like a birth pain you mothers know what I'm talking about it's birth pain so we can expect likely another pre time of pressure and and no doubt most people most preachers will say well this is the rapture this is the rapture it doesn't matter no man knows the day or the hour we'll always be ready for the Rapture praise God if we're born again if we're God if we're seeking to be born again wherever we're at if if our name's on the Lamb's Life we'll be ready for the Rapture praise God that's why he called me out the world he didn't call me out of the world to Lead Me in the tribulation he called me out of the world to get me ready for my wedding with Jesus amen [Applause] hallelujah now verse 30 the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him ha God exalted with his right right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins and we Are Witnesses of these things and so also is the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him those sisters down in Junction City keep asking me how do we get the Holy Ghost how do we get the Holy Ghost I said just keep confessing your sins and serving God I think I made a video about it daily repent pray obey I said that's it just just that I'm try to make it as simple as possible because that sister remember that sister who got the Holy Ghost she was seeking the Holy Ghost for seven 17 years I hope none of us have to wait 17 years but 17 years she was seeking the Holy Ghost I just Tred to make it so simple just daily the Bible says seek ye the kingdom of God right what's the kingdom of God the holy ghost seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you and here the Bible says if we obey God God will give us the Holy Ghost amen so just very simply just keep obeying God M keep confessing any sins amen just build diligence into your life build dedication to your life build your life upon the rock of God's word amen amen each one of us is building a life remember Jesus parable Matthew 7 you're either building your life on a rock or sand let's build it upon the rock of Jesus Christ because in in the parable we know it's coming a storm's coming amen right but we want our house to stand Hallelujah we don't want our testimony to fall apart well I thought he was a message preacher or I thought he believed the message I thought she believed the message we don't want our house to fall we want our house to stand no matter the storms of life and it will if we build it on the revelation of the rock of Christ amen hallelujah in a clapping mode today amen hallelujah hope it's not too loud lady let me know if it's too l so see that simple advice I give to people just obey God his spirit's coming amen you know you don't know when the wind's going to blow but it's it's coming by God's grace Hallelujah like I said if we want and I'll let me talk to the Saints too as we go afterwards if we want to have just Holy Ghost meetings for people to pray to get the Holy Ghost let's set them up we got to work with some we got to work with work schedules but what's work with that let's we'll have them on the day that you can be there right that's what brother Brown did in 19 was it 1961 he had Holy Ghost had a whole weekend I'm just seeking the Holy Ghost was Friday Saturday Sunday now which was sad they didn't record the Saturday night service that's the one where the Holy Ghost really fell and he's like oh I wish they would have got a tape of it last night he said there were shouting screaming dancing kind of like we've had you know but uh he did a series of what is the Holy Ghost how do you receive the Holy Ghost yeah that was the service they didn't record how do you receive the Holy Ghost that's when it fell that night the second night Saturday night but I'm open to that church I want to be led by the Holy Spirit I don't want to be led by well we do this every year so we're going to do this this year I don't we don't have to do that remember Traditions are okay right it's okay to have some tradition that don't write the word of God but I also want to be led into new things by God's grace I want to see what does the Holy Spirit want for us today what does the Holy Spirit want for us for 2024 praise God I remember Naomi's word for 2023 was experience right wasn't that the the word you were praying for was was that the right word supernal Supernatural amen hallelujah God definitely visited Us in that in a number of ways Hallelujah but however God's leading the church we want to be led that direction hallelujah amen now see I've been I've LED I've been felt led like Johnny felt led to do those Sunday night studies has everybody enjoyed dos we were LED I've never done that before we were led into that Johnny felt led to do that so I felt led to do that too but we don't have to keep doing that forever we can go back to preaching twice on Sunday if you want want to hear me preaching clapping shouting screaming we'll do that on Sunday night too or whatever you be allowed to do but the main thing is gather more as we see that day approaching obey God and God will give you what you have need of praise God even those of us who have the Holy Ghost we might want a refilling in our minds hallelujah or we might have a need of some healing or we might have a need of a lost loved one or just a Ministry God is my Ministry in its right place am I serving you the best I can I want to draw n to you so you'll Draw N to me am okay verse 33 when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them the Christians said we're going to obey God not you they said then they start playing well now we're going to kill you right people and you see you see that anger but and it's true like we saw with the Hamas that same demon that was on Hitler is on the Hamas people they're doing the same things Spirits never die right and brother R said thus sayith the Lord that spirit that was on Rome is coming to the us through the same persecution it did in Rome right of course we know it's for the tribulation but Saints we got we got to recognize it's coming but God's making us ready the Rapture is coming too amen hallelujah persecution is coming but Deliverance salvation and Escape is coming as well Hallelujah we don't know when no man knows the day or the hour we want to be maken ready by God's grace verse 34 then stood there up one in the council a Pharisee named Gia a doctor of the law had a reputation among all the people and commanded to be put the apostles forth a little space okay so Gia is the the teacher in the Jewish synagogue and he can see his Jewish brothers are about ready to kill these Christians so what does Gia do gamea he tries to tell these guys don't kill the Christians brother Ram said he might get eternal life just for doing that that's what brother said he said perhaps remember perhaps Gia and Nicodemus will receive eternal life because they stood for God's people in a difficult time Hallelujah think about the people in your life that have helped you they weren't messeng Believers but think about the people that helped you in your difficult hour God might be giving them eternal life he said give them a little space now remember they've already been arrested twice they already spent a night in prison and now God anoints God anoints gamea and says give them some space don't try to kill them that's one see that's one thing we got to keep in mind if it's our time to go it's our time to go like brother said if it ain't my time to go there's nothing the devil can do to take me I might suffer I might struggle but there's nothing the devil can do if God doesn't want me to go praise God so we just stand on God's word faith was we we can thank God for the time that we have here redeem the time because these days are evil right Hallelujah verse 35 and said to them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up thas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all As many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to not so here's his wisdom he tells his Jewish friends that got their swords they want to go kill the Christians he said this this Christian move is an uprising but remember there was men that did uprisings before and they came to not they came into the movement killed itself like that's what we're seeing the woke movement right the woke movement really got big in 2020 with the black lives matter movement which did you see what they did they donated millions of dollars and the the owners of the founders of black lives matters didn't give any money back to those communities they went and bought themselves Mansions so it proved it was not a genuine desire to help out people it was a political move for money right so we see that whatever you know they're eating the back to the the woke are eating themselves down now you can never be woke enough right you can never be uh demonic enough demons attack each other that's brother that's where they get War they attack one another they got territories right they want to take people they want to fill people's bodies they attack one another I'm glad Christians love and forgive one another praise God demons tear each other down but Christians we build ourselves up praise God Amen we edify the body in love the Bible says hallelujah there we go now verse 37 and this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of taxing and Drew away away much people after him and he perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed so Gia is a real Jewish teacher and he gives two witnesses in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established so he knows if I get two examples to my Jewish breth that want to kill the Christians I know they'll least considerate so he gives two examples here's two uprisings both both movements died out because it was the wrong motivation right and church don't you know the same thing they're doing in America now with the transvestites and all this trans movement that was already done in China years ago when China went over to this uh communism that's in now that's how they started they had all the teenagers and the the young adults all the men and women cut their hair the same they dressed the same no more men and women's garments they killed all the traditions and they just made everybody like a follower of the state that's what they're trying to do in America this has been done before it's the same demon power Powers but we've got overcoming power it won't touch us hallelujah but what I'm saying is we can see what's going on my wife and I watched the video when we had our uh 20th anniversary getaway watch the video all this that's happening now trans and everything it's already happened that's how they've taken over Nations before but we've got the power of prayer we got the power praying fasting praise God Amen what are we going to sit by and let it happen no we're to stand we're stand with God's word and pray and ask God to change things praise God Amen whatever he changes he changes Hallelujah we can't just sit here and do nothing we've got to call to God call upon God while he's near praise God Amen now verse 38 and now I say to you refrain from these men other words don't kill them and let them alone for if this counsel of this work be a men it will come to not but if it be of God you cannot overthrow it less happy happily you be found even to fight against God so see that's a lot of wisdom from an old Bible teacher a Jewish Bible teacher G that's a lot of wisdom I've seen these movements rise up before if they're really of God you don't want to fight against God but if they're not of God they'll rise up and fall down right rise up and fall down and that's how it is even the message you know different movements have risen up like the seven Thunders the two Souls perusia now the tape Church movement's rising up I just say Let It Go I know it's off the word Let It Go I'm going to see it fall again it's going to fall all their bragging all their boasts and claims let them say whatever they want if it's of God I'm not going to fight against it but I know it can't be of God if you're breaking God's word hallelujah and it'll come to not amen right see that's why each one of us we have to have our own personal experience with God and if we're really in touch with the fivefold ministry The Winds of Doctrine won't move us again we'll stand on the solid rock of the word of God hallelujah amen we're not going anywhere makes me want to sing brother B I shall not be I shall not be moved right just like a tree right planted by the rivers of water I can't be moved I've been around the message uh for 20 almost 23 years now I can't be moved out the truth because I'm founded on the rock of Revelation praise God amen amen by God's grace verse 39 for be of God you cannot overthrow it that's happy you be found even to fight against God that's one thing we don't want to do is fight against God we do not want to speak against God and we don't want to fight against God and even when I you know I've I've taken stands on different topics like the tap Church movement and the goats the goat debate before I've said anything I've waited on God to see what God's word is right and I've searched the scriptures I studied about it I prayed about it I reached out to people to see what kind of spirit they got on it Hallelujah like with brother Billy Paul before he passed I wrote him a letter three years before I passed I said Billy Paul brother Jose I ever give you a copy of that letter okay I said brother here's five things you got you and Joseph are wrong on and please correct me if I'm wrong and the the brother although he's fast I'm sure we love him I love him but he never even would address one of the one of the five things okay now if I was working for Austin was working for me training my dog I said brother Austin I want you to do these five things and Austin didn't do those five things how would I feel or if Austin told me it was training me to train my dog let's say I had a dog I would have a dog I never have a dog maybe some actually I would say never but if Austin said brother Jess you need to do five things and next week come back make sure you do these five things with your what if I come back and say Austin how you doing and I I don't even talk about the five things what kind of customer do you think I would be what kind of customer would I be not not not his customer and see you can't be God's fivefold Ministry if you don't obey God's word hallelujah I can show you five and now it's 24 things if I can show you 24 things wrong and you won't even address one something's wrong with that if my wife said brother Jesse you've done these 24 things can you fix these 24 things at our house can you and if I just say how you doing honey the next day you feeling okay today what do you want to do today I asked you to do these 24 things can you please address one of them and that's what it is and that reminds me of the the parable of that man when when he come in with no wedding garment they said where's your wedding garment and he didn't say nothing that's what reminds me brother Jose I ask these brothers here's 24 things you li on what's your answer and they don't say nothing it shows they're wrong to my opinion of it but see if we're on the rock of the word and storms come and questions come they don't move us they don't blow down our house they don't destroy our testimony we keep standing we keep testifying that there is a true God hallelujah there's a true message there's a true Bible there's a true Holy Spirit and we've got it praise God amen amen amen I've seen him in his power I've seen him in his glor praise God to my experiences I believe it with all my heart we're going through these Seasons where there's winds blowing we got to stand on the word of God am Hallelujah I do not want to fight against God I want to fight for God Amen Hallelujah now remember church this is a good point brother Perry green brought up you might remember this Jose brother Perry green didn't like the church age book I don't know why I keep going back to Bar Green he's a good he's a good man we talk about him um there's a part of the church age book that says uh the elect cannot persecute the elect remember that but then per green brought it out King Saul persecuted David wasn't King Saul saved yes he was saved after he died David wrote a song about him what he was so mighty he lyia he won his first two battles what were the first two battles again was it the amalekites the ammonites the Philistines ammonites and the Philistines and that's what David remembered he wrough Mighty testimonies I just read through it but I couldn't remember the exact names I just listened and read through it this week and David was singing about his testimonies when he was young and on fire for God Amen God help us Amen to stay on fire for Christ amen just like with Billy Graham or Roberts as they get older they get into complexes we got to say aw from that we got to stay humble before God brother R say true to God all the way to to the end he actually confessed his complexes before the people remember standing in the Gap brother ra said here's my complex the people won't receive my message so I don't want to go out and preach to them anymore he actually shared that now what would you feel like if I come to church and I said I've got a complex with everybody you're not doing what I told you to do I'm not going to preach anymore how would you feel about me hopefully you still love but that's how humble brother ad was he tell you the complex glory amen but what do we do we love him we admire him because we see Christ in him amen he's overcoming he's overcoming he's confessing his sins he's overcoming he's saying this is my fault this is something I got to overcome and I love God always comes in and saves him from doing he was going to go he was going to move away from Jeffersonville and move up into the mountains and not even preach anymore but the Holy Ghost said if you do that you'll be a bum and your wife will leave you I love that how God will protect us from the plans we make and that's why I love the Bible says I know the plans that I have for you plans of peace and an expected end praise God hallelujah brother had his own plans but God said no you're keeping my plans amen hallelujah right we all get plans I'm going to do this because I'm upset or I'm frustrated or I'm depressed I'm going to go do that and God said no that's the wrong plans you're keeping my plans Hallelujah do not want to fight against God Amen want to fight for God and if I'm fighting for this word I know I'm fighting for Christ these men and women didn't die in vain to give us this Bible men and women didn't die for the Bible so we could make brother's tapes thus sayi the Lord every single word on there men and women didn't die for this Bible for that purpose we believe the truth on the tapes but we're not here to worship tapes verse 40 and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them so see now now the devil gets permission you can beat them but don't take their lives I wonder how many punches they took brother Austin how many kicks did they take once they're down how many kicks did they take they get beaten and at some point while they're kicking them just the Holy Ghost will come the angel would come down and say that's enough that's enough how many how many would be willing to suffer that for Christ get beat up for Christ and notice Church they didn't fight back America we got the right to fight back we got guns too which you can do that if you're LED do it Hallelujah def even the Jews had uh ability to defend themselves but this was an ordained experience they're arrested they're getting beaten do you remember Brother s that Russian brother that would come here did you know he was arrested in uh Russia do you know that he was beaten he was tied up for I think about two or three days all because he was a Christian and then some that's why he loves this message he was there a couple Saturdays when or Sundays when I went over Junction City after service all he want to do is sit around and play guitar and sing all those good old songs I'm one of them he's been arrested he's been beaten for this message and he's still standing for it I like a man like that don't you that's why he says brother Jesse you want to come preach these people remember I told you I really tired I didn't want to go have to drive all that but I went anyway and God blessed it that's why I respect that guy that that brother sge said well just I think God's calling you to teach those people I said okay brother you say so I'm a little tired you know that was last a that was last March almost a year now brother I'm a little tired I'm a little worn out but okay if you feel that brother I I'll pray about it a man that suffered beaten and imagine imaginea Austin disappears for three days you're like what are you going to call me what you you probably say say overnight at our house right or I disappear for three days daddy where you at daddy what's going on and all of a sudden I show up I'm beaten I got bruised but I'm thankful for Jesus that happened in Russia I think it was like 15 or 20 years ago that's why they moved now they got a little church there in Columbus now he's not a pastor but there's two guys that kind of do the work he doesn't feel like a pastor but see that's the same thing today Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if God lets you get beat up he know you'll overcome it praise God it'll be for a testimony now that gives me courage if that man can stand there and sing in Russian and if he can preach in Russian and that gives me courage if he can do it I can do it praise God am cuz he suffered way more than me way more so if he's got courage to do it I'll stand right by his side praise God amen amen I'll support the work that God's doing there and remember how they remember how they even started church that brother sge wanted to build a house so he reached out to the Amish community they weren't even message Believers and they I think they buil him a house or I I forget maybe they built him a barn I can't remember what it was house or a barn but through that he met brother Levi who had shared the message and then Levi went and shared the message with that church down there in Junction City and that's when they come out into the message see even in your little things like housing or clothes or cars or grocery shopping even in those things even you would think well God don't care about my barn God don't yes God does care about it amen right we don't want to be selfish or you know we don't want to be L to seeing but if we need a barn we need a barn right I need these things and God is even in the midst of all that Hallelujah then God just called me to be a part of it by God's grace amen but it's it's God's work it's God's church amen and God is building his church Hallelujah they beat them they command them they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name what a test after you're beat up you're happy we go to tawo we get beat up a little bit might be a little happy after that but this is a whole another thing you get beat up by guards soldiers and you leave there rejoicing as you're leaving and maybe your ribs you maybe have a broken rib and it hurts that happened one time I got punched at I no I had to get a broken rib because I couldn't breathe right for months it just hurt ouch master great action but these guys are beaten and as they're beaten as they're leading they're rejoicing thank God I could suffer for his name may God help us have that kind of Faith next time we go through a trial say thank you Jesus I could suffer for your name praise God someone cussed me out or someone flipped me off or somebody spoke bad about me or somebody doesn't want to talk to me anymore all for your sake thank God I can suffer for your sake praise God remember even speaking even somebody speaking a word against your name get you get you reward in heaven remember that Jesus said leap for Joy when somebody speaks bad about you because your reward is great in heaven let's read that I'm going to look that up in my Bible I just kind of came to me there only six new testament times of leap so it's really really easy to find Luke 6:22 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake I had all kinds of people do that in Liberty Center when I first got saved and come in the message I had there was three or four guys in high school that got saved because I got saved but once I got the message then they call me a devil right so what did Jesus say you're blessed when that happens Hallelujah I won't worship their denominational Creeds I'm blessed because I believe the word of God next verse so in that day he said leap I'm going to LEAP again ready I'm going to leap for Joy again Hallelujah behold your reward is great in heaven just if they say something about it about your name oh Naomi and beus they're Holy Rollers they're goody two shoes the Bible said rejoice in that day because they spoke against your name because you're not living your name you're Liv in the Name of Christ Hallelujah there's my hour you're stand it for Jesus great is your reward in heaven when people just won't associate you or say well he's he's blasphemed or that's what they said about me those friends called that Pillar of Fire with brother R my friends called that Satan and I said God have mercy on them one of the guys that said that his wife got a pretty got L disease pretty bad not sure not long after that I don't know I'm just like I like I told you even when uh that home church back home when they said thus sayi the Lord serpent seed of the devil and they went through that season of divorce a season of funerals my M called it a season of death I just look at those things I'm not saying it's exactly uh you know A and B I'm not saying it's because of that but it sure looks like it is because I don't want to fight against God and I know the word of God and the word of God is true and we've got answers in the word of God we've got truth in the word of God we've got joy in the word of God we've got victory in the word of God we got freedom in the word of God we've got a new life in the word of God hallelujah amen Le for Joy brother sister leap for Joy when people speak evil you sister iser that reminds me of that text you God that sometimes family members might be upset with you for certain reasons remember that leave for Joy sister they speak evil of you praise God Jo Hallelujah why because in like manner they did that to the fathers the prophets all down to the ages God's people have always been ridiculed mocked made fun of in this case in Acts 5 they're beaten kicked and punched and they leave there rejoicing thank God I can suffer some reproach for the name of Jesus remember we got to know him both in the power's resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings glory verse 42 we'll close with this and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ let stand our Mal will be let you come up here Mal be back in a moment they get meet up they're rejoicing on their way back and they said we're not stopping teaching and preaching about Jesus Christ we will not stop so no matter what we go through church we're not going to stop serving Christ and if God let something awful happen like brother van Z's dad passing even in that we can see the mercy of God no matter what we may go through no matter the questions we might have we know God is merciful god is gracious God had it all planned out Hallelujah whatever we must suffer for the name of Jesus Christ let's do it with that understanding that wow God has bless me so much that I can suffer for being a Christian I can struggle just for the sake of knowing Jesus Christ Hallelujah I believe Church you know I believe that and I could be wrong I hope I'm wrong with this but I believe 2024 maybe a year or something strange might happen like 2020 we might have to suffer I don't know I have to suffer for being Christians I don't know remember it was out remember I was out in uh California they shut them down from going to church it didn't happen here well we were a big church so we could still come to church but in California they literally shut down churches so see that was the last squeeze right on this birth pains what's going to come next with the next election because these people in power they don't want to lose power they'll do anything to stay in power they'll kill they'll let all those millions of people that died of Co they did that on purpose to keep their power brother Ram said we know prophecy it's coming to this age and I'm I'm not a fearmonger you know me I'm not a fearmonger but we got to be ready if it happened four years ago it's probably going to happen this coming year so let's be ready through prayer how many Want To Pray by God's grace amen let's bow our heads here hallelujah we would play Jesus you know I was telling Austin the other day that it' be good to take a little time after service and pray
