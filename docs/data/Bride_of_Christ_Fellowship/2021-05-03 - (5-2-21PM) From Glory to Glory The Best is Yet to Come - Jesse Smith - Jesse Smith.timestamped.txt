[15:43] from glory to glory uh and this with the
[15:46] sub-topic
[15:47] the best is yet to come amen the best is
[15:50] yet to come
[15:59] second corinthians chapter three this is
[16:01] a beautiful text here
[16:03] showing us the type of moses in the
[16:06] presence of god and how
[16:08] we come into the presence of god moses
[16:10] was changed in the presence of god
[16:12] so are we changed every time we come
[16:15] into god's presence
[16:20] amen
[16:22] second corinthians chapter three
[16:42] let's go to verse
[16:45] 15 second corinthians 3 15.
[17:00] now i'll read verse 15 16 and 17 that we
[17:03] can all read 18 together
[17:08] verse 15 says but even unto this day
[17:11] when moses is read
[17:13] the veil is upon their heart can i say
[17:15] it like this
[17:18] when wes when wesley's read right
[17:21] and some people when brother branham's
[17:22] read right
[17:24] moses was a great man of god
[17:27] many people jews especially have failed
[17:29] to move on to this day well the same
[17:30] thing's true
[17:32] people can read his thoughts and it can
[17:35] be availed to their eyes they don't see
[17:37] the truth of it
[17:39] verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn
[17:41] to the lord
[17:42] the veil shall be taken away
[17:47] verse 17 now the lord is that spirit and
[17:50] where the spirit of the lord is
[17:52] there's liberty let's all read verse 18.
[17:55] ready one two three but we all with open
[17:59] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[18:03] of the lord
[18:04] are changed into the same image from
[18:07] glory to glory
[18:08] even as by the spirit of the lord let's
[18:11] have a word of prayer here
[18:12] ask god to minister here tonight
[18:14] heavenly father we're happy to be in
[18:16] your house lord god this is your house
[18:18] come and dwell amongst us heavenly
[18:20] father we love you we bless your holy
[18:22] name
[18:22] and father we're so grateful lord that
[18:24] we can gather under the name
[18:26] of jesus christ oh god let the holy
[18:28] spirit have us
[18:30] under the spirit of liberty tonight lord
[18:32] god and
[18:33] take this thought bless it to our hearts
[18:35] god that we can receive it
[18:37] and lord it will give us a fresh
[18:39] anointing lord god
[18:40] and it will change us as the scripture
[18:42] says from glory
[18:44] to glory father as we even prayed for
[18:46] this morning lord we need
[18:48] a stronger anointing lord god as the
[18:50] enemy comes in like a flood
[18:52] lord give us a stronger anointing father
[18:54] god
[18:55] to be lights and witnesses o god to
[18:58] testify
[18:59] of the truth of christ and to stand upon
[19:01] the word of god
[19:02] having done all to stand so father take
[19:05] this
[19:05] word blessed lord anoint us god for thy
[19:08] service in jesus christ's name and the
[19:10] saint said
[19:11] amen god bless you as you're being
[19:13] seated praise god
[19:21] praise the lord so at the end i'll have
[19:23] a few slides but i don't have any right
[19:24] now
[19:24] i'd kind of just add the notes there i
[19:26] haven't gone through
[19:27] and uh labeled everything i'd like to
[19:30] read
[19:31] so we're starting here in second
[19:32] corinthians and
[19:35] we will look to this chapter a little
[19:38] bit to kind of get an idea
[19:40] about the from glory to glory
[19:43] okay so at the beginning of this chapter
[19:46] paul's saying in verse one he said do we
[19:49] begin again to commend ourselves or need
[19:51] we as some others
[19:53] epistles of commendation to you
[19:56] or letters of condemnation i'm sorry
[19:58] commendation from you
[20:02] so paul is saying
[20:05] do ministers like he said myself and our
[20:07] ministers
[20:08] do we need letters of commendation in
[20:11] order for you to receive us
[20:13] right because in those days they had to
[20:14] send a letter they'd have to carry a
[20:16] letter oh look paul sent me
[20:18] you can receive me right but paul says
[20:21] do you need those type of letters those
[20:22] handwritten letters
[20:24] and verse two ye are our epistle written
[20:27] in our hearts
[20:28] known and read of all men
[20:31] so paul says you are our letter of
[20:34] recommendation right your testimony
[20:38] the life that you live is our written
[20:42] uh commendation right in other words
[20:44] your life proves
[20:46] that we are the true ministers of god
[20:48] amen
[20:50] so we we take a lot of joy in that
[20:52] because we know no matter what
[20:54] anyone says about us or no matter what
[20:57] we may say about each other right or
[20:59] what we may say about any other preacher
[21:01] any other ministry
[21:02] the life that we live proves what we are
[21:06] right a tree is known by its fruit
[21:08] praise god
[21:09] and when we live the word of god and
[21:11] hear the word of god our life speaks
[21:13] louder
[21:14] than any uh testimony or any email or
[21:17] any text you could write about
[21:18] you or me or anybody else the life we
[21:21] live speaks louder brother
[21:22] says your thoughts are louder in heaven
[21:24] than your words are on earth
[21:26] so god clear our thoughts right cleanse
[21:29] our thoughts help us to think the right
[21:31] thing
[21:32] what a beautiful portion this is verse 3
[21:34] for as much as ye are
[21:36] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[21:38] christ
[21:39] ministered by us so each person is a
[21:43] letter
[21:43] a spiritual letter of commendation right
[21:46] written by written by the spirit of god
[21:50] so the spirit of god makes every
[21:52] person's life you're a walking testimony
[21:54] right you're a walking letter
[21:56] of recommendation the spirit of god in
[21:59] your life
[22:00] right written by the holy spirit
[22:03] the spirit of the living god not in
[22:05] tables of stone
[22:07] but in fleshly tables of your heart oh
[22:09] it's so important for us to receive the
[22:10] word of god
[22:11] not just in our heads but it's got to go
[22:13] down to our souls praise god
[22:15] on our hearts and that way we become the
[22:18] epistle of christ we become the letter
[22:20] christ letter of commendation amen
[22:23] hallelujah and verse 4 in such
[22:26] trust have we through christ to godward
[22:31] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[22:33] to think anything as of ourselves
[22:36] but our sufficiency is of god see the
[22:39] word that he wrote
[22:40] upon us that makes us sufficient that
[22:42] makes us strong
[22:43] the word that we receive and believe and
[22:45] live
[22:46] that's what makes us strong praise god
[22:48] not of ourselves but it's his word
[22:50] that we receive in our hearts verse 6
[22:53] who
[22:54] also hath made us able ministers of the
[22:56] new testament
[22:57] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[23:01] the letter
[23:01] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[23:05] so the old testament they could lead the
[23:06] letter of the law but it can never bring
[23:08] life
[23:09] because the law couldn't take away sin
[23:12] right
[23:13] animal blood couldn't take away sin but
[23:15] the blood of jesus
[23:16] abolished all sin amen and what that did
[23:20] that
[23:20] set us free the bible says the bible
[23:22] says now the spirit of our sacrifice can
[23:25] come upon us
[23:27] i'm glad you know the the goat spirit
[23:29] can't come up
[23:30] upon us right the the lamb spirit or the
[23:32] uh the calf spirit
[23:34] none of those animal spirits could come
[23:35] upon us right but the
[23:37] spirit of jesus christ our sacrifice
[23:39] does come upon us
[23:41] and it gives us life not the letter the
[23:44] letter kilth but the spirit of the
[23:46] sacrifice
[23:47] gives life verse 7 but if the
[23:50] administration
[23:51] of death written and engraved in stones
[23:53] was glorious
[23:54] so that the children of israel could not
[23:56] steadfastly behold the face of moses
[23:59] for the glory of his countenance which
[24:01] glory was to be done away with
[24:04] how shall not the ministration of the
[24:06] spirit
[24:07] be rather glorious amen
[24:10] remember the old testament had moses
[24:12] face shining right it was so glorious it
[24:14] had it was delivered by angels
[24:16] but the bible says this one our our
[24:19] testament is even more
[24:20] glorious praise god it exceeds verse 9
[24:23] says it exceeds in glory
[24:26] verse 10 for even that which was made
[24:28] glorious had no glory
[24:30] in this respect by reason of the glory
[24:32] that excelleth
[24:34] for if that which is done away was
[24:35] glorious much more that which remaineth
[24:38] is glorious seeing then that we have
[24:41] such hope we use great
[24:42] plainness of speech and not as moses
[24:45] which put a veil over his face
[24:47] that the children of israel could not
[24:49] steadfastly look to the end of that
[24:51] which is abolished
[24:52] but their minds were blinded for until
[24:55] this day
[24:56] remaineth the same veil untaken away
[24:59] in the reading of the old testament
[25:01] which veil
[25:02] is done away in christ praise god so
[25:06] anyone without christ in the baptism of
[25:08] the holy ghost
[25:08] has a veil the bible said not over their
[25:10] face but a veil over their heart right
[25:13] it's veil it's keeping their heart from
[25:15] letting the light of christ
[25:17] shine into it right so we have to take
[25:20] off the veil and
[25:22] recognize that god's experience is more
[25:24] than just church membership right
[25:26] it's receiving the life of christ amen
[25:29] like in the the clear examples like
[25:31] david he had so much anointing right he
[25:33] could defeat goliath
[25:34] but he still fell to adultery right
[25:37] that's why this is much more glorious
[25:38] because we can defeat
[25:39] natural we could defeat natural giants
[25:42] we can we can cause spiritual mountains
[25:44] to move
[25:44] but we can also continue to live a holy
[25:47] life amen
[25:48] and not be taken down later our life can
[25:51] be
[25:52] more glorious because verse 18 says we
[25:54] are
[25:55] changed how many been changed by the
[25:56] holy spirit praise god
[25:58] in the last week and today right you
[26:00] could be changed today you could be
[26:01] changed last week
[26:02] the bible said you're changed by the
[26:04] holy spirit writing the word of god
[26:06] on your heart afresh from glory to glory
[26:10] amen i want to read this what brother
[26:13] branham said he had a good quote from
[26:14] glory to glory
[26:18] yeah brother brahm said the fire is
[26:19] moving on he said
[26:21] he said let's move on from glory to
[26:23] glory he said from bible experience
[26:26] to bible experience let's unfold and
[26:29] open our hearts raise our hands up to
[26:31] god
[26:32] he said keep saying so keep keep keep
[26:34] smart right
[26:35] stay in the bible don't get outside of
[26:38] that he says
[26:39] stay right there praise god see like
[26:42] with
[26:43] sister who is dad being healed that's a
[26:45] bible experience of with the prayer
[26:46] cloths right
[26:48] i can honestly say i don't think we ever
[26:49] had one like that like like that
[26:51] powerful
[26:52] so that see i'm going from that bible
[26:54] experience to the next one
[26:56] praise god and before that we must have
[26:58] i'm sure we had some other healing or
[27:00] some other testimony
[27:01] we brother said we go from that
[27:03] experience to another bible experience
[27:06] are you looking forward to the next one
[27:07] praise god see that's that's what we got
[27:09] to do we got to live from one experience
[27:11] to the next one we're changed from glory
[27:14] to glory our faith is going to be
[27:15] stronger next time praise god for the
[27:17] next
[27:17] the next battle the next test our faith
[27:19] can be stronger we can go higher in the
[27:21] things of god
[27:23] and yet we still live the same holy life
[27:25] amen
[27:26] we don't let sin in the door we keep the
[27:28] sin out praise god
[27:29] we keep the home clean and purge from
[27:32] all 11 right we just
[27:33] we just keep the same holiness and the
[27:35] bible it says we go from experience but
[27:38] to experience bible experience to bible
[27:40] experience amen
[27:42] oh it's beautiful i love how brother man
[27:43] said that let's move on
[27:45] he said it's time for us to make
[27:47] footprints praise god we can't stay here
[27:49] in this same camp he said the fire is
[27:51] moving
[27:53] so see we can't stay on the same things
[27:55] right we have to move deeper
[27:57] into the things of god amen hallelujah
[28:01] like i was telling that brother uh or
[28:02] that brother that sent us his book he
[28:04] had a good testimony
[28:05] uh he said i like that idea for your
[28:06] next book he said because if you missed
[28:08] one of the
[28:09] the revelations of the mysteries you're
[28:11] confused
[28:12] and that's so true the one i see a lot
[28:15] of people miss is the fifth one the
[28:16] statue of perfect man they miss that
[28:18] and they somehow they don't think that
[28:20] they get those until after they're born
[28:22] again and a lot of them don't even think
[28:23] they're born again
[28:25] and so it's for them it's a hopelessness
[28:27] right they've lost all hope they're like
[28:29] oh i'll never get
[28:30] virtue i'll never get that i never get
[28:33] real patience i'm so impatient
[28:36] like because they don't understand it
[28:38] they're so confused they don't know what
[28:39] they've got
[28:40] but church if we've got jesus christ
[28:42] living in us we should be able to see i
[28:43] have the faith of christ
[28:45] i have the virtue of christ i have the
[28:47] knowledge of christ right
[28:49] i've got the temperance i've got my
[28:51] passions under control
[28:52] i've got the patience of jesus amen so
[28:56] see we should see
[28:57] that uh we've got to overcome the
[28:59] confusion
[29:00] that the enemy brings so the mysteries
[29:03] are so crucial
[29:04] and he said that's what he thought was a
[29:06] a great element and i totally agree
[29:09] if we can't see a lot of these
[29:10] revelations like another one is the
[29:12] baptism of the holy ghost right with
[29:14] christ in you the hope of glory
[29:16] and i counted one time i think i knew
[29:18] five preachers that left the message
[29:19] because they all taught you get the holy
[29:21] ghost when uh you believe god sent a
[29:24] prophet
[29:25] that is that's not it it's not it's it's
[29:27] so far off it's not even close right
[29:30] these things are but see they're so
[29:31] confused on on these topics
[29:34] they think john the baptist got the
[29:35] baptism of the holy ghost in his
[29:37] mother's womb
[29:38] well the bible said he was filled with
[29:39] the holy spirit but then john 7 says
[29:42] no one could receive the holy spirit
[29:44] though jesus was glorified
[29:46] and so they're so confused and they can
[29:48] condemn themselves well if a baby could
[29:50] get it
[29:51] and i don't have it how how how
[29:54] insignificant am i
[29:55] you know i must be hopeless if a baby
[29:57] can receive it but i can't
[29:59] but john didn't get it in the soul john
[30:01] got it in the spirit
[30:03] right and so that means john had to have
[30:06] his soul and spirit when he was in the
[30:08] mother's womb
[30:10] when he was six months old right
[30:14] so john's spirit and soul was already in
[30:16] him
[30:17] at six months old the holy spirit filled
[30:19] his mind which he couldn't talk at that
[30:21] point
[30:22] but yet he was leaping and shouting for
[30:24] joy in his mother's womb
[30:27] right but the holy ghost couldn't be
[30:28] given the soul till the day of pentecost
[30:32] but see that confuses it confuses people
[30:34] so badly
[30:35] but we know the real baptism of the holy
[30:37] ghost occurs when someone has repented
[30:40] fully surrendered they've obeyed the
[30:42] word of god god's cleaned out their
[30:44] uh their desires they want to be born
[30:46] again and then god fills them praise god
[30:49] that's the next thought on joshua
[30:50] that circumcision you know what that is
[30:53] church
[30:53] what is that a circumcision it's a
[30:55] willing
[30:56] surgery it's a willing self-inflicted
[30:59] pain
[30:59] of a surgery right a man has to go to
[31:02] that
[31:03] uh well a child the parents have to go
[31:04] to that and they willingly allow this
[31:06] surgery
[31:08] and god says circumcise your hearts
[31:11] right that's what god told israel well
[31:13] how can you circa it's not a natural
[31:15] thing it's a spiritual thing
[31:17] and god said you so in other in other
[31:19] words in order to be born again
[31:21] you've got to willingly say god cut this
[31:23] out of my life
[31:24] i don't want it anymore permanently take
[31:26] it out of my life amen
[31:29] and and so many people don't go there
[31:31] they they think they can still
[31:32] have a church membership and believe god
[31:34] sent a prophet and still enjoy sin
[31:37] but to be the very essence of being born
[31:40] again
[31:40] is that the old nature has been cut off
[31:43] and god makes you a new creature in
[31:45] christ jesus
[31:46] oh there's so much there's so much
[31:48] revelation church there's so much
[31:49] revelation god has given us
[31:51] that we should go from glory to glory
[31:53] the confusion should be taken away
[31:56] praise god all the doubts and all the
[31:58] all the misunderstandings
[31:59] should be taken away and we should see
[32:01] clearly the bible says we should see
[32:03] clearly the plan of god for our lives
[32:06] amen amen
[32:08] that's beautiful i love i love that
[32:10] quote we can't stay in the same camp we
[32:12] have to move on
[32:13] from bible experience to bible
[32:15] experience amen
[32:17] all right now here i'd like to uh look
[32:20] at that thought again
[32:21] we we're changed from the same image
[32:24] from glory to glory
[32:25] even by the spirit of the lord so the
[32:28] holy spirit won't let us stay the same
[32:31] right if we are going to obey the holy
[32:33] spirit we can't stay the same
[32:34] we've got to get more holy right we've
[32:37] got to we got to train our minds to be
[32:39] more obedient to the word of god now
[32:40] look at chapter four
[32:42] it goes right in this thought it keeps
[32:44] flowing because remember they didn't
[32:44] have chapters until just a few
[32:46] a hundred years ago when they inserted
[32:48] these chapters
[32:50] verse one therefore seeing we have this
[32:52] ministry as we have received mercy we
[32:54] faint not
[32:55] but have renounced the hidden things of
[32:57] dishonesty so see
[32:59] they will go from glory to glory so you
[33:01] have to renounce your dishonesty
[33:04] okay not walking in craftiness
[33:07] right nor handling the word of god
[33:09] deceitfully
[33:11] but by manifestation of the truth
[33:14] commending ourselves to every man's
[33:17] conscience
[33:18] in the sight of god so we have in other
[33:21] words you have to live true before every
[33:23] man right we have to manifest
[33:25] truth we have to tell the truth to every
[33:26] man or woman
[33:28] praise god and doing that then the bible
[33:31] says we renounce all dishonesty we live
[33:33] truthfully
[33:34] and we go from glory to glory now church
[33:37] the one of the greatest
[33:38] indicators of this is how you can live
[33:40] with your husband or wife right
[33:41] and your children they're the ones where
[33:44] we have to
[33:44] we have to make sure we show them the
[33:46] love of god we have to show them the
[33:48] spirit of truth right we have to
[33:49] manifest
[33:50] living true and living loving to them
[33:53] and that's
[33:53] no doubt if we live there at home if we
[33:55] live our our home lives with truth and
[33:58] and holiness and righteousness we will
[34:00] be changed from glory to glory
[34:02] my wife was telling me the other day
[34:03] just how she's seen our children
[34:05] improve in their walks with the lord you
[34:07] know i'm not there all the time so i
[34:08] didn't see i thought
[34:09] well praise the lord they're going from
[34:10] glory to glory
[34:12] now i see it a little bit but not as
[34:13] much as my wife you know she's there all
[34:15] the time
[34:17] and the same thing when you know guest
[34:18] ministers come and they talk to you and
[34:20] they fellowship with you and they'll say
[34:21] oh my what a wonderful time we had
[34:23] talking with the brothers and sisters
[34:24] and now they're really they're
[34:26] they're so holy and they're we had such
[34:29] a great time and
[34:30] they had such good testimonies about the
[34:31] lord so they can see
[34:34] you going from glory to glory now it's
[34:36] hard to see ourselves go right
[34:38] that's why we got those memorials we
[34:40] talked about this morning
[34:42] hallelujah where we can look back a year
[34:45] and say wow look how far we've come
[34:46] through the pandemic well pandemic
[34:48] right so just like just like a normal
[34:51] flu you know flu season
[34:53] well they call it these things but look
[34:54] look at our faith how it's grown
[34:56] stronger
[34:57] in the word of god we're more confident
[34:59] of god's word praise god
[35:00] we're still trusting in the living god
[35:02] we're not trusting in you know
[35:03] a government right we're not trusting in
[35:05] our own ability
[35:06] we're not trusting in the world's
[35:08] economy or the united nations
[35:10] we're trusting in the living god and
[35:11] we're going from glory to glory
[35:14] amen now
[35:17] so we can clearly see the texas
[35:21] moses stayed in god's presence and he
[35:23] went from glory to glory
[35:24] but now we live in the presence of the
[35:26] holy spirit
[35:27] and we go from glory to glory as well
[35:31] and that's what the statue of perfect
[35:32] man is from glory to glory from
[35:34] anointing to anointing
[35:35] from portion to portion all right
[35:39] now i want to just look at a few uh
[35:41] examples here
[35:42] of how we go from glory to glory and the
[35:45] best
[35:45] is yet to come
[35:49] so why don't i just start with some
[35:50] believers lives i just kind of want to
[35:52] uh
[35:52] go to let's go to job 42. i think i'll
[35:54] start there
[35:56] job 42. we'll just look at job's life
[35:58] and how the best of job's life
[36:00] was the end of his life
[36:04] job 42. so i preached on this you know i
[36:07] think i preached three sermons on it but
[36:08] i never really took a lot of time to
[36:10] read
[36:12] 42 verse 12. i never i don't think i
[36:14] read all these scriptures at the end
[36:17] remember earlier in chapter 42
[36:20] he says i've heard about god but now
[36:22] i've seen god
[36:23] and in verse 6 i abhor myself and repent
[36:26] in dust
[36:27] and ashes
[36:30] now remember he was such a mighty man of
[36:32] god right
[36:33] uh the princes would come to him and lay
[36:35] at his feet just to hear a little bit of
[36:37] wisdom before he got sick
[36:39] right before he he went through this
[36:40] test
[36:42] uh and he was a very wise man god said
[36:44] he's a perfect man
[36:46] but job still had areas where he needed
[36:48] to humble himself
[36:49] so god allowed it uh he he humbled
[36:52] himself
[36:53] and then the bible says he repents
[36:56] and god blesses his latter end more than
[36:59] his gr his
[37:00] former so verse 12 so the lord blessed
[37:03] the latter end of job
[37:04] more than his beginning for he had 14
[37:07] 000
[37:08] sheep six thousand camels and a thousand
[37:10] yoke of oxen
[37:11] and a thousand shias's he had also
[37:15] seven sons and three daughters and he
[37:18] called the name of the first
[37:19] gemini and the name of the second kaziah
[37:22] in the name of the third
[37:23] karen hapak and in all the land were no
[37:27] woman found so fair as the daughters of
[37:29] job
[37:29] and their father gave them inheritance
[37:31] among their brethren
[37:33] after this job lived 140 years
[37:36] and saw his sons and his son's sons even
[37:38] four generations
[37:40] so job died being old and full of days
[37:44] praise god so when was the best time of
[37:46] job's life
[37:47] the end was the best of job's life
[37:49] praise god he went from glory to glory
[37:54] right but he had to go through this very
[37:55] difficult testing time right
[37:57] months probably less than a year the
[37:59] historians say went through months of
[38:01] testing time
[38:05] oh okay yeah yeah please do uh
[38:08] yeah maybe use a different port now guy
[38:10] did you try all the ports
[38:11] all four okay yeah that's strange
[38:15] okay i think he needs this i had this i
[38:17] had a portable
[38:19] external drive across wait till he comes
[38:21] up but you can clearly see
[38:23] job's latter end was greater now now
[38:25] these are natural things right but we'd
[38:27] still consider them blessings how many
[38:29] would consider
[38:30] financial blessings a blessing from god
[38:32] yeah i would because i'm no good at
[38:34] making money right like
[38:35] i'm not a i'm not a stock market guy you
[38:38] know
[38:39] they can predict the stock markets and
[38:40] they can invest in the right stocks and
[38:42] make up
[38:43] ten thousand here the next week make
[38:44] twenty thousand i
[38:46] i couldn't do that i don't have enough i
[38:48] don't have enough nerve to do that
[38:50] some of your relatives can do that i
[38:52] think we've talked about that i know
[38:54] my brother can do it too one of my
[38:55] brothers but this guy
[38:57] he could make a lot of money or job was
[39:00] blessed
[39:01] financially with his animals so god
[39:03] bless his natural money
[39:05] right and his the fruit of his womb
[39:08] right
[39:09] seven sons and three dollars ten more
[39:11] children he had
[39:13] and then also his daughters were so
[39:15] beautiful you need to try this one too
[39:18] this has got uh that one truck well i'm
[39:19] sorry yes
[39:21] you got the cord okay that's so strange
[39:24] that worked all
[39:25] all day i'm not sure why it's not
[39:26] working that's all right
[39:30] and then the bible said his daughters
[39:32] were not just
[39:33] i mean he had great daughters but they
[39:34] were beautiful as well that was a
[39:36] blessing they have
[39:37] beautiful children handsome boys and
[39:40] beautiful girls right that was a
[39:41] blessing
[39:42] so god just poured out every blessing he
[39:44] could upon job
[39:45] because job was a man that feared god he
[39:48] sacrificed praise god
[39:49] he trusted god and god made the end of
[39:53] his life
[39:53] better than the beginning amen
[39:58] here's look at a few more here i got a
[40:00] number of different saints here
[40:01] i think i've skipped ahead so when was
[40:05] the best part of
[40:06] moses's life the first 40
[40:10] years middle 40 or the last 40. which
[40:13] part was best
[40:14] the last third of his life the first 40
[40:17] he was being taught the wisdom of egypt
[40:19] brother ramsey took the next 40 to
[40:21] burn it all out of him right praise god
[40:26] so church we got to remember that that
[40:28] uh you know god may take years to take
[40:30] things out of our life that we've
[40:32] allowed in them right things we've
[40:34] allowed
[40:35] god may take years brother said god will
[40:38] train a man
[40:39] years for a few months of ministry john
[40:41] the baptist
[40:42] he was trained 30 years for six months
[40:46] of ministry
[40:47] praise god amen that's an encouragement
[40:50] praise god
[40:50] and the idea is to remain faithful even
[40:53] while you're waiting for god to maybe
[40:55] put you in your position or
[40:56] put you in your life's purpose remain
[40:59] faithful to god
[41:00] be dedicated diligent to god that's what
[41:02] god's doing
[41:03] every day is training amen every day is
[41:05] a chance to get closer to him
[41:07] every day is a chance to show god how
[41:08] much you love him and appreciate him
[41:10] amen
[41:11] and then one day you'll find out what
[41:13] was the purpose what was
[41:15] the one thing in my life that was so
[41:17] important for me to do
[41:18] remember the the queen of sheba what was
[41:20] the one thing that she wants to do she
[41:21] know that she had lived a good life
[41:23] it was to cross the desert to say i'm
[41:25] going to make a trip
[41:26] across the desert i don't care who i
[41:28] don't care what happens
[41:29] i'm willing to risk my life in order to
[41:32] see this gift of god
[41:33] i want to see the man of god operate
[41:35] that discernment amen
[41:37] like brother brandon right brother said
[41:38] it the gifts are very similar get the
[41:40] discernment i want to see that
[41:42] discernment operate
[41:44] right she was willing to cross the
[41:46] desert and that's what god's going to
[41:48] use her for
[41:48] on the day of judgment praise god that
[41:51] was the one moment of her life that was
[41:53] so crucial
[41:54] that she had to just do something that
[41:57] was just so amazing but i said no one
[41:59] else can do
[42:00] what god's called you to do amen no one
[42:03] can do it
[42:04] you have something so unique that you're
[42:06] the only one
[42:08] that can i'll say like this step up to
[42:09] the plate and do god's will
[42:11] hallelujah oh thank the lord
[42:15] so job best part and moses the best part
[42:18] was that last third of his life the last
[42:21] 40 years of his life
[42:23] was the greatest time did he make
[42:26] mistakes yes
[42:27] i didn't get to this morning my brother
[42:28] branham said is it still what's the
[42:30] percentage on it
[42:32] okay well it's okay if it doesn't charge
[42:34] yeah just check again i don't think i
[42:35] have any other
[42:36] it's okay if we lose the live stream but
[42:38] you know big deal
[42:40] i know they might have been watching it
[42:42] that's so weird it worked all day
[42:43] yesterday did you
[42:44] try to plug it into different plugs on
[42:47] that um
[42:48] electrical outlet did you try that okay
[42:51] just try it's no big deal if we lose it
[42:53] you know just kind of maybe a chance for
[42:55] somebody to hear the word but
[42:57] no big deal as far as uh you know not a
[42:59] big concern
[43:02] moses oh yeah brother ram said uh even
[43:04] this last this
[43:05] even in the best part of his life
[43:07] brother adam said that he failed to
[43:08] circumcise studying on circumcision
[43:10] he failed to circumcise his sons so
[43:13] zipporah came
[43:14] circumcised the boys threw down the
[43:16] foreskins and said
[43:17] thou art a bloody husband to me brother
[43:19] abraham said god send us
[43:21] some zipporahs hallelujah
[43:25] now how can that apply to us god send us
[43:28] some mothers
[43:28] that will pray the children or adults
[43:31] through to the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:33] in other words if nobody else will come
[43:35] up and pray amen
[43:36] if you see somebody at the altar no one
[43:38] else will pray for them you come up and
[43:40] pray for them pray god
[43:41] no matter if you're male female preacher
[43:43] non-preacher if you see somebody who
[43:45] wants to be born again
[43:46] then you step up and you pray for them
[43:48] amen amen
[43:49] the man said send us some zephorus
[43:52] hallelujah but i'm talking about the
[43:54] churches the nominations won't get them
[43:56] born again
[43:57] he said the denominations don't want the
[43:59] baptism he said the seal of god
[44:01] they don't want the seal of god he said
[44:02] but send us some zipporahs
[44:04] that'll circumcise the hearts
[44:07] remember a woman can do anything except
[44:09] preach she has all nine gifts in the
[44:11] spirit
[44:12] she can pray for her people she can she
[44:14] can do any of those nine gifts
[44:17] right remember uh the bible said
[44:20] the bible said i preached this a few
[44:22] months ago the bible said the woman's
[44:23] like a cornerstone
[44:25] the bible said if you raise your
[44:26] daughters the right way they'll be
[44:28] cornerstones
[44:29] and who is the other cornerstone jesus
[44:31] christ amen so god
[44:33] how did god compare how can i compare a
[44:36] faithful woman
