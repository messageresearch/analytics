[33:44] a wonderful
[33:47] scripture here verse 10 let's just read
[33:49] verse 10
[33:51] notice how this proverbs 31 woman she is
[33:53] above all women
[34:00] there's none like this proverbs 31 woman

[34:22] let's read that together on three one
[34:24] two three
[34:25] who can find a virtuous woman
[34:28] for her price is far above rubies
[34:33] praise god let's go to
[34:36] ecclesiastes we're really close to
[34:38] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1.
[34:59] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1.
[35:06] let's read that together especially our
[35:08] young people let's remember
[35:10] the lord as you're young here on three
[35:12] one two three
[35:14] remember now thy creator in the days of
[35:17] thy youth
[35:18] while the evil days come not nor the
[35:22] near
[35:22] ears draw nigh when thou shalt say
[35:25] i have no pleasure in them amen let's
[35:28] have one more word of prayer let's have
[35:29] a need if you have a need on your heart
[35:30] let's just lift it up to the lord here
[35:32] heavenly father we just come reverently
[35:34] lord faithfully
[35:35] routinely lord as jesus did lord the
[35:38] scripture says jesus custom was to be in
[35:40] the synagogue
[35:42] on the sabbath so lord our custom is as
[35:44] often as we can to be in the house of
[35:46] the lord
[35:47] and we know lord there's no
[35:48] disappointments when we come to the
[35:50] house of god with faith
[35:51] so lord we come here with faith tonight
[35:53] lord we come with that trust that
[35:55] assurance that revelation
[35:56] that something will be said lord to
[35:58] bless us to strengthen us lord to help
[36:01] us
[36:01] to give us a little more grace and
[36:03] strength on the journey lord god
[36:05] and so god we're thankful for that lord
[36:08] we know your word can never fail
[36:10] lord god may we edify one another lord
[36:12] god and strengthen one another use me
[36:14] and use each person lord god to bless
[36:17] one another
[36:18] and father i just pray god you give me
[36:20] insight wisdom lord on this
[36:22] subject here tonight give me new
[36:24] thoughts lord if it be your will
[36:26] new things old old things father god
[36:28] treasures new and old
[36:29] let thy will be done bless those
[36:31] live-streaming lord god that have taken
[36:33] time out lord to
[36:34] to listen especially bless those that
[36:37] have pressed the right to the house of
[36:38] god here tonight lord god we know where
[36:40] two or three are gathered there you are
[36:42] in the midst
[36:42] thank you that you're here jesus we're
[36:44] trusting in you you're the guest of
[36:46] honor
[36:46] we put you first god we humble ourselves
[36:49] and father let your spirit have
[36:51] lord his way today father god none of us
[36:54] are anything at all we're just trusting
[36:56] in you or
[36:57] we're trying to use our gifts to yield
[36:59] to you lord god that you would uh speak
[37:01] something
[37:02] lord or answer some prayer father god
[37:04] minister to some need we pray
[37:06] we know you'll do it and we trust you to
[37:08] do it in jesus christ's name
[37:10] the saint said amen god bless you as
[37:12] being seated praise god
[37:16] we'll try to finish this thought and we
[37:18] may take one more service we'll see
[37:20] how it goes last time we ended with
[37:22] priscilla you know we ended with those
[37:23] lists of the women
[37:24] that were great testimonies that we
[37:27] could learn from
[37:28] like abigail bathsheba mary anna mary
[37:31] magdalene samaritan woman
[37:33] mary of bethany and then the priscilla
[37:35] we ended
[37:36] that with uh the last time we were
[37:38] gathered together on a wednesday night
[37:40] so let's look at this proverbs 31 woman
[37:41] i'm going to review a little bit when i
[37:42] preach on this uh about three years ago
[37:45] and then we'll uh we'll try to bring it
[37:48] down to a close there
[37:51] notice the bible said her value is far
[37:53] above rubies i did that online search
[37:56] a single carrot of a ruby was worth two
[37:59] million dollars for
[38:00] a single carrot okay and so this woman's
[38:04] value is far above
[38:05] two million dollars amen
[38:08] she has such a great value and the bible
[38:11] said who can find it
[38:12] right so these kind of women are hard to
[38:14] find as well praise god
[38:16] a proverbs 30 woman you're not going to
[38:18] find her just any old church right
[38:20] let alone any old business or any old
[38:23] home
[38:24] she's extremely hard to find this we're
[38:26] talking of course natural but
[38:27] ultimately pointing to the spiritual
[38:29] godly woman
[38:30] the bride of jesus christ she's just not
[38:33] found anywhere
[38:34] and her price is so great you could put
[38:37] millions if not of billions of dollars
[38:39] on it
[38:40] right such a great value for a real
[38:43] christian
[38:45] and woman course we know the bride was
[38:47] so valuable that god gave the greatest
[38:49] thing he could
[38:51] innocent blood that was the greatest
[38:53] gift he could
[38:54] give in payment to purchase back his
[38:57] fallen church his fallen people
[38:59] sending his own son so valuable he sent
[39:02] his holy sinless son
[39:04] to pay her price her ransom as we saw
[39:07] and give a receipt that the price has
[39:09] been paid amen
[39:11] thank the lord for that far above far
[39:13] above
[39:14] millions of dollars is this woman's
[39:16] value
[39:18] she's she's so much like the shulamite
[39:21] remember the shulamite from song of
[39:23] solomon
[39:24] she kept saying that she was he kept
[39:26] saying that she was
[39:27] the fairest of all in fact if you got
[39:29] your bible let's just read that real
[39:30] quick
[39:30] song of solomon uh one verse eight i was
[39:33] listening to brother brandon preach
[39:34] today and
[39:35] he let brother neville read he let all
[39:37] the preachers read and it was nice to
[39:39] hear that you know i kind of let our our
[39:42] little ones read here song of solomon 1
[39:45] 8
[39:46] and song of solomon uh 5 9.
[39:50] song of solomon 1 8 she was uh shulamite
[39:53] was
[39:54] unlike any other
[39:59] song of solomon 1 8 says if thou know
[40:02] not o thou
[40:02] fairest among women so there we see
[40:06] she's fairest among women that's the
[40:08] first witness
[40:09] we get a second witness in song of psalm
[40:11] 5 verse 9.
[40:12] thou hast ravished my heart my sister my
[40:14] spouse thou hast ravished
[40:16] my heart with one of thine eyes with i'm
[40:20] sorry that was 4-9
[40:21] that's good though she ravishes his
[40:23] heart that's right that's good
[40:24] 5 9 though what is thy beloved more than
[40:27] another beloved o
[40:28] thou pharis among women so there's twice
[40:31] two witnesses
[40:32] that solomon says she's fair than all
[40:35] other women
[40:37] and then song of solomon 6 1 whither is
[40:39] thy beloved god
[40:41] o thou affairs among women
[40:44] so again it's three times she's called
[40:46] uh fairest
[40:47] among women so i'm going back to
[40:48] proverbs 31 here
[40:54] now actually you know i think i read the
[40:55] wrong verse for my text i want to read
[40:57] verse 29
[40:58] so forgive me proverbs 31 29
[41:01] it says many daughters have done
[41:03] virtuously
[41:05] but thou excellest them all
[41:08] so there's where we see how this
[41:10] proverbs 31 woman this
[41:12] bride that the the mother wanted for
[41:15] king solomon
[41:16] she was going to be excelling all of
[41:18] them no doubt the shulamite i think it
[41:20] speaks to the same one if i'm not
[41:21] mistaken
[41:24] she excels all of them as we are saying
[41:27] as remember what job
[41:28] the bible said that god looked and and
[41:30] he told the devil he said
[41:32] he said job is the most righteous man of
[41:34] all of them
[41:36] so that means god has an order right god
[41:37] knows who
[41:39] has the most effort who's in other words
[41:41] who's yielding the most to grace
[41:43] because paul said he labored more than
[41:45] all when he said it wasn't me it was
[41:46] grace
[41:47] so it was paul's will that was yielded
[41:50] over to
[41:52] paul was able to yield more of his time
[41:55] more efforts to god's grace
[41:59] and remember grace is not spirit
[42:02] the bible said we must not we must obey
[42:04] the spirit of grace
[42:06] right those that crucify christ do
[42:09] despite the spirit of grace
[42:11] so we know the spirit of grace is the
[42:13] holy spirit amen
[42:14] hallelujah so paul said i i yield more
[42:18] to the holy spirit in other words paul
[42:19] walked more in the spirit than other
[42:21] brothers amen
[42:23] and god knew job did the same job walked
[42:26] in the spirit more than others and he
[42:28] walked the most in the spirit as a
[42:30] righteous man
[42:31] so church i don't know i don't want to
[42:33] be the lowest one walk in the spirit but
[42:35] i want to be up there some
[42:36] someplace kind of high i don't want to
[42:38] be a disgrace to my lord i don't want to
[42:39] disappoint my lord
[42:41] but i want to remember that the he
[42:42] that's forgiven much loveth much i want
[42:44] to remember how much i'm forgiven
[42:46] so i'll love god more and i'll surrender

[46:05] god
[46:07] she should never leave it now this woman
[46:09] is the culmination of the book of
[46:11] proverbs remember chapter one
[46:12] the bible said lady wisdom was walking
[46:16] through the streets crying out
[46:18] who will partake of my wisdom who will
[46:20] to partake of my wisdom
[46:22] and remember she said she'd pour out her
[46:24] wisdom on anyone
[46:26] who listened to her right that was
[46:29] proverbs 1
[46:30] verses 20 21 22 23
[46:33] and here in the final chapter you see
[46:37] you find the woman who
[46:38] listened to that original woman you find
[46:40] the young maiden who's going to marry
[46:42] solomon here
[46:43] must be the shoot of mine she heard that
[46:47] lady wisdom and she became wisdom praise
[46:50] god
[46:51] right the wisdom became embodied in a
[46:54] flesh body praise god
[46:56] the word became flesh that's what you
[46:58] and i are
[46:59] the word made flesh praise god not maybe
[47:02] our bodies but our souls
[47:04] our soul is the holy spirit right it's
[47:06] god's nature
[47:07] and that nature came out of god it's a
[47:10] part of god amen
[47:11] it's a part of the god and god is the
[47:13] word amen and the word as we obey it
[47:16] our flesh obeys the word of god and then
[47:19] we become
[47:20] the word and flesh praise god we're in
[47:22] other words we're manifesting god's
[47:24] promises for this day amen
[47:26] that's what that woman did back there my
[47:28] the most holy of all women
[47:30] the most valuable of all women that
[47:31] proverbs 31 woman
[47:33] she became all the wisdom she heard
[47:35] about
[47:36] oh may god help us help our little ones
[47:38] to do that praise god
[47:39] that everything they hear it'll just be
[47:42] written upon the tables of their heart
[47:44] and they'll grow up and they'll be a
[47:45] generation but maybe by god's grace
[47:47] that exceed our wisdom amen that exceed
[47:50] our understanding
[47:52] oh my hallelujah church i we can look
[47:55] back at it now we can look at
[47:56] all the message people that have gone on
[47:58] to be with the lord bless their hearts
[48:00] but we can see that our revelation has
[48:02] exceeded theirs
[48:04] i can see it at least the ones that i've
[48:05] known they all knew god sent a prophet
[48:08] they had healings and things but we've
[48:10] got a better understanding of the
[48:12] message
[48:13] right we don't compromise like maybe
[48:15] some of them did
[48:17] right we don't backslide like some of
[48:19] them did
[48:20] right we don't we don't put it off for
[48:22] another day we want to be the joshua
[48:24] joshua generation that takes all the
[48:27] promises amen
[48:28] right they knew the prophet we don't
[48:30] know the prophet right but we want to be
[48:32] the generation that takes the word of
[48:34] god
[48:34] and takes all possession of everything
[48:37] god wants us to have amen
[48:39] oh yes hallelujah
[48:43] like they didn't know what was the seals
[48:45] about what was this about you know they
[48:46] they kind of stumble on all these
[48:47] doctrines
[48:49] oh maybe the church ages ended and maybe
[48:51] the maybe the lamb's not on the mercy
[48:53] seat anymore
[48:54] maybe 1977 really did end it spiritually
[48:57] and so
[48:57] you know we're in the millennium now
[48:59] there's people that believe that
[49:01] there's really people that believe that
[49:03] yet they might have known brother
[49:04] branham or they might have seen the
[49:05] prayer line or they might have been in a
[49:07] meeting
[49:07] but they they never really crossed over
[49:09] here to the promises of god
[49:12] to possess every promise of god church
[49:14] may god help us to possess all those
[49:16] promises of god's faith
[49:17] god's virtue jesus's knowledge jesus
[49:20] temperance
[49:21] his patience his godliness his brother
[49:23] kindness and his charity
[49:25] amen and that all the gifts of the holy
[49:28] spirit
[49:28] will flow through our church how many
[49:30] believing for that i'm believing for
[49:32] that praise god i heard simon say they
[49:33] don't have them all operating
[49:35] nor do we but we got quite a few of them
[49:37] praise god is we went through the
[49:38] testimonies a few months ago
[49:40] you started naming those off you know we
[49:42] you see many of those operating which is
[49:44] a blessing praise god
[49:46] but they're all operated at god's will
[49:48] praise god
[49:49] now we have to pray for them and we have
[49:51] to do our part
[49:52] and we we've got to pray more for that
[49:54] we got to believe for the supernatural
[49:56] right
[49:56] we got to build up our most holy faith
[49:59] praying in the holy spirit praise god
[50:01] and then god will manifest more and more
[50:03] through those gifts
[50:04] but where other people have died and
[50:06] said there was no gifts anymore
[50:08] we don't need the gifts all i know is
[50:10] that we need more of the holy ghost
[50:12] amen and i know that means more gifts
[50:14] praise god
[50:15] hallelujah like i was preaching there on
[50:18] sunday morning
[50:19] it was the strangest one of the
[50:21] strangest sermons i ever preached uh you
[50:23] remember when i preached on the day
[50:24] stars risen in our hearts for easter a
[50:25] couple years ago
[50:26] well i was going to preach on god's
[50:28] receipt but i couldn't print them off i
[50:30] didn't have
[50:31] access to the printer and it was easter
[50:33] and it was too late
[50:34] you know i'm sorry i just preached that
[50:36] little thought and i just
[50:37] took a few thoughts and i preached i
[50:39] thought this is really strange and you
[50:40] know the people were kind of into it you
[50:42] know
[50:43] uh you know called the prayer line a
[50:45] couple people come up for prayer
[50:47] well in between services i'm in the
[50:49] office and we get a call and a brother
[50:50] says he live-streamed the sermon he said
[50:52] that sermon was completely
[50:54] for me he said i had an evil spirit on
[50:56] me he said all this darkness was on me
[50:58] he said while you were preaching the
[51:00] demons left me i repented of my sins i
[51:02] was weeping crying i got on my knees
[51:04] live streaming and then i went and
[51:06] called two or three people
[51:08] uh to make right all these complexes
[51:10] that i had because i preached on the
[51:11] darkness
[51:12] when light comes in the darkness has to
[51:14] flee
[51:15] and it happens like that light is the
[51:18] fastest thing known to man
[51:19] praise god right so the word of god the
[51:22] effects of the word of god
[51:23] is faster than anything else amen and
[51:26] when it shines in our hearts it ought to
[51:28] drive away
[51:30] uh any darkness you know a couple of
[51:32] people come up for prayer said it was
[51:34] for them but
[51:34] it was really nice to hear somebody that
[51:36] it was directly for them praise god
[51:39] and directly right to their situation
[51:41] the complexes they build up and
[51:43] uh really wonderful to hear that and the
[51:44] spirit kind of drove off
[51:47] evil spirits off this individual that's
[51:50] always a great blessing
[51:52] now you remember uh getting back to the
[51:53] prophetic one woman
[51:55] starting at verse 10 every verse starts
[51:59] with
[51:59] uh the first or the letter of the
[52:02] alphabet
[52:03] that's called an acrostic poem in hebrew
[52:06] so uh so the first letter uh i believe
[52:10] it was called
[52:10] aleph is what starts that the word who
[52:14] must be start with the first letter of
[52:16] the hebrew alphabet aleph and then the
[52:18] last verse verse 31
[52:19] ends with the last hebrew letter tav so
[52:22] a left and then tav and so this shows
[52:28] the whole alphabet sums up
[52:31] the proverbs 31 woman she's completely
[52:33] wise
[52:34] she's completely
[52:37] godly right and it reminds us of jesus
[52:40] uh because jesus is called the alpha and
[52:42] omega
[52:43] he's the first and last letter of the
[52:45] greek alphabet
[52:47] so this woman is the hebrew alphabet
[52:49] right but this christ here he's the
[52:51] first
[52:52] and last of the greek alphabet we know
[52:54] it means the same thing alphabet right
[52:56] your language or any formation of the
[52:59] word
[53:00] hallelujah he's all of it praise god he
[53:02] he's from the beginning to the end
[53:04] amen and that's how this woman is she's
[53:06] from beginning to the end she's all of
[53:08] it
[53:08] in other words she has believed every
[53:10] word she's lived every word
[53:12] she's accepted every word amen you see
[53:14] her you see her
[53:16] uh throughout the whole language praise
[53:18] god you see her in everything beautiful
[53:20] right
[53:20] you see her at every every kind word
[53:23] every
[53:23] every good thought she's in all of that
[53:25] in other words god's
[53:27] plan is all about saving that woman amen
[53:29] his whole plan
[53:30] is to redeem his bride and bring her
[53:32] back to the garden of eden amen
[53:35] hallelujah give his son a bride jesus
[53:38] needs a bride and that's who he's
[53:40] redeeming today by god's grace
[53:43] from every age remember she's all
[53:45] beautiful head to toe according to
[53:47] solomon right
[53:49] and uh jesus jesus's bride will live
[53:52] all the word that's prophesied about her
[53:54] from the first prophecy
[53:56] to the last right so her entire being
[54:00] the bible says
[54:02] also speaking of her body the bible said
[54:04] jesus is going to preserve
[54:06] us blameless unto the day of the lord
[54:08] jesus christ her whole body
[54:11] spirit and soul is preserved blameless
[54:14] amen
[54:15] god's going to take care of every part
[54:16] of us amen aren't you glad he heals your
[54:18] body amen
[54:19] aren't you glad he delivers you from
[54:20] mind battles in your mind aren't you
[54:22] glad he seals your soul with his holy
[54:24] spirit amen
[54:25] see he's he's he's got a hedge about
[54:27] your whole being praise god
[54:29] all of it from the a to z to it amen
[54:33] remember this woman is a woman of
[54:35] prophecy right
[54:36] because in verse 1 of proverbs 31 verse
[54:39] 1 the words of king lemuel
[54:41] the prophecy that his mother taught him
[54:43] this was a prophecy
[54:45] hallelujah this is a prophetic woman
[54:47] amen
[54:48] she was ordained to come church you were
[54:51] ordained for this age brother
[54:52] said there you couldn't come in any
[54:54] other age god placed you in this
[54:56] age amen god didn't want you in the old
[54:59] testament so
[55:00] we shouldn't uh be jealous of them right
[55:03] god didn't want you here on earth when
[55:04] jesus was here although we don't
[55:06] it's hard not to be jealous of them the
[55:08] things they got to see
[55:10] but god didn't want us here when brother
[55:11] branham was here god wanted us here at
[55:13] the end time amen
[55:15] so we had a special place a special
[55:17] position
[55:18] that we've got to fulfill just like this
[55:21] woman she's a woman of prophecy
[55:24] praise god and so see
[55:27] this proverbs 31 woman it's a prophecy
[55:31] that she's going to fulfill all the word
[55:33] of god and that's a
[55:35] prophecy of the bride of jesus she's
[55:37] going to fulfill
[55:38] and have total obedience to all the word
[55:41] of god she's going to keep all the
[55:43] commands of god amen
[55:46] now proverbs 31 traces the path of
[55:48] wisdom it goes from mother
[55:50] to child then child
[55:53] i'm sorry from mother to child then
[55:55] child uh
[55:57] to spouse and then to children right and
[56:00] then the community
[56:03] so that's the path that travels right
[56:05] mother the child
[56:06] the child raises up the king he married
[56:08] godly wife right
[56:10] and this godly uh wife is gonna train
[56:12] their children
[56:13] she's gonna impact the community and of
[56:15] course the king is going to impact the
[56:16] community
[56:18] amen church you never know like brother
[56:20] said you'll never know how many souls
[56:22] you impact till we make it over there
[56:24] somebody at the store like i had
[56:25] somebody literally remember when you got
[56:26] your uh
[56:27] debit card remember that woman uh
[56:31] she's like you know what this took like
[56:32] an hour to get lydia debit card like
[56:34] can't they do this any faster you know
[56:36] uh but she's like you know in the middle
[56:38] of it she just stopped she said you know
[56:39] you were a man she said a giant eagle a
[56:41] few years ago you were in a suit on a
[56:43] sunday
[56:44] she said i had a flat tire it was so
[56:45] cold i couldn't get it to pump she said
[56:47] you just stopped your big van
[56:49] she said you got out of your van and
[56:51] said you need help pumping that tire
[56:54] and i s and she said yeah she said you
[56:56] come over mr smith and pumped it for me
[56:58] and just left with a smile and said god
[57:00] bless you
[57:00] she said i want to thank you for that i
[57:02] never got a chance to thank you for i'm
[57:03] like i don't even remember doing that
[57:05] but everything matches the description
[57:07] sunday
[57:08] big van suit and tie glasses she said my
[57:12] hair and everything like that
[57:14] and here it is years later and she still
[57:18] remembers now she remembers
[57:19] what about god amen and that's just a
[57:22] natural
[57:23] uh that's just a natural act what about
[57:25] the things you do in secret that god
[57:27] always sees amen
[57:29] right i do that openly in public i got
[57:31] probably got my reward for that that's
[57:32] fine
[57:33] you know maybe maybe my reward is just
[57:35] lydia seeing you know her dad
[57:36] does nice things you know and i should
[57:38] do nice things too but
[57:40] you know god has greater rewards that's
[57:42] in your private prayer
[57:43] your prayer private giving amen you're
[57:46] whispering prayers to god all by
[57:48] yourself
[57:49] those things you do in secret god sees
[57:51] that and he's going to reward you richly
[57:53] praise god
[57:55] amen
[57:58] so see church we should impact the
[58:00] community and i guess our little humble
[58:02] ways
[58:03] never skip church though if you're gonna
[58:04] do that don't never skip church wait
[58:06] till after church
[58:07] then you can do some good acts for the
[58:08] community some volunteering for the
[58:11] community
[58:12] like i told you i take some of my ties
[58:13] and i send them to some food shelters
[58:15] you know
[58:16] because i don't really have time to go
[58:17] there i'd like to
[58:20] but when am i going to do that i guess i
[58:22] could do in the summer but
[58:24] i just got it's easier for me just to
[58:25] send the cash you're going to send the
[58:27] electronic cash
[58:29] you know you want to do good the
[58:30] community you know sometimes i'll pick
[58:31] up trash out here you know by the
[58:32] road just to kind of make our church
[58:34] look a little nicer
[58:36] little things like that but
[58:39] uh here we see how it travels it's got
[58:42] to start with the godly mother
[58:44] aren't you glad for your godly moms or
[58:46] any godly wisdom they gave you or godly
[58:47] fathers
[58:48] it's got to start there with the parents
[58:50] right and then it comes out of the child
[58:53] the child grows up
[58:54] with a marriage and then their their
[58:56] marriage impacts
[58:57] but a king especially impacts the whole
[59:01] nation and that's what that's why this
[59:03] was so important
[59:04] uh the mother was trying to get the king
[59:06] to see this is the kind of woman you got
[59:08] to choose
[59:09] you got to choose a godly woman right
[59:11] you got to choose
[59:12] a virtuous woman the bible said virtuous
[59:17] now that don't mean because he virtuous
[59:18] that don't mean she's popular it's
[59:20] probably the opposite
[59:21] she's not popular it don't mean she's
[59:23] rich remember the shulamite
[59:25] he found her out there shepherding and
[59:26] she was all you know sunburned by the
[59:28] skin
[59:29] or sun sunburned by the sun rather her
[59:32] skin was sunburned
[59:34] just you know being the virtuous doesn't
[59:36] mean you're the most popular
[59:37] or even the prettiest right to compare
[59:39] to worldly standards right
[59:41] by telling god's eyes you're beautiful
[59:43] praise god amen when modesty and
[59:45] holiness and
[59:46] and like brother man says you women that
[59:48] are godly you girls that are godly
[59:49] because of your purity he said you got
[59:52] something you have something on your
[59:53] face
[59:53] those worldly women can never have
[59:56] that countenance of the holy spirit
[59:58] right remember cain got the bad
[1:00:00] countenance when he left the friends of
[1:00:01] the lord you see most of these women out
[1:00:03] there that got an evil countenance
[1:00:05] but when you got the holy spirit in your
[1:00:06] life you've got a godly countless nobody
[1:00:08] can take it from you
[1:00:09] amen it's a beautiful countenance amen
[1:00:12] i'm gonna do it on time i keep
[1:00:13] forgetting
[1:00:14] i didn't set my timer
[1:00:19] going kind of slow but i guess that's
[1:00:20] okay i could go another week on this
[1:00:23] see he said she especially tells the the
[1:00:27] son to choose a godly wife a virtuous
[1:00:30] wife because he's going to influence the
[1:00:33] entire
[1:00:33] kingdom right like with the story of
[1:00:36] esther that's why
[1:00:37] you know that's why esther became queen
[1:00:39] was because bashi had to be put away
[1:00:40] because she was going to impact the
[1:00:42] whole kingdom right
[1:00:44] now our girls are never probably not
[1:00:46] going to grow up and be the wife of the
[1:00:48] president or the president
[1:00:50] the way things go now you wouldn't want
[1:00:52] to fulfill that prophecy
[1:00:57] you know you may not have some great you
[1:01:00] know place in society
[1:01:02] but you will impact your home
[1:01:05] and that's really what god wants you to
[1:01:07] do and ask can i say like this your
[1:01:09] church
[1:01:11] right think of our little sisters all
[1:01:14] looking up to our adult
[1:01:15] sisters right they see the ones that are
[1:01:18] really faithful they see the ones how
[1:01:19] they worship you know they see the ones
[1:01:20] that maybe don't
[1:01:22] you know ones that are on fire the ones
[1:01:24] that are backslidden they see that
[1:01:26] your life's speaking to them praise god
[1:01:27] amen you're living the life before them
[1:01:30] praise god they see jesus christ
[1:01:33] when they need a little help who they
[1:01:34] run to the mama
[1:01:36] dad's probably to do too much for him
[1:01:38] but the sisters could have a great
[1:01:39] impact
[1:01:41] on the children now remember church now
[1:01:44] this is a type because
[1:01:46] the bible says we're kings and priests
[1:01:47] unto god
[1:01:49] so this king has to make a big decision
[1:01:51] so does our spiritual kings and queens
[1:01:54] and thank god in america you sisters
[1:01:55] thank god our sisters ought to give god
[1:01:57] praise that you have a choice who you
[1:01:58] marry
[1:02:00] right some nations they don't have a
[1:02:02] choice
[1:02:03] you ought to thank god for that you have
[1:02:04] a choice and so it's your duty also to
[1:02:06] pray and make sure that's the right guy
[1:02:09] we know numerous people that i'm sure
[1:02:11] they wish they would have prayed more
[1:02:13] of course i'm looking at lydia moore
[1:02:14] she's getting older
[1:02:17] really looking at lydia make sure you
[1:02:18] pray i'll be praying with you that's for
[1:02:19] sure
[1:02:20] i'll be saying lydia let's come up to
[1:02:21] the altar here
[1:02:24] you better make sure because you have a
[1:02:26] uh you're both
[1:02:27] responsible in this case not just the
[1:02:29] dad and the you know the husband
[1:02:31] but the sister has a choice in this too
[1:02:34] and then the bible says remember you
[1:02:35] reign in life by one jesus christ amen
[1:02:39] the only way you're going to rule over
[1:02:40] sin is by being connected to christ
[1:02:43] being under the anointing of the holy
[1:02:44] spirit amen
[1:02:46] you're a kingdom priest but you only
[1:02:47] reign over these things
[1:02:49] when you're under the anointing under
[1:02:51] the leadership of the holy spirit when
[1:02:53] you're walking in the holy spirit when
[1:02:55] you walk in the flesh you're not under
[1:02:56] his leadership
[1:02:57] but when you walk in the holy spirit
[1:02:59] you're led by the holy spirit
[1:03:01] then you reign in this life then and
[1:03:03] you're like a commander praise god
[1:03:05] you're like a joshua
[1:03:06] you're like a general you're in control
[1:03:09] how many believe you're in control by
[1:03:11] the holy spirit
[1:03:12] amen the bible said under the holy
[1:03:15] spirit he said you're
[1:03:16] a master of every circumstance remember
[1:03:17] that
[1:03:19] he said when you're obedient to faith
[1:03:21] when you're walking in faith and under
[1:03:22] the holy spirit
[1:03:24] you're a master of every circumstance
[1:03:27] someone tries to deceive you someone
[1:03:29] tries to trick you
[1:03:31] you just wait there till the holy spirit
[1:03:32] gives you the right answer so you can
[1:03:34] kind of discern the situation
[1:03:36] you're not easily deceived right you're
[1:03:38] not easily tricked
[1:03:39] you don't just go around with the crowd
[1:03:41] right you just don't go along with the
[1:03:42] joke or
[1:03:43] you don't go along with the teasing
[1:03:45] right you don't go along with that
[1:03:46] because you're walking under the holy
[1:03:48] spirit you only want to say
[1:03:49] what father wants you to say amen you've
[1:03:52] got the mind of christ and jesus said i
[1:03:53] don't say anything
[1:03:55] except the father shows me first that's
[1:03:57] the mind of christ
[1:03:59] hallelujah so we reign in life
[1:04:03] this life by jesus christ
[1:04:08] see she's highly valued and she's
[1:04:10] praised because she's got two attributes
[1:04:12] she fears the lord and does good to her
[1:04:15] husband
[1:04:16] all the days of our life i'm gonna read
[1:04:17] this our closest relationships reveal
[1:04:20] our true spiritual conditions
[1:04:24] everyone knew this woman feared god her
[1:04:26] heavenly head
[1:04:28] because of the attitude and actions
[1:04:30] towards
[1:04:31] her earthly head her husband how did
[1:04:33] they know this woman was more virtuous
[1:04:35] because of how she treated her husband
[1:04:38] right christians who have spiritual
[1:04:41] treasure in their hearts or knowledge of
[1:04:42] jesus christ
[1:04:44] will also have the treasure of loving
[1:04:46] relationships in their home
[1:04:48] can you paul proverbs 15 verse 6
[1:04:51] proverbs 15 verse 6 6 says in the house
[1:04:54] of the righteous
[1:04:55] is much treasure that's what the chapter
[1:04:57] i'm writing now right
[1:04:59] in this next family book here i'm
[1:05:00] writing chapter one's called family
[1:05:02] treasures
[1:05:03] i might name the book that too so see
[1:05:08] this is what the woman this is this is
[1:05:10] her main duty in life
[1:05:12] is to have such spiritual connection to
[1:05:14] christ that
[1:05:15] her she gathers so much treasure inside
[1:05:18] of her house
[1:05:20] right and we know the treasure though
[1:05:24] has to start
[1:05:25] in your heart because jesus said the
[1:05:27] good man from the good treasure of his
[1:05:30] heart
[1:05:30] speaks good words i remember that
[1:05:32] scripture the evil man from the evil
[1:05:35] treasure of his heart
[1:05:36] speaks evil words and he says every idle
[1:05:38] word will be given account of on the day
[1:05:40] of judgment
[1:05:41] in other words either got a evil
[1:05:42] storehouse or a good sore house
[1:05:45] oh thank god for a good storehouse when
[1:05:47] you've got good storehouse you speak
[1:05:49] good things
[1:05:50] amen you're not gonna tease your brother
[1:05:53] sister right
[1:05:54] you're not gonna curse somebody right
[1:05:56] you're not gonna say evil things
[1:05:58] when you've got good treasure in your
[1:06:00] heart good things come out of your mouth
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:02] treasure something valuable amen
[1:06:05] something valuable comes out of our
[1:06:06] mouth amen
[1:06:08] we've got good treasure we're going to
[1:06:10] speak good words right
[1:06:12] so see the treasures can't get built up
[1:06:14] in the house until they get
[1:06:16] built up in our hearts and then come out
[1:06:17] of our mouths
[1:06:23] right like we were kind of laughing
[1:06:24] yesterday we were at the store at the
[1:06:25] grocery store
[1:06:27] uh genevieve looked over she was sitting
[1:06:29] in the car at aldi she looked over and
[1:06:31] said oh daddy get some flowers so pretty
[1:06:34] for mommy
[1:06:35] and so we got her some flowers and that
[1:06:37] was all her idea
[1:06:39] you know i thought well look at that
[1:06:40] there's a little treasure now those
[1:06:41] little flowers sit on the table
[1:06:43] and that little vase there that's a
[1:06:44] little treasure and where to start from
[1:06:46] genevieve's heart
[1:06:48] she saw the flowers thought of mommy
[1:06:50] spoke the word
[1:06:52] and then when he got home my wife was
[1:06:54] pretty happy about that
[1:06:57] that's just a simple example right just
[1:06:59] a real primitive example
[1:07:01] it started from the heart right and what
[1:07:03] you see goes down in your mind and
[1:07:05] it's got to start and then it creates a
[1:07:07] good treasure in the heart
[1:07:08] well our family should be complimenting
[1:07:10] one another in the home
[1:07:12] we should be building people up in the
[1:07:13] home not tearing down
[1:07:16] right now we can go to somebody tear
[1:07:18] somebody down we can get a treasure out
[1:07:19] of that
[1:07:19] by having them repent that's a treasure
[1:07:23] right and sometimes that rod or that
[1:07:24] wooden spoon
[1:07:26] that'll bring some treasure praise god
[1:07:29] right
[1:07:30] that'll bring treasure the treasure of
[1:07:32] repentance
[1:07:33] amen or i'll say this treasure of the
[1:07:36] fear of god i just found this scripture
[1:07:38] yesterday
[1:07:38] you pulled up isaiah 33 i thought you
[1:07:40] liked this one proverbs 33 6. i think
[1:07:42] you're gonna like this one
[1:07:44] i'm sorry isaiah 33 6. i'm sorry isaiah
[1:07:47] 33 6. sorry
[1:07:48] just kind of in a fast uh nervous mode i
[1:07:50] kind of want to get done
[1:07:51] i don't think i'm going to get done here
[1:07:54] well i might we'll see
[1:07:56] isaiah 33 6. look at this beautiful
[1:07:59] scripture i've never seen this one
[1:08:00] well i mean i read it numerous times
[1:08:01] i've never seen it like this and wisdom
[1:08:04] and knowledge what's proverbs about
[1:08:05] wisdom
[1:08:06] shall be the stability of thy times
[1:08:10] and strength of salvation the fear of
[1:08:12] the lord is his treasure now keep that
[1:08:14] up there
[1:08:15] see this coveted stuff is such they're
[1:08:18] so they're so
[1:08:19] unstable right one day they say this
[1:08:21] next day they do this
[1:08:23] there's so much instability but if we
[1:08:25] have the wisdom of god
[1:08:27] we're stable during this time in other
[1:08:29] words we can't be moved
[1:08:30] the devil can't shake us and make us
[1:08:32] doubt or fear we know exactly where we
[1:08:34] stand
[1:08:35] we're not worried about this kingdom
[1:08:37] we're worried about the kingdom of god
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:39] right see you're you'll be stable in
[1:08:43] your generation in your times
[1:08:46] and have strength of salvation and like
[1:08:49] this what's your treasure
[1:08:50] the fear of the lord is your treasure
[1:08:52] amen how did this proverbs 31 woman
[1:08:55] get so much treasure in everything she
[1:08:57] did she
[1:08:58] feared the lord amen and if you fear god
[1:09:01] you'll fear his people right if you fear
[1:09:04] god you respect your brother you respect
[1:09:07] your sister you respect your mom
[1:09:09] you respect your dad you won't say
[1:09:10] anything evil you respect the pastor
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:12] you respect the ministers you respect
[1:09:14] your brother your sister
[1:09:16] if you fear god you'll love and respect
[1:09:18] you'll be careful how you act
[1:09:20] and the bible said that's a real
[1:09:22] treasure it's also the beginning of
[1:09:24] wisdom
[1:09:24] so wisdom must be a treasure as well
[1:09:28] what did this proverbs woman have she
[1:09:30] feared the lord and she loved her
[1:09:32] husband
[1:09:33] right she was good to her husband all
[1:09:34] the days of her life that's the bride
[1:09:37] she fears the lord and she's good to
[1:09:38] jesus
[1:09:40] amen he's real good to jesus amen
[1:09:42] because jesus lives inside of her soul
[1:09:44] praise god
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:49] so see jesus wants us to treasure our
[1:09:51] relationships
[1:09:53] not really our financial gains right
[1:09:55] because the real treasure is a spiritual
[1:09:57] treasure
[1:09:58] the fear of the lord the respect that
[1:10:00] actually the word actually means terror
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:03] but we know that's different from the
[1:10:05] spirit of fear
[1:10:07] right there's a healthy fear we know
[1:10:10] right we
[1:10:10] we want that healthy fear right
[1:10:13] when the when the devil says go ahead
[1:10:15] and steal that go ahead and steal that
[1:10:17] but you've got to fear oh i don't want
[1:10:18] to get caught and
[1:10:20] i i wouldn't want to displease god
[1:10:22] that's a healthy fear
[1:10:24] right i don't want to go to jail that's
[1:10:26] a healthy fear
[1:10:28] you want that i know god would very be
[1:10:30] very displeased if this happened
[1:10:32] that's that's what you want you want to
[1:10:33] fear god that way
[1:10:35] but that's not the spirit of fear right
[1:10:37] the spirit of fear actually it causes
[1:10:39] you to accuse god
[1:10:41] because remember that remember the the
[1:10:42] men with the three talents the three
[1:10:44] sets of talents
[1:10:46] that one guy who had the one the bible
[1:10:49] said
[1:10:49] he buried his talent and then he feared
[1:10:52] god
[1:10:53] so he said well you know god's not fair
[1:10:55] he reaps where he doesn't sow and he's
[1:10:58] not
[1:10:58] just and he feared god that's why he hid
[1:11:01] it so see we don't have that spirit of
[1:11:04] fear we don't hide ourselves from the
[1:11:05] father
[1:11:06] we run to the father amen we don't we
[1:11:08] don't we don't take our problems
[1:11:10] somewhere else you know to a a witch
[1:11:13] doctor or something like that or
[1:11:14] or a woman who can read our poems we
[1:11:16] raise our palms to god amen
[1:11:19] we sacrifice and give worship and praise
[1:11:22] and we run to our heavenly father
[1:11:25] and of course we fear him with godly
[1:11:28] fear
[1:11:29] we know he can take our lives like this
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:33] and every now and then we get a reminder
[1:11:34] someone close to us will die
[1:11:36] and we get a reminder ah better fear
[1:11:38] lord i better
[1:11:40] i i better make sure i live my life to
[1:11:43] the fullest
[1:11:44] right every time we've had a funeral you
[1:11:46] know or someone someone we know passes
[1:11:48] away
[1:11:48] or just accidents like we had a few
[1:11:50] years ago i remember we prayed for that
[1:11:51] family
[1:11:52] you just it just shakes you up a little
[1:11:54] bit and it brings that fear of the lord
[1:11:56] like god has my number right
[1:11:58] he's going to pull it one of these days
[1:11:59] and i better be ready to meet the lord
[1:12:01] that's a healthy fear we want that fear
[1:12:04] that's a i say like that that's a loving
[1:12:05] fear that's a there's a loving fear
[1:12:09] now let me move on here
[1:12:14] now a holy ghost-filled bride member
[1:12:16] will manifest
[1:12:18] her love for christ through everyday
[1:12:20] actions blessing those in her home
[1:12:23] church and community now to me church of
[1:12:27] all the people i've seen fall away from
[1:12:28] the message
[1:12:30] to me the real holy ghost-filled saints
[1:12:32] are the ones who can live it in their
[1:12:33] homes
[1:12:35] right because that's always where they
[1:12:36] compromise whether it's a tv
[1:12:39] wearing pants uh adultery
[1:12:42] on their phones you know prostitution
[1:12:45] i mean that's it always starts there in
[1:12:48] their house but look at the proverbs 31
[1:12:51] woman
[1:12:51] she's faithful all the time bless those
[1:12:54] moms
[1:12:55] they're up all night and they're the
[1:12:57] first ones to get the crying sick child
[1:12:59] you know
[1:13:00] that's what the bible says she's she's
[1:13:02] up all she's got her candle ready to go
[1:13:04] help out one of the kids
[1:13:05] while dad gets to sleep and you know
[1:13:08] lazy dad sometimes
[1:13:10] god have mercy on us but look at this
[1:13:13] she's she's ready at all times
[1:13:15] her love for god is proven through how
[1:13:18] she treats those in her family
[1:13:20] it starts there and this proverbs 31
[1:13:24] shows
[1:13:24] shows her through all the seasons of her
[1:13:27] life right
[1:13:28] the newlywed the mother to the empty
[1:13:30] nest no doubt grandmother too
[1:13:33] i forgot that one i should have wrote
[1:13:34] that in the book but that's okay
[1:13:38] because remember the bible said to
[1:13:39] everything there's a season
[1:13:41] a time to every purpose under heaven
[1:13:44] amen her highest priority is her home
[1:13:49] life that should be our highest priority
[1:13:51] right our natural homes and then our
[1:13:53] home church our spiritual home
[1:13:56] i believe that her daily
[1:13:59] interactions prove she's a chaste virgin
[1:14:01] to christ
[1:14:03] because it also shapes the spiritual
[1:14:05] condition of the next generation
[1:14:09] see it's so important she loves her
[1:14:11] husband and she takes care of her
[1:14:13] their children who are going to be the
[1:14:15] next generation of believers
[1:14:19] right so here here's what she does in
[1:14:22] her house
[1:14:22] she's totally trustworthy with her
[1:14:25] husband and the family resources
[1:14:28] she won't lie she's trustworthy she
[1:14:31] takes
[1:14:31] initiative to work with her hands you
[1:14:33] have to you have to beg her to work
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:35] she's ready to do something with her
[1:14:36] hands and try to figure it out work it
[1:14:37] out with her hands
[1:14:39] she's ready to serve her family at all
[1:14:42] hours that's verse 15.
[1:14:44] yeah she rises also while it is at night
[1:14:46] and giveth meat to her household in a
[1:14:48] portion to her maidens
[1:14:49] she's ready at all hours to help
[1:14:52] everybody in the house
[1:14:53] she's shrewd in business so she's not
[1:14:55] wasteful she don't make silly
[1:14:56] transactions or investments
[1:14:58] she makes the right investments for the
[1:15:01] long-term care of her
[1:15:02] of her family she's healthy physically
[1:15:05] fit
[1:15:06] and she dresses in her best clothes
[1:15:07] that's versus 17 and 22.
[1:15:10] see that's why our sisters you know we
[1:15:11] can't let ourselves go right our
[1:15:13] brothers
[1:15:14] we can't let ourselves go that's how i
[1:15:16] was telling brother brooks i told him
[1:15:17] brother you're taking such good care of
[1:15:18] yourself he's all slim and trim he's 65
[1:15:20] years old i said brother you are an
[1:15:22] example
[1:15:23] because i've noticed people that don't
[1:15:25] care of themselves they don't care for
[1:15:27] their spiritual lives either
[1:15:29] right because this is a temple if you're
[1:15:31] not taking care of this temple
[1:15:32] how are you going to take care of this
[1:15:33] temple you're not like eli
[1:15:36] eli and his sons they didn't take care
[1:15:38] of their own temples so they didn't take
[1:15:40] care of the temple of god
[1:15:41] they let the fire of god go out and let
[1:15:43] the light of god go out
[1:15:45] we got to let our light shine amen we
[1:15:48] got to care about our life we got to
[1:15:50] care about our bodies we got to care
[1:15:52] about our temples we got to take care of
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:54] it's a reflection of our attitude toward
[1:15:56] god's house
[1:15:58] right doesn't remember jesus said in the
[1:16:01] days of noah they were drunken
[1:16:03] right uh what's the other word
[1:16:05] drunkenness and there's other ones uh
[1:16:07] i can't think of it right now surf
[1:16:10] surfing yeah surfing sir fighting
[1:16:12] which is kind of like uh eating too much
[1:16:14] i think
[1:16:16] so jesus said that's how it's gonna be
[1:16:17] like the days of noah the day's a lot
[1:16:21] that's a it's a perfect example they're
[1:16:23] more concerned about the natural food
[1:16:24] than the spiritual food oh my that's why
[1:16:27] church we gotta fast
[1:16:29] we gotta get in the spiritual feast
[1:16:30] right we've gotta have a spiritual feast
[1:16:32] with the lord well
[1:16:34] we have too many natural feasts right
[1:16:36] especially in america we got to have
[1:16:37] spiritual feasts we have to know
[1:16:39] what jesus said that we might we have to
[1:16:41] know that feeling i want to live by
[1:16:43] every word
[1:16:45] i want to be the bread every word is
[1:16:47] like the bread that's my daily bread
[1:16:49] is the word of god amen hallelujah
[1:16:56] this is the kind of woman that is more
[1:16:59] virtuous than all the others
[1:17:03] she's ready to respond to help the poor
[1:17:05] that's verse 20.
[1:17:07] she's a shrewd planner now boy that i
[1:17:10] really feel there
[1:17:11] this woman really plans things out and
[1:17:12] she's alert
[1:17:14] not much of a planner verse 25 she said
[1:17:18] she's anointed with god's strength hey
[1:17:20] man let me read that
[1:17:22] strength and honor are her clothing
[1:17:26] glory she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:17:28] look she's always putting off
[1:17:29] celebrations for the future for herself
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:32] for herself oh you don't need to do that
[1:17:35] for my birthday honey
[1:17:37] no i'm not saying you have to do that
[1:17:38] it's nice to feel appreciated
[1:17:41] but you know the bible said she just
[1:17:44] shall celebrate and things to come right
[1:17:46] celebrating things that come but now
[1:17:50] remember church there is a
[1:17:51] there is a rejoicing to do at special
[1:17:53] events remember when the prodigal came
[1:17:54] home
[1:17:55] if the father was crying what do you
[1:17:56] think the mother was doing
[1:17:58] right if dad was out there if dad was
[1:18:01] the first one out there and run to meet
[1:18:04] uh the prodigal and weeping and crying
[1:18:06] what do you think mama was doing mama
[1:18:07] birthed him
[1:18:08] mama fed him right mama mama held him
[1:18:11] there right there
[1:18:12] nursed him all that what do you think
[1:18:14] mom did mom was probably
[1:18:17] weeping and crying she's probably the
[1:18:18] second one well she's probably busy
[1:18:20] taking care of all the other kids
[1:18:23] she probably was busy right just like
[1:18:25] the 31 woman
[1:18:26] busy with her hands shrewd planning you
[1:18:28] know
[1:18:30] but i imagine she felt the same
[1:18:34] what was she close with not only her
[1:18:35] best clothes natural but her spiritual
[1:18:38] clothes
[1:18:38] strength
[1:18:42] so that means she could have been she
[1:18:44] could have been learning from joshua too
[1:18:46] because joshua said only be strong
[1:18:49] and courageous see our sisters see you
[1:18:51] can be strong like joshua just because
[1:18:52] you're not a brother that don't mean you
[1:18:54] can can't be strong you can be just as
[1:18:55] strong
[1:18:57] god's going to raise up sisters on that
[1:18:58] day too and they're going to condemn
[1:19:00] those that wouldn't they're going to
[1:19:02] raise up as judges right
[1:19:03] and the bible said the queen of the
[1:19:05] south shall condemn that generation
[1:19:08] because she traveled across the desert
[1:19:10] for the wisdom the wisdom there it is
[1:19:11] wisdom of solomon
[1:19:13] and a greater than solomon is here amen
[1:19:16] you know that you know that we're
[1:19:17] raising little judges these little
[1:19:19] female judges here
[1:19:20] spiritual judges that's right your lives
[1:19:23] will testify
[1:19:25] when others say well i couldn't do it i
[1:19:26] couldn't cross the desert i couldn't
[1:19:28] i couldn't dress holy it was too hot to
[1:19:30] dress holy guess who god's going to
[1:19:32] raise up
[1:19:33] this generation amen
[1:19:36] god's going to raise him up he said
[1:19:37] raise up lydia raise up haven raise up
[1:19:39] cares
[1:19:40] raise up nature raise up virtue gonna
[1:19:43] raise up and testify that the word of
[1:19:44] god was right
[1:19:48] you stand for god's word no matter what
[1:19:50] we stand for god's word
[1:19:54] and what's in her mouth kindness
[1:19:59] verse 31 26 she opened her mouth with
[1:20:03] wisdom see what we don't need is
[1:20:05] foolishness
[1:20:07] right if we're going to say something
[1:20:08] foolish may god help it just to be
[1:20:10] limited right
[1:20:11] let's limit our foolish talking
[1:20:15] let may god help us to open up our
[1:20:17] mouths with wisdom
[1:20:19] and in her her tongue is the law of
[1:20:22] kindness
[1:20:24] she's so kind we got some really kind
[1:20:27] girls here don't we
[1:20:28] that should be that's the law of it
[1:20:30] right that's the that's the rule always
[1:20:32] say something kind
[1:20:33] all right nothing good to say don't say
[1:20:35] anything at all
[1:20:38] this is one this woman is way way more
[1:20:41] pleasing to god than all the other ones
[1:20:44] see what kind of a life she lives her
[1:20:46] testimony just keeps raising higher
[1:20:48] people just think more and more this
[1:20:50] kind of woman i know our sisters are
[1:20:51] listening too because they got their
[1:20:52] they're writing their notes down and
[1:20:54] they've shown me their notes and
[1:20:56] their eyes are on me this is the kind of
[1:20:59] testimony that
[1:21:00] that you want to build you want to build
[1:21:01] this kind of memorial
[1:21:03] before the lord all these attributes
[1:21:08] see not only should every christian
[1:21:11] mother
[1:21:12] strive to be like this even christian
[1:21:14] husbands
[1:21:16] right they got to be part of the bride
[1:21:18] too right so then we have to have some
[1:21:20] of these similar attributes
[1:21:22] husbands should love their wives in a
[1:21:23] way
[1:21:26] uh that are sacrificial right
[1:21:29] husbands have to sacrifice some of their
[1:21:31] selfish desires
[1:21:33] for their wife and for their children
[1:21:36] they've got to do that
[1:21:40] to benefit their family
[1:21:44] right that's what the scripture says he
[1:21:46] ought to love his wife
[1:21:48] as himself
[1:21:52] let's close with this proverbs 31 verse
[1:21:53] 28
[1:21:55] after many long days
[1:21:59] after many long years i think of my mom
[1:22:06] after decades after many dirty diapers

[1:24:00] you know my mom had her 70th birthday
