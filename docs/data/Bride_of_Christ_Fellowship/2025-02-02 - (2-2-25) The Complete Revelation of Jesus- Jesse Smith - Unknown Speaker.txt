========================================

so notice God gave this Revelation to his son to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass so some of them did come to pass very shortly such as the first seal they came to pass very shortly after this and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God now that's important because that deals with the fif seal the word of God is the Old Testament so God gave John Witnesses from the Old Testament and and so and is a conjunction of course something else and of the testimony of Jesus Christ that's the New Testament so God gave John Visions to understand the Old Testament and tie the Old Testament and the New Testament together and of all things that he saw let's read verse three ready 1 two three blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated that's a separate sermon I want to preach sometime you know Paul Peter and John all kept saying the time is short the time is short the time is short and look we're at 2,000 years so he's not referring to uh time from our perspective he's referring to time from God's perspective Hallelujah because A Thousand Years is as one day now Casa if you would and let's try this just so I mean the whole purpose I want to preach on this was also to show some visuals here let's see if we can get the visuals okay great all now I'm not quite ready for that here but U maybe you all want to see my notes here but you're going to straighten your eyes so I wouldn't worry about the notes Here by God's grace unless you want to strain your ass today uh so I just want to um preach on this I've had this thought I found a chain of quotes from brother Brandon just like I found the chain on the radio Ministry of brother Orman Neville right brother Jose I found a chain of quotes on that put out a video this week it's just a beautiful chain of quotes what I mean by that is you see one thought from Brother Bram given by the Holy Spirit and it just goes year after year after year all the way down so it's a very wonderful um chain of scriptures here by God's grace so um we'll get to those quotes in a little bit um brother Ram says a couple things about the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and here we see God gave Jesus Christ a revelation Hallelujah to give to the people and it was the revelation of him and also Al of his will and his purpose for things to come Hallelujah so we see it by the grace of God now I want to just uh briefly review you know especially our young Brothers our you know our uh the Saints anas just been baptized and you know uh Malachi and our teenagers even brother Chris you know just freshly into the message you know it's quite a thing to say that we have the complete revelation of Jesus Christ what we mean we're not talking about we understand every single thing in the universe what we mean mean is we understand all things God wants us to know we understand all the Revelation that is currently available for humans right now you know we sang a song on the way to church and it was something you know uh after after a million years we'll still just start to understand the heart of God after one million years because God is so great and infinite like no one could uh let me set my timer here no one could no one will ever eternally or I'm sorry no one will ever fully understand God because he's greater than all of us he's the Creator and we have all eternity to spend with the Lord that's hard to wrap your mind around so what we mean by this is we have the the complete Revelation the complete will of God for what God wants done with the church right now that's what we mean okay and so you know Austin sent me a good question this week he said do we have the perfect uh uh Doctrine and I said well I mean I answered it with no sir because I didn't want to say I understand everything perfectly um so that's what I meant by that you know I I don't understand everything but I would say we follow the apostolic Doctrine because we're doing our best we're still growing into that now will I uh do I believe we'll have that right before the Rapture yes I do yes I believe you know in order for God to Rapture a church they got to be ready his wife has made herself ready Hallelujah Enoch walked with God until Enoch was ready to go home with God right and so we'll walk with if if we live to see it you know if the Lord allows us to go to the Grave that that's fine but if the Lord allows us to see it I believe right before before the Rapture uh the Bible said the lad rain will fall rapturing faith will fall we'll be under such an anointing right there there'll be all the pressure around all the the political pressure and and financial pressure all that be around us we'll have nothing else to do except live off the anointing the rain that God sent from heaven Hallelujah so I believe uh in those moments there uh in the when the latter rain is falling I believe we'll have uh the the fullness of Pentecost as brother brandom said now let's go to Joel 2 I'm going to you know oh yeah that's fine it might be nice to off thank you because be straightening at all my notes and you know trying to get to my thoughts I appreciate you wanting to know my thoughts here by God's grace because they're supposed to come from the Bible Hallelujah that's right but just reminder Joel 2:23 uh through 26 brother Ram says in the church age book uh this is thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride all right I just put it up there I'm having trouble getting to it there be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former Reign moderately now Paul's right there brother mam said the seventh Church age messenger G gave us the former Reign it's a teaching Reign Hallelujah so during brother Ram's Ministry from 30s to 65 that was the teaching rain God sent rain down remember God said he said my Doctrine drops as due from the heaven my doctrine's as rain in other words if God's going to water the seed he's got to give it the right teaching he's got to make sure uh the church is taught the right way Hallelujah so that's in the church age book brother Ram says his ministry was the former Reign to water the seed hallelujah thank God and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month okay verse 24 and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil when I listen to brother brandom I'm always more uh overwhelmed I listened to the evening messenger yesterday from 63 great message if you want to listen to that one uh he talks it's all about building up to his ministry God always sent a prophet right before judgment it's a beautiful message there we'll be getting into a little bit of that today by God's grace but every time this is what I I'm convinced every time brother Mercy I listen to brother brandom or listen to even sermons from message preachers I'm just amazed how much more there is to preach that's why we need a fivefold Ministry I can't do it alone even brother brandom couldn't do it alone right he was one man and we need the entire fivefold Ministry we need all five preaching gifts so this is we can clearly see this is fulfilled there's so many things uh uh the floors are just full of wheat there's so much word to preach amen there's so many things I want to grow in Hallelujah there's so many things I want to manifest I want God's spirit to flow through me Hallelujah I'm thankful for what I've seen right but there's also more the floors are full of bread full of God's wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil there there's always more Revelation for us there's always more joy for us to have Hallelujah that's right see if you haven't been joyful lately that's what you got to do you got to feed on the word of God you got to get in the spirit you got to drink uh from the wine of God's holy spirit praise God you got to be filled with the oil Hallelujah the joy of the Lord hallelujah that's right now verse 25 I'll restore so we're brother man talking about the complete revelation of Jesus Christ so the Revelation that they had at the the beginning 2,000 years ago much of it has been lost so God has to restore it in our day and he has been restoring in our day he he promised I'll restore to you the years the Locust hath eaten so this is the Antichrist spirit in four stages just like there's four horse riders just like there's four steps to Sin Sin enticed sin conceived sin death there's four steps it's very easy to see if you just look at the scriptural uh view of it so in other words uh these Antichrist Spirits were going to eat at the church all these years he says and that's the great Army God sent that among them right God God allowed that to go amongst the false churches uh because God has to give them what they desire preached on that last week God will give you whatever you desire you better make sure your desire is to do the will of God hallelujah right because we are not partakers of iniquity we depart from iniquity Hallelujah we preach on that on Wednesday night and brother Jose thanks for the kind words about that sermon brother Hal verse 26 and ye shall eat in plenty so there's plenty of food word to eat and be satisfied You'll Be So Satisfied being a holy ghost filled Christian Hallelujah and you'll praise the name of the Lord your God you won't deny God praise you'll give God praise Hallelujah that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed I'm not ashamed to be a Christian I'm thankful to be a Christian Hallelujah I'm going to keep praising him and God has been wonderful to me and every trial I've been through and every even mistake I made God has been wonderfully merciful to me he he's he's actually like the psalmist says he's actually done less than what I deserve in other words he hasn't punished me according to what I actually deserve and any honest person here would say the same Hallelujah God is so gracious and merciful Hallelujah now um now some of these I'm not going to as I had on my list there you you're familiar with Malachi 45 and6 the spirit of Elijah would turn our hearts back to the fathers in other words the fathers of the Christian faith Paul James John Peter so forth all the Bible writers and that's what brother R's Ministry was to do this is how we can have the complete Revelation because God in other words brother Chris God has turned us back to believe everything in the Bible amen as you saw some church some Churches don't believe everything in the Bible Austin see we all see it right when we when we're amongst those people they don't believe everything in the Bible they kind of pick and choose but God has turned our heart Hearts back to that through the spirit of Elijah that was on brother Brenham Hallelujah Revelation 10:7 said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so at some point the mystery of God has to be finished and the Mystery of God is detailed to us I have I have a whole book on that and brother R has given us all of the revelations of any teaching that's called a mystery there's 12 of them brother R has given us six of them with thus sayith the Lord and the other six line up perfectly with the other ones so we know the mystery of God is finished as far as the will of God the doctrine of God the plan of God uh the anything that's called a mystery in the Bible is finished as he declared to the prophets one of the prophets he declared that to is Daniel also Joel right uh so pull up Daniel 12:4 hun Daniel 12:4 here's a prophet that he promised this to but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro that's what they do today they fly to this conference fly to that conference drive to that they're thinking they're finding the will of God or the word of God they're not because Amos said it's a spiritual famine and you only find the food in one place where the Eagles are gathered hallelujah amen that's right amen where the carcass is that's where the Eagles gather for the word hallelujah see but they're running to and fro my those'll spend thousands uh like brother there's a brother from Minnesota he told me God brought him of the charismatic movement with Kenneth Hagen and Kenneth copelan and all those Benny hin God brought he was full in for 20 years and then God showed him William brandham and God pulled him out of there but this brother would fly all around the world and see all their supposed signs and supposed prophecies and he started seeing all the all the contradictions and so forth like that but he would fly thinking he's getting the word of God but then when he gets the word of God he said it totally changed his heart it melted his heart it made him feel thankful for the word of God cuz he knew finally knew the complete revelation of Jesus Hallelujah so the other preachers were keeping away that Revelation but God gave brother brandom the Teaching Ministry the the former Reign to give us the word so we can receive the word of God the seed can grow because we have the rain to help it grow hallel the anointing to help it grow Hallelujah yes that's right and notice the book was sealed to the time even two and then brother R comes around and says thus sayith the Lord here's the revelation of the Seven Seals Hallelujah so brother Chris that's really important to know brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord the book is now open in other words we understand all Seven Seals I got videos on them brother I got all I got books the book I gave you it's all in there by God's grace we're going to review a little bit today all right it's thus say now that's quite a thing to say that's either God or the devil we know it's God hallelujah because we'll see brother Bram always pointed us back to one place not to himself brother Bram said forget anything about me I'm just a sinner sa by Grace I'm not saying that to be humble he said but it's Jesus Christ doing all these things Hallelujah bringing us back to the word of God hallelujah yes now Matthew 17:11 now here's another Prophet who foretold of this restoration it was the Lord Jesus the god Prophet the greatest prophet and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias now there's the spirit of Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things remember this is Mount Transfiguration so before Moses and Elijah come to Jesus right the 144,000 Israel before that he's going to send Elijah to restore all things to the Gentile Church Hallelujah he's going to restore all things so even the Lord Jesus talked about this and notice the spirit of Elijah that was on William brandham remember he had all the attributes he prophesied the name of the Lord uh he preached against immoral women Elijah preached against a jezebel brother R preached against Marilyn Monroe right all these immoral women uh men of the Wilderness brother loved to spend time and got many Revelations out there the Wilderness that's where brother got stature perfect man out there in the wilderness he was sitting at the bottom of a tree trunk with a notepad and the lord gave him that message and took him to the verse and he drew the picture and everything and wrote it down right there sitting in the wilderness amen hallelujah Glory also Acts 20 verse 27 now this Pro this verse proves that they had all the will of God in the beginning but then the the church lost it because they wanted to do evil things you know the Catholic church and all these denominations but Jesus is going to restore at the end time look what Paul said Paul was there for I believe 3 and a half years if I'm not mistaken for I've not shun to declare unto you all the counsel that means purpose of God or will of God so in three years Paul was able to lay in here's all the will of God will of God with marriage and divorce will of God with the Rapture uh husbands and wives right lay it all in there uh freedoms and Liberties and all these things he was able to lay all of it in there I've given you the whole counsel of God and now it's been restored to us with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah now don't forget this brother bar said uh God's three-fold purpose in Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's been a number of years last time I preached that was when brother Aaron was here because he he had asked me to preach on that back in 2019 I preached on uh I repr preached brother bram's sermon on Christ is the mystery of God revealed there's a three-fold purpose God's trying to do so in other words all the counsel of God he was to get preeminence in his son first place in jesus' life the second thing is preeminence in the church and then thirdly uh he's going to restore the kingdom back to the Eden condition that's God's three that's his whole purpose that's the whole counsel of God Amen Hallelujah Glory that's the whole counsel of God and church so what does God want God wants preeminence he wants first place in your life am now church I I believe I preached this many times I believe God is holding off the Rapture because so many people have not heard the message like I told you about the Junction City Saints they it's all fresh to them imagine open up a message book it's the first time you've opened up a message book or the church age book it's to them I mean they get that feeling for the first time how about our little Jen wanting to be baptized soon by God's grace there's a reason uh the Rapture has been held off brother B said there's names brother said there's names on the book of Heaven the Lamb's Book of Life that still haven't recognized that their names on the book look but brother says when the last one recognizes it he said Jesus going to step off the throne and say now it's time to go down and get my bride she's ready Hallelujah Glory so that's what I believe and that's what you know second Peter 3 says that uh account it that the that the longsuffering of the Lord has held off the Rapture because he's still trying to save Believers so keep keep praying for people that aren't saved who would have thought last year would have been the year that brother Nia came to to Church brother like I've told you many times Hallelujah I've invited him to church and we pray for him and everything like that he's been such a faithful brother here by God's grace and how about brother Chris coming back by God's grace you know God this is God's time of longsuffering with me with all of us hallelujah God's doing something Hallelujah he's trying to save Souls Hallelujah remember brother R said the Rapture won't be one minute late Hallelujah God's going to wait till every name knows all my names on the book like John's name is on the book Hallelujah I'm a believer I'm one of the few and by faith in God's word I can claim it hallelujah amen I want to sing that one today maybe we'll sing that by God's grace now here's where we get to uh the seven Thunders remember in Revelation 10 I believe it's verse three and four this and brother man tells us plainly this is the the the act of God that allows us to have the complete revelation of Jesus Christ back in our day I know this is a little deeper of course it is the things of God are always deep Revelation 10 so Christ comes down as a mighty Angel verse three and notice in verse two he brings down the little book so he brings down the book that was closed in heaven with Seven Seals Jesus breaks the seals and he comes down and brings the open book the seals are broken verse three and he cry with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there in are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer or delay no longer for this to happen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets Hallelujah so once the revelation of the Seven Seals were given Hallelujah then we know that the book has been opened I want to read that quote if I can find it here I'm scrolling down yes hope that's it oh no it's Feast of the trumpets okay so I want especially these young young young brothers and sisters here just try I'm just going to try to break this down in heaven Jesus loosed the seals in heaven and and he s and John wrote down the visions that was uh back you know 8090 okay but then here in Revelation 10 we believe this happened in our day in March of 1963 We Believe Revelation 10 1:7 brother R said is history it's already been fulfilled that's what brother Braham said in other words Jesus Christ came down he broke the Seven Seals he r revealed the revelations of the Seven Seals and when brother Ram preached the first seal and gave us and told us what that first seal meant that was a thunder that was God's voice thundering down telling us what the Bible said what it meant that was on Monday night right and then Tuesday night was the second seal brother Ram ends the second seal and he stands there and he says that's thus saith the Lord if that's not a thunder pray pray tell me someone what is a thunder a thunder is a voice of God God hallelujah it's a voice of God it's God's voice thus sayith the Lord here's what the second seal means and then at the end of the seventh seal he says he says the church ages plus the history plus the seals he says all these things to the best of my knowledge are thus sayith the Lord amen glory so when he preached all Seven Seals we you know we heard the seven Thunders and remember John was going to write him down so he must have known what they said he must have known that the white horse rider was the an Christ not the Holy Spirit he heard it but God said don't write it I'm saving it for a people at the end time they're going to need it Hallelujah why because we need to eat the book Hallelujah in order in order to overcome Satan we got to eat the book and prophesy again Hallelujah in other words get away from that Antichrist Spirit get filled with the Holy Ghost get the eagle anointing Fly Above the things of the world don't stay and eat worldly carnal things don't get addicted to porn like a brother emailed me from overseas you know this week don't get addicted to to money and all these things get filled and get addicted to the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's why the book is open amen eat the book eat the word hallelujah and then you'll prophesy again some people wonder why isn't God using me more are you eating the book why isn't God speaking to me more eat the book God will speak through you hallelujah amen you won't even know it sometimes God will be speaking to you back in November when a family was not allowed to come to church I didn't even realize it on a Wednesday night I was closing in prayer and I said I I rebuke the hand of Satan on the situation there was only a few people here I know there was Witnesses here I know Zer was here I know my family was here I said Satan get your hands off this situation in Jesus Christ's name I didn't know but 5,000 miles across the ocean just a few hours after that the Lord anointed a man to intercede and by Thursday we got the news that the family can come back to church by God's grace that was Wednesday night and Church in the moment I didn't know what I was doing that's how it always is we don't know what we're doing we just yield to God God takes over and then you speak the word hallelujah and watch it come to pass Hallelujah like even last week I shared with brother amen I'll see you next week I left here saying oh I'm such a fool I'm I'm preaching away next week I'm out in Pennsylvania I said I'm such a fool and all week I'm like man what are you and then I got the text on Tuesday we're canceling the service even God wouldn't even let my words fall to the ground now I'm not saying a prophet I'm just saying I was speaking by the spirit of God and I didn't even know it that's just one I felt so foolish walking out here I'm like what did I do now I got to make it right I got to text and everything like that talk whatever even in that moment sometimes God will just speak through you and God will vindicate his word God always vindicates his word now so here's for the young Brothers here this quote from the Feast of trumpets brother Ram said he was in Sabino Canyon which is in Arizona and God had called him out to the west to meet the seven angels that would give the revelations of the Seven Seals brother R said I was up I was up with my hands in the air praying and a sword came into my hands you know that I stood there and looked at it just as natural as a hand is uh is not knowing what not know I'm sorry not knowing what it meant and it was left me with a voice that said this is the sword of the king what is the sword of the king the word so he has a vision and he has a sword in his hand he knows the sword is the word and then later the angel revealed it it was the word in the hand well that's what Ephesians 6 says you got all your five uh pieces of Defense but you got one offensive weapon that's the word of God hallelujah it's a very completely scriptural vision and then he comes back to Jeffersonville he takes that sword and says this is the first seal this is the second this is the third this is the fourth this is the fifth this is the sixth this is the seventh that's thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah I don't know how to do any planer by God's grace immediately after that the angel of the Lord appeared and told about the Seven Seals that I would return back to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals and there if I've ever said anything that was inspire fired it was in that there where the angel Lord met us and the Bible became a new Bible see that's how you'll know I was telling this to Malachi and my children that's how you'll know when you really have an experience with Christ the Bible becomes a real thing before I had the Holy Ghost I mean before I was even saved the church didn't mean nothing Bible didn't mean nothing but when I got saved the Bible became a new Bible and then when I came in the message the Bible became even newer Hallelujah when I first got brother I was reading all the time and my while the boys went out partied the football guys I was just in there reading highlighting my Bible NIV of all things God let me read an NIV see how merciful he is to my my uh ignorance and they're going off hey Jesse do you want to go to the party no I want to read my Bible okay and they mock me and make fun of me I don't uh they mock me I I don't go sleep around at the parties they mock me oh you're this and you're that let them say whatever they want I don't care I love Jesus Hallelujah nobody had to tell me no nobody had to ask me to read my Bible or go to church or pay my tie or anything nobody had to do that because the Holy Ghost told me to do it Hallelujah and it became a new Bible it was God's love letter to me Hallelujah God was telling me he loved me Hallelujah so became a new Bible and then when I found out about brother bram's Ministry it even became even more new Hallelujah and it's still that way by God's grace Hallelujah he said it became a new Bible there opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ all together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been I was so inspired and directed Hallelujah that's what I'm saying when I directed to speak to the family situation directed last week to speak You're Just directed you're it's just God takes over you you're just yielded to the Holy Spirit my wife gave me a fresh reminder sometimes she said when I come up here she said there's such an anointing up here around the the platform and I believe it too I've come up after brother Brian preacher or brother McBride and I'm like oh oh there's something different up here it's just showing that God's God's going to back up his word hallelujah just reminding that the word the presence of the Lord is here hallelujah the Bible said the presence of the Lord is here to heal to save to fill with the Holy Ghost to meet all the needs of the people the Bible said God sent his word and it healed them Hallelujah so God sends his word and he tells the he tells the truth beforehand Hallelujah that's what God's word does it's prophetic now I hope that's helpful uh Brothers by God's grace young Brothers yeah I told you you out Mali I said you know Mali even said he's understand the seals better so I said that's a blessing Hallelujah because they're deep they're deep and mysterious remember young Brothers the seals have three forms right they got a reality form when they happen in the real case they they got a revelation form what they mean and then they got a symbol form that's written down in the Bible so you just have to keep that straight if you keep that straight all the quotes make sense but in one case brother B said the seven seal is open we all see it thank God another case said the seven seal hasn't been open yet it depends which form you're talking about the Revelation is open to us we know what is it's the day and hour of Christ Rapture but the reality form has not been open to us no way and it never will be right no man knows the day or the hour of the Rapture and there's really no symbol of it as far as in Revelations Revelation 8 other than silence in heaven but then brother Ram will say somebody you remember this brother R will say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said the seven seal is seen in every type in the Bible in other words every time there's a coming of the Lord every time there's a Rapture story that's a type that's the seven seal Hallelujah glory to God so all the Old Testament types so Enoch that's a type of the Rapture that's a type are the seven seal Hallelujah you you just have to go through the Bible and look at every time the Old Testament where was the Old Testament Glory the body changed brother Jose Abraham and Sarah hallelujah king aimik saying oh I I want to marry that that 89 year old woman boy she's a real beautiful lady there I got to have her come on what kind of man would want what kind of King who could have any virgin or any little little girl would want an 89 year old woman for his wife what kind of a man God was changing the body Hallelujah and God will give us a body change in order to receive the promised son Hallelujah that's a type of the seven seal Hallelujah Glory so is Joel chapter 2 now I'm seeing it now it's a type of the seven seal the latter rain the latter rain gives us the fullness of Pentecost Hallelujah it will it's the last rain we need in order to produce the seed to produce the fruition and then God can Harvest his bride off the Earth Hallelujah all right I'm about halfway into my message by God's grace Glory now see this is why the seven Thunders are so important brothers and sisters it it basically means the the the revelation of the the the Book of Revelation the the meaning of it has been given to us so we have the complete revelation of Jesus Christ so let me just share this with brother Chris so Mo most churches you know they'll allow people to be married two or three times and say that's okay that's not a revelation of Jesus Christ they have an incomplete revelation of Jesus Christ they might understand you're only saved by grace through faith and you got to be baptized you know yes that's good but they don't have the full revelation of it now Pentecostals get a little closer but they say oh you got to speak in tongues to know you're born again that's that's an incomplete revelation of Jesus Christ Paul said do all speak with tongues the answer answer is no right now would I like to yes I've prayed and asked God but I never have people around us have thank God for that but it's a gift just like being a missionary that's he said are all missionaries are all Apostles are all prophets of course not so not everybody speaks with tongues so brother what we're saying is that we're the only church that has these Revelations from the prophet William brandham that gives us the complete counsil of God the perfect will of God we know how the church should live how it should operate how it should be we understand all these things and it's a gift to us it's not an incomplete it's a complete revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now are we growing in that revelation of course we're constantly growing in the revelation of Jesus Christ right but that's the way it should be right he's restoring I got to restore all those years oh each year we get another revelation of Jesus Christ aren't you glad you're going to get a revelation in 2025 Hallelujah all the years that the Antichrist took away God restores it back to us hallelujah amen glory now let's do uh I just want to give a a general quote here this is from 1960 the Ephesian Church age brother brand said uh the Bible reveals that and thoroughly says in the first chapter of Revelation which is the the only book in the Bible in the New Testament the whole can of the New Testament is the only book that Jesus put his own seal upon so it's the only book book where Jesus says I've got the Revelation from the father I'm giving it to John no other books have that wording in it so brother said that's how important the Book of Revelation is Jesus got the Revelation from the father gave it to John for us and church don't forget you're blessed just to read it I'll was tell my family you know I'm not sure which direction to go with our Bible reading at night I tell you we'll be blessed just to read the book of Revelation you want to be blessed read Revelation yes brother Chris yes read it and understand it yes yeah because a true child of God will only read it to seek understanding right only the critic will try to read it and disprove it or blaspheme it or something like that remember you got two kinds of Christians brother you got a wise and you got a foolish right you got some that have three talents and they they do a lot more for God I'm sorry five talents you got I imagine you got 54 321 but the Bible says 52 one you have people with different levels of abilities of gifts of God and some have more some have less but remember even the one and even some can take that talent and bury it in the ground and Jesus say you lazy servant you lazy and slothful servant you wasted your gift you buried in the ground don't do that let's use our gifts for God's glory whatever gift you got whether it's wisdom or whether it's Faith or whatever it is you just pray God build up my faith you've done it before Lord if I've got teaching whatever I've got build up my gift gift so I can magnify your Holy Name Hallelujah great question brother great question now I want to read these quotes too I got yeah I got plenty of time I got 28 minutes praise God Hallelujah the evening messenger in 1963 that's the one I listening to yesterday I love what brother R said and brother said people were saying Oh Brother Bram you've never been to the school of Bob Jones or you never been to the school of Oral Roberts brother Bram said I have been to school he said I've been to the school of the scripture that's the same the school I went to brother Chris the school of the scripture Hallelujah he said I never got a a theology degree I got a neology degree in other words God taught me to pray on my knees teach me the word Reveal Your word to me I'm on my knees God will reveal it then you get up and preach it Hallelujah that's a degree of neology Hallelujah now brother I'm talking about Micaiah which is first Kings 22 and he says Micaiah why would Micaiah who was the son of imla come back and prophesy contrary to them so in this story brother Chris you have the king of Ahab he's an Israel King but he's a baedan king he married Jezebel he had naboth murdered he was a murderous person but he's in the church that's called God like in today in other words today he'd be like he's in the Christian church but he's a murderer okay and Ahab want to know do I go up to Routh Gilead or not do I go up into the city and fight him and Ahab had 400 prophets might be 450 but in the one verse I read it said 400 all the 400 prophets said yes go up you'll get the victory yes go up and Jehoshaphat comes over and says Ahab uh is there anybody else here he could sense something's off here there's a lying Spirit here something's off and ahab's like yeah I got one more Prophet it's Micaiah but all he does is blast me for my sins I hate him look at that I hate that guy verse seven and Joseph had said is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides that we might I you got 400 that's exactly like those false prophets in 2020 they said Trump's going to get two consecutive turns the Lord show me that the Lord showed me that it made them all look like fools and they had a 50% chance to get it right and they had four years to get it right so that means in four years they never prayed with a sincere heart to accept to accept correction by the Holy Ghost think about that and then they doubled down thinking you know something's going to happen that's why you know January 6 happened and different things like that they they doubled down on it and they were made to look like fools or false prophets that's what God does to all liars that's right verse verse eight and the king of Israel said to josephat yet there's one man Micaiah the son of imla by whom we may inquire of the Lord I hate him for he does not prophesy good he never tells me anything good that's CU you're not living good if you you live good you'll get good Hallelujah but I hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil and Jose said let not the king say so why you got to say it like that such harsh words now go to uh First Kings 21:17 Lydia why why was uh I want to show this here why was Micaiah so sure how could he how could he stand I'm one man against 400 think about that one against 400 and no doubt the pressure of the devil would say just join the big group everybody agrees why you got to be different why you got to make yourself different from everybody else why you got to be in the little why you got to be in the little church the small Church the minority church just join up with the rest of them he's like I don't I don't believe lies I'm not taking lies why brother tells us might Micaiah had heard Elijah give thus sayth the Lord about Ahab that's why he knew plus God had showed him a vision right with the Lord High lifted up with all the the Heavenly counsel you see he had already known thus sayith the Lord from the previous Prophet Elijah verse 17 and the word Lord came to Elijah the tipit saying now I'm going down to verse 8 19 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayith the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place where dogs lick the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even him so Micaiah had known this Micaiah knew the prophecy of the previous Prophet right he knew Ahab was destined for God's destruction now remember Church even in there he still repented and had mercy on him even though his end God knew his end he was going to go back he could have a moment of humility but then he go back to his Disobedience and so micai had heard us that's one reason why Micaiah could stand against this man he's he's killed people now look he hadn't repented of the murder Micaiah knew it he wouldn't repent of the murder he wouldn't repent of building all those houses of idolatry he wouldn't repent of Mary and Jezebel that pain of face devil that's right so so Mai already knew well if God's prophets against him and he hasn't repented of any of this he's got to be wrong so it's easy to stand go it's easy to stand against the majority when you know thus sayith the word of God hallelujah it's easy for us to Chris for brother Chris for us to gather here 18 years we've gathered it's easy to stay here even though we're small and don't have a lot of money don't even have our own building and all these things it's easy because we've got thus say the Lord amen we know what thus sayith the Lord says against denominations there all the denominations are Daughters of the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic Church that's what the Book of Revelation says she's a mother of harlots the Roman Catholic Church is the mother all the denominations came out of Mama yeah she's the main one yes now when God brought out the Lutheran Church they were good until Luther died and the people just denominated we're not taking any more truth and then their denomination died then God moved on to the Baptist and Pentecostal that's where we are today and there's all I mean there's nazarine there's all all kinds of there's I think there's over 9,000 or 990,000 denominations I would get that number mixed up so many but see the word of God then the word of God says in Revelation I believe it's chapter 2 Jesus said I'm going to take the the daughters and the mother and cast them into a bed and Destroy them so there's no hope for any denomination it's thus saith the word of God hallelujah now can people come out of that yes they're supposed to come out of that and God's not going to bind them all together until the tribulation so they still got time to come out even in the tribulation they still got time to come out and whatever they were when the tribulation happens that's what the if he that's filthy still let him be filthy still he that's righteous he that's holy let let them be still whatever they are when the Rapture takes place that's what they'll be that's right so Micaiah knew the word Elijah had spoken against Ahab Ahab had not repented of all these sins and brother he he he he tells the story of Micaiah so it's Micaiah standing against 400 butam said he says uh now that take nerve it takes conviction to stand against the majority wow one against 400 Austin knows it you know when he's when you first come to the message Austin you're debating online right it was everybody in the comments against you yep it's a world it's me against the world I think there's a worldly song like that that's that's about the Christian Life they stole that from the Bible right it's it's Christians against everybody else how did they know he was right if you were standing there how would you know brother ra says how would you know it's one man against 400 and the king and you know they're going to put you in jail or abuse you if you don't agree with them how do you know look what brother Ram said the only way you you do let's say the only way ready the only way the only way is to take what the man the prophet says and compare it with the word Oh Glory that means all of us can overcome that means all of us can be on the right side today we just have to take both sides compare what does the word word say and if we agree with the word we're on the right side hallelujah praise God everything must be taken back to the word of God this is what brother says we have the complete re the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ the only way to know where I stand today or you stand today is to compare it with the word now let me just give you a few examples like I said on March 29th 20120 Kenneth Copeland said thus sayith the Lord CO's over Co is still going around that proved he was a liar and that disproves all of his followers from being that's not the voice you want to hear that's a hireling Shepherd that's a man who's paid for money he's only doing it for money I Pastor when I took money I Pastor when I haven't taken money Hallelujah that's right the only reason we have this church is because of the all your ties that's it I mean hardly any offerings this church is paid for by your ties I donate ties every month year after year 18 years so we can have a house of worship it's a joy it's not a struggle it's a joy because the Bible said H I was happy when they said to me let us go to the house of the Lord hallelujah you're the uh the Bible said the Church of God is the foundation the ground and the pillar of truth hallelujah there's not many churches in this area that stand for actual truth they're not the ground or the pillar of truth but you and I are standing on the truth of God's word Benny Hinn said God would destroy all the homosexuals in the 1990s in America he lied he also said Fidel Castro would die in the 1990s he lived like 2010 that man man's a liar but H but how do you know which side is he on look what look what he says about the Bible Benny H allows women preachers paint their face put the makeup on cut their hair wear pants wear high heels sexy clothes all this I mean just go through the list like there's 100 I got a video 110 things that makes us different there's more but 100 things that make us different from the denominational churches because we believe only the Bible Hallelujah it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ to you and I this Bible Hallelujah and as I said before if I preach anything outside this you come talk to me about it but you get a chance to ask me on Sunday nights starting next Sunday night I'll take any question by the grace of God Paul the internet preacher who called me the Pharisee for akaran he said uh Joseph brandham had until 2023 to repent or else the candle would be taken from his hand that was a lie Joseph brandham still has his he still has control over his ministry he said until 2023 and then he said it was fulfilled when Billy Paul died that's not taking a candle off a candle is a preacher the the light of the the light of the people is the preacher Billy Paul's no preacher now I mentioned this before but uh Joseph brandham said he and his church were in the perfect will of God for pressing play while changing the five-fold ministry that couldn't be he must have got confused he must must have got the second word of God because the first word of God will not change anything in the written word of God they change they say the fivefold ministry is a man who will press play and then walk away let everybody stare at a screen when the Bible said blessed are the feet of him that bring the gospel of good news Hallelujah a t player has no feet Hallelujah a cell phone has no feet blessed is the feet of the man who preaches the gospel the unrated unadulterated Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I don't know why I'm so fired up amen but look what brother Ram said brother Ram gave us thus sayth the Lord after thus sayith the Lord after thus sayth the Lord that come to pass here's one he said this is one I was sharing brother Chris he said how could Micaiah stop that how could Mah stopped those 400 prophets I thought it was beautiful tight in with Micaiah here how could he do that he said they just went on just the same all 400 just went on into the LIE he said ' it's predicted that they're going to do it other words Elijah predicted they would do it they would support the lying King the lying murderous King married to Jezebel right he said it's predicted they're going to do it and they're going to do it for thus sayith the lord they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination and come back to the word it's the thus sayith the Lord they won't brother Chris I've told five or six maybe more I've told five or six people when they when I share the message with them they say well I think I'm going to stay in my denomination and until they repent I said it's thus sayith the lord they're not one man said in there uh his name was Benjamin he said I'm gonna stay in there to pull out a girl and he never come out of there you don't go on the Devil's Playground you stay with God's children you don't go on the devil's side you stay with the Lord's of uh elect few God's Chosen Few that's right I've told some of our family members here like I've told you some of your family I've told them right to their face I said brother I said your denomination is going into the mark of the beast either our lifetime or the next it's thus sayith the Lord I said give it a window give it a year or two I I told that brother give it a year or two pray and and see if they change their their Creed they're not going to change their Creed it's thus sayith the Lord they won't but it's thus sayith the Lord that we'll stay with God's word hallelujah the complete re ation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we got thus sayith the Lord so we know where we're standing today will the denominations go into the Antichrist exactly it's thus sayith the Lord they will so we've got Kenneth Copeland saying thus sayith the Lord Joseph Bram we got uh Paul the internet Prophet I I'm gonna I might preach a whole sermon on this one time just show you all the false prophecies who was that other one Kenneth Copeland Benny hen Benny H all these guys and then we got brother Ram we got all these guys saying thus say the Lord who's right brother Chris whoever points back to the word it's very easy who points us back to the word that's the true Prophet Hallelujah very easy but we don't know that unless God sends a prophet to tell us put up Amos 37 Amos 37 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His Secrets unto the servants the prophets before God does anything on Earth he always shows it by a prophet first right and that's what Daniel talked about the seals being opened uh right Jesus said Elijah Resto will restore and come all things Joel said I'll restore with the spirit of Elijah all the they've all they were all pointing to brother man's ministry here to give us thus sayith the Lord go back to the Bible brother R said always every time a messenger comes it's always a call back to the word never fails remember he says he holds up his Bible this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ there can be nothing added to it or taken away from it it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the only way we can ever be sure if anything Rises Among Us that's contrary to this Revelation it's wrong I'm going to read that again anything that rises amongst us or any other Church against this it's wrong and this is right amen that's right this is right am Hallelujah the word is right that's how you know it's always so simple to know it's the only way we can ever be sure let's say only way ready only way I'm giving you all these only ways there's only one way to know go back to the word of God look look at the prophecy look at the previous prophets what's the Bible say look at the Bible it's the only way to know which side to stand on see it's back to the word and always calling back always calling back to the word and brother R says in every case in the scripture every case God uses a prophet to call the age back always go to Jeremiah uh 16:15 now I'm going to go through a list here of prophets I got I still got 11 minutes till my hour I want to be mindful of the time today Jeremiah 6:15 were they ashamed when they had committed Abomination yay nay they were all not ashamed not at all ashamed of the Abominations like these women these young women that'll wear pants to bed they're not even ashamed of that what if what if a brother what if a man wore a dress to bed what a bunch of hypocrisy nonsense they're not ashamed of it like we saw them in Canada they'll walk around I'll walk around in front of the boys brother BR said he says it don't parade yourself around in the pants if you're going to do that they weren't ashamed of it you see how people get numb to the Holy Ghost if you reject the Holy Ghost Whisper that still Small Voice long enough you'll be opposite and you'll just be unashamed to live in sin that is right neither could they blush they couldn't be ashamed of themselves anymore because of their sin therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that I visit them they shall be cast out sayeth the Lord now what's Jeremiah's word look at verse 16 thus sayith the Lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old pass now brother and just said it's always the prophet saying back to the word back we've lost our way we got to go back stand ye in the ways and see for the old path what were the Old Paths the law of Moses for us what is the old path back to Paul back to Matthew Mark Luke John acts Hallelujah Corinthians all these things back to the Bible we got to go back to believe in the Bible praise God where is the good way and walk wherein and you shall find rest for your souls and they said we will not walk therein so it's always a prophet saying go back walk in that that's where you'll find rest that's why people are uneasy in life that's why they're angry that's why they're bitter uh that's why they're upset with other people that's why they're going after uh pleasures of the world rather than God lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God hallelujah it's because they're not doing what God Said walk in the good way find rest for your souls peace that passes all understanding Hallelujah when you walk in God's truth he gives you peace and it passes all understanding it's not a fake piece it's a real peace you'll see because if somebody crosses you you'll see if you'll keep your peace or not Hallelujah that's right they said we will not walk in this I don't care what the Bible says we got a different way we got our own way to go now you all know this Noah what' he say he said we got to live righteously what they do they kept thinking evil thoughts Noah said let's go back to the old way did they accept it no now here's the here's the order Amos Amos I always say that wrong 760 BC just two I mean yeah just uh let's see that 200 some years after Solomon is already trying to come call them back in Amos I don't have time to read these maybe I'll read it Wednesday I might preach a part two on Wednesday Hosea next tries to call them back uh 15 or yeah 15 years later and then Isaiah 10 years after that tries to call them back and then Jeremiah a hundred years about 80 years after that he's saying come back come back to the word back to the word that God always does it the same come back to the word come back to the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and then around 6:05 Daniel prays for them to come back Ezekiel 593 Ezekiel prays for them to come back Joel around it's uncertain but it's probably around 500 BC Joel says come back God will restore all the years and Zechariah around 520 and then Malachi around 430 BC always calling them back come back come back God always sends a prophet to call us back to the word of God hallelujah all right thank the Lord hallelujah all right Read that read that okay let me close this this uh I got seven minutes let me close with those visuals hu can you switch over let's go through this here slowly I want to go through this again slowly so everybody can see it I'm have to preach a part two on uh Wednesday night now if you Brothers uh Claude and Patrick if you keep coming on Wednesday night let me know we can go through these on even on Wednesday night by God's grace if you got the time and everything I know you got studies and want do your best in the studies but uh let me know we can go through these kind of slowly just break them down now for me Brothers here's how I did this I had uh this is how when I became a first original Pastor first first time Pastor I I had like this I had brother Rams right here I brother Ram right here I'd Press Play I listen and I write down what he said I'd stop it write down what he said stop it play stop play hour after hour after hour sit down in our kyoga Falls basement with all those uh what are those called centipedes basement centipedes running all around the place just one just spend that time with the Lord that's how God reveals things when you spend time with God that's the only time you got you got to shut away with God now I still do that by God's grace but I just want to show you I just had a Open Bible I actually had the seven seal book brother Jose loves the books I had an open book Bible and just highlight that understand okay write that down okay I'm Gonna Save that quote and then I can understand it by God's grace but there's there's I'll say like this everybody wants a shortcut but there's no shortcuts with God how can I get caught back up uh it takes one day at a time one day at a time takes a faithful walk today you're going to need to be faithful tomorrow to Hallelujah you have you have one day that's that's that's it's not a good day just repent and start up the next day just start back up you can't have a shortcut and jump back to where you were you got to slowly build up with the love of Christ in your heart so here at the end of the seventh seal Brothers here's where he says now the vision now what was that Vision the vision of going out west getting the king's sword the new commission the opening of The Seven Seals meeting the seven angels all that to tell them come back West The Vision Plus the word remember the big explosion I went through that a few weeks ago plus the word like Revelation 6 and plus the history all the church history he laid in the Seven Seals plus the church ages that he preached back in December 1960 and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayith the Lord who do you know that talks like that nobody talks like that and what did Brother man say he said go back to the Bible go back to the Bible live what the Bible says hallelujah obey the word of God now you got the seven Church ages right from the of Ephesus was 53 up to leoa now it's I need to fix that it's probably beyond that now now that we're in 2025 okay but remember uh after Jesus sent it he sent the line anointing right the four beasts okay but then the devil tried to fight against that by sending the white horse rider okay that's the White Horse that's the Antichrist Spirit that's the first seal that was the when the reality formed happened the Antichrist spirit and then then remember John says there's all these Antichrist out here now right around uh 90 ad and this white represents innocent deception by false teaching that's what it means just that it's Antichrist Spirit false teacher okay now he wrode that that many years that the first seal lasted that long and then brother R said he jumped off his White Horse and then he hopped on a bloody red so now now the church has control now the the Roman Catholic church has control over the people now they can kill anyone that disagrees with them brother man proved it in history there's over 68 million Martyrs at the Roman Catholic church and that's a low number because then Revelation 18 says every death goes back to the Roman Catholic church so they're behind it somehow now I'm not telling you to get into conspiracy theories I'm just believing in the word of God I can't spend my time trying to focus on the mother Harlot I got to focus on the bride but I know what the Bible says so I got to say what the Bible says and so then God anointed his people with the ax anointing to give themselves willingly to sacrifice themselves they would just they would just die they would just give their lives and they they know they're going to heaven and uh now they have United Powers they have United powers of church and state brother Williams sent me an email this week and he said that that Beast had two horns brother William was emailing me this week one is Civ civil that's government and one is ecumenical religious it looked like a lamb it turned out to be uh turned out to be the Buffalo right that's the that's the mammal for United States Buffalo that's the Beast out of the Earth all right now he rode quite a while he rode uh hundreds of years looks at a about you know quite a while so he had uh he had many times many years and then he jumped off the red horse into the black horse which represents the Dark Ages that's the third seal now remember this is all reality form when when did these seals actually take place in human history that guys this help do you remember this yeah been a little bit and so now that he's on the black horse brother Chris he it's the Dark Ages and they burn all the English Bible I'm sorry not English uh it was before the English Bible they burnt any other Bible not in Latin and there's a little group uh it's part of uh the fourth Church age it's a little group that keeps all the word of God on some Island Way far away island nation far away from the Roman Catholic Church that's how God God always protects his word but now that he's got control of the Dark Ages now he can capture the wealth of the world what are you gonna say brother on purpose yeah they would read it in Latin and the people couldn't understand it and there's still people that there's still Catholics today that go to Latin services and don't understand one word they're say they're keeping the word from the people why because it's powerful there's power in the word the word will expose Satan that's right amen that's right am the word always exposes Satan now so God had to send the anointing of a man I just put Martin Luther because he was the messenger for that church age coming up okay now the black horse lasted the Dark Ages was almost like 1095 to that that anointing lasted on almost to 1906 there so they battled for almost almost A Thousand Years brother R said that was Satan's Millennium and the church said almost a thousand years of full control but thank God God's going to have his Millennium Hallelujah and you and I get to be there Hallelujah we'll be in the real Millennium ruling and reigning with Christ because we stood with his word here on this Earth Hallelujah and we didn't go into the mark of the beast and all of her daughters all those denominational daughters that thus sayith the Lord they'll take the mark of the beast there's my hour okay let me close I'll close with this one okay now that that finishes the third seal then the fourth Seal The Pale Horse spiritual death and now spiritual death has been writing brother uh but God sends an eagle anointing which is a prophet anointing a prophetic anointing since 1906 now the saints of God are anointed with a prophetic anointing to recognize a prophet to receive thus sayith the Lord to prophesy again what brother Ram's already said Hallelujah and then but we go up in the Rapture Hallelujah we go up and then the Antichrist rides down uh to the battle of Armageddon brother BR that's his last ride okay so that's actually the beginning the seven seal is almost simultaneously happening with the fifth and sixth at the same time it's almost simultaneously but the rapture first okay then you have the fifth and the sixth and we can spend more time on that okay oh yeah this yeah this this might help too let me go here so here's the reality form there's the church ages the first seal only lasts a little bit of time right just a SE a little more plainly take I take out everything else then you got the second seal lasted that period and then the third seal lasted a long time right almost a thousand years and now the four seal goes into this is you know future time like our time like we don't know when it's going to end 2025 2026 we don't know when it's going to last okay but whenever the Rapture take place that's the seventh seal or the last Mystery Begins all everything's going to be finished brother Brown said everything ends under the seventh seal he said time ends under the seventh seal because there's only Seven Seals there's not eight SEALS or nine seals the seventh seal so the seventh mystery has to be all that time that's left in history okay and almost simultaneously uh the fist seal sounds there it is I was going to say where's my fist seal there's my fist seal that's the Jews crying out oh Lord when are you going to judge us uh or I'm sorry judge the world that that uh when are you going to avenge our blood and he said just wait for a little season what's the little season three and a half years all right and then you have the Sixth Seal which brother says is the Tribulation seal all right now I don't know why I brought that down what is that the future home oh yeah future home okay so the future home is New Jerusalem after all this is done after all the judgment after all the tribulation after the Thousand Year Millennium the final event is the future home coming down where Christ and his bride live forever Hallelujah okay let's stand on our feet musicians can come
