TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a place you plan on going to amen oh I I love it I love it the older I get the weepier I get I didn't used to cry so much through songs but I don't know I just seem to really feel in my heart that we are very very close to that great Homeland don't you think so amen Matthew chapter 5 verse 38 and 39 if you got your Bible sure yeah I think the brother's arranging it yeah yeah I know I thought it was just me but I'm usually doing that mess right there anyways so I'm a poor judge of what's hot in anyone hunt amen Matthew chapter 5 verse 38. I want to speak to the Lord willing upon persecuted Church A persecuted Church Jesus says now you have heard that have been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also now drop down to verse 44. but I say unto you love your enemies let's go and let that one sing for a minute we're going to need some real material to make this one live Ain't we bless them that curse you wow do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he may get the son his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust we're talking about having some real bride material now to make this happen right here it's going to take some real genuine god-given material because listen to me very carefully this kind of preaching what we're getting ready to do right here this is not the kind of stuff you can get from Jake's and Osteen and Peggy and these guys most of these guys that will preach to you about a persecution they take it a whole lot different direction here they are in the spotlight on the television and Internet and everything everywhere you go they're big worldwide known figures and people like that I'm sure will take criticism from the media they'll take criticism from you know from other uh what's World calls haters These Days and things of that nature and I'm sure there'll be a population of those people that you know will just fall into the uh the sights of somebody that's going to be evil to them based on their personality and how visible they are but this little group that Jesus is talking about isn't people that are being persecuted because they got their face splashed all over television and the internet this is the little despised group of a little God's bride that's despised and rejected even amongst her own Brethren and her own churches amongst her own people and this persecution we're talking about isn't talking about things going viral because somebody didn't like you or found a video or a post or some kind of thing we're not talking about somebody getting on social media and ripping you to shreds because of something you said publicly we're talking about the people that simply hate like our sisters down going down through Walmart long dresses long hair and walking like a sister on a walk and so forth like that and despising them for their stand before the Lord amen let's let's pray together for the word before we get any deeper father thank you for the reading of the scripture we thank you for the truth we're so grateful Lord Jesus for your mercy for your love we cannot begin to express to you how we feel when we feel your presence coming into this place we know Thou Art the same yesterday today and forever and we are so grateful to you my Lord for all that you've done for us as your children we we are looking to you today for the great outpouring of the Holy Ghost that will take his word speak to us fathers were yielding ourself to you today we thank you Lord Jesus for brother Jesse and his church body and for allowing to be able to come back another time to be able to minister this little group we thank you for that Lord and our soul appreciative of the workers and the laborers here and the saints that are gathered May the Holy Ghost take us now into your hands like clay and speak to us as we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen and amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you really good sure thank the Lord for all of the great things he's done and I guarantee you that if we spent some time you know perhaps even just sharing testimonies and making the testimony say something to the effect of start at the beginning when you got saved and just go through all of it I mean really honestly a month wouldn't handle just what's in this room right here so many things that if you begin writing it down and making marks on papers and maybe get your laptop out of your tablet or something start making notes the things that God has done for you has been immeasurable and you will run out of time to start saying the things that God's done and how good he's been and imagine that's just what we know that's not counting what we don't know all of the things that he's protected us from and watched out for us and kept his hand to Mercy On Us in times that we didn't even know that there was a car coming our direction or we didn't know that that little cell was going to turn into cancer or we didn't know you know some little thing thing was going to happen this way or that way amen just like the children of Israel didn't know when God took them up to that death trap up there called the Red Sea that the reason he was doing and as the Bible records was to keep him encouraged because the fighting that was over on the North side was way worse than what they were going to see there and it goes to prove that the Lord knows exactly how to lead us every step of the way I trust him and I believe him to be the one that knows my pathway in this life and I've learned if I follow him and I trust him and I allow him to be the boss of my life great things take place whenever the holy spirit is in charge of what we do and you know when the Lord leads us in many directions often friends I know that what I'm getting ready to say sounds very strange compared to the regular trend of what we hear and cares charismatic churches and and the light but you know really when God leads us he don't always lead us from one's success to another and from one great Mountaintop to another but many times the Christian Life is full of failures full of distresses full of regrets full of broken pieces and broken Pathways and all of those little mean spirited things we got to put up with and let you see in whatever age you lived in amen it looked like the Holy Spirit would lead you in a way of nothing but prosperity and always on the mountain and everything going well but remember true character of God as Peter tells us in his book is not formed it's not shaped it's not made when everything is going well but true character of God is formed in the fires of persecution tribulation trouble and all of the bad stuff that happens and if I was to sum it up and make it really quiet really quick and just make the Run remark and we could go home and amen go find a place to eat chicken somewhere amen I'm going to say a Christian Life is full of trouble amen God bless you Church take the name of Jesus with you amen that's about all you need to know amen but one thing that we do understand stand is that yes the Christian Life is full of joy yes the Christian Life is full of prosperity and and great things of God yes that does come to a Christian but remember those are not the things that shape who you are they're not what makes you what you are if God blesses you with money or with health or some other kind of thing in a prosperous manner he does so because he can trust you when he hands those things over to you he does it because it's maybe for you to give to somebody else or to bless somebody else you know some people are so prosperous with happiness it looks like nothing ever gets them down amen but instead of us patting ourself on the back people saying boy you're the happiest fellow I ever met how do you stay so happy amen God give me a full bank account of Happiness so I could turn around and become infectious so I could spread it to you and to you and to you amen and help you feel a little bit about what I feel amen and this is what we've got to understand that the Bride of Jesus Christ has always been a persecuted group are you with me say Amen under those circumstances has the bride ever not been persecuted amen every step she takes every place she puts her foot the devil's right there to work against her because she is a part of the plan of God Amen walking in the will of God is an antithesis a contrary to everything the devil is and if you think when you woke up this morning that you were going to make a deal with the devil he leave you alone you leave him alone amen just always watch behind his back he keeps his fingers crossed when he makes deals right Satan has no intention of leaving us alone and you say amen he has no intention of not fooling with us amen I believe that when it comes brother Jesse the long time Christians amen Christians that have been in the service of the Lord for many years I believe they reach a spot you know where little things don't seem to bother him like they used to amen little mess up is along the way little stupid things that we do as humans things that enter our mind or what more we just repent and go on and don't worry about it amen I don't believe the devil puts a lot of effort into Christians like that to figure out how to trap you in little tiny things like that but I do believe that Satan will work for months and months and even years at a time for a Christian like that to set one trap just one that will be the thing that may take you down completely amen this is why we should always be on our guard amen no matter if it seems like a calm time a Peaceable time well the devil don't seem to be bothering me you better be worried amen you better be concerned amen you better be watching because you don't know what slang out Amen in front of you Satan may be working a scheme that he thinks will be the ultimate scheme to take you out of here amen and to destroy your walk with God little things sometimes when you come to a place of maturity don't bother you like they used to I remember when I first got saved uh you know June of 91 when I first received the Holy Ghost I I was uh I was a very sensitive person anyways and I was raised with the kind of nature of really sensitive about a lot of things it was tough but I was sensitive at the same time and you know I I could get deeply deeply hurt by people and they'd say things to me and hurt me just cut me right to the quick but yet put on a tough exterior nobody would ever know what bothered me and that's dangerous in a lot of ways because that's what builds up resentment and anger in people and as I told you my testimony many times that's what brought me to the spot I believe to where I had such hatred and anger built up in my heart amen that that I believe I could have been on the verge of being a violent person or something like that listen you don't have to be strong and look like Arnold Schwarzenegger to be full of demon power amen women sometimes little frail things the prophet talked about that girl that was insane from menopause that time he said had not been for the grace of God Amen he said I was able to get my foot on her chest and push away like that he said with all that demon power raging in her she could have tore me to pieces amen this is why in our hearts we have to be under we have to understand that that that God builds us in a certain way he makes us with a certain ability to serve him and to live for him and you know that said again me being a sensitive type person when I first received the Holy Ghost the nature that I had I was bothered by things that people didn't seem to care about I used to wonder about that man you big why don't you hey man grow up a little bit put your big boy britches on the kids tell me and I said well I don't know about that I feel a certain way about things that I can't overcome it you know one day I was reading the message of the hour where brother Mann was out there squirrel hunting like that it's every time he tried to hit the squirrel's eye he'd miss that eye he wanted that perfect bullseye on that animal he said he got so upset about it he couldn't decide by a tree and just cried his eyes out you know modern-day men would have said brother man was nothing but a back in his boxing days you better smile when you say that the Bible is a tough old boy don't kid yourself he was tough you know and here brother man was sitting there thinking that over and the Holy Spirit spoke to him he said yes you've got that kind of nature about you but think of it when it comes to the word how you are he said you're always wanting to hit the bullseye exactly every single time so being a sensitive type person when I first got saved least little things sometimes would make me fall into a place of repentance and in my mind I'd be apologizing to God about everything afraid maybe I moved a certain way in prayer we're going to finger the wrong direction in prayer got distracted too easily and maybe would he give didn't give the Lord my full attention and there was parts of me that struggled for a long time because of that kind of regimen and that lifestyle that thinking that thought life that I had it tormented me many of the days that I lived as a Christian and now I get a little bit older now and I'm serving the lord many years and it's not that I ignore sin or ignore the things that are wrong but those little old tiny sensitive things like that I come to find out God isn't as interested in it as I thought he was some of those little things that were habits to me or patterns to me they really didn't hold as much weight with God as I thought they did and you know the devil saw that nature in me as well so the least little things sometime he'd be on a straddle of my back brother Jesse wearing me out in one church service you can imagine being a preacher what that's like you didn't say it this way you didn't turn that direction at the right moment you didn't you know Crescendo your message just right every little thing seemed to bother me and torment me Satan knew that about my nature so he honed it and focused upon that part of me until I was able to get victory in my life and realize that you know if a man is standing there in prayer and let's say you have your hands up like this and say your eye goes to itching you know for me it was a I I had to stand there and try to fight that off until finally I had to answer my crazy eyeball why humanly I couldn't avoid it was bothering me but at the same time I didn't want to feel like I was offending the Lord oh it's a hard thing to do but yet that kind of nature to me made me serious about truth that kind of thing about me made me serious about the gospel and I observed and picked up on things to help people that other brothers would ignore that's one reason the Lord's given me 20 years of full-time evangelism around the world Amen and people said with covet they said well you're probably gonna have to go get some work I said get some work I've been busier than I've ever been they said how could that be possible I said because I wasn't sitting around waiting on the phone for the big machines to call me I hit all them little churches that were already social distance before social distancing was a thing preaching the gospel is brother Jesse's got it back there in the pastor study it's a service to God this isn't about retirement this isn't about building up seniority this is about your service to God and for me you know there was a lot of moments in my life that I wondered have I gone crazy but I lost my mind but no what I realized now some 30 years now I realized that the Holy Spirit was training me for real fire because you see when the devil attacks you he doesn't always come at you with you know as we say in the Hollywood version of it with a pitchfork and horns and a red tail but he comes to you in subtleties sometimes little tiny things that you don't observe Jesus revealed to us that the way Satan moves is by little foxes you know the little fox the way it would kill a vine it would reach down because it wasn't tall enough to get the berries and things it would get down and chew on the very root of the thing and till it at the root a little fox a baby fox was actually more deadly and dangerous to a vine out there to a Vineyard than a big one was Hallelujah Satan knows how to approach the people that he's fighting against many of you I'm sure could testify that there were moments of your life to where there was such a seriousness when you first started serving God every little thing seemed like it was sin brother I'm called that like with Ruth he said she worked herself through her stage of legalism that's what we do we work ourselves through these stages of finding what is pleasing to God what is it pleasing to God until finally we reach a point to where we realize okay this is not as big a deal as I think it is and when a Christian reaches maturity and they start growing up in Christ the devil says we can't move the same way that we did before because you see the devil doesn't have an automatic updater like we do on our computers you don't know something needs updated and you're in the middle of a project or teaching school or whatever you're doing and all of a sudden Windows says and we're automatically updating the guy invented that little button better not meet me at the Pearly gate I'm gonna give him some trouble him I lost count of the times be in the middle of a class all of a sudden here come that automatic update guy Satan don't need that he watches human nature and before you even realize you've advanced he's already advancing his tactics studying you to see how you fight how you handle things which way you're going to go what directions you're going to handle things in Satan knows how to adjust himself to meet the challenge of what it is that you are presenting by your Christian life before Christ therefore the tactic that he fights with and how that he brings persecution against you will be in such a concentrated and strategic manner that you don't even realize you're in the middle of a fight when he launches it how many times has Satan come moved on people moved on Folks at work moved on people in stores that even come up under the extending the hand of friendship give that some time you find out sometimes in friendships will lead to ruination because they had bad motives in the beginning I told people at the church some some months ago that I think where we've made some of our biggest mistakes is Christianity is we've tried to have friendships with the world I have many Associates that aren't Christians but I can't call them true friends until they do the will of God getting too deep into friendships like that has always been the cause of many of the problems that people face in this world sure for example being a father or a mother you can be a friend of your child that's true I hear preachers say don't be a friend to them yes be a friend to them but don't forget you're also an administrator and it's your job to call the boss so to speak and to tell them how that life works and how things operate and as men our job as Leaders is to set the tone of that family and how things are going to operate Satan also knows the nature of how things fit together meaning that if you're a person that has always wanted a friend like brother Branham watch how that worked on that Prophet for many many years even after the opening of the seals he would fall into such deep depression thinking nobody liked him and he had no friends Satan would work on his mind and one of the way that he chose to combat it which I think is one of the to me it's the most interesting and simple and yet profound way is to handle something he'd just go through the parking lot and start looking at the license plates to see who all showed up to hear him preach that morning it goes to prove there's all kinds of material to fight with you he's got to be looking for it amen Hallelujah not realize that when Satan then comes at you as an enemy the reason that Jesus is advising us now to not resist evil he's not referring to us being just pushovers he's not trying to tell us that to be a real Christian means you don't have a stand for anything or that you don't have any kind of principle to fight for but what Jesus is referring to when it says here don't resist evil and turn your cheek if they Smite you on the one it's more a symbol if you will of the attitude we're supposed to have when we realize that some people get in the way of the devil's plan you heard of the middleman I'm sure some people become a middle man in Satan's scheme and don't even know it you know some people can get anointed of the devil quickly and not even know they're anointed of the devil as a preacher be going through something dealing with some kind of problem or some kind of circumstance and thinking to myself uh you know a great burden falling on me about the thing and thinking to myself how in the world am I going to fix this thing or solve this thing or whatever it may be and go visit a church somewhere I'd be preaching and sit down and have supper or sit down and have dinner or some kind of thing and somebody walk up and say something to me it's almost word verbatim or the thing I said in automobile they don't realize they're being anointed of the devil sometimes but they become middle men they get caught in the middle of Satan's scheme so Jesus is advising us to recognize who the Real Enemy was now listen close don't fail this the real enemy is not the one that did the smiting the dispute despising or the hating or the one that would do the cursing that's not the real enemy remember it is always just a spirit on your brother it's never your brother amen if they're truly children of God in their heart they don't want to do the wrong thing if they're true children of God I feel it getting tight because you've done picked up on where I'm heading and you know what I'm getting ready to do I'm getting ready to throw the door of your spirit wide open and is that scary that's all right you don't open it I'm gonna kick it in so you might as well get ready I know how you're feeling because I myself contain scars hold possess scars Within Myself friendships that turned sour people that said and did things betrayals two-faced type stuff things that people said one thing didn't exact I understand how that feels to be lied to to be told and held up in such regard and then behind my back be told what a scum of the earth I was sure those things hurt you a family member somebody was raised with that might be narcissistic selfish and self-absorbed all they cared about was you and they spent their time gaslighting you from one moment to the next making you feel like a complete and total worthless human being and yet at the very same time them getting deep satisfaction over making your life miserable as long as you bowed at their feet they didn't care what the result of it was sure people have been the product of abusive relationships husbands of abusing wives wives abusing husbands it does happen it doesn't always have to be physicality words are powerful men are made to be amateur creators they can create an atmosphere in that home of such tension oh you said that ain't right hold on now brother Adam is talking to a woman that has this dream and in this dream there's an eagle flying down she's standing in white sand and there's certain little events in symbolic form that happen and because there was a prophet on the earth to interpret them they brought their dream to brother random now when brother I'm told these dreams he didn't tell these dreams in the way that he thought it might be he had to see the dream itself and vision and then look for all the missing parts that they left out in order to tell them what the vision is amen unless a person could see a dream that way don't go by your impression or your feeling when somebody tells you a dream I think it feels like it might be you better stay away from that until you see the dream itself and how it actually operated you can't interpret it properly brother Adam said that God would speak without a prophet in a direct message like he did Joseph rather than symbols but because there was a prophet on the earth now watch how this fits together this poor lady brother Adam said was going around talking talking talking talking he said sister according to the dream you were in white sand everything is all right he said stop thinking about it you're making your whole family nervous because of this dream even a Christian can succumb to certain things of a spiritual nature and get so worked up about it and so excited about it they drive everybody around them crazy you might as well say a man it's the truth anyhow right and yet we got to realize that all of these things is the way that the devil uses tactics to catch us at a place where we're vulnerable and defenseless well say something that I want you to listen to carefully if I as a Believer ever let my guard down even once it may take years to get there but that's the very opening Satan's looking for and the moment he does it you're in trouble but for the grace of God things will not be good for you all would you say brother Ben that sounds exhausting being on my guard well this is the beauty of being able to surrender yourself to the Lord every day so you don't have to go around 24 hours a day and wake up in the middle of the night wondering okay am I all right am I right no no see that's that's where you're getting on the other side of things you're opening yourself up to all kinds of nervousness and all kinds of things like that what God wants you to do is just simply commit yourself and the final outworking of everything to his hands and let him be the one to take care of the business instead of you worrying about it day and night praise the Lord would you say that sounds hard right for you but there's anything too hard for God even do all things by him all things are possible with man maybe not some guy have a strong enough mind enough positive thinking he'd do all right for a little while but let the right circumstance come along all that positive turns to negative just as quick as it was positive right that's why mind over matter will never work we can never take a positive thought and expect that to bring birth to us amen we must take the word amen and place the word in our mind and let the word bring forth and power what is called and ordained to do right and yet at the very same time here Jesus says love them that are your enemies how am I supposed to love somebody that's hurt me so deeply how am I supposed to have genuine love for someone that was abusive or or just I put like a little blank like a little new season of how them filling the blank words go like that I was put a little blanket you just stick what you want in there you fill in your experience how can I love someone who's been so vile corrupt cruel the secret in loving a person like that is to recognize what motivated the person oh listen to me we're coming to this persecuted bunch in a moment but I'm going to get you down the runway on this before we get flying if I can understand that the motivation of much of the cruelty in this world comes from the devil and plans that he's executed against people who have been too weak to fight him then I can see them in a different light Ergo I can show love to them in a way that I'm not able to do if I see it in the light I put them in you see there's a lot of people that sit in church and fight the preaching of the word in their minds and their spirit because in their mind they're not really fighting God they're fighting their daddy there's a lot of people in church that can't get Victory become the pre with the from the preaching of the word because they're sitting there fighting mama when they see God they don't see God the Eternal the one that loves us the one that died for us the one that Rose for us the one that has given us everything we've got they see somebody 's face on him and this is where we've got to be careful not to blend together our experiences and put them back upon God because you see here's where the devil fights sometimes God is all-knowing and God is all-powerful and God can do anything he wants so what's the next words out of their mouth why didn't God take me out of it you know we used to have an expression down south I learned it as a kid Beggars can't be choosers when you've been placed on this Earth by the hand of a creator and he has laid out the plan of not just you but billions of people right now in this world seven billion people exist in this on this planet in the 21st century go back two thousand four thousand six thousand years now how many billions trillions quadrillions on and on you could go of people has God set plans for in their life down to the very minute what do you say a jot in the Tittle right down to the very shot and Tittle of their lives God has set the scope and the tone of who they are trillions just in the last two thousand years alone think of how many how many Souls that looks like and yet we say oh God the powerful God should make an exception for me see when we look at in the wrong light we become very selfish thank you we're very righteous we become very selfish thinking we're very justified in our way because as human nature as we've been raised in a society to believe that you know I'm important I know that's what they tell you when therapists try to get you past all of the problems of Mommy and Daddy and PTSD and try to get you over all of that uh you know trauma bonding and all the little things that come along with all of this psychological stuff that says step one know your importance I say they're Liars I say the best thing to do is realize without the grace of God I would be nothing amen don't try to make yourself something make yourself clay in the hands of the one that can do something for you right always remember the Way Up Is Down on the way down is up psychologists and smart people will tell you you've got to start seeing your worth well in one way I get what they're saying if God listen to me listen my exact words if God has placed something in me it's of value if the Lord has done something for me it's a value but other than that the Bible said my righteousness is filthy rags all that's good amounts to nothing people run under psychologists and my mommy did this and my daddy did that my uncle broke me and my cousin did this and that and after so many of those the psychologists have got to go visit another psychologist who's visiting another psychologist to solve his problems too or hers the great Warfare that is going on right now in an age where Jesus said love would disappear the very time when love would turn to hatred these words that he said two thousand years ago still ring true I said you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that's despitefully use you and hate you and say all manner of evil against you why why would Jesus put us in such a precarious spot because he wants us to recognize the revelation of why it is happening it's not happening because you know some people got that attitude well if it won't happen to anybody it's going to happen to me you hear people saying it all the time anybody going to get picked on I'm the one that's going to get picked on listen Bobby you're not the only one on the planet that feels that way hello somebody for every one of you there's ten thousand saying the same thing in a foreign language just like you all right brother right Society man humankind whatever you want to say every single one of them have an attitude woe is me and Y is me and yet God doesn't want us to look at ourselves in that manner if I am to Love My Enemy the reason I Am To Love My Enemy is because God plays something within me listen that the enemy don't like Hallelujah he plays something of value within me that Satan puts a Target on and he comes after go read some of the self-help books these days this is what they said a lot of the ones that teach you to have a good mental health they call it every single one of them the way they say things see your value see your worth see that your opinion matters all right let's put that against the Apostle Paul and see if she checks Paul said everything I ever learned and everything I ever knew I considered it like dung save Jesus Christ and him crucified comes out of me he said it came because God separated me from my mother's womb and chose me to declare his glory in me but I'm afraid that we've got ourselves into a plot twist we've read so many of the good books out there that we've forgotten Satan's scheme is to get man thinking he's better than what he is the moment you go to believing that you got the World by the tail the moment you go to saying I'm not a bad guy after all watch out be careful now I don't mean you walk around and call yourself scum and villainy all the time and treat yourself like you have no Worth or value to God oh I'm terrible I'm this I'm of that no we just say them things because deep down what we're really wanting somebody to say to us is that you're not that way either side of it we're making excuses and we'll never find Deliverance in that come on preach to me now you'll never find Deliverance on either side of it the only way you can find Deliverance is to say God I am your creation you are my Creator and anything I'll ever be comes from your hand and your hand alone take me into your hands like clay and mold me when we can learn to surrender these elements to God then we can render the enemies powerless which is what Jesus was saying here by loving my enemy I render his plan of attack powerless because the whole purpose of an enemy to do something to me is for retaliation's sake but if I love him there's no retaliation come on oh that that should have clicked with somebody right if I bless them the purpose of the cursing was to put me in a spot to where I retaliate with a curse but Jesus said amen don't clear some bless them you're derailing their whole plan I'll give you a small example you ever had anybody come in work or something like that and they are in a foul mood miserable they see you in the corner smiling and happy singing a song airpods in or some kind of thing listen to gospel music and you're going on or whatever and they see you like it and they do their best to make you miserable do you know that when they leave and you're still smiling their plan failed amen and yet at the very same time we must realize how significant it is to recognize it wasn't that person it was the devil that moved on that person how did he move maybe not at that exact moment maybe this is training or a background or years of a plan Satan's executed against a family sometimes people don't even realize the devil's behind a lot of the reasons why they do some of the stuff they do some families have little sayings and cliches among the family you know I'll just give you a simple one it's going to happen to anybody it's going to happen to the neurons but do you understand this is the reason Paul advised Timothy and give him counsel to say put away on wives tales and fables of a man like that and genealogies or the southern people y'all just better you better ban this this next part from the south they're going to kill me if I get up across that Mason Dixon and that's one problem we got down in the South so much that loyalty to family loyalty to family family loyalty uh-huh you know what that's done for a lot of them southern people down there I live with and was raised with it's made nothing but a bunch of arrogant buffoons out of them because they will they will strain a night and swallow a camel when it comes to sin because it's one of their family members amen but Jesus said amen if a man puts his hand to the plow and turns around for even one member of his family to me hell is not fitting for a person like that right it's too good for them God give you your Founders I tell my girls all the time you are my gifts and he is my Giver when they're grabbing my britches leg and they're screaming at me please and crying tears in their eyes please don't go please don't go I love Omen as much as humanly possible that I can love on them I tell them how much I they mean to me and how much I I think of them but I always remind them you are my gifts and I'm going to serve my Giver genealogies well that ain't the way my mama believed it they don't realize Satan the enemy has executed a very well-laid plan he laid that little seed bed about 40 Generations ago and they've kept it going to this very day and they won't let go of it to believe the word of God because it come from family just like that little story you hear sometimes it's kind of a little joke I guess and I don't mean it as a joke but just using an example about that lady that when she went to go do a Christmas ham she tried her big butcher knife and she cut the ends of it off and stuck it in that pan and cooked it up they were sitting down to eat and mom was there grandma was there and great grandma was there they're all having Thanksgiving supper or whatever they was having and and the youngest one spoke up and said Mama how do we cut the ends off this crazy hand I don't know ask your grandma she reaches across the table and takes her by the hands of Grandma why don't we cut the ends off his hands she said you know I'm not sure either honey great grandma's over here in the corner Let's go ask her they all gathered around she's sitting in a Barcalounger with a shawl up on her and then a blanket over her legs figure out how come we cut the ends of the ham off what does it mean what's the significance to it does it mean anything what's the purpose behind what kind of mystery does it hold in her Elder years she looked down upon all of them and said we were too poor to have a pan big enough to fit the ham we started cutting the ends off it so it fit in the pan and nobody ever told you all different how many Traditions family traditions have been handed down to us things that we do things that we believe things that we hold on to as gospel that ain't got to Speck of Bible or message behind them and yet we hold on to them not knowing our enemy has dispatched a well-laid plan because you see a thousand years to the devil means nothing Satan don't sleep you don't need a nap he don't need a vacation I'm hoping to God he has to take headache medicine when I get done with him but anyways Satan don't have to worry about time and the way we do is not created in such a manner so for him a thousand years is a blink of an eye nearly imagine watching all of the generations that made you knowing how you tick so to speak knowing the inner workings of your psyche your your watch if you will and laid that plan and they're knowing that it would catch generations of people well then here's the question as Believers with the baptism of the Holy Ghost at what point are we going to start doing what Jesus said then and that's cut the branches of this family tree all stop it right in its tracks and not allowed to proceed into our Natures into our speech into our thought patterns our thought life or any other spiritual part of us are natural you know for people that hate serpent seed and say there's no Bible to serpent seed and man wasn't no tree and the serpent wasn't no tree and yet they will pay a hundred and some dollars a month to get onto the internet to search out their family to read seems strange to me truth is always hiding in plain sight amen Jesus said so he'd hide it from the eyes otherwise and prude him and reveal it to babes such as would learn you are the fruit of your mother right and the seed of discrepancy brother said he sprayed his poison on them seeds back there in the Garden of Eden he said that's a reason why things are perverted today in a message we used to call it years ago hybrid religion but it's been renamed spoken words Original Seed as vocal Roots Original Seed brother Brands talks about the power of hybriding and what it meant to hybrid something together and how that Satan would take so much of this so much of that and hybrid until he forms his own church you imagine these people that and I feel sorry for these folks they go to the house of God and they shout and they'll run and they'll dance and they'll cry when they hear songs and they'll read the Bible and the joy will fill their heart and is lost and deceived as they can be not knowing that Satan was the one that orchestrated such a plan and when people fall into the realm of religion they've got to stop and think who is the enemy here and who is the hero in every story there is a hero and there's the anti-hero or the enemy God's story he is the hero of Life he's the hero of the Bride he's the hero of the Believers and Satan is the enemy that works against us our minds and everything we are our bodies you imagine the reason why we suffer things that we suffer in this body today is because Satan began working on the food system from the very beginning until he's got so much hybrid mess every which way you couldn't even eat organic food and not and it have the same effect that it would have 4 000 years ago people say glory to God I'll grow it out of the ground that ground you're growing it out of is just as perverted as the stuff you're getting at McDonald's all you say it's healthier it might be but it ain't going to stop you from dying and you better get that through your head before you get too overwhelmed with the things of this world bodily exercise profits a little we're looking for the gospel to take effect in our souls the body will change one day there's not enough multivitamins in this world to change what Satan's done there's not enough amen ice therapies or heat therapies or right you get the best exercises all of the peas the Seas the C's and the D's and put all the 40s and 30s next to him you want amen right out there and put any old kind of tag on what you want to do I'm not talking against health because I'm fat I'm saying that it's good but people too much put too much stock in things like that because they don't realize working in their mortal body is a bigger plan than they'll ever be able to solve the focus of our health and God help me when I say this big men like me shouldn't preach on these things it's almost hypocritical but the focus of our health should be Lord that I can give you the best quality years that I can give you truth of the matter is if God restored my health back the way I was when I was 18 I'd turn around and ruin it again for the gospel like I've done 20 years now beat my body up and down this country around these roads 60 70 80 000 miles a year that's just an automobile if I had good health I'd probably turn around and ruin it again all for the sake of the gospel and getting truth out but working in my members right now are things that I'll never be able to stop no just like I couldn't be stopped being born with that little English NORAD Viking nose just like you couldn't have stopped being born amen with all the characteristics and the features that come from your parents before you took the Breath of Life there was a plan a scheme laid out for humans just like you friends I hope the Digger the the the the deeper I dig down in this hole and the more helpless I make you feel that something raises up inside of you to recognize that's right brother man that's why we need the grace of God Amen and to surrender fully to the Lord in order to make it out of this world as Overcomers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the only hope we've got doing it on our own will never get us out of the spot that we've been placed in this is the principle Jesus is sharing with us love your enemies take your vitamins and do your health and get your smoothies and your shakes and do your px40s and all that other stuff fine but keep your focus upon I only do these things so that I can be a blessing to the people of God and I can have good health for my family or something like that never get in your mind that there's anything we can do to fix ourselves that's in the natural what about emotional some people maybe even sitting in this room I don't know maybe listen online you can read a stack of these emotional self-help books like that right there you're never going to solve your problems by reading them books you might understand yourself better you might understand maybe the plan that's been set for you but once you see what's wrong with you and what's broken about you the only hope you've got after that is to take all of that Brokenness up and put it in the hands of almighty God it's a well-laid plan brother Jesse this is why I Must Love My Enemy turn my cheek to those that smack me and those that despitefully use me pray for him this is what Jesus is saying in other words you're powerless to fight on that side of it there's a quotation here they asked brother Brennan how to overcome a stubborn spirit and things like that and I've read this as Church thousand times I I I I don't mean to sound like a broken record but for whatever reason when I come back to Akron the Holy Ghost puts it right back in my nose somehow but in this very quotation he said I've met thousands that had that Spirit on the platform by discernment he said go back and find a father a grandmother grandmother somebody that had that kind of spirit you inherit it he said the only way to overcome it is take the opposite they asked brother rettenham you know how what do I do if I'm not one little selfish brat that wants their way all the time he said turn around do the opposite foreign yourself now he said if you want to hold everything you got turn on and give it back the other way what's he trying to show us not that we should be if you had a multitude of riches in your bank account doesn't mean start selling your cars and your stocks and your bonds and giving out every poor man you see on the street and taking the shirt off your back and living like a popper no no no we had a man like that many years ago at the church he just got started in the message and and um he was doing really pretty good and he'd trying to serve the Lord and be a real Christian and he hit a spot where he told he got all the brothers together and he said I want to tell you he said I just want everything out of my life that's not like the Lord and before counseling with anybody he said he was a very wealthy man he's a car dealer and things like that he made a lot of money selling cars businesses all over the state of Tennessee and things this individual absolutely stood there and told us Brethren I'm selling everything I've got half of it's already gone and before the years out I'll be a total popper in an effort to serve the Lord that's foolish thank God my pastor at the time brother Carol told him so he said that you don't have to do those things to be spiritual that's right if you're that one selfish little brat about giving away the thing of it is is not turn around and become a pauper yourself but it's the attitude that you would have about what you've got now listen carefully that talk about physical money to use it as an example of other things let's say you're a musician like me or a singer or a player or you've got other skills and things that you can do Jesse's a a god-called teacher on top of being a pastor and a minister of the Gospel you take his boy back there his talent is growing every time I hear this kid he's got something new that he's put into his music and I like it but you take these kind of gifts and you take these things that God vests in US eventually the seed line starts working on a man or woman arrogance and pride or some other kind of thing even the opposite of it being real downcast and real sad and that put on humility somebody compliments your watches I'm rotten no good I'm a spare tire quit lying you know you like what you're here and act like it say thank you be gracious move on oh hi hi I'm just not yeah I'm sure you can't call the comment folks and the point being is that if we're not careful we'll start holding on because of some thing in US I know many many gifted preachers that refused to get out of their barca lounger and put their sweet tea or their Cola down and go get themselves on a plane and go preach in a foreign country because they're not willing to go into that kind of environment good preachers and I've sat around the table and listen and say oh you ain't gonna get me on a plane like that why is it because you're the one selfish little brat that wants your way or maybe you said something to say Lord maybe I should surround and give everything I got go get on a plane and go preach to some people in the forecast there's many ways to look at this folks and you mind you at the time would expire before I'd even have a chance to even scratch it not even scratch it but again I'll just put that little blank in there and you can fill it in the way you see it Satan can use those very things against you and listen to quotation brother I said take some sister she gets saved she grows her hair out she looks in the mirror and all of a sudden she says man my hair I look I look beautiful he said then Satan jump on the other side and try to put Pride on her I said that's right you do don't you see what I'm trying to say to you is that the very persecuted elect her persecution don't always come with tanks running down the street and mushroom clouds all over the place I know people got this in their mind that the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to see such things as that those in the tribulation will experience some of the worst Horrors that Hollywood could never even put it on a screen there's not enough CGI power to demonstrate what's going to hit this Earth when the bride is taken out of here but you listen to me right now amen no man that loves his wife will put her through hell on Earth to try to prove her when he's already proven who she is the bride does not go through the tribulation period amen they'll never shut up God will take her out of here amen run out of here in the Rapture like Romeo and Juliet he'll take her in the middle of the nines people in the message building bomb shelters and stocking up on K rations and water and every time Walmart has a sale they go out with you know out of Sam's Club with carts of it getting ready for the tribulation period squeeze is coming they'll say well good for them I'm not planning to prepare them for a squeeze I'm planning on being popped out of here squeeze all right like when you're holding onto the soap to tight in the shower and it goes right out of your hand amen squeeze all right I'm preparing to get out of here well brother Ben don't you think we'll see any of the Crossovers so we might see some of the beginning influence of it but the bride does not go through tribulation and persecution of that sort she never will and it's not in God's plan for her too listen let me read that to you in the Feast of the trumpets remember said you said the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it he said the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride he said see a man has found favor with his wife he don't puts her through a lot he put her through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace a mother and she found Grace with him right he said but notice oh I like this he said notice he said the persecution that struck those Jews during the opening of that Sixth Seal it came from the literal standpoint he said but to the Bride of the last state of come in the ecclesiastical standpoint all of those two hundred thousand thousand Horsemen that come out of the river Euphrates being led by their leaders Eichmann Stalin Mussolini and Hitler those four Angels loosed out of Euphrates River those same four spirits that attack the elect of God same for enemies remember even the church is led by four spirits the lamb the lion the ox and the Flying Eagle don't ever put that eagle on the ground he's a flying boy at a a good pastor friend of mine many many years ago brother Frank Prater was asking the church I was sitting on the front row and you see when you when you when you study a lot and I know you know a lot these guys like to catch you and things that they think you don't know he said what kind of Eagle was it and I said he was an eagle no brother Ben I'm ashamed of you I said what do you mean he said it was a flying eagle he wasn't EarthBound those same four living Spirits as living creatures lead the Bride of Jesus Christ Matthew Mark Luke and John leader straight to the book of Acts the salmon awnings was given to combat the four evil spirits and watch those four anointings headed themselves up in these evil men look at what they've done to them Jews during that second World War unimaginable things that people don't even like to talk about to this day and that same anointing has now moved again in the last day but on the bride it comes through the ecclesiastical standpoint now what does that mean let's hit that before we go home or go to supper I should say or go to dinner anyway in the South it's dinner time it ain't summer time it's dinner time will you say to lunch because I'm from Ohio it's at lunch but I was raised by Southern people I'll never tell a good Southerner that you get to have lunch I don't know what you're talking about but the ecclesiastical part is this it is the approach of man's Wisdom mixed with God's word sometimes that's conscious sometimes that's unconscious take some of these great preachers in the day I mentioned a few of them Jakes and Hagee and Osteen and you know I I like these guys I got no problem with them I'm not throwing off but they all have an agenda and they're all very visible and they all say very you know positive things you know this is my hour of power Jakes will say Osteen will hold up his Bible I am you know this is my Bible I am what it says I am that's true a lot of these things are good psychologically speaking they hit the mark for people that are hungry for answers right now you listen to me careful little bride of Jesus Christ if you claim to be the bride indeed you are if you are God's child the bride doesn't seek for quick rapid answers in line She lays in the fire for a long time answerless sometimes waiting on God's revelation of why they went through it in the first place we'll say this before we quit the world is looking for an explanation to things and it hurts them so bad when they really meet the Creator I mean really meeting and he basically tells them it ain't none of your concern right now I'll let you know when I want to let you know are my people passing from this life you know my my daddy I lost daddy be five years this August I didn't lose him I know right reside but when they go from you it hurts so badly and you think to yourself man I I wish this and I wish that and I think of ten thousand things that I wished I'd have done even better when my dad was living you know he died at 83 had a list of health problems like that the man liked to die 25 times through all the time running up here to Ohio come to see him because he wound up in the hospital again another dementia case another UTI another they found him out walking in the neighborhood didn't know what planet he was on and carried him over to the hospital and stuff like that but you know the Lord give me a consolation I got to thinking you know Lord when you took this man you didn't send me an email or a fax or a text you didn't sit down and carrier pigeon with a little note tied to his leg hey is it okay with you if I make this move in life God don't always tell us everything remember what he said even with Joseph down there in Egypt mind you here's Jacob this prophet of God we're talking about one of the prophets that God built the entire foundation of the Old Testament upon read the Masterpiece he's one of the corners of the great statue that God would build up he said the Four Corners that little block you know they set that statue on top he said you got Joseph and Jacob and these ones here's Jacob holding onto that coat for many many years thinking his boy was dead and brother Adam said see God don't tell us prophets everything he don't tell us everything now listen to this carefully please don't fail what I'm getting ready to say but let's say for example some of you in here are seeking for the Holy Ghost I don't know I'm just feeling led to say thanks so I'm going to save them I hope they land correctly and if they don't then God help me say them will they'll land that way but for those of you seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost for seeking that real genuine experience from God your trigger point the thing that's going to lose you and give you the freedom you need to get there you're going to have to stop holding on to this God I need an explanation before I can give myself to you God don't have to explain to you why life has been bad God is not obligated to tell us why hell is broke around us and why people were mean to us and why life has been one Misery after another or why you never had a leg up or why you couldn't have been God don't ask an explanation he's not obligated to tell us why but on the other side of that this is where real humility comes in where we should get on our face before God and say God I don't know why but you are the reason that I even have a mind to even think it or consider it you are the reason why I am what I am and I give myself to you I don't need an answer I just need your grace Hallelujah I just need you to take the reins and overcome for me you listen to me I'm preaching to myself right here too sometimes as a minister especially with the message is readily available especially with the concordances and the books and the electronic and you can get on and and you know Google's a smart fella did you know that he's a pretty smart guy Google is a scientist Google is a doctor Mr Google is a husband a wife a cousin Mr Google is a physicist Mr Google knows how to shoot guns he knows how to do all kinds of things very smart fella got a lot of phds next to his name but you know my biggest problem with him a lot of the information he yields up ain't surrendered to the Lord he just throws everything in the bucket and leaves it for you to sort it out that reminds me the way the devil does us throws everything in our way and tries to get us to sort it out again and I say it in the name of the Lord It's a well-laid plan for you that Satan would put it in your pathway that you've got to figure things out before you can become surrendered hogwash foolishness nonsense and ain't nothing but a trap of the devil and I believe the Holy Ghost has exposed it this morning you should throw it in the trash can get rid of that over a ridiculous rotten thank you and start surrendering yourself on a daily basis and you watch and see if I speak in the name of the Lord your life will prosper over the one but once you do what I'm saying I'll speak it to you in the name of the Lord sure but the analytical mind wants to know yeah inquiring inquire the magazine Inquirer had that same idea inquiring minds want to know isn't that amazing as a preacher I need to know things sometimes sure I was telling the brother the other day that I got a friend of mine and this fella I love him God knows I love his God but he does this kind of stuff to me so-and-so had an affair with so-and-so and shot so and so and so-and-so robbed a bank but I ain't going to tell you no names I don't want to get any and I told this other friend of mine he's a mutual acquaintances of the brother we were talking about this thing and I said yeah it drives me crazy too I said to me if you're going to go that much into detail you better give me a name because now I'm wondering which person you're talking about I got 40 just like them I know could be potential suspects of what you just said tell me your name or don't tell me at all but you know that's okay as a minister sometimes you need to know those that labor among you you need to know what they're all about pastors have to be nosy sometimes people I know you don't like it but they got to be and when you see a pastor Like Jesse you see Jesse asking questions or digging into your life quit sitting there getting insulted at him be thankful that your Shepherd cares enough about you to try to figure out a plan because you see a real Pastor takes information and he goes to God with it and say lord it's a puzzle for me and I don't have a picture on the box I don't know how to put these pieces together but I've done my best to try to do my homework to find out what I can about this person so that I know how to approach their problems now that happens sometimes you got to make inquiries and ask people questions oh God Almighty people get so mad at you but if they care about you sometimes they need to ask a question sometimes they got to know but then as you know brother Smith there are times that his ministry that you avoid asking the questions because sometimes people will lie right to your face you know what I do sometimes I go to alone I go to a very lonely place or a quiet place I'm trying to say not lonely but quiet and alone place with God and I start talking to the Lord about that person and God will show me something about them something they said a word they said nobody would have ever picked up including me on that word meaning what it meant but God will take that one thing and show me 40 things about their life and I know how to approach them I know how to deal with them and other things they're saying not to say I've had people say to me through the years and I don't mean this an exalted way but I'm just being truthful and saying that it's like it is I've had people say to me I can't believe you dealt with so and so how did you know because I'd spent a lot of time in prayer about them I didn't just willy-nilly go talk to them I spent a lot of time talking to the Lord about him and God show me approaches and how to say things now they're always that way God I wish it was a lot of times I'd save myself a lot of trouble if I would have just you know and waited on the Lord about it but sometimes as a preacher you got to know but then there's been times or I'll go to the Lord and ask about a situation and God will just look at me you know what I've learned to do if it's not for me to know then I'll let you do your job because I figure big as he is smart as he is intelligent as he is good as he is I figured there's something I need to know he'll probably tell me and I probably don't even have to ask him they just tell me when it's time analytical thinkers you linear people in this room I'm eyeballing you wherever you may be don't get so hung up in that that when it comes to God you have to get 42 questions solved before the Lord can move for you all you do is assassinate your faith that's all you do this Faith don't come by what you see or hear faith comes by faith hearing the word of God believing things that you don't see things that you don't hear things that you don't understand one of the first tests that I believe God put on me when I was a young Christian I just come out of the water being baptized I was still sitting on the blankets of the towels I want more that come out of the water who's riding home and the Holy Spirit my mom and dad was in the front car and the Holy Spirit had spoke to me my Bible was laying over at the sidelight and uh and I had stuck it Over Yonder you don't want to sit in the car and the Lord supported me told me get my Bible and I grabbed it and pulled it over and as I held up my hand the Lord said open and I opened it up and felt Isaiah 34. come near you Nations here in Harkin for the ignination of the Lord is upon his armies and the fury upon the Nations and it went on just a little bit and the Lord said now stop tell me what you think it means and I I said to the Lord as purely and as innocently as sweetly as I could say the only thing I knew to say to him but Lord said even if you get it figured out you still might be wrong I don't know what I would say to you about it Lord It's Your word you know what's truth I don't you know for 25 years that thing bothered me I wondered why did he ask me that way what was it about I asked many different preachers about the scripture itself tried to look it up in the message run around never even read from that chapter I wandered and wanted and wanted until one day I was preaching and I was preaching about this very thing that sometimes God just wants to see if you're willing to not put your own thoughts in your own mind but just surrender and let him have his way and while I was preaching that the Lord put that story back in my heart and I shared it with the people and it come open to me just as clear as a bell he was testing me at the very beginning because he knew he was going to call me just about a week or so later to call me to preach I mean I'm talking I'm still wet with river water and he's calling me to preach but he wanted to see when it comes to the word am I going to use my mind and my thoughts or am I going to trust his judgment and you know what's saved me from many a problem and I'm pretty sure you could say Amen to this too is just trusting him to know what's right and not put my own mind to the situation stand with me God bless us bow our heads for just a moment brother come to the music Lord Jesus as we stand here in your divine presence I just want to say how thankful I Am Lord I've had the privilege this morning to be able to speak to the little body of Christ here in Akron Lord how we're so grateful and so thankful for everything you do so happy Lord to know you and the power of your resurrection and now father I pray that the words that have been spoken here may they be drove down into the hearts Lord ever what they need to do to take root you're pleased with it Lord I pray you'll let it just come to fruition I pray you'll let the spirit of God so move upon the lives of your people the Lord it will bring change throughout the people of this congregation for the pastor all the way down to the evangelist may you change us for the better changes for the good love our enemies Bless The Curse do good the persecute and sell manner of evil help us Lord we're not going to be able to do that unless we realize what the big plan what the big picture is help us Lord to see the great scheme behind it all so Lord we can see what's true and what's right thank you for speaking to us Lord I myself have been greatly edified by what you said today and I trust the people will even tripled that quadrupled at 100 fold that May the words has been spoken May ever be a blessing now as we commit
