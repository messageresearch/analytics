[33:23] desire Thank You brothers to appreciate

[33:34] make some music and it doesn't matter if
[33:37] you're small or large it's what matters
[33:39] is that the Spirit of the Lord is there

[33:44] revelations chapter three at verse 20
[33:49] it's good to be here to see y'all again
[33:51] and greet y'all from back home in Albion
[33:55] Pennsylvania brother Jim sends his
[33:57] greetings and all the all the saints
[33:59] with him
[34:00] hey ma'am been a while since I've
[34:06] ministered so bear with me this morning
[34:09] thank you brother bear with me I might
[34:14] be a little bit nervous here and there I
[34:16] wasn't nervous so much until I stepped
[34:19] out but we always want to be reverent
[34:24] and in handling the Word of God and I
[34:28] just want to I just want to do the best
[34:31] that I can to help you all to be a
[34:33] blessing to you y'all know brother Diggs
[34:36] very well I'm sure you've heard brother
[34:38] cadre he preached a message one time
[34:40] blessed to be a blessing and that's
[34:43] something that's stuck in my mind as a
[34:45] I'm blessed and if I'm blessed I want to
[34:48] be a blessing unto you so let us read
[34:52] here in galatians chapter 3 verse 20 it
[34:58] says behold
[34:59] I stand at the door and knock If any man
[35:03] hear my voice and open the door I will
[35:06] come in to him and will sup with him and
[35:10] he with me brother Brennan have talked
[35:14] about a painting of Jesus knocking on a
[35:18] door he says when the great artist
[35:22] painted the picture of Jesus knocking at
[35:24] the at the door he says any picture
[35:27] before it can become a famous picture it
[35:29] has to go through the Hall of critics
[35:31] the people who are famous artists
[35:34] artists are the ones who criticize the
[35:36] picture that's that's kind of how I feel
[35:39] like preaching this morning all the all
[35:41] the critics all the good preachers are
[35:43] going to be criticizing me now I just
[35:47] think a lot of brother Jesse and just
[35:50] appreciate the invitation
[35:53] he says they find all the flaws that's
[35:55] in it you might find flaws in me this
[35:58] morning but we're going to we're going
[35:59] to press on anyways that we're all human
[36:02] beings we all make mistakes but that's
[36:04] not my intention my intention is not to
[36:08] come and deliberately teach you
[36:11] something false so that is not my
[36:14] intention and that that's that's the way
[36:18] the world is is that they're looking at
[36:21] your life so much they're looking at
[36:23] every angle every aspect every word
[36:26] every action every reaction and they're
[36:29] criticizing that they're going to
[36:31] criticize to see if you were living up
[36:33] to it up to your confession
[36:37] so after this famous picture had went
[36:40] through practically the hall of critics
[36:42] it was asked the man who give the
[36:45] painting a critic said there's just one
[36:49] thing that I could find wrong with your
[36:50] picture
[36:51] he says you have forgotten to put the
[36:54] latch on the door and the one that
[36:58] painted the painting said oh no you
[37:01] misunderstand
[37:03] that's what hid his a lot in this days
[37:05] is misunderstanding you misunderstand
[37:09] if the latch was on the outside he would
[37:12] raise the latch
[37:13] go in but the latches on the inside the
[37:17] person inside must lift the latch and
[37:21] that's the way it is with Jesus with all
[37:24] of his mercy and all of his compassion
[37:27] yet you are the person that will let him
[37:31] in or keep him out
[37:35] you have the latch on your side this
[37:40] isn't just a one-sided thing this is a
[37:42] two-part thing a relationship a marriage
[37:45] is not one-sided it takes two it's a
[37:50] partnership yes but what would a man
[37:54] knock at another man's door for he said
[37:58] what would be the reason why it's to
[38:01] gain entrance he wants to come in he
[38:04] wants he's got something that he wants
[38:07] to talk about or something to show you
[38:09] there's a reason why a person is
[38:12] knocking on a door it's not just an
[38:14] empty just knocking and we used to play
[38:17] the game when we were younger you knock
[38:18] on the door and run you know it's not
[38:20] something in vain but there's a purpose
[38:22] to the knocking when someone knocks at
[38:27] your door they want to they want to come
[38:31] in there wanting to gain entrance or
[38:33] little fellowship or something to talk
[38:36] to you about that's the reason Jesus
[38:38] knocked at the door
[38:40] I remember in revelation 3:20 what we
[38:44] read he says behold I stand at the door
[38:46] and knock so he's knocking and If any
[38:49] man hear my voice and open the door
[38:53] remember the latches on the inside
[38:55] you're the one who is able to open it or
[38:58] close it in this situation you are the
[39:00] one who's able to open or close to allow
[39:02] him to come in or to keep him out it's
[39:05] your decision and then he says I will
[39:09] come in to him and sup with him and be
[39:12] with me so he wants to have fellowship
[39:14] with you let's look to the Lord this
[39:18] most gracious have any fathers just a
[39:23] great privilege to to come and be able
[39:25] to stand behind this pulpit once again
[39:27] and Lord as I I see myself as a as a
[39:31] human as a man of mortal flesh not
[39:34] worthy to stand here before your
[39:35] children and Lord that is so true
[39:38] because you are the one who bought them
[39:40] with the price Oh God you were the one
[39:42] who is worthy you were the one who is
[39:44] almighty and Lord you were the one that
[39:46] we were looking to this morning and my
[39:48] trust is in you this morning it's not a
[39:50] my own ability Lord the only ability I
[39:53] have is to be able to read and and and
[39:55] write I could read the words on the page
[39:57] but you were the one who quickens it to
[40:00] the minds and to the hearts of the
[40:01] people this morning father
[40:03] so lord I just want to come Lord if this
[40:06] is the last message I ever preached I
[40:08] want to do I want to do the best that I
[40:11] can I want to empty out nor God what
[40:13] you've laid on my heart I want to I want
[40:16] to show that this is a serious time and
[40:18] and Lord we want to take time to give
[40:20] you reverence this morning and Lord I
[40:21] want to respect your word with every
[40:23] fiber that's in me Oh God
[40:25] I mean not the toy with your word by any
[40:27] means I don't I don't mean to use it in
[40:30] any malicious way Lord God you know my
[40:32] heart I just want to be here and bless
[40:34] your people father as we read through
[40:36] this scripture this morning and through
[40:39] the different things and the thoughts
[40:40] that you bring to my mind my heart and
[40:42] and lord I pray that you would give me
[40:43] guidance to know what to speak and and
[40:45] when to close my mouth Lord God and and
[40:47] lord I just pray that you would help my
[40:49] spirit to yield when I needed you and
[40:51] lord I just want you to have preeminence
[40:53] this morning but father it's you that we
[40:55] want to see this morning and Jesus
[40:57] Christ name we do pray father we also
[41:00] ask that you would be with brother
[41:01] Jeremy Lord as he's ministering back at
[41:03] the home church and now Lord the first
[41:05] time that he's ministered outside his
[41:08] home church we just pray that you would
[41:09] give him strength and Lord ease he's
[41:11] mentioned that he's been real nervous
[41:13] and my lord putting our trust in you now
[41:17] I just pray that you you would do or he
[41:19] would do just that put his trust in you
[41:21] this morning that you would lead him and
[41:22] guide him and bless the people at the
[41:24] home church the Lord the Lord we're here
[41:28] this morning we want to concentrate and
[41:29] focus what's what's being said and
[41:31] what's being done and what's being led
[41:33] here father we give you praise and glory
[41:36] and honor and Jesus Christ name we do
[41:38] pray amen
[41:39] thank you may be seated and I'm gonna go
[41:43] ahead and get comfortable since this is
[41:45] the first time I've been been here oh
[41:49] now sent you off cordially oh you always
[41:52] treat me my family very well and it's
[41:58] wonderful to see familiar faces again
[42:00] hey man sir let's turn to John chapter
[42:05] 10 and verse 1 what I'd like to speak on
[42:16] this morning is accessing the door and
[42:24] John 10 verse 1
[42:28] sometimes I go real fast so I'm gonna
[42:31] try and slow down today and I hope it's
[42:32] not too long I do have a lot of material
[42:35] but I just want to try to take my time
[42:39] no amen verily verily I say unto you he
[42:45] that entereth not by the door into the
[42:50] sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[42:52] the same as a thief and a robber but he
[42:57] that entered in by the door is the
[42:59] Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter
[43:04] openeth and the sheep hear his voice and
[43:07] he calleth his own sheep by a name and
[43:11] leadeth them out does anybody ever
[43:14] wonder about that scripture because in
[43:18] our mind
[43:19] most of us here have been born in
[43:22] America and we have an American thought
[43:25] process we have an American culture that
[43:32] tends to if we don't research or if we
[43:36] don't have any kind of education on how
[43:40] they used to do things we look at it
[43:41] from an American standpoint and if
[43:44] you're born in the city you're really
[43:47] lost
[43:47] [Laughter]
[43:50] because if you don't it there there are
[43:53] a lot of people that have never seen a
[43:55] cow or a sheep or a goat or anything so
[43:59] they don't know the nature of those
[44:01] types of animals they don't know how to
[44:03] take care of those animals they don't
[44:05] know the work that goes into raising
[44:09] those animals they just don't know those
[44:12] aspects of it unless they do some kind
[44:15] of reading or they take a field trip out
[44:18] into the country and and speak to
[44:20] somebody who actually does the job
[44:22] they're not going to know so if we have
[44:25] the mind frame this morning if you read
[44:27] some background you get to see what the
[44:30] Shepherd does what a porter does now
[44:32] back if if they would have in the city
[44:35] or in the town they would have a Corral
[44:39] where shepherds could come and they
[44:43] would have a public place where they
[44:44] could water the Sheep or they would have
[44:49] a place to put the sheep so they can go
[44:51] in and and in the town and get whatever
[44:53] they need and then they can come back
[44:55] out and see the porter so the porter is
[44:59] pretty much the gate to the corral they
[45:01] would come and talk to the porter so the
[45:03] porter would recognize the Shepherd it's
[45:07] kind of like dry cleaning you ever take
[45:09] clothes to the dry cleaner you take your
[45:11] clothes in you get a little tag you go
[45:13] to pick up your clothes you got to give
[45:14] your tag to show that that's that's your
[45:16] property so the same thing the porter is
[45:20] not going to open up just to anybody
[45:22] he's going to have to recognize who the
[45:24] Shepherd is and when the Shepherd
[45:26] gathers his sheep he just the the Sheep
[45:29] just recognizes they recognize his voice
[45:32] so if another shepherd comes in or a
[45:35] stranger if he happens to get in they're
[45:38] not going to hear anyone elses voice but
[45:41] their Shepherd and that's how they
[45:44] gather their sheep and that's what this
[45:46] scripture is talking about the porter
[45:48] will open up to the Shepherd the
[45:50] Shepherd goes in and he calls his sheep
[45:52] they recognize his voice and they will
[45:55] gather unto Him only and only him there
[45:59] could be many voices going on but
[46:00] they're only going to go to
[46:02] that one voice and then when he gathers
[46:05] him up then they can go so that's kind
[46:10] of a background behind that verse for
[46:13] you you might know that already I don't
[46:15] know I don't know what you know and when
[46:20] he put it forth his own sheep he goeth
[46:23] before them and the Sheep follow him for
[46:26] they know his voice and a stranger they
[46:29] will will they not follow but will flee
[46:32] from him for they know not the voice of
[46:35] strangers this parable spake Jesus unto
[46:39] them but they understood not what the
[46:42] things what things they were which he
[46:45] spake unto them then jesus said unto
[46:48] them again verily verily I say unto you
[46:51] I am the door of the Sheep now Jesus
[47:02] proclaimed several phrases of I am I was
[47:08] trying to research it yesterday but I I
[47:10] was going to try to count how many times
[47:12] it's between five and seven I can't
[47:14] remember something like that it might be
[47:16] six seven I can't remember but uh I
[47:19] didn't want to get distracted I had to
[47:22] get back on course
[47:24] sometimes you know how that is you start
[47:28] thinking about something well I'm not
[47:29] that's not my focus today so I have to I
[47:32] get derailed pretty easy when I'm
[47:34] studying but he said I am several times
[47:38] and then I think of one when he's
[47:42] talking about communion people often
[47:46] wonder about communion when he was
[47:47] talking about in the scripture where he
[47:49] said you must eat my flesh and drink my
[47:51] blood and and they were thinking of well
[47:55] this is vampire you know this now I
[47:58] can't think of what they cannibalize 'im
[48:01] but what did he say it in order to have
[48:04] eat his flesh he says I am the bread of
[48:07] life he says I am manna so he proclaimed
[48:10] that I am the bread of life and then you
[48:13] must drink my blood he says I am the
[48:15] vine
[48:15] you are the branches right so we kind of
[48:18] see his possessive stake there of what
[48:22] is personal to him of what authority he
[48:25] has but he here he's saying I am the
[48:29] door of the Sheep
[48:31] now in kind of going back with the
[48:34] corral in the in the town if they were
[48:37] out in the country they didn't have that
[48:39] Corral so he would have to the Shepherd
[48:41] we would have to make a makeshift Corral
[48:44] whether it be out of rocks and I think
[48:46] they typically use briars from the top
[48:48] so nothing would get in it's kind of
[48:50] like concertina wire on something that's
[48:52] being protected like a prison so nobody
[48:56] could get out I don't know if it's
[48:59] protected to keep people from getting in
[49:01] I don't know if I'd want to fight to get
[49:03] into a prison but as to keep them from
[49:06] getting out but what the Shepherd would
[49:09] do is he would lay in the doorway so
[49:15] that's why the Shepherd would become the
[49:17] door because the Sheep will not go in or
[49:20] out unless it goes through the Shepherd
[49:22] because the Shepherd becomes the gate so
[49:27] he says I am the door so he's in the
[49:29] doorway nobody you're not going to get
[49:31] into the sheepfold except through him he
[49:33] says I am the door by Me If any man
[49:37] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[49:40] in and out and find pasture the thief
[49:43] cometh not but for to steal and to kill
[49:47] and to destroy he says I am come that
[49:51] they might have life and that they might
[49:55] have it more abundantly he says I am The
[49:59] Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd
[50:01] his life for the Sheep I'd like to talk
[50:06] a little bit about keys here for a
[50:07] minute does everybody know it a key is
[50:11] and what a key does a key allows
[50:19] access to what is locked out to others
[50:22] signifying that there is something
[50:24] valuable on the inside it's there's
[50:27] something worthwhile behind that door
[50:29] there's something worthwhile that you
[50:31] want to keep locked up to keep other
[50:33] people out of but it might also be
[50:36] something that would something that
[50:39] would be dangerous to keep unqualified
[50:43] people on as a maintenance mechanic I
[50:47] have we have special keys that allow us
[50:50] into what's we call it a TLB but it's a
[50:53] it's like a substation it's where we
[50:54] have our we control all of our power our
[50:58] high high-voltage power and if somebody
[51:02] unauthorised was to get in there they
[51:05] could they could cause devastation that
[51:08] if they don't know what their they're
[51:10] doing they could switch turn switches
[51:13] and
[51:14] push buttons and it would cause chaos
[51:17] for our product for our manufacturing it
[51:20] would cause interruption but if they're
[51:23] not wearing proper gear there's so much
[51:26] high voltage if they were to throw a
[51:28] switch it could cause harm and be fatal
[51:32] so there's there's also a restriction of
[51:35] why doors would be locked to to keep
[51:37] people safe
[51:39] it gives authority to person to a person
[51:43] to enter or to attain or receive there's
[51:48] no way no other way into my house if I
[51:51] if you don't have the key to my house
[51:53] you're not going to get in but if you do
[51:56] get in without my permission you are
[51:59] breaking in so that makes you a thief
[52:05] and a robber is that right now we have
[52:09] secret passwords or special code little
[52:15] knocks when you were younger you might
[52:17] do and you know the siblings you know
[52:22] which sibling it was and you say you can
[52:26] come in or or get away from me you know
[52:28] depending on which sibling you wanted to
[52:30] talk to hey
[52:32] I was a youngest so most times I wasn't
[52:38] let in because I didn't have that I
[52:41] didn't have the special special code my
[52:46] mind goes to judges where they were
[52:50] having that the the the battle I want to
[52:52] say it was JEP JEP though maybe
[52:57] but as they asked they were they were
[53:00] protecting the bridge and they were they
[53:03] were asking people if they wanted to
[53:05] cross the bridge well are you from
[53:06] such-and-such and if they said yeah they
[53:08] would tell him what you're gonna have to
[53:10] say say this word I think it was like a
[53:12] Shibboleth or something like that and
[53:14] they couldn't pronounce it so that's how
[53:16] they caught those people and they slew
[53:19] him you know they were trying to pretend
[53:21] to be somebody that they weren't and
[53:22] trying to gain access where they didn't
[53:24] belong but we have padlocks and we have
[53:27] locks now if you know how a key works I
[53:32] don't have one on hand but if you look
[53:35] at a key it has special little cutouts
[53:37] and when you put it in to the cylinder
[53:41] it has to meet a certain code you have
[53:43] tumblers on on the inside that are
[53:45] Springs spring-loaded so it's going to
[53:48] lift those tumblers to a certain code to
[53:51] give you access of that special key so
[53:54] if you look at your key you're looking
[53:56] at a code so just because your house key
[54:02] is not going to open a refrigerator key
[54:04] or a vending machine key because there
[54:07] are different types of keys your key to
[54:12] your diary is not going to open a bank
[54:14] vault right so you see the extremes and
[54:19] you see the the simple to the complex a
[54:21] diary lock is actually very easily
[54:24] picked to where a bank vault is very
[54:27] complex because they've had to they've
[54:30] had to make many advances in that
[54:32] because people were gaining it was so
[54:35] easy for people to get into it so they
[54:37] had to make it more complex now as I
[54:40] said a natural lock could be picked I
[54:44] highly recommend
[54:45] you leave here don't go buy a set of
[54:48] lock picks because if you carry lock
[54:49] picks with you and the police happen to
[54:52] pull you over talk to you and find out
[54:55] that you have lock picks you will be
[54:57] arrested because you are not allowed to
[55:00] carry lock picks unless you are
[55:02] authorized to do so
[55:03] whether it be a locksmith or or somebody
[55:06] else that has authorization carry lock
[55:08] picks because they are going to
[55:09] automatically be suspicious and think
[55:12] that you're planning on breaking into
[55:14] somebody's home whether you say I'm a
[55:17] Christian I wouldn't do that they're
[55:20] they hear all kinds of excuses they're
[55:23] not going to listen to it but so if
[55:26] somebody like I said if you broke into
[55:28] my house that makes you a thief and a
[55:30] robber so the natural types the
[55:32] spiritual if you were breaking in to
[55:35] somebody's house that means that you
[55:37] don't have authority to be there so
[55:40] jesus said if I am the door if any man
[55:43] comes any other way he is a thief and a
[55:46] robber and the same thing happens in the
[55:50] natural what happens if you break into
[55:52] somebody's house or you're somewhere
[55:54] where you don't have the authority to be
[55:55] you're probably going to get arrested
[55:58] and you're going to go where there are
[56:00] more locks and the same thing with the
[56:06] spiritual if you are where you're not
[56:10] supposed to be and I'm trying to think
[56:12] of that scripture where the the man went
[56:17] into the wedding supper and he didn't
[56:18] have the right wedding garment on he was
[56:21] kicked out of that wedding because he
[56:23] did not belong so if you try to get to
[56:25] heaven if you try to get to Christ some
[56:27] other way you're a thief and a robber
[56:31] amen so he also said that there were
[56:36] many before him and they were thieves
[56:39] and robbers because they were trying to
[56:41] portray themselves as something they
[56:43] were not they were not authorized that
[56:47] they did not have the authority to make
[56:49] that kind of a profession that there
[56:52] were many false christs I didn't say
[56:54] many false Jesus's but there were many
[56:55] false Christ's
[56:56] there were many false anointed ones that
[56:58] might
[56:59] look so pretty they might have looked
[57:01] like it fit the picture but not quite
[57:04] it was counterfeit it looked just like
[57:06] the real but it was not quite it might
[57:09] fit almost fit the code but not quite
[57:14] almost but not there but just because
[57:20] people say that they identify as
[57:21] something doesn't mean that they are
[57:23] that always remember watch the life of
[57:27] that person now having a key it might
[57:31] show authority to be somewhere to a
[57:34] specific a specific place of where
[57:37] you're trying to gain access but just
[57:39] because you have a key it doesn't mean
[57:41] that you have access like I was saying
[57:43] that there are special keys you have to
[57:45] have the right key with knowledge of how
[57:48] to use it I'm sure the little ones back
[57:53] there probably don't know how to use a
[57:55] combination lock there might be some
[57:59] other some adults here that don't know
[58:01] how to use a combination lock so you
[58:04] have to have the knowledge of how to use
[58:06] that specific key but there are many
[58:11] kinds of keys as we said of whether it's
[58:14] to a house or a church or to your car so
[58:17] we have that this might sound confusing
[58:19] for a minute but but let it sink in
[58:22] there false doctrines and false
[58:26] teachings there are false doctrines and
[58:30] right teachings there could be but it's
[58:35] not quite is that right there are right
[58:40] doctrines and there are right teachings
[58:43] there are right doctrines and false
[58:46] teachings so you can have false in the
[58:48] right but they have to come to a mesh
[58:51] they have to meet a certain code let me
[58:55] give you an example teaching on how to
[58:58] apply doctrine doctrines are your
[59:02] substance in order for us
[59:07] lightly divided the Word of God we need
[59:10] a right teaching let's see it a right
[59:13] teaching would be you need to be
[59:15] baptized that's a right teaching now you
[59:18] can have a wrong doctrine you need to be
[59:23] baptized in the name of the Father Son
[59:25] and the Holy Ghost that's a wrong
[59:27] doctrine with a right teaching now on
[59:30] the flip side on the other side you can
[59:34] have the wrong teaching of you need to
[59:37] be sprinkled in the name of Jesus Christ
[59:40] that's a wrong teaching right doctrine
[59:44] now we know you need to be baptized but
[59:46] everybody knows that baptize means to be
[59:48] immersed not sprinkled and immersed
[59:52] fully surrendered fully covered fully
[59:56] cleansed all the way so we need to have
[1:00:00] right teaching with right doctrine you
[1:00:03] have to meet the right code to access
[1:00:06] where you're trying to go
[1:00:08] amen some people believe that there are
[1:00:11] many paths of God in it but the
[1:00:14] scripture says and I can't help I don't
[1:00:16] like to call names but I can't help it I
[1:00:17] was watching something I think it was
[1:00:19] Oprah Winfrey and she was talking about
[1:00:21] yeah because I I ended up finding it
[1:00:24] somehow I saw the video this guy at work
[1:00:26] was talking about well there are many
[1:00:28] paths your cultivating your spirit and
[1:00:30] there are many paths that I happen to
[1:00:32] see the same thing now it had to have
[1:00:36] been the Lord because I had no idea
[1:00:38] Oprah was doing that and I just happened
[1:00:40] to see the videos like the next day so
[1:00:43] the Lord had it showed me this and uh
[1:00:46] that's where that man got that teaching
[1:00:49] from because he said the exact same
[1:00:50] thing Oprah did and so and I'm going
[1:00:56] down to her Habitrail there is this guy
[1:01:01] was and he believed in the power of the
[1:01:05] spoken word because we talked about that
[1:01:08] many times because he was saying you
[1:01:10] have to watch what you say because it
[1:01:11] might come to pass I said I agree with
[1:01:13] you he says you know I believe he could
[1:01:15] speak something and I wholly agree with
[1:01:17] you but then he got into this where you
[1:01:19] got a cultivate your spirit and
[1:01:21] and there are many paths to God have
[1:01:23] wait a minute know that that's where we
[1:01:26] will not have fellowship yeah that
[1:01:30] that's where we kind of draw the line
[1:01:31] because that's false teaching now he was
[1:01:34] telling this girl this woman that I work
[1:01:36] with he was telling her the same stuff
[1:01:39] and I was telling her I said don't
[1:01:41] listen to that
[1:01:42] I said that's Oprah Winfrey preaching
[1:01:44] right there and he got mad at me because
[1:01:47] he confronted me because she told him
[1:01:49] what I said I said that yeah well it's
[1:01:51] true
[1:01:52] she said you don't know how do you know
[1:01:54] I got that from Oprah I said because
[1:01:56] after you told me I saw a video she said
[1:01:58] the exact same thing so you had to pick
[1:02:00] that up from somewhere you know and then
[1:02:02] and that's what we have is people that
[1:02:03] are imitators they don't get a
[1:02:05] revelation of what it is they take what
[1:02:07] somebody else says but I encourage you
[1:02:09] to find out for yourself you don't have
[1:02:13] to do your researching you have to open
[1:02:15] the door it's you that's keeping the
[1:02:18] door shut or your opening it's you that
[1:02:23] has to have it give him the access you
[1:02:25] can't go off with some other man's
[1:02:27] teaching you just can't do it so faith
[1:02:36] is a key and Christ as the doors all
[1:02:39] right but I can hand out a different key
[1:02:43] to each person it may unlock something
[1:02:46] somewhere but that's its purpose that
[1:02:48] key was designed to do that to open
[1:02:50] something somewhere but it was specific
[1:02:53] to it to a specific lock cylinder or
[1:02:56] padlock or or whatever it might be but
[1:02:59] be careful what you're trying to access
[1:03:00] there's a key to the Quran there's a key
[1:03:03] to Mormonism there's a key to Satanism
[1:03:06] there's a key to magic there's different
[1:03:08] keys to get into these so be careful
[1:03:13] what you're trying to put your key in
[1:03:15] because when you look away from Christ
[1:03:17] it might fit into something else that
[1:03:19] you somewhere that you don't below
[1:03:26] but there is only one combination that's
[1:03:29] going to fit correctly to eternal life
[1:03:31] is that right
[1:03:32] Jesus Christ is the only way then we
[1:03:36] have spiritual keys the key is held in a
[1:03:38] hand that unlocks the door it does not
[1:03:41] turn by itself and brother Branham
[1:03:43] talked about a microphone this
[1:03:45] microphone by itself does nothing until
[1:03:48] I speak into it and even if I'm speaking
[1:03:50] into it there has to be a receiver to it
[1:03:52] so there are many combinations to get my
[1:03:55] voice out to a speaker it's just sitting
[1:03:59] there by itself it is useless just like
[1:04:02] a key in somebody's hand it's useless
[1:04:04] until they go to apply it faith isn't
[1:04:07] faith until you go to apply it but that
[1:04:12] is your part so you're there's more of
[1:04:15] an active part to being a Christian than
[1:04:17] what you thought right our hands hold
[1:04:20] the key of faith jesus said that he is
[1:04:23] the door By Me If any man enter in he
[1:04:25] shall be saved but you must have faith
[1:04:27] to believe that he is and a rewarder of
[1:04:30] those who diligently seek Him otherwise
[1:04:33] he is nothing to you we could see that a
[1:04:35] key could be referred to as his faith
[1:04:37] and uh which revelation excuse me if
[1:04:42] faith is a revelation and revelation
[1:04:44] will give us the authority to to unlock
[1:04:46] spiritual doors the more you read
[1:04:50] scriptures and pray and meditate the
[1:04:52] more you learn from God now see man can
[1:04:56] teach you can sit in a classroom
[1:04:58] until you're blue in the face or until
[1:05:00] you fall asleep but it doesn't mean
[1:05:02] anything with that man teach and unless
[1:05:03] you are an active listener and paying
[1:05:06] attention to what that person is
[1:05:07] teaching again there's something that
[1:05:11] you have to do that's something on your
[1:05:14] part that you're responsible for that
[1:05:16] nobody else can do it for you man can't
[1:05:19] give a revelation you have to pray to
[1:05:21] God for that revelation man cannot give
[1:05:24] that revelation it's God that gives that
[1:05:26] revelation amen but when you get ahold
[1:05:31] of revelation it gives you access to God
[1:05:35] and all of his attributes but we do not
[1:05:38] stop
[1:05:39] at faith faith does not stand alone you
[1:05:46] are not complete with just faith there
[1:05:49] is more to gain to attain perfection 2nd
[1:05:54] Peter chapter 1 verse 5 everybody ok
[1:06:02] this morning 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 5
[1:06:14] it says and beside this giving all
[1:06:17] diligence which means focus and hard
[1:06:21] work add to your faith so like I said
[1:06:30] faith does not stand alone something
[1:06:34] needs to be partnered with faith
[1:06:37] he says add to your faith virtue virtue
[1:06:43] is moral excellence and modesty and
[1:06:46] purity and brother Brando said also said
[1:06:50] that virtue is strength because when the
[1:06:53] woman touched Jesus he said I perceive
[1:06:55] virtue went out of me that was strength
[1:06:57] that went out of me there went out of
[1:06:59] him and brother branham had the same
[1:07:01] thing when people would touch him that
[1:07:03] they would have access that and in when
[1:07:06] he would have all the visions and
[1:07:09] different things he said virtue went out
[1:07:11] he got weak and to virtue knowledge
[1:07:18] getting deeper into the word and to
[1:07:22] knowledge temperance which is
[1:07:26] self-control see all these things have
[1:07:29] to mesh together to meet a certain code
[1:07:34] into temperance if you don't have
[1:07:38] self-control
[1:07:39] how are you going to have patience and
[1:07:43] patience means endurance constant a
[1:07:46] stability if you don't
[1:07:50] patience it's going to be easily you're
[1:07:53] gonna fall away easily amen you must
[1:07:56] have patience so you're not carried
[1:07:58] about with every wind of doctrine
[1:08:01] something new that comes up you hear
[1:08:03] Joel Osteen say something that just
[1:08:05] sounds so flower flowering so beautiful
[1:08:08] I've never listened to him preach so I
[1:08:10] don't know but even in the message rang
[1:08:15] she might have some people that make it
[1:08:17] sound so good and you don't go research
[1:08:21] it you're going to be carried away with
[1:08:24] that it's happened it's happened to even
[1:08:27] strong men ministers we're not immune
[1:08:31] we're no better than than anybody else
[1:08:33] sitting in the church so into patience
[1:08:42] godliness and guide leanness is holiness
[1:08:45] holiness and reverence and to godliness
[1:08:48] brotherly kindness which is love of the
[1:08:54] Brethren right brotherly kindness is it
[1:08:58] just to the people that you go to church
[1:08:59] with sometimes that that's a tough one
[1:09:05] you mean I gotta love that guy that just
[1:09:10] smacked the side of my car yes he said
[1:09:16] love your enemies those that despite
[1:09:18] despitefully try to use you or abuse you
[1:09:25] and to brotherly kindness charity which
[1:09:29] is affection and benevolence but add to
[1:09:34] your faith you say you have faith
[1:09:37] sometimes we have a hard time just just
[1:09:39] getting to faith but yet we want to be
[1:09:42] at the statue of a perfect man we want
[1:09:44] to hit that that pinnacle that that
[1:09:46] pyramid but we can't get past faith and
[1:09:51] that's what we're supposed to do this
[1:09:54] brother brand speaking he says and
[1:09:56] that's what we're supposed to do is
[1:09:58] reflect the Son of God and now we're
[1:10:00] supposed to do his work
[1:10:03] he said he that believeth on me Saint
[1:10:07] John 14 7 he that believeth on me the
[1:10:10] works that I do shall he do also
[1:10:13] you're beginning to reflect the works of
[1:10:16] Christ because it gets to be so
[1:10:20] miraculous it can't be man it becomes so
[1:10:27] spiritual so supernatural that it can't
[1:10:31] be man it has to be something on the
[1:10:36] inside projecting on the outside
[1:10:40] hey man Jesus on the inside working on
[1:10:46] the outside you know people want to get
[1:10:49] clean up on the outside first or just
[1:10:51] trying to get people to the law of the
[1:10:54] letter you got to look like this you got
[1:10:56] to look like that you got to do this how
[1:10:58] about getting on the Christ first Christ
[1:11:01] will take care of that amen I fully
[1:11:03] believe that I fully believe that but so
[1:11:07] many of us try to do the works of Christ
[1:11:09] before the reflection of Christ is in us
[1:11:13] now there's the trouble we find those
[1:11:17] things happening you know it I know it
[1:11:20] we see these stumbles along the road we
[1:11:22] find the scrapheap of Ministers Wow of
[1:11:27] Christians piled along the road is
[1:11:31] because they didn't go into it right and
[1:11:39] that's why I'm here this morning is to
[1:11:42] try to teach this little church and
[1:11:44] myself wow that would put a firehose on
[1:11:51] a lot of people's doctrines and that's
[1:11:56] why I'm here this morning is to try to
[1:11:57] teach this little church and he said and
[1:11:59] myself and I feel the same way this
[1:12:02] morning and myself I'm here to learn - I
[1:12:05] don't know everything how that we can
[1:12:09] become the dwelling place of the Living
[1:12:11] God now I want to say I want to believe
[1:12:13] that everyone here as they mature
[1:12:15] Christian
[1:12:17] I don't want to take that away from
[1:12:18] anybody but even brother Branham this
[1:12:22] was in 62 so he was very well
[1:12:27] experienced very well versed in his
[1:12:30] Christian walk he was very well
[1:12:32] established and he still says we're here
[1:12:37] to learn and myself that's that's really
[1:12:42] saying that did you catch what I said
[1:12:46] he's even saying the prophet of God he's
[1:12:50] saying that he has to learn - isn't that
[1:12:54] something so think of yourself a little
[1:12:56] bit more and a little bit less you got
[1:12:58] to have the right balance yes right when
[1:13:03] somebody tries to tell you that you're
[1:13:04] nothing you're something because you're
[1:13:07] brought by the blood of Christ now I was
[1:13:10] going to preach a fascist I am nobody
[1:13:15] but yet somebody I'll try not to get
[1:13:19] into that one this morning I'm going to
[1:13:20] try and stay focused but how how many
[1:13:25] would like to be that he says the
[1:13:27] dwelling place of the Living God where
[1:13:31] we can't be so proud and saying well I'm
[1:13:33] already there we still have to have that
[1:13:36] openness about us to say that there is
[1:13:39] more of God to be had is that right if
[1:13:42] you desire more of God there's more of
[1:13:44] God to be had that desire has to be
[1:13:48] there because we have not come to full
[1:13:51] maturity yet we have not come to full
[1:13:53] perfection not yet but we're getting
[1:13:59] there
[1:14:00] we're shaping we're learning we're
[1:14:03] experiencing this is the place of making
[1:14:06] mistakes we're going to make mistakes
[1:14:10] but don't lose heart it's okay we have
[1:14:14] an advocate with the father now here is
[1:14:20] what we do what's the first thing he
[1:14:22] says have faith and be born again how
[1:14:24] many is born again amen
[1:14:27] that's
[1:14:29] lay the foundation so you got a good
[1:14:31] good step right there you've laid the
[1:14:34] foundation if you've been born again
[1:14:36] truly born again then after we lay the
[1:14:40] foundation secondly you add to your
[1:14:43] foundation
[1:14:44] he says add to your faith Peter said
[1:14:46] first you have faith then you add virtue
[1:14:49] to faith this is the next column first
[1:14:52] pour your foundation faith then to your
[1:14:55] faith add virtue now right here there
[1:14:58] knocks a lot of us down yes sir
[1:15:01] and virtue to faith that doesn't mean
[1:15:06] just living a virgin life you know like
[1:15:08] the woman or a man and so forth that
[1:15:10] doesn't have anything to do with that
[1:15:13] the Bible said we read over here in the
[1:15:16] Book of Luke where it said virtue went
[1:15:18] out of him
[1:15:20] excuse me if we're going to be like him
[1:15:24] we must have virtue then we must have it
[1:15:31] to be like him the first song that I
[1:15:34] ever loved in the hymns one of the
[1:15:36] greatest was to be like Jesus well if
[1:15:41] I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to
[1:15:44] have virtue and then it could pass
[1:15:46] forward from me to the people from me to
[1:15:52] the people from you to the people you're
[1:15:58] still in this you're not counted out
[1:16:02] you're still in it
[1:16:04] you still with me amen
[1:16:09] because virtue went out of him to the
[1:16:12] people virtue and before you can let it
[1:16:15] out you have to have it first if you
[1:16:20] haven't got it it won't come out this is
[1:16:28] something simple that he's saying but
[1:16:30] this is a nugget inside of here inside
[1:16:32] of this man Wow
[1:16:36] there's nothing for it to come out of
[1:16:39] what if someone tried to draw a virtue
[1:16:42] out of a
[1:16:43] and the check would return insufficient
[1:16:46] funds
[1:16:48] see he says no there none there to draw
[1:16:52] from the check bounced somebody looking
[1:16:56] at you as a Christian and tomorrow see
[1:16:58] you out here carrying on like a sinner
[1:17:00] oh my not much virtue can be drawn from
[1:17:06] that he says virtue must be in us then
[1:17:12] we get true virtue or then when we get
[1:17:16] true virtue we can add it to our faith
[1:17:18] that's the next foundation wall not the
[1:17:22] next foundation it's the next foundation
[1:17:24] wall because you're building there's
[1:17:28] already foundation laid there's no sense
[1:17:30] of making another foundation the
[1:17:32] foundation is already there he says now
[1:17:39] first you must have faith faith alone
[1:17:42] won't do it Peter said then add virtue
[1:17:45] to your faith you must have virtue in
[1:17:48] order to add it to your faith now how
[1:17:54] many people were counting how many times
[1:17:57] we said this or that I read this that
[1:18:00] you have to have faith and virtue and
[1:18:03] you must advert you to faith amen
[1:18:07] how many so that's stressing that point
[1:18:12] that you must have it in order to give
[1:18:17] it you know people act like they're
[1:18:24] they're more mature than what they
[1:18:26] really are and I think of preteens
[1:18:29] because preteens tend to do that because
[1:18:32] they're getting older that sounds like
[1:18:37] chuckles of experience I was there too
[1:18:43] right I know what I'm doing nobody needs
[1:18:46] to tell me I got this yeah I'm old
[1:18:50] enough I'm responsible enough
[1:18:53] you know you use yeah you you think you
[1:18:58] know it all and and that's the problem
[1:19:00] is that they think they're more mature
[1:19:02] than what they actually are they think
[1:19:08] they're an adult instead of a teenager
[1:19:10] where I'm growing up now I need to be
[1:19:13] treated like an adult but yet you still
[1:19:15] act like a little child in order to be
[1:19:18] treated as what you want to be treated
[1:19:21] as you must act that role you want to be
[1:19:26] treated like an adult act like an adult
[1:19:29] and that goes for some adults out there
[1:19:35] I've met a lot of childish adults I
[1:19:41] don't mean to laugh on that but I work
[1:19:45] with a lot of but but getting serious
[1:19:51] you know I'm kind of going down another
[1:19:54] rabbit trail brother branham said that
[1:19:55] there's a spirit on on every nation he
[1:19:59] talked about America having the spirit
[1:20:01] of haha I think I might have talked
[1:20:02] about this one of the other one of the
[1:20:04] recent times that I've been here he
[1:20:06] talked about America having the spirit
[1:20:08] of haha the spirit of laughter joking
[1:20:11] all the time and I find that to be
[1:20:13] absolutely true absolutely true
[1:20:17] now I like to laugh I like to joke or
[1:20:20] era laughter I think is good medicine
[1:20:22] but sometimes it goes a little too far
[1:20:25] sometimes it goes a lot too far but
[1:20:31] there's a time that we have to buckle
[1:20:33] down and be serious living a Christian
[1:20:37] life is not a joking matter
[1:20:40] amen it's serious so if we expect people
[1:20:46] to respect us as a Christian we try to
[1:20:49] build a reputation and we must act the
[1:20:55] role we want people to be saved you must
[1:20:58] act like you care I don't want you I'm
[1:21:03] not saying pretend that you care but you
[1:21:06] have to be in
[1:21:07] that role of caring for somebody it kind
[1:21:14] of hits home a little bit doesn't you
[1:21:17] say you say you say you say you want
[1:21:20] people saved we need people to come to
[1:21:24] church I feel so that guy is so lost he
[1:21:31] has no hope are you presenting hope are
[1:21:34] you presenting virtue are you presenting
[1:21:37] faith temperance patience godliness
[1:21:42] brotherly kindness are you presenting
[1:21:44] these types of things
[1:21:46] I have to check myself to a man because
[1:21:50] sometimes I get a little carried away
[1:21:51] like I said I like to joke around
[1:21:53] brother Branham had the same issue he'd
[1:21:54] have to go in the closet and repent Lord
[1:21:56] I'm sorry for joking around so much and
[1:21:59] and getting caught up and getting
[1:22:01] carried away so yeah it happens to be
[1:22:05] the spirit of this nation and people
[1:22:09] always have to have a good time you ever
[1:22:13] notice that they've always got to go out
[1:22:15] and have a good time somewhere they have
[1:22:16] to have that entertainment constantly
[1:22:19] before them I better get off that at it
[1:22:25] but when they when a preteen acts like
[1:22:29] that they're getting ahead of themselves
[1:22:30] just like when we're trying to put the
[1:22:32] other attributes in front of faith or
[1:22:35] you're putting the cart before the horse
[1:22:37] so to speak you're not there yet you
[1:22:40] need to attain such-and-such first
[1:22:42] before you can get here before you can
[1:22:46] you can't be fully developed until you
[1:22:48] get personally develop if a fetus has to
[1:22:53] become an embryo first right but some
[1:23:02] people are missing that very key element
[1:23:05] and wonder why they can't get closer to
[1:23:07] God everything else is built upon faith
[1:23:11] when you have faith then you can mature
[1:23:13] and you can move on to the next level of
[1:23:16] virtue and we should be living in a
[1:23:18] place
[1:23:21] people you've been coming to church for
[1:23:23] a while how many have been born-again
[1:23:26] for less than a year less than a year
[1:23:34] less than five years less than 10 less
[1:23:41] than 20 we're about the same time I
[1:23:46] thank brother we're right around the
[1:23:48] same the same time that was a wonderful
[1:23:53] move of God at that time brother Simon
[1:23:56] brother Jesse brother brother cam
[1:23:58] brother Tim Myers you know just at our
[1:24:02] church we had a few and just the
[1:24:05] explosion of the move of God my goodness
[1:24:07] I was that was outstanding but about the
[1:24:15] about to cry but just seeing the
[1:24:22] sovereignty of God just when people just
[1:24:28] when people think that God isn't moving
[1:24:29] anymore just just think of that time
[1:24:31] brother and when when people were
[1:24:34] thinking that God wasn't moving we want
[1:24:36] to see God move and people were we're
[1:24:38] praying we want to see a move of God and
[1:24:40] then they see an explosion of many and
[1:24:46] most of them have become ministers a lot
[1:24:49] of them have become ministers and people
[1:24:52] that you were around is that right
[1:24:53] brother a lot of them had become
[1:24:56] ministers myself and included so don't
[1:25:02] lose heart keep praying we might have
[1:25:05] another one before the Lord before the
[1:25:07] Lord returns who knows but we should be
[1:25:12] in a spot those that have been matured a
[1:25:14] little bit I could forgive you less than
[1:25:16] a year no but we should be in a spot if
[1:25:20] we've been in this for a little while
[1:25:22] we've had our experiences we should be
[1:25:24] in a spot to where we should be able to
[1:25:25] combat the thoughts of the devil right
[1:25:28] away we should be able to recognize the
[1:25:32] move of the end
[1:25:33] me amongst us you should know well
[1:25:38] that's not going to benefit I'm staying
[1:25:39] away from that you'd repent and go the
[1:25:42] other way turn and go the other way
[1:25:44] shun the very appearance of evil a man
[1:25:49] but don't spend so much time talking to
[1:25:53] Satan himself because time spent
[1:25:58] conversing with him is time not spent
[1:26:03] with God it is time taken away it's time
[1:26:11] take it away from the romance of your
[1:26:13] husband now those of you that have had
[1:26:18] boyfriends girlfriends those that are
[1:26:21] married now
[1:26:23] how would you that what do you think how
[1:26:26] do you think your spouse would feel if
[1:26:28] you're writing an ex-girlfriend or an
[1:26:31] ex-boyfriend to tell them that you don't
[1:26:34] want to talk to them anymore but you
[1:26:36] keep sending letters and you keep
[1:26:37] calling to tell them to stay away from
[1:26:40] you or I don't and they're saying I
[1:26:42] don't want anything to do with you
[1:26:43] you're the one who keeps calling how
[1:26:46] would you think the spouse would feel if
[1:26:47] you keep conversing with an ex you're
[1:26:52] divorced from old Satan yeah you're
[1:26:57] divorced from him you don't have to talk
[1:26:59] to him don't spend time conversing with
[1:27:03] him
[1:27:03] well you know you remember what you did
[1:27:06] to me back years ago and you know I'm
[1:27:09] changed now you know you remember this
[1:27:11] no don't talk to him don't give him the
[1:27:16] time of day the only time you should
[1:27:17] talk to here is when you say get thee
[1:27:19] behind me that's the only time you
[1:27:21] should be talk to him now there are some
[1:27:24] songs that are dedicated to and I wasn't
[1:27:26] going to bring this up but there are
[1:27:28] some songs that are dedicated to Satan
[1:27:31] by Christians and they spend the whole
[1:27:35] song communicating to Satan
[1:27:38] I know what they're trying to do and
[1:27:41] that's a good thought but why give the
[1:27:46] time to him give the time to God give
[1:27:50] your time to God converse with God spend
[1:27:53] time in the word you don't have to talk
[1:27:55] to him
[1:27:59] slewfoot that's that's why I was trying
[1:28:02] to think you don't have to talk to him
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:09] but like I said spending time with him
[1:28:12] is time not spent with God when trials
[1:28:17] come we should be in a place where we
[1:28:18] could kick the the prison doors open and
[1:28:21] say you're not going to hold me bound
[1:28:23] anymore I'm coming through this I'm over
[1:28:27] coming through I'm overcoming there
[1:28:28] think of that as a rerun of Samson you
[1:28:31] know the promise was given to us you
[1:28:33] shall possess the gates of your enemy
[1:28:35] just think of that as a rerun you don't
[1:28:43] have to be bound by the enemy you don't
[1:28:45] have to be bound there Amen talking a
[1:28:52] little bit about more of Keyes everybody
[1:28:55] okay this morning anybody sleepy no I'm
[1:29:02] really not but if I was sitting there I
[1:29:04] probably would be yeah a lot of times I
[1:29:10] just sit on my off button yeah I just
[1:29:12] tend it if I sit still I tend to fall
[1:29:14] asleep so wake up Matthew chapter 16 and
[1:29:25] verse 17 just feels a little warm in
[1:29:27] here Matthew 16 and 17 this isn't and
[1:29:39] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:29:42] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[1:29:45] blood had not revealed it unto thee but
[1:29:47] my father which is in heaven and i say
[1:29:51] also unto thee that
[1:29:53] now art Peter and upon this rock I will
[1:29:56] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:29:59] shall not prevail against it verse 19
[1:30:05] says and I will give unto thee the keys
[1:30:08] of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[1:30:14] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[1:30:17] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[1:30:20] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:30:23] so he described what a key was you loose
[1:30:27] it here you open it here or you shut it
[1:30:31] up or you bind it there so he's saying
[1:30:33] that Peter you have the keys to the
[1:30:36] kingdom of heaven and whatever you
[1:30:42] he didn't say whatever I approve of that
[1:30:45] you say he says whatever you shall loose
[1:30:50] on earth shall be loosed in heaven now
[1:30:53] see even even a man that had his own
[1:30:56] sinful shortcomings let's see this is
[1:31:01] where you where you come in to even
[1:31:04] though you have your shortcomings even
[1:31:06] though you have folks and failures he
[1:31:09] can still use you God still has a love
[1:31:19] for you you're not left in a sinful
[1:31:21] condition when there's when you've
[1:31:26] repented when you've made sorrowful
[1:31:27] repentance now this talking about Peter
[1:31:31] going back to Peter when he got the keys
[1:31:33] this is before his conversion Jesus
[1:31:37] later told him when he was converted to
[1:31:38] strengthen the Brethren Jesus said you
[1:31:41] won't enter the kingdom of heaven unless
[1:31:42] you are converted is that right that's
[1:31:45] Matthew and in 18 except ye be converted
[1:31:47] and you shall not enter into the kingdom
[1:31:50] of heaven is that right so even Peter in
[1:31:59] his sinless condition received or excuse
[1:32:03] me in a sinful condition not sinless in
[1:32:05] a sinful condition received the key
[1:32:07] to the kingdom of heaven now there are
[1:32:11] keys to the bottomless pit which is
[1:32:18] mentioned in revving to cover those I'm
[1:32:20] not going to focus on those today but in
[1:32:22] Revelation 9 and in Revelation 20 talks
[1:32:26] about the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:32:28] and holding Satan bound amen but
[1:32:35] revelation 1 in 18 Jesus says I am he
[1:32:43] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:32:46] Alive for evermore amen and have the
[1:32:51] keys of hell and death now if you notice
[1:32:57] Peter had the keys to the kingdom of
[1:33:00] heaven
[1:33:01] Jesus had the keys of hell and death now
[1:33:08] when Jesus rose on the third day he did
[1:33:11] not have the keys to the kingdom of
[1:33:15] heaven did you know that he said I have
[1:33:20] the keys to death and hell but not to
[1:33:23] the kingdom because there had been given
[1:33:26] to Peter now he said Peter whatever you
[1:33:32] loose on earth
[1:33:33] I'll loose it in heaven what you bind on
[1:33:37] earth I'll bind in heaven now here he
[1:33:40] stands with the keys to open up this
[1:33:43] blessed thing to the world and here he's
[1:33:45] got the keys in his hand and they're
[1:33:48] asking what can we do to be saved
[1:33:52] no matter what the Apostle said to do
[1:33:55] God has to recognize it in heaven if he
[1:34:01] gave him that authority now Peter said
[1:34:05] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:34:08] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:34:10] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:34:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:14] alright and that's the reason the keys
[1:34:17] turned your sins
[1:34:21] excuse me and that's the reason the keys
[1:34:23] turned in heaven to any other name
[1:34:33] throat's getting a little raw and that's
[1:34:36] the reason the keys turned in heaven to
[1:34:38] any other name any other way any other
[1:34:40] form it turned on earth and it turned in
[1:34:44] heaven or Jesus didn't keep his word to
[1:34:47] Peter and every place in the Bible they
[1:34:51] was baptized after that they were
[1:34:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:34:55] those who were baptized before that had
[1:34:58] to come and be baptized over again in
[1:35:00] the name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy
[1:35:03] Ghost that's correct it still runs the
[1:35:07] same now I believe Peter was an example
[1:35:10] of our potential look what he was able
[1:35:13] to do he he had the faith he received
[1:35:15] the key keys of the kingdom of heaven he
[1:35:17] was able to walk on water
[1:35:19] how many have walked on water in their
[1:35:21] life ever I haven't done it I'd like to
[1:35:26] do it but I haven't gotten to that point
[1:35:29] forced and then to try to walk on water
[1:35:39] but he was in a spot where he was so
[1:35:42] close to God the Apostles had such a
[1:35:44] closeness and a likeness of Jesus that
[1:35:47] people were even they were one to call
[1:35:50] them God because they saw God's
[1:35:52] attributes in them now whenever people
[1:35:56] were calling them God where did they say
[1:35:58] oh yeah you got that right yep that's me
[1:36:02] no they said see you don't do that I am
[1:36:07] NOT him John the Baptist said don't you
[1:36:10] do that I'm not the one you seek the
[1:36:13] angel said don't do that I'm not him
[1:36:16] there's only one that you're gonna bow
[1:36:18] to and I'm not it
[1:36:21] that's the humility to give God his
[1:36:24] place amen not trying to take his place
[1:36:28] but being joint heirs with him you still
[1:36:32] don't take his place
[1:36:35] amen now the key of David in Revelation
[1:36:40] chapter 3 and verse 7 it says into the
[1:36:45] angel of the church in Philadelphia
[1:36:47] write these things saith he that is holy
[1:36:53] he that is true he that hath the key of
[1:36:57] David he that openeth and no man
[1:37:02] shutteth this is important here and
[1:37:05] shutteth and no man openeth did not
[1:37:09] Jesus say that I am the door I am the
[1:37:15] door he's the only one who's going to
[1:37:18] open that door and he's the only one
[1:37:20] that's going to shut that door amen
[1:37:23] for he's the Good Shepherd he'll let the
[1:37:27] Sheep know when they can go out and
[1:37:29] he'll let the Sheep know and they need
[1:37:31] to come back in now where did this
[1:37:37] scripture come from this is in line in
[1:37:41] continuity with Isaiah chapter 22 and
[1:37:46] verse 20 it says and it shall come to
[1:37:50] pass in that day that I will call my
[1:37:53] servant II like him the son of Hilkiah
[1:37:55] and I will clothe him with thy robe and
[1:37:58] strengthen him with thy girdle and I
[1:38:00] will commit my government into his hand
[1:38:02] notice it was committing a government
[1:38:04] into his hand
[1:38:05] and he shall be a father to the
[1:38:08] inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the
[1:38:10] house of Judah and the key of the house
[1:38:14] of David will I lay upon his shoulder
[1:38:17] where shoulder so he shall open and none
[1:38:22] shall shut and he shall shut and none
[1:38:25] shall open and I will fasten him as a
[1:38:27] nail in a short place and he shall be
[1:38:30] for a glorious throne to his father's
[1:38:33] house and they shall hang upon him
[1:38:37] all the glory of his father's house the
[1:38:39] offspring and the issue all vessels of
[1:38:43] small quantity from the vessels of cups
[1:38:45] even to all the vessels of flagons
[1:38:48] in that day saith the Lord of Hosts
[1:38:50] shall the nail that is fastened in the
[1:38:53] short place be removed and be cut down
[1:38:55] and far and the burden that was upon it
[1:38:59] shall be cut off for the Lord hath
[1:39:02] spoken it boy this sounds like the
[1:39:06] crucifixion and the resurrection amen
[1:39:12] but there isn't anything in this life
[1:39:15] satisfying as it may be as good and as
[1:39:18] fine as it may be but you will find the
[1:39:20] sum total the sum total of all
[1:39:24] perfection in Christ in Christ
[1:39:29] everything everything everything fades
[1:39:34] into insignificance beside him say I
[1:39:39] like the songs that lift him up those
[1:39:43] are the songs that I like those are the
[1:39:46] songs that I can really rejoice in those
[1:39:50] are the songs that I get into worship in
[1:39:52] I like the victory songs I like that but
[1:39:56] I know my favorite ones are the ones
[1:39:58] that lift him up those are my favorite
[1:40:02] ones but he that had the key of David
[1:40:08] this beautiful phrase follows and comes
[1:40:11] out of the preceding phrase he that is
[1:40:13] true he that is true Christ the perfect
[1:40:21] realization contrasted with partial
[1:40:24] realization here it is Moses was a
[1:40:28] prophet of God but Jesus like unto Moses
[1:40:31] and just like as the brass serpent was
[1:40:35] lifted up so shall Jesus be lifted up is
[1:40:38] that right and was it not said that a
[1:40:41] prophet should be raised up likened unto
[1:40:43] Moses but Moses was prophet Moses was a
[1:40:50] prophet Jesus was the prophet of God the
[1:40:55] prophet of God David a man after God's
[1:40:57] own heart was king of Israel but Jesus
[1:41:00] is the gray
[1:41:01] David king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:41:05] God very God how many believes that this
[1:41:10] morning amen
[1:41:11] now David was born of the tribe of Judah
[1:41:14] out of whom no priest came yet he ate of
[1:41:19] the showbread reserved for priests he
[1:41:22] was the great warrior overcoming the
[1:41:24] enemy establishing the people as king he
[1:41:28] sat on the throne he was a prophet he
[1:41:32] was a wonderful type of Christ and we
[1:41:34] read Isaiah 22 of and the key of the
[1:41:39] house of David will I lay upon his
[1:41:41] shoulder so he shall open and none shall
[1:41:45] shut and he shall shut and none shall
[1:41:47] open the spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:41:51] reference concerning the Lord Jesus
[1:41:53] Christ and his ministry in the church
[1:41:58] what the key of David signified at that
[1:42:01] time is mere shadow which is now
[1:42:04] fulfilled and Jesus standing in the
[1:42:06] midst of the lamp stands it has to do
[1:42:11] with our Lord after his resurrection and
[1:42:14] not his earthly pilgrimage but what does
[1:42:26] this key signify the answer lies in the
[1:42:29] position of the key it is not in his
[1:42:35] hand
[1:42:35] it is not worn around his neck it is not
[1:42:42] placed in the hands of other men did
[1:42:45] y'all catch up and is not placed in the
[1:42:48] hands of other men or the verse could
[1:42:52] not be saying that he alone has the use
[1:42:56] of that key for he alone anybody else
[1:43:02] know Muhammad no
[1:43:07] Budda no none of them Peter James done
[1:43:14] any of the disciples brother branham you
[1:43:20] Satan absolutely not amen for him opens
[1:43:28] and shuts and no man has that right but
[1:43:30] Jesus himself isn't that right but where
[1:43:33] is the key it's on his shoulder
[1:43:37] but what does shorter had to do with it
[1:43:40] read Isaiah 9:6 it says and the
[1:43:43] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:43:45] but what does this mean the answer is
[1:43:50] this the phrase government should the
[1:43:52] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:43:55] the wedding ceremony of the east
[1:43:56] remember we're not looking at it with an
[1:43:58] American mind frame we're looking at it
[1:44:01] from an Eastern mind frame not a Western
[1:44:03] mind frame formal wedding ceremony of
[1:44:07] the east when the bride has been
[1:44:11] committed to the groom she takes off her
[1:44:14] veil and places it over the groom's
[1:44:18] shoulders signifying that not only is
[1:44:21] she under his Dominion that she has
[1:44:24] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:44:27] the head but also that he bears the
[1:44:31] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:44:35] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:44:41] other power has any right and
[1:44:44] responsibility and the scripture goes
[1:44:47] back in and says that wives submit to
[1:44:51] your own husband's not to somebody
[1:44:57] else's husband to your own husband oh my
[1:45:06] are you his and only his hey man and
[1:45:11] that beloved and that's why I say don't
[1:45:15] spend your time talking to the other guy
[1:45:20] that's why I say talk to God go to God
[1:45:25] alone with your problems
[1:45:26] he's the one who's taken the burden for
[1:45:29] you not some other man not some other
[1:45:32] God but he and he alone amen
[1:45:36] and that beloved is the key of David
[1:45:41] oh my anybody ever wonder when there was
[1:45:49] a Keith David well it's right there
[1:45:53] Christ taking his place as groom as
[1:45:57] husband and declaring the responsibility
[1:46:01] for his bride amen
[1:46:04] the responsibility is upon his shoulder
[1:46:07] not anyone elses God being sovereign he
[1:46:13] foreknew by divine decree exactly who
[1:46:17] would be in his bride he chose her she
[1:46:21] did not choose him he called her she did
[1:46:25] not come under her on her own he died
[1:46:28] for her he lost her in his own blood he
[1:46:36] paid the price for her she belongs to
[1:46:39] him and to him alone
[1:46:41] she is wholly committed to him and he
[1:46:44] accepts he accepts the obligation gladly
[1:46:51] accepts the obligation he is her head
[1:46:56] for Christ is the head of his church as
[1:46:59] Sara called Abraham Lord even so the
[1:47:04] bride is happy that he is her lord he
[1:47:08] speaks and she obeys for that is her
[1:47:12] delight if you want to know where I got
[1:47:14] this information it's in the church ages
[1:47:16] chapter 8 the Philadelphia and church
[1:47:19] age I didn't reference some of the other
[1:47:24] quotes that I've read but if you're
[1:47:27] wanting to know I'll give it to you or
[1:47:30] you could look it up
[1:47:32] because y'all are supposed to check me
[1:47:34] right if something sounds that doesn't
[1:47:38] sound right
[1:47:39] okay that's where he found that or the
[1:47:43] other way brother we got something to
[1:47:46] talk about
[1:47:47] you said such-and-such here I don't find
[1:47:50] that exactly to be to the message you
[1:47:53] know and and there's a way to go about
[1:47:54] that you know but reading through there
[1:47:58] about the the key of David when brother
[1:48:04] Jesse first invited David and I out I
[1:48:06] was thinking I was thinking even before
[1:48:09] why I sure would like to to preach
[1:48:11] Beulah land and no because I preached it
[1:48:14] at the home church and many of you know
[1:48:17] that I don't I don't get on the website
[1:48:19] I don't especially if I know I'm if
[1:48:22] brother Jesse invites me I do not go on
[1:48:25] a site I do not I so I don't know what
[1:48:29] ministers have been through I don't know
[1:48:30] what they preached on and I do that for
[1:48:33] a reason
[1:48:35] but it just so happened here a little
[1:48:37] bit ago
[1:48:38] y'all had brother Keith Randolph here
[1:48:40] and if all the messages I I choose to
[1:48:45] listen to your Eddie had Beulah land
[1:48:47] preach to you because he say well there
[1:48:51] goes that one I gotta find another way
[1:48:53] [Laughter]
[1:48:55] and he did a great job that's the first
[1:48:58] I've ever heard of brief brother Keith
[1:49:00] ran off and he did a fantastic job
[1:49:01] because he went through everything that
[1:49:04] I had there was nothing for me to bring
[1:49:05] to you nothing nothing different he did
[1:49:09] a wonderful job but I can't help I can't
[1:49:13] get away from from that reading about
[1:49:16] the key of David and Beulah so y'all
[1:49:18] know y'all were schooled how many were
[1:49:21] active learners that day and picking up
[1:49:24] what he was saying
[1:49:26] Beulah means to be married correct and
[1:49:30] it that's a found in Isaiah 62 and verse
[1:49:34] four it says thou shalt no more be
[1:49:38] termed forsaken amen
[1:49:41] neither shall thy land anymore be termed
[1:49:45] desolate amen but thou shalt be called
[1:49:50] Hephzibah in thy land Beulah
[1:49:55] for the Lord delighteth in thee as
[1:49:59] Hephzibah I'm not a scholar I think
[1:50:04] that's the way is pronounced Oh for the
[1:50:10] Lord
[1:50:11] the lighteth in thee and thy land shall
[1:50:14] be married oh my the key of David our
[1:50:19] husband and knowing what he's done for
[1:50:22] us oh my praise God
[1:50:25] it's really wonderful just get into the
[1:50:28] word you want to you want to have more
[1:50:30] of him well you've got to look you've
[1:50:32] got to you've got to access it amen but
[1:50:38] faith isn't in just saying that you're a
[1:50:39] Christian or going through the motions
[1:50:41] to become one it's a way of life it's
[1:50:45] not being able to abide by all the rules
[1:50:47] and regulations and bylaws and the
[1:50:49] whatnot so how do you know you'll be
[1:50:52] going to heaven how do you know you're
[1:50:56] gonna go to heaven any one of us but how
[1:51:06] do you know that you are part of the
[1:51:07] Bride you don't know for sure or you
[1:51:12] don't
[1:51:13] it's you're waiting for this big
[1:51:17] glamorous explanation to come out and
[1:51:22] you're waiting very patiently but you
[1:51:25] don't you don't know for sure but you
[1:51:27] claim it by faith and faith is you just
[1:51:34] know it's something you just know is
[1:51:38] right you don't have a detailed
[1:51:42] description well this is how you did
[1:51:45] this is this is this and this and this
[1:51:47] some things are just by faith you just
[1:51:50] know there's something on the inside
[1:51:52] that says I have that assurance I have
[1:51:57] met the requirements of the
[1:51:58] road map that's been laid out in front
[1:52:00] of me I have met those requirements and
[1:52:02] God is obligated brother Branham said if
[1:52:05] he did it one time he's obligated to do
[1:52:07] it another time you meet the same
[1:52:08] requirements amen
[1:52:13] what does the scripture tell us the just
[1:52:16] lives by faith amen praise the Lord I'm
[1:52:26] gonna go ahead and close I have more
[1:52:27] here but and I just feel we'll go ahead
[1:52:31] and close Psalm 68 and verse 18 says
[1:52:44] thou has to send it on high thou has led
[1:52:48] captivity captive thou has to receive
[1:52:51] gifts for men yay for the rebellious
[1:52:55] also that the Lord God might dwell among
[1:52:57] them blessed be the Lord who daily
[1:53:00] loaded us with his benefits even the god
[1:53:04] of our salvation Selah he that is our
[1:53:08] God is the god of salvation and unto God
[1:53:12] the Lord belong the issues from death
[1:53:16] amen oh just the key if a can it can
[1:53:22] open so many opportunities so many
[1:53:25] opportunities but you have to
[1:53:30] by the key in the right way it has to
[1:53:34] mesh or dovetail it has to go together
[1:53:39] to work if he's ins four and four it
[1:53:44] says there is one body one body and one
[1:53:49] spirit even as you were called in one
[1:53:52] hope of your calling one Lord one faith
[1:53:58] one baptism how many gods one God and
[1:54:06] Father of all who is above all and
[1:54:09] through all and in you all but unto
[1:54:14] every one of us is given grace according
[1:54:17] to the measure of the gift of Christ but
[1:54:25] there is one door to salvation to
[1:54:27] liberate man from his sin one door to
[1:54:30] peace one door to heaven there is one
[1:54:33] door to healing I am THE LORD thy God
[1:54:37] that heals all thy diseases blessed be
[1:54:44] the Lord who daily loaded us with his
[1:54:48] benefits even the god of our salvation
[1:54:53] amen
[1:54:54] you know I know I said I was gonna close
[1:54:59] in the Old Testament in Exodus when the
[1:55:09] Death Angel was to pass there was a
[1:55:13] requirement of the people of Israel to
[1:55:18] perform is that right there was a
[1:55:20] certain way that they had to do
[1:55:23] something and it was the decree went out
[1:55:26] if you do it this way you and your house
[1:55:31] shall be saved if you do it
[1:55:36] heartedly if you don't do it at all if
[1:55:38] you don't follow my instructions that
[1:55:44] that Death Angel has authority to come
[1:55:47] into the house and wipe out anyone it
[1:55:50] wants to so you are giving the death
[1:55:55] angel or the evil spirits you are giving
[1:55:59] them access if you don't follow the
[1:56:03] instructions laid out before you amen
[1:56:09] amen amen
[1:56:13] that Death Angel could only access that
[1:56:16] house if that key was not applied
[1:56:19] correctly it's the only way he was going
[1:56:23] to enter into that house please God oh
[1:56:27] my you can go ahead and stand your feet
[1:56:44] close with this quote of brother Branham
[1:56:48] this was found in the key to the door he
[1:56:53] says and if there is such an evil as
[1:56:58] polio diphtheria smallpox yellow fever
[1:57:06] tetanus lockjaw and so forth you know
[1:57:12] those were common years ago because they
[1:57:16] didn't have anything the men of science
[1:57:21] the men of Medicine didn't find that key
[1:57:24] of knowledge to combat it but somehow
[1:57:29] they found that key and applied the key
[1:57:32] to eliminate that from man if being as
[1:57:38] as brother bran toccata as being
[1:57:41] inoculated with the vaccination
[1:57:47] these evils have been able to fight day
[1:57:50] and night but like I said until they
[1:57:53] found the inoculation from it because
[1:57:56] it's evil it's a killer
[1:57:59] how much more see these men spent time
[1:58:05] staying up day after day were pursuing
[1:58:10] it day after day to find the vaccination
[1:58:13] of these diseases because their goal was
[1:58:18] to combat evil their goal was to
[1:58:21] overcome that evil that killer of these
[1:58:23] diseases that was their goal as mere men
[1:58:28] but how much more he goes on to say how
[1:58:32] much more is there a key to salvation
[1:58:35] for a man that's imprisoned in the house
[1:58:41] of sin there is a key to that door to
[1:58:45] liberate men from it oh my let me feel
[1:58:53] that they've had something taken from
[1:58:55] that the devil has taken your joy taking
[1:58:59] your family your loved ones what do you
[1:59:02] think it's time to take it back instead
[1:59:04] of sulking at it and saying well I don't
[1:59:06] have this anymore I just don't have the
[1:59:08] joy I don't have the means to oh my lord
[1:59:11] speak to me now this is to me how many
[1:59:15] just don't have that desire to to
[1:59:18] worship God as they used to how many
[1:59:22] don't have that that desire to walk and
[1:59:24] the way they should how many have had
[1:59:28] something taken from them well it's time
[1:59:30] somebody say it's time it's time it's
[1:59:33] time it's time to take back it's time to
[1:59:37] be like little David and go back and get
[1:59:39] get the belongings that were taken going
[1:59:41] to take the Y's back that we're taking
[1:59:44] that we're stole from it's time to take
[1:59:46] captivity captive it's time to stop
[1:59:48] sitting on the bench sitting on the
[1:59:50] sidelines watching things happen to your
[1:59:52] family
[1:59:52] what did things crumble before you it's
[1:59:54] time to stop sitting around waiting and
[1:59:57] watching things happen
[1:59:58] waiting for something else to take
[1:59:59] happen or something else to happen we
[2:00:02] nits in our power to open the door or
[2:00:06] shut the door it's within our power to
[2:00:09] let Christ in it's within our power for
[2:00:11] letting the evil spirits in it's within
[2:00:13] our power to open or shut
[2:00:16] it's within our power of what we're
[2:00:19] entertaining it's within our power of
[2:00:22] what we're reading of what we're holding
[2:00:24] before us it's within our power what
[2:00:26] we're saying it's within our power of
[2:00:28] our tempers if we can't without our
[2:00:30] temper it's within your power to have
[2:00:33] that self-control oh my I know we're I
[2:00:39] know I said we were going to close but I
[2:00:40] just feel something now it's within us
[2:00:47] how many people how many of you feel
[2:00:50] that it's it's right there it's just
[2:00:53] right on the verge of being stripped
[2:00:56] away from you you don't have to let that
[2:00:59] happen you know Jesus said that I give
[2:01:05] you power to tread over scorpions and
[2:01:08] serpents I've given you that power to
[2:01:11] overcome that but that's not where your
[2:01:14] joy lies your joy lies where that your
[2:01:19] names are written in heaven so it's
[2:01:27] great that we can have control it's
[2:01:28] great that we could overcome he said
[2:01:31] those seventy came back and they were
[2:01:32] rejoicing that they were that they had
[2:01:34] power over those spirits and it
[2:01:36] sometimes I think we forget that we
[2:01:39] forget that we had that key a key has
[2:01:42] the power to unlock as well as lock and
[2:01:47] we forget that it has the power to lock
[2:01:50] Satan had his demons out we had that
[2:01:54] power if you had that que you had that
[2:01:56] power
[2:02:00] so where do we
[2:02:02] waiting on what are we waiting on what
[2:02:05] are you waiting on what am I waiting on
[2:02:08] what are we waiting on it's within your
[2:02:13] reach take the hand of faith and use
[2:02:16] that key amen
[2:02:20] accessing the door jesus said I am the
[2:02:23] door to the Sheep no man can come in
[2:02:27] unless I say so
[2:02:29] no man comes by me unless I allowed Oh
[2:02:34] My yes yes bar his ass more Amen Lord
[2:02:46] God truly is the quote that was written
[2:02:47] this morning when brother Branham said
[2:02:49] that we are here to learn and he
[2:02:51] included himself Lord I also include
[2:02:55] myself and I just I just know your
[2:02:58] spirit was talking with me Lord Lord if
[2:03:02] I'm going through the same situation
[2:03:05] somebody else here must be going through
[2:03:07] the same surely believe that you had
[2:03:12] held it to come out now Lord I don't
[2:03:18] believe that we go through things just
[2:03:21] to go through things but there is a
[2:03:22] purpose behind me Lord I know that you
[2:03:28] have a purpose there's a purpose there's
[2:03:31] a reason why we came today and spoke on
[2:03:34] what you wanted us to speak on this
[2:03:36] morning I just want to ask a question do
[2:03:42] you find yourself wondering why you're
[2:03:43] not receiving from God and I ask the
[2:03:47] same question to myself why am I not
[2:03:48] receiving from God
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:55] I think something would be wrong within
[2:03:58] us if we didn't ask them when we're
[2:04:02] going through the trials and the
[2:04:05] tribulations it seems like things are
[2:04:09] crumbling around us there would be
[2:04:12] something wrong within us if we didn't
[2:04:14] come to that conclusion that something
[2:04:16] is wrong I'm not in the state of where I
[2:04:21] used to be of when I was up on the
[2:04:23] mountain the Lord if somebody's going
[2:04:29] through the valley
[2:04:31] rest assured we know that there's a way
[2:04:35] to the top of the mountain to have a
[2:04:37] mountaintop experience again
[2:04:40] the Lord just because we're in the
[2:04:42] valley doesn't mean that we lose faith
[2:04:45] it just means that we're being tested
[2:04:48] we're being tried and I just thank you
[2:04:53] for giving me putting me in the right
[2:04:55] mind frame the other day I was telling
[2:04:56] brother Jesse about it just seemed like
[2:04:59] everything was going wrong in the
[2:05:01] morning but that didn't mean I had to
[2:05:06] quit just because things weren't going
[2:05:08] right I still had to go through my day I
[2:05:12] still had to go to work I still had a
[2:05:16] fulfillment to make and the same thing
[2:05:21] with our walk this morning we don't have
[2:05:25] to stop becoming being Christians
[2:05:27] because we're having some trials things
[2:05:30] aren't going right that's what makes a
[2:05:34] soldier right lord
[2:05:37] that's what makes us soldiers as
[2:05:41] soldiers of Christ
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:46] you find yourself questioning does God
[2:05:50] really exist
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:57] Gideon often wondered something similar
[2:06:02] if God before us where are all the
[2:06:05] miracles if God before it's not
[2:06:08] everything as a as a sunshine good day
[2:06:15] there are rainy days and stormy days but
[2:06:19] I thank God for that blessed assurance
[2:06:21] that we continue on to know that you are
[2:06:24] and that you are a rewarder of those
[2:06:27] that diligently seek you thank you thank
[2:06:38] you Jesus Lord those that might be
[2:06:42] struggling today I heard a request for
[2:06:44] brother Jose for for healing in his body
[2:06:48] lord I know in the past when I've been
[2:06:51] here before we pray for the same thing
[2:06:53] healing in his body or his wife's body
[2:06:55] or we're healing in somebody else's by
[2:06:57] Lord of a surety through my own
[2:07:01] experience know without a shadow and now
[2:07:06] that you are a healer I know that you
[2:07:12] are a healer I know that you could raise
[2:07:16] Jose I know that you can heal him in his
[2:07:20] body right now and just that brother any
[2:07:28] other brethren sister in here
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:35] might have a financial situation where
[2:07:39] it looks bleak wondering where the next
[2:07:43] paycheck is gonna come from I don't know
[2:07:46] your situations here but there is one
[2:07:48] that knows that situation there might be
[2:07:59] one suffering persecution in the walk of
[2:08:03] life this morning but rest assured we
[2:08:06] call upon the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:08] Christ to give strength to bear through
[2:08:10] that persecution this morning there
[2:08:19] might be one questioning this morning if
[2:08:21] they're saved it might be one question
[2:08:24] do I really have the Holy Ghost there
[2:08:27] might be one question am I going to make
[2:08:30] it heaven I'm not going to make it to
[2:08:34] him
[2:08:38] Lord only you could set these straight
[2:08:41] in the hearts of your children this
[2:08:44] morning
[2:08:44] only you could truly answer your child
[2:08:48] this morning there might be somebody
[2:08:54] here wondering what's the use of
[2:08:57] continuing on I feel like giving up oh
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:03] lord give them the strength and the
[2:09:08] courage to pick up to know that we could
[2:09:15] fall seven times but we can rise an
[2:09:18] eighth there's one to give us strength
[2:09:23] to continue there's one to pick us up
[2:09:28] there's all that have the experience of
[2:09:31] comin that had the meat they've gone
[2:09:34] through the situation's before there's
[2:09:36] there's ones at that experience they
[2:09:38] could drop the meat of the word they
[2:09:40] could grab the meat to those that are
[2:09:41] gone through their struggles the Eagles
[2:09:43] that are going through their struggles
[2:09:45] [Music]
[2:09:50] there is a light there is a light where
[2:09:55] Jesus said I am the light of the world
[2:09:57] there is a light if you wonder if there
[2:10:00] is a light if there's a way out there is
[2:10:03] a way up for he said that I am the the
[2:10:07] truth the life and the way he is God he
[2:10:13] has got alone amen

[2:10:22] went the way that I went this morning
[2:10:25] they after sometimes I guess I just
[2:10:31] don't know how to close but I would it
[2:10:35] be sensitive to the spirit I had a
[2:10:41] picture in my mind of a different kind
[2:10:43] of a closing but it's not in the way
[2:10:48] that I wanted to go
[2:10:50] rest assured Jesus is here
