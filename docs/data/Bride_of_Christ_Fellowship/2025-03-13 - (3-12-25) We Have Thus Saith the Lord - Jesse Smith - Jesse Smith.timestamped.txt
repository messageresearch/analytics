[0:00] God's
[0:03] grace James 5 verse 10 and then amamos
[0:08] 37 and
[0:17] 8 I think I know why I say that honey
[0:19] because I Corvin Amos I think I I always
[0:22] said his name
[0:23] Amos yeah that's why I say that there
[0:26] just a little side note there Allelujah
[0:28] so I want to just preach on this uh we
[0:30] have thus sayith the Lord by God's grace
[0:31] now every Christian has it because they
[0:33] have the entire Bible but we've been
[0:36] visited by a prophet in this day uh
[0:38] brother William brandham and he gave us
[0:40] many thus sayith the Lords so I want to
[0:42] go over some of those here tonight by
[0:44] God's grace and I like to at some point
[0:46] get them all all in one spot together
[0:48] and uh I just need to work on that I got
[0:51] a document and it's got 33 Pages it's
[0:54] got 41 pages of all these thus sayi the
[0:56] Lords and I'm slowly trying to put them
[0:58] onto one uh Pres presentation where we
[1:00] can all put them there together by God's
[1:02] grace so um uh James 5:10 by the grace
[1:07] of the Lord now notice what does a
[1:09] prophet do they speak in the name of the
[1:12] Lord all right so let's read that on
[1:14] three ready one two three take my
[1:17] brethren the prophets who have spoken in
[1:20] the name of the Lord for an example of
[1:23] suffering Affliction and of patience
[1:26] praise God now if you go to Amos 37 and
[1:30] eight we'll read that by God's
[1:40] grace Daniel Hosea Joel and
[1:50] Amos now of course I never really heard
[1:53] this scripture preach until I came into
[1:55] the ministry of the message of uh those
[1:58] preachers that were preaching the
[1:59] Revelations from the Bible God gave to
[2:02] William brandom so this verse just
[2:04] really did a lot for us uh it's so
[2:06] important uh as we see it all down
[2:08] through the Bible you know you can take
[2:10] every one of these prophets from the Old
[2:11] Testament and almost every book starts
[2:13] off with the vision came to this Prophet
[2:15] or the word of the Lord came to that
[2:17] prophet and each time God gave a prophet
[2:20] a revelation and so that's what we have
[2:22] today God gave brother brandham the
[2:24] secrets of the Seven Seals praise God
[2:27] and I would even uh make a case where uh
[2:30] gave him the secrets of the seven Church
[2:31] ages and the Seven Stars I would make
[2:34] that um that argument as well or that
[2:37] case because I don't like to call it
[2:39] argueing I don't like to argue uh but I
[2:41] make that case with humility by God's
[2:43] grace so Amos 3 7 and 8 let's read seven
[2:49] together there by God's grace and then I
[2:50] guess we can read eight ready one two 3
[2:53] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[2:56] he revealeth his secret unto his
[2:59] servants the prophets the lion hath
[3:02] roared who will not fear the lord God
[3:06] hasth spoken who can but prophesy let's
[3:09] have one more word of prayer if you have
[3:10] any on your heart let's make it own to
[3:11] god father my hands up Lord God I'm so
[3:13] thankful to be here tonight Lord In The
[3:15] Presence of Jehovah Lord God thank you
[3:17] Lord I ask that the Holy Spirit Lord
[3:19] would take control Lord God and just
[3:21] Minister through the word Lord this is
[3:23] your ordained way through the five full
[3:25] ministry Lord God to preach Lord one man
[3:28] preaching to men and women to try to get
[3:30] them to believe the word of God and Lord
[3:32] I need to believe too each one of us
[3:33] need Faith Lord raise our faith tonight
[3:35] Lord God we thank you for visiting us
[3:37] Lord in this hour this generation these
[3:39] last few generations with the prophet
[3:41] William brandham Lord God and now father
[3:43] we look to the word of God lord and we
[3:45] ask that the spirit of Jesus that's here
[3:47] today as your Prophet taught us Jesus is
[3:49] the prophet of this hour Lord God
[3:51] hallelujah and Lord just take the words
[3:53] now on the pages of the Bible make them
[3:55] real to us and I pray Lord God our faith
[3:57] will be raised today in Jesus Christ's
[3:59] name name and the Saints said amen amen
[4:01] God bless you as you're being seated
[4:03] praise God I will set a timer
[4:05] here again just to kind of watch the
[4:07] clock here uh by God's grace okay I want
[4:10] to uh put up some quotes here now I
[4:13] preached this a number of years ago and
[4:15] I added some things in here so hope this
[4:17] will be okay uh by God's grace so I just
[4:20] want to preach on we have thus sayith
[4:21] the Lord and again uh as I've said
[4:23] before you know I went through um over
[4:26] 1,000 I think it was 600 quotes from
[4:28] brother bradam that all all use either
[4:30] thus sayith the Lord or in the name of
[4:32] the Lord now the thing you'll find right
[4:34] away is a lot of times he was just
[4:35] saying thus sayth the Lord from the
[4:36] Bible he wasn't actually prophesying so
[4:39] it actually you know took that number of
[4:40] 1 1600 or what 1300 whatever it was and
[4:43] it narrowed it down and that's what I
[4:44] put on my 40 some page document there I
[4:46] think it was 41 but it doesn't really
[4:48] matter but anyways
[4:51] um you know and I boiled it down
[4:53] remember a few weeks ago I showed how
[4:54] there's at least six thus sayith the
[4:56] Lord's future that brother Adam told
[4:59] right and then there could be those 10
[5:00] that the brother sent me with the Divine
[5:02] Healing where he would tell people thus
[5:04] sayith the Lord you're going to get well
[5:05] so there could be up to 16 now remember
[5:07] now that's a small number compared to
[5:09] remember we looked at Jeremiah Jeremiah
[5:11] and Isaiah had over 100 they had over
[5:12] hundred thus sayith the Lord just in
[5:14] their books so we believe brother Ram
[5:17] was a a major prophet but as far as his
[5:20] number of prophecies we would say it's
[5:22] smaller than what's written in just the
[5:23] book of Isaiah or Jeremiah or Ezekiel
[5:26] because they had hundreds of prophecies
[5:28] like we said they prophesy to Edom and
[5:30] Egypt and uh Assyria and Babylon then
[5:34] back to Israel so many thus sayith the
[5:36] Lord so many prophecies in the name of
[5:38] the Lord but of course uh God promised
[5:41] this ministry we looked at it a few
[5:43] weeks ago it would turn it was the
[5:44] spirit of Elijah that would turn the
[5:46] hearts of the children back to the
[5:47] fathers praise God and so brother baham
[5:49] tells us that he even gives us thus
[5:50] sayith the Lord on that so it's either a
[5:52] lie or it's Truth Now how do we know
[5:54] it's true because everything brother
[5:56] Brandon taught us was in the word of God
[5:57] hallelujah all right so he's poting us
[5:59] back to the scriptures Hallelujah so I
[6:01] want to look at this here tonight and uh
[6:03] now brother man tells us in the church
[6:04] age book he said God will never give us
[6:08] a different Revelation from what he's
[6:10] given in here now everything brother R
[6:12] says is outside of here just like almost
[6:15] any Prophet right uh that was after that
[6:18] was after the the cannon was finished
[6:20] right the New Testament Cannon was
[6:21] finished any Prophet after that or any
[6:23] prophecy after that will be outside of
[6:27] this but what's true it will still line
[6:29] up with with what's in here right and so
[6:32] when a when it's a gift of Prophecy it's
[6:34] it's a modern prophecy or something uh
[6:37] that's that's from a living Prophet or a
[6:39] recent Prophet that's not in the
[6:40] scripture he lived after the Canon was
[6:42] finished uh then it it it's it's it's
[6:45] it's not like we're adding to the word
[6:46] of God we're never adding to the word of
[6:48] God but whatever the prophecy is it will
[6:50] have to agree with this right and then
[6:52] no prophecy will take anything it'll
[6:54] never take one word away from it and
[6:55] never add one word to it and the words
[6:58] brother Ram uses he said he'll give us
[6:59] more information on the same Revelation
[7:03] Hallelujah that's that's how brother
[7:04] teaches it uh it doesn't give us a
[7:06] different Revelation the same Revelation
[7:09] it just gives us more information on it
[7:11] Hallelujah so as we look tonight here um
[7:14] that's kind of what we'll see with these
[7:15] different prophecies from brother
[7:16] brandom and the times when we got it
[7:18] will go to the scripture because some of
[7:19] these are just more information on the
[7:21] same scripture but it doesn't take away
[7:23] from the word doesn't add to the word of
[7:25] God if that was the case it would be
[7:26] against the word of God and then we know
[7:28] brother Brandon wasn't a true Prophet
[7:30] but we know he is by God's grace because
[7:31] he pointed us to the word of God
[7:33] hallelujah thank God for that now I like
[7:36] what brother R says here uh because he
[7:38] says uh in order for God to deal with
[7:40] his church and I mean to deal with it to
[7:42] make it his
[7:43] bride we have to leave denominations
[7:47] okay that's what we have to do brother
[7:48] tells us thus sayith the Lord now where
[7:49] is that in the scripture it's right
[7:51] there in the in the uh gospels right the
[7:54] you had to leave the Pharisees the
[7:56] Sadducees you had to leave any man-made
[7:58] denomination in order to follow the
[8:00] present truth right Hallelujah yes
[8:04] that's right even uh uh even uh you know
[8:07] we saw it with Ephesians in Acts 18 they
[8:11] had truth but they didn't have the
[8:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and so uh
[8:14] quill and Priscilla had to bring them
[8:16] higher to a greater Revelation now
[8:19] mainly it was the man right Aquilla but
[8:21] Priscilla must had some testimonies in
[8:23] there because there's no such thing as a
[8:24] woman preacher in the Bible she must had
[8:26] some testimonies in there a word of
[8:27] wisdom or a word of knowledge or
[8:28] something like that
[8:30] uh by God's grace okay but we see it all
[8:32] through the scripture anytime a group
[8:34] organizes now what every denomination
[8:35] does as the Bible tells us uh they make
[8:38] their own tradition right they make
[8:40] their own tradition and then if if the
[8:42] group fails to move on from that
[8:44] tradition into the full word of God then
[8:46] their worship becomes none effect right
[8:49] it becomes vain that's why God's had all
[8:51] these movements right from Luther to
[8:53] Wesley and brother tells us the Wesley
[8:55] movement was a rebuke to the Lutheran
[8:58] because the Lutheran wouldn't come out
[8:59] into more truth and then brother R said
[9:02] uh the Pentecostal move of zusa street
[9:04] was rebuked to the uh
[9:06] wesan right because they they wouldn't
[9:08] accept more truth and now brother R says
[9:10] his ministry uh point us to the Bible
[9:13] that's a rebuke to Pentecostals because
[9:15] they won't come out of wearing makeup
[9:17] wearing high heels sexy clothes all
[9:19] these things like that all their all
[9:21] their world it's a rebuke to them
[9:23] because they won't come out of that but
[9:24] we got to come out of it by God's grace
[9:26] and thank God we have hallelujah amen I
[9:29] I was raised as I said I was raised in
[9:31] assembly of God's sweetest people though
[9:33] I'm Ser so thankful but when you see a
[9:35] greater light you got to respond to the
[9:36] light amen every living plant when
[9:38] there's a light it grows to the light
[9:40] Hallelujah right a living a living being
[9:43] will will will gravitate and move and
[9:46] you know you've seen the plants and the
[9:47] vines they twist all over they'll do
[9:49] anything just to get there some light
[9:51] Hallelujah that's right glory to God so
[9:54] brother man tells this in 1961 he said
[9:56] he said the same things happened to the
[9:58] the church uh they PA went Methodist
[10:00] Baptist Presbyterian we got a degree out
[10:02] of Hartford or weaton we got a Bob Jones
[10:05] degree or a bachelor of art we got a DD
[10:07] LED what is it amount to a bunch of
[10:09] nonsense he said it's the way it was in
[10:12] Egypt and God never did deal with Israel
[10:15] till she came to her Homeland hear me
[10:19] thus sayeth the Lord he's talking about
[10:22] Israel coming out of Egypt and he's
[10:24] likening the denominations unto Egypt
[10:27] because they have worldliness in them
[10:29] because because they haven't moved on to
[10:30] the greater
[10:31] light thus say the Lord God will not
[10:34] deal with his church till she comes back
[10:36] to the
[10:37] Homeland right the message of the Hour
[10:39] come back to the original which is the
[10:41] original Church the book of Acts Church
[10:43] Hallelujah right it has no women
[10:45] preachers right uh has no
[10:48] crossdressers Glory Hallelujah he said
[10:51] get away from you this is a 1961 get
[10:54] away from the Methodist Baptist
[10:55] Presbyterian Pentecostal assemblies
[10:56] Oneness threeness he says Fess whatever
[10:59] is see anytime a man or a church puts a
[11:02] period and says this is all God's going
[11:04] to reveal they've just limited the Holy
[11:06] Spirit right there right and that's what
[11:08] he's talking about and remember brother
[11:10] says brother says in other quotes I'm
[11:12] not against the people they're good
[11:14] people it's the system of denomination
[11:17] I'm against because once they rally
[11:19] around these ideas and they fail to move
[11:22] on they fail to receive more of God's
[11:25] revelation okay he said it's all
[11:28] Antichrist movements because right look
[11:30] at the lutherans today look look at uh
[11:32] honey what was what ecl ecla you were
[11:35] raising okay she was raising the ecla
[11:37] now when she was growing up they had
[11:39] some things okay but now some of them
[11:41] now they're going so far right and you
[11:44] know
[11:45] homosexuality uh transgender all this I
[11:48] mean look look look what's happened and
[11:50] and brother Ram said this and people
[11:52] could take this so offensive but look
[11:53] it's an antichrist
[11:55] movement now they might have nice people
[11:58] in there and I'm sure everybody in there
[11:59] doesn't agree with what the denomination
[12:01] does but that's why Revelation 18 says
[12:04] come out of her my people hallelujah
[12:07] that you be not partakers of her sins
[12:08] and her plagues
[12:10] Hallelujah right it's the plague of
[12:12] homosexuality the the plague of
[12:14] transgenderism or the the plague of of
[12:17] crossdressing women preachers it's the
[12:19] plague it's a stain upon the church and
[12:22] so God says come out of her the mother
[12:24] heart at Rome and then all of her
[12:26] daughters come out of her my people that
[12:28] you be clean under the cleaning the
[12:30] washing of the water of the word
[12:32] hallelujah amen glory to God Amen now
[12:36] let's read that because you got it uh
[12:37] let's start go back to Matthew 15 let's
[12:39] read it just so you got
[12:41] it Matthew 15 talks about the
[12:43] denomination this if this isn't
[12:44] denomination that I don't know what one
[12:46] I don't know what one is because they
[12:49] they grow or I'm sorry they write down
[12:51] their their bylaws or their We Believe
[12:53] web page and they won't move from there
[12:55] in fact it just gets more corrupt as the
[12:57] years goes on now now CH could there be
[13:00] some faithful lutherans out there yes
[13:01] I'm sure there are I'm sure I mean
[13:03] faithful to what Luther taught you know
[13:05] there no doubt Wesley and Pentecostal no
[13:07] doubt about that and even message people
[13:09] right some message people they get off
[13:10] the beaten paath too right they make
[13:12] themselves a denomination around brother
[13:13] Ram's teachings they'll take a false
[13:15] Doctrine they'll make their own false
[13:16] Doctrine they'll make their own
[13:17] denomination well they got to come out
[13:19] of that now nobody is a a a subject I'm
[13:23] sorry no nobody's uh uh what's the word
[13:26] there exempt yeah no one's exempt from
[13:29] the enemy trying to bring in false
[13:30] Doctrine we all got to fight it off we
[13:32] all got to get the leaven out of us and
[13:34] the church said if if the Corinthian
[13:36] Church had to get the leaven out and
[13:38] Jesus said there's leaven of the
[13:39] Pharisees leav of the Sadducees leav of
[13:41] Herod there's all there's all these
[13:43] leavens and these sin addictions then we
[13:45] got to get ours out too praise God
[13:48] that's why we got to use church
[13:49] discipline and get sin out of the church
[13:51] hallelujah or else that's going to
[13:53] corrupt the church and you know what it
[13:55] does it creates such an atmosphere such
[13:57] a dismal atmosphere right it's a
[14:00] distraction to the Holy Spirit our
[14:02] attention needs to be on the Holy Spirit
[14:04] not on evil spirits Hallelujah that's
[14:06] right amen glory Matthew
[14:09] 15 verse uh now look in verse two it's
[14:14] why do thy disciples transgress are I'm
[14:16] just going to add this because you
[14:18] understand it a denominational tradition
[14:20] of the elders that's what it means see
[14:23] because they had Traditions you got to
[14:24] wash your hands and all these things it
[14:25] was a denominational tradition just like
[14:28] the traditions of spring sprinkling
[14:29] babies that's a denominational tradition
[14:31] you don't find that in the Bible
[14:33] Church the tradition of ordaining women
[14:36] like Rick Warren last what was a year a
[14:37] couple couple years ago he said he said
[14:39] oh now it's okay to ordain women
[14:41] preachers that's a lie from hell and all
[14:44] due respect to him you know as far as
[14:45] just being respectful no no anger no
[14:48] hatred but when you start transgressing
[14:49] against the word of God now you've got
[14:51] your own tradition and now the holy
[14:53] spirit's grieved and the worship is in
[14:56] vain is that right Church that's what
[14:59] Jesus said and so he says for they wash
[15:02] not their hands when they and that's not
[15:03] even in the Torah Moses never even wrote
[15:06] that they developed their own
[15:09] Creed but he answered and said to them
[15:12] why do you also transgress the attrition
[15:13] of God I love how Jesus turns it right
[15:15] back on him that's what we find all
[15:16] these people that accuse us we can just
[15:18] turn it right back on them why do you do
[15:20] this right Hallelujah for God commanded
[15:24] saying honor thy father and mother and
[15:26] he that curses father and mother let him
[15:28] die the death now skip down to verse uh
[15:31] six and honor not his father nor his
[15:33] mother he shall be free so they were
[15:35] given them excuses don't take care of
[15:36] your parents give that money instead to
[15:38] the the Pharisees and the sad Pharisees
[15:41] and he said you have made the
[15:43] Commandment of God of none effect by
[15:44] your
[15:46] tradition see Traditions or Creeds of
[15:49] man that are not found in the Bible they
[15:52] hinder the Holy Spirit and they make
[15:53] them verse seven they make them
[15:55] Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy in
[15:57] you saying this people draw unto me with
[15:59] their mouth and honor to me with their
[16:00] lips but their heart is far from me now
[16:01] here it is verse nine here's where it is
[16:03] a denomination if they're not careful it
[16:05] becomes vain worship now Church remember
[16:08] three years ago William and I walked
[16:09] into 12 different churches and church
[16:12] God's my witness in most churches people
[16:13] are just sitting there dead they're not
[16:15] even really worshiping God they're just
[16:17] there go through the song Everybody
[16:20] stand everybody kneel everybody stand
[16:21] where's where's the real contact with
[16:23] God where's somebody who really loves
[16:25] God hallelujah they're dead they're
[16:26] living brother said they're living off
[16:28] he said they're Liv living off the heat
[16:29] of a painted fire I love that it's like
[16:34] they talk about the Holy Ghost but he's
[16:35] not there Hallelujah they talk about the
[16:38] spirit they talk about miracles I'll say
[16:40] like this for our church they talk about
[16:41] the spirit of burning but where is the
[16:43] spirit of burning Hallelujah where's the
[16:46] spirit to burn out the sin in our lives
[16:48] hallelujah amen see so we must apply
[16:51] that to ourselves as well I can't I
[16:53] can't let the spirit or I I can't let
[16:56] this church become a
[16:57] denomination the first that Satan would
[16:59] want to do it would be me because I'm
[17:00] the pastor but I've got to overcome that
[17:03] evil spirit and I got to keep the fire
[17:05] of God in my life you got to keep the
[17:07] fire of God in your life we've got to
[17:09] keep the revival going praise God else
[17:12] we become a denomination to
[17:14] ourselves that's right but verse n but
[17:18] in vain they do worship me teaching for
[17:20] doctrines the Commandments of men now
[17:23] our family just started the video that I
[17:25] made last year we have over 110
[17:28] doctrines that brother brandom corrected
[17:30] the church on so that means almost every
[17:33] other church has hundreds I'll say this
[17:36] hundreds of uh scoops of leav I don't
[17:39] know what else to say
[17:41] it it's a leav of a woman Pastor right
[17:44] it's 11 of of homosexuality L of
[17:46] adultery L of all these things they have
[17:49] hundreds of scoops of
[17:51] leav but brother Ram cleaned out the
[17:54] house Hallelujah brother raham labored
[17:56] to get the church to clean be cleaned
[17:58] out because that's that's what he's
[17:59] saying here God won't deal with us until
[18:01] we get all the sin out of our lives and
[18:03] come back to the word of God hallelujah
[18:06] where there's no denomination right
[18:08] where where there's no Creed but Christ
[18:10] no book but the Bible no law but love
[18:13] hallelujah
[18:14] amen now the one I read uh previously
[18:17] was uh uh Revelation 18:4 most of you
[18:21] familiar with
[18:22] it and then we'll see how the she she's
[18:25] a she's a a mother of children if she's
[18:28] a mother she's got to have children why
[18:30] would the Bible waste its breath uh and
[18:32] say something wrong if if she's a mother
[18:34] and she don't have
[18:36] children and church you see all these
[18:38] people going back to the Catholic Church
[18:39] brother rod do you see it all these
[18:41] famous people going back they say going
[18:42] back to Mama that's what they say
[18:45] they're going back to the mother
[18:47] church I mean you can't see it you need
[18:50] some isav Hallelujah you need some Holy
[18:51] Ghost isav amen that's right Revelation
[18:57] 184 now actually you know what let's go
[18:59] down to verse two and church if this
[19:00] ain't the truth then uh we're blind but
[19:02] we're not blind we're we see it and he
[19:04] cried mightily with a strong voice
[19:05] saying Babylon the great is Fallen is
[19:06] Fallen has become the habitation of
[19:08] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[19:10] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[19:12] bird in other words every evil spirit
[19:15] dwells in the Roman Catholic church and
[19:16] I'm sure certainly not going to get
[19:17] popular for saying that right but look
[19:19] at it look at the child abuse look at
[19:22] the clergy abuse look at the money and
[19:24] the and the uh the wealth and all these
[19:27] things look at all this a false Doctrine
[19:31] intercession to dead people praying
[19:33] their intercession to evil spirits that
[19:36] church holds every demon in
[19:39] it and she's got
[19:42] daughters well look at verse
[19:44] four and I've heard another voice from
[19:46] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[19:48] that you be not partakers of her sins
[19:50] and that you receive not her plagues see
[19:53] so that that's why the Holy Spirit was
[19:55] in brother Braham saying this you've got
[19:57] to come out of these things he could
[19:59] have threw in Catholic in here he could
[20:00] have he could have threw in any Lutheran
[20:02] he could have threw any denomination
[20:04] because just give it a few years and if
[20:06] they don't stay with the Holy Spirit
[20:07] they're going to denominate develop
[20:09] their traditions and then God leaves
[20:11] them right they're not moving on the
[20:14] Holy Spirit God leaves them and I shared
[20:15] this last time I told my mom that that
[20:17] Vision brother brandom
[20:19] had and uh brother R said there'll be he
[20:21] said I saw the church dancing to rock
[20:23] and roll and I asked my mom she was
[20:24] raised in Assembly of God I you might
[20:26] remember this story and I said uh cuz I
[20:28] told a couple times I said Mom I said
[20:31] when you were born in 1950 in early in
[20:33] the church what are your earliest
[20:34] memories did they have rock and roll
[20:35] she's like oh no they just had the the
[20:37] grand piano or the spinet piano whatever
[20:38] they had I said Mom did you ever think
[20:40] there'd be rock and roll in your
[20:41] Assembly of God Church and she said no I
[20:43] never thought that but then around 2000
[20:46] or 2005 she started going to the youth
[20:48] conventions and to to get the kids hyped
[20:50] up and jumping they brought in rock and
[20:52] roll and then she said then they brought
[20:54] wrap in then they brought that crazy
[20:57] heavy metal in and and she said now they
[20:59] got everything and she said I really
[21:00] don't even like that part of the the
[21:02] meeting but she still goes because she's
[21:03] loyal to her denomination but I was
[21:05] telling Mom Mom you don't want to be
[21:06] loyal to denomination you want to be
[21:08] loyal to the word and I said in your
[21:10] life you have seen brother Ram's Vision
[21:12] fulfilled what a privilege now I was
[21:15] raised family of God too so I've seen
[21:16] some of that too I I guess I could say
[21:19] I've seen that very end of it because
[21:20] when I first came in oh it was it was
[21:22] nothing but piano and then now uh well
[21:25] at the church I went to they still got
[21:26] piano but at other churches like that
[21:29] it's like a rock and roll concert right
[21:31] they turn on the lights why you turnning
[21:32] on the lights like what what what's
[21:34] what's going on uh strange things happen
[21:36] in dark you know what I mean like we
[21:38] want all the lights on we want everybody
[21:40] to see what's going on we don't want any
[21:41] foolishness or anything like that we're
[21:43] not we're not the copy of the world
[21:44] we're supposed to come out of the world
[21:46] Hallelujah all right Revelation Chapter
[21:48] 2 where she's got
[21:51] daughters verse now in verse 20 it talks
[21:54] about that woman Jezebel who is Jezebel
[21:56] except the Roman Catholic Church
[21:59] right that's that's the woman Jezebel
[22:01] calls herself a prophetess right they
[22:02] call the pope they call the Pope's a
[22:04] prophet every word I'm sorry not every
[22:06] word but when he sits at the uh St
[22:08] Peter's Basilica it's he's infallible at
[22:10] that seat that's what the catechism says
[22:13] he's infallible when he sits at that
[22:14] seat St Peter's Basilica so they make
[22:16] him a prophet there now look at verse uh
[22:20] 22 and I will cast her into a bed and
[22:23] then that commit adultery with her into
[22:25] Great Tribulation except they repent of
[22:26] their deeds and I will kill her what
[22:29] children well who's the children of the
[22:31] Roman Catholic Church it's the
[22:32] denominations that came out but then
[22:34] went right back to her
[22:36] ways
[22:37] right Hallelujah see she got children
[22:41] with death and all the churches should
[22:42] know that I am he which searches the
[22:44] Reigns in the hearts and I will give
[22:46] unto every one of you according to your
[22:48] Works Hallelujah so see you can prove it
[22:51] by the Bible there's a mother church and
[22:53] then there's daughter churches and so
[22:56] this doesn't add anything to the Bible
[22:59] it vindicates the Bible Hallelujah it
[23:02] backs up the Bible it's it's just a
[23:04] modern understanding of what's already
[23:06] written in the
[23:08] scripture Hallelujah and then God will
[23:11] start dealing with the church
[23:14] Hallelujah that's right now the next one
[23:17] now brother gave us lots of thus sayith
[23:19] the Lord on Doctrine and this is kind of
[23:21] what I was talking about uh previously
[23:22] with over 110 I I I I made a list of 110
[23:26] doctrines brother random corrected and
[23:28] brother man said there's hundreds of
[23:29] them but I just haven't devoted time
[23:31] maybe this summer that's always my
[23:32] that's always my my idea maybe this
[23:34] summer I have all this time and then
[23:35] summer gets here and I feel like I'm
[23:36] busier than during the school
[23:38] year but here's brother Ram gave us thus
[23:41] sayith the Lord on all these doctrines
[23:42] and they're all found in
[23:44] scripture the church ages now that's
[23:47] what that's what Amos Amos 37 and8 I
[23:50] just got it's gonna take me time not
[23:54] Amos brother random revealed the secrets
[23:56] of who the Seven Stars are they're not
[23:58] not Heavenly Angels they're Earthly
[24:01] preachers right because why would Jesus
[24:03] say um John write a letter to Ephesus
[24:07] and tell that angel to do this and this
[24:09] and that why why would a man write to a
[24:11] Heavenly angel that makes no
[24:14] sense where can you find that any other
[24:17] time when does a Heavenly Angel need a
[24:18] message from a man written on
[24:21] parchment he doesn't he's actually he
[24:24] sent to the man not the man sent to the
[24:26] Angel and the church said their
[24:28] ministering Spirit sent to those who be
[24:30] Heirs of Salvation they're sent to us
[24:33] hallelujah they bring us messages the
[24:36] Angels comforted Jesus right after his
[24:38] temptation the angels are for us we're
[24:40] not for the Angels that's good that's
[24:43] fresh right there but God's
[24:45] grace so brother man gave us thus say
[24:47] the Lord on that he he gave us God did
[24:49] nothing except he revealed secrets to
[24:51] his servants the prophets brother R got
[24:53] the revelation of the church ages from
[24:55] Jesus Christ he got the revelation of
[24:57] the Seven Seals from Jesus Christ the
[25:00] revelation of all these things marriage
[25:01] and divorce modest clothing hair length
[25:03] baptism of Holy Ghost and I like this
[25:05] one classical preaching or I just say it
[25:08] today modern Joel oin preaching nothing
[25:10] against that Gody but he he he says it
[25:12] it's like a business it's all a business
[25:14] to him and he says that he won't preach
[25:17] on Abominations that means the people
[25:19] that means what is it unclean spirits
[25:21] are dwelling in that church if you don't
[25:23] clean it out if you don't preach against
[25:25] it it's going to live there just like
[25:27] revelation 18 said Hallelujah no nothing
[25:30] against a man I'm sure he's a nice man
[25:32] he looks nice you know he he looks he
[25:34] looks clean looks nice but by his
[25:36] Doctrine by their fruits they're
[25:38] known remember he said in that interview
[25:40] he'd go to a homosexuals wedding if they
[25:41] were friends and agree that God will
[25:44] bless an Abomination God will never
[25:46] bless an Abomination how do you know
[25:48] because he's the same yesterday today
[25:50] and forever Malachi 3:6 says I am the
[25:52] Lord and I change not Malachi glory
[25:56] amen God changes not Hallelujah it
[25:59] cannot change this ought to be an easier
[26:01] sermon to say Amen because I'm not
[26:03] preaching on you guys really ton much
[26:04] tonight okay I ought to get some more
[26:06] amens out of there that's that's okay if
[26:08] you don't
[26:09] amen I'm the
[26:12] pastor so at the end of the seventh seal
[26:14] brother man said now the vision that was
[26:16] the vision of going out west to the Snow
[26:18] White pyramid Cloud right we got a
[26:20] picture of it out there it was
[26:21] prophesied two months in advance with
[26:22] thus sayith the Lord he's going to meet
[26:24] a a a pyramid a constellation of
[26:26] Angels the Vision Plus the word plus the
[26:30] history brother man brought out from
[26:32] history on the church age and the Seven
[26:33] Seals plus the church ages and all
[26:35] Blends together it Blends beautifully
[26:37] together and so I could truly say that
[26:39] to the best of my understanding and
[26:41] according to the word of God and the
[26:42] vision the Revelation the interpretation
[26:44] thereof is thus saith the Lord now show
[26:48] me where Benny Hinn said that or Billy
[26:51] Graham or or Roberts or Joel ostein show
[26:54] me where any of these guys said that
[26:57] they didn't what why not cuz they're not
[26:59] prophets and all these other guys that
[27:01] say it they don't give any real I'm
[27:03] talking about the modern NR n guys uh
[27:06] New Apostolic re Reformation but they're
[27:08] not even prophets they're just pretend
[27:10] prophets because they miss all the time
[27:11] most of them miss when they said Trump's
[27:13] going to get two consecutive terms the
[27:15] Lord show me that the Lord showed you
[27:17] nothing the Bible that's right the Bible
[27:19] said you made that up in the imagination
[27:20] of your own heart your own dirty
[27:22] heart it wasn't the Lord that said that
[27:25] God doesn't lie
[27:26] Hallelujah said qualifies all of them
[27:29] right away show show me where anybody
[27:32] ever said something like this that had
[27:33] real Bible Vindication nobody did it
[27:36] that proves brother random is this
[27:37] Elijah for the end time
[27:41] Hallelujah now here look at this here
[27:43] church now this is not really a thus say
[27:45] th statement but look he's saying he
[27:47] he's talking about all these verses that
[27:49] God sent him to fulfill he said the
[27:51] Bible said Malachi 4 what would happen
[27:53] today the hearts of the children back to
[27:54] the fathers we looked at that a couple
[27:55] weeks ago Revelation 10 how the seals
[27:58] would be open and reveal all the
[27:59] Mysteries that's been hid through these
[28:01] reformers church we know what all the
[28:03] Seven Seals are we know what the four
[28:05] beasts are we know who the four horse
[28:07] riders are in the church
[28:08] said right we we know the fifth seals
[28:11] the Jews we know the six seals of
[28:12] tribulation we know the seven seal is
[28:14] the the the Rapture it's the moment
[28:16] unknown day and hour of the Rapture and
[28:17] it starts the beginning of the
[28:20] end Hallelujah brother an taught us that
[28:23] he said how it be done it's in the Bible
[28:26] thus sayith the Lord
[28:28] God has completely perfectly Vindicated
[28:31] that what he's perfectly Vindicated
[28:33] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 hallelujah
[28:37] it's been perfectly Vindicated
[28:38] Hallelujah if you've got eyes to see and
[28:42] ears to
[28:43] hear it's been perfectly
[28:46] Vindicated by the cloud and of course by
[28:49] also by the harmony of everything he
[28:51] taught it harmonizes with every other
[28:53] Bible verse
[28:58] that's
[28:59] right he Vindicated to be the truth by
[29:01] signs wonders in the heavens in the
[29:04] skies everything else for 33 years so
[29:07] he's talking about when he first got his
[29:09] seven major Visions in 1933 we went over
[29:11] it last time remember uh the seven major
[29:13] Visions I think I got it right up here
[29:15] remember that so said this was like his
[29:18] first major
[29:20] prophecy hallelujah oh yeah and I just
[29:22] heard well I heard Elon mus say it today
[29:24] that those cars come out next year
[29:26] without steering wheels that's what he
[29:28] said now of course they're always off a
[29:29] couple years right we've been hearing
[29:30] that since
[29:32] 2020 it's always one more year one more
[29:34] year one more
[29:36] year and so we see this you know we see
[29:39] yeah we see this the moral problem with
[29:41] women and the the Roman Catholic Church
[29:43] did you know most of and correct me if
[29:45] I'm wrong with Austin most of Trump's
[29:47] appointees are Roman Catholic his
[29:50] cabinet people how many knew that most
[29:54] of them are staunch Roman Catholics
[29:58] yeah it's true somebody sent me a video
[30:01] that I was like oh my Lord have
[30:04] mercy yes that's right he converted
[30:10] converted now brother is talking about
[30:13] when he prophesied that cloud we got a
[30:15] picture of there from February 28th
[30:17] 1963 and he said thus sayith the Lord he
[30:20] said he was going to meet seven angels
[30:21] that would commission him to go back
[30:22] east and preach the Seven Seals for
[30:25] Christ he said I saw the seven angels
[30:27] come didn't like magazine packet I got
[30:29] the Life magazine in my office that has
[30:31] it the fog it floated across here 27
[30:34] miles high 30 mil across he talks about
[30:36] the brothers that were there stood right
[30:38] there when them seven angels appeared
[30:40] right here on the hill it shook the
[30:41] hills for miles around there stood seven
[30:43] angels and throw a sword in his hand
[30:44] saying go home and open the Seven Seals
[30:46] that are given and here they are the
[30:48] true mystery of marriage and divorce and
[30:50] the serpent seed and all these things
[30:52] that's been fussed about it's thus
[30:54] sayith the Lord what a blessing Church
[30:58] we don't have uh maybe this is an man's
[31:00] idea this is the best commentary we got
[31:02] on it no friends we've got thus sayith
[31:04] the Lord
[31:05] hallelujah in other words something in
[31:07] something in the Seven Seals will will
[31:10] will agree with everything that's in the
[31:12] Book of Ezekiel or Jeremiah or the Book
[31:15] of Job
[31:16] Hallelujah it will all agree together
[31:19] nothing will break any continuity with
[31:22] God's word that's
[31:24] right now let me show you that marriage
[31:26] and divorcement it's been I think we
[31:27] went over a couple weeks ago go but just
[31:28] to refresh uh the Revelation on marriage
[31:31] and divorce brother R said is that
[31:33] there's only one cause a man can divorce
[31:35] a woman and then remarry and it's not
[31:38] even adultery it's not it's unconfessed
[31:42] fornication uh that the woman gave a
[31:45] false vow before they were married and
[31:47] then if he finds out and he doesn't love
[31:51] her he could put her away and remarry
[31:53] another that's the only cause so let's
[31:55] go to Matthew 19 then we'll go to
[31:56] Matthew 5 then m Matthew 1 we just go
[31:59] down right like that that's the only
[32:01] cause and every other church church I've
[32:04] listened to and I've been to numerous
[32:05] churches I've listen a lot of preaching
[32:07] on marriage and divorce every other
[32:08] church has it wrong brother Ram's the
[32:10] only one who points back and agrees with
[32:12] every
[32:13] scripture Matthew 19 and so and church
[32:16] wouldn't that make sense that means all
[32:18] the other denominations are allowing
[32:19] their people to be adulterers and church
[32:22] will adulterers inherit the kingdom of
[32:23] God no and so again it shows how their
[32:27] daughters of the
[32:30] mother they're produc they're not
[32:32] producing Sanctified they're not
[32:34] producing Sanctified fire baptized Holy
[32:36] Ghost Saints they're not producing it
[32:38] praise God because they let them live in
[32:41] sin
[32:43] Glory just got a little fiery Zeal here
[32:45] tonight by God's grace I got smile too
[32:47] by God's
[32:48] gra Matthew 19 there's only one
[32:52] cause verse 9 199 and I say unto you
[32:55] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[32:57] it be for fornication now how many know
[32:58] the Bible has to interpret the
[33:01] Bible so just just can't mean uh well
[33:04] someone committed foreign eation it
[33:06] can't mean that it's got there's got to
[33:08] be another Bible example now we'll get
[33:09] to it's in it's Mary and Joseph remember
[33:11] from Matthew chapter 1 and shall marry
[33:14] another committeth adultery and
[33:15] whosoever Marth her which is put away
[33:17] doth commit adultery now we don't have
[33:19] time but we could go to Romans 7 we go
[33:21] to First Corinthians and it shows uh you
[33:24] the man and wife are bound to each other
[33:26] until death in the New Testament and
[33:30] Jesus said there's only one cause for
[33:32] divorce and remarriage fornication but
[33:34] what kind of fornication that's what we
[33:36] see in uh Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew
[33:39] chapter 1 all right so go to Matthew
[33:46] 5 so if he if brother man was right on
[33:48] the Seven Seals and he's right on the
[33:49] seven Church ages and he's right on
[33:52] denominations well I think he's going to
[33:54] be right again on marriage and divorce
[33:55] don't you think that church Hallelujah
[33:58] when have you seen a prophet hit a
[33:59] couple things right in the name of the
[34:00] Lord and miss the other things in the
[34:02] name of the Lord they don't do it the
[34:04] only time it was confusing like we
[34:05] showed a few weeks ago was with Isaiah
[34:07] when God gave Hezekiah the permissive
[34:09] will of God or the other one was balum
[34:12] God said okay don't go they says okay go
[34:14] ahead and go because it's God giving
[34:16] someone their selfish permissive
[34:18] will right instead of the perfect will
[34:20] of God but that that doesn't mean God
[34:22] changed God did never God never changed
[34:25] his mind God knows the beginning from
[34:27] the end praise praise God he knew what
[34:29] they were going to ask for it was a
[34:31] test all right Matthew 5 I think it's 32
[34:34] I could be wrong but let me get there I
[34:36] got to turn one more page got 31 and it
[34:38] hath been said whosoever shall put away
[34:40] his wife let him give him her her a
[34:42] writing of divorcement verse 32 but I
[34:45] say unto you that whosoever shall put
[34:46] away his wife saving for the cause of
[34:48] fornication causes her to commit
[34:50] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[34:52] that is divorced committeth adultery now
[34:54] church we have no other divorce stories
[34:57] in the ENT entire New Testament that I'm
[34:58] aware of except Matthew chapter 1 it was
[35:02] a potential
[35:04] divorce but the Holy Ghost stopped it
[35:06] Hallelujah see how God hates divorce see
[35:09] how God God hates
[35:10] divorce let's go to Matthew
[35:13] 1 so see the Bible must interpret the
[35:17] Bible Jesus if he defined what marriage
[35:19] and divorce is then we have to find all
[35:22] the other Bible verses agreeing with it
[35:24] that's what Isaiah 28 said who can he
[35:26] teach Doctrine it's got to be line upon
[35:29] line precept upon precept word upon word
[35:32] amen scripture upon scripture verse upon
[35:35] verse
[35:37] Hallelujah see so Matthew chapter 1 this
[35:39] is why brother could stand there and say
[35:41] that's thus sayith the Lord after
[35:43] preaching marriage and divorce if you
[35:44] haven't listened to that listen to that
[35:46] what a
[35:47] message my
[35:51] goodness Matthew
[35:53] 1 now verse 18 now the birth of Jesus
[35:56] Christ was on this wise when as his
[35:58] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[36:00] before they came together she was found
[36:01] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[36:03] her husband being a just man not willing
[36:05] to make her a public example was minded
[36:07] to put her away privately so here he's
[36:08] going to divorce her why because they
[36:10] took a vow she said she was a virgin but
[36:13] then he finds out oh she's got child
[36:15] this is the case this is the only case
[36:17] where a man can divorce a woman he was
[36:19] going to put her away privately and then
[36:21] he was going to take another
[36:22] wife but see he Jo Joseph didn't
[36:25] understand what the Holy Ghost was doing
[36:27] so what do the Holy Ghost do he comes
[36:28] around and Crush
[36:29] Joseph but while he thought on these
[36:31] things behold the angel of Lord appeared
[36:33] on him in dream saying Joseph thou son
[36:34] of David fear not to take unto thee
[36:36] marry thy wife so that proves again once
[36:38] you say I do and you get engaged you're
[36:41] married in the sight of God we don't let
[36:43] our children grow up and change their
[36:45] engagements that's
[36:47] sin so once our children get engaged
[36:49] you're engaged for
[36:51] life and if you leave that one to marry
[36:53] another you're living in
[36:55] adultery now Americans don't know about
[36:57] that that's because they don't read
[36:58] their Bible the Bible hasn't changed
[37:00] America
[37:01] changed that's
[37:04] right for that which is conceived in her
[37:06] is of the Holy
[37:07] Ghost okay now look at verse 24 then
[37:10] Joseph being raised from his sleep did
[37:11] as the angel Lord had been him and he
[37:13] took unto him his wife and he knew her
[37:15] not till she had brought forth her
[37:17] firstborn son and he called his name
[37:18] Jesus now you know the Roman Catholic
[37:19] Church says Mary was an Ever virgin she
[37:22] and Joseph never came together that's
[37:24] that that verse will condemn all those
[37:25] Liars on the day of judgment
[37:28] because it said he knew her not
[37:30] till she had brought forth Jesus and the
[37:33] church said and there's Peter with the
[37:36] mother-in-law and you they'll say Peter
[37:37] was a pope he was no
[37:40] Pope he was no
[37:42] papa he was an apostle he was one sent
[37:46] by the Holy Ghost so see the Bible has
[37:49] to interpret the Bible so the only way
[37:53] that a man could divorce a wife and
[37:54] marry another is if after they get
[37:56] married they find out she lied and she
[37:58] committed fornication now if she had
[38:00] fornication before marriage all she has
[38:01] to do is confess confess it before they
[38:03] get engaged and he if he still wants to
[38:04] marry her praise the Lord God you know
[38:06] the man probably had fornication himself
[38:07] right the way the the day people are
[38:09] these days I mean so it's it's just sin
[38:11] you just got to confess everything you
[38:14] just want a per you just want an honest
[38:15] vow like the Book of Numbers I think
[38:16] it's numbers 18 we're not going to read
[38:17] it but numbers 18 says The Vow must be a
[38:20] pure vow must stand and so Jesus said
[38:23] there's only one reason there's only one
[38:25] case for marriage and divorce brother
[38:26] Brandon brought back to that no wonder
[38:29] he could say that's thus sayith the
[38:31] Lord and church every other church I
[38:33] know allows
[38:35] adulterers and then they'll allow those
[38:37] aduls to preach they'll allow the
[38:39] adulter aduls to be uh uh deacons or
[38:42] treasurers and all this what do you got
[38:44] a bunch of a bunch of adulterers running
[38:46] around what's supposed to be a pure
[38:49] church and the Bible said let a bishop
[38:51] be the husband of one wife not two not
[38:54] three like Paula White and she's even a
[38:57] woman
[38:58] all right yeah we're talking about Paul
[39:00] White God have mercy oh
[39:04] my now again he's telling this these are
[39:07] all similar quotes about how he's got
[39:08] thus sayith the Lord and He throw a
[39:10] sword in hand and said go home and open
[39:11] these Seven Seals that are given and
[39:12] here they are the true mystery of
[39:14] marriage and divorce and the serpent
[39:15] seed and all these things that's been
[39:16] fussed about it's thus sayith the Lord
[39:19] and church Mar serpent seed is thus
[39:21] sayith the Lord can you this struck me
[39:23] uh Cam and I were doing the podcast I
[39:25] put it out yesterday can you imagine
[39:27] most theologians think today that uh the
[39:31] Nephilim or the Giants came from Angels
[39:35] who could Fallen Angels demons who could
[39:37] create their own human bodies and then
[39:39] marry women and and and procreate with
[39:42] married with human women and then have
[39:45] half angel or half demon and human
[39:48] people that's what they believe and
[39:50] they'll look at us and say you're a
[39:52] heretic you believe uh Eve had adultery
[39:55] with a serpent and I'm like like you
[39:57] think I'm
[39:59] crazy you're the crazy
[40:01] one you think demons have power to
[40:04] create bodies they don't they don't have
[40:06] power to do that only God can do that
[40:09] Hallelujah and some of them are going as
[40:12] far as saying well see the sons of God
[40:13] saw the daughters of men and so these
[40:15] Fallen uh demons even had like wedding
[40:17] ceremonies with these women and created
[40:20] this half angel half uh hybrid race now
[40:23] the the truth is there is a hybrid but
[40:25] it's because the the the serpent was a
[40:27] beast of the field the Bible said he was
[40:29] so much like a man and whatever fruit
[40:32] they ate it produced two
[40:34] offsprings so it ain't an apple it ain't
[40:37] an apricot either praise God it's not a
[40:39] banana it's not an orange amen it's the
[40:43] fruit of
[40:44] adultery and brother R gave us thus
[40:47] sayith the Lord on serpent seed because
[40:50] it's it's God started serpent seed in
[40:53] Genesis 3:15 God's the one that said
[40:55] that it's thus sayith the Lord
[40:59] right whatever fruit they ate of in
[41:02] genes early in Genesis 3 Verse 6
[41:05] whatever fruit they ate of it caused
[41:06] them to be naked and brother B said if
[41:09] they ate apples someone needs to pass
[41:10] out the apples
[41:12] today so then these women will know
[41:14] they're
[41:16] naked right with their yoga pants and
[41:18] their bra straps or whatever we're
[41:20] talking about hanging out someone needs
[41:23] to pass out the apples
[41:25] today or realize oh maybe it wasn't
[41:28] apples maybe it was adultery that made
[41:30] them realize they were
[41:31] naked verse 15 who started the serpent
[41:35] who said there's two seeds was it was it
[41:37] a man was it brother brandom it was
[41:39] God and I will put hatred enmity between
[41:42] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[41:44] a woman doesn't have
[41:46] seed and her seed so God's going to give
[41:49] the woman seed through Adam and that's
[41:51] eventually going to become who
[41:53] Christ right through the woman's seed
[41:56] right or the woman's line there of
[41:58] course through Adam and
[42:00] Eve and it shall bruise thy head that's
[42:02] speaking of the calvary and thou shalt
[42:04] bruise his
[42:06] heel right so Jesus at Calvary he
[42:08] bruised the Serpent's head right he
[42:10] bruised Satan's power and we got the we
[42:13] got the Forgiveness of the blood of
[42:14] Jesus Christ we got the power of the
[42:16] Holy Ghost Satan's power against us is
[42:18] limited and the church said am the Bible
[42:22] said Jesus died to destroy the works of
[42:24] the devil in our lives hallelujah amen
[42:27] in
[42:28] Hebrews right but who said there's two
[42:30] seeds God said there's two
[42:33] seeds and whatever fruit they ate of it
[42:36] went and caus them to cover their
[42:37] private their
[42:39] loins when does eating an apple make you
[42:41] want to cover your loins it doesn't and
[42:44] why are all the punishments on
[42:47] Eve and in and they all relate to
[42:50] Bringing forth seed or
[42:52] children because that because she
[42:54] accepted the wrong seed from the serpent
[42:58] hallelujah it's all about and why does
[43:00] her desire now got to be to her husband
[43:02] after the fall because her desire was to
[43:05] the
[43:06] serpent
[43:08] Hallelujah huh why do it got to be on
[43:10] her husband now I thought I thought it
[43:11] was on her husband before it wasn't she
[43:13] was looking at the fruit of adultery and
[43:14] like oh this is good for the eyes oh
[43:16] this is good this is
[43:18] good see and now it's got to go there
[43:22] and remember at the end of uh chapter 3
[43:24] the Bible said uh the Bible said Adam
[43:28] calls her name Eve because she's a
[43:29] mother how is she a mother if they ate
[43:33] apples she's a mother because she's
[43:35] received two
[43:37] seeds and then in chapter four you have
[43:39] twins born Cain and
[43:41] Abel two two two seeds from two
[43:43] different seed sers one field two seed
[43:46] sewers there it is Matthew 13 one field
[43:50] two
[43:51] sers amen Glory Hallelujah and that's
[43:54] what Paul said let's go to Second
[43:56] Corinthians 11
[43:58] Paul said I don't want you uh given over
[44:01] to adultery like Eve in other words the
[44:03] deception of her mind second Corinthians
[44:06] 11 verse two for I'm jealous over you
[44:08] with The Godly jealousy I've espoused
[44:10] you I've engaged you to one husband that
[44:12] I may present you as a Chase virgin to
[44:14] Christ so he's saying Corinthians I want
[44:16] you to be virgin not like Eve who lost
[44:19] her
[44:20] virginity verse three but I fear lest by
[44:22] any means as the serpent begou Eve
[44:24] through his subtility so your mind
[44:27] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[44:29] that's in Christ so Paul connects losing
[44:32] virginity with Eve getting tricked by
[44:35] the
[44:36] devil
[44:40] hallelujah how about Peter Peter said
[44:43] the same thing he said sin entered the
[44:44] world through
[44:46] lust not through a desire for fruit
[44:49] through lust let's go there second Peter
[44:52] chapter 1
[44:57] uh I'm only at 40 minutes my goodness
[45:00] Glory feel pretty good second Peter
[45:03] chapter 1 sin did not enter the world
[45:06] through uh looking at a fruit tree like
[45:08] oh my I can't wait to eat this fruit it
[45:10] entered through lust which is a
[45:11] forbidden
[45:14] craving all right second Peter chapter
[45:18] 1 verse four whereby are given unto us
[45:22] exceeding great and precious promises
[45:24] that by these ye might be partakers of
[45:25] the divine nature have having escaped
[45:27] the corruption that's in the world
[45:28] through lust lust it was lust and
[45:33] whatever they partook of It produced two
[45:38] seeds right now go to Proverbs uh 30 is
[45:42] it Proverbs
[45:44] 30:20 I'm just going off the memory of
[45:46] the Holy Spirit right now by God's grace
[45:49] proverbs 30
[45:52] verse2 yep that's right that's right
[45:54] thank the Lord
[45:57] guess all those years of study pay off
[45:59] sometimes but
[46:03] awesome what was the fruit in the garden
[46:05] what was the fruit the Bible tells us
[46:07] right
[46:08] here such is the way of an adulterous
[46:11] woman so Eve sin produced an adultery
[46:14] that was the fruit the fruit of adultery
[46:15] it start it first started in here right
[46:18] sin cons sin uh sin enticed sin
[46:21] conceived and then she committed the sin
[46:24] and then it produced death but the adult
[46:26] adultery started here the sin was here
[46:29] but the fruit of that evil thought was
[46:33] adultery such is the way of an
[46:35] adulterous woman she eats eating is
[46:38] liken unto
[46:39] adultery where's it's got to agree with
[46:41] the rest of the Bible amen where's that
[46:43] in the Bible Genesis chapter
[46:46] 3 hallelujah it's got to agree with the
[46:48] rest of the Bible it don't say it don't
[46:51] say apples it says adultery is like an
[46:54] eating right she eateth she wipeth her
[46:57] mouth and saying she's saying I've done
[46:59] no wickedness it's right there hiding in
[47:03] plain sight and the church said brother
[47:05] bam said you got to read between the
[47:07] lines right it's right there but you
[47:10] gotta you got to understand everything
[47:12] else around there you got to read right
[47:13] that's good virtue right there you want
[47:14] to read right right there she's putting
[47:17] up her fingers like that you gotta read
[47:18] between the lines
[47:19] see adultery is a fruit adulter is a
[47:22] fruit that's the fruit they partook of
[47:25] in the garden that's why you produce
[47:27] Cain and the Bible said Cain is not of
[47:29] Adam Cain was of the wicked one first
[47:33] John if you get it before I do I think
[47:35] it's two or
[47:37] three well read that Cain was not of uh
[47:41] Adam Cain was of the wicked
[47:46] one yeah verse chapter 3 vers2 312 1
[47:50] John
[47:51] 312 not as Cain who is of that Wicked
[47:54] one well now those are fighting words
[47:55] you're you're calling Adam a wicked W
[47:57] one well that's almost fighting words
[47:58] right there a Son of God you're calling
[48:00] a Son of God a wicked one no sir sons of
[48:03] God are blessed not cursed
[48:06] Hallelujah now of course we wouldn't
[48:07] fight I'm talking spiritually get out my
[48:09] my sword get out my
[48:11] Bible I don't want to cause any
[48:14] confusion and slew his brother wherefore
[48:16] he slew him because his own Works were
[48:18] evil and his brothers righteous and
[48:21] brother raham said we got thus saith the
[48:24] Lord on that I heard something pretty
[48:27] astounding too this is totally unrelated
[48:29] but this was an astounding scripture I
[48:30] heard today now it might not be to you
[48:32] so bear with me but in Luke 16 the rich
[48:37] man of Lazarus go to the heart of the
[48:38] Earth right and what does the rich man
[48:40] say let me go back and so they'll
[48:43] believe right but what does Abraham say
[48:47] no even if someone come back from the
[48:49] dead they won't believe even if they've
[48:51] been to Hell he said they got the
[48:53] scriptures to
[48:54] believe Church there is so much power
[48:56] power just in the word of God if you
[48:59] really believe this with all your heart
[49:01] and soul then you won't want to miss
[49:02] church praise
[49:04] God look everybody's faithful church
[49:06] members here you're faithful to your
[49:08] church yes we just love the we just love
[49:09] the word of God see all these signs
[49:11] wonders and miracles are experience that
[49:13] people have if that doesn't make them
[49:14] love the word more they've missed it now
[49:18] you know why this struck me so hard
[49:19] because all these false Apostles these
[49:22] these modern NR n people they all say
[49:24] they go down to Hell and God sent them
[49:26] sent them back to warn people about it
[49:28] well let me give you some news the Bible
[49:30] said that won't help
[49:32] anybody I thought that was astounding to
[49:35] me I was in my car I literally went what
[49:38] that wasn't a very good face but that
[49:39] was my Revelation face like
[49:41] what and all these people say God sent
[49:44] me down to Hell and showed me to come
[49:46] back and give me a Ministry to tell you
[49:47] about hell don't they know that's not
[49:49] even gonna and then then all their
[49:50] stories on hell are different all their
[49:53] stories on Heaven are different it's a
[49:54] lie that's from hell that's a deception
[49:57] from Hell the word of God is truth
[49:59] hallelujah amen if you won't just
[50:02] believe the written word of God you're
[50:04] not fit for heaven Hallelujah but if we
[50:07] believe the written word of God then
[50:08] we're fit for heaven hallelujah we're
[50:10] fit to be called the Sons and Daughters
[50:12] of God we're fit to rule and reign in
[50:14] the Millennium
[50:16] hallelujah thank God so I'll take any
[50:19] experience but make sure it goes back to
[50:21] the word of God hallelujah and if it
[50:23] don't throw it away get you some new
[50:25] ones Hallelujah
[50:27] and start with the experience of reading
[50:28] your Bible every day I'm not preaching
[50:30] you guys I'm preaching out
[50:33] there but I guess it's for the little
[50:34] ones too by God's
[50:37] grace H thus sayith the
[50:40] Lord church we are not playing around we
[50:43] know we got thus sayith the Lord look
[50:45] what they believe an apple produced all
[50:49] this
[50:50] trouble look what they believe angels
[50:52] can create their own bodies if that was
[50:54] the case brother cam brought out this
[50:55] beautiful point I don't know if he got
[50:56] it from somebody else he said if they
[50:57] can create their own
[50:59] bodies why don't Satan just keep
[51:01] creating bodies and he can kill all the
[51:04] humans when did he lose that power to
[51:06] create bodies it was after the
[51:09] fall but Cam said no look he said look
[51:12] Satan still has to fill he had to fill
[51:15] Judas I was like brother cam you got
[51:17] some Revelation man
[51:19] Hallelujah why why don't he just create
[51:20] his
[51:21] own if angels could do that then why
[51:23] can't they do it now see the Bible will
[51:26] never come contradict itself amen
[51:28] hallelujah we live by every word that
[51:30] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[51:32] hallelujah see their lies are going to
[51:34] find them out eventually and the truth
[51:36] will
[51:37] prevail glory to
[51:40] God brother cam made at the same point
[51:42] too why with the Antichrist we believe
[51:43] it's gonna be the pope or Donald Trump
[51:45] or Elon Musk but I believe it's gonna be
[51:47] the
[51:48] pope but why don't he just Why don't
[51:50] Satan just create his own body rather
[51:53] than fill another person's body
[51:56] if he did that in the beginning to make
[51:58] Giants why don't he do it now bunch of
[52:01] nonsense and then they'll call you and I
[52:03] ridiculous for believing all those
[52:05] scriptures that we just went through and
[52:07] that's not even half of them I got three
[52:10] videos on it you could spend you can
[52:12] spend hours on it I have I wrote a
[52:16] chapter about it and where's all these
[52:18] people trying to correct it there's
[52:20] nobody trying to correct it because they
[52:21] don't have anything to correct because
[52:23] it it was sent to us from a prophet
[52:26] pointing us back to Jesus Christ's word
[52:28] the Bible hallelujah amen GL I'm feeling
[52:31] a little embolden here tonight by God's
[52:32] grace he said what is it it's the
[52:34] quickening power coming to the church
[52:36] making her ready this hour that we're
[52:38] approaching in quickening power oh God
[52:40] help us to receive it help us to believe
[52:41] it see just depends on what attitude you
[52:43] take whether it's going to do you any
[52:45] good or not though see you have to
[52:47] believe that you don't believe that it
[52:48] won't do you one bit of good what about
[52:49] all these people that leave brother
[52:50] brandom's message see it don't do them
[52:53] any good if they don't believe it's the
[52:54] scripture you got to believe it's the
[52:57] scripture because that's what we're all
[52:58] pointing
[52:59] to that's what I fall in love with since
[53:01] I became in the message of of the Bible
[53:03] brother brandom I fall in love with the
[53:05] scripture I'm not going to Fall in Love
[53:07] with a Church Creed I left all that to
[53:09] come out and and and to come out with
[53:11] God's people and believe just the word
[53:13] of God and that's the way we want to
[53:15] stay we want to have an attitude we want
[53:17] to have a respectful attitude and
[53:18] receive thus sayith the Bible thus say
[53:20] the word of God because God sent a
[53:22] prophet to reveal his secrets to us
[53:24] hallelujah amen amen remember these
[53:28] secrets are for us and our
[53:31] children so thank God my children have
[53:33] received it by God's
[53:35] grace Hallelujah let's read that
[53:38] Deuteronomy 29:29 I got that one
[53:39] memorized too by by the help of the Lord
[53:41] not my
[53:43] help Deuteronomy
[53:48] 29:29 see Mysteries are for the people
[53:51] of God remember Paul even said we
[53:52] preached on them months ago uh we speak
[53:55] the wisdom of God in Mysteries they
[53:56] can't even understand what we're
[53:58] saying because they're not the children
[54:00] of
[54:01] God remember Jesus told the Pharisees he
[54:04] said you can't understand my speech
[54:05] because you're not my
[54:07] children Church you ought to thank God
[54:09] you have ears to hear the
[54:11] truth hallelujah most people can't
[54:14] receive it they love the world and Jesus
[54:16] the Bible said if you love the world the
[54:18] love of God's not even in you praise
[54:20] God that's why they don't care to read
[54:22] their Bibles or come to church or be
[54:24] faithful to God or listen to they won't
[54:26] even listen brother brand they'll just
[54:27] hear something and then condemn brother
[54:28] brandom same thing they do to Jesus
[54:31] right it would be the same thing they do
[54:32] to Paul they do the same thing to any
[54:34] any true servant of God just condemn
[54:37] them and the Bible said he that answers
[54:38] a matter before he heareth it it's a
[54:40] shame and Folly unto him see they're
[54:43] shameful they're full of folly they're
[54:46] fools to judge the ministry of brother
[54:48] randam before actually searching it out
[54:50] by the scripture and we could have said
[54:52] that about Martin Luther right same
[54:53] thing same thing John Wesley uh aus stre
[54:56] what the name uh what's the name of the
[54:58] zus street man William Seymour thank you
[55:00] and by the end he had the right
[55:01] Revelation on a lot of things by the end
[55:03] of it he had to go through some awful
[55:04] trials but he had the right
[55:07] Revelation uh by the end of it didn't
[55:10] live very long because a servant of God
[55:11] like that all the pressure all the uh
[55:14] all all the difficult life Deuteronomy
[55:17] 29:29 uh am I there
[55:20] no let's let's read 29 together got your
[55:23] Bibles let's read on three one two three
[55:24] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[55:27] Our God but those things which are
[55:29] revealed belong unto us and to our
[55:32] children forever that we may do all the
[55:35] words of this law why are these
[55:37] Mysteries revealed so we can keep the
[55:39] commands Jesus said if you love me keep
[55:42] my commands that's why our church is
[55:45] keeping the commands while other
[55:46] denominations are
[55:49] not most of the adults here were raised
[55:51] in denomination uh sister Nomi was the
[55:53] only one blessed to be raised in the
[55:55] message here
[55:57] bless their
[55:59] heart but all of us then in
[56:01] denominations have seen the Folly of
[56:03] denominations we could all raise our
[56:04] hands see the Foles of the denominations
[56:07] we were raised in and God brought us out
[56:10] of that so we so we would believe the
[56:13] word of God and live all the word of God
[56:17] hallelujah and they belong to us and
[56:20] we're supposed to pass it on to our
[56:21] children this is how you serve God this
[56:24] is how you believe God this is how you
[56:26] please God this how you please God young
[56:30] man that's how you do it the revelation
[56:33] of God comes to you and look now they
[56:35] know how to do marriage and divorce
[56:36] before they wouldn't know they'd be
[56:38] adulterers but they're for us and for
[56:40] our
[56:41] children Hallelujah I'm at okay at 53
[56:44] minutes
[56:45] okay

[56:52] dressed women here let me see is there a
[56:54] thus say the Lord in here
[56:59] oh well here brother yeah here's a good
[57:01] one okay
[57:02] yeah okay yeah this one's on uh hair
[57:05] hair

[57:08] that would wear shorts now look at they
[57:11] they do less than that she's counted as
[57:13] a prostitute the same as the woman in
[57:14] the act of prostitution see she doesn't
[57:17] know that how does she know her ultimate
[57:19] what's her what's an ultimate it's the
[57:20] last word the ultimate is the amen the
[57:22] so be it it's the end of all Strife your
[57:24] ultimate and if your church a
[57:25] Pentecostal Church that tells you long
[57:27] hair and stuff is just fanaticism you
[57:29] got a spare tire the back of your head

[57:32] man is possessed of the
[57:34] devil a man that'll let a woman cut her
[57:37] hair he's possessed by the
[57:40] devil because the Bible said it's a
[57:42] shame now that word shame means repulse
[57:45] or disgusting thing in the Greek I pre I
[57:48] I did a video on it I preached on
[57:50] that she brings shame on her husband and
[57:53] then that brings shame on who Christ and
[57:55] who does that bring shame on the
[57:57] invisible father because it's father son

[58:10] yep yeah let's read that we'll just
[58:12] finish with this one
[58:13] here that man's possessed with a devil
[58:17] because Church all you have to do now
[58:18] Rod probably knows history all you have
[58:19] to do is go to the Roaring 20s what's
[58:21] the first thing they did to get their
[58:22] independence they cut off their hair
[58:24] that's right you didn't you send me a
[58:25] letter yes I still got that somewhere in
[58:27] my
[58:29] piles that's
[58:32] right no go ahead brother
[58:41] yes that's
[58:49] right that's
[58:52] right but she wasn't following the
[58:54] Methodist way
[58:58] right that she tried her
[59:01] hair oh that's right the friend was okay
[59:03] the friends one to
[59:06] cut that's right wonderful okay your
[59:09] grandmother was found the word yes
[59:13] wonderful that's right that's right yes
[59:17] thank you I yes I knew there was a
[59:18] connection yes s again I think my grand
[59:22] right right I don't want to that's what
[59:24] I misunderstood shees a Saint she's not
[59:27] a
[59:28] haint very good brother very good and if
[59:31] you just study the 1920s that they first
[59:33] cut off their hair then they put on uh
[59:36] uh they put on the the short skirts
[59:39] right then they went out partying at
[59:40] night what they call them there the uh
[59:41] Flappers that's what they call Flappers
[59:44] and they dancing all night and
[59:45] drunkenness and all these things like
[59:46] that and look what God did God brought a
[59:48] depression upon the people to try to
[59:50] wake him up and it did shake the country
[59:51] up because by the 1950s Church
[59:53] attendance was at its highest so God
[59:55] sent the depress ression and the war to
[59:57] try to shake the country before brother
[59:58] raham gave her her last chance in 1956
[1:00:00] brother Braham said thus sayith the Lord
[1:00:02] you have your last chance it was 50
[1:00:03] years since
[1:00:05] 1906 he said either this year you'll
[1:00:07] accept the Revival of his ministry and
[1:00:09] all the brothers preaching that or
[1:00:10] you'll go into destruction and look
[1:00:12] where she's at
[1:00:13] today thus sayith the Lord church we
[1:00:16] have thus sayith the Lord hallelujah
[1:00:18] we've been visited with thus said the
[1:00:20] Lord from a genuine prophet of
[1:00:22] God now 1 Corinthians 11 that's actually
[1:00:25] where I was goingon to I was almost
[1:00:26] ready to preach on Corinthians 10 and 11
[1:00:28] here tonight but uh I thought well I
[1:00:30] want to preach this because I want to
[1:00:31] review all these thus say the Lord I
[1:00:33] because I want to get them in I want to
[1:00:34] get all of them on this slide or this
[1:00:37] presentation
[1:00:39] here okay now verse three every man
[1:00:42] praying or prophesying having his head
[1:00:43] covered desth his head now our our dear
[1:00:47] uh our dear Amish friends and our dear
[1:00:49] menite friends think it's a
[1:00:51] cap but there's not one word in the
[1:00:53] Bible that talks about a cloth cap the
[1:00:56] covering is the
[1:00:58] hair verse 15 says it but if a woman
[1:01:00] have long hair it's a glory to her her
[1:01:02] hair is given her for a cloth covering
[1:01:04] no just a covering good you C
[1:01:08] that the hair is the covering and church
[1:01:11] remember when I told that to those women
[1:01:12] out there brother it was a New Year's no
[1:01:15] it was Christmas eve two years ago when
[1:01:17] I shared that to the women there they
[1:01:19] were depressed those uh the former Amish
[1:01:21] women I shared it in that room over
[1:01:23] there the night I shared that with them
[1:01:26] they said all the all the uh all the
[1:01:29] pressure all the Demonic pressure to
[1:01:31] wear that cap came off they took him off
[1:01:33] but that night the devil attacked me and
[1:01:36] took away my breathing at a little after
[1:01:38] midnight and I couldn't breathe and I
[1:01:40] thought I was going to die I was running
[1:01:41] around I was running around the room and
[1:01:42] I ran to the bathroom and finally my
[1:01:44] wife said Jesus Jesus and I felt that it
[1:01:46] was someone was choking me I felt it go
[1:01:48] off me and that was the demon that
[1:01:51] didn't like to being exposed Church
[1:01:54] there's a real God and there's a real
[1:01:55] devil thank God for a faithful
[1:01:58] wife thank God for the word of
[1:02:01] God and now every one of them now they
[1:02:03] finally feel free to take it off because
[1:02:05] it was it's the bondage it's the had a
[1:02:08] bondage if you take it off oh you're a
[1:02:10] heathen you're you're dead to us a
[1:02:14] cloth so they made that cloth the
[1:02:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost just like
[1:02:19] brother am's son they make plain tapes
[1:02:21] the baptism Holy Ghost that's not the
[1:02:23] baptism it's a experience where God
[1:02:25] comes into your soul and fills your soul
[1:02:27] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:02:29] not a piece of cloth it's not playing a
[1:02:31] tape it's not going to a certain church
[1:02:33] it's Jesus Christ it's Christ in you the
[1:02:36] hope of Glory Hallelujah and if you got
[1:02:38] it it'll guide you into all truth I got
[1:02:41] one minute left okay perfect timing
[1:02:43] could it be any better than that by
[1:02:44] God's gra I got a 30 minute song service
[1:02:47] and an hour sermon in one sermon or one
[1:02:49] service what's going on here there's a
[1:02:51] transformation going on here verse verse
[1:02:55] five but every every woman that prayeth
[1:02:56] or prophesieth with her head uncovered
[1:02:58] dishonor that means
[1:03:00] repulse disrespects repulses her
[1:03:04] husband for that is even all as if she
[1:03:07] were saving so even if she trims it it's
[1:03:09] the same as cutting it all off look what
[1:03:11] Miley Cyrus did that's those look at
[1:03:13] Britney Spears what do they do when they
[1:03:14] Rebellion they cut off their
[1:03:16] hair right to show their and and from
[1:03:19] what I've heard recently Britney Spears
[1:03:21] was under control of her dad I guess he
[1:03:22] was stealing all her money or something
[1:03:23] like that so that's why she cut it off
[1:03:24] to show she's not under
[1:03:26] his uh bondage or
[1:03:29] whatever let see that's what it says
[1:03:31] verse six for if the woman be not
[1:03:33] covered let her also be Shor so if she
[1:03:34] don't want to let her hair grow uncut
[1:03:37] she might as well be Shor Paul says just
[1:03:39] shave it all off if you're not going to
[1:03:40] honor
[1:03:41] God and church this still stands i' I've
[1:03:44] challenged people for years show me one
[1:03:46] verse where God asked a Godly woman to
[1:03:48] cut her hair there's
[1:03:50] none but every time I'll show you it was
[1:03:53] always evil women who cut their hair e
[1:03:56] it was always right it was always evil
[1:03:58] woman that wear makeup
[1:04:04] Hallelujah so and then and then they say
[1:04:07] oh we speak where the Bible speaks and
[1:04:09] we're silent where the Bible's
[1:04:11] silent well the Bible's silent on Godly
[1:04:13] women cutting their hair right so that
[1:04:16] means it's speaking they're supposed to
[1:04:17] never cut their hair and then you have
[1:04:19] this there's my hour then you have this
[1:04:20] entire first 16 verses where a woman is
[1:04:24] never to cut her hair
[1:04:27] see now verse seven for a man indeed
[1:04:29] ought not to cover his head U for as
[1:04:32] much he's the image and glory of God but
[1:04:33] that woman is the glory of the man now
[1:04:35] I'm going to skip down to finish up
[1:04:37] here verse 13 judging yourselves is it
[1:04:40] calmly or is it correct that a woman
[1:04:42] pray to God
[1:04:45] uncovered so or seemly is it right that
[1:04:48] a woman prays to God with her haircut
[1:04:50] doth not even nature itself teach you
[1:04:52] that if a man have long hair it's a
[1:04:53] shame un him because 40% of men go ball
[1:04:56] hey God bless you R you haven't lost
[1:04:57] your hair praise
[1:04:59] God that's what I know I'm going to get
[1:05:01] too my grandpa had his hair thin out too
[1:05:04] uh but see even nature itself 40% yeah I
[1:05:07] was looking I was at a a meeting there
[1:05:08] with with hundreds of teachers the other
[1:05:09] day I looked at almost every man had a
[1:05:11] bald head
[1:05:12] bald oh thank God I still got
[1:05:15] here brother brother BR went bald and he
[1:05:17] had to buy he had to wear a wig because
[1:05:19] if he didn't wear it he gets sick you
[1:05:20] know all the cold air blowing
[1:05:24] in verse 15 but if a woman have long
[1:05:26] hair a glory to her for her hair is
[1:05:28] given her for covering but if any man
[1:05:30] seem to be contentious we have no such
[1:05:32] that word such means other no other
[1:05:34] custom neither do the Churches of God
[1:05:37] see some people read that say well see
[1:05:38] Paul said oh you don't have to follow it
[1:05:40] that's not what he's saying he said we
[1:05:41] have no other practice Yeah if you look
[1:05:42] in the other translations it's no other
[1:05:45] practice there's no other way we handle
[1:05:47] hair than this in all the Churches of
[1:05:50] God because again show me one verse
[1:05:53] where Paul said women can cut their hair
[1:05:56] you're not going to find it now the last
[1:05:58] one as we uh I'm trying to close I'm not
[1:06:00] try not to go over 1 Timothy 2 verse 9 I
[1:06:03] think it
[1:06:04] is and I hold I wrote a whole book on
[1:06:07] modesty so uh if people can't see it
[1:06:11] it's just because they're ignorant they
[1:06:12] they're they're willingly ignorant
[1:06:13] that's the worst kind of ignorance
[1:06:15] they're willingly trying to avoid it if
[1:06:17] they don't want to understand remember
[1:06:19] the Bible defines it you got to cover
[1:06:21] from the shoulder down to the shin at
[1:06:22] least then I ask our sisters to go lower
[1:06:24] because I do you don't see me we walk
[1:06:26] around with with half shorts on or skirs
[1:06:29] or what are they called what what what
[1:06:31] are the men those long shorts men wear
[1:06:34] what do they call nickers yeah yeah I
[1:06:36] don't see me walk around like that see
[1:06:38] how much sun I can get on my
[1:06:41] calves goodness
[1:06:42] gracious see the man's got to model
[1:06:45] modesty he's the leader of the church
[1:06:47] he's the leader of the family he's got
[1:06:48] to be the
[1:06:50] example
[1:06:52] right 2 verse 9 in like manner also so
[1:06:55] that women Adorn themselves in modest
[1:06:57] appar with shamefacedness and sobriety
[1:06:59] not with broided hair that means
[1:07:01] expensive hairstyles or gold or pearls
[1:07:03] or costly array lyia has a lot of great
[1:07:05] pictures from the times of Rome where
[1:07:06] they had super expensive hairstyles I
[1:07:08] need to show the church that that was a
[1:07:09] that was a marvelous F there great
[1:07:12] job I need to compliment All My Children
[1:07:15] sometimes I leaves some out all right
[1:07:18] let's stand and let me read this for
[1:07:20] God's word said it's a shame for a woman
[1:07:21] to cut her hair she'll dishonor her head
[1:07:23] musician can if she dishonors her
[1:07:25] husband and her husband is the church
[1:07:27] and the church is Christ she's
[1:07:28] dishonorable religious prostitute naked
[1:07:31] and don't know it naked don't the Bible
[1:07:33] say the woman's covering is her hair
[1:07:34] isn't her hair given to her for a
[1:07:35] covering and the church said look
[1:07:37] brother man says someday Yonder at the
[1:07:39] Judgment bar I've tried to pour the
[1:07:41] medicine the medicine of 1 Corinthians
[1:07:43] 11 the medicine of 1 Timothy 2:9 I've
[1:07:45] tried to pour that in your mouth and
[1:07:47] hold it in with my hands and you spit it
[1:07:49] right back out between your fingers God
[1:07:51] will judge them someday that's thus
[1:07:54] sayith the Lord just like Jeremiah
[1:07:56] Ezekiel and Isaiah they told them told
[1:08:00] them told them and they just didn't want
[1:08:02] to obey they got more stiff neck they
[1:08:05] got more rebellious same thing brother
[1:08:07] Bram experienced the majority of the
[1:08:09] people just kept cutting their hair
[1:08:10] wearing makeup wearing pants all these
[1:08:12] things and he said on the day of
[1:08:14] judgment that's what it'll be like I
[1:08:16] tried to give you the medicine but you
[1:08:18] spit out the medicine you spit out the
[1:08:20] word of God Church let's swallow the
[1:08:23] word of God I said it before if if you
[1:08:25] swallow the word of God life will
[1:08:27] swallow up your body at the
[1:08:29] Rapture if you swallow it now death will
[1:08:31] be swallowed up in
[1:08:33] life amen glory to God we must swallow
[1:08:37] the word of God right now it hasn't been
[1:08:39] a bunch of foolishness or some crazy old
[1:08:41] man all man all worked up it isn't
