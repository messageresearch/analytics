========================================

U this is a thought that came to me while I was reading through the book of Jeremiah got through that and now I'm going through the book of Hosea by God's grace but I just came across a numerous string of scriptures um I'll get to those here as we preach the word of God today Hallelujah 2 Timothy 2:19 i' like to preach on the Lord knoweth them that are his Hallelujah second Timothy 219 praise God the Lord knoweth them that are his now just remembering now yeah I preached on verse 26 not long ago about the snares of the devil so this isn't that same type of context here uh Paul's dealing in his final letter he wrote before he was martyred he's helping uh young Pastor Timothy here understand the ways of the Lord hallelujah verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of God stand sure having this seal so God's seal has a two-fold seal a two-fold attribute to it God has when a person is sealed by the Holy Ghost they have these two attributes by God's grace the first is the Lord knoweth them that are his that's the first attribute the second is and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity we see in brother brandom's life we see it in Paul's life we see in Peter's life anyone who's born again will quickly leave iniquity by by God's grace how be thankful for that today Hallelujah I'm going to read verse 20 and then we'll all read 21 I'm going to read 20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth there's the four types of vessels it's also the four types of Believers we'd say or three Believers and four classes however you want to say that uh Jesus talked about those four grounds there they are found that years ago uh by God's grace and some to honor and some to dishonor so we know an honorable life will depart from iniquity sins you know are wrong if you are truly sealed by God you'll leave those sins amen hallelujah amen uh and then a child of God will be a a vessel of Honor by their Works they'll be an honor to God hallelujah we know that because that's what that's what a vessel is for a vessel is to do work a vessel has a purpose a vessel is to be filled how many had some uh coffee this morning that's a good vessel right that's I thank God for that vessel some of you might have had milk or whatever you had if you had a drink of water it's a vessel thank God there was a vessel there it was for God's honor Hallelujah so that's what God liens us unto or vessels of Honor now let's read verse 21 if again 1 2 3 if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work I don't know if my my wife remembers that but that was our verse when we got married we had a little verse there our prayer was that we would be Sanctified in meet for the Master's use little did we know we'd be just pastoring a few years after that we got married three years after we'd be pastoring I didn't know what I was getting into Hallelujah but God is good let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God father God we thank you for today Lord we read your word Lord now we just ask that the great holy spirit thank you God for leaving us the spirit Lord Lord Jesus you said it's better that you go away because the spirit would come and guide us into all truth Lord we recognize it's we're in a better condition Lord that the Holy Ghost is here hallelujah thank you Lord God let your spirit flow through US Lord may it anoint our thoughts Lord our words Lord Jesus May these scriptures bring life to the believer as your Prophet said there's nowhere uh there's no way else to be pepped up except by the preaching of the word the receiving of the word so Lord give us Grace today give us strength by the Holy Ghost Lord meet every need Lord God help us to be vessels of Honor Lord and depart from any work of iniquity father God surely we all want to say that I have the Seal of God on me the Lord knows me and I've departed from all iniquity so God how we want that how we desire that in our hearts and lives so bless this service today in the name of Jesus Christ and I ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you to being seated praise God hallelujah hallelujah so thank you again everybody for their patience on Wednesday you know we got here and I started cleaning up and then I realized oh there's no water the water froze up and uh thanks for dealing with that and being flexible and uh going to the the live stream there I trust that was a blessing by God's grace looking at marriage and divorce again as always if you have any questions about marriage and divorce or where I stand on certain things you're more than welcome to do that uh ask me uh February 9th remember we'll start back up two Services there we'll probably do a little B study on water baptism genev feeling Pole to be baptized uh by God's grace so she's asked about it for several months in a row so that will probably be one of our topics there and uh she just says I want to be saved Daddy I want to I W to I want to be baptized I said okay then you got to understand it now got to understand it so we're thankful for the grace of God hallelujah so let's look at this here the Lord knoweth them that are his as I said I was reading in uh um Jeremiah and a lot of these scriptures came out to me as quite uh wonderful and so I'm going to deal with that here today by the grace of the Lord hallelujah so we know the heart is uh deceitfully Wicked above all things that's what Jeremiah says as a sinner your heart is deceitfully wicked above all things I'm actually I don't have that one down let me look it up so if you would take your Bibles let's go to Jeremiah maybe it's 179 thank you sir thank you all right great job Casi beat me there wonderful job a see I was looking I typed in deceitfully it wasn't coming up so it doesn't have a l y on there uh the Bible says through the prophet the heart is deceitful above all things uh and desperately wicked who can know it now friends I wish this was O only true before we were Christians so what's this speaking of this is speaking of the human Spirit and the sin nature right if it's speaking of a heart we know it's not the physical heart it's the spiritual part of the person right because we're all physical and spiritual you and I see the physical inside is an invisible spiritual thing Hallelujah and so it's deceitfully wicked Above All Things who can know it remember Paul penned those beautiful words in 2 Corinthians I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 15 I Must Die daily Hallelujah so what do we got to die we have to uh daily die to the desperately wicked condition of our human Minds if we don't renew our minds every single day we will do some deceitfully Wicked and awful things you don't have to say Amen you could just say ouch right because we all I I'd say ouch too because there's things I do I know it doesn't please the Lord and I'm like where did that come from well I let myself get out of the spirit and brother R talked about it too remember his head spinning around with all the stress of being sued by the IRS and and then he lies to his wife and he's got to go back and make it right every believer knows about this right even Peter wouldn't eat with the the the Gentiles just discriminatory sin you know uh thinking he's better or something because of fear he's thinking he's better than the Gentiles and Paul's got to come up and correct him but here we see this truth that Jeremiah lays out so beautifully it's deceitfully wicked Above All Things so I'm going to say the the human mind the sinful human mind is deceitfully wicked Above All Things plus the sinful nature in our flesh the Bible says hallelujah Paul said there's no good thing that dwelleth in me not in my flesh and he's talking about not in this human spirit either remember he said I've got to serve God with my mind I've got to bring my mind into subjection to the word of God hallelujah so we're thankful for uh this scripture here in Jeremiah we see how it uh so easily applies to our lives and we must be careful to constantly look look at our hearts Hallelujah now I'd like to go to uh Ezekiel 36 let's go to Ezekiel 36 here's the Glorious three-step process of the three works of Grace I have loved this Revelation you know over the years I've had many people attack me and say there's no three works of Grace there's three there's not three works of Grace in The Bible and I just said well you just haven't read your Bible enough it's all throughout there praise God it's all I have a list I have a chart in my 2021 book there's about 10 or 11 uh scriptures with three stages to being baptized with the Holy Ghost it's all through the entire Bible but here it plainly sets it out in uh Ezekiel 3626 now the issue around the message is most people think they have the Holy Ghost in the soul when they don't Hallelujah that's the issue and that's where we got to because people can hang around for years I've seen they've hung around 40 years uh and be some of the biggest tithe payers be song leaders uh you know preachers and then they can turn on a drop of a hat right because it proves they were never born again again they didn't let Jesus all the way in because the heart is deceitfully wicked Above All Things Hallelujah the heart will deceive them their thinking will deceive them of course they let Satan anoint them to deceive them right but that's where we got to make sure that's why uh we always make our calling and election sure praise God Peter says that Peter of all people make your calling and election sure Hallelujah is that right so here we see the three stages of Grace a new heart also will I give you now notice where's the heart got to come from it's got to come from from God it's not in you to have a new heart God's got to give it to you and if God's got to give it to you that means you got to ask for it and you got to receive it because he's not going to force his way on anybody you got to say God my heart is deceitfully wicked my thoughts are deceitfully evil they're so wicked give me a new heart hallelujah it's got to come from God hallelujah so we know there's three stages but we also realize uh we need our minds refreshed every single day so this scripture can apply to every single day right so we get good lessons from that just like the statue per man yes yes you get capped off with Charity the baptism H Holy Ghost you get capped off but the rest of those you got to keep adding to it because it's in your human Spirit we got to because we all know there's times we haven't had enough brotherly kindness and yet we might say we're born again we all know there's been times we haven't been patient enough and yet we claim to be born again right Church Hallelujah so see it's it's just it's an understanding that God lays out these stages and for the soul the soul is one seal there's one seal to the Holy Ghost now there's two signs you got it right we just read that there's two signs you got the seal right as we saw in Timothy but then constantly the human Spirit has got to be built up and you must ask God for and you must let God give you it and then you must receive God's new spirit amen the new heart Hallelujah you must receive all those anointings and then if you do that then the Bible says an entrance will be made for you into heaven Hallelujah and if you do those things you'll never fail you'll never fail the Lord you'll never turn away you'll never go reprobated something like that if you do the word of God if you receive the new heart the new spirit then you'll be filled with God's spirit Hallelujah in your soul and it'll keep you it'll keep you in your difficult moments so there's a new heart now that's that's the stage of justification God declares you righteous you repented of all your sins Hallelujah and you're a new Christian right you got a new spirit but you still got to clean out that Spirit right you still got to clean out that house as brother Brian and the Lord led me to preach on by God's grace you still got to clean out that house well now Jesus is in there but now you got to let it get cleaned out and get all the trash out Hallelujah that's a process okay and then he gives you a new spirit okay and the new spirit of course is your habits your way of thinking brother Christian do you have a question brother yes yeah the major sins yes so you get saved you still have bad habits and then the new spirit is you get rid of all those bad habits and then the next verse can you go the next verse then he says then I'll give you and I'll put my spirit within you so that's in the soul yes and then you'll deal with small stuff throughout your whole life but it'll never turn into major big things yes good question give them two claps let's let's get back in that mode there now I'm just kidding go back there I'm sorry sister I'll put a new spirit now look God's Got You got to say God put a new way of thinking in my life first it's God give me a heart to know you give me a heart to love you you get that you get saved but then it's God give me a new spirit give me a new way of thinking give me a new atmosphere that I create around myself and others Hallelujah so before I got my haircut yesterday I did the same thing I prayed and I reached out my hand I said I'm going in there Lord help me to change the atmosphere and as soon as I got in there I said something about this and then I saw a a baby that was um three months premature is still alive and so I was in there in there I was saying praise the Lord Praise the Lord hallelujah God is so good to this the preey the prey still in the the uh the Intensive right but we're just and then pretty soon my barber starts praising God and then the barber that that owns it he says yes God is good see because I I don't want to brought I don't want to be brought under the atmosphere of that so I reach I know I've got a battle so I go in there with my sword drawn Hallelujah and the rest of the time no problem so I'm learning I'm learning to change the atmosphere praise God I just bowed my head and say God help me to change the atmosphere because I know they got you know they got music in there and all kinds of things um but that's where I see it l I've got to renew my spirit before I go in there right because I know here comes a battle here comes a joke here comes uh and help me Lord God help me to create an atmosphere help me to find a time I can mention the name of Jesus and it will change the atmosphere and people recognize God's presence hallelujah amen now look and then he says I will take away the Stony heart now Stony heart is like a rebellious Heart A Heart of Stone right a stone won't move it's supposed to not move it's supposed to have that attribute as a solid that uh it's hard hard to change the uh the shape right and that's how a sinner is it's hard to change their bad habits but God said I'll give you a heart of Flesh Hallelujah I'll give you a heart that's malleable that that's sensitive to the Holy Spirit and I'll give you a heart of Flesh so see most people with if they don't if they don't have a heart of Flesh they got a Stony heart they can't be moved by the Holy Spirit they can't be taught by the Holy Spirit they can't be corrected by the Holy Spirit but thank God if we got a heart of Flesh it can be moved upon it's living hallelujah it's a lie amen it's not a Heart of Stone hallelujah it's a heart of Flesh Hallelujah it can receive the word of God all right next verse he says and then uh I'm sorry verse 27 and I'll put my spirit within you so so a new heart is a little anointing of God's spirit a new spirit is more of God's spirit and then uh the the my spirit is a filling of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and cause you now here here's what I love it when you when you're baptized in the Holy Ghost it causes you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments so people that aren't born again they don't keep all the Commandments and the statutes like they ought to it's glaring obvious in their life they're not they're not lined up their life isn't lined up with living the word of God Amen right there are statutes they don't obey there's attributes up there we see on the statute perfect man they don't manifest it right but a a man or a woman who's got the spirit of God God's spirit just causes you it leads you it empowers you it it leads you into obeying these things Hallelujah that's right amen glory to God we see it plainly here in the scripture what an obvious thing it is here to cause you to walk in my statues now let's go to uh John 7 I'm thinking of brother Chris here I want to lay this in here um brother Chris has been reading the Bible I want to lay in some foundational things here now brother Chris I want you to see this here and the whole church especially the children too John 7:37 John 7:37 and I'm saying this um for Chris's sake but also our sake I over 10 years i' you know 18 years of preaching I've been in contact with so many emails so many comments so many phone calls this this week I talked to numerous preachers you know on the phone and one of the biggest problems people have is with the three parts of man and we have three parts we have a body we have a spirit and then we have a soul and so many problems happen people wonder how does this happen it's because God hasn't got down into the soul in other words the people haven't uh fulfilled my spirit like eel 36:27 says they might have a new heart they might have a new spirit but they haven't got God's spirit yet so they backslide and then their their new spirit gets corrupted they get living in sin addictions uh they just get they just get sinful by God's grace but this is so important so brother Chris in the Old Testament they could get the Holy Ghost on their flesh they could get it in their mind but they could never get it in their soul because their sins had never been abolished by the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of animals and bulls and goats could only cover over their sin right like this would this would cover over uh the pen right this would cover over but the Pen's still there but now when the blood of Jesus comes it's all gone Hallelujah and that's what we live under praise God hallelujah so now that now that the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away all the sin now God can get down deep into our soul into the third part of our being flesh Spirit Soul all right and here here's where Jesus says it Jesus says it plainly in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink notice he cried out he wasn't Whispering on this one if anybody's thirsty come and drink of Me no he cried out if anybody thirst for the spirit of God let him come unto me hallelujah it's a desperate thing hallelujah it's a serious thing most people don't get born again Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road Hallelujah that's right verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall shall flow rivers of Living Water Well then people say they're born again and they can't praise God and they can't testify they can't memorize the Bible they they they can't nothing flows out of their mouth except complaints right or or uh uh depression or something like that or criticism or something like that if you got the Holy Ghost Jesus said it'll flow outside of you Hallelujah people will see it amen right glory to God I love that amen church we all go through trials but you understand what I'm saying the spirit of God stirs up in you and it flows out like a river Hallelujah that's right verse 39 but this spake he of the spirit see he was speaking of the Holy Spirit which they that believe on him should receive in the future remember they received it in Acts chapter 2 after Jesus died resurrected and then ascended to Heaven that's right yes sir 10 days yes good brother good see he's got that Bible knowledge that's I was telling you brother Chris I was saying brother Chris you're getting that Bible knowledge right there by God's grace see and then what's next brother Chris Temperance right that's for you Hallelujah Temperance is self-control over all the bodily passions and desires of your flesh so the flesh wants to do that the flesh is craving but you got but they're forbidden Cravings Cravings our B's desire but we got to crucify that and we got to get the anointing of the Holy Ghost for self-control Hallelujah so brother that that is your pathway to the baptism of the Holy Ghost right there that's why I hung it up there by God's grace I love that he says uh for the Holy Ghost was not yet given yet I could take you to many scriptures and say how the the Holy Ghost fell on Saul the Holy Ghost fell on David the Holy Ghost fell on bezel Moses Daniel Daniel was filled with the Holy Ghost Joshua and Caleb had a different Spirit it was the Holy Ghost so what does this mean it just means they couldn't receive it in the soul yet Hallelujah because they the the the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed yet and the blood of Jesus Christ abolishes and sends away and remits uh uh all sin away and Jesus blood was the payment for the ransom right when when we when we sin the Bible said the wages of sin is death when we sin uh all those sins are recorded and someone's someone's got to pay for those sins thank God we didn't have to pay for when Jesus came and shed his blood he paid the punishment for all that sin Hallelujah he paid our Ransom and now we're free Hallelujah I don't know if you saw that this week but numerous times I've been brought to tears Donald Trump I know he's might not be safe but he signed one think about this he signed one uh executive order and it set free 1,000 500 prisoners that were wrongly in there including a 75y old grandmother who was just praying outside of abortion clinic and was in jail as a hostage to that last regime and I watched video after video probably five or six videos of grown men women crying say my life was taken from me but now I've been pardoned and I couldn't help but think of brother man preaching the sermon pardoned amen and if a natural pardon will produce that in someone's life what will it produce in the spiritual life Hallelujah when you've been forgiven of your natural sins some of us probably should be in jail for some of the things we've done our natural sins but not only we' forgiven that but we've forgiven all of our spiritual sins all of it's been washed away we've come to the fountain filled with blood and we've washed our robes white in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah it'll make a grown man cry it'll make a grown woman cry because they received The Parting love of Jesus Christ blood oh my I wanted to uh make a video maybe I'll share it Wednesday I want to make a video just all of them so you can see right in a row uh it's so heart it's so heartwarming to see the mothers some of these mothers were just uh praying outside of abortion clinic and now they're reunited with their little babies and they're just crying saying oh boo boo or whatever your name is you know goooo boo boo and they couldn't have their babies for all these years because they were unlawfully persecuted but a pardon he said I'm free I just listen this morning she said I'm free I'm Free Church you're free from sin hallelujah amen you're paren by the blood of Jesus Christ his name's way more powerful than any president Hallelujah glory to God it's a name above all names the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we can see it there it's t here plainly so hope hope you got that I I want all the children to get that too you got to get and our teens here too you got to get a new heart a new spirit and then God's spirit Hallelujah all right now let's uh move here I want to look at this here let's go to acts 1614 it kind of deals with the new heart this is about Lydia I always remember Lydia of course my first born acts 16:14 I just love how it says this about uh Lydia here now in this case it looks like it's taken from God's perspective right and a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyra which worshiped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto The Words which were spoken of Paul so before this she was just down at the I think they were having prayer down at the river if I'm not mistaken uh she just having prayer and she had a a Stony heart she wasn't saved right maybe she maybe she's a Jew something like that but she was praying she was trying to find God and God sends the prophet and the prophet tells her about Jesus Christ just like brother Ram did for us amen hallelujah and then the Bible said God opened our heart God came down and opened the door of her heart and God gave her a new heart but see God couldn't do that God couldn't force himself upon her so obviously while she was praying she says God she's probably saying God give me more revelation God I want to know you God I see the favors of my life I want a new heart and see when we when we ask God to give us a new heart God will be faithful God will give us a new heart amen H so see that's what if you want to be saved if you want to make sure you're saved make sure you open your your heart to God say God open open my heart and put your heart in there the desires of your heart and then you'll stop chasing the desires of the world right you won't care about the world so much anymore you got to pay your bills but you won't care about that because now you have a new heart you have a heart of Flesh not a Heart of Stone Hallelujah that's right see we got to understand this God said I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I'll give you my spirit and then God will open your heart but we really realize God can't force himself so you've got to open your heart how many believe that by God's grace Glory now I want to um look at this here verse I want to go to let's go to Psalm 374 I've used this before it's been a while Psalm 374 what a beautiful scripture this is hallelujah it says Delight thyself also in the Lord in other words make the most delightful part of your life God Amen I hope you look forward to Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights if you don't you got the wrong Delights that's the truth didn't David say David said I set my affection on the house of God hallelujah and what was he a man after whose heart God's heart so you see can you put those scriptures together if you have a heart for God you want to be in God's house amen if you're after God heart you want to go to God's house Hallelujah that's right amen that's why Jesus we saw in Luke 4:16 Jesus always had the custom to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath to go to church when the church doors were open but people make excuses skip church all these kind of things why because they got different Delights they're delighting in different things but we want our Delight to be in Jesus Christ that's right amen delight yourself also in the Lord now what does he do so if you make God your Delight that's your reaction he's going to react back right there's always an opposite equal reaction the laws of uh what's it called the laws of physics right if you make God if you say God open my heart and then God will then give you the desires of your heart Hallelujah now this verse is also used to to show that God will give every person their heart's desire whether good or bad right God will give you a heart's desire because God's not going to force things upon you right he's going to give you what you want uh the Bible said in Romans 1 because they did not like to pertain God's knowledge in their mind God gave them over to a reprobate mind Hallelujah so God will just give you over if you won't humble yourself if you won't uh believe God's word if you won't keep God's word in your mind God will just say okay I'm done we went through we went through it on the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost and he'll just give you over to a reprobate mind okay and then you still get what you want right bam still got what he want Judas still got what he wanted that's what they want they don't want to be with God eternally they don't want to obey God's word they don't want to love Jesus they get what they want Hallelujah all right Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desire of thy heart so you want to ask God for the desires of from your new heart not your old deceitful heart that's where people get mixed up right like one time there's an individual that said oh God hasn't given me a marriage spouse so I'm I I hate God that was such an awful thing to say now that person is now married but that's what they told me I said you need to repent of that they repented of that and I don't know if it's sincere but that's an example like you got to wait on God right you got to trust God you got to be you got to you just got to know that God is writing my story God's in control Hallelujah if I try to figure it out I know I'm gonna fail having having people learn enough if you try to bring it to pass if you try to figure it out you're going to fail Hallelujah so true now brother Ram say he uses this verse uh regarding balum he said uh now balam was not a true word Prophet because remember he taught false Doctrine brother said what was the difference between Moses and balum the difference was Moses had perfect teaching perfect and what did balam do he taught them to commit fornication 24,000 died but did both have right prophecy yes they were both both prophets they both said thus say the Lord and it came to pass but what did God tell Moses he said find out what they say after they do that after they prophecy prophesy correctly watch where they Lead You amen a true child of God will only lead you to the word of God hallelujah deeper in the word not to compromise and lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life a true servant of God will always point you to Jesus Christ so he was not a true word Prophet for God told him not to go honor BAC with his presence but he sought to go anyway for he was motivated for his Lust For Gold and prge his heart's desire so God let him go the perfect will of God gave way to the permissive will of God because of the heart desire of balam God actually said go ahead after God had already given his perfect will so Bal could have left there and said I've got thus sayith the Lord God said I could go down but what he didn't tell you was that God first said don't go down so see people people might like like like the pastor of brown Tabernacle God might have told him that it's his will to play tapes but there's no way that could be the first will of God because that's not what the Bible teaches Hallelujah I don't doubt that one bit but it can't be the original plan of God because God's original plan is not to press play and Obey Hallelujah God's original plan is to hear the preaching of God's word faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God and Obey that and then God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey the word of God hallelujah that's right he says it was balam who was the loser see brother man said God had his way regardless listen church if we take the permissive will of God we're going to lose a lot who's the loser in the situation balum did he get more money yes did he get more popularity yes but what did he eventually lose he lost his soul so the person who chooses the permissive will of God ultimately is going to lose out but if you go with Jesus obey the word of God you're always going to win hallelujah amen praise God you might be martyred like Paul you might be Shipwrecked like Paul you might go through some awful trials but God will be with you he'll never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah it was balam who was the loser for he bypassed the word of God and today we have that very same thing oh do we brother Brandon yes we do women preachers organization false Doctrine Etc and people worshiping God manifesting in the spirit and going right on as bam did cling that God was spoken to them even when the commission received is opposite of the revealed word that's just like brandom Tabernacle it's they're doing opposite of what the revealed word in Hebrews 10:24 and 25 says hallelujah but let's not just look at them let's look at our lives are we obeying the revealed word that's what we got to look at today let's not it's always so easy I can point to them Point let's look at ourselves we're going to get there here by God's grace that's that's where I'm going of course you know prob know where I'm going brother said I will not deny that God spake to them but it was just like when he spake to ba that second time and he knew that God wanted I'm sorry he knew that balam wanted his own heart's desire above the word and God gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way see balum got his own way he got what he wanted he got money he got Prestige he got the ability to teach when he wasn't called to teach he was just called to prophesy right he wanted a bigger platform oh don't we all talk about that everybody on social media wants a bigger platform you better be careful so to BM you want a bigger platform do it the right way that's what we're doing buddy right do it the right way Hallelujah do it the right let God grow let let God and if God doesn't grow it praise God anyway Hallelujah then I'm more like Jesus and Paul I'm more rejected at the end of my life than I was at the beginning Hallelujah that's right church amen he knew that balam wanteded his own heart's desire see his heart was deceitfully wicked above all things above the word and God gave it to them so even today God tells folks to go ahead in their own Hearts desires for they have already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless other words God knows all these people are going to make these selfish decisions go ahead God's will will still be done you can't stop God hallelujah you can run from people you can run from problems but you cannot run from God if you're a child of God God will come running after you amen he'll spank you and bring you right back to the fold Hallelujah that's right that's right just like the prodigal he'll let you run he'll go but he'll he'll still have Grace in the midst of that he'll give you a new heart amen a new mind amen that's what he got he got a new mind why am I living like this why I I could be better off as a servant my father's house God is merciful even in your deepest darkest places God will send a new heart a new spirit and then he'll give you his Spirit Hallelujah God knows how to do it Glory now let's look at a few more scriptures here by the grace of the Lord I got uh lots of lots of scripture let's go to Psalm 51:10 this is of course after David committed murder and adultery think of that murder and adultery what's his prayer Psalm 51:10 now remember church he just committed murder adultery he hid it for a long time he HIIT it right he thought he could hide it but Church you can't hide your sins somebody's going to eventually come tell you your sins is that right Nathan comes and says you are the man right you can't hide from God God's going to come correct you is that right church and that's what we want if we've sinned against our father we want our father to show us we're wrong amen right what does he say he's murdered he sins he I'm sorry he's murdered he's committed adultery he's hid it from everybody he thought could have a secret sin and then he's exposed and then he falls on his face and he says create in me a clean heart who's got it can you create your clean heart no can I create my clean heart no you have to let God create a clean heart say God come into my heart come into my thinking and give me give me the right thoughts forgive me of all my evil thoughts all my words in this case forgive me a murder forgive me adultery and create something clean in me everybody say uh everybody say uh uh a right Spirit ready right Spirit right Spirit created me a right spirit in other words I know my spirit was wrong but I want it to be right and I can't do it I need God and then remember this is after he's saved this is after he's got the Holy Ghost in his Spirit right he needs a fresh anointing he needs a uh A Renewed mind he needs a transformed mind he's already been anointed he's already slain Goliath he's already expanded the kingdom and fulfilled the whole Kingdom of Israel and he's saying God come into my heart come into my mind come into my spirit and create a clean heart and renew bring back the spirit I used to have remember the Bible said he despised the Commandment of God now some of us we wouldn't say we despise God's word but we would despise God's children sometimes right some of us now some of us might look at the word and we might despise that I can't believe the Bible says that I don't want to do that but it could go either either way or could be your enemy you could despise your enemy despise your boss but see When sin happens it's because we purposely despise the word of God and all it takes is a a humble repentance say God forgive me I'm I've sinned I've sinned against you it's my fault I let my spirit get dirty so created me a clean heart and this is the same word creation from Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth Hallelujah and what did he do he took his Spirit his Spirit started covering over the Earth right and started bringing up the plans when God called for that's what you say when you say God created me a clean heart say God let your anointing come on me let me feel you let me raise my hands and worship let me praise and create something brand new in my heart hallelujah what I used to have but I don't have anymore because I never would have done those sinful things if I would have had a right a clean heart Hallelujah same Hebrew word for Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created what a blessing to know this is a man after what a big paycheck this is a man after a worldwide Fame this is a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah and he knows I've got to set my affection on of the house of God let's pull that up there I think it's 2 Samuel I think it's set an affection 2 Chronicles 29 yes 2 Chronicles 293 I want you to see this how closely related they are you can't say you love God with all your heart soul and mind and not love the house of God it's impossible impossible 2 Chronicles 29:3 moreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God see mine it's personal it's my God's house now somebody else's God that's my God that's his house so it means it's mine too Hallelujah Glory he says uh the house of my God the gold for the things I'm sorry that's verse two I'm go down to verse three moreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I've given to the house of my God over and above all that I prepared for the Holy House Hallelujah now pull up Colossians I believe it's Colossians 3:5 set your affection on things above so we got two things to set our affection on and I believe by God's grace if our affections are set on heaven then we'll set our affection on the house of God because judgment begins at the house of God this is where God is going to start deciding listen God's going to come down the roads and say who is the wise virgin who's the foolish virgin he's starting right here hallelujah who's the borderline believer who's the make believer who's the unbeliever he's starting right here in the house of God hallelujah Colossians 3 verse two set your affection on things things above not on things of the earth so we got to we got to learn to love the Heavenly things the Heavenly Promises of God we got to set our affection on Heavenly rewards by God's grace verse four for when Christ who is our life what life do you got I have no other life except the life of Jesus Christ and I only have that life if I let him live through me that's right shall appear who shall I'm sorry then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortified now that means crucified so if you want to set your affection on things above you have to crucify The Temptations of the world mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication sexual temptation to com commit sexual sin before you're married you've got to crucify that think about that you've got to nail that to the Cross you got to nail that desire and say you're gonna die I'm gonna live that that's how you set your affection on I in other words I'm going to flee evil and I'm going to obey righteousness Hallelujah uncleanness again that's kind of related there uh I think that's uh Financial living like living it up with wealth inordinate affection that might be homosexuality evil concience and covetousness which is idolatry so coveting after anything is the same as idolatry all right so now you can see that setting our affections we want to set our affections on things of God that is having a heart after the heart of God glory now we see how David did it now brother says this brother man's giving a uh's giving a a prayer call and the eagle stir her nest 1957 he says if you just preach for what money you get out of it shame on you Pastor shame on you I pastored a lot where I didn't take a lot of money right and brother Cam's never taken a penny so that's why I know God will bless and honor him because of my my family size I've got to use some of the ties by God's grace I know uh Paul said that that's what the Bible said they that preach the gospel should live of the Gospel that's the way it's ordained Hallelujah and you just to be popular or just to go to the conventions so see some people are so drawn to Christian conventions brother says and enjoy the blessings and have Fellowship is that all you're a Christian for so one he one he uses money and the other he says big Christian conventions is that all you're a Christian for he says shame on you you're not willing to die to yourself and sacrifice everything you are brother for the cause of Christ then shame on you and raise your hand and say God create within me a clean heart so how does a person get a a clean heart they have to acknowledge to God lord I haven't surrendered everything to you I've got sins in my life that I haven't cleaned out and create in me a clean heart that I can know Christ all right everybody see that God created me a clean heart die to yourself sacrifice everything you are he says will you raise your hand and say God be merciful to me Christ many's put up their hands and we're going to have a word of prayer just in a few minutes Hallelujah all right so we can see that God must create in us a clean heart we must let God do it we must crucify mortify the Deeds of our flesh and the evil thoughts of our mind and then God will give us his thoughts his Spirit uh his heart Glory now I'm going to jump ahead now let let's look I'm going to start going a different um different or yeah let me start getting ready to come down this direction let's go to Jeremiah 22 verse 13 please Jeremiah 223 here's the verses I read over the last few weeks and they just kind of uh stirred up my heart about the heart the Lord knoweth them that are his Jeremiah 22:13 woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his Chambers by wrong that you uses his neighbor service without wages so see if your neighbor helps you out you better pay him and the church said right and giveth him not for his work so the neighbors work for you but Bible said all of us are neighbors right everybody's your neighbor that saith I will build me a wide house and large Chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is sealed with cedar and painted with Vermilion so look all these outstanding decorations and not even paying the people that are helping him shalt thou Reign because thou closest thyself in Cedar in other words because you have a a beautiful home is that going to make you reain is that going to make you give you any Authority with God the answer is no did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and Justice and then it was well with him so Jeremiah is showing difference between I think it was Josiah and his son if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that if you go back early in the chapter so the the or the the good King he did judgment Injustice and then his son was after just outward lavish living uh fancy homes fancy cars we'll say like that big bank accounts uh what do they call it bling what do they call it just after all kinds of fantastic natural things and looking handsome or pretty but God said verse 26 he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me sayeth the Lord did everybody catch that wasn't this to know me so who wants to know God today here Jeremiah gives this just struck me like wow we can know God by not focusing on the outward Financial blessings of life but focusing on the poor and the needy you can learn to know God by helping others instead of helping yourself Hallelujah I thought my that was beautiful Jeremiah says by the Holy Ghost wasn't this to know me so taking all your time to build up your home or your your future all these things or doing judgment and Justice caring about the needs and Justice and the lives of others he said if you do that if you look to the needs of others he said then you'll know me this is this was given to you so you would know me Hallelujah so what does that teach us we see God's character and those that are hurting we see God's character in the sick and the poor and the needy that's where we can find God's character I'm not talking about people that uh rig the system I'm not talking about those people we all know we all heard of people like that they rig the system they could work but they're just getting unemployment for something like that so sad but there's genuinely people out there that are needy and and that are poor and the Bible says when we minister to them then we actually learn to know God Allelujah it's just not one place in the Bible as you're probably familiar with verse 17 but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness so see it just shows this King's son he was just all about himself what can I get in life what can I do what can I do for me and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it so Not only was he thinking about himself building up his own house he was killing his denters he was killing anyone that would uh go against him verse 20 I'm sorry verse 18 therefore thus sayi the Lord concerning jeim the son of yep Josiah was Josiah the king of Judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah my sister they shall not lament for him saying ah Lord or ah his glory verse 19 he should be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the Gates of Jerusalem What a Sad ending to the son of a king a lot of people walk around this message saying I'm a son of the King right I'm a son of the king your life declares whose son you are or daughter is that right but here he says how can you know me he said you can know me by helping the poor and the needy and judging things with just Justice and judgment not taking sides because oh I like this brother I like this sister or I don't like this brother I don't like this sister I'll take sides with somebody else being neutral and just standing with God hallelujah I'm not gonna stand with you I'm not gonna stand with you I'm gonna stand with God's word hallelujah see that's the people that get to know God's character all right now Jeremiah 24:4 these were good I hope you like those by God's grace it's really refreshing like wow that jeim had a chance to know God if he would have just turned away from this covetousness and just looked at the humble needs of people people asking him for help he could have known God verse four again the word Lord came unto me saying thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel like these good figs so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive so he God gave him a vision of two baskets some had good figs some had bad figs whom I sent out of this place in the land of calans for their good verse six for I will set mine Eyes Upon them for good and I'll bring them again to this land and I'll build them and not pull them down right that happened with zerubabel right Ezra Nehemiah Hallelujah and I'll plant them and not pluck them up now look at verse seven here's what I want to get to and I will give them in heart to know me that I am the Lord Glory see if we want to know God we have to let God give us his heart amen right he said I he said here here's ways you can know my heart serving the needy finding a way to serve the poor to judge things the right way this is a way to know me he said but I'm also I'll give you a heart to know me I will give it to you I'll give you a new heart because people want to stay with their deceitfully wicked Hearts they'd rather have like brother man said they love their sin they love uh whatever sin Pride or lust or whatever it is they love that more than they love the truth of God's word but thankfully God says I'll give you a heart to know me that I am the Lord and they shall be my people hallelujah and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heart Hallelujah I just want you to these these scriptures are so beautiful to me God set up a way you can know his heart yes set your affection on the house of God help the poor help the needy do justice when there's a problem do the right thing don't take sides Hallelujah and then God Saidi give you a heart to know me if you'll receive it hallelujah what a beautiful promise uh Zechariah 78 Zechariah 78 and the word Lord came unto Zechariah saying verse 9 thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother verse 10 and oppress not the Widow nor the fatherless The Stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart Hallelujah my look at that this is the way to know God we would all I would say who who wants to know God here I hope all the hands would go up this is the way to know God when you see a widow help out a widow if they're a widow indeed right we'll get to that in Thessalonians see someone fatherless or motherless help them out see the stranger help them out help out the poor and don't take evil imaginations in your heart have a Pure Heart pure thoughts toward your sister pure hearts toward your brother verse 11 but they refused to hearken now what happened now watch they pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should hear right they pulled away their shoulder in other words they're not going to listen anymore see verse 12 what they do they made their own Hearts as an admitted stone that could be a Flint stone which is a hard Stone remember Jesus had a face like a flint it also can mean Diamond they Harden in other words they Harden their heart extremely hard against obeying the word of God lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts has sent in his Spirit by the former prophets see they won't listen to what brother Ram said about cutting hair or crossdressing or water baptism or the godhead they won't hear brother brother Rams preaching Bible preaching about that Bible they won't hear that and many times their hearts just become stoned therefore came a great wrath from The Lord of hosts therefore verse 13 it should come to pass that as he cried they would not hear so God would refuse to hear their cries so they cried and I would not hear say the Lord of hosts but I scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant land desolate all right so God you know God through judging things the right way justice among the poor and the needy remember Jesus said in Matthew 25 when you've done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me Hallelujah so we can see it plainly here when we see people through difficult times that's when we've really got to uh open up our hearts we got to go out our way to help somebody by God's grace Hallelujah if you want the heart of God I know you want the heart of God you wouldn't be here if you're done with the heart of God look at Jeremiah 17:10 I'm almost get ready to get to the main po part here Jeremiah 17:10 there's a part in my book uh in the 2021 book where I I call it soul searching remember uh well Jeremiah 17:10 I the Lord search the heart I try the rain even to give every man according to his own ways now see see there it is God's going to give you what you want God went down into balam's heart and had a conversation and baam's like well I'd really like to go to I really like to go to Bao and make this money and God said okay you can do it but God found that sin in his heart God dealt with him and showed him and searched his heart and said this is not right you need to stay I'm giving you thus sayith the Lord but he wanted his own way so God said okay that's as far as God that's as far as he let God search into his heart and life then God left him right let him do what he wanted to do see God's going to give you whatever according to your own ways according to the fruit of his doings then God's going to let all the repercussions come upon you for the actions you chose right uh now for us Revelation 223 Revelation 223 I am he which searches the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works remember your Works come from your faith faith comes from your love so if you got perverted love then you won't have the right faith and you do the corrupt fruits corrupt Works Hallelujah so we see that God wants to I love that God wants to walk and many times it happens while we're laying in our beds at night Psalm 4:4 stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still maybe it's your couch but when you're alone at night or you're alone before you go to bed that's when many times God will come down he'll start dealing with you about your life and he does it out of love he wants your night to end well and he wants you to have a good day tomorrow he wants you to obey him he wants you to be a child after the heart of God and so the Bible said he'll walk through with your hearts He he'll open this door that door and he'll just go through all the areas of your life Lord do my is my life lining up with your word right he's the Lord that tries everyone's heart while we're getting ready to rest or maybe got that quiet time in the morning and after a good rest or a hard rest a bad rest No Rest he'll commune with you in your own heart while you're on your bed while you're just sit on your your your your seat see you commune with you talk with him so God came down to baalam and talked with him but baam said no I want the money I want this and God had to leave him but look God came to David and said you've got murder and sin and God said created me a or David said created me a clean heart then take this murderous uh spirit take this adulterous Spirit out of my heart take this attitude that hates the word of God take this out of my heart and create in me a clean heart amen hallelujah and then what God's spirit came back on David Hallelujah because he opened up his heart he he let God commune with him in every door of his heart in every area of his life oh it's beautiful Psalm 77:6 says I call to remembrance my song in the night I commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search so see God will come down and he'll you you'll have to spend a few minutes really thinking about your actions and say Lord did I do anything wrong Lord show me if I've done wrong I'll make it right if something's wrong in your life so Jesus Remember the said he stands at everyone's door and knocks so every night when getting ready for bed he comes around and said can I communion with you tonight I like to walk down with the with you into the the deeper parts of your heart and life is everything right in your heart and life is everything lined up to the word of God I'd like to have some communion with you will you open up tonight and how many people just roll over or go to bed or whatever they do or just turn on a video instead of communing with the King of Kings and Lord of lords the god of heaven and earth oh what a what a striking thing what a what a privilege though that he'll come to every heart praise God what an amazing expression of his love that he'll come to your heart he'll come to my heart praise God because he's faithful so notice if you have a pure heart you have pure Works James 1:27 this is just one of always been an ultimate not ultimate but just amazing scripture me pure religion and undefiled before God and our father's is so religion is just acts right so pure works is to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world live nothing like the world right keep all the sin off me I want to be pure I want to be loving I want to be kind I want to be gracious I want to help those who are hurting like Kyla right that's a great testimony want to help go pray for people that's what we should do that should be our heart's desire our heart should be the heart of Christ and as we battle against the deceitfulness and wickedness of our human mind we've got to constantly mortify that cast that down and say Lord create in me a clean heart and then if you got a pure heart this is the kind of life that you want to live Hallelujah so if you want pure works you need a pure heart Hallelujah now so Church I just I'll just kind of summarize it like this we have to constantly daily search our hearts and lives now God wants to do it usually before we go to bed right on your bed could be in the morning too when you're alone you got this quietness of the day the quietness of the night that's when God wants to come down and commune with you and there's going to be times like David there's going to be times after You' made awful mistakes but yet God will still come and commune with you and you all you have to do is say Lord forgive me again I acknowledge my sin David said David said I acknowledge my sin I Repent of it and create in me a clean heart give me a clean heart because I can't create a clean heart myself I can't do it I don't have it within me I need the Holy Spirit to uh anoint me overshadow me like the Earth was overshadowed and all the darkness was vanished and light came in hallelujah praise God the spirit moved above above the the darkness of the earth Lord take the darkness out of my life and let the light of Christ shine into my mind Hallelujah so we're either like that or like Psalm 139 says it's the last two verses I I didn't get a chance to write down Psalm 139 can you pull it up there on the last two verses so you're either in you know sometimes church we make mistakes and God's saying uh you know confess this you got a dirty heart or if you're living right with God then you have verse 23 and 24 when you hear sermons like this you won't just say oh that was for brother so and so that's for sister and so and so you know you'll say no let me see if that's for me because David said now this is David after he's forgiven right 139 he said search me oh God in other words god let's let's talk about my life is my life really pointing people to Jesus Christ do I really have a Christian testimony that's what David's saying search me oh God do I have all these attributes like I should have because that's the life that overcomes the statue of perfect man search me God in other words Lord I am going to take a few moments I'm gonna stay a few minutes after service or I'm gonna come to service a few minutes early or I'm gonna stay up just a few extra minutes and Lord let me just go through my life and Lord make sure everything that in my life is pleasing to you walk with me through my words did I say the right thing did I do the right thing search me oh God in other words I want I'm inviting you in I'm inviting you in to investigate into my life what's pleasing what what may not be pleasing and I'm letting you show me so I can get rid of it search me oh God and know my heart and know my thoughts see we we think we can hide our thoughts from God we can't hide our thoughts from God he sees everything we're thinking so we got to let God and say God you know those thoughts I thought you know those words I said you know you know what my heart feels forgive me of that search me now if you're clean praise God lord if there's anything I did wrong Lord search me and he says and see if there be any wicked now David knew there was wicked in him that's why he confessed his sins right that's why he said God created me clean AR but here here he's he's at a spot where he's actually living true to God he's faithful to God and said see if there's any evil thing in there and then lead me in the right way lead me in the way of everlasting lead me in the way of eternal life hallelujah what would eternal life do it would set its affection on the things of God hallelujah so see we got two different applications where if we're in sin we must confess it and invite him in and say God created me a CL a clean heart but if you're not in sin then you can say Lord just search me over investigate all my motives and objectives and create in me a clean heart because I don't want to sin against you Hallelujah beautiful scriptures see if there's any wicked way me case you prepare that song search me oh God I'm almost done uh Matthew 7 21 it's not even noon I usually go to noon all right glory to God at 7:21 so this scripture is going to tie in with our text our text was 2 Timothy 2 192021 this be a good one for brother Chris here uh as he's freshly looking at the scriptures Again by God's grace Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith un to me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven now when I first read this brother Chris I about fell out of my chair I was in my dorm room in akan uh Brown Street it's not even there anymore they they tore it down I was there and I was like oh my goodness what how how is this even possible they're saying Lord Lord but then there's another verse where Jesus says U you you say Lord Lord but you don't do the things that I say so we get two witnesses of it at least people can and then oh third one Matthew 15 Jesus said they draw nigh with me or to me with their lips but their heart is far from me there it is amen hallelujah that's there it is yes brother yes yes or even selling them out like Judas Judas wasn't going to bars Judas he was just had he just had a thief's heart he just took some of the money from the bag but he wasn't out with harlots he wasn't out adultery he just had those those small little Sins Not small big sins in this case yeah very good brother see in other words people can say the right thing but their their heart they still have a a dirty heart they've lost the clean heart so not everyone that says Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will so we have to do the will of God if we want to go to heaven praise God hallelujah now this this is not teaching Works salvation but it's teaching if you have a clean heart it will produce works of gratitude Hallelujah in other words I'm not saved by my works but I do works out of my gratitude for being saved Hallelujah I'm so happy he's forgiven me Lord what do you want me to do I'm right here praise God fill my hands fill my mouth lead my feet you know uh just give me what to say I I'll do whatever you want I'm your servant Hallelujah I'm Your Vessel to honor Hallelujah see not everyone that says Lord Lord will go enter the kingdom of heaven but only those who do the will of My Father which is in heaven Hallelujah now verse 22 many will say not a few look at that brother Chris many remember at the at the last judgment there's going to be uh everyone's going to stand before God every person down through all history Julius Caesar Donald Trump Joe Biden Adolf Hitler you name it St Paul we're all going to be there and many of them are going to try to say many people rise up and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name like that's balum balum prophesied in his name and in thy name cast out Devils that's Judas Judas cast out Devils he had all that power and in my name done many wonderful works right next verse and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now leave that up there I've just gone over all these verses about how you can know God but here God said I never knew you they thought they knew God but they didn't know God and then God is here saying I never knew you so the the truth of God's word is that we've got to know God and God has to know us hallelujah amen just like my wife she's my wife I know her she knows me because we live together we're we're on holy wedlock or I'm sorry Holy Communion is it holy wedlock yeah for uh 21 years yes Glory didn't forget the number of years but I know her in the only way I know any woman my wife Hallelujah and that's what Jesus saying here he said you've got to know me and I've got to know you I just show you how you can know God do justice help the poor help the needy keep all the sin off you if you do that you'll know God Amen Hallelujah but now God's saying I don't know you and why not because they were workers of iniquity iniquity is lawlessness in other words it's it's purposefully breaking the commands of God brother Braham says you you uh uh brother Braham says uh you're you're doing what you know you shouldn't do I'm kind of paraphrasing that I can't get the right quote right now I've not been studying on that that topic lately so in other words these worker iniquity so brother what what would happen they would do Miracles but they would also do iniquity when they weren't doing the Miracles and all the all these Mega preachers do it today oh they might have good Miracles but watch what they do afterwards Watch what it comes comes in their their personal life uh drugs uh prostitutes all these things money riches all these and they might have real testimonies but Jesus will say I never knew you Hallelujah now what does the Bible say the Seal of God we started with it the Seal of God is the Lord knows them that are his hallelujah amen and see this is what God Jesus is going to say at at the this is the final judgment I never knew you Hallelujah now look at that and this is what we preached on a few weeks remember I went through some of the things that people will say on the day of judgment this is one I forgot people are going to stand there and say Lord uh I did this I did that how could you not know me how could you uh uh say depart I did this I did that and Jesus is going to tell them you did works of iniquity you didn't do the right works well we' seen this morning the right works are Justice judgment helping the poor keeping yourself unspotted from the world we have the privilege to know but they knew too so we better do what God called us to do hallelujah amen glory oh my so we know God fully by doing his works not works of iniquity but his works and that's because we yield to his spirit and let his Spirit work through us alah now this no this word no I never knew you this word is used 208 times in the New Testament it's just simple knowledge now it can mean the marriage relationship it can mean that but most of the time it doesn't so you could use that in other words uh I never knew you in other words uh you never had an intimate relationship with me I was never your husband you were always chasing after others other uh other lovers that's what the Bible said brother Chris the Bible said in the end days the people be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God second Timothy chapter 3 so that's why we got to make sure we got to make sure we chase the pleasures of God and not the pleasures of the world Hallelujah that's right this can also mean to the Jew and the and the Lexicon it says to the Jew true knowledge or I never knew you true knowing is always manifesting itself in one's conduct which I believe works well with this one because your conducts are your Works they're either works of obedience or works of iniquity in the Jewish life one did not know something until the fact had a practical outworking in his life in other words like today these young people if you ask them what's hard work they they'll tell you but a lot of them don't even know what they're talking about like I've seen on on the news uh this what's the next what's this current generation is it gen Z what is it gen Alpha okay I didn't know that that's good but they in the last few years they just got on the workforce and they're like I got to work 40 hours a week I'm done I'm like bunch of poor babies can I get you a bottle right try working 60 hours I working 70 hours Cam and Simon have worked 80 hours when they got emergencies and pipes reading cam just worked 14 hours on Friday you and I were texting back a pipe burst and so see in other words they never knew they don't really know they can tell you what hard work is but they don't they haven't experienced it amen and Jesus said I never had an experience with you oh thank God if we've had an experience with the Holy Ghost today Hallelujah Jesus won't say I never knew you Jesus said I knew you Hallelujah you're mine you're my you're my you're my child you're my bride Hallelujah and your Works follow your confession Hallelujah Glory you won't do the works of iniquity you do the works of righteousness that's right Church now I got some good verses here the Bible said in uh Genesis 18- 19 the Bible said I'll visit Abraham because I know him and he will keep his Commandments and he'll command his children to do works of righteousness God said I know Abraham Hallelujah so see God has to know us the Lord knows that how do we how does he know us we got to open our hearts and let him come in and form his heart in our hearts put his thoughts in our mind Hallelujah also would you put up Amos 3 verse two this is a beautiful scripture Amos 3:2 you only have I known of all the families now just pause right there doesn't God have knowledge of everybody doesn't God know about the Babylonians and the syrians too doesn't God know about of course so this is a different no this is a know by relationship this is a know by Oneness we've have intimacy I've let you know the Oracles of God Amen the Angels delivered the Oracles of God to Israel Hallelujah Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not but they also said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all your heart Hallelujah they also had that one that's not a negative that's a positive amen love the Lord your God with all your heart therefore I will punish you for all your there it is iniquities and see God's faithful if you're a child of God you want God to punish you if you're wrong Hallelujah but notice the word know he said I know Abraham I knew Israel we we must live a life where God can say I know her I know him because we've opened up our hearts and let the word of God come in Hallelujah so see the workers of iniquity in Matthew 7 they never truly followed Jesus they followed his uh they followed the the the the the formula for miracles right a miracle has a pretty simple formul get the person to confess their sins and then uh ask God to move that's really all you got to do is they all you have to have is legal rights over that demon if that person wants to be free and you've got power and authority they can be free right there right or prophecy is just getting in uh the anointing and letting God just speak just God gives you a word just like if you had a dream and it came to pass it's just that just in the channel of God but see then the rest of their life they spent working iniquity going outside of God's word so the the workers of iniquity never F him the workers of iniquity never did God's will God's perfect will for their life Hallelujah they did their own selfish will because God's will uh was rejected in their life he said I never knew you Hallelujah now let's look at a few verses here uh John 10:14 I'm going to get you moving here Cas by God's grace John 1014 I am the Good Shepherd and I know my Sheep amen and I am also known of mine see there is this intimacy with Christ and his followers I know Jesus but thank God Jesus knows me too Hallelujah glory to God those are the I I've seen YouTube videos and thumbnails and some some of them will say the the scariest words in the Bible and where does it always go to it goes to Matthew 7 Lord did I not say Lord Lord did I not cast out Devils didn't I do this for you and he said depart from me workers of iniquity I never knew you now it's scary for them but it's not scary for us because God doesn't give us the spirit of fear but a power love and what a new spirit sound mind Hallelujah see that isn't it so beautiful God's sheep know the voice of the shepherd and the shepherd knows the Sheep Hallelujah wonderful John repeats it in John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me see who see who he knows those who follow the word of God that's who he knows so that means all the rest of those goats never followed him the goats would come around and eat on some of the uh the food of the shepherd but then they go run off and do their own thing but the Sheep stayed with the shepherd the Sheep stayed with Jesus Christ the revealed word of God glory you've been very patient I'm trying to close up here by God's grace all right now we see it plainly there in the scripture and then back to our let's go back to our starting verse second Timothy 2:19 Hallelujah second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth Shore having this seal now the foundation of God think about that the foundation of God God's Temple God's people God's body the foundation of God has this seal the Lord knows them that are his and everyone that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity Hallelujah now I trust you've seen it today by God's grace have you seen it if you want a clean heart let's just review as I'm closing if you want a clean heart you got to open up your heart to God confess any sin and then say God you come in and give me a new heart you come in form the heart in me that would please you let your because my heart is desperately wicked Above All Things the Bible says so come in and create a clean heart within me that loves the word of God that wants to obey the word of God and manifest the stature of Christ I'm going to close with that one second Peter chapter 1 because I saw Chris looking over there might might be a good blessing to you brother let's read second Peter chapter 1 verse verse three according as as his divine power hath given unto us all things everybody say all things ready all you have all things you need church for this life it's all available for you if you're lacking anything just ask God God you say all you have to say is God you promised me all things but it might not be the things you're thinking about it's got to be the spiritual things all things that what pertain to life and godliness so God gives you everything you need for life everything you need to be Godly that means to be like God you have all things I'm not lacking anything well the preacher didn't preach it last week or the preacher this week didn't nope you got all things you got all things through what the knowledge how how do you have all things through the knowledge the understanding right there understanding of him that called us to glory and virtue so God's calling us up come up into Glory come up into virtue where's virtue come up into these things this this uh virtue is your your spiritual strength that you have to testify in public come up into Glory come up I'm going to give you all things for life and godliness verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises we have so many wonderful promises I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you praise God I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Hallelujah so many promises that by these so how do you partake of God's spirit by the promises you have to claim the promises you have to keep the promises hallelujah look what it says verse four that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through lust so what happened in the Garden of Eden it was lust right that's how corruption came into the world but if we want the divine nature if we want all these blessings we got to look at the promise of God and accept the promise of God that's right verse five and beside this giving all diligence that's all of our human strength and effort just like Jesus said love me with all your heart soul mind and strength just like you Brothers I've been talking to you Brothers just like you Brothers put all your strength into those studies getting all those good grades right that's a lesson as you're young ask these adults that's a lesson once you get out of school you got to put that effort into serving God does that make sense you're giving all diligence get some good grades right Brothers yeah Hallelujah proud of them brother Mercy but just like you got to study in whatever you do you know put the headphones on and index cards whatever you do you have to do that that if you're going to overcome Satan got to give all diligence I've never stopped I went through five years of college I got a master's degree I've never stopped studying but I study different things now I study the word of God hallelujah you can't stop studying you got to give all diligence to the word of God and the church said oh you know why because your affection set on things of God am Hallelujah your love is on the things of God verse five and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith so the first first thing you get is Faith when you get saved brother Chris that's the first thing you got is Faith add to that virtue virtue is that power it's the power to testify publicly Faith virtues so if you're able to go to work if you're able to go do Uber and testify Jesus Christ and you're not ashamed of it and the majority time you're living it you got virtue third is uh knowledge which is the mature understanding of the word well why don't women cut their hair and why why don't women wear makeup or or why why should men not cuss and and and fornicate and do porn and all these things you get you gain the understanding in this next step oh and I understand why God's giving me the knowledge of it after knowledge he said Temperance now that's the anointing of self-control Hallelujah where you keep your body under subjection right bring everything into obedience to your bodily passions some people overeat some people have sexual passions that got to overcome anything your body wants right maybe it's fancy clothes and just look good or or whatever you want to do uh any bodily passions they've got to be mortified and uh I preached it a couple years ago at K christen's event and one of the women come up and said Jesse was my favorite speaker but there's only one speaker I'm sorry there's only one person but you know what my whole lesson there I was just preaching on healthy eating right that was so funny my wife's laughing there's like five people in there everybody else got like a 100 people in there meetings but my whole thing was if you want to be healthy you need an anointing to eat the healthy foods it's it's an anointing if you want to live pure sexually you need the anointing of the Holy you need a clean heart amen you need a new spirit praise God you have to say God I can't eat right God I can't uh I can't bring these sexual Temptations under control I forgive me open up your heart and let God come in create a clean heart in there amen that wants to obey the word of God that wants to do it so for that one person it was all worth it that one person who thought I was the best speaker there that conv mention I surely was not verse uh verse six Temperance uh let go back to verse six here and after you get Temperance brother then then you can be patient see once now this relates to marriage too once you get the anointing here you can control yourself sexually then you can be patient for your God to send your spouse Jen's been asking me this week Jen of's been saying uh daddy is my husband going to be a good man is my husband gonna smoke cigarettes I said no he ain't if I got anything to do with it remember Jen remember that I was like God knows I said just like God had a wife for me God's got a husband for you he's going to be a good man by God's grace but see now if you get the anointing of temperance now you can be patient now I can control my body like passions till the right one comes along I got patience on God and patience godliness godliness is being like God loving the unlovable right that's what God God sends rain on the just and the unjust all these Sinners still get rain they all get food they all get oxygen that's godliness loving the unlovable and the the last one before you get the Holy Ghost the last thing God gives you before you get the Holy Ghost is brotherly kindness so you'll treat people in this church like a real brother sister would Hallelujah a real brother sister that's how you know some people lost the anointing or never had the anointing before God will let you into his family with the Holy Ghost he's got to make sure you're going to treat his family the right way Jesus said whatever you treat how you ever you treat them my children that's how you treat me Hallelujah now verse I'm almost done by God's grace and to brotherly kindness charity charity is Good Will it's a love of God God is love so God caps your life off with love love keeps everything amen love holds everything together Hallelujah love keeps me temperate my love for God keep gives me virtue to live publicly the love for God gives me knowledge and understanding this is why I do this this is why I believe this because it's the word of God Amen Hallelujah the love of God seals that in there verse eight now here's where it's important I'm closing with this for in these if these things be in you what things the anointings of the Holy Ghost it's a different anointing but Same Spirit just different different attribute if these things be in you and abound now that's where people fall short you might have a little part of it but you need more of it abound means to overflow Hallelujah I'm living in the Overflow Z where's Z Hallelujah that's that's why we love that song we're living in an abundance we have to have extra brotherly kindness for people extra patience extra godliness and we're supposed to overflow with it Hallelujah now that's where we all fall short I don't get as many amens but it's okay take it as an opportunity to recognize God wants me to go higher today Hallelujah I mean let's all be honest I'm not perfect none of us are perfect but just rejoice in the promise that if you want all things that pertain to life and godliness God will give it to you by confessing the promises amen Lord you promis to give me these things you promis to make me a real child of God you promis you promis to let me have the divine nature so I really manifest Jesus Christ to my church my family my work my school my associates wherever I go my whole entire uh uh group of individuals you promis you let me manifest it so I'm taking you at your word and I believe your promise and God will bring his promise to pass hallelujah amen so if you over flow in patience if you overflow in godliness if you overflow in faith he says they make you that ye shall neither be Barren what's Barren no child no fruit right natural spiritual they make you Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge some people just forget they forget the word they're Barren in the word they don't remember the word can't think of the word but if these things are constantly flowing out of you you're fruitful in the knowledge of God hallelujah constantly thinking about the word of God Claude had a good question this week maybe we'll get to that one here about uh they that are baptized for the Dead Brother Bram gave us did you get that answer brother brother Bram gave us a good answer Paul said why are they baptized for the dead then it doesn't mean they're baptizing for the dead it's referring to Christ why are we baptized for the dead they're saying if Christ is dead why we baptize for the dead he's dead we baptized because he's alive Hallelujah if if we're dead if he died and raised then we we'll die to our sins and we'll raise Hallelujah why would you baptize for the dead if we don't raise again oh it's perfect he says uh verse n but he that lackthe things so think people who lack patience people who lack Temperance they can't control their bodily passions and we've seen this we our church has seen this all these message churches have seen it if people lack these things here's what happens they cannot see far off all they can see is their current situation they can't see God's going to provide and God's going to bring me past this they just get caught up in now now now what do they do they make awful decisions while they're looking at the now they can't see by faith they can't see a far off oh God's going to bring me out of this God's going to help me God's going to strengthen me God's going to keep his word they can only see right here they can only look at their own problems he cannot see a far off and forgotten he was purged from his old sin they let Satan come back in right now we all battle with this right but we got but now we got a good reminder to to battle against it see Satan will come back in he'll remind you remember when you did this when you were 13 I did a lot of bad things when I'm 13 Mercy remember you did this when you were 35 remember you did this last year when you were 43 he'll bring back all these things and if you don't if you're not Anointed with the Holy Ghost and build up on that it'll cause you to be discouraged right it'll cause you to feel like uh I'm I'm blinded where am I going oh right right no spiritual sight what what's happening in my life so we got to constantly keep these things flowing out of our Lives the love of God serving others all these great attributes if not we forget that we're forgiven Hallelujah but the Bible says if you're forgiven once you're forgiven of all sins Hallelujah Jesus has perfected them who are Sanctified Hallelujah once and forever Hallelujah once forever let me see if I can pull that was it forever let me see if I can p that I did come up on forever I'll have to look for that one maybe look at it Wednesday by God's grace now this is where Satan will get people see ah see you're you're you're not forgiven you're not forgiven but you know if you go back and honestly look I repented of that yeah I did but Satan he'll he'll attack you right when you're lacking some of these things or you're struggling he'll come in and say look what you did in the past but you got to say no Satan Jesus Christ forgave me I fulfilled first John chapter 1 I confessed with my mouth and Jesus was faithful and just to forgive me of all unrighteousness and now I'm walking in the light as he's in the light Glory verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling election Ser he said it twice give diligence give all your efforts brothers that's a good lesson for these high schoolers right here I like you know casea come down to my office in the morning and she'll read her Bible and she'll get right into studies you know right that that's what you have to do even after you're done with school you got to get right to your studies your time with God spending time with Jesus Christ Hallelujah give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall so if you constantly keep God's spirit flowing through life all these attributes if you constantly do this you'll never fall away because God's spirit is just flowing through you constantly so if you see your faith getting down say Lord build up my faith you see yourself impatient Lord forgive me for my impatience forgive me for my haste put your patience inside of me and if you keep doing that you'll never fall away I've been saying now for 25 years brother Austin I haven't fallen Away by the grace of God I could have had maybe some excuses to fall away I I haven't fallen away I don't know the devil can lie he can do whatever he wants I'm I'm just saying I'm human I'm I'm just like any else but I have a choice either let these things abound overflow in my life or cut them off but if we let them abound the Bible says that will never fall away hallelujah how many you want to be faithful to God am verse 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ God just keep letting these attributes of the Holy Spirit flow through me let me keep searching my heart so an entrance so one day Jesus will say come on in I always like to use this door come on in an entrance will be made come on in to the kingdom of God it's been prepared for you from the foundation of the world I knew you I I'll say like this I always knew you see he's goingon to tell the workers I never knew you but he's gonna say brother Chris I always knew you brother Austin I always knew you brother Claud I always knew you I can name all of you if you just keep those anointings in your life flowing out it's through the promises God you promised to give this to me you promised to strengthen me you promis to give me all these attributes and if you do that then the entrance will be made into heaven how many looking forward to Heaven let's stand to our feet by God's grace Malachi can come Lydia can come pulled up a creating me a clean heart I'm sure I think I said another song Didn't I can't remember which one
