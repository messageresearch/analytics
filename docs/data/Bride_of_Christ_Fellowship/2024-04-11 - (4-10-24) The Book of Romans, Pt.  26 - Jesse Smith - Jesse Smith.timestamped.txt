[0:00] God's promises to Israel here in Romans
[0:02] chapter 11 I preached on this a couple
[0:04] years ago but it would have been three
[0:06] years ago by now I think by God's
[0:08] grace when I preached uh through the
[0:10] book that the Lord had me right by God's
[0:18] grace Romans 11
[0:28] verse1
[0:46] definitely encourage you know we're more
[0:47] than halfway done through the book I
[0:48] think there's 16 chapters so we're more
[0:50] than halfway by God's
[0:52] grace
[0:56] hallelujah
[0:58] amen I'll read verse one and then we'll
[1:01] read verse Two by God's grace I say then
[1:04] hath God Cast Away his people God forbid
[1:07] for I also am an Israelite of the Seed
[1:10] of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:12] let's read verse two on three one two
[1:14] three God hath not Cast Away his people
[1:18] which he fornew what ye not what the
[1:21] scripture saith of Elias how he maketh
[1:25] intercession to God against Israel
[1:28] saying amen let's have have one more
[1:30] word of prayer if you m on your heart
[1:31] let's make it know to God Heavenly
[1:32] Father we just come again humbly into
[1:34] your presence Lord God anoint us God
[1:37] speak to us here Lord Jesus speak to me
[1:39] Father God and we just want to make our
[1:41] request unto you Lord you know what we
[1:43] have need of so bless us here tonight in
[1:45] your divine presence Lord God father we
[1:47] want to say Lord thank you that our eyes
[1:49] are open Lord this chapter clearly shows
[1:51] how Israel is blinded father thank you
[1:53] for letting our eyes see the Gospel of
[1:56] Jesus Christ what a wonderful beautiful
[1:57] thing it is as we saw on Sunday Lord the
[2:00] righteousness of Jesus Christ thank God
[2:02] that we can see it Lord God and Lord
[2:04] It's not by our works but by Grace we
[2:07] thank you for Amazing Grace in Jesus
[2:09] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[2:12] God bless you as you being seated praise
[2:13] God so let's get through this uh read
[2:16] through this chapter here it's like I
[2:18] said it's a little bit of a review from
[2:19] a few years ago if anybody can remember
[2:22] back to those uh the series when I
[2:24] preach on the spiritual blindness of
[2:26] Israel
[2:28] Hallelujah so we read verse one uh Paul
[2:31] says hath God uh Cast Away his people
[2:35] and he says uh God
[2:37] forbid so God has not forsaken
[2:40] Israel Hallelujah because then he says
[2:43] uh because I am a Seed of Abraham
[2:46] Hallelujah of The Tribe of
[2:49] Benjamin so he puts himself in there of
[2:52] course he's speaking of that day at the
[2:53] present day he's speaking of the present
[2:55] day Jews was God finished with present
[2:57] day Jews and he says no he said even I
[3:00] am a Seed of Abraham verse two God hath
[3:04] not Cast Away his people which he forew
[3:07] so now we get this uh again the
[3:09] Revelation from chapter 8 about
[3:11] predestination God fornew hallelujah
[3:13] forn knowledge was first Hallelujah God
[3:16] forew who would choose him and then
[3:18] because of his for knowledge then he
[3:20] could predestinate the events of Our
[3:22] Lives amen so we see this Paul brings
[3:25] forn knowledge into Israel and
[3:28] understanding Israel's place so that
[3:29] means just apply it to today that means
[3:32] God knows all about the Israel Hamas war
[3:35] god knew about October 7th right that's
[3:37] when it started right The Invasion just
[3:39] like we all remember September 11th in
[3:41] America right right we remember that
[3:44] because it was such a disastrous day
[3:46] well God forew it yet God allowed it
[3:50] right take gives me Comfort God allows
[3:52] what happened today or what happened
[3:53] this week for you know our family you
[3:55] know God foresees everything he allowed
[3:57] it for a purpose amen God has for
[4:00] knowledge and as we go through the tests
[4:02] and trials God many times wants to see
[4:04] what we're going to say about it how
[4:05] we're going to act about it praise God
[4:07] are we going to give God praise or we're
[4:08] going to withhold the praise amen as we
[4:11] saying we always got a reason to praise
[4:13] Hallelujah so God is Not Cast Away
[4:16] Israel and then he goes to this idea of
[4:19] Elijah uh he say don't you remember what
[4:22] uh God said about Elijah he made
[4:24] intercession to God against Israel verse
[4:27] three saying Lord they've killed thy
[4:29] prophets and and dig down thine altars
[4:30] and I'm left alone and they seek my
[4:33] life so he felt like he was all alone
[4:37] right Elijah thought he was the only one
[4:39] left right and so anyone that says
[4:42] prophets don't make mistakes or prophets
[4:43] are infallible you know of course
[4:45] they're wrong but it's another clear
[4:48] example right and I ran into one of
[4:50] those people this week again on the
[4:51] comments and I asked him what about all
[4:53] these things that brother brandom you
[4:55] know corrected later and he said well we
[4:58] don't he said we just believe every word
[5:00] and we'll let God figure that out later
[5:03] but God doesn't uh ask us to to to be
[5:06] ignorant of things right God doesn't ask
[5:08] us to believe things that we know or
[5:09] clearly there see seems to be some
[5:11] contradiction God's not saying turn off
[5:13] your
[5:14] discernment God's not saying turn off
[5:16] your brain when you come to church right
[5:18] your understanding your knowledge but
[5:19] the Bible said grow in knowledge
[5:22] somebody asked me that oh yeah um one of
[5:24] the sisters from Junction City I guess
[5:26] she went to a wonderful meeting there in
[5:28] Alabama she said I've believe I have the
[5:30] Holy Ghost brother Jesse uh I said
[5:32] praise the Lord she said but the devil's
[5:34] been fighting me this whole drive up
[5:36] from Alabama that's a long car ride kind
[5:37] of like Abraham right all those miles he
[5:40] was walking the devil was battling him
[5:42] and the de she said the devil's been
[5:44] telling me you can't have the Holy Ghost
[5:45] because you don't understand the whole
[5:47] Bible I said Well when the people got
[5:50] the holy ghost in the Bible some of the
[5:51] Bible wasn't even written yet right
[5:55] right and if if you have to understand
[5:57] the whole Bible to know you're born
[5:59] again then Jesus was wrong when Jesus
[6:01] said the Holy Ghost will guide you into
[6:02] all truth after you already got it right
[6:06] so and then I shared you know Peter said
[6:08] grow in
[6:10] Grace sorry grow in Grace and knowledge
[6:12] of the
[6:13] Lord battling little dry throat here
[6:17] sorry so Peter says you still got to
[6:19] grow right you still got to grow as a
[6:20] Christian even though he's born again he
[6:22] still got to grow as a Christian
[6:24] Hallelujah pardon me I just got a little
[6:26] dry throat there I don't have a water up
[6:28] here uh L you want to get me a water
[6:31] there could you get oh yeah okay thank
[6:32] you I usually don't drink water when I
[6:34] preach but usually don't have a a runny
[6:36] nose when I preach either or bat on a
[6:39] cough or anything like
[6:41] that all right so um get back here to
[6:45] the scriptures by God's
[6:47] grace verse four but what sayith the
[6:49] answer of God unto him unto Elijah I
[6:52] have reserved to myself 7,000 men who
[6:54] have not bowed the knee to the image of
[6:57] baos I love this um
[7:00] God Saves a Remnant God always has a
[7:03] small group that he will have as
[7:05] Believers hallelujah thank you hun
[7:08] appreciate that Dar thank you thanks for
[7:10] ministering to
[7:13] me doesn't the bride always minister to
[7:15] the the
[7:16] groom is that the scripture are we going
[7:18] to minister to Christ brother man always
[7:21] use that
[7:23] illustration right so I love this God
[7:25] forn knows and so God can reserve a
[7:28] small group now do you remember that
[7:29] that story how did God Reserve 7,000
[7:32] well God reserved some of them by uh
[7:35] which which man was it he hid uh
[7:37] prophets Obadiah was it Obadiah Obadiah
[7:40] had prophets and he fed them bread and
[7:42] water out in the cave can you imagine
[7:44] that you know God says I'm going to save
[7:47] some people how does he do it he lets
[7:48] them hide out in a cave right that's the
[7:51] same God that would send fire down from
[7:54] heaven for Elijah the same
[7:56] God right like I said there on on Sunday
[7:58] the same God that saved Shadrach mear
[8:00] and abedo in a literal fire then allowed
[8:03] Daniel's parents to to be
[8:05] slaughtered same God same God so what
[8:09] what we must understand is that whatever
[8:10] God allows God just is putting us to the
[8:13] test and he wants to see us stand upon
[8:14] the word of God Amen whether delivered
[8:17] or whether not delivered just like those
[8:18] three Hebrew children no matter what
[8:20] happens we're not going to bow to the
[8:21] devil hallelujah we're going to keep the
[8:24] word of God hallelujah we're going to
[8:26] obey the word of God so no matter the
[8:27] test you go through the same answer in
[8:30] every test stand on God's word
[8:31] Hallelujah by God's grace help us not to
[8:34] compromise on our faith Hallelujah I
[8:37] want to preach a I've had that thought
[8:39] for a while I just want to preach a Ser
[8:41] a sermon called
[8:43] compromise so I've been looking at that
[8:45] meditating on that you know trying to
[8:47] gather some scriptures on that
[8:48] compromise right we don't want to
[8:50] compromise on the word of God
[8:55] hallelujah pardon me okay now so God
[8:58] reserves 7,000 so God had 7,000 he said
[9:02] are not going to Bow the knee I love how
[9:04] God always reserves himself a Remnant
[9:07] and now we get to verse five even so
[9:11] then in this present time also there's a
[9:12] Remnant according to the election of
[9:16] Grace
[9:17] Hallelujah so Paul says just like there
[9:19] were 7,000 in the Days of Elijah he said
[9:23] so there is a small group today that
[9:25] will recognize Christ and as we'll see
[9:28] still be saved even though they're
[9:29] blinded so God always has a Remnant when
[9:33] it looks like there's nobody else when
[9:35] when it feels like we're the only one oh
[9:37] there's other people hallelujah there
[9:38] there's others Hallelujah now before the
[9:41] Rapture Church it will get down to the
[9:43] last person with the baptism of the Holy
[9:45] Ghost will have it the last one that's
[9:47] going to get it is going to get it by
[9:48] God's grace but then the Bible says at
[9:51] that moment he that's holy let him be
[9:53] holy that means he that's got the Holy
[9:54] Ghost he's got the Holy Ghost he that's
[9:56] righteous he that's a foolish virgin let
[9:58] him be a foolish virgin
[10:00] so at that Rapture moment you are what
[10:02] you are right that's what the Bible says
[10:03] in revelation
[10:05] 22 so at some point it's going to be
[10:07] that final one gets the Holy Ghost the
[10:09] final one gets saved and then when all
[10:12] the names on the on the book are
[10:13] redeemed and are experiencing the grace
[10:15] of God then Jesus will come back to
[10:17] Rapture the bride Hallelujah because we
[10:19] can see that plainly in
[10:22] scripture so there there's going to be a
[10:24] moment when that final one the final one
[10:26] elected to the Holy Ghost the final one
[10:28] elected to the foolish virgin
[10:30] uh will have that experience and then
[10:32] Jesus will come and rescue the bride
[10:34] Hallelujah just like he did with uh just
[10:37] like he did with uh uh Enoch was rescued
[10:39] right before the the flood Hallelujah
[10:41] Enoch was rescued Before the Flood
[10:42] Elijah was rescued Hallelujah each time
[10:44] there's a Rapture that they were rescued
[10:46] by the grace of God now uh even Esther
[10:50] Esther was rescued from Death Hallelujah
[10:52] verse six now and if by Grace so if
[10:56] there is a Remnant by Grace then is no
[10:58] more works
[11:00] okay otherwise Grace is no more Grace
[11:03] but if it be by works then is no more
[11:06] grace otherwise work is no more work
[11:09] that's quite isn't that quite a
[11:10] statement wow what a
[11:12] statement if you are if you are in God's
[11:16] elected group if you're in that called
[11:18] out group you didn't work it up God just
[11:21] gave you Grace to be there now the
[11:24] difference is God gave God offered the
[11:26] grace to everybody but you were the ones
[11:29] that accepted it praise God you're the
[11:31] one that accepted that gift receipt and
[11:33] said yes I'll go into that Variety Store
[11:35] boy I need to go in there tonight and
[11:36] get some I need make sure honey make
[11:38] sure I check out before I leave here by
[11:40] God's grace I check out with some Grace
[11:42] and peace and hope you know how about
[11:43] that and
[11:45] kindness I was saying I'm not gonna say
[11:47] what I'm saying I better leave that
[11:51] alone by but see uh we didn't work for
[11:56] it like we didn't earn it it was by
[11:57] God's grace it's like like Abraham you
[12:00] know we just walked in the grace that
[12:01] was given to us right awesome we just we
[12:04] just heard the voice of God we just
[12:06] followed the voice of God it's by God's
[12:09] grace and every time we stumbled God
[12:10] forgave us and we kept going on
[12:12] Hallelujah right it's by Grace we didn't
[12:15] you know we didn't work it as far as
[12:17] like we didn't earn it by our
[12:18] works it was offered to everybody we
[12:21] told other people about the message how
[12:23] many people have we invited to church
[12:24] and how many people why didn't they come
[12:26] well that was their choice but it was
[12:28] offered it was all offered by Grace
[12:32] Hallelujah you know church and really
[12:34] you know the victories we've had it's
[12:36] been by
[12:37] Grace
[12:39] right uh you know yeah we sacrificed we
[12:42] prayed you know small things like that
[12:44] but really the victory was God because
[12:47] greater is he that's in us than in than
[12:50] he that's in the world like the victory
[12:51] was because of him
[12:54] Hallelujah and yes yeah we did we did
[12:56] surrender we did obey by his grace like
[12:58] we finally obey right like I've said
[13:00] many times you know if God ever does
[13:02] anything good in my life it's because I
[13:03] finally yielded amen I finally got I
[13:06] finally obeyed the word of God it took a
[13:09] while but by God's grace we obeyed amen
[13:11] amen same thing with Abraham finally you
[13:13] know finally he obeyed remember God had
[13:15] to visit him time and time again until
[13:17] he finally believed Hallelujah that's
[13:20] Grace hallelujah amen right Abraham
[13:23] didn't earn a body change it was God's
[13:27] it was just God's calling for him amen
[13:29] hallelujah and he walked into it but
[13:32] wasn't lot invited yes lot was invited
[13:34] too but he chose to go down to Sodom and
[13:36] goor right or Sodom rather he chose to
[13:40] go down there but it was offered to him
[13:42] he knew about the prophet amen he knew
[13:44] about the promised son he knew about
[13:46] Sarah he knew about that
[13:49] Hallelujah so it's not by our works but
[13:52] it's by Grace hallelujah amen always
[13:55] it's going to be by Grace Hallelujah so
[13:57] just always keep that in your heart and
[13:58] mind it's or saved by remember Paul said
[14:00] I labor not by works but by the grace
[14:02] that's given unto
[14:03] me and let me go back to that
[14:05] illustration you either got five bags of
[14:07] gold five talents of gold two or one
[14:09] According To Jesus that was given to you
[14:11] by grace and all that you can purchase
[14:14] with that was a gift like you're just
[14:16] using somebody else's money God's
[14:20] money your talents and and everything
[14:22] you can purchase on this Earth remember
[14:24] the Bible says buy the truth and sell it
[14:26] not every you can everything you can buy
[14:28] and purchase and invest in the kingdom
[14:30] of God was you didn't you didn't pay for
[14:32] it it was just given to you right amen
[14:35] like that ability you have to see dreams
[14:37] or the ability that you have to testify
[14:38] to people that was a gift of Goden that
[14:42] was still not your money that was God's
[14:44] money that's why it's all it all goes
[14:47] back to God all the glory goes back to
[14:49] God
[14:51] hallelujah so so we have to apply it to
[14:53] Elijah how could Elijah overcome how
[14:56] could Elijah uh not give up it was
[14:59] Grace how could Elijah call fire down
[15:02] from heaven it was Grace it was shown to
[15:04] him amen he didn't have the he didn't
[15:06] have the power to call it down like that
[15:08] verse in the previous chapter Elijah
[15:10] didn't go up to God and say God you come
[15:11] down here and you send fire now it was
[15:14] he didn't Ascend up to heaven and none
[15:16] of us can Ascend down and get the lord
[15:18] it's all given by Amazing Grace
[15:21] Hallelujah like brother R said if God
[15:23] ever gives you a healing you didn't work
[15:24] yourself into it it was given to you by
[15:27] Grace works his faith expr 1965 if you
[15:30] want the reference on that one I
[15:31] appreciate that brother cams in that uh
[15:34] no it was the Sunday morning service it
[15:35] was Easter morning I I took a little
[15:37] section of that might have been a
[15:38] two-hour sermon but I took a little
[15:39] section of that and and just showed all
[15:41] those quotes it's got to be revealed
[15:43] first he even healing is a gift right
[15:47] even healing is a gift of God but said
[15:49] you'll never work yourself into it in
[15:51] other words it's got to be part of the
[15:52] plan of God am now the and the only way
[15:55] to miss that is
[15:56] unbelief right right so the main thing
[15:59] to do is no matter what if we're seeking
[16:01] healing or financial restitution
[16:04] amen no matter what we're seeking it's
[16:07] confess confess God's going to do it
[16:10] hope hope and trust God will do it and
[16:12] if and and when God drops down and you
[16:14] know he's going to do it now that's a
[16:15] revelation praise God but hope in the
[16:18] Lord don't give up on God don't walk
[16:20] away as we saw on Sunday don't don't
[16:22] turn around and don't stagger amen right
[16:26] right don't walk away from it just stay
[16:28] right with it amen
[16:30] hope in the Lord the Bible says
[16:32] hallelujah hope until faith comes right
[16:35] Hallelujah hope until Faith Comes that's
[16:37] right because it's not by our works it's
[16:40] by Grace Grace is unmar favor it's by
[16:44] the favor of God I just always love that
[16:47] uh scripture from
[16:49] Psalms uh the way I know God favors me
[16:52] is because my enemies don't triumph over
[16:54] me remember David said that that's the
[16:57] way I know God favors me cuz I don't
[16:59] fall to my enemies amen they can try to
[17:02] discourage me try to curse me they can
[17:04] try to do all these things but I don't
[17:06] fall to them I don't suit to their level
[17:09] I don't walk away from God I just stay
[17:11] with the word of God
[17:12] hallelujah I'm not a perfect
[17:14] representation but I sure am on the
[17:16] Lord's Side hallelujah hallelujah praise
[17:19] God won't desert the faith because God
[17:21] didn't desert me on the cross Jesus
[17:23] didn't leave me on the cross Jesus Jesus
[17:26] didn't say well I actually want to get
[17:27] down no he he he bore the pain for me he
[17:31] went all the way for me I'll go all the
[17:32] way for him in my humble little
[17:34] expression of Love Hallelujah my humble
[17:36] expression of Faith I'll go all the way
[17:38] with Christ
[17:39] hallelujah amen now so see it's not by
[17:42] our works ultimately it won't be our
[17:45] works it'll be by grace verse 7 what
[17:48] then Israel hath not obtained that which
[17:50] he seeketh for but the election hath
[17:52] obtained it and the rest were blinded
[17:57] okay Accord according as it is written
[17:59] God hath given them the Spirit of
[18:01] Slumber eyes that they should not see
[18:03] and ears that they should not hear unto
[18:05] this
[18:06] day of course that's in Isaiah 29:10 but
[18:09] we're not going to read that and David
[18:11] said let their table be made a snare and
[18:13] a trap and a stumbling block and a
[18:14] recompense unto them let their eyes be
[18:16] darkened that they may not see and bow
[18:18] down their back always I say then have
[18:21] they stumbled that they should fall God
[18:25] forbid okay he's talking about the whole
[18:27] of Israel as isra stumbled that they'll
[18:30] fall and they'll never get back to God
[18:32] he said God forbid but rather through
[18:34] their fall salvation is come to the
[18:37] Gentiles for to provoke them to
[18:40] jealousy
[18:43] Hallelujah okay so they stumbled so we
[18:47] could have an opportunity with with
[18:48] Grace amen right now just you know all
[18:53] we can do is give thanks that's all we
[18:56] can do brother R always explains it like
[18:58] this if you listen to the seals and
[18:59] right even in uh I was listening to uh
[19:02] the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit
[19:04] to Daniel because we just saw Daniel you
[19:06] I was like I want to listen to this by
[19:08] God's grace but brother always explained
[19:10] it like this he said we should be so
[19:11] humble because God blinded his own
[19:14] children that we could be saved that so
[19:17] think about your children think about
[19:19] our children think about blinding them
[19:22] and denying them of privileges so
[19:24] somebody else can have
[19:26] blessings that that's the simp simple
[19:29] way brother Ram explains the fact that
[19:31] we get Amazing Grace God blinded his own
[19:33] children what would you deprive your
[19:36] children you would deprive anything
[19:37] hardly right like we want them to have
[19:39] the best
[19:41] right but God in his love he says well
[19:45] they many of them have rejected me so
[19:47] I'm going to Blind them that have
[19:48] rejected me all the day long you know
[19:50] they they called him be elub you know
[19:53] they they they they they they uh they
[19:55] tried to kill him they tried to Stone
[19:56] him they tried to do all these things
[19:58] God protected him remember many times he
[20:00] walked they tried to throw him off a
[20:02] cliff they triy to tempt him with his
[20:04] words they try to to catch him in and
[20:07] catch him in his words and make him uh
[20:09] make mistakes and everything and the
[20:11] member of the Bible said all day long he
[20:13] held out his hands for them am
[20:16] Hallelujah but then when the the
[20:17] crucifixion they said let his blood be
[20:19] on us then what did Jesus do he blinded
[20:22] them they stumbled that we might accept
[20:24] God's grace
[20:27] Hallelujah so we thank God yes we thank
[20:29] God for Amazing Grace
[20:32] Hallelujah but see they're not going to
[20:34] fall they're not going to be down
[20:35] forever God's going to lift them up
[20:38] Hallelujah and you can see it you can
[20:40] see it uh it's the group I was on their
[20:42] website this week Temple Institute
[20:44] that's Israel's uh that's one of the the
[20:47] the conservative groups of Israel that's
[20:49] trying to get the temple rebuilt now of
[20:52] course they haven't succeeded because
[20:53] they need that location the Dome of the
[20:55] Rock right that Muslim shrines there but
[20:58] their hope and their dream their desire
[21:00] is to build the temple and then they
[21:02] know the Messiah will come to the temple
[21:03] and he
[21:04] will right he'll be right next to it the
[21:07] Bible said Jesus would be on the Mount
[21:08] of Olives there's two scriptures that
[21:10] say that Zechariah I think it's 14 and
[21:13] then uh Revelation 14 if I'm not
[21:15] mistaken I might be wrong with the
[21:16] Zechariah but I know Revelation 14 for
[21:18] sure he's going to stand right next
[21:20] there's a little Valley between Mount of
[21:21] Olives and Mount Zion where's he at
[21:23] there he is all these Bible names in
[21:25] here Malachi and all these things where
[21:27] quote quot all these scriptures
[21:29] nature and virtue and everything
[21:31] Hallelujah
[21:33] Lydia but right Jesus will stand right
[21:36] there on Mount Mount olives Hallelujah
[21:38] and there'll be a temple there
[21:40] Hallelujah and the 144,000 will look at
[21:42] Jesus and then they'll weep from house
[21:44] to house but then a fountain will be
[21:46] open it won't be a natural Fountain but
[21:48] a spiritual Fountain Hallelujah where
[21:51] they can come and enjoy the Waters of
[21:52] life like we enjoy right now amen how
[21:56] enjoy the Waters of Life hallelujah amen
[21:58] where sometimes God's mercy uh Haven it
[22:00] feels like it's just flowing out towards
[22:02] us right we just feel like waves of
[22:04] God's us you know waves of God's water
[22:07] just gushing out towards us hallelujah
[22:10] blessing after blessing hallelujah amen

[22:17] it's a fountain that's open hallelujah
[22:19] amen forgiveness after forgiveness
[22:22] second chance after third chance and so
[22:24] many chances it's a fountain amen and
[22:28] you thank God you can't turn it off amen
[22:31] I don't want it off thank God it's it's
[22:33] constantly flowing until we go in the
[22:35] Rapture
[22:36] Hallelujah let it flow
[22:38] Hallelujah Let it Flow by God's grace I
[22:42] love it amen but one day God will open
[22:45] that Fountain to Israel praise God
[22:48] they're blinded right now they can't see
[22:49] it right now but one day they'll eyes
[22:51] open and they'll see a fountain in the
[22:53] House of David Hallelujah and the Bible
[22:56] say it's a spirit of Grace and
[22:58] supplication Spirit of Grace amen
[23:00] hallelujah Grace Grace unmar favor
[23:03] Hallelujah am and supplication is prayer
[23:06] right it's specific prayer that's what
[23:08] supplication is a David or Daniel made
[23:11] supplication to God for his people one
[23:13] to know the right time it's a specific
[23:15] prayer
[23:16] supplication and and Israel have the
[23:19] spirit of Grace favor and supplication
[23:22] specific prayer and the Bible said a
[23:25] nation will be born in one
[23:27] day all right yes little review here by
[23:29] God's grace now verse 12 now if the fall
[23:32] of them be the riches of the world a
[23:34] spiritual riches
[23:36] right and the diminishing of them The
[23:39] Riches of the Gentiles how much more
[23:42] their
[23:43] fullness in other words if if the
[23:46] Gentiles have this great blessing how
[23:48] much more will Israel get a great
[23:49] blessing when God returns to them if we
[23:53] enjoy all this now what are they going
[23:54] to get hallelujah amen they're going to
[23:57] get a great blessing amen
[23:59] I just reading about it today you know
[24:00] there's so many scriptures that speak
[24:02] about this how Israel is going to be uh
[24:04] the house of the Lord the joy of the
[24:06] Lord the joy of the whole earth praise
[24:08] God Amen so many wonderful promises
[24:10] Millennial promises verse 13 for I speak
[24:14] to you Gentiles in as much as I am an
[24:16] apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine
[24:19] office this answered I think n nature
[24:21] had a question about Paul being the uh
[24:24] the Paul being the pattern for for the
[24:27] uh believers and he is here here he
[24:29] magnifies his office as a Bible writer
[24:32] as an apostle Apostle means one sent
[24:35] Paul was sent to make churches to make
[24:37] converts praise God to set them in order
[24:40] he was sent even to prison sent to
[24:42] prison to write the Bible praise God
[24:45] hallelujah think about that and I heard
[24:47] I heard brother Donnie say thisday I was
[24:48] listening to brother Donnie this morning
[24:50] I heard brother Donnie say that you know
[24:52] imagine being in the first century
[24:53] church right and you're up there you're
[24:56] you're preaching and reading quotes qu
[24:58] from a man who's in prison Paul let's
[25:01] say we're like colossia or
[25:03] Ephesus and I got up here now let's
[25:05] let's I'm going to preach tonight and
[25:07] I'm going to unroll this letter we got
[25:08] from
[25:09] Paul and the people watching would say
[25:12] oh look there are cult you know look at
[25:13] this cult they're reading a they're not
[25:16] reading just the Torah now they're
[25:17] reading a message of a man who's in jail
[25:21] and he spent a lot of time in
[25:23] jail he just wasn't in and out once you
[25:25] know he was in there a lot and they say
[25:28] oh he's a cult they're a cult they just
[25:30] quote this Prophet all the time Prophet
[25:32] who's in
[25:34] jail I thought wow that really blew my
[25:36] mind like that really made it real for
[25:38] us
[25:39] right he's in jail you know he's not
[25:42] perfect he says he does things that he
[25:43] hates and one time uh he said something
[25:46] wrong and the high priest slapped him
[25:47] remember the high priest slapped him
[25:48] there he didn't know he was talking to
[25:50] the high priest and he got slapped
[25:51] because he made a mistake he reviled the
[25:53] Lord's high
[25:55] priest but you know just the reality of
[25:58] wow we're in a similar situation I'm
[26:00] reading quotes from a prophet right who
[26:03] gets mocked and made fun of and accused
[26:06] but what did that Prophet do he spoke
[26:07] with thus sayith the Lord amen now it's
[26:10] not a perfect parallel because you know
[26:11] brother R's sermon books are not all
[26:13] thus sayith the Lord right but there are
[26:15] Bible teachings in there there's a lot
[26:17] of Bible teaching and there's numerous
[26:18] thus say the Lords in here
[26:20] hallelujah and so you know it's just the
[26:22] similarity of you're quoting a man that
[26:25] uh wasn't perfect well who isn't right
[26:29] Muhammad wasn't perfect Buddha wasn't
[26:31] perfect of
[26:32] course but see when we're quing Jesus
[26:35] now we are quing a man that was perfect
[26:37] Hallelujah remember God sent Paul God
[26:40] sent John Wesley uh Martin Luther
[26:42] brother random Hallelujah and so we got
[26:44] to be careful Jesus is the only one
[26:46] right and are the Bible writers are the
[26:48] only ones those words are absolutely
[26:50] infallible Hallelujah so it takes a
[26:52] great balance by God's grace now verse
[26:56] 14 if by any means I may provoke to
[26:59] emulation them which are my flesh and
[27:02] might save some of them so Paul wanted
[27:04] to stir up some of these blind Jews so
[27:07] somehow their blinders could come off
[27:10] isn't that
[27:12] something that's just that's really uh
[27:15] really shows the love of Paul Paul knew
[27:18] they were blind but he said I still want
[27:20] to try to provoke them and see can I
[27:22] save some of them Hallelujah the church
[27:26] if you ever feel like you know your
[27:27] friends or family blind don't give up on
[27:30] them keep trying to provoke them not in
[27:32] a good way I'm talking a good way I'm
[27:33] not I'm not talking a sinful way in a
[27:37] good way just testify them tell them the
[27:38] good things God has done for you praise
[27:42] God he says verse 15 for if the casting
[27:45] of them away of them be the reconciling
[27:48] of the world which shall the receiving
[27:50] of them I'm sorry what shall the
[27:52] receiving of them be but life from the
[27:54] dead there's the dry bones coming back
[27:56] to
[27:56] life right
[27:58] they were cast away but God's going to
[28:00] bring them back it's like being from
[28:02] dead to Alive praise
[28:04] God have you seen those Jews ever do
[28:06] their dances they can really shout have
[28:08] you ever seen them pray at the Wailing
[28:10] Wall and dance at the Wailing
[28:13] Wall it's really intense it's really
[28:16] heartfelt so what is it going to be like
[28:18] when they get the Holy Ghost if they're
[28:21] having that much joy and that much
[28:22] Victory if they're having that much time
[28:24] with God what's it going to be like when
[28:25] they're born again it's going to be just
[28:27] like Acts chapter 2 hallelujah amen
[28:31] it'll be noise abroad even more praise
[28:33] God 144,000 of them that's quite a
[28:36] Revival
[28:38] hallelujah it's going to be like life
[28:40] from the dead like that song You Brought
[28:42] me Back to Life
[28:45] Hallelujah verse 16 for if the first
[28:48] fruit be holy the lump is also holy if
[28:52] the root be holy so are the branches and
[28:55] if some of the branches be broken off
[28:56] and thou being a wild olive tree so
[28:58] we're in God's eyes a wild olive
[29:01] tree right we our our Gentiles were wild
[29:05] in other words we didn't have the law of
[29:07] God right we the Angels didn't visit us
[29:10] they visited the Jews right we saw that
[29:13] in Colossians right Israel had all the
[29:15] Oracles of God right they had all the
[29:17] promises of God we were not I'm sorry we
[29:20] were far off from the blood of Jesus
[29:21] Christ but now the blood has brought us
[29:24] close to God
[29:26] hallelujah so see we're close to God now
[29:28] and the Bible says the word must be nigh
[29:31] us even in our lips praise God so now
[29:34] that we're close to the blood now the
[29:35] word has got to be in our mouth
[29:38] Hallelujah all right thank the Lord now
[29:42] so God looks at at us we used to be a
[29:45] wild Olive Branch but W grafted in among
[29:48] them and with them partak us of the root
[29:51] and fatness of the Olive Tree so we're
[29:53] like just like the Candlestick we're
[29:55] drawing on the same life that Israel
[29:57] Drew on
[29:58] amen hallelujah praise God the fatness
[30:02] of it the richness of it hallelujah
[30:04] we're drawing on the grace of God the
[30:06] power of God
[30:07] hallelujah Verse 18 boast not against
[30:10] the branches so here's where we don't
[30:11] want to we don't want to be prideful and
[30:14] exalt ourselves like we're so much
[30:15] better than Israel right that's what the
[30:17] Bible says
[30:18] here but if thou boast thou bearest not
[30:21] the root but the root thee thou will say
[30:25] then the branches were broken off that I
[30:26] might be grafted in that's that's true
[30:28] remember they stumbled so you could you
[30:30] could receive it right and now we get
[30:33] the other illustration one illustration
[30:34] is stumbling they fell so we could we
[30:36] could win the race right here's another
[30:39] one though they were cut off that we
[30:40] might be grafted in so there's a couple
[30:43] illustrations he gives well because of
[30:45] unbelief they were broken off see God
[30:48] gave them uh 1500 years of the law Moses
[30:52] received the law they had, 1500 years
[30:54] now look we we at this point we have 500
[30:56] more years in Israel we've we've had
[30:59] God's grace 500 more years
[31:02] Hallelujah the presence of God the
[31:04] testimonies of God the supernatural
[31:06] things of God the word of God hallelujah
[31:09] the fresh Revelation we've had 500
[31:11] additional years than Israel got talk
[31:13] about Grace
[31:15] amen talk about favor
[31:18] hallelujah it's been given to the
[31:21] Gentiles okay they were broken
[31:24] off that you might be grafted in verse
[31:26] 20 because of unbelief that they were
[31:28] broken off and thou standest by faith be
[31:30] not high- minded but fear of course this
[31:34] doesn't mean the uh the the sinful fear
[31:36] it means
[31:37] honor give God
[31:40] honor uh yesterday at bible Club at the
[31:42] middle school they asked one of the kids
[31:43] what is fear mean what does fear of God
[31:45] mean and they couldn't
[31:47] answer right and so we tried to give
[31:48] them
[31:50] illustrations uh you know and it's kind
[31:52] of like uh it's kind of like on Narnia
[31:54] where the lion right
[31:55] asan he's real kind
[31:58] but he's also real
[32:00] powerful right so it's like you got to
[32:02] got to have that respect it's kind of
[32:03] like a actual actually like a real
[32:05] animal in real life right brother Austin
[32:06] kind of like with dogs right if it's a
[32:08] real strong dog right you gotta you got
[32:10] to be real you got to be happy about it
[32:12] but you got to be real careful not to
[32:13] make it mad
[32:15] Hallelujah right you got to have that
[32:16] respect right it's kind of like even uh
[32:19] owning a firearm right there's power in
[32:21] there so you got to respect that you got
[32:23] to respect that that that that gun right
[32:25] you just can't just throw it around you
[32:27] can't just drop it all around can't just
[32:29] leave bullets in it you know and
[32:31] safety's off you know you can't you
[32:33] can't can't do that right you got to
[32:36] respect the power That's What God Says
[32:39] church we got to respect God's power
[32:44] Hallelujah so be not high minded so
[32:46] don't be prideful right that's one thing
[32:48] I I've said it before we battle most as
[32:50] as the the message Believers we battle
[32:52] Pride the most because we know more but
[32:55] that shouldn't make us prideful that
[32:57] should make us more humble
[32:58] humble right because we're now
[33:00] accountable for all that we know right
[33:03] it just makes us more accountable verse
[33:06] 21 so here's why he tells us to honor
[33:08] God for if God spare not the natural
[33:10] branches take he lest he also spare thee
[33:13] not so always keep that in mind God can
[33:16] get rid of us whenever he wants now
[33:18] we're we're trusting by Grace right
[33:21] we're we're trusting in the grace of God
[33:23] but Paul's talking about having a
[33:25] prideful
[33:26] attitude right so if we remain humble
[33:29] then God will bless us but if people get
[33:32] prideful God can cut them off if they
[33:34] get prideful right like that good
[33:37] example we saw was Nebuchadnezzar he got
[33:39] so prideful I built this Kingdom I built
[33:41] these Hanging Gardens these wonders of
[33:44] the world and Daniel said because you
[33:46] didn't see that was God now you're going
[33:48] to be a beast for seven
[33:50] years right and you're going to live
[33:52] amongst the animals and the Dew of
[33:53] heaven will be all over you and you'll
[33:55] look like an animal with the claws and
[33:57] the beard and everything God humbled him
[34:00] right because he thought this was all
[34:02] because of me so see Church no matter
[34:04] what we build on this Earth we got to
[34:06] remember wasn't because we're special
[34:08] it's because God gave us Grace
[34:10] hallelujah amen if any if anything good
[34:13] comes out of your life it was God's
[34:15] grace like a lot of people say
[34:18] uh well I just I just I just caught like
[34:21] if there a business person they'll say I
[34:23] just caught it at the right time I
[34:24] invested at Amazon at the right time it
[34:26] was my great decision no you were just
[34:28] it was just ordained for you to do it
[34:31] right it was just ordained and now what
[34:33] are you going to do with that benefit
[34:35] that's what God's going to hold you
[34:36] accountable for
[34:39] Hallelujah right we all wish we could
[34:41] have lived there you know right before
[34:43] Amazon we could invested in Amazon and
[34:45] our stocks would be so
[34:47] high but it was ordained for some people
[34:49] other people weren't ordained to
[34:53] Hallelujah now he
[34:56] says verse 20
[34:58] two behold therefore the goodness and
[35:00] severity of God so that there there it
[35:02] is that responsibility right that that
[35:04] that respect that fear for God the honor
[35:06] for God God is good but he also can be
[35:08] very
[35:10] severe right a Lon can be very beautiful
[35:14] and soft but can also be very
[35:16] Fierce
[35:18] right on them which fell severity so
[35:21] Israel but toward thee goodness if if
[35:25] thou there's that if there's that
[35:26] conditional promise right it's
[35:27] unconditional in God's sight because he
[35:29] knows who's predestinated to accept it
[35:31] but for us we got to act like well we
[35:34] know it's conditional right so we know
[35:36] we know there's uh there's uh
[35:39] consequences to our
[35:41] decisions Hallelujah there's the if if
[35:44] you continue in his goodness otherwise
[35:46] Thou shalt be cut
[35:47] off so he's talking to the Gentiles the
[35:50] Gentiles will be cut off because they
[35:52] won't continue in God's goodness now
[35:53] anybody with an honest heart anybody
[35:56] here of course sees it plainly but but
[35:57] anybody can see most churches have not
[36:01] gone in the goodness of God because of
[36:03] things they allow like abortion right
[36:06] and transgender and homosexuality right
[36:08] and adulteries right you know it just
[36:11] you name the
[36:12] sins we can see plainly but very few
[36:17] people in churches can see that they're
[36:19] not continuing in the goodness of
[36:21] God right God gives you Grace so then
[36:24] you can serve him uh respectfully the
[36:26] Bible says in Godly fear all the days of
[36:29] your life praise
[36:31] God but then people mistreat Grace they
[36:34] they do despite the spirit of Grace as
[36:36] Hebrew says and so the severity of God
[36:40] will fall on
[36:41] them okay in other words brother man
[36:43] says Grace if you you mistreat it it
[36:45] becomes
[36:46] disgrace it's a disgrace to have a woman
[36:49] married woman in a church disgrace it's
[36:52] absolute
[36:53] Abomination right but they they they
[36:56] can't see it they're blinded by their
[36:58] own
[36:59] sin but don't forget the goodness and
[37:02] the severity of
[37:04] God hallelujah and if you continue in
[37:07] the goodness of God remember the
[37:08] goodness of God leads you to what
[37:09] repentance Amen in other words if you
[37:11] continue repenting amen and following
[37:14] God's will he will bless you Hallelujah
[37:16] he'll bless us we got to continue in
[37:19] that constant repentance and loving God
[37:22] blessing God praising God Amen verse 23
[37:26] and and they also if they by not still
[37:28] in unbelief shall be grafted in for God
[37:31] is able to graft them in again that's
[37:35] something God can cut off a a branch and
[37:38] then God can keep it alive just like
[37:39] that Rod that budded in in the holiest
[37:42] of holies hallelujah praise God no doubt
[37:45] that Rod was dead and old and it and and
[37:48] in the natural Lydia would know in the
[37:50] natural that branch is so old you
[37:51] couldn't graft it in it's been too long
[37:54] but nothing is too hard for God Amen
[37:57] amen amen hallelujah Let It Be an
[37:59] encouragement just like Abraham and
[38:01] Sarah they were so far you know being
[38:04] able to procreate and have children but
[38:06] nothing is too hard for God
[38:08] hallelujah he can grab them back in he
[38:11] can bring life back into their bodies
[38:13] and they can bring forth an Isaac
[38:14] hallelujah
[38:16] amen
[38:19] glory now he
[38:22] says verse 24 for if thou W cut out of
[38:26] the Olive Tree which is wild by nature
[38:28] and were grafted contrary to Nature into
[38:31] a good Olive Tree how much more shall
[38:34] these which be the natural branches be
[38:36] grafted into their own Olive Tree so
[38:38] other words the tree didn't match our
[38:40] nature as
[38:42] Gentiles Gentiles were not Gentiles were
[38:44] not holy
[38:45] people right just look just look at the
[38:48] opposite of Israel right look at the
[38:50] amorites the the Philistines you know
[38:53] look at all their look at all their
[38:55] idolatry and if you didn't know I just
[38:57] put a a video out today about I just had
[38:58] a few extra minutes I put out a video
[38:59] about
[39:00] gluttony brother Ram said the sin of
[39:02] gluttony is repeating today right
[39:05] because uh the Bible said they were
[39:06] eating and drinking right giving in
[39:08] marriage and marrying Hallelujah that's
[39:10] one Idol people have like I told you we
[39:12] had three preachers tell us that that's
[39:14] the idol they struggle with well I trust
[39:16] God will help them by God's grace the
[39:18] first step is recognizing you got a
[39:20] problem that's the first step Hallelujah
[39:22] whatever sin it is right don't hide your
[39:25] sin confess your sin to God
[39:28] Hallelujah that's right now so we we
[39:31] were grafted into a holy tree but
[39:34] Gentiles were not
[39:35] Holy Verse 25 here's where we really get
[39:38] down to the the final uh final part of
[39:41] the the chapter here the the real I
[39:43] think this is the most important
[39:44] scripture right here for I would not
[39:46] Brethren that you should be ignorant of
[39:47] this mystery this is a mystery I've been
[39:49] preaching a mystery this whole chapter
[39:50] anybody realize
[39:52] that it's a mystery this whole chapter
[39:54] is a mystery Israel's blindness right
[39:57] hold chapter two in my book I already
[39:59] preached it to you three years ago um
[40:02] lest you should be wise in your own
[40:05] conceits okay so don't be don't be
[40:07] ignorant uh try to make yourself wise
[40:10] blindness is happened to Israel until
[40:12] the fullness of the Gentiles become
[40:16] in okay so God is going to keep Israel
[40:18] blind until the last Gentile gets the
[40:21] holy ghost or gets saved amen right wise
[40:24] and foolish right so that's how we know
[40:27] and remember the Bible
[40:29] said uh the Bible said the time must be
[40:32] shortened so that somebody's even
[40:35] saved so think about when chrisan think
[40:37] about when you and I came in the message
[40:38] you know there was lots of people being
[40:40] baptized well now there's less and less
[40:41] and less I heard I heard a story from
[40:43] brother Donnie years ago he said he used
[40:45] to go to Africa and they would have you
[40:46] know tent meetings and revivals they'd
[40:48] sometimes baptize hundreds of people he
[40:50] said the last time he went back they
[40:51] baptized five and they've got thousands
[40:54] maybe 5 10 thousand people so each even
[40:57] everybody can see we're dwindling down
[40:59] we're getting to the final people being
[41:01] saved by God's grace now we don't know
[41:04] the last one right we don't
[41:07] know but thank God people are being
[41:09] saved hallelujah amen amen let's not
[41:13] remember again don't be prideful right
[41:15] we can't be prideful we got to continue
[41:17] in God's grace Hallelujah continue in
[41:20] God's goodness God's been good to me
[41:21] praise God I'm going to keep his
[41:23] commands
[41:25] Hallelujah this this is a gift to be
[41:28] saved this is a gift to have the message
[41:30] of the hour this is a blessing to have
[41:32] the Revelation that we have hallelujah
[41:35] amen now verse 26 and so all Israel
[41:39] shall be saved as is written there shall
[41:41] come out of Zion the deliverer and shall
[41:43] turn away ungodliness from Jacob of
[41:46] course that's speaking of Christ when
[41:48] Christ returns now he means all Israel
[41:51] all the
[41:53] elect right and we know that number
[41:56] 144,000
[41:58] okay so that's what he's talking about
[41:59] he's talking about all the elect that
[42:01] want to believe that election the called
[42:04] out group that will trust in God now
[42:07] verse 27 for this is my Covenant unto
[42:10] them when I shall take away their
[42:12] sins as concerning the gospel they are
[42:15] enemies for your sakes so see most most
[42:19] Jews that are sinners are enemies right
[42:21] they're enemies of the Cross but as
[42:23] touching the election they are beloved
[42:25] for the father's sake and then we just
[42:27] see that wasn't on The Daily wire wasn't
[42:28] there a Jew and a Christian what and
[42:31] they fired the Christian if I'm not
[42:32] mistaken remember that see they're
[42:34] enemies I think the Christian said
[42:36] Christ is
[42:38] King and then the Jew fired the
[42:40] Christian if I'm not mistaken something
[42:42] related to religion that's at least what
[42:45] the the rumor
[42:47] was by God's grace but they're enemies
[42:50] right I mean think about it it's
[42:52] offensive to anybody if I said there's
[42:54] only one way to eternal life what if
[42:56] you're talking to a Muslim
[42:58] what if you're talking to a Jew that's
[42:59] well am I going to hell then am I going
[43:01] to hell then you see how it's it's
[43:03] offensive but Jesus said I'm the way the
[43:06] truth and the life no man comes into the
[43:08] father but by me Hallelujah now the Jews
[43:12] are different they can be blinded
[43:13] because they still got a covenant with
[43:15] God Muslims
[43:17] don't right that's why it's really
[43:19] that's why Jesus has has to appear to
[43:20] some of the Muslims to save th the
[43:22] elected ones
[43:25] Hallelujah now verse 28 as concerning
[43:29] the gospel they are enemies for your
[43:30] sakes he says but as touching the
[43:32] election they are beloved for the
[43:35] father's sakes amen so these 144,000 are
[43:40] beloved unto God in other words God
[43:42] loves how they're trying to get that red
[43:44] heer ready to sacrifice now we don't
[43:47] know they're saying they might sacrifice
[43:48] it on April 22nd that's only what 12
[43:50] days
[43:51] away
[43:53] my and that's an anticipation of a re
[43:57] Temple and the Messiah coming back think
[43:59] about
[44:01] that my goodness look at and remember
[44:04] they got all the they got all the
[44:05] garments for the high priest the priests
[44:07] the Levites they uh I saw it too they
[44:11] they have all the uh uh all the
[44:13] instruments you know to to kill the the
[44:15] bulock to to to collect the blood and
[44:18] sprinkle the blood they have all the
[44:20] instruments they've spent decades
[44:22] getting this
[44:23] ready they got all the colors from all
[44:25] the animals where the Bible says you got
[44:26] to get the the purple from these these
[44:28] sea creatures you got to get the purple
[44:30] and red from these sea creatures they
[44:31] went and did that and God looks down and
[44:34] said they're my beloved Hallelujah in
[44:36] other words they they'll honor my word
[44:39] they want to keep the word of God they
[44:40] want to be grafted back into the Holy
[44:43] Spirit hallelujah amen and here we sit
[44:46] we we're grafted into the Holy Spirit
[44:48] God help us to take advantage of the
[44:49] grace that's given to us amen that's
[44:52] what we are doing tonight
[44:55] Hallelujah we are grafted into it by the
[44:58] grace of God now verse 29 for the gifts
[45:03] and calling of God are without
[45:05] repentance we use this many times just
[45:07] for gifts in people's life but it it
[45:09] certainly applies to the Jews and the
[45:12] Gentiles right in other words God has
[45:15] given us the gift of Grace right now the
[45:17] Gentile dispensation and that's without
[45:20] repentance God ain't going to change
[45:21] that that was God's Great purpose right
[45:24] he gave Israel 1500 years they stumbled
[45:27] at it so he blinds them he said I'll
[45:29] give these people a chance and he said
[45:31] I'm calling them my beloved amen hey
[45:34] this is my beloved we read it in chapter
[45:35] nine remember Romans nine from Hosea I'm
[45:38] going to call the people beloved that
[45:40] were not beloved I'm going to call a
[45:42] group my people which were not my people
[45:44] we are God's people and we're God's
[45:46] beloved hallelujah amen no matter what
[45:48] happens in our lives amen amen like I
[45:51] was even praying today while I was
[45:52] singing I was like oh my and I I've said
[45:54] this before if God doesn't do one more
[45:56] great thing for me he's still done so
[45:57] much for me that I'd still serve him and
[45:59] praise Him Hallelujah he's still worthy
[46:02] he's still worthy of it all Hallelujah
[46:05] because he's been good to me he's been
[46:06] so gracious
[46:07] merciful the gifts and calling of God
[46:10] are without repentance God will not take
[46:12] it
[46:13] back verse 30 for as ye in times past
[46:16] have not believed God yet have now
[46:18] obtained Mercy through their
[46:21] unbelief even so have these also now not
[46:24] believed that through your mercy they
[46:27] shall obtain Mercy
[46:30] Hallelujah so Israel didn't believe so
[46:32] we could believe but then the Gentiles
[46:34] are going to not believe at the end
[46:36] talking about the Sinners so that the
[46:38] Jews can then believe again in other
[46:40] words God gives God gave all the Jews a
[46:42] chance to accept Christ and now God's
[46:44] given all the Gentiles a chance to
[46:46] accept Christ then he's going back to
[46:47] the Jews that's Grace that's Grace right
[46:51] there Hallelujah giving everybody a
[46:53] chance to hear this message remember
[46:55] Jesus said Matthew 25 14 let me read
[46:57] that fresh to your hearts this is the
[47:00] only explanation I believe is Mak sense
[47:02] of why the Rapture hasn't
[47:05] happened you might have your thought you
[47:07] know this is just my humble thought here
[47:09] and this Gospel of the Kingdom must or
[47:11] shall be preached in all the world for a
[47:13] witness unto all nations and then the
[47:15] end shall come why hasn't the Rapture
[47:18] happened because not every nation has
[47:19] heard the message of Jesus Christ I'm
[47:23] talking about this message the water
[47:25] baptism the Holy Ghost right they got to
[47:27] have a chance to hear
[47:28] it didn't Jesus have to send his two his
[47:32] disciples two by two to each one of
[47:33] those
[47:35] cities right didn't he have to do that
[47:38] yes they all deserved a chance to hear
[47:40] remember Simon said he think they found
[47:42] the first message believer in Thailand
[47:44] the
[47:46] first not not the H hundredth the
[47:50] first doesn't that Nation don't those
[47:53] millions of people deserve a chance to
[47:54] hear the
[47:55] message absolutely
[47:57] absolutely right so God's going to be
[47:59] gracious God's going to be merciful
[48:01] don't get PR we can't get prideful we
[48:03] got to stay humble and keep trying to
[48:05] give people a chance to hear the gospel
[48:08] now it's easy for us now because we got
[48:09] internet praise God but for the
[48:11] preachers that need to go we need to
[48:13] help them praise God so I'm going to
[48:15] keep my ears open next time Simon wants
[48:16] to go or somebody else wants to go we
[48:18] got to try to support them a little bit
[48:19] that we can Hallelujah we've done that
[48:22] over the years like we helped Ben NAD
[48:23] last time he went um some other people
[48:27] too I can't think of them right now it's
[48:28] been a while remember because the co
[48:30] kind of shut things down for a while
[48:32] we've helped send preachers to take the
[48:34] gospel Hallelujah even if they're doing
[48:36] just Evangelical work they can still win
[48:38] Souls praise
[48:39] God now thank you for your patience here
[48:43] almost done by God's
[48:46] grace all right verse 32 for God hath
[48:49] concluded them all in unbelief that me
[48:52] he might have mercy upon all praise God
[48:56] God Hallelujah in other words God the
[48:58] Bible says remember earlier in Romans
[49:00] chapter 323 for all have sinned and
[49:03] fallen short of the glory of God
[49:05] hallelujah other words God knows
[49:07] everybody's going to sin so God has to
[49:09] have mercy on everybody praise God and
[49:11] thank God he prayed for he paid for that
[49:13] on the cross Hallelujah he paid for the
[49:16] sins of the whole world Hallelujah on
[49:18] the cross because all were in unbelief
[49:21] Hallelujah so he had to have mercy on
[49:23] all of
[49:25] us verse 30 33 oh now here's how Paul
[49:28] responds Paul imagine Paul writing this
[49:30] and he gets to the end of the chapter
[49:31] he's like
[49:33] oh the depth of the riches both of the
[49:36] wisdom and knowledge of God have you
[49:39] ever left a sermon or a song special and
[49:41] thought oh my that was so wonderful what
[49:43] a deep Revelation from God we've had
[49:45] some anybody had some lately walked out
[49:49] how many when brother digs here walked
[49:50] out here like wow that was so refreshing
[49:52] oh God's grace and mercy he told me he
[49:54] said brother Jesse I didn't get any of
[49:55] that from my notes that was all you guys
[49:57] pulling on
[49:59] me he said I could not have studied for
[50:01] that he said you guys pulled that out of
[50:04] me he said your church is says more
[50:07] amens than a church that's a mega church
[50:09] he preaches at mega church he says he he
[50:11] got more amens out of our church than
[50:13] mega churches in the
[50:15] message Hallelujah now don't get don't
[50:17] don't get prideful now fear God
[50:20] remember fear God respect God honor
[50:25] God but here Paul finishes as he writes
[50:28] the mystery wow this one stumbled so
[50:30] this one could go on this one was caught
[50:31] off so this one could be put
[50:33] in and then Paul says oh the depths of
[50:36] the goodness of graciousness of
[50:39] God how unsearchable are his judgments
[50:42] and his ways past finding out who would
[50:45] have thought God would have let this
[50:46] people he would have let the gospel come
[50:48] for let the law come for 1500 years
[50:51] until the very last person would believe
[50:53] and then because they rejected Christ
[50:55] then you know in other words he would he
[50:57] would get a bride for for Christ and
[50:59] then when they would reject him he would
[51:01] get a bride from the
[51:03] Gentiles Hallelujah and then go back and
[51:06] get what the Bible calls uh Unix the
[51:08] Bible calls 144,000 Unix not the bride
[51:12] but
[51:13] Unix he had a he gave Israel a chance to
[51:15] be bride but because they rejected it he
[51:17] gets a bride amen and then after that
[51:20] after he gets his bride then he gets
[51:22] some Unix for heaven hallelujah praise
[51:24] God oh my that's powerful he said oh The
[51:28] Depths and the riches of the wisdom and
[51:30] knowledge of
[51:32] God for who hath known the mind of the
[51:34] Lord or who hath been his counselor
[51:37] right like uh brother raham always
[51:39] talked about
[51:40] this brother raham said if I was God he
[51:43] said and I sent my word to somebody in
[51:46] the book and they didn't believe it
[51:47] brother M said if I was God I'd probably
[51:49] be done with them he said but God is
[51:51] more gracious than humans are like if
[51:53] you send a letter to somebody and said
[51:55] hey would you repent and get baptized
[51:56] and they threw it in the trash what
[51:58] would you do you'd probably like okay
[51:59] I'm done I wash my hands with that I'm
[52:00] done but brother Adam said but God goes
[52:03] beyond that if they won't receive the
[52:05] written word he said then it'll send
[52:06] them
[52:08] angels and then brother said if they
[52:10] won't receive the Angels then I'll send
[52:11] my gifts my nine gifts of the Holy
[52:13] Spirit and then he said if they won't
[52:15] receive that I'll send them five
[52:16] preaching gifts Amen brother R was
[52:19] saying God Is So merciful god goes to
[52:21] extra lengths oh The Depths and the
[52:23] riches of the knowledge of God
[52:25] hallelujah amen think about how God is
[52:27] gracious in this hour God sent us
[52:29] William brandham with thus sayith the
[52:31] Lord and discernment gifts to tell
[52:33] people the thoughts and intents of their
[52:35] heart and point us back to the Bible we
[52:37] should be so grateful oh The Depths and
[52:40] Riches of God to us hallelujah we could
[52:42] be in denominations or the we could be
[52:44] in the Catholic Church worshiping a
[52:46] wafer but here we are worshiping God
[52:48] Almighty hallelujah amen The Depths and
[52:51] Riches of God
[52:54] hallelujah and each time it was God
[52:56] Grace coming to us we didn't go looking
[52:59] for it God came looking for us
[53:01] hallelujah amen undeserving Hallelujah
[53:04] he had mercy on all of us praise God The
[53:07] Depths and the riches and the wisdom of
[53:12] God who's known the mind of
[53:15] God or who have been his
[53:19] counselor a lot of people thought the
[53:21] mind of God was the Rapture was going to
[53:22] take place on Monday at the
[53:25] eclipse you what they're saying now is
[53:27] well now we got 40 days I think it's May
[53:29] 19th they got 40 days from the eclipse
[53:31] America can still repent well I'm sorry
[53:34] if you missed it on that one you're
[53:35] probably going to miss it on this one
[53:38] too
[53:40] right you
[53:41] know I'm glad I preached that beforehand
[53:45] Hallelujah by God's grace because it
[53:48] just again proves we got to look to the
[53:49] scripture for all of our
[53:51] answers look to every scripture for the
[53:54] answers like the one thing they were
[53:55] saying the there was you know when when
[53:57] that
[53:59] uh when that eclip Eclipse came in 2017
[54:02] there was there was seven cities that
[54:04] were
[54:05] Salem uh and that means Jerusalem which
[54:07] means peace and so that means uh God was
[54:09] offering peace to us seven times to
[54:12] America what does that
[54:14] mean what what does that mean and then
[54:17] you know this time in 2024 there was
[54:19] Seven Cities supposedly um that were
[54:22] called Nineveh and now God's offering us
[54:24] repentance and mercy
[54:27] what does that mean what do you mean we
[54:29] who accepted God's peace or did we
[54:31] accept God's peace or not in 2017 did we
[54:33] or
[54:34] not it just got worse since 2017
[54:38] right and then now uh you know Nineveh
[54:42] who and what did they do in Nineveh
[54:43] Church they fasted they ripped their
[54:45] clothes and they got in ashes where has
[54:47] one American done that yet they haven't
[54:50] they just go about their regular lives
[54:53] that doesn't make any sense it wasn't in
[54:55] the Bible praise God now we we had we we
[54:58] could have been so sure because brother
[54:59] Ram said it's thus sayith the Lord
[55:01] America already had her last chance in
[55:04] 56 50 years after the isusa Street
[55:07] Revival in
[55:08] 1906 50 years
[55:10] Jubilee she already had her chance right
[55:14] that's how sure we can be by God's
[55:18] grace hallelujah what a blessing that we
[55:20] can be sure oh who can know the mind of
[55:24] the Lord who ha been God's C well God
[55:26] you should have done this and you you
[55:28] know here's how you should do it no no
[55:30] no let's let God do it praise God let's
[55:33] let God do it however he wants to do it
[55:35] verse 35 or who hath first given to him
[55:38] and it shall not be recompensed unto him
[55:41] again right who is who's somebody that
[55:44] first gave God something nobody God gave
[55:48] us life amen and then we can take the
[55:51] other side the Bible said when you give
[55:53] to God you lend to the Lord who is God
[55:55] not repay paid
[55:57] back who's God not paid back anybody
[56:01] paid a tie or offering or Special Love
[56:03] offering and God didn't pay you
[56:05] back I'll just say like this week I've
[56:08] I've lost very little compared to what
[56:09] God's given
[56:11] me by Grace Just gifts just gifts God
[56:16] has been so gracious I mean by looking
[56:18] over the course of these last few years
[56:19] I mean God is just he he's a way more
[56:22] giver than we
[56:23] are Hallelujah of course of course he is
[56:25] he's Eternal he's perfect amen he's way
[56:29] more gracious and then the Bible said in
[56:30] Psalms he's not punished us after all of
[56:33] our sins either amen he's blessed us
[56:36] beyond what we deserve and punished us
[56:38] less than what we
[56:40] deserve that's amazing grace that's
[56:43] favor that's an unmar favor from
[56:47] God who's given to God where God doesn't
[56:50] give it back to him oh yeah I just read
[56:53] Malachi 2
[56:54] today God said return unto me and I'll
[56:58] return unto you and they said how do we
[57:00] return He said in your tithes and
[57:02] offerings youve Rob God now that doesn't
[57:06] impact us but look I'm talking about the
[57:07] nation look at the
[57:09] nation these preachers will get up there
[57:11] and and they'll blast like tithing like
[57:13] it's some sin I mean if you're against
[57:17] tithing just be happy the person's given
[57:18] 10% Like how much do you
[57:21] give they probably don't even give him
[57:23] 2% you know like why why black that now
[57:27] you should blast it when people say it
[57:28] makes you
[57:29] righteous because you don't have any
[57:31] righteousness of your own we just read
[57:34] that in the Bible right in Romans your
[57:37] our righteousness comes from Christ amen
[57:40] right but it's this idea of just being
[57:42] generous because God loves a cheerful
[57:45] Giver
[57:46] Hallelujah ah verse 36 for of him and
[57:50] through him and to him are all things to
[57:52] whom be glory forever
[57:55] amen so of God is all things everything
[57:58] we get is from God through God is All
[58:03] Things praise God and to God are all
[58:08] things of from
[58:11] to so what wherever the wherever the
[58:14] blessing is going whether it's coming to
[58:15] you or whether it's going out from you
[58:17] it's all going back to God it's God's
[58:21] giving it all out and it's all coming
[58:22] back to him in other words he sees all
[58:25] your your sacrif he's going to give it
[58:27] right back praise
[58:29] God hallelujah now in closing said all
[58:36] that now in my book there I just want to
[58:39] close with this because I forgot this
[58:40] thought I was looking through here right
[58:41] before
[58:42] service there's six evidences in there
[58:45] that even blinded Jews can be
[58:48] saved okay one of them is Paul's
[58:50] teaching in this chapter Paul said
[58:52] blinded is israels Israelis are not
[58:55] forsaken for all time they're not
[58:58] forsaken um spiritual blindness is only
[59:02] temporary it's not permanent because God
[59:03] will graft them in
[59:06] again and it's and that blindness is
[59:08] only on part of Israel now it's the
[59:10] majority but there's a small minority
[59:12] that is called The
[59:14] Remnant so God didn't blind all Israel
[59:18] most of it but not all he still got a
[59:21] believing remant today
[59:24] Hallelujah so that's the first proof the
[59:26] second proof is Jesus's prayer on the
[59:28] cross he said father forgive them they
[59:31] don't know what they were
[59:33] doing so people can blaspheme like Paul
[59:35] people can blaspheme Jesus and they
[59:37] didn't even know what they were doing
[59:39] and Jesus will forgive them Hallelujah
[59:43] the third one just real quick
[59:46] foreshadowing in the life of
[59:49] Jesus I'm sorry life of Joseph Joseph
[59:52] forgave his brothers did they deserve it
[59:55] no they they were blinded to what God
[59:57] was doing amen hallelujah they were
[59:59] blinded it was God was LE God was
[1:00:02] allowing them to throw Joseph in the pit
[1:00:04] and take him off to Egypt to save life
[1:00:08] Hallelujah God blinded the Jews so he
[1:00:10] could save our lives amen but God's
[1:00:13] going to graft them back in at the end
[1:00:15] hallelujah amen where did I get these
[1:00:17] wounds from the house of my friends but
[1:00:19] I still love you let me give you a
[1:00:21] change of garment let me give you the
[1:00:23] Holy Ghost Hallelujah let me give you
[1:00:25] 100 44,000 the Holy Ghost I'll change
[1:00:28] your garments amen like William gives us
[1:00:30] all these clothes from Ghana he gives
[1:00:33] these and so does beatric and they give
[1:00:35] us all these clothes a change of
[1:00:37] clothing a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:39] praise
[1:00:40] God the fifth one is the fifth
[1:00:45] seal the fifth seal proves Hallelujah
[1:00:48] the fifth seal proves God Saves blinded
[1:00:52] Israel now this was a just an
[1:00:54] interesting fresh thought that came to
[1:00:55] me off was prepared you know we talk
[1:00:58] about church after we die we won't have
[1:00:59] to pray anymore
[1:01:01] right we won't have to pray that's
[1:01:04] because we got the Holy
[1:01:05] Ghost but did you catch that in the
[1:01:08] fifth seal the blinded Jews were crying
[1:01:11] out to God they were still interceding
[1:01:13] for God think about that they cried out
[1:01:16] in life and they cry out in
[1:01:19] death think about that they they're
[1:01:21] still praying they're still praying now
[1:01:24] the Jews that were mared in the Hol of
[1:01:26] brother said every Jew that was killed
[1:01:27] since the time of Jesus is under the
[1:01:29] altar saying Lord how long holy and true
[1:01:32] Dost thou not judge our righteous blood
[1:01:34] they're still praying even in
[1:01:36] heaven amazing and does God ignore them
[1:01:39] no Jesus answers back and said wait a
[1:01:42] little season the rest of your brethren
[1:01:44] must be martyred as well and then you'll
[1:01:46] get brand new bodies Hallelujah then
[1:01:47] you'll get new white robes by the grace
[1:01:49] of God they're praying in heaven and
[1:01:52] they're in heaven Hallelujah but for us
[1:01:55] when we die we won't be praying in
[1:01:56] heaven we'll be praising in heaven
[1:01:58] hallelujah praise God
[1:02:00] hallelujah remember the 24 Elders they
[1:02:02] sing the songs right and they they sing
[1:02:05] songs that say thank God he's redeemed
[1:02:07] Us by his blood out of every Kindred T
[1:02:10] tribe nation and tongue hallelujah thank
[1:02:12] God he grafted us into the holy tree
[1:02:14] praise God oh my just interesting
[1:02:18] thought there blinded Jews are still
[1:02:21] praying now their prayers don't
[1:02:24] end and
[1:02:27] lastly um no I'm sorry fifth God's
[1:02:30] righteous judgment based upon your
[1:02:32] knowledge so the Bible is clear God
[1:02:34] judges everyone based upon what they
[1:02:36] knew right so God will judge a blinded
[1:02:40] group based upon what they saw what they
[1:02:42] saw spiritually they can't see
[1:02:44] spiritually there's my hour but God God
[1:02:47] will only judge someone based upon what
[1:02:49] they knew not what they didn't
[1:02:51] know right and that goes for every
[1:02:53] person that's right because the Bible
[1:02:56] said the word of God remember in Romans
[1:02:57] 1 and2 Romans 1 and two we're judged
[1:02:59] there's no excuse on the day of judgment
[1:03:01] because the the law of God is written in
[1:03:03] every heart and in other words every
[1:03:05] every person knows right from wrong and
[1:03:07] they'll be judged by what they know all
[1:03:10] right and then the last one was God's
[1:03:12] covenant with Israel through
[1:03:16] Abraham that Covenant still stands
[1:03:18] Hallelujah remember there's remember
[1:03:20] there's eight covenants and each
[1:03:22] Covenant stays intact remember that
[1:03:27] uh let me try to see if I can name them
[1:03:28] I I don't know if I can name them right
[1:03:29] now but edenic Covenant the adamic
[1:03:32] Covenant the noic Covenant Noah
[1:03:35] abrahamic Covenant the Mosaic Covenant
[1:03:38] Glory I'm feeling good now the davidic
[1:03:40] Covenant Hallelujah the New Covenant and
[1:03:43] then the Eternal Covenant I got them all
[1:03:45] amen wow hallelujah praise God I didn't
[1:03:47] expect that amen I guess if you write it
[1:03:49] though you might remember it spend out
[1:03:51] that time writing but notice we're in
[1:03:54] other words we're still enjoying the
[1:03:55] benefits of Noah's Covenant amen God's
[1:03:58] never going to flood the Earth again
[1:04:00] Glory praise
[1:04:01] God right we're still enjoy we're still
[1:04:04] enjoying the Covenant of Abraham because
[1:04:06] we're blessed all those who bless us are
[1:04:08] blessed Hallelujah and no man can curse
[1:04:11] us hallelujah though they can steal from
[1:04:13] us they can't curse us hallelujah you
[1:04:15] know why I'm preaching
[1:04:16] that they can steal from you but they
[1:04:18] can't curse you
[1:04:20] Hallelujah I I have a feeling God will
[1:04:23] God will uh make them answer Hallelujah
[1:04:25] either in this life or the next because
[1:04:28] what you did to the least of these my
[1:04:29] brethren you did it unto me and that's
[1:04:31] in the negative sense but God blesses it
[1:04:34] in the natural
[1:04:35] sense but see we're still we're still
[1:04:37] benefiting from the no noic Covenant and
[1:04:40] the div I'm sorry and the uh uh
[1:04:42] abrahamic Covenant well that means if
[1:04:44] Israel turned down the New Covenant
[1:04:47] which was writing it on the fleshly
[1:04:48] tables of our hearts that means they are
[1:04:50] still going to be judged by the Mosaic
[1:04:53] Covenant and the davidic Covenant
[1:04:55] David's Covenant
[1:04:56] does everybody catch that by God's grace
[1:04:59] so there's six proof I'm sorry there's
[1:05:00] six proofs right there that they can
[1:05:02] still be saved even though they're
[1:05:05] blinded how many know that God doesn't
[1:05:07] leave himself without a
[1:05:10] witness couple more verses here I know
[1:05:12] got to go a little bit longer here but
[1:05:14] just a little
[1:05:16] bit um this this this came to me while I
[1:05:19] was studying there Hebrews 13 12 I'm
[1:05:22] sorry Hebrews 3:12 sorry Hebrews 3 Trace
[1:05:26] Hebrews 3:12 chapter 3 take heed
[1:05:29] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[1:05:30] evil heart of unbelief what did we just
[1:05:32] read the Gentiles will keep the goodness
[1:05:34] of God unless they have an evil heart of
[1:05:37] unbelief
[1:05:38] right in departing from the Living God
[1:05:42] see that that should be our desire we
[1:05:43] should have in our hearts I'm never
[1:05:44] going to leave the truth I will always
[1:05:47] serve God I've just got to endure my
[1:05:49] test and trials amen I just got to make
[1:05:51] it through
[1:05:53] Hallelujah I just got to crush this wave
[1:05:55] and wait till until this wave crosses
[1:05:56] over Hallelujah I just have to make it
[1:05:58] through this Valley of the shadow of
[1:05:59] death I know another Mountaintop is
[1:06:01] coming
[1:06:02] hallelujah praise God next verse verse
[1:06:06] 13 take heed uh now
[1:06:10] 13 but exhort one another now that means
[1:06:13] encourage encourage one another daily
[1:06:16] now this is what I was thinking maybe
[1:06:17] trying to send like a daily I don't know
[1:06:18] if I can keep this up
[1:06:20] but the Bible said we should encourage
[1:06:22] each other every single day right now of
[1:06:25] course they didn't have cell phones in
[1:06:26] those days right so it meant they would
[1:06:28] encourage themselves every day that they
[1:06:30] saw each other or their families would
[1:06:31] encourage each other their you know the
[1:06:34] Believers that were with them in other
[1:06:35] words we don't want to spend our days
[1:06:37] discouraging each other's
[1:06:39] Faith every time we see each other we
[1:06:41] want to encourage
[1:06:43] them
[1:06:44] right exhort one another daily while
[1:06:47] it's called today lest any of you be
[1:06:49] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:06:50] sin now we get a good we get a good
[1:06:51] lesson in here if we encourage people
[1:06:54] they're going to say off for
[1:06:57] God right but if we're uh if we don't if
[1:07:01] we discourage them they're going to get
[1:07:02] hard on
[1:07:04] God see that that's why we got to be so
[1:07:07] kind and anytime you see now we don't
[1:07:09] want to overlook sin but any time we see
[1:07:12] something good and positive we want to
[1:07:13] encourage somebody like that Mal I
[1:07:16] really enjoyed that plane today boy that
[1:07:17] was awesome and it's his mind he might
[1:07:19] be saying well I missed that note and I
[1:07:20] missed that note and I heard that and I
[1:07:21] heard that but man it was so wonderful
[1:07:24] you did a great job I so proud I love
[1:07:26] that song I I love how you did
[1:07:28] that right find something to encourage
[1:07:30] somebody about encourage them because
[1:07:33] there's a lot of discouragement in the
[1:07:36] world
[1:07:39] right no wonder brother Bram said every
[1:07:41] time I go and feel a little blue I go
[1:07:42] turn to Romans chapter 4 19 and 20
[1:07:46] Abraham was strong in faith he didn't
[1:07:47] stagger at the promise of God he gave
[1:07:50] God Glory
[1:07:52] Hallelujah I don't stagger at the
[1:07:54] promise of God I don't forsake God I
[1:07:56] don't abandon God I keep giving God
[1:07:57] praise
[1:07:59] hallelujah
[1:08:02] amen so see there's a great testimony
[1:08:05] there a great lesson right there church
[1:08:06] let's keep encouraging one another in
[1:08:08] the word of
[1:08:09] God let's be kind to each other let's

[1:08:23] part if we hold the beginning of our

[1:10:15] verse4 and as they went through the
[1:10:17] cities they delivered them the decrees
[1:10:19] for to keep that were ordained to the
[1:10:21] apostles and Elders which were at
[1:10:22] Jerusalem and so the churches were
[1:10:24] established in the the faith and
[1:10:26] increase in number daily the word

[1:11:53] severity of God we get the goodness of
[1:11:56] God Israel at the time they rejected
[1:11:59] Jesus on the cross they got severity
[1:12:01] they got at the Holocaust severity
[1:12:04] severe chastisement but we get the
[1:12:07] goodness of God
[1:12:09] hallelujah that's why I don't believe
[1:12:10] we're going to be hunted down for the
[1:12:12] you I necessarily don't believe we'll be
[1:12:13] hunted down for the Rapture or have to
[1:12:16] just to me it seems like God would be
[1:12:17] gracious to us that's that's what I'm
[1:12:19] leaning for I'm hoping for by God's
[1:12:20] grace everybody understand I'm not
[1:12:22] prophesying but if we you know if we get
[1:12:25] the goodness of God then I would expect
[1:12:26] God to be gracious to us hallelujah but
[1:12:29] even if we get severity even if there's
[1:12:31] a test or persec we won't get severity
[1:12:33] even if we get tested or tried very hard
[1:12:35] then we can say like job the Lord gives
[1:12:37] and the Lord takes away but blessed be
[1:12:39] the name of the Lord we can be like the
[1:12:41] three Hebrew children do whatever you
[1:12:42] want King we we will not bow to
[1:12:46] idolatry we won't bow down to the devil
[1:12:48] and worship Satan in this hour we'll
[1:12:51] keep singing the praise of
[1:12:54] God acts 18:23 and after he had spent
[1:12:57] some time there he departed and went all
