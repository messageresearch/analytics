[6:45] Grace God bless you as we stand let's go
[6:47] to First Kings chapter three I'd like to
[6:49] speak on part two of leadership here
[6:51] tonight
[6:58] you know Sunday was a wonderful day of
[7:00] course and I think the message was
[7:02] really timely you know we had a visitor
[7:04] we had visitors Wednesday I'm sorry
[7:06] Sunday
[7:08] um
[7:09] and one of the visitors course was
[7:12] they've just been needing uh they've
[7:14] been wondering about the leadership you
[7:16] know of the Holy Spirit
[7:18] and so it was very timely message I
[7:20] couldn't you if we're live stream I
[7:22] shouldn't say much more but it was a
[7:23] very timely message
[7:25] I didn't know we were going to have
[7:27] visitors you know and we missed you guys
[7:28] my God it's very glad Austin he's doing
[7:30] better
[7:31] but it's a very timely message I could
[7:32] see how God's hand was in it I really
[7:34] could
[7:34] thankful to that for that by God's grace
[7:38] and let's go to First Kings chapter
[7:39] three I'd like to look again at
[7:41] Solomon's Prayer this is the prayer that
[7:42] God loved
[7:49] and so we'll be looking here first Kings
[7:51] 3 verse 7.
[8:03] we'll read seven eight nine and ten
[8:09] why don't we uh why don't we just read
[8:11] seven together Acacia and then I'll read
[8:13] 8 9
[8:15] if you can leave them up there that'd be
[8:16] helpful
[8:21] First Kings 3 7-10
[8:30] let's read verse 7 together if we can
[8:33] ready one two three and now oh Lord my
[8:36] God thou Hast made thy servant King
[8:40] instead of David my father and I am but
[8:44] a little child I know not how to go out
[8:47] or come and look at the humility of
[8:49] Solomon here now remember when we read
[8:52] about David David the Bible said David
[8:53] led the men out and he led them in David
[8:56] was a man of war
[8:58] but Solomon is humble and he's honest
[9:01] he's like he's praying the Lord and he
[9:03] says Lord I don't know how to go out I
[9:05] don't know how to come in other words I
[9:07] don't have the experience of my father
[9:09] so he's offering a prayer in his
[9:11] weakness how many know we have to pray
[9:12] in our weakness
[9:14] and look God receives us in our weakness
[9:17] God's not God's not looking down upon us
[9:19] because we're weak or we're struggling
[9:21] God actually wants us to pray through
[9:23] our weakness right because our weakness
[9:25] what do we made are we are we made weak
[9:27] or strong in our weaknesses were made
[9:29] strong like Paul says
[9:30] now verse 8 I'll read eight nine and ten
[9:32] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[9:34] people which thou Hast chosen a great
[9:36] people that cannot be numbered nor
[9:38] counted for multitude give therefore thy
[9:40] servant an understanding heart to judge
[9:42] thy people that I may discern between
[9:45] good and bad for who is able to judge
[9:48] this thy so great a people
[9:51] and the speech please the Lord that
[9:53] Solomon had asked this thing
[9:55] amen let's have a word of prayer here
[9:56] that's what we have a need if you have
[9:58] I'm sorry if you have a need on your
[9:59] heart let's make an order to God you can
[10:00] lift your hands in prayer or just speak
[10:01] to God as we pray
[10:04] father God we're happy to be in your
[10:05] presence we're Children of the king
[10:07] hallelujah thank you for reminding us
[10:08] who we are Lord we were wretched and
[10:10] vile but Lord your blood has washed us
[10:12] and now we have your royal blood flowing
[10:14] through our veins we'd say in other
[10:16] words we have the Holy Ghost flowing
[10:18] through our minds Hallelujah Quicken our
[10:20] souls Lord God we're grateful for that
[10:21] Lord God we're Children of the king so
[10:23] anoint us here tonight Lord to get into
[10:25] the channel of the preaching of Thy word
[10:27] Lord speak your word to your people
[10:29] hallelujah and father we're just
[10:31] trusting you to minister Lord as we pray
[10:32] these prayers minister to brother amen
[10:34] and sister who God is we're we're
[10:36] looking for you to move on their behalf
[10:38] we know you're in the house and Lord we
[10:39] know you're in the hospital there so
[10:41] father just move in a special way Lord
[10:43] God bless these doctors guided I just
[10:45] pray God you do a great work for our
[10:47] brother Lord we speak life we speak
[10:48] healing we speak prosperity of Health
[10:51] Lord for our brother and we speak
[10:53] victory for our sister in the midst of
[10:55] this difficult season in Jesus Christ's
[10:57] name and the Saints said amen God bless
[10:59] you as you're being seated praise God
[11:05] I don't have any really slides today
[11:09] so we'll just preach off the notes Here
[11:11] by God's grace
[11:13] you know again I
[11:15] you know the last few messages have been
[11:17] as I told you Sunday was very timely for
[11:19] the visitors there
[11:21] and we'll just see we've been praying
[11:23] you've heard me put prayer requests in
[11:25] for the church right the other Church in
[11:27] Pennsylvania so it was related to to
[11:30] this situation so we're very thankful it
[11:32] was all ordained of God
[11:34] um
[11:35] I just stand amazed at God's grace you
[11:36] know just the way God will lead us to
[11:39] sing songs and preach and the prayers
[11:41] and everything it's just all that of the
[11:42] Lord and even with you know the
[11:44] situation with Brother amen's Health you
[11:45] know remember the Wednesday before this
[11:46] happened
[11:48] I went off the dancing series I thought
[11:50] and I even said beforehand this is
[11:51] really strange but I'm going to go back
[11:52] to this isolation and look at
[11:54] Temptations because God may be bringing
[11:56] us to Temptations
[11:58] and here we are and I even use the
[12:00] examples of Temptation in our flesh like
[12:02] just some of these the same exact things
[12:04] we see ourselves in now
[12:06] uh God brought us to this so the same
[12:09] God that brought us to us brought these
[12:11] trials to us is the same God who's going
[12:13] to bring us through the trials remember
[12:15] Church the same God that was had a hedge
[12:17] about us and we Rejoice rejoice in all
[12:18] those wonderful times the same God is
[12:20] with us here today praise God
[12:22] and so we've got to learn to give God a
[12:23] sacrifice of praise no matter the
[12:25] Temptations we're going through no
[12:27] matter the trials we're going through so
[12:28] we can clearly see the leadership of the
[12:30] Holy Spirit and that's kind of what
[12:32] we're looking at here tonight the
[12:33] leadership of the of the Lord praise God
[12:35] somebody preaching a few of these
[12:37] thoughts here
[12:39] from this book I've been reading a
[12:41] from Kevin Connor of course tying some
[12:44] scriptures and some quotes from God's
[12:46] prophet of course I put out the video
[12:48] today I don't know if you saw it I put
[12:49] out the video about
[12:51] there's these quotes brother Branham has
[12:53] you know he's being humble and he's
[12:55] saying
[12:56] uh he's saying there's a great one
[12:57] that's going to come after me and he's
[12:59] going to turn the hearts of the children
[13:01] to the fathers and
[13:03] and in some of those quotes brother
[13:04] Branham you know quotes Malachi 4 5 and
[13:07] 6.
[13:08] and so these quotes are from in fact all
[13:12] of them yeah all of them are before the
[13:14] seals which is interesting
[13:17] um and so you know some people take
[13:20] those quotes and they'll say the the
[13:21] preacher will rise up and say I'm the
[13:23] great one to come after brother Branham
[13:25] there's one in South Africa there's one
[13:26] in Germany
[13:28] there's people in America that do the
[13:29] same thing I'm the great one to come and
[13:31] you got to look to me for the revelation
[13:33] of the message so I put a I got an email
[13:35] about that last week and I just felt
[13:37] inspired I'm gonna make a video about
[13:38] this so I just put the video out today
[13:40] if that'd be a blessing you got to know
[13:42] if you know Naomi in your country I
[13:43] don't know if you have anybody that's
[13:44] you know battle with that like an eighth
[13:46] messenger or they would call themselves
[13:49] The Great one to come after brother
[13:50] Brown I don't know if you've had any
[13:51] experience with that but may be helpful
[13:53] you know to our church in some ways
[13:55] but some people make Joseph Branham the
[13:58] eighth that this great one to come
[14:00] but the the key to understanding this is
[14:03] a quote brother Brandon gives in the
[14:04] anointed ones at the end times
[14:07] he says Malachi 4 5 and 6 is already
[14:10] here in the in the nation now thus saith
[14:13] the Lord
[14:15] and he says the newspapers are writing
[14:17] about it and there was newspaper
[14:19] articles about brother Ram's Ministry
[14:20] and healings I mean they're all over and
[14:21] you can get them you can find them
[14:22] really easily
[14:24] um like I even met the one woman who was
[14:26] healed you know and there's numerous
[14:27] other examples Congressman Upshaw
[14:30] there's so many examples
[14:32] but just uh you know just a thought
[14:34] there that if we if we take all the
[14:36] quotes and you know we the beautiful
[14:38] part is we see brother bam growing you
[14:40] know in his ministry and he's so humble
[14:42] he he uh I put a quote on there I'm not
[14:44] sure if you're familiar with it but
[14:45] brother random says
[14:47] um
[14:48] brother man was talking about this and
[14:49] and one of the brothers in the church
[14:51] put this up there in the Tabernacle and
[14:54] put Branham there and brother Branham
[14:55] said don't put me he said I he said I
[14:57] don't think I have anything to do with
[14:58] that seventh messenger
[15:01] okay but he was being humble that was in
[15:03] 1960.
[15:04] right but then by the end of his
[15:06] ministry you know we everything points
[15:08] to him being the messenger of the hour
[15:10] so I just thought that'd be a helpful
[15:12] video if you're interested you know and
[15:13] going a little deeper on some of those
[15:14] topics and but it just assures us that
[15:17] we're not looking for anybody to come
[15:18] we're looking for the Holy Ghost to rise
[15:19] up in our lives
[15:21] also like that we're looking for the
[15:22] Holy Ghost to rise up in our Ministries
[15:23] right all the fivefold ministry right
[15:26] and remember brother said that's the
[15:27] message of the hour the fivefold
[15:29] ministry we'll get to that Lord willing
[15:30] in a couple Sunday nights by God's grace
[15:32] as the children did the Bible study
[15:33] there on Sunday night
[15:35] so that one went out uh today if you'd
[15:37] like to look at that one by God's grace
[15:39] but I'm just gonna I'm not going to
[15:41] background too much from Sunday if
[15:43] hopefully everybody heard the sermon but
[15:44] remember Solomon got his Revelation or
[15:46] his direction or vision from his father
[15:49] David
[15:52] it was pretty interesting as we saw it
[15:54] on Sunday David would sit down and write
[15:56] and the the Holy Spirit would anoint
[15:58] David and would just take over his pen
[16:00] and he would draw he would write out
[16:02] everything that was needed for Solomon's
[16:03] Temple right of course David didn't know
[16:05] it would be at that time David didn't
[16:07] know maybe it'd be Solomon the name of
[16:09] the the son but he knew it would be for
[16:10] his son because Nathan the prophet told
[16:12] him you know you're a man of war you
[16:14] you've spilled much blood you're not
[16:16] going to build the house
[16:18] he says your son's going to build it
[16:19] he's going to be a man of peace
[16:21] okay and his name was Jedediah or
[16:23] beloved my beloved Solomon that's what
[16:26] the name means my beloved
[16:28] and so uh Solomon got this pattern and
[16:31] in this beautiful prayer
[16:33] uh just so beautiful to see this here uh
[16:36] he humbles himself
[16:38] and he says I am but a child I don't
[16:40] know the exact age of Solomon here but
[16:42] he calls himself a child
[16:45] right so a most grown men don't call
[16:48] themselves children right now so we
[16:50] don't know how old he was maybe a
[16:51] teenager early teens mid-teens or maybe
[16:55] he is an adult and maybe he's just
[16:56] humbling himself and saying I'm I'm
[16:58] nobody or I I see myself as a child I'm
[17:02] nobody or I see myself as a child
[17:06] but the point is when he got into the
[17:08] prince of God and notice this prayer is
[17:09] after a thousand animals were sacrificed
[17:11] think about that
[17:13] you know the blood they had to Slit a
[17:15] thousand throats of all the Lambs and
[17:17] the bullocks a thousand sacrifices after
[17:21] a thousand animals were burnt and killed
[17:23] then he goes to God In Prayer
[17:26] right and he goes before the Lord and
[17:29] God actually appeared to him and said
[17:30] ask whatever you want now people today
[17:32] want a genie in the bottle that's the
[17:34] kind of God they want
[17:35] every and I would say like this you know
[17:37] which one of us wouldn't want God to
[17:40] come to us and say whatever you want
[17:41] I'll give it to you like we we would all
[17:43] want that I mean we would all be
[17:45] privileged to have that
[17:47] but God doesn't do that to all of us but
[17:49] he does promise US the desire of our
[17:51] hearts amen hallelujah praise God
[17:54] Hallelujah and if we seek the kingdom of
[17:56] God first what does that mean that means
[17:58] our heart is going to be changed to be
[18:00] United with the purpose of the kingdom
[18:02] of God and then if we're faithful to
[18:04] this prayer God will give us the desire
[18:05] of our heart because it'll line up with
[18:07] the purpose of God for our lives right
[18:09] it'll line up with the kingdom of God
[18:11] our place in the kingdom of God
[18:15] I'll say like that you know I'm happy uh
[18:17] for my life here I look at my life now
[18:19] I'm 42. I got eight children
[18:21] my children are taking their place in
[18:22] the house of God I couldn't be happier
[18:24] because when I was fit when I was 16 I
[18:27] wasn't anywhere I hated going to church
[18:28] and I look at this guy look at this gal
[18:30] 18 you know far beyond anywhere like you
[18:33] know Lydia's going to graduate
[18:35] and she got through all the high school
[18:37] as a real servant and got the Holy Ghost
[18:39] in high school and I couldn't say that
[18:41] and like now if you were to ask me when
[18:43] you first got married you know and had
[18:45] children what do you want your purpose
[18:46] to be I'm not sure what I would have
[18:47] said
[18:49] but I can look back now and say God gave
[18:51] me the desire of my heart praise God
[18:53] hallelujah praise God it's just
[18:56] beautiful because God's writing the
[18:57] story praise God
[18:59] you just yield yourself to God I've
[19:00] always sought God first that's one thing
[19:02] I have done by God's grace I've been
[19:04] perfect
[19:04] but I have put God first like I told you
[19:07] the testimony even with our house being
[19:08] renovated that happened
[19:11] that would have been in 2021
[19:14] uh so that would have been 2006 uh 14.
[19:18] there have been 15 years into my
[19:19] Ministry I always put God's house first
[19:22] God's house first everything God's first
[19:24] and then in 2021 after 15 years God
[19:27] pours out this huge amazing blessing on
[19:29] on my physical house
[19:31] but I put God's house first
[19:34] for 15 years
[19:35] so I just think it's striking
[19:38] you know God wants us to seek him first
[19:40] and it taught me a lesson
[19:42] I didn't serve God to have that blessing
[19:44] on my natural house that's not why I
[19:46] served God
[19:47] I serve God because it's the right way
[19:49] praise God hallelujah I serve God
[19:51] because this message is Right Hallelujah
[19:53] this message has transformed my natural
[19:55] life and my spiritual life praise God
[19:57] that's why I serve God
[20:01] and then God turns around and writes my
[20:03] story
[20:04] and has given me the desire of my heart
[20:11] and now even my you know Haven how old
[20:12] are you now ten
[20:14] eleven okay I'm really bad with ages
[20:17] forgive me but now you know even she had
[20:20] testified in our dancing Services were
[20:21] the greatest Services she'd ever been a
[20:23] part of now and my children have danced
[20:26] danced in the church now I never did
[20:28] that
[20:29] you know so I look at my life and I say
[20:30] wow Lord I've just tried to humble
[20:32] myself and put you first and God has
[20:34] given me desires of my heart is what I'm
[20:35] saying so it's just a I just think it's
[20:38] it's a it's such a promise if you put
[20:40] God first God is going to honor you
[20:42] honor you praise God that's what that's
[20:45] what David said before he died he said
[20:46] God will honor those who honor God
[20:50] right God will always honor those who
[20:53] put him first and even if God would not
[20:54] have done that you know had not done
[20:57] great blessings at my natural house and
[20:59] I would have still served him
[21:00] I would have done like I did before take
[21:02] out a loan slowly pay it off I mean I
[21:05] would have done all that I mean just
[21:06] because you just have to do it or else
[21:08] your house is going to burn down you
[21:09] know got bad wiring or something like
[21:11] that you're just going to do it
[21:13] but see God is gracious and God God is
[21:16] writing the story for our lives and I
[21:18] wouldn't want it any other way praise
[21:19] God
[21:20] put God first and watch what he does
[21:22] praise God let him write your story
[21:26] Hallelujah now think about what it could
[21:27] have been I could have got up behind the
[21:29] pulpit and said well you know I've been
[21:30] here five years or ten years I'm going
[21:32] to start pulling for extra money can
[21:33] everybody give me some extra money
[21:35] right I could have done that or I could
[21:37] have went on YouTube and say I'm going
[21:38] to start a fund can everybody save me
[21:40] money I'm sorry can everybody send me
[21:42] money rather I'm gonna start a patreon
[21:44] campaign or I'm gonna whatever they call
[21:46] it I'm gonna start a GoFundMe can
[21:49] everybody fund me because I've got eight
[21:50] kids and all these things I could people
[21:52] could do that
[21:54] but see we've got to put God first
[21:56] follow God trust in God let God write
[21:58] our story humble ourselves let's pray a
[22:01] prayer like Solomon hallelujah amen look
[22:04] at this prayer
[22:06] now notice he calls himself a servant
[22:08] he's the king over millions but he says
[22:10] I'm God's servant
[22:11] may God help us to see ourselves as
[22:13] servants
[22:14] I'm God's servant I'm not the boss of
[22:17] this life I'm I'm God servant God's the
[22:19] boss of my life
[22:21] so look look at here we're looking at
[22:23] leadership this is what a leader does
[22:25] and we all can be leaders
[22:27] a leader says first I'm a servant right
[22:31] you've chosen me in this position
[22:34] and I'm just a little child I'm nobody
[22:37] and in other words I'm ready to grow
[22:40] Hallelujah I'm ready to grow I'm ready
[22:43] to learn I'm in this learning stage
[22:45] praise God I don't have it all figured
[22:46] out I need you to guide me praise God
[22:50] look at this humility and I don't know
[22:52] how to go I don't know how to fight all
[22:53] these battles and the church said I hear
[22:55] our brother amen's physical battle we
[22:57] don't know how to fight all these
[22:58] battles so God lead us to help to help
[23:00] him praise God lead us in prayer lead us
[23:02] in visits lead us with food or lead us
[23:05] whatever we can do
[23:07] right we're we're all young I mean we're
[23:09] all I'm the oldest one here tonight you
[23:10] know Beatrice is the oldest one on
[23:12] Sundays you know right I mean we're all
[23:14] we're all pretty fairly Young
[23:16] you know and I like I just like how
[23:19] Simon humbles himself good Lord you have
[23:21] to show me how to go out to the battle
[23:22] you got to show me how to fight the
[23:24] battle and you got to show me how to
[23:25] come in from the battle praise God
[23:28] you got to show me how to fight and you
[23:29] gotta show me how to humble myself
[23:30] coming back from the battle
[23:33] so this is a Leader's prayer and like
[23:36] the Bible said there was no man wiser
[23:40] of the Kings than Solomon
[23:42] now did he was he faithful with it all
[23:44] the time of course not
[23:47] now I think there's a great debate
[23:48] whether now this could be a great debate
[23:50] whether he was wiser than John the
[23:51] Baptist or not because John the Baptist
[23:53] was the greatest of all the prophets so
[23:54] that could be a debate for another time
[23:56] as we said on Sunday but I think that's
[23:57] a good that's a great thought I really
[23:59] would like to maybe preach a whole
[24:00] sermon on that
[24:01] how John the Baptist could be the
[24:02] greatest you know he didn't get married
[24:05] he could have
[24:07] Moses got married
[24:09] look I mean he could have went out and
[24:11] got a job John didn't have I didn't go
[24:14] out to get a job
[24:15] got John trusted in nature God right
[24:19] nature
[24:20] he trusted every time I say nature I
[24:22] think of her
[24:24] I mean look look what he did
[24:26] and he said he could have stayed in the
[24:28] city but he said I'm going out to the
[24:29] Wilderness so I so I'm ready for my
[24:31] commission now look at that
[24:32] Moses around to Wilderness because he
[24:33] was afraid of being arrested and killed
[24:35] as a murderer John went out there
[24:37] voluntary to seek God's face
[24:40] to make sure he was ready for the
[24:41] calling of his life
[24:43] right and he knew his mom and dad would
[24:46] have had told him
[24:47] the angel said the spirit of Elijah is
[24:49] going to be on you
[24:51] you're a Nazarite unto God and look he
[24:53] look at that he took his vow seriously
[24:57] he didn't waste his youth
[25:00] he didn't waste it out with drunk
[25:01] drunkenness and prostitutes like Samson
[25:05] right
[25:07] so that's that's probably the start of
[25:09] another sermon I'll get to Lord willing
[25:11] but here look at this humble prayer of
[25:13] Solomon First Kings 3.
[25:15] and then in verse 9 he said give me an
[25:18] understanding heart so I can know right
[25:20] from wrong
[25:24] right that's what we need today this is
[25:26] the most deceptive time there's ever
[25:27] been
[25:28] right
[25:30] there's never been a more deceptive time
[25:31] look how close Joseph Branham is and the
[25:33] tapers look at these message preachers I
[25:36] mean sometimes like I said sometimes it
[25:38] shakes me we're almost a year from the
[25:39] time where the preachers were saying you
[25:41] know the Rapture is any day any hour
[25:43] almost a year from that
[25:46] and here we are I mean that really shook
[25:48] me up that's why I preached that series
[25:49] on pride and doctrines of devils I mean
[25:51] it just shook me up how can people and
[25:53] they're how can people make these
[25:54] statements and there's no accountability
[25:57] that's because there's no economy in the
[25:59] church then right that means nobody's
[26:01] got the courage to go up and ask
[26:02] questions they're not allowed to ask
[26:03] questions
[26:06] but he says give me an understanding
[26:08] heart to judge the people to know right
[26:11] from wrong
[26:13] good and bad
[26:14] because who can judge this large group
[26:17] of people
[26:18] so one way I'm thankful for a small
[26:20] church because it's easier to judge
[26:21] because there's less people right
[26:23] Hallelujah I thank the Lord for that
[26:25] praise God
[26:27] and in verse 10 it's pleased the Lord
[26:29] now I like how he calls himself a child
[26:31] because the Bible said in Romans 9 26.
[26:34] that we were not God's people but now we
[26:38] are called the children of the Living
[26:39] God
[26:40] okay we are children Living God
[26:43] Galatians 3 26 says for ye are all the
[26:47] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[26:50] when you have when you put your trust in
[26:53] Jesus Christ you're now Jesus Christ
[26:55] child
[26:56] you're a child of God
[26:58] for as many of you has been baptized
[27:00] into Christ have put on Christ
[27:04] so you put on his family name
[27:07] praise God you're a Christian you're a
[27:10] child of God thank God I'm not a child
[27:12] of the devil praise God that's what Paul
[27:14] told that uh that sorcerer right
[27:16] oh you child of Satan remember called
[27:18] him a child of Satan thank God we're not
[27:19] children of Satan praise God
[27:21] or children of God hallelujah that means
[27:24] we got a father that means we got an
[27:26] inheritance praise God that means we got
[27:28] a future home in our father's house
[27:29] praise God glory
[27:32] and now go to take your Bibles go to
[27:33] first John 4 verse 4. let's read this
[27:35] one this will be a good one to read here
[27:39] first John 4 verse four I'd just like
[27:41] you to read this one
[27:45] I just want you to see that look at the
[27:47] context here
[27:50] I just want to encourage you to church
[27:51] it's a great thing
[27:54] and just overcoming
[27:56] demonic spirits of deception
[28:01] right I interact with them all the time
[28:03] people can say uh I believe in in God
[28:06] and uh they say I believe in I believe
[28:08] brother Brown was a prophet of God but I
[28:10] believe every word on the tape is thus
[28:11] say the Lord and they're totally
[28:13] convinced they're so deceived and I you
[28:15] no matter what I show them you can't
[28:17] shake them
[28:18] there's nothing you can do that's why I
[28:21] pray God be merciful that they can
[28:22] recover themselves out of the snare of
[28:24] Satan
[28:26] right there's nothing you could say
[28:28] because they've got a demon Spirit they
[28:30] love to worship that they worship that
[28:31] spirit
[28:32] I don't know why they love to worship a
[28:33] deity spirit I have to pray to God for
[28:35] Revelation on that
[28:36] why would they love worshiping a man
[28:39] above Christ
[28:41] I don't know maybe it's because they can
[28:43] feel some connection to the tape or I
[28:44] don't know they can say they hear the
[28:46] voice of God in the tape or something I
[28:48] have no idea why would why would they
[28:49] want to worship why would they love a
[28:51] deity spirit
[28:52] why would they want to worship a man
[28:54] uh creation more than the Creator
[28:57] that's the same thing homosexuals do
[28:59] right that's what the Bible says
[29:00] homosexuals worship the creation rather
[29:03] than the Creator
[29:05] but look at verse four year of God
[29:07] little children
[29:09] and now look little children can
[29:11] overcome everybody say catch that here
[29:14] of God little children and have overcome
[29:17] them
[29:18] because greater is he that's in you than
[29:21] he that's in the world
[29:23] so we're spiritual children of God God
[29:26] sees us as his children but we're
[29:28] Overcomers
[29:29] because he puts a portion of his power
[29:32] inside of us praise God
[29:34] and so when we're we're coming into the
[29:36] battle like David would go out to the
[29:37] battle when we go out to the battle
[29:39] we've got to stir ourselves up and
[29:41] remember God put something greater in me
[29:43] praise God
[29:44] then this temptation I have a greater
[29:46] power in me than the force or this this
[29:49] evil spirit that I'm battling I've got a
[29:51] greater power so I will overcome
[29:54] it's built into me praise God Amen
[29:56] Hallelujah there's a greater power in me
[29:59] than he that's in the world Satan of
[30:01] course Satan's in the world
[30:03] but go up to verse one here's the
[30:05] context the context is with lying
[30:08] deceiving spirits
[30:11] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[30:14] the spirits whether they are of God
[30:16] because many false prophets are gone out
[30:18] into the world that's why I tried the
[30:20] brothers that say they're the greatest
[30:22] of all time I tried them I emailed them
[30:24] I reached out to them
[30:26] and I believe they're wrong
[30:28] that's why I tried to Brothers about uh
[30:30] predicting the rapture
[30:32] or days or hours away that's why I try
[30:34] them because the Bible said try the
[30:35] spirits that's what they don't want they
[30:37] don't want to ask or they don't want to
[30:39] answer questions
[30:41] right
[30:43] so don't believe and I'll say like this
[30:45] even don't believe every single thing I
[30:46] say because you've I'm sure you've heard
[30:48] hundreds of my mistakes by now
[30:50] uh you know I was thinking amen and
[30:52] Naomi been here almost eight years eight
[30:53] years you know eight years Bang's been
[30:55] here the whole time my wife's been here
[30:56] the whole time
[30:58] but you know I'm human
[31:00] that doesn't mean you take complexes
[31:02] toward me but you're just careful what
[31:03] you say Amen to it you're careful what
[31:05] you believe right believe not every
[31:07] Spirit but try the spirits whether
[31:09] they're of God many false prophets are
[31:11] going on in the world so we've got to
[31:12] watch out for false prophets
[31:16] remember just the example Joseph Branham
[31:18] said he went out to Arizona to come back
[31:19] he says I've got the word of the Lord
[31:21] for you he said thus saith the Lord he
[31:23] said keep playing the tapes you're in
[31:25] the perfect will of God now to me that's
[31:27] a false prophecy
[31:29] because brother Ram never said that the
[31:31] Bible never said that
[31:33] right
[31:37] and so that's how that's how deceptive
[31:40] false prophets are right
[31:41] so close
[31:44] but it won't deceive the elect praise
[31:45] God aren't you glad Church you can't be
[31:47] deceived Hallelujah
[31:50] that's what the Bible says and then
[31:52] verse 2 hereby know ye the spirit of God
[31:54] every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[31:56] Christ has come in the flesh is of God
[32:00] now we all know this verse there's got
[32:02] to be a deeper meaning than this right
[32:03] because every denominational person will
[32:05] say Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[32:08] so there has to be a deeper meaning now
[32:10] the best I understand right now
[32:12] is the understanding is
[32:15] um
[32:16] every person that's born again
[32:18] recognizes Jesus Christ in them Jesus
[32:20] Christ has come in my flesh
[32:23] now that could be the wrong thought but
[32:24] I'm just giving you a thought because we
[32:26] all know Catholics that say Jesus has
[32:27] come in the flesh and they pray to Mary
[32:30] or women preachers or homosexuals that
[32:33] go to the pulpit they would say I
[32:35] believe Jesus Come In the Flesh they all
[32:36] say that
[32:38] so there has to be a deeper
[32:39] understanding here and every spirit that
[32:41] confesses not that Jesus is come in the
[32:43] flesh is not of God and this is that
[32:46] Spirit of antichrist which ye have heard
[32:48] that it should come and even now already
[32:50] it is in the world
[32:53] so there's something about the spirit of
[32:54] antichrist that denies Jesus Christ in
[32:57] flesh amen can I say like this this is
[32:59] my own thought right now I could be
[33:00] wrong but it denies that there's a group
[33:03] that's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[33:05] say like that
[33:06] in other words they deny we're the bride
[33:08] they would say they're the bride they're
[33:10] denying Jesus Christ in the flesh in
[33:12] other words they're denying the message
[33:13] of the hour they're denying the group
[33:15] who holds the message of the hour
[33:18] praise God that's the best I can
[33:19] understand from that now the context for
[33:21] our verses verse 4 about little children
[33:23] now he says
[33:26] year of God little children and overcome
[33:28] them who's to them
[33:30] it's those that are denying Jesus Christ
[33:32] is come in the flesh
[33:34] it's those false prophets
[33:37] you see sometimes we think our battles
[33:39] you know are so small but Church our
[33:41] battles are great
[33:42] these are great battles to overcome all
[33:44] these deceiving voices out there
[33:47] this is the context there's many
[33:49] antichrists anyone who's against the
[33:51] word is an antichrist praise God
[33:54] right
[33:56] Paul I'm sorry John says there's already
[33:58] many antichrists out there but the
[34:00] leadership of the Holy Ghost gives us
[34:02] power to overcome them greater is he
[34:05] that's in us than he that's in the world
[34:06] Amen the leadership praise God
[34:10] Hallelujah overcome them overcome who
[34:13] the false prophets with the Antichrist
[34:16] Spirit on them
[34:18] right like we had the Antichrist Spirit
[34:19] try to come in a couple of years ago uh
[34:23] they call they said they want to come up
[34:24] and testify uh they said just for 45
[34:27] minutes or something and and try to
[34:29] bring a new different interpretation of
[34:30] the of the message and I said no you're
[34:32] not you will not and don't come to
[34:35] church if you're going to try to do that
[34:36] that was the Antichrist spirit
[34:38] the Rapture has already happened or that
[34:40] I think you said there's no rapture
[34:42] uh you don't have to pay tithes don't
[34:44] have to go to church yet the Bible
[34:46] plainly says it
[34:48] right yet claiming to believe God sent
[34:49] brother random all these things it's so
[34:52] deceptive but it proves we had a greater
[34:54] power in us than the power that's in the
[34:56] world praise God
[34:58] just simple examples like that
[35:00] Antichrist anti-word right
[35:03] anti-revelation from Christ
[35:05] okay so he calls you little children but
[35:08] little children you overcome by the
[35:10] greater power that's inside of you
[35:13] all right now Solomon was willing to
[35:16] follow God's judgments at the beginning
[35:19] of his ministry right and God blessed
[35:20] him
[35:21] and then this led to the great prayer
[35:24] that God loved all right it's a
[35:26] beautiful prayer here we saw
[35:28] now if you got your Bibles here let's
[35:30] let's I want to start looking here at a
[35:31] few types here
[35:34] now remember Solomon got the pattern
[35:37] from David
[35:39] but Solomon also I want to start looking
[35:41] at a type here because you you know and
[35:44] I asked myself this too how does
[35:45] Solomon's Temple connect to me like we
[35:47] you know we just might in our own minds
[35:48] maybe a little weary say well how does
[35:50] this how does this sermon even apply to
[35:51] me
[35:52] but I want you to catch it tonight by
[35:54] God's grace
[35:55] you know I showed you a few weeks ago we
[35:57] looked at uh
[35:59] the Tabernacle of Moses the Tabernacle
[36:02] of David and then the Temple of Solomon
[36:04] right and we saw the type there
[36:06] Old Testament Moses New Testament David
[36:10] and Millennium Solomon
[36:12] right
[36:13] now I'm going to take that type
[36:16] uh that uh the type there of Millennium
[36:18] but I'm also going to show another
[36:19] aspect a different type to it
[36:22] okay
[36:24] I'm going to type that uh the the
[36:26] building of Solomon's Temple I'm going
[36:29] to type the building of Solomon's Temple
[36:30] to the spiritual Temple God's Building
[36:33] right now in other words all the Holy
[36:37] Ghost filled members of the body of
[36:39] Jesus Christ did you know that's
[36:40] happening right now
[36:41] did you know God's Building a temple
[36:43] right now
[36:45] I'm going to prove it by the scripture
[36:47] now Church who knows how many years did
[36:49] it take for Solomon to build the temple
[36:50] anybody know
[36:52] seven
[36:55] that's a beautiful type amen we don't
[36:58] die
[37:00] I like giving a high five so anytime
[37:02] walking around it might give you a high
[37:03] five okay I like pound on the wall like
[37:06] brother Diggs and then Things fall off
[37:07] the wall when I when I go back in my
[37:09] office Hallelujah
[37:12] but it's a beautiful type not only did
[37:13] it type the millennium
[37:16] it does type in London but it also types
[37:18] the spiritual
[37:19] building God's Building right now and
[37:22] that's what I want to show tonight
[37:24] so when you look at Solomon's temple
[37:26] being built you see I'm a part of that
[37:28] Temple
[37:30] can I say it like this I'm a stone
[37:33] in Solomon's Temple
[37:36] or you might say I'm a gem I'm a diamond
[37:39] I'm a carbuncle what are some of those
[37:41] names there I'm a is it a topaz there
[37:44] you're one of those jewels
[37:47] you are part of the body or the Temple
[37:51] of Jesus Christ praise God
[37:53] but it's a spiritual Temple the Bible
[37:56] says
[37:57] and it's a spiritual Temple because God
[37:59] lives in that Temple praise God Amen the
[38:02] prince of God abides in his people
[38:04] praise God
[38:06] but it takes seven years to build Church
[38:08] it takes seven Church ages to build I
[38:17] think finally I got the answer
[38:19] I just got to wait on the Lord he'll
[38:21] renew your strength praise God
[38:24] so I want you to see here how Solomon
[38:26] here
[38:27] uh he's a type of the Holy Spirit
[38:31] because remember David was a man of war
[38:33] Solomon was not
[38:36] salmon was a man of peace
[38:38] so in the in the second new type we're
[38:40] typing today
[38:41] Solomon represents the Holy Ghost
[38:43] because the Holy Ghost is wisdom
[38:46] it took a man of wisdom to build the
[38:48] house of God
[38:50] it took a man of peace and isn't the
[38:52] Bible say the Holy Ghost kingdom is
[38:54] righteousness joy and peace amen
[38:56] hallelujah
[38:58] praise God Psalm is no Solomon is noted
[39:01] for peace and wisdom
[39:03] David precedes Solomon Solomon completes
[39:06] David one is incomplete without the
[39:08] other David received the pattern Solomon
[39:11] builds that pattern one Ministry made
[39:13] way for the other one king made way for
[39:16] the next king praise God
[39:18] in other words the ministry of Jesus
[39:20] Christ in his body led to the ministry
[39:22] of the Holy Ghost praise God because he
[39:24] said if I don't go away he said the
[39:26] comforter won't come
[39:28] and it's more expedient that I go away
[39:31] so more people have the pillar of fire
[39:33] living inside of them amen hallelujah
[39:35] so that each person could have God's
[39:37] presence each person can have a greater
[39:39] power to overcome in them rather than
[39:42] just one person having the power many
[39:44] could have that greater power praise God
[39:46] oh my starting to see that now
[39:50] Hallelujah
[39:51] so in David we see Christ in his death
[39:54] because it's a shedding of blood
[39:56] everybody see that David's Ministry type
[39:58] Jesus Earthly Ministry
[40:01] but Solomon and and yeah and then David
[40:04] conquered all the enemies he he
[40:05] completely inherited all the Promised
[40:08] Land
[40:09] didn't Jesus purchase all your promises
[40:12] right
[40:14] it's beautiful
[40:16] hallelujah oh I love that bye so Solomon
[40:20] is viewed as Christ in his resurrection
[40:22] and in his current place as mediator
[40:25] over the church he's building the church
[40:29] praise God
[40:31] that's what I ended with I'm going to go
[40:33] back to this on Sunday I I really ended
[40:35] quickly I kind of cut out some
[40:38] some important scriptures I want to show
[40:39] there but let me go that
[40:41] I wanted to say this church that you and
[40:43] I are all building something
[40:45] you're building a testimony
[40:48] that's why I said you're a leader that's
[40:50] why we can you know we can go look to
[40:52] the Natural salmon builds things like my
[40:54] brother Paul he's a project manager and
[40:55] they build Bridges he's in charge
[40:58] of Building Bridges can you imagine that
[41:00] or massive
[41:02] multi-million dollar building steel
[41:03] buildings
[41:05] that's why he was intrigued by Solomon
[41:07] which I can relate to I can see where
[41:09] he's if he's in the building I could see
[41:10] how he'd relate to that
[41:12] but the Bible says you're building
[41:13] something too you're building a
[41:15] testimony
[41:17] You're Building A Life That's worthy the
[41:20] gospel amen hallelujah because the Bible
[41:23] says wisdom builds her house
[41:26] right so when we go to your house the
[41:27] life you live the the how the family
[41:29] lives in the house that's what you're
[41:31] building you're building an atmosphere
[41:33] you're building a dwelling place for the
[41:35] Holy Spirit praise God
[41:36] you're building that
[41:38] and I was going to tie it on Sunday that
[41:40] you know our uh vang's dad Lee went home
[41:44] to what we hope to be with the Lord
[41:47] but now we can look back and see what he
[41:49] built
[41:50] right
[41:52] like William Williams now 70 right we
[41:54] can see what he's built now right we can
[41:55] see
[41:56] we can see where all these years in the
[41:58] message what it's built praise God
[42:02] you're building something
[42:03] so the Bible says be careful how you
[42:05] build
[42:07] you're building a testimony
[42:10] you're building an atmosphere in your
[42:12] home
[42:12] You're Building you're building a
[42:14] character
[42:17] right so the words that come out of your
[42:19] mouth and and the atmosphere that you
[42:20] constantly live in every day you got to
[42:23] strive but you can we can do it we got
[42:24] to fight you kind of we can press
[42:26] through all the the carnal the carnality
[42:29] and we can live in the spirit praise God
[42:30] like Austin has a good testimony maybe
[42:32] I'll have them share at the end about
[42:33] how he went to visit brother amen and he
[42:36] wanted to feel the Holy Spirit come in
[42:38] right brother
[42:40] so maybe we'll have you share that at
[42:41] the end that'd be a good testimony
[42:43] like you just wanted the prince of God
[42:44] to come in the room that's a beautiful
[42:46] testimony
[42:47] but you're building something
[42:49] and every one of us must be careful how
[42:52] we're building and we must build by what
[42:55] the wisdom of God
[42:56] Lord give me an understanding heart so I
[42:58] know if this is the right thing or the
[43:00] wrong thing
[43:02] before and how do I know I got to have
[43:04] the pattern amen I got to have the
[43:06] vision praise God where do you get that
[43:08] from the father Hallelujah your heavenly
[43:10] father will give you the pattern praise
[43:12] God
[43:13] see that's why we don't jump into things
[43:14] without praying about it we don't make
[43:16] massive decisions without praying about
[43:18] it first
[43:20] right because this is what children do
[43:21] children go to their fathers
[43:23] and they ask for the leadership right
[43:25] I'm just a child
[43:27] I don't know everything I don't have
[43:29] everything figured out father I'm coming
[43:31] to you
[43:32] guide me give me the understanding I
[43:34] need
[43:37] so we can see this beautiful type here
[43:41] so the Solomon's Ministry is like the
[43:44] the temple the temple building of the
[43:46] holy spirit's Ministry
[43:49] and it was a time of Peace praise God
[43:54] now let's read uh
[43:59] let's read a scripture here let me go
[44:01] let's go to
[44:05] let's go to First Corinthians 3 9. let's
[44:06] go there first Corinthians 3 9.
[44:11] and I'm going to look up look up a
[44:13] scripture while you're turning there
[44:15] First Corinthians 3 9.
[44:30] looking for that scripture wise master
[44:32] builder
[44:38] there it is that's all okay that is
[44:41] that's the right verse okay praise God
[44:44] yeah I didn't get the chance to get all
[44:45] the scriptures I wanted to do for a year
[44:47] Labor's together with God ye are God's
[44:49] husbandry you are God's Building how
[44:52] many understand that
[44:54] you're a part of God's Building in other
[44:55] words God wants to dwell in this
[44:57] sanctuary
[44:59] right God wants to dwell in your home in
[45:01] my home
[45:02] you're God's Building
[45:05] right God wants to God wants to go to
[45:07] Walmart with brother Chris right brother
[45:10] God wants to go to the elementary school
[45:12] with me you're God's Building I'm God's
[45:14] Building
[45:15] right you're God's husbandry
[45:18] let's look up what that word means here
[45:21] well husband Theresa that's I think a
[45:23] field right it's a field or a
[45:28] you're God's uh
[45:30] agriculture I say like that
[45:33] verse 10 here's what I want to get to
[45:34] according to the grace of God which is
[45:36] given unto me as a wise master builder
[45:39] now look at this how how could he be so
[45:41] wise how could Paul build the church on
[45:43] the right way through the grace of God
[45:46] how are you going to build by the grace
[45:48] of God
[45:49] 's favor upon your life
[45:52] as a wise master builder I have laid the
[45:54] foundation and another bill that thereon
[45:57] but let every man take heed how he built
[45:59] it thereon
[46:01] now of course it's speaking of preachers
[46:02] right
[46:04] Paul laid the foundation now here I am
[46:06] I'm at the end time I'm 2000 years later
[46:08] brother Chris and I'm preaching and I'm
[46:10] trying to finish this building with all
[46:13] the other preachers
[46:15] sometimes they might put the wrong brick
[46:17] there sometimes I might put the wrong
[46:19] brick there God forgive me
[46:21] because we've got to be careful
[46:23] we gotta be careful I believe if they
[46:25] put the wrong brick God sends them out
[46:26] God dismisses them from the building
[46:29] right because Judas works well for a
[46:31] while but then he fell away
[46:33] but Paul said I build here I'm a wise
[46:35] master builder I did it by God's grace
[46:37] and everyone must be careful how you
[46:39] build upon the gospel
[46:42] God has a building
[46:44] God has a people that he dwells in how
[46:47] many happy to be a part of that amen
[46:49] hallelujah
[46:51] thank you Jesus
[46:54] so see
[46:56] now go down to verse 11 here
[46:59] for another Foundation cannot for other
[47:02] Foundation can no man lay other than
[47:04] that what is just laid which is Jesus
[47:07] Christ
[47:09] all right verse 12. now if any man build
[47:10] upon this Foundation gold silver
[47:12] precious stones would hey stubble Every
[47:14] Man's work should be made manifest for
[47:16] the day shall declare it because it
[47:17] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[47:20] shall try every man's work what sort it
[47:22] is
[47:24] all right so the day of judgment is
[47:26] going to show who built the right way on
[47:28] God's house
[47:30] who is the right who which preachers
[47:31] preach the right things I want to be one
[47:33] that preaches the right thing
[47:35] not the wrong thing so I'm going to take
[47:36] all my all my building materials I want
[47:38] to take them out of God's word
[47:40] Hallelujah
[47:41] that's exactly right
[47:43] now
[47:47] now I want to now go to this thought
[47:48] here by God's grace now go back to First
[47:51] Kings 5 verse two go back to First Kings
[47:53] five so I wanted to show the spiritual
[47:55] type Paul was a builder but I want to go
[47:57] back to the the Temple of Solomon First
[47:59] Kings 5 verse 2.
[48:12] actually let's read 5 verse 1 and 2.
[48:18] and hiring king of tire he sent his
[48:20] servants unto Solomon for he had heard
[48:21] that they had anointed him King in the
[48:23] room of his father for Hiram was ever a
[48:26] lover of David and Solomon sent to hire
[48:29] him saying thou knowest how that David
[48:30] my father could not build a house under
[48:32] the name of the Lord his God for the
[48:33] wars which were about him on every side
[48:35] until the Lord put them under the soles
[48:37] of his feet but now the Lord my God hath
[48:39] given me rest on every side
[48:41] so that there is neither adversary nor
[48:43] evil or current
[48:46] and behold I purpose to build a house
[48:48] unto the name of the Lord my God as the
[48:50] Lord spake unto David my father saying
[48:52] thy son whom I will set upon thy throne
[48:55] in thy room he shall build and house
[48:56] unto my name
[48:59] now I'm gonna go down to verse seven it
[49:01] came to pass when Hiram heard the words
[49:02] of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and
[49:04] said blessed be the Lord this day which
[49:06] hath given unto David and wise son over
[49:08] this great people and hire sent to
[49:10] Solomon saying I have considered the
[49:11] things which thou sent us to me for and
[49:14] I will do all that as I are concerning
[49:15] Timber of Cedar and concerning Timber of
[49:18] fur my servant shall bring them down
[49:20] from Lebanon unto the sea and I will
[49:22] convey them by sea in floats unto the
[49:25] place that thou shalt appoint me and
[49:27] will cause them to be discharged there
[49:29] and thou shalt receive them and thou
[49:31] shalt accomplish my desire in giving
[49:32] food for my household
[49:36] okay so we see Solomon in order to build
[49:39] this house he has to have help from a
[49:42] gentile King
[49:44] and the church said
[49:46] could a Jew build this all by himself no
[49:49] the other two could be the Temple of Mo
[49:52] or Tabernacle Moses Tabernacle of David
[49:54] those were built by Jew only but here
[49:57] with the Temple of Solomon it's Jew and
[49:59] Gentile and notice Kings amen Kings and
[50:01] Priests unto God Amen praise God
[50:05] and he says okay I'll send you the cedar
[50:07] you send me food for my people
[50:10] right so he has to get help from a
[50:12] gentile King he can't do it outside of
[50:14] help from a gentile King praise God
[50:19] and so Hiram God use this man to supply
[50:21] materials for the house he also had
[50:23] skillful men working alongside the
[50:25] skillful men of Israel
[50:28] so the Israelites and Gentiles worked
[50:30] together side by side in the building of
[50:33] God's house
[50:35] and this is typed in Ephesians 2 11.
[50:38] let's go to Ephesians 2 11. this is a
[50:40] type in Ephesians 2 11.
[50:43] now this is in my book actually put this
[50:44] in my book I think it's in chapter four
[50:46] of the or chapter two rather of the Jew
[50:48] and Gentile One Church
[50:51] Ephesians 2 11.
[51:01] actually Ten's a beautiful verse for
[51:03] that too look at someone took it verse
[51:04] 10 you say by Grace but verse 10 for we
[51:06] are as workmanship created in Christ
[51:08] Jesus unto good works he he's called you
[51:10] to build something and the church said
[51:12] he's called you to do something he's
[51:14] called you to work for his name
[51:17] which God hath before ordained that we
[51:19] should walk in them
[51:22] all right
[51:25] now this goes
[51:28] quite a ways down
[51:30] to the end of the chapter but I'm not
[51:33] going to read all that
[51:36] uh but let's read 11 through 13.
[51:38] wherefore remember that ye being in the
[51:40] time past Gentiles In the Flesh who were
[51:42] called uncircumcision by that which is
[51:44] called circumcision in the flesh made by
[51:46] hands that at that time you were without
[51:48] Christ being aliens from the
[51:50] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[51:51] from the covenants of the promise having
[51:53] no hope and without God in the world
[51:54] think about that you had no hope until
[51:56] Christ came and died
[51:58] you had no promises until Christ came
[52:00] and died
[52:02] but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[52:05] were far off are made nigh by the blood
[52:07] of Christ there's no devil that can tell
[52:09] you you're not close to Christ
[52:12] the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:14] brought you near to God
[52:16] so you can tell the devil no devil I'm
[52:18] near to God I might feel far in my
[52:21] feelings but I don't trust my feelings
[52:22] amen the Bible says I have promises I
[52:26] have covenants I'm close to God I'm in
[52:28] close proximity I'm close to my father
[52:30] Hallelujah
[52:31] I'm not far off I'm not wandering off in
[52:34] the wilderness or some stranded Island
[52:35] some far away no he's brought me unto
[52:38] himself amen he's brought me to his
[52:40] banqueting table his band Over Me Is
[52:43] Love Hallelujah
[52:45] he came looking for me praise God
[52:48] right he came and found me I was a lost
[52:51] sheep he came and found me and brought
[52:52] me into his banqueting table
[52:55] how was that shooting of mine praise God
[52:56] he called me out of the shepherd's field
[52:58] amen I was the one I was the one that
[53:00] was out there he came and found me I'm
[53:03] not worthy of it he's the king he's the
[53:05] royalty but he made me royalty praise
[53:07] God by marrying me Hallelujah that's
[53:10] what the Bible says amen
[53:12] spiritual
[53:14] all right now
[53:16] the Bible says be renewed in verse 23 be
[53:18] renewed in the spirit of your mind
[53:20] verse 22 says put off your corruptness
[53:22] and your lust verse 24 that you might
[53:25] put on the new man
[53:26] I'm sorry I'm in the wrong chapter
[53:27] forgive me
[53:29] forgive me I flipped the page there
[53:33] on accident
[53:35] go down to verse
[53:37] 18 for through Jesus him we both have
[53:41] access by one sphere unto the father now
[53:43] therefore you're no more strangers and
[53:45] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[53:46] Saints and of the household of God and
[53:48] listen Church you are built upon the
[53:49] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[53:51] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[53:54] Cornerstone amen can I say it like this
[53:56] you are so stable nothing is going to
[53:58] destroy your building
[54:00] nothing is going to be able to topple
[54:02] you because your bill upon the strongest
[54:04] Cornerstone there ever was amen
[54:07] there's never been a Cornerstone like
[54:09] this Cornerstone praise God
[54:11] and look at we're built upon Saint Paul
[54:13] Glory we're built upon John and Peter
[54:16] and James Martyrs that gave their life
[54:18] for Christ we're built on that
[54:20] Foundation how could we fall how could
[54:22] we fail how could Satan knock us over
[54:24] it's impossible or build upon the Chief
[54:26] Cornerstone the Son of God Jesus Christ
[54:29] amen
[54:30] how could we fall we can't fall praise
[54:33] God
[54:36] verse 21 in whom all the building the
[54:39] building fitly framed together growth
[54:41] unto a holy Temple in the Lord this
[54:44] Temple is still being built
[54:46] Hallelujah
[54:48] so spiritually if there were spiritual
[54:49] signs here you'd see that caution tape
[54:51] construction area
[54:53] when you walk into church you'd see
[54:54] construction area
[54:56] and you see angels with hard hats
[54:58] making sure everybody's being taken care
[55:01] of
[55:02] we we found all the OSHA laws right we'd
[55:04] be fine
[55:05] every ocean law everything would be
[55:07] right in order glory amen we found all
[55:10] the commands amen hallelujah God is
[55:13] building something here praise God he's
[55:14] building a people he's building a place
[55:16] where his presence can dwell praise God
[55:19] he's building a bride Hallelujah
[55:22] and you're a part of it it's still under
[55:24] construction that's why this moment is
[55:27] just as important that's why every age
[55:28] was super important
[55:31] people try to exalt this age like it's
[55:33] better than others
[55:34] we couldn't even have this age unless
[55:36] they were faithful in the other ages
[55:37] amen
[55:39] right yes this age is important it's a
[55:41] finishing age it's the age where think
[55:43] about that church at one day the final
[55:46] member will come in the final ministry
[55:47] will be sealed by the Holy Ghost and
[55:49] then Jesus will come as The Headstone
[55:51] praise God and there'll be shoutings of
[55:53] Grace Grace that's Rapture time amen but
[55:57] the building's got to be finished first
[55:58] praise God the building's got to be
[56:00] built up each Stone each believer each
[56:03] testimony praise God each person's life
[56:05] has to be placed in there by the Holy
[56:07] Ghost and this is the glory of God this
[56:09] is the presence of God this is where God
[56:11] is worshiped but one day Jesus comes and
[56:14] he finishes that building praise God
[56:16] that's the rapture
[56:18] Hallelujah
[56:21] Glory
[56:22] see we're growing that's why Church the
[56:24] body of Christ is always growing in
[56:25] Grace
[56:27] the church is always being built it's
[56:29] going up greater with each with each age
[56:31] it gets greater and greater building up
[56:32] to the top
[56:34] in whom also ye are building together
[56:36] for inhabitation of God through the
[56:38] spirit
[56:40] about 40 minutes here so I'm trying to
[56:41] watch My Time by God's grace
[56:43] now
[56:46] I want you to see that
[56:49] Solomon using a gentile King
[56:52] to build the house is a type of the Jew
[56:54] and Gentile building the habitation of
[56:56] God in the New Testament
[56:58] right because the Holy Ghost fell on who
[57:00] first who the Holy Ghost fall on first
[57:01] Jews or Gentiles Jews
[57:04] right and then Peter had the keys and
[57:05] you opened the door of the kingdom of
[57:07] God to Samaritans and then open at the
[57:09] Gentiles
[57:10] right and now all all of them are
[57:13] working together right they're all
[57:15] working together because some Jews have
[57:16] the Holy Ghost right the small small
[57:18] just like small Gentile group but
[57:20] they're building the habitation of God
[57:21] they're finishing the body of Christ
[57:24] that's right
[57:26] it's a beautiful type and Shadow
[57:29] Church you are not a stranger to heaven
[57:35] when we get to heaven it's not going to
[57:36] it's not gonna be like oh this is a
[57:38] foreign land welcome foreigners it's
[57:40] gonna be like welcome home
[57:43] this is where I was meant to be
[57:45] This is Where I Come From the mind of
[57:47] Christ amen amen are they going to be
[57:49] like when Naomi come to U.S and you're
[57:51] just getting used to all the the customs
[57:53] and everything when I went to South
[57:54] America I used to all the customs and
[57:55] how they handle this and how do they buy
[57:57] things and just strange
[57:59] you got to get used to the Customs when
[58:01] we go to heaven it's not going to be
[58:02] like that
[58:04] we are fellow citizens I'm a citizen of
[58:07] Heaven praise God hallelujah you're a
[58:09] citizen of Heaven praise God God broke
[58:12] down any walls God broke down anything
[58:14] that would separate you you're not far
[58:15] from God you're close to God and you're
[58:17] going back to God hallelujah
[58:20] you're a citizen of Heaven praise God
[58:22] you're a child of the king
[58:26] but you've got to build while you're
[58:28] here praise God you've got to build I'm
[58:30] building as a preacher I'm super
[58:32] important How I build it's very
[58:34] important because I'll be judged by what
[58:35] I preach
[58:36] I'll be judged by what I live
[58:38] Hallelujah I want to be faithful
[58:40] that's right
[58:41] now Church there was another man named
[58:43] Hiram that uh another Hiram King Solomon
[58:46] reached out to two hirams
[58:49] okay so go to chapter seven uh First
[58:51] Kings seven
[58:54] I know it's hot in here and I know it's
[58:56] hard not to be sleepy on a late night
[58:59] so take a big deep breath or something
[59:00] like that
[59:03] thank the Lord
[59:05] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[59:14] Hallelujah
[59:17] so First Kings seven
[59:22] thirteen
[59:24] and King Solomon said and fetched Hiram
[59:27] out of Tyree he was a widow son of the
[59:29] tribe of naphtalia and his father was a
[59:31] man of Tyree a worker in brass and he
[59:32] was filled with wisdom and understanding
[59:34] and cunning to work all the things and
[59:36] works in brass and he came to King
[59:38] Solomon raw all his work
[59:41] okay
[59:43] now this uh
[59:46] this Hiram seems to be part due in part
[59:48] Gentile because his mother was the tribe
[59:50] of Dan
[59:53] and her husband was of the tribe of
[59:55] naphtali
[59:56] and then his mother became widowed and
[59:58] she married a man of Tyree
[1:00:01] okay so this is again this man's
[1:00:03] probably have to have Gentile this other
[1:00:04] man named Hiram and he had wisdom
[1:00:07] Hallelujah he had wisdom with all the
[1:00:10] medals
[1:00:11] and the stones
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:14] and all the Engravings
[1:00:16] and so Solomon sends to him and he sends
[1:00:19] back and said he's able to help
[1:00:23] but the main point here is that Israel
[1:00:25] and gentile people were involved in the
[1:00:27] temple of the Lord this is totally
[1:00:29] contrasted to Moses's Tabernacle and
[1:00:32] David's
[1:00:33] they just it was all Jew God raised up
[1:00:35] Jews with wisdom well here during this
[1:00:37] time when the temple is going to be made
[1:00:38] mostly of gold
[1:00:41] silver some brass
[1:00:43] lots of gems
[1:00:45] Cedarwood over overlay with gold all
[1:00:48] these things here he has Gentiles
[1:00:50] working on it now you know the story
[1:00:52] Church
[1:00:54] you probably heard it before the Bible
[1:00:55] says that all these stones and all these
[1:00:58] all these gems were all cut outside of
[1:01:01] Jerusalem
[1:01:03] there was in Jerusalem there was no
[1:01:05] sound of saws cutting
[1:01:09] there was no buzz saws cutting
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:13] there was not all the cutting was done
[1:01:15] outside
[1:01:16] of the Holy place
[1:01:19] right after the place of God here's what
[1:01:21] brother Brown says about it there's lots
[1:01:22] of quotes on this but here's one of them
[1:01:24] this one I like when Solomon built the
[1:01:26] temple they was they was cut out from
[1:01:27] all over the world
[1:01:29] but when they come together there wasn't
[1:01:31] a buzz saw nor the sound of a hammer
[1:01:34] every block no matter if this one might
[1:01:37] have been a Oneness
[1:01:38] or a Tunis
[1:01:40] or a threeness this one was a fiveness
[1:01:43] whatever it was but when they come
[1:01:45] together they went dovetail one with the
[1:01:48] other that's right and there wasn't any
[1:01:51] arguing there wasn't any buzzing
[1:01:54] Hallelujah so what does this show we
[1:01:57] were all stones or gems out in the world
[1:01:59] right but it took somebody to cut us
[1:02:03] if someone all the arguing and fussing
[1:02:05] had to be done there in the flesh right
[1:02:08] but when we come before God when we take
[1:02:10] our place in the body of Christ
[1:02:12] Hallelujah when we take our place with
[1:02:14] the divine nature when we have the
[1:02:16] anointing on us there's no arguing
[1:02:18] Hallelujah there's no buzzing there's no
[1:02:21] cutting
[1:02:22] all that is done elsewhere before we get
[1:02:26] to this place here before we get in our
[1:02:28] place in the body of Christ all the
[1:02:30] arguing all the fussing was out when I
[1:02:32] was in the presbyan church like Simon
[1:02:33] said when we were in the Pentecostal
[1:02:35] church and they argued about tongues
[1:02:36] right we didn't argue we just disagree
[1:02:37] but that's buzzing right all that
[1:02:39] buzzing had to be done but God had to
[1:02:41] cut I disagree with that so God had to
[1:02:43] cut that that was me that was me getting
[1:02:45] cut right there like that was me getting
[1:02:47] cut out right I had to get shaved and
[1:02:49] then God brought me into the message of
[1:02:51] the hour praise God
[1:02:53] Hallelujah there's no cutting there's no
[1:02:55] arguing there's no buzzing here in the
[1:02:57] body of Christ there's no schisms in the
[1:02:59] body of Christ
[1:03:01] all the noise and all the all the sins
[1:03:03] all the all the division separation that
[1:03:06] found outside the body of Christ but in
[1:03:08] the body of Christ there's peace
[1:03:09] Hallelujah and everything fits together
[1:03:11] perfectly Hallelujah
[1:03:14] isn't that isn't that what happened
[1:03:15] church when we have think about when we
[1:03:17] have great anointed meetings
[1:03:19] it just it just sounds like from the
[1:03:21] first song all the way to the end
[1:03:23] everything is what perfect
[1:03:26] doesn't that sound like this building
[1:03:28] there's no cutting there's no buzzing
[1:03:30] there's no arguing there's no fussing
[1:03:33] hallelujah it's a foreshadowing it's a
[1:03:36] four taste of this body of Christ when
[1:03:39] the body of Christ comes out I'll say
[1:03:41] like this when the body of Christ gets
[1:03:42] all cut you know and and all corrected
[1:03:44] and and all repented outside the service
[1:03:47] when we all come together in the service
[1:03:48] and we're under the anointing we all fit
[1:03:51] together perfectly
[1:03:53] and this and the service flows perfectly
[1:03:56] but remember there wasn't any argument
[1:03:57] there wasn't any buzzing there wasn't
[1:03:59] any fussing they just went together and
[1:04:01] made the temple of God that's right and
[1:04:04] I believe God is cutting out everywhere
[1:04:05] Born Again children of God and going to
[1:04:08] bring them together I may not live to
[1:04:10] see to see it but I hope I do praise God
[1:04:14] oh thank God that's beautiful praise God
[1:04:19] so there's two Gentiles
[1:04:21] kings that help out
[1:04:26] now I'm not going to read all these
[1:04:27] because I want to finish up here I got
[1:04:29] 11 minutes and I'll be at my hour
[1:04:31] I'm really going to try to finish here
[1:04:35] but now these
[1:04:42] these II Chronicles 7.
[1:04:48] here's a list of Gentiles that were in
[1:04:50] Israel working on the temple but not
[1:04:53] right I'm sorry yeah they were working
[1:04:55] on the temple
[1:04:56] the total number of strangers it says
[1:04:58] was one thousand five I'm sorry was 153
[1:05:02] 600 gentiles
[1:05:05] that's a lot of workers
[1:05:09] seventy thousand were Bears of burdens
[1:05:12] or just
[1:05:13] uh
[1:05:14] the bird and bears the heavy lifters
[1:05:17] 70 000 men just to build this house and
[1:05:19] this house wasn't very tall it's 50 feet
[1:05:22] 50 feet tall
[1:05:24] but this is eight that's maybe eight
[1:05:26] feet there
[1:05:28] so you know stack a stack a few on there
[1:05:31] you know 50 feet
[1:05:33] was it four four five uh stories not
[1:05:37] very tall
[1:05:38] compared to Eiffel Towers I mean this
[1:05:40] Temple the Solomon Temple was nothing in
[1:05:42] height compared to that but yeah can I
[1:05:44] say like this yet its height reached
[1:05:46] unto Heaven praise God it might have
[1:05:48] been small and Thatcher but spiritually
[1:05:50] it had the ability to touch the heart of
[1:05:52] God hallelujah
[1:05:54] it reached hybrid in the heavens praise
[1:05:56] God
[1:05:58] this was a very small it wasn't a very
[1:06:00] large house at all
[1:06:01] we got the prince of God throughout
[1:06:03] there what an encouragement to us church
[1:06:04] we might be a small church but we can
[1:06:06] reach up to heaven praise God
[1:06:08] it's never in the size
[1:06:10] never in the size it's in the quality
[1:06:13] right
[1:06:13] it's in the purpose it's in the
[1:06:15] predestinated purpose of God what's the
[1:06:18] purpose of the Eiffel Tower what's the
[1:06:19] purpose of uh the Sears tower building
[1:06:22] there what's the purpose of these great
[1:06:23] Towers the Twin Towers what's the
[1:06:25] purpose that for the glorify man but the
[1:06:27] purpose of the temple was to glorify God
[1:06:29] the purpose of your life is to glorify
[1:06:31] God you're the habitation of God I'm the
[1:06:34] habitation of God
[1:06:36] God inhabits Our Lives
[1:06:41] okay moving on 80 000 were humors in the
[1:06:44] mountains or Timber
[1:06:45] Fellers they would cut the Timbers 80
[1:06:49] 000 workers
[1:06:51] three thousand six hundred were
[1:06:53] overseers
[1:06:54] this is where it might help my brother
[1:06:55] Paul
[1:06:57] you know you have a lot a lot fewer
[1:06:59] supervisors than you do laborers
[1:07:03] right but one man had to catch the
[1:07:04] vision Solomon had to see well I can't
[1:07:06] do this it was just the people here I
[1:07:08] need help from 150 000 workers
[1:07:11] outside of my Realm if this house is
[1:07:14] going to be built
[1:07:15] that's what leadership does leadership
[1:07:17] will guide you to find the right workers
[1:07:19] right it'll guide you to find the Holy
[1:07:21] Spirit if God wants something done God
[1:07:23] will get it done amen
[1:07:25] if God wants to do something in your
[1:07:26] life it's going to get done
[1:07:29] but you got to yield to it you got to
[1:07:31] trust the vision you got to trust the
[1:07:32] pattern
[1:07:33] Hallelujah
[1:07:36] 3 600 overseers of the Gentiles three
[1:07:40] over three thousand supervisors watching
[1:07:42] out all the humors and all the bearer
[1:07:44] burden bearers to bring all this Lumber
[1:07:46] all these stones
[1:07:48] now the men of Israel
[1:07:51] there was over 30 thousand
[1:07:54] men working and they sent ten thousand
[1:07:57] every month
[1:07:58] okay and they had the man Ado nyrum was
[1:08:02] set over these 30 000 courses
[1:08:06] okay so he had one man Solomon had one
[1:08:07] man over the Jews and he would be over
[1:08:09] one or sorry ten thousand men every
[1:08:11] month when they would come in think
[1:08:12] about that for seven for seven years
[1:08:15] ten thousand workers come in and they go
[1:08:17] out once a month for seven years to
[1:08:20] build this house
[1:08:22] this wasn't some Shanty right this
[1:08:25] wasn't some easy thing to put up seven
[1:08:27] years
[1:08:28] if my calculations are right that's
[1:08:29] almost 200 000 workers
[1:08:32] on one building
[1:08:35] and here's what they did they were
[1:08:37] humors of Timber they were stone masons
[1:08:39] Hallelujah they were Builders of the
[1:08:41] house they were Carpenters there's they
[1:08:43] were laborers
[1:08:45] so God took Gentiles and Jews both had
[1:08:49] to work together for seven years to
[1:08:51] build this house praise God amen
[1:08:54] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:08:57] church that's a long time to build
[1:08:59] something
[1:09:00] have you worked on something for seven
[1:09:02] years before I worked on that book for
[1:09:03] two and a half years I thought was going
[1:09:05] to kill me
[1:09:06] just because I'm impatient
[1:09:09] I'm an impatient kind of hasty kind of
[1:09:11] person
[1:09:12] have you worked on something for seven
[1:09:13] years before
[1:09:14] that's a long time
[1:09:16] you guys a long time to wait
[1:09:19] right just like it's a long time to wait
[1:09:20] for your prayers to be answered
[1:09:23] but how many still want to wait for God
[1:09:24] to move
[1:09:26] amen seven years seven long Church ages
[1:09:32] I heard Brothers say you know God God
[1:09:34] hit it from John and Paul that was going
[1:09:36] to be 2 000 years they all they were
[1:09:37] right they were writing like oh it's
[1:09:38] going to be any time the Rapture was
[1:09:40] coming anytime Rapture come anytime it
[1:09:41] was gonna be 2 000 years
[1:09:44] so Church let's not be impatient with
[1:09:45] God if the Rapture don't happen in our
[1:09:47] lives let's keep building
[1:09:49] let's build until we're called home
[1:09:52] praise God
[1:09:54] who would have thought just go back two
[1:09:55] generations right let's go back two or
[1:09:57] three generations what did I say we're
[1:09:59] three generations from my brother
[1:10:00] Brandon we're three generations from
[1:10:01] Brother Brown
[1:10:03] are you glad brother Randall finished
[1:10:04] his work for his generation yes right so
[1:10:08] we got to do the same thing we got to
[1:10:09] Faithfully build the Church of God the
[1:10:12] Church of Jesus Christ and I'm not
[1:10:13] talking I'm not talking Latter-Day
[1:10:14] Saints or this other direction I'm
[1:10:16] talking about the real body of Christ
[1:10:17] Hallelujah that believes all the Bible
[1:10:19] Hallelujah
[1:10:21] I've been studied on Azusa Street maybe
[1:10:23] Sunday I'll preach on that a little bit
[1:10:24] laws it takes church is just prayer
[1:10:26] prayer and obedience that's all it takes
[1:10:28] for Revival
[1:10:29] prayer and obedience that's all it takes
[1:10:32] there's not and and every generation has
[1:10:35] a chance
[1:10:36] at a Revival like Azusa Street
[1:10:40] every generation has an opportunity like
[1:10:41] that the thing is we the thing is all of
[1:10:44] us are just kind of unfamiliar what
[1:10:45] actually happened who's read a book on
[1:10:46] Azusa Street and Rachel anybody read a
[1:10:48] book I didn't think so neither had I
[1:10:53] but what happened its impact it was the
[1:10:55] start of the church age what happened
[1:10:56] well we need to find that out praise God
[1:11:00] and we'll find the same lessons now as I
[1:11:02] close I got five minutes to close for my
[1:11:04] hour
[1:11:06] church I think you can see the spiritual
[1:11:08] lessons can't you
[1:11:10] Christ by the holy spirit is building
[1:11:12] his church today with Jews and gentiles
[1:11:16] the Bible says so
[1:11:17] mostly Gentiles but there are some Jews
[1:11:20] and he's building it by wisdom
[1:11:23] he's building it by the gifts of the
[1:11:25] Holy Spirit
[1:11:27] that's right
[1:11:29] and he's got workers too
[1:11:32] the Bible says prophets are like hewers
[1:11:36] right the Bible says my Prophet will be
[1:11:38] like a humor cutting down on the trees
[1:11:40] cutting down the idols The Groves didn't
[1:11:43] brother Brown cut down all those
[1:11:44] denominational Groves you better believe
[1:11:46] it he had like Simon and cancer that he
[1:11:48] hammered an organization almost every
[1:11:50] service did he not
[1:11:51] that was everyone I was listening to
[1:11:53] today he was hammering on denominations
[1:11:54] again
[1:11:56] he had to cut out he had to cut down all
[1:11:58] those lies amen he had to cut down all
[1:12:00] those man-made uh systems and he had to
[1:12:02] start building up the real body of
[1:12:04] Christ praise God
[1:12:07] so who they who's the workers the
[1:12:09] apostles and Prophets laid the
[1:12:11] foundation Church you don't have to
[1:12:12] worry about laying the foundation you
[1:12:13] you don't have to worry about getting
[1:12:15] the word of God we've already got the
[1:12:16] word of God
[1:12:17] I don't have to worry about it I've
[1:12:19] already got a Bible thank God I got a
[1:12:20] Bible they in front of me brother Chris
[1:12:22] that has the pattern for how I'm
[1:12:23] supposed to build I just got to look at
[1:12:25] the pattern amen
[1:12:27] in our lives everyday lives we just
[1:12:29] gotta look at the pattern praise God
[1:12:31] each one of us has got to open up our
[1:12:33] Bibles pray obey what it says and look
[1:12:35] at the pattern Hallelujah
[1:12:37] but the apostles and Prophets they had
[1:12:39] to go out in the wilderness and get the
[1:12:40] pattern Paul did
[1:12:45] we got built we got workers today too
[1:12:46] praise God
[1:12:50] we have uh the fivefold ministry right
[1:12:53] prophets Apostles we have evangelists
[1:12:57] we have Shepherds pastors we have
[1:12:59] teachers
[1:13:02] right which one works on you the most
[1:13:03] the pastor so maybe I'm like a stone
[1:13:05] Mason
[1:13:07] right what does the stonemason do well
[1:13:09] most cases well you got the big cuts
[1:13:11] with the lasers right
[1:13:12] but then if there's small little things
[1:13:13] you just got to sand it down
[1:13:16] sanding right so what do I do every
[1:13:18] service I try to let God preach so you
[1:13:20] can be sanded down all your rough places
[1:13:22] can get smoothed off
[1:13:24] so you don't poke each other
[1:13:28] so I don't poke you
[1:13:30] right
[1:13:32] sand it down right it's a stone Mason
[1:13:35] God's gotta and church how does he do
[1:13:37] he's got to Humble us sometimes humble
[1:13:39] us after weeks and weeks and months and
[1:13:41] months and years and year just years and
[1:13:43] years just getting into the right spot
[1:13:44] remember Michelangelo he'd work on those
[1:13:46] sculptures for years
[1:13:49] for years just I mean it looks just
[1:13:51] lifelike
[1:13:53] but it took years to do that that wasn't
[1:13:55] just a one moment one day work that
[1:13:57] wasn't a one day project
[1:13:59] it's going to take years for us to come
[1:14:01] into the the real image God has for this
[1:14:04] portion of the body of Jesus Christ but
[1:14:06] I'm glad he's shaping us praise God
[1:14:09] I'm glad you that we're letting the word
[1:14:11] continually shape Our Lives Hallelujah
[1:14:15] I love it
[1:14:17] we have Elders we have deacons right we
[1:14:19] have Elders like uh William and Beatrice
[1:14:21] Elders been the church a long time
[1:14:23] there's a preacher Elder but then
[1:14:25] there's just Elders they've just been
[1:14:26] the message a long time
[1:14:28] they give us a lot of wisdom
[1:14:35] then church then you have
[1:14:37] then you have outside of the preachers
[1:14:39] you have all the nine gifts of the Holy
[1:14:41] Spirit
[1:14:42] everybody has a gift everybody has a
[1:14:45] Ministry
[1:14:46] everybody has something they're building
[1:14:49] everybody's working for the kingdom of
[1:14:51] God how many working for Jesus Kingdom
[1:14:53] yeah you're working that's why you're
[1:14:55] sitting here you're God's workmanship
[1:14:57] and you're here working and you're
[1:14:59] building the Temple of God and as First
[1:15:01] Corinthians 3 said let every man take
[1:15:04] heed how he builds upon this Foundation
[1:15:09] praise God
[1:15:13] so church can we see it
[1:15:15] can we see that we are a body fitly
[1:15:17] framed together
[1:15:20] God put us together because he knew we'd
[1:15:22] work the best together
[1:15:25] some of us God had to send 5 000 miles
[1:15:27] to fit in the right place
[1:15:30] right for my wife and I God had to send
[1:15:33] us 170 miles to fit in the right place
[1:15:36] we were not a fit in the other church
[1:15:37] over there on the other side of the
[1:15:38] state
[1:15:40] we might have got cut out there
[1:15:43] but God had to send us over here
[1:15:47] so brother Austin and Lena you were some
[1:15:49] pretty good stones but Arizona wasn't
[1:15:50] the spot we were going to fit
[1:15:52] God had to send you over here just like
[1:15:54] all those
[1:15:54] all those Cedars
[1:15:56] all those stones all those gems they
[1:15:59] come from all around that world at their
[1:16:01] own time
[1:16:02] and they all came in the spot where they
[1:16:04] could be in the perfect position
[1:16:06] where we would we would fit together
[1:16:08] there's my hour we'd fit together as a
[1:16:10] habitation of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:12] in other words I'm trusting in you to be
[1:16:14] in the right place so the spirit of God
[1:16:15] can fall you're trusting in me to be in
[1:16:18] the right position so the spirit of God
[1:16:20] can live here
[1:16:23] right and what keeps it out our sins
[1:16:26] so we just have to confess our sins
[1:16:28] right go on with God let God
[1:16:31] help us grow
[1:16:33] pray receive his word and God will build
[1:16:37] this body into the church it's supposed
[1:16:39] to be we will we will see we will see
[1:16:42] where our position is in the entire
[1:16:44] building of God that that I'll just use
[1:16:47] the pyramid we'll see our position on
[1:16:49] that top row right before the headstone
[1:16:51] we'll see where God placed us and church
[1:16:53] within the next few years we'll see too
[1:16:55] In Our Lifetime we'll see how close we
[1:16:56] are to the top two
[1:16:59] right but there's going to be a church
[1:17:00] that is the last Church before Jesus
[1:17:03] comes
[1:17:04] what if it's us
[1:17:05] then we have to submit to all
[1:17:08] the sanding down
[1:17:11] right we got to submit to all the
[1:17:13] the smoothing out of our Lives praise
[1:17:16] God
[1:17:16] getting out all the arguing we might not
[1:17:19] argue with one another but how about
[1:17:20] when we argue with doing the will of God
[1:17:23] we argue in our minds
[1:17:25] how about that argument we could get rid
[1:17:26] of we could get rid of that praise God
[1:17:28] Hallelujah
[1:17:31] like brother Ram said God is cutting out
[1:17:33] everywhere Born Again children of God
[1:17:35] going to bring them together I may not
[1:17:37] live to see it but I hope I do church I
[1:17:40] hope I live to see it don't you
[1:17:42] there's coming a ladder rain that final
[1:17:44] anointing the final Reign before the
[1:17:46] Harvest praise God
[1:17:48] there's coming forth where the the
[1:17:51] fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[1:17:53] bride
[1:17:54] praise God praise God but we got to be
[1:17:56] ready when that when that that rain
[1:17:57] falls praise God we've got to be ready
[1:17:59] and we'll take our position I hope I
[1:18:02] live to see it praise God but if I'm not
[1:18:04] I'm going to keep sanding Stones I'm
[1:18:06] going to keep preaching to God's Stones
[1:18:07] so we'll fit together perfectly and
[1:18:10] we'll take our position in the building
[1:18:11] of God
