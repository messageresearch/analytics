[0:06] let's go to first samuel 16 i'd like to
[0:08] lord willing tonight kind of get back to
[0:10] the mount zion thought here so this will
[0:12] be part five i kind of look at the
[0:14] ministry of david here or look at the
[0:16] ministry of david as prophet king and
[0:19] priest and that's a little different
[0:21] order than what i'm used to saying i'm
[0:22] used to saying prophet priest king i
[0:25] don't know how i got into that habit but
[0:27] the actual order of his ministry was
[0:29] prophet
[0:31] king
[0:31] priest lastly
[0:33] so just just a beautiful type here by
[0:35] god's grace
[0:36] so let's go to first samuel 16 if we can
[0:45] and just a couple reminders here but as
[0:47] we're turning there in the scripture
[0:49] um
[0:50] last wednesday night service i didn't
[0:52] get it put up yet i just kind of forgot
[0:54] about it but if you want just listen to
[0:56] that let me know i can upload it
[0:58] and then brother brooks is coming
[0:59] december 18th and 19th
[1:03] we're looking forward to our
[1:04] thanksgiving meal next thursday by god's
[1:06] grace so wow eight days away
[1:09] audio books done on the web my website
[1:11] and also i put up a new video this week
[1:13] called eagles our prophets and believers
[1:16] so i put that one up there uh from our
[1:18] little bible study so
[1:20] that was
[1:21] that's going good by god's grace so i
[1:23] thank the lord for that
[1:25] so i think that's it for announcements i
[1:26] feel like i'm missing something
[1:28] i'll probably think of it later
[1:30] first samuel 16 please
[1:39] verse ones first samuel 16 verse 1.
[1:48] you know it was as we look here at
[1:50] david's life i was reminded that i left
[1:52] off i preached a whole series on first
[1:54] samuel
[1:55] numerous years ago and i left off right
[1:56] after bathsheba and i never picked it up
[1:59] so maybe sometime at some point i like
[2:01] to pick that back up just because now i
[2:03] can see such a beautiful type between
[2:05] david and christ it's even more clear of
[2:08] course because we have that priesthood
[2:10] after the order melchizedek but i'm just
[2:12] really enjoying this study of course and
[2:14] david's life is just a tremendous type
[2:16] of jesus christ
[2:18] so we're thankful for that first samuel
[2:20] 16 1.
[2:22] i'll read this one and then let me read
[2:24] this one and then we'll read
[2:26] 12 together
[2:29] so here's david's first anointing and i
[2:32] didn't realize that david had three
[2:33] anointings during his lifetime he was
[2:35] anointed three times
[2:38] as a prophet king and priest
[2:42] verse 1 and the lord said unto samuel
[2:44] how long will thou mourn for saul seeing
[2:47] i have rejected him
[2:49] from reigning over israel isn't that
[2:52] such a sad thing
[2:53] how could god reject a man because the
[2:55] man rejected him
[2:58] right grace will never fail you but
[3:00] people can fail grace
[3:03] they can kick aside and
[3:05] stomp underfoot the bible said try and
[3:07] underfoot the son of man and crucify him
[3:09] afresh
[3:10] hebrews 10 29
[3:12] what a sad thing that's what saul here
[3:14] seemingly does
[3:16] fill thine horn with oil and go and i
[3:17] will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite
[3:20] mariah provided me a king among his sons
[3:22] now go down to verse 12 we'll read 12
[3:24] together
[3:27] let's read that on three one two three
[3:29] and he sent and brought him in
[3:32] now he was ruddy and with all of a
[3:35] beautiful countenance and goodly to look
[3:38] to and the lord said arise anoint him
[3:42] for this is he what a what a story
[3:47] what a story david just starts his life
[3:50] out overlooked
[3:52] and then god is able to take this humble
[3:53] servant
[3:54] god is able to raise him up to king
[3:56] praise god prophet first then king and
[4:00] lastly priest
[4:01] what a beautiful story verse 13 says
[4:03] then samuel took the horn of oil and
[4:05] anointed him where in the midst of his
[4:07] brethren
[4:08] he's a shepherd right
[4:10] up to this point he's just he's just a
[4:12] shepherd but now he becomes an anointed
[4:14] shepherd
[4:16] hallelujah
[4:18] in the midst of his brethren and the
[4:19] spear lord came upon david from that day
[4:21] forward
[4:22] so samuel rose up and went to rhema
[4:24] let's have a word of prayer if we can
[4:26] let's ask the lord to help us here for a
[4:27] few minutes i'll try to preach about 45
[4:29] minutes we'll see how that goes
[4:31] by the grace of the lord
[4:33] let's bow our heads heavenly father god
[4:34] we love you tonight lord and we just
[4:36] don't say that we love you so much we
[4:38] want to love you with our hearts soul
[4:40] mind and strength here we are tonight
[4:42] lord our bodies are here and i pray lord
[4:43] help our minds to be here as well help
[4:45] my mind lord help all of our minds lord
[4:48] and just transform them tonight lord
[4:49] just speak to us out of your word lord
[4:52] we know your whole bible's inspired men
[4:54] and women have shed their blood and died
[4:56] for the last 2 000 years to preserve
[4:58] this holy word because it's a holy
[5:01] inspired word so lord may we find the
[5:03] inspiration the revelation within that
[5:05] will give us spiritual food and due
[5:06] season for this evening lord god bless
[5:08] your people that oppress their way out
[5:10] to the house of god they love you lord
[5:12] there's no better place they'd rather be
[5:13] than in the house of god worshiping
[5:15] jesus and we give you the highest praise
[5:17] jesus tonight for you're worthy of all
[5:19] of our worship and praise you are the
[5:21] high priest who sits on the throne
[5:23] tonight after the order of melchizedek
[5:25] after the order of an endless life
[5:27] hallelujah so we thank you jesus that
[5:29] you conquered death and you're alive
[5:31] forevermore and we give you honor and
[5:33] praise tonight just minister now by the
[5:34] holy ghost to us in jesus christ's name
[5:37] and the church said
[5:39] amen you may be seated here by god's
[5:40] grace
[5:48] so look at this here kind of like my
[5:50] subtitle is uh prophet king and priest
[5:53] we'll try to get to this here we'll just
[5:55] rehearse some of these
[5:56] uh thoughts here as we kind of build to
[5:58] that thought i've never really preached
[6:00] on this before so this is
[6:02] the the idea of those three offices is a
[6:04] new office a new sermon to me i've never
[6:07] really preached that of course i
[6:08] preached extensively on david like i
[6:10] said for the whole book of first samuel
[6:12] all the way up to ii samuel 11 i think
[6:14] is where i stopped
[6:17] and i'm sure there's a purpose for that
[6:22] so let's look here to the word of god
[6:23] here tonight for a few minutes
[6:29] so we're starting here with david's
[6:31] first anointing there was three
[6:33] anointings on david's life we'll build
[6:35] up to that
[6:37] and again i'm taking some of these
[6:38] thoughts from uh kevin j connor's book
[6:41] on the ta the temple of david tabernacle
[6:43] rather of david because i found such
[6:46] inspiration in there that's where i
[6:47] found the old testament
[6:49] ages right
[6:51] typing the church ages that's where i
[6:52] found it
[6:54] very closely typed a beautiful type
[6:56] there
[6:56] and that was a great blessing
[6:59] so let's start here now
[7:01] we see you know the we uh we looked at
[7:03] last week how the bible said all the
[7:05] scripture was written for our admonition
[7:08] for our correction and and all the old
[7:10] testament doctrine is is useful for
[7:12] doctrine and uh for reproof and
[7:15] correction and instruction we looked at
[7:17] that last wednesday night
[7:19] so that totally uh reveals that we can
[7:22] use old testament words to teach new
[7:25] testament doctrine that's what paul did
[7:27] paul used the fifth commandment about
[7:30] children honoring your parents he used
[7:31] that in the new testament ephesians
[7:33] chapter six
[7:34] so we can use it as long as we're
[7:36] directed by the holy spirit we know the
[7:38] law is is abolished for us right we
[7:42] don't get rid of the law rather but
[7:43] jesus fulfilled the law praise god and
[7:46] we fulfill the righteousness of the law
[7:48] through the holy spirit through the law
[7:50] of liberty the law of the spirit the law
[7:52] of obedience the rule of obedience
[7:54] praise god because we want to because we
[7:56] want to obey god because we want to love
[7:58] god we want to serve god there's no more
[8:01] curse because jesus took the curse for
[8:03] us
[8:04] amen there's no more curse of the law
[8:05] that if i'm guilty of one i'm guilty of
[8:07] the whole that whole curse has been done
[8:09] away with amen in christ jesus we don't
[8:11] have that attitude towards the law
[8:13] anymore that's why we don't mind using
[8:14] the old testament scriptures
[8:16] that's why denomination or people that
[8:18] leave the message they can't handle it
[8:20] because they they still feel like they
[8:22] must be under that curse but paul could
[8:24] take old testament scripture john could
[8:26] right all these bible writers could
[8:29] peter peter said be holy for i'm holy
[8:32] how can he take that that was a
[8:33] leviticus scripture how could he take a
[8:35] leviticus scripture and apply it to
[8:37] today because he had a spiritual mind
[8:39] amen
[8:40] because he realized i'm not under the
[8:41] curse but there's righteous commands in
[8:44] there that i want to fulfill today
[8:45] praise god in other words the holy ghost
[8:48] is still saying today be holy people of
[8:50] god for i'm holy amen but that takes a
[8:53] revelation it takes as we've been
[8:54] looking at our bible studies at home
[8:56] we've been looking at revelation that
[8:57] takes a revelation from the father you
[8:59] can't get that in the seminary
[9:01] these guys now go off the seminaries and
[9:02] they go to different places after they
[9:03] leave the message
[9:06] and they're going to the wrong place the
[9:07] place to go is on your knees in prayer
[9:09] amen that's the place to go and then
[9:11] listen for the voice of god for your day
[9:13] hallelujah listen for the present truth
[9:15] hallelujah like the ephesians got to
[9:18] hear the apostle paul and they moved on
[9:20] from the baptism of john to the baptism
[9:23] of jesus christ amen hallelujah water
[9:25] and spirit amen
[9:27] hallelujah and so
[9:29] these are all beautiful types we learn
[9:31] from the old testament and so each of
[9:33] these characters in the old testament
[9:35] have a purpose in their life they either
[9:37] foreshadow jesus christ they
[9:39] foreshadow some new testament event or
[9:41] they foreshadow the bride of jesus
[9:43] christ
[9:44] right we preached on that recently it's
[9:46] a chapter four in my book all the types
[9:48] of the old testament women who typed the
[9:50] bride of jesus christ oh there's so many
[9:52] of them you just you just could name
[9:54] them all by god's grace
[9:56] but there are certain people that stand
[9:58] out and this is what the author picks up
[10:00] i really like this stuff he picks up
[10:01] there's certain
[10:03] types of christ and believers that we
[10:04] have to pay attention to
[10:07] right like adam and noah and isaac and
[10:10] joseph and moses and aaron and samuel
[10:13] and isaiah jeremiah ezekiel daniel and
[10:15] so many more how they type uh new
[10:18] testament characters and it's crucial
[10:20] for us to see it
[10:21] he gives us some of these examples like
[10:23] adam adam was a type of the second
[10:27] the second adam praise god he was a type
[10:28] of jesus christ amen
[10:30] a new man a new creature right
[10:33] uh because he's the lord from heaven
[10:36] adam was the man of earth but jesus
[10:38] christ is the man from heaven hallelujah
[10:41] he's he's a new adam praise god
[10:44] and that reminds us that church we don't
[10:45] we're not living off the old man we're
[10:47] living as a new man in christ jesus
[10:50] just like jesus christ was a brand new
[10:52] man the beginning of the creation of god
[10:54] amen aren't you glad you're a new
[10:56] creation in christ tonight
[10:58] we're not what we were praise god that's
[11:00] our own life that life is is dead and
[11:03] it's gone and it's separated from us
[11:05] we're new creatures we talk differently
[11:07] we walk differently we think differently
[11:09] praise god hallelujah we believe
[11:11] differently amen we think differently
[11:13] praise god everything about us is a new
[11:15] creature amen
[11:17] that's because christ was a second adam
[11:20] amen
[11:21] giving us that example of a new creation
[11:23] in christ jesus
[11:25] isaac is a beautiful type i never heard
[11:26] this before but he's a beautiful type as
[11:29] the only begotten son of the old
[11:30] testament isn't that isn't that true
[11:33] because abraham had all these sons right
[11:35] but but god said isaac is my only son
[11:39] that's what god said isaac is your only
[11:41] son he was the only one begotten by
[11:44] faith hallelujah he was the only one
[11:46] begotten by promise and so god used
[11:49] isaac as a foreshadow right that he was
[11:52] the only begotte there's going to be a
[11:53] promised seed that comes by the promise
[11:56] of promised word of god amen he doesn't
[11:58] come by the instrumentality of just a
[12:00] man's a man's timing or a man's desire
[12:03] but he comes by the timing and plan of
[12:05] god almighty
[12:06] amen that's isaac and that pointed us to
[12:09] jesus christ amen who is the only
[12:11] begotten son of god hallelujah he's the
[12:14] only kind like him he's though he's a
[12:16] one of a kind god took that mold and he
[12:18] threw that one away praise god because
[12:20] we've all sinned and fallen short of the
[12:21] glory of god but jesus didn't have this
[12:23] in nature amen he was the word made
[12:26] flesh praise god he wasn't under the law
[12:29] of sin and death i mean he was body his
[12:30] body was subject to it but he didn't
[12:32] have this the the law of sin inside of
[12:35] his members that's what we talked about
[12:37] at the bible study one time the brother
[12:38] disagreed with me but i said he didn't
[12:40] sin it was impossible for him to sin
[12:42] because he wasn't the sin made flesh he
[12:44] was the word made flesh
[12:47] you and i the bible says that we're born
[12:49] of a woman in a few days full of trouble
[12:51] praise god david said in sin did my
[12:54] mother conceive me amen but jesus was
[12:56] not conceived in sin amen he was
[12:59] conceived outside of sin he was
[13:01] conceived in divine nature hallelujah
[13:03] the holy spirit so yes he was under the
[13:06] law of death but he wasn't he didn't
[13:08] have the sin nature inside of him praise
[13:10] god and isaac was a prefigure of jesus
[13:14] christ amen
[13:16] joseph can you imagine joseph is such a
[13:19] major type of jesus christ
[13:22] not just jesus's life we know that was
[13:24] jesus life where he's rejected by his
[13:26] brother and thrown in a bit and then
[13:27] exalted but joseph he typed two thousand
[13:31] years of jesus christ
[13:33] how many people can say that praise god
[13:35] right because if we look at the type now
[13:38] joseph ruling over egypt is jesus ruling
[13:41] over this world praise god and the only
[13:43] place you get food is from jesus amen
[13:47] hallelujah the only place we get food
[13:49] and jesus has a wife right now
[13:50] hallelujah azernath amen a gentile wife
[13:54] hallelujah right now praise god and he's
[13:56] about to go back and reveal himself to
[13:58] his jewish brethren amen
[14:00] his life joseph was such a man of god
[14:03] his life type 2 thousand years of the
[14:05] life of jesus christ
[14:07] earthly 30 or 33 years right and then
[14:10] the rest these 1900 and 70-something
[14:12] years amen
[14:13] all typing jesus christ what a testimony
[14:16] joseph is as a man that god could use he
[14:19] was rejected right hated of his brethren
[14:21] but his father loved him amen and he had
[14:23] a covenant with god amen that no man
[14:26] could no matter how hard they tried to
[14:28] speak against him and defame him and
[14:30] keep him down he rose eventually because
[14:33] god was with him he was a spiritual man
[14:35] amen that's how you and i are church
[14:37] they can keep us down they can try to
[14:39] your people can try to offend you or
[14:41] discourage you the devil can try to try
[14:44] to rend your life but he can't touch it
[14:46] until god says so amen and god has the
[14:49] last say amen god has the last say over
[14:51] my life my life is in his nail scarred
[14:53] hands amen
[14:55] hallelujah we ought to be encouraged
[14:57] praise god satan can he can he can
[14:59] battle us he can try to defeat us but
[15:01] he'll never overcome us
[15:04] and joseph is a type of that amen
[15:06] can you imagine for all those years was
[15:07] it 13 years uh yeah 13 years he was in
[15:10] in egypt i think two years in the prison
[15:13] there
[15:15] and he could have been discouraged all
[15:16] that time
[15:18] but he chose to keep believing he chose
[15:19] to keep being his best every day amen he
[15:22] chose to keep honoring god every single
[15:24] day and and despite living under that
[15:27] shadow of a false accusation church had
[15:29] vanished in a matter of moments
[15:31] and that's what your that's what our
[15:33] life our sinful life did our sinful past
[15:36] jesus made it vanish by the blood amen
[15:38] when we became a king when we were born
[15:41] again baptized with the holy ghost the
[15:43] sins were emitted it was all done away
[15:45] with we're a new creature in christ now
[15:47] we're kings and priests unto god amen
[15:50] and the devil can't there's no
[15:52] condemnation amen to them that are in
[15:54] christ jesus amen
[15:56] i had a woman emailed me from south
[15:57] africa last week and she said i'm i'm
[15:59] i'm so discouraged and uh i'm such i'm
[16:02] so backsliding all these things like
[16:03] that i said sister the bible says
[16:05] there's no condemnation in christ jesus
[16:07] see email back right away and say thank
[16:09] you that's just what i needed to hear i
[16:11] said you've got to put your faith in
[16:12] god's word not our feelings not what
[16:15] people tell us the only thing we can put
[16:17] our faith in it right here sister who is
[16:19] bible amen the holy words of god amen we
[16:22] can't trust anything else nothing else
[16:25] is trustworthy the words of god they are
[16:27] life amen
[16:29] hallelujah that's what we read last
[16:30] night
[16:31] god told moses tell the people he said
[16:34] cleave unto the lord for he is your life
[16:38] and i told my children i said your life
[16:40] really isn't uh lydia like your life
[16:42] really isn't high school math or high
[16:44] school science and working at ritman's
[16:46] orchards or whatever you know malachi
[16:49] your life really isn't high school and
[16:51] being in taekwondo and playing piano
[16:54] that's part of it but your life is in
[16:56] obeying the word of god amen because
[16:58] jesus said my words are spirit and they
[17:01] are life amen
[17:02] that's part of it right doing what god's
[17:04] called you to do but let's never see our
[17:06] lives as just something insignificant
[17:08] our lives are obedient to the word of
[17:10] god and that that way we know it pleases
[17:13] god and in everything we do god is going
[17:15] to see it god's going to reward it he's
[17:17] going to bless us and we're going to
[17:19] enjoy his presence amen
[17:22] hallelujah
[17:24] joseph what a type
[17:26] aaron what a type aaron was as a as a
[17:29] high priest and mediator of a covenant
[17:33] what a type that is of jesus christ amen
[17:35] only aaron can enter into there in the
[17:38] holy
[17:39] secure forgiveness for the people
[17:42] aaron only praise god and that's how it
[17:44] is for us jesus only can forgive my sins
[17:47] jesus only can forgive your sins and the
[17:49] bible said once and for all
[17:52] he's already entered in and obtained
[17:54] that forgiveness the bible said eternal
[17:56] inheritance the bible says he's washed
[17:58] us with a regeneration of waters by the
[18:01] word amen
[18:02] i'm regenerated hallelujah i'm a new
[18:05] creature something new is started praise
[18:08] god the oldest passed away all things
[18:10] are become new
[18:12] amen
[18:13] aaron alone jesus alone can secure it
[18:16] praise god and he has
[18:18] and that's why i like that song simon
[18:19] said just have a little talk with jesus
[18:20] i just gotta i must tell jesus praise
[18:22] god all my
[18:24] all my troubles all my sorrows if i just
[18:26] tell jesus it's all going to be all
[18:28] right
[18:29] that's very simple way to say it but
[18:30] that's the true way to say it because
[18:32] it's prayer praise god and prayer is
[18:35] what gives us the victory amen
[18:37] now also now there's so many more types
[18:39] you could use but the other side is true
[18:42] too cain
[18:43] uh would type uh the antichrist right
[18:45] because he was marked he had the mark
[18:48] right the first one to get the mark
[18:49] murdered his brother right
[18:51] cora is the type brother man said
[18:53] brother abraham said cora is a type of
[18:55] the businessman raising up in this age
[18:58] who say the fivefold ministries failed
[19:01] that's what the church age book says
[19:03] and look who's invaded the pulpits a
[19:06] tape a tape players are made of the
[19:07] popes by who businessmen
[19:10] trying to make money and trying to do
[19:11] the a1 products right
[19:13] there and they're saying the fivefold
[19:14] ministries failed so now we just got to
[19:16] get brother branham back in the pulpit
[19:18] and it goes against every command
[19:20] everything in the word of god every
[19:22] command says train other men who be
[19:25] faithful men that will be able to teach
[19:28] other men also
[19:29] amen every other promise of god said get
[19:32] a living man up there praise god but see
[19:34] we're not the core group we want to go
[19:36] back into denominationalism we want to
[19:38] go back and and we don't want to accuse
[19:40] god that that god's system has failed
[19:42] god's system cannot fail amen god's
[19:45] system is filled with conquerors amen
[19:47] more than conquerors amen their brother
[19:50] said there's nothing more powerful than
[19:52] the word of god in the lips of a
[19:54] believer amen
[19:56] hallelujah praise god so who can say
[19:58] god's five-fold ministry failed when
[20:00] jesus never said it would fail amen
[20:03] he said would bring us to the unity of
[20:05] the faith and he said it would keep us
[20:07] in the times when the waves are tossed
[20:09] to and fro those without the fightful
[20:11] ministry would be tossed to and fro but
[20:14] those with it would have an anchor for
[20:15] the soul
[20:17] that's what i know is right amen
[20:19] so i will not be the kind i'll say like
[20:21] this i'll say many people in the
[20:23] five-fold ministry have failed but that
[20:25] proves they're either disobedient or
[20:26] they were never called to it but there
[20:28] is a group of believers amen who in the
[20:31] five-fold ministry that have been
[20:33] faithful praise god and they're baptized
[20:35] with the holy ghost and they speak the
[20:37] word of god with boldness amen
[20:39] there's a small group of those kind of
[20:41] believers amen i'm glad to be one of
[20:43] them i'm glad to be one of the men he
[20:45] praised god maybe
[20:46] around this area and we're thankful for
[20:48] that and we've got to be faithful to
[20:50] that
[20:51] so we don't we don't want to be the core
[20:52] group amen
[20:54] now of course we could go through all
[20:55] the examples moses a lawgiver all these
[20:57] things i mean there's so many beautiful
[20:58] types uh noah with the with the foolish
[21:00] virgin type just a beautiful example
[21:02] there as well
[21:04] but now let's get to david here because
[21:05] i'm just trying to build a foundation
[21:06] there now remember church most shadows
[21:09] are not perfect shadows right like with
[21:11] joseph's uh 20 piece of silver versus
[21:14] jesus 30 piece of silver so we
[21:16] understand that and especially with the
[21:17] mount zion type we looked at recently
[21:19] last month we can see but see we can all
[21:22] see that god in each prophet brother
[21:24] adam says this in each prophet god was
[21:26] showing a little bit of christ's
[21:27] character
[21:28] program said a little light came out you
[21:30] know through through adam a little light
[21:32] through seth and little light you know
[21:33] abel and noah each man shined a little
[21:36] bit of light
[21:37] but when
[21:38] none of them could shine the whole light
[21:40] but he said when jesus christ came he
[21:42] reflected the full character of god amen
[21:45] we saw some good character know of it
[21:47] and we saw some bad character in noah we
[21:49] saw some good mostly good character in
[21:51] joseph but then we saw a little bit of
[21:52] line and joseph you know we we saw all
[21:54] these things but when it came to jesus
[21:56] it was all good character it was all
[21:58] word praise god it was all obedience it
[22:00] was all the father's will all the time
[22:03] amen and he perfectly manifested the
[22:06] love of god so much so you couldn't
[22:08] write enough books about it amen
[22:11] hallelujah you couldn't just you
[22:12] couldn't fill the world amen with all
[22:15] just thinking we filled this this room
[22:16] with books all about jesus you couldn't
[22:18] do it
[22:19] it wouldn't be enough church look how
[22:21] big my book was i can't even do it we
[22:23] can't even do it justice all those
[22:24] copies if you put them in here they
[22:26] still wouldn't tell all the great things
[22:28] jesus did
[22:30] oh my what a savior that we serve amen
[22:32] jesus is so great amen
[22:34] now david he says
[22:37] now i want to look at kevin j connor he
[22:39] and i showed you this picture i don't
[22:41] have it i'm not going to show it today
[22:42] but there was a picture of how david's
[22:44] life can be divided into two parts the
[22:46] part of rejection and the part of
[22:48] exaltation
[22:49] and you can see that clearly through the
[22:51] scripture let's rehearse this a bit if
[22:52] you got your bible let's get your bible
[22:54] there
[22:55] uh we'll look at a few of these
[22:56] scriptures here
[23:00] the period of rejection
[23:03] so we started there in first samuel 16.
[23:06] remember david comes as a humble an
[23:09] eighth son the youngest son
[23:13] right he's nobody special
[23:16] he's the shepherd right amen
[23:19] and uh
[23:20] we know the story i love the story
[23:22] samuel called all the sun or samuel
[23:25] called jesse get all the suns
[23:27] he didn't even think to invite david
[23:29] church people might i thought oh there's
[23:32] no way they'll be in the rapture they
[23:33] might have said there's no way jesus is
[23:35] inviting you to the rapture
[23:36] oh but little do they know praise god
[23:39] little do they know that there's a
[23:40] calling there's an ordained place that
[23:43] only you can fail amen
[23:45] there's an ordained place and others
[23:47] might have thought oh that totally
[23:48] disqualified there's never in a million
[23:50] years he's just a little small little
[23:52] ruddy cute little fella amen they just
[23:55] got a cute little smile they're just you
[23:56] know they're maybe insignificant but
[23:58] what god saw god didn't see that god saw
[24:01] the heart of a lion amen that reminds me
[24:03] of simon amen he's just a little man
[24:04] there but he's got a heart of alive
[24:07] he's witnessed any any person who
[24:09] witnessed any person no matter how big
[24:10] or whatever matter how small that's why
[24:12] i tell him he's the best man i know
[24:15] as far as my generation because you're a
[24:17] good man too
[24:18] but as far as my generation you know i
[24:20] seen them stand up to anybody praise god
[24:22] and witness to them about jesus christ
[24:24] and he's unashamed of the gospel praise
[24:26] god
[24:27] and that's how david was this little
[24:29] ruddy little man
[24:30] little little boy but god saw the heart
[24:33] god wasn't looking at the outward
[24:34] appearance amen god was looking at the
[24:36] heart amen
[24:38] children don't let anybody and even
[24:40] adults don't let anybody look on your
[24:42] outward appearance that's not what god's
[24:44] looking at god is looking at your love
[24:47] god is looking at your sincerity amen
[24:49] god's looking at your devotion god
[24:51] exalts the humble god exalts those that
[24:54] love him just wait upon the lord stay in
[24:56] your position and watch the miraculous
[24:58] amen hallelujah watch the miraculous
[25:02] come to pass hallelujah
[25:04] amen remember there's nothing more
[25:06] miraculous than a soul being saved
[25:09] right that's more like miraculous than
[25:10] anything else because the soul now has
[25:12] eternal life
[25:13] as the eternal promise hallelujah it's
[25:16] on the lamb's book of life in heaven
[25:17] amen
[25:18] we did come to that realization praise
[25:20] god
[25:21] that's right now
[25:23] he's anointed there in the midst of his
[25:25] brethren and then look he's just sent
[25:27] right back out to the field
[25:30] that's his first anointing
[25:32] amongst his brethren that's how jesus
[25:34] was too jesus was anointed among his
[25:36] brethren
[25:38] john was baptizing him and the bible
[25:40] said there's all the disciples were
[25:42] gathered around and the holy ghost
[25:44] ascended like a dove and jesus was
[25:46] anointed among his brethren
[25:48] hallelujah and john heard the voice say
[25:50] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[25:53] pleased
[25:54] hallelujah that was his and so what do
[25:57] we see we see david was a type of that
[25:59] in other words god was pleased with
[26:01] david amen god was pleased how he fought
[26:04] for those little lambs amen
[26:06] just a small little flock it wasn't a
[26:07] big flock it was a flock that a teenager
[26:09] could handle amen teenagers just be
[26:12] faithful with the little things god gave
[26:14] you amen and he'll exalt you in due
[26:16] season amen
[26:17] not to the present united states or
[26:19] something like that but to a place of
[26:21] authority amen
[26:23] where your enemies will fall or flee
[26:24] before you where you'll be able to rule
[26:27] and set up the atmosphere of christ in
[26:29] your homes later on praise god in your
[26:31] life praise god you'll be a living
[26:33] testimony a living witness with power
[26:35] and authority and god will exalt you to
[26:37] that
[26:39] amen that's what david had
[26:42] david had that heart that loved god
[26:45] and so god exalted him at the right time
[26:48] because he liked to be out there with
[26:49] the sheep he liked that simple life amen
[26:52] and god saw if he can feed my sheep out
[26:54] there my natural sheep then he can
[26:56] surely feed my human sheep
[26:59] if he can feed my animal sheep surely he
[27:01] can feed my human sheep by god's grace
[27:04] hallelujah at church that's what we
[27:06] gotta do we gotta fight for him
[27:09] hallelujah
[27:11] now so we have a period of rejection
[27:14] now notice though
[27:15] uh david
[27:17] he kept getting because of this great
[27:18] work there he's anointed
[27:20] and then we know the next thing that
[27:21] happened of course is uh
[27:24] well the bible says here i'm sorry yeah
[27:26] the barber says actually after his
[27:27] anointing he came to play harps and he
[27:30] actually cast out spirits
[27:32] from saul for a season
[27:35] he was used by god to cast out devils
[27:37] for a season the bible said he also
[27:40] became an armor bearer
[27:42] and uh refreshed the king yeah so we see
[27:46] that he conquered that's in sam first
[27:48] samuel 16. this is before he defeats
[27:50] goliath
[27:51] so in other words they can see the
[27:53] anointings on him to sing and to worship
[27:56] praise god i always remember when
[27:58] malachi when you first went to sheffield
[27:59] remember when i preached there a few
[28:00] years ago
[28:01] and malachi went up there and plucked
[28:02] around i had a man come up right after
[28:04] service he said he said brother jesse he
[28:06] said
[28:07] he said i know did you notice your son
[28:09] is anointed to play the piano
[28:11] and at that time he was just like
[28:12] plucking along you know
[28:14] and when it was after that time that
[28:16] might have been the time the anointing
[28:17] came on him amen
[28:18] right because i'm just catching it now
[28:20] amen after that time he started
[28:22] improvising and finding how he can uh
[28:24] really play well by god's grace i can't
[28:25] describe it i don't know music but all i
[28:27] just know is the bible that's all i know
[28:29] and very little of that too
[28:31] amen like i'd like to know it
[28:33] but there's a time that comes when
[28:35] people can see you're anointed praise
[28:37] god hallelujah amen we can see you're
[28:40] anointed god everybody can see if you're
[28:42] a real believer they can see your
[28:44] anointed praise god
[28:46] and then god's going to use you at
[28:48] specific times you can't force yourself
[28:50] to be used all you can do is allow
[28:52] yourself to be used amen all you can do
[28:54] is submit yourself to be used you can't
[28:57] force it you can try the best you can
[28:58] you can just be just got to be humble
[29:00] and wait and when it's god's time the
[29:02] devil can't stop it amen
[29:05] hallelujah
[29:07] but i'll never forget that when that man
[29:08] said that in fact it's brother ray so
[29:10] i'll just tell you because i know i'm
[29:10] thinking about it brother ray come after
[29:13] that that's before he started coming
[29:14] here
[29:15] he said that boy's anointed i said yeah
[29:17] i know he is
[29:18] and he was just plucking at that time
[29:20] hallelujah that's a good reminder but
[29:23] then it was after that
[29:25] that
[29:26] his dad sent him and defeated goliath
[29:29] and remember i showed you the quote
[29:30] brother the man said he was a prophet he
[29:31] knew he was going to defeat goliath
[29:34] church when you know you're going to win
[29:35] you act differently
[29:37] right when you know how it's going to go
[29:40] when you know the end from the beginning
[29:42] you act differently praise god right
[29:45] that's how david that's why he can act
[29:46] like that what's the reward going to be
[29:48] he asked yes his brothers remember cam
[29:50] preached out to you young people he went
[29:52] past the discouragement of his brothers
[29:54] then he went past the army then he even
[29:56] went past the king and then he went
[29:58] through goliath as well praise god
[30:01] he went through four layers oh there's
[30:03] those four horse riders brother
[30:05] amen he went through every one of those
[30:08] devils amen and he conquered them how by
[30:11] the word of god the prophetic word of
[30:13] god he knew what the bible said in
[30:14] church we know what the bible says amen
[30:17] we know the bride can't be stopped we
[30:19] know she's promised a rescuing from
[30:21] laodicea amen
[30:23] so let us be strong and of course amen
[30:26] and not fear i've been guilty of that
[30:27] these last two years with covert i've
[30:29] been guilty of wondering you know uh uh
[30:32] what's going to happen i've been too at
[30:34] times i've been too worried about that
[30:36] but god is calling us to live above that
[30:38] fear praise god god is calling us not to
[30:40] fear what man shall do to us praise god
[30:43] fear not what man can do but fear god
[30:46] who made the soul praise god
[30:48] hallelujah
[30:50] yeah we're all fighting we're all
[30:51] battling
[30:53] and i know god is going to help us to
[30:54] overcome praise god
[30:56] he will not leave himself without a
[30:58] witness hallelujah
[30:59] and so david gets the victory right
[31:02] and notice after that church did you
[31:03] know he was set over the men of war
[31:06] imagine a teenager like malachi
[31:10] he's in charge of men like me i'm 41.
[31:13] now i'm 41.
[31:16] uh and can imagine i'm i'm saluting
[31:18] malachi and he's my he's my senior
[31:20] officer yes sir yeah i'll go do that
[31:22] right now sir thank you sir
[31:23] all these older men
[31:25] because of the courage it wasn't because
[31:27] of his physical stature he was a small
[31:29] ready man he's a lot like uh samson amen
[31:32] a paradox but it's because the anointing
[31:34] came upon him and he was a man of faith
[31:37] he was a worker of miracles amen
[31:40] hallelujah and they saw the anointing on
[31:42] him he wasn't afraid of devils
[31:44] in the presence of devils he started
[31:46] worshiping god
[31:47] he started singing to god and the evil
[31:49] spirits believed that's how a man knows
[31:52] how to fight he knows how to fight the
[31:53] devil with praising the lord
[31:56] oh my
[31:57] hallelujah
[31:58] that's how we overcome too by praising
[32:00] the lord
[32:01] thank the lord
[32:03] and the bible said he behaved himself
[32:05] wisely
[32:06] and he was accepted and loved by
[32:08] everyone in the palace
[32:11] this mighty victor
[32:12] right but then saul became jealous in
[32:16] church that's what a lot of happens in
[32:17] message churches or any church anytime
[32:20] there's a schism between people you know
[32:22] they're butting heads it's probably
[32:23] because of jealousy
[32:24] because they're both listen they're both
[32:26] saved and forgiven by the blood
[32:29] right we talked about church problems
[32:31] you know and things like that in
[32:32] different places around the world
[32:34] how come people are butting heads
[32:35] they're supposed to have the love of god
[32:37] in fact that's what the bible said was
[32:39] shed the bible says the love of god was
[32:41] shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[32:43] ghost amen and if people can't love each
[32:46] other both say they've got the love of
[32:47] god there's something wrong a other
[32:49] spirit an evil spirit a lying spirit has
[32:52] god in there praise god
[32:54] and that's what happened to saul he was
[32:55] anointed man he did great works david
[32:58] was doing great works they could have
[32:59] been a powerful team think about that
[33:01] what a team that would have been
[33:03] king saul up there real humble obeying
[33:05] the word getting the victory and david
[33:07] as his his general praise god oh what a
[33:10] team they could have been
[33:12] but god was showing this is a
[33:14] denominational man versus a real
[33:16] spiritual man
[33:18] the denominational man was jealous
[33:20] and i don't say it like this i'm not
[33:22] jealous we don't want to be jealous of
[33:24] anybody we're happy for people when we
[33:26] hear testimonies of the message praise
[33:28] the lord amen
[33:29] the bible says when one part of the body
[33:31] rejoices everybody rejoices we ought to
[33:34] give god praise when somebody has a
[33:35] testimony a burning hot fire testimony
[33:38] from another church let's not be jealous
[33:40] let's be thankful
[33:43] but saul couldn't do that
[33:45] saul got bitter jealousy right
[33:47] so much so that he wasted the rest of
[33:49] his life
[33:50] chasing down david remember i showed you
[33:52] that last week
[33:54] last wednesday how when when saul died
[33:57] david wept and cried and he said he's
[34:00] mighty like an eagle
[34:02] he was fierce like a lion they were
[34:04] swift like eagles a man that wanted to
[34:06] kill you
[34:08] think about has anybody ever wanted to
[34:09] kill you ever got a death threat from
[34:11] anybody
[34:12] well i haven't either thank god
[34:15] i know preachers that have but
[34:18] imagine getting a death threat from so
[34:20] and so let's just say
[34:22] let's say ned okay because nobody's
[34:24] named ned
[34:25] but then when ned dies you're like oh
[34:27] what a wonderful man ned was yet he
[34:29] chased me down for 13 years
[34:30] what was that a type of jesus christ ah
[34:33] father forgive them they don't know what
[34:35] they're doing they're my brethren amen
[34:39] this is why david was such a type of
[34:41] jesus christ
[34:46] see even his enemies that of course he
[34:48] knew they weren't enemies at the
[34:49] beginning but because saul became his
[34:51] enemy he even wept over his enemies
[34:54] demise and he twice could have taken it
[34:57] from him twice he could have been the
[34:58] pastor can i say like that i think
[35:00] brother brahma said that it's wise he
[35:02] could have been the leader of the group
[35:04] by his own by his own strength he could
[35:06] have taken it but he knew better
[35:09] now look how later he took bathsheba
[35:10] look how he did that
[35:12] right
[35:14] twice he could have took it and was
[35:16] humble enough to say
[35:17] it's going to be in god's time not my
[35:18] time
[35:20] god never told me to kill somebody to
[35:21] become king
[35:22] god just told me i'd be king
[35:25] right
[35:26] but here he takes another man's wife
[35:29] and then brings all this blood upon his
[35:31] family
[35:33] see got off in the flesh got a little
[35:35] complacent right
[35:37] he was not in the place where he should
[35:38] have been in the springtime the kings
[35:40] went out to battle
[35:41] but he was not where he should have been
[35:44] remember that high lofty temple that and
[35:46] house that he built it became a snare to
[35:48] him
[35:49] the church said
[35:51] sometimes the things we get in this
[35:52] earth sometimes they become a snare to
[35:54] us
[35:55] the very house that took him seven years
[35:56] to build i believe it was or maybe that
[35:58] was solomon however many years it took
[35:59] to build that house in zion
[36:01] the city of god it became a snare to him
[36:03] when he was out of his place
[36:05] because it was from that position he
[36:07] could look down and see bathsheba
[36:09] if he just had a normal regular house
[36:11] like everybody he would not have seen
[36:12] bathsheba
[36:14] right
[36:15] sometimes our position and power and
[36:17] authority
[36:18] can be a hindrance to us if we're not in
[36:20] position amen if we're not in spiritual
[36:22] position praise god
[36:24] that's why there's sin amongst pastors
[36:26] and and
[36:28] politicians anyone with authority
[36:31] if their character is not christ-like
[36:33] character they'll fall into disgrace
[36:37] because power without character is
[36:39] satanic
[36:41] satanic
[36:42] power without character is satanic
[36:46] praise god
[36:47] now we're twice in his life here david
[36:50] knew not to touch god's anointed
[36:53] now after a while after running for his
[36:55] life finally we know saul passed away
[36:59] and he died for his transgression
[37:01] remember the bible said that god took
[37:03] his mercy from saul
[37:06] now
[37:06] how
[37:08] how awful would someone have to live in
[37:10] order for god to say i'm done giving you
[37:12] mercy
[37:13] well saul is the example
[37:15] we'd say what was it
[37:17] 12 or 15 years of chasing down david
[37:19] finally at the end god said and then he
[37:21] saw then he saw the necromancer he went
[37:23] to the uh the witchcraft lady the witch
[37:26] of endor
[37:27] after that god said then i'm just done
[37:30] i i'm taking my mercy from you and i'm
[37:32] giving the kingdom to david
[37:35] see there comes a time when god says
[37:36] i've had enough of this
[37:38] right you've had enough times to repent
[37:40] you had enough opportunities to repent
[37:42] but random said if you have one slight
[37:44] desire to serve jesus christ he said you
[37:47] ought to be the happiest person on the
[37:48] earth hallelujah because saul
[37:52] all those years he must he must have
[37:54] blew past that conscience he must he
[37:56] must have just filled his mind he gave a
[37:58] place to the devil in his mind
[38:00] that he had to take down david he had to
[38:02] kill david or david was against him and
[38:04] the whole time david was four and praise
[38:06] god let me say this church
[38:08] no matter who's against you god is for
[38:10] you
[38:12] god will give you his mercy as long as
[38:14] you keep a pure heart praise
[38:16] god what is the conclusion of the matter
[38:19] simon the conclusion of matter is to
[38:21] fear god and keep his commandments amen
[38:25] david feared god he wouldn't touch his
[38:27] anointed
[38:29] and so god honored him and exalted him
[38:31] into a mighty degree
[38:33] hallelujah
[38:35] he brought him out of the shepherd's
[38:37] field
[38:38] into the core of the king praise god
[38:41] what a trip amen
[38:43] what a change of scenery praise god
[38:47] out in the fields and then now in the
[38:49] presence of the king
[38:51] and then out
[38:52] hiding out in caves
[38:54] with a bunch of distressed people
[38:56] remember the bible said the distressed
[38:57] the poor and all those came to david
[38:59] there and said we're joining your team
[39:01] that was me amen that was me joining
[39:03] jesus amen god's god's rejected king
[39:06] amen that was me joining jesus those
[39:08] gentile warriors praise god
[39:10] hallelujah
[39:14] but finally church david came to
[39:16] exaltation
[39:19] after saul's death
[39:21] david was anointed and he ruled over the
[39:24] kingdom of judah
[39:26] and the bible said he reigned seven and
[39:28] a half years in hebron
[39:31] just over judah and during that time
[39:33] like i said the bible said that he wax
[39:36] stronger and stronger and saul's nation
[39:38] wax weaker and weaker now church that's
[39:41] what we got to watch we got to watch our
[39:42] fight what was our fight like for jesus
[39:45] in 2021
[39:46] i hope it was stronger than 2020.
[39:50] right we have to honestly look and more
[39:51] people i'll tell you if more people did
[39:53] some new year's resolutions i know we
[39:55] always mock it and make fun of it we
[39:57] blast new year's resolutions right but
[39:58] if more people would just take 10
[40:00] minutes
[40:02] and reflect did i get stronger in the
[40:04] faith
[40:05] in the previous year or not and then if
[40:07] it's or not what changes am i going to
[40:09] make through prayer
[40:12] that's a good that's a good leap to turn
[40:13] over right there
[40:15] hallelujah we should get stronger and
[40:17] stronger in the faith praise god
[40:20] we should have a purpose in our lives we
[40:22] should we know we should know what we're
[40:24] fighting for
[40:25] praise god
[40:26] we should know who our enemy is amen we
[40:29] should know who our allies are amen
[40:31] pray for me brother
[40:33] pray for me sister i need prayer amen
[40:35] pray for me brother
[40:37] i'm in the valley decision praise god
[40:39] i know who's fighting for me i know
[40:41] who's with me praise god i know who's in
[40:43] the lord's army amen
[40:47] why why should we get weaker when we
[40:49] have every access to every strength god
[40:51] has ever offered us amen
[40:54] hallelujah
[40:55] i know about you i hope you can say the
[40:57] same but i know i'm stronger this year
[40:59] see because the enemy always comes in
[41:01] like a flood but the spirit of god
[41:03] always raises the standard against it
[41:04] praise god right and so i know if i'm
[41:07] standing here like i love that david
[41:09] scripture i know the lord favors me
[41:11] because he has not allowed his my
[41:13] enemies to triumph over me
[41:15] hallelujah i'm going to keep quoting
[41:17] that one in 2022.
[41:19] that's how i know the lord's with me
[41:20] praise god because he doesn't let my
[41:22] enemies defeat me
[41:27] now i could say more but let me skip
[41:29] ahead here let's look at some of the
[41:32] the types here now what's interesting
[41:34] church is that both david i'm sorry i'll
[41:37] start with him moses david and jesus
[41:39] went through this the beginning of their
[41:41] lives was rejection
[41:44] and then at some point they their lives
[41:46] ascended into exaltation by god
[41:49] and ministry
[41:50] right so moses was first a shepherd
[41:53] after his rejection
[41:54] right that was really his rejection
[41:56] 40 years
[41:58] right so he had to be rejected that's
[42:00] when the spiritual thing started
[42:01] happening right when he was rejected and
[42:03] left egypt that was a period of
[42:05] rejection but then he had a burning bush
[42:07] experience amen
[42:09] and that changed the whole course of his
[42:12] life oh church i hope you can recognize
[42:14] where was your burning bush
[42:16] when did you meet the pillar of fire
[42:18] amen where was your burning bush that
[42:20] ought to have been a total change of
[42:22] life amen
[42:24] moses his whole life amen hallelujah 40
[42:27] years in the kingdom of egypt praise god
[42:30] was all forgotten in five minutes in the
[42:33] prince of the holy ghost amen
[42:35] that's how i know i'm a new creation i'm
[42:38] a brand new man because when i met the
[42:40] pillar of fire everything else passed
[42:42] away and now god has used me in the
[42:44] ministry for his glory
[42:47] amen
[42:48] and everything else i've forgotten
[42:50] there's no emphasis on denomination
[42:51] there's no real emphasis on education
[42:54] the emphasis is on revelation amen
[42:57] hallelujah
[42:58] it's a stage
[43:00] everyone's got to be rejected
[43:02] and they got to come and meet the
[43:04] burning bush before they're exalted into
[43:06] ministry
[43:08] in other words if you're born again
[43:10] you've already gone through that
[43:11] rejection stage and now god's exalting
[43:13] you in your spiritual authority
[43:16] yes
[43:18] hallelujah
[43:21] i could say something i better hold that
[43:22] here my god's grace
[43:25] i'm asked to save it for another time
[43:26] but moses was first a shepherd then a
[43:29] king
[43:30] and then a builder of the tabernacle he
[43:32] was rejected and then exalted
[43:35] praise god
[43:38] remember he was such a king church that
[43:40] remember god said i'm going to destroy
[43:42] all israel i'm going to start a new race
[43:43] with you
[43:45] right
[43:46] he was such a ruler
[43:48] david was the same he's first a shepherd
[43:50] then a king and then a builder of the
[43:52] tabernacle because they would build a
[43:55] tabernacle
[43:56] not a not a temple a tabernacle just
[43:59] like moses we'll get to that lord that's
[44:00] why i know this is inspired because
[44:01] there's things i need to get to and i
[44:03] think i need to get there where david
[44:05] built the tabernacle
[44:08] and then jesus was first a shepherd
[44:11] right in his earthly life
[44:13] wasn't he called the good shepherd
[44:15] didn't he call himself the good shepherd
[44:17] i'm the good shepherd amen
[44:21] and now he's king right
[44:25] and i'm sorry then he's king king of
[44:26] saints because he he's king over death
[44:28] hell in the grave
[44:29] and now he's priests praise god
[44:32] he's high priest over the whole house of
[44:35] god amen
[44:37] so we can see
[44:38] shepherds kings and then priests
[44:42] we can see that order how many can see
[44:43] that order tonight
[44:45] let me try to find a place here where i
[44:46] can get
[44:47] uh to spot to close
[44:50] now notice all these men are called the
[44:52] anointed ones
[44:54] right
[44:55] david is called the lord's anointed
[44:57] when the oil was poured upon him he's
[44:59] called the lord's anointed
[45:02] jesus was called the the christ the
[45:04] anointed
[45:05] praise god
[45:07] they were anointed or empowered
[45:10] by the holy spirit to do their ministry
[45:13] praise god
[45:15] now we saw david's first anointing was
[45:17] in the presence of his brothers praise
[45:19] god his second anointing let's go to
[45:21] second samuel 2 4.
[45:23] let's look at a second anointing
[45:32] second samuel 2 4. here's a second
[45:34] anointing
[45:40] 2nd samuel 2 4.
[45:51] and the men of judah came and there they
[45:53] anointed david king over the house of
[45:55] judah and they told david saying that
[45:58] the men of jabash gilead were they that
[46:02] buried saul
[46:03] praise god
[46:08] so here he is anointed a second time
[46:12] so we see the first time anointed as a
[46:14] shepherd second time he's anointed king
[46:17] over one tribe
[46:21] and let's look at his third time
[46:23] anointed go to second samuel five so
[46:25] yeah that's interesting his second
[46:26] anointing is in chapter two third
[46:28] anointings in chapter five
[46:29] verses one to
[46:31] three one two and three
[46:33] second samuel five one two and three
[46:39] then came all the tribes of israel to
[46:41] david unto hebron and spake saying
[46:42] behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
[46:45] also in times past when saul was king
[46:47] over us thou was he
[46:50] that led us out and brought us in israel
[46:52] and the lord said to thee thou shalt
[46:54] feed my people israel and thou shalt be
[46:56] a captain
[46:58] over the people. now i like that church
[47:00] i like that because that encourages you
[47:01] and i
[47:04] the bible said
[47:05] in the book of proverbs that a good name
[47:09] is better than precious riches
[47:11] so david wouldn't have riches at first
[47:13] but he had a good name
[47:16] in other words everybody could trust him
[47:18] he was a man of integrity praise god
[47:22] and so when the time came they needed
[47:23] somebody here's a man who lived the life
[47:25] before them and it was the holy spirit
[47:29] that led them to the obvious choice
[47:31] anoint david king over all israel he's
[47:34] got the backing of the prophet amen
[47:37] the prophet's behind him samuel praise
[47:39] god of course samuel died but but he had
[47:41] the word of the prophet behind him and
[47:43] he had this godly testimony waiting all
[47:46] these years to be king
[47:48] right so if he got the victory i think
[47:50] they say around 15 or 17.
[47:53] so 15 years he waited to be king over
[47:55] judah and now he's 37 or 38.
[47:59] all these years well that would be 22
[48:01] years
[48:03] he's walk before him and integrity a man
[48:05] after god's own heart he's overcome his
[48:07] rejecters he's overcome all the haters
[48:10] amen
[48:12] he's rude uh judah well all by himself
[48:14] you know this little little tribe and
[48:16] finally everybody can see it's time to
[48:18] anoint this guy in other words live a
[48:20] life of integrity and then when it's
[48:22] god's time god will exalt you praise god
[48:26] to a third anointing i wonder if that's
[48:28] the three polls there
[48:29] i wonder it seems like it
[48:32] because the brotherhood said even jesus
[48:34] had three polls to his ministry
[48:36] that would make sense but man said paul
[48:38] had three polls to his ministry
[48:40] so that must mean everybody has three
[48:42] polls to their ministry or something
[48:43] like that there must be some type of
[48:45] correlation
[48:48] where you have three aspects
[48:50] everything's perfected in threes right
[48:53] so david here a third time is anointed
[48:58] and he takes over now all israel and as
[49:01] we saw he was always a man after the
[49:03] heart of god now let's close with a few
[49:05] thoughts here it's got a few scriptures
[49:11] so the first anointing was the prophet
[49:13] anointing
[49:14] where david could write psalms amen
[49:16] where he could sing and cast out devils
[49:18] where he knew he'd get the victory over
[49:20] goliath
[49:22] he knew god was with him and god was
[49:24] never going to leave him the second
[49:26] anointing was the anointing here
[49:28] of the kings and this is the anointing
[49:31] of ruling and reigning
[49:33] so first he had a prophetic ministry of
[49:35] the word amen
[49:37] hallelujah
[49:39] so his prophet ministry was the word
[49:42] his king ministry was ruling and
[49:44] reigning
[49:46] right
[49:48] the third ministry
[49:50] is the ministry of reconciliation praise
[49:53] god
[49:55] reconciling the people back to god
[49:59] can't you see can we see that church the
[50:01] people were all scattered only one tribe
[50:02] was following david but when he got that
[50:04] third anointing israel was reconciled
[50:07] back to god amen
[50:09] back to the same condition as when
[50:11] joshua almost when joshua was the leader
[50:13] praise god
[50:16] so the ministry of the word and then the
[50:18] ministry of ruling and reigning and then
[50:20] the ministry of reconciliation praise
[50:23] god
[50:24] reconciling the people back to god
[50:27] and i imagine that's the role we see in
[50:28] all of our lives
[50:31] praise god first we're anointed with the
[50:32] word we'll witness to anybody about the
[50:34] word
[50:35] we'll be so anointed sometimes we'll
[50:37] lose our wisdom
[50:38] and we want to argue and debate with
[50:40] people
[50:41] because we got the word everybody should
[50:43] be able to see this brother right that's
[50:44] what we sister everybody should be able
[50:46] to see this truth that's that's what i
[50:47] thought i don't know about you
[50:49] i thought everybody could see it what's
[50:51] wrong with them
[50:53] you can just write write plain right
[50:54] there in the bible says they're about
[50:55] makeup it's about water baptism is right
[50:57] it's one god right there in the bible
[50:58] amen why can't people see that
[51:02] but then after a while you start getting
[51:04] some trials
[51:05] and the holy spirit shows you you need
[51:07] to rule and reign over sin
[51:10] all right pretty soon
[51:11] things cool off right you don't see your
[51:14] mom don't see your dad as much don't see
[51:15] that cousin too much that i used to
[51:17] argue with
[51:19] and then it's now it's just you and the
[51:20] devil right
[51:21] right now
[51:22] you're just battling the enemy in your
[51:23] daily life
[51:25] and you've got to rule over that praise
[51:27] god
[51:27] you've got to stand there and rule over
[51:29] satan and stand the bible said having
[51:31] done all to stand amen
[51:34] to take the promised land to take the
[51:36] possessions that god has given to our
[51:38] young sisters and our young sons amen
[51:40] and daughters amen
[51:44] take possession at school amen
[51:47] our children have the ability to change
[51:48] the atmosphere of the classroom amen
[51:51] that's something nature and virtue you
[51:52] can possess that praise god
[51:55] when maokai's on that when you're on
[51:57] those video calls lydia you can change
[51:58] the atmosphere there
[52:00] that's right
[52:02] you can just walk you can just turn on
[52:03] the click a button and you change the
[52:04] atmosphere
[52:06] you can rule and reign over that praise
[52:08] god i know naomi can change it on the
[52:09] phone right right if you got an upset
[52:11] customer
[52:12] you can with a with a the kind word the
[52:14] bible said takes away wrath
[52:17] you can just change the atmosphere real
[52:19] fast
[52:21] see you're learning how to rule and
[52:22] reign not just fight all the time and
[52:25] i'll fight you with the word and i've
[52:26] got i got the truth
[52:29] but now pretty soon you've got to learn
[52:30] how to rule and reign with wisdom
[52:34] and you have to possess the promises
[52:36] that god has given to you
[52:39] and the last stage is bringing
[52:41] reconciliation to the people
[52:44] and to god
[52:45] hallelujah remember the bible says that
[52:48] paul says we are under the ministry of
[52:49] reconciliation
[52:51] that is our desire to reconcile to bring
[52:54] people back to god that's what this
[52:56] church is for to reconcile all of us to
[52:58] god it's the word of god that brings us
[53:01] reconciliation praise god it's the
[53:03] preaching of the word amen that raises
[53:05] our faith hallelujah it's the goodness
[53:07] of god that leads us to repentance
[53:11] reconciling us back to god that's what

[54:43] is to bring reconciliation
[54:46] between god and men
[54:50] second corinthians 5

[55:02] things that are passed away behold all
[55:04] things are become new and all things are
[55:06] of god who hath reconciled us to himself
[55:08] by jesus christ and has given to us what
[55:11] the ministry of
[55:12] reconciliation
[55:16] to it that god was in christ
[55:19] reconciling the world unto himself
[55:21] how do you do it how did he reconcile
[55:23] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[55:26] and have committed unto us what the word
[55:29] of reconciliation
[55:31] be reconciled with god that should be
[55:33] our that should be our our plea

[55:54] this is our ministry the bible said
[55:56] that's what we're called to do
[55:59] let's search down search is that
[56:00] beautiful
[56:01] if you and i wonder what's our ministry
[56:04] there's where it is right there
[56:06] and i feel like if you do that then
[56:08] you'll find out your other nine gifts of
[56:09] the holy spirit don't you think if
[56:11] you're trying to win souls all the time
[56:12] and plead people back to the house of
[56:14] god pray for people to be reconciled to
[56:15] god don't you think god's going to use
[56:17] you
[56:18] some type of gift and you'll kind of see
[56:19] what gift you have
[56:21] if you don't know already
[56:23] right

[56:27] reconciliation so who can i think about
[56:30] tonight who can i pray for tonight that
[56:32] needs reconcile back to god
[56:36] that's a great question
[56:38] and that's what we should be asking
[56:39] ourselves
[56:43] so moses and david prophet
[56:45] king and then priest
[56:49] prophet king
[56:50] priest
[56:53] so the ministry of the word the ministry
[56:56] of authority reigning and ruling and the
[56:58] ministry of reconciliation also
[57:00] intercession prayer
[57:02] worship and praise unto god
[57:05] that's what the reconciliation is
[57:07] because that's what they did when the
[57:09] ark came into the city of david i didn't
[57:12] hear you praise god because that was
[57:13] after the third anointing amen
[57:16] after that third anointing remember he
[57:17] went right up to zion took zion and then
[57:20] what'd they do immediately they brought
[57:22] the ark into the place why so they could
[57:24] worship god and they could reconcile the
[57:26] people unto god
[57:29] amen
[57:32] let's stand to our feet i better stop
[57:34] right there
[57:35] reconciling the people back to god
[57:40] musicians can come
[57:46] you know there's quotes where brother
[57:47] brahm says what's the evidence of the
[57:48] holy ghost you know there's some quotes
[57:50] he calls it he says soul travail
[57:53] remember those quotes brother
[57:56] he said when i see a soul that's in
[57:58] travail for other souls a soul that just
[58:00] wants to do something for god
[58:02] he said that's a real sign a person's
[58:04] born again
[58:07] isn't that the ministry of
[58:08] reconciliation
[58:10] having a burden for souls
[58:13] and this is what we see with these three
[58:15] anointings on david
[58:17] prophet
[58:18] ruler
[58:19] reconciliation
[58:21] let's get the let's get the ark of god

[58:48] anointing of the holy ghost right the
[58:50] ministry of reconciliation isn't that
[58:52] beautiful never know what it's going to
[58:53] be do you church we never know unless
[58:55] god gives us a little prophecy

[59:24] preachers who don't go to the second
[59:25] stage can't do the third stage
[59:28] right
[59:29] preachers that don't rule and reign over
[59:31] sin there's no way they can reconcile
[59:33] the god people to god because they're
