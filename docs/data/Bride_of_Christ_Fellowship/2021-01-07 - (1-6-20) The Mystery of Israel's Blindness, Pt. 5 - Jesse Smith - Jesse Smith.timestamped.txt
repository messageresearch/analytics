[28:36] and three score in two weeks the street
[28:38] shall be built again
[28:40] and the wall even in troubles times
[28:44] and after three score in two weeks shall
[28:45] messiah be cut off
[28:47] but not for himself and the people of
[28:50] the prince
[28:51] that shall come shall destroy the city
[28:54] and the sanctuary
[28:55] and the end thereof shall be with a
[28:58] flood and unto the end of the war
[29:00] desolations are determined
[29:03] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[29:05] many for one week
[29:07] in the midst of the week he shall cause
[29:09] the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
[29:11] and for the overspreading of
[29:12] abominations he shall make it desolate

[31:22] you can switch over here i just have a
[31:24] few quotes eventually you want to get to
[31:26] daniel 70 weeks
[31:28] i'm not going to go real depth in depth
[31:30] into it i'm just going to show how it's
[31:31] a little different than my previous
[31:33] understanding
[31:36] okay so like i said i'm not going to i'm
[31:40] going to set my timer too i guess
[31:41] i set my timer sunday and then i turn it
[31:43] off i didn't even realize what i was
[31:44] doing so
[31:45] i'll try to watch it to better tonight
[31:47] here
[31:49] i'll set up for 45 minutes that would be
[31:51] great if i get done in 45 minutes
[31:54] so let's uh look to the word of god here
[31:57] tonight so
[31:59] i'm about halfway done with the final
[32:00] book i'm just about halfway done with
[32:02] all the final edits i'm reading through
[32:04] it
[32:04] about an hour of morning and uh making
[32:06] little edits and corrections and
[32:08] everything about i'm about halfway done
[32:10] i think tomorrow i'll be halfway done so
[32:13] it's coming along slowly but i'm
[32:14] enjoying
[32:15] staying in the word of god now let's
[32:18] tonight uh
[32:19] let's pick up where we left off we
[32:20] picked up with i'm sorry we left off
[32:23] with god's covenant with israel through
[32:24] abraham and we saw
[32:26] uh we ended how god tries to convince
[32:29] backsliding israel his love by
[32:33] referencing the steadfastness of the
[32:34] sunlight moon stars and
[32:36] oceans all right now i want to just
[32:39] break into just a real quick
[32:40] lesson this is more for those who well
[32:43] it's for everybody
[32:44] but it's i think it's a good
[32:45] understanding about uh dispensations
[32:47] versus
[32:48] covenants now i don't know if you're
[32:50] familiar with this but dispensation
[32:52] the way we use it is a modern term okay
[32:55] we use it like
[32:56] oh the dispensation of the gentiles or
[32:58] the dispensation of the jews
[33:00] actually if you study the bible
[33:01] dispensation only refers
[33:03] to paul's ministry to the gentiles so
[33:06] we're going to look at that tonight
[33:09] uh but if somebody asked me brother
[33:10] jesse do you believe in the dispensation
[33:11] of gentiles i'd say yes with the modern
[33:13] definition
[33:14] but with the bible definition uh the
[33:17] bible jesus calls it the times of the
[33:19] gentiles
[33:20] okay the actual word dispensation in the
[33:22] bible uh it actually means
[33:24] a stewardship that was given to paul and
[33:27] i'm going to prove it to you tonight so
[33:28] let's uh
[33:29] let's look to the word of god now first
[33:31] corinthians 9. let's go to first
[33:32] corinthians 9 17.
[33:33] maybe lydia maokai can do some reading
[33:35] for me trying to
[33:36] watch my voice because i've been at
[33:38] school this week and uh
[33:40] uh nature how's school going this week
[33:42] good yeah having fun
[33:44] learning a little bit okay
[33:47] praise the lord yeah we're kind of
[33:50] getting back in the swing of it
[33:51] yeah i got more kids in the classroom
[33:52] now so it's a little more busy
[33:54] uh that's good it's good to teach
[33:58] children and show them jesus is love all
[34:00] right first corinthians 9
[34:01] 17. now watch carefully church the
[34:05] the language paul uses and you'll see
[34:08] what i mean
[34:09] there's only four scriptures in the
[34:10] bible that talk about dispensation
[34:12] there's only four
[34:14] and they're all refer three of them
[34:15] refer to paul and then one of them
[34:18] talks about the dispensation of the
[34:19] fullness of times
[34:22] so this is so we use dispensation i said
[34:24] in a fairly modern terminology
[34:27] uh which deals with uh a dispensation
[34:30] like a time period but in the bible
[34:32] that's not really what it means
[34:34] so first corinthians 9 17 malachi or i'm
[34:36] sorry
[34:37] malcolm can you read that for us
[34:49] okay a dispensation is committed to who
[34:51] to paul
[34:52] now the word dispensation means
[34:54] stewardship all right
[34:56] so someone that's a steward or like a
[34:58] overseer or something
[35:00] right so paul says
[35:03] a dispensation of stewardship is
[35:05] committed unto me
[35:08] all right now this same word is used in
[35:10] jesus's parable of the
[35:12] unjust steward uh in luke 16.
[35:16] so the steward again is a dispensation
[35:19] the unjust
[35:20] person who had the dispensation he
[35:21] wasn't faithful with his
[35:23] stewardship okay so paul says i have a
[35:26] stewardship to oversee
[35:28] uh the ministry to the gentiles all
[35:30] right now
[35:31] ephesians 1 verse 10 lydia ephesians 1
[35:34] 10. and then malachi can you go to
[35:37] ephesians 3 verse 2.
[35:40] so lydia go ahead ephesians 1 10.
[35:51] okay so this is the one where paul is
[35:52] speaking god has one dispensation of
[35:56] all the times so this is a perfect
[35:58] example of stewardship
[36:00] god has one overseeing or one
[36:02] stewardship
[36:03] of all the times okay and the bible says
[36:06] he'll gather them all in christ in the
[36:08] new jerusalem
[36:10] when all heaven and earth are subject
[36:12] unto him so this is speaking of god's
[36:14] one dispensation god is the overseer of
[36:17] every time period praise god
[36:19] remember paul said i have a stewardship
[36:21] of the gospel committed to me
[36:23] this one says god has one great
[36:25] stewardship i'm glad god's in control of
[36:27] this kingdom and we aren't praise god
[36:29] because he's going to make sure this
[36:30] kingdom stands amen
[36:32] now uh next one is ephesians 3 2 malachi
[36:44] all right so who was it given to paul
[36:47] who was his stewardship given to
[36:48] paul so again notice he says each time
[36:51] it's given to me
[36:52] i'm overseeing this uh the so the paul's
[36:55] dispensation
[36:56] is him uh teaching the gentiles the
[36:58] revelation
[37:00] of jesus christ it's a stewardship given
[37:02] to him
[37:04] okay so next one lydia colossians 1 25
[37:08] is the last final scripture on
[37:10] dispensation then we've read all four of
[37:12] them
[37:13] so you can see dispensation is not used
[37:15] in the bible the way we use it today
[37:17] okay lady go ahead colossians 1 25.
[37:27] okay so each time paul says it's given
[37:28] to me i have a dispensation given
[37:31] to me and then the fourth time he said
[37:33] god has a dispensation
[37:35] given over the entire time period of
[37:38] world history
[37:40] praise god so
[37:43] this is more of a technical point but i
[37:45] just wanted to make it known that
[37:47] it's best referred to the time of the
[37:49] gentiles is best referred to as the
[37:50] seven church ages
[37:52] or the times of the gentiles the bible
[37:54] doesn't use the word dispensation for
[37:56] the full time period
[37:57] it refers to paul's ministry or
[38:00] stewardship
[38:01] to take the gospel to the gentiles so if
[38:04] people argue and say there's no such
[38:06] thing as dispensations you know they
[38:08] they have a certain they have a certain
[38:09] point they're making there the point is
[38:11] that paul had that dispensation that
[38:13] oversight
[38:14] that stewardship right so for example it
[38:17] wasn't given to you and i
[38:18] to take the gospel to the gentiles right
[38:20] it wasn't our stewardship
[38:21] right we're just continuing what paul's
[38:24] stewardship
[38:25] started okay so it's just a technical
[38:27] term but i know
[38:28] those two students who love the word of
[38:30] god i know you appreciate things like
[38:31] that
[38:32] the dispensation only has four verses as
[38:34] we said
[38:35] three of them deal with paul one of them
[38:37] deals with god's dispensation god's
[38:39] stewardship
[38:40] but if someone said oh what about this
[38:41] dispensation of the gentiles i'd say
[38:43] okay
[38:44] if you're just referring to the church
[38:45] ages the night you're using a modern
[38:47] definition
[38:48] you're not exactly using the bible
[38:49] definition and i could understand what
[38:51] they're talking about okay
[38:53] all right now uh i want to move past
[38:56] that i just wanted to quickly go over
[38:57] that
[38:58] now there's eight covenants now i
[39:00] preached these uh when
[39:01] the coronavirus struck the first time in
[39:03] march and april i don't know if we did
[39:04] some bible studies on our porch you guys
[39:05] remember that
[39:06] okay so i'm not gonna preach those again
[39:08] i'm just gonna review them there's eight
[39:09] covenants that i've found
[39:11] uh brother brahm didn't say seven or
[39:13] eight covenants he just said there was
[39:15] lots of covenants so some people say or
[39:18] clarence larkin says there's seven
[39:20] covenants i think there's eight
[39:22] uh okay so the first one is eden
[39:24] covenant where's she
[39:25] see that over there there's the eden
[39:28] covenant which is
[39:29] made with adam and eve before sin came
[39:31] in the next one after sin is that
[39:34] adamic covenant between adam and eve
[39:37] fallen
[39:37] and god the third one is the noahic
[39:40] covenant
[39:41] noahik covenant i think that's how you
[39:42] say it that's where god's not going to
[39:44] destroy it by a flood anymore
[39:46] the fourth is abraham and this is a
[39:49] massive covenant this is the covenant
[39:51] that was finally going to impact
[39:53] and bless all nations around the world
[39:56] but again it didn't do away with sin
[39:59] praise god
[40:00] abraham's covenant was great it foretold
[40:02] of it but it didn't do away with it
[40:05] so the fifth one is the mosaic covenant
[40:08] that's the giving of the law and the
[40:10] priesthood
[40:11] uh the sixth one is the davidic covenant
[40:14] which uh gives us a king of this of the
[40:17] seed line
[40:18] of david praise god in the millennium
[40:20] it's the son of david jesus christ
[40:22] because of that covenant praise god amen
[40:25] it's an unending
[40:26] covenant and then wonderfully the
[40:29] seventh covenant the one word right now
[40:31] the new covenant praise god where the
[40:33] word of god is written
[40:34] upon the fleshly tables of our hearts
[40:37] praise god
[40:38] no longer on stone now he writes it in
[40:40] your souls and we ought to rejoice if
[40:42] it's in our souls tonight praise god
[40:44] amen
[40:45] thank god but there's going to come
[40:47] another covenant because brother brahm
[40:48] says we're not
[40:49] always going to need the blood of jesus
[40:52] right
[40:53] once we get to the new bodies and sin is
[40:55] done away with after the white throne
[40:56] judgment
[40:57] it's time for the new jerusalem will no
[40:59] longer need blood to forgive us anymore
[41:01] right because we have a new body we have
[41:03] a new spirit we have a theophany we have
[41:06] a glorified body
[41:07] everything he said behold all things are
[41:09] made new praise god
[41:11] and so there's no more need of blood to
[41:12] forgive us right there's no more need of
[41:14] that
[41:15] and so he has a final eternal covenant
[41:18] praise god
[41:19] a new heaven and a new earth so i
[41:21] believe this is just a
[41:23] uh i believe it's i believe it's a
[41:24] revelation some people might not agree
[41:26] with me
[41:26] but i believe it's a revelation it's the
[41:28] eighth covenant and we looked at that
[41:30] uh this spring now let's go to daniel 70
[41:33] weeks here now
[41:34] just real briefly
[41:37] uh if you got your bibles who read last
[41:39] was it lydia
[41:40] yeah some malachi malakai read genesis
[41:43] 29
[41:44] 27 a week in the bible can mean
[41:47] seven years okay because jacob had to
[41:51] fulfill rachel's week
[41:53] and work seven additional years so the
[41:56] way to understand this
[41:58] is to understand that a week god can use
[42:00] different words to mean different
[42:01] amounts of time because he hides his
[42:04] truth in mystery
[42:06] so malachi read genesis 29-27
[42:19] okay so everybody can see a week can
[42:21] mean seven years
[42:23] praise god all right now
[42:27] let's go to daniel let's all go to
[42:28] daniel 9 20
[42:30] please daniel 9 20. we'll go back there
[42:34] and like i said we'll go a little bit
[42:35] longer here i got what 34 more minutes
[42:38] lay this message in tonight and i think
[42:40] we'll be done with this
[42:41] revelation then we'll move on i'd like
[42:43] to go next to the revelation of
[42:45] christ as the bride of christ i'd like
[42:48] to preach on that
[42:49] i think everybody will really be blessed
[42:51] by that one daniel 9
[42:53] 20. now remember daniel is seeking god
[42:56] if you look at verse
[42:58] verse one and two he's seeking god to
[43:00] understand jeremiah's prophecy
[43:02] when does his 70 years run out
[43:06] he starts praying in verse 3 sets his
[43:08] face to heaven
[43:09] to understand and in verse 20 the bible
[43:12] said while i was speaking and praying
[43:14] confessing my sin and the sin of my
[43:16] people israel
[43:17] presenting my supplication before the
[43:18] lord my god for the holy mountain of my
[43:21] god look at that man
[43:22] even while as i was speaking in prayer
[43:24] even the man gabriel whom i had seen the
[43:26] vision at the beginning
[43:28] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[43:30] about the time
[43:32] of the heavenly oblation now look how
[43:34] fast this angel comes in right
[43:35] kind of like reminds us of brother
[43:37] branham with that vision right the seven
[43:38] angels
[43:39] he said they come like breaking the
[43:40] speed barrier he comes swiftly right
[43:44] and they touched him verse 22 and he
[43:46] informed me and said talk with me
[43:48] and said o daniel i have now come forth
[43:50] to give the skill and understanding
[43:52] at the beginning of thy supplications
[43:54] the commandment came forth and i have
[43:56] come to show thee
[43:57] for thou art greatly beloved therefore
[43:59] understand the matter and consider the
[44:01] vision
[44:03] praise god remember we saw it on sunday
[44:05] we're greatly loved in heaven
[44:06] if we're contacting heaven if we're
[44:08] confessing our sins
[44:10] confessing the sins of our loved ones
[44:12] and trusting in the blood of jesus
[44:13] christ
[44:14] heaven loves us amen verse 24
[44:17] 70 weeks here we are are determined upon
[44:21] thy people
[44:22] and upon thy holy city to finish the
[44:25] transgression
[44:26] to make an end of sin to make
[44:29] reconciliation for iniquity
[44:31] and to bring in everlasting
[44:32] righteousness and seal up the vision and
[44:34] prophecy and to anoint
[44:37] the most holy praise god hallelujah
[44:41] now notice verse 24 who is this prophecy
[44:44] for
[44:45] thy people it's for the jews it's upon
[44:48] thy holy city jerusalem
[44:50] there are six things that have to happen
[44:53] so daniel's prayer for national
[44:56] and spiritual restoration can be
[44:58] fulfilled and i got them up here
[45:00] in order we'll just go through them
[45:01] again the first one is the taking away
[45:04] the blindness of israel
[45:06] uh i'm sorry to finish the
[45:08] transgressions that means
[45:10] uh israel is no longer transgressing
[45:12] when their blindness
[45:13] is taken away second thing
[45:16] gabriel came is to make an end of sin
[45:18] that's when their unbelief
[45:20] ends when jesus literally and physically
[45:24] appears
[45:24] to the 144 thousand they no longer
[45:27] disbelieve right they believe
[45:29] third they make reconciliation for
[45:31] iniquity this is
[45:33] israel being purged or pardoned on one
[45:36] day
[45:37] that's the day they're born again see
[45:39] they're they're reconciled right no more
[45:41] iniquity
[45:42] they're reconciled the fourth thing is
[45:45] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[45:47] that's the millennium praise god amen
[45:49] hallelujah one time somebody said i was
[45:52] wrong
[45:53] saying everlasting was the millennium
[45:54] but that's what the bible says there the
[45:56] bible says it right there
[45:57] so a thousand years can mean everlasting
[45:59] right
[46:00] just like just like jonah said i was in
[46:02] the belly of the whale forever right
[46:04] it's just an expression right the only
[46:06] word that means eternal
[46:08] is eternal right right that's the one
[46:10] that means unending
[46:11] so everlasting means the millennium
[46:15] okay and the fifth seal up the vision
[46:18] and prophecy that's gabriel came to seal
[46:21] up the understanding of the vision and
[46:22] prophecy from
[46:23] israel and everyone else until the end
[46:26] time
[46:27] and lastly i love this one he's going to
[46:29] anoint the most holy
[46:31] so gabriel's not going to anoint jesus
[46:34] jesus is already anointed right
[46:36] he's going to anoint the millennial
[46:37] temple praise god so god's going to come
[46:40] down and fill that temple right there in
[46:41] jerusalem again praise god
[46:43] a new temple a millennial temple for a
[46:46] thousand years
[46:47] of worship praise god now i just
[46:51] like i said i'm going quickly through
[46:54] this
[46:56] now next daniel 70 weeks brother adam
[46:58] says the purpose
[46:59] is because the purpose of him teaching
[47:01] it
[47:02] was because we're expecting something to
[47:04] happen
[47:05] uh that they saw wrote in the book of
[47:08] revelation when it's not applied
[47:10] to the church age so brother is saying
[47:12] this i'm preaching this so you'll see
[47:14] that daniel 70 weeks doesn't apply to
[47:17] the church age
[47:18] right that means it's after okay so this
[47:22] one
[47:22] this this message is is important
[47:25] because it shows
[47:26] that this uh teaching doesn't belong in
[47:28] the church age it's not for us
[47:31] right in other words we don't have to
[47:32] worry about being on the earth right
[47:34] when all these things happen
[47:35] we'll be at the marriage supper the lamb
[47:38] praise god
[47:39] so my man said that's why he he was ex
[47:41] some people were expecting these things
[47:43] to happen
[47:44] right they're expecting to see israel
[47:46] repent well we are but we're expecting
[47:47] to see it looking over the banister in
[47:49] heaven
[47:50] praise god we don't want to live through
[47:52] the tribulation right we don't live
[47:53] through water being turned to blood
[47:55] we don't want to be uh living through
[47:57] the moon turning the blood and the sun
[47:59] no longer shining we don't want to live
[48:00] through that praise god
[48:02] we want to be in heaven with jesus
[48:03] christ for the marriage supper of the
[48:05] lamb
[48:06] so see he taught this because some
[48:08] people were expecting
[48:09] the wrong thing and also he said because
[48:12] it
[48:12] shows how close we are to his coming
[48:15] we're not going to read through all that
[48:16] but just to show it like that okay now
[48:19] i'm going to leave this up here for a
[48:20] while so
[48:21] everybody can just get a good look at it
[48:24] so this will be in the book here lord
[48:25] willing if the lord tarries
[48:26] daniel 70 weeks prophecy in verses 25
[48:30] to 27. actually you know i need to
[48:33] change that to 24. this first 24
[48:36] to 27. so i need to make a reminder of
[48:38] that so don't miss that
[48:40] now we got three time periods we just
[48:42] read for our text
[48:44] there's three time periods uh to help us
[48:46] understand this
[48:50] now the first time period was uh
[48:54] seven years or seven weeks or 49 years
[48:57] until the going forth of the commandment
[49:00] to restore
[49:01] and rebuild jerusalem the street shall
[49:03] be built again
[49:04] and the wall even in troubles times
[49:08] now clarence larkin did great history
[49:11] work on this
[49:12] he said that first commandment uh
[49:15] from artaxerxes longamanus king of
[49:18] persia
[49:20] was in 445 bc
[49:23] and the temple and its wall were
[49:24] finished 49 years later
[49:27] in 396 bc
[49:30] so that part was officially fulfilled
[49:32] there's not much
[49:33] argument about this one praise god this
[49:35] part is the easiest one to understand
[49:37] praise god okay and nehemiah 4 17
[49:41] confirms it was troubleless time
[49:43] the bible said they which built it on
[49:45] the wall and they that bear
[49:47] burdens with those that laid everyone
[49:50] with
[49:52] with one of his hands wrought in the
[49:53] work and with the other hand held a
[49:56] weapon can you imagine
[49:57] building a wall you've got a hand with a
[50:01] a brick and you got a hand with a sword
[50:04] just
[50:04] just such a troublesome time to live
[50:06] right you didn't have the
[50:08] you didn't have the security just to
[50:09] build with both hands you had to be
[50:11] ready to fight
[50:12] on the drop of a hat bye i'm thankful
[50:15] for the aren't you thankful for the
[50:16] peaceful
[50:17] world that we live in today i don't got
[50:19] to go to work packing a gun
[50:20] i guess you could in some some work
[50:22] places right
[50:24] but you have to have your gun in one
[50:25] hand and you know you're typing with the
[50:27] other hand
[50:27] we don't to live like that thank god for
[50:29] his mercy
[50:30] but this was the condition uh that
[50:33] israel lived in
[50:34] when this prophecy was fulfilled and it
[50:37] tells us church god is going to fulfill
[50:38] his prophecy
[50:40] no matter what the saints go through
[50:42] amen no matter what we've got to go
[50:44] through
[50:44] to make it to the rapture god is going
[50:46] to fulfill his word to us
[50:48] amen hallelujah and if church if they
[50:51] could live
[50:52] through such troublesome times without
[50:54] the holy ghost what should we be able to
[50:56] live through with the holy ghost
[50:58] amen we should have faith right even
[51:01] though it looked like
[51:02] uh trouble happened today right down in
[51:05] washington d.c all that trouble happened
[51:07] yet we should have faith to know god is
[51:08] with us uh
[51:10] god's still working even when we don't
[51:11] see it right we should sing waymaker
[51:13] right
[51:14] even when we don't see it god is working
[51:16] praise god
[51:17] he's gonna bring everything to pass just
[51:19] as he planned
[51:20] his plan is perfect amen now here's
[51:23] where we get a little bit of
[51:26] here's where we get some of the uh
[51:27] mystery part here
[51:30] the second time period daniel says is in
[51:34] 60
[51:37] yeah it's uh verse 26
[51:41] and after three score in two weeks shall
[51:44] messiah be cut off so three scores 60
[51:47] plus two 62. now you got to add those 49
[51:52] years
[51:52] plus the 434 years
[51:56] okay so after 62 weeks but you can't
[51:59] forget the previous seven weeks
[52:01] so now after in other words after 69
[52:03] weeks messiah will be cut off
[52:07] okay so that turns out to be uh
[52:11] 483 years so from the time that king
[52:16] artaxerxes long amount manus uh
[52:19] commanded the temple to be rebuilt
[52:21] 483 is la 483 years later
[52:25] messiah would be crucified
[52:28] all right now let's just do some simple
[52:30] math up here so 445
[52:34] bc to 1bc to 180
[52:37] is 445 years now we still got
[52:41] 38 years left so that takes us to 38
[52:45] a.d okay but i thought
[52:49] jesus died in 30 a.d so right now if you
[52:52] do the math it takes you to 38
[52:54] a.d so how do we get to
[52:57] jesus being crucified at 30 a.d here is
[53:00] the secret
[53:01] so hope this makes sense here all right
[53:04] now the combined 483 years of the first
[53:06] two time periods
[53:07] it must be converted converted to
[53:09] prophetic years
[53:11] rather than solar years okay so if you
[53:14] just do regular solar solar years you
[53:16] would end up at
[53:17] 38 a.d but what happened is god hid
[53:22] 483 prophetic years in man's
[53:26] 475 solar years
[53:29] okay all right now it's kind of a little
[53:32] bit tricky
[53:33] and that's because prophetic years are
[53:35] shorter years
[53:37] uh than than the uh regular years
[53:40] right solar i'm sorry yeah prophetic
[53:42] years are shorter
[53:43] than the solar years
[53:47] so let me see if i can uh put that up
[53:49] there just so everybody can see
[53:52] i'm not sure if i can actually
[53:57] i'll just have to read it okay so in
[54:00] god's prophetic calendar there's only 30
[54:02] days in a month right
[54:04] that's proven in the scripture
[54:08] yeah let's read that lydia read first
[54:10] kings 4 7 please i know you're real fast
[54:12] at finding the scriptures
[54:14] first kings 4 7. this scripture you'll
[54:17] see there's 30 days
[54:19] in every month because solomon had
[54:21] officers that would switch out
[54:23] every month after 30 days go ahead lydia
[54:26] [Music]
[54:35] all right so each man had a month in a
[54:37] year of 30 days
[54:39] okay so that means in god's calendar
[54:42] each month had 30 days
[54:44] right so 30 times 12
[54:47] 360. right 30 times 12
[54:51] 360. so god's year has
[54:54] 360 days who knows how many years we got
[54:57] in our day
[54:59] 365 and what a quarter
[55:02] and then they got adjusted every cup
[55:04] every four years right
[55:06] so so in other words our solar years are
[55:09] longer
[55:10] than the prophetic years or god's years
[55:14] all right now again
[55:18] malachi go to revelation 11 2 and 3.
[55:21] here's where you see god always keeps
[55:23] this this
[55:24] this time period the same even though
[55:26] man has changed the calendar to 365 and
[55:28] a quarter days
[55:30] god has always kept it the same so god
[55:33] always works according to his calendar
[55:35] and not our calendar so malachi read
[55:38] revelation 11 2-3 please
[56:00] all right so what is 1260
[56:03] divided by 42 months 30 each month
[56:07] each month had 30 days and look at this
[56:09] this is amazing
[56:10] god so 445 years before christ
[56:13] god said it's going to be 483 years
[56:16] but he met prophetic years he didn't
[56:19] mean
[56:20] solar years like we got today
[56:23] okay so actually uh
[56:26] 400 most people would calculate it'd be
[56:29] to 38 a.d that's when the 483 years
[56:31] would run out
[56:32] 38 a.d but really because god's years
[56:35] are shorter
[56:36] those 483 years were fulfilled in 30 a.d
[56:40] when jesus was crucified and then
[56:43] rose from the dead praise god
[56:47] okay now notice god keeps that same
[56:49] pattern all the way
[56:51] past the rapture into the millennia i'm
[56:53] sorry yeah into the tribulation period
[56:54] not the
[56:55] end of the tribulation period god always
[56:57] has 30
[56:58] days in a month always
[57:02] okay so without the numbers having up
[57:05] there hope that's okay
[57:07] uh lydia now if you would lydia read uh
[57:11] isaiah 45 15. this is such a beautiful
[57:14] scripture
[57:14] to understanding this so men
[57:18] men look well men look and say well it
[57:19] must have ran out in 38
[57:21] a.d but god was so wise
[57:25] he used prophetic years and not solar
[57:28] years so lydia can read
[57:29] isaiah 45 15.
[57:36] amen so god hid himself god hit his
[57:39] revelation
[57:40] inside of man's solar years god the
[57:44] truth is hiding in there
[57:46] it's shorter than man's ears right and
[57:49] so god is able to fulfill
[57:50] all that within that
[57:54] that time frame which seems shorter to
[57:56] the worldly mind but to god's prophetic
[57:59] year it works out perfectly 483 years
[58:03] to the time christ was crucified and
[58:05] rose from the dead
[58:06] praise god amen now just so you know
[58:09] church
[58:10] a regular solar years has 176
[58:14] i'm sorry a regular well i'm not going
[58:17] to go that's
[58:17] that's that's a whole lot of math there
[58:19] if i'm not going to show it i'm probably
[58:20] not going to read it i better not do
[58:21] that
[58:22] okay now i do wanna share this though
[58:26] i'll go to luke 3 21-23
[58:31] the bible doesn't give us jesus's exact
[58:34] age
[58:34] the bible just kind of gives us a a
[58:37] an average number like kind of like a
[58:39] guess
[58:40] it doesn't tell us like the exact number
[58:43] so luke
[58:44] 3 21 22 and 23.
[58:50] so lydia do you got that honey luke
[58:52] three
[58:53] can you read verses 21 22-23
[59:23] amen now notice saints
[59:26] the bible says about 30 years old right
[59:29] so
[59:29] god purposely doesn't give the exact age
[59:32] of jesus just
[59:33] about 30. so that gives us some wiggle
[59:36] room okay so in daniel 70 weeks just so
[59:38] you know
[59:38] there is some wiggle room we don't know
[59:40] the exact exact day or exact time that
[59:43] jesus was born no one really knows it
[59:44] for sure and look god did it on purpose
[59:47] look god did it on purpose to hide it
[59:49] from the eyes of the lies and prudent
[59:51] praise god he didn't even tell you
[59:53] exactly when it was he said he's about
[59:55] 30.
[59:56] he doesn't tell us so but we can get
[59:59] very close
[1:00:00] and that's what daniel's 70 weeks helps
[1:00:01] us do helps us get very close
[1:00:04] to his approximate age and then god
[1:00:06] leaves a little bit of wiggle room for
[1:00:08] us
[1:00:09] okay so which one just want everybody to
[1:00:11] see that
[1:00:14] all right now what's interesting what's
[1:00:16] amazing church
[1:00:17] is that if jesus died in a.d 30 and rose
[1:00:21] from the grave
[1:00:22] who knows what happened 40 years later
[1:00:24] anybody know
[1:00:25] any historians out there titus came
[1:00:30] titus came so titus came the roman
[1:00:32] general
[1:00:33] and destroyed jerusalem's temple right
[1:00:36] that's what they were saying when jesus
[1:00:38] was on the cross and he was carrying up
[1:00:39] the hill of to golgotha they were
[1:00:42] weeping over him and jesus said don't
[1:00:43] wait for me
[1:00:44] he said weep for yourselves he said pray
[1:00:46] that your flight be not in the winter
[1:00:49] right he said pray that it be not winter
[1:00:52] that the babes give suck in those days
[1:00:54] because it would be awful to run for the
[1:00:56] hills
[1:00:56] so jesus was warning them how many years
[1:00:58] advanced was he warning them
[1:01:00] 40 40. so see god works with israel
[1:01:04] in these perfect numbers isn't that
[1:01:07] amazing
[1:01:08] israel had to wait how many years in the
[1:01:09] wilderness 40
[1:01:11] because they're disobedient right so god
[1:01:14] gave them 40 years of mercy after they
[1:01:17] rejected christ and then the judgment
[1:01:19] came
[1:01:20] ah look at that isn't that amazing
[1:01:23] i mean it hit all history knows titus
[1:01:25] came and destroyed it
[1:01:27] in 80 70. so see god is going to work
[1:01:29] with israel
[1:01:30] according to these time periods but with
[1:01:32] us jesus said no man
[1:01:33] knows that they're the hour right with
[1:01:36] gentiles it's just
[1:01:37] it's just out there we got to be ready
[1:01:39] all the world has to hear the gospel of
[1:01:41] jesus christ the gentiles got to work
[1:01:43] we got to stay faithful we got to stay
[1:01:45] diligent no man knows the day or the
[1:01:46] hour
[1:01:47] but the jews know the days and they know
[1:01:49] the years
[1:01:50] because god gave it to him 490 years
[1:01:54] or 70 weeks have to be fulfilled
[1:01:57] oh it's quite a thought my goodness
[1:02:01] remember hebrews 3 17 but with whom was
[1:02:04] he greed
[1:02:04] 40 years look he was grieved all those
[1:02:06] 40 years after
[1:02:08] after the resurrection after the holy
[1:02:09] ghost fell he was grieved with them for
[1:02:11] 40 years
[1:02:12] and then he sent titus to destroy him
[1:02:14] remember that fulfilled church
[1:02:16] part of daniel 70 weeks
[1:02:20] uh go to verse uh well if you got daniel
[1:02:22] 9 26
[1:02:24] after three score in two weeks shall
[1:02:26] messiah be cut off
[1:02:27] but not for himself amen jesus was cut
[1:02:30] off for you and i
[1:02:32] amen that tree was cut down so we didn't
[1:02:34] have to be cut down praise god
[1:02:38] then also of course for israel too
[1:02:39] that's the next revelation god jesus
[1:02:41] church now is both jew
[1:02:43] and gentile that's the next revelation
[1:02:46] he was cut off but not for himself he
[1:02:48] was cut off for the jews and the
[1:02:50] gentiles
[1:02:51] amen and the people of the prince
[1:02:56] that shall come who's that rome
[1:02:59] right the people of the prince rome that
[1:03:01] shall come who's coming titus is coming
[1:03:05] shall do what in verse 26 destroy the
[1:03:08] city and the
[1:03:09] sanctuary this is what jesus was warning
[1:03:13] them about see so jesus
[1:03:14] plays a special part in helping us
[1:03:16] understand daniel 70 weeks
[1:03:18] he said there's going to come there's
[1:03:20] going to come titus he said get to the
[1:03:22] hills as soon as you hear him coming run
[1:03:23] to the hills
[1:03:24] now we know the christians were out four
[1:03:26] or five years before titus even came
[1:03:29] the holy spirit protected those holy
[1:03:30] ghost-filled saints so we're trusting in
[1:03:32] the same grace
[1:03:33] to protect us before the mark of the
[1:03:35] beast is laid down
[1:03:36] amen because that's going to be the
[1:03:38] worst time ever according to daniel 12
[1:03:40] the worst time ever of destruction on
[1:03:42] the earth will be during the tribulation
[1:03:43] so we're we believe god will keep us
[1:03:45] from that praise god
[1:03:47] amen resting our souls on that
[1:03:50] really we're resting our souls on the
[1:03:52] blood of jesus christ and the mercy of
[1:03:54] god
[1:03:54] because we've not inherited uh wrath
[1:03:57] we've inherited
[1:03:58] mercy praise god that's what first
[1:04:00] thessalonians 5 says
[1:04:04] okay so titus came 40 years later
[1:04:07] because god was grieved 40 years
[1:04:09] that the israelites turned down jesus
[1:04:12] and their carcasses fell there in
[1:04:15] jerusalem just like
[1:04:17] egypt when they rejected the promised
[1:04:18] land right but here they're rejecting
[1:04:20] the promised land of the holy ghost my
[1:04:22] wow what a thought well god's god's word
[1:04:25] is so powerful
[1:04:27] because remember 40 years is like a time
[1:04:29] of detention right or discipline or test
[1:04:34] see like a school master putting a
[1:04:36] student in a timeout or detention god
[1:04:40] put israel in detention for 40 years
[1:04:42] and then he judged them and he cut them
[1:04:44] off
[1:04:47] all right
[1:04:50] yeah just make sure i got all that all
[1:04:52] right i'm gonna do it on time okay i got
[1:04:54] about 11 more minutes we'll try to that
[1:04:56] should be good by god's grace now what
[1:04:58] most people don't realize is that god
[1:05:00] put a pause or he put a gap
[1:05:04] from the time of the 62 weeks or the 69
[1:05:07] weeks
[1:05:07] god put a pause there there's currently
[1:05:09] a 2000 year pause
[1:05:12] or gap between the ending of the 69
[1:05:15] 69th week when jesus was crucified
[1:05:18] and the beginning of the 70th week or
[1:05:21] the last seven years
[1:05:22] now again this is different than i've
[1:05:24] ever thought when i was writing this
[1:05:25] chapter
[1:05:26] in this summer it just i totally i felt
[1:05:29] like i
[1:05:29] i now understood the time period i
[1:05:31] understood everything
[1:05:33] and remember you have quotes brother ram
[1:05:34] said jesus was crucified in 30 a.d
[1:05:37] sometimes he says 33 a.d so again we
[1:05:40] don't make it a major doctrine
[1:05:41] but i do believe this is the right time
[1:05:43] period so right now the 69
[1:05:45] week is over for israel and god put a
[1:05:48] pause there
[1:05:49] before he starts that 70th week that
[1:05:51] last seven weeks
[1:05:52] god paused it and said i'm going to get
[1:05:54] myself a people for my namesake
[1:05:57] praise god my people israel they turn
[1:06:00] down my name
[1:06:01] so i'll get a people that love my name
[1:06:03] praise god
[1:06:04] i'll get a gentile wife praise god i
[1:06:06] divorced israel i put her away
[1:06:08] except for a little small remnant right
[1:06:10] that and they're part of the one church
[1:06:12] the one bride right he said i'm gonna
[1:06:14] get me a people for my name's sake
[1:06:16] praise god
[1:06:18] thank god okay
[1:06:22] now let's read these are some beautiful
[1:06:24] scriptures church
[1:06:26] uh my go to hosea 3 verses 4 and 5.
[1:06:29] malachi
[1:06:30] hosea daniel hosea so right after
[1:06:32] ezekiel ezekiel
[1:06:34] daniel hosea so you find ezekiel
[1:06:37] daniel then hosea this is a beautiful
[1:06:40] scripture i just remember smiling as
[1:06:42] soon as i read this when i was writing
[1:06:44] the chapter hosea
[1:06:47] hosea foretells this pause or this
[1:06:50] gap of 2000 years
[1:06:53] so beautiful hosea 3 malachi versus 4
[1:06:56] and 5. can you read that ready
[1:07:12] is
[1:07:17] wow that's powerful to me look at that
[1:07:21] it was hosea 5. now since i'm there let
[1:07:24] me look up the the year that was written
[1:07:28] nah that was written 7 80
[1:07:31] bc this is almost this is over 200 years
[1:07:34] after david
[1:07:35] look at that church they're going to
[1:07:37] seek they're going to seek the lord and
[1:07:39] david david's been dead for 200 years
[1:07:42] amen he said for many days
[1:07:46] they won't have a prince a king a
[1:07:48] sacrifice
[1:07:49] right it's being fulfilled but when will
[1:07:52] it happen
[1:07:53] in the latter days amen
[1:07:56] in the last days they're going to come
[1:07:58] and seek
[1:07:59] their king hallelujah king jesus
[1:08:01] hallelujah ah that's beautiful
[1:08:04] man that's one of the most powerful
[1:08:05] scriptures there
[1:08:07] see that agrees with paul paul said god
[1:08:09] is able to graft them back in
[1:08:13] he's able but right now they don't have
[1:08:15] it but he has to wait until the fullness
[1:08:18] of the gentiles be come in
[1:08:21] praise god that's beautiful
[1:08:25] hallelujah what a revelation hosea 3
[1:08:29] verses 4 and 5 are
[1:08:32] now to me this is rock solid i don't
[1:08:34] know why i ever thought it was 3380. i
[1:08:37] really don't know
[1:08:38] and i haven't really gone back to my
[1:08:39] notes because it was so fresh when it
[1:08:41] came to me this summer
[1:08:42] but anyways now let's look at this now
[1:08:43] most people believe
[1:08:45] there's only three and a half years of
[1:08:46] the tribulation i believe there are
[1:08:48] seven years of tribulation
[1:08:50] the first half though won't be as bad as
[1:08:52] the last half
[1:08:54] the last half will be the most awful
[1:08:56] time ever on the face of the earth
[1:08:58] okay and here's why the first half is
[1:09:01] just the
[1:09:02] the two witnesses interrupting nature
[1:09:05] right
[1:09:07] they're just you know turning the water
[1:09:08] to blood but nothing's really being
[1:09:11] destroyed yet
[1:09:12] right there there's there's no rain the
[1:09:15] bible says there's a famine
[1:09:16] for three and a half years right water
[1:09:19] turns the blood
[1:09:20] but the people are still going on and
[1:09:22] israel still has her covenant
[1:09:24] because the antichrist hasn't broken the
[1:09:26] covenant yet
[1:09:27] he breaks it in the midst of the last
[1:09:30] week
[1:09:31] that's verse 27 daniel 9
[1:09:34] 27 let's read that
[1:09:38] so in verse 26 daniel 9 26 the
[1:09:41] sanctuaries destroyed
[1:09:44] and that was 70 a.d
[1:09:47] right now verse 27
[1:09:51] he now the he in this verse cannot be
[1:09:56] christ
[1:09:56] because our lord would not purposely
[1:09:58] overspread abominations
[1:10:00] upon jerusalem right
[1:10:03] the purpose of this man is to spread his
[1:10:06] abominations
[1:10:09] okay and he's going to stop the jewish
[1:10:13] sacrifices
[1:10:15] that are restarted when they rebuild the
[1:10:17] temple
[1:10:18] that's what the bible says in verse 27
[1:10:20] he'll confirm the covenant with many for
[1:10:22] one week in the midst of the weak
[1:10:26] he shall cause the sacrifice and the
[1:10:28] oblation to cease okay so
[1:10:30] israel has to sacrifice animals
[1:10:34] for three and a half years while moses
[1:10:37] and elijah are there
[1:10:38] preparing them to receive christ now
[1:10:41] here's the thing i don't know i don't
[1:10:42] know when they're going to rebuild
[1:10:44] that temple but i imagine it's going to
[1:10:46] be really fast
[1:10:47] i don't know if we'll live to see it if
[1:10:49] we do church we'll have we'll be having
[1:10:51] we'll be having constant revival here
[1:10:54] because we'll be like my this is
[1:10:55] the two prophets are coming the new
[1:10:57] prophets are coming and people will call
[1:10:58] us crazy
[1:11:00] they'll probably block our facebook
[1:11:02] accounts we'll be so crazy
[1:11:04] because well this is scripture this is
[1:11:05] scripture now my thought is we won't see
[1:11:08] it rebuilt
[1:11:09] because i just think that would just be
[1:11:10] too obvious
[1:11:12] but uh we may we may and here's the
[1:11:16] reason why jesus said let's read it
[1:11:18] uh luke 21 i believe it's luke 21 24
[1:11:20] let's read it
[1:11:22] here's the reason i don't think we'll
[1:11:23] see the temple rebuilt at least now
[1:11:29] yeah luke 21 24 lydia can you read that
[1:11:33] for me huh
[1:11:44] so see that jerusalem is controlled
[1:11:47] by the gentiles until when the church
[1:11:51] ages are over
[1:11:54] so see the gentiles are not going to let
[1:11:56] who
[1:11:57] which gentiles is he talking about the
[1:12:00] muslims
[1:12:02] right the muslims are going to have
[1:12:03] control over jerusalem until
[1:12:06] the times of the gentiles are fulfilled
[1:12:08] that's why i don't think we'll see the
[1:12:10] temple rebuilt
[1:12:11] i think it'll start right after the
[1:12:12] rapture that's what i think and i think
[1:12:15] they'll put it up in a matter of
[1:12:16] months you know they'll probably be up
[1:12:18] in a matter of months but as soon as the
[1:12:19] bride goes up
[1:12:20] satan comes down right because he will
[1:12:22] let until he
[1:12:24] be taken out of the way praise god the
[1:12:25] holy spirit right god is going to let
[1:12:28] god is going to hold back the antichrist
[1:12:30] until the holy spirit is taken away from
[1:12:32] the church right with the church
[1:12:34] when it's raptured up okay
[1:12:38] so this he and then going back to daniel
[1:12:41] 9 27 who is it that confirms the
[1:12:42] covenant for a week
[1:12:44] he that's speaking of the antichrist the
[1:12:46] pope
[1:12:48] antichrist
[1:12:52] all right now next in closing here i'm
[1:12:54] trying to i'm almost really going to
[1:12:56] close really
[1:12:57] uh shortly after the rapture the pope
[1:13:00] antichrist makes a one week or seven
[1:13:02] year covenant with many
[1:13:04] world leaders including the sinful part
[1:13:06] of israel
[1:13:07] right because only 144 000 are going to
[1:13:09] get the holy ghost right now they got 2
[1:13:10] million people in israel
[1:13:12] most of them are sinners but there's a
[1:13:14] small little remnant
[1:13:15] that can't wait to sacrifice and pray
[1:13:18] and read the scripture
[1:13:19] and they're on they can't wait to
[1:13:20] rebuild the temple praise god right
[1:13:22] they're waiting for king david to come
[1:13:23] back
[1:13:25] right a david king a king in the seed
[1:13:28] line of david
[1:13:30] right they don't know it's jesus but
[1:13:32] it's going to be jesus
[1:13:34] all right now daniel 11 says the
[1:13:37] covenant is also called a peaceful
[1:13:39] league and remember paul says the world
[1:13:43] will be crying for peace and safety
[1:13:46] so this pope is satan's superman he's
[1:13:48] going to give them what the people want
[1:13:50] peace and safety and they're going to
[1:13:51] make a seven year covenant now you can
[1:13:53] see it coming up
[1:13:54] you can see how it's possible with trump
[1:13:55] now remember how trump had he made peace
[1:13:57] with four other countries with israel
[1:13:59] you can see how it's going to be
[1:14:00] possible
[1:14:01] it's going to be possible now of course
[1:14:02] it's not because they love each other
[1:14:04] it's because of money right
[1:14:05] it's increasing their finances and their
[1:14:07] trade and their
[1:14:08] and their their economies it's helping
[1:14:10] their economies
[1:14:11] it's not helping their hearts
[1:14:14] so see the pope will deliver on peace
[1:14:17] and safety at the time of the rapture
[1:14:23] but the 144 thousand will not bow
[1:14:26] to the pope's flatteries the bible said
[1:14:28] he's going to make the league
[1:14:29] through flatteries all right
[1:14:36] and at the same time in this last week
[1:14:39] the two
[1:14:40] witnesses will be causing the rain to
[1:14:43] stop
[1:14:44] and they'll turn the water to blood
[1:14:47] that's what the scripture says three and
[1:14:49] a half years or the first half of
[1:14:52] daniel's
[1:14:53] 70th week their ministries match old
[1:14:56] testament
[1:14:56] moses and elijah and i think it'll be
[1:14:59] those two men myself that's what i
[1:15:00] since elijah didn't die i think he's
[1:15:02] gonna have to die that's just my opinion
[1:15:04] but i think it's gonna be the literal
[1:15:06] men themselves
[1:15:09] okay but now the worst judgments happen
[1:15:13] after that three in the second half of
[1:15:15] the week and that's according to
[1:15:17] revelation 7 3. malachi can you read
[1:15:19] revelation 7 7 3.
[1:15:24] revelation 7 3 so that first half of the
[1:15:27] week
[1:15:28] there's not too many bad things that are
[1:15:30] going to be happening because they're
[1:15:30] going to have like a peaceful covenant
[1:15:33] but then the antichrist breaks it in the
[1:15:35] middle of the week
[1:15:36] revelation 7
[1:15:44] okay so the 144 000 can't receive the
[1:15:47] holy ghost till
[1:15:48] after they see the two prophets
[1:15:50] resurrected then they're going to know
[1:15:52] that what they were preaching was the
[1:15:53] right thing it was jesus christ
[1:15:56] see and then they'll get the baptism the
[1:15:58] holy ghost
[1:15:59] after they get the baptism in the holy
[1:16:00] ghost now this is interesting sometimes
[1:16:02] brother
[1:16:02] says the 144 thousand have to be
[1:16:04] martyred sometimes he says they're saved
[1:16:06] but either way in revelation 15 the next
[1:16:09] time we see them
[1:16:10] after they're on mount zion with jesus
[1:16:12] we see them standing on the sea of glass
[1:16:15] mingle with fire and they have harps and
[1:16:18] they're singing songs to moses
[1:16:20] and the lamb of god amen ah what a
[1:16:23] picture
[1:16:24] the late the sea of glass was the
[1:16:26] washing right
[1:16:27] it was the labor that the the priests
[1:16:29] would wash before they would go in the
[1:16:31] holy place
[1:16:32] so in heaven god is bringing the 144
[1:16:35] thousand closer to the throne
[1:16:37] but first they've got to go through this
[1:16:38] sea of glass
[1:16:40] right they got to go through the sea of
[1:16:41] glass and they're singing praises
[1:16:43] to god and the lamb they're making their
[1:16:45] way closer
[1:16:46] to the throne of god amen but if we die
[1:16:49] right now
[1:16:49] in christ or if we're raptured we go
[1:16:51] straight to the throne of god
[1:16:53] amen but israel has to experience this
[1:16:56] transition right coming closer
[1:16:58] because they were blinded to christ
[1:17:02] oh it's what a what a picture well it's
[1:17:03] such a great mystery mine
[1:17:07] oh my in the middle of the week the pope
[1:17:10] causes the israel sacrifices to cease
[1:17:14] this is the end of the two prophets
[1:17:17] ministries
[1:17:18] they're slain by satan but they're
[1:17:20] raised from the dead three and a half
[1:17:22] days later in the sight of their enemies
[1:17:25] a great earthquake strikes jerusalem a
[1:17:27] tenth of the city falls
[1:17:29] seven thousand people die in israel
[1:17:31] seven thousand die
[1:17:32] through an earthquake i think what two
[1:17:36] thousand died at nine eleven
[1:17:37] two thousand died at nine eleven when
[1:17:40] the towers fell
[1:17:41] here seven thousand are gonna die in
[1:17:43] jerusalem
[1:17:45] the 144 thousand see god's power and the
[1:17:48] bible said they give god glory
[1:17:51] because of the power of the resurrection
[1:17:53] and that's the sixth and final rapture
[1:17:57] now daniel 12 11 says after one month
[1:18:01] one month after the covenant's broken
[1:18:03] rome sets up an abomination in
[1:18:05] israel's temple as the pope sits on the
[1:18:08] temple
[1:18:09] claiming that he is gods let's read that
[1:18:11] daniel 12 11 lydia daniel 12 11. i'm
[1:18:13] keeping you girls busy
[1:18:14] and that'll keep you busy tonight daniel
[1:18:16] 12 11.
[1:18:18] see it's after a month they set up this
[1:18:21] abomination of desolation see it's all
[1:18:23] buddy buddy for the first three and a
[1:18:24] half years right
[1:18:26] but then he breaks the covenant he wants
[1:18:28] jerusalem he because he knows satan
[1:18:29] knows that's where the
[1:18:31] city is going to be he wants to try to
[1:18:32] take over and put up his own kingdom in
[1:18:35] jerusalem
[1:18:36] but jesus is going to stop him praise
[1:18:38] god lydia go ahead
[1:18:49] yep there you go see remember the the
[1:18:51] first three and a half years was 1260
[1:18:54] days
[1:18:55] well after 1290 days that's when the
[1:18:58] pope comes in the temple said
[1:19:00] you need to worship me i'm god he's
[1:19:02] going to sit in the temple
[1:19:03] as he is god the bible said he don't
[1:19:05] last long after that
[1:19:07] the bible said that israel kills him
[1:19:08] after that not long after that
[1:19:12] yep then rome and her allies send their
[1:19:14] armies to destroy israel but god will
[1:19:17] fight
[1:19:17] for his covenant people praise god amen
[1:19:22] zechariah 12 9 says and it shall come to
[1:19:24] pass and that
[1:19:26] that day i will seek to destroy all the
[1:19:28] nations that come against jerusalem
[1:19:30] in their darkest hour jesus comes and
[1:19:33] destroys the armies according to
[1:19:35] zechariah
[1:19:37] yep according to zechariah there
[1:19:42] okay now it's not long after this
[1:19:45] that the 144 000 are revealed to
[1:19:49] uh i'm sorry or have christ revealed to
[1:19:51] them and they weep and mourn
[1:19:53] from house to house and they get born
[1:19:55] again the bible said the nation is born
[1:19:57] in one day washing away their blindness
[1:19:59] that's when daniel's
[1:20:01] uh so that's when gabriel's vision is
[1:20:03] fulfilled right there praise god
[1:20:05] the end of transgression all those
[1:20:07] things are done
[1:20:08] when jesus comes remember the bible said
[1:20:10] they weep and mourn
[1:20:11] from house to house there's a fountain
[1:20:14] open in the house of david praise god
[1:20:16] amen this is the best i know of the
[1:20:18] events by god's grace
[1:20:22] okay now during the last three and a
[1:20:24] half years here's the last things i'm
[1:20:25] going to say here
[1:20:27] the wrath of god is poured out upon the
[1:20:30] beast worshipers
[1:20:31] who rejected jesus christ remember the
[1:20:33] bible said they'll try to hide
[1:20:34] themselves in caves and mountains and
[1:20:36] dens
[1:20:37] but the bible said they won't be able to
[1:20:38] escape death they'll try to die but they
[1:20:41] won't be able to die
[1:20:42] because god's going to torment them for
[1:20:44] rejecting the holiness of jesus christ
[1:20:46] thank god we can live holy today praise
[1:20:48] god because they don't want to be holy
[1:20:50] they
[1:20:50] they don't care about holiness they
[1:20:52] can't even repent of their sins the
[1:20:54] bible says
[1:20:55] so they're worthy of the worst judgments
[1:20:58] during this time we see it plainly
[1:21:01] the seven trumpets are blown in the
[1:21:04] second half of the 70th week
[1:21:06] revelation 8 9 and 11 all those uh
[1:21:10] trumpets
[1:21:11] fall upon mankind right after this the
[1:21:13] seven last plagues and vials are poured
[1:21:15] out
[1:21:16] according to revelation chapters 15 and
[1:21:18] 16.
[1:21:20] praise god my and then jesus comes back
[1:21:24] for armageddon the bible said
[1:21:25] every eye on earth sees him and they
[1:21:29] wail at him so that must be after he
[1:21:32] took up the 144 thousand
[1:21:33] then he comes back but this time he
[1:21:35] comes back with fire in his eyes
[1:21:37] and everybody wails because he's coming
[1:21:40] to judge
[1:21:41] and the bible said when the battle of
[1:21:43] armageddon begins
[1:21:45] christ defeats the pope antichrist
[1:21:47] remember he speaks the word
[1:21:49] and a sword comes out of his mouth
[1:21:50] superbook did a good job on that battle
[1:21:52] boy that was powerful
[1:21:54] that was a good imagination that they
[1:21:55] tapped into he comes out and jesus
[1:21:58] you know satan is like a little he's
[1:22:00] like a huge massive serpent right
[1:22:02] we probably won't be like that but
[1:22:03] anyways they they come against the the
[1:22:05] white army
[1:22:06] and the sword comes out of his mouth and
[1:22:08] destroys all who gather themselves to
[1:22:11] defy
[1:22:11] jesus christ but again the word of god
[1:22:14] prevails
[1:22:14] because the word of god is sharp and
[1:22:16] quick and alive amen
[1:22:18] hallelujah nothing can defeat god's word
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:21] no matter how many armies no matter how
[1:22:23] much devil power you got
[1:22:25] nothing defeats god's word amen
[1:22:28] hallelujah
[1:22:29] and then jesus takes the pope antichrist
[1:22:32] and the the spirit of the beast the
[1:22:34] antichrist spirit
[1:22:35] and cast both of them alive into the
[1:22:37] lake of fire what a picture that's going
[1:22:39] to be
[1:22:40] that's at the end of the battle of
[1:22:42] armageddon
[1:22:44] and the bible said we the bible said we
[1:22:46] must remain there in heaven because then
[1:22:48] jesus
[1:22:48] calls for fire and the remember the
[1:22:51] volcanoes
[1:22:52] burst right volcanoes burst uh brother
[1:22:55] said it might even be atomic fire and it
[1:22:58] burns the whole
[1:22:59] outer core or outer crust of the earth
[1:23:02] and let's close with malachi 4 1-3 so
[1:23:04] maokai you're mauka maokai read maokai
[1:23:07] four one through three
[1:23:12] this is where the earth is healed
[1:23:18] malachi 4 three
[1:23:46] and the church said amen let's stand to
[1:23:48] our feet what a picture of healing
[1:23:51] after all these evil armies are gathered
[1:23:53] now remember some of them are going to
[1:23:54] live right because
[1:23:55] during the millennium there's got to be
[1:23:57] a few nations build up and then
[1:23:58] eventually they populate the earth
[1:24:00] but many of those armies those demon
[1:24:02] armies jesus's word comes out it
[1:24:04] it strikes him and burns up like fire
[1:24:07] all around the earth
[1:24:09] and the bible said once that fire dies
[1:24:10] down a little bit then we come down to
[1:24:12] earth and we start walking upon the
[1:24:14] ashes
[1:24:15] of the wicked and jesus starts healing i
[1:24:18] imagine
[1:24:19] i imagine jesus will go first he'll
[1:24:20] start walking and you'll start seeing
[1:24:22] all the ashes turn to green
[1:24:25] right everywhere he walks it's just
[1:24:26] gonna start healing the earth praise god
[1:24:31] we'll walk a little bit on ashes and
[1:24:32] pretty soon we'll see the healing spread
[1:24:35] all around the world the bible says that
[1:24:38] and the bible says we're going to be
[1:24:39] like calves in a barn
[1:24:42] what do they do they just eat all day
[1:24:45] and we're just going to be with jesus
[1:24:46] all day
[1:24:48] we'll be sitting learning from jesus in
[1:24:49] the millennial temple the temple's now
[1:24:51] anointed oh my can you imagine that
[1:24:53] we'll all go to the temple jesus will be
[1:24:55] there the holy holy fire will fall from
[1:24:57] heaven and nobody can go in the temple
[1:24:59] because of the glory of god amen praise
[1:25:01] god amen i can't wait to be there praise
[1:25:04] the lord
[1:25:07] and everything is healed now and then we
[1:25:09] just get to sin the temple after the
[1:25:11] spirit clears out you know
[1:25:13] we'll send the temple and each and just
[1:25:15] each and every day just feast on god's
[1:25:17] word just like cavs
[1:25:18] we'll stay in his presence feeding on
[1:25:20] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:25:22] man
[1:25:23] praise god i didn't hear you thank you
[1:25:25] jesus wow what a time
[1:25:27] we don't want to miss it church don't
[1:25:28] miss it for anything praise god
[1:25:30] let's live holy now let's love jesus
[1:25:32] christ now let's love the lamb now
[1:25:34] praise god and when he comes we'll be
[1:25:35] his children he'll take us away from
[1:25:37] this place
[1:25:38] amen musicians you can come
[1:25:42] the son of righteousness will arise
[1:25:46] with healing in his wings praise god boy
[1:25:48] does this earth need healed church
[1:25:50] my does it need healed right now but
[1:25:54] it's got to go through some more
[1:25:55] judgments first
[1:25:56] thank god though we'll be spared we're
[1:25:58] trusting in that
[1:25:59] we know god's word can never fail our
[1:26:01] faith is in that we've got thus saith
[1:26:03] the lord in that we've got the word of
[1:26:04] the lord from god's prophet
[1:26:06] also in the bible as well along with
[1:26:08] brother branham we have thus saith the
[1:26:10] lord on these things thank god for his
[1:26:12] mercy
[1:26:12] let's bow heads here for a moment
[1:26:17] church we just want to be ready remember
[1:26:19] why brother man preaches to show this
[1:26:20] part doesn't belong
[1:26:22] to us right now there's a pause there's
[1:26:24] a gap in this
[1:26:25] between the 69th and 70th week there's a
[1:26:28] gap
[1:26:28] and inserted is a time for jesus to get
[1:26:30] a bride
[1:26:33] a bride for his namesake and lord
[1:26:36] willing since i'm done with this chapter
