THE LORD thy God and I changed I'm the LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases forgiveth all thine iniquities and restores my youth like an eagle Lord we pray that these few words by testimony tonight I'd be pleasing to you Lord and might help somebody here that's in this congregation and we believe this building we could say it was good to be in the house of God has those disciples were walking along on the road to Emmaus and they were talking about the Lord your prophet said if we'll talk about him there you'll come in our presence there he was lord I pray tonight as we talk about you you will be here in a special way as we dedicate this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen we greet you tonight and they belong just you know it's kind of strange that my message tonight was supposed to be the juniper-tree in the unseen but it got changed this morning could say you can see I was not sure because I brought these other notes with me this morning I said I better take them with me because you don't know what I usually am gonna never hardly ever change my mind there's been a few times when I'm going to pre-fit I just couldn't get I couldn't get settled in everything and I my wife sent me a message I said I was worried about you and I prayed she praying for me cuz I was worried about you my everything was fine but my mind was not fixed yet so I make her prayers helped a man so now we're going to talk about the mission field we're gonna talk about my testimony a little bit too and we're going to put it together but goes to some interesting things you may not know and we will tell you tonight so if you turn in your Bibles we mentioned this this morning we want to read in Acts check 26 and we would like begin reading in verse 12 as the great Apostle Paul is giving his testimony to King Agrippa you ought to understand now he first stood before Felix the Roman and the room and turned him over to Agrippa and here was Paul wasn't Roman you know he could plead his case but he was giving his testimony sometimes we can give our testimony that's a great thing to do I just tell you this I gave my testimony in 1995 in a form of a message in Baguio City and the pillar fire appeared in the service i've snow pillar of fire as peered in more than one time in the meetings in the philippines it was taken captured by film and i have the film that nothing wrong with the camera I've seen the supernatural and I've seen great things but here we want to read now we're alone as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief preached at midday Oh King I saw away a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me in them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted but arise stand upon my feet for I've appeared unto thee for this purpose to make the a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and the things in which I will appear unto thee delivering V from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and turn and to turn from darkness to light turn the from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me I like that by faith that is with me you know one time Paul said the Word of God is nigh me even in my heart the word of faith that I preach sometimes we don't have to call him then we just call him up amen amen we're applauding Oh King Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision you may be seated make his blessings to the reading of it if I could just put a little title to this a little message tonight then I don't know how long we'll be here but I hope it will become interesting you not ashamed of my heritage not ashamed of my heritage now it's amazing how that King Agrippa heard this testimony and he was almost persuaded to be a Christian almost that's not good enough is it almost you know we go back to his hair it just like I told you this morning he come from from the it's a truth you can look it up you can search it out if you want but now and some 16-6 David said the lines are fallen unto me in Pleasant places a measuring line yea I have a goodly heritage a portion or an inheritance the Bible says were joint heirs with Jesus Christ in heavenly places sometimes we can give a testimony but it's a great thing now my testimony starts when I was at a crib as a baby I could remember in the crib as a baby now you might not believe this but I can remember at the end my bed seeing a demonic spirit in flesh you know what it said to me when you get older I'm gonna get you now some people say that was just your imagination that is stood out in my mind I'm 72 years old and I will never forget it but you know what he didn't get me but he tried to if you will see my life as it went on he would look like he was going to get me but he didn't get me now I'm thankful tonight I can say this was an honest heart I am glad that it raised in a message home because I mean it wouldn't you couldn't say there was a message distinctly distinctively that many years ago in a sense but I'm glad I'm that I was raised in a Southern Baptist off yield of profit you know what he was ordained in a Southern Baptist Church preacher Davis was a Southern Baptist preacher that's hell [Music] senior moment Willie Upshaw heard about the message was from brother Davis and that's how you know and what really Upshaw was either I think president of the Southern Baptist Convention or something yeah and I'm glad I was raised that I was raised in a strict Oh as a little boy as a little boy they would stand me behind something you know I guess I had to sit on stand on something and they would give me long speeches to memorize and say in this big church and I would get up and do what I was supposed to do I did it whether I was sick or not many times I was sick but I did it and it was it was what you call education for me how do you know what's going to happen later on and I thought when my father died this old man that I knew oh man walked up to me he said I remember teeth when you would get up as a little boy and you would give your speeches he said that's the best entertainment we had that's right that was a raising you know without the strict raising of a father like I say I was glad to be raised in a strict oh my I mean my dad we didn't my dad didn't believe in card playing we didn't play an old maid or anything like that if I got using baseball cars my dad as a whip me good we didn't believe in gambling didn't believe in dancing if they did square dancing in the school they tried to make me do that they'd have Oh they'd have a man there that was six foot two with broad shoulders telling me you better not do that they saw him they wouldn't do it I'm glad for that kind of reason you know I got my discipline with an old belt you know my dad would come home from work and have an old sweat belt and he would lay that bill on the dining room tech just for me to watch and look but you know I inherited that belt used I used the belt measure on my boys to I think worked on me it'll work on them also and it did work on them I've told this story many times I'm going to give you a little bit of life store we're going to go all the way down to when I got married all the way down to the house of Nathan Ohio and then the mission field I'm gonna try to get moving on real good if I don't lose my lose my place and I think I've almost lost it I'm having a senior moment yeah when you get my age sometimes you have a senior moment but I remember one time you know I don't know if I told the story here before you know back in the back in the 60s of the smoking was a big thing smoking cigarettes everybody smoked my dad was raised on a farm down in Tennessee he told me one time he said when I was a little boy everybody smoked down he was a little fella smoking a cigarette and Here Come his daddy and his daddy almost caught him my dad said I swaddled cigarette well my my father hated smoking Deacon's in our church smoked and they go out on the front menthe dad hated smoke and worse than anything he hated drinkin and stuff like that and I remember as a young model fifteen year old boy I thought man I'm gonna smoke me some cigarettes in it I did I remember the first one I sloped I coughed like crazy but it got easier and easier but I remember that I'm getting away with murder I'm getting away with murder my daddy ain't gonna catch me my daddy was smarter than I thought you know when you're 16 year 1516 you think your daddy ain't got no smarts at all you find out he's really smart I when I had my first car was a 54 Chevrolet and my dad would let me drive that back then you could unhook the speedometer and I don't hook the speedometer so my dad wouldn't see how many miles I drove our speak stick he could be but I found out that every time my dad saw somebody smoking a cigarette and I'd say man I like that that guy's not me he's I mean like a hero my dad said but he smokes so I would the rule our house was right here and the road went down like that and turned to another road and I would walk down there and turn to the other road and get me one of it then go back home my dad probably smelled it what it was honest a Saturday night and I put my clothes on the bedpost shirt pants and on Sunday morning at class doghouse you better get up on Sunday morning or you'll have cold water in your face and that morning I didn't want to get up and I got cold water in my face and I got up I'll put my shirt on my pants on and went out I can remember my sister was standing here and my dad and I don't know why but I had forgot that the cigarettes in this pocket and I bent over and the cigarettes fell out right in front of my father you know what a trauma is that's when you don't remember what happened God is my witness I don't remember what happened it was that bad I'm so faithful I'm thankful I remember one time I got my first car my dad said go ahead go down the road stick shift you know and I went down the road and I stalled it out turned the corner same way I turned the corner smokeless cigarettes and here old drunk barreling down the road he stopped at the last minute he got out was going to give me a hard time and this thing I saw was my father he was watching me all the time like my Heavenly Father here watching every move I made he looked a bit my dad was 6 to about 220 broad shoulders black hair flattop haircut did that drunk drunk drunk around him took off that's when my Heavenly Father is hey man resist the devil and he shall flee hey man I'm glad for that heritage raised in a Southern Baptist home man you can't get away from that Baptist doctrine I was indoctrinated as a 10 year old boy now Sunday School in the Southern Baptist they had classes for boys and classes for girls the boys had their teacher and I learned a lot in Sunday school in fact when I was 10 years old they gave me a Smith's Bible hardback Bible dictionary and you know what I never used that dictionary until I was called to preach and I still got it in 1957 that was given to me they must have seen something in me but somebody happened years went on graduated from high school my dad got me a job at General Motors and you know everything was going good I had worked there a year and I got laid off after one year you got unemployment and sub I'm gonna party for a while you know it's is this on tape well I had my 63 Chevrolet two-door hardtop 327 300 horsepower man that's back in the muscle days you know and what you did there's a freshman with Frisch's it's no longer their own POA street and you would cruise and about get off work about 12 o'clock and pick up my buddy he'd get out of his car because he drove a Halina convertible and that was square back then you had to have a two-door hardtop to be in and so we drove I'm freshness and you know what he said to me we were driving through that you want to meet a couple of sisters sure wife can't standeth I tell this he said they're looking for husbands my wife says that I wasn't looking for no husband and so we got in the backseat my life was ruined I'd already told my mom and dad a few months before I'll never get married but it was love at first sight so every night every night I wouldn't call him from home cuz I did what my mom and dad hearing me I never would hardly call a girl oh my dad hear myself I'd go to precious payphone and I'm old place then and I'd say can I come out said you'd come out next night can you come out sure you come out next night can you come out sure you every night hey this is going good until I got a letter report for your physical in Cincinnati being drafted into the armed forces that had went on for three weeks so when I I took her home the last night known her for three weeks I asked her will you marry me and she said yes now that's quick innit well then I went to Creek for thirteen months we got married when I home but let me tell you something halfway through my duty station a Korea I found out I need to go to Japan have a good time or I could fly home on a military hop flying with the cargo and go home for free I thought it over I'm going home and you're the reason I was going home I wasn't going home seeing my mother and father but when I flew on that big cargo jet the cargo was in the middle and we sent like this like that all the way from Korea to LA I don't remember any bathrooms I can't remember being said but I did that for one reason passion like I get to that Airport then when you went to the airport they could come down they didn't have to wait they come right down to you so I could see her face and I've often thought if I can have that same kind of a passion well I could why can't I put Co him on the front of that compassion for Saints compassion for sinners well this started something because around 1966 the house of faith in Dayton Ohio pastor Frank Ramey maybe I don't know exactly when was going missing and putting somebody in controls the service what he was doing he was going to Jeffersonville Indiana and my understanding was there when the seals was preached and when he came back went to a motel and I'm over it said he got him a room he said brother Brennan is either a prophet a true prophet or a false prophet there can't be no in between so he went there and he waited and he testified that an angel came in the room and touched him he went back to the church he said I'm changing the order of the church and anybody here that wants to be rebaptised in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you come forward you know who was the first one that come for mom mother law sister Lena died she testifies I didn't even understand at first but I was following my pastor would you believe some of them that got rebaptised wanted to get baptized back again in name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost that's the truth he preached the message West Virginia Kentucky in Ohio and sent up hundreds of books every week well he was on a Sunday morning we got high got home from Korea me and my wife not come home from California because after I got home from free I was stationed in California to Nike missile base we got married and went to California and what we got home I was in a big our home church and I was under conviction and I went to the altar they got the membership booked out like that then asked me to pray or anything I went home and suffered through that praying to get the victory praying to get the victory but my I think it was that night my wife went to the house of faith and butwho her way to Calvary I was baptized the name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost and she was baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ that was in 1968 twelve years went by many things happened I remember I told my you go to your torch and I'll go to mine but I did something was insane for me I said I'll give you half my ties you give him to your church and I'll take mine brother Ramey testifies her body had left him he lived off my ties you know and and I go to pick her up and man I said are they ever gonna quit in there and my wife and look out the window and brother Amy what he would do it don't worry about Keith he's gonna be all right because it was it was about 1976 I already knew I had a call to preach I took two young people trustee and the Baptist Church but I couldn't be a deacon or preach you know that was true and it would be the same way if your the message of her if your wife wasn't unbeliever you know so that was good doctrine I was raised with that good doctrine but he came mother Amy had an aneurysm almost died had to give up the church and he moved away and he came back from West Virginia he lives in Arizona he's in his 90s but when he came back to the church to hold a meeting I went I always said I like brother Amy but I didn't really like what he believed you know I liked him so my mother-in-law myself and my wife were sitting over by the side and Raymond preaching about the chosen seed of Abraham he lays this Bible kind of hard on the pulpit he walks around to where I'm at he brother Mike Siebert was in this meeting he grabbed me by the head like this in yanked my head that was dangerous back to him then yanked my head down like that I had a terrible you know you yanked my head down like that and he pointed to my wife I couldn't see it I heard it there's a lot of people in that meeting said this what brother Amy this one brother I know exactly what he said he said told my wife God was already dealing with my wife to follow me wherever I go he pointed to her you follow brother Keith for every ghost because he's a chosen seed of Abraham but you know that wasn't good enough she read were Gideon had put a fleece out so she put a fleece out under the kitchen a jar and said I'm not even sure how many flies I can't remember for sure she said if so many flies is in this jar the next morning I do it she coming up the next morning you know what was in that jar that amount of flies was in that jar so she followed me wherever I went from Timbuktu it got to a place that I would I would I tell I tell her I'll go visit the church first and if I like it will go back to next week that way we will you won't have to go because I visit one after the other I didn't like it visit us I didn't like it so I found a little Church and Bradford Ohio called God's Tabernacle it was a renegade preacher had been a knew about the message but didn't believe the message believed in water baptism he got kicked out of the Missionary Church and he was involved in the Christian school ministry and I got involved with you I travel with him I don't know if you ever heard of Lester roll-off yeah I been I been out there twice I was at Lister Roloffs and then it was also another time when Lester roll-off was going to be jail and all the ministers were ganging hands around there I got the video if you could get the Vil here they stand you'll see me as a young man in that video I was out there for six days I still believe he was a man of God and I don't doubt whatsoever I believe I'll see him in the rapture he was a man of faith had a 90% success rate and they were going to come the closing now I traveled I dropped you ever heard of Chris CLA Christian lul Association I was involved with Christian law so she I was there when it got started in Gary Indiana yes I've been around I've been to places whatever like I came here member the guys name you ask him he'll know my name the guy that started it became governor but all that my wife would put message books out lay him on the table top the refrigerator and I'd tell her don't you put them books out you put him back up she'd put him back up but she put him out again I'd tell her put him up she'd put him out get my wake garage sales I'd find out about it one time I found out that my pastor bandeja Baptist Temple his his wife came over and she gave he gave her she gave him some books I said oh no I'm ruined I found out my Brandon might or something oh Lord Oh chained well I tell you what you don't know how you don't know what it's like to be chastised for 12 years I was beat to death by God himself I'm getting a wreck getting to my mission man okay until a lot more in this I could say I'll say this man my wife used to get into arguments I believe in angels I believe in a visitation of angels I've seen more than one angel personally and me and my wife would get into arguments all of a sudden my that her hands would go like that and we would hear this humming noise outside the window outside the window there was nothing humanly outside that window but we would hear that noise and God would do that so we I couldn't hit her or anything like that because I had this temper God's always on the job and many times God was dealing with me I believed in serpents see before I came in the message I shared cerfancy wood brother war before I ever came in the message I'm reading those books she I get it down was he going to talk about them bad I'd get it out every time I pulled the one down also frigerator he was talking about the bad and I did in my car Ted Lewis I'd get in my car sometimes I'd hear him preach my wife didn't have any idea that this was happening my godly mother-in-law I preached her funeral a couple years she died at 96 year a sister of faith I mean if you ask her to pray about something it come to pass but you know those things are though that was for me for my growing up I didn't know what was in store but there come a place when you're Joe dissatisfied I wanted the victory so one day on my road to work I had this 76 international pickup truck with a lift on the back we lived on 10 acres up and it's in Ohio dark County close to Greenville I remember this if you could have saw me talk you could have saw my lips they were moving quite a bit in that vehicle you know why I was talking to an angel for in that vehicle God was speaking to me dealing with me personally Paul heard a voice I also heard a voice from down here I heard a voice and Here I am I said I said Lord I was 33 years old at that time I said I am old to the gospel because I was raised in a Baptist Church where you had to go to seminary and to be baptized over the name of Lord Jesus Christ did you know what this voice spoke I'll never forget it so simple simplicity you're not happy now but I'll make you happy so every night I would go home after work well get the victory we'd get in an argument did one day I ain't going to work I was sitting on the couch and I confessed the commission that God had given me as soon as those words left my mouth I was baptized with the Holy Ghost went out and bought me a new Bible that was in February of 1980 I've been preaching ever since I was ordained in Labor Day of 1980 well time went on I was 1980 but here come a few years down the road I got acquainted with a got a brother named Jackie Benton came good friends were posing ecchi at the camp meeting in Michigan in different places I guess or whatever he'd come to our church to preach I was preaching from 1980 this was this in 1990 around 1993 and I made a comment to brother Jackie I said the next time you go the Philippines it was going to be like I forget how many times you go the next number I'll go with you he you know on the phone I'd come home for ministers meeting and brother severs ministers meeting and brother Jackie had called on the phone I mean he stayed up late I went to bed early so sometimes he'd call me when I was already in bed but he said call me no matter what time is so I called him he said you want to go with me to the Philippines and I said I can't go so I was at work as war as retired I was at work doing my job and all of a sudden I found myself in the office calling about a ticket to the Philippines I never prayed about it and when I went I said I probably only go one time I've went 38 times you know and when I first went he was wonderful but the first time I went they took me up that mountain Tibet yo city and a brother I preached for a brother and I had really had a bad experience at this time with this brother and he dropped me off at Baguio City and I saw this little skinny preacher sitting out on the porch named brother Dan or bullet Lin here we got together at first we thought we had a disagreement from that we didn't have a disagreement well that started a relationship it started right there and when I got home he kept he sent me singing tapes now I'm gonna stop right here and don't you know something somebody paid for his ticket to go to Cape Town South Africa and he's going the guy wanted to know if I'd go with him but when I found out the price of tickets so late about $2,000 because it's so late he was gonna go July 11th I don't know what he's gonna have to pay and I couldn't go but they started a relationship the next year at a camp with Boris Soriano after that camp I said I am going to back I said no you're not no you're not no you're not said I am going there's preachers here I said I'm going I'm going I wouldn't take no for so finally there were some people going there for a holiday because baguio city in the summer is cruel whether it's like a holiday place and they took me and stayed there sick stays and they got mad cuz I stayed six days that was the first time when I was there I've reached a couple times and he said we're going to go to Gold Creek okay preach that morning preached a couple more times they were having a summer camp in gold Creek so he went to go Creek we got to an old abandoned gold koi the guy driving the jeepney went too far up the gold quarry well and I said where's the church up up that mountain ain't no Road you got to climb not that mountain I've been up that mountain many times now I don't go up the mountain lake come down that was my first experience but when we came down that day to go home the brother the jeepney turned over and a big deep ravine and here I'm in the driver's seat brother Danner says get out I said I'm getting that place if that Jeep turns over a little more I'm crushed so I climbed out the back way and then that driver drove out of there like he was crazy that's the way they drive was that was my first experience so they went on to the the third time I went I traveled with brother Jack T and we separated he went and I went north I started going north all the time for a while been so long I try to remember the name I better skip this way I can't remember his name now oh my good well he was a leper he'd always picked me up at the airport a leper that had been healed instantaneously for the Maximilian cocoa brother Max he had a beautiful home and talent the leper colonies and everybody couldn't understand how max build this home did he find see if the Japanese hit go during World War two and there's still treasure hunting going on did he find gold no I don't believe so because he always had his hand out to help somebody else he picked me up take me where I'm going then we go up the back of this before brother Dan I got a vehicle in everybody's portal almost got vehicles now and separated from Brazil I found out when I was in Manila man they would scream and holler all out in the spirit that was wonderful but when I went up to the mountains they were eager ah tribes many different tribes of the eager odds some were headhunters some were not headhunters that's where their ancestry was and kind of like brother Ram talked about the Apache engine it took a look I mean you had to gain their confidence they were more reserved I'm not saying we did it well have great meetings but when you when when finally you got their friendship you had a friend for life there were more reserved more solid not borne by every wind of doctor when I went over there there was a brother just preached at our church and he'll come to later but had just been to the Philippines he said boy there's a doctor going on there one preacher got up and preached God cannot die well I want you to know the Bible says God kid brother Branson God cannot die but he have to die I want you so when that blood cell was broke however it released God brother branham said God I we got an answer for everything we'll just stay you want to be a novice you're having it for everything you'll be confused good as the author of confusing but peace and the Churches of God so I started travelling in the north brother Joe talked a good brother of mine I could never figure out why this guy could speak so good English he helps him to church twice the pastor but he can just go so far and always notice its head with jerk I found out he was going a be Asian school and he got into drugs and what saved him because it's saved him for that life of corruption and he got healed now he's in the ministry if those if he not kept going in that and that aviation and probably never met God you could look at it in a way you see what I'm trying to say I baptized his mother and bontoc in the river with tribal markings up and down her legs because he was of the headhunters and they still hunt heads in the Philippines well this went on uh I found out I said when I go I'm not going to take sides but I found out I was taking sides with Jesus and I found out I was north I crossed over Jordan in decadence Fairland and that's what's the matter with me I could have stayed down there with the big meetings and all all the whooping howl and all the grand but I escaped a lot of corruption yeah so it went on and brother Danner now listen I'm will focus in he has put in his visa to come to the USA alright I've told a couple of other churches I even told brother cam he is a cowboy a Filipino cowboy I don't know if you've ever heard him catch his music on Facebook and the Crusades baguio city is known for one thing country music ever since I've known those brothers they've walked the mountains with cowboy boots on and we say singing our Crusades with cowboy hats on to draw the crowd I've had I couldn't tell you how many Crusades I love to preach in the churches but I love to preach outside I can tell you of the miracles that's taking place in the churches but let me tell you when I was a brother cans both oh this this is American style there was a young man came for prayer and he said I have sinned I am back slid I don't know his name God led to me to say this I said God never left you you left him and so I said it over and over I said where did you leave him you think I was browbeating him I said where did you leave me who did you leave me where did you leave it where he said finally I left he meant mother's house that I could pray for sometimes you find where the problem is before deliverance can come when I was in Canada for last time and petrolia Ontario seven confirmed healings in that meeting the last one that came was grandma little boy and she said doctors have said that he's blind in his right eye I prayed I stepped away and brother Addison was kneeling talking to the little boy I said to myself was he praying for him again no he stood up he said I held my hand over the little boy's good eye and say can you see said yes I can see no doc the signs shall follow them that believe that's not just in the church it's not just for the preacher they sign shall follow them that believe the house why book the mechanic the plumber whatever it is you can pray so this went on I've traveled for several years I'm gonna flip this in I preached against a certain system in the Philippines in this trip I rode I mentioned it with the poor nations and when I got there they took me to a stopping place been there many times del near Angeles City and when I was sitting there I'm sitting here they're all up here I just doesn't look good I was getting to be interrogated they say we consider you one of us but we want you to quit preaching against this because they blonde I said I'm about to but you ain't going to tell me what to preach and my brother Danner was sitting there never said a word cuss up the bag deal said it was in 2005 I went up to baguio city another brother was there roughly Borah sleeping in the same room and he was going to leave early in the more was so upset I snuck out and went down and I left I traveled two or three years without brother Danner and he one time he called me because I was on his on my way to the mountains to offer to dedicate his brother's house and brother Danner would call while we were on the road and talk to my driver well brother Keith come to the church and have coffee I told brother on no I say when he called her a restaurant and have coffee I told brother and Selma driver no you know why I had a dream that night in the room I was staying that brother Danner came to that house I knew what Shirdi would have on how he redressed and so we went back to the house and he called he said he's coming to the house and I told the brothers she watched when he comes gonna have this gray t-shirt on just exactly and when he came he had exactly what I said and he sent down there's me and began to weep like a baby he said what have I done what have I done and what have I done we're been back together since then we're closer now than we've ever been I could not compromise like I've traveled with him now crusade meetings you know what it's like it's wonderful to preach in a church but it's tremendous to have an outdoor crusade meeting when you've got a congregation right in front of you some are rooftops some up here some over there you don't you some dark you don't know how many I came to tell you the miracles that has taken place the souls that have been won in those crusade I've had great meetings in churches I've had great outpourings of the Holy Ghost this last time I had tremendous services but I've traveled all night to get to a place to have a cruise and then a dedication service of an anniversary but to get to this crusade meeting and you don't know what it's like when you travel all night and you're tired but you get there and you preach you know we have youth camps and believers take their kids do you come sometimes friends I think it's wonderful I had my youth meetings in their Crusades well the Clem was with me I have it down the name of the place and I couldn't even pronounce it when I give my all to service he counted him seven young people in a row heard these were not believers children these were people that hurt the singing came in I'd ask each one you give your heart to the Lord yes we want to get the heart to the Lord yes I think there was maybe five girls the last two were boys the last one was a little bitty boy and I said you want to give I mean there's I don't know how well they're cuz they're small over there I said you want to give you he said yes you know what that does I had meetings this time in the plaza in Baguio City post a billion of boosts cleanest city in the Philippines we go down there play music it was Easter Sunday I preached that morning in another place another church came back head of crusade meeting I preached my Easter message I started to garden but guests enemy all the way to the empty tomb I mean you should have seen him they were everywhere some walking some stink hundreds of people what an opportunity sometimes we got to get out of the church taking other formalities we've got too much search order sometimes sometimes we've got to get out of order to get in order hey you know one time I'm on time years ago before I came into message they were having a temp meeting brother she was having tip meeting I know where it was that I won't even try to explain that brother John Laughlin tained was one of the preachers and I went with my wife and some woman got up and spoke in tongues and interpreted and we went back to the house I told my wife I ain't never gonna do that she said you might and I have you never know what you better be careful what you say I don't have much formality anymore I'm just a Baptist any cost a Holy Baptist holiness Pentecostal that's right justify sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost believes a message of the hour there's you ever notice many times brother Branham in the mess he said that's a big word for a Baptist you remember that it said it said I'm not proud of it but I'm not ashamed of my heritage either I'm not ashamed of what God has done in my life the slack strip I could tell you many times I remember one time I was having a crew say meeting in the valley between the mountains up the mountain go down the valley I've got it written down at home I should have Brian ever thought to bring these names with me there I had two night meeting a few years ago and I remember one of the meetings there was a young man back then they dress a little better now up in the mountains but still not like to do in the lowlands there was a man coming a nice young man a leather jacket he came up like this I believe he had a gun at his hands like a gun so I prayed for him with one eye open and one eye closed my mother didn't raise a stupid boy I remember when my mother died it's been several years ago now she was sick in the hospital and I remember laying in the hospital told me she can understand everything that they say and I still remember my brother in law which is going on to be with the Lord was talking about her the underwear that she was wearing my mother was a lady you don't talk about that to my about my mother so they put her in this rest home to get recuperated and I got in my car and I left Kobol row miles down the road God spoke to me turn around and go back I went back as I was going in my sister I when he got one sick brother Walt was leaving I was going in they'd already told me I could have a room and so I'd owe them and my mother gets worse yeah they woke up in the middle of the night and what in my mother's room glass like this outside was this beautiful garden my dad I have to say was probably the best gardener I ever knew and when I went in that room there was she was here and there was chairs all the way around but one of the chairs was turned around to look at the garden and I went in that room I told my mother I said there's a young man here waiting about six foot two you know he's come to take you away I believe he was there I believe they know what's going on sometimes my dad my dad couldn't get along in this world well I said I'm gonna be with my mother till she crosses over so I went in that room he started singing bless it uh sure Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine heir of salvation purchase of God born of his spirit washed in his blood and I same one or another one after another one out they said she could understand she cannot communicate she couldn't open Rock Familia was waiting for what's this going to help her Passover so I came to give her this breathing test I said why in the world they're gonna give her a breathing test and well they were given the breathing test she went like who I hollered out gotta loud voice is she God there came back she recognized her boy's voice came back one more time and she was gone hallelujah that's my heritage many pictures was posted on Facebook about the meetings in Sagada Mountain Province there's a place on top of the mountain called Sagada one side is Sagada and the other side is Bissau you ought to understand all one side was certain eager up trot on the other side was a certainty Bullard Anna's parents was of different eager ah tribes I'm how they got together you know brother Dan thoth about his his father side if you bury your father your brother and you go to sleep at night and you have a bad dream well the medicine man will tell you your father or your brother's not happy and the clothes you marry the man so they would open the grave taping out of the grave and change their clothes a superstition like brother man talk about Superstition Mountain this morning that's the way they grew up tribes were pagan they're still pagan well the dead mother lawn follow law I don't know us a lot of people was against Hill marry sister Heidi there's a lot of there was a lot of girls in the church wanted him for those he married this girl wouldn't believe her that long and her parents was pagan my did he get a Jew I've known her for since 1994 but see I've even spoken at home pagan home lips speak words spoke when his mother law was in the hospital I preached in the university of Baguio the University of Trinidad the University of Lyon the girls I traveled the brother has a way to get in now when we would go to the mountains you could preach and give an altar call but at last April not this April Libre before when you preached there you could exhort but not altar call but this time my brother has friends in high places he got it fixed where we can preach and give an altar call with Sagada Mountain Province mini mountain up in the mountain it's called the mountain provinces you you travel into valency Oh Henner that what they is a big sign Mountain prophets churches cebongan belongin non-gaap go Creek other churches of hannahb remember their names and big erat though all of the ignorant blood but even there there's a mixture of blood because even before world war ii the japanese even during war ii the japanese were living up in those mountains if you look at brother Dan er I always called him a Japanese kamikaze pilot the way he drove one time we were going down the road and well I'll give it a story he left me behind at a certain preachers house and there were two preachers there trying to turn me against him another brother and when I got back when he got back I told him said did you ever leave me like that again so when we left that house all right well I was sitting in the vehicle I saw him on the front porch of that church reading the riot act to those preachers brother Danner was known for his temper man was he hot he was tearing them to pieces Nick fending me so he got in his little red toy out at the time it was raining it wasn't supposed to rainy we were going to bought them bought them tarrlok you ain't lived till you went to bottom bought them tarrlok I was in Oh can't think of it name another place before but in this place that same day I had preached and I was sitting under this lean-to trying to keep cool it's hot and they came to me said if you ever ate goat I said no would you like to eat some sure and he brought me brown gravy I began to eat it the more I chewed the bigger it God so I told it had a funny taste I told the brothers you eat it cuz I got a preach and a little bit that was my excuse a few days later going down the road brother Danner was laughing hysterically laughing he said you know what you ate you ate young goat with the goat dung still in it and you know what I told him you got me once you won't get me twice but I'm afraid he's probably got me two or three more times most of time they try to protect me but now it's not so bad I go to places they know me but if I go someplace they don't know me I have to eat what they put before me I've seen the ribcage of a dog in the cafeteria I saw a old mangy dog come up to church and Wilson said that same dog we got a dog restaurant here they'll take that mangy dog sell it to the dog restaurant once I myself went I myself this sister this was a belongin Buzzard Anders home place I was staying in this house and watching out the window between services I saw this sister come over argued was another sister they were loved each other but they was arguing the sister was trying to buy to the dogs but the price was too high he she went home mad why did they want the dog they wanted to eat the dog I remember when I was in Korea I wasn't living for God we go to a bar and we would order off the outside that nalli whatever and they would bring in boarder fly shrimp but it was so good and they would bring in this other stuff penny I don't remember what it's called many it was delicious every dog it was french fried on the outside with onions and meat on the inside man sgi's we just loved it finally we asked the lady that would go outside one cooked inside it was outside in the big pot what is this she said it's not all when you know us GI we had our pet dogs at home we never ate it again I remember leaving none gawa and they fixed the meal and I saw this on the table it looked like fruit fried onion rings man I love onion rings you know I asked him what is that french fried chicken guts they like the end like the outside one time brother Danner had a big pot cooked in a big pot and he was eating chicken feet pull it out crunch crunch crunch pulling out crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch I said brother Danner they got pizza house I eat pizza over there I said which would you rather have a piece pizza or chicken feet what'd he do he'd grab another chicken feet and crunch crunch crunch the answer my question you really have them chicken feet toenails and all I ain't built that way I can eat just so much rice but when I go up into the mountains you ought to grow up in the mountains potatoes and sweet potatoes are they're pretty good when I go up there fried chicken they know when I'm coming many times I believe they probably killed the last chicken when I come just for me and I don't turn it down I eat it partly because God will bless them I've been many places I walked a panoramic view one place and the lowlands near the ocean called lone Ian I remember in 1997 preaching on the porch before a church was started there and the little sister's husband in the house was in bed sick and I had this crusade meeting and I'll never forget outdoors when I gave the altar call I noticed system not the same system but another sister when I'd read the Bible she would stand and make one step forward and she had pants on and then they would had an altar service she stepped forward with her paints on you know what she said I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what I said to her are you willing to give up everything she says certainly I am I prayed for her that's the most godly sister when I go there and I see a panoramic view she's the outside will and she'll tell me that's your room every time you come here and the other little sister she's in her 90s now from those meetings when she came to the Lord she was Roman Catholic she was respected in the community as a Roman Catholic she didn't know what to give up she come - brother Danner what should I give up he said give up your pant I give it up give us up I give it up every time he'd tell her something I give it up every time I I give it up now every time I see her what a blessing it is she's got my picture up in her house she can't speak any English it has to be an interpreter the last time I preached there a couple years ago maybe not even a you two maybe a year and a half ago she heard I was coming if if they if you brother Brent said if you get the people to believe you there is nothing impossible she walked to the meeting that was going to be about seven o'clock came about three o'clock in the afternoon excited that I was going to be there and when I prayed she came into the building like that's the way she walked I prayed for prayed for others she came and she was sitting I didn't notice how she was sitting I know what she's sitting normal and she began to speak he's probably like oh no not like dr. Garland and it was interpreted to me she stood up I'm healed back standing straight up if you just get the people to believe you you can just get them to have coffee you I have gained their confidence in those mountains I've seen hundreds give a heart I couldn't tell you how many how many's been healed but in bomb talk this last time it is a mountain on top of a mountain its way up there and it's an unusual city it's just a little village what kind of promise the only site see there they have hanging mummies but they're just about all been terrorized or whatever you know gone but I used to walk down the streets I mean I'd be in the vehicle not see up in the mountain now it looked to me like Europeans usually can tell American to me they'd look is your German I don't know and I and I never ask questions for a while I'm fine I said who are these people why are they here there's nothing here some lodges well-dressed drugs cheap drugs they go there get a cheap high so ahead tonight crusade one place I traveled all night to have a crusade on all night to get back before I got home I want will that sleep for two or three days but in Sagada we put up the crusade you can't do that here at the police station overnight put all the instruments walked him up in the police station I've got pictures I didn't know they'd come in whispered to me some of those Americans they call them I don't know what they were are in the meeting they're sitting in the meeting I got pictures at home that were taken they were there listening but this two-day crusade was to me it was it was amazing I've had great Crusades I've had great healings but I come to I've come to the place when I have a crusade meeting I don't use notes I read the scripture my message is prepared here and here I'm preaching to a different kind of a congregation and it really an evangelistic message mother dinner I was supposed to this last trip to preach in a youth camp and go to another island I got a message messenger another dinner as I know were posed to do this and do this but said I have got a burden to just have crusade meetings in these places what do you say they said that's what I'm called to do brother is that that's a to agreeing that's what we did so we went there I had other Crusades this trip but when we went there was so amazing because here I am preaching to people many of them or pagan they dressed real nice but they're still pagan did I tell you what the headhunters do now this is a fact I was told this they dress just like anybody else and if you offend one they'll invite you over to their house for something to eat and cut your head off I am not making that up I've had people come people don't believe it but I got the most reliable source and there's one of those Europeans went missing in Sagada they come bodies with no head long as they don't get my head I got a nun you your head over there you know a big head I don't know you know mom in Pakistan those Pakistanis didn't like you know I I would be I would I would be preaching the only time we had daytime meetings was two or three days I give a two-door today you might say seminar brother Clem did and I would try to go out so I would go outside because there was believers outside and I go outside the building and they say get back in this building get back in the building get back in the building cause the color of this hair when I get finished preaching one of the 101 old brother would grab me and run me to the cam and get me in the cab and hold my head down when I was preaching I'm growing to Pakistan from the Philippines right now when I was in Pakistan I preached in this place this one brother now Karachi has the largest Christian community even though it's an Allah Islamic nation and it was a Pentecostal church brother Shamoon your group had been dealing with them and during this service if you ever heard the music it drive you crazy and I'm sitting there and I'm going numb from the music and I'm saying I wouldn't want them to hear that but I said what am I gonna do I got a preach Lord dealt with me to change my message I said I can in this script I was hunting was I found the scripture and you know what I did I gave my testimony with my interpreter and when we got brother Sherman had hired a Pentecostal cab driver because we leave our passports and our visas at a Muslim run hotel and we had to bypass all the checkpoints and we went in got in the car well the Shamoon begin to speak to brother Clem he said I got a secret I got a secret I got a secret Don't Tell brother Keith he whispered the secret and her brother Clem's ear and brother Clem could not hold the secret he told me the pastor stood up and spoke in Urdu and what he said after that service when I couldn't find the mind of God it had to change the service he said I'm bringing my whole church into the message and we're going to have a baptism in the river and he wanted us to baptize and they changed her mind I better not baptized in the river it may be my last time to baptize in any river over there might lose my head he never left when there's right down the road there's our Colonel Sanders and a McDonald's and you can't go we had that we stayed at this hotel had a free breakfast and traveled down them together we'd never leave each other's side we would travel down to eating and we would go in Muslim run and behind this glass the guy would smorgasbord style put out the food and that cook would look at me like he wanted me dead into the vast last day that we were there he looked at me and smiled he must have found out maybe I wasn't because they consider the United States big Satan Israel little Satan it's a marvelous place the message is in a revival there because one man separated himself from unbelief promote message Church because they told him you know what they did they told him you can't have these denominational preachers sitting on the platform I set right next to him when we were there he was the only church now there's many churches there's many believers some of them wouldn't set would be on the platform are now believing the message one man it's gone it's right something else I was gonna say about that place there was a Catholic community only Catholics and our house boy was a cricket player and he was rejected to play on the national team because he was not Muslim he was Roman Catholic and I remember on top of the roof me and brother Clem playing cricket with him yeah and we got acquainted and he invited us to his house to blessed it blessing the house is a big thing over there one time though the Shamoon said we're going to bless this house you're going to do it go and go in I went in I didn't know where he was behind me I thought I was going by myself in this dark health and when I win family spread out we would go into homes brother sir moon said you speak you speak come tell me to speak I shouldn't have left that on you I'd forget where I was at yes I met his brother brother Wilson he was a rental car man I dealt with Wilson talked to Wilson delved in against you his personality sometimes you got it you got to find out where people live so they came to our hotel before we were leaving that day next morning and I begin to deal with Wilson that's the older brother about the Godhead a Roman Catholic I said do you understand what I am saying he said yes I said if you ever received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior no I said would you like to receive him into your heart right now I let him to the Lord before we left nothing happens by accident there was a sister there that's the reason why I want to go back they had three floors we were preaching on the top floor and I went down to the second floor well no when did we start here I don't know oh how long about I've been going a long time hour and a half oh my goodness I'm gonna quit in a minute but let me tell you this I'm going to go back to the Philippines this is why I want to go back this little sister was sitting next to her pastor Shamoon every time we pray for her she gets sicker and sicker and sicker well she would miss her at that time I begin to deal with her about divine healing in a paradox what divine healing was and God quick and me I said if you ever receive Jesus Christ into your heart I led her to the Lord Jesus there and every time I would see in another meeting she had this horrible look on her face next meeting horrible look in pain at the fourth meeting I looked out she had a joyful look like God had finally touched her divine healing so your paradoxes when it happens to me D divine healing is a process my to happen today why not having them all when I have a next week but it will happen then go back to the Philippines in Sigala we have youth meetings a my I never had so many young people come I'm preaching and I see these people up here I see him over here and I'm preaching to them I'm reaching I was preaching to the young people and they came right off the street may not have known anything about God under convincing I want you to know everyone that comes to the altar and these Crusades gets a follow-up visit every single one I could go on and on I didn't know I talked that long I could go on I could go on for hours hours and hours you know I'm an evangelist but I don't know a model of his missions I don't know if you call me a missionary whatever you want to call me but I love the mission field I'm getting old I don't know how many more times I can go my god help me to go to Pakistan one more time I'll just tell you this I'm going to close before we were going to Pakistan me and brother Clem went to make our passports in with the application and brother clam looked at his passport and said my passports expired he said you just go without me I said I'm not going if I get my head cut off you're gonna get your head cut off too that's probably not an exaggeration Amen God is good I could just keep telling you and telling you more and more and more and more but I'm gonna finish with this part here I had notes right here Isaiah 58 14 no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper every tongue shall write every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment that shall condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord for I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth but Brannon was he loved missions here he loved Africa he loved all those places he desired I want to go back there's something different about the mission feel something different than here and sometimes when I come back it's almost depressing because I don't see the I don't see the desire for soul here like it is there it's not the same he that when it snows is wise the righteous is a tree of life and he then what it shows is wise you are a tree of life to every unbeliever you look good in you you're God's representative you are God's mouthpiece your dog's legs you are God's arm you are God's ears you are God's eye you're God's ball your goods know you know what God is hey man hey man I shall close I have looked at my wife I couldn't my watch I couldn't believe that whoo how bad for an old man is it you know when I preach I hear from my theophany and I'm going to close and you know my theophany he's on about 20 21 years old and when I you know when I was in the army my waist was 31 I weigh when I got out 173 pounds I have a feeling when I got out I was about 21 when in nineteen mafia often he only weighs 173 he's six foot one he ain't overweight a man when I hear from him I'm hearing from what I used to be a man but I'm gonna be what I hallelujah hey Jesus when he sent up disciples he said whatever city entered they receive you eat such things yes God's Word will never return boy the Bible said men that have hazarded their lives their lives he said he didn't tell it this time but last time he said he'd have to preach so quiet because if they got loud the Muslim guards and other places and nearby buildings would hear him with guns they come in and kill him if they heard him singing so they'd have to get up to preach whispering they'd hazard their lives for denomination for money no for the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus inch once you come here and that's just our heads in just a moment here let's just bow our heads and yeah I just had on my heart I just had those scriptures there you know I just want to thank the Lord for this wonderful testimony service in the harvest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
