[32:16] verse 24 when will you write to the Word
[32:19] of God today
[32:20] Greece is Lord after you 824 I'd like to
[32:26] continue on the fear series and preach
[32:29] tonight why are ye fearful I like to
[32:31] preach Jesus's words there why are you
[32:34] fearful Matthew a 24 by the grace of the
[32:42] Lord very familiar story this week I
[32:49] listened to the sermon go away Jesus
[32:50] from 1963 so even though I got this
[32:53] raishin for this message that's where I
[32:54] got the inspiration from that message
[32:57] and of course from heaven by God's grace
[32:58] by the Holy Spirit so we like to listen
[33:00] to that I think you would enjoy it by
[33:03] the grace of the Lord Matthew 8 24
[33:05] through there segment and behold there
[33:08] arose a great tempest in the sea in so
[33:11] much that the ship was covered with the
[33:13] waves but he was asleep and his
[33:17] disciples came to him and awoke him
[33:19] saying lord save us we perish he saith
[33:23] unto them why are ye fearful o ye of
[33:26] little faith
[33:27] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[33:29] the sea and there was a great calm but
[33:33] the men marvelled saying what manner of
[33:34] man is this that even the wind's and the
[33:37] sea obey what manner of man is our Lord
[33:40] Jesus Christ and he's got bad that's not
[33:44] what is writing on your heart is making
[33:46] as we approach Heavenly Father we love
[33:48] you tonight Lord these words are just as
[33:52] true to ninety two thousand years later
[33:53] as they were or the night miss happened
[33:57] dear God as the disciples and you were
[33:59] crossing the Sea of Galilee Lord got the
[34:02] Lord what manner of man you are Lord but
[34:05] even the wind's and the sea obey your
[34:07] God how much more tonight Lord will the
[34:11] situation than the storms of Our Lives
[34:13] obey your word Lord whatever your word
[34:16] would safety us up us to hear your word
[34:18] this evening Lord God we know there's
[34:21] natural flooding Lord God in our country
[34:23] we ask God that you move back the waters
[34:26] Lord God the souls and lives might be
[34:29] saved
[34:30] father we also know the enemy comes in
[34:32] like a flood well we know there's times
[34:34] it seems as though Satan is flooding
[34:36] into our lives Lord and overwhelming us
[34:39] and as we have no answer for the floods
[34:43] of scenes trials and temptations father
[34:46] we asked in Jesus Christ day the Spirit
[34:48] of God raises the standard against the
[34:50] Lord God bring the great column to the
[34:53] to our lives Lord God bring great Lord
[34:55] victory to our lives and we'll give you
[34:57] all the glory Lord take us a little
[34:59] higher in Christ tonight Lord God as we
[35:01] sit at your feet Lord as Mary sat at
[35:03] your feet man we receive something
[35:05] tonight Lord that will not be taken from
[35:07] us Lord God for we've chosen to sit at
[35:10] your dear feet in order to have the nail
[35:13] prints and then Lord God we'd say those
[35:15] bloody feet Lord God that left the
[35:17] bloody footprints Lord we've chosen as
[35:19] to the truth means our night dear Jesus
[35:21] and we know you will need this
[35:23] supportive ellicott when we come to
[35:24] worship you and the year that I want to
[35:27] the Lord answer to us now about the
[35:29] grace of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ
[35:31] that we did which I said maybe see you
[35:34] there grace god complete house of lords
[35:37] night one see the Saints here tonight
[35:41] God's face praise the Lord
[35:44] I can look at the start here tonight why
[35:46] are you here
[35:48] we should be here said we're not here
[35:51] for anymore there's any fear in us we
[35:53] should be here say we're not fearful
[35:54] that did you notice the ship was covered
[35:57] with ways you notice that many times our
[35:59] lives feel like we're just covered in
[36:01] confusion
[36:02] we're covered in fear we're covered in
[36:05] trials to see Mike work we're coming
[36:07] home were covered Church were covered
[36:10] seemed like everywhere our lives are
[36:12] just overwhelmed with trials and no
[36:15] doubt that's what the disciples were
[36:16] feeling here they're covered with
[36:19] Williams I gather Bibles let's go to
[36:21] Luke 822 there's another way to look at
[36:26] it here I kind of want to build off of
[36:27] Sunday's message about the law of
[36:29] perfect faith a little bit like to build
[36:30] off of that by the grace of Lord tonight
[36:33] now it came to pass on a certain day
[36:35] Luke 822 that he said I'm sorry that he
[36:39] went into a ship with his disciples and
[36:41] he said unto them let us go over unto
[36:43] the other side of the lake and they
[36:45] launched forth so sea they went into
[36:49] this they went into this voyage at his
[36:52] command you've gone into your life at
[36:55] his command he sent you for he's the one
[36:58] that sent you out into the sea how many
[36:59] believe that he's the one that sent you
[37:01] out inaccurate where's the love right
[37:04] David ye Center sport and if he sends
[37:07] forth and he's with us he's always going
[37:09] to be with him hey man as they found out
[37:12] verse 23 as they sailed he fell asleep
[37:15] and there came down a storm of wind on
[37:18] the lake noticed a came down right from
[37:21] the prints and power of the air look at
[37:23] that in a moment and they were fiddled
[37:25] with water and were in jeopardy so their
[37:28] lives were in jeopardy
[37:29] their lives were hanging the balance and
[37:32] not only was it covered in waves but the
[37:35] waves were coming in it was coming in to
[37:39] their ship the the trouble was coming in
[37:42] very close to that
[37:43] as you can see right and they came name
[37:46] awoke him saying master master we perish
[37:48] then he arose and rebuked the wind and
[37:51] the raging of the water and they ceased
[37:53] and there was a call and he said that
[37:56] where is your faith and they being
[38:00] afraid wondered
[38:00] say one another what manner of man is
[38:02] this for he commanded even the winds of
[38:05] the water they obey Him and they arrived
[38:07] at the country of the gadarenes which is
[38:09] over against Galilee
[38:11] amen now another portion I don't have I
[38:14] don't remember where it is in mark or I
[38:16] think it's a mark
[38:17] but Jesus said o ye of little faith
[38:20] or he said you have no faith so one
[38:23] place he said little pate another place
[38:25] he said you have no faith so what do we
[38:28] understand that member jesus prayed for
[38:31] Peter and his crucifixion remember right
[38:33] before that and said I prayed for you
[38:35] that your faith fail not so the
[38:37] disciples had faith but in this
[38:39] situation they didn't have faith right
[38:41] didn't have a whole lot of faith and
[38:43] that's what Jesus is saying here
[38:44] they have little faith in this situation
[38:47] because remember we said last a few
[38:49] weeks ago they had faith enough to wake
[38:51] him up grace God that makes enough to
[38:54] find somebody that could bring the word
[38:56] to Baxter right they had enough faith to
[38:59] do that but when it came to speaking
[39:00] themselves for as little of me speaking
[39:03] this big huge storm of waste they had no
[39:06] or little favorite in that situation but
[39:08] they had faith in Christ right and that
[39:11] faith could not be taken from that
[39:12] because jesus said pray for that maybe
[39:14] then and Jesus loved that a Jesus called
[39:17] them and Jesus was with them but when it
[39:20] came down to this situation of their
[39:21] lives their faith wasn't strong enough
[39:23] to meet the challenge of the hour I've
[39:25] never been there before where you felt
[39:27] like your faith wasn't strong enough to
[39:28] beat the challenge of the hour when it
[39:30] comes down to it we remember that Jesus
[39:32] said there's no trial given to you
[39:34] that's too much for you to bury then so
[39:37] their faith was strong enough to bear in
[39:39] this case their faith wasn't strong
[39:41] enough to speak but their faith was
[39:43] strong enough to find somebody that
[39:45] would speak the Word of God it church
[39:47] many times it happens to us I think it
[39:49] brought ourselves you know many times
[39:50] when we come up for prayer that's why we
[39:52] come up for prayer we wanted the unite
[39:54] our faith with somebody else
[39:56] what are you not even the preacher we
[39:58] were united with the church and that's a
[40:00] good thing to do we should call the
[40:02] house with the church the Bible said and
[40:03] pray the prayer of faith that's why we
[40:07] pray together that's why we gather
[40:09] together rain but perhaps if you got
[40:10] perfect faith you wouldn't even need to
[40:12] come up for air
[40:13] and then it would happen right like that
[40:15] right again perfect bait it would happen
[40:17] instantly but how they don't realize we
[40:19] need that faith of others to be united
[40:21] with our faith that's why I was fine
[40:24] it's wonderful to come up and pray we're
[40:26] just you DYI we're putting our face with
[40:28] somebody else's faith and that's a
[40:31] wonderful thing to do now I want to
[40:34] begin by looking at these socks here and
[40:38] the prophets of the context of this
[40:41] story was Jesus just got done with a
[40:43] great healing campaign
[40:45] have you read the earlier the chapter in
[40:46] chapter 8 and brother bears of this but
[40:50] if said Jesus foresaw that after he
[40:54] sailed across this lake or the Sea of
[40:56] Galilee he foresaw that he had to deal
[40:58] with the maniac of Gamera who was a
[41:02] demon-possessed man right
[41:04] so Jesus was probably praying and
[41:07] fasting this whole time because some
[41:09] demons only go out by prayer fasting he
[41:12] just out of campaigns right he's
[41:15] preached all days pray all day if
[41:17] anybody had a right to be tired or
[41:19] sleepy it was our Lord because he just
[41:22] got through tiring feeties right and any
[41:25] of anyone that knows the Spirit of God
[41:26] when the Spirit of God is flowing
[41:28] through you and people are pulling on
[41:30] you for hurts you you get weak right
[41:33] I've seen it numerous times of people
[41:36] get he owner or God if people really
[41:38] want another word of God I believe
[41:39] you're totally drained it's hard to wake
[41:40] up Monday morning or Thursday morning
[41:42] it's hard to wake up because if they're
[41:44] pulling virtue out of you the box of the
[41:46] type of Jesus and birch went out of him
[41:49] and so in this case Jesus without you
[41:52] weren't you falling out of it he knows
[41:54] he foresaw my vision I've got to deal
[41:56] with that demon the Legion of demons I
[41:58] gotta deal with them so brother have
[42:00] said he was tired after preaching a pray
[42:03] for the sick he knew he had to cast out
[42:05] the demons out of Legion so he wanted to
[42:08] get some rest but Maddox said he was so
[42:11] humid he could cry he was so human he
[42:14] could even die program said he said now
[42:17] the in other words he said the great
[42:20] revival their last campaign was over he
[42:24] said and the sciples gather
[42:26] he said that the front of the ship while
[42:28] Jesus is sleeping and he said prevents
[42:33] types them but that place there on the
[42:35] boat now and the revivals over Jesus is
[42:39] sleeping the disciples are gathered
[42:41] around and prevents that they're
[42:43] discussing what they just saw Jesus dude
[42:46] brother types of to say that this he
[42:49] said in our day he said we just got
[42:51] through a great healing revival meetings
[42:54] of the forties and fifties and sixties
[42:56] he's tightening into that we just got
[42:58] through them but he said we saw the the
[43:00] dead raised he said we saw the blind
[43:02] receive their sight and the cripples
[43:03] walk
[43:04] he said we saw all of that and he said
[43:07] now he said we're in the time after the
[43:10] revival and we're discussing what
[43:14] Jesus's works did in the campaign but
[43:20] Ram said that the disciples saw Jesus do
[43:23] things that no other man could do 'but
[43:24] he was a god man he said John the
[43:27] Baptist had already told them that the
[43:29] Messiah was right among them he said
[43:31] there's the Lamb of God who takes away
[43:33] the sin of the world so they had all
[43:36] these things in their minds they're
[43:37] testifying
[43:38] Oh John the Baptist the Baptizer noticin
[43:41] this is the Messiah and look what he saw
[43:44] we saw this healing take place and we
[43:46] saw that he didn't take place oh my he
[43:50] said if the disciples were discussing
[43:52] about the Messiah because many of the
[43:54] Jews believe but many of them didn't
[43:55] believe and church let me say like this
[44:00] some people can believe so far but then
[44:03] there's others that can believe even
[44:04] farther like I had it at my physical
[44:07] yesterday of my doctor I got healthy
[44:09] blood so I thank the Lord for that I got
[44:12] all healthy Mark said he said he said
[44:14] your blood pressure so low he said
[44:15] there's something wrong with you
[44:17] he said you exercise exercise three
[44:20] hours a week and he said oh I'm sorry
[44:22] I'm tired
[44:23] I said I breathe three times a week
[44:24] elite songs four times a week and he
[44:27] said he thought like he said I'm so low
[44:30] because I didn't know exercise and I
[44:33] said it's just the opposite I was
[44:35] getting sports for so long a noun no now
[44:37] I've been so busy with teaching and
[44:38] church and everything
[44:39] that's my blood pressure so low my hands
[44:44] are constantly cold and it's nothing I'm
[44:46] not doing anything instead I'm trying to
[44:48] doing too much I told him he said that's
[44:49] what he said I understand these tenets
[44:51] he said I understand I said forgive me
[44:53] he said he do that but you know I'm
[44:55] talking to it and he looked at my height
[44:58] and I just know what she got on there I
[45:00] said I'm starting to preach on the book
[45:01] of Revelation the church age and he said
[45:03] oh he said we could we could take the
[45:05] whole afternoon and talk about the book
[45:07] of Revelation you said that I can't do
[45:08] it and he explained to me what it is
[45:11] passively his pastor believed the book
[45:13] of Revelation is already fulfilled art
[45:15] in the past he said what's your opinion
[45:17] he said I realized that could be heresy
[45:19] which I think it might be but but I
[45:22] don't know what the man I don't know
[45:23] where he stands with God's I'm not going
[45:25] to call him Harris that might be all he
[45:26] knows Church maybe he can just believe
[45:29] maybe brother Graham said he can just
[45:30] cut out salvation with the sort of thing
[45:31] maybe that's all he can cut out so I'm
[45:34] not gonna be Christianize somebody if
[45:36] that's all they could do so he said it
[45:39] might be heresy mr. Smith what do you
[45:41] think I said well I respect him he's the
[45:44] man he's got a right to believe whatever
[45:45] he wants
[45:46] I said maybe that's all he knows he says
[45:48] whoa but I said God says the Prophet I
[45:53] said name William Branham and he gave us
[45:55] thus saith the Lord on numerous chapters
[45:58] the book of Revelation so we've got the
[46:00] state the Lord on it and we believe it's
[46:01] yet to be fulfilled I said we know who
[46:04] the Beast is we don't be the mother
[46:05] heart of this we got a YouTube channel I
[46:08] got the first three chapters done and he
[46:10] said oh that's interesting he said I've
[46:11] already knows who your beast is yeah I
[46:12] don't you beast it and then he coming
[46:14] right off even on substantial and we
[46:17] never got back to that but I can say on
[46:19] that day that I told my doctor then
[46:21] we've got enough saith the Lord
[46:23] in the book of Revelation which I love a
[46:25] piece of wonderful doctor and he said he
[46:28] says of interesting words he said Jesse
[46:30] he said I have patients that are sinners
[46:34] and believers and he said the believers
[46:36] are so much more happy happy and
[46:38] healthier than the unbelievers I just
[46:42] said they're shocked I'm gonna jump back
[46:43] I've heard about a man say that before
[46:45] but I never heard a doctor tell it to me
[46:47] straight to my face he said oh yeah he
[46:51] said of it
[46:51] he said because they
[46:53] he said they have a outlet they can cast
[46:55] their cares upon the Lord and he said
[46:57] the stress that this the unbelievers
[46:59] have it gets to them and it creates all
[47:00] these problems in the lives of here's a
[47:02] medical doctor in Green Ohio one of the
[47:05] most affluent the deliver counter I say
[47:08] townships in this area and he sees all
[47:11] these rich people and the ones that are
[47:13] believers are healthy are the ones that
[47:15] are sinners harm they worship and your
[47:17] faith then the Bible says don't forget
[47:19] all God's benefits
[47:20] it'll be health to your body Hey read
[47:25] your Bible worship God it'll cast all
[47:27] the cares all the stress all those
[47:28] demons it'll pass the ball on the Lord
[47:31] take care of them they been well I just
[47:34] got that talk you don't from from from
[47:37] that sermon I'll go back said somebody
[47:39] that some did it and the doctor looked
[47:42] at me and he said you see you know what
[47:45] I find I lost my train of thought there
[47:48] he was telling me some of the other
[47:50] things about doctors and the benefits of
[47:55] being a Christian now maybe I'll get to
[47:56] it again maybe I don't remember it now
[47:58] kind of slipped my mind there somebody
[48:00] some didn't it oh yeah you said he said
[48:03] I come in here many times and people
[48:07] people will say Jesse
[48:10] they'll say doctor you know listen
[48:13] doctor you don't have to tell me what's
[48:14] wrong with me I just got faith to be
[48:16] healed and he's not I respect that he
[48:18] said but sometimes he looked at him and
[48:20] he said that's true but he said maybe
[48:22] God sent you to me so I could be a
[48:25] minister to you and the Spirit of God to
[48:27] flow through me to help you and I
[48:30] thought that's so true what a great now
[48:32] sin is sometimes God heals through
[48:34] doctors sometimes God just wants you to
[48:36] have faith to be healed sometimes he
[48:38] just want you to have a bulldog fate
[48:40] could best the word but other times he
[48:42] want you to humble yourself sometimes it
[48:43] goes to the doctor right he told me that
[48:47] and he said there's so many people he
[48:51] said that make himself sick by their own
[48:55] confession they let themselves they sick
[48:58] by what they say what they do and I was
[49:00] so do so a blown away by that that even
[49:03] a doctor here and he and he said that
[49:06] people he said
[49:06] don't people know though these
[49:08] Christians dogs and he said with all the
[49:10] fishes that walk in here they're always
[49:12] talking about how God is spanking them
[49:15] spanking them spanking them and he said
[49:17] don't they know that he's grace and he
[49:22] thought though they know that God is
[49:23] rich in grace and this is what I thought
[49:28] I thought well good that's true that's
[49:30] very true but I thought God might be
[49:33] spanking them if they know better but
[49:36] some people might not know but if that's
[49:38] the case God's not spanking them and
[49:39] they're probably beating themselves up
[49:41] so you got to bring a balance of that
[49:43] situation sometimes we beat ourselves up
[49:45] when we shouldn't but sometimes we do
[49:47] need a spanking how many understand that
[49:48] so that we go against God's Word when we
[49:51] should not and you God have to give us a
[49:53] little spank but even he was saying
[49:55] don't people know no Christians know
[49:58] that they can't be good enough that's
[50:00] why God had to send his son to die for
[50:02] us and here's a doctor preaching that a
[50:04] preacher
[50:04] I said glory doctor I said like that I
[50:08] think that's good that's right I
[50:09] preached a few weeks ago with the
[50:10] judgment of my fate if we can do it on
[50:13] our own that it's nothing but the blood
[50:15] and our good power our good conduct but
[50:17] the song says it's nothing but the blood
[50:19] of Jesus we must use to the Spirit of
[50:22] God we must let the Spirit of God do
[50:24] what we can do so I just take that
[50:28] thought you know the disciples we're
[50:29] talking about this and that's somebody
[50:32] even some did it we should believe
[50:33] medical doctors believe I know many
[50:36] designers that believe we should believe
[50:39] but we should believe more because
[50:41] been revealed to us I put that
[50:44] fade out there on my hook the State
[50:47] Board of proper I got a YouTube channel
[50:49] we did final readiness but I put it out
[50:52] there by God's grace maybe next time
[50:54] last year I got the doctor I lay hands
[50:57] on you and pray for you and he said yes
[51:00] he goes like this yes sir yes sir Lacy's
[51:04] ed and so I prayed for my say may the
[51:06] Holy Spirit flow through you to minister
[51:09] and heal people and that was guess when
[51:11] I said that I said doctor I said I
[51:13] believe God has a special place in
[51:15] heaven for doctors that love to help
[51:18] other greater said that but if said God
[51:22] has a special place in heaven for
[51:23] doctors that will cross rivers in the
[51:25] middle of night midnight and you go help
[51:27] a poor person who's who's sick and don't
[51:30] take any money for it and God has a
[51:32] special place in heaven for doctors that
[51:34] are you know about mothers Amen
[51:36] grandmothers how about fathers
[51:38] how about husbands how about wives how
[51:40] about children yes God has a special
[51:42] place in heaven for all those brother
[51:45] peaceful men living for eternal life not
[51:48] living for ourselves but living for
[51:50] others absolutely
[51:52] so I think those are the main things I
[51:54] remember from that meeting that's what
[51:56] encouraged you I got to testify the
[51:57] doctor the doctor gets to testify to me
[51:59] we had a testimony meeting kinda like
[52:01] this context here the disciples are
[52:04] sitting there testified there's Jesus
[52:06] sleepy because he knows he's got a
[52:08] demon-possessed man he's got a meeting a
[52:09] few months a few hours you'd say give
[52:12] him suppress let the master rest give
[52:14] him surest he's got a demon power he's
[52:16] got a battle and so the disciples are
[52:18] the top of the boat but Ram said
[52:19] testifying we saw Jesus do this we saw
[52:22] Jesus do that look at what he did and he
[52:25] said this he said he said st. John stood
[52:28] up that young Saint John stood up and he
[52:31] said brothers he said think of it right
[52:34] now the very creator heaven his earth is
[52:39] right with us at the ship right now
[52:42] because John later wrote that in the
[52:44] beginning was the word the Word was with
[52:46] God and the Word was God he said think
[52:50] of it the man who gave up life and his
[52:53] sight is with us right now
[52:55] the man who healed to hear the paralyzed
[52:57] man he's with us right now
[52:59] the man who healed the woman the buddish
[53:02] you after 12 years he's with us right
[53:04] now I said think of it brothers the
[53:06] Messiah the one that Isaiah prophesied
[53:08] of and Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Moses
[53:12] all these prophecies think of it the
[53:14] berrywood they all wrote about is with
[53:16] us right now hey watch my voice here
[53:21] well dad said what a security it must
[53:26] have been
[53:27] the creator himself sailing with them
[53:30] through the waters and program said
[53:33] Christ is the same today he sails with
[53:36] us through every waters that we go
[53:38] through it had to start off peaceful
[53:40] because the Bible said the storm came
[53:42] down right so when they started sailing
[53:45] the storm was up it wasn't that it was
[53:48] up and maybe they couldn't see it maybe
[53:50] they weren't aware of it maybe they just
[53:51] saw it
[53:52] I revived with Jesus's on evening
[53:54] ministry maybe they didn't notice it
[53:56] well as they sail through the cold
[53:58] waters Jesus was with them Jesus with
[54:02] you in the calm waters Jesus with you
[54:04] the great revival meeting she stood with
[54:06] it at the storming times thank god he's
[54:08] with no say that he said no I'm with you
[54:10] even to the end of the age a man what a
[54:14] consolation Amen what I said what is
[54:16] security
[54:16] John could say look the same boy that
[54:19] did all those things and he and all
[54:21] these people he's with us now amen and
[54:25] romancin maybe we are the same as they
[54:27] were right now maybe we're just feasting
[54:30] on what we've seen done we're resting
[54:34] between revivals waiting on the coming
[54:37] of the Lord
[54:39] no man said we sail long and were
[54:42] testifying talking about our memories
[54:45] about what Jesus has done maybe worth
[54:48] that praise the Lord now let me say this
[54:51] from 2010 to 2013 I was in a great
[54:55] campaign I was doing so many miracles I
[54:58] wrote it down it was some of the most
[55:00] highly spiritual supernatural times of
[55:03] my life there is such an amazing time
[55:05] this person after person being healed
[55:07] and God doing different things and
[55:08] overseas you know Neville's Casta Naaman
[55:10] and kidney stones healing and our pride
[55:13] is healed and never they just it was
[55:15] just such I felt like it was kinda like
[55:18] that the campaign's like Jesus had but
[55:20] it's not closer but he said maybe were
[55:25] like that maybe we might not be like
[55:27] we're in the excitement of a revival how
[55:31] many could raise your hand on me honest
[55:32] with me and say you feel like you're in
[55:35] the excitement of a major revival right
[55:38] now honestly and I my teacher it's okay
[55:41] I don't see any hands go up so that's
[55:44] what geez that's what I was saying about
[55:45] the disciples they were not in the midst
[55:48] of the revival but they'd been a barber
[55:49] Bible
[55:50] how many been a part of revival before
[55:51] oh yeah absolutely
[55:53] when I first came in and like I said
[55:55] from 2010-2013
[55:57] 14 there her brother amen came in 2014 I
[55:59] better include that I was revival for me
[56:01] too to see God do that after I have got
[56:04] prayed for but I said that's what it's
[56:07] kind of like they're not in the midst of
[56:09] the big hot revival but they're in this
[56:12] stage of just testifying about what he's
[56:14] done what was Jesus with them still
[56:18] Church Jesus still with me today believe
[56:22] that you have to believe that because he
[56:24] promised he would be so maybe you and I
[56:28] tonight people are just feasting on what
[56:30] we thought God has done looking forward
[56:32] to knowing what he will do but let's not
[56:35] miss and see what he's doing right now
[56:37] that's right brother Branham said this
[56:41] that he said that's the troubles arose
[56:43] what in this time where they were in the
[56:46] hot revivals the big revival that could
[56:49] happen he said the troubles of others
[56:52] he said troubles arose when they were
[56:55] only talking about him not one of the
[56:57] midst of the revival so what can you
[57:01] expect right now troubles to rise if
[57:03] this isn't your hot revival timing
[57:06] mountaintop time then it's time for
[57:09] trials now I want you to go in your
[57:12] Bible I'm gonna go take the Genesis 6
[57:15] just for a moment brother that brings
[57:17] out the scripture I want to make sure we
[57:18] read it read out could proudly say yes I
[57:22] know that but yeah Genesis 6 we're not
[57:33] going to read all of it but verses 1 to
[57:35] 7 reckon read on but we're just to read
[57:37] verse 4 how many know this is a prophecy
[57:40] of what the end times would be like
[57:42] because there's Luke 17 what Jesus said
[57:45] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[57:49] be the days to come in O son of man look
[57:51] in verse 4
[57:53] there were giants in the earth in those
[57:58] days I'll stop right here
[58:00] giants in the earth see brother Jesse
[58:03] what are you talking about why do you go
[58:04] back to Genesis when you're preaching on
[58:06] Jesus in the ship because brother Adam
[58:09] said this troubles arose when they were
[58:11] talking about
[58:12] he said we have so much intellectual
[58:16] messages today he said people can preach
[58:20] such a scriptural sermon you can't lay a
[58:21] finger on where it's wrong he said but
[58:23] where is God where is the manifestation
[58:26] of God and then we're going to said see
[58:28] as it was the days of Noah he said they
[58:31] were giants in the earth in those days
[58:33] where the bram said today we've got
[58:35] intellectual Giants a me man see that
[58:39] brother Williams typing the storms to
[58:42] intellectual Giants these are giant
[58:44] waves everything with me giant waves
[58:47] they with me you can almost the giant
[58:51] waves programs that represent
[58:53] intellectual Giants that are too smart
[58:56] for their own good
[58:56] it's all intellectual there's no
[58:59] supernatural like so glad when our
[59:02] sister Naomi spoke in tongues in
[59:03] February I'm that resistant where he got
[59:05] healing and November supernaturally Oh
[59:09] different ones been afraid for him so
[59:11] glad for that we appreciate that that's
[59:14] the Holy Ghost praise God
[59:16] moving amongst us to show us that
[59:19] there's a supernatural power if we just
[59:21] yield you a name a man say when you're
[59:25] not in the revival the mountaintop
[59:26] he said then this this time of this time
[59:30] of sword comes on and the giant waves
[59:34] represent intellectual Giants but
[59:37] innocent men can know Hebrew they can
[59:39] speak and read Hebrew but where is the
[59:41] revival the Prophet said it takes
[59:43] simplicity to bring the power of God
[59:45] amen hallelujah so see those giants in
[59:51] the earth in the days of Noah are a type
[59:53] of the days of Noah today with
[59:55] intellectual Giants we've got to have
[59:57] more than just preaching we've got to
[59:59] have power and how much power come way
[1:00:01] to all fierce taps out then you're
[1:00:03] filled with love
[1:00:04] and then when you're filled with love it
[1:00:05] outbreaks fainting then and then faith
[1:00:08] moves to the will of God now I go to 2nd
[1:00:12] Timothy 3 let's just back this up again
[1:00:14] as we have in the mouth of two or three
[1:00:16] scriptures everyone be established 2nd
[1:00:24] Timothy 3 now you know this verse 1 this
[1:00:31] is know also that the last days perilous
[1:00:33] times shall come
[1:00:34] you know what it is let's go down to
[1:00:36] verse 4 traitors heady highminded lovers
[1:00:37] of pleasure more than lovers of God now
[1:00:41] the word high byte it means this it
[1:00:44] means to cover a smoke that is to
[1:00:47] inflate with self conceit high-minded
[1:00:51] being lifted up with pride he says to be
[1:00:54] proud says so brother Adam said Wendover
[1:00:58] Bibles not on and we get in the midst of
[1:01:00] a storm intellectual Giants come against
[1:01:04] us right and that's what the scripture
[1:01:07] said this day they be high-minded they
[1:01:10] be so smart they be so full of pride but
[1:01:13] yet they love the things of the world
[1:01:14] more than things of God okay that's the
[1:01:17] condition that word can everybody see
[1:01:19] that today that's what I'm typing it
[1:01:21] today I brother have said America needs
[1:01:22] more missionaries in every country of
[1:01:24] the world because we're so
[1:01:25] intellectually smart right but it's
[1:01:28] wrong it's not kind of a good smart now
[1:01:30] they're figuring out brother said they
[1:01:32] think they're smarter than God when it
[1:01:34] comes to these things you or not we need
[1:01:36] more of God we must be filled with God
[1:01:38] if we're doing anything we must have the
[1:01:40] wholeness of God in our hearts and in
[1:01:42] our souls the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:45] but see this was promised on just like
[1:01:48] the days of Noah Giants the days today
[1:01:50] were just like that but their
[1:01:52] intellectual Giants and programs that
[1:01:54] were waiting to get to the next revival
[1:01:56] but there's intellectual Giants you've
[1:01:57] got to overcome how many will be with me
[1:02:00] to overcome the intellectual Giants in
[1:02:02] this day
[1:02:02] I'm gonna stay with us in the they
[1:02:04] then we're gonna stay with us in the
[1:02:06] African ship you're gonna jump ship and
[1:02:08] try to make it on your own you better
[1:02:11] stay with us the church you better stay
[1:02:13] with the flock because there's wolves
[1:02:15] out there there's ladies out there if
[1:02:17] you don't stay on the ship like Paul
[1:02:19] said stay in the ship and we won't lose
[1:02:21] one line then man stay with the Bride of
[1:02:23] Christ stay with those people and there
[1:02:25] will be one soul off Satan like Joshua
[1:02:30] told Rahab with a spiteful RAM whoever
[1:02:32] you get the house they're gonna be saved
[1:02:34] amen whoever you get in this house
[1:02:36] they're gonna be saved and they can't
[1:02:38] believe they met be done to us according
[1:02:41] to our faith it's exactly right
[1:02:43] let's not be high-minded heady
[1:02:45] highminded and forget the power of God
[1:02:47] that God has powers of simplicity just
[1:02:50] believing his word man just believing
[1:02:52] his word now the next thought is this
[1:03:01] how many want to see our revival in our
[1:03:04] church I create more constantly I hope
[1:03:06] you do too
[1:03:08] remember remind what is it always salsa
[1:03:10] okay
[1:03:11] there's many quotes I just start winning
[1:03:12] this sermon the ramps that they're
[1:03:14] having a great revival and new souls
[1:03:15] getting saved so he connects revival
[1:03:17] with new souls although other places
[1:03:20] these separate Bible is just reviving
[1:03:23] what we already got that's sure dude but
[1:03:26] how many want to see revival where
[1:03:28] people are reminded that means they come
[1:03:29] back to life to revive needs to come
[1:03:33] back to life Friday so sometimes people
[1:03:35] walk into Church and they don't seem
[1:03:37] spiritual I've well they revive they're
[1:03:39] going to walk into Church and they're
[1:03:40] gonna seem spiritually live the words
[1:03:42] gonna mean something to them because
[1:03:44] that is the word you cannot separate the
[1:03:46] word from God because God is the word
[1:03:49] amen it's exactly right but answer this
[1:03:52] they said many women come back to God
[1:03:54] come back to the place I don't mean come
[1:03:57] back to church necessarily I mean come
[1:03:58] back to God that every home started
[1:04:01] their Bible that's right turn out the
[1:04:04] beer can throw away the card party
[1:04:05] hallelujah what we need today is the old
[1:04:07] fashioned god-sent revival clean up the
[1:04:10] hole clean up the heart get these ready
[1:04:12] start a revival in your home and it'll
[1:04:15] begin at the church preacher don't bring
[1:04:18] the revival in his briefcase God says it
[1:04:21] from heaven to individual yeah so we
[1:04:26] could just be more faithful bringing our
[1:04:27] homes got a sentence or not intersted
[1:04:30] beside this if people don't partake of
[1:04:33] it that's up to them but we can partake
[1:04:36] of it hey whoever comes to who's ever
[1:04:38] prayed their hosts they're the ones that
[1:04:40] brings the revival and it has to start
[1:04:43] at the home
[1:04:44] it doesn't start here at church it
[1:04:46] actually starts in their home god help
[1:04:48] our homes to be on fire to Netaji's got
[1:04:50] I got cold there's been many times I've
[1:04:52] prayed God please visit our home with
[1:04:54] angels then Lydia and a patient got
[1:04:56] baptized about a year ago I was praying
[1:04:58] I was remembered tell my wife that we
[1:05:00] said they were going to get saved pretty
[1:05:01] soon and I was praying and preaching
[1:05:03] God let angels visit our home amen and
[1:05:06] the a box of the Angels rejoiced when
[1:05:09] one sinner repents how they did yeah
[1:05:11] yes so see we might be in the middle we
[1:05:15] might be in the story part it doesn't
[1:05:17] make none of us had our hand up for this
[1:05:18] is I feel like I'm on the mountaintop
[1:05:20] revival I don't
[1:05:20] I'm totally worn out physically right
[1:05:22] I'm just struggling just to stay out
[1:05:24] here by God's grace but you see we
[1:05:28] understand it we're here we should be
[1:05:30] testifying about what he's done and we
[1:05:32] should expect there's probably going to
[1:05:34] come an intellectual storm there's
[1:05:36] probably gonna come some giant against
[1:05:38] us but if we can focus on God in our
[1:05:41] home that the church experience gets
[1:05:43] even more sincere but we got to do it at
[1:05:46] home we got to focus on God at home
[1:05:49] well the way I've said then the storm
[1:05:51] came down the Bible said that the storm
[1:05:53] came down cuz Satan is the Prince and
[1:05:56] power of the air in fact of the ramps up
[1:06:00] later he said he said Satan got in the
[1:06:02] wind he said then Satan got in the
[1:06:05] whirlwind he said Satan got in the storm
[1:06:07] and brought the storm down brother and
[1:06:11] said now they're in the midst of the
[1:06:13] storm
[1:06:14] he said because of the storm
[1:06:16] he said all hosts were gone remember the
[1:06:19] Bible said they're in jeopardy we gonna
[1:06:22] live or die are we gonna live what's
[1:06:24] gonna happen but the RAM said the sails
[1:06:26] were blown down and the boat was filling
[1:06:29] up with water the Bible said your life
[1:06:32] might seem like it's filling up and you
[1:06:34] don't have much to live for
[1:06:35] right that's what the program called the
[1:06:37] church age book we have more
[1:06:39] conveniences more machines more money
[1:06:41] more blessings now than ever and people
[1:06:42] are less happy than ever how can America
[1:06:47] lead the world in suicide when we've got
[1:06:48] more money than anybody else rich kids
[1:06:52] committing suicide they've got cars
[1:06:53] dollars it shows it's not about money
[1:06:56] it's about faith amen that's what makes
[1:06:59] a person happy it's not about money it's
[1:07:01] not about character the world of riches
[1:07:03] it's about the love of Christ amen those
[1:07:06] things never satisfied how can our
[1:07:10] country lead the world in suicide how is
[1:07:12] that possible
[1:07:13] we have everything we could ever want it
[1:07:17] shows it's a lack of love it's a lack of
[1:07:19] God it's not a matter of lack for
[1:07:21] spiritual thing and our lives what will
[1:07:23] feel better when we realize is that
[1:07:24] we're lacking
[1:07:25] my tear
[1:07:26] we're lacking spiritual kings we're
[1:07:29] lacking a real sincere prayer with the
[1:07:31] Lord that's what we need the most
[1:07:33] filling up sometimes like our lives are
[1:07:35] filling up with multiple things don't we
[1:07:37] think the pressures and the cares and
[1:07:39] sicknesses and all the stress all kinds
[1:07:41] of thing our lives are filling up with
[1:07:43] in this boats filling up fast I've never
[1:07:45] prayed that recently Jesus my boats
[1:07:47] filled up fast things are getting pretty
[1:07:50] bad pretty quick right things are
[1:07:52] getting worse really fast that's what
[1:07:55] the cycles were going through my life
[1:07:57] feel really hard really fast brother
[1:08:02] Epson isn't it strange that the same man
[1:08:04] who just seems Americans a few hours ago
[1:08:07] forgot all about them he said they
[1:08:10] forgot that God raised the dead they
[1:08:13] forgot the guy who crated Brendon fish
[1:08:14] with me Church is that strange that it
[1:08:19] happened to them isn't it strange that
[1:08:22] we could see some good thing happen and
[1:08:24] a few weeks later we're just all
[1:08:25] discouraged we might rejoice and say
[1:08:28] look what God did by eye but God did a
[1:08:30] few years ago and then little water
[1:08:31] comes into our boat or say a lot of
[1:08:33] water comes into our boat and we forget
[1:08:34] how great God is
[1:08:36] it's a shame but maybe that's a change
[1:08:38] of the cycles and forgotten already
[1:08:40] it's a shame when we forget about how
[1:08:43] much God has done for us but thank God
[1:08:46] Jesus said love with me always Jesus is
[1:08:49] always with us
[1:08:50] in the boat the Prophet said the
[1:08:53] disciples had troubled and this was
[1:08:56] behind their skill to remedy but RAM
[1:09:00] said they got out the oars and they
[1:09:01] tried to push out all the water they
[1:09:03] tried to raise the sails again and raise
[1:09:05] the masts and all these things and all I
[1:09:08] hear blown down and they could do
[1:09:10] nothing their own skill and own ability
[1:09:12] could do nothing they needed help from
[1:09:14] some source
[1:09:15] amen my madam says if you're sick and
[1:09:20] the skill of the doctor cannot help our
[1:09:22] situation he said we must remember who's
[1:09:25] with us in the ship the word is with us
[1:09:27] God is the word and the word is sharper
[1:09:30] than any two-edged short on NVIDIA
[1:09:32] that's exactly right
[1:09:37] we have said
[1:09:39] no you know that the Holy Ghost is with
[1:09:41] us he said Lord remind us that you're
[1:09:43] still with you with us here program said
[1:09:46] we need you to stabilize us I don't feel
[1:09:49] like you need stabilized
[1:09:50] you're tossed this way cost that way
[1:09:53] head up down sometimes you're
[1:09:55] discouraged sometimes you're encouraged
[1:09:56] you're tossed all over the place
[1:09:58] everybody I said we need Christ is
[1:10:00] stabilized
[1:10:01] hey men be like we're on solid ground
[1:10:04] the times I've met in boats but like
[1:10:07] they were gonna see I didn't feel very
[1:10:08] stable
[1:10:09] I remember just a guy on there's just a
[1:10:11] little bit of rain storm and we're just
[1:10:12] in this little boat that had a little
[1:10:15] motor in the back and gas is leaking and
[1:10:17] all over the boat that was awful I was
[1:10:19] where he's older and we and I came when
[1:10:22] we've started driving into these huge
[1:10:24] waves that to me were there were huge
[1:10:25] they were probably like ten eight maybe
[1:10:28] max maybe max oh you know I'm better
[1:10:31] than the boat that's the most feminist
[1:10:32] by nine feet or eight feet whatever the
[1:10:34] waves look big to me they look like 30
[1:10:36] feet tall but I'm holding over the boat
[1:10:40] like this I'm looking around two
[1:10:41] brothers like oh we're gonna sink we're
[1:10:42] gonna die I'm like Jesus help me and the
[1:10:45] guy just backed your home oh my god be
[1:10:49] shaking myself because I never been
[1:10:53] through that kind of storm before and I
[1:10:56] saw leaks in the boat I saw gasoline at
[1:10:59] the bottom of the boat it was an awful
[1:11:00] situation but I had no skill to remedy
[1:11:04] that situation but the man who been
[1:11:06] through that before he knew all about
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:09] but jesus said it wasn't that way the
[1:11:11] disciples they tried everything they
[1:11:13] tried scooping out the water nothing was
[1:11:19] working
[1:11:20] they had no ability to help their
[1:11:22] situation never felt like that where you
[1:11:24] have no ability to make things get
[1:11:25] better
[1:11:26] I've done all I can do I'm afraid all I
[1:11:28] can do
[1:11:29] I've talked to all the people I can talk
[1:11:31] to I feel like there's nothing I can do
[1:11:33] and she's just saying praise the Lord
[1:11:35] he said wake me up
[1:11:41] the disciples had to get your spot where
[1:11:43] none of their skill could work for them
[1:11:46] brother have set head fear here set in
[1:11:53] when they've done all they could do to
[1:11:55] try to fix the situation they got scared
[1:11:59] but never said that's when we really get
[1:12:02] in trouble this when fear sets in he
[1:12:05] said do not fear what man is doing he
[1:12:09] said fear God for God is able to destroy
[1:12:11] both body and soul in hell
[1:12:14] goodness remember I read you the squad
[1:12:17] room I read - you're done program said
[1:12:20] some time not long ago some man give me
[1:12:22] a threat at a certain Sinan said if you
[1:12:24] don't get preaching divine healing in
[1:12:26] this city we're gonna throw a bomb on
[1:12:28] the platform because I read that to you
[1:12:29] this is in Cleveland Ohio which is
[1:12:32] pretty close you know brother man's
[1:12:35] response was I told that man I said the
[1:12:39] smoke won't dry so I'll be in glory I
[1:12:44] said that's all right he said why do we
[1:12:47] fear my if God be for you who can be
[1:12:50] against you you know it's written the
[1:12:53] Bible it's better than a millstone was
[1:12:55] hanging at your neck and drown the
[1:12:56] depths of the sea then to offend one of
[1:12:58] these that was even meeting man he said
[1:13:01] if you fight God can't fight stand still
[1:13:04] let God fight don't bring it to pass
[1:13:07] don't put every critic everything to
[1:13:09] shame
[1:13:10] he said let's settle down to faith in
[1:13:12] that glory let's let God fight ain't man
[1:13:15] see the disciples they're trying
[1:13:16] everything they can do this is I can
[1:13:18] figure out the numbers I can figure out
[1:13:20] the measurements this is all I can do
[1:13:22] and it's still failing turns out that
[1:13:24] mode we gotta believe God's Word and
[1:13:26] speak faith and let God take over the
[1:13:28] situation amen
[1:13:29] we're gonna fail war make mistakes we
[1:13:31] got that Christ fight the battles for
[1:13:33] put in his hands stop doubting he said
[1:13:36] the worst thing you can do is fear stop
[1:13:38] beer and you just believe
[1:13:39] amen glory the Prophet said when there's
[1:13:46] no remedy
[1:13:49] he said we must remember that now they
[1:13:52] are the sons of God the Bible said now
[1:13:54] you're the sons of God not future we are
[1:13:58] the sons of God when you're born again
[1:14:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:14:01] you are a son you are a daughter of God
[1:14:04] and you have authority the story you
[1:14:08] like this but I've know the story of the
[1:14:10] policeman he said you get a fresh
[1:14:12] policeman out of police academy he said
[1:14:14] you put a hat on him that goes around
[1:14:16] this here's the Hat stupid
[1:14:18] he said he's almost nervous put him out
[1:14:20] on the street and let him blow the
[1:14:21] whistle he said he don't have power to
[1:14:23] stop that 300 horsepower truck but he's
[1:14:25] got authority to stop it he said that's
[1:14:28] how we are we have no power
[1:14:30] we have no still we have no ability but
[1:14:33] we've got authority where we speak the
[1:14:34] name of Jesus amen hallelujah I love
[1:14:39] that story we don't have any probably
[1:14:41] might even feel like more fresh recruits
[1:14:43] many times I'd be like that I'm just a
[1:14:45] young pastor I'm just so young you know
[1:14:47] I'm just young all these things we might
[1:14:49] feel like that but the Bible said that
[1:14:51] we have authority to speak its name
[1:14:53] and the Bible says like a power we speak
[1:14:56] Jesus thing it's like we're running into
[1:14:57] the tower amen
[1:14:58] we are safe we're stable we've got
[1:15:01] victory we're protected in Christ amen
[1:15:03] glory he says this the Prophet said
[1:15:10] Jesus knew this trouble or storm was
[1:15:14] coming I like this this just encourages
[1:15:17] tonight remember they're not the revival
[1:15:20] mode anymore I'll be honest I'm not
[1:15:23] going to revive you mode right now
[1:15:24] wear this dress that was tired he said
[1:15:27] but jesus knew this storm was coming I
[1:15:30] mean oh jesus knew you're strong he may
[1:15:33] go through the storm the Prophet said
[1:15:37] the store was only given as a test of
[1:15:40] your faith the Prophet said maybe this
[1:15:44] revival has led up and now in the midst
[1:15:48] of the storm to see what we'll do about
[1:15:51] it
[1:15:53] the Prophet said it's only a test of
[1:15:56] baby Peter said the test of your faith
[1:15:58] is what more precious than gold
[1:16:01] brother I said these words he said these
[1:16:03] exact words
[1:16:04] oh that refiners fire amen to burn out
[1:16:09] all the doubt and unbelief praise God
[1:16:14] so what would the side was experienced
[1:16:15] and they were spirited experiencing a
[1:16:17] trial of faith why it would burn out all
[1:16:20] their unbelief it would when they saw
[1:16:23] Jesus come on the scene and do what he
[1:16:24] did they would be able to have faith the
[1:16:27] next time praise God
[1:16:29] this trial is burned out their fear
[1:16:31] burned out their unbelief burn out their
[1:16:33] doubt and that's why we go through
[1:16:35] trials many times church is Jesus is
[1:16:37] trying to test our faith to see what
[1:16:39] will do program said they are glorious
[1:16:43] to you the tests are glorious to you the
[1:16:47] swords of the waves are glorious to you
[1:16:50] praise God the intellectual giant to the
[1:16:52] attacks they should be glorious to us
[1:16:54] because they're going to produce the
[1:16:56] right kind of faith in our lives
[1:16:58] but when I said sickness is a test of
[1:17:00] baby to see what you will do about it
[1:17:04] that's exactly right
[1:17:09] the Prophet said the devil came down and
[1:17:12] he got into the wind he got into the
[1:17:15] storm he said it's just like when we let
[1:17:18] down the bars on our standards right let
[1:17:22] down the bars convince the goats get in
[1:17:24] right he said many times the world wins
[1:17:28] and trials happen because we let down on
[1:17:30] our standards with the Lord we don't
[1:17:33] live like we used to MIT programs that's
[1:17:35] like a natural woman this natural
[1:17:37] whirlwind this natural storm on the Sea
[1:17:39] of Galilee is a type of the spiritual
[1:17:42] world winds we go through when we let
[1:17:44] down the bars and we let the enemy come
[1:17:46] in we just obey the Word of God right
[1:17:49] all right almost done here almost done
[1:17:53] okay I got 14 minutes bracelet let's
[1:17:56] read it now he says the Prophet says the
[1:18:00] disciple should not have cared about the
[1:18:03] storm because they knew the creator was
[1:18:06] in the ship did you catch that they
[1:18:08] should not have cared can you think of
[1:18:12] anybody who was extremely calm in the
[1:18:14] midst of the store
[1:18:14] they're just all relaxed no problem you
[1:18:18] know make sure you're really scared when
[1:18:19] it's thunderstorm right and like me but
[1:18:22] you know for the most part I am until I
[1:18:24] get a sudden shock you know like until
[1:18:27] you're surprised
[1:18:28] like I'm not scare right here and see
[1:18:30] the Thunder out there but when I'm just
[1:18:32] driving awesome crap you know it's
[1:18:33] really close to me and I'm a little
[1:18:35] scared but as an adult let's say just as
[1:18:37] a gentle thunderstorm as adults we're
[1:18:41] not scared the midst of those storms
[1:18:42] many times because we've been through
[1:18:44] them before and that's what the Prophet
[1:18:47] said the disciple should have been
[1:18:48] because they saw the power of God the
[1:18:50] revival they should have been totally
[1:18:52] calm during the storm like I'll come out
[1:18:58] in the midst of it and all the rains
[1:19:00] falling down upon you and water's coming
[1:19:02] into the boat and be like Oh grace Lord
[1:19:04] we're doing fine here Christ alone I got
[1:19:07] water to my ankles two minutes later I
[1:19:10] got water to my knees hallelujah but
[1:19:12] John how are you doing sir brother
[1:19:14] Matthew god bless you sir you enjoyed
[1:19:16] the sword you joined the water that's
[1:19:19] what he says real faith can do that how
[1:19:23] many want more real faith in there my my
[1:19:25] hands up first in the midst of a trial I
[1:19:28] would have real faith where these things
[1:19:30] don't even bother me problems fusses
[1:19:34] discouragements unexpected losses of
[1:19:36] life or anything like that we wouldn't
[1:19:38] have such strong faith that these things
[1:19:40] won't even discourage us will be so
[1:19:42] encouraging if only we could do that how
[1:19:47] many believe we can do amen I believe we
[1:19:49] can do it like I said the time you're
[1:19:51] knocking that testimony Simon what Haven
[1:19:52] got hit there on the cheek
[1:19:53] Simon was this call cool as a cucumber
[1:19:55] they say because he'd already seen men
[1:19:58] die in front of them you see men fall
[1:20:00] off scaffoldings 30 40 feet feet and
[1:20:02] seeing God bring him back to life so in
[1:20:06] the midst of that little storms a little
[1:20:07] bit of blood Darren or whatever you know
[1:20:09] six inches in the midst of that it was
[1:20:12] so common and I appreciate that don't
[1:20:14] you appreciate that I appreciate faith
[1:20:16] that in the midst of the storm you can
[1:20:19] feel the calmness of the Holy Spirit the
[1:20:21] program said everything was alright he
[1:20:23] said the Creator is in the boat that
[1:20:25] we're sailing
[1:20:26] amen he said that because the creation
[1:20:30] has to obey the Creator amen
[1:20:34] he said the cycle should realize by we
[1:20:37] have all this water here but the one who
[1:20:39] made the waters of the ship this wind is
[1:20:43] blowing but the one who made the wind is
[1:20:46] in the ship with us glory and rhodium
[1:20:49] said see we might have sickness in our
[1:20:52] body
[1:20:52] but the one who made the body is in our
[1:20:55] body as well and he said our soul oh
[1:20:57] praise God he's in our spirit our human
[1:21:00] minds he knows our minds to believe all
[1:21:02] the Word of God and this body has to
[1:21:06] obey the one that made it hotter than
[1:21:08] Vanessa be a hero believe God's Word I
[1:21:13] like that he said be like David David
[1:21:18] says yay though I walk through the
[1:21:20] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:21:22] fear no evil
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] glory to God I'll fear no evil
[1:21:29] even death I'll fear only remember that
[1:21:33] that father is the happiest time of my
[1:21:35] life
[1:21:35] I'm two hours away from being the
[1:21:37] presence of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:21:38] happiest time of my life
[1:21:42] then program who said that David said
[1:21:44] again then David said in Psalms 139
[1:21:47] he said though I make my bed in hell
[1:21:50] thou art with me
[1:21:52] amen are you see David is understanding
[1:21:56] to where there been a valley of death
[1:21:58] where I'm lower than that in hell in the
[1:22:01] grave no matter where I am God is with
[1:22:04] me I don't want God with them ain't now
[1:22:07] let me close this quote this last quote
[1:22:10] here will be finished by the grace of
[1:22:11] the Lord tonight calling Jesus on the
[1:22:16] scene 1963 never the one I this is you
[1:22:18] going Jesus was three months out of this
[1:22:20] in November but it's the same thought
[1:22:26] the promise that they had seen God
[1:22:28] scripture were vindicated by him at the
[1:22:30] campaign and so have we how many ever
[1:22:33] seen God's Word vindicated you believe
[1:22:35] God's Word and God backed his word I
[1:22:38] you pray God answered your prayer oh how
[1:22:41] loving Jesus is how merciful Jesus
[1:22:44] that's what brother has said about the
[1:22:45] disciples 18 God's were vindicated and
[1:22:48] he was not hard to be calling on the
[1:22:51] scene he was just laying there waiting
[1:22:54] for them to call what a beautiful
[1:22:55] thought it's not hard to call Jesus on
[1:22:59] the scene cos he's right there with you
[1:23:00] it wasn't hard for disciples to wake him
[1:23:03] up because he's laying right there right
[1:23:04] next to them and that's how it is for us
[1:23:07] aren't you glad Jesus's comes out of
[1:23:09] this he's just a prayer away for then he
[1:23:12] was a hard bread baby couple heart I'm
[1:23:14] not sure how deep the ship was I don't
[1:23:16] know if that was levels and the ship or
[1:23:18] not I don't know but he wasn't far away
[1:23:21] about man said it's not hard for us to
[1:23:24] call it Jesus on the scene either he
[1:23:28] said I wonder tonight if he just isn't
[1:23:30] laying right in your heart waiting for
[1:23:34] you to wake him up he said oh he said
[1:23:41] the people today say well now if we
[1:23:44] could only know and be assured that he's
[1:23:46] in the boat with us we hear them say oh
[1:23:48] this is that this is that but man folks
[1:23:51] points at his Bible he said this is that
[1:23:54] he said now this is what he said this is
[1:23:57] his word he his word are the same let
[1:24:00] his word identify it into it that's the
[1:24:03] way he said could prove that he was God
[1:24:06] because the works that God did getting
[1:24:08] him to do was done by him if I do not
[1:24:11] the works of my father then don't
[1:24:13] believe me see that's how it identified
[1:24:16] him and that's how it identifies you
[1:24:18] your works identify who you are if
[1:24:22] you're saying you're a Christian but
[1:24:24] never said the identification of a
[1:24:26] Christian must be worked in you if it's
[1:24:29] not working you there's something wrong
[1:24:30] these signs shall follow them that
[1:24:32] believe not maybe they will they will if
[1:24:36] we could only realize that he is here
[1:24:39] with us the same yesterday today and
[1:24:40] forever
[1:24:41] low up with you always I'll never leave
[1:24:43] you I'll never forsake you I'm with you
[1:24:46] to the end of the world I'll never leave
[1:24:48] you he said I was just looking up
[1:24:51] scriptures I wrote down here concerning
[1:24:52] him and how can we be sure we'll never
[1:24:55] leave us he says because it's written in
[1:24:58] his proven word he's not waiting for you
[1:25:01] to call him on the scene to be proved so

[1:37:13] the I got the witness fat man at the
[1:37:15] jobs day I said the janitor I said can
[1:37:17] we get together I said we need to talk
[1:37:19] about your soul he's like I don't know I
[1:37:20] don't know I said come on man and he's
[1:37:23] just odd to me not despise me at this
[1:37:24] point well that's just because this pray

[1:37:29] Word I love to see people help him say
[1:37:31] it means the world to us let's pray for

[1:37:39] give you everybody here she has two
[1:37:40] witnesses somebody and before we pray
[1:37:42] though I may have to cancel second
[1:37:45] services for the wild Sunday because I'm
[1:37:47] just really tired it only happens a few
[1:37:49] times a year but I get really tired and
[1:37:52] I'm really kind of worn out and so just
[1:37:55] pray for me you can't by God's grace
[1:37:57] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:37:59] the bible does say though like this - my
[1:38:01] conviction we have to gather the more as
[1:38:03] we see that day approaching so if we're
[1:38:06] having like let's say we would just do
[1:38:08] away with second service all together
[1:38:09] well if we don't gather together more
[1:38:11] we're not keeping the scripture anymore
[1:38:12] so that's what I'm saying there's times
[1:38:15] of the season where I get so tired we
[1:38:17] met I may have to cancel for a few
[1:38:18] months or a month or two or so like that
[1:38:20] but we have to remember we need to
[1:38:22] gather more so we got to try to do that
[1:38:25] by God's grace nothing that can be
[1:38:27] special meetings you know that can be
[1:38:29] but we got to get more with the
[1:38:31] believers so that's how I in my life
[1:38:32] that's how I feel the best way I could
[1:38:34] group in that scripture knowledge that
[1:38:35] have to suddenly services there from
[1:38:38] time to time you know special mediums
[1:38:39] and things like that but just so you
[1:38:42] know I'm kind of feeling low in health
[1:38:43] I'd only get sick perhaps they've got
[1:38:45] don't expect us to do everything and
[1:38:48] that's a hard one because I know I don't
[1:38:49] want to do everything tomorrow we have

[1:39:14] years what else preaching that yes no I
[1:39:16] don't wanna do that

[1:39:18] wisdom it's a busy time and season in my
[1:39:21] life I'm happy court but I just want to

[1:40:50] for you too
[1:40:51] how many Father we're living by faith in
[1:40:54] Jesus above trusting and confiding in
[1:40:58] your great love thank you that you're in
[1:41:00] our ship Lord God you were in this ship
[1:41:03] Lord God tonight thank you that you're
[1:41:05] right here in this church thank you that
[1:41:06] you're right here in our souls you're in
[1:41:08] our ship Lord God like Paul said no man
[1:41:13] will lose his life
[1:41:14] if he just remains in this help us
[1:41:17] Lord God to stay in the phone to stay in
[1:41:19] the church to stay faithful to you more
[1:41:20] with all our hearts and souls Lord God
[1:41:23] Lord I pray you'd open up a Bible study
[1:41:25] with my friend Ken Lord God he's dunking
[1:41:28] me now an orca father picked his heart I
[1:41:31] asked North God we prayed when he was in
[1:41:34] a three-week-long coma and you brought
[1:41:37] him out of the coma back to work
[1:41:39] father no let me get a chance to talk
[1:41:41] about a soul again dear God please
[1:41:44] change his heart Lord Jesus I'll
[1:41:46] remember this prayer will God bless our
[1:41:49] Bible study on Saturday and company that
[1:41:51] this fourth grader and freshman Lord God
[1:41:53] or green freshmen we want to be baptized
[1:41:56] buried in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ I've asked you before Lord for a
[1:42:00] family from Copley to come into the
[1:42:02] message I see again more than knew your
[1:42:04] will I really think that'd be a great
[1:42:06] vindication to me of how I supposed to
[1:42:09] be a teacher company and past at the
[1:42:11] same time the Lord even if this family
[1:42:14] doesn't want to spray their hearts would
[1:42:15] open up to justification it's such a
[1:42:17] great work you're probably said if
[1:42:19] Luthor's can live justification they'd
[1:42:21] be such a credit to the kingdom of God
[1:42:25] help this family Lord could be a credit
[1:42:27] to the kingdom of God so they have all
[1:42:30] that they know in justification Lord and
[1:42:31] I just pray that one of these families
[1:42:33] come into the message you come into our
[1:42:35] church Lord God I prayed that before on
[1:42:38] this altar I cried on this altar praying
[1:42:40] that and I know you're here my prayer
[1:42:41] I'm gonna keep believing it I'm gonna
[1:42:44] keep feeding for souls Lord father's
[1:42:45] time to work we can only work while
[1:42:48] we're alive on this earth once we pass
[1:42:50] away there'll be no more work we can do
[1:42:52] after that help us to work and labor
[1:42:54] while we're here probably but I see
[1:42:57] Satan's give them an opportunity witness
[1:42:59] to some Souls invite them to church
[1:43:00] maybe family members or God use those
[1:43:03] that are here tonight less those hungry
[1:43:04] hearts that's those on your hearts in
[1:43:06] our livestream enlarge Jesus we're so
[1:43:09] privileged that you're in our or
[1:43:10] god help us to exercise our faith wake
[1:43:13] you up so we can be calm in the midst of
[1:43:16] our storm tonight whatever we're going
[1:43:19] through or Jesus we thank you for it
