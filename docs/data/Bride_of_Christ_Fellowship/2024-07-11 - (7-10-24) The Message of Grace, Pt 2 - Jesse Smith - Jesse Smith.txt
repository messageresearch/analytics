========================================

like to greet the live streamers God bless you I apologize you know Sunday I was out of town and we didn't get the live stream on there what I should have done I should have reminded one of the brothers to just record it on the audio and then I could have posted it later but I forgot so apologize to the Saints there brother Simon did a wonderful job preaching for us he preached on out of the abundance of the heart the morning service and the evening I don't remember oh from the dust of the Stars that's right he told me he gave you a little summary of it how many enjoyed the services by God's grace amen everybody uh everybody looked at your heart over the weekend praise God and make sure all good things in our hearts Hallelujah I love that so Zechariah 4:7 we'll just read this and then we'll have you be seated here uh in the presence of the Lord hallelujah how many know he's faithful tonight faithful how he proves he's with us he gives us Grace he gives us Zechariah 4:7 let's read that on three 1 2 3 who are th oh great Mountain before zable thou shal become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace may God add his Blessing to you may be seated I'll be able to switch over uh I got just a few just a make sure that works again some of that's review but I just want to it comes out in brother br's sermon uh hopefully You' listen to the message of Grace if you haven't I encourage you to do that you know you can go on the podcast and you can find people that post poed all the sermons of brother brandom and so it's very convenient then there's no commercials like on YouTube right unless you pay to get the commercials off uh it's a great place to go to get sermons if you want there's a certain podcast just look up William Brandon sermons there's numerous podcasts that they just have the the sermons from Brother brand without any commercials so that's that could be a real help to you by God's grace so try not to read ahead of me I know it's hard you know I don't I don't expect you to be be perfect you know but now you kind of see what I preach off of when I don't use a PowerPoint this is kind of what I preach off of I do like a a headline what I want to say and then uh I'll give you the quote or something where it's found and uh I'm just got to make sure I touch it I think every 15 minutes so it doesn't uh leave off of the screen Mirrors by God's grace so we left off last week you know last week we left off with brother R's Vision that he had right he had a vision of the three rainbows Austin caught it those three rain rainbows represent father son Holy Ghost Hallelujah remember that by God's grace he caught that I I I caught that right after service I was like wonderful brother uh that was the revelation of Jesus Christ Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and brother remember brother said God gave him that to encourage him because the godhead teaching was so attacked and friends it's still attacked today right the people that have left the message uh they're so bold now to call us Heretics and uh but it's just ridiculous if you just think about it the Trinity Dogma wasn't even formed until about 300 some years after the last I'm sorry no I'm sorry it would have been about 200 some years after the last Apostle died because John died around 100 AD and then of course the Ning counil uh 3:25 but me remember friends the Holy Ghost wasn't considered a third person until 381 ad amen so 281 years after John died they finally decided the Holy Ghost is a is a person well we they would have known the whole time the Holy Ghost is a person it's God amen amen it's not a third person it's the person of God Amen just with us it's God uh dwelling in our souls and ministering to our Spirits it's the same God hallelujah but you know I've been called a heretic cuz I'm not a trinitarian that's fine just like Paul said the way they call heresy that's the way I worship the god of my fathers I'm talking about spiritual fathers brother William my grandpa and my dad didn't serve God in the message amen but it's my spiritual fathers like Paul told a grippa Hallelujah that's how we serve God Amen and we say just with the word of God every time I've challenged them and they have nothing to say they they have no other scripture there's no scripture that says God's three persons and there's two persons friends be encouraged we're standing on the word of God hallelujah always be encouraged that's always take it back to that the water baptism the godhead go back to the scriptures and we will find that our our foundation is a solid rock hallelujah we dig down into the scriptures until we find a solid rock hallelujah and then that's what our life is founded on then when the storms of life come we don't get toss and our house doesn't get torn down our house stands Hallelujah because we're founded on a rock and it's going to become into more play as we approach the end time what I mean is those that leave the message they might get uh they might the the storms of the One World System the storms of the World Council churches might blow over their house and they might get taken into that Pope worship but our houses will stand by the grace of God hallelujah because we know in whom we have believed amen hallelujah we know who's going to keep our souls hallelujah it's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah because we stand on the word of God not bow to the we will not bow to the daughters of the mother hearted either by the grace of God and I just thought you know I just thought some of these things might encourage you I'm about as I've listened I think I'm about 35 minutes into this 2hour uh and so many minute sermon he only preaches really about an hour uh but then there's like uh there's like 30 some minutes of a preliminary and there's like an hour afterwards where he's building up the people for the prayer line it's quite a wonderful message uh but I just thought you might like this here brother BR he was brother tells us here he shows his Humanity brother brandham worried about his loved ones being lost and he had to do things to keep his mind off of worrying sound familiar to anybody right amen he had to go make himself busy so he didn't worry about his siblings being lost or his his uncles and ants here he tells us this right here he says something struck me I've never been able to get away with it to see that hour We're living I know it's so small again I can't zoom in this this app this app doesn't let me zoom in so I'm very sorry I didn't mean to do that uh I want to go now look I want to go somewhere or do something else keep it off my mind I got too many loved one that's unsaved knowing what can I do to get them saved what is there I can do now I love this because brother Adam loved his family so much he wanted to to do something to get them Sav but he realized there's nothing he could do right right unless he was directed by God Amen Hallelujah he says I preach the gospel I can say the same God has done great signs and wonders like he's never done since the world since the days of the Lord Jesus of course he's talking about the discernment right because no other man had that discernment like brother Brandon it was a Messianic gift right sign of the Messiah it was Jesus anointing brother BR to do the works of Jesus Amen because the Gentiles had never had that son of man sign before the Jews and the Samaritans did in John 1 and John 4 I taught that months ago in a second service that's kind of like an elementary teaching he says uh he says and around the world it's went and still the world continually gets worse but then I have to remember that we're living in leoan church age where they'll get worse and it said they would so brother said there's two things he said I got to remember it's Leia it's just going to get worse and second thing in other words I've got to commit this to God I get I got to get my mind I can't allow myself to worry and the church said see that's why I love this brother R was human he worried I shared that quote with the church brother R said remember perfect faith brother Ram said I get I get spells too you know he said I get moody too like you do anybody ever get moody here oh you don't seem like the real brother Jess you seem like a moody brother Jess well that's that's the human nature of course that's going to happen to me praise God yeah because I'm human I've got a battle I got to go through the trials Hallelujah I can't be pushed through a pipe I got to go through with the faith God's given me praise God that's right Hallelujah I got to show some overcoming I got to overcome myself amen hallelujah what brother R saying he said Satan always comes and make me Moody when I'm tired yeah right and remember he whisper he says you have no friends in the world remember he said that you have no friends in the world you have no friends in the world what brother Adam say brother said I look out there in the parking lot at the church and there'll be people d driv from Georgia hope you hear me preach people from uh California people from Ohio that's a long drive I we went to the Tabernacle on our way down there of course we couldn't go inside but we took pictures with it it's quite a drive it's four and almost 5 hours to get down the Tabernacle and brother said he said see sat look at that Georgia Florida Ohio and brother said I'd shove that in the devil's face and say say see people do love me I do have friends amen amen we all get spells we all get moody but we got to put the truth back in the devil's face hallelujah amen we see the humanity of brother Brandon and church we also have this great one all that the father has given me will come to me amen and in no wise will he lose one that's right amen he cannot lose one amen remember I showed you in the future home after it's all said and done he's going to wipe away all the tears from our eyes and then we remember those things no more yes so only the thoughts of God the redeemed thoughts of God God's predestinated children will be in that Heavenly City Amen in that New Jerusalem praise God Amen we'll be able to trust God that he did exactly what was right hallelujah amen amen remember like brother said this is your time to sigh and cry for the Abominations this is the time to pray for your loved ones amen once you're over there you can't do nothing this is the time to pray hallelujah amen amen this is the time to seek God this time to like said this is the time to pray for Divine Healing this is the time to pray uh for salvation for your loved ones for repentance for the Holy Ghost this is the time so we must do that praise God amen amen and now brother says he told us why he chose to preach on Grace he said it was another topic he was attacked on he me and he mentions it later on we'll get to that he said I chose this morning being that that message was so attacked the the godhead message another thing that I'm so uh gotten after about is preaching Grace so I want to preach this morning as I read fourth chapter of Zechariah a p portion of it now he reads 1 through 7 and then he says do you see so I ask the church tonight do you see brother said the message will not come by great mights or Powers but by the spirit of God Amen right amen so The Headstone in other words the Rapture won't happen by some message movement right or some great message Man or some great message church it's going to come by the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God it's going to come by the grace of God by the Holy Spirit and if you're in tune with the Holy Spirit you'll be ready praise God so just stay in tune with the Holy Spirit the church said stay in tuned remember one of the jobs of the spirit is to bring conviction of sin yes what's that verse uh I don't want to risk switching up Jesus said maybe I can just find it Jesus said he would convict the and the word is conviction let me see if I can find it real quick the job of the Holy Spirit if anybody can find it let me know there's three things that he was going to do bring conviction there it is amen hallelujah I love this I love that's why I stay with the same Bible brother William because I know where it is I can see it in my mind but I just got to get to the right page John John 16:7 Hallelujah nevertheless I I tell you the truth it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you Hallelujah Jesus had to leave so then that the Holy Ghost could be in each one of our hearts praise God you ought to be so thankful if the Holy Ghost is in your heart hallelujah amen amen verse eight and when he's come here it is he'll reprove the world of sin now this happened at the altar a number of times this weekend when I was preaching I told these people I said the the reason you feel conviction for your sin that's proof the Holy Ghost is anointing you right now am right because when when we sin and we don't make it right what happens our conscience gets seared and we don't feel that conviction anymore now you and I you know it just as well as I do if we do something wrong our heart's beating really hard because we know we shouldn't do it but if we don't repent of that and next time it's easier and easier to do it and the church said right well R said a critical spirit haunted him that means he knew he' been critical numerous times and he just couldn't get over it right he knew he knew he needed intercession from God Amen I think church if you need if you need help from God God's here to give it to you praise God God doesn't want us to walk in defeat God doesn't want to walk us to walk without feeling the the the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit the correction of the Holy Spirit God wants us to feel it and God wants us to correct or or receive the reproving or the conviction of the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's that simple if you you feel convicted of sin that's the spirit of God hallelujah that's not well that's my conscience well it's the spirit of God anointing your conscious amen hallelujah I told those people those the ones that were confessing their sin I said that's proof the Holy Ghost has not forsaken you you still feel bad about it right you don't got to reprobate mind and God's giving you over to sin and God just let you believe a lie that you'll be damned by it and the church said amen the very fact you feel the weight of sin and you feel sorry for your sin that's proof the Holy Ghost is with you Hallelujah just got to get over that stronghold amen just got to tear down that stronghold by the word of God hallelujah amen amen that's right we seen him come down this weekend by God's grace Hallelujah one I'll just share a few few strongholds were lies some people confess lies that that that they' had for years amongst family members oh another one was stealing money years another one was pornography right another one is uh well that's probably the three right there that I can remember by God's grace yeah I think that's the three but they just those sins would lay there for years and then God has to send a humble little preacher like who am I I'm nobody right I go over there and preach the Waters of Separation remember that from numbers 19 if something died in your house you couldn't go worship until you were sprinkled and made clean right remember that that's a great Revelation yeah in other words you won't even get there I said I said spiritually people can come to church and they don't feel anything because something died in their home they're enjoying sin and they're not confessing of the sin amen that's a quite a revelation from the Holy Ghost I thank God for that Revelation amen because it brings people up in Repentance and tears after years of uh uh years of of harboring sin and not confessing stealing uh pornography and ly and that I said the very fact you're repenting of this that proves God is still with you hallelujah boy I tell you they really weep their way to the Cross amen I really enjoyed that I don't like to be too detailed but they all this not coming out of their nose that's just that's just my way of uh maybe it's too little gross for you but to me it's like that's a real sincerity right there by God's word unashamed amen unashamed the presence of God hallelujah if Jesus could die on the cross for us what's the least we can do is weep at the altar for him hallelujah amen if he became a mess on the cross we ought to become messy for the word of God hallelujah Glory so see that now I'm I'm I lost my or left my text uh John 168 what is he going to do he's going to convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment see the Holy Ghost is going to convict you this is righteous this is unrighteous that's true and then he's going to convict you of judgment remember Jesus said uh judge all things a spirit Paul said a spiritual man judges all things amen the Holy Ghost will help you judge things in your life is this righteous is this right or wrong it'll help you judge spirits and also convict you of sin hallelujah amen amen of sin because they believe not on me of righteous because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged amen amen hallelujah amen brother R said I love this quote brother R said the foolish virgin is already saved he said even if they don't listen to me he said the foolish virgin is already saved because the word's already been judged in other words Jesus was the brass serpent all the Judgment for sin was already paid for amen he said they don't have to believe what I preach he said if they don't believe that shows where they're headed for he said it shows they're headed for the tribulation he said but if they believe the general word of God then they're saved because the word is already judged amen oh hallelujah praise God the word is judged amen God put all the judgment on Jesus Christ to save Sinners of whom you and I are chief sometimes amen hallelujah see by the spirit of God there's going to come a headstone how many looking for the Rapture I'm looking for the Rapture we're looking for the Rapture it's going to come by Grace Grace unmar favor unmar favor Hallelujah that's how it's going to come Amen brother said not by some great might or some power or some organization or something it's coming by the grace of God Amen how the message get to you the grace of God Amen how'd you get the Holy Ghost how'd you get baptized the grace of God hallelujah how you going to go to the Rapture the grace of God I love it brother all said it's God's grace all the way through Grace kept me so I could get saved Grace Sanctified me Grace gave me the Holy Ghost Grace will help me overcome my bows and Grace will take me to the meeting in the air oh hallelujah praise God God's grace does it all the time Hallelujah I didn't ask for the message I wasn't looking for it necessarily like I told you I knew there was deeper things of God I knew I wanted to serve God at some point ran from it for all those 19 years but it was God's grace that brought it to me I'm so thankful God's grace extended to me Hallelujah I'm the Unworthy one I don't deserve it but God's grace is given to me anyway amen amen like brother Cam and I were talking the other day we like I told you last week God's going to get us ready for the Third Exodus remember if you haven't listened to the Third Exodus go listen to it the first Exodus was Israel out of Egypt the second Exodus was the the day of Pentecost from Judaism to Grace said the Third Exodus is our Rapture that's right amen hallelujah so see how did Israel get out of Egypt by grac amen God sent him a prophet right how did the Saints get the Holy Ghost God gave them Grace amen amen Jesus came and proved I'm resurrected now you go wait for the promise of God Amen they were all scattered they all all those big Burly the Fisher but Peter the Fisher they all forsook Jesus and ran away from him right Smite the shepherd and Scattered the Sheep those big strong Burly men got afraid and they ran away from Jesus Jesus said that's okay my grace will still reach out to you oh Church God's grace still still reach out to you amen amen just come back to Jesus just believe in the word of God confess your sins amen trust in the power of God it's God's grace reaching out to you and I hallelujah amen amen not of works that we've done but by grac amen so I said we can we can you know they had trials at the first Exodus they had trials at the second Exodus right remember they were they they were uh in the day before the day of Pentecost they were up in Upper Room for fear the Bible said they fear they're going to be arrested or taken to the S Sanhedrin Council and see they had to go through something in order to bring about the Exodus we're going to have to go through something to go about the Exodus hallelujah we're going to have to endure something some level of a squeeze I read you that there yeah this sermon has the prophecy where it actually says a a little persecution will come upon the church so whatever you call it pressure or persecution we know it's not wrath amen that's one thing we know we've already passed from the wrath of God because we're under the grace of God hallelujah amen amise God pass from Death un Life church member you are not under condemnation there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen who walk after the spirit and not the flesh amen amen hallelujah amen now this is a beautiful thing if you haven't heard this in a while a brother as a brother online asked me to make a video about it I said well I got to wait till the right time I don't know if this is the time but brother now he's read his text right out of Zechariah now he's start talking about zerubabel anybody remember zerubabel yeah he was the first prince to lead uh 42,000 Jews out of Babylon back to Israel crossing the desert how would you been like the leader of a family of 42,000 people zable did that I wouldn't like that assignment everybody's looking at him zable what you GNA do Z you know his name means born in Babylon that's what we were we were born in Babylon but God's got a a restoration for us amen we're born in Babylon but God is going to help us to restore and finish the temple of God Amen the statue of perfect man amen the body of Christ amen God's going to help us to be at the top amen God's going to help us to be ready for the coming of The Headstone Hallelujah that's what this quote this that's what this quote is all about brother says zable had laid the foundation of the building so after uh Nebuchadnezzar uh destroyed Solomon's Temple they didn't have a temple for 70 years right and then zeruel comes back the first thing he builds is an altar so they can kill animals I wonder if the Jews today will do that first because they could draw from that inspiration okay yeah I've always been told Brother William that they won't sacrifice until they get an actual Temple but they could actually draw seem like they could draw inspiration from zerubabel because they they first built the Altar and then they started sacrificing then they laid the foundation of the temple and then they had to finish the temple but they were already sacrificing the being that's interesting I never just thought about that right now sorry just added my thoughts to this sermon this is like extra thoughts there by God's grace he said now how many we do this thing I want you to put on your spiritual thinking you're anointing jacket go and put your anointing jackets on here all right that's a brother and S this morning as we think yeah I better put mine on too by way I don't want to miss the anointing here by God's grace brother said this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he laid the foundation stone right and we know Jesus Christ is the Cornerstone right amen the Jews stumbled him over but we don't stumble him over him Hallelujah the Bible say we fall on him he doesn't fall on us that's right other words we our whole life Falls at the altar right we just we give Jesus Jesus take my whole life amen I fall on you I'm in your hands do with me whatever you want I'm all yours Jesus amen I fall on you Jesus amen amen hallelujah he said now zuub laid the foundation stone which he did and he'll also bring forth The Headstone that's what the vers is that we read about I want you to notice he never said he'll bring forth the Cornerstone he'll bring forth The Headstone now we know the scripture said Jesus Christ Chief Cornerstone he's also the headstone now if we'll think for a few minutes the seven Church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers amen so brother is saying zerubabel was a type of him that's right Zer was had to finish the temple and he's saying see the seven Church age messenger has to finish the mystery of God pretty good type right pretty good type now it's not a perfect type right because Paul laid the foundation how many remember that for the Bible Paul said I'm a wise master builder and I laid the foundation so see it's not a perfect type it's a partial type if it was a perfect type then brother Brandon would have laid the foundation and brother Brandon would have brought the the capso message right is that right can see that Amen brother BR did not lay the foundation brother R restored it by God's grac amen He restored uh the word the Revelation right the understanding of the Bible he finished the mystery of God so see it's not a perfect type and that's so if I make a video at the brother's request I have to say that this is not a perfect type it's a partial type he said in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord not by organization amen not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days amen amen now don't forget the verses there's in my book I wrote six verses brother R fulfilled okay I'll see if I can remember of them Malachi 45 and6 right he turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen John the Baptist turn the hearts of the fathers to the children right remember turning the heart means opening the heart and the heart now is open to the word of God you repented and now you're going to serve God hallelujah all right Luke 17:30 the son of man the days of the son of man Jesus uh anointing brother brandom in a prophetic Ministry to the Gentiles as it was days of lot days of Sodom we gone through that uh I did Amos 3:7 and8 when a lion roars who who who will but fear it's a prophet of God hallelujah God Reveals His his Mysteries to his servants the prophets amen that's the only one who gets a mystery amen amen is his servant the prophets and some people say brother R didn't uh give us any Revelation any secret things yes he did he gave us the Seven Seals amen there his his his interpretation of the Seven Seals was different than anybody else's by far it's not even close and I'm glad God led me to study that praise Goden CU now they can't deceive me brother William Jesus said that let no man deceive you amen so what do you got to do you got to study your self approved unto God Amen Hallelujah that's how you do it amen you know you know men and women are out to deceive you so you better study your self approved Hallelujah that's right no so nobody can deceive me on these things because the Lord has shown me them hallelujah amen all right uh the other one is uh Acts 3 20 and 21 the Bible said Heaven Must receive Jesus until the restitution of all things so Jesus is going to sit on the throne until everything's restored am glory amen hallelujah and then once everything's restored that brother that last name on the book has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost then Jesus will step off and'll come and snatch his bride off the Earth in the meeting of the air say honey it's time for the wedding ceremony amen and church we'll be ready by the grace of God how you want to be ready am you'll be ready you're waiting praise God you're wa you're in with your lamp trimming clear look up your Redemption draws near Hallelujah remember the trimming of the lamp remember that means you got to cut off the carbon so cut off the old deadness that's making your fire not so bright anything that's hurting your testimony Saints cut it off amen make sure the fire is burning as bright as it can the church said amen amen hallelujah I'm glad some people got that Revelation this past weekend real blessing okay the last one uh was it was it already came to me but I just seem to slip my mind oh yeah Matthew 17:11 Jesus said truly Elias shall first come and restore all things but I say Elias is already come already and they did not recognize it so he recognizes two Elijah Ministries there's going to come Elijah to restore but Elijah the other Elijah of Malachi 46 already came oh it's beautiful praise God Amen remember John didn't restore right John didn't restore John prepared the way amen right so John's Ministry was a preparation Ministry brother's Ministry was a restoration Ministry amen Oh Glory praise God that's right now let's see where we at here okay there we go now now just Just A Brief Review remember Zumer will LED 42,3 60 people back to Israel in the second year he erected an altar and laid the foundation of the temple and the second year is back all right and then the Samaritans remember he C they caused the work to cease for 16 years until two prophets caused the work to continue ha ey and Zechariah amen amen and remember God rebuked them God said why do you make your houses he called them sealed houses why do you make your houses so beautiful and so adored when the house of God is unfinished but the Bible said I love this look here to the Bible said but they prospered through the prophesying of Hagi the prophet and Zechariah the son of Ido and church that's what we've experienced we Prosper through the ministry of brother brandom how many how many can say they prospered amen amen like I just told you that testimony this how a financial need was met that's one more reason this message has prospered me praise God Amen just a that's a simple reason true and that's just a natural what spiritual praise God Amen when I'm discouraged when I'm doubting when I'm going through troubles fears sickness whatever it is the Holy Ghost comes upon me and he renews my strength like the eag hallelujah amen amen see Church don't be discouraged a year goes by and nothing happens don't be discouraged 10 years go by you feel like you fail God don't be discouraged keep trusting God oh cuz what it's not going to be works it's going to be by Grace Hallelujah Always by Grace hallelujah amen hallelujah it can't fail God can't fail and God won't let you fail because you you you committed yourself to God you fell on Jesus amen as we said amen you said God take take responsibility for my life take control of my life I'm nothing without you I can do nothing without you praise God Amen if anything is going to be accomplished in my life it's going to be because of your grace Hallelujah not because of my works so don't let periods of of quietness and periods of Where's God don't let that discourage you God will send a prophecy God will send you a word oh hallelujah praise God and I've seen nothing but spiritual and physical Prosperity through brother an's Ministry but remember I'm not promised physical Prosperity God doesn't promise that yeah right remember James chapter 2 says God has chosen the poor of this world rich in faith to be inheritors of eternal life amen and remember what James said he said isn't it the rich man that'll draw you into courts and try to prosecute you it's always those filthy rich ones and I mean Filthy Rich like lots of money and also filthy spiritually filthy sins that they commit so they got a double compound meaning of filthy amen that's right that's what the Bible says now now think about that church he laid the Cornerstone he comes around and finally after 16 years I no I'm sorry it's four more years after that so 20 years after they started he's the one he actually takes that stone and lays the headset on there and they could say it is finished hallelujah amen Grace did it Grace double Grace all this Grace Came Upon me after 20 years God finished what he started praise God though we fail God and it seems like we're putting God behind his calar there's nothing out of cater with God Almighty hallelujah hallelujah Grace laid the Cornerstone Grace brought the headstone the same man could say 20 years later praise God God finished this it was God God gets all the glory amen we're not patting ourselves in the back look at we did to make the rure look at we've done we're not patting ourselves we're raising our hands and giving God Glory Hallelujah amen stop patting yourself and start raising your hands amen start lifting your hands to Jesus say thank you Jesus it's been your grace that's done this for me hallelujah amen Grace that taught my heart to fear and Grace will leave me home church I know I missed some lines in there but you understand Grace has brought me thus far and Grace will lead me all the way home amen hallelujah amen oh yeah and the last thing that's recorded in the Bible he led a a renewal of the Passover and that's a type of the Cross amen right the Passover Lamb type of Jesus Christ and it was a joyful the Bible calls it joyful they were so happy my goodness uh we get a Passover land and the death Angels going to pass over us oh what a revelation amen amen look they're doing the worship of their fathers their hearts have turned back to their fathers amen that's what we've got amen the Bible said we have Christ is our Passover how many know that amen 1 Corinthians 5 says Jesus Christ is our Passover he's also our unleavened bread amen of course we know he's the resurrection Hallelujah the first fruits amen I need to go through that maybe sometime somebody remind me here I trust the Holy Spirit remind me we'll go through those seven feasts of Israel again I don't know brother Austin you remember that one remember a little bit okay be probably good to go through that by God's grace especially with Nia and those three uh new baptisms by God's grace be good to go through that so you can see it that's it's not only natural it's prophetic as well has prophetic significance as well y all right how I doing on time I didn't even set the timer okay sorry now now what's interesting church if you would go to let's go to uh Hagi 2 hagy I 2 let me get that song Daniel Hosea Joel and amus Obadiah Jonah Micah naam habac Zephaniah Hagia there it is you can find Zephaniah it's right after Zephaniah Hallelujah probably find uh Daniel numerous books after Daniel Hagi chapter 2 go to verse three Hagi 2:3 now I want to just bring this thought about zeru I just felt L of the Holy Spirit uh this has been on my heart for over I think maybe a year now you know we'll go back to three but let's read verse 9 here's the reason I'm reading verse n the glory of this latter house should be greater than that of the former sayith the Lord of host and in this place will I get peace say the Lord of hosts now this was spoken uh when zerubabel laid the found I'm sorry when zerubu was this Foundation sorry pardon me the temples okay so I don't remember this if this was the finishing of the house it might have been the finishing of the house yeah yeah yeah this the finishing of the house okay so uh you know the message people that call themselves the goats they'll use that verse and they'll say the glory of the latter is greater than the former and they're calling themselves the latter the latter Temple so they're greater in glory than every other Church age I've heard them say it church but listen I don't want to condemn them because I was listening to a sermon sister Zer shared that sermon with me from 2007 and a preacher said uh Paul couldn't live in this day cuz he didn't have what it takes and so we're stronger than Paul and I heard myself say amen I just told on myself did y'all catch that and I was so immature I said amen but now I'd say I wouldn't say anything I just smed pretend like I'm trying to agree okay so see I I grown I grown Hallelujah I grown Paul could live Paul could live in anything because he labored more because of the grace of God Amen Grace amen it's Grace amen he said not I but Grace Within Me praise God laboring grace amen hallelujah brother calls it so now now that you understand that let's go up to verse three who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory that's speaking of Solomon's house amen now let me go to that picture all right got that now Solomon's house was large but it was nothing compared to this Millennial that we're going to get by God's grace it's about uh 2/3 or 34s of a football field pretty big pretty big what a house he says uh and how do you see it now is it not your eyes in comparison as it is nothing okay now we'll get to this in a little bit too uh so here's artist idea of Zero's house the only Dimensions we have is that it's 60 by 60 right uh yeah 60 high and 60 wides I'm not sure even how they drew this it looks like 60 high but that's not 60 wide um but that I read that that is true Ezra 63 okay so the people were looking at this house of zual and said Remember the young people were shouting they're like praise God we got a house and the old people were like oh this is such to debacle and God said don't despise the day of small things God works in Big things and God works in humility too amen God can work in a small Church like ours amen because God works in small things as well as great things Hallelujah God is no respector of big churches let's remind ourselves of that I need to always remind myself of that amen H Allelujah okay so let me go back so Solomon's was more it was made of gold all these things like that clearly clearly zal was not made of gold because the old guys were crying oh man this doesn't look nothing like it used to okay now if you would now go down to verse 6 for thus sayi the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while now look a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land so everything what I'm trying to tell you is that the glory of the latter house is the millennial house not referring to us because if you were paying attention or I'm sure you were I'm sure but if you remember from the Millennium sermons you'll understand this is speaking of the Millennium yeah look at the context we're going to look at it right now look at verse 7 and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come has Jesus come back yet no no has all nations be been shook yet no China is still standing Russia is still standing us is still standing M all the nations have not been shaken and Jesus has come and I'll fill this house house with glory sayith the lord of hosts that's right amen amen the house is full right now zuo's house this house never got filled with God's glory so it wasn't referred to that one right and if you go study the Bible herod's house either herod's was much grander this never got even though Jesus was there and the fullness of God was in him the Bible never said that house would fill with his glory cuz they grieve the Holy Spirit yeah do it right so see you have to understand the context of things that's right you have to have brother said you got to find a little detail here a little detail there he's talking about that in the Revelation series 1961 he said you got to look at every detail and put it together and then you'll understand what it's talking about praise God Amen verse eight the silver is mine the Gold is mine sayi the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former sayith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace sayith the Lord of hosts did they have peace in her Temple no no right they didn't have it so this is speaking the glory of the latter house wasn't actually it wasn't actually this house but it was the house of the millennial house amen amen amen because the Lord hadn't come yet the Nations hadn't been shook yet but he is coming hallelujah our King is coming to shake All Nations hallelujah praise God glory to God amen amen now this just for those that love details Solomon's uh house was 60 cubits and the breadth thereof 20 and the height 30 so 60 long 20 wide and then 30 high that was Solomon's right and Solomon's was way greater than this one okay now few more details here church we got to know the cont context and see without the context they'll call themselves we're the greatest we're we're the greatest Church of all time we're the greatest of all the church ages impossible impossible remember brother said Jesus didn't give one compliment to the L Church anybody we didn't get one compliment of nothing amen right because we know it's like to live in this this is a hard time to live but God's grace is always sufficient Hallelujah there's still blood for this age Hallelujah there's still a flying eagle anointing for this age Hallelujah but Jesus did not give it one compliment brother tells us that when he preached it so see Church look look at look at the context this the latter house doesn't apply to context is the Millennium because Ezekiel 43:5 says the house will be filled God's glory that's when Jesus steps in the house that's the house I want to be in amen when Jesus himself steps in the house and sits down in the the ho of H that's the house I Want To Worship in Oh Brother William All Fall Down and imagine for a whole year it was just maybe I don't know I'm just making that up but amen imagine we'll just enjoy that for days and days worshiping Jesus the king is on the son of David is on the throne of David and of his kingdom there shall be no end Hallelujah and we get to be a part of that hallelujah amen sorry I'm so excited I guess I'm kind of going on for the weekend Services there by God's grace oh my look her's Temple was never filled the glory of God no verse says her's Temple was filled with the glory of God I said somebody Pro me wrong remember the Bible said the spirit took me up and brought me in the inner Court behold the glory of the Lord filled the house Hallelujah Zero's Temple never had a glory exceed Solomon's Glory now look God's spirit filled Solomon's house so the greater glory would only be in the Millennium because the house was larger and the GL the king of glory himself would sit in that house amen so in Solomon's house the Holy Ghost came in but in the millennial house Jesus comes in who's full of the Holy Ghost amen and he fills the house amen it's the Lord of glory amen it's God manifest In the Flesh it's Emmanuel God is with us hallelujah amen amen oh I love the word of God brother I love the word of God my God's word don't lie hallelujah amen the shaking of the Nations remember isn't until HEB Hebrews 12:26 and 27 MH the Bible said God will shake All Nations he he shall Shake All Nations but we've got a kingdom that cannot be moved what do we got we have a portion of the kingdom of God right now in our souls amen the kingdom of God is within you praise God Amen how do you know brother says because you keep the word of the king Amen brother said how you going to disagree with the King and be in his kingdom I love that it's just a simple teaching right you disagree with Jesus how you going to be in Jesus Kingdom you're not going to be right but we will be by God's grace I don't know what time I started but it's almost 8:00 I guess I'll just start here stop right at 8:00 Lord willing everybody say everybody just hear that Lord willing by God's grace all right just trying to now and then brother R takes you know he takes that idea of the The Headstone and he goes to the Pyramid of Giza and uh here's what he says uh he said The Headstone was never put on the pyramid I've been there the architecture of it can never be replaced till this day we have no machines you realize that you have no machines one time I watched a video of the Chinese they tried to re do a reproduction with uh with machines and it was only like it was like 100 I I don't remember the fraction it was so tiny in comparison and Chinese are smart right all the scientists in America are smart you know all the scientists around the world are smart but they couldn't even get close with their machines to building something like this and remember this this pyramid L it it it stayed still through the flood yeah it was Rock St I mean I how you can say it his foundations couldn't be moved amen oh my it's a type of the Holy Ghost amen amen my goodness brother said it had to have Atomic power to move those stones now I've never been there but I heard brother Jason dears he said you should he was there last year he said you can't believe how big it is and how the stones are perfectly laid together and how cut perfectly even to this day lasting all those it would have been What U let's see Enoch would have been about 5,000 years ago it's lasted that long Hallelujah and I want you to see this brother says I'm going to read this quote down here well said I don't believe in there such a thing like you say like the Zodiac or like the pyramid Doctrine and things so some Churches go too far on the Pyramid of Giza you know they try to look at all the steps in there and they try to you know they try to measure like the side of the one time they did a side they measure the side of one of the the pyramid there and they thought well each each foot represents a year so the Rapture is going to be in 2012 you remember that you remember that all these people they're trying to scare us boy they love this the devil loves to put fear on the church right amen I like that list uh uh it goes back to the year 2000 uh Y2K is going to kill you and then for every year there's something was going to kill you yet we're still here by God's grace amen hallelujah just trust in the Lord amen amen neoch to your understanding and I just like what brother man says now we believe Enoch built it because he was a type of the Rapture for the Gentiles now we get criticized by that but it's it's a lot easier to believe that than than what these accusers say that men actually Build It come on they can't even build it today right it was so easy why don't they build it today it was built Supernatural because it's a witness hallelujah it's a witness of the Rapture it's a witness of the stature for of man it's a witness of the seven Church agents amen and that pyramid is going to get capped off it needs a headstone Hallelujah it needs a Capstone in other words this church needs Jesus Christ to come back amen and he's going to come back and cap out the church and Grace will bring him back Grace will make us ready hallelujah amen amen the Pyramid of Giza is a wh of the pyramid shaped new city that is to come to the Earth even its location is a w a witness amen see because it's in it's an Egypt it's so close to Israel now he talks about Enoch but I'm just going to skip to this so the Pyramid of Giza is there look how close it is to Israel it's so close even that's a sign there's a verse in Isaiah I don't have it but there's a verse in Isa Isaiah that says that pyramid will be a signed to the Nations that's right I can't remember it now I need to look it up it just came to me now I didn't think of it while I was studying today but that's what it looks like I mean look look at these small people down here so Jason dears he's a preacher he like you just can't believe it you can't how could people nobody could build that right right it's just so massive so large and look that's where it is I mean uh it's there right there by Israel right where the fut right right where the millennial Temple's going to land and right where the new Jerusalem's going to come down amen amen it's right there as a witness it's a pyramid showing that there's a pyramid coming amen is that it is that right there it is amen I've been waiting for that the whole time it's a pyramid showing that there's someone coming back there's a headstone coming back to cap off this pyramid and there's a spiritual pyramid in New Jerusalem it's the bride's home hallelujah it's the it's the home of the Heavenly bride and the Earthly bridegroom that pyramid's coming down to this earth Hallelujah and we get to live in the city with Jesus amen amen amen amen Oh Glory Hallelujah church I never heard this in I was raising the Assemblies of God I never heard things like this but calls this a gastronomical jubilee like you're feasting on these things and you're just having a it's like when you feel good you drink Kucha right you feel it right there it's kind of like that maybe multiply that times 100 you know or eat that steak and you're so hungry M just feel so good in there I don't know what you like to eat but you just put what you like in there but it's just a juile these things we never had any idea about this they were just trying to speak in tongues or or they were just trying to I don't know write a new song or something like this but we're preparing for the end of the world and we're preparing for a brand new world as well amen amen with the Messiah with Jesus Christ the son of David hallelujah we're making ready how many make it ready tonight amen I don't know whatever other pictures I had there oh yeah goes into the dollar now I know there's some Mason there some Freemason I think symbolism here but brother R he doesn't get into that yes yes the Freemasons were trying to do a new order for the ages that's what that word I think that's what that one means if I'm not mistaken but brother just says he says God oh yeah this is God has favored our undertaking I'm not sure which one is that I don't remember which one but brother says look it's called a seal and even the Freemasons They're copying God we know they're off the word right right but even They're copying God the pyramid needs its its headstone and brother R said every dollar witnesses that Jesus Christ is coming back that's what brother Ram said amen amen hallelujah every dollar and brother every every time you sign a check I'll say like this every time you get a receipt and it say of 224 that means in the year of Our Lord man said you can't escape God no man he said you can't wash the blood of Jesus off your hand you can only get it on your heart praise God you can't escape Jesus he's everywhere he's on the m he's on the calendar he's in the church Hallelujah he's in our souls Hallelujah we just wanted more and more we wanted to come back hallelujah amen come Lord Jesus come amen I'm all stirred up from having you know to preach to somebody else you know Hallelujah I think that was it yep that was it now Brother Talks more about this the Stones he said the stones were not cut by machines they're not cemented they're just cut so they Join one another that's the way a the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut by the holy spirit so see you got to come to church expecting God's got to cut some things out of my life amen I'm not perfect do we have any perfect people here like I love brother Donnie said he said I'm going to check the the coat rack did anybody hang up their angel wings when they came in there got some angels in here I love his sense of humor I've always loved his sense of humor none of us are angry right none of us are sinless beings we all need to be cut by the power of the Holy Spirit oh yes we need to be cut so we fit in with the body of Jesus Christ amen amen remember they had their rough edges remember Peter had his rough edges I'm not eating with you Gentiles I'm not eating with you I'm afraid that these Jewish teachers are going to be uh not they're going to be upset with me right he wasn't perfect he had to be cut by Paul oh my glory help us Jesus send us the right preachers to cut us amen amen amen with me help the pastor be able to preach so it cuts me sometimes right I want to build your faith but sometimes everybody needs cut I need cut sometimes too it's nothing personal thank I mean it's personal between you and Jesus that's me it's that person with me a lot of times I don't even know what I'm preaching amen usually it's just a minor thing I just mentioned in past and that's what God uses to speak to somebody said the holy spirit is God great instrument and Tool the holy spirit is God's tool that we be joined as one person the Bible say be in one mind and one Accord we could all just come to church and have one thing in mind amen we want the Holy Ghost to move amen amen that would be that's the most powerful times we'll have yeah we're not divided we should be one person and it goes to show that no Machinery can do it that way it takes God to do that the pyramid but also the church that's right amen no mechanics of organization no loges none of these things can ever do it as good as their intentions are they can never do it because it takes God to do this the holy spirit amen and I just thought for good measure since we stopped by brandom Tabernacle I just thought I'd bring this up since he mentioned machines and Machinery I thought I'd bring this out brother William oh Hallelujah God can do whatever he wants to do well how do you know that brother Ram God won't leave his program that's the reason we know this day it's got to be simple see now he always works in Simplicity but God in the beginning could have made made the sun preach the gospel who knows where I'm going anybody read ahead or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose amen imperfect men who make mistakes like brother Jesse who sin sometimes like brother Jesse God ordained men to preach the gospel for that purpose and he never changes it amen church we went to those two went to the new brand Tabernacle and the old brandom Tabernacle and they're ghost towns you realize no one has worshiped there for over four years no one has even worshiped there I went to their website the website said oh we only got to wait six weeks then we can back we can be back in the building and here we are four years later what kind of people what kind of leadership would let the Sheep not gather together would keep them in their homes yeah and keep telling them just press play obey we don't need the preachers oh you should only listen to God's voice and not these men mhm well what did Brother Brandon say uh even better what the Bible say it's a ghost out there's you saw it I'll show you the pictures afterwards if you want to see it but there's nobody there yeah they don't even gather on Sunday they're they're totally different than what brother Brandon was amen amen when brother left to church he said I need a pastor to be here to preach while I'm gone he didn't say press play he said preach the word amen amen be instant in season and out of season Hallelujah Glory I know you hear me preach a lot but it just fresh on my mind cuz I stopped by there this week and I thought I'm getting a picture with these this these are my Arch enemies brother Austin I thought I'll get a picture kind of like uh Luther nailing the 95 feces that's I should I should have printed off those 24 lies that they're preaching I should have Tak it to their their gate next time brother next time that brother said he's going to invite me out there next summer so you remind me all okay I'm just going to tap I want pound it I won't I promise no Nails just tape painters tape look he said he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices that's right oh sure you believe every word on the tape I'm waiting for you to play this quote I'm waiting for you to put this on your blog Church the brandom Tabernacle blog he never ordained M or any Angel being it was man and when he brought Deliverance of the people down there he said a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves oh my what a God he is unfolding himself in Simplicity amen oh my amen and you know why it's been four years they got to have the right speakers and they got to have the right projector and the right screen so everybody can hear that machine perfectly look at all that man wisdom but what does God what does God hide himself in God hides himself in simplicity a man who spits and shouts and whatever you know Simon does whatever do with his beard you know whatever all our different mannerisms God hides himself in Simplicity and God can never change his program brother Austin amen he can never change it he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah amen amen amen that's right God said a church needs a man on fire to preach the gospel to the people to keep them on fire amen amen amen all right where am I at I'm at 802 okay all right let me close I'll CL I'll close with this by God's grace did I skip anything well yeah let me read this here yeah he talks about the dollar bill there in paragraph 55 then 56 now according to the prophecy there will come a headstone I want you to notice when The Headstone comes that Prince is going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace for it's by Grace we are saved lest any man should boast M yes and the message of Grace has been tramped under feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security Now what does eternal security mean that's Calvinism if you ever heard Calvin Calvinism versus Armenian ISM I just heard some calvinist this week brother Austin but I heard the cist and they say like we have nothing to do with salvation absolutely nothing to do didn't Peter say repent he didn't say do nothing he said repent amen and then he said uh give diligence to make your calling and election sure and then Paul said perfect Holiness in the fear of God you have to do something in other words you have to repent amen amen they these these cists swing so far the eternal security they swing so far well you can fall out a church and you can uh divorce and remarry and go to prosecution you'll still be saved let's AE you must repent Hallelujah you must repent and believe praise God Amen amen and see that that's why brother R preached the real Grace if you receive Grace then the Bible said uh the Bible said now you're one of God's workmanship created unto good works that he's already ordained for you to do that's right think about that you parents you ordained to have those children that was ordained of God and your desire your your your work of God is to raise them to love Jesus amen hallelujah and I'm just going to share this I preach this over in uh Kentucky I haven't preached you here yet so it doesn't look like I'm stopping anytime soon sorry honey I try to stop but the Holy Spirit keeps prompting me with these thoughts I read an article this or last week and it said Instagram is like the introductory app to pornography uh through Facebook right the owner of Facebook he bought it up and this one article proved if you log in and you don't even make an account within a three or four clicks they're going to show you porn so the point is children parents don't let your children on that on Instagram that's none of our children are on any uh social media right is Lydia W she probably shouldn't call names here you know love all my children my um that's what I used that's the Gateway that's that's the Gateway look what are all the young people on all the old people on Facebook all young people on Instagram and Tik Tok and Tik tok's the same I forget within how many clicks they're going to introduce porn to you I'm I'm glad I'm not I've never been on Tik Tok I'm glad for that by God's grace right but it doesn't matter I mean I was on Instagram for a few moments you know but it doesn't really matter the thing to do is now that we know we should do something about it praise God right and I told them when I preached I think it was Saturday yeah with the the death I said these uh uh I I said you know uh people give their kids the the devic is too early and they don't even know what they're doing right they don't even know what they're doing and they don't even bother up to ask what they're doing so I told them I said I'm not I didn't give my children cell phones until they were 16 you should have seen some of the people I I saw 12 years old with cell phones and they're the whole time they're like this right remember girls you saw 12 year olds 12y olds because they've been to the camps they've seen all the other 12y olds the message message camps okay all right go aad and call yourself message but the proof that you're in the message is that you got Christ in you that's the proof that's the proof you real message Believers all right I better stop right there now um so brother says he now remember you go back to brother would be the zable anti-type crying out Grace Grace The Headstone coming amen God's grace will finish this church and we'll be raptured it's got to be Grace God's grace amen he says it runs out into eternal security the calvinist some of them Runs Out in everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and that's there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's Grace it's but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by I'm closing with this one here I will close with this try so in the deed of Jesus Christ now that he's talking about his vision of the three rainbows so in the deed of Jesus Christ if the Lord would come there and confirm that that is the truth and not only that but by his word he confirms the truth one person in the godhead and by signs and wonders right that's what the rainbows he's talking about he confirms is the truth that also Grace is the said if my go if my teaching on the godheads right my teaching on is Right amen it's not internal security and it's not saved by works it's saved by grace and grace produces a a love in your heart that you want to do something for God but you're not saved by what you do for God you're saved by what God did for you am amen then why could anyone criticize and say that Grace is wrong that we're saved by works that's what the Catholic Church did that's why Martin Luther came out against it and I even looked up this week Jehovah's Witnesses believe that too you're sa by Grace as long as to the the conduct of the church that that's adding on you're saved by grace through faith and if you have faith what will you do you'll repent if you have faith amen amen right we're saved by grace that through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved yeah but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved amen look at this some people thinks because I join a message church I'm adding message in there because I join a message Church put my name on the message book or I'm sorry the put my name in the the church directory that's all I have to do some people thinks because I shout that's all I have to do you better have more than a shout better make sure after you shout you keep shouting Hallelujah other things because I speak in tongues that's all I have to do some things because I got power to heal the sick that's all I have to do it's not not it's the grace of God that saves you God's Amazing Grace amen amen I cannot trust in any marage that's right you cannot trust well I've been preaching eight 20 years brother Austin surely got I'm saved because I've been preaching 20 years that's a lie I'm trusting in my works well surely God will save me because I I made uh 11 years of YouTube videos no that works right everything I do is just my appreciation whenever it amount to praise God but that's not why I'm saved I'm saved by God's grace hallelujah amen I love this I love God's grace some said well there's a great man that man I've heard him stand up and do this I've heard him stand up and and do that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with the tongue of men and angels though I have discernment though I have gifts to to feed the poor I'll take all my goods and feed the poor though I can move mountains with faith though I have knowledge to understand all things I'm nothing till love come love comes in which is Grace amen Grace has got to do it you can do all these things and still be lost that's what the Bible says yeah it's Grace that saves you God's grace to the human race amen now I like this verse and the let's read this together ready oh I'm your eyes sorry you can read if you're close one two three and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love Jesus so look the grace came to you and it this Grace brought exceeding Faith Hallelujah and it brought exceeding love amen in other words God's spirit Came Upon you God's grace come upon you it gives you faith and it gives you love amen is that right church amen how many received God's grace am guess what you got exceeding faith and exceeding love amen now you just got to put to work let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musician see I need you Lord I need you every hour I need you just play that we'll have a word of prayer here well thank God the the screen never went off no glitches tonight how are you glad for that I'm thankful praise God church we ought to be so thankful for God's Amazing Grace amen we have so much we are So Unworthy of God's Amazing Grace we have no merit by the way there's nothing we could offer to God and say I deserve to be saved I have nothing I have no [Music] merits and I love that quote I don't have the quote up here but remember brother said if I have to do one thing to be saved then Jesus Christ died in vain think about that quote think about that meditate on that just for a moment if I have to do one thing to be saved to earn my salvation then the cross was all in vain what Jesus suffered it didn't mean nothing what a lie that is there's nothing we can do other than just repent right we just have to say I'm sorry Jesus I recognize you're my savior I recognize you're the brass serpent I recognize you've been judged for my sins forgive me of my sins Lord I trust in you so I can be saved Jesus that's all we can do yes not Jesus that's what saves us that's why we teach these little children get them baptized as soon as they can as soon as as Jem has been talking about being baptized and now she's resed in Christ back but when she when she can when she can speak it with her words and say mommy or daddy I'm a sinner I want to go to heaven when she can say that remember that that's amazing grace as soon as she can recognize I'm a filthy she want to say that I'm a I'm just a sinner amen there's nothing good in me I'm a Sinner by Nature nobody's got to teach me to sin right we got a sin nature and we got a divine nature yeah Divine Nature has a sin nature and a divine nature Hallelujah but if I have to do one thing if I have to make one YouTube video if I have to preach one sermon to be saved then the cross does it it was in vain church we should be so thankful for God's Amazing Grace thank you Jesus
