========================================

Matthew chapter 11 verse 11. start there appreciate the feedback I got three or four people that said they really enjoyed that message including my brother so that was a real blessing by God's grace I want to thank Lydia uh Kirsten my wife for sharing a little thought with me for last Wednesday's service Matthew 11 verse 11. let's read that together on three one two three verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word may be seated we're trying to watch your time like I want to get back into school mode uh going to bed at midnight is not a good idea me many times God has given me strength but as I get older I don't want to attempt the Lord um so I gotta get back in kind of this oh I told me I used to preach like 45 minutes I thought was is that is that true is that true you tell the truth I try to do less songs like I did four songs I don't know if you noticed that I used to do five songs sometimes six I'm trying to shorten the songs so praise the Lord let's look at uh we're not all giant Killers part two if you would I like to start in uh the book of First Samuel so if you go back there that's kind of where we started with David last week but if you go to First Samuel 13 13 and then just hold your place there I thought I would just go to uh I had this thought you know today about King Saul and he was he was not the Giant Killer although he could have been so Goliath was challenging the king no doubt right and he was bigger than everyone else so of all the people that you'd think would step up to the plate and defeat the giant he was afraid to and so this is a interesting part of the story that said the entire Army of Israel could have been giant Killers everybody had the opportunity right but God of course by this time he knew Saul's character right he knew Saul wouldn't have the character to do it so he had to raise up a ruddy beautiful handsome little boy their teenage boy named David to do it and remember brother brother random said and this had been the case David had a revelation he was going to win that's the only way you and I could ever defy some incredible mountain or Giant in our life right because we could we can give a positive confession let's say for a couple days right I really uh I admire people who can go weeks and months and years with positive confession yeah that takes a lot of Grace right it takes a lot of strength but David from what we know he must have got the vision or he must have gotten the word of the Lord that day it was a fresh revelation it would take a revelation to stand if you're four feet or maybe he was five feet tall it would take a revelation if he's nine or ten feet and you're five feet half his size it would take a revelation to know you're going to speak to him harshly and you're going to defeat him and you're going to cut his head off by the end of the battle it would take a revelation and so we know the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against the Revelation so since David prevailed David had a revelation praise God and of course David is called a prophet in the book of Acts if I'm not mistaken but here we see Saul had a chance to be a giant killer so did every single person in the Army but God knew there would be only one who would receive the Revelation to do it praise God Amen a church I believe according to the scripture I believe any one of those men could have stepped up to do it and God may have honored their faith I said may now why do I say that because in the Bible they asked Jesus Jesus uh who then can get married and what do you say he said some eunuchs were born to be eunuchs right he said some eunuchs are uh some eunuchs are made eunuchs by men other eunuchs just desire to be that way in other words they you know anyone they all had a chance they all could be eunuchs God could allow it God it could be their calling in Life or other people could influence them to be a eunuch and not be married or it could just be their desire to be a eunuch and God would make them their desire right praise God so see if God would allow that if God would honor just a person's desire to be a eunuch then I believe God would honor a person's desire to do a great work for him praise God because they all have their chance they all they all had the opportunity but of course God knew that the fear would set in on day one and then the fear got greater on day two day three four five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty and David gets there on day 40. and the whole Camp is paralyzed with fear and if anyone should have stepped up and should have been solved but Saul could not be a giant killer because of his previous sins and this shows a good lesson Had he got had he stayed true to God he could have been the Giant Killer I believe he would have because David because Samuel said that in first Samuel 13 13. you got that Lydia did you have that did you turn to it no did you turn to his Sisterhood could you read that voice please and Samuel said this song God has done empathy for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever amen thank you Sister We're Not Gonna Give You two glasses but we would if it was Sunday night all right but this is the point I'm making here had Saul obeyed God's word he would have been King instead of David a church that you know if you listen to that Narnia Series right children what does Aslan always say he said you never get to know anyone else's story or what could have been but actually in the Bible we're told one time what could have been there might be more there's probably more I just never had that really thought till recently this is one of the few times we're told had you only done what was right you would have been even greater you would have been a great great man in other words you would have had great Eternal rewards in heaven but because of Disobedience you lost it all this is one of those few times right if you can think of another one uh raise your hand anybody could ever think yeah darling wow that's right we give you two claps if it was Sunday night so what's that say it again Saul and David yeah David right now just apply that to your life so for me you know my one of my greatest struggles is you know if I would do if I'd have done better would God give me a bigger Church thank you I think I've tried to be as faithful as I possibly can I you know just like any Pastor I make mistakes I know to this point I haven't made mistakes that other pastors have made in bigger churches thank God thank God it's only by God's grace but it makes us ask the question right it makes us and the good part about it it just makes us examine Our Lives we don't want to ever live in condemnation I'm gonna say that again there's no condemnation to you if you're in Christ right but God has called us a new works and if we're faithful then the Bible says that God will reward us based upon our obedience right Grace is what saved you but works is what you do out of appreciation for Grace so Saul wasn't very appreciative right he and we know why later because the Bible said Samuel said looked at him and said when you were little on your sight you were a faithful man that's what we got to watch out for right the message movement um we're the greatest of all time like the children just went to a I'm sorry my children children my teenagers 19 teenagers went to a meeting and the first thing the guy preaches is you're the greatest young people of all time now I wonder if he really thought about that that means they're greater than him right because he's a father with teenagers probably and what proof is there there's none there's none the only way I thought they could stretch it is uh if they said well John the Baptist physically was here when Jesus was here so that made him the greatest so whoever is physically here when Jesus here will be the greatest now that could be but we don't have an actual scripture for that that's just that's presuming that that type will repeat again in the New Testament but when brother Branham preached on this they don't see her he said Jesus didn't commend this age for nothing but the rest of Jesus didn't have one good word about this age but yet we know we can be hot and on fire right we're not lukewarm I know that I'm not I'm not lukewarm praise God that's lukewarm I would have stayed at home tonight and taking a shower and just live stream the service right got so hot and sweaty or whatever from the day's work but no we're on fire we want God's mind we want God's word in our minds praise God we want our minds transformed tonight we raise our hands we sing loud we clap we cried we shout we clap we're on fire for Jesus praise God Amen that's right I guess I gotta shout a little louder to prove I'm on fire hallelujah it's true our soul remains on fire Hallelujah amen now you can stay there uh first Samuel 13. actually you know what go to First Samuel 15 17. first Samuel 15 17 Lydia can you just hold that there don't read it yet I looked up in the Easterns Bible dictionary and I was shocked I was reading on Saul he had three signs God had called him to be king I think about you and I mean look at my life do I have three signs God called me to be a pastor not really I mean I got I got maybe two you know numerous people told me even before I was a Christian they knew I was going to be a leader one day and then uh brother Samuel's wife said as soon as she met me she knew I'd be a preacher that's kind of like a two witnesses um there was another one I can't remember I can't think of it now anyways you know some some people feel like oh you got to have a prophecy over your life to know what you're called to do well you might but you might not right so what you have to do is just seek the Lord trust in the Lord keep your heart keep your ground free from Weeds amen if you've got a good and honest heart you will be very fruitful praise God keep all the cares of the world out of your life we got I mean like like the brother said today when I was talking to Mike he's like yeah he said I got too Carefree I didn't even care if the mortgage got paid and he said that was a sin right he got so Carefree just thanking God he got he went overboard and I don't care if we pay the the car the car payment or not it's all good you know we're saved she got way over balanced so he can't be totally carefree and then he says you know caring is a good thing right pressure sometimes is a good thing you want to keep your car you want to keep your house it's those things are good Romeo tells us that there is some tension that's good tension but I just want to read to us here about Saul just you know Lee you know how he came to be like this okay so the first thing I want to read this here his father's she asked his head straight and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them leaving his home at gibia which is the hill of the god Saul and his servant went toward the Northwest over Mount Ephraim and then turning Northeast they came to the land of shalicia and thence Eastward to the land of shalim and that length came to the district of zuff near Samuel's home at Rhema at this point Saul proposed to return from the three days fruitless search but his servants suggested that they first consult The Seer ing that he was about to offer sacrifice the two hasten and darama and behold Samuel came out against them on his way to the Obama or the height where sacrifice was to be offered and an answer to Saul's question tell me I pray thee where the Sears house is Samuel made himself known to him Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming if you read that it's in first Samuel chapter nine we're not going to read it but God told Samuel about Saul coming right Samuel had been divinely prepared and received Saul as his guest he took with him Saul to the sacrifice and then after the feast commune with Saul upon the top of his house of all the things that was in his heart imagine that what would you give to be able to talk to brother Branham and tell him every desire in your heart what would you give that's what Saul had Saul got to sit with the prophet brother you know bro it's it's clear Brothers quotes people would wait years to talk to him years they'd be on a waiting list whenever you come back from overseas or whatever he'd come back to Jeffersonville they would wait years and they would get 15-minute interviews and sometimes the brother gave him the answers right away and it was just short it was just five one one two three or four five minutes then they'd be out he'd give them 15 minute imagine 15 minutes with a prophet of God what would you say I would say Lord Jesus all right I'd say I would say uh Lord Jesus when I go before the prophet tell me how I can know beyond a shadow of a doubt we've got the Holy Ghost and we got rapturing faith give me that's what I want I mean what's more what's more to know that you're born again and if you're truly born again then you rapturing faith has to happen praise God because the resurrection is already in you everything that's in that seed of the Holy Ghost in you it's Arthur that means if you're born again the Rapture is already in you so what have you got to worry about the Rapture is already in US praise God goodness gracious right I take 15 minutes sister who I take 15. I might squeeze off 16. I say oh excuse me program one more please please turn one more question he got to ask the prophet everything that was on his heart and then Samuel took a viable oil and poured it on his head anointed saw his King over Israel giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king three signs talk about a vindication that's why that's why the Bible That's why Samuel said you would have been king forever because God had three signs for you right there's three signs you if you would just would have been a giant killer and church we know that what the real giant was Pride that he had to overcome that was the worst giant of all it wasn't Goliath so much it was his pride he used to be humble but then he got exalted and lifted up right especially when he disobeyed the word of the Lord the straight plain word of the Lord see people people don't realize Church when they stop coming to church they stop paying tithes or any simple any obedience or the women start cutting their hair they don't even realize God is going to make them uh chasten God is going to deal with them and God is going to cut off the blessings praise God just like Saul God is going to cut it off he may let you remain look like you're a good person like Saul got to remain King but he never was the same person because the pride pride got in there and that's why we want to live by every word of God not by fear now we yes we want fear of God not sinful fear we want the fear of the Lord right we want that healthy respect for God but Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commands in other words we got to keep Jesus as our first love amen right that we can be assured that we will accomplish God's will for our lives I would just I would just be so sad to get to heaven and say well you know but Jesse if you've just been more faithful you could have done this and this and that and helped that many people Church what is our lives all about no man says what is our whole life about helping other people what's the greatest blessing I read it to you last week the greatest blessing is what helping others in other words being a servant I love that it's so simple it makes it makes the gospel so simple love Jesus Christ and love other people right the two greatest Commandments love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul mind and strength and love thy neighbor as thyself that's what we're working on we're loving the neighbors children like ourselves the neighbors the neighbor girl come over and say can I have some pizza I said yeah I'll cut my pizza right in half here's yours she ran away she was so happy with that pizza that was the pizza that's her bought too right thank you sisters there see everybody plays A Part that's a good pizza too now um let's read first Samuel 15 17. Lydia got that Okay so we can see that when we're humble God will exalt us is that what the Bible says you humble yourself what would God do God will exalt you right humble yourself Saul used to be humble at the beginning he was humble I had a list of uh yeah look at this I guess you don't I'll just read it Saul won almost every battle he fought before he started compromising on God's word isn't that true are we Invincible armies as long as we're obeying God's word he defeated um the ammonites in first Samuel 11. Jonathan killed the Philistine Governor at gibia in first Samuel 13. the Philistines were defeated by Jonathan and Saul in first Samuel 14. I want to read this if you got your Bible go to First Samuel 14 47. first Samuel 14 47 and 48. I've forgotten about this you know I preached on this years ago I think it was back in 2014 or 2013. first Samuel 14 47. so Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against Moab and against the children of Ammon against and against Edom and against the kings of zoba and against the Philistines and Withers ever I'm sorry withersoever he turned himself he vexed them look at that on every part of his life he was an Overcomers that sound familiar all right you're alive no matter what you're facing at work no matter what your face in school no matter the trials at church right no matter the trials you might face at Aldi or wherever you go Giant Eagle the trials you might face with your finances your family whatever it is God gives you the victory when you're humble praise God men and I like that he Becks them he tormented the Devils right Jesus the devil said don't torment us before your time see church when we overcome it torments devils Hallelujah it upsets the kingdom of heaven right now we know Satan gets Madness when there's a huge Supernatural miracle because on the day of Pentecost 3 000 Souls got saved but they didn't start the persecution until the man of the gate of beautiful was healed the parallel paralytic was healed and then they took him off to jail see church that's when persecution will strike you and I when miracles happen right that's when the real persecution will start but look Saul everywhere he turned victory victory big victory victory everywhere he turned it was Victory all around as long as amen first God is with you when you humble yourself praise God you have nothing to fear Saul had nothing to fear as long as he was humble praise God it don't matter if it's Edom zoba Philistines it don't matter now for us whether it's depression or Pride right or lust or whatever isolation I was looking at I was like I preached five servants on that I forgot about that no matter what the the Temptation depression like I talked to your brother the brother Mike today no matter what it is as long as we're humble as long as we're trusting in Christ they cannot stand before us there's no enemy that can stand against us praise God if God's for me who can be against me praise God who convex you if you're humble and walking in obedience to Jesus Christ no one even Paul walking in the face of death said O Death where is your sting right oh great where is your victory even death staring death in the face church I hope that time goes on and I got to go to the Grave I hope that's the attitude I have when I'm facing death death where's your sting great where's your Victory and I hope by by God's grace if time goes on and we have to go beyond the current of time I hope I I hope you guys see me if I'm on my deathbed in the hospital I'm shaking people's hands like brother Bosworth or something like that I hope there's some Supernatural Vindication praise God hallelujah but look at that no matter where he went as long as he was humble he could have been a giant killer had he remained humble because that's what we got to do we have to remain humble right and then we'll be able to overcome the Giants that we Face whatever armies of the the armies of the devil that come against us will be able to overcome if we stay humble or go too long on that one remember David was better at obeying the word of God first Samuel 15 28 would you pull it up there first Samuel 15 28. let's just be honest Church there's people that are better at obeying the word of God than others right we're all saved by the same Grace but there are people who do a better job of showing appreciation and working for God right that's what we want to be amen and church you're not competing against other people you're competing against your worst enemy which is your sin nature I don't know does is there anyone in here a competitive person I am I am a sore loser I lose it in Scrabble I get mad I don't feel like going punch in a pillow or something like that a little bit wink wink but this is one way you can Channel your competitive nature that's what I do that's what my brother told me I I guess last Wednesday I said they tell me uh the devil come after me and say stop making videos who are you to uh who are you gonna share these quotes who are you to make this and I said if you don't like those I'll make I'll make against you devil I said that brother said you don't like the taste I'm gonna make more tape you can Channel competitive Spirit right does the Bible say we're supposed to run the race like we're the only one who's gonna win right I ran I ran a lot of races I won a lot of races in the natural I was very competitive so I wanted to be competitive I want to run the race for Christ so now now to overcome the devil and also my biggest enemy The Flesh of Jesse Smith that's the enemy I want to overcome right right I'll compete against him like I made him get up this morning at 5 30. get up you lazy bum just want to sleep in every day get up lazy bump s Hallelujah you'll sleep in tomorrow now we know the story of Saul he could have been a giant killer he could have been a king and everything went downhill when he didn't obey the word of God then he spent the think about that the golden years of his life he spent trying to kill David and he actually killed many of the priests he Mur he had them murdered the priests it'd be like it'd be like a Minister's meeting where he got like 50 ministers and Saul came in there and had him all killed just because they helped David and they didn't even know what was going on you talk about mental health issues you know that's a big saw at demonic mental health issues but Church the crazy thing is that the amazing thing is that by the end of his life he got free from it he got free he said David I'll hunt you no more he got free he forgave him right I'm sorry forgive him he repented he didn't have nothing to forgive sorry Saul repented of his sin his jealousy right because he heard the second saw his slaying his thousands and David and ten thousand and he got affect Spirit he got tormented by that Church it don't matter I want the churches to grow I want people to really get the Holy Ghost I don't care if I got a small church or a big church let's just be glad that Jesus saving Souls praise God Jesse saves one praise God the brother of preacher so-and-so saves a hundred Hallelujah brother answer just get if you can't get one say or he said if you can't get a lot saved just get one saved amen just try to get one Soul save praise God are you gonna try to do something for the kingdom of God and now let's see by the end you we know uh Samuel he thought he couldn't hear from God but the Bible makes it seem like he could have heard from God because the Bible says God killed him because he inquired of the witch of Endor and then remember Samuel came up and Samuel said you'll be with me tomorrow so he knew I got one more battle I'm gonna die in this battle but he's still amen he still fought the Lord's battles Hallelujah think about people that might have left the message or they're not they're not very strong in the message as long as they're fighting the Lord's battles that's what counts is that what Jesus some of that uh told his disciples oh they said we forbid this man to cast out devils and Jesus said let him go he said he's getting results let him let him cast out Devils if he's not against us he's for us if your family's not against you then they're for us praise God Hallelujah that encourages me go to second Samuel chapter one it's been a long time since I read this I read this today let's see what David sings by how many believe Dave was anointed with the Holy Ghost what did he say about Saul when Saul died remember this I love that song that that played how the Mighty Fall that's one of just a beautiful soul Saul was mighty when he was humble he couldn't be defeated Philistines soba they all fell before this man because he was humble he was anointed with the spirit of God hallelujah but then he thought he was better bigger stronger better than other people deserve more he wasted so many years guilty of murder verse 17 and David lamented with his lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son also he made them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher so if they had such an influence they taught them about the bow and arrow look at that they taught him how to war now what's that a type of it's it's a type of us learning how to quote the scriptures praise God right the bow wasn't a Bow Shoot Out an arrow brother man uh says Satan had a bow but no arrows in other words Satan lied and then he's got nothing else right he tells us lie that's all he's got is lies but we've got the word of God brother said it's like a slingshot even it hurts like a bow hallelujah it's the word hallelujah it's a mighty weapon Church how many believe it's a mighty weapon it's an absolute Mighty weapon let me just since I'm on this let me just stop right here and before I read that next the idea of the bow this brother Mike I met today who wrote read my book he got depressed and he got so depressed he was just totally depressed he went on medication and only hurt him um and finally he went to work and he worked at a gym where there's big strong guys and this one strong guy used to be a Christian but he wasn't anymore and he said and he said Mike he said he said your family okay he said yeah your son's okay yeah is your car working okay yeah he said then why are you so depressed you're supposed to be a Christian and that was the turning point he's like I gotta get rid of this but it took him like a year to get over the depression he realized I'm not living a Christian Life if this guy's a former Christian and he's calling me out for my depression I've got to overcome so he got back into church see you're in church Hallelujah and then he slowly got weaned off the medication and he said that demonic Spirit of depression would come back on him every day and you know what he did he didn't get out his phone he got out the Bible and he read Philippians 4 verse 6 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication make your requests known unto God with Thanksgiving and the peace of God will rule your heart right the peace that passes all understanding will keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ and he said he had to read that and once once he read it he said it the peace would come and it lasts for 15 minutes he said 15 minutes later that demon would come back on him and he had to go back and read the same verse until he felt peace he said he had to do that for like a week and then he could read the verse and it would last one hour and that lasted a few weeks and then he would read the verse and it would last all morning but then the demon would come back in the afternoon so you have to go back and pick up his Bible not his fellow Church his Bible I think that I thought that was an interesting thought and then it would just be once a day that demon would come on him to try to get him depressed and he would just go up and he said by that time I got the verses memorized right Hallelujah and then he said you know after a few months uh he said I'm doing this finally it was gone he said every now and then he'll come back on me but he said just go to my Bible in prayer I go to sing and I go to praising God look at that church you want to be free from a devil you want to be free from torment what do you got to do quote the word of God you really we really gotta mean it praise God if we want Victory there's victory for us Saul gave him bows Jonathan gave him bows brother random gave us both Amen brother and gave us powerful scriptures Hallelujah they're already in the Bible but he pointed them out let's use the Weaponry God has given to us praise God amen now let's finish what he said verse 19 the beauty of Israel is slaying upon thy high places how are the mighty Fallen so Saul was a beautiful person in God's eyes when he was forgiven I'm skipping down he said don't tell the enemies like in verse 20 21 verse 20 uh two from the blood of the slain from the fat of the Mighty the bow of Jonathan turned out back and the sort of Soul return not empty so Saul did get some victories he didn't defeat some people in the battle but ultimately remember he even fell on his own sword I tried to commit suicide he even failed in that now look at this verse 23 Saul Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than Lions now look at that Jonathan what was his heart his heart was knit to who Dave so Jonathan and David were in it together and then the Bible said Jonathan and Saul were knit together so see he had forgiven I'm sorry he had been forgiven he repented of his sins and now Saul Jonathan and David all their hearts were together as one so when he died he died with a honest heart he repented of his sins he was for Jonathan he wasn't going after David anymore praise God verse 24 you Daughters of Israel weep oversaw who clothed you in Scarlet with other Delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your power now look at this don't forget what the King has done for you no in other words God doesn't forget all your works of service church amen hallelujah David does I don't see one time David brings up he hunted me down and God pay him back for all the evil that he did for me he brings out all the good see what the Holy Spirit does Church the Holy Spirit forgives all of our trespasses that'll encourage us amen remember remember Abraham Abraham staggered not yet I could show you seven times he staggered but God said I've forgiven it all Abraham staggered not because of the Forgiveness of Christ so don't forget God's not going to forget what you've done for him verse 25 how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle oh Jonathan that was slain in nine high places I am distressed with thee my brother Jonathan very pleasant as thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished but see he could have been a giant killer but he couldn't even for many years he couldn't kill the giant of Pride within himself and disobeying the word of God he just thought well I don't have to obey all that I have to obey all the words that the pastor is preaching right for us do I really have to do all the commands of God to really have to do it all yes we want to because we want to show Jesus how much we love him praise God and now I'm going to get to my text now and I got 25 minutes while I'm an hour here okay so um we can see how Saul wasn't a giant killer but he wasn't Overcomer at the end of his life he wasn't overcomer he repented of his sins and the Holy Spirit records him as a Mighty Man is that right oh that reminds me that Mighty Man series I'm gonna have to go ahead go I can preach another sermon on that Saul was the mighty man I could go through all his battles he's a Mighty Man the mighty of Fallen Jonathan of course Mighty as well I want to I just want to close let me close with John the Baptist now brother man said this about John the Baptist he said why was he greater than all the prophets if you're a spiritual you'll catch something why was he the greatest all the other prophets had spoken of the Messiah but John introduced him he was the one that presented him now here's another good quote I just found this one today I hadn't heard this one before uh from that time 1961. of all that's ever been born of a woman there's not a greater man than John the Baptist yes sir what was it he received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb right now look what he says next he met God in his mother's womb amen he was changed his before he was born he was already changed now that's in it that's a very scriptural thought because the Bible said he got the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb that means his mind right could have been his soul because Jesus had not died for his sins we've been over that John 7 37-39 that's one of those major verses you got to remember when thinking about the Holy Ghost so that means John was given a new spirit because Ezekiel said new heart new spirit my spirit well he could not have repented yet right because he's a baby I've had eight babies and I've never seen him repent yet before they come out so what God had to do he had to wait on the new heart and God had to let his anointing be on his mind that's what the Bible said he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb mercy God had already changed him no wonder he was greater than David no wonder he was greater than Moses remember I said this before John the Baptist never murdered a man he never committed adultery he was a holy man why because he was changed from his mother's womb praise God this is what made him the greatest man in the Old Testament praise God no other man was like that as far as I know but see not only did it introduce Jesus but let me say this he also had the life to back it up in other words he lived a hold of your life than everybody else in the Old Testament and because he was the only one born with a new spirit the scripture is clear on this that was a fresh quote I never seen that before I can't wait to preach at other churches too they're really gonna like that one Luke chapter 1 verse 14. so I might have a part three on this we'll see I don't know I want to close about eight o'clock Luke 1 14. thank you for your patience sir and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he should be great in the sight of the Lord now this great how's he going to be great in the side lord well he's already got the Holy Ghost in his mind think about that let's just stop for a moment when was the last time hopefully it was today when was the last time your mind was boiling with the things of God's word I mean it's all you can think about all day like that brother I was telling talking to you today he said when he got saved he read the Bible in one week a church I've never read it that fast talk about boiling that's a lot of verses in one week so whatever so think of the time when your mind was most boiling you couldn't get enough of the word you just want to talk and pray and read about the Bible all the time listen to the sermons and that's what John had when he was born Hallelujah in the church said it's a holy ghost mind your mind is Anointed with the Holy Ghost that's all you can think about word the word Jesus love him how they worship praise that sacrifice that's all you think about it that was John see you see what you see what is great in the sight of God now Church how many members did he have in his home Church not many Hallelujah he had a little bit of a following but how long how long did his church uh last six months the greatest it just proves church God can put greatness in small things right right Jesus only preached for three and a half years this world I could not feel this room with the books of all the things that he did let alone this world Simon one time Marvel he said I can't leave Jesse you on that troll mystery book you have all those thoughts in your mind I'm like that's nothing I mean I respect assignment I love Simon you know but I'm just saying like yeah compare that to Jesus he's so great we can't none of us can even touch you I mean this whole world all the books about all the works all the service he did for the father Hallelujah talk about greatness what's greatness in the sight of the Lord having your mind Anointed with the Holy Ghost he show I'm sorry and and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink so look at that physical consecration so for the Holy Ghost Toll Brothers don't you smoke drink or do anything like that right same type of Nazarite vow uh what's interesting too brother was allowed to drink wine at Communion right to obey the word of God in other words don't drink wine or alcohol in a sinful manner okay right and he should be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children Lord of Israel shall he turns the Lord their God look he's going to win many Souls look at this he's going to win many Souls why is he so great he had God's mind he had an anointing on his mind all the time he won many people to the Lord his life was consecrated he wasn't he wasn't living like other people right we don't see him ever lie the only bad thing we see is once he's in prison he doubts his vision right are you the Messiah or do we look for another right that's the only thing we can see about John anybody think of anything else is I missed something in the scripture have I probably forgot something right that's probably what it was verse 17 here remember this because he fulfilled the first part of the Malachi four five and six prophecy he should go before him in the spirit and power be lying us to turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready of people prepared for the Lord the church remember he never did one miracle sister who he never raised the Dead Elijah did Elisha did he never told a lame man to walk right but he was still greater in God's sight than all those Old Testament prophets so now we can have a better understand what is greatness what does it mean to be great in the sight of the Lord in 2023. what does that mean someone who's anointed by the Holy Spirit praise God you try to turn people's hearts to the Lord go down to verse 76. great chapter here and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest for he should go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of the sins so why was he so great he was so dedicated he had his body disciplined right his mind was always about the things of God and he gave the people the word of God so they could repent they could make their own decision repent get their sins forgiven and get ready for Jesus many people he turned to the Lord this made him great oh it's beautiful look at verse uh look at verse 80. and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit and was in the desert to the day of his showing unto Israel did you catch that what he whacked strong in his What Spirit his mind wife thought he already had the Holy Ghost in his mind church he grew in his anointing and the church said he got greater more scripture more understanding more preaching this is a man that looked people in the face and said Europe your father the devil you are a brood of devils you are a brood of serpents who's going to warn you from going to hell in other words plead the wrath of God this man was not a this was the greatest man in the Old Testament did he kill any Giants that's the point I want to bring out was he a giant killer well it depends what you mean right I'm not trying to trick you Saints I'm not trying to catch anybody I'll say like this through the power of God he killed all the Temptations the giant Temptations in his flesh he was able to kill all those so yes he was a giant killer in one way but he didn't have all the other Miracles like everybody else now I can see I'm not going to be able to finish this thought here tonight let's read a few more uh Luke 3 3 Luke 3 3 since we're already in the wooden Loop and he came into all the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as is written the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying the word is prepare you the way of the Lord make us pass straight so this is this must be a great thing you're crying out to Sinners repent come get baptized God will forgive your sins now we get to do in the church right but this man was out there in the public doing it he's out there in the wilderness doing it he lifted up his Voice Hallelujah this is a great man the greatest man in the Old Testament but in Mark chapter 1 verse 2 Matthew Mark Luke as is written the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before Thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way the Lord make his path straight Hallelujah prepare the way of the Lord make his past right Hallelujah be prepared messiah's coming can I say like this get your lamps trimmed and clear Hallelujah Glory the Midnight Cry the bridegroom cometh go yet to meet him rise and trim your lands praise God the Lord is coming Hallelujah right it's the spirit of Elijah The Same Spirit The Same Spirit that called out for through John the Baptist now calls out through brother Brandon praise God rise and trim your Lambs get ready the Messiah is coming Hallelujah so I'm glad I was saying that laser song on Sunday Hallelujah rise and turn your lamps Church let's go to uh Matthew 3 verse 7. Matthew chapter 3 verse 7. I'm almost done now just says a little testimony I felt led to preach on uh Sunday night on peer pressure and little did I know that night one of my children had to overcome peer pressure and she overcame so I'm looking at it right now so everybody knows one of our friends come over just like the Holy Spirit just my thinking I didn't know what's going to happen but the the the the friend brought over a phone and said we need to listen to this or watch this is that right something like that what would you say the show what'd you say we'll give you two claps on Sunday night but she said it was hard I said that's exactly right overcoming sin and Temptation peer pressure is always hard but the more she keeps her mind on the word of God the greater Victory she's going to have if John the Baptist grew in his Spirit don't you think we'll grow in our spirit too right is that right he had the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb but look that anointing could grow as he grew Hallelujah three seven did I read that when he saw the many of the Pharisees and said she's come to this baptism he said to them oh my dear precious Brothers my lovely Brothers is that what he said laughs no he didn't give it a nice little welcome to them oh Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meat for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have brother Brandon as our father and just make it just make a breakdown to our day for I send you that God is able to of these stones to raise up children to Abraham and now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast in the fire think of that he was saying because you have crop root the ax is going to come and church when did it come 40 years later when Titus came the ax is going to be laid to the root of the tree they're going to be cut down they were all killed by Titus if they didn't die of a you know old age before that see God wasn't playing that this was an age this was a time I'm not God's not playing games but sea turtles again if God wants you to be like this like the brother and I were saying they've got you know sometimes Jesus got off the ropes you know when he peed out the temple other times he was so gentle when God wants you to be like that you'll be anointed to do it I did a video yesterday on the last Jeffersonville video and the brother texted me he said wow he said the fiery Indian nation of the Holy Ghost was on you and I said you're right it was I wasn't as nice on that video it just is indignation of the Holy Spirit I pray beforehand and sometimes when when God wants you to talk away he's going to have you praise God no I'm almost at clubs in here so let me uh try to find a place here to close uh let's close with this uh Matthew 23 11. foreign to where I wanted to get that's okay it was more of just like a Bible study here tonight at the 23 11 and 12. I hope you do 11 and 12. now Jesus tells us plainly what is greatness in God's sight is it a big church is it a millionaire uh has been able to memorize the Bible does it be able to write books no what is the what is greatness in God's sight serving other people so let's apply that to John the Baptist why was John the greatest he was the greatest servant is that right camera not like David and Moses he didn't serve his flesh you know he only served God's purpose that's what made him great and he only had public service for six months David Raine Church 40 years what is the percentage of that like it's not even half of one year half of one year is greater than 40 years and that don't even count the time all those years he defeated Goliath and before he was King and David was a man after God's Own Heart praise God the Baptist man maybe a man Anointed with the heart of God I don't know because he had it he was changed from his mother's womb that's going to stick with me for a few days here I might preach it tomorrow Junction City he was a changed person from his mother's womb brother Ram said God loved that Spirit of Elijah because it was so obedient to the word of God that's why he uses it again and again praise God whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a base and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted praise God so we're not all giant Killers but we're all Overcomers so as I close tonight what is God asking you and I to overcome tonight or as I said last week is there something that's been a giant problem for you this week that God would like you to overcome it's very simple to see how it's going to happen like with Saul or anyone else we've got to repent and anything we've done wrong we've got to Humble ourselves it's humility defeats every enemy we see that in Saul's life because what is humility again it's not saying oh I'm nothing I'm so weak I'm nobody humility is saying God I'm taking your way not mine Satan loves that when we said oh I'm so weak I'm the weakest Christian I'm the uh I'm the weakest link in the church Satan just loves that that's not humility humility is saying Jesus forgive me now I'm going to obey your word that's the Simplicity of humility I'm taking your way instead of my way how many believe that it has to be so simple God hides himself in Simplicity praise God even a fool Isaiah 35 will not air in this way of the King's Highway of Holiness the way of holiness if John could do that in six months of ministry and he could be the greatest by being changed well then we can surely we can look up to God and say Lord change me tonight change me tonight musician's gonna come let's stay in the working it always comes out different than I thought I thought I'd get a lot further than that but I trust you were blessed tonight praise God church we want to be great fruit producing Christians we we don't want to argue and debate we're greater than whatever age we should care less about that but what we should desire is Lord I want to bring forth great fruit for your name right Jesus said the father is glorified more when we bring forth fruit unto God much fruit unto God well how do I get fruit I gotta weed out all the bad things in my life I gotta humble myself and be a servant to others let's buy our heads let's take a moment think about our lives here [Music] is there anything in our lives tonight that needs changed change made all the difference in John the Baptist life Saul's life as long as he was humble he vexed the enemy [Music] the church as long as we're humble as long as we're serving others we can overcome the kingdom of darkness as we walk in the Kingdom of Light the kingdom of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we'll be thanking for these scriptures we've heard tonight Lord God [Music] starting to need to see all those scriptures about Saul could have been a giant killer could have and left fear get in the way you let pride get in the way he let Disobedience get in the way he let rebellious heart get in the Wind Lord please Lord there's any rebellion in our hearts if there's any pride in our hearts God forgive us here tonight Lord God we want to be Victorious on every side everywhere we turn everything our hand touches we want to see you bless it make it Prosper Lord God [Music] God we want to be like John as much as possible we want to be used in a great way Lord God and we know it's not by money necessarily or Miracles necessarily but it's by fulfilling your will for our lives by being changed having a heart to obey the word of God warning people sharing about salvation giving them knowledge of the word of God Lord I didn't get tonight but Lord you said that Widow in two mites which was three-eighths of one cent not even half a second she gave more than all the other Rich church goers because she gave all she had Lord we know you're looking at our hearts you're looking at the percentage of what we have that we give Lord as we leave here sometime soon and tomorrow maybe remember what greatness is he shall be great in the sight of the Lord for he shall turn many people to the Lord he shall live a discipline and physical life Hallelujah maybe a voice crying in the wilderness prepare you the way the Lord prepare your hearts to be God granted Lord Jesus we can be changed Lord God thank you Lord as I was able to share about your message today with our brother Mike Lord I love those moments I just pray you give me more you see it's too far and few between Lord Gods we've got to pray give me more opportunities to share your love with other people Lord of God we thank you Lord God for your mercy and your grace these are precious times you get to talk it over lord God search our hearts May the spirit of God grow in our minds like John the Baptist he grew in the spirit he grew in power of the Holy Spirit and our minds just be so consume with the word of God that's how I felt today Lord God so many great scriptures we thank you Lord God for tonight deal with your people Lord as only you can in Jesus Christ amen [Music] [Music] life is worth the living [Music]
