[29:59] verse 1 Matthew Matthew chapter 4 verse
[30:11] 1 it's good to be in house the Lord with
[30:13] everyone we're thankful for another week
[30:16] of God's grace I like to look at
[30:21] biblical numerology this morning and
[30:24] then tonight we'll look at God's purpose
[30:26] tonight look at times and seasons I just
[30:28] kind of felt you're not gonna be wrong
[30:30] the Holy Spirit can take a sermon any
[30:31] way he wants I just kind of felt like I
[30:34] deal with this one this morning and then
[30:36] look at times and seasons tonight are
[30:39] you looking forward to communion praise
[30:41] the Lord amen the Lord's Supper praise
[30:43] God it's a showdown right it tells where
[30:47] we stand with God amen whether we take
[30:51] it right or take it wrong or don't take
[30:53] it at all one of those three shows where
[30:55] we stand so we want to we want to stand
[30:57] in truth we want to stand with pure
[30:58] hearts praise God Matthew chapter 4
[31:01] verse 1 then was Jesus led up of the
[31:05] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[31:10] of the devil
[31:11] so God allows this temptation a 40-day
[31:15] temptation we'll look at the number 40
[31:17] this morning and when he had fasted 40
[31:20] days and 40 nights he was afterward and
[31:22] hungered and when the tempter came to
[31:25] him he said if thou be the Son of God
[31:27] command that these stones be made
[31:30] bread let's all read verse four if we
[31:33] can on three ready one two three but he
[31:37] answered and said it is written man
[31:40] shall not live by bread alone but by
[31:43] every word that proceedeth out of the
[31:45] mouth of God let's have a word of Prayer
[31:47] let's bow our heads and ask the Lord one
[31:49] more time if you ever need on your heart
[31:50] make it known unto God let's ask God to
[31:52] minister he promised to be here we feel
[31:54] his presence and we just must humble
[31:57] ourselves here this morning Heavenly
[31:59] Father we do humble ourselves father
[32:02] were nothing you're the only great one
[32:05] amongst us Lord God we're gathering here
[32:07] because you taught us Lord you commanded
[32:09] us to gather more as we see that day
[32:11] approaching you commanded us to preach
[32:12] your word
[32:13] Paul gathered with the Saints on the
[32:15] first day of the week he preached he had
[32:17] communion he taught the Saints the Word
[32:19] of God and so father we patterned
[32:21] ourselves after this book of Acts Lord
[32:23] and we asked Oh God it the same God who
[32:25] anointed Paul Lord God would anoint me
[32:28] and each every person today Lord - to do
[32:31] what you've called us to do Lord God
[32:33] that we might be edified that we might
[32:34] be strengthened Lord God that we might
[32:37] be fed spiritual food Lord for this time
[32:40] and season of our lives prepare our
[32:42] hearts for communion Lord may this
[32:43] sermon Lord as well as tonight Lord this
[32:46] time of worship may Lord each time be
[32:49] Lord another time to feast at your table
[32:51] to commune with you to talk it all over
[32:53] to hear your word Lord God and hear what
[32:56] you'd say to us to speak to you Lord and
[32:58] listen to you speak back Lord no doubt
[33:01] we've said prayers this week or maybe
[33:02] this year Lord or I don't know Lord the
[33:06] time that we prayed it but we know Lord
[33:08] this could be the time you can answer
[33:09] Lord back to us Lord God so let's hear
[33:12] your voice this morning through your
[33:14] word and we ask it all in Jesus Christ's
[33:16] name and the church said Amen god bless
[33:18] you to be in ct2 praise the Lord so like
[33:23] to look at just the number 40 this
[33:24] morning I believe that's as far as we'll
[33:26] get and then Lord willing tonight we'll
[33:30] look at times and seasons those 14 times
[33:33] and seasons that we all go through by
[33:37] God's grace so I have do have some
[33:40] quotes I like to share in some
[33:41] scriptures help us understand
[33:44] we kind of ended Wednesday night with 40
[33:47] we just started 40 and we kind of looked
[33:50] at quoting the word how brother branham
[33:53] talked about that so I just want to
[33:54] start back up with that and then see
[33:56] where the Lord will will take us here by
[33:58] His grace so we read our text and
[34:01] there's a couple meanings here 40 could
[34:06] mean temptation or like a test that God
[34:09] allows of course we can't have one
[34:11] except God allows it and we can't have
[34:13] one that's more than we can bear it has
[34:15] to be a test that we can handle by God's
[34:17] grace and in every test God makes a way
[34:20] of escape
[34:21] there's always an exit sign right
[34:23] there's always a way out if we just seek
[34:26] God for it amen so we also know it means
[34:30] rest and that's what kind of look at
[34:33] maybe maybe we'll get close to that at
[34:36] the end and then 40 kameena generation
[34:39] by the grace of Lord as well
[34:42] so I like to just pick up where we left
[34:44] off on Wednesday night the brother
[34:47] Graham said this is the evening
[34:48] messenger I'm gonna skip down here we're
[34:49] familiar with some of these he said he's
[34:51] perfected in in threes five is number of
[34:54] grace seven is number worship 12 so the
[34:58] word number worship 12:40 is a number of
[35:01] persecution so we'll see a little bit of
[35:03] that today from the scripture out 40 can
[35:06] mean persecution and then we'll see how
[35:09] he says here and serves we would see
[35:10] Jesus 40 is temptation 50 is Jubilee and
[35:16] he says you know the mathematics of the
[35:18] scripture do you know better now I hope
[35:20] you know better by the grace of Lord
[35:22] mathematics now so we saw here the Bible
[35:28] said he fasted for 40 days 40 nights he
[35:31] was to be tempted by the devil
[35:33] so God ordained that Jesus his son would
[35:37] go out into wilderness and just be kind
[35:39] of alone and fellowship with with God
[35:41] the spirit we'd say the flesh
[35:44] fellowshipping with the spirit for 40
[35:46] days in order to be prepared for the
[35:49] temptation right so it's 40 days of
[35:54] tests 40 days of
[35:56] being alone with God to face this mighty
[36:01] temptation and isn't it Church isn't it
[36:03] encouraging to know that the strongest
[36:07] devil you'll ever face can be defeated
[36:10] by quoting the Word of God we're not
[36:13] encouraging you you're never gonna face
[36:15] a demon stronger than Satan right
[36:18] because he's the chief he's the Prince
[36:21] of demons the Prince of Darkness
[36:24] you're never gonna face one greater it's
[36:27] comforting to know that no matter what
[36:30] you face no matter if you face even
[36:33] seven demons no matter if you face a
[36:36] legion of demons no matter what you face
[36:39] they can all be swiftly defeated if you
[36:44] just stand behind God's Word quote God's
[36:47] Word and you don't act upon anything
[36:49] sinful if you just walk in the spirit
[36:52] God will wit be with you he'll deliver
[36:55] you and he'll let you see what it's like
[36:57] to be more than a conqueror amen just
[37:01] standing behind the protection of God's
[37:03] word just using the shield of Revelation
[37:06] and using the word of as a weapon to
[37:09] attack and say it is written that the
[37:11] weakest Christian will be able to defeat
[37:15] any demon the same way Jesus did just
[37:18] upon the basis of God's Word what a
[37:24] privilege we have this morning - to see
[37:27] the power of the word spoken and
[37:32] remember Jesus was freshly filled with
[37:35] the Holy Ghost amen
[37:36] Alleluia he wasn't just sanctified he
[37:39] wasn't just justified he was freshly
[37:42] filled with the Holy Ghost and God was
[37:45] showing him the way to overcome
[37:47] temptation forty days here of waiting
[37:51] and forty days of separation from his
[37:53] disciples that wouldn't it be soon meet
[37:55] his disciples forty days and all of this
[37:59] all the trials and tests and everything
[38:01] would be able to be conquered God was
[38:04] showing this then this lesson before his
[38:06] ministry so that he could be successful
[38:09] in his ministry
[38:10] amen and you and I learn same thing when
[38:13] we get born again by the Holy Spirit God
[38:15] will teach us quickly right away
[38:18] that every battle can be won by quoting
[38:21] the word and that will prepare us for
[38:23] our ministry amen because the Bible said
[38:28] Satan left not forever just for a season
[38:31] so this was a season for Jesus to be
[38:34] born again right he got baptized and
[38:37] then a season of testing which we'll get
[38:39] to Lord willing later tonight there's a
[38:42] time to be tested there there's a time
[38:45] to cast away right and gather that
[38:48] there's a time for this so the time came
[38:50] he was born again we'd say at the River
[38:53] Jordan and then a testing season came
[38:56] and we wouldn't really think about it in
[38:59] that order but that's the order God gave
[39:01] to his son Jesus amen I don't know he as
[39:04] soon as he's born now test him see if
[39:08] what he received was the real thing and
[39:10] that's why you are you and I can rejoice
[39:12] when we overcome a test and we come out
[39:15] victorious on the other end and we
[39:17] didn't fall and we didn't go back to the
[39:19] world we can rejoice and say that yes
[39:21] this test proved what I received was
[39:25] deity Amen hallelujah this test that I
[39:29] just went through proved that what I
[39:31] received was the genuine inoculation the
[39:35] genuine power of Almighty God amen
[39:38] and that's what God allowed Christ to
[39:40] see that what he received was the
[39:44] genuine inoculation was deity Amen
[39:47] hallelujah
[39:48] and all it took was just squirting the
[39:52] Lord and not not giving into the flesh
[39:55] but walking in the spirit because Jesus
[39:58] was now under the law of the Spirit see
[40:02] you and I are going to live under one
[40:04] law one or the other the look at the
[40:06] curse of the law of the letter or the
[40:09] law of the holy spirit because listen if
[40:13] people don't receive the law of the Holy
[40:15] Spirit if they won't live under the law
[40:18] of the Holy Spirit then they'll be
[40:19] condemned that they're at the white
[40:21] throne judgment you're going to choose
[40:23] you
[40:24] we're going to choose to live under one
[40:25] law the other the letter or the spirit
[40:27] let live under the spirit so go to
[40:31] Romans and I'll prove with you Romans 8
[40:33] go to there you're gonna live under one
[40:36] law of the other and this is the law
[40:40] Jesus was obeying the law of the Holy
[40:43] Spirit Romans 8 and remember what did
[40:51] Paul say he said on that day when God
[40:53] will judge men by the secrets of their
[40:55] hearts according to my gospel memory
[40:58] said that see everyone's going to be
[41:00] judged by law
[41:01] it's either the law of the letter which
[41:04] is ah I better do this out of fear I
[41:06] better do I better do this because I
[41:08] know it's right but they really don't
[41:10] want to or they're gonna be judged by
[41:15] the law of the Holy Spirit that they
[41:17] said they accepted the Holy Spirit and
[41:19] then if the Holy Spirit guide them amen
[41:21] either they fight against the Holy
[41:23] Spirit I'll do it myself or I guess I
[41:25] have to do this the the letter or the
[41:27] spirit but the Spirit gives life amen
[41:31] because there is life a little yeah
[41:33] thank you Lord amen
[41:36] Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no
[41:39] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[41:40] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[41:42] after the spirit so this is what Jesus
[41:45] was doing he was leaving the wit of the
[41:48] the the baptism when Jordan got the Holy
[41:50] Ghost and now he's gonna walk in the
[41:53] spirit I mean oh the Bible said he just
[41:55] the bottom just said he was led of the
[41:56] spear in the wilderness ha ha ha amen
[42:00] so as soon as he got the Holy Ghost the
[42:02] spirit led him to be tested and tempted
[42:05] and tried to see to prove to him that
[42:08] what he received was the right thing
[42:11] amen the dove he received the purity and
[42:16] the sweetness of the dev of God's
[42:18] leadership amen
[42:20] so look at verse 2 isn't this striking
[42:25] the law makes you free so when you worry
[42:28] when you walk under the law of the
[42:29] Spirit it makes you free from sin and
[42:31] death over Jesse you're preaching the
[42:35] law again yes I am the law of the holy
[42:37] we're not the law of the letter like
[42:40] brother bang you better do all these
[42:41] things if not you're going to hell if
[42:44] you don't do all these things remember
[42:46] they're 613 Old Testament laws if you
[42:48] don't keep all these 613 laws you're
[42:50] you're lost but the Bible said that's
[42:52] true if you live under the under the law
[42:55] right the Bible said your curse if you
[42:57] don't do all of them but see the Spirit
[43:01] teaches us that Jesus paid for our curse
[43:04] so that requirement that 613 commandment
[43:10] was nailed to the cross amen
[43:12] oh yeah the Bible said he nailed it to
[43:15] his cross and Christ took the curse of
[43:18] the law for us and then offers us the
[43:21] law of the Holy Spirit she here to take
[43:24] the ruling of the letter or you'll take
[43:26] the bullying of God's Spirit amen oh and
[43:29] let's accept the Holy Spirit amen
[43:30] because that gives us life to live this
[43:33] word and live by love and not live by
[43:36] law hallelujah or guilt can I say like
[43:40] that maybe that'd be better we don't
[43:42] live by guilt we live by love because
[43:44] we're falling in love with Jesus all the
[43:46] time that's right see look at verse 2
[43:50] Romans 8:2 for the law of the spirit of
[43:53] life where's it at where is this law of
[43:56] the Holy Spirit it's in Christ see it's
[44:00] a law hath made me free from the law of
[44:03] sin and death so this law or this
[44:08] policeman we say Jesus the policeman set
[44:11] me free from the law that had me in
[44:13] bondage so you and I were tied up in
[44:15] bondage we couldn't keep the word slave
[44:17] to our sins just in bondage to sin but
[44:21] then the law or the higher our or the
[44:24] policeman Christ come by and loosed us
[44:27] from that and now under the law of Jesus
[44:29] amen now under the law of the Holy
[44:32] Spirit and he's made us free or the
[44:35] power say like that now under the power
[44:37] of the Holy Spirit not the power of sin
[44:40] does that help this morning see you're
[44:44] under the law you're going to be judged
[44:46] by the law the law of the Holy Spirit
[44:48] some people
[44:50] like that word but it's a Bible word so
[44:52] may God help us to grow up and mature by
[44:54] God's grace me too all of us look at
[44:58] verse 3 for what the law could not do in
[45:00] that it was weak through the flesh God
[45:03] sending his own son in the likeness of
[45:04] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[45:07] in the flesh that the righteous of the
[45:09] law might be prepared in us see who
[45:14] won't not after the flesh but after the
[45:15] spirit teachers there's something out
[45:18] you and I we can read that Old Testament
[45:20] and we say my so righteous is so holy
[45:23] and in our own flesh we can't keep it
[45:27] but with God's power
[45:29] God gives us power in the anointing to
[45:32] fulfill the righteous part of it amen
[45:36] killing animals is no longer righteous
[45:40] hallelujah but honoring your father and
[45:43] mother is still righteous are you with
[45:46] me hallelujah so God gives us gives us
[45:50] the Holy Spirit now he gives it to us
[45:52] that we can fulfill all the
[45:54] righteousness of God by grace and it's
[45:58] no longer us because I'm not doing it by
[46:00] the flesh yep the spirit amen hallelujah
[46:05] that's why we serve God since I came to
[46:08] the message not by my flesh but by the
[46:10] love of God by the spirit and law of the
[46:14] Holy Spirit amen praise God is it a
[46:18] fight yes in the next chapter of the
[46:20] previous chapter Paul says a wretched
[46:22] man that I am it's a fight there's a
[46:24] part of you that's wretched that you
[46:26] have to make it obey but once you
[46:28] finally get out of the flesh and you
[46:30] start walking the spirit then it's a joy
[46:32] to walk in the spirit there's a joy to
[46:34] obey the laws of God it's a joy to live
[46:37] righteously when you're walking in the
[46:39] spirit but the flesh doesn't like to do
[46:42] that so we got to stay in the walking in
[46:44] step with the Holy Spirit and not walk
[46:47] in the flesh that's right Church that's
[46:51] Romans 8:1 through 4 so see you're under
[46:57] the law
[46:59] and I hope that's plain that's what
[47:02] Jesus walked on that's why Jesus could
[47:05] do this he walked in the spirit he
[47:07] walked into a temptation right he walked
[47:13] right into kinda like Elijah walked
[47:14] right into that
[47:15] that army that wasn't arrest him they
[47:17] say where's Elijah he said I'll take you
[47:19] to him right he walked right into danger
[47:22] and he didn't fear like the four Hebrew
[47:25] children they walked right up there and
[47:27] they're gonna walk right into the fire
[47:29] they didn't fear why cuz they were
[47:31] walking in righteousness amen they were
[47:34] walking in obedience and when you and I
[47:36] walk into any situation or any meeting
[47:39] or any trial or any test as long as role
[47:42] banging the Holy Spirit we're walking in
[47:45] power we're walking in righteousness and
[47:47] we have nothing to fear because God is
[47:49] with us because we know God will always
[47:52] backup somebody who walks in the Holy
[47:55] Spirit oh that's right church amen
[47:59] now since we're in Romans go back to
[48:01] Romans 2 I think it's 16 or 17 that just
[48:09] came to me again yeah
[48:13] now let's read 15 Romans 2:15 which show
[48:18] the work of the law written in their
[48:19] hearts now Paul's talking about heathen
[48:21] Gentiles God has written the law in
[48:25] their consciences so any native group
[48:29] you go to any Aborigines or anyone that
[48:32] never heard the gospel no matter which
[48:34] group you go to God already wrote right
[48:36] and wrong in their hearts it's already
[48:39] there that's because no man is without
[48:41] excuse Paul says in the previous chapter
[48:43] chapter 1 everyone has to answer because
[48:46] God already put it in their hearts to
[48:48] know their conscience also bearing
[48:51] witness see they have a witness and
[48:53] their thoughts the meanwhile excusing or
[48:56] else excusing one another right oh this
[48:59] is right for you or it's not rot right
[49:00] it's wrong for you see the excuse are
[49:03] they pardon one another now look at
[49:04] verse 16 in the depth you and God shall
[49:06] judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[49:09] according to my good news name
[49:12] my gospel see God has to judge by
[49:16] something and he judges by the Lord so
[49:19] the Holy Spirit that wrote this word is
[49:21] the law that we must live by because
[49:25] everybody's going to be judged by a law
[49:27] book right you get in trouble with the
[49:29] law you're going to be judged by Ohio's
[49:31] Revised Code and you can look it up
[49:34] online if you want to know the Revised
[49:36] Code and all the laws are C dot zero
[49:40] zero five six dot whatever you know you
[49:42] can look it all up well god is the same
[49:44] thing he has a lot of judges by and it's
[49:47] his word but it was inspired by the Holy
[49:49] Spirit so we walk by the law of the
[49:53] Spirit all right that's a good start
[49:58] dear hope that's a help to you by God's
[50:00] grace that was just quicken to me a few
[50:01] weeks ago about we are all under a law
[50:03] whether we like it or not now think
[50:06] about the natural you're governed by the
[50:07] laws of gravity yeah you'd like to fly
[50:10] you know it'd be nice you know for vang
[50:12] to fly back home and you'd have to you
[50:14] know go on a plane you could just run
[50:16] and jump across the you know the Pacific
[50:19] Ocean or Atlantic Ocean go home to Laos
[50:21] or something like that it'd be nice but
[50:23] we're all governed by laws and if we're
[50:26] governed by laws in the natural even
[50:29] more so the spiritual because that
[50:31] dimension is more real than this one
[50:33] amen hallelujah amen
[50:39] now remember but man said Jesus was
[50:41] tempted above any man that can ever be
[50:43] tempted so you will never have a test as
[50:45] hard as this would earnest test right
[50:49] that's what program says the 40 days of
[50:52] temptation in that temptation it was the
[50:55] hardest temptation any man's been
[50:59] tempted I wonder about the gardener
[51:01] guess 72 I wonder that's interesting I
[51:04] never thought about that till now he
[51:07] says now look in Jesus said if you abide
[51:08] in me my words on you you're back to the
[51:11] word again the word of promise he
[51:12] walking in the law of the Spirit walking
[51:15] in the holy spirit fulfilling the
[51:16] righteous of the holy spirit doing the
[51:18] right things now I'm just going to skip
[51:21] because if I would preach on that now
[51:23] let's move
[51:24] now let's look at some 40s here Noah
[51:28] endured the forty days of rain right the
[51:31] bottom said the rain was upon the earth
[51:32] forty days and forty nights now Church I
[51:36] like our program said this he says he
[51:37] had to endure which means this was the
[51:40] test for Noah think about it it's a test
[51:44] for you and there's a storm outside and
[51:47] wonder if my power is gonna go out or
[51:48] let's say your power does go out that's
[51:50] a test for you isn't it last year my
[51:52] basements are leaking that was a test
[51:54] for me I didn't stay up to almost 3:00
[51:56] a.m. with my shot back in there mmm fill
[52:00] it all up and then take it outside right
[52:01] away knowing that it's just all flooding
[52:03] back in load after load after load it's
[52:07] a test we must endure the test because
[52:10] something is going to come after the
[52:13] test look at by themselves why does God
[52:16] let troubles come god harnesses trouble
[52:19] puts bits in his mouth I like that and
[52:22] makes it obey Him hey sorry whatever
[52:27] test God has allowed you to go through
[52:29] it was God making that test obey Him so
[52:33] God had to allow it and those troubles
[52:37] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[52:40] God if you stop and think about a church
[52:43] any trial you've gone through will
[52:45] ultimately draw you closer to Christ
[52:47] you'll make it far more love with Jesus
[52:49] alright that's what everyone everywhere
[52:52] every fire will produce gold eventually
[52:55] right if you put gold and miry clay to
[52:57] put it all together hey whatever it
[52:59] whatever fired it you keep it in there
[53:01] long enough gold is going to come forth
[53:05] so any test will bring you closer to God
[53:08] because remembered although the Bible
[53:10] said about Jesus the Bible said that
[53:13] only suffering comes obedience amen
[53:17] right so we want to obey the spirit we
[53:20] want to walk in the spirit so God has to
[53:23] allow tests to teach us to walk in the
[53:25] law the spirit a very to not live in the
[53:29] flesh God has to allow trials so that
[53:32] we'll choose to walk through obedience
[53:34] the next time praise God
[53:37] that
[53:38] right I love this look at that look what
[53:40] he says about Noah
[53:41] there had been no rainbow till the flood
[53:44] came you like that I don't want to see
[53:48] God's rainbow honey one to see God's
[53:49] covenant but after Noah was pressed into
[53:52] that condition that he was in to float
[53:55] 40 days and nights in the storm and the
[53:57] little Ark pitching up and down the
[53:58] water it was after the flood was over
[54:01] that he saw the rainbow for its first
[54:03] time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant
[54:06] of promise went through the tribulation
[54:09] then he saw the promise that's the way
[54:12] you see the promise after you've gone
[54:15] through the tribulation amen see Church
[54:19] you will see you will see hope you will
[54:22] see God's promise you will see God's
[54:25] everlasting covenant if you can just
[54:28] make it through the 40 days amen is that
[54:32] right you can just make it through the
[54:35] trial the current trial that you're
[54:37] going through this 40-day test if you
[54:40] can just make it through here God will
[54:42] show you the great hope that's to come
[54:46] hallelujah
[54:47] Oh God give me grace to make it through
[54:49] the storm
[54:50] give me grace to hold on amen
[54:53] give me grace not to doubt the Ark that
[54:57] we're floating in can I say like that
[54:59] give me grace not to be discouraged by
[55:02] the rains falling and the darkness it
[55:06] seem like I'm just drifting know about
[55:09] it felt like he was drifted all that is
[55:11] he was in the hand of God the whole time
[55:13] hahaha he was drifting but he never left
[55:16] God he hand hallelujah amen and if he
[55:22] could just endure for 40 days and 40
[55:24] nights he sees a hope eventually now it
[55:27] wasn't even after the 40 days right he
[55:30] didn't see the Covenant after the 40
[55:32] days because then the waters had to
[55:33] recede then he had to come out then he
[55:37] had to sacrifice then he saw the rainbow
[55:41] oh my aren't you glad Church God will be
[55:45] with us what do we need we need strength
[55:47] we need hope we need courage we need
[55:49] endurance we need per survey
[55:51] to keep pressing through the trial
[55:53] because God promised if we can just get
[55:56] through the tribulation then we'll see
[55:58] the promise fulfilled Oh beautiful
[56:04] that's the way you see it - amen that's
[56:07] where you see it go through the
[56:09] tribulation and after you've gone
[56:11] through that sister Wendy then you see
[56:13] God's promise that's right
[56:15] but you must endure the temptation first
[56:20] Moses was in the Mount to receive the
[56:23] law forty days is that right a type of
[56:27] Christ and then did you know afterwards
[56:34] when he saw Israel make the molten calf
[56:38] he fell down before God forty more days
[56:43] and that's striking the Bible said
[56:47] you've been rebellious against the Lord
[56:49] from the day that I knew you well
[56:51] whatever huh you've been a rebellious
[56:55] congregation since the day you came to
[56:57] church
[56:58] I don't want God to tell me that thus I
[57:02] fell down before the Lord forty days and
[57:04] forty nights as I fell down at the first
[57:08] because the Lord had said he would
[57:11] destroy you
[57:12] amen so he went to lay before the Lord
[57:15] for forty more days to intercede for
[57:19] those who have fallen into sin the first
[57:22] time he laid forty days was to receive
[57:25] the word the next forty days was the
[57:28] help the people that couldn't receive
[57:30] the word and God help us to see that we
[57:33] need to do the same thing we need to get
[57:35] God's Word and then we need to intercede
[57:37] for those who rejected God's Word but a
[57:42] period of tests both were a period a
[57:45] time period of tests we must be tested
[57:48] and wait for the word and there must be
[57:51] testing and wait or to intercede that
[57:53] God may have mercy on others that's
[57:58] beautiful so God uses 40 days to show
[58:02] this test or
[58:03] temptation now look it's a temptation
[58:05] right I think we preached on this last
[58:06] Sunday I mentioned it Sunday Sunday
[58:09] night after her brother David preached
[58:11] it's a it's a temptation to give up on
[58:14] our loved ones and it could have been a
[58:17] temptation Moses could have given up
[58:20] remember God Church God even offered him
[58:22] he said I'll kill off everybody else and
[58:24] then I'll start a nation out of you
[58:26] Moses look how God tests him look how
[58:32] that would have sounds so good to his
[58:33] flesh oh well I have been a pretty good
[58:35] guy maybe him
[58:36] maybe the Moses tribe would be a good
[58:38] tribe what it says
[58:42] look how God will test you right God
[58:47] told Abraham take your son and kill him
[58:50] what
[58:52] loving God human sacrifice God said it
[58:57] in order to test him to see if he'd obey
[58:59] God never wanted Isaac to be killed like
[59:01] that but he said something so outrageous
[59:04] to test them to see if they would obey
[59:07] his word and then God said now I know
[59:09] that you love me more than the gifts
[59:11] that I gave you oh god help us to do the
[59:14] same
[59:14] maybe we love God more than the gifts
[59:17] that he's given to us or the external
[59:20] blessings may God help us God to have a
[59:23] heart that loved you for who you are
[59:25] your word your righteousness your
[59:27] holiness your character may God give us
[59:30] Grace and love him no matter what he
[59:32] gives or takes away in this carnal realm
[59:34] but to love the law of the Spirit to
[59:37] love his holy presence amen so he stood
[59:45] in the gap he said no
[59:49] said remember he even said blot my name
[59:51] off instead of theirs Lord God and he
[59:55] did it he didn't do for one day church
[59:56] like we do he did it for 40 days that's
[1:00:00] why I said last week god help us to
[1:00:01] confess salvation for our family members
[1:00:03] keep confessing keep believing don't
[1:00:07] doubt it don't don't give up right god
[1:00:11] help us God's testing us to see if will
[1:00:13] believe in pray hallelujah like Abraham
[1:00:16] prayed for a lot right God's looking to
[1:00:18] see if we will obey the Word of God if
[1:00:21] will intercede or not
[1:00:25] so Moses fell down 40 more days to
[1:00:29] intercede for God's people another test
[1:00:32] and God wants to test us are willing to
[1:00:36] pray or willing to wait to see if
[1:00:38] everyone the church will be saved if all
[1:00:41] of our family are willing to wait long
[1:00:43] enough are willing to intercede and let
[1:00:46] God move remember Church even God told
[1:00:49] Ezekiel he said go make a dumb cake and
[1:00:52] eat it and that was unclean and God let
[1:00:56] him do that because it wasn't as a
[1:00:59] dietary thing it was as a sign for the
[1:01:02] for the rest of Israel wait with me
[1:01:05] God will sometimes ask outrageous things
[1:01:08] but we must know why he's doing it now
[1:01:11] that doesn't give us a license say well
[1:01:14] I can break the word that doesn't give
[1:01:16] us a license for that but it goes to
[1:01:19] show that God will test us sometimes in
[1:01:21] great powerful may be hard to understand
[1:01:25] ways but he's looking to see if we'll go
[1:01:28] through the temptation and honor him and
[1:01:30] not say anything bad against him he's
[1:01:32] purifying us that we might come out
[1:01:34] better on the other end look oh man
[1:01:42] about Moses and oh how his work how he
[1:01:45] was a lawgiver went up in the mountains
[1:01:47] and stayed 40 days come back out with
[1:01:49] the law and he said his be setting sin
[1:01:53] was temper you you know anybody like
[1:01:55] that you say one thing ah they blow up
[1:02:01] in your face that was Moses pastor Moses
[1:02:07] Khan shoot what do you mean ask me a
[1:02:09] question so sometimes we can be thankful
[1:02:15] that some people have different miss
[1:02:17] etting sins right praise the Lord and
[1:02:22] guess what so is the poorest temptation
[1:02:26] herba setting sin was tempered to write
[1:02:28] his mother answered they had many
[1:02:29] arguments in the wilderness imagine me
[1:02:32] married to someone who has the same
[1:02:34] besetting sin as you he broke the
[1:02:38] commandment he went back up showing that
[1:02:41] the priests and must die must pass away
[1:02:44] just as Jesus went the wilderness for
[1:02:46] forty days when he came out Jesus Satan
[1:02:48] met him just in his weak spot yo Jesus
[1:02:52] had a weak spot where was his weak spot
[1:02:55] the same thing yours is your flesh his
[1:02:59] weak spot was hunger he said if that
[1:03:03] would be the son of God command these
[1:03:04] stones to be turned to bread and he said
[1:03:06] it is written oh god help us amen church
[1:03:09] may God show us our weak spots this
[1:03:11] morning that we might take the Word of
[1:03:13] God and fight Satan off our weak spots
[1:03:16] then it becomes a strong spot Amen
[1:03:19] that's the point of this that's why
[1:03:21] numerology give me a good sermon to
[1:03:22] write it doesn't matter it's all God's
[1:03:27] inspired Lord and so this is what God
[1:03:30] wants us to do we know Satan is going to
[1:03:34] come to our weak spot so we've got to
[1:03:36] build up word we got to have word
[1:03:38] prepared when he comes that weak spot
[1:03:43] you might remember this but when I first
[1:03:46] came in the message I could not stop
[1:03:47] chewing tobacco does anybody remember my
[1:03:49] story on that so I didn't even know it
[1:03:51] but I just I found a picture of a guy
[1:03:53] who lost his whole cheek have his cheek
[1:03:56] - chewing tobacco
[1:03:56] and I wrote this scripture on it and I
[1:03:58] quoted it all the time
[1:04:00] first Corinthians 6:12 all things are
[1:04:02] lawful unto me but all things are not
[1:04:04] expedient or beneficial all things are
[1:04:07] lawful for me but I will not be brought
[1:04:09] under the power of any so I wrote 1st
[1:04:12] Corinthians 6:12 and roll I will not be
[1:04:15] brought under the power of any and I
[1:04:17] just read it a few times wasn't like I
[1:04:19] was like standing up and pretend like I
[1:04:21] was fighting the devil or not I just
[1:04:22] quoted it a few times I just pray it I
[1:04:24] just went to church and pretty soon I
[1:04:26] threw out my last 10 and for two weeks
[1:04:28] after I threw it out I never thought
[1:04:30] about chewing tobacco for two weeks
[1:04:31] until two Sundays later and I knew at
[1:04:35] that moment that I was so glad Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ had set me free I made a vow I'll
[1:04:40] never go back so if my weak spot was
[1:04:45] lost of the flesh that I needed the Lord
[1:04:48] to fight against that so it's not a weak
[1:04:51] spot anymore it's a strong spot amen
[1:04:57] so in other words my life it was like
[1:05:00] this it is written I will not be brought
[1:05:03] under the power of demons that try to a
[1:05:07] dick to substances glory now what are
[1:05:14] you gonna fight with that's what I
[1:05:16] fought with now what are you gonna fight
[1:05:17] with what what what do you got for Satan
[1:05:20] now you know you how many know you got a
[1:05:22] weak spot well your hand better be up or
[1:05:24] at least in your heart it better be up
[1:05:25] or you're lied and the Friends of God
[1:05:27] and you don't want to lie in God's
[1:05:28] presence right everybody's got weak
[1:05:32] spots so the thing to do is find the
[1:05:36] word and know this you know sometimes
[1:05:38] sooner or later whatever season it's
[1:05:41] gonna be you know Satan's gonna come
[1:05:43] along and try to fight you so get your
[1:05:45] sword ready hey get the load ready hang
[1:05:49] it up read it quote it play it whatever
[1:05:51] you've got to do get the word ready for
[1:05:54] that word defeat Satan anytime anywhere
[1:05:58] that's right his weak spot was hunger so
[1:06:02] Satan said if you're the Son of God make
[1:06:04] some bread here jesus said it is written
[1:06:07] God has not lead
[1:06:09] me to do that I will not live by bread
[1:06:10] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:06:12] out of the mouth of God
[1:06:13] he knew he hadn't met Moses then I like
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:17] Satan's like whoa well you're not Moses
[1:06:19] I you know a couple thousand fifty nine
[1:06:22] years ago I met Moses and I tempted him
[1:06:24] out there forty days and he fell right
[1:06:26] away what a difference this man is the
[1:06:29] most I wonder if I who is this man
[1:06:34] because last time he just tricked Moses
[1:06:37] is one thing look at him look how evil
[1:06:40] look how wicked they are they don't even
[1:06:41] love you
[1:06:42] they don't even love God and Moses got
[1:06:45] so angry he saw the smoke coming out of
[1:06:47] his ears smoke coming out nostrils oh is
[1:06:54] that right
[1:06:55] but then seems like look how smooth that
[1:06:59] yeah I'm the Prince and power of the air
[1:07:02] I'm such a fine guy I got him in his
[1:07:04] weak spot I know his weak spots but then
[1:07:06] Jesus come along
[1:07:07] he was looking more humble than Moses
[1:07:09] Moses was a strong great military man he
[1:07:14] thought st. without well I'll surely get
[1:07:16] Jesus look he's just a humble little
[1:07:17] nothing and Jesus stood there he might
[1:07:19] have been 5 foot 2 he might have been 5
[1:07:21] foot 3 but he pulled out this huge seven
[1:07:24] foot long sword and what /you let's say
[1:07:26] it is written man does every word that
[1:07:30] proceedeth amount of God amen Moses
[1:07:35] didn't have that right Moses led his
[1:07:39] weak spot kind of show but Jesus took
[1:07:43] his weak spot and he had to learn ready
[1:07:46] and when that weak spot was tested he
[1:07:48] fought against the deceiver and he
[1:07:50] overcame him and now it was a strength
[1:07:52] spot ha ha ha amen
[1:07:56] he said I've met somebody more than
[1:07:59] Moses ah this guy actually knows how to
[1:08:02] fight let me try them one more time so
[1:08:05] he pulled up his sleeves I'm gonna get
[1:08:09] this guy now I usually don't get punched
[1:08:11] like that you know he got punched
[1:08:13] oh yeah I'll take two more shots but we
[1:08:17] know it happened after the third he gave
[1:08:20] up and said I give it
[1:08:22] as they're different he's the Holy One
[1:08:23] in Israel I don't know how I'm gonna
[1:08:25] kill him but I'm gonna kill him but the
[1:08:27] Bible said they know what death would
[1:08:29] have done to Jesus they never would have
[1:08:30] crucified him
[1:08:31] oh yeah because they set him free that's
[1:08:35] it him free to go and pay the price in
[1:08:37] hell and take the keys of death and hell
[1:08:40] and destroy all house dominions amen
[1:08:43] hallelujah they would not have killed
[1:08:46] him because do death he conquered death
[1:08:48] and he condemned death and then he
[1:08:50] defeated death and rose on the third day
[1:08:53] hallelujah see he was shown he took this
[1:08:59] he took the strength of the world in
[1:09:01] order to protect his weak spots and then
[1:09:05] even after that he was so tired the
[1:09:07] angels of God came to help him out oh
[1:09:09] that's how faithful God is right if you
[1:09:13] fight to your last breath get out here
[1:09:16] Satan and you fight to your last chance
[1:09:20] get out of here and you give all your
[1:09:24] efforts I'd love nothing else that's the
[1:09:27] time Satan will leave and God will send
[1:09:29] His angels to bring your angel food oh
[1:09:32] yeah
[1:09:33] that's if you could just hang on just
[1:09:37] hang on God is gonna give you relief bad
[1:09:40] will give you a new season in life how
[1:09:44] many been a witness to that you can just
[1:09:48] endure the season a little longer you
[1:09:52] just make it through those 40 days God
[1:09:55] will strengthen you at the end and
[1:09:58] there's anything that the church ought
[1:10:00] to know today is God's Word
[1:10:05] does anything you and I ought to know
[1:10:07] today it's quoting God's Word how to
[1:10:12] send reply to your heart search
[1:10:16] I'll close in like 30 minutes okay so
[1:10:19] just give me your everything but if you
[1:10:21] don't know what scripture you need to
[1:10:25] apply it to your heart ask me or ask ask
[1:10:28] the Lord under saying like I can be a
[1:10:32] help to you and you can be a help to me
[1:10:35] right we can help one another but that's
[1:10:39] the only way you and I are going to
[1:10:41] defeat Satan at our weak spots is if we
[1:10:44] know how to set the word together and
[1:10:47] apply it to our hearts besetting sins
[1:10:57] the Bible said we all besetting sins
[1:10:59] right knee bruise chapter 12 lay aside
[1:11:01] the sin which none is Li beset you this
[1:11:09] we got to do that you know on your phone
[1:11:11] you have like you have widgets on your
[1:11:13] phone right like that are shortcuts on
[1:11:15] the left side of my phone I'll go to the
[1:11:17] widgets and I'll see the weather well I
[1:11:19] put news on there for a while and pretty
[1:11:22] soon it was very helpful with that for a
[1:11:24] while they started putting like news
[1:11:25] about celebrities on there and then
[1:11:28] there's articles like with half-naked
[1:11:29] women on there and I'm like this is of
[1:11:32] the devil I'm trying to seek God I'm
[1:11:34] trying to pray to God and even though
[1:11:35] these pictures are like this big I can
[1:11:38] still see immoral clothes so what do I
[1:11:42] got to do I gotta take that word and
[1:11:45] apply it to my heart I will set no
[1:11:48] wickedness before my eyes praise the
[1:11:51] Lord it started out as a good thing oh I
[1:11:53] just want to see the news how is Trump
[1:11:54] doing with the Democrats saying you know
[1:11:57] just like what's the new phone looking
[1:12:00] like away but then pretty soon Satan
[1:12:03] tried sneaking it in there and I caught
[1:12:05] that I said I have to look at this kind
[1:12:08] of I all set no wicked thing before my
[1:12:10] eyes that doesn't please the Lord God
[1:12:13] help me to be pure
[1:12:14] I took the Lord and applied to my heart
[1:12:18] if I want news I'll just go into the
[1:12:20] Google app itself because I realized
[1:12:23] Satan is trying to attack me the the
[1:12:26] weak spot of my eyes right because most
[1:12:28] men have a weak spot of their eyes most
[1:12:29] men I saw Satan's trying to attack my
[1:12:32] weak spot
[1:12:33] so I quote the Word of God I will not
[1:12:35] send a wicked thing before my eyes
[1:12:37] that's just that's it for from this week
[1:12:40] praise God
[1:12:43] good lie
[1:12:45] challenge Israel for forty days oh he
[1:12:50] stopped out there which one of you you
[1:12:53] defy the God of Israel you're like your
[1:12:55] God is even God said one man to fight me
[1:12:58] and whoever wins will serve the other
[1:13:02] one the army will serve the other army
[1:13:03] of the victorious one and he mocked and
[1:13:06] made a mockery of God of the message
[1:13:10] I'll say like that he mocked the message
[1:13:12] for forty days and pretty soon God got
[1:13:14] fed up and said that's fine
[1:13:15] I'm gonna send David in there you've
[1:13:18] mocked me long enough you've gone
[1:13:20] through this test long enough I'm gonna
[1:13:21] send a deliverer I'm gonna send a giant
[1:13:23] killer in there haha
[1:13:26] God a giant killer a little tiny
[1:13:29] teenager I've got a giant killer
[1:13:34] let's see you saw he's a foot taller and
[1:13:36] everybody else no I can't use him he
[1:13:38] compromises on the word all the time
[1:13:40] put him under political pressure he'll
[1:13:43] compromise and he'll blame the church
[1:13:45] for it that's what he did
[1:13:47] he won't wait he does that patience he's
[1:13:50] not a judge there I want that guy who's
[1:13:53] out the weirdness that loves his sheep
[1:13:54] he's willing to invest with his little
[1:13:56] sheep out there protect his sheep he's
[1:13:58] seeing songs all the time he dances in
[1:14:01] the spirit he's got a hurt that's after
[1:14:03] the heart of God after 40 days God said
[1:14:07] I got I got right just the right
[1:14:08] giant-slayer
[1:14:09] oh yeah well Adam said every one of them
[1:14:16] other big degrees they was shivering
[1:14:17] with their degrees they were scared that
[1:14:20] fellow Goliath because he's the big man
[1:14:21] so he boasted like that for 30 days you
[1:14:23] ever notice forties a number of
[1:14:25] temptation
[1:14:27] certainly Moses in the mountain for 40
[1:14:28] days come back was tempted Jesus one of
[1:14:30] the wilderness forty days was tempted 40
[1:14:32] days of temptation he said rain 40 days
[1:14:34] of service for it is God's number of
[1:14:37] temptation think about that just make a
[1:14:41] just make a little kind of calendar in
[1:14:43] your mind most of your battles lasts
[1:14:46] about what a month or so of something
[1:14:48] lasts longer right Abraham had to be
[1:14:51] tested for 25 years we don't like that
[1:14:54] one but rather take 40 days
[1:14:58] but see think about that sometimes you
[1:15:00] have battles there like this whole month
[1:15:02] versus this whole month has been and
[1:15:06] what is it going to compete Church
[1:15:08] it could be God is testing us God is
[1:15:11] letting us go through and endure
[1:15:13] temptation that we might learn how to
[1:15:16] apply the Word of God to our lives
[1:15:24] now look at this Israel's unbelief after
[1:15:27] 40 days of searching the land - 40 days
[1:15:31] they sought the land and because they
[1:15:34] rejected it each day was a year a
[1:15:37] punishment God said I'll give you 40
[1:15:41] days try this out you'll see four four
[1:15:44] after four days look at this they're
[1:15:45] bringing back all these fruits you're
[1:15:47] more than conquerors listen God just
[1:15:49] brought you through the Red Sea you just
[1:15:51] saw millions of Egypt Egyptians die come
[1:15:54] on God can take us in here and after all
[1:15:57] those miracles they still would say no
[1:15:59] there's no way I can be born again right
[1:16:03] because that's what it represented what
[1:16:05] the promised land represent being born
[1:16:07] in well God got saved me from cigarettes
[1:16:11] and smoking and drinking lesson but I
[1:16:14] don't know if God can fill me with all
[1:16:15] the ghosts see we must not doubt God we
[1:16:19] must remember just like David and
[1:16:20] remember all the previous victories and
[1:16:22] that will build up in order to overcome
[1:16:25] the present move trial that looks so
[1:16:28] great it's great in all eyes but it's
[1:16:30] tiny in God's eyes hallelujah see
[1:16:35] they're saying we're like grasshoppers
[1:16:36] we're like grasshoppers but from heaven
[1:16:39] God was seeing them they were like a
[1:16:41] great invincible army because the angel
[1:16:44] of the house was with them amen
[1:16:47] whichever side the angel is on that's
[1:16:50] the winning side we are stopped looking
[1:16:53] at ourselves in ourselves of course we
[1:16:55] always look a flimsy of course we always
[1:16:57] look weak but with Christ in us were
[1:17:00] more than conquerors in Christ Jesus the
[1:17:03] angel the Lord is with us amen
[1:17:07] the messenger
[1:17:09] kevin is with us praise God why cuz
[1:17:11] we're stepping on the heavens word
[1:17:13] heavens Laura brother Ram called it
[1:17:19] punishment forty more years of
[1:17:22] punishment because of unbelief now let's
[1:17:25] go to this though it's a terrible thing
[1:17:27] to think of unbelief look how God so
[1:17:30] punishes unbelief your eternal
[1:17:33] destination rests upon your faith and
[1:17:34] your actions speak Allah so loud that
[1:17:37] your words can't be heard your attitude
[1:17:40] towards the things of God may God help
[1:17:41] our attitudes this morning God you can
[1:17:45] do great things you can save my you can
[1:17:49] save my mother you can save my father
[1:17:51] right you can fill me with the Holy
[1:17:53] Ghost you can heal my sickness it's our
[1:17:56] attitude God so God so hated that
[1:18:00] attitude of unbelief because they forgot
[1:18:03] remember the Bible said they tended in
[1:18:04] 10 times 10 times God allowed them in
[1:18:08] the wilderness to tempt him and after
[1:18:11] he'd done all those great miracles they
[1:18:14] turned him down and God said I just
[1:18:15] can't stand unbelief and he says your
[1:18:18] actions speak so loud that your words
[1:18:22] can't be heard that's why church if you
[1:18:24] don't if you don't come up to the altar
[1:18:27] you ought to get on your face or do
[1:18:29] something and you ought to speak the
[1:18:31] Word of God you you you've got to bring
[1:18:36] your body into subjection to God's Word
[1:18:38] you've got to have an action sometimes
[1:18:41] you might have to put on this altar day
[1:18:43] God take it out of me I don't want to do
[1:18:45] that again but you need to action
[1:18:48] actions are louder than words
[1:18:51] you need to beYOU and I need to pray and
[1:18:54] confess the word until we know we're
[1:18:56] gonna be overcomers anybody can say the
[1:19:01] right thing well god bless you brother
[1:19:03] we love the message god bless you sister
[1:19:04] we love that anybody can say that and
[1:19:07] that's good but we need to be doers of
[1:19:09] the word and not hearers only terrible
[1:19:14] to disbelieve God's Word
[1:19:16] oh god help us to believe amen that's
[1:19:22] when
[1:19:22] I will punish people is because they saw
[1:19:25] the miracles of God and yet they still
[1:19:27] test him and doubt him and tempt him and
[1:19:30] then see all these great things and turn
[1:19:32] down where he's taking them in life I
[1:19:35] don't want to turn down where he's going
[1:19:38] where he's taking me I want to go where
[1:19:39] he's taking me right I want to reach
[1:19:44] God's destination for me I don't want to
[1:19:46] come short of it I want to achieve it
[1:19:52] remember the Bible said look at this
[1:19:56] he's our God we are the children of his
[1:19:57] pasture don't you love that I love that
[1:19:58] song and the Sheep of his hand today if
[1:20:02] you hear his voice harden not your heart
[1:20:05] see have the right attitude as in the
[1:20:08] provocation as the day's in temptation
[1:20:10] wilderness when your father's tempted me
[1:20:12] proved me and saw my work 40 years long
[1:20:14] was I agree with the generations and is
[1:20:16] the people that do err in their heart
[1:20:18] and they have not known my ways under
[1:20:20] whom I swear my wrath but they shall not
[1:20:21] enter into my rest see they saw God
[1:20:25] proved to them by separating the Jordan
[1:20:27] right I'm sorry Red Sea God proved to
[1:20:31] them like they actually walked out of
[1:20:34] Egypt and people like here take my rings
[1:20:36] here take my jewels here take just just
[1:20:38] take it just take like yeah God's paying
[1:20:41] us back for all these years of slavery
[1:20:42] right they they actual actually went
[1:20:45] through that and then doubted God could
[1:20:48] deliver them from these heathens out
[1:20:50] here in Canaan God just delivered them
[1:20:54] from the greatest military force in the
[1:20:56] whole world history up to that point and
[1:20:59] now they're doubting that God could
[1:21:00] we're scared of a few giants oh god help
[1:21:06] us guys deliver us from Satan right and
[1:21:09] all the wrath of our sins if God's
[1:21:12] alluded us from our sins how much more
[1:21:14] can he defeat all these trials that
[1:21:16] stand before us amen he's already done
[1:21:18] the great deliverance he already took me

[1:21:32] he take us to the rapture to the third
[1:21:36] Pole how much more will he do that if he
[1:21:40] already brought me this far it's our
[1:21:44] attitude god I remember saying this is
[1:21:47] my life I don't know if I could ever
[1:21:48] quit chewing tobacco God proved to me he
[1:21:51] can do it right
[1:21:54] God I don't know if you can ever save
[1:21:56] cam but God did it with me and so it's
[1:22:04] our attitude we've seen the work of God
[1:22:07] we've seen God prove his word to us now
[1:22:10] it's our attitude we can take this
[1:22:12] rapture not shy away let go make this
[1:22:22] excuse like well before I can't heal a
[1:22:23] headache well how am I gonna do the body

[1:22:52] latter and for the rapture Amen thank

[1:23:24] they don't really believe God can do it
[1:23:27] may God raise our faith to believe now I
[1:23:35] looked at this
[1:23:36] Ezequiel aid 40 days to represent 40
[1:23:38] years each day was going to be a year
[1:23:42] now this is the second time around
[1:23:44] church they already had those the the
[1:23:47] Israel that came out of Egypt they
[1:23:49] already had 40 years wandering around
[1:23:50] this is after they had Kings than all
[1:23:52] these things and now they're get ready
[1:23:55] to get kicked out land again and God
[1:23:58] gives him again forty days for 40 years
[1:24:00] God shows him the same thing 40 40 tests
[1:24:04] temptation you know I like this though
[1:24:09] this is a good one for us Church the
[1:24:12] angel Lord came to him a second time
[1:24:13] touched him and said horizon II because
[1:24:15] this journey is too great for thee how
[1:24:17] many would say amen to that this journey
[1:24:20] is too hard for my flesh Satan is
[1:24:23] awfully powerful against my flesh and I
[1:24:27] don't have enough strength I need divine
[1:24:29] strength for this test it's too great
[1:24:35] for my flesh and he rose and it eat and
[1:24:38] drink it wasn't the strength of that
[1:24:39] meat forty days and forty minutes on the
[1:24:42] order of the Mount of God
[1:24:44] hahaha that's why the Bible says that
[1:24:48] the weak say I am strong
[1:24:51] glory see we just got a feast on God's
[1:24:55] Word if we feast on God's Word won't be
[1:24:59] strong enough for the journey hallelujah
[1:25:01] that's why you don't miss church that's
[1:25:03] why you listen to Wednesday night that's
[1:25:04] why you you listen to Sunday night
[1:25:06] that's why you come all the time because
[1:25:08] there's one thing that will give us
[1:25:10] strength for the journey and that's
[1:25:11] God's holy word we find the Prophet next
[1:25:16] then coming to the cave I just wonder
[1:25:17] what the kind of ottoman was in those
[1:25:19] cakes needed eat it kept in go
[1:25:25] good condition for 40 days must've been
[1:25:27] some really supernatural protein in
[1:25:29] there don't you imagine the scientists
[1:25:32] of the day would like to take one of
[1:25:33] those ho cakes and examine it down in
[1:25:35] the laboratory and find out many
[1:25:37] chemicals in it how much vitamins they
[1:25:40] could keep a man in good strength for 40
[1:25:42] days walking God still got a laboratory
[1:25:45] full of them and they're for journeying
[1:25:49] purposes
[1:25:54] God has a laboratory full of spiritual
[1:25:58] vitamins that his people can still feed
[1:26:01] on today it's called the Holy Bible
[1:26:03] Church and it's for journeying purposes
[1:26:09] hallelujah and while he was laying there
[1:26:12] into the tree weird upset God quite his
[1:26:14] nerves fed him woke him back up again
[1:26:15] fed him again put him back to sleep you
[1:26:17] know I've often wondered what was in
[1:26:18] those cakes
[1:26:19] what kind of vitamin D to get in those
[1:26:20] cakes however what well that was in
[1:26:23] their last in 40 days 40 nights he went
[1:26:25] the strength of those cakes
[1:26:25] God knows tonight I need some of them
[1:26:29] and I'm sure that this church needs some
[1:26:36] of them come aside oh wow from the world
[1:26:39] and let's rest a while let's talk a
[1:26:42] while no what did I said you had to
[1:26:48] leave here to run away form Ahab and
[1:26:50] Jezebel he had to slip us up the things
[1:26:53] of the world lay out here in their
[1:26:55] juniper tree so God could every separate
[1:26:59] yourself God could deliver the case that
[1:27:01] would empower him for 40 days of journey
[1:27:05] and brother Branham said I need some of
[1:27:08] those tonight glory let's stand to our
[1:27:13] feet here I'm gonna stop right there how
[1:27:18] many would say I

[1:27:28] came aside to the house of God today you
[1:27:31] could have been out there you might have
[1:27:32] had some really important errands to do

[1:27:36] Wednesday night usually I could've did
[1:27:38] that alright maybe I mean all these
[1:27:40] years of passing right thirteen years we
[1:27:43] could add all these things that could
[1:27:44] attempt you to go but I'm so glad I
[1:27:47] stepped aside from the things of the
[1:27:49] world and came out here to have some
[1:27:52] fellowship with God some vitamins Church
[1:27:57] are you weary this morning is anyone
[1:28:00] laying under the juniper tree weary this
[1:28:02] morning

[1:28:06] shocked
[1:28:09] whatever vitamin was in that food we
[1:28:12] know that spiritual vitamin exists today
[1:28:14] in God's Word and then I just had this
[1:28:20] thought maokai you can come here to the
[1:28:21] piano I just had this thought again and
[1:28:28] Gees answered and Senator Martha Martha

[1:28:52] things that are troubling you do we
[1:28:54] realize that church sometimes we let we
[1:28:57] let this little thing right here like
[1:28:59] this thing trouble us now before before
[1:29:03] smartphones it was this little thing
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] that a little piece of paper troubles
[1:29:11] and God's got this heaven this
[1:29:14] laboratory in heaven full of spiritual
[1:29:16] vitamins for us glory if we can just set
[1:29:21] aside from those things and come out
[1:29:24] into a quiet place and talk it over with
[1:29:27] the Lord
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:30] they're so troubled he said you're
[1:29:32] soaked you care so much about these
[1:29:34] things many things plus the bills it's
[1:29:40] the children
[1:29:41] it's my spouse it's the job trouble with
[1:29:45] all these many things but Jesus said you
[1:29:49] need ones thing that's spiritual
[1:29:51] vitamins amen
[1:29:55] and Mary chose to take her vitamins she
[1:30:00] chose the good vitamins
[1:30:03] should not be taken away from these
[1:30:07] vitamins are so powerful they come into
[1:30:10] you and they become part of you your
[1:30:13] body doesn't get rid of them by doesn't
[1:30:15] flush them out Bob body doesn't sweat
[1:30:17] them out they become part of you they
[1:30:19] become part of your character it's true
[1:30:24] ever since I started quoting that I will
[1:30:27] not be brought in the power of any I've
[1:30:28] never gone back to smoking cigarettes
[1:30:30] chew I've never got drunk on alcohol
[1:30:35] because it's now a part of me
[1:30:37] I've character as a Christian the
[1:30:43] vitamin has become one with me I become
[1:30:47] one with the word jesus said there's one
[1:30:53] thing needful
[1:30:55] that's to sit and have this conversation
[1:30:58] come aside and rest a while let's talk a
[1:31:00] while programs in the midst of it
[1:31:04] although every age and every profit
[1:31:06] that's better would be there's going to
[1:31:08] be a certain amount of people that's
[1:31:09] predestinated to hear that message and
[1:31:12] they'll follow it
[1:31:14] those ignore the crowds they ignore the
[1:31:17] criticism of the unbeliever they have no
[1:31:21] argument with them they've got one thing
[1:31:24] to do and that's believe and to get
[1:31:27] every bit of it that they can and soak
[1:31:29] it in like Mary who said at the feet of
[1:31:32] Jesus Martha was fixing his dinner jesus
[1:31:38] said there but Martha you're so
[1:31:40] concerned about the other things Ameria
[1:31:43] sought the better things see the things
[1:31:46] of eternal life I mean like those things
[1:31:50] today I'll get to Jonah maybe tonight I
[1:31:54] didn't I thought I'd get a lot farther

[1:32:07] life
[1:32:07] I mean thankful for the Lord today let's
[1:32:13] just if we can just bow our heads for a
[1:32:14] moment here I remember I said earlier I
[1:32:16] feel like the Holy Spirit brought that
[1:32:17] back to my remembrance there's an action
[1:32:22] if you need a scripture on something to
[1:32:24] help you take action God is grieved when
[1:32:27] we don't take action on something we've
[1:32:30] got to act upon it
