over here to see us appreciate amen god bless you sir love you and my sister every so everybody that's my sisters you never know that that's a home turn that's my sister right there Betsy I think I'm what I met three years older Betsy's been a real saint of God her and Dustin or such pillars and brother cams church there and I just love them so much then look at their wonderful children my goodness love all of you god bless ya like you got two sets you know too old or too young I just want to say a few words before brother cam comes you know not everybody is aware of it brother Brooks is the the pastor that we first sat under so brother called God called us to his church and there was three at least three there's more churches than that in the area but of all the churches God took us to brother Brooks his church and the reason was because they believed in the real Holy Ghost yeah I'm not saying anything against the other churches but you know by their fruits they're known and and we are so grateful brother Brooks he protected us brother Brooks never told us to go to these other you know we didn't need youth meetings all those those gonna be good but we didn't need those because we had the Holy Ghost medium clay and I didn't need it because I got the Holy Ghost you know the day after I was married the day after he married me I got them all to go and there was like four or five people that said they got the Holy Ghost that day and so God chose a special vessel it was brother Brooks to be like our spiritual father and teach us and then I sat under him as a deacon for a year and a half and then we felt led to start this church 14 years ago this weekend brother it was the first weekend in June of 2006 brother Brooks oversaw that then he ordained me a pastor here we're just we're just continuing the same gospel brother Brooks preaches this is the same one for the Branham preached yeah amen which is the same one all for age which is the same one Jesus preached a man yes it all goes back to Jesus and we're just a continuation of that and brother Brooks I said as I said he baptized me he married me my wife he yeah he ordained I'm sorry he ordained me he dedicated Lydia he's just been so instrumental in my walk with the Lord God chose him of all the people to do that so thank you brother Brooks really love you thank God for coming by I appreciate that 14 years can you believe it so we're so thankful and then before brother cam ministers a lot of people don't know but I was a ranked sinner until I stepped in Cam's car and listened to his Christian music Christian music is where I left god I've been fifth grade I bought an Amy Grant CD heart and motion I'll never forget it that's where I was I was memorizing Scripture by the dust and I was going to word of life with Eric Frye I was I was on fire for God in my little way you know but then as soon as I bought that I started falling away I got with the custer's and the you know the smokers and evil and then when cam let me borrow his car to go see my wife my first year of college I started liking this Christian music I'm like what has he gotten here this is pretty good and then it was three months after that that I got saved so just like Abraham wherever you leave God that's we got to go back and find it so I left God with music and God used cam to bring me back to Christ through music and then in 2010 I hadn't seen any miracles than the message I saw I've already been pastoring for years really I hadn't really seen any miracles in my ministry and cam came and preached just once more Lord and after that John Graham and I started praying I think we pray 45 minutes one night after service on a Sunday night and we started seeing miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle amen so I see how God used brother cam to point me to the supernatural now brother Brooks of course too but I needed that you know I needed cam to come in and priests and I men probably wet that service and God just did something real in my life and really pointed my eyes to the supernatural power of Jesus Christ so I just want to tell you and I would have made a great mistake in my book if you enjoyed my book you have a lot of credit to brother km ultimately it's the Holy Spirit but you know God gives you use man I was gonna make an awful mistake in chapter 5 on earrings I was gonna make an awful mistake but cams like Oh Jesse you're this this this this this he's right mmm and so God used him more than anybody else to help me with that book so I just want to make sure you know what a blessing you know God has used brother Brooks and brother cam these brothers have been so instrumental in establishing our church and keeping us going and so I just want to give them credit and thank the Lord for how God's used them okay that's my five minutes yes and praise God let's stand here and praise God this saying I worship you letting that course again every man wonder inaudible songs reason you're here [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and everyone is working effectually to further the ministry of Jesus Christ on this arm amen so something especially these preacher brothers here they've just been more than amazing to me and I'm not even going to try to compare with that type of exhortation to the right but a husband by God's grace we just appreciate all these brothers and every one of you have been you've been friends you've been brothers and sisters and you know it's like they said to Christ they said you're your mother and your brother call for you and he said who is my mother my brother says they that do the will of my faith so I call you family and so it's a it's quite a pleasure tonight to see everybody in the house of God and especially a brother Dustin's sister that's he that's that's my deacon at home and say what he can save the day sometimes and I need a cup of coffee and already gone cuz brother Jesse said wife wake up in the morning I bought went out a little bit early so we do appreciate the that that little save there and it's just it's just good and I say this with all humility brothers sister we all should be whatever we can spend for the Lord we want to give them and if you have energy given your energy you can talk give them you're talking and if you can worship give them your everything that you are may it be given to him amen so we're going to get into the Word of God now Psalm 65 verse 4 appreciates at home I had to change the whole Asher and before we come I said I said there's there's a couple sermons on the boat Pete and repeat Peter announced boat who's left he said repeat already God so he was trying to figure it out I had to put that together for me so for home this is a repeat for them but I've spent almost a dozen sermons working with this and I love what and brother Brooks is at that place we're coming back to the fullness of an Eden experience it may not be fully manifested at this point in time but the word was delivered 50 out some years ago to show us exactly how to get there and how to allow the Holy Spirit to take over our being amen so with that being stated let's go to Psalm 65 for then we're gonna go to Exodus after that 28 I believe got a lot to say and I'm gonna try to say it really quick I'm gonna try to bunch everything together try to give it to you this has been an amazing help to me but tonight tonight I want to make some sense of some things especially I I'll tell you what the reason I live is the worship you that's all and perfectly once again confirms where we're going brother thank you for being led of the Holy Spirit and we really really really need to give God more yeah he deserves so much more so we have to look at where we're at and judge accordingly and then see what we can offer our Savior and all she wants is you so God let it be so Psalm 65 4 it says blessed is the man whom thou chooses so notice this and cause us to approach unto thee all right so you're if you're here tonight what did he do he chose you to be here and now he didn't just choose you to be here now he actually has what he has made a move to cause you to approach unto him not into a preacher not into a church a bunch of group of people he has caused you to approach unto him Amen that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple amen amen this it's got a lot of people god bless amen X is 21 now I try to get these on here so I can try to speed up because if not we'll we'll be around for a long time so I'll tell you what you enter heavenly places one time you can be there for five hours even I remember brother Brooksby sometimes you just kind of what happened to time Oh woody you entered into X is 28 1 it says and take out onto the air and my brother and his sons with him from among the children of Israel then you may minister unto me in the priests office even Aaron Nadab and Abihu Eleazar Eleazar and Ithamar Aaron's sons and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted whom i filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office and these are the garments which they shall make a breastplate and ephod and a robe an embroidered coat a mitre and a girdle they shall make holy garments of Aaron thy brother for Aaron thy brother and his sons that he may minister unto me in the priest's office and they shall take gold and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen oh my in order for Aaron and his sons to approach unto service unto the Lord why are we here we're here to do service unto the Lord right if we would want to be honest these are not even church meetings we're here to do service unto the Lord so what is so special every time we come to the Lord or the house of God is we're here to do service to God well why is that well just like Aaron his sons were priests all right let's bow our heads for word of Prayer Lord Jesus how we love you God we appreciate you Lord for just being here Lord oh the worship that was given tonight Oh Lord we just pray it touch it touched your heart of hearts O God and or there was something that pleased you and Lord we know that you inhabit us the praise of your people Lord so we know you're here Lord we know you're here to speak to us and Lord be intimate with us tonight show us your heart Lord and an order I don't want to be dictated by a slide or anything like that or we just want to be used of you Lord so we're asking or you'd allow your mind to be enough so God and let it be in every individual here Lord may there be a strength raised up oh god where the atmosphere of the devil tries to to get us to be tired it tries to get us to to be formal oh god we want to oh God erupt with who you are Lord the praise thereof Lord to treat you like you deserve to be treated so we're asking Oh God tonight that may we from our heart to give you a sacrifice of praise and Lord surely Oh God be found in our minutes we love you worship you and praise your holy name Lord Jesus Christ and shirt stays together a and they seated the mantle mile a little foundation down and by the grace of God we will get right to this as a blessing at home I know be a blessing to you just trusting so but we have to realize that exactly with the Garden of Eden it was a special place and Eden was so special because even as your prophet said he said he said God would walk down in the cool of the evening amen who said he'd set Adam and Eve a senator in his lap there's a it was a place of fellowship it was a place where where God's creation could actually be intimate with him amen and they could feel the love of God in income encompassing them amen and making them realize that they were chosen they were special they were called of God to actually please him amen they were his children hallelujah and this is all in like manner where we'll be going tonight entrance into the Holies of Holies and our topic tonight will be dressed for service amen so a lot of us tonight Amen you got your high on you got two nice dress on then the cuties got through Sunday stuff on it's just it's just something amen but notice where we're going we're talking about entering into the Holies of Holies they met and by the grace of God we want to take the manner which we feel the spirits pressing us and then go in to dress for service all right now remember in the book of Peter here in 1st Peter 2:5 it says ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God and by our God by Jesus Christ amen so we understand when in the Book of Revelations 1 where it actually said that you are now he has made you priests and kings unto our God in it that God actually by giving you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has now called you to be a priest unto Him in don't think about this while you're sitting in the seat right here you are not here to be entertained you are not here to be amused you are actually here to do service unto our God so in the commonly Rossio we have the idea that what we love entertainment we love things that bring us pleasure but brother/sister we the greatest thing that Chicago how our heart is how we can entertain our guardian and then remember he made you body spirit and soul and each matter of that but has her brother work with last week there's a hunger there but what in fulfilling that hunger we are able then to please God through that ever hallelujah please go through your body what do you gotta do you gotta worship him a little bit amen you want to please go through your spirit amen well you know what you gotta feed yourself with the wired in it I'll even let that berth forth some praise from your life amen and of course if you want to hit it on the soul level get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and one out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water even so notice and this is always the fun time because we say hope already had a long run today getting awful tired amen poor sister Julie's having to wake up brother came in the morning and by the grace of God the Bible still states that you will have to offer up spiritual sacrifices he men that is the fruit of your lips giving praise unto God even alright now notice listener I'm gonna take a little dip with this because it's so easy for us to sit there and say glory to God I'm a priest under God and I'm a priest and I want you to see what Christ was in fulfilment in Hebrews 4:14 he says he says seeing then that we have a great high priest like that that's Christ there amen he says that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession in it alright God put something on your heart amen god it's going to give you your family hold it right there it won't fasten it don't ever bring a false testimony by that you hold right on to the professor you say yes God it's gonna happen no matter how many people say you're crazy or how crazy they look you stand right there I'm holding a spiritual sacrifice that God is going to do it amen now notice she says we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin oh what a great high priest we have amen let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need amen notice now the thought here because now he's saying that Christ is what at the throne working as a high priest amen and look at what it is we see now the scripture tells us in Hebrews that now we can boldly come to the throne of grace amen so that actually states that they're in heaven where this is that God made a way that you can approach them in your prayer can reach very good faith can reach them not to come boldly in that word gold means without fear even don't fear God is going to hear my prayer amen which is concerning me because now look at what the scripture of course did when Jesus Christ died the scripture says there in Matthew 27 50 says Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold as you see the picture the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent him and hey when God comes down to tear something it's gonna make the rocks rent and it's going to make the earth quake amen but notice what this was this was the temple in the first scene and tight by the tabernacle and now it's coming to the place where Christ bag and lot that the very veil that separated man from the full presence of God which was the Garden of Eden the Holies of Holies amen that place was now right opening now why was it ran open remember there was only one that could go in once a year and that was the high priest it was the high priest hallelujah but now there's nothing that would only allow the high priests all right brother enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus to enter the holiest of my new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water now I'm gonna I want to take this right now and I wanna I want to turn the direction a little bit all right because I want you to see this because we have over and over seeing Christ is the high priest he's standing there but I want you to see what he is assuring you to do on a night where once the veil was set so that if you had walked in there you would die now the veil has been torn so that you can go in maybe that was done 2,000 years ago that wasn't done tonight that was done two thousand years ago what do you think the book of Acts heals the book of Acts was the opening of the word for the church to go into the Holies of Holies but notice now the great high priest is calling you into the holiest of all yes let's look at this a prophet said some things that just it makes your mind go question answers 59 says God lives in their heart and they are peculiar people a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice that's the fruits of their lips giving praise to God whether they feel like it or not so notice you're supposed to give praise to God you like it or not you say brother what's wrong with the message frankly we do not worship God very well and then that's one thing how do you know the things yourself only then let's think about that hey it's coming at home brother sister hey no do you realize that it is the god of this evil age right now yes who is now trying to be your God you say I'm in the message now let's think about this I'm gonna make a statement I'm gonna run yeah I told you let the Holy Spirit oh I must say you say God think about the god of this evil age he is now oh my phone broke yeah god you're gonna see this when the high priest went into the holiest of Holies he had on the Urim and Thummim it was the breastplate it was sitting right there yeah say why you holding this there cuz Satan has one too it was God's will by the Urim and Thummim that all they would have to do is ask him and he would tell them to go out or to come in he said David you go here you go there but now look at what Satan is now put in your hands now I want you to see this we say Oh YouTube Facebook all these things how do they make so much money they have found by the technology of the tree of knowledge of good and evil that was they can manipulate you by something on you I'm gonna give you something in the minute here because you're supposed to have something on YouTube and now it's the cell phone remember just like that Holy Ghost it's got a buzzer this has got a buzzer and now it buzzes you to tell you something you know what you need to do this you got a reminder oh here it is buzz buzz amen Oh somebody's call I used to sing Jesus on the mainline now what's going on brother sister but I'll tell you this operation so you just texting you can't Amen but I'll tell you this but now by the one by the reason of greed they have found that they have the complete ability to manipulate you to become your God that's why recently at all and he say conspiratorial hey man I'm on there right now I'm glory to God hallelujah you're exposed amen but we find that watch now if you start talking about it they'll put it right in front of the other I just talked about that why is it right we talked about we thought my insurance next you know I lose my phone insurance is it they're trying to manipulate you you get on YouTube and they say get a pattern by the logarithms and all these things and they control you you say I need to pray oh look at the next YouTube video I guess I'm on that and so what now Satan has become your God yeah it might not be filthy filthy stock in my be yeah if it is you beg your rid of it yeah but he's controlling he's holding his bondage that's why that's why these people they say they say that the addiction to a form is like a heroin Otis God himself he what he knows everything about you hallelujah in that way go look at the counterfeit see yes now he's watching you yeah your every move is known by the devil now God is looking at your every move he said I'm going to anoint this to righteousness you know add just a white dog she's not a black dog how to get on my shoulder and the black dog says oh wait a minute what about this what about this what about this so now you have two forces yes notice how Satan uses technology to become your God a man it gets you hooked on what hallelujah if he can't get you hooked on YouTube ill get you hooked on shopping amen oh yeah then he gave you that don't look at your search and everything that you're interested in don't lead you that route until you find out you have more interest something because God wants to be holding a God and he wants to do to you that's greater than what this could give you hallelujah is greater than the satisfaction that this tiny little box gets you but notice where Christ wants your eyes on the bloody footprints all of a sudden now this thing wants your eyes right and it takes you everywhere you go now if you're really if you really want the devil to get a little hand on you thank you but all you got to do is look at your screen time line up the Bible time the message time right with the rest of your time and you'll find out who is really manipulating you to be your God oh it's because you're a priest and here a priest you can't do the priestly sacrifices if you're not in a certain state amen right yes all right now look all right let's continue he said let's skip one no all right let's go here so whether if he at times I do not see him said the songwriter I trust and give him praise say well I go to church and I praise the Lord if I felt like it well now a priest is the make a sacrifice and you the congregation and you the congregation are high priests of God and we know I know for a fact brother Branham when he talked about the high priest there's only one hybrid and that is Jesus Christ but I don't want you to miss this why would the Prophet be anointed and call the congregation High Priest you we just showed you that because right there when that veil was torn now it allowed every single one of you enter into the Holy of Holies and wait a minute I thought the high priest was the only one can go in but don't you share they make driving away for you to go in there then another person he said every year once a year he said how the people who looked at Aaron and how they must have envied him the envies over brother sister hey there's no longer dictated so one man here one man going is a high priest now the whole congregation can go into the Holies of Holies hallelujah you go down and say well if I felt like it I'd go over and testify to somebody well do it anyhow that's a priest that's a high priest under God if you're a high priest brother it's burning in your heart whether you feel like doing it or not okay that ain't just for tonight brother sister every service you come here every morning you wake up you are a high priest to go into the Holies of Holies they then hallelujah remember there's three elements that you could have when you went into the Holies of Holies within the Holy of Holies you had the manna Aaron's rod and the Ten Commandments your prophet said that manner he said you can have that every day but I'll tell you what if it's open you can have it all every day and ride how do you put it in there and overnight it buts forth and gives life the Ten Commandments the very word of God made manifest this is what I love and you say oh god I love your words like we read this morning oh how do you hear your commandment now so what's burning in your heart right now don't worry those glands they make sweat you know back in the old day these revival days everybody was also can well everybody was worshipping everybody was loving God everyone realized they had a part to play in the house of God and that's where we're going here now notice he said he said it's burning your heart whether you like you feel like you they're not go do it anyhow because you've got to make a sacrifice something that's hard to do you say brother cam it's hard to Amen and I absolutely it might be you're tired you've been sitting in the word all day you know the church gets together in unity there's a sound like a Russian he just wants the church for any of your spiritual priesthood a wrong people giving praise to God because God lives in this heart is that he is 58 he said beggar has mean ought to know that somebody's alive around here and it's known by the walk you do to holy holy holy unto the Lord the noise gives praise and glory we're a high priests offering spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name that's what we are the fruit of our lips giving praise to all right so what do we have here we got a whole group of high priests well what makes you a high priest because we're in the Holies of Holies right now the new you now remember when God did sign in the tabernacle remember when God gave it to Moses on Mount Sinai to the actual conception in the first month was actually nine months perfectly perfectly nine months typing lot no whenever this Tabernacle was formed so that man would go and worship to it but the original Tabernacle the women could not go in the chorus the men could only go into the outer court remember when David said he said he said uh he said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the wicked he said that because he was it was normal could only enter body so that was the very soul of God the bride is called to be united to it and that alone was for the high priest Jesus very minute hallelujah so notice here that what God's design is God's design is for you to enter in and here in the way doesn't want you here now he's gonna take what you have to give him if you like being at that state hey there's why there's a separation for you go in that's right right but what God wants he wants you're Adi he wants your spirit he wants your soul he wants everything that you are to be in the very heart content of gum right here where the Shekinah glory was looming above the mercy seat [Music] but I want you to see this so okay we're called to be high priests well I want you to see this because Aaron he couldn't just walk in say guard it God it's a great stuff coming on in maybe then people might do that and go into the Holies of Holies if he would have done that it would have been a strange fire God like maybe having two by two and then he would have died just like them so God had to set up requirements of how the high priest went into the Holies of Holies no I got a sermon for all these they remember but I'm gonna just kind of him because I want to go somewhere in heaven it's first off they said my qualifications that the high priest had to be washed up into the water I've been baptized so a high priest has to be baptized but notice they couldn't just be baptized obviously I have scriptures and servants for all this but but you you study doubting them washed but notice and anointed so once they were completely cleaned out then they could look at him and see that he was perfectly washed clean how about water washing in the water the words remember they wouldn't take our songs 133 and they said how blessed it is that brother and well in unity it's like the oil that was poured upon areas for and rain down his beard down into the hem of His garment David so next his entire being would have to be one you don't have to be anointed you'd have to get the Holy Ghost you said I want to go into Holies of Holies you better get baptized you make a field of the Holy Ghost [Music] and that's what the high priest would have to do once a year well that of course is the red heifer for the waters of separation wonderful church and that water separation was done behind the cake it made a way so on so that the unbeliever could be cleaned and thoroughly purse good works amen but once I don't have it on here but on the the feast day of atonement excuse me then they would have the sacrificial goat and the state goat and laws they would have to do also the water separation on certain days but it was that state go he would be set free with all the sins of Israel Emporium amen but you see that sacrificial goat he had to be slain and what they would do is they would have the high priest take that blood and you would have to sprinkle all the he'd have to sprinkle the altar seven times he'd have to go into the into the holy place and sprinkle of seven times and then you have to take it to the mercy seat the very heart of God and sprinkle it seven times even so that High Priest he had to have before the people he watched that I preached he sprinkled every single one of those cores showing that seven church ages you can go into the Holies of Holies here remember the whole purpose Aaron was even going in the hosel horse was to apply the blood to the mercy seat so the whole population will receive mercy so what washed anointed you better take blood in with you but he also had to have incense he had to have a censor hallelujah they still do that in Catholicism it's just they're just trying to hold on to an ironic system yeah that one's done and gone now but there's still a priesthood around in the scripture says let my prayer be brought forth as incense so what God wants your prayers are you better get them always always you know God has all these parts every single one of them was a requirement of a high priest to go in say well I don't even pray well you better pray because that's part of entering into the Holies of Holies and now let's get to this thought here we'll close on this one how about it and the last one we want to touch is dressed for service so we rented the beginning in Exodus 20:8 how God's design was that that the priesthood would have garments for glory and for beauty so they just couldn't be washed may the anointing take blood but they had to wear particular garments of course the high priests in particular he had to wear certain garments in order to go into the Holies of Holies amen now let's look at what your prophet said he said now the high priest before he could go into that holiest of holy the first thing he had to have on a certain main garment it couldn't be made by anyone had to be made by holy oh I better have my wife I think this might be a different note that showed that our garments here it is just happen to come to me then brother if you're only wearing a church garment what kind of garment did you enter here tonight well a church garbage or a holy garment let's look at this the message can be a church a denomination for you it can a place where hey we believe this but that's not what gods after gods after you he says if you're only wearing a church garment you better get rid of the thing you can't go behind the holiest of Holies you'll never get into the holy communion with God you have to wear this specific guard yeah the garment that the high priest wore in there had to be made out of a holy hand to select the goods ordained of God there it is so if you join church and did your alright you're wrong seeing it has to be a God selected robe and our self righteous rags won't stand in his presence amen our righteousness is as filthy rats you cannot go in on your own righteousness so notice if your righteousness is filthy rags it don't matter who you things gonna make you a nice tire whatever you have to have the Holy Spirit which is the robe of God that dresses up the believer to go behind the holiest of holy hallelujah so the road that takes you in is the robe of God it's the garment of praise he said oh that's good I like that that was a new one never swallowed one like that before but that's here just that kind that's the real vitamin C it takes the holy s--t so now we see what we see every single element is the Holy Ghost your incense ooh what kind of prayers God want from you in them he said in Romans 8 he said that the Holy Ghost will bring forth moanings and groanings because we know not what to pray for how do we hear you're the one who showed me that brother Brooks he showed me that one it wasn't like groaning about never hearing scripture said oh glory to God I get it thank you brother blinks in 326 for my all right amen for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither one in Christ so it depends what you're putting on yes what are you putting on a knife there's about 50 servings here there's your Urim and Thummim your prophet said that was a Urim and Thummim and when when they go and ask they said they said the those gemstones would provide a rainbow that goes back and forth well see they get so specific that God would tell David and Ziggler he said go ye shall surely recover all lost everything all they had to do was approach the euro manna now think about that they had access to that Urim and Thummim the whole time but they were so back slid they never used it gave it was the one that used it David you see when you get to the book of Acts you see Philip the Holy Ghost said you go out into the wilderness the same experience return back amen so the the Urim and Thummim was only which hallelujah which is a representation of Holy Ghost it means the light of perfection which a lot of perfection Jesus Christ it was only a type of what the Holy Ghost would do for the church hey Anderson sorry man this high priest and we want to of course focus on the dressed for service he had to be dressed oh how how particular this garment was from all the rest and we got to get going a men huh so nobody's got to ride away of approach the fest get a little reading do hold on he says notice when you come in separation making confession so we got new would you come to know I confessed God forgive me any other wrong between now and then amen he says all right you can have fellowship with them you can come in then under the blood you can fellowship with him he said you can fellowship with them under the blood that's the purple that's true enough but to fellowship with God you'll have to go into the presence of God so the question is do we want to know God it's so easy for us and that's why that's why when people are spiritual it's so easy for everyone to cling to her it's okay love them but did you realize that God made each one of us to have communion with him in one shape way or form he will speak to you your father said that they might speak like he's speaking to me but he'll say have some way of quite speaking to you what we had a church move in life at very many I'll tell you it is in the mix now but to fellowship with God you have to go into the presence of God and that is into the Shekinah glory and one man once a year was dress it to go in this Shekinah glory where he fellowship with God face to face why it was so glorious in there one here he left his rider bloomed out blossom in the presence of the Shekinah glory oh yeah you want to blossom remember that almond branch and what it bought it that where flowers blossom and then it gave fruit all in one night three works of grapes take some time to get the Holy Ghost no go in Mary man sit there a little bit a 5-10 minutes hallelujah so brother sister you say brother brother branham once a year yes watch how he had to be dressed he had to be dressed in a certain garment made by certain hands only hands he had to walk such a way so the high priest didn't just have to do all that he had to walk in a special as far as I see that was that was your prophets revelation and I know he was in the Shekinah man notice he said he had to walk such a way on his garment he had a pomegranate and a bell and every time he moved his leg moving like that it played holy holy holy unto the Lord now stop for a second I'm just gonna break it out and I'm gonna give it to you do you realize that no where is it stated that it was holy holy unto the Lord that walk it can only be confirmed in this resource right the picture of heaven amen in Isaiah 6 when he went into the throne of God with the cherubim or the seraphim's net wings and what constantly in the presence of God himself the Saracens had to say holy holy holy holy holy holy bazooms the four guards in Scripture then they had four faces recognition of the of the difference upon those seven days and then to watch a guard god in his presence they had you constantly say holy holy holy what's your profit trying to tell you don't you see he's flying open the way back for the fellowship of the holy of holies you realize how deep this message is yes you realize what this means this message is so complex it is birthing us into the very marriage supper of the Lamb see it around the throne remember what was revelations for come up hither and John was caught up to the throne where they are doing this what's the picture we see their rapture then to the presence of God holy holy holy is providing us the way through the Holies of home because the holy sub Holies was the very type of the throne of God remember what was the what was the what was the tabernacle it was only a picture of the pattern that they'd seen he said what's he doing now why you see what he's doing your processes what's he doing he's approaching the Shekinah glory for fellowship with God himself carrying before you a blood oh I want to know God then first you have to see that you're a high brace you have to see that you're called to go you have to see what God requires well God won't talk to him oh we haven't been baptized well no but God won't talk to me God's got to force me don't you see that God can't break his pattern if you won't if you won't obey a simple word in in Acts 2:36 through to 39 that says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission ever since you shall receive to give the Holy Ghost house God gonna take you farther but when you can say oh yes Lord I see it I believe it I want to go in though so notice it's the approach for foolish oh god I wish I could have the voice of an angel now realize that sure edit I couldn't make that syncing notice the whole crime is hard was that this would sink into you continuing he said he didn't go for saying I am a presbyterian I'm a Memphis I'm a Pentecostal really cam could he add something I'm a message believer oh it was playing holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy packing the lot but I went before him realizing an innocent victim died and remember he was anointed with precious an aura that the Bible said how sweet it is that brothers dwell together in unity it's like the anointing upon Aaron's head that ran all the way to him through his garment he was completely covered with a sweet-smelling savour of the Lord all notice what addressing how God see now you can see how he calls your high priests and this is why this is the whole picture God would like to get his church in that condition it didn't say get religious tea in that condition and brother Brooks and brother can't hate their preachers hey he wants every see I'm up on the church all the time I said I said I'll study 8 to 10 or even more hours if I got time just try and pray and try to get the sermon right and if the only responsibility that the laity feels like they have to do is to wake up and try to get to church on time if you think that is the correct service work now you're back at a Nicolaitans spirit trying to make your on a high priest in your just a calm this message of him to say that you are a high priest when the Prophet was what when he was preaching these things God began to what setup that type of a communing with the people in such a way that they would have to meet an hour before service with all the gifts to get a message that would go to the church hallelujah but I like that because you know it's always man's design to be seen yes yes you look how the Prophet said that okay you come an hour before 6:00 oh you mean I got a sacrifice that much more you coming out early can you bring your gifts you have the gift of wisdom there you have all that there yeah and they said well nobody's gonna see it in church nobody's gonna see my gift Yeah right yeah it don't matter you're a - if God calls you to do that ya know that's the greatest thing he can do no yeah cuz you know how it is anybody wants to be a preacher everybody it's like trying to do God a service without being as well all over again yeah because of the church sets dead yeah right waiting on anointed brothers to preach waiting on the next revival serves the next can't mean waiting on all these things instead of realized that God [Applause] let's continue we're gonna move just a minute here I started real late I think it's too late for this hold on Jesus suffered without the gate that he might sanctify the people with his own blood then still don't stop this is keeping this isn't one quote then don't stop you've not come take that blood upon your heart enter in with the anointing of the Spirit upon you oh my packing the blood walking holy holy holy unto the Lord you know if he didn't make that noise in behind the curtain look at this the people didn't know whether he was dead or alive [Music] I'm telling you brother sister I'll say it right now it is an absolute doctrine of the devil that we sit cold formal that's right anybody happy [Applause] hallelujah hi never seen a parent with a child in a little Johnny or tommy whoever it is running out on the street and they say because they love that child nation yes primarily to see this he says that's the only way they could tell whether he was still living in that great glory is because while he was inside they could hear a noise notice this I wonder what's happened to the church something went wrong somewhere that's the only way they could tell he was alive because some noise going on and people's are free of noise what's our problem versus we're afraid of noise I that's the reason why most of us can't we can get the Holy Ghost because here's the thing ya really Jesse he sold that thing in me so hard I'll never ever ever ever forget but he showed right through the scripture all the way that the Holy Ghost is something you see and it's something you notice he says it's a sign that we're still alive now wait a minute I'm trying to sing because what's he actually talking about he's talking about the garment this is beautiful this is beautiful you're gonna love it it's the order it shows that there's still a living spirit within us so now notice when noise is coming from you it's not a sign that you're a fanatic it could be yeah and what Satan will do everything he can to make you afraid but if there's a Living God why is that because remember it's not even you that's worship it's the God with any anointing we're not all right let's go a little bit further a glorious noise unto the Lord now let's notice Exodus 28 31 it says and thou shalt make the robe of the ether all of blue and there shall be a hole in the top in the midst thereof it shall have a binding of woven work round about the whole of it as or the hole of a Habersham that it might be not rent ok so God didn't want that that roll that Ethan he did not want that road to be torn at all he want to mention nice and strong no matter what was going on it's gonna be all right and beneath upon the hem of it shalt thou shalt make pomegranates of blue and a purple and have started round about the hem thereof and boughs of gold between them round about motifs of golden bell and a pomegranate a golden bell and a pomegranate upon the hem of the robe around the mouth and it shall be upon Aaron to minister and a sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord when he cometh out that he died not I want you to see this because when you look at the tabernacle there was no chorus of Levite singers it's not found in the Old Testament that didn't come into the temple when David was anointed that being praised for the whole congregation but I want you to see this because when this was sold to Aaron the only knowledge was actually coming from the garnish Aaron didn't have to say a thing the garment spoke right from on him oh I want to go in the hallways of holies me not at a place you bind the Holy Spirit breathe not the Holy Spirit what about your seal to the day of your Redemption God wants to rush it from you you've got to be what he wants you to let him worship later remember was the Feast of Pentecost it was the feast of worship it was the feast of fruits but one of the grants was you had to worship if a strangers in your course he has to worship everybody worship because you've come under the Jubilee look at this bells in pomegranates this was the noisemaker that was on Aaron it wasn't Aaron himself in any form it was the Holy Ghost Dog yeah God could perfectly worship just fine without Aaron's help also Aaron had to do is what we still know that I'm God if you get this garment on you it might use your mouth now it might use your hands it might use your feet how do you remember you're probably talking about dancing in the spirit remember he got one day seen him dancing and getting into it it has any say lon he started to spice them and then he said the Holy Spirit said he said well if you had victory like she would can you be doing the same thing he said he said oh my think of it like that and whatever thing he said he said the next thing he said he says Methodist's foot started packing listen next thing you know he's not dancing to the floor he got the victory [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] I see brother and he had a quote he said he said I've seen him dancing Spiritist I'd never see him get out of the order so wait so when's the last time you seen dancing spear yeah oh I wonder where the victories that we don't have a revelation of a victory right how can the seals be broke how could how can all these things be loose to us and Satan is so hard in our hearts and hard in our mind that we can't even see this is what we don't get if we don't if we don't enter in like a high priest remember if the high priest didn't go in there the sins of the people would not remain so then they would be under sin yes remember Court in Jewish history it was actually the day of atonement I think I've said this here before but on the day of atonement one time they had they had they released the scapegoat and the scapegoat actually came back after that so the Jews had to start a tradition of walking the scapegoat to a cliff and shoving it off to its death because they thought it was a bad omen when the state goat came back it was but you know what it was even more it was the grace of God showing them that they were not right with him and then we can't figure out why the Euro could ensue they couldn't figure out whether there's no supernatural they can't and there's nothing of God moving because the approach is wrong right so if God called everyone he'd be a high priest and got dead services what's wrong there's no supernatural moving in our myths hey if we got a no listen to so does this brother that sister for a pagina a testimony that we tell everybody about there ought to be a testimony [Applause] [Music] so notice this noisemaker bells and pomegranates bells and pomegranates look at this look at this pomegranate I want you to notice color the color is black it's the color of blood the inside of a pomegranate and notice there's times remember hey we all know Congress oh how tasty they are hmm oh what a mess every one of these things you got to break out of there now look at this Jewish tradition teaches that the pomegranate is the symbol of righteousness because it is said to have 613 seeds which corresponds with the 613 mitzvot or commandments of the Torah it is customary to eat the pomegranates on Rosh Hashanah that's good enough for now so now notice we live in a pomegranate boughs and it's actually the Jews counted out the seeds of course I mean hey hey you close your eyes Park there they know them they know what word it is they count out the seeds of a pomegranate and they said oh I cannot believe it there's 613 just like the 613 laws it was counted out you know the revelation is each one of these laws is in a seed form and it's covered with red and you break it out some a little harder to get out than the old gypsy amen but I want you to see this because it would be these bells that would ring against the pomegranate so notice we can't it was a golden bath deity and notice the Bell made noise so he was ringing for the sound of praise so notice the noise it was deity ringing out a noise against the full commandments of God so when he walked in a specific way and through the holdings of holdings that probably goes Gromit would ring out the sound of 613 commandments being with I'm gonna take the word for and I know this when Jesus Christ lived a sinless life he covered all 613 [Applause] hallelujah so notice how true this revelation sits for us now yes so now even according this message God called you to go in yes he doesn't require you to be the righteousness in any aspect he only wants your life to ring for holy holy holy and as you walk in a specific way those bells ring out the melody of the perfect life of the world it didn't matter if Aaron was a sinner and in matter of Aaron failed before he come in or when he went out he got under the Holy Ghost of every single one of those tokens and then he went in he showed him that he was Saints don't miss it at your home Church don't care where you from who you're from you guys do because it doesn't matter people are gonna think you're crazy there is such a delusion over the church by office that they think any formal worship we look like Methodists the people the message look like Memphis they look like Baptists they look like all these denominations we look exactly the same way that's why everybody's getting form and program hallelujah hey I can't meet a couple years ago they were trying to figure out this brother came in and he brought a 32-page worksheet about how to know a gift of spirit you have message camps you wanna know how we're gonna know what kind of gift we have yeah you're getting the holy so holy and you get in there sit like Aaron's rod don't worry he'll show it but you see what it is you've done the same thing they live on a glare for another day but they don't enter into the promised word they were given this word says go in look at this he said oh he said the high priest was here went in one time a year with a blood before him and worship and she kind of going all anointed anointed walking he had garments on that had a pomegranate in the belly and a walk with that in such a step that he played holy holy holy in the Lord holy olio in the Lord he said packing the black performers what a beautiful picture of the church today look at this walking into and you know the reason he made them bells the people on the outside didn't know whether he was alive or not unless he was making some noise now look at this look at this I'm telling you brother dead church that don't make any noise see I'm sick and tired of all this Pentecostal brother cam I'm sick and tired of all of it I'm a high priest you're high priest it ain't me making a noise yeah it's my god and I'm guilty too [Applause] you know the thing if you like the worship you get around a big stagnant bunch of people you kind of feel a constraint what why is that feeling a constraint coming to you is that constraining you or is it coentrão Holy Ghost it's a pressure on you to constrain the holy gun so what do you give into well they might think I'm crazy Bay they might not welcome me back oh no not if you're spiritual priest right you're gonna worship God [Applause] this is something we have to do we have to have a revelation to go in a minute my dear church our dead church that don't make any noise i something's happened uh notices they haven't entered into the holy a hope if it's a dead church then he entered in the horns the Holies they're not even there how they gonna make a rapture oh god help God is every everywhere you find God you find a lot of noise exactly right when Jesus went to Jerusalem they broke down poems then gallium the Galleon peasants begin to sing Hosanna to him that cometh the name of Lord some of those Pharisees said oh that makes chills go up my back that's sacrilegious oh don't you do make them hold their peace Jesus said they hold their peace the rocks will cry off something has to take place when Christ comes in look at this is not a picture of today Luke nineteen thirty seven and we come back even out the descent of the Mount of Olives the whole monster disciples began to rejoice and praise got no notice with a loud voice for all the mighty works they that they had seen they just don't see enough mighty works well if you've seen one you better start there saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of horn don't you realize the king of kings was coming into their midst when we're in the house of God the king of kings is coming into our mess and then will you go into the closet in the morning for some third bolt I named it the King of Kings is coming into the room amen with a loud voice holy holy holy unto your Lord I'm pressing brother sighs yeah god help me I want this I want to know God that I've never known in the fall there ought to be something uttering in your heart sing God wants to know me it might take a long time you just come on you do what you're supposed to do you do what he commanded he command you truly accesing is a high priest yes notice I just can loud voice scream aloud go for it and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude who you realize that word Pharisee means actor religious actors oh you praise God too much notice master rebuke bias ipols and he answer instead of them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out see the scripture and Peter God had lively stones those were never meant to be rocks they were meant to be his church because he is a rock and his church Allah tries to hold back worship I don't care if I looked like that Holy Roller I don't care I don't care if I'm call it loud I don't care anymore this is a revelation for me Oh sister I needed this plenty of challenges along the way you know how many times I've been told remember one time I was at church and I was honest works but I ain't care what they said this is a long time ago how's this work been saying and after the church this brother comes up to me saying oh you're a broom I said how do you know that if you're not careful you can't work so my god well how am I going to be a master of every circumstance you have to learn how to use we got too many people calling themselves third Pole with some third Pole that but they can't even love God enough to worship right cuz they be let get creeds and formal jump bound them all down and then we can't figure out it's just a big intellectualism of junk I say that humbly yes look at what it produces remember would you call what the serpent said junk one word as a junk Neal one word off oh how do you hear all these bros and now they're good oh we can chat now and then we shout now but then they'll say them acts 2:38 are shouting young ones and those skipped tongue speaking they'll go this far but you know what they're not going to let you do anything to being gonna do this right but I'm a I preach the word I'll keep my mouth shut and you've been listening to my belt and pomegranates hallelujah you think it's easy to preach don't you realize when you are a high priest here and you let the Holy Ghost let those bells ring on you it makes it easy to preach it makes it easy for a salt later it makes it easy why does the anointing so draw northing junkie and then we shut the amen we're worth junkies running junkies we want everything [Applause] hallelujah hi everybody out on YouTube tonight we're sure ago your prophet says he says but the strange city well you know somehow no it's odd but everywhere notice that Jesus appears oh god is in our church we have the message we have a seventh angel there's usually somebody there to hear him don't worry God's here it's speaking to you the voice of Utah and before he got there he heard a noise see before God's coming he wants to hear [Music] [Applause] [Applause] God it's his word he anointed this work he anointed this message listen your prophet talks about this second most of you it's a lot of look at this so and they were singing all kinds of songs go over to God in the highest and all these fine hens they were singing and some screaming and shouting everybody don't have scream shout that doesn't mean some well yeah isn't it strange isn't it strange where Jesus is there's always a lot of noise it's notice what year this is this is 64 Oh Brad like hams preaching from 53 as before the seals broke maybe the seals ain't broke in your life with their broken line and when he did they broke down homes and scream and there stood those there the great professors and societies and things increasing said make them hold their peace he said if they hold their peace the rocks with crowd and even see something is going to cry out when he's around say oh yeah you look at good services absolutely because it shows God's there but that's not the proof that God's there look at the word that's where Pentecost went rolled they went for the noise and left out the word but this message came to give the word so that the noise would be in unison with the word rock this world tells you that it's the holy ghost that burst the noise anyway so he starts on my errand again when Erin's wedding she kind of before there's Pat he had to be anointed yet garments had a pomegranate bell and that's the only way that they knew there was still I would heard a noise and when I think that that's the only way that God knows whether we're alive or not notice not your brother sister God himself so the only way that God Himself will know you're alive is by those bells and pomegranates when you hear a little noise you take anything that's so dead that something happened to it to you so they had to tell whether he was alive or not by the noise that was made Oh our our dead church yeah I think God's got this little nugget hidden over there I say God Who am I you show me these things who might you show us these things we just want to be your people or failures at best but we love you going we can't serve you I hate me we're glad that we can get a Holy Ghost and please you in it we're glad you get a Holy Ghost where the song is to take blessing is the man who God will not impute iniquity voice [Applause] so now he's talking about Aaron again I might jump down to he's he's approaching the Shekinah glory the real fellowship you want real fellowship with God that's where it is yeah hallelujah now you see he had the mothership roaster you letting the devil tell you that you don't have a good voice you can let the devil tell you that you can't worship you worship before the foundation of the world it don't matter what your voice sounds like he gave it to you he gave it to you because it pleases him where's all this stuff coming from oma songs 55:16 as for me I will call upon God most on and the Lord shall save me evening morning noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my mama sometimes 80112 the chief physician if that's all the base have sing aloud under God our strength make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob take a song and bring hither a timbrel the pleasant Harbor with the psaltery say God don't like beat he loves it it's just his beat maybe the devil's beat is God's being we have to have this sermon under the Holy Ghost yes one 32:16 I will also close her priests with salvation see the spiritual go and they're safe shall shout aloud for joy oh I'm safe shout for joy such as for preached it's for saints there I'll make the horn of David the bud I have ordained a lamp from my anointed hallelujah now let's bring to a little bit more of a point we're almost done he says we've got nothing thirsting for life just like brother Jesse preacher Church thirsty we've got nothing to be sad about we've got all to be happy about you have nothing to be sad about right now nothing nothing no wonder the people get noisy it's enough to make them noisy I kindly kindly like a little noise it's a sign of life he reading that quote ha are they you know anything I can prove scientifically and it hasn't got a little noise about it it's dead so if your religion don't get a little noisy you better bury it and get one that's got something so what he talks about Aaron in the palm green bell yet then jumping now underlined he says so his long you can still see people that's gotten of God in their heart to say Amen and the church says let's change the location if they got enough gone the heart say Amen in church in the presence of their boss or their neighbor so you can say brother Candace sense all about church but know you are temple you are the temple the Holy Ghost so wherever you feel that hole is the holy jump on you just can't help it the praise God or their neighbor whoever it might be it shows that God still lives life what is better than life what Stan Psalms 34 verse 1 a psalm of David when he changed his behavior before Abimelech who drove away has something worship like that in front of people that were running out to change the behavior in front of them they don't like that I'm running out of there I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my my quiet no the scripture says in your mouth well I like fish and I like hunting I like I like walking I like racing I like all this yeah we can talk about all that stuff but what should be the chief sound coming from our mind the praise of the heart continually coming for my soul shall make her boast in the Lord the humble shall hear it here there out and be glad don't worry true believers gonna rejoice when you worship o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears so that High Priest when and where right there right for the mercy seat so when you go into that Holies of Holies you can pull from all those three sources of God God has three attributes that you can pull right from him in that hole is the hallways about our Dane through the door your prophet said that's the land of adoption yes a bunch of holy rollers you might not have ever worshipped like you think now maybe you should have don't worry about nothing mother sister right the first thing you do is you just love to hop right you love God and say God I want to you see the secret to all is yielding as long as we let people bring to our faults what receiving the Holy Ghost is your prophet said every new birth is a mess it's a mess it's gonna be messy yeah you ain't gonna get the holy go and say glory to God because when the Holy Ghost came in to Solomon's Temple with 120 trumpeters it's so filled the place that the preacher could even preach they couldn't even stand administer God fill that place and the Upper Room it turned a bunch of cowards into a bunch of loud mouths that look like drunkards they jumped out of windows you mean we're coming back to that yes yes well play the girls look great we don't have to be afraid the only thing you have to be afraid of is it afraid that you will you to the wrong the wrong voice you say who I feel like worshiping oh I feel like getting loud what if I get too loud what if I get to allow remember as a brother Graham sister-in-law are gone and all whoever it was and they want to worship [Music] he's like she's like that I'd be wrong so yeah you should worship don't think the devil yeah chance you have to service you might keep it on right so what do we need your high priest you need to be washed you need to be anointed he already provided us a seven sprinkled blood you just carry that token right in what yeah you have to apply the token with your prayer the prayers your incense and then you gotta wear the garment God spent all that time sewing back to you because he wants you in the Garden of Eden and watch your back this message call us back charge it's our time but I know it's not the only problem we have we got we got that cellphone God who runs that self home you know as a serpent come up with that thing getting on there that's why it's got a big apple on it with a bite out of it oh that has nothing to do with the Garden of Eden Yeah right who who believes that because Tim Cook whoever has had this great idea about buying an Apple trust me it all has a purpose and look at what it's doing to us if you need to separate separate missus rapture don't miss your calling to be a high priest the local body needs you we got to be there every service we got to be crying out we got to be hungry yes we got to do our best to let the Holy Ghost within us make an impact in our services and in our life he made us heart yes how many be willing to say tonight well the can I admit I might agree the spare a few times yes does it be humble maybe you say I've agreed him a lot but would you be willing to say but God I can look at that high priest and I can see that everything on him called to go in would you yeah god I look I know I've got tons of mistakes but it's just this carnal flesh that will pass along the inside the inside the loves you but God I need to be more anointed to let your Holy Ghost live from within me honey if you need a filling of the Holy oh so how do you try out for I know you eat something God give it to you just what you feed the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen if your group produces a revival in your midst how many want to say God I'm here I lay down my will yeah I'll lay down what I've called worship I lay down with what I've called a spiritual priesthood I lay it all down gone and lord I want to go behind the red veil I want to go so far back I never come back I want to be so yielded to your horn I want my whole body my host now Seoul to bring forth a holy holy holy unto you O God let it be the hearts crying each one Lord as this word was soon made anchor deep in our hearts God change the way we worship change the

what we do and y'all keep on playing keep playing you don't believe it but brother Branham looked for men who knew how to help people enter in and I want to say this by God's grace and I'm not boasting on me but I have prayed people through but if you don't follow the instructions when I say open your mouth when I say praise our Lord you have to do that because I'm inspired by God to tell you you can't keep your mouth shut he didn't have his the praise of his people y'all understand you want the Holy Ghost you gotta get rid of self you can't think about what others gonna think about you you can't think about what nobody else thinks it's between you and cop hallelujah I didn't get the Holy Ghost with my mouth shut hallelujah I learned to praise God I learned to praise Him hallelujah and I can tell you this when I began to praise God when I began to thinking for saving me when I began to thank you for watching me when I began to think him for calling me to this message but I began to thank him for being pride but I began to thank him for all that the blood had done for me hallelujah the Holy Ghost came down hallelujah you woke the Holy Ghost you got to praise Him you want the whole ego you got the thing God you are the Holy Ghost you got to lift up your hands hallelujah Oh God receiving the Holy Ghost receiving the Holy Ghost receive these are Holy Ghost is the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ Oh glory to Allah in the name of Jesus Christ he's here tonight the devil is trying to tell you getting tired you're not getting tired that's the devil trying to tell you he wants you to stop hallelujah but this is eternal life you should all brother let me tell you something I've seen people receive the Holy Ghost by the preaching of the word and that's the way it's supposed to be done somebody help me here but now the church has got so cold and dead there's no fire in the church hallelujah brother problem said like this if a man repents fully repentance when he gets baptized God right then is obligated to give him the Holy Ghost so somewhere we haven't given up everything hallelujah but tonight is your night if you want to surrender everything God will fill you but you cannot nod to the Holy Ghost God knows the heart he's a designer he knows that little habit you got he knows that religious spirit you got you got to give up the religion you need salvation you need God in your life hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah just a thought thank you brother Holy Ghost thank him for the Holy Ghost just like brother Brennan said God can heal you he's already healed you you being the pride brother Brennan tells us that not only that God saved you before the foundation is aware but he sealed you and he gave you the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world but this is your day to make manifest what God is already done and all you got to do is say I receive it Lord I received your Holy Ghost I received your Holy Ghost I received your Holy Ghost and you're also praising for you got a thank you forward you got a praise him for it you got a praise him for it thank you Jesus thank you Jesus so you can't come here hoping you're gonna get it you got to come here knowing you got it I'm coming and I'm gonna get it it's mine Satan leave my gifts alone it's mine it's mine Satan you cannot hold me back anymore I'm here tonight to receive the Holy Ghost of God and I'm receiving it right now I'm receiving it right now I'm receiving it right now I'm receiving it right now hallelujah I'm receiving it I'm receiving it I'm receiving it I'm receiving it right now right now right now I'm receiving it it's mine Jesus is mine Jesus is mine Jesus is mine Jesus is mine hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I love you and I live my vol.2 were share you oh my so read your take my key hit one you he may it be a sweet sweet ha you know somebody just thought that I was trying to uh sure these people into a Pentecostal experience by telling them what to do I didn't tell them to say Jesus Jesus Jesus I didn't tell them to say lordy lordy Lord I was instructing them see that's the difference between the Pentecostal experience and that's the difference because if you pay attention to what brother Brandon was saying he even called a Pentecostal man is that right God in simplicity after the seals and he called a Pentecostal man who knew how to lead people into the Holy Spirit mi a high priest or not hallelujah come on from out it not only am i a pastor but God has made me a priest Anke hallelujah and the prophet of God said that the New Testament preaches our prophets so what we're doing tonight if I didn't know what I was doing do you really think I would play with God do you think that you're worth it nothing is worth my soul but I cry out for souls because I have experienced so many dead folks so many people in message don't even have the Holy Ghost and they think they got it they do they may be sanctified I'm not saying that I'm not saying then that I justified but when you go into the hole in the hole it's something has to change hallelujah you share a brother Brooks let me say something to you you've got to realize this Aaron's rod we never knew what it was a male tree cannot bring forth blossoms and birds and fruit it was the female tree that's dick was female come on come on you may not see it the way I see it but it was the stick that Aaron's rod the same rock that Moses hey somebody help me here but it was a mystery hallelujah the pride is being restored somebody help me here because she's going there hiding the veil she got there she was taken back there by a priest oh my god but while the limb of the rock was in that presence something supernatural happened right now we are in the presence of the Lord you may be dead but you have an opportunity tonight to not only blossom blue but bear almonds tonight the fruit is in you arrogant put it in yellow Moses didn't put it in you it was already there it's a seed of God think about putting you that DNA up teaser Christ hallelujah I'm not here to preach but I love souls I love souls I love souls keep thinking to me became crazy however you won't tell her but I love Souls when I went to Lima we had 1313 but I believe souls winning is what the prize supposed to do hallelujah some of us got on buses some of us got in trucks some of us walked the streets some of us had blue moons some of us had kids hallelujah but we got the word out big god I heard a brother tell me the other day God and go you know revival in for us I said maybe not for you program shake the breaker the revival is over for a while not for the pride you and I know you and I know we cannot make a rapture in the condition that we are in and some of us are grieving the Holy Ghost and you think you you don't even know what you're doing you have no idea but I'm gonna tell you something let me tell you like this I know what I'm doing and I'm gonna tell you this if any of you in here hindered these young people from getting the Holy Ghost God will charge you for it this is a house of judgment and I'm telling you if your negative thoughts hinder these people from getting the Holy Ghost you will be judged for it Brotherhood's who what are you talking about we're in the house of judgment my thoughts is this we're here these young people what they gonna fight with they need God they need God they know they need God they crying out for God do you think God will not hear them God has already heard their the Holy Ghost is this it's all over them right now they just gotta believe it they just got receive it is not a thunderbolt it's a change in your heart when you know that God has heard your prayer you don't mean nothing shall cry or whatever because once it comes there you come by faith but it comes up like a willow water what the revelation strikes you he said I'm gonna give you water but you never thirst again hallelujah in a screen up like a well brother y'all hear me oh brother Adam said to that little well he said what makes you bubble it's because I come to you it's because the deal come to you what makes you bubble you know what that that that spring said he he said that spring would say if I could speak if he could speak it's not you it's not the deal but it's something pushing something pushing something moving on the inside of me moving on the inside of me let me tell you something some of these young people maybe even have the Holy Ghost already and you don't even know how to feed it see because of your earnest desire is to do the perfect will of God that is the Holy Ghost but you got to feed it you got to nurture it you got to know you got it I wake up every morning with my desire to serve God do I make mistakes you delay yes I but I know the Holy Ghost it's moving it's growing it's getting closer to maturity hallelujah rapture material and these children are - these children are - they mean let me I want to say to the young people you know we're not gonna close service now but I want you to realize that God is dealing with you that's not you you can't no man can desire God no no no no no man can desire God if you desire the Holy Spirit that means the Holy Spirit is dealing with you do you think God will like an Indian giver you don't give this to you and every time you reach 40 go snatch it back nerve my God doesn't play games hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you something let me give you this see how easy that was that's just how it is with the Holy Ghost it's not something mental it's not mental it's nothing in your mind this thing I'm talking about is in your heart hallelujah it's just taking it and if you can just do that beam out here tonight whether you feel it or not don't worry feelings come don't worry about it is coming this episode where you don't look like you don't know what you look like he can't discern and he can't look into your soul you understand me is so simple I got it and I'm gonna praise it is that right he said when when the angel came to Mary said you gonna have a baby she said be it unto me but according to my feelings now she said according to the Hooper [Music] according to thy word and she kept nurturing it hallelujah and she got so good it got so Starla since I'm going to see you yeah hallelujah it may be a matter of life and death but I will tell her when she got over there little bit and she began to say listen Elizabeth something has happened to me hallelujah misma say something happened to me too you know what it was she was pregnant our prophet or with the Prophet hallelujah but that era had gone on is that right could John said I must be crazy he must increase God understand me because let me tell you what's gonna bring revival to this message it's when we put the name of Jesus Christ in his right place y'all hear me he's a jealous God we're not doing away with the property you can't go away with him I thank God for William Branham hallelujah because we a Bradham taught me the way in that you said brother I'm looking at the bloody footprints today has changed my life young people we're not gonna wear you out but we want you to go on if I make a mistake I still got it right and Lord increase my faith Lord don't ever make me doubt tonight don't ever make me doubt my experience Lord don't ever make me say I don't have it you got it you say what do you mean the preacher don't put the seed in you he did it before the foundation of the world hallelujah and what you need to do is stop watering it hallelujah somebody said well I don't feel like jumping I jumped when I won't - huh just another day the 64 year old man was jumping rope with his Bank here and like brother cam said if I can jump rope with my grandkids I can talk for Jesus hallelujah I'm gonna tell this number let you go but I want you to realize even my son don't leave out here doubting it ain't got nothin to do with your mind has nothing to do with your feelings this go beyond that court it goes beyond this out of court it goes beyond the spirit which is the inner court it goes into the Holies of Holies and you can't thirst for God unless he put thirst in you and if the thirst is there he's there to fulfill it oh Jesus hallelujah can I say like this my walk with God has been getting good or angered and that old L thought he was gonna bind me up with a Corona he set me on fire you said what do you mean cuz I know demons no matter how powerful they are they are afraid of fire [Music] huh is that right that's what those Devils called leaders in law that's before they know so I will encourage you all of you your beautiful children your beautiful young people your beautiful God chose you you didn't choose him you don't even have to beg for it that's why I was trying to tell you thank you he's already giving it to you if I gave you a gift you would say please giving a gift please Laura please but you're begging for you say thank you lord thank you thank you for the gift thank you for the Holy Ghost I thank you Lord now I need you to do something for me grow up come to the full sketch of God in me change me O Lord change me O Lord you love the Lord o people of God it ain't difficult we've made it difficult sometimes we try to get the people in the atmosphere because listen fire don't mix with water neither does it mix with ice fire mix with fire in that right I was preaching years ago and I'ma give this brother camp and my young girl Clara at the time she said daddy I had a revelation I realize now what happened there in Babylon why they had to heat it up seven times hotter she said because that was the champa child that God could come in to and feel comfortable a child told me that and do you think God can come into a dead church the only way he can come into a dead church if the wood is dry and ready to be set afire ha ha ha ha yet he can't do it don't worry brothers and sisters you're not gonna be left behind there's too much power and too much prayer you understand me too much power and too much prayer God is something for you tonight but you've got to recognize he's done it I can tell you all night but you got to recognize that he did something for you too and you run with it and then you'll see the next time I come you might be dancing already you know that was lowered now thank the Lord for life I said then I got time to the truth system we're
