it's good to see the Saints in the house the Lord it's going to first Peter chapter 1 verse 2 like to continue looking at Christ as the mystery of God revealed this would be part 3 and then Lord willing tonight we'll look at part 4 so first Peter chapter 1 verse 2 Bible says elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied what a way to start a letter amen you are elect which the word elect means chosen you're chosen according to the foreknowledge of God and that is through being sanctified or washed of the Spirit unto us so when you're wash you can obey the Lord Amen and be sprinkled with the blood of Christ which we know sprinkling in the New Testament represents anointed connected to the Covenant how many glad to be connected to the covenant of Abraham Amen praise God go to Romans chapter 8 please verse 29 we'll just read one more this will be our last portion of text here and then I haven't had many quotes to show lately but I do have quotes to show today by God's graces haven't had the time I've had a little more time recently so Romans 8:29 by God's grace let's read this one together just verse 29 on three one two three four whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen how many want to be conformed to Christ image you want your life to be molded to be more like Christ to look like Christ's life looked on this earth let's just have a word of Prayer as we go before him and if you have that need just raise your hand or symbolize it some way to the Lord Heavenly Father we just bow our heads to you Lord God we we lift our hands to heaven O God as we know Solomon did when he dedicated the temple Lord he the Bible says he fell on his knees and lifted his hands to heaven Oh God and cried out to You Lord God and so Lord we're not Lord here at a natural temple dedicating a natural temple but we went our temples of our bodies to be freshly dedicated to you Lord God we went our our lives conform to your image shaped molded lured fastened the Lord to be more like you dear God mould us and shape us change us Oh God nor may we go from glory to glory from faith to faith little by little give us the victory Lord over every foe Lord in our body every temptation Lord every mind battle every disease every sickness Lord little by little give us the victory Lord and we'll certainly praise you and glorify you we're here to be sanctified we're here to be sprinkled or we're here Lorne according to the foreknowledge of God we ask that you speak to us here this morning father meet every need we pray we've lifted up many already but Lord for those we haven't lifted up we lift them up in the name of Jesus Oh God and may you be glorified in this service in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God and Malachi you can no or later you can switch over it's not the HDMI it's the VGA one so it's the different one like to look at that so I want to continue this little thought on Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in this message as I've been listening to it the last couple weeks this thought on predestination keeps coming up and so I like to deal with predestination election and foreknowledge this morning and tonight we'll look at revelation by the grace of God because those are the main themes that the Prophet teaches here as he preaches Christ the mystery of God revealed has anyone listening to it lately okay a couple half okay praise God amen so I trust up these things that will be said will be further strengthened and further edified to you by the grace of Lord I just couldn't seem to get away from it you know I had much study time all week I had a couple days off from work there I just couldn't get away from this I feel like the Holy Spirit's directing us here to teach this by the grace of the Lord praise God so just part of me here just a moment we like to look at this thought and it's been a while since I preached on predestination we looked a little bit at it on a Wednesday night in part two but let's look at Part three here today now I want to just start with these quotes that really inspired me as I've been listening to the Prophet preached this message he says now he said oh the great revelation now to restore back his kinship that's his family how many his kinship this morning to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin put them on free moral which he means agency he could not make them sin and remain God and then punished them for something he made them do how many how many thankful that God is a just God and this goes to us this applies to you and I this applies to sinners God cannot make you and I sin and then punish us for what something he made us do that's the beauty and the power of free more agency amen now when we make computers or we make machines we program and tell them what to do at least right now I know there's a lot of science fiction where they you know they give artificial intelligence to robots it and they can choose for themselves but but not so at least of yet but God was able to accomplish that because he's all-powerful he gave human beings free more agency where you choose whatever you desire and so God in this case if we look at we think about sinners like like Judas God didn't make Judas betray Jesus Judas wanted to do it it was his free more agency like Pharaoh in the days of Moses God didn't make him harden his heart but God knew he would harden his heart right God even sent him thus saith the Lord and told him what to do but he kept turning it down and so on the day of judgment no one will be able to look and say well you made me do it God will say no I gave you free more agency you could have chosen the good but you chose the evil of course so look at the bride we won't have to stand there in front of him we'll be sitting with him amen and I'll say these are the ones they meant that chose to do what's right and they are the same choice as you and I didn't force them but they chose me amen that's right if not they could say well you're an adjuster you forced me into this and I'm God to say I did not force I gave you the choice like everyone else and so he said God never just said well I'll choose this one and that one I'll choose a men and who an heir but I won't choose this one the center out on the street last night at the bar he didn't do that but he knew by reason the reason he could predestinate or predetermined was because he's infinite and so being infinite he knows everything he know the end it could tell the end from the beginning he's got if he can't do that he's not God yes sir he's infinite praise God so God didn't choose us because you know he liked our smile better than someone else's or he liked our our attitude or he thought we were just more handsome or more beautiful than someone else here God didn't show chooses by that God chose us by foreknowledge and so I want to just show the order from the Bible on his predestination how many believe your life has been predestined amen I believe mine has but there's actually something there's two steps that took place before God even predestinated all the events of your life there's two things that already took place the first that took place before predestination the first in that Mary took place was God foreknew the choice you would make and after God foresaw your choice then he could elect you or choose you and this is Scripture this is the Bible teaching this is not my idea this is not a new doctrine I'm just pulling the same Bible doctrine on the Bible and pointing it out to everybody because it was fresh to me it was an it was new I felt my this message Christ mister God revealed has given me more revelation on predestination that I had before praise God and I'm thankful for that and remember just a more simple way to explain that title is Jesus is God's mystery unveiled can I say like that God had a great mystery in his mind and that revealed mystery was Christ Christ was the mystery that God had been hiding for the four thousand years and when they saw Jesus they saw God's mystery amen and today when people see you as a real Christian they're seeing God's mystery of today revealed in front of them hallelujah amen that's right I know it's hard for us to believe because we fall short and we stumble we make mistakes but behind it all when you ask God to forgive you and then you get power to do what's right the next time and power for God to manifest his light through you you are the feeder of the hands of Christ you are the feed in Christ you're the very expression of the original interpretation of the Word of God you are God's thoughts Express they may Amen it's exactly right I know we don't feel like it looked like it and we wake up and we don't feel like it all the time but when we are walking in the spirit of course all the time but when we're walking in the spirit obeying the word of God we are shining the light to this dark world and people look at us and people see that we are real Christians they men truly manifesting Jesus Christ of this world so when we say yes God has predestinated in my life that's true but two things actually happened before that God had foreknowledge of your choice and then he chose you and he chose the time period you would live in a man either there we go we'll get to that we'll prove that by the Bible because all the disciples asked is this the time when when Israel is going to get ruling over at Rome and all these things and Jesus said it's not for you to know the times and seasons that God has placed in his hand amen the election is God choosing the age you would live in choosing when you would live choosing you for a certain calling whether a male for a certain calling as a man or a female certain calling imposition and gifts as a female God chose that aspect of it but that was after he saw that you would love him hey hallelujah but there says listen to this predestination looks back he said to election which is that's what he says he changed it he corrects the election an election looks back to foreknowledge and the church said I'm not making this up this is what the program taught God has predetermined here the events of your life for you to receive him and love him but before that he elected you or chose you and he chose you based upon his foreknowledge of if you would love him or not amen hallelujah and this is what the Bible said this was our taxi you are elected according to what what are you elected according to God's foreknowledge amen and I trust that the Holy Spirit will make this deep subject so simple that everybody can receive it this morning that doesn't have to say well I'm checking out brother disappear only 10 minutes in your sermon I'm checking out I can't catch this humble yourself each one of us should humble ourselves and say God make it so real to me that I can catch it help me to see how simple this is because it really is simple this doesn't have to be a deep thing in fact brother Branham says the Holy Spirit takes deep deep things that seem complicated and makes them so simple that's what I'm trusting the Holy Spirit would do for you this morning because if you can catch this revelation church it will make you live differently this has helped me live differently just in the last week or so because I'm in a mindset now it's the mindset that I'm living in and I've got that hopefully I can closer that it's the mindset that we're living in and that mindset drives every decision you make so see you are elected you were chosen based upon the foreknowledge of God and then of course you get sanctified by the spirit and then you obey the Word of God because you're sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ which is the anointing of the Holy Spirit you're connected member Moses had to sprinkle the people and join them to the Covenant you're under the Covenant of the law you're joined by the blood and so have you been anointed you're joined to the the New Testament the baptism of the Holy Ghost the covenant of grace a heavy not coming over but you're sprinkled for the covenant of grace in other words God God is going to give you grace God is going to keep his promise to you God is going to keep you under the New Testament amen because the Covenant means a promise he's going to keep his promise to you amen because his blood was shed for you his life was paid for you and you are connected to it you're sprinkled with it and it's part of you amen and you're a part of it amen so see election looks back to foreknowledge the Bible says and then we read in our other text for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate because God foreknew you he could predestinate the events of your life amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus he could predetermine praise God he could predetermine all the events of your life because he foreknew that you'd love him that's right and see according as he had chosen us in him so the choosing is the election that's actually what the word election means chosen you're chosen by God he has chosen us in him where in his mind before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love God loves us God's not upset with us does he get does he have to sometimes chasing us of course you have to sometimes correct your children yes but as the perfect love God doesn't get upset in and disappointed in us God loves us having he chose us having predestinated us unto the adoption of children so this is what God has ultimately predestinated you to to be adopted into his family amen glory hallelujah remember adoption was different adoption and those days just meant you had the full authority of the of your parents your name on the check was as good as your parents other words God that parents could could could you were responsible you were trustworthy with the parents resources and so does Christ today he we are trustworthy with the word with this spirit we just won't say thus saith the Lord we just won't guess about things we'll wait till we have something or we won't say nothing at all amen God's got to trust us with his word amen but this is what he's predetermined that we would be adopted and come to a place of maturity as a sudden daughter of Christ according to the good pleasure of his will so see God starts with foreknowledge god knows each person's final choice about Jesus Christ and free more agency he cannot punish sinners for making them sin so it has to start with his foreknowledge of whether they're going to accept or not and then comes the election god elects or chooses those he for knows will choose him God will not force anyone to serve him but yet he desires all would be saved but the Bible says many are called but few are chosen sees everybody they get the call they get the call but few are chosen or too few are elected because he knows those that will receive it and that those it won't and then because he's elected them he's chosen them out of each age then he predestinate their lives according to his purpose or his will amen you know I I think about this often you know I thought you know I really wish I could have been raised in the message I think about because I could have lived a holier life but you know sometimes we look back at our lives and think well I might have to wait till I was 19 to be saved why did I just serve God younger you know what I have to do this sir and we think about the events of our lives but but we have to understand that God has predetermined all the events in our lives God and think of this thing about saw will look at saw tonight the Saint Paul god had to let him learn all these Jewish memorization and Jewish facts and details about ceremonial laws by the Amen that later he would all forget and say they're done God let him spend years and years and years memorizing beating his body he said I was zealous I was the muhib room Hebrews I was the most zealous of all of them and God let him beat himself and memorize all these denominational lies for years and years and years and God just let it go because God was not in any hurry God had predestinated a Damascus Road experience for him and God had to let them experience all these years and decades of all this there's this human training in order that when he got saved he would be a real fireball for Christ amen because he would know I've spent all these years under my own human ability I've given my life and my energy I've given everything in this false system but now I found life amen and now I can devote myself fully to the true and living God's purpose now I can look in a real living message the message of the hour and now I live differently because of what I experienced they know and the Bible said that Paul labored more than all the Apostles who actually walked with Jesus he spent more I'm praying he spent more time preaching he spent more time traveling than all the Apostles and he never even saw Jesus in a flesh body he just saw him in a pillar of fire ha ha ha amen and that beautiful his testimony had to be different God allowed him all these things and he cannot and he he might have thought you know for a while why did I have to stand there and watch Stephen died he had to do it because he had to know the sufferings he had to he had to experience that so he would know the sufferings Christians went through that he himself could suffer and learn to be like Christ amen hallelujah and he had to have those memories of of being a part of the martyrs and dragging people off to jail and trying to get them to blaspheme in order service motivation that he will work even harder than that as hard as he worked for the devil they used God love that that be his motivation to work harder for Christ amen hallelujah amen thank the Lord so church we have to we have to just trust how many trust that God predestinated everything at the right time in your life amen it's his purpose and his will the timing was perfect like with Moses 40 years you would have thought he's 40 years old I'm almost 40 I'm 38 you would have thought Moses I'm 40 I'm ready to take Israel out and God said no I've got to take 40 years and beat all that Audia you cannot trust and your hue and your human military organizational skills you can't trust even in your physical strength you can't trust in your youth you've got to trust only a one thing thus saith the Lord from the Holy Spirit that's the same thing we've got to trust in amen we've got to learn to trust in the Word of God from the Holy Spirit and it will never fail amen you'll never pass away hallelujah amen but see we might write our stories differently but God is the great author and I like what brother Troy said he's coming back in junior but like we said God only wrote one book and it was called life the book of life amen and God orchestrated our lives for his purpose and for his glory so here's the one I already read and then I read this one now I'm sure I have I read this one on Wednesday he put man on partnership with him that let that man act as a free more Asian the same thing he's got you on today did you know God wants to be partner with you has anyone ever done to a partner business here I've never have but it takes a lot of confidence if we're gonna have a partnership in a business well you've all made many of you have taken a partnership in marriage that's good praise the Lord for that but God Berlin says the way we understand our relationship with God is that he makes us partners he's not forcing us well you've got to work for me Jesse you've got to work for me Tonya you've got to work for me bang no he's not forcing you into this he said if you want to be a part of this you're welcome to be a part of this and how many glad you sign the dotted line amen I sign the dotted line but the contract was already signed with the blood of Jesus Christ amen I just sighed and said I believe that amen same thing he's got you on today for your more agency you can act any way you want to you're free more agent so therefore if we put the first like that he has to put the second like that yes but everybody like that or he acted wrong in the first place but everybody is on the same basis and the church said Adolph Hitler was on the same basis right he lived in the 40s so did brother Branham during the world war they're both alive they're on the same basis they both could have choosen to chose right and wrong but we know Adolf Hitler chose the tree of knowledge of good and evil and brother Ram chose the tree of life amen they're both on the same basis just like Adam and Eve we both have a choice today you have the same choices today either partake of life or partake of the knowledge of good and evil let us partake of Christ our life amen and this is one I wrote to her god never said I'll just choose that what I'll choose that one God chooses his people by foreknowledge not by his desire buh-bam says by his foreknowledge he predestinated these things that happen he chooses his own person by his foreknowledge not by his discrimination you know he doesn't discriminate I'm choosing more blacks and whites or I'm choosing more Asians and blacks or and it's not by that it's by foreknowledge hey man like he said in Romans 9 he says with Esau and Jacob both born the holy parents and twins that the election might stand sure and he said I hated Esau and Jacob have I loved before either boy was born he knows what's in man he knowed it from the beginning what it was there for he could make everything work just exactly on clock time we get all nervous and frustrated you never seen him frustrated they don't see everything's working all right just exactly the clocks tickin let me say let me remind you my mother said the rapture will not be one second late amen if you go on the rapture you won't be late for you won't be early for you'll be right on time amen because God has predestinated all these events he's all lined them up the clock's ticking perfectly in other words the bride of Jesus Christ is right where she needs to be there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus she's right where she needs to be she's finishing the Great Commission and God is making her more into his own image of his son amen he knows what's in man he knows what's in your heart this morning I'm glad he knows what's in my heart amen because I'm not hiding he sins in my heart if I sin I say God forgive me I want my heart to be pure please God now here's this this is gonna help us God know the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything I know what they're gonna choose I know what that one's gonna choose I know it's in their heart okay so I'll plan this like this he said that it would just work out for his glory and that gives us what courage now here's what I said on Wednesday I said most people in the message or we say most people in churches they get lazy on God because they hear so much that God loves them God loves them and they're saved and they're saved but see predestinated predestination to me doesn't make me lazy it actually makes me want to work more for Christ because brother Branham said it gives you courage to know that no matter what comes or goes God is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time so so often people take that attitude well if I'm gonna go in the rapture I'll be there there's nothing I can do about it no there is something you can do about it jesus said the Holy Ghost is like water and he said him that's thirsty come let him drink of the Living Waters of life whosoever will then drink of the lawyers of life freely everybody's offered the Holy Ghost we've just got to reach out and confess all of our sins and make our way push our way elbow only to that whale and drink of the whale everybody can make it there you've just got to do it amen you just gotta want it you'll see this doesn't make us lazy it makes us courageous no matter what comes or goes God planned everything and in every situation I know what to do keep the word this ain't rocket science I know God has ordained everything in my life and in every situation I also go through it look at the situation and say what would Jesus do what would the word do what does the word say about this and I promise you Church I believe it's true if you'll pray about it long enough when you've got two choices I believe God will show you the clearest choice camisa can say like this he'll show you the perfect choice because the Bible said you can prove the perfect will of God sometimes we get weary and upset don't we Church thank God first forgiveness we get hastily well that's me right there I just want I want to get everything done right now let's get this whole series done took this morning you know I'll preach for hours he said oh we think we must do this or must do that remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it all has to be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his knowledge God doesn't predestinate my desire because he's not willing that any should perish if you listen to Wednesday's service I ended the service with three scriptures that show God does not delight in wicked people perishing God wasn't shouting yes we're so happy that Sodom and Gomorrah was burnt the Bible said God doesn't rejoice in that he has to do it as a just judge but he doesn't get pleasure in that and the brother says he's not willing God doesn't want anyone to perish by his foreknowledge he knew who would accept and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big-time clock that's ticking away and he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day and he knew that this would be our day whose day is this your day hey man it's been a but man said he had plans for this day he had plans for every day and never as one of his plans ever failed he's always on time I just want to encourage you that God's plans for your life cannot fail amen they can't fail amen if he's brought you this for the Bible said he's faithful and just to finish the work that he started amen his word can't fail we've got to make sure our minds and our attitudes don't fail that's what we've got to make sure because his plans and his ways will never fail but we've got to make sure we keep our minds right according to the Word of God never has his plans ever failed he was always on time when our names was placed on the blast book of life when when the lamb was slain before the foundation of world the mind of God when God was Jehovah ll ah Elohim the self-existent one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside this diamond his a tribute was a savior in his attributes on the inside of him he was the healer well there's been nothing to save and nothing to heal but his attributes produced it so then before the foundation of the world when he knowed that that the great display in here of him that he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt among us and he know by His stripes we'd be healed he slay the lamb on his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name on that book before the foundation of the world oh my because God foreknew he could choose and he could predestinate and where'd he do it he wrote it down in the book of life amen hallelujah it's exactly right remember your name is on that book because Jesus said those that don't repent I'll block their name off the book your names on that book the name of Jesse Smith from the Laodicean Church age is on that book and I believe it's written in blood red ink amen hallelujah shows yours because we we how do you know because our lives long for the word our lives express the word all eyes love the word our lives speak of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we don't deny one word that's written in this book praise God which every other Church in denomination do right they pick and choose and they let people be sinners and call them Saints when they're not in order to be a saint you've got to be sanctified that's what our scripture said the beginning you got to be sanctified by the Spirit amen then you're a saint praise God what have said listen to this are you listening predestination look back to for now I mentioned this earlier and I mean election election looks back to for now it's predestination looks the destiny now destiny is a part of predestination so that's why I didn't put that on the previous slide I believe it's the same thing because predestination destiny is right in predestination don't forget that that election looks back here now brother random corrects this later but look what he says he's trying to just show an illustration he said I was a cocklebur which is like a thorny bush I was born in sin shaped iniquity come the world speaking lies born among sinners father and mother all my whole life family sinners I was the cocklebur but all of a sudden I became a wheat grain brother lamb corrects us later he says how happened what is that election in other words you used to be a sinner but at some point you became a Christian praise God now but Rev said God before the foundation world elected that the kokuboro was to become a grain of wheat now he's going to correct that because you can't change the seed so he fixes us later on his message you can't change the seat in fact whatever seeds inside of you and you were born or before you're born that seeds still manifesting today amen whatever that just proves to me that I always wanted to serve God even though I didn't know about the message if I if I could have heard it I would have believed it amen even as a child because I believe it now and the seed inside of me is proving that I believe the word I believe the message so that seed was always deep down inside of me praise God amen and no man put it there but God put it there big man how do it know I know I'm a great a week because I'm saying how do I do it look back and see that he has predestinated it a long time ago bye for now this is the quarrel of by foreknowledge he's seen that I would love him hallelujah so he made a propitiation through his own son that through him I might be coming from a kokuboro to a grain of wheat now where may I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God so God in his mind looked down through all the timelines or can you think of the timelines of our history through this six thousand years god looked down and saw who will love me and so he started out the beginning with Adam and Eve and he saw had him and he would love him and he saw that Cain would not love him praise God but he saw Abel would love him so he revealed to Abel that you need to bring a sacrifice of blood because he knew Abel would love him but then Cain was given the same instruction and Kate said I'm not gonna do all that messy stuff I'm not gonna shout and dancing speak in tongues and and cry and weep and snot the altar I'm not going to do that but God offered it to him and both Cain and Abel manifested this seed that was inside the true seed of God gladly obeyed the word and died for the word with the seed of the enemy the seed of the serpent hated the word disrespected it walked away from it murdered his brother but God foreknew that he saw Abel would love him and Abel would love the blood so do you and I love the blood I know yeah so do we love the blood of Jesus Christ today amen he's seen that I would love him so he made a propitiation through his own son so God was looking who is gonna in the free moral agency who is gonna choose to love me and I thought that before I got married I said wonder who's gonna be my wife I wonder who will just I don't want to force a woman to love me you better love me and you better not divorce me I didn't want to force somebody I wanted someone to freely choose to love me I'm thankful my wife does amen that's why we don't like those arranged marriages that some cultures doing some people because they'll get people together that that don't love each other by the free moral agency and God were the same thing he said I like somebody who loved me but they've said God did not plan his Redemption say well perhaps somebody will love me so I'll send my son Jesus but I've said God does not do his business like that remember I said you don't either when you can start a business you don't think well maybe this business will work before you start that business you know it's going to work you know there's a need for that for that service or that product whatever you're producing whether it's apples or whatever it is I know people need apples and so I'm investing in a wise decision I know there's a need and that's how God did God said I know and lanta see yeah there's going to be some people in Akron Ohio that will love I'm not just gonna guess and maybe there's somebody over in Akron or maybe there's somebody in over there in Ohio that is serving to hope somebody loves me he didn't hope so he knew so amen and because of that he ordained the events of your life to come across the light of the hour and when the light and water flashed upon that see it got born again amen and they came to life hallelujah because he said I know he'll love me I know he won't serve me by legalism I know she won't serve me by fear just sure she'll serve me because she loves me she trusts my word that's the kind of woman I'm looking for someone that will love me because they really do hey men most church members have served God because they like all the blessings of God they don't they don't really like his character and what is this character what is it about you and I that love God about his character it's the fact that his character is true that is the one outstanding characteristics of God that makes us love what is it about God jesus said sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth they know what is it about God that we love the server because we know this is the truth of God we know God's sure he's not a man that he should lie every other man or church or denomination or woman will lie but God will not lie and that's ultimately why we love God because the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Truth how do you know praise God hey man I'm feeling good this morning praise God let me send my time for one thing about it now Birmingham corrects is later so brother kept saying I used to be a thorn see but now I'm a wheat see he corrects it later and he says you never were a pig turned into a sheep you always were she amen see brother he corrects that hold this carefully in mine now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood back his own he bought back the spoken word seed brought my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a bigger dog turning the Sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there's no change in your species yeah yeah don't get me wrong I've talked to people they say I never understood why God likens his people to cheaper it seems so strange because they said I've met some really ornery sheep well so have you in fact you used to be a pretty ornery sheep just ask your parents or ask your brothers and sisters ask your church friends before you got the Holy Ghost you're pretty ornery right there's some there's some sheep that are not so nice and so see that's how it is that's how it is with God before you realize you were sheep you might have acted like a goat but that didn't change the fact that deep down inside of you you were a sheep you just weren't acting like it and so it is today thank God finally acting like what you are amen so they gather this morning I can finally act like what I am a Holy Ghost no Christian who is born let's say more on the day of Pentecost I can find the act like that how do I know your praise God all those other years that act off staunch and religious prayers guard to the Creed and all these I believe the Trinity the Father Son and one three persons all this nonsense like that I can finally act like what I am a born-again son of God amen because he whom the Sun has set free is free indeed hallelujah can finally act like what I am thank the Lord well bro Graham says it's impossible for you to be a go and then be a sheep remember on the day of the judgment God's gonna separate the sheep from the goats because they always were goes because that was the seed inside of him as we were expressing the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice became aware of our Father calling us and recognized that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me Oh father I'm returning to thee so the story of redemption is plainly seen through the prodigal son is that right now what it just show three clips scriptures here and Haven kind of touched my heart yesterday so go to go to Luke 15 we're listening to an audio drama a Lamplighter audio German and they're telling a story of the great Shepherd and Haven said in the Banshees like Daddy is that in the Bible and my heart I felt so bad I'm like I haven't preached on that my daughter didn't know that was in the Bible remember in Haman did you say that or was a Karass it was you I thought that was so spiritual I thought well maybe she don't remember me preaching it but I'm gonna preach it again tomorrow so go to Luke 15 1 to 7 so see the prodigal son was always a son but he was acting like a pig you say he was yes he was eating pig food just like used to eat pig food all those pig songs just listened to all those pig movies used to watch hello Church all that pig language used to talk your ongoing coins and your blankety-blank sand curse on this one curse on that one that was pig food but now you're feasting on eco food amen how do I know how I don't know how we live for that long on Pig food but we did that's right but now we have a different day praise God so Haven here you go Luke 15 verse 1 then drew near and him all the Republicans and sinners 40 here and the Pharisees the scribes murmur saying this man receives sinners he eateth with them and he spake this every one of them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them do not leave the ninety-nine in the wood earnest and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he found it he layeth on his shoulders rejoicing and when he come home he called together his friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for I found my sheep which I which was lost I saying to you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which received repentance you see this type here the ninety-nine are tied to Israel the Gentile bride is this sheet that he throws on his shoulders because the Bible said the the Shepherd left them out in the learnis and if you turn your Bibles you don't have to but if you read revelation 12 that woman that was being chased by the dragon she was chased for three and a half years out into the wilderness that's the last half of Daniels 70th week that's the Tribulation Period so Jesus leaves the Jews to go just stay there for the the three to have your tribulation but he finds his little bride sheep there's one out of a hundred amen his special one his little lost sheep he goes up and binds that little nurse Wilson glory to God I've left the 99 that Jews rejected me but I'm bringing home the Gentile fraud amen I'll bring it at home and she's on the strongest part of Christ on his shoulders amen we're the strongest place of Christ while his shoulders one is strength because their strength in his word amen hallelujah I notice he didn't go back to the word is with the Sheep he went home ha ha oh and we're going home to the murdered supper of the Lamb amen hallelujah he didn't take the Sheep back to the warners well the bride can go through tribulation to enjoy the tribulation he took us to heaven amen he packed us all the way to glory as an Angels let's rejoice the mayors of the lamb has come and the Sheep has made himself ready amen hallelujah there you go Haven the lost sheep was always a sheep I knew you you were one of God's little sheep dear he finds you put you on his shoulders and this sheeps gonna be safe this sheep is in good hands do you think all it all say has good hands Jesus Christ has better hands in all state you're in better hands with Jesus Christ you're in better hands with the nail-scarred hands not an area because those are tried and true that those hands have conquered death hell and the grave and have overcome amen all state never conquered even a tornado they clean up after the tornado I'll say don't come in and stop the tornado they come to salvage the damage but Jesus Christ defeated death the Bible said he's stoked on the Serpent's head and now death is nothing but a messenger to take you to the presence of God amen hallelujah now Herbert lives say last week somebody asked me on the overseas they asked me how could how could the Witch of Endor call up Samuel from paradise and I'd forgot to go look it up because members saw Saul went over said I can't hear from God I can't hear from the Urim Thummim I can't hear from a prophets I can't hear from Noah I'm cut off from God so his last resort was to go to a witch and he disguised himself and he said bring me up Samuel and she said promise me that you won't have me killed it I promise he said in the name of the Lord I promise to do something abominable then he protected her with the name of the Lord see how he how merciful God this church even in his most backslidden state God was still gonna save saw but saw by his own freemore agency got that hatred spirit on him got that murderous spirit I just want to kill him I just can't I hate him I can't stand him I'll chase him down I'll do whatever I can to kill him but God still save the man oh thank god there's hope for people today but if you know this Saul said just call him up and the Bible said the witch did her chapman's whatever and pretty soon she screamed she said I can't even scream my voice is all gone he said what do you see the Bob said he fell down to the ground what do you see she said I see God's coming up out of the earth god's little creators amen hallelujah samuel was a little creator amen you and i are little creators when we receive god's revelation and speak god revelation it creates something amen we've seen a lately create healing for people glory we've seen it creates a vation for people we've seen the world live create a different atmosphere in the church hopefully a different atmosphere in your home Amen I don't know yeah cuz your little gags your little creators who take what's been revealed and you speak God's Word and then it happens amen she said I see God's coming up out of the earth and then Samuel starts talking but man said the reason she could do that the reason that she had a power to access souls in the heart of the earth is because they were not in heaven they were in the middle of the earth and they were not in God's presence and we sang about where are you safe in God's presence so before the blood of Jesus Christ sorcerers could go down and contact you people's souls bring them up because they weren't protected by the Holy Spirit but now through the blood of Jesus Christ it's all changed they had the blood of Jesus Christ has traded a forcefield has treated protection is creative strength time so no demon or no demon power can access the soul that's gone beyond the current of time because the blood of Jesus Christ the Spirit of Jesus Christ now protects them amen hallelujah and now those Souls go to that sixth dimension where there's God's holy presence and the demons try to get in there how can we access our can we access Paul can we access and the Holy Spirit shuts them down I said you're not bothering them you're not touching them they're protected by the blood oh I'm so thankful to be under the blood church hallelujah Galatians 4:6 I'm sorry I get it I was gonna say pull that up don't you appreciate the Word of God oh my the Bible has all the answers we just gotta wait on it praise the Lord Galatians 4:6 so see the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed so that demon power could bring up Souls but now that the blood has been shed it's forgiven them they've all left the heart of the earth and now they're in God's presence that is thrown in that sixth dimension praise God so Satan can't touch him anymore hallelujah he's lost his power he's been stripped of all his rights amen because jesus paid the price Jesus bought him with his own blood he paid the ransom he paid off the debt he that's what we all want right we all want to see our debts paid off well Jesus Christ at Burnett he paid our sin-debt soph amen well the RAM cause Galatians 4:6 is the triumphal capstone of the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the capstone that that caps it all off so in order to finish the teaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the capstone that must come down upon your thinking as I've been preaching and read and praying and serving God all these years I've seen that capstone come down upon my life idea and it's capped off my life hallelujah it's capped off my soul and now I know why I could be born again it's because I already was a son I just didn't realize it because your sons God has sent forth the spirit of God into your hearts crying Abba Father so because you are a son you could receive the Holy Spirit this is the capstone because you were for know because God knew you'd want it amen because God knew you want to be sealed with the love of God and not the love of the world because you a son or daughter God sent his spirit into your soul Amen hallelujah and that's the capstone that caps it off in other words I was the son of God haha is yours where daughter of God and so II this had to happen the thing you desire the thing you want all these years it had to happen because you always wanna shape of God amen you A's were a son or daughter of God it was just a matter of time I think this is what bothers us a lot right waiting on the time when is this gonna happen when is this gonna happen God's clock is ticking right on time sometimes we're like God can you check and see if your batteries ran out on your clock up there I prayed for this 10 years ago where's it at now his batteries don't run they're their eternal batteries they don't run out of charge like I got to keep these under here in case I just put him in a bag his other bag rip I got these batteries in here I got these batteries you know these God's not like oh oh the rapture is like oh let me put this back in let me put these batteries in let me take out the old ones God put them in there before the foundation world and they're clicking right on time and we must not be discouraged we must trust that God has a time and season for everything all those Saints had to have died shed their blood and suffer persecution and we've just got the only thing we've got two battles the lust of the flesh and riches and and a life they had to there to battle being taken to the stake there is being burned down we've got a battle spending too much time on our phone or giving our money to things of the world that we shouldn't give our money to or spread or just choosing the wrong person to spend time with or live our lives or there's somebody that we have such a different we say a more easy battle physically spiritually it's the greatest battle ever fought because it's the greatest Age of deception but that's why God looks at the Church of Laodicea and it makes him throw up not the bride the church because they say they're rich and increased with Goods they say we've got the Holy Ghost these they say we go this money and they don't want any more of God I hope there's somebody here that wants more of God they might is this that if you are content with how much God you have you're officially Laodicean lukewarm because there are the ones who said I don't have no more need of God look at look at look at all that I've done I don't have to have to do anything more I've got enough of God I don't need anymore that's a Laodicean spirit you better pray to that gets cast off you exactly I gotta cast off about every day don't you church every day you gotta cast down anything that results itself against the knowledge of God now here's where we gotta understand this is the one thing that's you know it's stuck in my mind jesus said you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it to you to see I believe church this is referring to Jesus choosing their specific ministries and their age in history because again Jesus can't jesus can't force them to serve him and say okay now you overcome your the overcomer he forced if he did that he forced them to do it are with me church they can't force you God can't force you like mother and said God can't put you all the way through the piping so you did it congratulations you did an awesome job you'd be like well you pushed me through you forced me to do it so you must understand this in light of foreknowledge Jesus's said I'm choosing you this time in season the Bible said Jesus called 12 and he chose them and called them up to a mountain are you with me that's what this is speaking of Jesus chose them in time but God in His foreknowledge already knew that they would love him amen I know yeah that's right Church you can't make one contradict the other either God looked at our choice our free moral agency choice either God looked at that or God said I'm forcing bang to serve me he has no choice in the matter well now that's not free more agency anymore now it's God's agency choosing you enforcing you're gonna do something does everyone understand so this refers to the time they lived and I chose you I called you in this time but it's based upon what I saw you choose in my mind before the foundation of the world that's right Church that's the only way we can understand it because remember the Bible said this is the day of Pentecost now I'm going to skip down because of time I want to try to finish here Jesus was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God so God chose when Jesus would be delivered to the Romans and the Jews and they would crucify him at the ragazze that time Kasim Emer purpose the determinate counsel or purpose of God God predestinated the time Jesus will be crucified I love this Jesus that he tells us John and James's mother he says you shall need drink a mic and D drink of my cup and be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with glory the Holy Ghost but to sit on my right hand on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it was prepared of my father see even Jesus can't guarantees Ebony's wife he can't guarantee that James and John will sit on the right hand because he said that's up to the Eternal Spirit that's up to the Father what he has prepared or what he's predestinated in his plan see even Jesus flesh didn't know all the plans of God in his flesh now that's where we look at tonight Jesus flesh and revelation I love this right before the day of Pentecost they said Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel and he said is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put us in his own power to see after for knowing our choices he determines the times and seasons of our manifestation hallelujah so here's the order of your manifestation if you want to see the church Jesus went from thought to theophany Melchizedek - flesh body on the earth and now he's in a glorified body but RAM said we're different we went from thought he said we bypassed our theophany we went from the thought of God to flesh body after we die though we going off the Alpha knee unless the rapture comes because then if the rapture comes that fee alpha knee come down and our flesh body be swung up in the glorified body and the glorified body will meet the theophany because the Bible said the theophany is before the throne of God in heaven amen other data that's right that's why I feel that's why you feel connected to your body that's why you know you take care of your body because one day God's gonna make this body brand new praise God there's a few pieces of bull missing from the shoulder but guess what they're not gone God's gonna get back to me I there's a few hairs missing from this head but believes that God is gonna bring every single one right back to us amen wherever they live beforehand that's where they're waiting for me right now but God's gonna bring them all back amen because it's part of his perfect creation and God redeems everything that is lost so if we I will go to through our theophany this flush body will drop will go to our theophany at the rapture all that theophany will come down and the the Holy Spirit will rise up that that flesh body change it to glorified and we'll meet in the air at the rapture hallelujah now says the bride was already this mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God the eternal are they not so where are you before you're in this body you were actually in the mind of God he's omniscient he never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts always had and always will have he knows him from the beginning thus the thoughts have got our eternal they're real so there's a part of you that is an eternal thought of God and that's your soul Amen this flesh it is that eternal your human mind up and down tired right got thoughts bad thoughts that's not eternal but that's so that life that point of view that's quickened by the Spirit of God that's eternal and that came from the mind of God Oh hallelujah they're not just like a man with a blueprint that job up in one day be translating to real substance they already are real and they're eternal and a part of God we can't catch you yet can we church one day we'll catch it one day I'll catch it one day you'll get you and I think the rapture is gonna take place after that but notice Bible said it is not the person that comes free destinated from God it's the word or seed so see this proves there was no pre-existence of souls you and I were not singing in heaven you know before we come down to earth because it's not the person that comes from God it's the thought that comes from God now I know there's a Motum says we were the sons of God shouting for joy I believe that was actually angels and I sure that was then couple years ago we're talking about that because the Bible said when Satan presented himself before the Lord all the sons of God came to present themselves as well so I believe that had to be angels I know angels are not called sons but it seems like the King James translators may be mistranslated that something like that but you get the same idea you get the same idea Satan was a fallen angel of God and he had to come present himself before the Lord and the Lord asked him where you were so he must've been asking all those angels where they weren't what were they doing were they been up to but brother have says you are not a person pre-existing before you came here you were in the mind of God see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had this seed that is why he had respected the birthright in the coming of God I love this if you are a true seed you will hear that word I'm talking about this word well preaching that we call the message of God if you are seed you receive the Word of God the Spirit will baptize you in the body of Christ filling you with empowering you and you'll receive the word for your day and age see how clear the trevin's becomes when the revealed word is revealed in you ha ha ha oh it's so clear what is the heavens evidence the Holy Ghost it's someone who can receive and live the Word of God for your day that's the evidence it's always been the evidence whoever manifested God's message for that hour that was the evidence that they had the Holy Ghost advanced remember your eyes or statue your eyes your statue whatever you were you were just thinking at the beginning the only thing that you are is the expression of the word and after he thought he spoke it and hurt here you are so he had to speak so when I was born in that cold November day in 1980 my mom didn't hear my dad didn't hear it but Jesus spoke instead let Jesse Smith receive the breath of life and the spoken word of God let him be born on November 17 1980 I think was 12:10 p.m. let him bring forth I'm expressing his name then pretty soon put him on the nurse get him nursing God it had to express but you and I didn't I didn't know that I didn't even know I was a child of God at that time oh I didn't know anything but now I can look back and see that was when God one to express my my person my manifestation my seed his thought I wouldn't Express Jesse Smith in this by the thought of him in this day and age and so that's when I came forth same things true for you church you're just an expression of the word to see your thought then you came flesh body you weren't existing and worshiping in heaven you know praising the Lord having a good time in heaven you were a thought then you came to flesh see your name was ordained of God and place on the book of life before the foundation work you were there and as that's roots you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you're part of God when you become a son or daughter of God just as you're part of your earthly father who remembers being your dad they don't any on any of you before you're born you remember being in your dad no well Graham said that's the same way it is with God you don't remember it because you can't remember it you weren't expressed yet but you were a seed waiting to be expressed the male carries the hemoglobin the blood and when the when that has gone the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother's a part of your father also so you're all part of your father now we see the attributes sons of a spirit have not yet entered in the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body so listen let me go back to that thought of job if you believe you were in heaven shouting when the world was founded what body were you in there's only three bodies but the man says you did not enter into the theophany yet let takes it down to two you were not in your flesh body yet because that wasn't here oh that was part of the dust of the earth and that only leaves your glorified body but a glorified body is only a brand-new version an eternal version of your flesh body because those who are tied together so that takes away all of them that means it wasn't you that means it was the Angels shouting at the foundation of world because you've not yet entered into theophany but now that your honor you've heard from your theophany have you heard I've got internal body somewhere I want to live in a perfect body the Bible calls it your eternal hole in the heavens amen I've heard from my other home when this body drops my soul will go to that other home the other temple that's the Alpha knee brother man says I've never entered that's theophany yet doesn't corner Bertram's teaching you can't place sons and daughters of God there's theophany saying shouting the earth is being formed you can't do that because you haven't even entered into that theophany yet but you can believe whatever you want it's not it's not a doctrine to divide us I'm just trying to show you the truth of the word of God Rahab said later we learned we never heard no more about Kelsey because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest that became Jesus Christ and now you are bypassed that because in that form he knows all things and you never have been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you came from the attribute to the flesh and the church said to be tempted why did he do this so you could be tempted but man says if you were to went through your theophany first you were to remembered it and then you would have been easier able to overcome all the temptations the world because you already knew about it oh I know when I'm 18 I'm at the bat off that demon spirit of lust when I'm 15 I enough to battle off that hatred spirit you would know her everything about it because you already had the perfect foreknowledge of that body but brother have said God made you bypass that so you could stand as a free more agent amen you could stand there in the middle of fight with the full armor of God on and you don't know what's coming next all's you know is you're ready to fight the devil a man but if you're in under your throughout free you wouldn't look like almost go to sleep but just cut off all the enemies we'll just my god you see y'all then you would have known everything but now you gonna stand on guard you can't get lazy and you gotta look for Saint behind every corner you got to make sure you don't sneak into your life somehow you got to be ready to lunch at your post of duty Jesus said if you want to go the rapture you better watch and pray man we can't be lazy as Christians because we never entered into our theophany we don't know what's gonna come in 2019 we don't know the trials who would have thought in 2018 we would have lost all these people from the message who would have predicted that not me imagine being me I've had people that left the message tell me it the very reason they left was because of me because of what I preached and I'd be the guy make a decision am I gonna compromise and say I'm sorry you know I would you come back to the church I gotta say well that's your choice but I'm standing on the state the Lord I've chosen the latter just so you know I haven't begged anybody to come back here I don't want to beg anybody here because I know father he'll draw people here they'll draw whoever supposed to be here it's part of his plan it's predestinated he'll make sure they're here amen hallelujah I've got a bag and proselyte and denominator or anything like that all that the father's give me in Akron will come to me in Akron that's what he promised see clear makes it clear you will never be the way unless you as a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first see but in order to stem temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all of that the father's give me will come to me and I'll raise them but the last days let me close to this here I'm going to go real fast how many understand the power of free moorings do you understand how powerful your choices you can make today are they're so powerful they may impact eternity that's right the choices you make today in your life in the next weeks and months and years the choices you make will impact your eternity remember Joshua told them he already got most of the inhabitants kicked out and he said choose you this day whom you will serve make a choice it's your free more agency you want to be victorious or doing a compromise with idols you know Jesus was called a manual a virgin shall conceive he'll be manual butter and honey shall you eat that he may know how to refuse the evil and choose the good Oh hallelujah so Jesus his diet brother amen would help him to choose the right thing ha ha ha because he was choosing the spiritual butter and the spiritual honey of God's Word because of that he refused evil and he chose good same thing for you if you eat the the butter and the honey you'll choose the right thing to do that's what the Bible says about Emanuel virgin shall conceive he's gonna choose good because of what he eats I'm glad I'm feasting on the Word of God today and not some denomination or some live from the pit of hell like three persons look at this God promised even the eunuchs now saith the Lord on the eunuchs that keep my Sabbath and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant even unto them when I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than the sons and of the daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off all based upon what your choice whatever you choose based upon your choosing will be your reward remember the Bible says be not deceived God is not mocked you'll reap whatever you sow whoever you whoever you serve whatever you do is based upon who you yield to I let God have his way or I let sin have its way we have to yield to the Holy Spirit jesus said those in Sardis will be worthy because they've not defiled they chose not to defile themselves in sinful garments so Jesus says you're worthy that's how Jesus can say you're worthy is because you chose it you had right and wrong before you and you chose I'm choosing the right and so Jesus says you're worthy let's turn our feet let me close with this I posted this on I think Facebook this is this morning at five fifty five fifty one a.m. I think it was I love getting up early church I love it I said quiet time with Jesus it's you can't beat it I love getting up and staying the word and meditating upon the word when brother and preach marriage and divorce he was wearing cufflinks or what they call cufflinks like these but they're not cufflinks these are just buttons but he had cufflinks on his and they had over they're white and they had a red stripe down the middle he said it reminded him of the blood of Jesus Christ and he got him from Danny Henry which two years previously after brother ham preached a sermon came up and laid his hands on him and said brother brand not to be sacrilegious but that sermon could have been the 23rd chapter of Revelation which brother man said that's quite a compliment and the boy know nothing about it his arms around me and started speaking in an unknown language for people that spoke French come up and interpret it and they all interpreted the same romance and write it down right even down the punctuation make sure all four said the same thing and brother Graham said I want to read it to you how many want to read it today what the holy spirit said it was a prophecy to brother Branham what is God rewarding him for God's rewarding him for his choices and listen Church God's gonna reward you and I based upon our choices are free more agency I think sometimes we forget how important is just to make the right choice the Holy Spirit said by foot people with the state the Lord because thou has chosen the narrow path are you choosing the easier path or the harder path we want to choose the way of God which is always the harder path it's always harder to follow God's will the harder way thou hast walked in your own choosing God didn't force brother Branham to do this God didn't force David to slay Goliath he led him to do it but he didn't force him he had to make that choice thou has picked the correct and precise decision he said and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee for the glorious decision thou hast made this I love this because this this is where you and I come in right here hahaha this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see it what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is God's love God's Spirit down in your soul and because brother Ram chose to preached the baptism Holy Ghost without compromise it would bring a great victory in the life of every bride member oh thank you Lord Jesus because you chose I didn't force you I gave you the choice you make the decision I'm giving you the tree of life or the tree of knowledge good evil you make the choice God didn't force brother Ram you've got to do this but I said like this God taught brother Ram you better obey the Word of God like in South Africa I forgot that it went there and got there phoebus God taught him a pretty good lesson how many know God has taught you some pretty good lessons through the things which you've suffered I think he I think it was out preaching for a whole year he was out with amoebas in his stomach God reminding him God teaching him don't bow to organisations don't give in to creeds and and politics among preachers just lead or follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost and you know think about that every day in pain for a whole year but jesus said the reward will be great if you choose the harder way it was a prophecy it was prophesying foretelling that a huge portion of heaven await and I remember remember I read this a few weeks ago well I shouldn't say weeks months here's what brother Branham called his ministry I'm so thankful that we just past Thanksgiving that God Almighty if it be that way has let me do a little something in my uneducated condition to show my appreciation for of his love to me my love to him and to our love to the people what does this all go back to love remember I showed you the Cobra Ram said God thought back who's gonna love me in 6,000 years and they oughta see ya and he saw you raise your hand at one meeting someday or you coming I remember a man coming to the altar and crying at the I remember that day oh honey yeah I remember that day for me crying with my hands up saying thank you forgive me Lord I want to be a Christian I remember that day God force on said oh yeah he'll love me she'll choose me and then God leads us and guides us and at the end of the road we'll say thank you Lord that I could show my love to you with the ministry you gave me hummer thankful for God's ministry that he gave you how many one be faithful of that ministry if you are read this back in August at the YMCA the first one comes in Jesus and look you gave me a pound I've gained ten I've become ten times the preacher I was at the beginning oh god I hope I can say that on that day and he said well thou good and faithful servant because thou has been faithful in a very little you have authority over ten cities how many believe that that prophecy was right about brother Branham a huge portion of heaven awaits you because you left your family you left your wife you left bram Tabernacle the easy life you left all that and the Bible said it with just a little thing he gives you authority over 10 cities and a little thing how much more for great things in the other parallel passage of the parable of talents he says well done good and faithful servant now spend faithful over a few things I'll make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord many things huge portions that kind of say like that church huge portions of reward can await us if we just do what God tells us to do if we can just be faithful with the things God has placed into our hands and like we said it could be children it could be a singing gift it could be a preaching gift it could be a prophesying gift or speaking in tongues gift or get the wisdom and knowledge if we can just be faithful with that God reward us abundantly because we chose the harder way the Bible says overcometh it and keeps my works to the end for me it'd be well I'll just quit the church or maybe I'll just give up pastor but the Bible says if I can keep the works to the end the Bible said to him when I give power over the nation's and not only that he said and I'll give you they shall rule with the rod of iron he gives them a scepter to rule over those cities and nations that he talked about if we can let the authority of God if we can choose to let the authority of God rule our lives now Jesus said I got a rod of iron waiting for you in the Millenium how many love the Lord praise I believe that's it yeah I believe that's it by God's grace well perfect timing it's one o'clock you love the Lord oh thank you Jesus how many appreciate predestination he lets you in a foreknowledge it's become it's become more clear to me on the back of God's mind is that for knowledge based upon free more agency okay come to the end of there and now that's why church this is transform my life that's why I'm trying to get up earlier trying to be more faithful trying to study or more all the time pray more is because I know there's a reward when I make the right choice I can't wait for God to just push me and well we could study when you feel like it or that's the case our bodies rarely feel like it we've got to make the choice and because of this choice is because of what we choose a portion of heaven awaits those who make the right choice let's just bow your heads for a moment here Church does this give you courage brother Ram said this should give you courage how many raise your hands say Lord thank you for the courage because you've ordained all these things in my life now I'm going to say lord give me strength Lord correct me to make the right choice or lead me to make the right choice help me to overcome my sinful desire my freemore agency bless those hands bless those hands let's pray together Heavenly Father you see the hands that are raised this morning Lord we love this word dear God we love it dear Lord hallelujah it gives us such courage to know you've ordained us to hear the message of the hour how we love marriage and divorce and seven seals of the seven churches hallelujah and the anointed ones at the end times Lord and the spoken words original seed and who's this Melchizedek how we love all these mysteries of this message that you give to us many many turns of years and eons ago in your mind you looked ahead to this day and saw that we would love you that we would love this message and because of that you elected us Scott and then you predestinated the events of our lives that we could receive the message the Lord we want to say to fresh we love your character because you're the God of truth I'm reminded of Revelation 19 when you come back from heaven for the Armageddon battle the Bible says you're called faithful and true that's what we love about you Lord you're true you keep your word you're faithful to your word you never lie like the devil does you cannot lie we love who you are we love all that you are this whole Bible we love everything and we just want to be submissive to your will we just want the courage to choose the narrow way dear God for broad is the way that leads to destruction but narrow is the way that leads to life I pray this message would strengthen the experienced warriors of the saints and give them fresh inspiration to choose the right path every day maybe they make glorious decisions as you're as the prophecy said about your prophet dear God maybe they make the correct and precise decisions maybe they choose the narrow path maybe they walk in their own choosing of God's will for their life may they make momentous decisions today dear God and this week to serve you dear God it helped me Lord we're not asking for a huge portion of heaven we just want a portion of heaven dear God that we can spend time eternity with you Heavenly Father and all on that day you'll say well done what a glorious decision you have made and you have had a tremendous victory in the love divine Oh glory Jesus glory I pray for these people that love divine would be victorious in their lives I pray for this church you strengthened us with that divine love for Lord faith operates by love may their love for you that you foresaw millions of years ago may that love motivate their faith to do works to glorify that great name Lord and then at the end of it we can go back and say well it really wasn't ivett labored but it was the grace of God that caused me you it was your unmerited favor Lord God thank you for this amazing grace Lord God we love you Lord God as your prophet said we don't know what tomorrow holds we've never entered in our theophany help us Lord to hold that chute of faith strong right now help us Lord to buckle up that belt of truth and hold that sword of the Spirit the word with the strong hand of faith or and I never would have thought some of these things would have happened in 2018 people falling away people leave in different things different attacks Lord but I can say by your grace that I've chosen the right way and I've fought the good fight of faith I've tried to edify the faith of the people build it up in the Word of God and the message of this our help each one of us told God to fight that good fight of faith in Jesus Christ's name the church said let's just thank the Lord let's just worship the Lord thank you Jesus we love you Lord God now you're awesome in this place [Music] [Music] [Music] you are awesome [Music] you are worthy of our lives you are a man we

this moment you knew that we would love you no I want to say the fresh I love you I love you more than anything else I love you with all my heart soul mind and strength I sacrifice anything to show you that I love Alleluia I'm gonna sacrifice my time Lord where investments or worldly pursuits and worldly pleasures are good pursuits but just aren't the best thing for me Lord God help me to sacrifice everything to walk the narrow way to there god I love it Jesus I love you Lord God help me to walk in your word to choose the right path I choose you Jesus I pick you I picked the message of the hour I picked the narrow road Oh God let me walk in that to bypass Oh God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Jesus will walk in that light such a beauty for moms where the dew drops of Mercy I Jesus just keep playing that let's remember brother Simon before we close Church right now he's got a spiritual lamp and he's walking in a dark country of Thailand and he's calling is there anybody that wants to serve Jesus Christ he's he's holding this look he's just trying to does anybody want to walk in this light and there's not one real message Church over there there's some that believe it but or believe something but not all of it and they're got perverted ways and so he's walking he said does anybody want to love Jesus who love Jesus and church let's pray that God will allow him to find those predestinated souls that would love Jesus for who he is not for just what he does and gives them finances and food but because of his word because of who he is he's taking two weeks off of work and losing that money so he can walk in the light say does anybody love not Jesus there anybody that wants to sit down with our busy schedule and hear the word and do a Bible study and hear about my Jesus that I love maybe you were called to that but brother Simon's had to choose the harder way for him he's had to choose to do missionary work and I think this is his fourth trip now and he still he still told me said I'm looking for somebody that'll be born again like a pastor and start a church just a church we know if if God is leading him to go there's got to be somebody out there that loves God doesn't run his business well maybe somebody be saved in Thailand if it's God's genuine leading there is somebody there that really loves Jesus let's just close on prayer with that I know it's 1:15 but let's pray father that I hit plan to say that I felt like you just led me to say that [Music] cotton blesses my heart to know that my brother in the flesh would leave this money behind his job take the time off and risk his life and Lord he's on a journey Lord like Abraham not really knowing where he's going but he's holding forth that light looking for that lost sheep and I believe it's you the great Shepherd who's guiding him to do that he's looking for that one sheep of the hundred that's lost in sin maybe they're lost in a abusive relationship maybe they're lost in drunkenness and marijuana addiction but I pray in Jesus Christ's name we agree in Jesus Christ's name you'd help him to find that predestinated a lost sheep Aliyah and you can bring those sheep home to the father's house hallelujah and bless our brother he's chosen the harder path strengthen him that our prayers be recorded in heaven may Lord you minister to brother Simon may he bring us a missionary port Lord of good tidings father raised of a pastor raised up a shepherd that will feed sheep no doubt about to feed some goats just like sometimes we do Lord we don't know for sure but but Lord while we're feeding the Sheep sometimes we feed the goats but Lord we don't know who they are so we just want to feed every herd dear God and then you'll separate it at the day of judgment you'll take that net and you'll separate it or you'll those angels will come and they'll harvest the tears from the wheat but we don't know dear God I pray you'd help them to hold forth that light is that some sheep might be found dear God thank you Lord strengthen him dear God bless our day today that's us as we go Lord God be with those who can't make it to tonight's service speak to them may your spirit guide them and I pray they would make the right choices dear God let them choose the narrow path let them choose the correct and precise decision let them make a momentous decision may they have a tremendous victory in the baptism of the Holy Ghost the love divine we asked all these things church of what name do we ask it we ask it on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said Amen let's give Lord Ram applause amen hallelujah we're trusting the great Shepherd to go bring home that lost sheep thank God for a shepherd like Jesus Christ god bless your church or dismiss you Macomb for your admonition of the Lord well [Music] dewdrops mercies I know [Music] now can I sing a song I know there's a place called grace we were singing it at our house here Amen praise let me
