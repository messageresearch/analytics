gonna read through the church age book we finished the whole Bible now we're gonna go to the church age book by the grace of the Lord so I want to follow up on that also the second announcement brother bang and I kind of had like an impromptu trustee meeting last Sunday and he wanted to know how many people would like to begin saving to buy a church building I told him in your in years past it's been hard to say because of the needs of the Saints and also just because of the the high cost of buying a church and then all the costs that are associated with it but if you would like to do that let me know send me a text or something like that I'd like to know how many would like to do that by the grace of the Lord I think in the last year I've had about three people approached me about that that's something we could look at you know Lord willing not the Lord tarries I hope he doesn't tarry but if he tarries we had something we can look at by the grace of God so that's the second announcement I believe that's it for announcements prayer requests the urgent one is there's a child in my class this year a boy he had he's had the flu three days this week and now it's so bad he

God for your healing and she's I never knew you could do that so I said that's one of the teachings God has revealed to us in this hour so let's pray that God will help her maybe send an aide to help her throughout the day to clean her house and everything like that and also God will give her healing touch she says all's I do is listen to Jimmy Swaggart all day preach in the music so she's trying

[Applause] [Music] thank you praise the Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 3 like to keep on the lair to see in church age this is part 10 this morning revelation 3 verse 20 I will see how far we get by the grace of the Lord revelation 3 verse 20 revelation 3 verse 20 quite an interesting week with Billy Graham passing thank God for a servant Lord like Billy Graham we know brother Aaron repeatedly called him an angel to Sodom over and over and no doubt he was an angel of God brother Branham says hardly anyone ever preached justification like he did he said he had it down to a tee trying to get people to come forward and repent and my wife and I were looking we saw some pictures of him preaching the forties he's like leaning down like this preaching he stopped doing that later on as he got older but there was no doubt a lot of fire and zeal in his heart at the beginning and were grateful for a faithful ange of the Lord so Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 I'll read this myself here behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that's just bow our heads for word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God here as we pray Heavenly Father Lord how many times have we opened our Bible how many times have we stood in reverence to your word it's such a privilege Lord to do it one more time Lord God help us to remember Lord that we must hunger and thirst after righteousness lord help us to remember the power of prayer Lord and the power of gathering whether there be two or three or more in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we thank you for this opportunity Lord speak to us through this word Lord here as we endeavor to say what the seventh angel said Lord and the seventh angel was speaking to the churches Lord and here we are a church Lord and we want to hear what the Spirit is saying Heavenly Father so bless us Lord in thy divine presence Lord meet every need we pray father surely Lord you're in this place Lord surely you promise to meet with your people Heavenly Father so we know you'll do it Lord God help us to look for you help us to sense your presence lord help us to believe all your word in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless your being seated praise the Lord so we like to get part 10 this morning by the grace of the Lord most of us are pretty familiar with the 7 church age it's the church age were living in by God's grace now looking at part 10 part 57 overall of the church ages I think I have maybe one or two more sermons left maybe on the Laodicean Church age and then the series I told y'all Wednesday I'm praying about I've been I've studied quite a few hours and proverbs and Ecclesiastes in job I'm kind of feeling burdened to preach on the wisdom of the Holy Spirit I've also want to preach on the life of Christ you know the whole whole entire life that would be a big long series I'd like to do a prayer series this year I've been looking at leadership and also believe the sign rebuttals like to do that as well and finish you know the series that I've been working on but the nice thing about a pastor has always have time to go back and finish it Lord willing if God Terry's by the grace of the Lord and also I've had three or four ministers help me correct my book so I'm getting more progress on that I think I'll start with my wife going reading edits and then I'll send off to a professional publisher as soon as my wife and I finish editing the book and some of the brothers have already said there it's gonna be a really powerful books I hope it is by the grace of the Lord I hope it's something that people can read and I'll point them right to the Word of God amen so I'm looking forward to that let's look at Christ outside the church that's what the Prophet speaks to us here in the church ages and so we read our text verses 20 21 and 22 now we're gonna look at verse 20 to start off with it's interesting in the church age book the Prophet said this scripture is not to individuals it's to the entire church and then in his sermon in 1960 he said it is to individuals as well so we know there's a dual application to the scripture Jesus is speaking to the church age as a whole but also he's knocking on every individual hearts door as we know the sermon door within a door right we know that sermon from February of 63 so it has a dual application the Prophet said this is one of the most outstanding statements that I've ever seen the New Testament I want you to notice this I stand at the door and knock this is generally used a quotation for the appeal for sinners we tell sinners Jesus is at the door knocking but here he's knocking at the church door for he once walked with them but they with their organization and worldliness and coldness had excluded him he's on the outside of the church now we've got to make sure we don't have an organization per se but we got to make sure this one right here this rascal right here we don't get caught on God and the last few Wednesday's we looked at zeal and fervency I remember when Karen asked me about what's the difference between Zeeland fervency well we found out the last few weeks they're very similar they're like synonyms it's the boiling love of God both words mean to boil when you're boiling with zeidel you're just overflowing with God's love and or overflowing with a purpose in your heart for God it's this boiling over it's this energy the spiritual energy we'd say or spiritual inspiration of the holy spirit that's what we've got to have a zeal to repent and to do the works of God in this hour so we got to make sure we're watching that in our lives so we see that there's a application to the entire church age because here now this is from the sermon now we go to the church age book the Prophet said Heath and ear let him hear what the Spirit say it to the churches so this is a message to the churches as well so this is the message to the church of the last age this is the condition of the Laodicean church as its end nears it is not a personal message to one person it is the spirit telling us where Jesus is Christ has left the church that would be an awful condition to be in this morning if Christ was not in our church can you imagine I'll say like this the anointing can be in churches but Christ could not be in the churches I'm talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost they can have the anointing in their service the anointing of the Holy Spirit and so forth but not have Christ the person of the Holy Spirit in the Baptism in individual lives that's right because we hear about all the time from our friends God healed this one in the denomination God healed that one God's working and drawing people to repentance the anointing is there but not the person the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's exactly because they reject all the ways to get to him the way to get to the person of Christ its justification and then that sticky one right there sanctification that's the one they don't like because brother Graham said that's the labor that's the labor stage where you've got a labor you've got to get down to business with God you've got to sit in the hot Suns of the wilderness and let all the the light of God baked out all your worldliness amen your worldly habits your worldly thoughts your ideas your own opinions you've got to let it all get baked out so Christ there can be room for Christ in the soul praise the Lord amen now here's a quote in the same sermon from 1960 where brother Graham he stresses it's the individual so he in one place he says it's for the church and then another place he says it's for the individual so it's both we know it's both he says if any man any Methodist Revenue have any former Methodists in here any Baptist we have any former Baptists in here he said any Presbyterian when I was going to the chapel that was a Presbyterian Church I was a former Presbyterian and Pentecostal by birth being raised in a Pentecostal church or any Catholic now many former Catholics in here all right he says or he says any Church of God man any Nazarene man Pentecostal man any man that will hear my voice and will open the door I will come in and sup with him and he with me that's the message to the Pentecostal Church not tried to revive the Pentecostal organization but revive the Pentecostal blessing in whose heart the individuals heart that's the only way and I was up with him and he with me so the only people that are supping with Jesus sitting across the table or sitting next to Jesus and supping and communing and talking you know how you like to do that you got like to go out to eat and I like to sit across the table and look at you and talk with you and hear about how your week went and we like to sit across we enjoy that we like that we enjoy being in one another's presence the only people that do that with Christ are those who have been baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ amen because that's what he's saying say come out of the church systems come out right come out and be separate saith the Lord if you look at it on the church scale but on the individual scale he's saying open the door and let me come into your soul amen it's exactly right so see you have both applications you can't deny it here he says in leadership a few weeks before he passed away God don't deal with organizations he don't deal with groups he deals with individuals that's right always not in groups individuals one person so to prove this how God deals with individuals what scripture does the Prophet use this is just days after he printed the church age book he says in the last days he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man not any group to see the Prophet applies at both ways it applies to the church and also applies to the individual if any man will hear my nook and open I will come in and sup with him if any man can hear how many of open the door to Christ to your life hey man what a blessing how many enjoy feasting with Christ you enjoy the word he gives you you enjoy his fellowship oh my it's all around the Word of God hallelujah you can't have fellowship with Christ if we're not fellowshiping with each other and the Word of God that's right now I'm finishing the quote from the church age but Christ has left the church is this not the logical result or end if the word is put aside for creed the Holy Spirit disposed for Pope's bishops presidents counselors etc and the Savior set aside for a works program or Church joining or some type of conformity to a church system what more can be done against him this is the apostasy this is the falling away this is the open door to the Antichrist for one came in his father's name Jesus and was not received but rejected then there will come another with his own name a liar a pretender and him they will receive John 5:43 the man of sin that son of perdition will take over now most churches will say we're preaching in Jesus name but if you really get down to it they're preaching in the titles father son Holy Ghost praise the Lord cuz you said well whose name you going to be baptizing father son Holy Ghost they're really not come in the name of Jesus Christ because when you come in the name of Jesus Christ you bring the power of Christ with you amen and it brings power to change the draw center your back ciders to repentance to heal the body praise God to raise the dead or whatever God's calling to make tumors vanish whatever God's calling you to do the name of Jesus Christ is what accomplishes that miracle amen but see Christ had left them because they didn't want the baptism of the Holy Ghost they wanted just a church joining in a church routine oh my if we get when we get keep our spiritual eyes open if we get people coming up for the Holy Ghost and today's service or future service that ought to be the most that be the time that we most give to sincere prayer that should be time where we're most down to business with God saying God fill them so they can open their door and let you in so they can have fellowship with you you ought to care if people were down at the altar if you met sup with him you want other people to have supper with him it's not the time we walk out or fall asleep or just put our head down or close their eyes and try to think about after service that's the time we're saying lord help them to surrender help them to open the door and help them to have fellowship with you hey man that that ought to be the climax of every service amen brother Brooks called me and we talked in last time I was out in Iowa said he went back to Iowa City and where the brothers were saying we got filled with the Holy Ghost and mother Jesse was preaching and I said hallelujah praise the Lord that's that's when it's all about to get people to open the door and invite crisis not just be a temporary visitor but a permanent resident amen to be a resident in my life that everyday I can have fellowship with Christ I don't know about you Church but you feel your you see your life more and more every day all you do is think about Jesus it's like I can't get away from it I love it but I guess I can't get it I get tired too but even when I'm tired and worn out all I can do is think about Jesus it's this constant just coming back and meditating the Bible calls that meditate or pondering or thinking on their ways everything ultimately goes back whether it's you know work or family whatever it ultimately all points back to the Word of God it all points back to Christ and that's what David said think on God's ways amen if you think on God's ways you'll turn your feet to his pass hallelujah that's the believer every day their mind is just filled with the things of God because they're having sup with Christ Christ is there he's not somewhere else but crisis in my soul praise God God is in my soul and I talk with him I think about him I fell oh with him and I eat what he's feeding me praise God Oh hallelujah he's here in my soul he has a place at the table Amen hallelujah oh but the churches don't have this and it could be a message Church it could be any because they can denominator by the spirit and not by the we'd say the written letter on a on a book or something like that now after this after the random notes that Christ is outside the church he goes to the sign in the heavens that Christ has left the church and he quotes Matthew 24 and to save a little time I'm going to skip past this quote but he basically compares the light on the church ages okay the light of the church ages right here he compares this to a total eclipse over Jerusalem On January of 1964 if you remember from the church age book so let me go back and the Prophet mentions this he said Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens now immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken now when the stars fall from heaven that of course would be in the sixth seal but we see all these signs are leading up to the sixth seal right to the to the right to the the rapture first and then the Tribulation Period there's obviously some overlap so the prophet notes how there's going to be signs in the skies at the coming of the Lord and the prophet saw how the moon this moon is the type of the bride right because she reflects the she has no light of her own she reflects the light of Christ and the Prophet said at the end of the Laodicean age this will once the bride goes up this will fully be darkened out there'll be no more mercy there'll be no more grace there'll be no more Holy Spirit for the people of the world once the bride goes up except it'll go to the Jewish people praise God now he says it is now think on this the church shines in the reflected light of Christ he is the son the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the moon it has decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a sliver in the fourth age when the fifth age it begins to grown the sixth took a great step growth forward in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and wanted to almost a nothingness I'm sorry waned to almost nothingness so that instead of light it was the blackness of apostasy and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for darkness had taken over Christ was now outside the church everyone said here is the sign in the sky the last Eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to a total darkness in seven stages and there's the picture in the church age book remember this from the church age books who's read it lately so there are six pictures but the seventh was when there was the total eclipse so they didn't put that picture on there they just put six pictures on there so the Prophet is comparing how the light gets darkened out in the church ages and God gave a sign of that over Jerusalem in January of 1964 at Pope John the 6th visit to Israel you can look it up it's on Wikipedia it's all out there you can look it up if you want a program says this is a sign he says in the 7th age the total darkness came as Pope of Rome Paul the six went to Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem he in fact he was the first pope to ever get on a plane - I saw the I saw the report on him this morning from 1964 first plane delete I'm sorry first pope to leave Rome four thousand years I think it was and then the first pope to get on a plane and where'd he go he went to Jerusalem he says the Pope is named Paul the sixth Paul was the first messenger and the man goes by that name notice it is the six or the number of man this is more than a coincidence and when he went to Jerusalem the moon of the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end now look at this statement here I'm gonna just take a moment look at this this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled now put Asterix by this because I don't I can't really explain this statement we know it's not a prophecy because he doesn't say they'll say at the Lord but this is going to be a good lesson to us to help us rightly divide the word of truth he says even so Lord Jesus come quickly so this seeing this happen brother RAM saw this happen in Jerusalem in 64 he thought my this this must be the end he thought he said this generation will not pass until the coming of the Lord because he saw this he saw what God was doing here and then he saw this happen as the Pope who was the leader of the mother harlot right the man who rides the Beast right and he saw this all coming together now I'm going to look at this here now let's go down here I've already read this I'm not sure how to interpret this statement when he says this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled so it's been 54 years since 1964 a generation the Bible has different meanings there's all kinds of different meanings for generation in the Bible but it usually means 40 years in the Bible and this reminded me about the statement of 1977 and so I'm going somewhere with this I want to I'll get to that but here's two thoughts on how a generation can be 40 years and the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel and he made them wonder the wilderness 40 years until all the generation that had done evilness I the Lord was consumed so how long Lord are they going to wonder 40 years to make sure that all that generation passed away so it seems like a generation can be 40 years 40 years long was I agree with his generation said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways so again I think everybody can see it's been well past 40 years since 1964 so if we interpret it that way it would of course not be right it would just be his thought and I'm comfortable with that because we all have to say with the thought of 1977 that was just brother rands thought nobody can say it can everybody say amen to that that was just his thought so I'm just trying to look this morning especially at worth the end time and we've got to make sure that everything we believe is in line with the scripture I just want to empty because that's what we find and it just shocked me as I'm reading this where the Prophet said this generation won't pass until we see the coming of the Lord so I just want to rightly divide this now look what the prophets said now don't know don't forget in later on in the book the prophets said he predicted all seven visions of the seven missions would come to pass by 1977 now of course we know that it hasn't happened because he saw America nothing but ashes and boulders and and meteors sitting in her I'm sorry atom bombs and all kinds of holes and explosions everything was with ashes and everything so that hasn't happened now brother Branham says you know you might think it's irresponsible but I maintain this prediction after 30 years because Jesus did not say no man could not know the Year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so I repeat now look I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium now this doesn't stumble me I hope it doesn't stumble you because he was being completely sincere in all of his sincerity for some reason he thought the world would end by 1977 now he told us the reason behind the 1977 statement and we can see that he was trying to be a student of the word so the reason behind it was from Daniels I'm sorry from the 70th week of Daniel and 1961 so I want to revisit that so you can see the humanity of brother Branham huh me know that Jesus said I'm sorry how many know that John the Baptist said I must decrease and he must increase if that applied to the first 4runner what about the second 4runner Amen now what I mean by that is we can't lean upon any thought from brother Branham unless it's got a scriptural backing praise of the heart I'm not saying we forget brother rhythm we never do that we would never forget John the Baptist we thank God but we've got to be more sure we've got to be more in fellowship having sup with Jesus more than ever praise God because it is the spirit of Jesus that is going to change our bodies in a moment and a twinkling of an eye amen and so see we we can't just guess and well I'm just going to believe this because I heard it on a tape it's good that you heard to take but you've got it we've got to take that back to the Word of God because one of Satan's greatest tools is to use the prophet of God and try to try to bring some false doctrine that was maybe just the opinion of the Prophet or something and to make it something big right and to make it distract people from the real truth now it'll never distract the Bride of Christ it'll never distract the element but the elect never want to be guilty of saying anything outside the Word of God now here's where he says it he's closing this message and says a striking statement from the time God made the promise to Abraham don't miss this he said from the time God made the promise to Abraham Genesis 12:3 to the time of Christ being rejected in AD 33 by the Jews according to Galatians 3:16 and 17 according to Ussher's chronology of the Hebrews the power of God was with the Jews exactly 19 and 54 years sbobet I'm saying from the time of Abraham until Jesus crucifixion was 1954 years this is where he got his numbers from he said I got many more scriptures I'll just give you that he said now counting that time we find that we have exactly he said 17 years left and we have the same span of time given to us as God dealing with us in the power of the Holy Spirit sends a t-33 until 1977 the same span of time of 1954 years deals with us the same time as he did with the juicy how about that so what was brother branham's as a student of the scripture what was he basing the 1977 prediction on he was basing it upon this number he came up from Abraham until Jesus crucifixion in a t-33 does ever understand that and he was saying if God was with the Jews for 1954 years then he'll maybe be with the Gentiles for 1954 years has ever understand that now I preached this one time when I first preached in a Lima and I showed I showed the people how brother Brandon found this and I had an older woman come up and she shook my head she said thank you so much for preaching that I always wondered my brother branham said in 1977 and then she could have peace and move on past that question or mind and that's what the Holy Spirit does it dissolves all of our doubts praise God that's what he does now he even tells them to mark that down in a little your little book of Scripture here and he talks about the Jubilee year and how the Jubilee year came exactly it was a multiple of 70 so this three hundred so if you add up the Jewish years plus the Gentile years he said all that comes out to a multiple of 70 so he had layers and layers of numbers that seemed to be right and he was Church he was being sincere he sincerely believed it he said as a student of the word I still sincerely believe it's gonna be 1977 what was he basing upon he was basing upon Scripture he's a patient upon years he thought God would give the same amount of time to it to the Jews as you to the Gentiles but if you if you just do some simple math anybody got their phone ready or you can look at mine here if you just do simple math here I'll do 1977 - 33 it's actually 1944 years I'm not trying to I'm not trying to one-up brother branham I'm not but he just got his numbers wrong how many bleedy was sincere and how many people Loras and Karen did they see trying to follow the Lord around night 77 they fell away now I'm not we're not trying to say oh you know he's not a man of God here was no doubt a man of God no doubt about that but you see as sincere as we can be we've got to make sure especially in this day when there is not a prophet on the scene we've got to make sure we are directed back to the Word of God that's right he brought him he goes again and says that did you get that God has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the Jews from the time he gave Abraham the promise unto the rejecting the Messiah in a t-33 which was 1954 years but actually it was 1944 at least in that calculation he's ever understand what I'm what I'm saying he was doing his best now this 77 issue never stumbled me because he never said thus saith the Lord behind it because Church if you're honest with yourself you know and I know all of us had said the spirit told me this times I felt led of the Spirit and we found out later we were not led of the Spirit be honest with yourself oh I know I heard from God did you and I knew even as a young Christian I knew as long as he didn't say in the name of the Lord it was just him being human we've got to let people be human and have mercy upon them especially if they don't go speaking in the name of the Lord right it was never spoken the name of the Lord and in fact I was reading a quote this morning where brother Branham said after he got out of the trance of the seven major visions he says some thought just came to him about 1977 that what he said that 1958 by the way so see look how close that is look how close Church the supernatural is to the natural and we've got to make sure everything we believe everything that we we say swallow everything that we eat spiritually is the truth of God now we know the majority of Bible teaching from brother Branham was thus saith the Lord in full harmony with Scripture can you say amen to that the majority of what he taught was thus saith the Lord so much so that he kept saying thus saith the Lord water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now say the Lord Trinity doctrine is of the devil right thus saith the Lord these are the revelations of the seven seals and that's when I wrote this page that we believe page of our church plus other YouTube videos when I make a youtube video and I put something out there for the public I don't I don't put up things I know are wrong I put up things that we know we have a Bible backing for amen does everyone understand by God's grace and so you see if the prophet makes a sincere mistake we've got to know we might make sense their mistakes and we've got to be humble enough to say God if I make a mistake please correct me now let's move on by the grace of lord I hope that was okay I just wanted you to see that I thought maybe some of you had never seen that where brother Brandon was trying to add updates and that's a good thought but we know it wasn't the right thoughts it was just his own thought as a student of the word and we're at the end time and memory brings up this statement about how this generation will not pass until we see the coming of Lord it's been past 40 years now it might be 70 or 70 years can be a generation 2 because God Jeremiah told Israel you'll be down in Babylon for seven years a generation so that will lead us to the next thought a little bit by God's grace but let's look at this here now after this thought let's move on and then we'll actually move back now we can see why there were two vines so one of the churches lost all the light while the bride is course shining in the light of God one true one false now we can see by Abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted Isaac and one-half their promise now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of God and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence perfect persecuted the child that was elect God and not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he cannot I'm sorry he reprobated for the sake of the elect Alette cannot persecute elect he let cannot harm elect Amen this is why it's so important that we love people in the message praise God this is why it's so important we don't brand and label and make decisions and try to be judges and try to make ourselves more spiritual than other people the best thing you can do to be spiritual is humble yourself and not say much about it that's the best thing you can do now if you've got a leading of the Lord where Paul says mark those that cause division they're preaching heresy then you've got the leading of the Lord for that but see the elect will not persecute the elect now remember Paul and Barnabas had a nice dispute one time about mark can the elect maybe disagree with the elect absolutely they can definitely disagree with one another but they will not persecute the elect they will only maybe disagree for a season then remember mark became beneficial to st. Paul at the end of his ministry but there was something holding it off at the beginning that's what we find some people we think they're ready to serve God maybe the ministry but they're not quite ready God will make them ready in their time and season how many let me know that by God's grace mark Paul looked at his life and said Mark's not ready he's not quite ready for the ministry he's got to go through different types of trials and tests he's got to be trained more he's not ready Barnabas said he's ready Paul said he's not ready but pretty soon he gets ready and then God can use that man of God Haven hallelujah I like it it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect think about that who's trying to destroy your life or your your faith lately that's the that's the false mind they're trying to destroy and say you need to leave that message you need to leave the word and go to just some other church or something like that that's the false vine they're persecuting the truth about water baptism or the Godhead or the seventh years of the church ages when they persecute the truth they persecute you and I he said Oh religious and they're smart they're of the cane line the serpent seed they build their babbles they build their cities they build their empires and all the while calling on God they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even the name of Lord to destroy God's elect ones but they are needed what is the chaff to the wheat if there's no chaff there's no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire unquenchable and the wheat here where is it it is gathered in his garner it is where he is see God has a purpose even for the Serpent's seed they've got to be the chaff that's burned but God has use for the wheat God's gonna use the wheat praise God he's gonna bring it to his table thank the Lord now here's what I want to get to here this is where I'm going to come back to this thought o elect of God beware so right after he says this about this generation won't pass and he gives us the two seeds how one persecutes the other he said beware study closely be careful now you know church in your heart are you studying the message closely or do you only hear it on Sunday and Wednesday are we studying closely we've got to study this thing closely if a prophet could miss on 77 a prophet God let him make the mistake how many understand that God let it make a mistake if a prophet could miss and church if you go back and listen to the Daniel 70 weeks everybody's really excited after the end of that service he talks about 1977 why because people want to be ready for the coming of the Lord don't you want to be ready for the coming of the Lord and so it just it just makes you naturally excited OMA may be only 17 or 16 more years now so people are saying today the latest in church age is 112 years right so far Ephesus was 117 so people say oh maybe just five more years but be careful it might be longer than that we cannot put our hopes on our own thoughts we can only put our hope on the grace of Christ through the word I know this is from here but it's in here and we must revisit these things because if not we'll start drifting if we don't study close and if we don't play close attention we'll just start accepting anything anybody says we've got the study closely and be careful now how many know you how many know I'm gonna do this in your home you work out your salvation with fear and trembling you're trembling in your prayer closet at home how many do that how many do it at church this is the condition we've got to be in he says rely upon God and be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch unto prayer and be steadfast so I think the thing we find many time is that Jesus said watch and pray the thing we find is that most people watch but aren't praying more they watch the news they watch our Billy Graham and we're you know we're grateful we can know those things you know thank God for a serving of Lord but see we're watching those things but then are we taking those things and praying about it if not we'll just so we'll just keep watching but we've got to watch and then pray about that this is the end time both a true and false vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning see they're all joining the World Council of Churches that is the binding soon the guarding of the wheat will come but right now the two spirits aren't working two vines come out from among the tears start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your Lord and fit to reign and rule with him how do you well thank God we've come out of denominations but we've got to get rid of our coldness we got to be on fire we have to be fervent for Christ we have to be zealous for Christ how many want to be zealous for Christ you've got you're gonna be excited about something if you're not excited about cronic Christ and you're excited about your new car we're gonna be excited about the the next update on on whatever phone you want you know you're gonna find something to be about but we've got to make sure our main excitement our main zeal our main burden is for the work of the Lord study closely be careful don't swallow everything you hear go back and study it now here's why I saw this on Facebook and I'm gonna post this up here because whether this and here just give me a moment here let me let me do something real quick there we go I saw this on Facebook immediately made me think of what we saw with 1977 now this dear person that looks got a lot of likes on it a lot of love on it this sweet sweet dear person as a minister he's doing the same thing brother Branham was doing which is okay it's alright to do that it's not going to stumble the elect but we've got to make sure we don't put more emphasis on our presuming or our thoughts we got to make sure we put our emphasis on the word of God do you understand this person in other words is setting a date for the rapture for this year and they're not I'm not even sure if they're aware of it cuz look what they're saying this year is Israel's Jubilee you're at 70 years since 1948 which I'll get my calculator out again and I'll make sure that's right because we can see how easy how easy it is for a man of God even to make a mistake so it's 2018 - 70 that's right 1948 so that can be a generation because Jeremiah said that generation will we'll be in Babylon 70 years so this person without even and they have a lot of influence this person has thousands of friends a preacher and now look now see they're bringing this week and Billy Graham left the scene see how there can be a lot of oh my watching watching now look now this next segment the 144,000 44,000 Jews will soon receive Jesus that means the rapture is going to take place this year because it's the 70th year in the seventh year is a year giru jubilee and the only way that Jews can have a jubilee is if they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the seal of God their forehead the only way the Jews can receive that is if the Gentiles are gone at the marriage supper of the lamb to see how people may swallow this and and see they're watching this and I like it I didn't even like it I didn't like it or love it because I don't want to make predictions I don't want to get people's false hopes up you see how you see how careful we got to be this is the same thing that was with 1977 is it good to watch yes but you have to accompany that with prayer now if this person's right which I hope they are would that be glorious if the rapture came this year we'd be an eternity nothing to worry about you know Christ was we walking with Christ maybe with Jesus we'd all be with King Jesus amen Mahadevi glorious but if not well then here comes another well somebody guess and it wasn't right somebody's guessing again somebody's presuming again now I believe what brother Ram said I believe to the Holy Spirit may say this is the year of the coming of the Lord and that could be accurate maybe it would be down in Louisiana at the Louisiana camp maybe be over in Africa at a convention maybe the Holy Spirit would say thus saith the Lord the rapture is going to take place this year if that's the case that could be scripturally accurate because jesus said only no man knows the day or the hour so that's why even with 1977 people could say well it's possible because it is possible that would not be adding or taking away from the word but the way to know is pray about it that's the way to know we must pray about so this must be prayed about and I hope the brother prayed about it before he posted it if not it's just gonna be another well like the like the remember the 2015 the blood moons remember that 2015 the blood moons America the Pope was coming and he spoken at the Senate right in the Congress and I was shaken up by that I remember that I was shaken up by that I thought my maybe this is the coming of the Lord and so see I just want every to see this that you've got to be ready at any time it shouldn't take something like this to make us be ready because Jesus is already something with us right now praise God I'm having supper with him on a daily basis amen I feel his presence ah he's teaching me his word I'm talking to him every day he's in the house amen hallelujah and I'm not being critical Church I'm not being critical at all I'm just saying this is the same thing if this comes the two paths and 2019 comes well what did that mean then I don't know what it mean but it just means that we shouldn't guess anymore we shouldn't be guessing we should make ourselves ready for the coming of the Lord now I want to read this next few things here I'm gonna really try to watch my time I've been really really going over lately support me in the days of the seventh messenger and the days of laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who will receive that prophet and his own name who received the benefit I'm sorry the yeah beneficent effect of that prophets ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who were mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spear and the bride say come Oh church how many can rejoice in the benefits you've received because of the message oh my I rejoice every day I was even walking my house yesterday say my what a blessing the message has been on my life it's delivered me from all my addictions it's giving me hope for the future it's given me wisdom for the future it showed me the power of Christ it showed me that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I didn't have that my other churches but today like the Prophet said the whole reason he wrote this book and gave us ministry was that he would restore a true relationship between God and man amen that's why he wrote the book that's why he labored on the field for all those years that and I could truly have sup with the Lord Jesus Christ what a blessing my here's why when I get to this the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at Nicaea has come back to original word again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say did you catch those words let's can we say this can we say from God ready from God what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the Word of God we're getting down to the last age we're in the last age we're getting down to the final years whether it's five fifty hundred one hundred fifty we don't know but we are down to the end of the end and we've got to say what the Spirit is saying we've got to say what's already in the Word of God amen he says they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age praise the Lord now if I can hear by the grace of Lord let me go back to that we believe page I want to show you that we believe page on our website I've had different people tell me that because of that page they've been able to really understand the word of the Lord and express their their faith so here's our web page we believe is right here and I've sent people that have left the message with big names I've sent them to this website and they never respond to me back because everything we believe is from the scripture and I'll just make it really big like that our church has one faith how many believe we have the one faith God one God and he's revealed in one person in three ways one person revealed in three ways the Bible is infallible grace is unmerited to all those who receive it but most people misinterpret grace and the Bible said people can reject the grace of God they can fail the grace of God legalism allows one to fall from grace so we must understand grace the right way salvation by grace through faith the way to repentance is by faith faith is God's gift to you and I amen and God uses three works of grace to do this justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have three divine ordinances that we keep they're all scriptural water baptism is only done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the gifts and power of the Holy Ghost are still here today amen all nine for all men and women but we know here the rain falls on the just and the unjust operation of miracles does not prove anyone is saved now present truth Peter said we must be established in the present truth the present truth for our day is the message of the hour it's the legacy in church age it's the restoration that jesus promised in acts 3:21 in matthew 17 11 and we believe there's one angel messenger this day his name was william branham we also believe the mysteries of god are finished praise the Lord that's proven by the Word of God there's 12 New Testament mysteries we know that there's seven kingdom mysteries that Jesus talked about we know modesty and outward clothing is the will of God is it's proven completely through the Scriptures we know the fivefold ministry will bring the people to perfection for the rapture that's right we believe marriage and divorce is between one man and one woman till death that's right we believe Hollywood in the internet are great tools of Satan for the lust of the eyes we must avoid them at all costs and we know predestination is God's plan for our life every event in our life every footsteps of the righteous have already been ordered by the Lord amen can the church say Amen what on there is our thought or our injection nothing we haven't ejecting into the Bible but we've only accepted exactly what the Bible says so again the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing how many want to say that amen and they what they will say have already been said in the word now I want to close with this I'm gonna I don't have time to get it on the slide so I'm gonna read it out of the book here the overcomers throne let's finish with this by the grace of God I knew I wouldn't have time to get it on there so pardon me revelation 3:21 let's read that it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne I'm gonna read these thoughts right out of here he says now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for is not so much what we're over to come but how we're over to come this is logical for what does it matter I'm sorry for it matters not much what we are overcome as long as we know how we can't overcome let me say like this church it doesn't matter what you're battling right now I just say it like that it really doesn't matter what I struggle with it really doesn't matter what your struggle with well I just wish somebody would come and preach on that it really doesn't matter now I hope so for that to you understand that if God's working in time or seasons but it really doesn't matter what your week with compared to what I'm week with or what your week but it doesn't really matter what we struggle with as long as we know how to over that struggle hey man it doesn't really matter yes I want God to minister to every need of every person and family we we want that but we can't sit back in a spiritual lazy state and sit there and say well they never preach on it's just going to remain there in my life we should have enough maturity to take our needs before the Lord and say God it doesn't matter what need I have it doesn't matter what I'm struggling I'm sorry it doesn't matter what I struggle with because I know you can meet that need if I'll just accept your word amen sometimes we build up our our enemies so big in our mine I just wanna however overcome by this or brother I've had people tell me this brother cast these demons off me and like well first of all you've got to want those demons off you it isn't even going to work if you don't win and you should have so much zeal that God could help you to repent and then it will leave you praise God because the Bible said draw nigh unto God he'll draw nigh unto you amen does he sometimes we make our enemies so greater I could never overcome this or maybe one day God will do this for me but the point is it doesn't really matter who our enemy is because who can stand before the Lord Jesus Christ amen nobody can stand before him and in his presence is fullness of joy that's where we've got to get to it is Presidents amen and when we get in his presence and when we look in his full in his wonderful face we'll turn our eyes from our truck struggles our trials this is what the overcomer focuses on in this hour it's not so much I'm struggling with this or with that it's instead of looking at that we've got to look at the Word of God and I know now we know it now more than ever before it's easier at night time just to take our phone and turn on YouTube or turn on something else but if we do that too much you and I stop speaking the word and the only way to overcome is to speak the word I'm gonna prove that to you brother Branham says that Jesus the only way he could overcome seyton with the three temptation is my speak in the word he didn't put on YouTube right he didn't go to YouTube he didn't looked he to look to anything any other source so if I can just put on the tape or but although that can help don't get me wrong that can help it may raise your faith to speak the word but what I'm saying is that the way to overcome is to have the Word of God near to you now you even in your mouth that's how we overcome and that's how the latest Seon bride member will overcome say in this hour by speaking the Word of God it doesn't matter what you're battling it doesn't matter at all it doesn't matter the the enemy what matters is God's Word what matters is the power of Jesus Christ that's what matters amen and believing in that power and staying behind that word it's exactly right I just have to emphasize that because that's what the Prophet said it doesn't matter what we have to overcome what matters is that we have the power to overcome that the Word of God and brother man then goes into the scripture about Jesus's temptation and I know Church we've heard of the thousand times but if we still got if we still have Satan by our side we need to hear it again are you with me if you've still got a devil on your shoulder trying to tempt you to the cares of the world the pride of life the lust of the eyes then you and I need to hear it again are you with me if you feel like Satan's right there trying to talk you into doing some or then you just like Jesus and you've got to talk back to him the only way you're overcome the only way you'll sit on the throne near Christ is to take Christ's word and speak that word it's the only way Jesus overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only when he was face to face was Satan all three times and Satan said it's written Jesus said back it is he had to do what the word said he had to take that word and speak the word to the devil amen well the RAM said Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word she didn't use the word she didn't say well my husband told me this or God told my husband this she didn't use the word she just said oh that sounds pretty good she just took the word like that and that's what I'm saying with any now these these 1977 idea and this generation won't pass I'm not saying that's the devil but he would just it was just his own thought it wasn't a prophecy but I'm just saying in every situation we've got to take the Word of God and use the Word of God that's the only way we overcome personal temptations is by the Word of God only Eve did not use the word we must use the word and he says and right now let me say that is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know you are overcoming because the word can't fail Church I hope that's your desire I hope you desire you want to know you're an overcomer I don't want to walk through this life and pretend I hope I overcome and Laodicea I hope I'm an overcomer I hope one day I'll sit by Christ I don't want to hope that I want to know that my brother had said the only way to know is to quote the word and actually overcome your current struggle right now amen that's the only way how do I know my overcomer because I'm overcoming Satan right now with the word just like Christ did amen because Christ is in me I'm having sup with him and he's telling me what sits out of that devil amen hallelujah because I'm suffering with him it doesn't matter what's out it doesn't matter my enemy because I've got the victor I've got the mighty conquer in my soul amen the only way you know you'll sit with him on the throne is by overcoming right now I'm going to just keep saying that again all of you could pride on a piece of paper say both Jessie I'm strong with this can you preach on that that might be helpful but at some point even I can write that too but at some point I'm the one who's got I've got to take what the word says instead of what reasoning says and I've got to speak that word and I've got to obey that word I've got a verb and so you have to apply that word and obey it apply that word and obey it's easiest to see like with a sickness give me five more meds like if if you're sick one of the easiest ways to see it is just to deny the the the symptoms just deny them and keep quoting the word just quote the word quote the word quote the word that's an easy one for us to see because you have to look past the symptoms and you have to look to what the word says and that takes maturity right Church that takes maturity that's the only way to know we've got we have to constantly apply the word of God in his own personal life contending with himself Jesus had to wrestle with himself he overcame by obedience to the Word of God the Bible said that he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him what was he obedient to the Word of God remember the brother Branham said no one is stronger in their Christian walk then they're then they're pure and her adherence to the word of God you and I will never be any stronger than how much we adhere to obeying the word of God ever understand the only we can be strong is just keeping that word not giving into our flesh not saying well I'll just enjoy it tonight or I'll just enjoy for the week and then I'll go back you know the week and I'll just go back to that the only way to overcome is to deny that temptation and hang on to the Word of God we must adhere to the Word of God Jesus Christ overcame Satan himself now most of us it's not really Satan himself coming to us it's just a demon power right Satan doesn't go to every individual it's his demons many times that go to individuals and he overcomes Satan himself twisting the word I'm trying to get him to do some try to make himself a miracle or try to do something special like that he just kept quoting the Word of God and he overcame was simply quoting the Word of God don't you want to quote the Word of God hey man we must be obedient to the word quote the Word of God constantly apply the Word of God to our enemy that we're facing today the Prophet said no there will not be one person who will sit on the throne with the Lord Jesus Christ unless he or she has been living that word we've got to live that word that's why I'm feeling led to go to proverbs because there's so much wisdom in there and I've been reading that and the first chapter has the baptism Holy Ghost in the first chapter I don't know if you read proverbs lately I'm really excited to preach it it's got the baptism Holy Ghost in Chapter 1 and it ends the book of Proverbs ends with this proverbs 31 woman who's she's applied every word of God to every area of her life she has every inch of her house in order she's got all our children prepared and everyone in her house is prepared for anything that Satan might bring against them hey man and we think oh I'm just a woman I'm just this or that but the very pinnacle of God's wisdom is a woman who applies the Word of God to every area of her life amen I should have preached on wisdom this more that's kind of my burden but I got to finish this Laodicean Church age I got to finish this I mean I've been 3 years on this I got to finish this I love the Lord Jesus only those that live the word will sit by him on the throne and that's a woman who lived the word because there was every era even the middle night she was ready for all the battles that might come in the middle night she was prepared for the coming she's prepared for the coming of Lord she was prepared for any enemy that would come against her everything was in order she was a woman who walked in the wisdom of God and never were there going to be a wise woman or we're gonna be a foolish woman the foolish doesn't prepare the bush doesn't have everything in order the wise virgin has everything in order oh I want to sit on that throne don't you church not to be somebody but just to be faithful to what my Lord said that's all not to be a king or make myself a priests or not to make myself anything but just to do what's right just to show that he and I we did have sub we did have fellowship it wasn't just fellowship with a church organization or a religious experience but it was fellowship with the God of the universe let's stay on our feet here he says Eve fell because she left the word and the ephesian church age fell by turning slightly away from the Word of God this later seen age ends in a complete blackout of the word so see Ephesus start out just a little bit turning away from the word a little bit a little bit a little bit we know and by the end the church systems have totally left the Word of God there's no more light Jesus is on the outside they can't overcome they can't overcome the things of the world in this day delay our scene age ends in a black of the word thereby causing a departure from of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by how do you follow him by obedience to the word after a short and powerful demonstration of the Spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus I think I'll stop right there do you love the Lord today oh ma that's beautiful constantly applying the world let's just bow our heads for a moment and brother Louis if you'll come just play that Jesus keep me near the cross as you're bowing your head let's just ponder our lives here for a moment ponder the enemy that you're battling right now because it really doesn't matter what enemy it is right now it really doesn't
