[0:04] Let's go to verse 17. Romans
[0:13] 4:17. I just love the Lord. Don't you?
[0:16] You know, it seems like God just sends
[0:17] the right message at just the right
[0:19] time. Hallelujah. That's what I felt
[0:20] like on well, last Saturday and Sunday
[0:22] with brother Dennis and then uh
[0:25] Wednesday with brother Cadre. What a
[0:26] blessing.
[0:29] He preached at Cam on Cam's church on
[0:31] Thursday night. I listened to that. It
[0:32] was called the master of
[0:34] circumstances. That was a wonderful kind
[0:36] of followup. It's like almost like a
[0:37] two-part series of our service. And he
[0:40] preached those same testimonies he
[0:42] shared at the end regarding the gasoline
[0:43] and uh the buck. He shared those
[0:45] testimonies there at brother Cam. So,
[0:46] it's a real real blessing to hear it
[0:48] again by God's grace. Romans
[0:55] 4:17. I'll read 17 down to 19. We can
[0:58] read 20 together by God's
[1:02] grace. 17 says, "As it is written, I
[1:05] have made thee a father of many nations
[1:06] before him whom he believed, even God
[1:09] who quickenth the dead." Now, in this
[1:11] text, he's talking about quickening
[1:13] their dead loins, right? Their dead
[1:16] reproductive ability, right? God
[1:19] quickens the dead. He makes the dead
[1:21] things come alive. Hallelujah. and
[1:24] calleth those things which be not as
[1:27] though they were. And it's speaking of
[1:30] Abraham. So at one point Abraham got to
[1:32] the spot he was calling things. He was
[1:34] saying, "I do have seed. I will have a
[1:37] child. Sarah will have a child." God had
[1:39] to build him up. We're going to see that
[1:41] again today. We'll review it a little
[1:42] deeper today. We're going to see how God
[1:44] had to quicken the dead bodies.
[1:46] Hallelujah. So Abraham could call those
[1:48] things not as though they were. who
[1:51] against hope believed in hope that he
[1:53] might become the father of many nations
[1:55] according to that which was spoken so
[1:57] shall thy seed be. Verse 19. And being
[2:02] not weak in faith, he considered not his
[2:05] own body now dead when he was about a
[2:08] hundred years old, neither the deadness
[2:11] of Sarah's womb. Praise God. Let's read
[2:13] verse 20. 1 2 3. He staggered not at the
[2:17] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[2:20] strong in faith, giving glory to God.
[2:24] And let's read 21 as well. And being
[2:26] fully persuaded that what he had
[2:29] promised, he was able also to perform.
[2:32] May God add his blessing to the reading
[2:34] of his word. You can be seated. Praise
[2:40] God. Hallelujah.
[2:43] So today by God's grace we'll have a two
[2:46] services. I'm going to right after
[2:47] service though I'm going to take some of
[2:48] my family home. A little weary from we
[2:51] had a really busy weekend there at the
[2:52] conference but then I'll come back for
[2:54] the second service uh by God's grace. So
[2:58] we look forward to that. And then I
[2:59] think Malachi's got Malachi and the
[3:01] whatever teenagers there's a Sheffield
[3:02] youth meeting tonight and so um they're
[3:05] going to go up to that. And so brother
[3:07] Chris if you'd like to go to that'd be a
[3:08] good thing. Uh you know if you ever feel
[3:10] led to go up there. I know Lena's been
[3:11] there. Right. Brother Austin, have you
[3:12] been there, brother?
[3:15] Okay. Once. Amen. Praise God. I went up
[3:17] there a couple last year and it was good
[3:20] to see all the saints and shake their
[3:21] hands and uh it was a blessing. I think
[3:23] I went up for prayer. I was so touched
[3:24] by the the message the brother gave. So,
[3:27] we know all the efforts you do to draw
[3:29] closer to God, God will honor your
[3:30] efforts. Praise God. And God will meet
[3:32] you. No matter where you have
[3:33] expectation, if you expect to see God,
[3:35] you'll see God. We just got to live in
[3:37] that atmosphere of faith. Hallelujah.
[3:40] So, I trust it'll be a blessing here.
[3:41] Uh, but we'll have service here at 3 and
[3:43] then I think is it 5:30 is the youth
[3:45] service. Okay, the youth service is at
[3:47] 5:30 up there in Sheffield. So, praise
[3:50] the
[3:51] Lord. So, I want to um you can switch
[3:53] over here. I have a few slides. I didn't
[3:54] get to everything uh but I'll be able to
[3:58] Lord willing uh preach this thought
[4:00] here. I just kind of want to continue
[4:01] where brother Diggs left off. I was very
[4:04] stirred up. I was very thankful uh for
[4:06] that message. And uh I want like to
[4:09] preach on Abraham staggered not but gave
[4:11] God glory. Hallelujah. So that's what we
[4:13] want to do today. We want to give God
[4:14] glory. Hallelujah. No matter what
[4:16] circumstance we find ourselves in. And
[4:19] here's some of the thoughts I love. I
[4:20] went listen to like I said I listened to
[4:21] it yesterday. I listened to it today. I
[4:23] just love faithb buildinging services
[4:25] like this. That's why God has
[4:26] evangelists. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[4:29] Amen. Uh so we're thankful. And uh our
[4:32] brother was sharing with us from Hebrews
[4:34] 11. It's impossible to please God
[4:36] without faith. And faith is a substance
[4:39] of things not seen. Hallelujah. So, it
[4:42] was a very good point there reminding us
[4:43] of the scripture. Walking by faith is
[4:46] believing the unseen. Praise God. Now,
[4:49] as we'll see today with Abraham, God did
[4:51] give him some visual clues before the
[4:54] promise actually came to pass.
[4:56] Hallelujah. In other words, their body
[4:58] started changing before they actually
[5:01] knew uh Sarah was expecting Isaac. And
[5:04] church, that's how it is with us. God
[5:06] will give us, brother Ram calls it
[5:07] progressive revelation. God will give us
[5:10] continue a little more
[5:11] revelation because we need it to stay
[5:14] encouraged by God's grace. God has to
[5:16] make us who don't believe, God has to
[5:18] help us believe. Praise God. Because it
[5:21] is not in our faith to believe. We don't
[5:25] overcome by our faith. We overcome by
[5:27] the faith of the son of God. Hallelujah.
[5:29] Remember that's in Galatians. Paul said,
[5:31] "The life I live, I don't live by my
[5:33] faith, but I live it by the faith of the
[5:34] son of God." So that's what that first
[5:36] faith is on the statue of man. It's his
[5:38] faith I live by. Praise God. It's a
[5:41] portion of his spirit. Faith, virtue,
[5:43] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[5:45] godliness, brotherly kindness, charity.
[5:46] Hallelujah. It's a measure of his
[5:48] spirit. Praise God. And brother uh
[5:51] brother Diggs was saying if if you can
[5:53] prove something with a natural eye, then
[5:54] it's not faith. And remember, Abraham is
[5:57] the father of faith, we are the children
[5:59] of faith. So if our father could have
[6:02] faith, we can too. Hallelujah. And you
[6:05] know, church, you can look at your
[6:06] natural dads. If if your dad could do
[6:08] something good, well, so can you. Praise
[6:10] God. Hallelujah. Maybe you can do it
[6:12] better. I hope I know my children can do
[6:15] a lot things better than me. Praise God.
[6:17] Better memory. Hallelujah.
[6:19] uh better talents, you know, and all the
[6:21] instruments they play, the tambourine
[6:23] and their song specials, they can
[6:24] already sing way better than me. Praise
[6:26] God. Hallelujah. I know they can cook a
[6:28] lot better, too. Right, Caris?
[6:30] Hallelujah. But uh spiritually speaking,
[6:33] every father wants his children uh to
[6:36] supersede what he has. Hallelujah. In
[6:38] other words, every every mother and
[6:39] father, they want their children to grow
[6:42] greater in faith than they have.
[6:43] Hallelujah. And now we're not saying
[6:46] we'll have greater faith in Abraham, but
[6:47] we do know we have greater access than
[6:49] Abraham because we're in the New
[6:51] Testament and the Bible said has better
[6:54] promises. So we do have access to better
[6:57] promises. Hallelujah. Because we have
[6:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost promise.
[7:01] Hallelujah. And then our brother told us
[7:03] faith beyond circumstances is the
[7:05] title. And so we want to uh just rejoice
[7:08] in that. And uh he told us God wants us
[7:11] to wait on him to bring us promises to
[7:13] pass rather than trying to do it
[7:15] ourselves like Ishmael. Right? Abraham
[7:18] and Sarah looked at their circumstances
[7:19] and tried to make the promise of God
[7:21] pass uh come to pass. We'll see why that
[7:23] was. We'll see why that was. God gives
[7:25] promises. We don't believe yet, but
[7:27] we'll bring them to pass. God isn't
[7:29] concerned about the circumstances. God
[7:30] allows circumstances to unlock our
[7:33] faith. Hallelujah. And God doesn't, he
[7:36] said, could never increase your faith.
[7:38] He gives you everything you need when he
[7:40] created you in the spiritual seed in
[7:42] your soul. And that was quite a
[7:43] statement to me. I never heard it like
[7:45] that before. But it's a it's a statement
[7:47] focused on the spiritual element of it
[7:50] because it's true that our faith and
[7:52] virtue is already in the spiritual seed
[7:55] that's inside of us, right? So, think of
[7:57] all the fruits of the spirit. Think of
[7:58] all the times where people will see the
[8:00] love of God in your life or they'll see
[8:02] patience in your life. It came from the
[8:04] spirit of God that was in you. And that
[8:05] spirit is a seed.
[8:08] Hallelujah. And so the reality of me,
[8:11] the reality that came to me is it's it's
[8:13] our responsibility to keep the seed in
[8:15] the right ground,
[8:17] right? Because it needs three things.
[8:19] The seed needs a ground, light, and
[8:21] water. It needs those three things. And
[8:24] Jesus in the Bible gives us all the
[8:25] symbols of what they are. The soil,
[8:28] Jesus said, is a good and honest heart.
[8:30] So if you want the promise of God to
[8:32] come to pass, always be honest.
[8:35] Especially, brother says, be honest with
[8:37] God and be honest with yourself.
[8:40] Hallelujah. If you're doing great.
[8:41] Hallelujah. Praise God. Rejoice. Live as
[8:43] high as you jump. But if you're
[8:44] struggling, be honest about that, too.
[8:47] Hallelujah. Be honest with God. That's
[8:49] the only way we can overcome. That's
[8:51] that's keeps the word of God in the
[8:53] soil. Hallelujah. And then we must keep
[8:55] the seed in the right atmosphere or the
[8:56] sun. Uh 2 Corinthians 4:6 says it's the
[8:59] light of knowledge. So we got to have
[9:02] the knowledge, the understanding of the
[9:03] word of God. We're honest and we keep uh
[9:06] the knowledge of the word sh the
[9:08] knowledge of of the word si shines on
[9:10] our life, right? Keep growing in the
[9:11] knowledge of God. And then the water
[9:14] psalm says uh Psalm 23 uh 22:3 says he
[9:18] inhabits the praises of his people.
[9:20] Hallelujah. So if we do these things, if
[9:22] we live honestly with a good heart, if
[9:25] we grow in the knowledge of God, and if
[9:27] we keep giving God praise, that seed is
[9:29] going to bring forth of its own kind.
[9:31] Hallelujah. That's right. And we start
[9:34] in the dirt, but we don't stay there.
[9:35] The son, the water unlocked the power of
[9:37] the seed. And every victory is in you
[9:39] right now. It's in the spiritual. It's
[9:40] in the spirit of God that's within you.
[9:43] Hallelujah. And faith is stronger than
[9:45] facts. I'm getting down to the end here.
[9:46] He says, Abraham and Sarah were old and
[9:48] barren, but faith changed the
[9:49] circumstances. God brought Abraham and
[9:51] Sarah to a place they believed God and
[9:53] he unlocked their faith. God unlocked
[9:56] Abraham's faith through stages until he
[9:58] had perfect faith. That's what that
[9:59] means. Perfect faith just means a true
[10:01] revelation. It just means mature faith.
[10:04] It doesn't mean you never sin. It
[10:05] doesn't mean you never make a mistake,
[10:07] but it means in that moment, God let you
[10:09] have mature faith for that moment.
[10:11] Praise God. Hallelujah. Because we know
[10:14] even after great things in brother
[10:15] Abraham's life, great things in our
[10:16] lives, great things in Abraham's life,
[10:18] amazing things, they still fell short of
[10:21] God's glory, right? So it's it's perfect
[10:23] faith. It's mature faith for the the the
[10:26] season and the time that we need it by
[10:28] God's grace. Hallelujah. And then I just
[10:31] want to bring these up. Abraham's faith
[10:32] grew after each circumstance. By the
[10:34] time Isaac was offered to offered, he
[10:36] had faith to believe in the potential
[10:39] resurrection of Isaac. This is m This is
[10:42] how much his faith increased. He he he
[10:45] told the men there when he went to
[10:46] Mariah right by Mount Zion or Zion.
[10:48] Hallelujah. Where's that? There he is.
[10:51] Mariah was right next to it. And he
[10:52] said, "Just stay here with the donkey."
[10:54] Right. And I and the lad will go yonder
[10:56] and worship and come again unto
[10:59] you. So he knew if God's asking me to
[11:02] kill him, then God's going to have to
[11:04] raise him up because God has already
[11:06] promised me through this seed through
[11:08] Isaac.
[11:10] That's real faith right there.
[11:12] Hallelujah. That's a revelation. He had
[11:14] a revelation of
[11:16] resurrection. Hallelujah. Because God
[11:18] had already made a promise. And if God
[11:20] asked him to do something, God he he has
[11:22] to do it. But he also knows God's word
[11:24] won't fail. Praise God. And then the
[11:27] Bible said in Hebrews 11:19, accounting
[11:29] that God was able to raise him up even
[11:31] from the dead. From whence also he
[11:32] received him in a figure. So God gave a
[11:35] figure through Abraham and Isaac that he
[11:37] was going to receive uh the son was
[11:40] under judgment but it was if he was
[11:42] given a pardon and he they got life back
[11:44] from the dead. It was a figure of Jesus
[11:47] Christ getting his life again. Jesus
[11:50] raised from the dead. Hallelujah.
[11:52] Oh yeah and I sorry I left off some uh
[11:55] other verses. Sometimes they copy over
[11:56] in the copy and paste and process. So oh
[11:59] I got some more to go. Sorry I thought I
[12:00] was down to the end. God will do his
[12:02] part even if you don't do your part.
[12:04] Like when Abraham lied to because God's
[12:06] promise is on the line. We should have
[12:09] re we should have received judgment at
[12:10] times but God gave us grace and favor.
[12:13] This unlocks another measure of faith in
[12:14] our lives. I like this. He said, "Do you
[12:16] believe or not? Are you a son or
[12:19] daughter of God or not?" And the church
[12:21] said, "Amen." I like that. Just
[12:23] challenge us. Are you a believer or not?
[12:25] Let's believe. Praise God. We're not
[12:27] called here to unbelief, right? We're
[12:30] called here to belief, to faith.
[12:31] Hallelujah. He says when the master
[12:33] comes, he can change every circumstance.
[12:35] He says don't cry and say, "What am I
[12:37] going to do?" He say, "S say I'm going
[12:39] to
[12:40] believe." You're going through
[12:42] circumstances in order to unlock your
[12:43] faith. Since Jesus came to his disciples
[12:46] during the storm, the same God will come
[12:48] to you in your storm. All right. Now,
[12:51] now I'm going to pick up uh from here. I
[12:53] just thought that was a good review. How
[12:54] many appreciate the review? Praise God.
[12:56] It's good to hear it again. Hallelujah.
[12:59] uh we need to be uh we need to
[13:00] understand what staggering
[13:03] means. So uh let's go back to this.
[13:05] Remember brother said every time I go to
[13:07] feeling a little depressed he turned to
[13:10] Romans. He didn't turn to the bottle. He
[13:12] turned to the Bible.
[13:14] Hallelujah. Every time you get a little
[13:16] depressed, don't turn to the things of
[13:18] the world. Yes, you might at times, but
[13:20] turn eventually to the Bible.
[13:21] Hallelujah. Brother Bam had a go-to.
[13:24] When I'm struggling, I go to Romans 4.
[13:27] So when you're struggling, go to a
[13:29] sermon, go to a song, or ask for prayer
[13:31] from that brother, that that sister.
[13:33] Have something you go to. Have a way out
[13:35] of the trial. Hallelujah. Have a plan.
[13:38] Hallelujah. Right? Have a plan. If you
[13:40] know you're going into a battle, you got
[13:41] to have a plan. Hallelujah. So, Brother
[13:43] Bam's plan was he'd go read Romans 4 and
[13:47] he'd say he wasn't Abraham wasn't weak
[13:49] in faith, but he staggered not at the
[13:52] promise of God. Hallelujah. And then
[13:55] brother man tells us you know in
[13:58] 1961 he said he was reading about
[14:00] Abraham and uh and and and Paul wrote a
[14:03] divine commentary on Abraham's life and
[14:06] he said Abraham many times got
[14:08] frustrated like we do. Anybody get
[14:09] frustrated this
[14:11] week but when but when the commentary
[14:14] was written there wasn't any of the
[14:16] frustrations mentioned. Never mention
[14:19] them at
[14:21] all. Look at Romans 4. God never
[14:23] mentions Abraham's struggle. He just
[14:26] recognizes his faith. And that's what
[14:29] God's looking at in our lives. God's
[14:31] looking at your faith. Hallelujah.
[14:33] You're walking by faith. God's looking
[14:35] at your walk. Even though you stumble,
[14:37] even though you fall, the Bible said a
[14:38] just man falls seven times, but he
[14:40] raises again. Hallelujah.
[14:43] God's looking at your walk. Are you
[14:44] walking in obedience? Are you walking
[14:47] more towards heaven? Hallelujah. That's
[14:50] right.
[14:51] God didn't mention any of his mistakes
[14:53] in Romans chapter 4 and he said see
[14:56] Abraham staggered not the promise of God
[14:58] but was strong giving praise to God
[15:00] that's the way I hope mine will be wrote
[15:02] up there is not my mistakes and
[15:05] everything but just what I try to do the
[15:08] intention of my heart to do for God's
[15:10] people Abraham was just trying to
[15:13] believe God hallelujah he was just
[15:15] trying to stay there in the promised
[15:17] land sometimes he got scared he left the
[15:19] promised land but he was trying to stay
[15:21] there. Hallelujah. We're trying to obey
[15:24] the word of God. So that means God won't
[15:26] lead us uh God won't lead us outside the
[15:28] word of God, but God will lead us back
[15:30] when we purposely leave. God will bring
[15:32] us back to the promise. Hallelujah. Just
[15:34] like he did Abraham. He wasn't trying to
[15:36] make mistakes, but he just made
[15:38] mistakes. Hallelujah. And God will
[15:40] strengthen us and God will bring us back
[15:42] to the place where we can give God
[15:44] praise. Hallelujah. That's right. I just
[15:47] And that's my prayer, too. Lord, just
[15:49] look at the attention of my heart. Just
[15:52] look at what I want to do for God's
[15:54] people. Please don't look at my
[15:56] mistakes. I just want the people to be
[15:58] blessed. Hallelujah. That's what I say
[16:00] as a preacher, as a song leader. Lord,
[16:02] just forget my mistakes. I'm just trying
[16:05] to point the people to you. I just want
[16:07] to see them overcome just like they want
[16:09] to see me overcome. Praise God. We want
[16:12] to see each other overcome.
[16:15] Hallelujah. That's right. So, see, we
[16:18] need to have hope for ourselves.
[16:19] Hallelujah. Hope for each other by the
[16:21] grace of God because we know we're going
[16:24] to stand before the judgment seat.
[16:25] Hallelujah. I love this one. Remember,
[16:27] let's go back to uh Joshua and Moses. I
[16:30] love this one. He said, this is one of
[16:32] the just a beautiful quote. We find God
[16:35] in spite of all the failure Moses had,
[16:37] he glorified himself. He never made it
[16:39] over the promised land. He murdered a
[16:41] man. God still had his hand on him.
[16:46] Think about that. A murderer. And God
[16:49] still had his hand protecting a
[16:51] murderer. Hallelujah. What a consolation
[16:54] that must have been to Joshua when he
[16:56] heard God say, "As I was with a
[16:58] murderer, so will I be with you." Oh,
[17:02] amen. As God was with others who
[17:04] struggled, he'll be with me in my
[17:06] struggles. Praise God. Think about that.
[17:09] Or Abraham, as God was with a liar, I'll
[17:12] still be with you. Abraham lied.
[17:15] Hallelujah. As God was a David, an
[17:18] adulterer and a murderer, as God was
[17:20] with him, God will be with us.
[17:21] Hallelujah.
[17:23] He don't throw us away, church.
[17:26] Hallelujah. The Bible says all those who
[17:28] come unto him, he will receive. The
[17:31] Bible said whosoever comes, he will give
[17:33] him water that flows freely. Praise God.
[17:36] We just got to keep coming back to the
[17:38] father. Hallelujah.
[17:40] Amen. And I love that. Although if I'm
[17:44] trying and I fail, God won't leave me.
[17:48] Church, even if you fail, God won't
[17:50] leave you. And the church said, "Amen."
[17:53] I need one of those
[17:55] amens. I don't have much confidence in
[17:57] anybody that's too afraid to do
[17:58] anything. So, see, church, at some
[18:00] point, we need to find our ministries
[18:01] and do it. Praise God. You're never
[18:04] going to be perfect in any ministry you
[18:05] try to do, whether it's food or clothing
[18:07] or music or preaching. You're never
[18:09] going to be perfect in any ministry, but
[18:11] you got to find what God called you to
[18:12] do. Praise God.
[18:16] You know, in fact, I've talked to
[18:17] numerous preachers over the years, and
[18:18] they're so thankful for the ministry
[18:20] that they're have because it keeps them
[18:21] away from the temptations of the world.
[18:24] It's their focus. They got to like me as
[18:26] a pastor, I've got to go study. I've got
[18:28] to go preach. Some many times that's
[18:29] hard maybe on my flesh, but I love it
[18:31] because it gives me a ministry. It gives
[18:33] me a purpose. Praise God. It gives me
[18:36] something to do. Hallelujah. It makes a
[18:38] lot easier to run from trials and
[18:40] temptations when I know I've got to do
[18:41] this, God's called me to do it because I
[18:44] know even if I fail, God won't leave me.
[18:46] He'll still be faithful to me. He'll rec
[18:48] help me recover myself. Amen. He won't
[18:51] leave me. He can never forsake us.
[18:53] Hallelujah.
[18:54] It's impossible. Praise God. That's why
[18:57] we get addicted. The Bible said you get
[18:58] addicted to the ministry of the saints.
[19:01] See, church, you got to find what your
[19:03] ministry is and then get addicted to it.
[19:06] I love coming to church. I'm addicted to
[19:08] it because I get to see the faith in
[19:09] your lives. I get to close my eyes and
[19:12] think about Jesus coming back. I get to
[19:14] cry and weep and rejoice. I get to clap.
[19:17] I can act however I want. I can give God
[19:19] all the praise I want. I'm addicted to
[19:21] that. I'm addicted to God's spirit.
[19:23] Praise God. That's what everybody here
[19:26] needs. Some ministry that you're
[19:28] addicted to. You You give yourself to
[19:30] the ministry, God blesses you in it. You
[19:32] can recognize God is blessing you and
[19:34] then you just stay dedicated to that and
[19:36] God will bless you in that ministry.
[19:41] Hallelujah. Glory to God. God had
[19:44] commissioned Moses. His failures meant
[19:47] nothing. Your your mistakes mean nothing
[19:50] to God. And the church said, we always
[19:54] think, "Oh, my failures, they mean so
[19:55] much to God." God's just like, "Just
[19:57] confess them. Move on.
[19:59] Just keep marching towards the promised
[20:01] land." Hallelujah. They mean nothing.
[20:03] They They don't mean anything to God
[20:04] because God's already got a provided
[20:06] sacrifice. Hallelujah. He's already paid
[20:08] for the sins. Hallelujah. You just have
[20:11] to stop and acknowledge your sin and
[20:13] say, "God, forgive that. I'm moving on.
[20:15] Let me be stronger this time."
[20:18] See, his favors didn't mean anything.
[20:21] God knowed what? God knowed his heart.
[20:23] God knows your greatest desire in your
[20:25] heart is to serve him and please him.
[20:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[20:30] how it must have felt when God said,
[20:32] "I'll not fail thee." I can't wait till
[20:34] Sight and Sound gets a hold of this.
[20:35] Hallelujah. He said, "I'll not fail
[20:38] thee." Look at that. God won't fail us,
[20:40] church. As I was with Moses, so I'll be
[20:43] with you. No man shall stand before you
[20:45] all the days of your life. I'll destroy
[20:48] and divide. I'll make the way clear,
[20:50] church. God's going to make your path
[20:52] clear. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't be
[20:54] afraid. I'm with you and I'll see you
[20:56] through. What a commission to this man.
[20:58] Hallelujah. Brother said Joshua
[21:00] represents the church. Moses represent
[21:02] the law. Right? So Joshua represents the
[21:04] New Testament believer as God was with
[21:06] the Old Testament. God will be with us.
[21:08] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Now let's look
[21:11] at this here.
[21:13] Stagger. What does stagger mean? Now I
[21:16] emphasized definition three and
[21:19] four. It means to withdraw or desert.
[21:24] So uh and he separate oneself in a
[21:26] hostile spirit. So see now church we all
[21:30] get upset. We all we all make mistakes
[21:31] sometimes. But Abraham never left God
[21:34] fully. Right now even Lot Lot even
[21:38] deserted and he withdrew himself from
[21:39] Abraham. Now God knew he needed that.
[21:42] But brother said Lot forgot about the
[21:44] promised son. So Lot stopped
[21:47] fellowshipping with Abraham and look
[21:49] what his life turned into.
[21:52] So see, Lot staggered at the promise of
[21:54] God, right? He knew what Abraham had
[21:57] been promised, but he staggered at that.
[21:58] The Bible said he got his eyes on Sodom
[22:01] and they started moving down there and
[22:02] he moved progressively into Sodom till
[22:04] he became a leader at the gates. Ram
[22:06] says like a mayor, some type of a judge
[22:09] in Sodom, a homosexual overrun city. He
[22:12] became a mayor in
[22:14] it. That was not the place for a child
[22:17] of God. So see, he deserted. He
[22:19] staggered at the promise of God. But
[22:22] Abraham didn't stagger at the promise of
[22:24] God.
[22:26] Hallelujah. Now, see, he lied, right? He
[22:29] lied a couple times. He opposed God, but
[22:31] he kept asking for repentance. He kept
[22:33] trusting in God.
[22:36] Hallelujah. So, see, he didn't stagger
[22:38] at the pro. The Bible says he did not
[22:40] stagger. So, see, when we make mistakes,
[22:43] what do we do? We just we just keep
[22:44] coming back to God. And if we keep
[22:46] coming back to God, God doesn't hold it
[22:48] against us. God forgives it. Praise God.
[22:52] Hallelujah. Because we're the children
[22:54] of Abraham. Hallelujah. That's right. Ab
[22:58] God forgave Abraham's unbelief. At some
[23:01] point during his 99th year, he received
[23:03] faith to believe. At some point, only
[23:06] Sarah laughed in Genesis 18:12. Abraham
[23:09] wasn't laughing anymore in Genesis 18,
[23:11] proving God was helping him be stronger
[23:13] in his faith. Abraham laughed in Genesis
[23:17] 17, but Abraham did not laugh in Genesis
[23:19] 18.
[23:21] See, the more God, the more experiences
[23:23] you have with God, the more your faith
[23:25] will believe. The stronger your faith
[23:28] will become. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[23:32] Abraham's visitations from God persuaded
[23:35] him to believe. So, let's pray for more
[23:37] visitations from God. Hallelujah. Yes.
[23:40] Glory to God. I like what? Let me read
[23:42] these quotes. But Abraham didn't stagger
[23:44] anywhere at all of unbelief. He believed
[23:46] that God was able to perform that which
[23:48] he had promised. That God would prove
[23:49] his word no matter how long it took. But
[23:52] instead of getting weaker each time like
[23:53] we are prone to do, he got stronger all
[23:55] the time. If it didn't happen today,
[23:58] tomorrow be a greater miracle because
[24:00] it's one day older.
[24:03] It's just like wine. It's going to get
[24:04] older. The further you wait, the better
[24:06] it gets, right? The more power it gets.
[24:08] That's how a promise of God is.
[24:10] Hallelujah. Amen. That was God. That was
[24:13] God in Abraham, for he knowed that God
[24:15] proved all of his words to be so.
[24:20] Now, I like this quote. He says, "Uh,
[24:22] Sarah was included in it." God never
[24:24] gave Sarah the promise. He gave Abraham
[24:26] the promise, but Sarah was included. He
[24:28] made the promise in Christ Jesus. And I
[24:30] was included in him. You were too. See?
[24:34] So, all the promises to Christ, we were
[24:36] in Christ. Hallelujah. So, all those
[24:38] promises include us. Hallelujah. And
[24:41] then he reads Romans 4, right? And then
[24:43] he says, "It wasn't written for their
[24:45] sakes." He said, "Who was delivered for
[24:47] our offense and was raised again for our
[24:49] justification." Oh, brother, I could
[24:51] just hit the devil in the face with that
[24:54] 365 days a year. You're a liar. There's
[24:57] the word. I am healed. Praise God. So,
[25:00] Brother tells us you got to take the
[25:02] word and you got to slap the devil with
[25:04] the word. You got to slap or just use it
[25:07] like a sword. Cut him away. Brother
[25:08] says, "Cut him away 300." That means
[25:11] every day take the word of God and
[25:13] overcome the devil. Praise God. You can
[25:16] do it. You're Abraham's children. Praise
[25:18] God. You're the seed of Abraham. Church,
[25:20] don't forget Abraham was a common uh
[25:23] shepherd, but he was also a general of
[25:25] his makeshift
[25:27] army. What was it? 318 men. And it was
[25:29] just a very small army. But church,
[25:32] that's what we are. We're an army as
[25:34] well. Praise God. I need you to fight
[25:36] strong. I need to fight strong. Each
[25:38] person must fight the good fight of
[25:40] faith. Praise God.
[25:42] Each person must take our position in
[25:44] the army of the Lord. Fight the devil.
[25:47] Fight for each other. Let's be
[25:48] victorious. Praise God.
[25:52] Hallelujah. Now, we can all see Abraham
[25:56] sins throughout his life. Remember this
[25:57] chart I did a couple years ago? I think
[25:59] it was maybe two years by now. Remember,
[26:01] Abraham was an idoltor in he was
[26:03] actually making idols, the Bible said.
[26:05] But then he was called to Canaan and
[26:08] then to Heron. It was 600 miles he
[26:11] walked. That's a long ways to walk.
[26:13] Praise God. By faith. All he heard was
[26:16] God said, "Go to the land I'm going to
[26:18] lead you to." He traveled 600 miles by
[26:21] faith. But even in that church, look, he
[26:23] has all these mistakes at the beginning
[26:25] of his walk. If you're a new Christian,
[26:27] don't feel bad. All new Christians have
[26:29] a lot of mistakes at the beginning.
[26:30] Amen. And the church said, "Look, in
[26:33] this just in one chapter, he has three
[26:35] mistakes when he just became a new
[26:37] believer.
[26:39] Oh, give it some time." Hallelujah. Give
[26:41] it some time. You'll get stronger as
[26:42] time goes by. Hallelujah. I'm a witness.
[26:45] I was telling brother Chris, you know,
[26:46] but even before I got married, there
[26:48] were certain things I struggled with.
[26:49] Uh, and I never thought I'd get the
[26:50] victory. One of them is tobacco, but by
[26:53] the time I was married, I had victory
[26:54] over all of them. Praise God. It might
[26:56] have took three years. It might take
[26:57] four years, but just keep fighting the
[26:59] good fight of faith. Just keep getting
[27:01] stronger on God's word. Just keep
[27:03] feeding that white dog. You'll be
[27:04] stronger all the time. Hallelujah.
[27:07] Just keep doing it. Just keep coming
[27:08] back to God. You'll get stronger as time
[27:11] goes on. And then he has to travel 400
[27:14] miles to Sheichum. And then 20 more to
[27:17] Bethl. And then he went down to Egypt,
[27:19] 225 miles out of the will of God.
[27:24] That's a long way to go out of the will
[27:25] of God. It's 170 miles to our hometown,
[27:29] Liberty Center. So, think about that's
[27:31] three hours in the car. That's a Now,
[27:33] let's apply that. That's a long way
[27:35] spiritually out of the plan of God. I
[27:37] don't live there anymore because it's a
[27:39] long way away. Abraham went a long way
[27:42] out of the promise of God, but God never
[27:44] forsook him. You can go a long way out
[27:48] of the plan of God. God will never
[27:50] forsake you. Hallelujah.
[27:52] That's right. And then he when he gets
[27:54] there, he lies to Pharaoh.
[27:58] Hallelujah. That was justification. Now
[28:00] he gets some sanctification. He starts,
[28:02] he returns. He comes all the way back to
[28:04] where he left God. And church, that's
[28:06] what you got to do. If you sin, you got
[28:08] to come right back to where you sin. And
[28:09] tell God, you're sorry and you're wrong.
[28:13] And take responsibility and say, say,
[28:15] God, I've sinned against heaven. I fell
[28:17] into the pleasure. I fell into the
[28:19] anger. I fell into this trap. It was my
[28:21] fault. Forgive me, but I'm coming back
[28:24] to worship. Praise God. Amen.
[28:26] Hallelujah. And I know you'll receive me
[28:28] because you call me to this land. It's
[28:30] the spiritual land of the body of
[28:32] Christ.
[28:33] Hallelujah. And then he finally obeys
[28:36] where God said don't take or separate
[28:38] yourself from
[28:39] Lot. And then uh then he Abraham
[28:42] delivers Lot by traveling 160 miles to
[28:44] fight and then 160
[28:47] back. Then he meets Melzdc on the return
[28:50] to Canaan. He meets God in flesh.
[28:54] Because he fought for his brother and
[28:55] sister, church, just keep praying for
[28:58] your loved ones. Fight for them. How can
[29:01] you do it? Most time they don't even
[29:02] want to hear it when you talk to them to
[29:03] their face. So all you can do is pray
[29:05] for them. Hallelujah. Most of the time
[29:08] they don't want to hear about it. They
[29:09] want to hear about serpent seed. They
[29:10] want to hear about the Holy Ghost or the
[29:12] water baptism trinity. They don't want
[29:13] to hear about that. So alls we can do is
[29:15] pray for them. In fact, fighting on our
[29:17] knees is the most powerful thing we can
[29:19] do. Praise God.
[29:22] Hallelujah. And then God comes in
[29:24] Genesis 15 to confirm the covenant with
[29:26] the five sacrifices. But then he makes
[29:28] an awful mistake in chapter 16. He takes
[29:30] Hagar, another red blot upon his
[29:33] life. Right, church? We all got red
[29:36] blotss on our lives. Why did I do that?
[29:39] Why? Why did I let somebody talk me into
[29:41] that?
[29:42] Hallelujah. The word is
[29:45] amen. I got to get me an amen card. And
[29:48] I'm going to laminate it too. They can
[29:49] last a long time. And then in chapter
[29:52] 17, he gets a revelation. I'm El Shadai.
[29:55] God said, live before me perfect. In
[29:58] other words, be it's time for maturity.
[30:00] It's time to rise up and be more mature.
[30:03] Hallelujah. And then he circumcises
[30:05] them, which is a type of the baptism of
[30:06] the Holy Ghost. Circumcis fleshly tables
[30:08] of our hearts. But then God says,
[30:11] "You're going to have a child." And he
[30:12] laughs at God. He's still laughing at
[30:14] God. Although in type, he's born again.
[30:16] He still laughs at God. And then in
[30:18] Genesis 18, God comes to him there in
[30:20] Hebron. He's out waiting for God. He
[30:23] knows God is coming and he's out there
[30:26] sitting and God comes and he gets the
[30:28] last sign before Isaac arrives.
[30:32] Hallelujah. But then Sarah lies to
[30:35] God. Abraham believes, but Sarah
[30:38] lies. See a little pattern in the
[30:41] family. Lie, lie, lie. See a little
[30:44] pattern in the family. The church said,
[30:47] That's why you know spirits are in
[30:50] families right?
[30:52] You know brother talked about the Bible
[30:53] talks about it God visits the iniquity
[30:55] on the next generation.
[30:58] So a lot of times the things your
[30:59] parents struggle with you're going to
[31:00] struggle with. But you've got a greater
[31:03] power to overcome. Hallelujah. I'm
[31:05] talking about if your parents weren't
[31:06] believers. If they're believers praise
[31:08] God you got a blessing. But then you're
[31:09] you might you're gonna you're going to
[31:10] fight something. Praise God. You're
[31:12] gonna you're gonna have some battle to
[31:13] overcome. But just know that, you know,
[31:16] there wasn't murder in his family line
[31:18] like Abra, like Moses's and David's.
[31:21] Think of all the murder in David's
[31:23] family line. God is going to
[31:25] forgive, right? Because that wasn't
[31:26] David's line. His sons and David, David
[31:29] had killed Uriah, but not in Abraham. He
[31:32] had a a kind of dishonest heart, but yet
[31:35] he was still called the friend of God.
[31:37] Oh. Oh my. Thank God for his mercy and
[31:40] his grace. Praise God.
[31:43] But Sarah lied to God. But God said,
[31:45] "You will have a a child." Then Abraham
[31:48] intercedes for Lot. They see Sodom
[31:50] destroyed. Abraham and Aimilec uh I'm
[31:52] sorry. Abraham goes takes he leaves the
[31:54] promised land again. Leaves 40 miles out
[31:56] of the promise of God. He's a long way
[31:59] from the promise of God. Yet God still
[32:01] blesses
[32:02] him. God still protects his wife despite
[32:06] his cowardice. The Bible says he was
[32:08] coward. He's afraid of his
[32:10] life. And then in beautiful chapter 21,
[32:14] Isaac, they finally receive the promise
[32:16] he's been waiting for for 25 years.
[32:19] Hallelujah. This church, I think it's on
[32:21] our 19th anniversary this year, if I'm
[32:22] not mistaken, coming up in June, we've
[32:24] only, some of us have waited 19 years.
[32:26] Well, let's be Abraham's seed. Let's
[32:28] keep waiting. Praise God. If Abraham can
[32:30] wait, so can you. Praise God. Let's keep
[32:33] believing God. Hallelujah. Let's trust
[32:36] God. And then Hagar gets cast out. They
[32:39] go down uh they go down to Bar Beers. Uh
[32:42] and then the offering of Isaac. They got
[32:44] to go 55 miles there to Mariah. Uh then
[32:48] they come back with the victory. Sarah
[32:49] dies. Elazar gets Rebecca. And then
[32:52] Abraham weds Coutura. Abraham dies in
[32:55] Hebron 30 miles. They travel 30 more
[32:58] miles. Now everybody see that? Let me go
[33:00] back. Everybody see what happened there?
[33:02] What happened?
[33:04] All the mistakes went away because the
[33:06] Bible said he staggered not at the
[33:09] promise of God. So when it's all done,
[33:12] God wipes it all away. And God said,
[33:15] "You never staggered. You are the father
[33:18] of faith." Hallelujah.
[33:20] God doesn't record all those red marks.
[33:22] God forgives all that. He remembers our
[33:25] flesh is just dust. And we have the law
[33:28] of sin in our members. He's looking at
[33:30] the seed. He's looking at the spirit of
[33:32] God inside of us. Hallelujah. And God
[33:35] says, "You staggered not. You never
[33:37] left. You stayed faithful and your faith
[33:39] kept you faithful." Hallelujah. Amen.
[33:42] That That's how God looks at it. He
[33:45] takes all the marks off.
[33:48] And he says, "You're a father of faith.
[33:51] I want every believer all the way to
[33:53] 2025. I want every believer to look at
[33:55] Abraham and say, "That's my daddy."
[33:59] Hallelujah. That's my daddy. If he could
[34:02] overcome, if he could pick up despite
[34:04] his mistakes and keep pressing God, if
[34:06] he could travel all those hundreds of
[34:08] miles and go through all the the all all
[34:10] the mental battles the devil tried to
[34:12] get on him, if he traveled all that and
[34:14] he stayed faithful, so can we be
[34:16] faithful. Praise God. Amen.
[34:21] Think about that. For 55 miles, the
[34:23] devil was whispering, "Your son's going
[34:24] to die. Your son's going to die." He had
[34:26] to just say, "No, God's going to
[34:27] resurrect him. God already told me. God
[34:29] already told me.
[34:30] And some of us, I drive 13 miles to
[34:32] work. I got to battle the devil for 13
[34:34] miles on my drive to work. I got to do
[34:36] the same thing. But at least I get to
[34:37] ride in the car, you know. But 55 miles,
[34:41] you got to constantly deal with those
[34:43] attacks, church. We just got to cast
[34:44] down the lies. Amen. Amen. He said,
[34:46] "Take out your Bible and smack Satan
[34:48] with it for 365 days." Come on, church.
[34:51] Amen. That's right. Be like Abraham. Go
[34:54] through the journeys of life. Go through
[34:56] the trials of life. And don't stagger.
[34:59] Stay in the promise. Stay obedient. And
[35:01] you'll be called a child of faith.
[35:03] Hallelujah.
[35:04] Amen.
[35:06] You won't be the father. You'll be the
[35:07] child of faith.
[35:11] Now, did you remember this? I I just
[35:13] realized this this morning. God had to
[35:15] come five times to Abraham about
[35:18] Isaac. Five
[35:20] times.
[35:23] Hallelujah. One time wasn't enough,
[35:25] Brother Patrick.
[35:27] He needed
[35:28] reminders. Hallelujah. That's why I like
[35:31] that reminders app on my phone. Ah,
[35:33] yeah. I would have forgot that if it
[35:34] wasn't for that app. That's just a
[35:36] that's a copy of what God does. God just
[35:38] sends us
[35:39] reminders. I'm going to keep my word.
[35:42] I'm going to make you ready for the
[35:44] rapture. I am going to save you. I am
[35:47] going to fill you with the Holy Ghost. I
[35:48] am going to heal you. Praise God.
[35:52] Think of all these reminders. God had to
[35:54] visit him five times.
[35:57] to make sure he
[35:59] believed. Now, let me just review real
[36:02] briefly. Brother Ram said five has at
[36:04] least three meanings. Five means grace.
[36:08] Five means laboring grace. So, you got
[36:11] to labor for this. You labor in this
[36:13] favor and also means redemption, which
[36:15] means to buy back. The number five, God
[36:17] visits him five times. Why? God was
[36:19] showing Abraham his
[36:21] favor and also his labor, right? because
[36:24] he had to travel a lot of
[36:26] miles. Church, he walked many miles out
[36:29] of the plan of God, but God always
[36:31] brought him back. In other words, you
[36:33] can walk so far in the permissive will
[36:36] of God. Maybe you thought you never go
[36:37] 55 miles out of the per permissive will
[36:39] out of the perfect will of God. Do you
[36:40] understand what I'm saying? Maybe you
[36:42] thought I never go 400 miles or 600
[36:45] miles out of the plan of God. But God
[36:47] will help you walk back to where you
[36:49] left him. Hallelujah. It's got to work.
[36:52] This is the plan. We all and the Bible
[36:55] said we all walk in the faith of our
[36:56] father Abraham. Hallelujah.
[37:00] Brother Ram said five is the number of
[37:02] redemption and there's five letters in
[37:04] Jesus. Jes su f a saved by grace through
[37:07] faith. Right? Hallelujah. There's a
[37:11] five-fold restoration if a man steal an
[37:13] ox. Four-fold restoration if you stole a
[37:15] sheep. Jesus has five letters. Faith has
[37:17] five letters. Grace has five letters.
[37:19] Sarah has five letters. Brother said
[37:22] five is a number of grace. He's perfect
[37:24] in numerals. He's perfect in his word.
[37:27] He's perfect in his action. He's perfect
[37:29] in everything because he's a perfect
[37:31] God.
[37:32] Jesus had five wounds. Amen. That was
[37:35] God's grace to wound him that he might
[37:38] heal us. Praise God.
[37:41] Two wounds in his hands, two wounds in
[37:42] his feet, pierced on his side. God uh
[37:45] had grace to heal us through putting the
[37:48] punishment on the Lord Jesus. Talk about
[37:50] laboring grace. He labored for us on the
[37:52] cross with five wounds. And with his
[37:55] stripes, we are what? We're healed.
[37:58] Hallelujah. Because of grace. Amen.
[38:01] The Old Testament, you were redeemed or
[38:04] brought back into fellowship with God
[38:05] through five
[38:07] offerings. Sin offering, trespass, burnt
[38:09] offering, meat or meal offering, or the
[38:12] peace
[38:12] offering. Hallelujah.
[38:15] Everybody remembering this a little bit?
[38:17] Even David picked up five stones, right?
[38:20] He said, which was uh grace. Jesus s a
[38:24] t- h g r a
[38:26] ce. Even David defeated the Goliath by
[38:29] grace. And we saw that a couple weeks
[38:31] ago. Goliath represented the cross.
[38:33] Death.
[38:35] Hallelujah. And Jesus was out there all
[38:37] alone. We weren't out there with him. We
[38:39] couldn't defeat Goliath, but our
[38:40] champion defeated death. Hallelujah.
[38:43] Amen. He did it by grace. Hallelujah.
[38:46] Amen. By the grace of
[38:49] God. Now, I'm not going to go through
[38:50] all these, but if you want to hear me
[38:52] preach it, I'll give you the link to the
[38:53] sermon. Hallelujah. But there's a lot of
[38:55] fives. I just want to get to a couple
[38:58] more. He said, "Grace grace gave them a
[39:02] prophet, Israel. Grace gave them the
[39:04] pillar of fire. Grace gave them a lamb,
[39:06] a sacrificial lamb. Grace gave them
[39:07] power. Grace gave them deliverance.
[39:10] Grace gave them victory. Grace gave them
[39:11] all these things. and they danced in the
[39:13] spirit and shouted and praised God about
[39:15] it. Church, we ought to dance sometimes
[39:17] to tell God, "We're thankful for the
[39:19] grace.
[39:21] God, give me every part of my Christian
[39:23] walk. It was all given as a favor. I
[39:27] didn't earn it. God gave it to us by
[39:29] grace."
[39:33] Hallelujah. Now, I don't have time for
[39:34] all these. These are all beautiful
[39:35] nuggets, but I'm not going to go through
[39:37] all these. Go. You can go back and
[39:39] listen to it. It was I Jose and I
[39:41] enjoyed it. I know he was here back in
[39:43] 2018, I think that was,
[39:46] brother. Hallelujah. Elijah comes five
[39:48] times. My uh brother was born at five
[39:52] o'clock in the morning. Hallelujah.
[39:55] Grace. Grace to the gentile church ages.
[39:58] Hallelujah.
[40:00] Uh third Paul had five
[40:03] manifestations. I'm just going to go
[40:05] through these quickly.
[40:07] Yes. Uh I feel like there's one more I
[40:10] want to get to. Yeah, there it is. Five
[40:12] is the number of laboring grace and even
[40:15] labor has five letters in the English
[40:17] language and he talks about Jesus. Okay,
[40:19] so I just wanted you to see that it
[40:20] represents grace, laboring grace and
[40:23] redemption and the church said so how
[40:25] many times did God visit Abraham five
[40:28] times? So in other words, Abraham needed
[40:31] grace.
[40:33] I'm going to go back to that visual real
[40:35] quick just uh real quick. the first
[40:38] time. Now listen, I'm gonna go through
[40:39] these five times. If you want to write
[40:40] them down, you can. You read it. You
[40:42] check me up on this. Genesis 12, one,
[40:44] two, three. One, two, and three. This is
[40:46] the refer the first recorded promise.
[40:48] And it's very general. God just says,
[40:50] "Go there to the land, and I'm going to
[40:52] make a nation out of you." He didn't
[40:53] even talk about any children
[40:55] yet. So, he just said, "Okay, I'm going
[40:57] to this place. I'm going to have a
[40:59] nation." I don't know how. Remember, he
[41:01] thought it was going to be Eleazar.
[41:02] Remember that? He thought uh Eleazar was
[41:04] going to be his heir. Remember that?
[41:07] Well, got a promise. But see, God would
[41:10] have even despite his mistakes, God was
[41:12] going to go show him more about the body
[41:14] change. Ah, the rapture glory. Verse
[41:18] third, uh, Genesis 13 verses 14- 16.
[41:22] After he separates from Lot, now God
[41:24] tells him, you're going to have
[41:26] seed. So, here God tells him, you're
[41:28] going to have seed. First, you're going
[41:29] to be a father of nations. Now, you're
[41:31] going to have seed. Okay? So, I'm going
[41:33] to be a father. I'm not. I'm 75, 80
[41:36] years old, still haven't had a child.
[41:38] Church, don't be discouraged. God has
[41:39] the right time for everything. Amen.
[41:43] Hallelujah. And here God promises him a
[41:46] seed. In verse 16, I'll make thy seed as
[41:49] the dust of the earth. Now, what a
[41:50] promise. A 75y old man and no children.
[41:53] I'm going to make your seed as the dust
[41:55] of the earth. Man, I wipe, brother
[41:57] Austin, I wipe the dust off my computer
[41:58] every couple of days. Like, where is all
[42:00] this dust coming from?
[42:02] And God told Abraham, "Your seed's going
[42:04] to be like the dust." Amen. There's
[42:07] going to be believers. Oh, the believers
[42:09] are going to be everywhere. And he
[42:10] hadn't had one child yet.
[42:14] Hallelujah. And the Bible said he never
[42:16] staggered one
[42:18] time. Praise God. He He never left God.
[42:21] He kept believing God's promise. I'll
[42:23] stay with God because I know he's a
[42:25] living God. Hallelujah. I don't know how
[42:28] he's going to do it, but I know he's
[42:29] going to do it. Praise God.
[42:32] I don't even understand all the details.
[42:33] I just know he promised me.
[42:37] So whatever God promises you, whatever
[42:39] he promises, he has to bring it to
[42:42] pass. And then God visits him in Genesis
[42:45] 15, he confirms it for the third time.
[42:50] But now he says this, Genesis 15:4 and
[42:54] 5, he says, he's already got Ishmael. He
[42:57] says, "He will not be your heir, but he
[42:59] that shall come forth out of thine own
[43:01] boughs shall be thine heir." But he
[43:04] brought him forth abroad and said, 'Look
[43:06] now toward the heaven, tell the stars,
[43:07] if thou be able to number them, so shall
[43:10] thy seed be. Hallelujah. Now he goes
[43:13] from the dust, he remember Simon
[43:15] preached on that. From the dust to the
[43:17] stars. Hallelujah. That's how Abraham's
[43:19] seed are. They start on the earth and
[43:21] they go up to heaven. Hallelujah.
[43:24] The fourth time God visits him is
[43:27] Genesis 17:es
[43:30] 1-8. But verse four says, "You'll be the
[43:32] father of many nations." Here in
[43:35] 17, he gives him more information on the
[43:39] same
[43:41] revelation.
[43:43] Hallelujah. Now, let me read it. It's
[43:45] verse six. And I'll make thee exceeding
[43:48] fruitful, and I'll make nations of thee,
[43:50] and kings shall come out of thee. Now,
[43:52] kings are going to be coming out of him.
[43:55] My goodness. This better, this gets
[43:57] better and better. All right, church. As
[44:00] you serve God, the promises get better
[44:02] and better. Hallelujah. God is going to
[44:05] save us, take us to heaven. He's going
[44:07] to rapture us whether we live or die. If
[44:09] we die, we're blessed. We get to rise
[44:11] first.
[44:12] Hallelujah. The promises get better and
[44:15] better as the time goes on.
[44:18] Hallelujah.
[44:22] And then he says it's going to be an
[44:23] everlasting covenant. And Abraham still
[44:25] laughed at God in verse 17. The Bible
[44:27] said Abraham laughed. Well, I don't know
[44:29] how you're going to do it,
[44:31] God. But now we get to Genesis 18. There
[44:35] 17:18. That's where he visits. And
[44:37] remember that visit was a a prefigure of
[44:39] brother Brandham's ministry because it
[44:41] was a it was the son of man visiting
[44:43] Abraham. But we didn't get the son of
[44:45] man. We got a son of man, brother
[44:47] Brandham, a prophet of God. But the son
[44:50] of man was anointing him Jesus.
[44:52] Hallelujah. And remember church, brother
[44:54] said that's thus sayith the Lord. That
[44:56] was the last sign. God visiting Abraham
[44:59] and Sarah in the flesh was the last sign
[45:01] before the body change. So brother's
[45:03] ministry was the last sign to the
[45:05] Gentiles before the rapture. It's thus
[45:07] sayaith the Lord.
[45:10] I know that's a statement. That's a
[45:11] quite a statement to make. That's hard
[45:13] for some people to swallow. But as
[45:14] always, prove it by the word.
[45:17] Hallelujah. Look at all these other
[45:19] churches and all the sins they love
[45:20] compared to the messa churches who love
[45:22] the word of God. Who's the seed of
[45:25] Abraham? All those who love his
[45:27] appearing. All those who want to see
[45:29] Jesus Christ manifest. They want to be
[45:31] born again. They want to be filled with
[45:32] the spirit. They want to see Jesus break
[45:34] through the clouds. And they want to be
[45:35] taken away before the tribulation.
[45:38] Hallelujah.
[45:40] All right, everybody getting tired here.
[45:41] So, let me try to How much time do I got
[45:43] here? Okay, I'm Okay, I'm doing good.
[45:46] All
[45:47] right. Now, I'm just starting to feel
[45:49] good now. Praise God.
[45:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, God visits
[45:55] and and then he says in verse 10, I will
[45:57] certainly return unto thee into the time
[45:59] of life. And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall
[46:01] have a son. Now, like brother Dig said,
[46:03] now Abraham seen too much. He's not
[46:05] going to doubt God anymore.
[46:08] I've seen too much. He even come and
[46:10] visits my house. Before he just talked
[46:13] to me by vision, but now he comes even
[46:15] to my house. Oh, may God visit our
[46:16] houses. Amen. May the prince of God
[46:19] visit our home to prove that God's going
[46:21] to be with us all the way to the end.
[46:23] Hallelujah. God's going to visit us. And
[46:25] so now, Abraham, don't doubt anymore.
[46:27] Well, praise God. If he if he's been if
[46:28] he if he's told me five times, five is
[46:31] enough. Five is grace. Hallelujah. I
[46:34] believe now because God's grace has
[46:36] caused me to believe.
[46:39] Oh, glory to God.
[46:42] That's
[46:44] right. So, there you go, church. Five
[46:47] times. How many appreciate that? By
[46:49] God's grace, I want you to see it. Five
[46:52] times. Five times God had to come and
[46:55] say, "You're going to be a father and
[46:57] it's going to be through your wife,
[46:58] Sarah. Five times you're going to have a
[47:01] body change. You're gonna see you're
[47:04] gonna see your wife's body change." And
[47:06] that's what I love about Brother Digs.
[47:07] brought that out when when Abraham went
[47:09] down there with me Aimilec he'd already
[47:11] seen his start part of his faith was
[47:14] becoming
[47:15] sight so he was seeing his wife is
[47:17] becoming young this king wants to marry
[47:20] my 90 I'm sorry my 89year-old
[47:23] wife right Abraham's like just lie and
[47:26] say I'm just your stepbrother or
[47:28] something like that I'm your step
[47:30] because she's she's 89 but yet she
[47:32] turned beautiful but still in that
[47:34] moment he fell short of the glory of
[47:36] God. Was God done with him? No. God just
[47:39] told him, "Stand up. Wipe that off. Come
[47:41] back to the promised land. I'm not done
[47:42] with you. I'll never fail you."
[47:44] Hallelujah. Even though you fail me,
[47:47] I'll never fail you. Praise God. Oh my.
[47:50] Glory to God.
[47:52] Hallelujah. God will never fail us,
[47:55] church.
[47:59] Hallelujah. All right. Now, now we can
[48:02] all see brother Brandham sin throughout
[48:03] his life, too.
[48:07] Let me just go through some highlights
[48:08] here. I've always wanted to do this. I
[48:11] hit a couple a couple weeks ago. I just
[48:12] hit a couple of events, but let me I
[48:14] made this yesterday, so bear with me
[48:16] here. This is my juvenile way to do the
[48:18] same thing I did for Abraham, right? But
[48:20] I want to just I want you to see the
[48:21] decades of Brother Ram's life as a
[48:23] Christian. Now, the red represents when
[48:26] he got saved and got the baptism of the
[48:28] Holy Ghost, right? the end of
[48:30] 32 and then the middle of June and 33 he
[48:33] started the church there after the
[48:34] revival when the when they did the 17
[48:37] water baptisms and the the voice said as
[48:40] I was with uh or as John the Baptist
[48:43] forer ran uh the first coming of Christ
[48:45] so your message will forrun the second
[48:47] coming of
[48:49] Christ and then he pastored from 33 all
[48:52] the way to 46 around May when brother
[48:54] man went out with he was given two signs
[48:56] like Moses the sign the hand and the
[48:59] sign of discernment. But remember, the
[49:01] first one didn't show up. I'm sorry, the
[49:02] second one, the first one showed up
[49:04] right away, that first poll. But the
[49:06] second poll didn't show up till about
[49:08] 1949. Let's look at that. You had to
[49:10] wait almost three years for God's
[49:13] promise to come to
[49:14] pass. You know what the Bible would say?
[49:16] The Bible would say, "Brother Ram never
[49:18] staggered at the promise of God. God
[49:20] told me it's going to happen. It's going
[49:22] to happen. I might have to wait three
[49:23] more years, brother Jose, but it's going
[49:25] to happen." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[49:28] if brother Abraham can wait, we can
[49:29] wait, too. Hallelujah. Because we have
[49:32] all this word to feed on. We have this
[49:34] wonderful meal to feed on all this time.
[49:37] Praise God. All these blessings. We have
[49:40] so much uh spiritual food, spiritual
[49:43] meat in due season.
[49:45] Hallelujah. That's right. We have so
[49:48] much fe food and meat to feast on while
[49:51] we're waiting for God's promise to come
[49:52] to pass.
[49:58] Now 32 he was saved. 32 he got the Holy
[50:01] Ghost. December of 32 he was ordained to
[50:03] preach by Roy Davis. Roy Davis seemed
[50:05] like he turned out to be an awful man.
[50:07] That doesn't mean he was always an awful
[50:08] man. We don't know. I wasn't there. They
[50:11] accused brother Brandham and all these
[50:12] nonsense
[50:13] lies. Falsely accuse him by a guilt
[50:16] association. That's a lie. Now 1933 he
[50:19] gives us seven major visions. Right? We
[50:21] get the seven major visions.
[50:23] That was in June of 1933. Now 1937, the
[50:27] trouble started,
[50:29] right? Brother Ram's mother-in-law said,
[50:31] "You cannot take my daughter amongst
[50:33] that bunch of trash." And brother
[50:34] Brother said, "From right then, my
[50:37] troubles
[50:38] started." Wasn't long. So he turned down
[50:41] the invitation to go to the Pentecostal
[50:43] people and let his mother-in-law call
[50:46] them trash. He didn't stand up for the
[50:48] people of God. So God let the flood
[50:50] come. He lost his wife and his baby
[50:52] Sharon Rose. That was 37. The first red
[50:56] dot. Now, you know what's going to
[50:58] happen to those dots, don't
[51:00] you? Anybody? Everybody paying attention
[51:03] to Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[51:08] right. 1946, he gets commissioned by an
[51:12] angel with two signs. He said, "A
[51:14] vibration over your hand was the first
[51:16] one. And the second one was
[51:18] discernment." Now in 1947, brother Ram
[51:20] was already out on his ministry and
[51:22] brother Ram said, "I was sitting in
[51:24] Balam's shoes for six months." Brother
[51:27] Ram said he was like Balam by praying
[51:30] for the hardest miracles
[51:33] first. So Balam asked for the permissive
[51:36] will of God. And brother Ram said, "I
[51:38] got in the permissive will of God by
[51:39] bringing up all the hardest miracles
[51:42] first." Brother Ram said, "I was walking
[51:44] in a false prophet's shoes." In other
[51:48] words, I was I was disobedient. See,
[51:50] church, a son of God can walk a lot of
[51:52] miles out of the perfect will of God.
[51:54] For six months, he was out of the
[51:56] perfect will of God. And the church
[51:59] said, see, we've seen we've seen
[52:01] brethren amongst us. For six months,
[52:03] they're out of the perfect will of God.
[52:04] Maybe longer. Just wait on the Lord.
[52:07] He'll renew their strength. If they're a
[52:09] child of God, they'll repent eventually.
[52:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:13] Six months, he said, "I'm in." Balam was
[52:15] a false prophet. And he said, 'I was
[52:17] acting like a false prophet for six
[52:19] months because I was disobedient to the
[52:21] first. The commission was just pray for
[52:23] the sick. The commission wasn't bring
[52:25] the hardest ones first. That's something
[52:28] he added to the
[52:29] promise. And I'm quoting brother Random.
[52:32] I can give you the exact quotes if you
[52:33] want them. I got them right in front of
[52:34] me. But in 1949, the second poll
[52:37] manifested in Regina,
[52:39] Saskatchewan. The angel said, "You'll
[52:42] tell people the very secrets of their
[52:43] hearts." In 1945, the second poll
[52:47] starts. Hallelujah. God keeps his word.
[52:50] Hallelujah. Amen. That's right. In 1950
[52:54] though, I forgot to put it. The pillar
[52:55] of fire picture was taken in January of
[52:57] 1950. Uh I've thought about many times
[53:00] putting it back up here. I may do that
[53:01] by God's grace. We got it in my office
[53:03] there. And then did you know in
[53:06] 1951 500 ministers gathered uh at a
[53:10] convention? It's in the history books.
[53:12] And they all gathered there to honor
[53:14] brother Brandham. It was like a banquet
[53:15] just to honor brother Bham because they
[53:17] saw his his two gifts and they started
[53:19] their ministries and God started doing
[53:21] supernatural works. What I find
[53:24] interesting is brother Ram doesn't talk
[53:25] about that. You know why? Because
[53:27] brother Ram wasn't a prideful person. He
[53:29] didn't say like ah 500 people 500
[53:31] preachers wanted to congratulate me and
[53:33] let me tell you how great it was. He
[53:34] don't even talk about it but history
[53:36] records it.
[53:38] They threw him a banquet in his honor
[53:41] just for just because he obeyed the
[53:43] voice of the Lord. Church, what is
[53:46] heaven going to be like? If he got that
[53:49] on this side, no wonder brother said the
[53:51] millions were running to him when he
[53:52] went behind the curtain of time saying,
[53:54] "Our precious brother, our precious
[53:55] brother, you took God at his word. You
[53:58] believe God's word. I was saved. Not
[53:59] only was I saved, I was healed. Not only
[54:01] was I healed, I was filled with the Holy
[54:03] Ghost because you were obedient to the
[54:05] Lord." Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And I can
[54:07] say today I'm preaching by the Holy
[54:09] Ghost because brother Brand was obedient
[54:11] to the plan of God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:15] That's why I'm here. I wasn't preaching
[54:16] in denomination. I wasn't I was raised
[54:18] in denomination. That didn't give me
[54:19] overcoming grace. It was thus say the
[54:21] Lord, the word of God for this hour. It
[54:24] was the end time message that put me in
[54:26] the ministry. It's the word of God and I
[54:28] receive it. It's scripture fulfilled in
[54:31] this day. Hallelujah.
[54:33] Hallelujah.
[54:35] also at the end of 1951 he went to South
[54:38] Africa and he took the wrong
[54:42] itinerary a third red
[54:46] dot and the angel said go on with them
[54:49] but you're going to pay for it if you go
[54:51] with them you'll get amiebas and he had
[54:53] he said he had him for months and months
[54:54] and months until Jesus visited him and
[54:56] healed
[54:57] him got him back on the
[55:00] ministry hallelujah in 1954 he had that
[55:04] bomb Bombay trip to India. They
[55:06] estimated nearly half a million would
[55:07] have been at this meeting there in
[55:09] Bombay. So that was the fulfillment of
[55:11] the vision of 300,000
[55:14] 1954. But also did you know this in 54
[55:17] after he got back from the India trip he
[55:19] developed a critical spirit because he
[55:20] saw preachers a woman preacher over
[55:22] there pulling the money from these poor
[55:25] Indians. And brother Barham said I
[55:27] developed a critical spirit and it
[55:29] haunts at me. So he goes there and sees
[55:32] uh the mayor said half a million people
[55:34] were there but he sees some things. He
[55:36] comes back and he starts criticizing
[55:37] them and all he can do is say bad. All
[55:39] he can say is this preachers this woman
[55:41] preacher she's a bad preacher and he
[55:44] said this evil spirit haunts me. Church
[55:47] we got to be very careful what uh what
[55:49] complexes we develop in our lives. Even
[55:52] look coming off great meetings. That was
[55:54] where in 54 in Bombay that's where God
[55:57] opened the eyes of the blind man. He
[55:59] said, "If if any of you Muslims can come
[56:01] up here, if any of you Jane seeks, if
[56:03] any of you can come up here and give him
[56:04] his sight, then I I'll follow you." And
[56:07] brother Ram said, "I wouldn't have said
[56:08] that unless God would have showed me
[56:09] that God was going to open his eyes."
[56:12] Amen. Hallelujah. And then God gave his
[56:15] sight back. Hallelujah. Half a million
[56:18] people might have showed up. 300,000 at
[56:20] least showed up to the meeting. That's
[56:23] right. But he got back. He developed a
[56:25] critical spirit. He said, "You pray for
[56:26] me. I've developed a critical spirit.
[56:29] I'm speaking evil about
[56:31] people. Church, be careful what you say
[56:33] about each other.
[56:36] There's time you have to There's times,
[56:37] yes, you have to call black, black,
[56:39] white, white, right, right, wrong,
[56:40] wrong. There's times you got to call it,
[56:42] but don't don't make it a bad
[56:44] habit. Hallelujah. Be very careful.
[56:47] You'll develop a critical spirit and it
[56:49] will haunt
[56:50] you. In 1956, he has the vision of the
[56:53] third pole right there in January. He
[56:55] tells it uh in January of
[56:58] 56. Now, I didn't put this one in here,
[57:00] but in 1957, look what he said in 57,
[57:02] church, a lot of times I don't feel that
[57:05] way that I'm
[57:07] saved. Brother Chris, he's seen a blind
[57:09] man receive his sight. But he says one,
[57:11] two, three years later, a lot of times I
[57:13] don't even feel saved because I'm
[57:14] fighting battles in the
[57:16] flesh. See, you're still going to No,
[57:18] no, no, no matter what how many miracles
[57:20] you see, you're still going to have to
[57:21] come back to reality. we'd say reality
[57:24] coming back to being a human and you're
[57:26] still going to have to fight battles,
[57:28] but we should enjoy the testimonies when
[57:30] they happen, right? We we should enjoy
[57:31] the victories, enjoy the supernatural,
[57:35] but remember, you're going to come back
[57:36] down to being a human, and you're going
[57:37] to have to overcome your your battles.
[57:40] You're have to
[57:43] fight. You might not always feel safe.
[57:45] You might not always feel like you have
[57:47] the Holy Ghost, but you got to keep
[57:49] fighting the devil. Hallelujah. Is that
[57:52] right, church? That's
[57:55] right. In 1958 59, he said there was a
[57:58] trap set for him. Thus said the Lord,
[58:00] that young people that those that young
[58:01] couple kissing and brother Bam said the
[58:03] right thing and didn't condemn them.
[58:05] Brother Bam could had power over their
[58:06] lives, but he had mercy on them. He
[58:08] passed the test. Also in 1958, the third
[58:11] poll manifested for the first time.
[58:13] Sunny Shimp, we were there, brother
[58:15] Jose. I got the pictures. We were there.
[58:16] They had it right up there on the wall.
[58:18] He was dying of, I think, cancer.
[58:20] Brother Ramb walked in there. Thus
[58:22] sayith the Lord, you'll sell me red hots
[58:24] again from across this
[58:25] counter. They got it right there. It was
[58:28] it was everybody knew it in
[58:30] Jeffersonville. It's right there. And
[58:32] then it it was fulfilled. He said, "Thus
[58:34] say the Lord, you'll not die, but you'll
[58:36] sell me again red hats over the
[58:38] counter." That's the third pole. In
[58:40] other words, that's the speaking to the
[58:41] mountain, the speaking the word.
[58:43] Hallelujah. Letting Jesus, in other
[58:44] words, speak through your lips. Praise
[58:46] God. That was the third pole of Brother
[58:48] Ram's ministry. speak to the mountain.
[58:51] It has to move.
[58:53] Hallelujah. Oh my. And then in 1959,
[58:56] November, Brother spoke to squirrels
[58:58] into existence. That same month, right
[59:00] after the SP squirrels were spoken, that
[59:02] was the that was the second operation of
[59:03] the third pole. Had he right was the
[59:05] third operation of the third
[59:08] pole. She said, "That's nothing but the
[59:10] truth, Brother Bram." And he said that
[59:12] super he said that super anointing
[59:14] dropped down and said, "Whatever you
[59:16] ask, I'll give it to you." Hallelujah.
[59:18] and her boys got saved. Her boy wrote
[59:20] that testimony, that generations book
[59:22] Jose got me. What a gift that was,
[59:23] brother. That was one of the greatest
[59:24] gifts you've ever given me, buddy. I
[59:26] That's a beautiful book right there.
[59:28] Hallelujah. So now the third the TP is
[59:30] third pole. Third pole. Third pole.
[59:32] Third pole. It starts operating here
[59:34] with the third pole. But in 1959, he
[59:37] also lied to the IRS. So there's the IRS
[59:42] lie, right?
[59:44] Then in 1960 he had sinus infection for
[59:47] nine days with a temperature over 100
[59:49] for nine days. He missed the
[59:53] meetings and he said this. He said
[59:55] sometimes I wonder if he even called me
[59:57] and me said ain't you ashamed of
[1:00:01] yourself. That's a good thing we should
[1:00:03] probably memorize. Ain't you ashamed of
[1:00:05] yourself when we start talking negative?
[1:00:07] Ain't you ashamed of yourself, brother
[1:00:08] Jesse?
[1:00:10] Oh, why is the church struggling? Or why
[1:00:12] is it so quiet? Or why am I struggling
[1:00:14] financially? Why am I struggling
[1:00:16] spiritually? Ain't you ashamed to say
[1:00:17] that, Brother
[1:00:18] Jesse? You got my permission to say
[1:00:20] that. Okay, but if you say it to me, I'm
[1:00:23] gonna say it to
[1:00:25] you. What's good for the goose is good
[1:00:27] for the
[1:00:29] gator. And brother said, it kind of
[1:00:31] rebuked me a little bit. He said, how
[1:00:33] many of you brothers thankful for a
[1:00:34] godly
[1:00:36] wife? Amen. Well, I figured be quiet on
[1:00:38] that one.
[1:00:41] But that's another red dot. He even
[1:00:43] questions, "Am I even called to preach?"
[1:00:46] And Jesus shows up to him that very
[1:00:48] morning and uh showed him uh the third
[1:00:51] pole of his ministry. Yes, that's right.
[1:00:53] Showed him a Bible and then the promised
[1:00:55] land like
[1:00:56] Joshua. That's
[1:00:58] right. And then in uh 1960 also he said
[1:01:02] in the message as it was with Moses,
[1:01:04] remember this. He said, "I focused too
[1:01:06] much on the discernment." He said, "I
[1:01:08] let tens of thousands times thousands
[1:01:11] I've failed to pray for." Now, church,
[1:01:14] this ought to make somebody happy today.
[1:01:16] He admits, "I've made tens of thousands
[1:01:19] of
[1:01:20] mistakes." But he didn't he didn't he
[1:01:22] didn't have a pity party over it. He
[1:01:24] said, "That's fine." He said, "I'm still
[1:01:25] pressing on. I'm going forward to the
[1:01:27] promised land today."
[1:01:30] Tens of thousands of mistakes. In other
[1:01:32] words, tens of thousands. He spent too
[1:01:33] much time in the prayer line. He says
[1:01:35] because the people wanted the
[1:01:36] discernment but he was called to pray
[1:01:38] for the sick and remember then he went
[1:01:39] run out of strength and he couldn't pray
[1:01:41] for all the people. I've let tens of
[1:01:43] thousands go unprayed for and he says
[1:01:46] forgive me Lord I pointed too much to
[1:01:48] the sign signpost and not the
[1:01:51] commission. The commission is pray for
[1:01:53] the sick.
[1:01:59] Hallelujah. In 1960 though we have great
[1:02:01] victories. He preached to seven church
[1:02:03] ages. In 1962, he stored up food. He
[1:02:06] stayed in the USA most of 1962 and
[1:02:09] preached to us the stature of a perfect
[1:02:11] man. Hallelujah. Sers, is this the end
[1:02:13] time? Hallelujah. All those beautiful
[1:02:15] messages there from that time on. All
[1:02:18] these glorious messages in 1962 by
[1:02:20] vision. He said, "Store up food." It was
[1:02:22] the prettiest food. Storeing plenty of
[1:02:24] it. And that's the food we're feasting
[1:02:26] on today. Did you know that, church?
[1:02:28] This is the food brother left us right
[1:02:30] here. This was preached in 1962,
[1:02:33] November of ' 62. This was the food that
[1:02:35] you're enjoying. Oh, you ought to thank
[1:02:37] God that you got food to chew on like
[1:02:39] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:02:41] patience and temperance. God is
[1:02:42] brotherly kindness and charity. That's
[1:02:44] your food. God left us that to enjoy.
[1:02:46] Hallelujah.
[1:02:50] Usually I get more quiet and you guys
[1:02:52] get or I get more louder, you get more
[1:02:53] quiet, right? That's how it is. I just
[1:02:55] finally feel like like preaching now.
[1:02:57] Glory. And then everybody's else is
[1:02:58] getting tired. So forgive me. I'll try
[1:03:00] to finish up here. I didn't know how
[1:03:02] long this would take. In March of 63,
[1:03:05] he's visited by seven angels and
[1:03:06] preaches the seven seals. But in June,
[1:03:08] he says, "I've lost the feeling for the
[1:03:10] pre people. I built a complex to myself.
[1:03:13] I let the sick people lay." He felt like
[1:03:15] quitting and moving up in the Colorado
[1:03:17] mountains. But the angel said, "Your
[1:03:19] wife will leave you if you do that." He
[1:03:22] developed a complex. That's that red
[1:03:24] mark. And then in that the next month,
[1:03:26] the next month when he was when he said,
[1:03:28] "God, you owe me an understanding when
[1:03:30] that young mother died." And God said,
[1:03:32] "He let him pout it out for a few days.
[1:03:34] I ain't going to talk to you. You're not
[1:03:35] going to feel my spirit for a few days
[1:03:37] because you said I owe you something."
[1:03:38] He said, "I owe you nothing." God owes
[1:03:41] us nothing.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. The Ram said he was left
[1:03:45] alone, sitting alone by God. But at the
[1:03:48] end of 1963, he was hunting in October
[1:03:50] and the snowstorm came in and the Lord
[1:03:52] said, "Just speak to the storm and it'll
[1:03:54] cease." And all those brothers witnessed
[1:03:56] the storm was coming in and the storm
[1:03:58] left. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:04:01] That was the four the that was the
[1:04:03] fourth operation of the third pole. And
[1:04:06] then Ma's miracle was the fifth and
[1:04:08] final operation. She had that tumor on
[1:04:10] her right side. Sister Betty Collins was
[1:04:12] there in the office with her. I preached
[1:04:15] on Betty Collins one time. beautiful
[1:04:17] testimony. I don't know if she's still
[1:04:18] alive today, but Betty Collins saw
[1:04:21] sister Ma on the table with a
[1:04:23] tumor and as the doctor reached out,
[1:04:26] brother Ram said or sister uh the sister
[1:04:29] said uh she lost track of it and when he
[1:04:31] went to touch the tumor, it had vanished
[1:04:33] within just a split
[1:04:35] second. It's because brother Ram was
[1:04:37] told whatever you speak that's what will
[1:04:40] happen. And Jesus said if you say to the
[1:04:43] mountain it will move. Hallelujah.
[1:04:46] I almost lost it that time. Oh my.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] Whatever you say, that's the way it'll
[1:04:53] be. That's the fifth time the third pole
[1:04:55] operated. Five is grace.
[1:04:58] I need to count how many times we've
[1:05:00] spoken to things. I know Jose did it
[1:05:02] with with his uh family there by God's
[1:05:06] grace. And then in February 1965, we got
[1:05:09] thus sayith the Lord on marriage and
[1:05:11] divorce. Hallelujah. Brother Anne was
[1:05:13] healed in November of 65 of that stomach
[1:05:16] condition that came every seven years.
[1:05:18] So 1 2 3 4 5 6 must have erupted there.
[1:05:21] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 must erupted there. Every
[1:05:24] seven years a stomach issue came back on
[1:05:26] him and he got healed right there at the
[1:05:27] end of his life in the sermon invisible
[1:05:31] union.
[1:05:34] Hallelujah. Ah I I I don't I can't get
[1:05:37] to that. All right. All right. What
[1:05:38] happened to all the
[1:05:41] dots? What What would the Bible say?
[1:05:43] What would What would Jesus say about
[1:05:45] brother
[1:05:46] Brandham? He staggered not. He was
[1:05:48] pardoned for all his sins.
[1:05:52] Hallelujah. If God did that for Abraham,
[1:05:55] God has to do that for each one of us.
[1:05:59] Hallelujah. Now, each one of us, you can
[1:06:02] divide up all your sins. Boy, I had a
[1:06:04] rough couple years there in a
[1:06:06] row. Now, this is probably generous. The
[1:06:09] church say
[1:06:12] I thought about brother Jose. If I had
[1:06:14] more time, I'd just red dots all
[1:06:17] across. Not really. I'm because we're
[1:06:19] talking about major sins, right? But
[1:06:21] just the idea of it, we have all
[1:06:23] these failures it seems
[1:06:26] like. But if God was faithful to
[1:06:28] Abraham, if we can see God using brother
[1:06:31] Brandham, then what's God going to do
[1:06:32] for us? God's going to say the same
[1:06:34] thing. You and I stagger not at the
[1:06:37] promise of God. We are pardoned of our
[1:06:39] sins.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. The Bible says in the body
[1:06:43] of his flesh, I think I showed this to
[1:06:44] Claude or Patrick a couple weeks ago. In
[1:06:47] the body of his flesh through death to
[1:06:48] present you, how did Jesus present you
[1:06:50] holy and unblameable, free from
[1:06:53] faultiness. So, you're presented like
[1:06:55] that before
[1:06:57] Jesus. All those decades of service,
[1:06:59] I've been only church. I've only been
[1:07:01] pastoring these two right here. This is
[1:07:02] I've only been pastoring and I hope I've
[1:07:04] just got a few red dots in I hope by
[1:07:06] God's
[1:07:07] grace.
[1:07:09] Hallelujah. But Abraham had all this
[1:07:12] lifetime and God was able to wipe it off
[1:07:15] and say he never staggered. He never
[1:07:17] departed but he was strong in faith. He
[1:07:20] kept giving God glory. Hallelujah.
[1:07:22] That's what we need to do. Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Give God the glory.
[1:07:28] God. Jesus makes us free from fault and
[1:07:31] unreprovable, which means no accusers.
[1:07:34] Satan won't be there, brother Chris, to
[1:07:35] accuse us. He won't be there.
[1:07:39] Hallelujah. That's right. He's not going
[1:07:41] to be there. There'll be no demons
[1:07:43] there. Glory. They're already cast in
[1:07:46] the lake of fire. There'll be no
[1:07:48] accusers. Jesus made you holy. Jesus
[1:07:51] made you free from faultiness. Jesus uh
[1:07:54] takes away your accusers. And that's in
[1:07:56] his sight. You're clean and forgiven in
[1:07:59] his sight.
[1:08:03] And church, what has he done? He's
[1:08:05] forgiven you all your
[1:08:07] trespasses. Let me go back to that
[1:08:09] quote. Let's stand. I'm going to finish
[1:08:11] with that quote. I didn't get to it.
[1:08:13] Maybe I'll do it on Wednesday.
[1:08:15] Musician's going to come. Brother tells
[1:08:18] a story in Toledo, Ohio. It's a
[1:08:19] beautiful
[1:08:22] story. In his heart, Brother Ram starts
[1:08:24] condemning this woman who's got purple
[1:08:26] hair. I was just like your mom, brother
[1:08:28] Hus. My goodness. And she's in Toledo,
[1:08:31] Ohio. That's near my
[1:08:33] hometown. Brother Bam walks in this
[1:08:35] dunkered restaurant and he sees this old
[1:08:38] woman and she's got sexy clothes on. And
[1:08:40] brother said, "I can see the flab on her
[1:08:42] arm. She's all wrinkly and old, smoking
[1:08:44] a cigarette, drinking alcohol with a
[1:08:46] police officer. There's people gambling
[1:08:48] in this restaurant." And brother sits
[1:08:50] down and he says these words. He said,
[1:08:52] 'Oh God, how could you let my children
[1:08:54] live among such a dirty stuff as
[1:08:58] this? Now, you don't have to say amen.
[1:09:00] Don't say amen. But I wonder if you've
[1:09:02] ever thought
[1:09:03] that. I think about it when I go through
[1:09:05] Target. I'm like, why do we have to have
[1:09:06] this pride stuff in here now? Thank God
[1:09:08] they finally moved it to the
[1:09:10] back. Would you ever thought that, God,
[1:09:13] why do we have all this awful stuff
[1:09:15] here? Why do why? And people even I was
[1:09:18] emailing people this week overseas.
[1:09:19] They're like, "We're not going to have
[1:09:20] children because of all the awful
[1:09:21] stuff." I said, "That that's a that's
[1:09:23] nonsense. If God sends them, you receive
[1:09:26] them. You got the Holy Ghost. What do
[1:09:28] you got to be afraid
[1:09:30] of?" This woman said, "Should I have a
[1:09:32] child? I don't know if I should have a
[1:09:33] child. The rapture is so near." I said,
[1:09:34] "My wife's nine months pregnant." She
[1:09:36] said, "Glory to God. I'm going to have a
[1:09:37] child
[1:09:39] then." See, we we walk by faith. If God
[1:09:43] sends a child, he's going to take care
[1:09:45] of a child. It's his heritage. It's his
[1:09:48] uh it's his bow. I'm sorry. It's his
[1:09:51] arrow in the bow of the parents.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah.
[1:09:55] Brother Ram said he was going to the
[1:09:56] bathroom. Took a little break and the
[1:09:58] Holy Ghost convicted
[1:10:00] him and said, "Why are you condemning
[1:10:03] this woman with the purple
[1:10:07] hair?" And the the voice said, "Uh the
[1:10:10] voice said, "Let me show you what your
[1:10:12] sin is like." Brother Ram said, "There
[1:10:13] was the world and Jesus was up here in
[1:10:15] heaven." And brother Ram said his sins
[1:10:18] were going up from earth to Jesus. But
[1:10:21] all of a sudden he saw this red uh this
[1:10:24] red bloodline, this this red kind of
[1:10:27] capsule around the earth. And every time
[1:10:29] brother's sins went up, it got
[1:10:31] extinguished into that red blood. So
[1:10:34] brother's sins didn't make it to Jesus.
[1:10:37] Amen. And the church said,
[1:10:41] "Hallelujah." And then this is what the
[1:10:44] Lord told him. And then I seen I crawled
[1:10:46] up to him and I see my old book laying
[1:10:48] there like a sinner book. In other
[1:10:50] words, there's in heaven there's a list
[1:10:51] of all the deeds you do. The Bible says
[1:10:53] all the deeds good or bad. There's a
[1:10:55] book about you. And brother crawls up to
[1:10:59] Jesus. He said, "I I seen my sins what I
[1:11:02] was doing." I said, "Lord, will you
[1:11:04] forgive me?" He took his hand, got some
[1:11:06] blood out, and wrote across the top of
[1:11:08] it, "Pardon." That's why I put pardon on
[1:11:10] those slides. It notice it wiped across.
[1:11:14] That's what Jesus did to brother Ram. He
[1:11:16] took his own blood, put it in his side
[1:11:17] that he was pierced. He wiped it across
[1:11:19] and said, "I pardon this." And then he
[1:11:21] throwed it in back in the sea of
[1:11:23] forgetfulness. Imagine God's throw. Our
[1:11:25] throw. Mine. Mine might go 15 feet.
[1:11:27] Jesus throws your
[1:11:29] book. Off into the sea. And he said,
[1:11:33] "Remember it no more. It was gone
[1:11:35] forever." And the church said, "All your
[1:11:38] sins, all your book of all the records
[1:11:41] of all your sins." Jesus wrote, "Pardon.
[1:11:43] I forgive it. I'm sending it away.
[1:11:45] You'll never find
[1:11:49] it. And he said, I forgive you, but
[1:11:52] you're condemning
[1:11:54] her. That changed my idea. I said, Lord
[1:11:57] have mercy. Brother Bam went back to her
[1:11:59] seat and said, I'm sorry. I'm just
[1:12:01] paraphrasing. I'm con I was condemning
[1:12:03] you and then God showed me how sinful I
[1:12:06] am. Brother said, where did this start
[1:12:08] happening? She said, I used to be a
[1:12:09] Sunday school teacher. I got invol
[1:12:11] involved with the wrong man. And brother
[1:12:13] Bam, to make a long story short, said,
[1:12:15] "Are you ready to repent?" And he said,
[1:12:17] "They got right down there in the Toledo
[1:12:19] restaurant." And he said, "We had a
[1:12:21] prayer meeting right there and she
[1:12:23] repented and gave her life to God. Took
[1:12:25] away all the stuff. She became a real
[1:12:27] believer by the grace of God." Amen.
[1:12:29] When we stopped condemning people.
[1:12:31] Hallelujah. And remember, what did it
[1:12:33] take to forgive us? It took the blood of
[1:12:35] Jesus Christ to forgive us. Amen.
[1:12:38] Hallelujah.
[1:12:39] How many love Jesus today?
[1:12:44] That's what our book is going to say.
[1:12:45] Church is going to say pardoned. And
[1:12:47] then God, God's word is going to say,
[1:12:49] God's decree over our lives is going to
[1:12:50] say she never staggered at the promise
[1:12:52] of God. She was strong in faith, giving
[1:12:55] God
[1:12:56] glory. Let's pray. And if you have sins,
[1:12:58] repent of them. Let's repent of them.
[1:13:00] And after that, let's give God glory
[1:13:02] because that's what believers
[1:13:03] do. They give God glory. They don't
[1:13:06] stagger at the promise of God. Heavenly
[1:13:09] Father, we thank you for today, Lord
[1:13:10] God. Thank you for the people receiving
[1:13:12] your word, Lord. I've been a little long
[1:13:13] and windy, but that's kind of normal.
[1:13:15] But Lord, I trust your people, Lord
[1:13:17] Jesus, receive your word. Thank you,
[1:13:20] Lord, for that message on Wednesday.
[1:13:21] What an encouragement that was, Lord.
[1:13:23] And I trust this would build on top of
[1:13:24] that, that the people's faith would be
[1:13:26] built,
[1:13:29] Lord. We desire to see one another
[1:13:31] overcome. Hallelujah. And we know you're
[1:13:34] looking at what we're trying to do. I'm
[1:13:36] trying, Lord, to preach your word. And
[1:13:37] Lord, each one of us are trying to
[1:13:39] receive it and do our best to glorify
[1:13:41] your holy
[1:13:45] name. Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:13:47] today, Lord. May each person confess any
[1:13:49] sin, Lord God. And may we be more
[1:13:51] determined to walk towards salvation, to
[1:13:54] walk towards the rapture, Lord Jesus,
[1:13:57] like Abraham walked. Help us to walk in
[1:14:00] the steps of faithful Abraham. And Lord,
[1:14:02] then it'll be surely said that we
[1:14:04] staggered not at the promise of God, but
[1:14:07] were strong in faith, giving God
[1:14:09] glory. We thank you for today, Lord God.
[1:14:13] We ask these blessings, Lord, in the
[1:14:14] name of Jesus Christ. And we ask that
[1:14:16] each person will be right with you.
