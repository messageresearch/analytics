[1:00] hopefully these are the uh these are
[1:02] really uh wonderful thoughts to you if
[1:03] you didn't hear wednesday's sermon i
[1:04] encourage you to listen to that one we
[1:06] kind of started this thought
[1:08] about now showing how all the distinct
[1:10] boundaries were in type of the distinct
[1:13] new testament ministries
[1:15] that we all have
[1:17] and i ended with the apostle paul i'm
[1:18] going to pick up with the apostle paul
[1:20] and then hopefully we'll get to the
[1:21] sister's role as well because that's not
[1:24] cut and dry like some people think
[1:26] praise god
[1:28] so let's uh
[1:29] let's read our scripture here
[1:33] let me just check real quick if there's
[1:35] any uh
[1:38] anything i need to do so yeah joshua 16
[1:40] here
[1:42] verses one to four let me read one to
[1:44] four please and then uh we'll read verse
[1:45] 10 together
[1:47] and the lot
[1:48] of the children of joseph fell from
[1:50] jordan by jericho unto the water of
[1:53] jericho on the east to the wilderness
[1:55] that goeth up from jericho throughout
[1:57] mount bethel
[1:58] and goeth out from bethel to luz and
[2:00] passeth along unto the borders
[2:03] of archai to aderoth
[2:06] and go down westward to the coast of
[2:08] jeff la tai unto the coast of beth horon
[2:11] the nether and to gezer
[2:14] and the goings out thereof are at the
[2:16] sea so the children of joseph manassen
[2:19] ephraim took their inheritance look at
[2:21] that what is that beautiful they waited
[2:23] all those years but then they finally
[2:25] possessed it amen praise god they could
[2:28] say this day moses scripture is
[2:30] fulfilled
[2:32] praise god there was a day they took it
[2:34] praise god and that's what we rejoice in
[2:36] days special days where we inherit the
[2:38] promises of god amen whether it's you
[2:40] know i'm talking about after the baptism
[2:42] the holy ghost
[2:43] you get the baptism holy ghost and then
[2:45] you start pressing in and gaining
[2:46] victories that you never would have got
[2:48] in sanctification amen these are only
[2:50] victories you could get after you're in
[2:52] the promised land
[2:53] amen let's read verse 10. now here we
[2:55] looked at this on wednesday but notice
[2:57] they didn't drive out everyone and that
[3:00] was a type of us we can't drive out the
[3:02] sin nature in our in our bodies
[3:05] we can't drive it out but we can keep it
[3:07] under subjection
[3:09] hallelujah verse 10 let's read verse 10
[3:11] ready one two three and they drave not
[3:14] out the canaanites that dwell in gezer
[3:17] but the canaanites dwell among the
[3:19] ephraimites unto this day and serve
[3:23] under tribute praise god let's go to uh
[3:26] philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. this was
[3:28] the scripture
[3:29] stephen chose he actually chose uh
[3:32] philippians 4 and that was the one
[3:33] sister naomi had chosen two years ago
[3:35] and he said if you've already done that
[3:36] one he said use this one instead
[3:39] so i said okay we'll do the new one
[3:41] instead by god's grace philippians 2
[3:43] verses 2 and 3 just a beautiful again
[3:45] portion great reminder of how we ought
[3:47] to live
[3:48] a nice little summary of christianity
[3:53] how many enjoy uh the how many enjoy the
[3:55] joy amongst believers
[3:57] praise god that's what we should have as
[3:59] believers joy
[4:00] peace with one another if we have ought
[4:02] against anyone the bible said go to them
[4:04] personally right and then usually that
[4:05] takes care of it
[4:07] right if they're a real sensitive holy
[4:09] spirit christian if not they might fight
[4:10] against it and then that proves they're
[4:12] probably not part of us
[4:14] right because then jesus said after the
[4:15] third time kick him out of the church
[4:17] but usually he doesn't get to that
[4:18] usually the people leave by then
[4:20] right usually doesn't get to that we
[4:21] have to put him out from under the blood
[4:23] but we're thankful that god has a way to
[4:25] keep peace in the body of christ and i'm
[4:26] grateful for this peaceful season we've
[4:28] had here praise god
[4:30] thank the lord amen
[4:32] hallelujah
[4:34] so i'm very thankful church we've you
[4:35] know fought
[4:36] for many years you know with different
[4:38] things uh
[4:39] my wife and i could tell you you know if
[4:41] you want to sit down and
[4:42] hear some of the stories we try not to
[4:44] use names but we fought for many years
[4:46] just against different ones and
[4:48] uh we're so thankful for the peace of
[4:50] god in the in the church praise god and
[4:52] we ought to rejoice in that philippians
[4:54] 2 verses 2 and 3 such beautiful
[4:56] scripture let's read this together one
[4:58] two three fulfill ye my joy that ye may
[5:02] be like-minded having the same love
[5:05] being of one accord of one mind let
[5:08] nothing be done through strife or vain
[5:11] glory but in lowliness of mind let each
[5:15] esteem other better than themselves i'm
[5:18] gonna have a need this morning they like

[8:16] you're you're all important praise god
[8:18] everybody everybody plays a part praise
[8:19] god we need each other the body edifies
[8:22] itself in love amen so let's look to the
[8:24] lord here i'll try to preach about an
[8:25] hour we'll see how that goes and trust
[8:27] the lord will minister to us
[8:29] by the grace of the lord so
[8:31] wednesday we looked at the beginning of
[8:33] chapter 15 and 16 and we saw how this
[8:36] types
[8:37] a holy ghost-filled saint
[8:39] okay so we read our text and
[8:42] the outline for chapter 16 i showed this
[8:44] on wednesday verses one to four is the
[8:47] boundaries for ephraim and manasseh okay
[8:50] and they were the sons of joseph
[8:53] all right and then verses five to nine
[8:55] is the specific borders of the
[8:57] ephraimites
[8:59] um and then verse 10 you have the
[9:01] canaanites
[9:02] dwelling among them under tribute very
[9:04] short chapters just 10 verses now i
[9:07] think it's just beautiful it's it's
[9:08] interesting church did you i don't know
[9:09] if you caught this
[9:11] but we saw chapter 14 the first tribe
[9:14] that gets the land is judah
[9:17] caleb was of the tribe of judah
[9:19] the second tribe that got land was
[9:21] ephraim
[9:23] and joshua was out of ephraim
[9:26] so the two men the only two men that
[9:29] made it over from the original
[9:30] generation their tribes were the first
[9:32] ones to get the
[9:35] hallelujah land
[9:35] like that because god rewards the first
[9:38] amen
[9:39] hallelujah god rewards those who stay
[9:41] faithful all those years
[9:43] we're going to read it right down here
[9:44] through the the scripture
[9:46] so think about that you know god's going
[9:47] to reward those old saints that have
[9:50] stayed faithful decade after decade
[9:52] although the deck uh the generations die
[9:54] and fall away these older ones keep
[9:56] pressing on they keep believing they're
[9:59] faithful they stay just as strong as
[10:01] they were when they were younger amen
[10:03] and they keep pressing on and god lets
[10:05] them see
[10:06] uh their faith becomes sight amen
[10:08] hallelujah praise god all these things
[10:11] they heard about for 38 40 years right
[10:14] all these things they've heard about
[10:15] long for they're the first ones that got
[10:17] the taste of the good of the land amen
[10:20] actually living in the land not just
[10:22] tasting and coming back as a spy joshua
[10:24] and caleb had done that but these get
[10:27] the taste and live in it permanently
[10:29] praise god that's gonna be my question
[10:31] at the end where are you living that's
[10:34] my question at the end
[10:35] amen
[10:37] because you're either living in egypt
[10:38] right
[10:39] thank you buddy
[10:41] you're still living in sin never really
[10:42] made a surrender thank you man okay
[10:46] never really uh come through true
[10:48] genuine repentance in water baptism
[10:50] people might have been baptized but if
[10:51] you didn't really come well thoroughly
[10:54] and all your taskmasters didn't die in
[10:56] the waters then you didn't come and you
[10:58] didn't fully repent praise god
[11:00] amen but the task masters have to drown
[11:04] and then you have the miriam spell
[11:06] dancing and praising the lord and uh and
[11:08] you know you started a new life amen
[11:11] your former task masters are dead and
[11:14] now you're following the pillar of fire
[11:16] you're following the prophet's message
[11:18] out into sanctification out into the
[11:21] trials and tests of your faith amen
[11:24] but remember church every day they had
[11:26] manna from heaven every day was
[11:28] everything was easy right it was an easy
[11:29] word it's easy it's easy it's an easy
[11:32] life their baby brother adam said your
[11:34] baby during sanctification
[11:37] because he's testing you he's training
[11:38] you he said but the fight really comes
[11:41] when you possess the promise of god you
[11:43] cast out all the fear and you go into
[11:45] the baptism of the holy ghost you cross
[11:48] over jordan and you say give me my
[11:50] mountain amen
[11:52] give me my possessions i'm not afraid
[11:54] what other christians are afraid of i
[11:56] can possess it because i'm a soldier i'm
[11:59] part of the army of god
[12:01] amen
[12:03] like we went to two churches maybe one
[12:05] insane vacation maybe one still at
[12:07] the red sea
[12:08] brother
[12:10] right but the one insane vacation was
[12:12] saying they're they're having trouble
[12:13] they focusing on church or the browns
[12:16] game
[12:17] come on church that that sanctification
[12:20] stuff
[12:21] if your mind is looking at the ohio
[12:23] state game or the alabama game or or
[12:27] florida game or if your mind's on the
[12:29] browns and things like that i have a
[12:31] great suspicion you're probably not the
[12:34] promised land amen because you're still
[12:36] dealing with the things of egypt but
[12:38] when you forsake those you left all
[12:40] those behind i don't know about you but
[12:42] that was one of my task masters amen
[12:44] hallelujah my football taskmaster that
[12:46] was buried in the waters or the blood of
[12:49] jesus christ amen
[12:51] not in bondage to that praise god we
[12:53] don't worship that think about that
[12:55] brother i think about this i just
[12:56] offered him that book instead of
[12:58] watching the game he could go read the
[12:59] book if he would have took it
[13:02] that'd be a better use of three hours
[13:03] wouldn't it church
[13:04] to read the bible and pray and listen to
[13:06] the word of god it'd be a lot better
[13:08] thing but see they're still out there
[13:10] and in sanctification and they say nice
[13:12] things they got some little victories in
[13:14] their life thank god for that they're
[13:15] looking for the coming of the lord but
[13:17] we have more than that praise god we
[13:19] have the possessions of the lord
[13:22] we have the portion the inheritance of
[13:25] the lord amen
[13:27] now church there are some promises we're
[13:28] still longing for but many promises we
[13:31] possess
[13:32] amen
[13:34] you possess real holiness amen
[13:37] you possess real joy real peace real
[13:40] long suffering these are things we're
[13:42] not hoping for we have amen
[13:48] god for that church the first one went
[13:50] to they were actually praying for the
[13:51] pope of rome they were praying to mary
[13:54] they're reciting creeds it was really
[13:56] something and i was just praying god
[13:58] give me the words come out of her my
[13:59] people
[14:01] right that's how we were just
[14:02] intercessory praying for them they spent
[14:05] 55 i timed it they spent 58
[14:08] uh with the incense and singing their
[14:10] songs and getting the uh the bread and
[14:13] wine ready to be changed in the body of
[14:14] jesus and the blood of jesus
[14:16] and they spent one minute going up there
[14:18] and people are so tired and they're like
[14:21] they go up there get there and come back
[14:23] and then they get a few announcements
[14:24] and they leave
[14:25] and then and then we're out in an hour
[14:27] and four minutes i timed it we got there
[14:29] nine and left at 1004. that's when the
[14:31] sermon ended and there's no joy there's
[14:34] no freedom of the laity praise god
[14:36] there's no move with the holy spirit
[14:38] praise god but see we get to enjoy the
[14:40] blessings of god see that proves we're
[14:43] out of egypt praise god
[14:45] we're out of idolatry and statue worship
[14:47] amen and mother worship amen we're out
[14:51] of that we're through the the wilderness
[14:53] and we're possessing real christianity
[14:56] amen
[14:57] we're fighting real battles amen
[14:59] overcoming every day with the power of
[15:01] god amen
[15:03] hallelujah
[15:04] it's so true
[15:06] you can clearly see
[15:07] that there's a difference between people
[15:09] who possess the promises and those who
[15:11] just talk about them
[15:13] remember that series i preached on the
[15:14] false prophets that's all they do they
[15:16] just promise you things but you never
[15:18] achieve them thank god we can promise
[15:21] and you can possess
[15:23] we can promise a word and you can walk
[15:26] into the blessing of it amen
[15:28] hallelujah praise god that's a great
[15:30] difference between our church and other
[15:32] churches and it's not because we're
[15:34] better it's because of god's grace
[15:37] now i preached on that recently how
[15:38] david was better than saul but it was by
[15:40] god's grace
[15:41] we're better by god's grace but not
[15:43] because of our own human efforts
[15:45] we just surrender to god and we just
[15:47] love god
[15:49] because he said he that loveth me is he
[15:51] that keepeth my commands amen hallelujah
[15:55] that's how you know the love of god when
[15:57] people long to believe god's commands
[15:59] and keep them that's a real lover of god
[16:02] amen so getting back here
[16:06] the ones who labored longest were
[16:08] rewarded first
[16:10] praise god
[16:12] they're rewarded first now this gives
[16:14] you an idea about the different uh
[16:16] divisions i'm going to zoom in i'm going
[16:17] to zoom in i know it's impossible to see
[16:19] that
[16:20] but just for an idea right now so we're
[16:22] at so judah we preached on judah chapter
[16:24] 14. later simeon's going to get a
[16:26] portion of judah because judah is too
[16:28] big for them they were actually given
[16:29] too much land the bible does say that
[16:31] okay but right now church we're on uh
[16:34] ephraim and west manasseh remember we
[16:36] already talked about the two and a half
[16:37] tribes on the east of the river jordan
[16:40] they chose not to possess the promised
[16:42] land
[16:43] they chose to live outside the land
[16:44] that's foolish virgin
[16:46] they purposely choose not to live in the
[16:48] promised land right
[16:50] they want a portion outside of the land
[16:53] which is okay that's fine they have
[16:54] their portion but they're going to miss
[16:55] out on the millennium
[16:56] all right they're going to miss out on
[16:57] that
[16:58] but here in chapter 16 now we have uh
[17:01] ephraim and manasseh possessing their
[17:04] land
[17:06] and so uh you'll see as we get to this
[17:08] here uh that that uh it'll make a lot
[17:10] more sense now here i'm zoomed in
[17:13] here you can see the southern this is
[17:14] the southern territory so here now is
[17:16] ephraim and then manas is up here okay
[17:18] so see judah has this this major portion
[17:21] there's moab so that's esau and
[17:24] that's a lot and lots of daughters
[17:27] is that interesting
[17:28] hanging right around the message
[17:30] right they're just hanging right around
[17:33] right there
[17:34] they're they're your family i'd say like
[17:36] that your relatives that you got to
[17:37] battle amen
[17:39] so uh we we we we you can see where we
[17:42] are here we're getting into ephraim here
[17:44] now that's this is the southern
[17:46] territory now here's the northern
[17:48] territory here's ephraim and then west
[17:49] manasseh you have issachar zebulun asher
[17:52] naphtali okay so that would be all 12.
[17:54] you have gad manasseh on this side
[17:56] and so there's your 12
[17:58] tribes
[17:59] uh did they all look the same did
[18:01] everybody get the same amount of space
[18:03] no
[18:04] no
[18:05] uh
[18:06] does that mean god's not fair
[18:08] no no god god's fair
[18:10] god's just right
[18:12] the bible said god gives talents or
[18:15] gifts based upon each man's several
[18:18] ability
[18:20] praise god so god gives you a gift now
[18:22] think about this god gave judas to scare
[18:23] it great gifts the greatest gifts
[18:25] apostle brother brahm said
[18:27] he was a five-talent preacher
[18:30] because apostle is the highest calling
[18:32] in the bible
[18:34] and yet he had five talents but yet he
[18:36] couldn't be faithful with it
[18:38] he must have buried it in the sand right
[18:40] he must have buried it in the world well
[18:42] i'm not going to preach anymore i'd
[18:42] rather have 30 pieces of silver
[18:45] he buried that
[18:46] so see church not all those who have the
[18:48] great blessings and talents and gifts
[18:50] are going to be faithful with it
[18:53] so we shouldn't envy anybody because god
[18:55] knew what you could handle
[18:57] praise god
[18:59] god had to give judah a bigger one
[19:00] because they were bigger people
[19:02] right
[19:04] god had to have a smaller groups because
[19:06] there was smaller amounts of people
[19:08] praise god
[19:09] but then
[19:10] but still we must each be responsible
[19:13] with what god has given to us remember
[19:16] jesus said if you're faithful jesus will
[19:18] take what others have left and he'll add
[19:21] it to you
[19:22] amen hallelujah
[19:25] so don't be discouraged if we're small
[19:27] or if you feel small or a small church
[19:29] don't be discouraged by size be
[19:32] encouraged that you're in the land amen
[19:35] and drive out every inhabitant you can
[19:38] and god will add to your borders amen
[19:41] you're going to see that at the end of
[19:43] this book and it also goes in the prayer
[19:44] of jabez where he says expand my borders
[19:47] well how in the world could that happen
[19:49] some other brother would have to go into
[19:51] uh would have to go into debt and then
[19:52] you'd have to buy his land for him
[19:54] that's the only way it could be done
[19:56] right
[19:57] or some brother died and you take his
[19:59] wife
[20:00] through marriage right and then you take
[20:02] his land to the the land of the man
[20:04] deceased that's the only way
[20:07] but god has ways no matter how small or
[20:10] insignificant we see god has ways to
[20:13] reward us god has ways to encourage us
[20:16] the main thing is to be strong and a
[20:18] very courageous that no man will stand
[20:21] before you all the days of their life
[20:24] meditate do turn not to the left turn
[20:27] not to the right but meditate on the
[20:29] word of god and god will fight for you
[20:31] amen
[20:33] amen
[20:34] this is what i'm learning not to uh
[20:37] not to be envious of bigger churches
[20:40] never
[20:41] because i don't know what god has done
[20:43] in their lives i don't know if they're
[20:44] being faithful or not so the bible says
[20:46] some men sins go before them others come
[20:48] after.
[20:50] so that means some people we're going to
[20:51] see their sins on this side some people
[20:53] we are not going to see their sins to
[20:55] the white throne judgment
[20:56] so i'm not going to be envious of
[20:58] anybody i just want to be faithful
[20:59] praise god
[21:02] i want to be happy for them but i want
[21:04] to be happy what god's done for us amen
[21:08] praise god amen
[21:11] she must be grateful
[21:12] i don't care which church i don't care
[21:14] if i was the smallest one i wouldn't
[21:16] care if i'm zebulun issachar benjamin
[21:19] benjamin was actually the smallest i
[21:20] don't care if i'm benjamin there's
[21:22] little benjamins in there
[21:24] i don't care if i'm benjamin i don't
[21:25] care if i'm judah i'm just one of them
[21:28] praise god
[21:31] i used to live in egypt but now i live
[21:33] in the promised land amen
[21:36] i used to be a slave but now i'm a king
[21:39] amen
[21:40] hallelujah
[21:42] praise god amen i don't care i i'm born
[21:45] again christ lives in me the holy ghost
[21:48] lives in me praise god that's enough to
[21:51] make me happy amen
[21:54] i'm not going to worry about well this
[21:55] guy's got a bigger church or they got
[21:57] more let them have whatever they got
[21:59] i've got exactly what god wants me to
[22:01] have and i'm thankful for that praise
[22:03] god sorry guys
[22:06] i need to set up one of those spit
[22:07] shields right here
[22:09] forgive me
[22:10] i really try to watch that so forgive me
[22:13] we'll be breaking out the
[22:14] uh hand sanitizer
[22:17] forgive me
[22:19] forgive me
[22:21] sometimes i get so excited you know i
[22:22] just kind of
[22:24] all right let's skip ahead here now i'm
[22:26] going here isn't it's into wednesday
[22:28] nights
[22:29] i'm just gonna i'm just gonna be
[22:30] reviewing real quick here on paul
[22:33] paul had all five preaching gifts
[22:36] now what happens as we study the message
[22:38] is brother random grew in his revelation
[22:42] but some people will hang on to one
[22:43] quote and they'll hang on to it like
[22:45] it's life and death
[22:46] but if there's no thus saith the lord
[22:48] behind it or there's no bible backing on
[22:50] it well then they ought to just leave it
[22:51] on the shelf
[22:54] because of their own doctrines and their
[22:55] previous thinking they want to hang on
[22:57] to things
[22:59] so with this with paul when the quotes
[23:01] people hang on her brother and say you
[23:03] can't mix the offices there's quotes
[23:05] if you're a pastor you can't be a
[23:07] prophet which can be true it can be true
[23:10] with someone if you only have a
[23:11] pastoring gift or if you only have a
[23:13] prophet gift
[23:15] but the bible plainly shows paul had
[23:17] numerous gifts of the holy ghost
[23:20] praise god amen so we we understand what
[23:23] brother man is trying to say
[23:24] but people will hang on to these things
[23:26] and well i'm always a prophet or i'm
[23:28] always a pastor i can never evangelize
[23:30] that's not that's not the right thinking
[23:32] you should say i'm always going to be a
[23:34] pastor but the lord wants to use me in
[23:36] evangelism or want to use me on the
[23:37] missionary field he'll send me praise
[23:39] god
[23:41] right
[23:41] just like you would say i can see i have
[23:43] the gift of divine healing in my life or
[23:45] i have the gift of prophecy or i have to
[23:47] get through tongues or interpretation
[23:49] but god could use me for the gift of
[23:51] wisdom
[23:52] i do have the gift of discernment i can
[23:54] sometimes discern spirits on people and
[23:57] be right and recognize satan and cast
[23:59] down save but i could also be used for a
[24:02] miracle amen
[24:05] i better say out here i better stay back
[24:06] here today
[24:07] ah but he but see
[24:10] people get so
[24:12] caught up on their understanding that
[24:14] the the the books all the words in the
[24:17] books become their absolute instead of
[24:18] the word
[24:19] but brother brahm said i'm pointing you
[24:21] to the absolute jesus christ the word
[24:24] amen
[24:26] i just heard a quote yesterday what was
[24:27] i listening to where brother brad says
[24:29] i'm always learning
[24:30] oh it's adoption part 4 1960.
[24:33] he said i'm always learning he said he
[24:34] said i've kept the same revelations all
[24:36] my life like water baptism in the name
[24:38] of lord jesus christ uh like women with
[24:40] long hair and all these things he said
[24:42] he said god as he's he's constantly
[24:44] showing me new things he says and they
[24:46] always line up with the previous
[24:48] revelation he said i'm learning new
[24:50] revelations and the church said
[24:53] we ought to get the same new revelations
[24:55] but they're all the same they all line
[24:57] up with everything we've already heard
[24:59] amen
[25:02] so the bible plainly shows paul had all
[25:05] five gifts i guess i'm gonna try to go
[25:07] through faster here
[25:09] in one verse he says he has two gifts
[25:12] so how can anybody say he he can't be a
[25:14] teacher and a prophet
[25:16] he can't be an apostle and a teacher
[25:18] what the bible says he is
[25:20] so who's right your little uh your
[25:22] little
[25:23] people can you say p brain mind or is
[25:27] the bible right
[25:28] the bible's right church the bible's
[25:31] right
[25:32] you just have to realize there's a time
[25:34] and season for every ministry praise god
[25:37] see and then he says let's go visit the
[25:39] brothers we already have that's
[25:41] evangelism
[25:44] right now a lot of people confuse
[25:45] evangelism and say someone will go like
[25:47] if i'll go over to guyana or south
[25:51] africa or trinidad and i go to churches
[25:53] i'm not a missionary i'm an evangelist a
[25:56] missionary goes to where there's no
[25:57] christians and makes converts and sets
[26:00] up churches
[26:01] there's a great confusion a lot of
[26:03] evangelist thinks they think they're
[26:04] missionaries but they're not they're not
[26:06] going to get a missionary reward they're
[26:08] going to get evangelist reward
[26:10] but see they we got to go to the
[26:12] scripture to make sure we believe the
[26:14] truth
[26:16] here it says again he went through
[26:17] confirming that means making them
[26:19] stronger that means they were already
[26:20] strong but he just made him stronger
[26:23] hallelujah praise god
[26:26] and now here he does the pastor work
[26:28] because brother branham says now here we
[26:30] get back to judas brother brahm said
[26:32] judas sold out the opportunity to be an
[26:34] apostle the highest calling in the
[26:36] bible so on earth the highest calling is
[26:40] an apostle
[26:42] but now brother william
[26:44] help me on wednesday there's also though
[26:46] a higher level of the messengers
[26:48] right
[26:50] so brother abraham said paul pastored
[26:52] for 22 years the ephesian church that's
[26:55] what he said when he preached it but
[26:56] when he wrote the church age book he
[26:58] said he only pastored three years
[27:01] what does the bible say the bible says
[27:02] three years so which one are we going to
[27:04] believe the bible
[27:07] and you have to do that with people
[27:08] because every people say every word is
[27:10] thus saith the lord paul pastored 22
[27:11] years well he said over here
[27:13] three years
[27:16] oh that's easy 2 3
[27:19] 25.
[27:20] now come on
[27:22] come on that that's what they'll do they
[27:25] will they will they will go to any
[27:27] lengths to try to prove every word is
[27:28] thus saith the lord
[27:30] like uh the one gentleman uh who goes to
[27:32] jeffersonville church on youtube he told
[27:34] me he said well he said the white horse
[27:36] rider was the holy spirit at the
[27:38] beginning
[27:39] but then he morphed into the antichrist
[27:41] later i'm like brother you
[27:43] you must not listen to the seven seals
[27:46] as much as you say you press play you
[27:47] must not press play play or you must
[27:49] been working while you're trying to
[27:49] listen to the seals or something like
[27:51] that you just missed the whole thing
[27:52] buddy
[27:54] and they'll try to say 1977 did end
[27:57] america and there was something happened
[27:59] in america before 1977 and there was
[28:01] only tree stumps left i'm like brother
[28:03] this never even happened but lamb said i
[28:05] see i saw all the
[28:07] all of america just tree stumps
[28:10] in a vision and i'm predicting it's
[28:12] before 77 well that didn't happen
[28:15] that was just his thoughts right he said
[28:17] that's just his prediction but they
[28:19] still try to say well yeah it happened
[28:21] somehow there were some wars and battles
[28:23] overseas
[28:25] no they
[28:26] they're they're blind leaders of the
[28:28] blind
[28:30] and they're straining out a net and
[28:32] swallowing a camel
[28:34] they have a religious and that's the
[28:35] hardest ones i was driving down the road
[28:37] brother william this weekend i thought
[28:38] that's right we're battling the hardest
[28:39] demons religious demons amen
[28:43] right
[28:44] if somebody was in here frothing or had
[28:46] satanic marks all over we could we feel
[28:49] real sorry for them and everybody would
[28:50] know they have a demon but the sad part
[28:52] is people can walk in here say they
[28:54] believe brother branham look nice as you
[28:56] and i
[28:57] and they won't receive anything unless
[28:59] you say brother brandon brother brandon
[29:00] brother brandon brother branham that
[29:02] happened to me last time i went to iowa
[29:03] a guy afterwards told the pastor brother
[29:05] brooks he said well brother jesse don't
[29:07] believe the message because he didn't
[29:08] say brother branham enough during the
[29:09] sermon
[29:10] oh come on
[29:11] when did brother say that when does the
[29:13] bible say that when did paul say say my
[29:15] name every time you preach
[29:17] that paul didn't say that paul said
[29:19] preach the word amen
[29:22] the word preach the word of god be
[29:24] instant in season odysseus and amen
[29:27] but you see you got criticizers because
[29:29] they got a critical spirit on them
[29:31] and you're never going to convince them
[29:33] i don't care what they say i just care
[29:35] what jesus says
[29:36] i want jesus to vindicate my life amen i
[29:39] want jesus to preach through me amen
[29:42] to preach his word and direct people
[29:44] back to the word of god amen
[29:47] and yes but we're under the ministry of
[29:49] brother brown the whole time we're doing
[29:50] it
[29:51] praise god so three years now here's
[29:54] what i added
[29:55] but like brother william was saying i
[29:57] agree that's good thought
[29:59] the highest church age influence and
[30:01] revelation is the messenger
[30:04] okay that's that's above the whole age
[30:06] so from 1906 to 2021 and longer if it's
[30:10] longer
[30:11] the main influence of revelation is
[30:13] william branham's message from jesus
[30:16] just like john wesley was before that
[30:18] martin luther the main influencer that's
[30:20] what brother graham says in the church
[30:22] but now the highest calling on the earth
[30:25] and the the highest thing you can be
[30:27] called the greatest um uh ministry you
[30:30] can be called to as an apostle
[30:33] and brother man said judas he turned
[30:35] down the apostle which is greater than a
[30:37] prophet ministry
[30:38] the apostle down here on earth is
[30:41] greater it's a higher calling because i
[30:43] leave your family
[30:45] you gotta leave your family leave your
[30:47] your houses behind your children behind
[30:49] you've got to leave everything behind
[30:50] and jesus said that's the highest
[30:52] calling in the bible
[30:54] hallelujah praise god
[30:56] judas turned it down but the other 11
[30:58] received it and then matthias said i'll
[31:01] take his place i'll take that crown amen
[31:04] if somebody forsakes that i'll take it
[31:06] praise god i'm interested in working for
[31:09] christ amen
[31:11] hallelujah
[31:12] now brother random also says though the
[31:14] highest authority in the local church is
[31:17] the pastor
[31:20] and that's kind of what we did today
[31:21] brother william i'm sure he's noticed it
[31:23] i was telling him this we don't go to
[31:25] individual church members and try to
[31:27] proselytize them
[31:29] we don't do that now i kind of do that
[31:30] on youtube because you never know who's
[31:32] out there
[31:33] right you kind of do it on youtube
[31:35] but that's what brother brandon did
[31:36] brother brother uh neville had a radio
[31:38] ministry and it went to everybody didn't
[31:40] matter what church you were on you have
[31:42] to log in well this is my church's uh am
[31:44] radio station you know no it was
[31:46] everybody everybody in the hearing of it
[31:49] it was outreach
[31:51] and brother you know radio will reach
[31:52] those who needs at reach
[31:54] right
[31:55] god bless brother amen with the radio
[31:57] sermon recently really blessed him i
[31:59] agree there's been times i've heard
[32:01] things on youtube or a radio it's just
[32:03] been a great blessing to me i needed to
[32:05] hear that i was right in the path of god
[32:07] amen now thank god for those ministries
[32:10] praise god
[32:12] how many times does it help me just a
[32:13] sermon online no it's always a help
[32:15] because you're hungering for god
[32:17] sometimes brother i don't even know why
[32:19] i click something i'm like
[32:20] that's why i clicked it
[32:22] yeah roman catholic church or something
[32:24] like that i didn't even know why i
[32:26] clicked on that and there it is god's
[32:27] feeding me this word amen
[32:30] he's showing me signs he's helping me
[32:32] out praise god
[32:34] but let's just go through these briefly
[32:36] brother said the messenger to every age
[32:38] regardless of when he appears or goes is
[32:40] the one who influences that age for god
[32:42] by means of a word manifested ministry
[32:46] paul was that man
[32:49] so the the messenger influences
[32:51] everybody with the manifested word
[32:55] oh my
[32:56] who manifested like brother branham
[32:58] where i tell your address your doctor's
[33:00] name everything wrong with you what you
[33:02] did as a child when you got scared by a
[33:05] dog nobody could top that because that
[33:07] was
[33:08] that was the word manifested amen that
[33:11] was the word made flesh hallelujah
[33:14] anybody can't see that it's blind
[33:16] i don't mean they're not saved just
[33:18] means they're blind to the bride
[33:21] like jesus said they're lukewarm
[33:23] right
[33:24] blind right naked wretched miserable
[33:27] right they need a rebuke
[33:29] yes
[33:31] also in the church age book brother said
[33:33] they preached the second coming of
[33:34] christ but deny the advent of the
[33:36] prophet messenger though empowering
[33:38] signs and true revelation he eclipses
[33:41] them all right
[33:43] so see the the messenger's revelation is
[33:45] way up here everybody else is way down
[33:47] here
[33:49] oh it's okay brothers to smoke it's okay
[33:52] we saw a guy went to church he was
[33:53] smoking before he went in the church
[33:56] he was a deacon brother he was a deacon
[33:58] he took up the offering deacon smoking
[34:01] that's just that's fine
[34:03] that's fine that's what they say not for
[34:05] us that's why that's they think that's
[34:07] fine that's not fine
[34:09] but see revelation
[34:11] uh the revelation brother was so much
[34:12] higher because it was from the word amen
[34:15] it was the word of god just made plain
[34:18] the simple truce of god laying before us
[34:21] the prophet points it out and it's as if
[34:23] we never read it before praise god
[34:26] and it becomes brand new the bible
[34:28] becomes a new bible how come people
[34:30] never preach it because they're under
[34:31] the strong delusion the bible says
[34:34] brother brahman said it tells us any man
[34:36] that says a woman can cut her hair is
[34:39] possessed by the devil
[34:41] think about the message pastor that left
[34:43] and said that jeff jenkins i'm just
[34:44] going to say it because he
[34:46] they make fun of me on their youtube
[34:48] i'm not making fun of him i'm just
[34:49] saying it's okay to cut your hair but i
[34:52] said a man like that is possessed of the
[34:53] devil
[34:56] he said because that god says that's
[34:57] your glory
[34:58] and if god says it's your glory and man
[35:00] says it's wrong god is right man is
[35:03] wrong man's got an evil spirit he's
[35:05] speaking contrary to the holy spirit
[35:07] amen but it's revelation problems
[35:10] revelation from god eclipses everyone
[35:14] that's true
[35:16] now but we have the same pattern every
[35:18] age the light comes through a god-given
[35:20] man and then from there it spreads the
[35:23] light through the ministry of others
[35:27] who have been faithfully taught to just
[35:29] press play
[35:31] well that's not in there that's not in
[35:32] there
[35:33] my wife found a good quote the other day
[35:35] i was telling brother william i preached
[35:36] it years ago when i preached a church
[35:37] age series
[35:39] there was a man from georgia i believe
[35:41] it was brother evans and he would drive
[35:44] church from georgia to jeffersonville
[35:46] indiana every sunday can you imagine
[35:48] that and he'd have to leave right after
[35:49] the first service to drive all the way
[35:50] back to get home from work
[35:52] and my wife shared the quote with me was
[35:54] such a blessing
[35:55] and brother man he's praying at the
[35:57] beginning of service he said lord please
[35:59] raise up a messenger for brother evans
[36:01] down there that preaches the same thing
[36:02] i do
[36:04] now look at that
[36:06] brother man had enough confidence that
[36:08] god can raise up a man
[36:10] hundreds of miles away to preach the
[36:12] same thing that he was preaching in
[36:14] jeffersonville why because jesus is the
[36:16] same in georgia as he is in indiana amen
[36:22] because it
[36:23] they get both preachers get taught from
[36:25] the same teacher jesus christ amen
[36:29] they both got the same headquarters amen
[36:31] heaven hallelujah
[36:35] he didn't say well i just pray they'll
[36:37] start a tape church down there everybody
[36:39] would just hear me only and nope no
[36:40] other preachers
[36:43] so sad
[36:46] so you got to be a minister who's
[36:47] faithfully taught the word
[36:49] and then
[36:50] but all those who don't go out don't
[36:52] always learn how necessary to speak only
[36:54] what the messenger spoken but we've got
[36:55] to understand that it's spoken from the
[36:57] bible
[36:59] because if you say everything he said
[37:00] then billy paul is the promised joseph
[37:04] then
[37:05] 1977
[37:06] ended america and we're just living in
[37:08] some type of a a a partial reality
[37:12] we're not really here
[37:14] right we're not really here
[37:17] you see it's it's just insane that
[37:19] people would say things like that but
[37:21] it's not every word it's the it's what
[37:23] the word the prophet taught in the word
[37:25] of god amen it was the revelation and
[37:28] the revelation come with thus saith the
[37:30] lord amen that's how you know
[37:32] he says this is thus saith the holy
[37:34] spirit not thus saith william branham is
[37:37] thus saith christ amen
[37:39] that's how you know
[37:44] but sadly not always not everybody who
[37:46] claims to believe the message
[37:48] knows that what the message really is
[37:51] right
[37:53] now look he talked about john wesley's
[37:54] day
[37:55] john wesley was the voice with the word
[37:57] in his day
[37:59] the people who took his revelation from
[38:00] god became the living epistles read and
[38:02] known of all men for all for their
[38:04] generation church what are we we are the
[38:06] living epistles
[38:08] we are the walking letters of
[38:10] recommendation that's what the epistle
[38:11] was and that in that in that verse
[38:13] paul's saying i don't need a letter of
[38:15] recommendation to accept the preacher
[38:17] he said the word that you received you
[38:20] are the written epistle in other words
[38:21] you're the proof you're the
[38:23] recommendation that i'm a real preacher
[38:26] ah
[38:27] your lives are the real proof that i'm
[38:30] preaching the right thing amen
[38:32] hallelujah you are my my epistle right
[38:36] we're brother graham's epistles because
[38:38] you have a local you have a messenger
[38:40] you know we are we are all the same our
[38:42] lives prove we're the true church amen
[38:46] that's why it's important to listen to
[38:48] what people do when i listen to those
[38:50] those sermons
[38:51] and those preachers what they're talking
[38:52] about listen what kind of life do they
[38:54] live because that really tells uh which
[38:57] ministry they're really under
[38:59] and most of the time it's the domination
[39:02] or the mother rome as we saw this
[39:03] morning
[39:04] they're literally under that domination
[39:07] of mother rome
[39:08] and the other one's preaching about the
[39:09] beast and don't you know just right down
[39:11] the street
[39:14] when the methodist failed god raised up
[39:16] others
[39:17] that's you and i
[39:19] church god has raised you up out of the
[39:21] ashes we rise
[39:23] yes
[39:24] glory praise god i raised up on the
[39:27] assemblies of god denomination ashes
[39:31] god raised me up out of there amen
[39:34] he said
[39:35] and it's going on through the years to
[39:37] this last day there's again another
[39:39] people in the land who under their
[39:41] messenger who's pointing to the word
[39:43] will be the final voice to the final age
[39:47] amen
[39:48] see we're under the revelation of the
[39:50] messenger
[39:52] so there's no greater revelation than
[39:54] what brother branham had we just
[39:55] sometimes will get new scriptures
[39:57] brother i'm never preached on all that
[39:58] is is more of the same revelation
[40:01] hallelujah
[40:03] now here's where jesus said the apostles
[40:05] reward is the greatest
[40:07] you know the rich man came and left and
[40:09] jesus said hey
[40:10] we've left all we followed you what do
[40:13] we get
[40:14] he said truly i say unto you there's no
[40:16] man that have left his house brother and
[40:18] sisters father mother wife children
[40:20] lands for my sake and the gospels but he
[40:22] shall receive a hundredfold now in this
[40:24] time
[40:25] houses and brothers and sisters mothers
[40:27] and children lands with persecutions and
[40:29] the world to come eternal life
[40:32] the highest reward
[40:34] ever listed is apostle who leaves
[40:36] everything behind in order to gain souls
[40:38] for christ
[40:40] so there's no higher calling in the
[40:42] bible than to be an apostle
[40:45] but as brother branham tells us an
[40:47] apostle can't come around and undercut
[40:50] the
[40:50] pastor even if they don't want the truth
[40:55] he said but the full and complete
[40:56] authority of the church is the pastor
[40:57] read that in the bible see if it's not
[40:58] the bible order it's
[41:00] it's hebrews 13. i preached that
[41:01] numerous times right because the bible
[41:03] said your your shepherds will give an
[41:05] account for you on the day of judgment
[41:06] you have to give your account and then
[41:08] the pastor has to give an account for
[41:09] the church that's right right
[41:11] he said see if that's not bible order
[41:13] that's exactly right there's no one
[41:15] above the elder i have nothing to do
[41:16] with that what brother devil does here
[41:17] look he says nothing i have nothing i'm
[41:19] a prophet and here's a pastor i can't
[41:21] tell the i can't tell the pastor what to
[41:22] do
[41:23] now unless the pastor would say prophet
[41:25] can you pray for me and can you help me
[41:26] out
[41:28] but he can't take his authority away
[41:29] just i'm removing him that's like a
[41:31] denominational thing they do that all
[41:33] the time some guy gets caught in the uh
[41:35] with porn on his computer well i'm going
[41:37] to remove you i'm going to put you in a
[41:39] probation i'm going to move another guy
[41:41] here and that's a man that's that's
[41:43] that's not a man that's not led to the
[41:44] holy ghost
[41:46] see
[41:46] if brother neville wants to preach
[41:48] jehovah witness doctrine that's up to
[41:49] you and him if you want to preach
[41:51] anything you want to that's between you
[41:52] and him that's all if the congregation
[41:53] votes from there to preach that's all
[41:55] right that's up to him
[41:57] so we have different levels we're
[41:58] talking about we have a church age level
[42:00] we have a bible level we also have a
[42:02] local level
[42:04] of authority that's what people don't
[42:05] understand
[42:07] now brother look at brother my doctrine
[42:09] i don't preach doctrine out there
[42:10] nothing but just great evangelical
[42:12] fundamentals because i'm with the
[42:13] brethren they might differ with me and i
[42:15] just
[42:16] i don't give that out before the people
[42:18] here i just try to stay on that real
[42:19] fundamentalist of the scripture such as
[42:21] we believe
[42:22] but at my tabernacle they tape it if you
[42:24] want it you can have it if your pastor
[42:25] don't want you to have it take it don't
[42:27] take it see that's up to you look how
[42:28] respectful he was of pastors
[42:31] that's why we don't try to hey sn over
[42:33] at the at the catholic parking lot hey
[42:35] come over here i got something to share
[42:36] with you we
[42:38] we just go in try to
[42:39] be kind and say well i had a message for
[42:42] your past that's what i told the guy
[42:43] today i said i had a message for your
[42:44] pastor uh the father
[42:46] they call they don't call it pastor they
[42:47] call it father at the catholic parish i
[42:50] said i have a message for your father
[42:51] revelation 10 7 the mystery of god's
[42:53] finished i said that's my message for
[42:55] your pastor he said oh i never heard of
[42:57] william branham
[42:58] i said most people don't
[43:00] but i'm here to tell you
[43:02] amen
[43:03] but see that's why we don't i don't
[43:05] undercut other pastors i don't try to
[43:07] steal their sheep
[43:09] because if i if i convince them to come
[43:10] in somebody else is going to convince
[43:11] him to go out
[43:13] but if jesus calls somebody in here if
[43:15] jesus sends somebody in here then
[43:17] they're here to stay amen
[43:19] because jesus sent him here to get fed
[43:22] jesus came to give him the two pence
[43:24] right jesus uh healed up their wounds
[43:26] and poured oil and wine in there and
[43:28] said pastor you just you just feed them
[43:30] till i come back and if i owe you
[43:31] anything i'll give you the reward when i
[43:33] when i come back
[43:35] amen
[43:37] here in 1954 says many of you at your
[43:39] post at new to your church is tomorrow
[43:40] greet your pastors for me
[43:42] i'm perfectly interdenominational that's
[43:45] right
[43:46] i believe all christians are brothers
[43:47] sisters we should worship together it's
[43:48] too bad the bearers break us down and so
[43:50] forth and i have never at one time in my
[43:52] life ever knowingly to be guilty of
[43:53] proselytizing or telling a person what
[43:55] church they're supposed to belong to
[43:57] i believe that's a man's got a liberty
[43:59] to make up that mind on what church that
[44:01] he desires to go to see it's such a fine
[44:03] line
[44:04] right you want to witness the people but
[44:06] you don't want to be denominational
[44:07] because message people become
[44:08] denominational too
[44:10] right well my church is the only one
[44:12] that's got it you got to come to my
[44:13] church or you're not born again or
[44:15] something like that that's nonsense
[44:16] jesus said whosoever will let him come
[44:19] and drink of the waters of life amen
[44:22] if any man's thirst of any woman but
[44:24] thirst hunger he said i'll give no
[44:26] living waters of life amen
[44:28] it's not a building it's a person amen
[44:31] hallelujah
[44:33] that's what that whole sermon is about
[44:35] god's chosen place of worship brother
[44:37] branham ends that by saying he said if
[44:39] i'm going to point you somewhere where
[44:41] am i going to point you he said i won't
[44:42] point you to branham tabernacle we're
[44:44] just as bad as everybody else he says
[44:48] listen to it church he said i'm not
[44:50] going to point you to brad tabernacle
[44:51] they have as much trouble as anybody but
[44:54] i'm going to point you to the place
[44:56] where god placed his name that's in
[44:58] christ amen
[45:00] hallelujah jesus said i come in my
[45:03] father's name amen
[45:05] god place his name in christ in other
[45:07] words the holy ghost and if you obey the
[45:10] holy ghost he'll send you to a real
[45:11] church
[45:15] i would never be guilty of proselytizing
[45:18] telling a man what church to go to
[45:23] now there are quotes that say the
[45:25] messenger and the message are one
[45:29] but a prophet's human thoughts are not
[45:31] the message
[45:35] when when moses smote the rock and
[45:38] you bunch of rebels was that god's
[45:40] message no because it kept him out of
[45:41] the promised land god had offered in the
[45:43] promised land but because of his
[45:44] disobedience that proves not every word
[45:47] a prophet says is part of the message
[45:50] he wanted to go over but he couldn't
[45:51] because of pride
[45:53] but god said you exalted yourself more
[45:55] than me
[45:57] look what i can do look what my gifts
[45:58] can do
[46:00] see
[46:01] not everything a prophet says
[46:03] is the message of the prophet
[46:07] we find out when a man comes sent from
[46:09] god ordained of god with the truth thus
[46:11] saith the lord the message and the
[46:12] messenger one of the same because he's
[46:14] sent to represent thus saith the lord
[46:15] now look represent
[46:18] word by word now look word by word
[46:21] not
[46:21] opinion by opinion
[46:24] so he and his message is the same a
[46:27] domination man under the denominational
[46:28] octopus as we saw this morning he in the
[46:30] church is the one a theologian under
[46:32] theology made by some denomination he
[46:34] and his message are one church of
[46:36] theology a theologian it's correct see
[46:38] so denominational preacher is one with
[46:40] his denomination
[46:42] so is a real preacher one with christ
[46:45] hallelujah amen
[46:47] glory
[46:48] then when a man comes with us saith the
[46:50] lord he and the message is one
[46:53] and when elijah come with they'll say
[46:55] the lord he and his message became one
[46:56] just as jesus when he come he was the
[46:58] word saint john 1. so the word of god
[47:01] and the message messenger of the age was
[47:02] the self-same thing all the time that's
[47:05] right
[47:06] but not every word that he said just the
[47:08] message the bible message that he taught
[47:10] does everybody understand
[47:11] see this is why it's so confusing to
[47:13] these people that are spiritually blind
[47:15] they see word by word and they think
[47:16] every word on the tape is thus saith the
[47:18] lord
[47:19] or they think
[47:20] uh the message with itself same thing
[47:22] okay the word of god well brother man
[47:23] taught the word of god so brother
[47:25] brahm's word is equal to god
[47:27] every word does not say the lord well
[47:29] you've just misunderstood everything he
[47:31] said
[47:33] praise god you just misunderstood the
[47:35] whole meaning of it he's one with the
[47:37] word in other words every time you think
[47:39] of god's word you think of moses
[47:42] parting the red sea
[47:44] every time you think of joshua you think
[47:46] of the wall is falling down joshua
[47:48] didn't do that the message did that amen
[47:51] the word did that hallelujah not
[47:53] joshua's failure ai or his fear with the
[47:56] gibbonites that wasn't part of his
[47:57] message his part of the message was
[47:59] backed by thus saith the lord and it
[48:02] manifested the word amen
[48:06] glory
[48:08] the words of the prophet that are not
[48:09] manifested word are not the message
[48:14] because when simon preached it
[48:17] elijah tells god god i'm the only one
[48:19] left was that part of his message
[48:21] if it was his message was wrong
[48:23] if it was his message had lies in it
[48:26] or misconceptions at the very least
[48:29] because god said yet i have seven
[48:30] thousand not seven hundred
[48:33] seven thousand
[48:36] right because that's a joke because
[48:38] people asked brother around that about
[48:39] ten times in the questions and answers
[48:40] because he said the wrong he said the
[48:42] wrong number he said as a minister of
[48:43] the gospel i preached that many times
[48:45] and he said it's just a slip of the
[48:47] tongue he said you forgive me
[48:49] he said i knew that was seven thousand
[48:52] but see who's right is
[48:54] i thought the message and the messenger
[48:56] were one
[48:58] well shouldn't god say he's sorry
[49:00] because the messenger said he's the only
[49:02] one left
[49:04] no god don't apologize to anybody god's
[49:07] right he's the year amen he's the word
[49:10] he's the absolute let every other word
[49:13] of man be alive and let god be true
[49:18] can you imagine god apologizing i'm
[49:19] sorry prophet messenger yeah there's
[49:21] only one i'm sorry
[49:22] those other seven thousand i'll just
[49:24] i'll just put them out from under the
[49:25] blood come on
[49:27] foolish
[49:29] foolish for people to say these things
[49:31] what does it church see they don't spend
[49:32] enough time right here
[49:34] it's all press play i'm a mess and
[49:36] believer i'm the royal seat of abraham
[49:39] and they don't spend enough time right
[49:40] here i mean you understand
[49:44] the whole point of the message was to
[49:46] point us back to here
[49:50] and they know more brother of sermon
[49:51] titles than they do bible books
[49:56] that's wrong
[49:57] you should listen to the tapes but your
[49:59] bible should be your main feeding source
[50:02] and you should listen to brother branham
[50:04] but don't but don't exalt brother
[50:07] branham above christ
[50:09] right
[50:10] don't exalt the forerunner above the one
[50:13] who the runner who is coming after her
[50:15] damn
[50:16] right
[50:18] don't fall in love with the friend of
[50:20] the bridegroom fall in love with the
[50:22] bridegroom amen
[50:26] don't marry the best man marry the groom
[50:30] right
[50:32] oh mercy lord
[50:34] that's what we battle on this day that's
[50:35] what we battle
[50:37] that's what we battle
[50:38] so look at this jeffersonville says the
[50:40] prophet carries the word that's true
[50:43] but abraham said the prophet is the word
[50:45] but he also says the prophet is not the
[50:47] full word
[50:49] so see they take one quote and rally
[50:50] around that to try to get
[50:52] oh we're the only ones right everybody
[50:53] else outside of us is wrong we're the
[50:55] only ones right we've got the prophet we
[50:57] got the living prophet and we brother
[50:58] still our pastor but we got a son we
[51:00] have two pastors come on
[51:02] nonsense
[51:05] so we got down our knees see now jesus
[51:06] would have had to do that for he was the
[51:08] word now we're not the word the word of
[51:10] the uh look at that we're not the word
[51:12] we are brother
[51:13] we are not the word
[51:15] the word of the lord came to the
[51:17] prophets they wasn't the word but the
[51:19] word come to them that's the difference
[51:23] but jesus was the word
[51:27] everything jesus said was the word amen
[51:30] it was right it was true
[51:33] there's no lie in it praise god no
[51:36] falsehood in it we just receive the word
[51:40] we're carriers of the word we represent
[51:42] the word but we're not the full word
[51:44] itself only christ is the fullness of
[51:47] the word made flesh bodily amen glory
[51:52] amen
[51:53] but see they'll they don't they must
[51:55] ignore that quote and they just they
[51:57] rally around this quote
[51:59] see hosea he's got a mission he sent
[52:01] from the lord he is the word of god
[52:02] because he's carrying the word of the
[52:03] lord that is a true prophet of god so
[52:06] they exalt this quote but they threw out
[52:07] the other one
[52:08] see brother and was the word he was he
[52:10] was the word
[52:11] every word word by word the messenger of
[52:13] the word message and word same thing see
[52:15] how they lie like that see how they
[52:16] can't even have no discernment there it
[52:18] is again
[52:20] they can't even recognize the antichrist
[52:22] spirit
[52:23] making them exalt brother branham
[52:25] instead of worshiping jesus christ only
[52:30] they must forgot to read this one too
[52:32] this is the last day prophet will have
[52:33] such power before the lord that there be
[52:35] those who mistake him for the lord jesus
[52:37] which is what jeffersonville does
[52:40] there will be a spirit in the world at
[52:41] the end time that will seduce some and
[52:43] make them believe this
[52:44] but don't believe it he's not jesus
[52:46] christ he's the son he's not the son of
[52:48] god he's one of the brethren
[52:50] a prophet a messenger a servant of god
[52:53] he needs no greater honor bestowed upon
[52:55] him than that which john received when
[52:57] he was the voice that cried i am not he
[52:59] but he is coming after me
[53:03] any time they say every word on the tape
[53:05] is thus saith the lord they've just
[53:06] exalted john the baptist over christ
[53:09] do you understand what i'm saying
[53:12] what did everybody do that followed john
[53:13] the baptist well eventually john the
[53:15] baptist died so what'd they do they had
[53:16] to if they wanted to know the truth they
[53:18] had to move on to christ
[53:20] right after they had a choice do i sit
[53:23] here in my dead denomination i sit here
[53:25] in death or do i move on to the one the
[53:28] prophet pointed to amen
[53:31] we've got to move on to the war that's
[53:33] what we've done we've moved on to the
[53:35] one the prophet pointed to the word of
[53:37] god the holy ghost speaking through the
[53:39] word
[53:42] he deserves honor brother deserves honor
[53:44] just like john the baptist but no
[53:46] greater honor
[53:48] right than each other
[53:50] and then nothing close to worshiping
[53:51] jesus christ
[53:54] all worship goes to christ
[53:56] see
[53:58] it has to be but we can't make every
[54:00] word infallible
[54:02] all right let's get to joshua now
[54:04] everyone take a deep breath ready
[54:06] say brother jesse's gonna step off the
[54:07] soapbox now he's gonna that
[54:10] but church i'm defending you though
[54:13] so if anybody comes in here trying to
[54:14] spread that all that false lies i'm
[54:16] defending you i'm fighting for you
[54:18] praise god
[54:19] i'm here to protect your life
[54:21] and you protect mine with your prayers
[54:22] amen i need your prayers amen we
[54:26] benefit one another praise god
[54:28] joshua 17. now here's the outline church
[54:30] you've got your bibles well i think
[54:32] we'll hit a few
[54:34] okay i've got about 15 minutes left for
[54:35] my hour we'll see you know let's kind of
[54:36] see how that goes joshua 17.
[54:42] i just finished judges and it's really
[54:44] striking to see how far the people fall
[54:47] just you know years after joshua dies
[54:49] it's really really striking to see how
[54:51] fast they fall just like brother brown
[54:52] brother left the scene look how fast
[54:54] people fall
[54:56] they can't decide well who is there an
[54:57] eighth messenger
[54:59] uh is brother branham still my pastor is
[55:00] brother braham coming back they can't
[55:02] even decide these things
[55:04] because they're not praying enough
[55:05] they're not reading their bible enough
[55:08] see they fall fast because they're
[55:10] they're depending on someone else's
[55:11] revelation but you're the one who god
[55:13] has to get a revelation from the father
[55:14] himself
[55:16] jesus told peter no man no man glory no
[55:20] man has received revelation from me he
[55:23] said but peter you received it from my
[55:25] father above and he said flesh and blood
[55:27] has not revealed it and the gates of
[55:29] hell will not prevent prevail against
[55:31] the revelation that god the father gave
[55:33] you amen
[55:35] hallelujah the thing is they're getting
[55:36] revelation what they think revelation
[55:38] from a tape
[55:40] a revelation from a so-called pastor or
[55:42] so-called living prophet and they're
[55:44] really not getting it from the father
[55:45] because if they had the father's
[55:47] revelation no seducing spirit would
[55:49] deceive them it's impossible for the
[55:51] elect to be deceived amen
[55:54] impossible
[55:56] because you've got christ on the inside
[55:59] amen you can't deceive christ glory
[56:04] hallelujah
[56:05] one of these days i want to go back and
[56:06] listen how many times do i amen my own
[56:08] sermons here
[56:10] i just can't help but i'm at that
[56:11] baptist church and i'm saying amen
[56:14] amen
[56:15] brother i'm saying hallelujah
[56:18] i just got to say it when i hear
[56:19] something good amen that's cicum devil
[56:23] right
[56:24] see get that devil out of here
[56:27] get that dead water let christ dwell
[56:29] amongst us let heaven come down as we
[56:31] say let the prince of god fill this
[56:33] place
[56:36] amen that's what you do when you say
[56:38] amen
[56:39] drives away the demons and all things
[56:41] are possible amen to them that believe
[56:45] hallelujah
[56:47] thank god
[56:50] so verses one and two
[56:55] so we had ephraim in chapter 16. now we
[56:57] have manasseh the other son of joseph
[57:00] in chapter 17.
[57:04] now verse 3
[57:06] 3-6 should be familiar brother can
[57:08] preach on this last time he was here
[57:11] that last november december
[57:14] and he's coming next month by god's
[57:15] grace
[57:16] the daughters of
[57:17] zelophehad
[57:19] receive they finally receive it when cam
[57:21] preached it he showed us the scripture
[57:22] where they uh where they were they were
[57:24] pleading for and moses gave it to them
[57:27] but here in this chapter they actually
[57:28] possess it
[57:30] so i thought it was very fitting i
[57:31] wanted to i want to share some of the
[57:32] sister quotes that would encourage our
[57:34] sisters it's very fitting because that's
[57:35] what we come to in the joshua where
[57:37] sisters inherit land under normal
[57:40] circumstances they wouldn't inherit land
[57:42] but with this new ministry they inherit
[57:44] land
[57:45] amen
[57:47] with this new holy ghost ministry the
[57:49] sisters have rightful inheritance amen
[57:52] just like the brothers everybody has
[57:54] rightful inheritance if they just call
[57:56] out for it amen
[57:58] if they're willing to fight for it
[58:00] praise god if they're willing to battle
[58:02] and say give me my inheritance joshua
[58:04] will give it to them amen
[58:07] oh glory
[58:09] verses 7-13 the borders of manasseh are
[58:11] described
[58:13] including the inhabitants they couldn't
[58:14] look at three chapters in a row church
[58:16] judah
[58:19] ephraim manasseh
[58:20] none of the tribes could drive out all
[58:22] the inhabitants
[58:24] shows how every holy ghost saint is not
[58:26] going to be able to drive out every
[58:29] single
[58:30] sin nature inside of you
[58:32] you'll drive out a lot of them you'll
[58:34] drive enough out to live a really good
[58:35] life
[58:38] glory you'll drive so many out you're in
[58:40] a new land you have all these blessings
[58:42] you've got the corn you've got the ox
[58:44] you get you got you got your weapons you
[58:46] got all these all these blessings around
[58:48] your life but there's still a few every
[58:49] now and then there's some hindrances
[58:51] that you got to deal with
[58:53] everybody had to deal with that
[58:56] right
[58:56] and it's a type that you and i must
[58:59] battle against the lust of the flesh the
[59:01] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[59:07] all right verse 14 18.
[59:10] this is a beautiful thought i'm gonna
[59:11] get to this maybe
[59:12] wednesday
[59:14] i kind of feel like just to stay on
[59:15] joshua
[59:18] the complaint this is one of these
[59:19] beautiful thoughts i kind of mentioned
[59:20] on wednesday the complaint of the
[59:22] children of joseph and joshua's
[59:23] encouragement
[59:25] we'll get to that
[59:26] let's look at sisters here they have a
[59:28] unique uh they have unique borders our
[59:30] sisters do yeah
[59:33] look at verse uh
[59:35] look at verse three
[59:36] but zelo for haddad the son of he for
[59:39] the son of gilead the son of mature and
[59:41] the son of manasseh had no sons but
[59:42] daughters and these are the names of the
[59:44] daughters
[59:45] mala noah look noah's a unisex name
[59:48] see so a girl could be called noah in
[59:50] the jewish faith
[59:51] i just like jesse my name's jesse
[59:52] there's a lot of girls named jessie
[59:54] right give me a unisex name
[59:57] hogla or hogla
[59:59] milka and turza and they came here
[1:00:01] before ellie is the priest before josh
[1:00:03] the son of nun and before the prince is
[1:00:04] saying the lord commanded moses to give
[1:00:06] us inheritance among our brethren
[1:00:07] therefore according to the commandment
[1:00:08] of the lord he gave them inheritance
[1:00:10] among the brethren of the father and
[1:00:12] therefore ten portions to manasseh
[1:00:13] beside the land of gilead and bashan
[1:00:16] which were on the other side of jordan
[1:00:18] look at that church the si the five
[1:00:20] virgins glory the five wise virgins amen
[1:00:24] in the promised land that's what cam
[1:00:26] preaches beautiful thought
[1:00:28] came there and they say we were promised
[1:00:30] this by the prophet before we came into
[1:00:32] the baptism of the holy ghost we were
[1:00:34] promised possessions
[1:00:36] so give them to us
[1:00:38] so joshua stands there the prophet and
[1:00:41] eliezer the priest he's got the uremon
[1:00:45] and
[1:00:46] they say give us our inheritance and no
[1:00:48] doubt joshua and the priest said hey
[1:00:50] pray about this let's go before the lord
[1:00:52] and they go pray and they're praying all
[1:00:54] of a sudden they see the light start
[1:00:56] flashing on the on the stones
[1:00:58] and now he says yes yes yes joshua here
[1:01:01] it is and they go yes sisters here's
[1:01:02] your inheritance it says with this place
[1:01:04] in manasseh uh the prophet and the
[1:01:07] european
[1:01:09] the prophet and the word of god agree to
[1:01:12] give our sisters their inheritance amen
[1:01:16] as long as it flashes on the yerman
[1:01:18] thunder sisters that's your inheritance
[1:01:21] amen
[1:01:23] brothers too
[1:01:25] brothers too
[1:01:26] as long as it flashes with the prophet
[1:01:28] and the priest
[1:01:31] the european thunder which is the word
[1:01:33] as long as you get some supernatural
[1:01:35] light
[1:01:36] then that's your right as a christian
[1:01:43] so the devil can't say well no you don't
[1:01:44] get that you're a woman no
[1:01:47] well see you're a woman and you're a
[1:01:48] lower type of person than a man
[1:01:51] no you you sister your daughter's a hell
[1:01:53] of a dad you don't deserve that
[1:01:55] your husband's died or i'm sure you've
[1:01:57] never been married see it's your fault
[1:01:59] you're not married you're not really
[1:02:00] stepping in you don't deserve any
[1:02:01] possession and the holy ghost stands
[1:02:03] there and says no they deserve it
[1:02:05] and i give it to you with thus saith the
[1:02:07] lord
[1:02:09] so dave you're lying take your lives
[1:02:11] back to hell the word of god gives these
[1:02:14] sisters the right to possess their
[1:02:16] father's inheritance amen
[1:02:18] don't let anybody tell you you can't
[1:02:21] have what the word of god gives you
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:26] hallelujah
[1:02:28] malcolm go get my my blue book and bring
[1:02:30] it up here could you buddy please i
[1:02:31] should say please i sound like i'm
[1:02:33] ordering people around
[1:02:34] please buddy please
[1:02:36] i guess i'm under this like strong
[1:02:37] anointing or something like that like a
[1:02:39] boldness i'm too bold
[1:02:41] forgive me lord
[1:02:44] anyways
[1:02:45] now sisters cannot preach from the
[1:02:47] pulpit but can speak basically anywhere
[1:02:49] else
[1:02:51] thanks buddy yep
[1:02:52] i appreciate that buddy thank you remind
[1:02:54] me i need to give you some chatter pucks
[1:02:55] remember that
[1:02:58] he does all in he's gonna remind me he's
[1:02:59] gonna remind me i know he's gonna remind
[1:03:00] me
[1:03:02] he'll share
[1:03:04] sisters can read scripture out loud for
[1:03:07] the preacher
[1:03:08] which many of you have done for me
[1:03:11] that can read the word there
[1:03:13] but it all changes when it comes here
[1:03:18] a sister can say thus saith the lord out
[1:03:20] there but all changes when she comes
[1:03:22] behind here
[1:03:24] a sister can say thus at the lord right
[1:03:27] here
[1:03:28] but she can't do it when she comes right
[1:03:29] here
[1:03:31] because this represents the authority of
[1:03:33] god
[1:03:34] this represents in the stead of jesus
[1:03:37] christ and we are
[1:03:38] all men all women all men and women we
[1:03:40] are we're awful representatives of our
[1:03:42] own or our own selves
[1:03:44] right we're not we're not magnifying men
[1:03:46] men are just as failure as women
[1:03:48] but because of the order right
[1:03:50] man woman woman's for the glory of man
[1:03:52] god has the order so god has that order
[1:03:55] so the women can speak anywhere else
[1:03:57] just not right here
[1:04:00] and she can operate all nine gifts of
[1:04:02] the holy ghost
[1:04:04] not church some of them
[1:04:06] are words
[1:04:09] some of them are words
[1:04:11] that means the woman's got to speak up
[1:04:14] and say something to him sometimes to a
[1:04:16] man
[1:04:18] that's right
[1:04:19] sometimes
[1:04:21] but you got to do it with the right
[1:04:22] anointing that's right that's right
[1:04:26] you gotta do with the right attitude
[1:04:28] just like a man a man should give o
[1:04:29] sister a word with the right attitude
[1:04:32] like brother william was saying so many
[1:04:34] preachers would say oh the people come
[1:04:36] up for a closer walk well you're just
[1:04:37] lukewarm he would that preacher would be
[1:04:39] derating or degrading the people
[1:04:41] you're just a lukewarm layer to say look
[1:04:44] they've been serving god for 20 30 years
[1:04:46] how could they be lukewarm they're
[1:04:47] faithful they're just they're weak up
[1:04:48] here they're just going through a season
[1:04:51] see so brothers should never degrade
[1:04:52] sister sisters should never degrade
[1:04:54] brothers we should show that common
[1:04:56] unity of love
[1:04:58] it's called holy ghost love
[1:05:00] look it up
[1:05:01] it's in the bible praise god that should
[1:05:03] have been shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:05:05] the holy ghost amen so if you got born
[1:05:08] again you will do that if you make a
[1:05:09] mistake you'll say sorry
[1:05:11] very simple very simple but most message
[1:05:14] people are not born again
[1:05:16] true it's just look at their lives and
[1:05:18] look look look what they fall into look
[1:05:21] at the false doctrines they fall into
[1:05:24] paul said
[1:05:25] damnable heresies prove they were not
[1:05:28] they're there to prove that those were
[1:05:30] not the elect i'm paraphrasing that's
[1:05:32] romans 16.
[1:05:34] when someone teaches a heresy that
[1:05:35] proves they're not elect
[1:05:40] and they can be all clean on the outside
[1:05:42] and rich and all kinds of money
[1:05:45] 100 million dollars they can all kinds
[1:05:47] of things that don't mean nothing to god
[1:05:51] sometimes satan gives those blessings
[1:05:52] now we know that dude
[1:05:54] all right
[1:05:55] now
[1:05:56] in the sermon five identification of the
[1:05:58] true church i preached this over there
[1:06:00] and that's when sister marie got healed
[1:06:01] from her bleeding
[1:06:04] preached the sermon brother over there a
[1:06:05] few years ago probably five years ago
[1:06:07] now a sister came in i didn't know she
[1:06:09] had bleeding problem i preached this i
[1:06:10] said anyone need prayer i said one of
[1:06:12] our identifications is power of the holy
[1:06:14] ghost
[1:06:15] and she said while i prayed for her she
[1:06:17] felt the blood the bleeding dry up in
[1:06:19] her body
[1:06:20] but in this sermon
[1:06:22] brother man says
[1:06:24] okay let's read galatians 3 26.
[1:06:27] if anybody gets it before i do read it
[1:06:29] go ahead and a sister starts reading it
[1:06:32] he said i said you can listen to it on
[1:06:33] the tape
[1:06:35] for all we're all children of god in
[1:06:36] christ jesus oh he said maybe i got it
[1:06:38] crossed up now let's see he says
[1:06:40] now here here i got it that's right read
[1:06:42] on sister
[1:06:44] he lets the sister read the verse right
[1:06:45] during the sermon
[1:06:48] now listen close then she reads it again
[1:06:51] and he just goes on now you won't find
[1:06:53] many of these but brother ram never shut
[1:06:55] it down
[1:06:56] he never came back and apologized and
[1:06:58] said it was wrong
[1:07:01] right i've been to a message church
[1:07:03] where they let sisters pray for the
[1:07:05] prayer request
[1:07:06] now they got to pray for from their seat
[1:07:09] but that was one thing i've never seen
[1:07:10] before
[1:07:12] i still don't know what i think about
[1:07:13] that but but that was just interesting
[1:07:15] it was numerous years ago by now
[1:07:18] and the pastor must be taking these kind
[1:07:20] of quotes like
[1:07:22] like this one but iran says this is
[1:07:25] again church
[1:07:26] ages someone wanted to know if it was
[1:07:28] wrong for women to testify or sing or
[1:07:30] give message and tongue interpret
[1:07:32] tongues
[1:07:34] or prophecy in the church no it isn't
[1:07:35] wrong as long as it comes in the place
[1:07:37] and order
[1:07:39] the church is in order the real true way
[1:07:41] to do it is uh speak with tons of things
[1:07:43] the message you're given before the
[1:07:45] message from the pulpit never during
[1:07:47] that time
[1:07:48] in other words while the holy ghost is
[1:07:50] ministering through me everybody else
[1:07:52] should hold back whatever they got but
[1:07:54] once i'm done then they can let their
[1:07:55] message go
[1:07:57] because it's meant to be a vindication
[1:07:58] of what was already preached
[1:08:00] or a discerning of something that we
[1:08:02] need help with
[1:08:04] in the midst
[1:08:06] right but see now look
[1:08:09] but women are gifted everybody say women
[1:08:11] are gifted ready women are
[1:08:13] how many times have i preached that i'm
[1:08:14] going to keep preaching that you sisters
[1:08:16] have gifts that we don't have as
[1:08:18] brothers
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:21] and you've got to invest in the gifts
[1:08:22] just like i've got to vest in my gift
[1:08:25] right you have gifts from god there's my
[1:08:27] hour so give me 15 minutes i usually say
[1:08:28] that and give me 15 more minutes
[1:08:31] you sisters have gifts with prophecy
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:34] tongues and everything but being a
[1:08:37] preacher
[1:08:40] i've seen a woman cast out a devil out
[1:08:42] of a man when i first come in the
[1:08:43] message now the sad part is 10 years
[1:08:45] later she's at cedar point and simon saw
[1:08:46] her wearing shorts
[1:08:48] and that really shook me i'm like how
[1:08:50] can this woman cast out a demon
[1:08:52] she can i've seen her sing in the spirit
[1:08:54] shout cry in the spirit
[1:08:56] song specials in the holy ghost people
[1:08:58] crying weeping praise the lord and yet
[1:09:00] 10 years later wear pants at cedar point
[1:09:03] and cast out devils it just proves the
[1:09:05] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:09:10] because i don't go walk around cedar
[1:09:11] point with a long skirt on and a woman's
[1:09:13] undergarments on
[1:09:16] do i
[1:09:18] well how can she can do it but we can't
[1:09:21] we would never want to but don't you
[1:09:22] understand
[1:09:23] what
[1:09:24] how is that okay
[1:09:25] and she still plays church she just
[1:09:28] still plays piano or organ for a church
[1:09:30] to this day
[1:09:31] to this day
[1:09:35] that proved to me too when god wants to
[1:09:37] cast the devil out
[1:09:39] he'll have me ready for it praise god
[1:09:41] because anybody can do it they just got
[1:09:43] to be under the anointing and it's got
[1:09:44] to be god's time in season
[1:09:49] but women are
[1:09:51] gifted with
[1:09:52] everything but being preachers
[1:09:56] that's right
[1:09:58] they're not preachers they're forbidden
[1:09:59] to preach in the church that's right
[1:10:00] take the place or be a teacher anything
[1:10:01] in the church but as far as gifts the
[1:10:03] women has all everybody say oh all
[1:10:06] those can occupy one or any of those
[1:10:09] nine spiritual gifts according to first
[1:10:10] corinthians 12 and it's under no bondage
[1:10:13] that her message should not come forth
[1:10:15] in its place
[1:10:16] you see each message waits for its time
[1:10:19] we are not trying to chain up the
[1:10:21] sisters and say you can't prophesy
[1:10:24] you can't give a word of knowledge
[1:10:26] we're not trying to chain them we're
[1:10:27] trying to set them free
[1:10:29] hopefully you already are free but i'm
[1:10:30] just saying if you're chained up we're
[1:10:32] here to set you free tonight to hear
[1:10:34] today by the grace of god you can do
[1:10:36] everything but it's got to be in its
[1:10:38] place
[1:10:40] it's got to be at its time
[1:10:42] and the right spirit
[1:10:46] now he just he talks about the the gifts
[1:10:48] that he says
[1:10:50] it's always an order but a woman does
[1:10:52] have the right just like those daughters
[1:10:54] of zelophehad they had the right to say
[1:10:56] give me my inheritance
[1:10:59] my dad had no sons so we daughters we
[1:11:02] get to inherit our father's
[1:11:04] uh heir we're heirs of our father give
[1:11:07] us the land from our father and the holy
[1:11:09] ghost said there it is you got it
[1:11:11] there you got tongues you got
[1:11:13] interpretation you got miracles you got
[1:11:15] casting out devils you got discernment
[1:11:17] you got all that land enjoy sisters and
[1:11:20] everybody shouted
[1:11:22] amen there you go
[1:11:24] praise god the sisters might have a land
[1:11:26] or gift that we don't know nothing about
[1:11:28] brothers
[1:11:34] don't worry sisters you have the right
[1:11:37] in this church you have the right it
[1:11:38] just comes the right order
[1:11:43] so in my book page 687 if anyone's
[1:11:46] looking
[1:11:51] you know i really like writing these you
[1:11:52] know i like writing these days like this
[1:11:54] i can i already know where i got it i
[1:11:55] can just go right to it
[1:11:57] i don't gotta dig through my computer
[1:11:58] where is that what what's the name of
[1:12:00] that file i know right where it is
[1:12:03] a word of wisdom
[1:12:09] is the chief gift because it operates
[1:12:11] all the others brother i'm taught that
[1:12:18] wisdom is also sound advice in the greek
[1:12:22] and it manifests skill and
[1:12:24] discretion and timely decision making
[1:12:27] wisdom is validated by the results it
[1:12:29] bears because jesus says wisdom is
[1:12:30] justified of her children
[1:12:34] so you look at what happens after you
[1:12:36] make a decision and if the results are
[1:12:38] golly then you had the gift you had the
[1:12:40] word of wisdom for that decision
[1:12:42] like a good example with amen and huh
[1:12:44] they want the wisdom of god when to move
[1:12:45] out
[1:12:46] see they're waiting on that word of
[1:12:48] wisdom see that's that's good you don't
[1:12:50] want to try to do it on your own you
[1:12:51] don't want to try to press your way into
[1:12:52] something right
[1:12:54] that's a big decision when you move
[1:12:58] the bible said wisdom has built in her
[1:13:00] house
[1:13:04] so a sister okay i got a little word
[1:13:07] wisdom for you brother this is how you
[1:13:08] should build this and that and this is
[1:13:10] the time you should do it
[1:13:12] which one of your brothers would like
[1:13:13] that
[1:13:15] you see
[1:13:16] that's what it is it's a word of wisdom
[1:13:19] that wouldn't be behind the pulpit
[1:13:21] it would be
[1:13:22] out somewhere in the audience or out
[1:13:26] yeah a pastor was telling me that
[1:13:28] another pastor was rebuking him for
[1:13:30] the the sports he let his children do
[1:13:32] and i gave him a word i said just don't
[1:13:34] let it interrupt sundays
[1:13:36] and wednesday nights and you can do it
[1:13:37] he said brother that was a word of
[1:13:39] wisdom
[1:13:40] i said well thank you i didn't go look
[1:13:41] at i didn't go looking for a word of
[1:13:42] wisdom i just told them what the holy
[1:13:43] ghost showed me
[1:13:46] and then i gave another brother word of
[1:13:48] wisdom because he said he had just
[1:13:49] decided to give up his ministry and i
[1:13:51] come in there and i preach i remember
[1:13:52] the message i preached on diligence and
[1:13:54] i preached i said don't give up keep
[1:13:56] investing you gotta do small little
[1:13:57] investments to get the major uh return
[1:13:59] at the end and he said he said that was
[1:14:01] a word of wisdom it turned him around
[1:14:02] back into the ministry
[1:14:06] because it's small little investments a
[1:14:07] little bit every day
[1:14:08] yields a huge return later
[1:14:11] that's what this book is this is this is
[1:14:13] how many this is two and a half years of
[1:14:14] a little bit every day just an hour a
[1:14:16] day two hours a day praying writing
[1:14:19] studying the scripture
[1:14:21] okay word of knowledge
[1:14:23] knowledge is your raw building materials
[1:14:25] to build the house
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:28] and wisdom and knowledge are always
[1:14:30] associated together
[1:14:32] jesus also calls knowledge a key that
[1:14:34] allows you to enter in the door of
[1:14:36] salvation
[1:14:38] or god's will for your life
[1:14:40] in other words knowledge is an
[1:14:41] understanding to possess god's promises
[1:14:44] and escape satan's devices to enter into
[1:14:46] the promise of god
[1:14:49] and it'll always be a bible-based
[1:14:51] knowledge
[1:14:52] now here's people confuse knowledge with
[1:14:54] discernment discernment is the one that
[1:14:56] judges the secrets and thoughts and
[1:14:58] tense of the heart the sermon is the one
[1:15:00] that tells you the secrets knowledge is
[1:15:02] just simple bible knowledge that you
[1:15:03] should know
[1:15:04] but you maybe don't know it forgot
[1:15:07] knowledge is the word it's the key that
[1:15:10] opens the door oh now i understand it
[1:15:13] because knowledge is the key to
[1:15:14] understanding
[1:15:15] that's what the greek says
[1:15:17] wisdom is okay here's the word now
[1:15:19] here's when you use that
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:22] that's right
[1:15:25] so brothers how much how many would like
[1:15:26] a sister come up and say well brother
[1:15:28] you're struggling with this but here's a
[1:15:29] scripture here's a scripture that would
[1:15:30] help you out
[1:15:33] really you brothers are like that
[1:15:35] praise the lord your real brothers
[1:15:38] you're a real brother to your sisters
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:42] and the example was
[1:15:45] well for me i saw a piece of paper that
[1:15:48] said first corinthians 6 12.
[1:15:52] and that opened the door to my
[1:15:53] deliverance from tobacco it says
[1:15:56] all things are lawful but not all things
[1:15:58] are expedient but i will not be brought
[1:16:00] under the power of any when i saw that
[1:16:01] scripture it unlocked a door in my mind
[1:16:04] wow
[1:16:05] my body could chew tobacco but i don't i
[1:16:07] shouldn't be a slave to it
[1:16:10] and that as soon as i saw that it
[1:16:12] unlocked and now i can know now i can
[1:16:14] enter into deliverance
[1:16:16] that's the god honest truth
[1:16:18] i never realized i could be free from
[1:16:20] that until i saw that scripture that
[1:16:22] unlocked the the door to me
[1:16:25] the other example was uh
[1:16:28] a brother was struggling there was a in
[1:16:30] fact
[1:16:32] remember that brother wrote that a legit
[1:16:33] paper that died i told you remember that
[1:16:36] he called himself alive and they died
[1:16:38] cancer remember that a few months ago
[1:16:40] that same man was in a church and he was
[1:16:42] criticizing a deacon because he being
[1:16:44] both deaconess deacon and evangelist
[1:16:47] he's saying you can't do that brother
[1:16:49] said you can't fix the offices this man
[1:16:50] is he's always had that evil spirit on
[1:16:52] him as far as we've known him
[1:16:53] of course he's
[1:16:55] but he called me up crying he's like
[1:16:57] brother jesse can i be both a evangelist
[1:16:59] and a deacon
[1:17:01] and i hung up the phone i said honey
[1:17:03] yeah he was just sharing about
[1:17:04] evangelist and my wife told me the exact
[1:17:06] scripture she just read it or something
[1:17:07] you have to ask her i get the detail
[1:17:09] mixed up but she said philip was both a
[1:17:12] deacon and an evangelist
[1:17:14] i called the brother right up and he
[1:17:15] started weeping and crying said thank
[1:17:16] you i'm now free from that
[1:17:18] demon-possessed man who's he's he's
[1:17:20] basically cursing the whole church
[1:17:22] and he died that way it was so sad
[1:17:25] but that was a pure that was a pure word
[1:17:28] of knowledge i can say came through my
[1:17:30] wife through me to help the preacher and
[1:17:32] he's grateful for it
[1:17:33] and to open the door no more torment
[1:17:35] from satan amen satan i'm leaving the
[1:17:38] torment behind i'm entering into the
[1:17:39] blessings of the lord
[1:17:41] that's what knowledge does knowledge is
[1:17:43] a key it opens a door of victory amen
[1:17:46] opens the door of deliverance praise god
[1:17:48] and wisdom is justified by the results
[1:17:51] that it bears amen
[1:17:53] through the key of knowledge
[1:17:56] go to acts 18. i'm trying to close but i
[1:17:58] wish i could close bar pulling
[1:18:00] see you got to stop pulling if you want
[1:18:01] me to stop
[1:18:04] start falling asleep on me then i'll
[1:18:05] stop after that
[1:18:07] no i'm just kidding
[1:18:08] acts 18 26. now i like when you pull you
[1:18:10] that's good that's great that's what we
[1:18:12] need praise god
[1:18:14] acts 18 26
[1:18:16] i never thought about this until i was
[1:18:18] meditating in this on wednesday
[1:18:20] it's quite possible priscilla gave
[1:18:22] apollos
[1:18:24] a word of knowledge or word of wisdom or
[1:18:26] maybe even a discernment of spirit
[1:18:28] look what the bible says
[1:18:31] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:18:33] synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla
[1:18:35] had heard they took
[1:18:37] him unto them and expounded unto him the
[1:18:40] way of god more perfectly
[1:18:43] day day
[1:18:45] how could they
[1:18:46] man and woman tell a preacher a baptist
[1:18:49] preacher mind you
[1:18:51] like you saw
[1:18:52] today how could they
[1:18:55] expound the word of god more perfectly
[1:18:56] if women aren't allowed to talk
[1:18:59] well women are allowed to talk
[1:19:00] as long as they got it right in their
[1:19:02] place
[1:19:04] brother braham dramatized it like this
[1:19:06] he said uh aquila priscilla came in they
[1:19:09] sat they listened to brother apollo's
[1:19:11] message he said i really like that
[1:19:12] baptist preaching
[1:19:13] that was pretty good message he said but
[1:19:15] come let's have a meal but man so they
[1:19:16] went and had a meal
[1:19:18] and they said carlos we liked your
[1:19:20] message
[1:19:21] but there's one that's going to come
[1:19:23] after us paul's on his way here and he's
[1:19:25] going to take you deeper in the word of
[1:19:27] god there's more than john's baptism
[1:19:29] there's more than repentance there's one
[1:19:31] coming after john who's mightier than
[1:19:33] him it's christ jesus the holy ghost and
[1:19:36] paul is going to come and preach to you
[1:19:37] the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:19:39] brother said that's what aquila and
[1:19:41] priscilla told apollos
[1:19:45] so our sister said there's there's a
[1:19:47] more excellent way brother what was she
[1:19:49] doing the word of knowledge
[1:19:51] amen what's that the holy ghost is for
[1:19:53] the revelation of the word right
[1:19:55] word of knowledge paul's coming maybe
[1:19:57] it's a prophecy too paul's coming he's
[1:19:59] coming here to give you thus saith the
[1:20:01] lord he's coming here to baptize you
[1:20:02] with the holy ghost and god used a man
[1:20:05] and a woman amen
[1:20:07] not behind the pulpit but in fellowship
[1:20:09] and communion
[1:20:12] to expound unto apollos the way of god
[1:20:14] more perfectly
[1:20:18] just like the woman at the well
[1:20:19] she run down there and said come see a
[1:20:21] man like brother dixon
[1:20:23] he runs across him come see a man who
[1:20:26] told me all the things that i did isn't
[1:20:28] this the messiah amen
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:34] the bible said she could tell her
[1:20:35] testimony well he did this he told me
[1:20:37] that he did that then he said that and
[1:20:38] it was the messiah
[1:20:40] praise god
[1:20:43] so we see the same thing here
[1:20:45] they can speak and as much as they want
[1:20:47] as long as it's the word of god
[1:20:49] just not behind the pulpit
[1:20:52] and titus 2 verse 4 says elder women can
[1:20:55] teach the younger
[1:20:57] now some people take this little further
[1:20:58] than others
[1:21:00] like the denominations will have women
[1:21:02] actually preaching to the other women
[1:21:03] now that i don't think they should do
[1:21:04] that
[1:21:05] they actually get women behind the
[1:21:06] pulpit to preach to the other one i
[1:21:08] don't think that's the right thing to do
[1:21:09] if you go to go to titus 2 it makes it
[1:21:11] seem pretty simple
[1:21:14] what i've had this has been years ago
[1:21:15] when we were at
[1:21:17] not the previous we're not waterloo but
[1:21:18] the mo drive when we were at mo drive i
[1:21:20] had elder sisters
[1:21:23] come in and just have give a testimony
[1:21:24] service for all of our mothers and
[1:21:26] sisters
[1:21:27] that was i just thought well if they
[1:21:28] could if they can catch something if the
[1:21:30] if they're really hungry they can pull
[1:21:31] something out of that testimony
[1:21:33] so it's been years since we've had that
[1:21:35] but i think the last one we had here was
[1:21:36] sister kim browning i think was here
[1:21:39] years ago she did that
[1:21:40] titus
[1:21:47] all right i'm going to get there right
[1:21:48] before hebrews titus 2 verse let's read
[1:21:51] three
[1:21:51] they age women likewise that they
[1:21:53] behaviors becometh holiness not false
[1:21:55] accusers not given to much wine teachers
[1:21:57] of good things
[1:21:59] that they may teach the young women to
[1:22:00] be sober to love their husbands
[1:22:03] to love their children now look at this
[1:22:04] look they have a lot to teach look at
[1:22:05] this church
[1:22:07] verse 5 to be discreet chaste keepers at
[1:22:09] home
[1:22:11] good obedient to their own husbands that
[1:22:13] the word of god be not blasphemed
[1:22:17] so the holy ghost teaching of an older
[1:22:19] woman can teach or can keep younger
[1:22:22] women from blaspheming the holy ghost
[1:22:25] and that's something
[1:22:29] so i'll just say like this our younger
[1:22:30] sisters if you have any questions i'd
[1:22:32] recommend contacting the elder sisters
[1:22:35] talk to them after service now pray
[1:22:36] beforehand right pray beforehand
[1:22:39] and then go with a meek and humble
[1:22:40] attitude say could i sit down with you
[1:22:41] can we do lunch or something or can we
[1:22:43] talk for a little bit i just can pray
[1:22:45] about it you know i like questions
[1:22:46] beforehand um
[1:22:49] so this doesn't look like it's in the
[1:22:51] the church setting right
[1:22:53] how do i love my husband how do i love
[1:22:54] my children
[1:22:56] how do i keep the home those are things
[1:22:57] that wouldn't seem like i could be
[1:22:59] behind the pulpit it wouldn't be a woman
[1:23:00] preaching at women
[1:23:02] right i can't see that there's my 15
[1:23:03] minutes
[1:23:08] so can anybody understand that
[1:23:10] says look are the boundaries
[1:23:13] are the boundaries all the same no no no
[1:23:16] some women can speak more than others
[1:23:17] because they have prophecy
[1:23:20] discernment
[1:23:22] right i've seen discernment on our
[1:23:23] sister karen sanders from lima that was
[1:23:25] beautiful
[1:23:27] prophecy i've seen prophecy out of her
[1:23:29] you know we have all these sisters can
[1:23:30] speak just not at the pulpit
[1:23:34] and you have a right to do it amen
[1:23:37] you have a right to invest in your gifts
[1:23:38] amen praise god
[1:23:41] christ is not chaining you up christ is
[1:23:43] setting you free praise god
[1:23:47] last one brother random are women
[1:23:48] allowed to work in public affairs when
[1:23:50] they already have a healthy husband
[1:23:51] children well i don't know about that i
[1:23:53] can't say but i have this feeling let me
[1:23:55] say i believe if i was a woman and know
[1:23:56] my husband was healthy at a good job i
[1:23:58] believe it would be a great pleasure for
[1:23:59] me to stay at home take care of my
[1:24:00] children and take care of the children
[1:24:02] raise them up love the lord and if i had
[1:24:03] any time away from my washington things
[1:24:05] i was going to do i think i would teach
[1:24:06] my children how to serve the lord now if
[1:24:08] you've got a debt or something that
[1:24:10] you're trying to help your husband pay
[1:24:11] or something something that you have to
[1:24:12] do well i think that's fine if you'll
[1:24:14] try to help him and you live a you live
[1:24:16] a lady
[1:24:17] i think it's hard now no no man that's
[1:24:20] got a good understanding wants his wife
[1:24:21] to get a bunch where there's a bunch of
[1:24:23] vulgar dirty men and things like that
[1:24:24] but the woman has to get into that i
[1:24:26] think she ought to her husband ought to
[1:24:27] know that she's a genuine christian
[1:24:29] woman that she can be trusted a
[1:24:30] trustworthy woman
[1:24:32] now to say that she shouldn't work i
[1:24:33] don't know see there's no scripture to
[1:24:35] back that up i'm just passing that
[1:24:37] opinion but i think that if a woman
[1:24:38] wants to work and she wants to now i'm
[1:24:40] certainly against these women working
[1:24:42] these offices where all these
[1:24:43] businessmen they carry on tell the dirty
[1:24:45] jokes
[1:24:46] look at all these governors falling
[1:24:47] they're all they're all raping these
[1:24:49] women basically
[1:24:51] see when you get women in there they're
[1:24:52] not married to the man it always causes
[1:24:54] trouble
[1:24:55] women and men alone in offices and it's
[1:24:57] it's always causing trouble
[1:25:01] a nice clean woman sitting there and all
[1:25:03] these smutty dirty things told like i'm
[1:25:04] against that i think you ought to come
[1:25:06] out from amongst such stuff as that
[1:25:09] but if a woman can hold herself as a
[1:25:11] real lady trying to help her husband do
[1:25:13] something to meet some clothes for the
[1:25:14] kids or go to school or pay a bill
[1:25:16] if she wants to do work till that's over
[1:25:18] now this is not the lord because i don't
[1:25:19] have no scripture for this i'm just
[1:25:21] saying that be my opinion but otherwise
[1:25:22] i wouldn't think just because she wants
[1:25:24] to work just to run around and have more
[1:25:26] money to spend or or no run to bar rooms
[1:25:29] and drink and smoke and carry on i don't
[1:25:30] think she should do it i think she
[1:25:32] should stay at home try to be a lady and
[1:25:34] take care of the house
[1:25:35] god knows we need more women like that
[1:25:37] today when womanhood is broke the
[1:25:39] backbone of the nation is broke when
[1:25:41] women get to a place that our american
[1:25:43] women are today it's a disgrace the way
[1:25:45] our american women act i got a clipping
[1:25:47] out of the paper 60 percent of the boys
[1:25:49] that went overseas last war divorce from
[1:25:51] their wives before they come back their
[1:25:52] wives run off with someone else
[1:25:54] in those defense plants working look at
[1:25:56] that
[1:25:58] she's got no business in the defense
[1:26:00] plan see because there's too many men
[1:26:01] there dirty dirty smutty men right
[1:26:03] you gotta be very careful where the holy
[1:26:05] ghost leads you to work
[1:26:07] a woman's place is at home with her
[1:26:08] children and now if her husband's sick
[1:26:10] and she has to work that's different
[1:26:11] when a woman's place is at home in the
[1:26:13] kitchen when she leaves that she's out
[1:26:14] of her place exactly right let's stand
[1:26:16] to our feet here and you can stop the
[1:26:18] live stream i'm gonna say a few things
[1:26:18] musicians can come
