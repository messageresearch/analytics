[0:11] Amen. And we just love him. Amen. We're
[0:13] just a a small church in the same area.
[0:15] I'm very comfortable. Amen. Here. Amen.
[0:18] We started in a house with our family
[0:20] and one couple. Amen. And and God bless
[0:23] us with a church building and we might
[0:25] be 40 or 50 now. 50 if we were really
[0:28] full. and and uh Amen. God's not in
[0:30] numbers, he's in character. Amen. Every
[0:33] place God preached was character. Amen.
[0:35] God preached in the houses. Amen. In the
[0:38] New Testament. Amen. And we just love
[0:40] him for that. Amen. And we we're uh
[0:43] we're parents of six children, six
[0:46] grandchildren, some on the way. Half
[0:49] over half our children are married. And
[0:51] and so life goes by fast. Amen. Amen.
[0:55] But we love him and and we're just
[0:57] privileged to to get the greatest thrill
[0:59] you'll have outside of salvation is get
[1:02] to meet the rest of the body of Christ
[1:04] here. Here here because we're going to
[1:07] be over there for all of eternity. Amen.
[1:10] And if you get to meet your brothers and
[1:12] sisters here, you're greatly blessed.
[1:15] That's the greatest one of the greatest
[1:16] blessings of going to the mission field.
[1:19] Get to meet the brothers and sisters
[1:20] that you'll spend all of eternity
[1:23] &gt;&gt; with. Amen. Get to meet them. Let's
[1:24] stand as we read the word of God. It's
[1:27] just a great privilege. We had amazing
[1:29] fellowship with you, pastor. We're going
[1:31] to turn to Revelations 1:1.
[1:36] Amen.
[1:38] We're going to read one scripture out of
[1:40] Revelations and one out of Job. The
[1:42] revelation of the Jesus Christ, which
[1:44] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:47] servants the things which must shortly
[1:50] come to pass. and he signified it by his
[1:53] angel unto his servant John. And let's
[1:57] turn over to Job
[1:59] 1 and6.
[2:03] Amen. By God's grace, we're going to
[2:04] talk about Job some today. And if God
[2:07] don't change it, we're going to talk
[2:08] about David this afternoon.
[2:11] Amen.
[2:13] Job 1:6. And now and there there was a
[2:16] day when the sons of God came in the
[2:20] presence themselves
[2:22] before the Lord
[2:25] and Satan
[2:28] was amongst them. Lord Jesus, we pray
[2:31] that you'll come and Lord, we're we're
[2:33] here to serve you and to bless your
[2:35] bride. Lord God, there's no other motive
[2:37] in our heart. And Lord, we pray that you
[2:40] will bless and encourage the pastor and
[2:42] this local assembly. And Lord, may we
[2:44] grow in a relationship that will last
[2:46] for all of eternity. For we know that we
[2:48] were always together in you, Lord God.
[2:51] And this is just a reuniting on this
[2:53] earth until we meet again on the other
[2:55] side, Lord God. And so I pray that you
[2:57] will be blessed and we welcome you and
[3:00] this beautiful place, Lord God. We
[3:02] welcome your Holy Spirit. Take complete
[3:04] control of everything that's said and
[3:06] done, Lord God. And may you bless your
[3:08] bride here. Not be with the home church
[3:11] back home and bless them, Lord Jesus.
[3:13] also as junior ministers to them and be
[3:16] with your bride around the world. We
[3:18] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may
[3:21] have your seats. I want to just share
[3:22] something with you. You know our prophet
[3:24] said that Satan can imitate every gift
[3:27] of God. He can imitate every
[3:29] manifestations of God. And Satan also
[3:32] believes the word
[3:33] &gt;&gt; and trembles.
[3:36] But Satan can't do one thing and that's
[3:39] love.
[3:41] That's the only thing Satan cannot do.
[3:43] So if you want to see the manifestations
[3:45] of God in a believer's life, can they
[3:48] love?
[3:50] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that Satan can't
[3:52] do. Satan loves this. Sorry. Satan
[3:55] understands and believes this message
[3:57] but trembles at it. He can't believe it
[4:00] &gt;&gt; but he can't love. Amen. And we want to
[4:03] look into this. You know, you know,
[4:04] Brother Bram said that the greatest
[4:06] thing that Satan hates is revelation.
[4:09] And you need to understand where who you
[4:12] are. You need to understand your
[4:14] placing. We're going to talk about
[4:15] placing an election this morning. And if
[4:17] you ever come to who you are in Christ,
[4:20] you you're going to not only lose your
[4:22] mind, but you'll leave this place. Amen.
[4:25] Because of what God sees in yourself,
[4:27] the bride. Amen. And and so sat the
[4:30] greatest thing that Satan hates. Here
[4:32] the prophet says the true revelation of
[4:34] the true church, that's what she stands
[4:36] on. And she can do the greater works.
[4:38] And Satan is trying to do everything he
[4:41] can to hide it from you. He's showing
[4:44] you badger skin. He's showing you flesh.
[4:47] The prophet said, "Don't look at the
[4:49] clay. Look at the message. Look at the
[4:52] spirit and the message." The clay will
[4:55] fail all the time.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; But look at the spirit. Look at the
[4:59] message. Amen. And so Satan's trying to
[5:02] get us to stumble
[5:04] because we see the badger skin here. The
[5:08] prophet said in just laying a
[5:09] foundation, he said, "I've always said
[5:11] you don't know who you are. A man is
[5:14] sitting beside you is the son of God."
[5:17] Amen. The woman sitting beside you is
[5:19] the daughter of God. And if you
[5:21] recognize when you come into this
[5:22] fellowship that you are going to meet
[5:24] Jehovah sitting on your pew this
[5:27] morning, I wonder if you would have
[5:28] dressed differently. I wonder if you
[5:30] would have came on time.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if we would act different
[5:34] if we catch the revelation in our day.
[5:37] Amen.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's sitting beside you and we're
[5:41] sitting in heavenly places
[5:43] &gt;&gt; right now. We don't have to wait till we
[5:45] get to the millennium.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; We're already in those places in Christ
[5:50] Jesus. You know, it takes the same power
[5:53] to believe in faith
[5:56] as it does fear
[5:58] because they're both on scene.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; But what you choose will identify
[6:04] who you are. Yes, sir.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; That we look in this scripture here and
[6:08] this amazing part that we see in Job
[6:10] that the sons of God came before the
[6:12] Lord Jesus
[6:15] &gt;&gt; and Satan came there with them.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Now that that that's amazing and
[6:20] peculiar to me. That's actually twice in
[6:22] Job. It's actually in the second chapter
[6:24] also. And here we see you know the story
[6:28] of Job here where God Satan came and he
[6:31] said, "Well, have you ever considered my
[6:33] bride here?" in this area. Have you ever
[6:36] considered my servant Job? And he said,
[6:38] "Oh my God, God, you're not playing
[6:40] fair.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; These children came out of you. They're
[6:45] controlled by you. You built a hedge
[6:47] about them. You've given them their Holy
[6:50] Spirit.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; But if you'd ever let me get in their
[6:52] inner part, I would tear him apart."
[6:56] &gt;&gt; And God says, "Okay."
[6:59] Can you imagine the confidence God had
[7:01] in Job? Imagine the confidence God has
[7:05] in his
[7:05] &gt;&gt; bride.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God, you know the story,
[7:10] God sent all these uh discouragements to
[7:12] Job and took everything he had and and
[7:15] all these things. Amen. And Job had some
[7:17] friends.
[7:18] Now, with friends like that, you
[7:20] wouldn't need many enemies.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; But you know, they came to uh you know,
[7:26] so many people, you know, I want to show
[7:28] you something here. You know, when the
[7:29] woman was caught in the very act of
[7:31] adultery and they brought her to Christ,
[7:35] the believers there, the Pharisees were
[7:37] looking at her faults and they said,
[7:39] "The very Bible that we're reading
[7:42] requires you to stone her."
[7:44] &gt;&gt; But Jesus was looking at election.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he was looking at election when
[7:50] he looked at me.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was looking at election.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we see these friends came
[7:57] of Job and they were condemning Job and
[7:59] their wrath was kindled against Job
[8:02] because Job in their in their eyes was
[8:05] was was making himself self-righteous.
[8:07] And they said, "Oh, you've had to have
[8:09] sinned. You've had to have fall because
[8:11] there's no way that God would choose and
[8:14] give you this plate to the bride.
[8:16] There's no way." They never understood
[8:19] God. Amen.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; They never understood him at all. And
[8:22] even his wife said, "You should curse
[8:24] God and die." And Job said, "You speak
[8:27] like a foolish woman." And all these
[8:29] people, you know, there's many voices
[8:31] today. We're living in a world that's
[8:33] just rather voices.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Be careful with those voices.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Be very careful.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You look who look who is behind
[8:43] those voices. Look who was behind
[8:45] technology.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Those voices.
[8:49] Amen.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; It was Satan.
[8:54] that most technology is to make the
[8:57] bride fall.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Even our prophet said television, God
[9:01] could have used it for great glory, but
[9:03] Satan took it and twisted it
[9:05] &gt;&gt; and much more today. Oh boy, that's the
[9:09] internet. But to be so careful, but we
[9:12] see God let the church, he let Job's
[9:15] friends have their say. And then let's
[9:18] turn to Job 38
[9:20] here. Everybody's had their opinion of
[9:24] the bride of Christ. Everybody's had
[9:26] their opinion of the church. Everybody's
[9:29] been looking at you and say, "Who is
[9:31] worried about this little bride here
[9:33] gathered today? Why they're so so
[9:36] insignificant?
[9:38] God, let everybody have their say."
[9:42] And then God came on the scene
[9:46] in Job 38. And let's just read that a
[9:49] few verses here. 1-6. And the Lord
[9:52] answered Job out of a whirlwind.
[9:55] And said, "Who is this that darkened
[10:00] counsel by words without
[10:04] knowledge?"
[10:06] &gt;&gt; God had a very low opinion of Job's
[10:08] friends.
[10:10] Gird up now your loins like a man. This
[10:13] is God. Make this personal this morning.
[10:15] Gird up your loins as a man. I'm trying
[10:17] to place you where you belong. For I
[10:21] will, here's God demanding of Job. He
[10:23] said, now I will demand of you and
[10:26] answer thou ye me.
[10:29] Where's thou when I laid the foundation
[10:32] of the world? God's demanding that
[10:35] answer of Job. And I want to tell you
[10:37] this morning, God's demanding that of
[10:39] every one of us. He said, "Declare it
[10:42] unto me if thou has understanding.
[10:46] Who hast laid the foundations thereof,
[10:49] if thou knowest, and who has stretched
[10:52] the line
[10:54] upon it?
[10:57] Whereupon are the foundations there on
[10:59] facet? Here God was demanding of Job,
[11:03] who
[11:04] are you?
[11:07] &gt;&gt; I believe this morning that God's
[11:08] demanding of us, who
[11:11] are you?
[11:14] You need to recognize who you are. And
[11:17] when you recognize your position in
[11:19] Christ, Satan will have absolutely zero
[11:23] zero power over you.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; If you don't think so, how much power
[11:32] does Satan have over God?
[11:35] None. If you recognize
[11:38] where you came from, see, we're not
[11:41] we're not worshiping as a church this
[11:44] morning. Even though we're gathered as a
[11:45] fellowship, and we're not in a
[11:47] denomination,
[11:49] &gt;&gt; but we're in a family.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; And in a family, everyone's related.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we're related.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Me and your pastor, we were together
[12:03] before the foundation of the world.
[12:06] We were together with you before. You
[12:08] say, "But I don't remember." But God
[12:11] says, "I'm declaring of you."
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Where were you? Watch what our prophet
[12:16] says about this. He says, "One of the
[12:17] saddest and most illegitimate things
[12:19] that was ever created." And the most
[12:21] ungodly thing is a mule.
[12:25] He don't know where he come from. He
[12:27] don't know who his daddy is, his father.
[12:30] He don't know. He'll wait his whole life
[12:32] to kick you.
[12:34] That's what the prophet says.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; But they are great workers.
[12:40] If you want to have soup suppers,
[12:42] basketball team and a volleyball team
[12:44] and a baseball team, they're great
[12:45] workers. If you want to have programs
[12:47] and agendas, oh, they'll build churches,
[12:49] put gold on the steeple.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; They'll give everything they got because
[12:54] they know how to work,
[12:57] &gt;&gt; but they don't know where they came
[12:58] from.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; They don't know who their daddy is.
[13:02] Hallelujah.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; But then there's something else.
[13:08] Is a son or daughter of God
[13:10] who's living a million miles below the
[13:13] recognized privileges
[13:15] &gt;&gt; because they're in a cage at the zoo
[13:18] like the eagle that the prophet went
[13:21] with his family. And he said he was born
[13:24] a heavenly bird. He was born to be in
[13:28] the heavens.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; But because
[13:33] of men. Watch that church.
[13:37] But because of men, there is no fear in
[13:40] love.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; This ain't a law that we're worshiping.
[13:45] We're worshiping a person
[13:48] &gt;&gt; of Jehovah.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; This ain't about dues and the letter
[13:52] kleth, but the spirit give life. This is
[13:55] a body. This is a person. This is a
[13:58] family. This is a relationship.
[14:00] This is my husband.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; A zoo where you're locked up in a cage
[14:10] and you were made to be a heavenly bird.
[14:12] And here he said, "Sons and daughters of
[14:15] God that live below their privileges
[14:18] is the worst thing you'll ever see. Sons
[14:20] and daughters of God walk in the
[14:21] streets. They're born to soar in the
[14:24] heavenlies.
[14:27] They're born to be in the side. They're
[14:29] born for the great pleasure and power of
[14:31] God,
[14:32] &gt;&gt; but they're confined
[14:35] and in torment. A man of God that's
[14:37] living below his privileges, his soul is
[14:40] bound in a cage, tormented by Satan.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[14:49] We We don't want to We don't want to be
[14:51] in that. Freedom is everything.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom is everything. I mean,
[14:59] freedom in the flesh is everything. But
[15:01] think about the soul.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; It's freedom,
[15:06] &gt;&gt; man. We want our churches, we want our
[15:08] families free that God can move. The
[15:10] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[15:12] of the Lord.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this. He said, "Now
[15:21] I'll be with here." He says he gave a
[15:23] great blessing and promise to the church
[15:26] that I'll be with you and even in you to
[15:28] the end of the age and whatsoever you
[15:31] bind on earth I'll bind in heaven and
[15:34] whatsoever you loose on earth I'll loose
[15:37] in heaven you know the power in belief
[15:42] only believe the angel of the Lord loved
[15:45] that song only believe you know he's
[15:49] already paid the price for it All you
[15:52] have to do is take it.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; We, you know, you know, begging is, you
[15:57] know, we we portray this this God
[16:00] sometimes as we go to prayer and we beg
[16:02] you to heal me. Beg?
[16:06] That's not the God I serve. He's already
[16:09] healed me.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; I don't have to beg him. He's already
[16:12] given it to me. He said, "Just take it.
[16:14] It's already there." He said to to
[16:15] Moses, "Speak. Go forward. Why are you
[16:18] crying to me? I've already given to I've
[16:20] already placed you in authority.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said that deity
[16:26] does not abide alone and just in heaven
[16:30] but it's walking in the bride that's
[16:32] adopted and recognizes place. But you
[16:36] have to know your beginning to know your
[16:38] end.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's amazing when you
[16:42] recognize. Take the promises and believe
[16:44] them. So we see here in Genesis 1:26 and
[16:47] this is hands down my favorite scripture
[16:50] that when God said he said let us make
[16:52] man in our image. Now here in the
[16:54] beginning I was in God and I was a part
[16:56] of God and God God was was so
[16:59] considerate of his himself. He was
[17:02] omnipotent. He was all these things that
[17:04] he's asking me for permission to make me
[17:08] separate from him. God said let us who
[17:11] was the us. God was a self-existing one.
[17:15] Before there was God was only God
[17:17] because of worship. So before there was
[17:19] God was he was a self-existing spirit.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; So here's the spirit say let us. But
[17:24] who's he talking to? There's nobody
[17:25] around.
[17:28] He was talking to you and he was talking
[17:31] to me. He said let us make man in in our
[17:35] image and let him have dominion over the
[17:37] sea and the fowls of the air and the
[17:39] cattle and over all the fish of the sea.
[17:41] Uh, sorry. And all the earth and over
[17:43] every creeping thing on the earth. And
[17:45] God created man in his own image.
[17:48] That was you, brother and sister.
[17:51] Amen. If you're eternal this morning, if
[17:53] you're going to live in heaven, if
[17:54] you're going to have eternal life, you
[17:55] always were eternal. Anything that has
[17:58] no end never had a beginning.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to recognize your place.
[18:03] You know, it will almost get I don't
[18:05] mean in a way of arrogancy, but you
[18:07] know, you you don't have to. It's a It's
[18:10] knowing who you are. You're confident in
[18:12] your stand.
[18:14] Amen.
[18:17] So, God created man in his image. Now,
[18:20] this is a key part. I want to just step
[18:21] out of this. Forgive me, pastor. You
[18:23] know, if I if I happen to say something
[18:25] off of what your pastor, he has full
[18:26] authority. Amen. Your pastor, Brother
[18:30] Bram said, your pastor is ordained of
[18:31] God to lead you through. And he also
[18:34] said the pastor holds a doctrine for the
[18:36] church. I'm not here to fight your
[18:37] pastor. Not at all. But here, watch
[18:39] this. I want you to see this. He said,
[18:41] "And the image of God created he him."
[18:45] &gt;&gt; This is important. Very important.
[18:49] Male and female
[18:51] created he
[18:53] them.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; I want to just show you something and
[18:58] we're going to finish on this by God's
[19:00] grace. And we get there. We're going to
[19:02] get there. It's the best part. But I
[19:05] want to show you something that some
[19:06] people have taught in the message which
[19:08] is disgusting to me. And I I I I believe
[19:11] that we're of the same spirit with your
[19:13] pastor. But sisters, I want to show you
[19:15] something. You are no different than a
[19:18] brother
[19:19] &gt;&gt; in the image of God.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; You have a different calling
[19:24] &gt;&gt; or placing.
[19:26] But when Christ hung on the cross, it
[19:27] took exactly the same blood to forgive
[19:29] the sisters as it did the brothers. and
[19:32] you came out of the exact same spot of
[19:34] God that the brothers came out of.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; So it's impossible for a Holy Ghost
[19:41] fililled brother to treat a sister as
[19:43] second class.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; That's disgusting.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; That'd be like That would be like
[19:51] treating God second class. Yes, sir.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; The feminine spirit
[19:58] came out of God.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; And God blessed them.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; I could never cook like my wife. And
[20:12] she's not supposed to preach, but she
[20:14] can preach to her children.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Different places.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; See, know we need to know our place.
[20:24] But God's no respector of person.
[20:27] Sisters are not going to be in a lower
[20:29] spot in heaven. You know, my prophet
[20:30] said, I love this. You know, yeah, I
[20:33] want to show you something. The prophet
[20:34] said, "When we get to the millennium,
[20:36] you'll be with your wife."
[20:39] And he says, this exact quote from
[20:41] memory. I memorized the good ones. He
[20:43] said, "If you get the wrong wife here,
[20:45] you'll have the right one there because
[20:46] all wrongs are made right in the
[20:47] millennium.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; My wife is my rip. Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; To tell me that my wife wouldn't be in
[20:54] the millennium, I'd say I wouldn't even
[20:56] want to be there myself because see, she
[20:58] came from God also.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[21:02] &gt;&gt; We're not running a racist campaign
[21:05] against sisters and brothers.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; We are the children of God made in the
[21:09] image of God.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's only one type of
[21:16] eternal life and that life came from
[21:18] God. And if anything had a beginning,
[21:20] then it has an end.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; So, if you're believing that you're
[21:25] coming to church and you've accepted
[21:27] this glorious revelation of this message
[21:30] for our day and you're going to you're
[21:32] planning and expecting and believing
[21:34] that you're going to heaven. You're
[21:35] going to have eternal life. I want to
[21:37] tell you something. You never had a
[21:40] beginning.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; You never had a beginning. You need to
[21:44] understand this. You are not going to
[21:46] get to heaven by per chance.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; You There's not a piece of the bride
[21:51] that's going to get in by the skin of
[21:53] their teeth.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; I will be there.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Period.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Because God will not be complete without
[22:01] you.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; He would still have a hole in his heart
[22:04] and his side because we come out of the
[22:07] heart of God. He would not be complete
[22:09] without you. So you don't have to worry
[22:10] about what Satan's telling you.
[22:12] Remember,
[22:14] remember the woman that was caught in
[22:15] the act? God was looking at election,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; but the believers, the broader was
[22:20] looking at her imperfections.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; You know, this is, you know, who was the
[22:32] accuser of the brethren in the Bible?
[22:35] How come he comes to church?
[22:39] It's a It's a brethren that he Well, I
[22:41] couldn't do that. My church wouldn't do
[22:43] that.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Notice those who have tonight eternal
[22:53] life. This is prophet laying this down
[22:56] was with him and was in him. This is who
[23:01] is this mazedc. This is right before he
[23:03] died 65. and was in him and in his
[23:06] thinking and before there was even an
[23:08] angel or a star or cherubim
[23:11] or anything else that's eternal. If you
[23:14] have eternal life, you always was.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I not I'm not preaching that you
[23:20] would be arrogant. But God's not
[23:22] marrying a bride that's all beat up and
[23:26] bandaged up and bruised and walking
[23:28] around like, "Oh, I'm barely I hope God
[23:31] don't keep me.
[23:36] Amen.
[23:39] Amen.
[23:42] I want to look at some characters. This
[23:44] is a very long quote, but I'm just
[23:46] touching on the highlights of this
[23:47] quote. He says, "A real genuine
[23:51] Christian
[23:52] was in him before the foundation of the
[23:55] world. Before the morning stars sang
[23:58] together for joy, the sons of God
[24:01] shouted for joy. I was right there.
[24:05] When God had the thought of making the
[24:07] earth, I was right there. I gave him my
[24:11] advice
[24:13] on how Amen. I was a part of God. I'm
[24:18] still a part of God. But you are too.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:26] And we're identified in the im the moral
[24:28] realms here 10,000 years before there
[24:31] ever was a world form. I was back there
[24:34] before him.
[24:36] This is our prophet. Now here he starts
[24:39] out. He said, you know, when God called
[24:42] Abraham as a really old man,
[24:46] I was there. I think I was the
[24:48] fingernail when he pointed to Abraham.
[24:51] He said, "Leave your land
[24:53] and go somewhere where I'll show you." I
[24:56] wasn't born yet. So, I was still in God,
[25:01] right? That means I was there
[25:04] when he formed the earth. I wasn't on
[25:06] the earth. So, that I was right there
[25:08] when he said it, "Let there be.
[25:13] I heard his voice."
[25:15] You heard his voice this day. You know
[25:18] how you heard his voice? because you
[25:20] recognize his voice. That's what John
[25:22] says. My sheep know my voice. The sheep
[25:24] that come out of him and another they
[25:26] will not follow.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; This ain't by per chance.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; When Abraham was made and he said, "Go
[25:31] at 75 and Sarah was 65 and I'm going to
[25:34] give you a promise." Shout Isaac,
[25:37] I was there. I was there to see Abraham
[25:40] when his faith wavered not. I was right
[25:44] there.
[25:45] I was with just Joseph when he was
[25:49] rejected of his brothers. They thought
[25:51] he was a goody to choose. He was too
[25:53] good for them and they didn't like this
[25:55] dreamer and this brother that thought
[25:58] that he was something special.
[26:02] The rest of them were carnal. You know,
[26:04] Joseph never picked that life. He was
[26:07] called. You know, prophets are called.
[26:10] They're born.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're born. It's It's not by
[26:13] pretend. You don't go to school to
[26:14] become a minister. You're born with that
[26:17] gift.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Man, I was there.
[26:21] I was there when Joseph was sold and
[26:23] left for dad and and sold into slavery.
[26:26] I was there when Joseph revealed himself
[26:29] unto his unto his brethren.
[26:32] I was right there. I was there. You
[26:35] know, a type of election was, you know,
[26:37] when the brethren was coming to Joseph
[26:39] in Egypt. And that's so beautiful. Shows
[26:41] how we'll be gone before the
[26:42] tribulation. and his bride was in the
[26:44] castle before he revealed himself to his
[26:46] brethren. But you know, even before that
[26:48] happened, when the brethren were coming,
[26:49] they didn't know who they were seeing.
[26:52] Do you know the one that was kin to him,
[26:54] he left a little gold thing in his bag?
[26:56] That's election.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Because they were the same blood.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; I was with Jacob the night that he
[27:07] wrestled with the angel.
[27:09] Amen. I was right there when that was
[27:12] happening. See, you were there. You have
[27:15] to identify. This is what our prophet
[27:17] said. You have to identify with God
[27:19] &gt;&gt; to recognize your position. We're going
[27:21] to get into that. Your position in
[27:23] Christ.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; I was there. I was with Moses when he
[27:28] thought he would take over Egypt by his
[27:30] own strength. And and when his people
[27:33] turned against him and he fled for his
[27:34] life, I was right there. Will you kill
[27:37] me like you killed the other Egyptian?
[27:41] I was there when God came down in the
[27:43] pillar of fire in the burning bush and
[27:46] said, "Moses, take your shoes off.
[27:47] You're getting the ground dirty." I was
[27:50] there
[27:52] because I was still in God.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; But I declare unto you, where were you?
[28:02] That's what God's asking Job. Where were
[28:05] you when I laid the foundations of the
[28:07] world? See, if you know your beginning,
[28:10] you'll have no problem at the end.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you you have to know your
[28:15] beginning,
[28:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[28:17] &gt;&gt; to understand your end.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Christians, believers, every believer
[28:25] now is identified in Christ. The same
[28:29] person you must be identified. I was
[28:31] with Elijah
[28:34] in the days of Ahab
[28:36] when they made the choice between God
[28:38] and Balam the false prophet. I was there
[28:41] when he called down fire. I was right
[28:44] there. I was there when they poured the
[28:46] water on the altar and said, "Choose you
[28:49] this day."
[28:51] Who's God?
[28:54] &gt;&gt; I was right there.
[28:58] Amen.
[29:00] Help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize I was
[29:02] with David when he was rejected. You
[29:05] know, I want to just stop here a bit and
[29:06] we're going to talk about David this
[29:08] afternoon, but you know, David was
[29:10] rejected by his brothers.
[29:13] You know, watch watch this. You know,
[29:14] when you're in the the body of Christ,
[29:20] the Bible will show us this. Be careful
[29:22] the emphasis. You know, you need
[29:24] approval from one person. That's
[29:26] Jehovah.
[29:29] If your heart does condemn you not,
[29:33] Amen. Work out your own salvation with
[29:35] fear and trembling.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; David was rejected by his brethren. You
[29:41] know, when David was just under
[29:42] obedience of his dad and took a sandwich
[29:44] out to see his his brothers that were
[29:46] fighting in the war against the
[29:48] Philistines and Goliath, his brethren
[29:51] said, "What are you doing here showing
[29:53] off?"
[29:54] No. You know what? David wasn't showing
[29:56] off. David recognized
[29:59] who he was
[30:01] &gt;&gt; and he recognized that there was an
[30:03] uncircumcised Philistine that was
[30:05] blaspheing his family.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; He recognized his brothers didn't
[30:11] recognize who he was. Even his daddy,
[30:14] you know, even the prophet,
[30:17] even the prophet, you know, prophets are
[30:20] humans. Yes.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; When he was sent down to the house of
[30:23] Jesse and here the first one come up. He
[30:26] was big and stature and strong and
[30:28] educated and smart and he said, "Well,
[30:30] he had a hund 700 people in his church.
[30:32] A thousand maybe 2,000. Oh, he's he's
[30:36] God's anointed. That's a man of God."
[30:39] Really?
[30:41] And God had tapped the prophet on the
[30:43] shoulder.
[30:44] Samuel,
[30:48] I don't look like you. See?
[30:51] I look at the heart.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And so, watch this. Watch this. David's
[30:55] own dad
[30:57] through all his brothers and almost to
[31:00] the point of insinuating a lie.
[31:05] Okay, that's it.
[31:07] Well, you mean to tell me there ain't no
[31:09] more? Well, there's just this little
[31:11] scrawny bride. He's out watching a bunch
[31:14] of smelly sheep.
[31:16] Yes, sir.
[31:18] Prophet said, "We will not sit down
[31:22] until you bring this little scr." The
[31:24] Bible says scrawny, runty, no beauty.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Until you bring them, we won't have
[31:32] peace. See, I was right there.
[31:36] You know,
[31:38] many times in this day, the world's
[31:41] looking at a religious huge show that's
[31:44] become a big business. And they'll look
[31:47] at the bride of Christ and they say,
[31:49] "What's this little elect lady?" Well,
[31:51] she has no real effect on the world.
[31:57] Oh,
[32:00] they don't know where they came from.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:05] I was there when the Hebrew children
[32:09] I've experienced this. I shared this to
[32:11] your pastor. I've experienced twice what
[32:15] the Hebrew children went. You know, I
[32:17] they they I want to I want to just slow
[32:20] down here and show you something. The
[32:21] Hebrew children were slaves.
[32:24] And when they had been taken as slaves,
[32:26] the the king in war had took the best
[32:30] believers of the Jewish people,
[32:33] the smartest, the most anointed,
[32:37] the most skilled of all the watch this
[32:41] all the message believers.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; The Jews were the message believers of
[32:47] the day. Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; And the king loved Daniel so much he
[32:52] brought him a seam and you know the
[32:53] whole story and they were jealous and
[32:54] all that. But the king built the our
[32:56] prophet said that the statue was of
[32:58] Daniel
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and it types the worship of the prophet
[33:03] because it typed perfectly our prophet.
[33:05] See Daniel was so trusted by the king.
[33:08] He was sent to a far away province.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; He would have never allowed that
[33:12] worship.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't present. And the king was
[33:17] doing it because he of the honor and
[33:20] dignity and honesty that only comes in a
[33:23] bride, a child of God.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Daniel was off the scene and they built
[33:29] a statue of him.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; And then the king passed a decree. He
[33:35] said, "When you hear the trumpet blow,
[33:38] fall down and worship the prophet."
[33:42] And what I want to show you something is
[33:44] out of all those message believers,
[33:49] there was only three that had a
[33:50] backbone.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; There was only three.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Only three.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; And the king was a wroth when he heard
[34:02] of the Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo.
[34:05] And you know the story type seven times
[34:08] hotter with types of seven ages and all
[34:10] this thing. The men that threw them in
[34:11] was killed. And do you know that those
[34:13] men
[34:15] never even smelt like fire?
[34:19] &gt;&gt; They did not just burn. They didn't even
[34:21] smell like smoke.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; But watch the dignity
[34:28] that they had. And see I I told you I
[34:31] don't mean this out of arrogancy but
[34:33] when you know who you are you know when
[34:36] I was never affected and and if you are
[34:39] I I'll pray with you but I was never
[34:41] affected by low self-esteem.
[34:44] I had good parents. I never struggled
[34:47] with anything in high school. I knew who
[34:50] I was
[34:52] &gt;&gt; not just in my flesh and my parent but I
[34:55] knew who I was in Christ.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and you could offer me
[34:59] anything. And I just
[35:05] &gt;&gt; you need to know who you are
[35:07] &gt;&gt; in Christ. You need to know who you are.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Religion won't keep you,
[35:13] &gt;&gt; but ownership will.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Family will. Ownership will. And they
[35:19] here these three Hebrew children, they
[35:20] gave the king, they said, "We will not
[35:22] even be careful
[35:25] &gt;&gt; when we answer you.
[35:29] Whoa.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; They said, "We know that our God is more
[35:36] than able to deliver us. But if he
[35:37] chooses not to, it makes no difference
[35:41] to us. If God chooses to send me, to
[35:44] call me, to stop me, or go me, makes no
[35:47] difference to me. We'll go down servant
[35:53] &gt;&gt; our God."
[35:55] &gt;&gt; They never even smell it. You know, I
[35:56] was right there. And here, a pagan king
[36:00] that was was was trying to kill God's
[36:03] elect and never seen God before in his
[36:06] life.
[36:08] The Bible says no man has ever seen God
[36:09] at a time. Lived.
[36:11] He looked in that furnace
[36:14] and he said, "I thought we put
[36:18] three,
[36:21] but I count four.
[36:24] I ain't never seen him before.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I ain't never seen you before
[36:29] that I knew of in the flesh,
[36:31] &gt;&gt; but I'm seeing a fourth.
[36:34] And it looks like I'm going somewhere
[36:36] with this.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; You know, when John seen the bride, when
[36:39] John seen Christ and the church age and
[36:42] revelation in the church ages,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; you know who he seen?
[36:47] I'm jumping way ahead. I'll just give
[36:49] you. He's seen you and he's seen me. He
[36:52] says, watch it. I'm going to finish on
[36:53] this scripture. He says, "I see one like
[36:56] unto the son of man, but it wasn't a
[36:59] man."
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham said it was
[37:04] because his bride, his wife, I love
[37:07] that, his wife
[37:10] was in him
[37:13] &gt;&gt; and he was covered as a lady, but it
[37:16] looked like a man.
[37:22] That's that's beautiful. That's Bible.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; That's the message we're getting there.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Daniel, I was telling you the Hebrew
[37:30] church I was telling them was twice
[37:32] we've had fire on our property that
[37:34] wouldn't burn. Wouldn't burn. And both
[37:37] times the devil testified of it. The
[37:38] firefighters said, "We've never went and
[37:40] seen a fire like this and not burn down
[37:42] everything. Never went to a hay barn
[37:44] that wouldn't burn. I can send pictures
[37:46] of your pastor of the post scarred 8 by8
[37:47] post like 16 feet high completely
[37:50] charcoal never replace it fire but it
[37:52] wouldn't burn. We come home from church.
[37:54] My kid had wore my oldest son had wore I
[37:56] believe it was my son. You know, the
[37:57] fire was burning right around the tires
[37:59] and the machinery had hay on one side,
[38:01] machinery on the other. And I was
[38:02] telling I said, "Put it out. Put it
[38:03] out." It was it was it was burning on
[38:05] the carpet like the rug. It was it was
[38:07] all straw and hay. And he said, "Dad,
[38:09] I'm in my bare feet." I said, "Put it
[38:11] out. Put it out. Fire that wouldn't
[38:14] burn."
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And then the firefighters leave and they
[38:18] say, "Oh, we don't come to a hay fire.
[38:20] We don't come to a barnfire that don't
[38:22] burn down.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; We don't put people in the fiery furnace
[38:25] that don't burn up.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; You can't burn up theophony.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; You can't burn up theophony.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; I was with Daniel.
[38:38] I was right there when out of jealousy.
[38:42] Jealousy.
[38:44] They were jealous because Daniel
[38:46] recognized the spirit of God. A pagan
[38:50] king recognized the spirit of God on
[38:53] Daniel.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; You want to tell if you got the spirit
[38:56] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit before
[38:58] you leave this place, a pagan people
[39:01] will recognize when you go to the
[39:03] grocery store or you go to the doughnut
[39:06] shop that there's something I don't know
[39:08] what it is, but when he comes in and
[39:09] pays for his coffee, it just feels
[39:13] different.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Satan will testify
[39:19] of God's presence. He always did in the
[39:22] Bible. Sometimes it took him a while,
[39:24] but he always did. You know, when they
[39:27] came to Jesus, they said, "We know
[39:28] you're a man sent from God,
[39:32] &gt;&gt; but we're not worshiping you.
[39:36] It's the same as today."
[39:38] Oh, they won't do it publicly.
[39:41] They They'll come at night.
[39:46] Do
[39:46] &gt;&gt; you know I have people in the world that
[39:48] will watch my services,
[39:50] but they would never show up
[39:53] because they know there's something
[39:55] there that they don't have.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; But it's like when they sin online,
[40:00] they'll watch it in their corner and
[40:02] they say, "I don't want none of the
[40:03] other believers in my church." Because,
[40:05] you know, like the blind man in the
[40:06] Bible, I I wasn't born with that kind of
[40:09] fear. when the blind man Jesus healed
[40:11] the blind man and he went to his parents
[40:13] and the church people were disgusted and
[40:14] they and and the parents feared because
[40:16] they'd be kicked out of the synagogue.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "God never gave me that kind of
[40:20] fear."
[40:22] &gt;&gt; He went back to the blind man. He said,
[40:24] "Well," and and he said, "You know,
[40:25] you're supposed to be the spiritual
[40:26] leaders of the day." And he said, "All I
[40:29] know is that that I was blind yesterday.
[40:30] Today I'm I can see." And whether he's
[40:38] Amen. I was with Daniel. You know the
[40:40] prophet said what kept the lions off of
[40:42] Daniel
[40:45] was love. You know what God is? Love.
[40:51] You know what? All in every example that
[40:53] the prophet gave of the evidence of the
[40:55] Holy Spirit, it was love.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; He said it different ways,
[40:59] &gt;&gt; but it was always love.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; The definition of God is love. He loves
[41:04] so loved the world that he came. Love.
[41:07] Brother Bram's first example of the bapt
[41:09] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[41:10] Ghost was love. His second one was that
[41:14] you would believe the revealed word for
[41:15] the day. In John 1:1 it says in the
[41:17] beginning was the word and the word was
[41:18] with God and the word was God. So that
[41:21] was love. And then he said that it was
[41:24] the nature of God would be the evidence
[41:26] of the Holy Spirit and that was love.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to know where you come from,
[41:37] you must be identified with him on
[41:39] Calvary.
[41:40] You know, I was in him when he paid the
[41:43] price for me.
[41:48] I'm identified. If you didn't die with
[41:51] him, the prophet said, then how can you
[41:53] know
[41:54] his life?
[41:56] I died with him on Calvary. It was him
[41:59] that paid the price for sin, but I was
[42:01] in him.
[42:04] And he said, 'Now I am sealed and I'm
[42:06] sitting with him in heavenly places
[42:08] &gt;&gt; and I have all powers over hell to
[42:10] conquer through him. And every Christian
[42:13] believer that sitted the same way
[42:15] because you have to be identified
[42:18] with your Lord the same yesterday, today
[42:20] and forever identified in his ministry.
[42:23] Do you find yourself that way? He said,
[42:26] watch this. He said, "Now I find myself
[42:28] in these last days that many believer
[42:31] Christians identify with his ministries,
[42:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[42:36] and forever. But I find myself in this
[42:38] day
[42:40] identifying." Do you find yourself that
[42:42] way? Believing it, walking with it.
[42:44] Notice that the works he did, the
[42:46] believers
[42:47] will do the exact same.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The works that God did, he's still
[42:53] doing today.
[42:56] the exact same works.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] Identifying identified with them. But
[43:03] what side are you on? Are you just in
[43:05] the present state now? Where would have
[43:08] you been? Would have you been on the
[43:09] side of Christ when these believers were
[43:12] serving them? Or would have you been on
[43:13] the side of Satan? Would you been the
[43:15] one that threw the Hebrew children into
[43:17] the furnace? Or would have you been the
[43:19] fourth man in the furnace?
[43:22] It's what the prophet asks at the end of
[43:24] this quote. Jehovah Gyra 64.
[43:28] He says, "Now, let's take a look at
[43:30] yourself in God's mirror." He said,
[43:32] "Just see where you can identify
[43:34] yourself here tonight, living, if you
[43:37] had been living in Noah's day, the time
[43:39] of the flood, what side would have you
[43:41] been on?
[43:43] &gt;&gt; What have you got in the ark?
[43:46] If you were living in Moses day, what
[43:50] side would even on?"
[43:52] &gt;&gt; I I want to just show you something.
[43:53] Egypt controlled the world.
[44:02] It was no small thing that Moses, not
[44:04] only did it seem like Moses had lost his
[44:07] mind when he said, "I'm going. Where are
[44:08] you going, Moses? I'm going to Egypt.
[44:09] Take over." And he did.
[44:12] And he did.
[44:15] Amen. What side road have you been on?
[44:17] And if you lived in the days of Christ
[44:20] when all the church came against him,
[44:22] watch this.
[44:24] And you had to stand there alone. And
[44:26] all the things he did, the only thing
[44:28] was God and him. The only thing. And
[44:31] even all his disciples nearly walked
[44:33] away from him. But what side if you had
[44:36] have been present in that state?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Where would have you been?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Where would you be? What side would you
[44:44] be on
[44:47] &gt;&gt; now? What side are you on
[44:49] right now?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know where you come
[44:53] from?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, he said many things
[45:01] here. We have a man here that can turn
[45:03] on the light. He said, "What we need
[45:05] tonight is men and women." I was talking
[45:07] about this, our position. What we need
[45:10] tonight is men and women who know their
[45:11] position in Jesus Christ. You, Here's
[45:14] another one. He says in Christianity
[45:16] versus adultery, he said, "You got to
[45:18] know your position. You got to know your
[45:20] place.
[45:23] That's right.
[45:25] He said, "I know my positions in
[45:27] Christ." Another example
[45:29] quote, "Because I got an inheritance."
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have an inheritance, a spiritual
[45:38] inheritance.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; It's eternal life.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was in Jehovah
[45:44] is in the bride
[45:46] &gt;&gt; because they're a part of him
[45:48] &gt;&gt; because they came out of him.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. So, we
[45:54] must recognize our position in the
[45:55] scriptures as believers. You got to
[45:58] recognize your position. The lack of
[46:01] power and the lack of authority in the
[46:05] bride of Christ because you don't know
[46:08] who you are.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I know we can just roll that
[46:11] bride thing off our tongue really
[46:13] perfectly. But you know down in heart.
[46:16] You know down in deep who you are. It's
[46:19] you're a part of the family.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take the blood from you.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I was born a Brandham.
[46:31] So the prophet said it.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And I'll die a brand.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were born a child of God.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; And nobody can take that from you. It's
[46:43] your birth. Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:48] Let's just wrap this up here and we
[46:51] won't be too long here. We look in
[46:52] Ephesians 2. He said here here go here
[46:56] here he said in Ephesians 2 five he said
[46:58] and let this mind be in you which is
[47:00] also in Christ whom being in the form of
[47:03] God thought it not robbery
[47:06] to be equal with God.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; equal with God. I want to show you
[47:11] something this morning.
[47:13] Everything that God's doing today,
[47:16] he's doing through you.
[47:20] You're God's hands.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; You're God's mouth. You're God's eyes.
[47:25] You're God's hearing.
[47:27] Everything God's doing, he's commanding
[47:31] through his five-fold ministry and his
[47:33] bride.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Everything. You're looking for a big man
[47:36] to come. No, no, no. It's already here.
[47:38] The big man's already here.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit. He's already here.
[47:43] You're looking for a big person. He's
[47:44] already here. Jehovah.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; He's in a many member bride.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] John 1:3, "Behold, what manner of love
[47:57] is bestowed onto us that we should be
[47:59] called the sons of God? Wherefore the
[48:01] world knoweth us not because he knew him
[48:03] not?"
[48:05] Verse two, beloved, now that we are the
[48:07] sons of God, it does not yet appear. It
[48:09] does Oh, it does not yet appear. Oh boy.
[48:12] Most people don't recognize that at all.
[48:14] It does not yet appear
[48:16] &gt;&gt; what we shall be. But we shall But we
[48:19] know that when he shall appear. Now wait
[48:22] a minute. He's already here. He's
[48:25] already come down in the cloud in our
[48:26] day. That was the deity, the headship,
[48:30] the authority
[48:32] of Jehovah.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; He took the scales off your eyes to show
[48:37] you this is who your husband is.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never before.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Seal it up, John, because it's not time.
[48:44] But we're here. It's time. That time's
[48:47] passed.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; This day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B said, "It's not just
[48:54] that we're going in a rapture, but we're
[48:56] already in a rapture." A raptures inside
[48:58] of you,
[48:59] &gt;&gt; sir.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. There will be an actual taking
[49:04] away.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; But people are always guilty of looking.
[49:07] Oh, look at what God did back there. Oh,
[49:09] look at what God's going to do over
[49:10] there.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; But they miss
[49:14] what God's doing today.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; But we shall be like him for we shall
[49:26] see him
[49:28] as he is here. Now I I want to close on
[49:32] some of this here. This is amazing. He
[49:34] said, now notice the harmony between the
[49:36] father. This is the prophet here
[49:37] speaking in in the permanent church age.
[49:39] He said, "Notice the harmony between
[49:41] God, the father and his son. He never
[49:43] did anything till first he showed him by
[49:45] the father." John 5:19 he says, "A
[49:48] harmony now exists between the groom and
[49:51] his bride
[49:53] &gt;&gt; and she shows him his word and she
[49:55] receives it and she never doubts it and
[49:57] there's nothing that can bring harmony.
[49:59] Even even death can harm her. Even death
[50:02] for it's a seed planted, the water that
[50:04] raise it up." And here's the secret to
[50:06] it that the word is in the bride as it
[50:10] was in Mary. And the bride has the mind
[50:13] of Christ and she knows what she wants
[50:15] done with it and she performs it.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; See, you are Christ
[50:21] &gt;&gt; today. What's the definition of Christ?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Anointed one.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; What is the bride with the Holy Spirit?
[50:28] The anointed one.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; The anointed one is in your presence.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] We get so caught up with the clay.
[50:39] Be careful,
[50:41] it's going to go pass away.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; It's the inner man. God is a spirit. And
[50:47] those that worship him must worship him
[50:49] in spirit and in truth. The anointed one
[50:52] is present here.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "I must go away and prepare a
[50:55] place for you, but when I'm gone, I will
[50:56] send back the comforter,
[50:59] the
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit."
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in our day and she has thus
[51:04] saith the Lord. You know, I want to show
[51:06] you something here. Many people have
[51:08] this wrong in that, you know, brother
[51:10] Brandham clearly taught us, you know,
[51:12] marriage is a fantastic thing
[51:15] &gt;&gt; because before the foundation of the
[51:17] world, you were one in the beginning
[51:20] &gt;&gt; if you get your soulmate.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, there's times now
[51:25] lately, and I I I love this much more. I
[51:28] I I me and my wife are one. That's just
[51:31] it's just the reality. If she wanted to
[51:33] go and buy a moon, it wouldn't make no
[51:35] difference to me. She wouldn't have to
[51:37] ask me
[51:39] because she knows who I am.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; When I go to the mission field, I was
[51:44] telling them in Africa, I go to the
[51:45] mission field, I don't have to tell my
[51:46] wife to pay the bills.
[51:49] I don't have to sign the checks before I
[51:50] go.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; She don't call me and get permission
[51:57] &gt;&gt; because she is me.
[52:01] You know, look at the woman in the well,
[52:03] the the virtuous woman. She sees a field
[52:05] and she buys it and the the people in
[52:07] the in the gate call her blessed
[52:10] &gt;&gt; and her family honor her.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; That's like it is supposed to be
[52:15] spiritually.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; You have the mind of Christ. You know
[52:19] what God wants done with it. The
[52:21] greatest value is souls.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; How will you get people? you you'll win
[52:26] souls to Christ because they'll want
[52:29] what you are.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Don't give them a prophet book.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Give them something that you got that
[52:36] they don't have a life.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the book. It's the
[52:40] truth.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; But but maybe they can't read.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; The first Bible. We are written epistles
[52:46] read of all men.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Don't have to pass out message books.
[52:50] Don't have to go to the grocery store.
[52:51] Pass out Bibles. You are the New
[52:53] Testament walking in the grocery store.
[52:55] When I open the door, the New Testament
[52:57] walks in.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; When I go to the tiller, there's Acts
[53:00] and Luke, and I'm
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Don't insult God by not recognizing who
[53:13] you are.
[53:15] if my children never came to me when
[53:18] they were in need.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I'd be insulted.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; What do you think about our heavenly
[53:32] father?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You know, if he if you being evil now
[53:36] how to give good gifts to your children,
[53:38] how much him being holy and pure?
[53:44] and
[53:44] &gt;&gt; how to give great things to them that
[53:46] were a part of him.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; You must know
[53:52] who you are
[53:54] &gt;&gt; positionally placed in Christ.
[53:58] Watch this. Let's finish this out here.
[54:00] He said, "They have thus sayith you have
[54:02] thus sayaith the Lord."
[54:04] And watch this. I want to jump down
[54:06] here. He said he never completed his
[54:09] work in his earthly ministry.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; You're you're looking for what can I do
[54:15] for Christ? I just come here and I'm
[54:17] supporting a pastor and I go to work
[54:19] five days a week and I don't really know
[54:21] where I fit in. Maybe I go here, maybe I
[54:23] go there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a
[54:25] minute. Jesus
[54:28] did not have complete
[54:31] his earthly ministry when he was here.
[54:34] So now he works through the bride.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; So you thought I was making that up. I
[54:41] always like the message because I have a
[54:42] backup plan. I know what the prophet
[54:44] said before I say it.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; He's working through the bride.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And she knows that.
[54:54] But how do you know that if you don't
[54:56] know who you are? But she knows that for
[54:59] it is not yet time for him to do certain
[55:02] things that he must now do. But he will
[55:06] know he will now fulfill those through
[55:09] the bride. And he'll do that work that's
[55:12] left for this specific
[55:16] time.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; For this specific time and this specific
[55:22] place.
[55:23] Every single one of you will touch souls
[55:27] that the rest of us in here may never
[55:30] see or never touch.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; For this specific time and for your
[55:37] specific place.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Don't matter if you're in grade one in
[55:41] school or grade five or at the job site
[55:44] or at your apartment or at work or in
[55:47] the store or in the ministry.
[55:52] at this specific time
[55:55] and at this specific place, the Holy
[55:58] Spirit is working through everyone
[56:01] &gt;&gt; that's his.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Revelations 1:1 and I I want to close
[56:08] with this. This is just if this don't
[56:10] make you happy, your wood's wet.
[56:13] Amen. Revelations 11:11 saying, "I am
[56:16] Alpha and Omega, the first and the
[56:19] last." What seeest thou? Write in a
[56:21] book. And he sent it to the seventh age,
[56:25] the seven churches which are and he
[56:28] names the churches 78. Let's go to verse
[56:30] 12,
[56:32] you know, Asia and Ephesians. He names
[56:34] all the church ages.
[56:36] And he says, "And I turned." Here's John
[56:40] verse 12 of Revelation 11. And I turned
[56:42] and saw a voice that spake unto me. And
[56:46] being turned,
[56:48] I seen seven gold candlesticks. And in
[56:51] the midst of the candlesticks
[56:53] was one like
[56:57] like unto
[57:00] the son of man, clothed in a garment
[57:03] down around his feet. Now, I want to
[57:05] show you the scripture is perfect. Now,
[57:07] if I had more time, I'd go back in Luke
[57:09] and the New Testament and show you. And
[57:11] I could give them to the pastor if he
[57:12] asked me, but there's
[57:15] the garment was girded around his feet
[57:17] and it was girded about the paps.
[57:20] That word in the scripture is breast.
[57:23] It's replied to it multiple times. It's
[57:25] in Revelations 15:6 is one. It's also in
[57:28] Luke because it was the bride of Christ
[57:32] that was right inside of Christ in the
[57:35] church ages.
[57:37] They weren't like together. They were
[57:40] one.
[57:43] Watch what the prophet says. And now, if
[57:45] you'll notice in Revelations 1, we find
[57:47] Jesus standing in the seven church ages
[57:49] and the golden candlesticks. And he
[57:51] turned and he seen one like unto the son
[57:52] of man standing there clothed. And how
[57:54] was it? It was his bride standing there
[57:57] in the candlesticks drawn out.
[58:00] That's in why we are not a denomination.
[58:02] That quote is mentioned 16 times.
[58:08] Brother Brandham also again he said we
[58:10] find here stand in the church a beauty
[58:12] Christ molded into it. Watch this.
[58:17] Christ in the church the bride molded
[58:22] into it. Christ molded. It's Christ.
[58:27] It's not the name of the church. It's
[58:29] Christ. Everything is Christ.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And the church had a white garment on.
[58:36] And do you notice it was a woman?
[58:40] Wait a minute. That was Christ. That was
[58:42] God. He's a man. The prophet says, "And
[58:46] did you notice that was the mark of the
[58:48] beast?" And he said, "Do you notice it
[58:51] was a woman and about the breast? And
[58:53] the garment was covering over her shame
[58:56] and it had was a golden cord that was
[58:58] pulled around it and it held around the
[59:00] breast white, speaking of the
[59:03] righteousness of Christ." And the golden
[59:04] card represented the go. The golden cord
[59:07] represented the gospel. The preaching of
[59:09] the gospel brings the Holy Spirit over
[59:11] the church. And the righteousness of
[59:12] Christ holds it there and it's tied with
[59:15] the string girded with the string.
[59:19] And then he's standing up and his feet
[59:22] are brass
[59:24] as they had been burned in the furnace.
[59:25] Brass speaks of deity or divine
[59:28] judgment, I'm sorry. And God
[59:32] in this great oath he took and he set
[59:34] Christ and Christ paid the divine
[59:36] payment. You know the Bible says that
[59:37] you were justified
[59:40] because you never did it. Not the real
[59:42] you.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Oh your flesh did it.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Oh the the people really have trouble
[59:47] with that in the church. This did it but
[59:50] not Dale.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Justified as you never did it. Not the
[59:53] real Dale because I'm a lot better
[59:55] looking in my theophony. I'll be 19.
[59:59] Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Divine judgment. God, sorry. And when
[1:00:06] the church based this divine judgment, J
[1:00:08] Christ was standing there. What a
[1:00:10] beautiful picture standing in the golden
[1:00:12] candle. Six. Let's just go on to my one
[1:00:15] more here. And here's the foundation of
[1:00:19] every good thing.
[1:00:21] Therefore, he represents it in like unto
[1:00:26] the son of man, and was clothed in a
[1:00:29] white hanging over his hair. This is in
[1:00:30] the permanent uh permanent vision.
[1:00:34] And Daniel saw him there many hundreds
[1:00:36] of years, and said he was the ancient of
[1:00:39] days, one like unto the son of man,
[1:00:41] coming in power, united in the ancient
[1:00:43] of days. Judgment is set. Now, watch
[1:00:46] this. I want this is who you are. And
[1:00:48] now I want to just ask you something.
[1:00:51] I'm just speaking to you lukewarm
[1:00:54] church. There was 10 visions that went
[1:00:56] out to meet the Lord and five of them
[1:00:58] were wise and five were foolish. And we
[1:00:59] took that this morning and crafted into
[1:01:01] the tree. And now he said remember that.
[1:01:04] He said they went out to meet God and
[1:01:06] watch. He said the Bible said that the
[1:01:07] books were open. Daniel 79 and the books
[1:01:10] were open in the book of the sinner and
[1:01:12] another book was open. And here's the
[1:01:14] prophet says, "And he said, who came
[1:01:18] with him?
[1:01:21] Who came with him?" Who? Who? I want to
[1:01:23] just tell you who that hymn was.
[1:01:26] Christ Jehovah.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; The church from the rapture. Oh, tens of
[1:01:32] thousands times thousands came with him
[1:01:36] ministering with them. Now, I like this
[1:01:38] part. I just I like this part. It was
[1:01:43] his wife,
[1:01:46] the bride.
[1:01:48] Oh, glory. His wife came with them in
[1:01:54] the church.
[1:01:59] His wife.
[1:02:02] Who are you?
[1:02:05] Let us make man. Do I have your
[1:02:08] permission
[1:02:10] to make you in my image? This is God
[1:02:14] speaking
[1:02:17] to prove to a world
[1:02:21] that there's a Jehovah the same
[1:02:23] yesterday, today, and forever. Would
[1:02:26] that be okay with you? I'll send you
[1:02:28] I'll bring you right back to myself and
[1:02:29] then we'll be all whole again.
[1:02:35] and he made them male and female.
[1:02:39] Great he them. If you continue reading
[1:02:43] there, it also says that he blessed the
[1:02:47] men. No, no, says he blessed them.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry for doing that, but you
[1:02:56] know, you know what I mean? Don't get
[1:02:59] God is no respector of person.
[1:03:03] I am the least of you. I am a sinner
[1:03:07] saved by amazing grace.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I'm just a little ant in the pilgrim of
[1:03:14] God's great economy. You might be a jack
[1:03:17] rabbit.
[1:03:19] Amen.
[1:03:21] Don't underestimate
[1:03:24] who you are.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; The wife.
[1:03:29] I want to show you something. I want to
[1:03:31] close with this. The prophet said, and
[1:03:33] this is not in my notes. I'm folding
[1:03:35] this up,
[1:03:38] that the marriage
[1:03:41] happens here
[1:03:44] and we're going over there for a supper.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Now, some people have trouble with that.
[1:03:52] And I say, you know, if the marriage
[1:03:54] happened over there,
[1:03:56] you might turn down the uniting and God
[1:03:59] would have to kick you out of heaven.
[1:04:03] But God already knows who she's marrying
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; before you end up there.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You see, you were a part of him. The
[1:04:14] bride came out of the rib. Under the
[1:04:18] heart was the heart of God. The marriage
[1:04:23] and the two shall be one.
[1:04:25] It's a beautiful and I speak during a
[1:04:28] great mystery.
[1:04:32] Did you catch it?
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; A great mystery.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; The world's missed it.
[1:04:40] But there's a little person. There's
[1:04:43] little groups around the world like
[1:04:45] this.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; You know, do you know the spirit of God
[1:04:50] is the same in every country?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; You know, I've never once I've been in
[1:04:55] many airports by God's grace. I've never
[1:04:58] once had to hold up a sign to say who
[1:05:01] the bride was or hold up my name. I've
[1:05:04] seen them. I've seen hundreds of signs
[1:05:05] up. People have never met people come
[1:05:07] from other countries where I'm looking
[1:05:08] for this person. I've never had to do
[1:05:10] that because it's it's a it's a mystery.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; It's just it's an atmosphere. You are a
[1:05:17] creator
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; of your atmosphere.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; The presence around people. Brother Ram
[1:05:23] said the people that people love to be
[1:05:25] around is because you have created
[1:05:28] something supernatural and I speak
[1:05:32] concerning oh he's done all these
[1:05:33] marriage things man love his wife and
[1:05:35] wife should honor and love her husband
[1:05:37] all the honor but it's but but I speak
[1:05:39] during a great
[1:05:41] mystery and church order and doctrine
[1:05:43] and all this I speak all this but then a
[1:05:46] great mystery
[1:05:51] Christ
[1:05:54] and his church
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; to spirit. It's an anointing
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; around. I said that in other countries,
[1:06:01] you know, you could walk in people just
[1:06:03] like here. You never seen me before, but
[1:06:06] you did. You just don't remember it.
[1:06:09] Wasn't exactly in this form.
[1:06:12] You see what I mean?
[1:06:16] This is amazing.
[1:06:18] You are a part of something. A lot
[1:06:21] bigger than you thought.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; A lot bigger than you thought.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; This is This is a kingdom of Jehovah
[1:06:31] Gyra.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; He's everything
[1:06:37] to us.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He's everything.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And you know, all around the world,
[1:06:42] there's little elect ladies. I've been
[1:06:44] in places, gatherings this small where
[1:06:47] everything was muddy.
[1:06:51] Not in the one. It was a tin roof. I
[1:06:54] preached in some that were straw huts.
[1:06:56] It was mud. And about the size of this
[1:06:58] platform was the concrete so you didn't
[1:07:00] stir up the dust.
[1:07:03] But it was the exact same.
[1:07:06] A great mystery.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:07:10] and his church.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] God wants to tell you something this
[1:07:17] morning. He's listened to all these
[1:07:19] voices
[1:07:21] and he's coming to Job. He's coming to
[1:07:24] you. And he said, "I demand of you.
[1:07:30] Where were you?
[1:07:34] Where were you?
[1:07:37] Let me help you remember."
[1:07:40] And God goes and lays that all out
[1:07:42] before Job.
[1:07:44] Amen.
[1:07:46] God loves you.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:07:52] his heart.
[1:07:54] You are the heart of God.
[1:07:58] He would bankrupt heaven.
[1:08:00] He would bankrupt everything.
[1:08:04] You know, no man come to the father
[1:08:09] except he dro you. you Satan's telling
[1:08:12] you know you know in Genesis when Adam
[1:08:14] and Eve fell in the garden he said who
[1:08:15] told you that
[1:08:18] you know if you have ever I want I want
[1:08:20] just like I want to give Satan a black
[1:08:22] eye you give him black eye we're g turn
[1:08:25] to if you have ever ever felt the tug of
[1:08:29] God in your heart and Satan tells you
[1:08:32] you're not good enough you just you just
[1:08:34] line Satan up and say you liar you liar
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; because There's people on this earth
[1:08:41] that have never ever ever ever, it's
[1:08:45] hard for me to comprehend this, ever
[1:08:47] felt
[1:08:49] that tug, that just that slightest
[1:08:53] little tug. You ain't here because you
[1:08:55] woke up in time.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And that tug,
[1:09:02] this what? Now, this is Bible
[1:09:05] came from Jehovah.
[1:09:08] And he said he wouldn't lose you
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; because all was in his hand. He went,
[1:09:13] "You can come, pastor.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You can come, Pastor Ch." It's amazing.
[1:09:17] This is not a religion. This is a
[1:09:20] family.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery. And Satan's
[1:09:24] trying to tell you, "Oh, you might be
[1:09:26] lost, or you're not worthy, or you're
[1:09:27] not important, or there's a lot more
[1:09:29] bigger Jesus than you." No, that's a
[1:09:31] lie.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; God is no respector of person.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You're a part of God. You're as equal
[1:09:37] with God as the biggest most important
[1:09:39] person you will walk before kings and
[1:09:42] priests and deities around the world.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And declare unto him that we are not
[1:09:48] careful what we say unto you.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Because I know where I came from.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah Gyra. God bless you,
[1:09:57] Pastor Jesse. God bless you. Amen. God
[1:10:00] bless you.
[1:10:02] Cut
[1:10:04] [Applause]
