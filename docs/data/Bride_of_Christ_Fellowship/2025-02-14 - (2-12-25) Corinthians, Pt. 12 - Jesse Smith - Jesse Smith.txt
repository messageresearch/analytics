prayers tonight Lord as Kings and Priests unto God we'll give you all the glory tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen amen hallelujah let's take our Bibles here tonight uh I may have some of my children reads the the Bible verses we want to go to 1 Corinthians chapter 8 this is part 12 on the book of Corinthians series here so 1 Corinthians 8 verse one I hope to get through chapter 8 and N know that might seem like a a large Endeavor but chapter 8 is kind of short and it's a lot of review uh as far as our preaching because it's very similar to Romans 14 if you remember the Romans 14 uh chapters on Christian Liberties so here in the in the letter to Corinth uh Paul's getting into Christian Liberties here in chapter 8 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 and of course you know I'm not going to have everybody uh stand tonight here by God's grace of course we can honor the word by sitting you know in these type of uh special setting here by God's grace special circumstances but if we can let's just read verse one and then we'll have just another brief word of prayer 1 Corinthians 8 verse one is everybody there everybody here okay thank you thank you children okay let's begin on three one two three now as touching things offered unto Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth so let's have a word of prayer here father God we thank you for today thank you for these songs Lord thank you for the efforts of the people to do the live stream and my my children here thank you for their efforts Lord God and my wife upstairs helping Haven and so forth Lord God we're thankful for all the efforts Lord thank you for technology that we could be uh together uh in this format Lord God so we thank you Lord may your word strengthen the people here tonight as we uh get through this book lord God just guide and direct our thoughts Lord God Lord we know every word in here is thus sayi the Lord for uh it's good for uh edifying Lord God for strength Lord God for correction rebuke as second Timothy says Lord every word of God is inspired God breathed so Lord just minister to us here Lord through the uh this reading of Thy word the preaching of Thy word Lord God thank you God for uh speaking through us through the fivefold ministry God help me to be faithful here tonight Lord at my post of Duty and Lord May the Saints be edified by the word of God by the love of God through the word of God in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen hallelujah okay so uh I probably have my children help me reading you know keeps them uh focused here on the word of God uh at home you know you can follow along here if you have your Bible stay right there in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 like I said we'll try to get through 8 and N 8 is a very short chapter just 13 verses here uh by God's grace I am going to set a timer here so I'll set a timer for about an hour we'll kind of see if we go that long last time we looked at marriage and divorce chapter 7 so it's really interesting and neat to see how Paul goes from one topic to the other you know through this book uh we've already seen how he started off with a Believer standing in Grace and then you looked at the divided carnal condition that's something our church has been going through recently with uh um divisions uh caused by carnality um and so forth but by God's grace we'll overcome this we'll get through this and we'll keep praying for those all those involved um as it was foretold to us a spirit of tail bearing a spirit of re resentment okay and so of course that was probably what was going on in Corinth you know the the people around Peter they followed Peter they thought they were better uh than uh you know those following Apollos or or Paul or and then some said we're more spiritual we just follow Christ we don't need the preachers um but there was anyways divisions caused by pride and so forth so um we can see how some of these uh Bible uh conditions here from the book of Acts Church remain today uh evil spirits don't die right they just go from um uh an open vessel or willing vessel from one to another but let's be only open uh to the Holy Ghost by the grace of God we ask that here uh that God might be glorified I'm just seeing now there's comments I hope the comments are all positive I forgot to turn off the comments uh before I started so hope the comments are uh very kind and loving brotherly kindness in the comments by God's grace I try they kind of surprised me there okay so then we saw how Paul had to deal with sexual immorality um dealt with that and put the man out from under the blood and it seems like he repented it seems like it but we're not quite for sure but it seems like it through uh different uh historians and brother brandom even mentioning that too then he dealt with the sanctity of the body and marriage and now we're into this fifth part with Christian Liberties and it also ties in the warnings that go along with Christian Liberties um we'll see that mainly in chapter 10 but there are a few warnings here in chapter 8 as well by God's grace then when we get through chapter 10 11 is on uh chapter 11 is on headship and the Lord's supper and then uh get to the spiritual gifts charity and then ends with resurrections the certainty of the resurrections and closing instruction and greetings so chapter 8 uh I'm going to have Al maybe I'll just start right here with Malachi and I kind of go down here so Malachi you want to read verse one now it's touching things offered under Idols we know that we H all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edify all right uh case you want read two and then we'll go with the Caris three and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love God the same is n of him all right so I want to look at a few thoughts on these F vers or first few verses by God's grace pardon me um here we see um a statement in verse one about we have all knowledge now he's relating to Idols so Christians have all the knowledge about Idols right Idols um are fake Idols have no real life Idols have no power but remember the Corinthians were a superstitious people uh so they were some of them a lot of them were coming out of this superstitious lifestyle you know even our our Mong friends in our church you know they talk aled about how there were superstitions in their country and some people still hold to those and no doubt there's even superstitions among um Americans you know even for example you know I told a friend yesterday oh we haven't had any uh sickness all winter they say oh you better knock on wood or you better make sure how you say that that's just ridiculous there's no such thing as superstitions um you know that uh the only truth is in the word of God right so we know there's truce but there's no such thing as these uh madeup superstitions but now Paul's talking about the knowledge we have of idols and some people in the church had knowledge that puffed up um and so you know as Christians we have knowledge we have to make sure we don't get a prideful attitude because of the knowledge that we have so that's what was happening in the Corinthian Church they had knowledge about idols and idolatrous temples and we're going to look at three of the temples in Corinth at least from the historical references that I was um looking up and there was some awful things going on in these temples but they had all the knowledge of of those temples um but some people would some of these Believers were still going to the temples just to eat meat or just to have a meal they were invited to these uh these worship Services we'd say uh and they would go eat it there and uh anyways they had knowledge and they knew okay these Gods aren't real so they thought well I can still go eat the meat it's a free meal you know it's a nice meal I I I could go for a free meal but that was Pride uh pride in them because they weren't aware of how the younger Believers around them uh would stumble at them going to these temples and again these temples were some of the most awful temples um you'd want to go to in those days kind of like a lot of the adult establishments today uh nightclubs and so forth like that as we'll get to so Paul says their knowledge was puffing them up U and it was different from charity so if they had charity with the knowledge it would try to edify other people build other people up strengthen other people so Paul says in verse Two If any man knows anything he uh these prideful people then they really don't know like if they're so prideful I know all things and I can do whatever I want and I can go wherever I want and eat the whatever meat I want I can go in any Temple I want doesn't hurt me you know Paul says then you don't know anything yet you know if if you're not thinking about how others are looking at your actions then you don't know anything you really don't have any knowledge right you haven't uh you don't have the character of the the Christ uh the Christ given knowledge you don't have character with that knowledge but love verse uh uh three If any man love God the same is known of him so if anyone has a love of God they're trying to edify other people they're always trying to strengthen other people you know uh uh you talk about people that you know some people around the message and all they do is they criticize others and say well you don't have the Holy Ghost so you don't know and that's not an edifying thing to say you know we shouldn't even if we say we have the Holy Ghost we shouldn't exalt ourselves above uh new Believers you know we should we should try to encourage them and say oh if you don't have the Holy Ghost well that's okay keep pressing in you know is there anything I can pray for you for you know you want to come down to the altar let's pray you know um we ought not to look down upon people well they just came in and you know uh but if you love God you're always trying to build people up right so that that's an a real attribute here of a person who is born again you're not trying to make others feel bad or or something like that or exalt yourself if you love God you're trying to edify others with the knowledge that you have and it's also good to keep in mind you know later on as we preached on chapter 13 earlier in this series Paul said though I have all knowledge without charity I'm nothing so again we get this idea you know Christians have much knowledge about you know uh the the godhead right uh remember that we preach that sermon the complete revelation of Jesus Christ because we have the Holy Ghost and the message of the hour we have the complete known revelation of Jesus Christ known through the scriptures and also prophecies and thus say the Lord statements from God's Prophet brother brandom um but we got to have charity to go along with that or else it's not going to profit us anything it's not going to help us edify other people build other people up help them on their Christian Journey right and we want to help people Along on their Christian Journey we don't want to um put a stumbling block in anybody's way that's what that chap that's what this chapter is about here by God's grace so I don't know how far I'm going to get now as I talk so much on these verses here so let's go to Victoria you want to do um well I'm sorry um I think I covered that uh yeah let me make it just a statement this week I watched um a testimony from Orman Neville's daughter her name is Linda so if you want to link to that let me know and uh Linda's like you know I don't understand everything about Doctrine she said but one thing I knew she was she knew brother brand brother Bram gave her the Christmas gifts the the oranges and the apples and the bags and called her little kitties and patted it uh you know patted her on the head and talked about how cute her uh her braids were you know brother brother Neville's daughter right um but she says I I may not know everything about Doctrine she she said or Mysteries and all these things but I knew the way brother brandham acted and the the humility that he had and how he was always loving people and uh edifying people he said there she said but there's so many preachers I I hear today that they try to strike fear in people and if you don't follow me you missed it and if you don't go to our church you missed it and she said I can tell just by a preacher's Spirit whether they're loving or not whether they are a real man of God or not and she said that's what brother brandom showed me and that's what my dad tried to learn from Brother brandom as well and so we we can always uh get a lot of wisdom from that you know the false preacher is always trying to put fear even brother B says that in the church age book you know a false preacher they're always trying to put fear if you don't follow me if you don't listen to what I say if you don't join my church if you don't send me your money you know they're always trying to put this sinful fear on people and intimidate people uh there's a difference between intimidation and being bold right we must be bold as as Ministers of the Gospel but um I just appreciate that I want to put that in there you know edify brother Ram was trying to edify the children brother Ram was trying to edify the adults brother Neville followed that example and so just that example of trying to lovingly edify other people will speak louder than your sermon will if you're a preacher or speak louder than anything you can testify if you're a sister or a brother uh your actions your loving actions speak louder uh than anything else right it's our actions that speak so loud remember Godly knowledge is a good thing if you look up that word knowledge knowledge is the third step in the statute per man you got to have that anointing so knowledge itself doesn't puff up but it's a prideful attitude that comes along with uh with getting God's knowledge if you don't have humility with God's knowledge then yes your knowledge will puff you up you'll think you're better than somebody when you're not right we're not better than anybody as far as our own human uh sinful condition something like that we're trying to overcome we can over over we can only overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ but we ourselves uh we did not earn our Salvation we have nothing to boast on we're only boasting on Jesus Jus Christ Hallelujah so uh we'll have uh Victoria you want to read verse four as concerning therefore and eating of those things that are offered in sa sacrifice unto Idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other but one very good so here's the knowledge that he was talking about in verse one Christians have all knowledge about Idols right the knowledge is an Idols nothing if you pray to a wood statue or if you you pray to your bank account or worship your bank account there there's no uh there's no virtue right there's no power in idols and we know all know there's only one God there's not two Gods three Gods there's only one God that's the knowledge that we have we have all that knowledge and we know there's only one God L do you want to read verse five for though there be that are called Gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be Gods many many read six un two but us there is one but one God the father of whom are all things and we in him and the one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him gra this clarifies it even more there's people that have gods in heaven gods in Earth Gods under the Earth they have all they have Lords here Lords there but but we know there's only one God that's father God right and then he became manifest in his son Jesus Christ God was manifest In the Flesh 1 Timothy 3:16 and notice just for our Trinity Aran friends that maybe try to criticize us bless you uh Paul notice Paul never mentions the Holy Ghost well that does that mean Paul's a two-person um uh believer uh in two two gods of course not um he's not bistic or anything like that uh he's he's monotheistic there's only one God right there's only one person in the godhead so he doesn't mention a third person in verse six it's because he was a monotheistic Jew and he knew the law could not change God would not change anything thing he said behold in Deuteronomy 6 Behold our Lord is one Lord hallelujah Jesus quotes that there in the gospels as well so Jesus affirms the monotheistic teaching from Deuteronomy chapter 6 about God and so we we see here that uh from the father are all things who of whom are all things so all things come from the father but they come from the father through Jesus to us right so we see that um by whom are all things and we by him so it started with the invisible spirit and then uh the word came forth out of the invisible Spirit the logos and then we came out of Christ right we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world as it says there in Ephesians 1: 4 and 5 and this reminds us of Ephesians 3:9 God created All Things by Jesus Christ the word of God we get that same idea here uh everything comes from the father but it's through Jesus right God created everything through Jesus so we see that uh we see that agreement there the harmony of Paul's letters one Revelation about one God okay verse seven I think we're at Malachi right Mali read seven M how be it there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled all right very good so Paul Paul said not every Christian now remember he's dealing with a lot of Believers in Corinth now not everybody had that knowledge in the church okay and uh their conscience was uh defiled here so this is a very similar thought here to uh Romans 14:23 where it says he that douth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin so Paul is laboring on we don't want a conscience that's defiled as Believers we don't want to feel dirty right we don't want to feel condemned we don't to feel ashamed those are the worst days that we have is when we're ashamed we feel defiled and dirty and not right with God we don't like going through those type of days those are the worst days we have and so Paul's saying related to Idols uh if if some of the older Believers would eat meat in the temple it would cause the weak Christians their conscience to be defiled and remember what a conscience is the conscience is the morally uh right or wrong decisions that we make so our conscience tells us that's morally right or that's morally wrong so when a more mature believer would walk into one of those temples the young believer their conscience would wonder well is that right is that wrong and Paul said that's an awful thing to do to put somebody's conscience in a uncertain condition that then he'll say later you're actually sinning against Christ when you do that in other words we want to just be as as clear as possible to try to make things as as as black and white as they can be right uh this is good this is evil right this is true this is false and we want to try do that um and again while doing that we want to build people up by doing that okay we don't want to live in doubt or uncertainty we don't want to be double-minded uh tossed to and fro we don't want to live in condemnation we want to live in Freedom Hallelujah uh the truth will set us free right so the truth sets us free to do what's right and we won't Wonder all throughout the day well did I was that right was that wrong do I need to repent of that again should I be repenting every day over and over again it shouldn't be that way right we should just repent we know what's right know what's wrong Lord forgive me and then move on walk in the freedom right keep an eye out keep vigilant for the enemy he's going to try to come around with uh seven more demons this time so we got to be prepared to overcome him by the grace of God okay so we see that uh we don't want to make anyone's conscience weak and make them question is this right is this wrong okay we'll get to some more examples here uh soon by the grace of God now in Romans 14 uh Paul actually went through three areas you know vegetarian versus meat eaters he went through that in Romans 14 then he went through holy days whether you consider this day holy or not and then he went uh over meat as well and that's what this chapter is about but not just necessarily meat but it's actually meat eaten in a temple of a of a demonic God we'd say so with a bunch of demon worshippers we'd say so let's try to understand what these people were these Christians were doing in Corinth and remember these are some of the same people that were trying to sue people right in the church the same people that are trying to uh sleep around or getting drunk at the Lord's table well if they're getting drunk at the Lord's table no doubt they wouldn't as long as well they wouldn't feel bad going into the temple to eat some meat in a temple for a demonic God uh as we'll as as we'll see like Aphrodite or Poseidon or Apollo we'll get to those three temples here in a little bit by God's grace now verse eight UHA want read that but meat condemneth us not to God for neither if we eat we are the better neither if we eat not we are the worse thank you so eating meat doesn't give us favor with God or uh refraining from eating meat doesn't take away favor with God doesn't bring it favor with God I use this verse in my 2019 book about uh restoring Christian modesty I use this one to give me a definition of a Christian Liberty so Christian Liberty is something you do if I do it I'm no better off spiritually if I don't do it I'm no better off spiritually it's just it's one of those in between things where you God gives you some Liberty God gives you some options doesn't make any better doesn't make any worse whether you eat meat or not consider this day holy or that day holy doesn't make it any better you're no closer to God whether you do it or don't do it that ought to encourage us with the holy days right with uh especially the Christmas debate and so forth like that um or you know Easter whatever you know uh Resurrection Day you know um we have to remember there are Liberties as Christians and one of them is Holy Days okay now verse nine uh Caris you want to read that one but take he with by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling stumbling book to them that are weak very good so uh Paul says even though you have Liberty with meats and uh you understand eat meat eating is is not sinful uh take heed or that word means carefully examine in the Greek so just carefully examine your life as a Christian and make sure you're not causing anybody to stumble uh that would cause them to stumble into sin now we'll see why in a little bit as we look these temples what these younger Christians would have maybe stumbled into if they thought well that that message believer can go in there well if I go well surely then I guess I can go in there too but but they didn't realize what else was in there or maybe they realized it but they didn't realize that Satan was kind of drawing them in uh to give them an inch you s if they give Satan an inch then Satan would take a mile right and one of the best examples is wine as we've T preached on earlier you know you take a couple of drinks well pretty soon you're getting drunk and uh but it just started with one drink well one drink's okay well then I could have two and uh that Liberty becomes a stumbling block okay verse nine I'm sorry verse 10 uh where we at uh Victoria for any man see thee which has knowledge sit at me and the Idol's Temple shall not conscience conscience of him which is weak be emboldened emboldened to eat those which those things which are offered to Idols very good now this is this is maybe uh hard for us to understand but I think we can get some parallels here John Gil was a 18th century Baptist preacher and he he said it seems from what he read by history that uh in the Pagan temples they would sacrifice animals right once the sacrifice was over a feast was made of what was left so they would invite friends and invite people to come and partake of it and then some of such there were in this church would show their Christian Liberty and their knowledge of it and they'd go and sit down at the feast publicly so it seems like you know the Christians wouldn't go during the actual sacrifice of that animal in the Pagan Temple but they knew oh there's going to be a party and so they maybe they would wait around outside until they knew all the all the ceremony and rituals were over to the demons and then they would just go and get some meat right and sit down actually sit amongst these people um so that's that seems to be like one of the uh the clearest uh examples of that you know they wouldn't actually just be in there during the the sacrifice but they might come later and actually sit down on yeah yeah my friend invited me it's free food it's an honor to be invited but not to the house of the Devils right um but these are young Christians again these are the same people getting drunk these are same people suing might be sleeping around so these are very immature very immature uh carnal Christians that's what Paul even calls them babes they're babes in Christ okay and remember what kind of church this was a very immature church with many serious sins so think about that some of them were sitting in a demonic Temple so the equivalent I think it would be today would be like a bar these uh message Believers or they were they were so young or worldly they would actually go eat in a bar right cuz we know most bars in America the idols Sports right the Super Bowl or the basketball game that's the idols there or it could be they have you know uh filthy rock and roll up there or music videos going on who movies you know those are all Idols right those are those are just modern day Idols today whatever they go there to enjoy or it might be like a pool tournament right uh competition the idol of competition or something I don't know I'm just giving some examples I think a better example though might be an adult entertainment esta but I think that'd be like the best equivalent that I could think of uh because of the level of sin that was happening at these Corinthian temples to Idols as we'll see here in just a little bit so think about that they they claim to believe the message but they're going to the bar they're going to the adult entertainment uh nightclub or something like that they're basically going to a demonic Temple to eat and it's causing these younger Christians to stumble and say is this right what's right what is wrong what what is right and wrong and that was sinning against Christ and sinning against the younger believers okay they had all this uh uh sin going on uh in the church we've gone over that numerous times let's go to verse 11 is it Lydia and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died okay now here I I put I read some different commentaries and so how could a brother perish from eating meat well it this is this could be some hyperbole Paul often use hyperbole just to make a point so did Jesus right he said he said if uh if your eye offend you pluck it out if your hand uh offends you cut it off it' be better to enter the next life missing limbs right than um than to go to Hellfire so this could be Paul giving hyperbole uh and maybe he's not referring to the brother losing his salvation or even dying in the in the natural but what he's trying to do he's trying to emphasize the damage that be can be done to a person's conscience right because the conscience determines good and bad so yeah so uh uh an older believer's compromise could uh cause the conscience of young believer to perish it's just totally destroyed right everything that was built up any any uh early teaching that was gained has now been all lost it's all perished because Paul still calls him a brother right he doesn't say he's going to lose his salvation he just calls him a brother um and he would perish so maybe die physically um uh but or maybe just hyperbole Okay so so uh I want to just make sure I say that here and then remember uh remember we must to remember Christ died to save us right we shouldn't uh we shouldn't cause somebody to stumble because Christ died for them uh not only did Christ die to save us he also died to show us right from wrong right he also died to bring us to maturity as Ezekiel said give us a new heart a new spirit God's spirit the three works of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost I think we would all agree these Pro these people are just hardly Justified there's no way they're even partially Sanctified if they're still going into these houses of of demons to eat and as we'll see just think about all that's going on think about all these people just think about all the people you'd see in a nightclub think about all the people you'd see in adult entertainment you know just Place uh this all that was going on all that was there in the uh in the the Corinth temples so we want to make sure we're helping others to know what's right not to wound their we weak conscience but to help them know what's right okay and so knowledge with a prideful attitude it hurts your brothers and sisters um and prideful acting prideful like oh I can handle this and I can handle this Liberty and I've got all this Liberty to do that and I'll just go there anyway and who cares what the young what happens to the young believers um that that'd be a sinful thing to do uh we should always uh like like Paul said examine ourselves make sure we're not causing other people to stumble so remember the Bible lists these H these Liberties holy days food and wine now in my book 2019 book I also added I believe jewelries on an area of Liberty because in the Old Testament you have Believers wearing jewelry and then by the New Testament Paul's like don't buy expensive jewelry right so we have this area of Liberty okay and also as we pre as we preached the last few weeks there's Liberties in the local Sovereign church not every church has the same uh details for trustees deacons song Services song leaders right there's of Liberty uh in all these uh situations now I think the one that's most important is the wine for us um of course I never drink wine in public I never drink wine except it's at uh communion and just one sip right or maybe two if I have to finish the very bottom of the cup I try to even share the extra with the brothers there in the church now I think wine is the most dangerous as I mentioned earlier because a potential drunkenness and then any immorality that might result because of that drunkenness just with the words but also with the body like adultery or fornication um and that would be something today that would be on the same level as these Corinthian temples as we'll see here uh by God's grace so here's three temples let me just I've never preached this before this was kind of fresh so I was excited to preach this here tonight uh the Corinth had many temples right uh many a lot big population um but one of the temples was the Temple of Aphrodite uh it was on the hill overlooking the city so when you looked up that's what was the highest thing there in the city was this Temple to Aphrodite she was the goddess of love fertility and Beauty so you can imagine what went on there in that uh Pagan Temple okay so they had they had ritual prostitutions they would do the rituals they'd kill the animals right all these things and then these individuals would would do acts with prostitutes okay so that's why I said the the equivalent to this day would be like an adult nightclub or something like that okay so about that I'm not saying it was but it could have been where some of the Corinthians after all the rituals were done then they would go into the Temple of Aphrodite and eat meat and these young believers would be like do they what I mean think of the evil things that they knew was going on in they could hear they could uh they could probably knew about it remember I think the history was there was over 5,000 prostitutes in the city of Corinth you know it was just a very lucrative business um and so imagine a a message believer going into the Temple of a Aphrodite uh it would just it would it would be an awful thing right and that's why maybe Paul says you're causing people's Faith to perish another one was the Temple of Apollo it was uh the major religious Center in Corinth and he's the God of Prophecy now here's where we're getting into something interesting music and healing so these people would Pump Up the Music uh and then they would give uh I just say like this like palm readings right false prophecies divination okay so here is the connection with false prophets Pump Up the Music they would try to get people healed through psychos symatic I can't even say that word but uh just Mind Over Matter type of things and not real healing because Satan can't cast out Satan right um and according to history they had did divination and they had non-binary relationships or homosexual relationships in that Temple that homosexual was prominent in the temple of Apollo now imagine new message Believers going in there to eat some meat after all that went on uh that would be an awful thing right that would be so incredibly sinful and Paul's telling them you know yeah you might have knowledge that yeah I know I know there's no such thing as Aphrodite I know there's no such thing as Apollo what what's wrong with eating the meat then you know I I get a meal out of it Paul's saying you should not go in there you're causing people to stumble because they know what else is in there and how can that be right to go in there what is right what is wrong uh causing people to stumble so it be like somebody a message believer saying oh I can go to the bar I can go down to the adult uh establishment just have a meal or I can just have a drink with with my friends there at the bar or something like that of course we know it'd be an awful you're going on the Devil's Ground right it'd be an awful thing to do getting far from God doing those type of things a third one was the Temple of uh posidon I'm trying to say that right he was the god of the sea earthquakes and hor es and again uh this Temple was known for much prostitution as well um and sailors and Merchants would visit this Temple to seek blessings for safe travel and trade so they would offer animals and they would go through ritual prostitution again to try to ensure they're going to have safe travel and no earthquakes um and all these things and then imagine a message believer going into the Temple of Poseidon and trying to have a meal sit down right next to some of these prostitutes or sit down right next to their friends and maybe the prostitutes are are next to to their friends or something like that uh if you have a friend like that that's not your friend don't hang around people like that that a real friend wouldn't ask a Christian to come in right that's not a real friend that's the devil anointing your associate trying to get you to compromise on the word of God right so any spirit that would draw you into you know worldly atmosphere whether there's worldly Idols or American Idols American Idols uh uh and all these Who's Got Talent and everything like that anything that's exalting the world and magnifying it you know the devil's just trying to get you to give an inch and then he'll take a mile he'll take you further than you want to go so here now we can see the context of some of these Corinthian temples and Paul's saying yeah we we know we know there's no such thing as posiden uh Apollos Aphrodite but when you go there uh you're actually associating yourself with them and you're making people question what's right or wrong so he says so he tells us his final conclusion of this chapter here by God's grace uh verse 12 uh Cas was that you H 12 but when you sin so against the Brethren and wound their weight conscience you sin against Christ all right so we get a good lesson here when you sin against another believer you're actually sinning against Christ well the opposite is true too when you do good to others you do good to Christ so we got to see that everything we do is really how we treat Christ right so how you treat your pastors how you treat Christ if he was your pastor right how you treat the song leader and how you treat the musicians or how you treat your sister you know that's how you treat Christ so we see our our our actions to everyone especially Believers is extremely important that's how we would treat Christ uh how we're treating other people we see that in Matthew 25:31 where we have the parable uh Jesus said when you visited uh the prison you visited me when you gave food to the hungry you gave it to me um when you let a stranger in your house you let me in when you did to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me so we see how Christ is manifested through his body of Believers okay uh Casa you want to read 13 wherefor if me make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest I make my brother to offend okay what a great conclusion what a great conclusion now this statement makes a lot more sense now that we know about aphrodites Temple Apollo's Temple Poseidon's Temple right Paul said if going there to one of these temples and I sit down there if that causes my brother to offend I won't eat any meat I won't go to any Temple while the world's standing so in other words for the rest of History the rest of my life I'll never do that because I don't want to cause an offense to my brother I don't want to wound his conscience I I don't want to make him weaker I want to make him stronger okay so we should take that in consider consideration every action we do especially related to Wine you know um and then the restaurants we visit that's kind of fresh to me there too be very careful which restaurant you go to sometimes people uh I I maybe not I better not go there I better pray about that by God's grace um so we got to be very careful uh modern uh entertainments you know anything uh with TVs movies and music got to be very careful uh where we go is Christians right because it could cause somebody to stumble all right chapter nine I'm 20 I got 25 minutes left here so we'll see if we can get through chapter nine here uh scoffield outlines this chapter in three sections verses 1- six Paul vindicates his apostleship so Paul gives them he he gives them their his advice about meat and and Idol temples and then he says well listen I'm an apostle you need to I'm your Apostle I was sent to you so he has to vindicate his apost apostleship to them and then he has to teach on uh why uh he doesn't take food or money from the people it's his way of a self-sacrifice to keep his sincerity with Christ and then verse 19 through 27 the method and reward of the true Ministry Paul's true Ministry he's trying to vindicate to them now remember because remember Paul's against all these other remember he said you have 10,000 instructors but you don't have many fathers so Paul is standing in contrast to all these other teachers instructors that are allowing them to do that they're allowing them to get drunk they're allowing them to have divisions they're allowing them to go to the temple and eat meat so he's he's trying to say you got to listen to me I was sent as a as a apostle a missionary to you and then he says uh why he are the things he's doing in order to gain a Heavenly reward okay so we'll see that here by God's grace now I'm going to just I'm going to do a little more reading here verse one am I not an apostle am I not free have I not seen seen Jesus Christ Our Lord are not ye my work in the Lord so he gives them his opinion about not opinion he gives him the truth about Christian Liberties says I'm while the world's standing I won't go to that bar I won't go to that adult entertainment place I won't cause somebody to stumble they says aren't I an apostle isn't haven't I seen Jesus and all these other men in the church the preachers hadn't hadn't see that right they hadn't seen Jesus okay so Paul's asked them four simple questions Paul's author Paul's saying consider my authority I've seen the Lord Jesus Christ Paul wasn't allowing them Paul didn't want them to Paul wasn't giving them a license to sin Paul was telling them to live holy you have Liberties but make sure you're always edifying people and strengthening their faith and not causing their faith to be discouraged or uh defiled remember Paul started their Church by the will of Jesus Christ remember Paul was going to leave he said don't fear no man's going to touch you he said I have much people in this city and he was there a year and a half so Paul had to be persuaded by the Lord Jesus Christ to start this church now verse two if I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am to you so Paul says other people might not think I'm an apostle but I surely am an apostle to the Corinthians for you are the Seal of my apostleship in the Lord right you're the very reason uh I am an apostle and uh you're the ones that I preached to and believed and God got saved Now isn't that interesting he could be there a year and a half and yet he'd leave and then look what would happen after he left they'd Sue each other they'd get drunk they' have sexual immorality they get puffed up about it they've had divisions they'd eaten the idols temples you think you would think a year and a half would have been enough but um maybe they had an influx of new Believers in there um don't don't really know about the early teachings Paul gave to the Corinthians but it seemed like they fell away because of those false teachers and false Apostles that came in there and spoke evil against Paul maybe they were persuaded by evil spirits right maybe of resentment or spirits of bitterness or uh spirits of jealousy something like that now verse three my answer to them that do examine me is this and I love this Paul says um I've got to answer for my uh accusers right uh now why didn't Paul say I don't have time to answer questions I don't have time for people that examine me nobody can judge me why I could care less what people think right cared because these were his these were his sheep right these were his these were the jewels in his crown so he cared he said I'm going to make time to give an answer on the people that criticize me and so from time to time I'll do that other preachers will do that now we don't want to spend all of our time preaching against the people that criticize us we got to move on and get back to Christ but Paul takes his time and he he he sets his time aside in this letter uh to clearly State why he's an apostle from the Lord Jesus Christ and why they should listen to Paul so so he does have to uh defend his ministry his experience we know he talks about later in second Corinthians about being whipped uh uh five times being stoned numerous times Shipwrecked robbed all the time and fasting in prayers often uh so we see Paul does have to tell them his qualifications and his experiences to try to remind them why he's a genuine Apostle or missionary okay verse four have we not power to to eat and to drink have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other Apostles and as the Brethren of our Lord and sephus or I only and Barnabas have we not power to forbear working so Paul's basically saying Apostles have the right to be married now the Catholic Church they must be uh they must be blind or something like that how can they not see this the Bible says Peter had a mother-in-law so Apostles have the right to be married they have the right to be served food because remember Jesus even told the apostles in Matthew 10 he said don't take a script right don't take a bag of food he said whatever they lay before you that's what you eat right so Paul said a preacher preacher can just go preach a missionary can go preach and and uh if they're a true servant the people will just feed them if if the whoever receives them will feed them um and then uh preachers have the right they don't have to work they can just give their time to fully to preaching teaching praying fasting study of the word like Paul said give yourself holy um they have all those rights those are are the rights of uh missionaries those are the rights of Apostles okay but Paul said I'm not going to use those okay verse 7 he keeps going he says who goeth a Warfare any time at his own charges which Soldier paid to join the Army none right they get paid to join the Army right who who pays to go die in a war nobody pays to go die in a war they get paid to go die or fight no Vineyard owner paid for the right to toil in the for the grapes like and not take any grapes right right that's what he says who plants a Vineyard and eats not the fruit thereof you don't pay money to go work out in the vineyard and then don't enjoy your grapes you you squash The Grapes you smash the grapes you get some grape juice and uh for communion you get wine right U they did it to get fruits and no Shepherd is pays money just to watch Sheep No a Shepherd get paid they get paid through the milk and the meat or whatever it would be Jesus said the labor is worthy of his higher so Paul's laying out the rights of Apostles right he's laying out all these rights why he's an apostle all the things he could do but again he's going to use this to show I'm sacrificing everything to show my sincerity and to keep myself pure and to show you that I'm a sincere missionary because remember they were doubting whether uh Paul was uh missionary they're losing confidence in him and he's trying to remind them right right the Bible say stir up your mind by way of remembrance is's trying to remind them of the truths uh of true missionaries in the apostolic age verse 8 say I these things as a man or saith not the law the same also so Paul's saying the Old Testament and New Testament agree on this this is a subject uh that uh had Flows In Harmony goes in Harmony from the old to the new just like the Ten Commandments I was teaching that at middle school this week and showing the the kids and you know all these Ten Commandments they're in the New Testament too like in Revelation 9 God or Jesus destroys lot the Nations for their Idols right God still against graven images and Idols verse 9 for it is written the law Moses Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that tread out the corn doth God take care for oxen okay so U payment for preachers is God's care for them feeding preachers is you caring for God's servants who are laboring preaching singing teaching all that they're doing just like payment for soldiers if they're go fight for you you got to pay them just like grapes for the vineyard owner just like milk for the shepherd they're laboring so they deserve a payment right they're worthy of the payment Old Testament and New Testament agrees with it verse 10 or sath he it all together for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that plowe should plow in Hope and he that threshthesky number right the four directions and all the fours that relate to the Earth um so he gives a fourth example a farmer right very similar to a a Vineyard owner uh There's Hope for the farmer if he plants uh wheat seeds then uh he'll get wheat back right um so there is hopeful reward for Laborers all laborers should have a reward verse 11 if we have swn unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things so Paul says it's not a great thing to be paid natural things for spiritual blessings that's not like some great thing oh we get we get we get love offerings if we preach or as a pastor gets tithes and that's not a great thing that's a that's a that's a normal thing that's a us that's an expected thing you're preaching you're laboring you're giving your life for other people to to preach God's word to them so surely you should be rewarded for that Paul says it's not some great thing it's not some unusual thing in every other area of life if you labor you expect and you have hope for some reward verse 12 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we the rathers know you let these false teachers and these 10,000 instructors you pay them right Paul says why not the real ministers right the real Apostles Paul says nevertheless he and Barnabas have not used this power instead they suffer all things lest they should hinder the gospel of Christ so for them it would have hindered their walk with the Lord it would hinder the gospel of Christ so Paul was trying to show him he he and Barnabas we're different from all these 10,000 instructors we're not going to take uh the offerings we're not going to take the tithes or anything like that if Paul was the pastor right we're going to be different we're we don't want to hinder the gospel like these teachers are hindering the gospel verse 13 do you not know that they which minister about the Holy things live of the things of the temple so Paul's quoting the Old Testament verses right uh the Liv priesthood there the aonic priesthood they lived off the tithing of the people he said they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar now remember there's five Old Testament offerings if I'm not mistaken um only one of them the burnt offering that was the most extravagant that was given holy to God but I think the other four the worshipper and the priest could both partake of it if it was a meat offering a drink offering uh the priest would get a part of that too remember that's what Levi's Sons they were taking the fat of it the fat was supposed to go to God um so we see some connection there too that the ministers the servants the priests in the Old Testament they lived off uh the the the labors of the people because they were doing spiritual work and so they they benefited from the natural blessings of the people the sacrifices so I love this here here's the verse I use friends uh family anyone that accuses me of ties is wrong here's the verse you go to 13 and 14 Paul quotes Old Testament you can even use course 12 and 11 too Paul says don't you know the Old Testament lived off the things of of the the temple Paul said verse 14 even so the Lord so Jesus even Jesus ordains which means arranges appoints gives orders commands that they which preach the gospel should live of the Gospel so Paul says it's set up the same in the Old Testament New Testament so we know tithes and offerings um and remember those Old Testament they could they could they could convert an animal into money right because it's such a long distance they could do that there scriptures on that so today if we don't have if we're not Agricultural Society well surely we can convert you know we can give just money right that's a of course that's just how our uh society's ordained and set up like that but I want you to see Jesus Christ ordained ties and offerings here ties for the Ministers of course the pastors and anyone yeah even missionaries you know it wouldn't be the ti then uh it would be just offerings then to feed the missionaries feed the evangelists right um and do all that verse 15 but I have used none of these things so Paul said I'm going to I'm different than these other uh preachers all the even true preachers have the right to do this but I've not neither have I written these things that it should be done so unto me I'm not writing this so I can get money I'm not writing this so I can get more love offerings or something like that for if it were better for me to die that than that any man should make my gloring void so Paul says to me I'd rather die than be like these other false preachers I don't want to be like them at all uh I don't want to I don't want to put a burden on the people I don't I don't want my testimony to look anything like them so uh Paul and Paul says this is my glory so Paul says I I feel led to live this way so I'll get a reward in heaven right that's what he's saying my glor he was gloring in this he was rejoicing in this that yes God's G me enough strength I can go into a city I can just work work work work work I don't have to take anybody's money I don't have to take anybody's food Paul said this is this is this is what I want to live for I'd rather die uh than have to take money from the people and act like these other uh instructors or these false Apostles verse 16 for though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of see because he was called to the gospel he was called remember Jesus said uh Jesus said you must suffer many things you must go to the Gentiles you'll be a light to the Gentiles and then and notice he says right here for necessity is laid upon me Jesus put the necessity of this on him he says woe unto me if I don't preach the gospel because Jesus ordained it right uh so he says in one way I don't have I don't have Glory over the fact that I'm called I Paul didn't ask to be a apostle Jesus ordained Jesus set it up that's what Paul's saying here if I don't woe is me I'm going to suffer I'm going to go through awful times if I neglect the calling and I have nothing to glory in this I didn't I didn't ask to be a preacher I didn't ask to be an apostle right and so that's kind of that's how every preacher should be that they didn't ask to to be a preacher they were called to it by the leadership of the Holy Spirit then God will vindicate right as we said a gift will make room for somebody who's really called verse 17 Paul says verse 17 for if I do this thing willly willingly I have a reward now that's referring to like what Jesus said about a unic remember Jesus said a unic some are called from their womb mother's womb others are made Unix you know and so Paul's saying if I just did this without Jesus's call as far as like a vision and all these things then I'd have a reward for that he said but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel's been committed to me in other words Paul's saying I didn't ask for this Jesus gave me this Jesus committed the gospel to the Gentiles to me right uh he just didn't saywell I kind of feel led to preach no he had Jesus visit him we'd say uh face to face or theophany to face right or Vision to face right um and so Paul's laying this out here you know so he's saying this is one thing I can glory in I can glory in the fact that I can be different I can sacrifice I can be a servant rather than um rather than act like these instructors these 10,000 instructors in the Corinthian Church that were leading them astray he said but I I can't glory in the fact that Jesus called me and woe unto me if I don't follow through with Jesus's calling for my life Verse 18 we're almost done I think well yeah we got eight minutes left on the hour so I think we'll get done here what is my reward then okay so Paul lays all this out he said what's my reward then his reward was that he would preach the gospel and make it without charge so he's totally different from these other Corinthian preachers that I abuse not my power in the gospel so what does this tell us the preachers in Corinth were abusing their power in the gospel right like think of the sons of Eli I mean what think of what these preachers were allowing these people to do right Paul had to rebuke them Paul had to come like a father and children call them foolish children carnal baby or just babies what were these preachers allowing them to do so clearly they were abusing their power in the gospel uh so they were taking money taking all these benefits which are okay but they then they were teaching the wrong thing uh they're allowing all this dis order in the church no wonder but called it the Corinthians book of Correction they were so uh they needed so much correction it seems like all they needed was correction because they were so worldly so carnal so immature verse 19 for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all so all these other preachers were remember Paul says it I think he said it earlier they're they're exalting themselves like they're kings they're acting like kings Paul said I got to be different from them I got to be a servant I can't be exalted myself like some king or ruler over them he said that I might gain more so Paul realized I'm not going to or I'm only going to win souls and with a real experience if I humble myself and make myself a servant uh to this people rather than make myself a king or a lord or some great big somebody some famous preacher right I got the only way I win souls is to show The Real Love Of Christ the real servant attitude and lifestyle of a real Christian preacher okay um so his reward was being different uh from these other instructors in the church that were no doubt off the word of God and he knew he'd get rewarded for that okay and then uh verse 20 here we're getting to this idea here where Paul uh he would he'd really take into consideration a person's background before he tried to minister them so if someone's a Jew he'd go he he' probably you know he probably used all the Prophecies of Jesus right from the Old Testament bring it that way if they're G how they don't know nothing about the Old Testament so they he'd bring the gospel the different way right if somebody's weak and uh you know they don't have a lot of faith already then he would just try to build them up right so depending on how each person was in the condition Paul met them that's how he would Minister them that's how he would try to win them to Christ okay so verse 20 and unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews look at the book of Hebrews that's a great example how Paul became like a Jew also in the book of Acts he shaved his head he kept kept his vows he tried to get to Jerusalem for the feast uh he was trying to be like a Jew to win the Jews okay and to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them them that are under the law and a good example is where Paul went and circumcised Timothy in order to try to win some of the Jews okay because a Jew would not receive a a a gentile preacher because he wasn't circumcised he he had disobeyed the abrahamic Covenant or neglected the ab a covenant and yet Timothy and Paul knew you know circumcision is nothing circumcision again now is the area of Liberty but to them it was so important so Paul's like what would it hurt Timothy to be circumcised it wouldn't hurt anything right it's just a surgery and you got to recover but if that opens a door where you can win souls to Christ then it's worth that sacrifice okay verse 21 to them that are without the law as without the law now I love this um so some people say well my sinner friends I'm going to go out to the bar to win to Christ or I'm going to go out to the adult uh establishment try to win them to Christ but look at the next words being not without law to God so I'm aware of the law of God but under the law to Christ so I'm still going to keep Christ's word uh but I'm trying to relate to a gentile or a sinner who doesn't know the law I'm trying to relate to them uh but I'm going to O always obey the word of God I'm not going to try to bring them Jewish uh Traditions or maybe Jewish prophecies now maybe prophecy would help a gentile if they respect uh history or prophecy Paul's saying whichever whichever background they're in that's the way I've got to humble myself I got to I got to kind of remember their Traditions I got to remember things that they uh maybe things that they uh have been taught their whole life and I got to I got to bring the gospel in a certain uh Direction by the grace of God okay that I might gain them that are without the law okay verse uh 22 to the weak became I as with oh yeah I just thought of a good example there uh with in in the city of Athens in Acts 17 what did Paul do he started there and he started talking about their poems he started talking about their discussions he enters right into their discussion right and he uses some of their own poets or your poets have said we're The Offspring of God so there's a good example good amen hallelujah they were they were not Jews right but he was able to enter into their conversation bring something from a poet they knew but say the reality of that is in Jesus Christ and you got to repent of all your sins right and then some believe some didn't so there's a good example I was kind of meditating on that Lord give me a good example so I thank the Lord for that acts 17 verse 22 to the weak uh became eyes weak now here's where he's getting back to the eating the meat right from the previous chapter I've got to remember these people are weak so I even though I got the Liberty I got the knowledge that there's no such thing as these Idols there's no such thing as Apollo I got to remember I got to I got to minister to them I have to remember their conscience they're weak they can't handle that so I'm going to I'm not going to do anything that would cause them to stumble right they're weak I got to remember what do weak Christians struggle with and I I won't use my Christian Liberties uh if they're going to see me do it I won't do it I'm not going to cause them to stumble and that's how you gain the weak and I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some so a good example for us is uh it's just like how I came in the message right I went to Brother Craig and brother Brooks and they didn't say brother Ram said brother Ram said brother Ram said brother bam said you know so to someone outside the message like me I was outside the message they minister to someone as outside the message right but if someone like you now my children you all know brother Ram said brother Ram said brother Ram said so you know I might bring the gospel in a certain way like I might uh so quote from brother Brandon might help my children you know may might relate to them a little more or people out people that were raised in the message but someone not raising the message you know I was taught the Bible says this there's no Trinity and there's no eternal hell and I was like oh yeah that's right oh my goodness there's no women preachers really you know they didn't say brother Ram said there's no women preachers they said the Bible says okay well that made that spoke to me and then later where'd you get that oh God sent a prophet named William bradam so they became all things to all men right that they might win some verse 23 and this I do for the gospel's sake that I might be partaker thereof with you okay so Paul wanted to partake in getting people Sav saved he want to partake in preaching the gospel uh winning people to the Lord Jesus Christ he does all this for the gospel's sake he could minister to a Jew Gentile to a weak person to a strong person he can minister to all them all right almost done here I got one minute for an hour okay uh verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain now the Olympics were in Athens not in Corinth but Corinth had similar sports games just like every community in America's Got footb football basketball baseball track whatever um so they'd be familiar with this now Paul's bringing it down here a way they can relate you know all these athletes they run and they want to get a prize and they want to be the they want to be the best right so Paul says Paul says run that you may obtain like run that you're going to be uh the Christian who will be so close so in love with God so much like Christ right and this is why brother R said if there's going to be one person make it out of brandom Tabernacle the golden of rapture I want it to be me right brother said your faith isn't good enough your faith isn't strong enough if you don't feel that same way like I'm going to be that one or I'm going to be one of those if 500 people get raptured I'm going to be one of them right because you should have that attitude that's where he gets this I believe that's where he gets this from 1 Corinthians 9:24 run the race like you're going to be the one that receives the prize right like I would think as a Christian at least I could at least least I could get would be a bronze right at least I would get some type of a crown some type of a reward right you should have that attitude I'm going to get there's going to be at all those seats at the marriage supper there's got to be one seat with my name on it I won't be right in the middle I won't be the right by Jesus on the right and the left hand but I'll be at one of them by God's grace right and I'm going to run that I'm going live my life that way I'm going to uh try to be all things to all men uh keep the law of Christ in my heart and the law of the Holy Spirit and try not to cause anybody to stumble verse 25 and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things Mal kind are talking about the gym and he's watching his calories you know and we got to watch what we don't eat too much sugar right because that will hurt your muscle growth right it hurts that so Paul's bringing this idea and look at all these athletes they're very careful they have much self-control in what they do in everything their sleep their eat their diet uh even their body how they treat their body and if they're willing to do that to obtain a corruptible garland that will wither away how much more should we be trying to be temper in all things to obtain an Incorruptible Crown eternal life Hallelujah we should also be temperate in all things that's why you should fast that's why you should pray that's why you should read your Bible uh that's why you should go to church physically that's why you should visit the sick pray for the sick uh help the poor right all these things keep your body under the control of the Holy Spirit keep it uh keep the anointing of temperance on you that temp the anointing of self-control over your bodily passions verse 26 I therefore so run not as UNC certainly so Paul had a Paul knew where he was running Church we're running to Heaven hallelujah we're running to the Rapture we're running to be the Bride of Jesus Christ the wise virgin that's what we're running for to be that wise virgin the wife of Jesus Christ so fight I not as one that Beth era we know why we're fighting we're fighting the devil we're fighting the good fight of Faith right and we and it's feels good to hit the devil right it feels good to overcome Temptation it feels good to break through addictions right it feels good when people are delivered from demonic powers and they're they're healed and we get testimonies of healings oh my it feels so good right we're not beating the air we know what we're fighting for verse 27 but I keep under my body so I beat my body I I chasen my body and bring it under subjection I make my body obey the word of God lest that by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Cast Away so we've got to learn to be more self-disciplined uh Paul and Paul's using this again to say I'm a real preacher I'm not going to take your money I'm not going to stay in your house all these things and take all the benefits of your house I'm going to beat my body bring it under subjection I'm going to live a more difficult life because that will help me to know that I'm going to win the race I'm not going to be uh distracted by bodily passions I'm not to to be distracted by money and temptations of money or women or popularity I'm not going to be distracted by any of that and be totally sold out to the gospel all right so self uh discipline of the bodily passions is critical to being a witness to others Paul says that in other words we must be different from other preachers I mean I've had numerous people tell me you're remember that brother that visit with Austin he's like you're not like any other Pastor I said Amen to that I don't want to be like the other denominational pastors I want to be a totally different man who loves the Lord Jesus Christ is approachable can talk to them even some of the Saints in our church from other countries they say well you're not like all the Pastors in the other country I I take that as a compliment I don't want to be like everybody else I want to be what God called me to do and call me to be by the grace of God um even you know we had we even had one person leave their church and uh we've had two people leave church from a different from hours away some people even move in because they knew this was a church of discipline my wife knows who we're talking about um but then the person didn't choose to be disciplined right uh or they missed their family and move away or something like that you know so we have a reputation we want to keep that reputation being disciplined to the word of God we want to keep our body we want to bring our bodies in subjection to the word of God well other churches say oh it's okay for me to wear high heels it's okay for me to wear sexy clothes or it's okay for me to wear a little makeup or cut my hair a little bit trim my hair a little bit no we we're going to bring our bodies in full subjection to the word of God we're not going to compromise on anything by the grace of God we're going to pray fast give arms keep uh do a little bodily exercise because it profits you uh because your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost you're going to be careful where you go right and careful what you do when you go there because remember in the context these people were eating in uh eating meat in prostitution houses right so in other words they were going to the bars where there was prostitutes they were going to these adult nightclubs where there was prostitutes and actually eating meat uh around that type of environment so I'm closing with this Malachi can come here to the piano here I'm just going to close with this quote from brother brandom he said uh this is Corinthians book of Correction I was listening this today again to get my thoughts back on brother brandom's emphasis on the book of Corinthians um brother Bram said your virtue is what you're counted by you don't say oh Hallelujah I know I got the Holy Ghost because I did this Hallelujah and brother BR said you say that and you have enough temper to fight a buz saw right so brother I'm saying look at your Christian virtue are you kind are you just kind to people right or do you got a temper that just gets so mad at people right and uh or people can get so bitter or so lustful or so prideful you know no matter how much you shout hallelujah and that's what he's going to say dance or speak in tongues if you don't have the real character of Christ then you haven't really accomplished anything right like Paul says without charity it doesn't doesn't do anything brother said let me tell you brother it takes virtue that Christ respects though I speak with tongues of men and angels though I pour forth blood out of both my hands though I shout and dance in the spirit though I eat the word of God and I love it though I drink from the same spiritual rock that the rest of them does though I clap my hands just as loud as the rest I can clap pretty loud though I could cry crocodile tears no doubt we've seen people cry cry cry cry cry brother though I could do all this some people might be able to cry longer and louder than others but if that real genuine real Christian virtue isn't there to Christ you become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so M no matter how emotional no matter how the circumstances or experiences I felt an angel I felt this touch and I I heard that voice and I no matter what you got to have the character of Christ brother said Paul was warning the Corinthian Church of this which it was all mixed up in all kinds of Fanatics or Fantastics right all the gifts they had everything operating but yet they had all this sin operating too I'm brother said I'm warning you for friends he says remember I will have to answer for you at the day of judgment and so will I answer for bride of Christ Fellowship at the day of judgment we saw it in Romans 137 and 8 Romans 13:17 brother says your blood won't be upon me he says no matter how loyal you are to anything else be loyal to Christ remember that as we pray so let's have a word of prayer here just playay I love him I love him because he first loved me let's pray friends here our family let's pray that we have the real Christian who wants the real Christian virtues right yeah we want experiences we want testimonies we want the supernatural but we also want to keep our body and bring our bodies in full obedience and subjection to the Holy Ghost so we have the Christian virtues Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity capping it all off keeping all those uh attributes of Christ sealed into our lives father God we thank you for today thank you for the patience of your people Lord I trust the word of God was a help to them a blessing Lord as the world
