[39:19] 1 I don't remember when it was but I
[39:22] just U was reading this and those three
[39:24] three words in Hebrews 12:1 really stood
[39:26] out to
[39:28] me I just want to preach on those three
[39:30] words so easily beset I just want to
[39:34] preach on those three words here
[39:35] today it's kind of like the it's kind of
[39:39] like the uh the part where we are our
[39:41] Humanity right so we just want to focus
[39:43] on that part about the humanity and of
[39:44] course you know encourage you at the end
[39:47] uh with the spirit of God that lives
[39:48] inside you but I just want to emphasize
[39:50] those three words I
[39:52] thought it was inspired
[39:55] here Hebrews
[40:05] 12:1 so look forward to uh this evening
[40:08] we'll do a a service I'm going to just
[40:10] do some teaching on uh youth scriptures
[40:12] because we were at brother cams last
[40:13] Sunday and he really preached a I called
[40:15] it a masterpiece now that doesn't mean
[40:17] it was perfect but he really preached a
[40:18] wonderful message um on youth you know
[40:22] and how um how God you know wants the
[40:25] youth to be examed you know and it was
[40:27] really a fantastic it was fully truly
[40:30] anointed service you know and going into
[40:32] the service cam had asked me about
[40:34] preaching and and he's he's and I said
[40:36] well I said just go with how you feel
[40:38] led he said I feel led to preach I said
[40:40] well that's good then you go ahead and
[40:41] preach you know and he he certainly I
[40:43] told him I said you really had the
[40:44] leading of the Lord it was really a a
[40:46] tremendous message I listened to part of
[40:47] it yesterday I'll I encourage everybody
[40:49] to listen to it I'll maybe I'll send the
[40:50] link out but I was really inspired by
[40:53] that message last week and so Lord
[40:55] willing tonight will do some teaching on
[40:58] that Hebrews 12 vers1 let's read uh
[41:01] verse one together and we'll have you be
[41:03] seated here trying to watch the time
[41:04] here by God's grace one two 3 wherefore
[41:08] seeing we also are compassed about with
[41:12] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[41:16] aside every weight and the sin which
[41:19] does so easily beset us and let us run
[41:23] with patience the race that was set
[41:25] before us amen may God has blessing to
[41:27] re his word you may be seated praise
[41:35] God there's a few other things I'd like
[41:37] to share eventually maybe I'll share
[41:38] them tonight by God's grace when we're
[41:39] not in the live service but I do want to
[41:41] share a few more things about you know
[41:42] the recent events of this week uh I'll
[41:45] be sharing those Lord willing then
[41:47] tonight uh by God's grace but I just
[41:49] want to look at this thought here so
[41:51] easily beset and as I said this is the
[41:54] human side of the Christian
[41:58] um you know many times uh you know when
[42:02] uh we go through battles we go through
[42:04] trials that's when we see some of our
[42:06] shortcomings um and so I just want to
[42:09] just focus on that for a little bit uh
[42:11] you know there's times you know I just
[42:12] want to encourage you you know and and
[42:14] uh I I want to I want to do that as
[42:16] often as we need it you know by the Holy
[42:17] Spirit um and I'll definitely encourage
[42:20] you as well in this sermon but I just
[42:21] thought it'd be just appropriate as I
[42:23] was looking at some of these things and
[42:24] some of the things I heard preach at
[42:25] brother cams and as I've heard you know
[42:27] even listening myself uh I thought I
[42:29] would bring these out and look at you
[42:31] know just this idea of you know so
[42:33] easily beset you know sometimes we uh we
[42:37] we we fight the devil so hard you know
[42:40] sometimes we give everything we got you
[42:42] know to to fight the enemy and the Bible
[42:44] says we should the Bible says uh that we
[42:46] fight the good fight of faith our fight
[42:50] is not a fight in vain it's a good fight
[42:53] praise God God wants us to fight with
[42:56] everything that we have Hallelujah we
[42:58] want to give all of our strength
[43:00] Hallelujah uh to winning this fight amen
[43:03] and you know God gave us great weapons
[43:06] to fight praise God God gave us you know
[43:10] six
[43:12] uh six uh attributes here and let me
[43:14] turn to as I Ephesians chapter 6 there's
[43:16] six attributes in uh to overcoming Satan
[43:20] the Bible says we do not wrestle against
[43:22] flesh and blood and I'm just kind of uh
[43:25] feeling led to go read dead again he
[43:27] said take the whole armor of God that
[43:29] you may be able to withstand in that
[43:31] evil day and having done all stand and
[43:34] so you know God gives us all the
[43:37] equipment that we need to
[43:39] overcome the Bible says stand with your
[43:41] loins gir about with the truth and
[43:43] having on the breastplate of of
[43:45] righteousness so we need truth if we're
[43:47] going to overcome the enemy praise God
[43:49] hallelujah we need we need the
[43:51] righteousness of Christ Hallelujah then
[43:53] the Bible says feet shod with the
[43:55] preparation the gospel of peace
[43:57] Hallelujah so we have to have the gospel
[43:59] of peace Hallelujah and we need the
[44:01] shield of faith that will quench every
[44:04] fiery Dart of the wicked Hallelujah we
[44:07] need to hold this Shield of Faith
[44:08] Hallelujah that's right and then we need
[44:11] the helmet of salvation Hallelujah
[44:14] knowing that we're saved right we need
[44:15] the protection of our minds that we're
[44:17] saved and the sword of the spirit which
[44:19] is the word of God
[44:21] hallelujah we've been given the greatest
[44:24] armor brother R said you know if if
[44:26] America wouldn't send our troops with
[44:28] the best weapons that they had how much
[44:30] more will God give us the best weapons
[44:31] that we need hallelujah praise God thank
[44:35] God and he sure he he surely does he
[44:37] certainly does but then there's times
[44:39] church when I'll say like this sometimes
[44:42] we don't seek God like we ought to and
[44:44] sometimes uh you know and it's greatly
[44:46] expressed in some of these Lamplighter
[44:48] books we've got you know uh you know and
[44:51] uh sometimes the Warriors are they're
[44:53] tempted by the enemy to lay down their
[44:55] sword
[44:57] right uh what's that favorite one that I
[44:59] I
[45:01] like not the Giant Killer sir nameless
[45:04] the one that cist was
[45:06] in yeah Ser of The Splendid way it's
[45:09] probably my favorite Lamplighter there
[45:11] but all throughout the entire Journey
[45:13] he's constantly tempted the and the enem
[45:15] is saying oh the armor is too heavy take
[45:17] off your armor oh set your shield down
[45:19] this is a time of rejoicing and there
[45:21] are and there are times of rejoicing
[45:23] right but but it's a temptation of the
[45:25] enemy to put put down the shield and and
[45:28] to not fight against him right but a
[45:31] Christian uh they're aware that the
[45:34] Bible said Satan's like a roaring lion
[45:36] seeking who whom he may devour and we
[45:39] just read there that there there's evil
[45:41] days that come upon us right there's
[45:44] some days of great peace there are some
[45:45] days of great Victory Hallelujah like we
[45:48] looked at King ASA 10 years of Peace
[45:50] Hallelujah and as I told you I feel like
[45:52] we're in a season of Peace where we've
[45:53] had five years at least five years of
[45:56] Peace Hallelujah and it's been a joy but
[45:59] we got to be careful not to be tempted
[46:00] to lay down our armor and not fight like
[46:03] God has called us to fight praise
[46:06] God uh but you know these these words uh
[46:08] just really stuck out to me so easily
[46:11] beset now the word beset in the Greek
[46:14] just means surrounded and so that word
[46:17] maybe uh maybe needs to maybe have a
[46:20] different meaning for this context
[46:21] because the Bible says we're so easily
[46:24] beset the sin which so easily besets us
[46:28] we'd say so easily surrounds us and so
[46:31] we get this idea if you look at a he
[46:33] Webster's Dictionary the word beset in
[46:35] our current language the current meaning
[46:37] means trouble or harassed we are so
[46:41] easily
[46:42] troubled we feel so easily harassed by
[46:45] sin sometimes don't we right and uh
[46:49] that's kind of what I bring out here you
[46:50] know with our human side I just want to
[46:52] just preach one message on this you know
[46:55] there so so many times when we fall into
[46:57] sin you know it it wasn't that difficult
[47:00] of a
[47:01] battle right it wasn't some elaborate
[47:04] you know the Bible says when we sin
[47:06] sometimes we're it's called a snare
[47:07] we're caught in a trap you know this
[47:08] week I caught another mouse at our house
[47:10] you know it wasn't a very elaborate trap
[47:13] I just put peanut butter and set it on
[47:15] the Trap and then I taped it down to the
[47:17] ground and just like clockwork every
[47:20] time I got him you know it wasn't very
[47:23] elaborate it wasn't you know all these
[47:25] tunnels he had to walk through or
[47:27] mirrors or smoke or fire it was just
[47:30] peanut butter just laid out and I didn't
[47:33] hide in the corner I didn't I just laid
[47:35] it right out in the middle of the
[47:37] floor and it was so easily he was so
[47:40] easily trapped or maybe it was a her I
[47:43] don't know but the point I'm making is
[47:45] that church sometimes the enemy sets out
[47:47] sets out bait for us and we're so easily
[47:50] trapped into it we don't fight it like
[47:53] we ought to now what I find find
[47:55] interesting is in the previous chapter
[47:58] Paul gives us the Hall of Fame of Faith
[48:00] praise God hallelujah and he gives us
[48:03] all these the Bible called them cloud of
[48:05] witnesses he gives us all these cloud of
[48:08] witnesses each and every each and every
[48:10] testimony that's up there praise God you
[48:12] know you look out in the sky yesterday
[48:14] uh uh we had some beautiful weather
[48:16] there you know it kind of off and on
[48:18] partly cloudy but the other day must
[48:20] have been Friday where it was such a
[48:21] beautiful day and I thought look at all
[48:22] these clouds and I was just sitting
[48:24] there and seeing them them by and that's
[48:26] what the Bible calls all the testimonies
[48:28] of all the saints there's these clouds
[48:30] all around us all we got to do is look
[48:33] up and see the the testimony of the
[48:35] Saints who've gone before us praise God
[48:37] Amen they're just covering you know many
[48:39] many times they're just covering the sky
[48:41] and that's how that's the imagery that
[48:43] Paul gives us and just just look listen
[48:46] to some of these names Abel we have
[48:48] Abel's testimony up
[48:50] there right even though my brother
[48:52] doesn't Worship in spirit and Truth I'll
[48:54] Worship in spirit and Truth
[48:56] amen even if I lose my life I'm willing
[48:59] to stand upon the word of God I'm
[49:01] willing to worship with the Revelation I
[49:03] was taught by by God almighty praise God
[49:07] Enoch he was translated that he wouldn't
[49:08] taste death he he his name means
[49:11] dedicated he was so dedicated that he
[49:13] pleased God that God took him off the
[49:15] Earth Hallelujah that's one of those
[49:17] clouds that's one of those testimonies
[49:19] up there that we can look up to and we
[49:21] can be encouraged by Enoch
[49:23] Hallelujah now we'll get some other ones
[49:25] where you know may maybe uh we see more
[49:28] of their failures
[49:29] Noah the Bible said he found Grace in
[49:32] the sight of the Lord and probably for
[49:33] 120 years he hammered away I like that
[49:36] song we used to sing Noah hammered away
[49:38] praise God he didn't give into what the
[49:39] people said praise God he caught the
[49:42] Revelation the Bible said he built 120
[49:45] years to save his house in other words
[49:47] he wasn't just doing this for himself he
[49:49] was doing it for his family and church
[49:51] that's what we should do we should serve
[49:53] God give everything we got for other
[49:55] people to serve others praise God Amen
[49:58] Hallelujah but remember here's what I
[50:00] want to bring out but then afterwards he
[50:02] was so easily beset by by
[50:05] alcohol here's a man of God he just saw
[50:08] God provide and and protect his family
[50:10] he saved eight souls he saw the rest of
[50:12] the world die but then he was so easily
[50:14] beset by getting
[50:17] drunk so easily beset it wasn't some
[50:19] elaborate it wasn't some elaborate
[50:22] deception but it was just getting too
[50:24] comfortable I we we're not given the
[50:26] whole uh we're not giv the whole details
[50:29] of the situation but think about that
[50:31] drink then he had to start feeling a
[50:34] little intoxicated right but then he had
[50:38] another and another and another and it
[50:41] actually led to one of his relatives
[50:42] being cursed right Canaan because he
[50:45] walked into Saul his father's nakedness
[50:47] now there's a couple different
[50:48] interpretations on
[50:49] that but look it was it was he's a hero
[50:52] of the faith but there was times he's
[50:54] easily beset as well easily troubled now
[50:58] maybe going through all that all the
[51:00] destruction maybe that caused him to
[51:01] drink a little extra we're not really
[51:03] given the the situation but what I'm
[51:05] saying is that in one way we can see
[51:07] them as Heroes but we also can see how
[51:09] they can easily fall remind remind you
[51:12] of anybody that you know that you might
[51:13] have looked and saw in the mirror this
[51:16] morning who could be a hero of Faith but
[51:18] also so easily
[51:22] beset and Paul doesn't say well just the
[51:25] food foolish virgins are so easy beset
[51:27] did he did he say that no he doesn't say
[51:30] that yet he taught there's the four
[51:31] kinds of vessels he taught that we can
[51:33] see that plainly taught in the
[51:35] scripture but he says let us so he's
[51:38] speaking of the whole body of Christ
[51:40] Hallelujah he says let us lay aside
[51:44] every weight and the sin which does so
[51:47] easily beset us so just so easily beset
[51:52] it wasn't it wasn't a maybe a difficult
[51:54] mind battle or or something and and in
[51:57] Noah's case you know and we'll get to
[51:58] Abraham and Sarah maybe maybe some of
[52:01] these weren't the most elaborate uh
[52:04] tricks that Satan tried to
[52:06] pull and like we'll see later some of
[52:08] these were not even life and death like
[52:10] Noah's you know getting drunk it wasn't
[52:12] even a life or death situation it was
[52:14] just do I have another drink or do I
[52:17] stop right there wasn't he wasn't being
[52:19] threatened by an enemy well if you don't
[52:21] drink this we're going to take the sword
[52:22] and we're going to end your life it
[52:24] wasn't that
[52:25] it was caught up in just the the cares
[52:28] of Life how many battle the cares of
[52:30] life sometimes let me read this again I
[52:32] found this you again this morning I was
[52:33] praying and I just in the closet and I
[52:35] just went to that I thought I look that
[52:37] up remember brother R said each age has
[52:40] its
[52:41] pressures he said the B the great burden
[52:43] of the last age is the pressure of
[52:46] riches so whenever you feel this
[52:48] pressure I've got to be rich or I need
[52:50] to be rich that's a battle you got to
[52:53] overcome the second one he says
[52:56] he says is soft living I find that to be
[52:58] the I was thinking this morning I find
[52:59] that one to be the hardest one I got to
[53:01] battle soft living in other words you're
[53:03] not really uh pressing with all you got
[53:06] you know you you lose the urgency of the
[53:08] Holy Spirit right to cease to be I'm
[53:11] saying to see people saved or how about
[53:13] this to see people healed we lose the
[53:15] urgency to really live on on fire as
[53:18] best as we possibly can I hope I'm
[53:20] communicating that the right way it's
[53:23] easier just to relax and you know know
[53:26] uh just try to relax and get ready for
[53:27] the next day right you know you want to
[53:30] be strong for the next
[53:33] day so we find that second one the third
[53:36] one nervous
[53:38] tensions you ever had that where you you
[53:40] have difficulty sleeping just worried
[53:41] about this this I had that on Friday
[53:43] night but my wife reminded me I drink
[53:45] too much coffee that's probably why I
[53:47] was up nervous but my mind was
[53:49] racing uh I think I fell finally fell
[53:51] asleep around 4:30 on on on Saturday
[53:53] morning just mind and I I went wrote
[53:56] down some thoughts in fact this is the
[53:58] some of the sermon thoughts I was going
[53:59] to preach I'm like well if I'm up I
[54:00] might as well do some notes might as
[54:02] well make some notes for the
[54:04] sermon but these are real demonic
[54:07] attacks of nervous tensions it's a
[54:09] demonic attack right soft living live
[54:13] softer live a more relaxed life and then
[54:16] you got to get rich you got to get rich
[54:18] right these are all demonic attacks for
[54:20] this age but we can overcome them praise
[54:22] God Amen Hallelujah
[54:26] the next one in this Hall of Fame this
[54:28] next cloud of witness was Abraham and
[54:30] Sarah we all we s i they have some of
[54:32] the most powerful testimonies 99 years
[54:35] old 100 years old and 70 and 90 having a
[54:39] child at 90 years old Hallelujah my
[54:43] Abraham having faith that even though
[54:45] I'm 125 I don't see it yet I'm going to
[54:47] have descendants like the numbers of the
[54:50] stars and the numbers of the sand of the
[54:51] sea that's our father of Faith praise
[54:54] God but then also so easily
[54:59] beset so easily falling into cowardice
[55:03] now brothers that's especially true for
[55:05] us right because we're supposed to be
[55:06] strong all the time and we're supposed
[55:08] to protect everybody all the time right
[55:10] Brothers but it but the reality of it is
[55:12] we're going to battle to be real strong
[55:15] and heroic right we got a Satan's
[55:17] attacking us trying to make us cowards
[55:19] like Abraham was made a
[55:22] coward is that true so he but see he was
[55:26] so easily beset now his battles were his
[55:29] battles were over the fear of life and
[55:31] death right with pharaoh and then aimc
[55:33] he was afraid they would kill him but he
[55:36] never actually had to go through that he
[55:39] said let's lie let's tell a half truth
[55:42] right man let's tell a half truth or
[55:44] let's lie because I think you see he was
[55:46] crossing Bridges before he got there
[55:48] amen he never actually you know had had
[55:51] the sword held right to him and said you
[55:53] know is she your wife or not he never
[55:55] never really had that but to avoid that
[55:57] to avoid the sword for us to avoid the
[56:00] gun or to avoid the bull bullet he lied
[56:03] and was cowardly in advance he was so
[56:05] easily beset and the sword wasn't even
[56:07] in front of him so he planned ahead to
[56:10] lie planned ahead to be a coward that's
[56:13] what brother Braham said right but we've
[56:15] all been there right we've all we've all
[56:17] fallen short of God's glory so we're not
[56:19] hammering Abraham but just bringing out
[56:21] this idea he was so easily beset but yet
[56:24] he in the Hall of
[56:26] Fame Hallelujah yet there was times
[56:29] where he showed great faith Hallelujah
[56:31] in the midst of great adversity and I
[56:33] love it again I'm going to rehearse it
[56:35] because God helped him to believe he
[56:37] couldn't believe on his own faith was a
[56:40] gift from God and faith will be a gift
[56:42] from God to you hallelujah amen God's
[56:46] going to help you believe
[56:48] Hallelujah if he helped the father you
[56:50] know he's going to help the
[56:51] children
[56:53] Hallelujah but so easily beset church so
[56:56] are we we're so easily beset on the
[56:58] pressure to be rich the pressure to live
[57:00] a soft life the pressure to be nervous
[57:04] about things all the
[57:07] time and we've got to overcome that by
[57:09] God's grace we're so easily beset at
[57:12] times and that means trouble we're so
[57:15] easily troubled so easily harassed so
[57:17] easily
[57:19] surrounded by the difficulties in our
[57:21] life think about David you know and
[57:23] basba he was so easy easily
[57:26] beset right by by the Temptation Of
[57:29] basba so easy nobody forced him to take
[57:32] her he actually called for her by name
[57:36] so easily it was so easy just to skip
[57:39] going out to war to skip the battle talk
[57:41] about soft living right so
[57:45] easily that's one I had there on my
[57:47] notes there too
[57:49] but then we see
[57:52] Moses you know a murder of course before
[57:54] his burning bush experience but even
[57:56] after the burning bush tremendous
[57:58] Miracles I mean i' we'd put his miracles
[58:00] up there with with anybody right other
[58:02] than Jesus right because nobody did more
[58:04] miracles than Jesus and even Mo Jesus
[58:07] would be a prophet like unto
[58:09] Moses parting the Red Sea I mean amazing
[58:12] things calling for plagues and uh
[58:14] calling for for Li and calling for all
[58:17] these things but there was times he was
[58:19] so easily beset remember when he smoked
[58:22] that rock the Bible said he let the
[58:24] people provoke
[58:26] him right remember in cases God never
[58:29] forces anybody to fall so it was it was
[58:32] partly Moses's fault but it was partly
[58:35] the people's
[58:36] fault right so both of them were at
[58:40] fault Moses should not have let the
[58:42] people persuade him he should have had
[58:44] courage well if you're going to be
[58:45] negative I'm going to be positive
[58:48] Hallelujah I'm not going to let your
[58:50] unbelief impact me I'm still going to
[58:52] love you even though you're not being
[58:54] very lovable right now and the church
[58:56] said right family members they're not
[58:59] being real lovable but you should still
[59:00] love them I should still love them
[59:02] praise God and I shouldn't let their
[59:05] unbelief hinder my
[59:07] faith and most of times we don't but
[59:10] there are times when we're so easily
[59:15] troubled and that's the point of this
[59:17] message I kind of want to bring those
[59:18] out so easily beset Moses was so easily
[59:22] beset at times
[59:26] but the Bible said by faith
[59:30] Moses by faith brother amen can I put
[59:32] you in there I'll put the brothers by
[59:34] faith Austin Hallelujah by faith Jose by
[59:38] faith bang next time I'll do sisters on
[59:39] the next service okay put your name in
[59:41] there by faith Malachi Zion and James
[59:44] and Andy all the men we'll put them in
[59:46] there by
[59:49] faith but we still have that we're still
[59:52] children of Faith but we're often so
[59:55] easily beset and brother B tells us well
[59:58] the Bible tells us to it too many times
[1:00:00] we fall when everything's going
[1:00:02] good right the Bible said when Israel
[1:00:04] was
[1:00:05] Idol right when they didn't have a
[1:00:07] battle to fight when they weren't
[1:00:09] praying and crying out for food when
[1:00:10] they had plenty of food when they had
[1:00:12] plenty of water when they had all these
[1:00:13] things that's when they were easily
[1:00:16] beset so we got to look at that's and
[1:00:18] that's that's what you know I believe
[1:00:19] each service has a purpose so we got to
[1:00:21] look at our our purpose today look at
[1:00:22] our condition today at the end of the
[1:00:24] service here and see what kind of
[1:00:26] condition are we in and let's make sure
[1:00:28] we're not easily
[1:00:31] beset I would say for me things are
[1:00:33] going pretty good I had a weekend off
[1:00:35] last weekend that was nice I guess I got
[1:00:37] one coming up here by God's grace so
[1:00:39] thank you very very very kind of you I
[1:00:41] appreciate that um but you know all all
[1:00:45] the bills are paid thank God hallelujah
[1:00:48] thank God food's on the table children
[1:00:50] don't lack any clothes or anything so I
[1:00:53] would say this is timely for me because
[1:00:56] I want to be seeking God I just heard
[1:00:58] heard A good sermon you know from
[1:00:59] Brother cam a fantastic message and I
[1:01:01] want to preach another message that'll
[1:01:02] bless your hearts too
[1:01:05] amen but that's where we kind of find
[1:01:08] ourselves you know in this spot where uh
[1:01:10] we have all that we have as far as I
[1:01:12] know everybody in the church has
[1:01:13] everything that they have need of and if
[1:01:15] not please let me know as a pastor
[1:01:17] that's
[1:01:18] my job I don't I don't know what I'm
[1:01:20] doing here forgive
[1:01:23] me
[1:01:25] you know and even brother brandham you
[1:01:26] know we talked about brother brandom uh
[1:01:27] many times but just let's review what
[1:01:29] did he battle with the most which Spirit
[1:01:30] did he battle with the most the critical
[1:01:34] spirit right he said those are the three
[1:01:36] he battled the most and brother said out
[1:01:38] of the three that usually get preachers
[1:01:39] women money popularity he said the one
[1:01:42] that he struggled with the most was the
[1:01:44] money he said that's why he tried to
[1:01:46] give it just all away you know as much
[1:01:48] as
[1:01:49] possible right so that gives us a good
[1:01:51] lesson whatever thing we struggle with
[1:01:53] the most let's put the most effort in to
[1:01:55] make sure we don't give into it praise
[1:01:58] God but according to him the one he said
[1:02:01] the one I struggle the most is the
[1:02:02] critical
[1:02:04] spirit so you know looking at others
[1:02:07] I'll say that you know just looking at
[1:02:08] others and being more judgmental than we
[1:02:11] should does in the Bible say uh let your
[1:02:14] words be seasoned with
[1:02:17] Grace that's why you know I've got to I
[1:02:19] want to say that too about you know the
[1:02:20] Brandon family like I said you know I
[1:02:22] want to be uh you know my my wife helped
[1:02:24] me I was talking to her about it and she
[1:02:26] kind of just brought that Grace and I
[1:02:28] was like thank you for the reminder
[1:02:30] thank you for the
[1:02:31] reminder because we have to season our
[1:02:34] words with
[1:02:35] Grace I find it very similar I think
[1:02:37] that's a i i battle that as well a
[1:02:39] critical spirit
[1:02:41] sometimes and I feel like as as message
[1:02:44] Believers we can't help but battle that
[1:02:46] because we we know more about the word
[1:02:48] of God right we we know more but that
[1:02:52] also that makes us uh uh gives us more
[1:02:55] opportunity but it also makes us more
[1:02:57] responsible right and it also makes us
[1:03:00] more accountable to God remember the
[1:03:02] teachers the preachers will be judged
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] harshest right and then and then as as I
[1:03:08] preach and as our preachers preach
[1:03:09] brother Brian and all the saints it
[1:03:11] makes us more
[1:03:13] accountable so I thought it'd be helpful
[1:03:15] to share this thought here uh by the
[1:03:17] grace of
[1:03:19] God and then after Moses you know goes
[1:03:22] into Joshua and Israel
[1:03:26] and Joshua was a very wonderful type of
[1:03:29] Christ uh and remember we only have a
[1:03:31] couple times where Joshua was ever
[1:03:33] recorded as falling short and the one
[1:03:35] time Joshua fell short is the one time
[1:03:37] he didn't go ask God about
[1:03:39] it right so it encouraged us let's pray
[1:03:43] about each and every decision let's pray
[1:03:46] about every decision let's lay it before
[1:03:48] the Lord and that's what I kind of felt
[1:03:50] L after hearing cam sermon I told my
[1:03:52] children I said I want to pray for all
[1:03:53] the youth tonight so after the Bible
[1:03:54] study I want each youth person to come
[1:03:56] up and let's just pray God's blessing on
[1:03:58] them especially for the older ones
[1:04:00] getting older here because they got big
[1:04:02] decisions coming up and I want to pray
[1:04:03] now before the the evil days come well
[1:04:06] let's hope there's no big evil days as
[1:04:08] far as you know I'm talking about really
[1:04:09] awful trials or difficult trials I want
[1:04:13] to pray for them now by God's grace I
[1:04:15] want to make more time for prayer now
[1:04:16] while I
[1:04:20] can and so uh and then you know the
[1:04:22] Bible goes into other Heroes of the
[1:04:24] Faith Like Rahab now of course she got
[1:04:26] converted we don't know of any mistakes
[1:04:27] she made afterwards where she was so
[1:04:29] easily beset but here we got Gideon and
[1:04:31] Sams of Hebrews 11 Gideon and Samson
[1:04:34] Gideon was was Mighty after a great
[1:04:37] Victory he took too many wives he set up
[1:04:40] that uh he set up something and become
[1:04:42] an idol to the people forget what it was
[1:04:45] now slip in my mind book of life I just
[1:04:47] Tex texted Z about that this morning
[1:04:49] amen every person that really believes
[1:04:51] their names at least in The Book of Life
[1:04:54] but God's other section it's called the
[1:04:56] Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the
[1:04:58] people that were truly washed in the
[1:05:00] blood their entire lives completely
[1:05:05] scriptural but we see even Samson and we
[1:05:08] went through his mistakes a few weeks
[1:05:09] ago when we preached once more Lord but
[1:05:11] even he was placed in the Hall of Fame
[1:05:13] of faith yet he was so easily beset by
[1:05:16] women right how about by anger when he
[1:05:20] went and killed all those
[1:05:21] Philistines together set them on fire
[1:05:23] you know he was really
[1:05:25] angry anybody ever battle temper you
[1:05:27] don't have to raise your hand anybody
[1:05:28] battle anybody ever battle
[1:05:32] temper and sometimes you know we're so
[1:05:35] easy beset you know I was I I love I
[1:05:38] love though the seasons where you look
[1:05:39] back and you C you kind of like wake up
[1:05:41] from the Victory and you're like wow God
[1:05:43] has given me Grace I've overcome that
[1:05:45] all week i' I haven't struggled with
[1:05:47] that for a few weeks or my I haven't
[1:05:48] struggled with that for a year amen is't
[1:05:51] that beautiful and that's ought to be an
[1:05:52] encouragement God has given me strength
[1:05:54] in other words I've been putting on the
[1:05:55] armor of God hallelujah I've been
[1:05:57] holding the shield I've been uh uh the
[1:06:00] Bible says uh taking every fiery Dart
[1:06:02] hallelujah amen quenching there it is
[1:06:05] that's the word I was looking for
[1:06:06] quenching every fiery Dart every every
[1:06:08] trial that's come that's come I've been
[1:06:10] able to quench it by the shield of Faith
[1:06:12] hallelujah amen
[1:06:16] amen and that's what I like to do church
[1:06:18] I like to look at my life and say wow
[1:06:20] thank God you to reflect on that and say
[1:06:22] thank you Jesus so easily and you're
[1:06:24] think I just danced at church now that
[1:06:26] would be for me or whoever likes to
[1:06:27] dance I just danced at church or I just
[1:06:29] wept at the altar I just prayed for that
[1:06:31] or we just had a testimony and then we
[1:06:33] can be so easily beset not long after I
[1:06:36] just want you to know that's the normal
[1:06:38] Christian experience amen don't let the
[1:06:41] devil tell you you're not a part of
[1:06:42] Christ we are a part of Christ amen but
[1:06:45] this flesh won't be until it gets
[1:06:47] swallowed up amen hallelujah and it's
[1:06:49] going to be this body will be swallowed
[1:06:51] up in life Hallelujah this body is
[1:06:54] filled with death right now but one day
[1:06:56] this body will be filled with eternal
[1:06:58] life amen hallelujah this is the normal
[1:07:01] Christian experience overcoming Faith uh
[1:07:05] quenching the fiery darts but then we so
[1:07:07] easily get
[1:07:09] beset so easily troubled and this is not
[1:07:12] you know just for certain people this is
[1:07:14] for all Christians we can especially see
[1:07:17] it you know brother R's life because he
[1:07:19] told us
[1:07:22] right and so and can especially so see
[1:07:25] it in our lives and maybe in one
[1:07:27] another's
[1:07:28] lives but we don't want to focus on the
[1:07:31] negative so much but we just want to
[1:07:32] recognize this is part of the Christian
[1:07:35] experience
[1:07:38] Hallelujah and so you know the book of
[1:07:41] Hebrews 11 ends that
[1:07:43] way and these men you know they were
[1:07:45] they had such a testimony the Bible said
[1:07:47] the world was not worthy of them I gave
[1:07:50] that example of you know Andy and Eileen
[1:07:52] and you know Drive in two hours to bring
[1:07:55] us a truckload of frozen food when we
[1:07:57] had I think it was
[1:07:58] Caris and a whole I mean the whole back
[1:08:01] of the truck was filled with frozen food
[1:08:03] and we just had enough room in the
[1:08:05] freezer you know and and I thought well
[1:08:08] to me to me that was a great sacrifice
[1:08:11] and I started crying and I and we had
[1:08:14] all that room in the freezer we we must
[1:08:15] have just got the freezer but I think of
[1:08:18] that of whom the world was not worthy
[1:08:20] Christians uh you know we are the salt
[1:08:23] of the earth
[1:08:25] the whole world all the Sinners have no
[1:08:27] salt they have no taste they have no
[1:08:28] real experience of Love or no real
[1:08:31] experience of of any type of of
[1:08:33] Christian character but you and I have
[1:08:35] it praise God and the world's not worthy
[1:08:37] of it praise God it's
[1:08:40] not the Bible said they subdued kingdoms
[1:08:43] they wrought righteousness they obtained
[1:08:45] promises amen they stopped the mouths of
[1:08:47] lions they quenched the violence of fire
[1:08:50] they escaped the edge of the sword out
[1:08:52] of weakness were made strong
[1:08:54] vax I'm sorry waxed Valiant in fight
[1:08:56] turned to flight the armies of the
[1:08:58] aliens women received their dead raised
[1:09:00] to life again others were tortured not
[1:09:02] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:09:03] attain a better Resurrection others had
[1:09:06] Trials of cruel mockings and
[1:09:09] scourgings uh bonds and imprisonment
[1:09:11] some went to jail some were stoned some
[1:09:13] were under tempted slain with the sword
[1:09:17] they wandered around and sheep skins and
[1:09:18] goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:09:20] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:09:23] worthy they wandered in deserts and
[1:09:25] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:09:26] earth and after and these all having
[1:09:29] obtained a good report through faith
[1:09:30] Reed not the promise because not perfect
[1:09:34] the entire body without us as well
[1:09:37] praise God now listen they didn't live
[1:09:39] in Lea we do we can look to this
[1:09:42] spiritually and we can see we've got to
[1:09:44] overcome all the spiritual obstacles
[1:09:46] that we Face praise God hallelujah we've
[1:09:50] got to overcome that we're the age where
[1:09:52] where Paul users a wax word worse and
[1:09:54] worse so we're in an age it's the living
[1:09:57] see where we're where we're at by God's
[1:09:59] grace and then overcome with the word of
[1:10:01] God
[1:10:03] hallelujah amen and remember God steps
[1:10:05] to strength we looked at it in uh in
[1:10:07] Joshua 1 Step One is repent and be
[1:10:10] humble number two is and number three is
[1:10:12] keep all the commands constantly
[1:10:15] speaking and meditating upon them and
[1:10:17] that's that's where the Joshua Army the
[1:10:20] Joshua church will stay strong by doing
[1:10:23] those three things praise God I think
[1:10:24] it's interesting brother R list three
[1:10:26] trials in leoa but then we in Joshua we
[1:10:28] can see three steps to be strong praise
[1:10:30] God I think it's interesting don't you
[1:10:36] Hallelujah you know I uh I want to read
[1:10:38] a couple things here also Lord I wrote
[1:10:41] down numerous
[1:10:43] uh thoughts I want to let's go to
[1:10:45] Hebrews 12 now I just want to go into a
[1:10:46] few of these make sure I preach these I
[1:10:49] kind of felt inspired
[1:10:51] here verse one Hebrews 12 1 wherefore
[1:10:54] seeing we also are compassed about with
[1:10:56] so a great cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:10:59] aside every weight and the sin which
[1:11:01] does so easily beset us and let us run
[1:11:03] with patience the race that is set
[1:11:04] before us I just want to bring out a
[1:11:07] simple illustration okay every some of
[1:11:09] you remember when Malachi and Austin and
[1:11:10] I were racing out there you remember
[1:11:12] that it's a day I wish I could
[1:11:17] forget but you know we got out there on
[1:11:19] the line right we stretched out and then
[1:11:21] we started running we were running
[1:11:22] pretty fast
[1:11:24] at any time did you ever see one of us
[1:11:26] you know stop and and pick up a big rock
[1:11:28] or something and try to run with that
[1:11:30] did anybody ever see us do
[1:11:31] that no we I might even took off my
[1:11:34] jacket you know I I might have even got
[1:11:35] on some different shoes you know in
[1:11:37] other words you just lay everything
[1:11:39] aside so you can try to win the
[1:11:42] race and so I just thought you know I
[1:11:43] was praying up here I thought now what
[1:11:45] if I would have went down there and I
[1:11:46] would I said okay brothers let's run
[1:11:48] this race now on your mark get set I I
[1:11:52] don't have much room here go
[1:11:54] and I try to run with that what kind of
[1:11:55] Runner do you think I'd be you think I'd
[1:11:57] win nature no I didn't even win the
[1:12:00] first time how am I going to run with
[1:12:02] this this this great weight and church
[1:12:05] this is spiritually what's going on
[1:12:06] we're seeing other people run the RAC
[1:12:08] now sometimes we're running it the right
[1:12:10] way we're going good we're we're tearing
[1:12:12] it up you know we're we're making some
[1:12:13] good splits you know we we're sweating
[1:12:15] we're having a good race but there's
[1:12:17] sometimes where we pick up a burden that
[1:12:20] we shouldn't have to
[1:12:21] carry God didn't call us to carry that
[1:12:25] burden so imagine just picture your mind
[1:12:27] out there imagine me trying to race come
[1:12:29] on malkey I mean I wouldn't be looking
[1:12:30] back I'd be looking forth come on wait
[1:12:31] up
[1:12:32] Malachi right we'd be trying to run a
[1:12:35] race with this big huge burden the Bible
[1:12:38] said don't try to run with the burdens
[1:12:41] the Bible said lay aside the
[1:12:44] burdens lay aside picture that uh you
[1:12:48] know we've all been to races you ever
[1:12:49] see a racer get on his backpack and well
[1:12:52] let's race now with this backpack on
[1:12:54] well now they basically strip them down
[1:12:55] right you know basically have them wear
[1:12:58] short shorts and tank tops they try to
[1:13:00] get as much weight off as
[1:13:02] possible that's a natural thing but it's
[1:13:05] it's showing us a spiritual truth the
[1:13:07] Bible says lay it all aside and run the
[1:13:10] race with perseverance how many want to
[1:13:13] how many want to win the race by God's
[1:13:15] grace well then it's clear we've got to
[1:13:17] lay
[1:13:18] aside not some weights but every weight
[1:13:22] praise God Amen
[1:13:24] Hallelujah lay aside every
[1:13:27] weight every year when I go in for my uh
[1:13:30] my annual checkup at the doctor over
[1:13:32] there in green I go see the dror saers
[1:13:34] in green I always want to know my real
[1:13:36] weight so I'll make sure I take off you
[1:13:37] know my shoes and my I got a jacket on a
[1:13:40] sweatshirt and I'll even empty out my
[1:13:42] pockets now think about that I'll take
[1:13:43] out my pen my I'll take off my watch
[1:13:45] I'll take off my phone I want to know
[1:13:47] the exact way I want to I want the I
[1:13:49] want the precise way have I lived a
[1:13:51] healthy year or not you know that's kind
[1:13:53] of what I want to know where am I at
[1:13:55] compared to last year and I I'll I'll
[1:13:58] lay aside every I'll take everything out
[1:14:00] I'll take my shoes off I don't want any
[1:14:02] extra weight I want to know the exact
[1:14:04] weight now that should be a great lesson
[1:14:06] for us spiritually as well praise God I
[1:14:09] don't want any extra weight holding me
[1:14:11] down I want to know exactly where I
[1:14:13] stand praise God that's what we see here
[1:14:16] and it's and that's the illustration we
[1:14:19] see all these Cloud man there is the
[1:14:22] illustration is we're running and we can
[1:14:24] look up and we can be encouraged we can
[1:14:25] look at Samson's testimony by faith he
[1:14:28] he fulfilled God's promise for his life
[1:14:30] in his very last breaths even though he
[1:14:33] had to wait till the very end of his
[1:14:34] life God still helped him to fulfill
[1:14:36] every promise for his life amen despite
[1:14:39] times of failure despite times of
[1:14:41] embarrassment despite times of being so
[1:14:44] easily beset he became a cloud
[1:14:47] Hallelujah he became a witness that we
[1:14:49] can all look to and say God's not
[1:14:51] finished with me yet praise God
[1:14:53] Hallelujah despite any fears despite any
[1:14:55] trials he's not done with me God's word
[1:14:58] will be fulfilled praise God
[1:15:00] Amen and so the Bible tells us to run
[1:15:03] but keep looking
[1:15:04] up look at all those testimonies oh if
[1:15:07] they did it I can do it too praise God
[1:15:09] am and lay aside any weight that easily
[1:15:13] besets us so for brother bam he had to
[1:15:15] lay aside the critical
[1:15:17] spirit he said one time he said I'm
[1:15:19] coming to the pulpit with a critical
[1:15:21] spirit pray for me that I'll lay it in
[1:15:23] other words pray for me that I'll lay it
[1:15:24] aside my goodness
[1:15:26] Hallelujah pray for me that I'll lay
[1:15:28] aside now I'll say like this you know
[1:15:31] with these these families and the
[1:15:32] message of the lost people they probably
[1:15:34] got to lay aside some confusion and pain
[1:15:37] you imagine they lost their mother she's
[1:15:40] 44 or they lost their their father he
[1:15:42] was 88 and the enemy is going to try to
[1:15:45] say take up this get bitter towards God
[1:15:48] and they're they're saying why did you
[1:15:50] take my mom why imagine they were
[1:15:51] tempted to run with the weight and God's
[1:15:54] saying don't please don't take up that
[1:15:57] weight it's hard I'm not saying it's
[1:16:00] easy I'm saying even in a situation like
[1:16:02] that with death the enemy is tempting
[1:16:05] he's trying to easily beset people well
[1:16:07] God owes me something or God should not
[1:16:09] have done that that's a Temptation
[1:16:12] that's a trap that's a snare to try to
[1:16:14] get somebody to run
[1:16:17] inhibited we want to run a race without
[1:16:19] any inhibitions praise God we want to
[1:16:22] run free Hallelujah we want to be free
[1:16:24] and clear
[1:16:26] Hallelujah the deodorant laundry picked
[1:16:28] that up free and clear well that's how a
[1:16:29] Christian is amen we always my wife
[1:16:31] always tells me well I used to tell me
[1:16:33] buy the Free and Clear Laundry I said
[1:16:35] that's what I am that's what I'm a
[1:16:36] Christian I'm free in the Holy Spirit
[1:16:38] and my account is clear amen hallelujah
[1:16:41] all my sins been washed away praise God
[1:16:43] hallelujah I'm free the son has made me
[1:16:46] free indeed
[1:16:50] Hallelujah so I just thought I'd
[1:16:52] demonstrate that you could see that this
[1:16:54] is what God wants us to do he doesn't
[1:16:56] want us to run with
[1:16:59] burdens and I'm talking about sinful
[1:17:01] burdens I'm not talking about I've got a
[1:17:03] burden to see my dad saved you know we
[1:17:04] got burden to see our dad's and you know
[1:17:06] our mother saved that's that's all good
[1:17:08] those are all good burdens that that's
[1:17:10] not what it's talking about it's about a
[1:17:11] sin that easily entraps
[1:17:13] you so brother Ram told us he was easily
[1:17:17] uh trapped or easily entrapped with
[1:17:19] critical spirit right Samson easily
[1:17:22] trapped by L
[1:17:24] right and each person you know uh
[1:17:27] Abraham easily entrapped by being afraid
[1:17:30] fearful
[1:17:31] coward that was just something he easily
[1:17:33] fell
[1:17:34] into right but God was faithful through
[1:17:37] it all I love this you know God would
[1:17:39] always make a way out of their mistakes
[1:17:41] Hallelujah now they'd have to live with
[1:17:43] their mistakes like David that was was
[1:17:45] one of the most awful ones because once
[1:17:47] murder and things there's you know the
[1:17:49] sword would never leave his house in
[1:17:50] other words that was a really awful
[1:17:52] mistake right there
[1:17:54] but even in that David said I know
[1:17:56] blessed is a man whom God will not
[1:17:58] impute sin
[1:18:01] Hallelujah and God gives the remedy for
[1:18:03] that go to Psalm 32:5 therea Psalm 32:5
[1:18:06] God gives the remedy I'm sorry that's me
[1:18:08] I don't moving this wire
[1:18:13] so Psalm
[1:18:16] 32:5 see we have to acknowledge the
[1:18:18] times we've so easily given into sin we
[1:18:21] just have to acknowledge it and then lay
[1:18:23] it
[1:18:25] aside
[1:18:28] right people you know I I've had to do
[1:18:30] this I've had to lay aside you know
[1:18:32] hatred for my dad I told you that in the
[1:18:34] past I've just got to lay it aside I
[1:18:35] can't I can't hang on to
[1:18:38] that
[1:18:40] right and whatever we may battle you
[1:18:42] know lay aside disappointments or like I
[1:18:45] said with Samson lay aside
[1:18:46] lust L lay aside uh doubts or anger like
[1:18:50] we said earlier somebody really angry
[1:18:52] they just
[1:18:54] they're tempted to be angry those just
[1:18:55] have to be laid aside and I'm not going
[1:18:57] to hang on to this anger because we got
[1:18:58] a choice
[1:18:59] church I'm not going to hang on to this
[1:19:02] I'm going to lay it aside I'm going to
[1:19:03] run for
[1:19:05] Jesus I acknowledge my sin unto thee I
[1:19:08] acknowledge that I carried this burden
[1:19:10] this burden of
[1:19:12] sin I acknowledg I had a critical spirit
[1:19:15] Lord and my iniquity have I not hid I
[1:19:18] told the Lord all about my
[1:19:20] sin I said I will confess my
[1:19:23] transgression unto the Lord and thou

[1:19:31] very simple I acknowledge it it was my I
[1:19:33] knew better I should not have done it it

[1:22:51] eye picking up all the light giving us
[1:22:54] the the and brother Brian preach on
[1:22:55] Focus didn't he preach on focus is that

[1:23:02] hallelujah God will instruct us verse n
[1:23:06] be not as the horse or as the mule which
[1:23:09] have no understanding whose mouth must

[1:24:40] sins
[1:24:41] Hallelujah heyen ah it's beautiful just
[1:24:44] to see it laid out there plainly in
[1:24:48] scripture now brother cam brought out
[1:24:50] the Deeds of nickan going to a few of
[1:24:52] those
[1:24:53] uh scriptures out here go to Romans
[1:24:55] Revelation Chapter
[1:25:02] 2 Revelation Chapter
[1:25:11] 2 now it's in verse six is where I want
[1:25:13] to look at there Revelation 2 verse6
[1:25:16] this is the message to the Ephesian
[1:25:18] Church
[1:25:19] age and I just want to bring this out
[1:25:21] there was a four-step
[1:25:23] uh you remember the four step process
[1:25:25] through the first four Church ages but I
[1:25:26] thought it was applicable for
[1:25:30] us it says but this thou Hast that thou
[1:25:33] hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I
[1:25:36] also hate now remember the word nicolan
[1:25:40] means to conquer the
[1:25:41] leoty so Jesus hates when the Ley are
[1:25:45] taken out of the anointing of the Holy
[1:25:47] Spirit and all the anointings just in
[1:25:49] the preacher that's the main that's the
[1:25:51] main emphasis brother R puts on that
[1:25:54] scripture right the preachers are the
[1:25:56] only ones with gifts the preachers are
[1:25:57] the only one with power oh that's the
[1:25:59] biggest bunch of nonsense praise God
[1:26:01] everybody's got power here amen
[1:26:03] everybody's got faith here
[1:26:05] hallelujah God's done uh miracles in
[1:26:07] everybody's life Hallelujah we still got
[1:26:09] Jose's testimony record and brother bang
[1:26:11] you know for the podcast by God's grace
[1:26:13] we just finished my wife's this week
[1:26:15] here and so we and Z yeah we all want to
[1:26:18] yeah maybe be at too if she wants to I
[1:26:20] go she's m
[1:26:24] you're welcome
[1:26:25] to but it's it's this uh it's everybody
[1:26:29] has a part in the ministry of God
[1:26:32] hallelujah everybody everyone uh should
[1:26:34] be led by the Holy Spirit to do
[1:26:36] something for God like I feel led to
[1:26:38] preach I feel led to Pastor feel led to
[1:26:40] pray for the sick I I feel led to do
[1:26:42] those things each one of us should feel
[1:26:44] led to do something praise God don't
[1:26:46] matter what it is it just matters that
[1:26:47] you're led to do it praise God and then
[1:26:50] you do it the best that you possibly can
[1:26:52] for God's
[1:26:53] glory okay but uh some of the examples
[1:26:56] uh and you know or let me just go
[1:26:58] through the remember there's four steps
[1:26:59] in the first four Church ages these
[1:27:01] things that Jesus hates starts out as
[1:27:03] Deeds which means they're not doctrines
[1:27:05] yet they're just sayings brother Ram
[1:27:07] says he says they move away from the
[1:27:10] Holy Ghost leadership and they take
[1:27:12] man's
[1:27:13] leadership okay so anything that was a
[1:27:17] deed okay now brother Ram gave a few
[1:27:19] examples he gave it from early church
[1:27:21] history when the Jewish Christians were
[1:27:23] kicked out of Rome in the first century
[1:27:26] I think they were gone 14 years when
[1:27:27] they came back the Gentile Roman Church
[1:27:30] was totally
[1:27:31] different when they got back they were
[1:27:33] they were baptizing
[1:27:36] babies they had the Eucharist
[1:27:39] already the history says that when they
[1:27:41] got back they had images of some of the
[1:27:44] Apostles set
[1:27:45] up now know where's the in between now H
[1:27:51] how did you go from you know communion
[1:27:53] was just a symbol to now this is
[1:27:54] actually the body of the Lord this is
[1:27:57] actually this cup is actually the blood
[1:27:59] of the
[1:28:00] Lord see it started off as just as
[1:28:02] saying well there there's there's more
[1:28:04] power in this bread there's more power
[1:28:05] in this wine than what you think but it
[1:28:08] slowly over time goes from a saying and
[1:28:10] it turns into a Doctrine now the reason
[1:28:13] this is
[1:28:14] important is because these things start
[1:28:16] creeping up Among
[1:28:18] Us right for example here's some common
[1:28:21] ones people say say oh if you believe
[1:28:23] brother's a prophet you've got the holy
[1:28:25] ghost that started off as a saying but
[1:28:28] now it's a it's a Doctrine a lot of
[1:28:31] churches
[1:28:34] right that's one of them okay the other
[1:28:37] one is uh we talked about uh Prosperity
[1:28:40] Gospel God always wants to heal and God
[1:28:43] wants everybody Rich that's not in the
[1:28:45] Bible it starts it starts off as a say
[1:28:48] and that's a saying now amongst a lot of
[1:28:50] message people and and even with these
[1:28:52] recent deaths it ought to be obvious to
[1:28:54] them that God doesn't always
[1:28:57] heal you got to find the will of God
[1:29:00] hallelujah but if they're not careful
[1:29:02] it's become a Doctrine and look at where
[1:29:05] look at where that's got Benny hin it's
[1:29:07] a Doctrine for Kenneth copelan you know
[1:29:09] it's a Doctrine for them now but it
[1:29:11] starts off as a deed just a
[1:29:14] saying and so we got to be very mindful
[1:29:16] that we watch these things and we don't
[1:29:17] let them come to the church because it
[1:29:19] just easily besets people it's just
[1:29:22] easier to say if you believe brother
[1:29:24] ad's a prophet you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:25] it's easier than saying let's come up to
[1:29:26] the Altar and let's really pray about it
[1:29:29] it's a lot easier oh you got the Holy
[1:29:30] Ghost you're born in the message family
[1:29:32] uh you love brother Ram God loves you
[1:29:35] it's way easier than somebody searching
[1:29:38] out their life and say do I really
[1:29:39] believe this do I have Christ in my
[1:29:41] heart am I really manifesting Jesus do I
[1:29:43] believe all this with all my heart and
[1:29:45] God like brother said beat me and let me
[1:29:47] rot out so you can fill me with the Holy
[1:29:49] Ghost amen it's a lot easier just have a
[1:29:52] deed or just a saying Well everybody's
[1:29:54] already got the Holy Ghost it's a lot
[1:29:58] easier it's easy religion and that
[1:30:01] conquers the lady it takes them it takes
[1:30:03] the hunger for the Holy Ghost the
[1:30:05] seeking the Holy Ghost it takes it out
[1:30:06] of the people and it so easily besets
[1:30:09] churches oh just push play and Obey
[1:30:11] that's so easy now the preacher don't
[1:30:13] got to study you don't got to pray you
[1:30:15] don't got to study the word of God it
[1:30:17] but it so easily besets people if
[1:30:20] they're not careful I'm glad don't beset
[1:30:22] me praise God and I'm glad you all like
[1:30:24] to say Amen to my preaching because that
[1:30:25] encourages me everybody was falling
[1:30:26] asleep and not saying amen I might
[1:30:28] consider pressing play I'm just kidding
[1:30:31] I'm just
[1:30:31] kidding but you understand you know
[1:30:33] these they start off as sayings now I
[1:30:36] this is what I told Brother cam I now
[1:30:38] the the first step is Deeds then it
[1:30:40] becomes Doctrine in the second Church
[1:30:41] age then it become the doctrine of balum
[1:30:43] in the Third Church age then it became
[1:30:45] Jezebel religion in the fourth Church
[1:30:46] age which was the depths of
[1:30:48] Satan Okay so
[1:30:52] I believe this a real child of God can
[1:30:54] only be tempted into the Deeds he'll
[1:30:58] never make it a Doctrine she'll never
[1:30:59] make it a Doctrine and that's because of
[1:31:01] God's grace in their
[1:31:03] lives in other words he won't let a holy
[1:31:05] ghost filled Saint have false Doctrine
[1:31:07] because it's like leaven right and the
[1:31:11] clearest example was Peter when he
[1:31:13] wouldn't eat with the Gentiles that's
[1:31:14] the clearest
[1:31:15] example we don't have any Scripture
[1:31:18] where he wrote he never wrote it in his
[1:31:19] letters right uh Jews shall not eat with
[1:31:21] Gentiles he it never became a Doctrine
[1:31:23] it just became a saying well they're not
[1:31:26] as clean as us what let's just after
[1:31:28] church let's just go over eat out here
[1:31:30] and we'll let the Gentiles go eat over
[1:31:32] there but was that sin did God hate that
[1:31:35] yes God hated so much he sent Paul in
[1:31:37] there he said you're to be blamed
[1:31:39] Hallelujah you're separating yourself it
[1:31:41] became a deed so so it's clear Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost filled Believers can get the wrong
[1:31:46] Deeds they can get the wrong habits the
[1:31:48] wrong traditions and the church said so
[1:31:50] we're not immune to that we're not we're
[1:31:52] not immune to battling the Antichrist
[1:31:54] Spirit we'll always battle the
[1:31:55] Antichrist spirit and there are many
[1:31:57] Antichrist if there were many Antichrist
[1:31:59] in Paul's days how many antichrists are
[1:32:01] there today but thank God there's a
[1:32:03] Christ here hallelujah oh there might be
[1:32:06] many of them but as long as we got
[1:32:08] Christ that's all that matters praise
[1:32:09] God we're more than conquerors in Christ
[1:32:12] Jesus
[1:32:14] Hallelujah but it's just something to be
[1:32:15] mindful because that's what we've seen
[1:32:17] these Deeds quickly become
[1:32:20] doctrines right just push play and as
[1:32:23] though that they said a onean Ministry
[1:32:25] in other words we don't need preachers
[1:32:27] how quickly that went from a deed to now
[1:32:29] it's a
[1:32:31] Doctrine now what's next Church the
[1:32:33] doctrine of balam we all the
[1:32:36] same remember Israel was all the same
[1:32:38] with the
[1:32:39] moabites well that's the next step if
[1:32:41] they don't get their Doctrine their
[1:32:43] false Doctrine cleaned up then they're
[1:32:44] just going to be the same as Catholics
[1:32:45] the same as Luther and Methodist all
[1:32:47] that the last step Jezebel killed the uh
[1:32:50] the the how many four 400 prophets did
[1:32:52] how many prophets did Jezebel kill lots
[1:32:54] of them she killed many
[1:32:57] prophets and so see that's the
[1:32:59] progression and I'm trying to just apply
[1:33:01] that to show that that all of us will
[1:33:04] sometimes lay down the armor and will be
[1:33:06] easily so easily think about that I I
[1:33:09] just was emphasizing that word not just
[1:33:11] easily beset but so
[1:33:14] easily like that little illustration of
[1:33:16] catching the mouth it was so easy it
[1:33:18] took me what two minutes Kristen already
[1:33:20] got the peanut butter for me I just put
[1:33:23] it on there tape it down go to sleep
[1:33:25] open the door there's the mouse it's
[1:33:27] happened like that four or five times in
[1:33:28] a row and church we're if we're so if
[1:33:31] we're so easily tempted just by
[1:33:33] something like this just pick it up and
[1:33:34] sin we got to we got to search Our Lives
[1:33:36] praise God if we're so easily ens snared
[1:33:39] we really got to search Our Lives
[1:33:41] whether it's a phone or whether it's a
[1:33:43] certain relationship whatever it is a
[1:33:46] spirit we got to be so concerned if
[1:33:49] we're so easily deceived
[1:33:52] or so willingly disobedient into sin and
[1:33:55] the church
[1:33:56] said so easily
[1:33:59] beset those three words really just
[1:34:01] jumped out to me at on the when I was
[1:34:04] studying
[1:34:05] there
[1:34:10] Hallelujah sorry about that brother Ram
[1:34:12] said Satan is a genius at his job I put
[1:34:15] that video out a couple weeks ago about
[1:34:16] the dumb devil statement which I don't
[1:34:17] agree with that's not a smart thing to
[1:34:19] do call the devil dumb even the angels
[1:34:22] of God wouldn't do
[1:34:23] that but Satan is a genius and yet
[1:34:26] sometimes the Trap is so obvious we just
[1:34:29] give into it because we're tired we're
[1:34:32] frustrated we just want some pleasure
[1:34:36] right the Bible said sin is pleasurable
[1:34:37] for
[1:34:38] season we just want some pleasure we've
[1:34:41] forgotten the joy of the Lord the
[1:34:43] pleasure of the
[1:34:45] Lord cam cam brought out that scripture
[1:34:48] I think it was Psalm chapter 1 his
[1:34:49] Delight is in the law of the Lord yes
[1:34:51] yeah Psalm 1 vers2 it's a beautiful
[1:34:54] scripture but his Delight is in the law
[1:34:56] of the Lord and his light do he meditate
[1:34:58] day and night God help us
[1:35:00] amen God help us to make our greatest
[1:35:03] Delight is thinking about the word
[1:35:05] thinking about the Mysteries God had
[1:35:07] brother Brandon finished amen hallelujah
[1:35:10] thinking about the gifts of the Holy
[1:35:11] Spirit the power of God we will see
[1:35:13] Miracles amen thinking about all these
[1:35:15] promisees of God the child of God who's
[1:35:17] planted by rivers of water is very
[1:35:19] fruitful because his Delight is in the
[1:35:22] word of God hallelujah amen let's make
[1:35:25] the word of God our greatest
[1:35:28] Delight
[1:35:31] Hallelujah but there are times like we
[1:35:33] said easily be
[1:35:36] beset and brother R made this quote in
[1:35:39] the Rapture Sermon Just a couple weeks
[1:35:40] before he
[1:35:42] passed he said I don't try to get up
[1:35:45] here to the pulpit and say something I
[1:35:46] think would please the
[1:35:48] people I've never been guilty of that so
[1:35:50] brother uses that word please in a
[1:35:52] negative way now I want you to be
[1:35:54] pleased with the sermon in that you know
[1:35:55] it's scriptural and it helps you but
[1:35:57] brother I'm saying don't try to please
[1:35:59] the people with a sinful thing don't
[1:36:01] just preach what they want to hear
[1:36:03] preach them the
[1:36:05] truth that's why I've got to preach
[1:36:06] against sin because I know I'm battling
[1:36:08] sin I'm sure you're battling sin how
[1:36:09] many battling sin out there right you
[1:36:11] still need all your armor pieces
[1:36:13] everybody need the armor of God still
[1:36:15] the devil hasn't stopped attacking you
[1:36:18] you you went through a whole week and
[1:36:19] there's no trials no tests no tempt
[1:36:21] no we still need the armor of God
[1:36:23] hallelujah he said I've never been
[1:36:25] guilty of that trying to please the
[1:36:27] people I want to get up here and say
[1:36:28] something as I feel led to say it that I
[1:36:31] think would be a help to you something
[1:36:32] that would further your experience with
[1:36:34] God if you are a Christian amen that's
[1:36:37] what I want I want you to have a a
[1:36:38] further experience with God and the
[1:36:41] experience I want you and I to have is
[1:36:42] that tomorrow we will not be so easily
[1:36:45] beset by
[1:36:46] sin in other words we'll stay stronger
[1:36:49] in our faith and we won't give into sin
[1:36:51] like we may have yesterday or last
[1:36:55] week right we're more determined not to
[1:36:58] be easily troubled by things I'll just
[1:37:01] be honest you know I uh I it seems like
[1:37:03] I I always battle you know is this the
[1:37:05] time of the Rapture is this the squeeze
[1:37:06] I always battle fear of that you
[1:37:08] know and so that that's an area where
[1:37:10] I've got to see more victory in my life
[1:37:12] and I believe I am by God's
[1:37:14] grace about ready to pick that my mic
[1:37:17] up you know that's that's something
[1:37:20] personally in my life where I want to
[1:37:22] see a victory in my life I want to not
[1:37:25] be so easily beset I want to hear the
[1:37:27] news and say that's fine Jesus is coming
[1:37:29] back anyway praise God I'm G to make
[1:37:31] myself ready the bride makes herself
[1:37:33] ready praise
[1:37:36] God so brother man wants to further your
[1:37:38] experience with God when he preached he
[1:37:41] says and if you're not a Christian make
[1:37:42] you so ashamed of yourself that you'll
[1:37:45] become a Christian he said that's the
[1:37:47] purpose I've always tried to line up
[1:37:48] with my thoughts as the Lord would lead
[1:37:50] me so I want to give the Believers a
[1:37:53] further experience but I want to make
[1:37:54] the sinner so ashamed of his sin that
[1:37:56] he'll become a Christian praise God now
[1:37:59] say like this I'm sure you're aware too
[1:38:01] you know as Christians sometimes we come
[1:38:03] to church and we haven't confessed sin
[1:38:05] so if that's the case if we've got sin
[1:38:06] in our lives if we're trying to run with
[1:38:09] these heavy weights I want to preach so
[1:38:11] it makes us ashamed of ourselves we'll
[1:38:13] confess our sins and we'll lay aside
[1:38:15] these weights that easily beset
[1:38:17] us right because we all come to church
[1:38:20] like I said I come to church tired sick
[1:38:22] maybe I don't feel like coming all the
[1:38:23] time I'm battling in my mind or my I'm
[1:38:25] battling in my body but the Bible said
[1:38:27] lay those things aside and run for
[1:38:30] Jesus
[1:38:33] Hallelujah all right now let's go back
[1:38:36] to Hebrews uh chapter 12 I just want to
[1:38:38] hit a few things in here I got most of
[1:38:40] these thoughts I want to
[1:38:41] do sometimes we are so easily burdened
[1:38:45] when we should be running the race with
[1:38:46] more freedom more
[1:38:49] victory yeah Hebrews chapter 12
[1:39:03] not sure what I did
[1:39:08] here oh yeah where's that it's a volume
[1:39:11] adjustment is it at the very top or
[1:39:16] no see that all right so far so good
[1:39:20] yeah all right thank you brother I
[1:39:21] appreciate that there's a guy there's a
[1:39:23] guy knows what he's doing I don't know
[1:39:24] what I'm doing thank you sir I'm just
[1:39:27] screaming and preaching and shouting
[1:39:29] thank you sir appreciate that Hebrews
[1:39:31] chapter 12 let me just emphasize a few
[1:39:33] more of these I'm about at an hour here
[1:39:39] um now go to verse three for consider
[1:39:41] him that endured such contradiction of
[1:39:43] Sinners against himself lest you be
[1:39:45] wearied and faint in your
[1:39:49] mind so this scripture is showing how
[1:39:52] Jesus endured such
[1:39:55] Temptations and he says if we remember
[1:39:57] how Jesus endured test yet never sinned
[1:40:00] that will make us
[1:40:03] refreshed right because sometimes we get
[1:40:06] weary and faint now don't you don't have
[1:40:08] to say Amen or raise your hand so much
[1:40:09] but I know it's true we all get weary
[1:40:11] and we feel faint sometimes we're faint
[1:40:13] like it's hard to pray it's hard to
[1:40:16] witness we're weary it's hard to want to
[1:40:18] go to church we're weary it's hard to
[1:40:21] want to do good we're
[1:40:22] tired so the Bible said when you're like
[1:40:25] this look to Jesus look how he endured
[1:40:28] everything just so he wouldn't be easily
[1:40:31] beset by sin Hallelujah verse four for
[1:40:35] ye have not resisted under blood
[1:40:37] striving against
[1:40:38] sin like I've told numerous people that
[1:40:41] have overcome you know pornography I
[1:40:42] said when was the last time you tried to
[1:40:44] resist your phone or when was the last
[1:40:45] time you actually tried to resist most
[1:40:47] times the PE the the men didn't they
[1:40:48] just go right into it they don't even
[1:40:50] even try can you just stop it and just
[1:40:52] try to kneel down and pray one
[1:40:54] time can you just resist it one time yes
[1:40:58] and then see how much Victory you'll get
[1:41:00] by God's grace amen and they said it
[1:41:02] helps them praise God to remind it You'
[1:41:04] got to make an attempt to
[1:41:06] resist
[1:41:09] Hallelujah and Jesus and and yeah Paul
[1:41:12] says we haven't even resisted under
[1:41:13] blood like I said you know with the with
[1:41:15] the sword being pointed at Abraham he
[1:41:16] wasn't even resisting on the blood yet
[1:41:18] and yet he'd already given into the sin
[1:41:22] and that's why I love the three Hebrew
[1:41:23] children they resisted to
[1:41:25] blood they resisted unto
[1:41:28] fire right the three Hebrew children
[1:41:32] they said well I don't know if God's
[1:41:33] going to save us or not but one thing's
[1:41:34] for sure we won't worship the devil amen
[1:41:38] we won't worship the World Council of
[1:41:39] churches we won't bow down to the Roman
[1:41:41] Catholic church amen and did you see
[1:41:43] that this week the pope would not
[1:41:45] condemn those attacks that Hamed on
[1:41:48] Israel the pope wouldn't condemn it I
[1:41:50] thought thought what in the world and
[1:41:52] then that scripture came to me in in uh
[1:41:54] Revelation 18 the mother Harlot was
[1:41:56] guilty of all the murders of the earth
[1:41:59] so just some some I thought I'd share
[1:42:00] that a fresh news uh news article there
[1:42:05] the pope is not condemning those attacks
[1:42:07] why because that's the spere behind it
[1:42:10] right they're controlling the
[1:42:12] wars in her was found the blood of the
[1:42:15] Saints
[1:42:17] right my I forgot my thought now that's
[1:42:21] all right
[1:42:22] Hebrews yes he strived against it yeah
[1:42:24] the three Hebrew children they were able
[1:42:26] they were willing to go get burned up
[1:42:28] rather than compromis on God's word
[1:42:30] let's take encouragement from that
[1:42:31] praise God I'll do everything in my
[1:42:33] power not to give in the enemy not to be
[1:42:36] so easily deceived so easily and
[1:42:40] snared like Samson so easy like brother
[1:42:42] dicks pre brother dicks preaching Samson
[1:42:44] so easy he just lay there right three
[1:42:46] times in a row she asked him what's your
[1:42:48] secret I'll give in he was just so
[1:42:50] easily just easily tempted into it and
[1:42:53] church we can't let sin we like the
[1:42:55] Bible say we can't let sin lie at the
[1:42:58] door can't like he just laid right there
[1:43:00] in the Sin just lay it there we can't
[1:43:02] let it do that we got to have a clean
[1:43:03] life Hallelujah clean thought life a
[1:43:06] clean actions our whole life must be
[1:43:08] clean praise God
[1:43:10] Amen now verse five and ye have
[1:43:14] forgotten exhortation which speaketh
[1:43:16] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:43:18] not thou the chasing of the Lord nor
[1:43:20] fate when thou rebuked of him I've
[1:43:21] always remember this this is my brother
[1:43:22] Paul this is was the scripture for his
[1:43:25] testimony he got in a numerous car
[1:43:27] accidents in high school and he said all
[1:43:28] these car accidents all these trials led
[1:43:30] him to serve the
[1:43:32] Lord the chastening of the Lord in other
[1:43:35] words he was saying I wasn't serving God
[1:43:36] so God had to let me get in some really
[1:43:38] serious car
[1:43:39] accidents so I would serve God and I and
[1:43:42] I see my trials and my car accidents I
[1:43:44] see that now is God trying to correct me
[1:43:47] but how many know God is merciful am but
[1:43:50] those are some pretty severe
[1:43:54] tests for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:43:56] chastenest and scourges every son whom
[1:43:58] he receiveth there's going to be times
[1:44:01] where God is going to severely rebuke us
[1:44:03] for things that we know we shouldn't do
[1:44:05] sins that easily beset us we're trying
[1:44:07] to serve God but we're letting sin hang
[1:44:10] around our life we can't do that we got
[1:44:12] to lay it
[1:44:15] aside Hallelujah now I'm going to skip
[1:44:17] down
[1:44:19] here look at verse 12 so the Bible says
[1:44:22] I love it wherefore lift up the hands
[1:44:24] which hang down and the feeble knees so
[1:44:27] see when you're carrying things right
[1:44:29] when you're carrying a burden when
[1:44:30] you're carrying sin you can't lift up
[1:44:32] your hands and praise God so I guess God
[1:44:34] wants us to run like this praising God
[1:44:36] hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God
[1:44:38] God wants us to run the race with hands
[1:44:41] raised praise God hallelujah being
[1:44:43] thankful that we can run the race praise
[1:44:45] God Amen we won't be left behind the
[1:44:48] tribulation we're running Hallelujah and
[1:44:50] we'll rise in the Rapture praise God
[1:44:52] Amen but we got to run giving God the
[1:44:54] praise hands free not holding on to
[1:44:57] sin that easily troubles us got to lay
[1:45:00] it aside that's the imagery remember
[1:45:02] we're seeing the clouds we're running
[1:45:04] Hallelujah and I love to run that's my
[1:45:06] testimony running the race for Christ
[1:45:07] that's that's the imagery I use too but
[1:45:10] running being encouraged looking up
[1:45:11] looking at all the testimonies hands
[1:45:13] free hands up giving God G giving God
[1:45:15] the praise giving Jesus praise amen Oh
[1:45:19] Glory
[1:45:22] verse 13 and make straight paths for
[1:45:24] your feet lest that which is lame be
[1:45:26] turned out of the way and let it rather
[1:45:28] be healed Hallelujah so see walk a run a
[1:45:31] straight path towards heaven don't be
[1:45:33] turned aside on the wrong
[1:45:35] path and let your life be healed
[1:45:38] Hallelujah verse 14 follow peace with
[1:45:41] all men and Holiness without which no
[1:45:44] man shall see the Lord so now we can see
[1:45:47] uh what's the opposite of Peace Wars
[1:45:49] wars amongst churches Wars against
[1:45:51] Believers those are sins that easily
[1:45:53] beset the
[1:45:55] believer and that's those are kind of
[1:45:57] like the Deeds of the nicadan so in
[1:45:59] other what I'm saying is any sin that we
[1:46:00] hold on to is becoming a deed in our
[1:46:02] lives and we can't let we can't let it
[1:46:05] become something greater because it can
[1:46:07] easily become something
[1:46:09] greater
[1:46:11] Hallelujah so everybody must be deep
[1:46:13] thinking I didn't get a whole lot of
[1:46:14] amens on that so must be deep thinking
[1:46:16] maybe I'm I'm wearing you out today
[1:46:19] forgive me if I am ver uh verse 15 now
[1:46:23] we also get some more imagery looking
[1:46:25] diligently lest any man fail the grace
[1:46:27] of God I love this we can fail Grace but
[1:46:30] Grace will never fail us amen and who's
[1:46:33] this speaking of Esau so this is not
[1:46:35] speaking of a Believer a Believer will
[1:46:38] never fail the grace of God an
[1:46:39] unbeliever is the only one that can do
[1:46:41] that so don't don't don't let the devil
[1:46:43] get in your mind well I'm going to fail
[1:46:44] God's grace you're never going to fail
[1:46:46] God's grace God's grace is never going
[1:46:47] to fail you either Amen in other words
[1:46:49] you're always going to trust trust in
[1:46:50] God's grace Hallelujah remember Esau had
[1:46:53] the birth right he had the promise he
[1:46:55] had all these blessings coming to him
[1:46:56] but he said I'd rather sell it out for a
[1:46:58] little temporal pleasure so the lesson
[1:47:00] is don't give in temporal pleasure keep
[1:47:03] the promises of God hallelujah amen
[1:47:05] believe the promises of God don't sell
[1:47:07] out God's word believe God's word
[1:47:09] hallelujah hang on to it don't sell it
[1:47:11] out nothing is more valuable than Christ
[1:47:14] Hallelujah he is the treasure he is the
[1:47:16] answer I choose the Jesus way amen I
[1:47:20] like that lyric amen hallelujah he is
[1:47:23] the treasure praise
[1:47:26] God that's what we see plainly from the
[1:47:28] scripture I think I preached so hard I
[1:47:30] blew the page over there so I'm on the
[1:47:32] wrong page
[1:47:33] now see look in other words looking unto
[1:47:36] these clouds of witnesses while you're
[1:47:37] running praising God looking
[1:47:39] up looking diligently lest you fail the
[1:47:43] grace of God and what's the sin Esau got
[1:47:45] the root of bitterness he became bitter
[1:47:47] against Jacob well he's well yeah he
[1:47:49] shouldn't get he shouldn't going get
[1:47:50] bitter though he's the one that's
[1:47:51] willingly sold it out Esau didn't have
[1:47:53] to give in selling out we don't have to
[1:47:56] give
[1:47:57] in so he had a root of bitterness
[1:48:00] remember he's bitter against his parents
[1:48:01] the parents said marry believer he said
[1:48:02] I'm going to marry an unbeliever and
[1:48:04] then he took two wives just to spite his
[1:48:07] parents so see we don't want to now
[1:48:09] that's that's that's a besetting sin
[1:48:11] right we call these bitterness is a
[1:48:13] besetting sin lust and fear critical
[1:48:16] spirit right that's Pride really that's
[1:48:17] all critical spirit is is pride
[1:48:21] it's pride and it easily besets us but
[1:48:24] the Bible said lay that
[1:48:25] aside and run the race so that that's
[1:48:28] why this chapter was important it gives
[1:48:30] us imagery of running the race laying
[1:48:33] aside sins and then it gives us some
[1:48:35] examples of these
[1:48:37] sins verse 16 lest there be any
[1:48:40] fornicators there's a sexual sin or
[1:48:42] profane person as Esau now how many
[1:48:44] people have sold out for sexual sins in
[1:48:46] the world I mean almost
[1:48:47] everybody almost everybody
[1:48:51] you know these mega churches that are
[1:48:52] not in the message they're letting
[1:48:53] homosexuals in and and uh I watched a
[1:48:56] video last week and the reason is
[1:48:58] because they're just so sorry for them
[1:49:00] they don't want them to be alone the
[1:49:01] rest of their lives so they're giving in
[1:49:03] saying oh it's okay you can live a
[1:49:05] homosexual life and come to our church
[1:49:06] because you don't want to be alone but
[1:49:08] the Bible said you got to lay that aside
[1:49:11] and live a life of
[1:49:12] Holiness you have to live those people
[1:49:14] they have to live with the con
[1:49:16] consequences of their
[1:49:19] actions and that will prove their
[1:49:21] sincerity before God hallelujah but
[1:49:24] Church even if they're alone you're not
[1:49:26] alone praise God even if you feel
[1:49:29] physically alone you're not alone
[1:49:31] because Christ is with
[1:49:33] you you see that that's the that's the
[1:49:35] mindset that there well we got to give
[1:49:37] in because we feel so bad they're going
[1:49:39] to be alone the rest of lives they're
[1:49:40] not
[1:49:43] alone they got to be like you know
[1:49:45] remember some of the brothers uh
[1:49:46] remember Mike derle he's that guy who
[1:49:47] was homosexual he heard the message he
[1:49:49] left it but what you do Church on a
[1:49:51] couple occasions he moved in with some
[1:49:52] other brothers just for some
[1:49:55] encouragement right and you know that's
[1:49:58] what people should do you know if if
[1:50:00] they have a desire they don't want to be
[1:50:01] alone will pray and say God s Send Me
[1:50:03] Somebody I I can I can be with you know
[1:50:07] God he owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:50:09] not just natural things but even
[1:50:10] spiritual needs praise God he's Mighty
[1:50:13] to Sav the Bible says hallelujah his ear
[1:50:16] is open to the cries of the righteous
[1:50:19] again how how many times have we
[1:50:20] resisted how many times have we cried
[1:50:22] out to God how many times have we tried
[1:50:23] to lay these things aside let's let's do
[1:50:26] what the Bible
[1:50:27] says okay so we see it we see bitterness
[1:50:30] we see fornication we see we see
[1:50:33] profaneness as Esau who for one morsel
[1:50:35] of meat sold out his Birthright so meat
[1:50:37] is like food and finances right sell out
[1:50:40] the gospel just for a few extra bucks
[1:50:42] like Judas a scar for you know how that
[1:50:46] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:50:47] the blessing he was rejected for he
[1:50:49] found no place of repentance though he
[1:50:51] sought it carefully with
[1:50:53] tears so we see
[1:50:56] that now in verse 18 it says we have not
[1:50:59] come to Mount Si what was Mount Si it
[1:51:01] was where they got the Ten Commandments
[1:51:03] and anyone who touched the mountain were
[1:51:05] smoked dead instantly in other words
[1:51:08] law the Bible's the Bible's encouraged
[1:51:10] us run so it's like we're running to the
[1:51:12] mountain amen we're running to Jesus
[1:51:16] Hallelujah it was so terrible in verse
[1:51:19] 21 the Bible says
[1:51:20] but verse 22 is where it tells us where
[1:51:22] we're running but ye are come unto Mount
[1:51:25] Zion and unto the city of the Living God
[1:51:28] the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable
[1:51:30] company of angels praise God so remember
[1:51:34] I I don't have that picture ready but we
[1:51:35] had the picture when I preached on the
[1:51:36] Mount Zion
[1:51:38] series one mountain is is is
[1:51:41] condemnation it's instant death the
[1:51:43] other mountain is Jesus's Mountain
[1:51:46] hallelujah it's a holy city and there's
[1:51:49] in numerable Angels there praise God
[1:51:52] Hallelujah to the general assembly and
[1:51:55] the Church of the firstborn which are
[1:51:57] written in heaven and to the god the
[1:51:59] judge of all and to the spirits of just
[1:52:02] men made perfect and to Jesus the metor
[1:52:04] of the New Covenant to the blood of the
[1:52:06] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:52:08] than that of Abel praise God hallelujah
[1:52:12] so we're running the race heading toward
[1:52:13] Mount Zion where there's Mercy where the
[1:52:16] blood of Jesus Christ speaks forgiveness
[1:52:18] don't want me anymore no God loves you
[1:52:20] he loved you so much he sent his son to
[1:52:22] die for you praise God
[1:52:25] hallelujah if he could have done
[1:52:27] anything else lay aside every rate rate
[1:52:29] wait and run the race with patience the
[1:52:32] Bible says so there we get that now we
[1:52:35] get impatient with God we're not willing
[1:52:38] to wait
[1:52:39] longer right I got to have this pleasure
[1:52:42] or I got to have this this feeling like
[1:52:45] I can have I got to feel like I've got
[1:52:46] the upper hand in the in the
[1:52:48] relationship or I'm going to hold this
[1:52:50] against them I've got to have this
[1:52:52] pleasure like Esau the fornicator the
[1:52:53] Bible says they feel like they can hold
[1:52:56] on this refuse
[1:52:58] him Hallelujah the Bible said he's
[1:53:00] speaking from Heaven I like verse 28
[1:53:02] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:53:04] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:53:07] whereby we may serve God acceptably and
[1:53:09] godly fear for our God is the consuming
[1:53:12] fire so one more time let me give you
[1:53:14] the picture here we're trying to run a
[1:53:16] race with our hands up looking under
[1:53:18] Jesus running it with patience God is a
[1:53:21] consuming fire the Bible said there's
[1:53:22] fire in his eyes
[1:53:24] amen hallelujah that's why the Bible
[1:53:26] said do everything with prayer and
[1:53:28] Thanksgiving of heart praise God Amen
[1:53:30] it's the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:53:32] that's always God's
[1:53:35] will verse 28 wherefor wherefore we
[1:53:38] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:53:40] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[1:53:43] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:53:45] fear in other words God's kingdom the
[1:53:47] kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost so
[1:53:49] God's Kingdom om cannot be moved and
[1:53:52] that's why the new birth is so important
[1:53:53] praise God when someone gets born again
[1:53:56] their soul his head was spitting anybody
[1:53:57] ever feel like your head's spinning it's
[1:53:59] it's it's interesting we go off for a
[1:54:01] vacation and everything slows down and
[1:54:03] then we we come back Monday morning and
[1:54:05] then my head's swimming already on
[1:54:07] Monday it's only 8:30 A.M on Monday my
[1:54:09] head's already swimming it was like wow
[1:54:11] I wish I could go back just 24 hours ago
[1:54:14] enjoy that time when my head wasn't
[1:54:15] swimming right all the requests all the
[1:54:17] deadlines all the due dates all
[1:54:19] everything like like that all the bills
[1:54:21] to
[1:54:24] pay but this is this is the scriptural
[1:54:27] uh truth that we have received a kingdom
[1:54:30] which cannot be
[1:54:31] moved Hallelujah in other words Satan
[1:54:34] cannot move that Holy Ghost out of our
[1:54:36] lives he I said like this the anchor he
[1:54:40] cannot move that anchor and and and and
[1:54:42] move you from where you stand with God
[1:54:44] hallelujah because the Bible said our
[1:54:46] anchor reaches up unto Heaven Hallelujah
[1:54:48] the Bible said our anchor reaches behind
[1:54:50] the veil in other words we've got a
[1:54:52] spiritual connection my soul is sealed
[1:54:54] but my soul is connected to the one who
[1:54:56] gave me that seal Hallelujah my soul's
[1:54:58] connected to him I cannot be moved
[1:55:00] praise God I'm going to run until I see
[1:55:03] Jesus
[1:55:04] hallelujah amen last verses
[1:55:07] here so what's the Bible say go back to
[1:55:09] earlier in the chapter I purposely
[1:55:11] skipped over these I want to save them
[1:55:12] to the
[1:55:14] end verse one I'm finishing verse one
[1:55:16] and let us run with patience the race
[1:55:20] that is set before
[1:55:21] us so let's pray for that here as we get
[1:55:24] ready to close service let's pray for
[1:55:25] patience that we won't be impatient and
[1:55:28] invite some sin into our life so easily
[1:55:30] give into
[1:55:31] sin so
[1:55:33] easily and what I mean sometimes we just
[1:55:35] choose a Sin and there's not even a
[1:55:37] Temptation no no one's even trying to
[1:55:39] persuade us to do it we ourselves just
[1:55:41] give into it so
[1:55:44] easily and what do we got to do we got
[1:55:46] to lay aside the sin and look unto Jesus
[1:55:50] there's the illustration not only do we
[1:55:52] have all the clouds but we got the sun
[1:55:54] we got Jesus he's the light of the world
[1:55:57] he's the light of the church he's the
[1:55:58] light of Our Lives
[1:56:02] Hallelujah lay it aside be patient look
[1:56:05] to Jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:56:07] faith who for the joy that was set
[1:56:09] before him endured the cross despising
[1:56:11] the shame and is set down at the right
[1:56:13] hand of God H let's stand to our feet by
[1:56:15] God's grace musicians can
[1:56:18] come
[1:56:23] Hallelujah you know I could have went
[1:56:24] through other examples you know think
[1:56:26] about Adam and Eve they were so easily
[1:56:27] beset so easily all zeve did was just
[1:56:31] have a few conversations well are you
[1:56:32] sure God say that is that what God means
[1:56:35] surely God didn't say that so easily
[1:56:37] beset but then what did God do in his
[1:56:39] Mercy he come down he slayed the lamb
[1:56:42] and he clothed them in the sacrifice and
[1:56:44] he gave them another chance praise
[1:56:47] God that's our God he's the god God
[1:56:49] who's rich in
[1:56:51] Mercy let's bow our heads as we pray
[1:56:54] let's ask God to give us patience and
[1:56:56] church if we're hanging on anything if
[1:56:58] we're trying to run a race holding some
[1:57:00] burden let's lay it aside and let's run
[1:57:03] away from that praise God the Bible said
[1:57:07] lay it aside and if we do that and if we
[1:57:10] run the race with our hands up praise
[1:57:12] God then we will run away from these
[1:57:14] sins that easily surround us easily
[1:57:17] troubled us reminds me song we don't
[1:57:19] have to sing it but reminds me of that
[1:57:21] song the eyes on the
[1:57:22] sparrow I think the the lyrics are why
[1:57:25] should I be discouraged why should the
[1:57:27] Shadows Fall why should my heart be
[1:57:29] lonely longing for heaven and home when
[1:57:31] Jesus is my portion amen hallelujah
[1:57:34] Conant friend is he Hallelujah maybe
[1:57:36] we'll sing that later by God's grace
[1:57:37] it's starting to come to me now his eyes
[1:57:39] on this pharaoh and I know he's watching
[1:57:41] over me praise God Z where's Zion Zion
[1:57:44] loves that Sparrow song he's always
[1:57:45] Sparrow I think that's God's reminder to
[1:57:47] us to remember that Jesus if he knows
[1:57:49] every sparrow that falls surely he knows
[1:57:51] you and
[1:57:52] I surely he's interested in helping us
[1:57:55] surely he wants us to run the race with
[1:57:58] no with nothing hanging on us praise God
[1:58:01] let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:58:04] prayer father God we thank you for today
[1:58:06] Lord God lord I just pray you'll take
