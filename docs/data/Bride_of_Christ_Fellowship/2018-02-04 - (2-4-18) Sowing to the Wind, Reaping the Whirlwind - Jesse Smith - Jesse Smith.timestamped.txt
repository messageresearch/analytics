[33:20] sing that that's let's everybody song I
[33:23] say that
[33:24] [Music]
[33:51] scriptures in Luke 18 verse 15 and they
[33:54] brought unto Him also infants that he
[33:58] would touch them and when his disciples
[33:59] saw it they rebuked them but Jesus
[34:01] called them unto him and said suffer
[34:03] little children to come unto me and
[34:05] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[34:07] of God
[34:08] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[34:11] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[34:12] little child shall no wise enter therein
[34:15] a man were so thankful to have Wesley
[34:18] and Naomi and Beatrice here and of
[34:20] course their little darling girls as
[34:22] well let's give them around plough so
[34:24] nice to have them here by the grace of
[34:25] Lord now looking at the meaning for Eden
[34:30] in the Hebrew it means pleasure or
[34:32] delight and you know of course we know
[34:35] the Garden of Eden was a place of
[34:37] pleasure pure pleasure and delight and
[34:39] that's what we're just gonna pray that
[34:40] God will make Eden a dwelling place for
[34:43] God's presence that her life will be a
[34:46] pure pleasure and delight and I remember
[34:48] dedicating nature and praying that she
[34:50] would have the divine nature of Christ
[34:52] and remember dedicating virtue that she
[34:55] would have the divine strength and power
[34:56] of the character of Jesus I loved but
[34:59] she loved those Bible names like that
[35:00] like the other names - but it's just
[35:02] yeah I'm not saying they're better names
[35:04] and they're all good names by God's
[35:06] grace because the name we all fall under
[35:08] is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:10] that's the name we've all got to fall
[35:12] under but I just appreciate the meanings
[35:14] behind these names and appreciate this
[35:17] family and all their support for the
[35:19] church by the grace of the Lord we love
[35:21] them very much so I'm gonna pardon I'm
[35:23] gonna take the baby asleep in here oh
[35:30] she's precious
[35:35] father in heaven this is your life this
[35:37] is your heritage I'm holding the
[35:41] heritage of God in my hands thank you
[35:43] for this life this precious life Eden or
[35:46] God
[35:47] as the searcher Lord teaches as there
[35:49] was a place of pleasure basic sure to
[35:52] life may her life may your soul be the
[35:54] dwelling place of your spirit or that
[35:57] her life would be a pure delight a pure
[36:00] pleasure for your name Lord God for the
[36:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:06] thus Wesley was strength to lead Lord
[36:08] according to the word and they only to
[36:10] submit for no home by the Holy Spirit
[36:13] and each child each daughter fall in
[36:15] line trained up in the ways the Lord if
[36:18] the interest strength and grace to
[36:19] provide this mother support Lord we just

[39:57] for this ability of the rock of God's
[40:00] Word
[40:01] let's take our Bibles this morning let's
[40:03] go to hosea chapter 8
[40:05] I've had a little thought on my part all
[40:08] week and looking at sowing and reaping
[40:11] and so I like to just take the thoughts
[40:13] kind of off the regular trend of the
[40:16] recent series we've been doing on the
[40:19] church ages and worship and there's some
[40:22] other series I work at on a kit though
[40:24] the modesty series we've been working on
[40:25] by the grace of the Lord let's go to
[40:30] Hosea 8 verse 7
[40:48] Isaiah 8 7 Daniel Hosea you can find
[40:53] Daniel you'll find Hosea Daniel Hosea
[40:55] Joel Amos Hosea chapter 8 verse 7 and
[41:01] then we'd like to go to Galatians
[41:02] chapter 6 after that by the grace of the
[41:04] Lord like to preach on sowing to the
[41:07] wind reaping the whirlwind with a
[41:09] subtopic of sowing and reaping this
[41:11] warning because the topic of what am i
[41:15] off well okay I got new batteries but I
[41:19] got the batteries up here so you don't
[41:20] have to go in their mouth can I put them
[41:21] under the pulpit sorry about that
[41:24] because this text of course is a
[41:26] judgment scripture this is a judgment
[41:29] upon Israel Hosea chapter 8 verse 7
[41:35] harden I just got to get a few batteries
[41:37] out of here
[41:40] [Music]
[41:41] Hosea 8 verse 7
[41:52] alright I think there's power thank god
[41:55] the power of Christ never runs out
[41:57] God made sure he gave you a sea of the
[42:00] Holy Ghost unto the day of your
[42:01] Redemption so your power doesn't run out
[42:03] hey man thank God
[42:06] Hosea eight seven let's read it together
[42:08] on three one two three four they have
[42:11] sown the wind and they shall reap the
[42:13] whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall
[42:17] yield no meal if is a yield sorry the
[42:21] stranger shall swallow up part of me I
[42:23] lost my spot let's go to Galatians
[42:24] chapter 6 pardon me
[42:27] blasian 6 verse 7 Galatians
[42:46] seven be not deceived God is not mocked
[42:52] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[42:54] he also reap
[42:56] for he that so it to his flesh shall of
[42:58] the flesh reap corruption but he that
[43:01] soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit
[43:03] reap life everlasting and let us not be
[43:07] weary in well-doing
[43:10] for in due season we shall reap if we
[43:13] faint not and as we have opportunity let
[43:17] us do good unto all men especially unto
[43:20] them who are of the household of faith
[43:22] let's have one more word of Prayer if
[43:24] you ever need on your heart just make it
[43:25] known unto God here maybe you signifying
[43:27] with the raising of your hand
[43:28] Heavenly Father Lord we bowed our heads
[43:30] Lord we're looking to heaven dear God we
[43:33] lifted holy hands we've sung your songs
[43:35] Lord we love you today Jesus and father
[43:39] we want you to speak to us we know this
[43:41] is your way you said gather mowers you
[43:43] see that day approaching Lord God's st.
[43:46] Paul preached on the first day of the
[43:48] week Lord God one time so long into the
[43:51] midnight hours Lord God the gathering of
[43:53] the Saints was so precious then and Lord
[43:55] we realised that it's happening it's
[43:57] repeating again today the gathering of
[43:59] the Saints is so precious today as well
[44:01] for Lord we have the faith of the
[44:03] Apostolic fathers speak to us Lord help
[44:06] me to get out of your way I'm nothing

[44:23] bless your children and Laura let faith
[44:25] rise in every heart in Jesus Christ's
[44:27] name and the church said Amen god bless
[44:29] you being seated praise God actually the
[44:38] the origin of this message I guess would
[44:41] say as I've been writing this book on
[44:43] modesty like I came to this chapter on
[44:47] fashion the fashion in the United States
[44:49] and in the history of the Bible I'm
[44:54] sorry the history of fashion United
[44:55] States and the Bible
[44:57] and so I just like to I like to carry my
[45:00] manuscript around so I can just
[45:01] encourage myself so I don't quit so I've
[45:05] got 31 thousand words I got all that I
[45:08] got chapters 1 through 6 done by God's
[45:10] grace I just like to pack that with me
[45:12] so I know I don't get discouraged I
[45:14] don't get distracted I just want to do
[45:15] the will of God so a very very thankful
[45:17] I just want to make sure I remember
[45:22] that's where I got the inspiration for
[45:23] this message because we today are seeing
[45:26] the part of the whirlwind that America
[45:30] has sewn to America has sewn confusion
[45:34] their clothes they've sown shone sown
[45:37] rebellion and letting women cut their
[45:39] hair and men grow their hair long and
[45:42] men wear shorts and women wear shorts
[45:46] and cross dress and wear men's pants and
[45:48] everything like that and we prove that
[45:50] on Wednesday if you didn't see
[45:51] Wednesday's message I think you'd really
[45:52] like that we showed all the history
[45:54] therefore United States so if you're
[45:56] curious about that I encourage you to
[45:58] it's on the YouTube archives you can get
[46:01] that but I believe that's what we're
[46:03] seeing now people so confused they're
[46:05] born with certain body parts and they're
[46:06] confused which gender they are that
[46:11] confusion could only come from Satan and
[46:14] the Holy Spirit is not the author of
[46:17] confusion he's the author of order he's
[46:21] the author of understanding but you must
[46:24] first have the fear of the Lord and then
[46:26] you have the beginning of wisdom to
[46:29] understand the ways of God and so we're
[46:32] reaping we're starting to see the
[46:33] reaping of that now reaping the
[46:35] whirlwind was actually the judgment
[46:38] literally poured out so our country has
[46:40] not yet received that brother branham
[46:42] said it's going to strike back in 64
[46:44] remember when Alaska almost sunk he said
[46:46] judgment is coming to the west coast and
[46:49] so we know that it's coming and it's
[46:51] struck in minor ways we're having birth
[46:54] pains but the whirlwind itself has not
[46:57] come yet the whirlwind will be the
[46:59] Tribulation Period I mean know that by
[47:01] God's grace we are the country is
[47:04] currently not we as the believers the
[47:06] country the country is sowing to the
[47:08] wind and they're going to reap Oh
[47:11] whirlwind we know that but I want to I'm
[47:13] gonna course start with the judgmental
[47:15] the hard part of this message and then
[47:17] hopefully end with the encouraging part
[47:18] of the message because this is just a
[47:21] thought that brother Bram said and many
[47:22] times as well and the Bible says it many
[47:24] times the Bible lists sowing reaping
[47:27] whirl winds that's all over the Bible so
[47:29] I want to just preach on this this
[47:31] morning sowing to the wind reaping the
[47:33] whirlwind and with a subtopic of sowing
[47:35] and reaping Malka I can switch over here
[47:37] I do have a few slides I'll be mostly
[47:40] preaching out of my notes but I do have
[47:41] a few slides to show you so we're
[47:45] looking at sowing to the wind and the
[47:48] ministry of Hosea I want to start with
[47:50] this ministry of Hosea and I show this
[47:54] back in 2015 I remember when I preach on
[47:56] Hosea because a man had just come in and
[47:58] we had a marvelous service of just
[48:00] praising and shouting and cry and I I
[48:01] know Beatrice was there too and I
[48:03] remember it was a wonderful time in the
[48:05] Lord it was three years ago to the month
[48:07] in February of 2015 but here's Hosea
[48:10] Hosea lived around this time that was
[48:12] his life span 785 - 725 BC and so we're
[48:19] gonna be talking about his life here and
[48:21] then he was a prophet we'll look at two
[48:25] northern Israel shortly after his years
[48:28] of prophecy
[48:29] northern Israel was taken into captivity
[48:31] around 722 BC so here 750 BC there 625
[48:36] BC so it wasn't long after Hosea
[48:39] prophesied that they'd actually reap the
[48:41] whirlwind that he was prophesying about
[48:44] and so I just want to leave that up
[48:46] there just for a few moment moments
[48:48] there he prophesied over 40 years and so
[48:51] I think that's not as that's not his
[48:53] life span I'm sorry that's a live longer
[48:55] than that I think that was his years of
[48:58] prophecy if so I got my numbers mixed up
[49:00] so forgive me that's the same slide I
[49:02] used in 2015 so I haven't looked at it
[49:04] much so pardon me if that date is wrong
[49:07] anyways he prophesied about 40 years he
[49:10] began in the reign of Jeroboam ii and he
[49:14] was mainly prophesying to northern
[49:16] israel at some point of it at the end of
[49:19] his life Hosea moved from Jerusalem I'm
[49:22] sorry moved to Jerusalem from Cimmerian
[49:24] you can see that
[49:25] his writings as well there's there's a
[49:26] few prophecies at the end of the book
[49:28] that goes directly to Jerusalem but he
[49:30] spent most of his time in northern
[49:31] Israel preaching to the Northern Kingdom
[49:34] now I'm gonna skip it I think I got a
[49:36] few slides I mixed up here yeah I mixed
[49:38] that one up parmi so this blue this side
[49:43] is the northern Israel this side is
[49:44] Judah member there was a division of the
[49:46] kingdoms and so the ministry of Hosea
[49:50] was probably in these five kings and
[49:53] then at the end of his life he kind of
[49:54] moved Jerusalem and you may have
[49:56] prophesied the history says under ahaz
[49:58] and hezekiah course Hezekiah was a
[49:59] pretty good King brother man calls him a
[50:01] a a borderline or believer but he was a
[50:04] believer a good good King and so that
[50:08] was the kind of the time period that he
[50:10] he preached in and if you read the book
[50:13] of Hosea which I haven't read all of it
[50:15] but I read numerous scriptures this
[50:17] morning read the whole chapter of
[50:18] chapter 8 this morning the reign of
[50:21] Jeroboam ii this first king up here was
[50:25] a reign of great military ruling by
[50:28] worldly standards their army was at its
[50:30] greatest strength and isn't interesting
[50:32] how America is trying to build up its
[50:33] army now they downsize under the last
[50:35] administration and now they're trying to
[50:37] upgrade again and make their military
[50:40] force so great their economy was strong
[50:44] as its Hosea 12-8 says that their
[50:48] economy was very strong the future
[50:51] actually looked bright and there was
[50:52] optimistic forecasts about their safety
[50:56] it was optimistic about the money
[51:00] situation it looked like Israel was
[51:02] doing good under Jeroboam ii they're
[51:04] very optimistic
[51:05] let's read Hosea 12a just you can see
[51:07] kind of the this description here of
[51:13] Samaria
[51:16] Hosea 12 verse 8 you see what I'm
[51:20] talking about that's what I love about
[51:22] this new Bible that I got so the people
[51:24] at Copley gave it to me as a gift and I
[51:26] love it because it gives an overview
[51:28] gives like two pages of review and the
[51:30] historical things and it always
[51:31] references the scripture which is just a
[51:33] nice help you know you can easily find
[51:35] facts hosea 12 8 and
[51:38] Efram now Ephraim always refers to
[51:40] northern Israel because Ephraim was the
[51:41] oldest son of Israel and Ephraim said
[51:45] yet I am become rich I have found me out
[51:48] substance in all my Labor's they have
[51:50] found none iniquity and me that were sin
[51:55] okay so that's what affirmed said I
[51:57] become rich I found out the substance so
[52:00] see they were there they're rich is just
[52:02] like layer to see remember last week we
[52:04] preached the eight types of Laodicea in
[52:06] the script brother man talked about of
[52:08] course there's more than that but those
[52:09] are just the ones that he preached about
[52:11] they were rich and increased with Goods
[52:13] all things are going so well during this
[52:15] king our our leader is so prosperous
[52:18] everything is prospering and little did
[52:21] they know judgment you know eight seven
[52:24] ninety three two seven twenty two
[52:25] judgment was seventy years away and
[52:27] everything was going to be totally wiped
[52:29] out the people of God were going to be
[52:31] carried away to Assyria little did they
[52:34] know but look they were encouraged at
[52:36] this time we're rich
[52:38] and this is a striking condition that
[52:41] they were in the stability of their
[52:44] government literally left after
[52:47] jeroboams death notice they have six
[52:49] more kings all within the timeframe of
[52:52] thirty years that's not that wasn't good
[52:54] for Israel and how many know you have to
[52:57] have a stable life how many one is
[52:59] stable leader in your life on your job
[53:02] you want a stable person there who's
[53:04] there all the time it's not good when
[53:05] the leadership gets turned over over and
[53:08] over and over again because you have
[53:09] different voices different leadership's
[53:11] all kinds of different things to learn
[53:13] you know we had that in our school
[53:14] recently what just went from principal
[53:16] the principal and everybody's just
[53:17] they're more relaxed now because we've
[53:19] had a stable leader who looks like
[53:20] they're gonna stay for a while they're
[53:22] not trying to leave or go somewhere else
[53:23] like that stability does so much for the
[53:27] people of God and during this time
[53:32] Assyria wasn't even a real enemy as here
[53:35] had been beaten during the time of
[53:37] Jeroboam but after Jeroboam died Assyria
[53:40] grew back to strength and God was
[53:42] raising them up to punish or chasing his
[53:45] people for their rebellious acts so they
[53:49] quickly rose to power and Israel of
[53:52] course was
[53:53] doomed so Hosea's message gives four
[53:58] parts it gives indictment and i'ts all
[54:00] the people of israel for their sins and
[54:02] it lists all their sins and then second
[54:05] it gives instruction about how they can
[54:07] get right with God
[54:08] thirdly and then issues the judgments of
[54:11] God and fourthly then it offers hope at
[54:14] the end now the first three chapters are
[54:17] parallel this is what Amen will probably
[54:19] remember for those who were there three
[54:22] years ago I know it's a long time the
[54:25] first three chapters are parallel
[54:26] between the love of the Lord for Israel
[54:30] and the love of Hosea for Gomer his
[54:33] prostitute wife and this is a marriage
[54:35] that God had arranged and we dramatized
[54:38] I remember that how he dramatized it you
[54:40] know Hosea came from a godly family he
[54:42] was you'll probably you know thinking
[54:44] praying about the the virgin daughters
[54:45] of Israel which one he might marry and
[54:47] God said no you're gonna go take Gomer
[54:49] the prostitute and how his mind just
[54:52] must have been little shaken but he did
[54:55] it anyway he was an obedient prophet
[54:57] aren't you glad for obedient people
[54:59] they're obedient to the word of the Lord
[55:02] both God and Hosea were obedient
[55:05] husbands with unfaithful wives and Hosea
[55:10] has three children through Gomer and all
[55:12] three's names represent the accusation
[55:16] against Israel and they're called to
[55:18] repentance so God was naming them the
[55:21] condition of the people and how they
[55:23] must repent God named them after that he
[55:25] was trying to show them that God is
[55:27] dealing with you you've got to take God
[55:30] at His Word you've got to believe the
[55:31] word of the Lord and what did God send
[55:34] them to God send them some great big
[55:36] angel from heaven he sent them a prophet
[55:39] just like today he sends a simple
[55:42] preacher God could have said anything he
[55:46] could have sent something he could have
[55:49] sent a chariot of fire war and my people
[55:51] but what does God always said a preacher
[55:53] who's preaching thus saith the Lord amen
[55:56] and that's God's Way it's always God's
[55:58] Way listen to the saith the Lord obey
[56:01] thy saith the Lord and you'll you'll
[56:03] reap the right things amen
[56:05] so the first three
[56:07] chapter show the pain and the
[56:08] persistence of divine love divine love
[56:11] can suffer long with someone like
[56:15] recently I was telling you I was
[56:16] counseling a marriage couple and one of
[56:19] the persons is like you know I think I
[56:21] just need to leave and take some time
[56:23] off and I said no I warned them do not
[56:25] do that don't let the Sun go down upon
[56:27] your wrath make it right as soon as
[56:29] possible and so I prayed for that couple
[56:31] and the husband texted me and said all
[56:34] these other things we just kept praying
[56:35] and then it worked out where the wife
[56:37] didn't leave you know there were certain
[56:38] circumstances that worked out and so we
[56:40] there was some hope there see because
[56:44] divine love the Bible says charity
[56:47] suffers long and when you really look
[56:52] down to your soul and see why did I
[56:54] marry this person or or why did I fall
[56:56] in love with this person who did I
[56:58] promise what promise did I make in front
[57:02] of all these witnesses and and what
[57:05] promises that I make when we really look
[57:06] at that and we really base our actions
[57:09] upon that it shows what condition our
[57:11] souls in but we've got to make the right
[57:14] decision praise God and the same thing
[57:16] for you and I with our spiritual walk
[57:18] those of us who aren't married right
[57:19] we've made the vow I'm gonna serve you
[57:21] Jesus so we must be faithful to serve
[57:24] Jesus amen just like we must be faithful
[57:27] to our husband and wife unwavering there
[57:30] must be total total dedication total
[57:33] discipline we must have that same
[57:34] dedication to Christ amen because we're
[57:38] his wife remember at the end of chapter
[57:40] 3
[57:41] Hosea goes there to the slave house and
[57:43] he buys back his life after she ran out
[57:46] numerous times on he B brings he sells
[57:49] off his harvest and he brings all the
[57:51] money and he trades the the barrels of
[57:53] barley and he buys his wife back a woman
[57:56] he's already married a woman that should
[57:58] have already been in this house but his
[58:00] love says even though you've left me and
[58:02] ran after other men and all these things
[58:04] I still love you and my love for you
[58:06] will not end what a picture of the cross
[58:09] of Jesus Christ amen
[58:10] Israel runs from God runs from God and
[58:13] God says his own son said I'm gonna pay
[58:15] the price I'm gonna buy back my
[58:18] unfaithful wife because I love her
[58:20] and he paid the ultimate price did
[58:23] Christ just like Hosea paid a great
[58:25] price for his own wife's freedom from
[58:28] slavery aren't you glad you're free from
[58:30] sin amen we are god forbid that we
[58:33] should be slaves to sin amen
[58:35] we should not continue in sin that sin
[58:38] may abound
[58:39] god forbid we should be free we should
[58:42] be victorious
[58:43] we should have Satan under our feet amen
[58:46] remember like the scripture said in in
[58:48] the in the Romans 16 that God will
[58:53] bruise Satan under your feet shortly
[58:55] amen has anybody experienced that praise
[58:57] God I hope you have are you guys a Satan
[59:00] is under my feet hallelujah now chapters
[59:04] Florida 7 is the 3 fold accusation and
[59:07] the call to repent and then chapters 8
[59:10] through 14 is alternating chapters of
[59:12] lament of God lament of Hosea 4 Israel
[59:15] and of course our text was in chapter 8
[59:19] where God is telling Hosea what to say
[59:22] pronouncing judgment that lament upon
[59:25] Israel now in Chapter 8 let's go to
[59:27] chapter 8 Hosea chapter 8 we're in
[59:28] Chapter 12 let's go back to chapter 8
[59:32] Israel was just in an awful awful
[59:34] condition and I want you to know that
[59:41] they were going to church and they were
[59:44] doing all the church duties and yet
[59:49] still they were living lives contrary to
[59:52] their church life sound familiar like
[59:55] the Pharisees Sadducees they went to
[59:57] church they were the first ones at
[59:59] church they're the last ones that leave
[1:00:01] because they love to be seen in public
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:05] Israel is super religious they kept
[1:00:07] multiplying their altars they the so the
[1:00:10] scripture says here in Hosea they kept
[1:00:12] having more and more altars there they
[1:00:13] were outwardly religious but inwardly
[1:00:15] they were rotting bones dead men's bones
[1:00:19] look at verse 1 in Chapter 8 set the
[1:00:28] trumpet
[1:00:28] my mouth he should come as an eagle
[1:00:30] against the house of Lord because they
[1:00:32] have transgressed my covenant and trans
[1:00:35] I'm sorry trespassed my law the Covenant
[1:00:38] and the law were broken by Israel now I
[1:00:43] want to bring out the altar scriptures I
[1:00:46] believe it's in verse 8 and 9 I just
[1:00:50] wrote the whole it was verses 8 to 14
[1:00:57] okay that's verse 11 I'm sorry Jose 8:11
[1:01:00] because Ephraim have made many altars to
[1:01:02] sin altars shall be sin unto Him so see
[1:01:05] they had altars at church but they also
[1:01:08] had altars to sins so they were
[1:01:12] worshipping all the time they come to
[1:01:13] church they'd raise their hands maybe
[1:01:15] little bit or they'd sing along with
[1:01:16] everybody
[1:01:17] they had altars they bring their
[1:01:18] sacrifices and they would they would go
[1:01:21] through the motions but they had other
[1:01:23] altars outside our only altars should be
[1:01:26] at the altar of Christ amen
[1:01:29] that should be the only place where we
[1:01:31] sacrifice our lives for is Jesus
[1:01:35] everything else is just secondary but
[1:01:38] see they were so religious the Bible
[1:01:40] said they had idols and calves and
[1:01:42] prostitution and sins and they forgot
[1:01:45] their Creator this is all in chapter 8
[1:01:47] and then God lays out this scripture as
[1:01:50] we said in verse 7 for they have sown to
[1:01:53] the wind so any time you break a command
[1:01:55] of God you're sowing to the wind you're
[1:01:57] planting to win and winds represent Wars
[1:02:00] strife and trouble any time you disobey
[1:02:04] one command of God like David he broke
[1:02:07] one command of God which we'll get to
[1:02:09] with adultery right you're planting to
[1:02:13] trouble you plant in us and it's many
[1:02:16] seeds and and remember when you plant
[1:02:18] something generally it's gonna multiply
[1:02:19] a hundredfold whether they're good or
[1:02:22] bad thirtyfold sixtyfold like they'll
[1:02:26] tell you that you plant something that's
[1:02:27] going to multiply hoes they planted some
[1:02:29] tulips at our house and they sure didn't
[1:02:30] multiply right they're just going to
[1:02:34] multiply they're going to take over it
[1:02:35] same thing with sinful actions if we
[1:02:38] allow sinful actions they're going to
[1:02:40] multiply the
[1:02:41] gonna spread the profit tells us this he
[1:02:45] says what does wins mean the Bible for
[1:02:47] any of you Bible interpreters here wins
[1:02:49] means Wars and strife trouble no I just
[1:02:53] want to show the positive side to a
[1:02:56] whirlwind is not always a bad thing a
[1:02:59] whirlwind took Elijah to heaven
[1:03:02] hallelujah God talked to job out of the
[1:03:06] whirlwind glowing Ezekiel saw the four
[1:03:11] beasts come out of a whirlwind in heaven
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] it represents the power of God to the
[1:03:17] believer now to those who've
[1:03:20] transgressed the law of God it
[1:03:22] represents a storm of judgment whirlwind
[1:03:27] actually means tempest or storm in the
[1:03:29] Hebrew so see God God constantly likens
[1:03:33] his ways and his power and his acts in a
[1:03:36] whirlwind a powerful force that no man
[1:03:41] can stop amen on Olivia he's constantly
[1:03:45] liking that to himself now we have many
[1:03:48] scriptures to read but I'm gonna just in
[1:03:50] hit the highlights in Psalms 58 9 the
[1:03:54] Bible said before your pots can feel the
[1:03:57] thorns he shall take them away as with
[1:03:59] the whirlwind both living in his wrath
[1:04:01] the righteous shall rejoice when he
[1:04:03] seeth the Vengeance he shall wash his
[1:04:06] feet in the blood of the wicked so again
[1:04:10] we see a whirlwind as God's vengeance
[1:04:12] against wicked people proverbs chapter 1
[1:04:15] God tells Israel because you didn't hear
[1:04:17] my wisdom he said when you call out to
[1:04:19] me in the day of the calamity he said I
[1:04:21] will not hear your prayer I'll laugh at
[1:04:24] your calamity propers 126 I will mock
[1:04:26] when your fear comes when your fear
[1:04:28] cometh as desolation and your
[1:04:30] destruction cometh as a whirlwind when
[1:04:32] distress and anguish cometh upon you
[1:04:34] then shall they call upon me but I will
[1:04:36] not answer they shall seek me early but
[1:04:39] they shall not find me so see this in
[1:04:43] this in these cases
[1:04:44] woe and represents the power of the
[1:04:47] judgments of God and God is going to let
[1:04:49] this whirlwind pass and bring forth his
[1:04:52] judgment
[1:04:53] he says it again isaiah 66:15 for behold
[1:04:57] the lord will come with fire and with
[1:04:59] his chair 'it's like a whirlwind to
[1:05:01] render his anger with fury see he had a
[1:05:04] chariot of fire a whirlwind a fight with
[1:05:06] elijah the same thing happened here when
[1:05:09] he says this with Isaiah he's got a
[1:05:10] chariot like a whirlwind and it shall
[1:05:15] fall grievously upon the head of the
[1:05:17] wicked you know they asked us that
[1:05:22] practice this week they said what's the
[1:05:23] one thing you would have seen a leader
[1:05:25] never he said intelligence and smartness
[1:05:27] and all these things and yes what do you
[1:05:28] think mr. Smith I said the fear of the
[1:05:30] Lord and he smiled he said you got to be
[1:05:36] smart he's got to be you know quick and
[1:05:38] he's got to be intelligent he's got to
[1:05:39] be up-to-date all these things but the
[1:05:41] one thing a real leader needs is the
[1:05:42] fear of God because that's the beginning
[1:05:45] of getting somewhere to be in a wise
[1:05:47] Virgen amen
[1:05:48] you've got to fear God you got to fear
[1:05:51] the judgments of God see sinners take
[1:05:53] chances they do a little sin and then Oh
[1:05:56] God didn't strike me down they'll curse
[1:05:57] his name and say oh you know he didn't
[1:05:59] cursed me down let God strike me down if
[1:06:01] I do this and God will have mercy on
[1:06:03] them God could strike them down but
[1:06:06] they'll keep going him pretty soon they
[1:06:07] get so calloused to the conviction of
[1:06:12] the Holy Spirit that the Bible said God
[1:06:14] gives them over to a reprobate mind
[1:06:16] which means the Castaway mind a rejected
[1:06:19] mind a condition where they cannot feel
[1:06:23] the Holy Spirit aren't you glad when you
[1:06:25] feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:28] hallelujah Jeremiah 23:19 said behold a
[1:06:32] whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in
[1:06:36] fury God's upset here comes a whirlwind
[1:06:39] no we think of twisters you know I don't
[1:06:41] think God I don't think God's always
[1:06:43] upset with the Midwest and they go
[1:06:44] through you know though I mean I don't
[1:06:45] think God's always upset with them I
[1:06:46] think just part of nature you know time
[1:06:48] and chance you know you want to live by
[1:06:50] the sea God deal with tsunamis you know
[1:06:52] you live by this you live in Ohio you
[1:06:53] got to deal with snow you know but no
[1:06:56] doubt there are times where God has sent
[1:06:59] war winds of destruction to pour forth
[1:07:03] his fury upon sinners
[1:07:06] no doubt about that Nahum chapter one
[1:07:10] says the burden of nineveh I love that
[1:07:12] the burden of nineveh the burden of the
[1:07:14] word of Lord the book of the vision of
[1:07:16] Nahum the Elco sight God is jealous and
[1:07:20] the Lord revenge of the Lord revenge
[1:07:21] earth and is furious the Lord will take
[1:07:23] vengeance on his adversaries and he
[1:07:25] reserved wrath for his enemies the Lord
[1:07:28] is slow to anger amen glory he slow and
[1:07:32] great in power and will not at all
[1:07:35] acquit the wicked the LORD hath his way
[1:07:38] in the whirlwind in the storm and the
[1:07:40] clouds and the dust of his feet it takes
[1:07:44] a long time before God sends the
[1:07:46] whirlwind God is slow to anger he's
[1:07:50] quick to forgive he's rich in mercy
[1:07:52] he's long-suffering he saves to the
[1:07:55] utmost but when he gets upset he sends
[1:07:59] forth the whirlwind
[1:08:01] that's right church now in Galatians 6
[1:08:05] we read that as our text that's kind of
[1:08:06] my background on Hosea so I can't turn a
[1:08:10] corner here remember God is not mocked
[1:08:15] and that means to turn the nose up at
[1:08:17] well I'll do this whatever the Word of
[1:08:18] God says I don't care what the Bible
[1:08:19] says the Greek literally means that to
[1:08:21] turn the nose up at I'm not gonna listen
[1:08:24] to a preacher I'm not gonna listen to
[1:08:25] that and the context is helping a
[1:08:29] brother who's overtaken in a fault you
[1:08:32] must do it with meekness and in fear and
[1:08:34] then the Bible says don't be deceived
[1:08:36] God cannot be mocked - this person
[1:08:40] overtaken in a fault they're they're
[1:08:43] reaping what they showed they are taking
[1:08:47] a fault because they've been faulty with
[1:08:49] the Word of God you understand and God
[1:08:53] will not be mocked whatever a man soweth
[1:08:56] that shall he reap and here's what we
[1:09:01] must do we must not sow to the flesh
[1:09:03] we must sow to the holy spirit we must
[1:09:07] plant seeds in our lives of spiritual
[1:09:10] things I've been teaching at the middle
[1:09:13] school I teach of different thoughts at
[1:09:15] the middle school in elementary at the
[1:09:16] middle school we can go a little deep
[1:09:18] over on ings and priests
[1:09:20] now last week I taught him how to be a
[1:09:21] king you got a rule over sin the flesh
[1:09:23] the devil the world the Bible says we
[1:09:26] reign in life by Jesus Christ lusts
[1:09:31] doesn't reign over me I reign over it
[1:09:34] fear doesn't reign over me I reign over
[1:09:37] fear anger doesn't rule over me the
[1:09:41] peace of God rules over anger amen
[1:09:43] because I'm a king I thought I told the
[1:09:46] kids I said you know what you're looking
[1:09:47] at a king did you know that they said
[1:09:49] what are you talking about I'm a
[1:09:51] spiritual King because I'm ruling over
[1:09:54] the sins that used to rule over me
[1:09:55] they're now under my feet hallelujah and
[1:09:59] so we must all be spiritual kings 1 this
[1:10:02] week's lesson is priests and a priest
[1:10:05] ministers for the people between the
[1:10:08] people and God he's the one that had to
[1:10:11] you know slice that the neck of the
[1:10:13] sacrifice he's the one that had to catch
[1:10:15] the blood he had to go apply the blood
[1:10:17] for this individual aren't you glad he
[1:10:19] applied the blood you know and that nice
[1:10:21] is that God gives you somebody who's
[1:10:22] holy then you might not be holy but he
[1:10:24] gives you somebody holy to apply the
[1:10:26] blood for you and they were all thankful
[1:10:28] for the high priest amen because he went
[1:10:31] in there and he when he went in there he
[1:10:33] went in for himself his family and for
[1:10:35] the entire nation of Israel and Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ as the high priest of our
[1:10:38] profession he went in there for Laodicea
[1:10:41] he went in there for emphasis he went in
[1:10:43] for America he went in for Hong Kong he
[1:10:45] went in there for Africa
[1:10:47] he went in there for everybody because
[1:10:48] Jesus is the high priest Jesus is
[1:10:50] interceding for all of us right now amen
[1:10:53] he lives to intercede he lives to have
[1:10:56] mercy waiting for someone to call out
[1:10:59] him mercy to him in prayer he's just
[1:11:01] waiting to answer you cannot not God and
[1:11:07] the Bible says don't get weary and
[1:11:09] planning good seeds don't see a harvest
[1:11:12] for a few years don't get weary keep
[1:11:15] planting you will reap in due season so
[1:11:20] whatever we
[1:11:21] so Israel is planting to the wind they
[1:11:23] were planting trouble they're planting
[1:11:25] sin and they're gonna reap a whirlwind
[1:11:28] of storm but the Bible says if we plant
[1:11:31] righteousness we shall reap eternal life
[1:11:35] hallelujah
[1:11:37] now Hosea go to hell is a a 10 verse 12
[1:11:39] let's go there since we're already in
[1:11:40] Hosea here's the hope that Hosea is
[1:11:43] giving to the people of God he's
[1:11:49] offering much hope and that's what every
[1:11:52] real man of God does he rebukes sin he
[1:11:55] balls-out sin just like John the Baptist
[1:11:57] he didn't mean to hurt her odious
[1:11:58] inherit brother man tells us he did it
[1:12:00] he'd bald them out because he loved them
[1:12:02] and wanted to see them right with God so
[1:12:05] he balls out he cuts everything to
[1:12:06] pieces and then he offers the hope of
[1:12:08] God glory Hosea 10:12 so look to
[1:12:13] yourselves in righteousness and you will
[1:12:17] what reap and what reap in mercy how
[1:12:20] many well only want God's mercy on their
[1:12:21] life well then you must plant seeds of
[1:12:25] righteousness if you want God's mercy
[1:12:28] you must plant the right seeds of
[1:12:29] obedience the Bible said the merciful
[1:12:32] right there's so many rewards for the
[1:12:34] merciful blessed are the merciful for
[1:12:36] they shall see God I think I got that
[1:12:38] one right that's right I preached on two
[1:12:40] years ago I forget now I can't remember
[1:12:42] everything so do righteousness you
[1:12:47] harvest mercy amen break up your fallow
[1:12:51] ground look he's telling them what to do
[1:12:52] you've got hard hearts he's saying for
[1:12:56] it is time to seek the Lord so it's
[1:12:59] clear your heart is hard when you have a
[1:13:01] hard time seeking God in your life can
[1:13:05] you say Amen
[1:13:06] that's the I don't know everybody that
[1:13:09] wasn't here last Sunday I had to dream
[1:13:10] my brother Brandon last Sunday night or
[1:13:12] Saturday night did you guys hear that on
[1:13:14] the livestream ok and I talked about the
[1:13:17] Brooks this week guess what he had a
[1:13:18] prayer dream a brother Branham on the
[1:13:20] same night the first time you ever had a
[1:13:21] prayer a brother branham I'm starting up
[1:13:24] a dream of brother Branham so I had a
[1:13:26] dream a brother Branham on Saturday
[1:13:27] night last night so - brother Brooks and
[1:13:28] we didn't even know it do we talk this
[1:13:30] week and I told you my prayer I was in
[1:13:32] the prayer line I'm coming up on the
[1:13:34] right hand
[1:13:34] the brother branham we'd say right here
[1:13:36] I say brother branham you know I want
[1:13:38] things better in the church I wanted to
[1:13:39] see the Holy Ghost moving in the church
[1:13:40] and he looked at me and kind of rebuked
[1:13:42] me and he said you haven't seen you
[1:13:44] haven't saw it God about it he said and
[1:13:46] I kind of left really sad because I
[1:13:48] thought I was thinking God but when I
[1:13:50] got out of the dream I felt encouraged
[1:13:52] because the Bible says that if we seek
[1:13:54] Him with all of our hearts we'll find
[1:13:56] him
[1:13:56] and God knows I want to seek Him God
[1:14:01] knows I want to find him amen well I had
[1:14:05] brother I'd call brother Brooks for his
[1:14:06] birthdays birthday was Wednesday Scott's
[1:14:08] birthday happy birthday belated birthday
[1:14:11] brother
[1:14:12] and brother Brooks his dream was like
[1:14:15] this he said he was in a meeting with
[1:14:17] brother Branham he said he left for some
[1:14:20] reason came back and all the people were
[1:14:21] praying and brother BAM looked out and
[1:14:23] he said there will be a 10th meeting
[1:14:26] there will be a Tet meeting there will
[1:14:28] be a Tet meeting and we saw how prayer
[1:14:32] was involved in both them seeking God in
[1:14:34] my prayer and I'm sure my dream and then
[1:14:38] prayer of the people and then I told
[1:14:40] brother Brooks he said I don't
[1:14:41] understand that exactly I said brother
[1:14:42] Brooks did you know brother Branham said
[1:14:44] the age of the Lord told him what that
[1:14:45] little tent room was he said it was the
[1:14:47] closet and brother BAM said that's
[1:14:50] scripturally right he said look because
[1:14:51] jesus said go in your closet and pray so
[1:14:55] both of our dreams were speaking the
[1:14:57] same thing we need to seek God and we
[1:14:59] need to pray more well I was hoping for
[1:15:04] something better than that brother
[1:15:05] Jessie I hope not
[1:15:07] the Bible said it's time to seek the
[1:15:10] Lord if you want mercy you've got a show
[1:15:14] to righteousness and sowing the
[1:15:16] righteousness in this case means seeking
[1:15:18] the Lord and praying and seeking the
[1:15:20] face of God it's time to see God I like
[1:15:22] this until he come and reign
[1:15:24] righteousness upon you oh my the rain
[1:15:27] shower the noin ting the latter rain how
[1:15:30] do you have praise God the former rain
[1:15:32] laterade look at verse 13 you plowed
[1:15:35] wickedness that's what you plowed he
[1:15:38] says you've reaped iniquity you have
[1:15:40] eaten the fruit of lies because thou did
[1:15:45] trust in thy way in the multitude of
[1:15:48] mighty men never trusting in Jeroboam
[1:15:51] they're trusting in all these warriors
[1:15:53] and and leaders that they had and God
[1:15:55] Jose says you cannot trust in them
[1:15:57] you're believing lies in church we've
[1:16:01] got the word of truth we've got the holy
[1:16:03] spirit of truth if anybody should
[1:16:04] believe truth we should believe truth
[1:16:07] because we've got thus saith the Lord on
[1:16:09] truth now I got there's all kinds of
[1:16:14] more scriptures on sowing and reaping
[1:16:17] the whirlwind remember though Matthew 13
[1:16:22] where the Jesus telling the parable of
[1:16:24] the four kinds of ground which seed fall
[1:16:26] upon and he said the enemy no he said
[1:16:30] the field is the world and the good seed
[1:16:32] are the children of the kingdom but the
[1:16:34] tares are the children of the wicked one
[1:16:36] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[1:16:38] the harvest is the end of the world and
[1:16:40] the Reapers are angels so bro Graham
[1:16:44] preaches a message called the seed of
[1:16:46] discrepancy and so Satan is the one
[1:16:49] who's responsible for all these seeds
[1:16:52] these seeds that produce fruit of Lies
[1:16:55] right all these seeds of a discrepancy
[1:16:57] that people believe and we know it's
[1:17:02] from him now I want to move to the next
[1:17:06] thought that Matthew 25 with the parable
[1:17:08] of the talents let's go there Matthew 25
[1:17:12] 24 this was a pretty fresh thought for
[1:17:15] me this morning I hope it I hope I can
[1:17:16] relate it to you the way it brought
[1:17:18] grace to my heart Matthew 25
[1:17:29] 24:00 this is with the unfaithful man
[1:17:32] who had just the one talent then he
[1:17:36] which had received the one talent came
[1:17:37] and said lord I knew that thou art a
[1:17:39] hard man reaping where thou hast not
[1:17:42] sown and gathering where thou hast not
[1:17:45] straud and I was afraid and went and hid
[1:17:49] thy tale in the earth lo there thou hast
[1:17:53] that is thine and his Lord said unto him
[1:17:55] thou wicked and slothful servant thou
[1:18:00] knewest that i reap where I sow not and
[1:18:02] gather where I have not strawed now God
[1:18:09] is righteous God is holy
[1:18:13] and God had these other men planting
[1:18:17] right god is the lord of the harvest he
[1:18:19] had other men planting for him and God
[1:18:23] the gentleman God would not reap where
[1:18:27] he did not sow this wicked servant had a
[1:18:30] wrong understanding about God praise the
[1:18:34] Lord he had a wrong understanding look
[1:18:37] at looking Burt if you go to Luke 19 22
[1:18:39] it's a parallel passage Jesus says this
[1:18:41] and he saith on him out of thine own
[1:18:43] mouth will I judge thee
[1:18:45] so Jesus judges him for the wrong words
[1:18:48] that he says he says well I was just
[1:18:50] scared and I knew you gather where you
[1:18:53] reap where you don't sow and in other
[1:18:55] words he's saying you take fruit that
[1:18:58] doesn't belong to you and God is not a
[1:18:59] stealer God is not a thief so he's a
[1:19:04] wicked man he's a lazy man he didn't do
[1:19:07] nothing with the talent that God gave
[1:19:09] him for the kingdom of God are with me
[1:19:12] Church he refuses it and then he blames
[1:19:15] God on the day of judgment and Jesus
[1:19:19] says I'm gonna judge you by your own
[1:19:20] words he said thou wicked servant thou
[1:19:23] knewest see he didn't know that thou
[1:19:25] knewest that I was an austere man a hard
[1:19:28] man rough man that's what it means rough
[1:19:29] and hard taking up that I did not lay
[1:19:33] down and reaping what I did not sow
[1:19:35] that's not God God whatever God sews
[1:19:39] that's what he reads say men
[1:19:42] are you with me Church God is faithful
[1:19:45] God's a righteous Lord of the harvest
[1:19:47] but see this last serving it's judge
[1:19:49] because he didn't obey the law of
[1:19:52] reaping and sowing and each one of us
[1:19:54] have a talent that we must we must be so
[1:19:57] into amen
[1:19:58] we must sell our talent whatever God's
[1:20:00] given to us whether it's mothering or
[1:20:01] fathering or preaching or whatever town
[1:20:04] singing whatever town we have we must so
[1:20:06] to that we must sow to righteousness and
[1:20:10] reap and mercy but this man refuses to
[1:20:15] invest what God has given him into the
[1:20:19] plan of God he refuses and breaks he
[1:20:21] just did he he puts his nose up at the
[1:20:24] law of reaping and sowing I don't have
[1:20:25] to do that and then I'm gonna blame God
[1:20:29] so it is a wicked thing to neglect the
[1:20:32] law of reaping and sowing in the kingdom
[1:20:34] of God he falsely accused God said God
[1:20:39] is not fair God is hard the Bible just
[1:20:41] said he's rich in mercy the Bible just
[1:20:44] said he's merciful slow to anger and
[1:20:46] this wicked servants whole attitude is
[1:20:49] God so he's so hard on us he saw harness
[1:20:51] is in fact it's the opposite he's so
[1:20:53] merciful upon us this wicked servants
[1:20:57] got the wrong idea he's got God all
[1:20:59] confused why because he's let Satan
[1:21:01] confuse him and he has not understood
[1:21:06] God God is rich in mercy and of course
[1:21:08] God requires faithfulness and of course
[1:21:12] we know what Jesus says he says now
[1:21:14] artists therefore that put my money to
[1:21:15] the exchangers and then at my coming I
[1:21:18] should have received mine own with usury
[1:21:21] take therefore the talent from him and
[1:21:23] give it unto him which hath ten talents
[1:21:25] for unto every one that hath shall be
[1:21:27] given and he shall have abundance but
[1:21:29] from him that hath not shall be taken
[1:21:31] away even that which he hath amen this
[1:21:35] is how much God values the law of sowing
[1:21:38] and reaping every man every woman here
[1:21:42] has some talent something we must apply
[1:21:45] we must our faith must invest in that
[1:21:48] ministry for the kingdom of God how many
[1:21:50] understand that God convicts him for his
[1:21:53] slothfulness his laziness he was too
[1:21:55] lazy
[1:21:56] with the kingdom of God and he made
[1:21:59] excuses like I was scared how could you
[1:22:01] be scared to use the money when it
[1:22:03] wasn't even your money it was God's
[1:22:05] money amen
[1:22:06] and that's what that's what Jesus would
[1:22:08] say today how can you be scared in your
[1:22:10] ministry when I'm the one who equipped
[1:22:12] you for your ministry oh yeah you
[1:22:16] shouldn't be scared because I'm the lord
[1:22:18] of the harvest
[1:22:19] I entrust in this town to you and I'll
[1:22:22] direct your pass if you just under seek
[1:22:24] my ways amen
[1:22:26] I'll direct you because I had enough
[1:22:28] confidence in you to entrust this talent
[1:22:31] this money unto you but we must be
[1:22:33] faithful with our money time talent
[1:22:35] ministries everything we have we must
[1:22:37] devote it all back to God and not
[1:22:40] neglect it but we must honor the law of
[1:22:43] sowing and reaping he was
[1:22:46] self-contradictory and that shows that
[1:22:51] sinners thoughts are hard towards God
[1:22:53] it's always God's fault though he's God
[1:22:55] didn't do this God didn't do that you're
[1:22:56] too hard you're too rough and yet God is
[1:22:59] completely perfect and just in his
[1:23:01] fairness there could be no more perfect
[1:23:03] or more fair judge there could be no no
[1:23:09] better judge than God Almighty and yet
[1:23:11] they're accusing him of having some
[1:23:13] corruption you're too rough you're too
[1:23:15] hard your fault and Jesus said I'm gonna
[1:23:19] judge you by your own words my goodness
[1:23:26] he says suppose
[1:23:30] I did reap where I sew no bro Jesus made
[1:23:32] us say maybe I do that he said yet there
[1:23:34] that's nothing to Defour I had sowed
[1:23:35] upon thee and the talent was my money
[1:23:39] which thou was entrusted with not only
[1:23:42] to keep but to improve I like that
[1:23:45] Jesus saying I've sowed into you and yet
[1:23:49] you're not willing to show what I've
[1:23:51] sowed into you
[1:23:52] o my church you know the Bible says the
[1:23:56] God in you is treasure in earthen
[1:23:58] vessels hallelujah
[1:23:59] amen God put something in you that's a
[1:24:03] treasure can you say amen to that
[1:24:04] you've got a treasure in you and you've
[1:24:07] got a invest in that you've got to
[1:24:10] improve that amen if you're a singer you
[1:24:13] got to be a better singer about loris if
[1:24:15] I'm a preacher I got to be a more
[1:24:17] dedicated word based preacher amen
[1:24:20] whatever you are if you're one new fast
[1:24:22] one who has gifts of white wisdom or
[1:24:24] knowledge or prophecy or tongues
[1:24:26] you've got invest in that and get better
[1:24:28] at that God requires it because he's
[1:24:31] entrusted you with this talent he sowed
[1:24:35] into you and now you got us so in to
[1:24:37] yourself you got so into the ministry
[1:24:39] God's given to you now the nominations
[1:24:44] kind of get this idea like they say oh
[1:24:45] you got to sow into this ministry like I
[1:24:48] had a brother walk up and give me $200
[1:24:51] one time just last year he said I want
[1:24:53] to sow into your ministry and I was like
[1:24:54] oh thank you I put it right towards the
[1:24:57] Bible club there's so many Bible club I
[1:24:58] said I put that 250 right towards Bible
[1:25:00] club and about Botham Bibles and Amanjit
[1:25:02] cubes and all these things but they that
[1:25:05] that that idea goes around the churches
[1:25:08] I'm going to sow into this and that's a
[1:25:11] good giving us a good example of sowing
[1:25:13] it's a good example it's not the only
[1:25:16] example it's just one example now what's
[1:25:22] interesting church that we need to
[1:25:24] understand let's go to John chapter four
[1:25:25] is that we got to be patient
[1:25:28] because the lord of the harvest is
[1:25:30] patient remember James chapter 5 we're
[1:25:32] not going there right now but go to John
[1:25:33] chapter 4 James 5 said the lord of the
[1:25:35] harvest is very patient he waits for the
[1:25:37] fruit of the earth remember that we
[1:25:39] waits for the former latter rain let's
[1:25:41] go to John chapter 4
[1:25:53] John chapter 4 verse 34 this is of
[1:25:57] course the chapter with the woman at the
[1:25:58] well but in between where Jesus discerns
[1:26:02] her spear and then when the City most of
[1:26:04] the city gets saved Jesus tells his
[1:26:06] disciples a little fact about sowing and
[1:26:08] reaping I would like for you to see it
[1:26:10] here this morning Jesus saying that my
[1:26:14] meat is to the will of him that sent me
[1:26:15] and to finish his work say not ye there
[1:26:20] are yet four months and then cometh the
[1:26:22] harvest behold I say and you lift up
[1:26:24] your eyes and look on the fields for
[1:26:25] they are white already to harvest and he
[1:26:29] that reapeth receiveth wages why cuz you
[1:26:33] get that food you go sell it for money
[1:26:35] right and gathers fruit unto life
[1:26:37] eternal that both he that soweth and he
[1:26:41] that reapeth may rejoice together so
[1:26:43] whether you're the one that plants or
[1:26:45] you're the one that reaps everybody
[1:26:46] rejoices because every hat everybody had
[1:26:49] a part in the harvest
[1:26:50] everybody had a part in the the cycle of
[1:26:53] life right
[1:26:55] look at verse I hear something striking
[1:26:57] verse 37 and here it is a true saying
[1:27:00] one sows and another repo and church
[1:27:04] this is humbling for me because my
[1:27:05] ministry might be a sowing ministry what
[1:27:09] I mean what do you mean by that I mean
[1:27:10] this I may preach here for 40 years and
[1:27:12] I may not see a big harvest right like a
[1:27:17] song with brothers James Browning years
[1:27:19] ago and brother Samuel about that their
[1:27:21] church started really really humble
[1:27:23] didn't have much harvest at the
[1:27:24] beginning it was just within the last
[1:27:25] ten or fifteen years that they really
[1:27:27] had a lot of souls being saved when I
[1:27:28] talked with brother James brother Samuel
[1:27:30] they planted and planted for years and
[1:27:33] years and years look what Jesus says
[1:27:39] once knows another Reapers 38 I sent you
[1:27:42] to reap wherein he bestowed no labor my
[1:27:46] other men labored and your enter into
[1:27:49] their labors look at that the disciples
[1:27:52] didn't even do the planting work God
[1:27:54] just sent them out to harvest
[1:27:57] well the Amen what if we're here just to
[1:27:59] do the planting work could we trust God
[1:28:02] for that could we be still happy with
[1:28:03] God for that or do we have to see all
[1:28:05] the reaping a real Christian doesn't
[1:28:08] have to a real Christian just once and
[1:28:10] do what God has called them to do
[1:28:12] I remember brother Craig and Mel Brooks
[1:28:14] both told me that when they had those 50
[1:28:16] Souls when I we were part of those 50
[1:28:18] souls that came out there Lima he said
[1:28:20] brother Craig quoted this scripture and
[1:28:22] he said we entered into the labors of
[1:28:24] other men he thought about brother
[1:28:26] Branham and brother Eddie Bisco and
[1:28:28] brother Neville that administer there in
[1:28:29] Lima he said we entered into their labor
[1:28:32] that's a brother Craig said and that
[1:28:34] strike him for all those years they
[1:28:37] would preach out in the barn at brother
[1:28:38] Browns house
[1:28:39] Tom Brown or they preach in his living
[1:28:42] room have service in his living room but
[1:28:48] listen we're all gonna rejoice together
[1:28:50] amen when we cross over there's gonna be
[1:28:53] no big eyes or little use there's gonna
[1:28:55] be one who's the first among 10,000
[1:28:58] that's Jesus Christ amen all of us
[1:29:00] others just gonna be arms around each
[1:29:02] other happy rejoicing huh get organiz to
[1:29:04] be the family of God we had a part in it
[1:29:07] we just must be faithful with our part
[1:29:10] my parts the plant helped me to plant or
[1:29:12] water remember the Bible said he who
[1:29:15] plants here waters their one I used an
[1:29:18] illustration a few weeks ago you see the
[1:29:20] guy at the landscaping company Jose see
[1:29:22] the guy give her water you water the
[1:29:24] plants that's me I'm just out there
[1:29:26] that's me when you see a landscape or
[1:29:27] water and just think of me I didn't
[1:29:30] really plant a lot of these souls here
[1:29:32] in Akron I mean a few of them yeah but
[1:29:36] I'm just watering I'm just watering I
[1:29:38] let those Spirit of God feed our hungry
[1:29:41] souls amen
[1:29:42] preaching the Word of God but there's
[1:29:45] only one who gives the increase Jesus
[1:29:48] Christ amen we must be faithful in
[1:29:52] planting and if we're faithful in
[1:29:54] planting then we'll certainly have a
[1:29:56] harvest if we are if we can be patient
[1:29:58] and wait upon the Lord amen don't be
[1:30:01] weary in well-doing
[1:30:04] and that's why it was an agriculture
[1:30:06] society in the Bible days to teach them
[1:30:08] you have to have faith remember the
[1:30:10] Bible said in Ecclesiastes
[1:30:11] The Fool say uh it's too cloudy to go
[1:30:13] out and plant today it's too windy I
[1:30:16] can't go out and plant today there's not
[1:30:17] enough rain I'm not gonna go plant and
[1:30:19] the Bible said a fool does that when the
[1:30:22] time comes to plant you got a plant
[1:30:24] right you got it you have to get to
[1:30:27] trust the process
[1:30:28] how many trust the process today amen of
[1:30:31] sowing and reaping we've got to trust
[1:30:33] the process that God has given to his
[1:30:36] people amen look now this just real
[1:30:39] we're not gonna read this but in 1st
[1:30:41] Corinthians 9 Paul talks about preachers
[1:30:43] and how their oxes and you must not
[1:30:45] muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn
[1:30:46] and the Bible says if we have sown
[1:30:48] spiritual things in your lives is it a
[1:30:51] big thing if we reap your carnal things
[1:30:53] that should be the thoughts if the
[1:30:56] preachers are planting spiritual things
[1:30:58] in your life is it a big deal if they
[1:31:00] get your tithes and offerings you know
[1:31:02] your ties rather it's not a big deal
[1:31:04] because the spiritual seeds are more
[1:31:07] important than the carnal ones there's
[1:31:11] so valuable Paul says is it on the big
[1:31:13] thing if you just get a few bucks to
[1:31:15] live and you know make a living and
[1:31:17] something like that now of course people
[1:31:18] perverted it and they're millionaires
[1:31:19] you know that's a perversion but it's a
[1:31:22] little thing because these spiritual
[1:31:24] seeds that are being planted in our
[1:31:26] lives
[1:31:27] week after week are so incredibly
[1:31:29] valuable there are the seeds of God and
[1:31:31] they will bring forth in their season
[1:31:34] amen they return Oh hallelujah the word
[1:31:37] is eternal and it will produce something
[1:31:40] in their lives amen I see it my children
[1:31:43] now those seeds that they've heard over
[1:31:44] the years they're they're producing
[1:31:47] something in their lives they come up
[1:31:49] and bring me prayer requests on least
[1:31:50] expecting it and they come and pray for
[1:31:53] me or do different things talk about
[1:31:55] spiritual things all the time because
[1:31:57] these seeds are being planted in their
[1:31:59] hearts well so we all must have we
[1:32:02] almost let the seeds of God be planned
[1:32:04] in our hearts we got to be faithful go
[1:32:08] to second Corinthians chapter 9
[1:32:10] synchronize chapter 9 mom wants get into
[1:32:14] where I need to go let me we said time
[1:32:17] for 15 minutes I used to preach an hour
[1:32:20] and a half on Sunday morning so praise
[1:32:26] the Lord just got to trust the process
[1:32:27] bro just to stretch us the process you
[1:32:30] have to finish every sermon just trust
[1:32:32] the process but I found this too you
[1:32:35] know the last two weeks I've only
[1:32:36] preached one sermon and it feels like
[1:32:37] the tap of God is running slower like if
[1:32:40] I know I've got to preach to service
[1:32:41] it's like the tap of God runs more I
[1:32:43] need I need two sermons Lord thank you
[1:32:46] and now I go once there was this much is
[1:32:48] that okay just coming real slow you know
[1:32:50] and it's true whatever you need of God
[1:32:55] will supply each Jehovah Jireh if you
[1:32:58] need two services I'll give you two
[1:32:59] services I found that to be true it's a
[1:33:01] law of God sänger in these nine now the
[1:33:04] background of this chapter is beautiful
[1:33:07] paul is kind of bragging on the
[1:33:10] corinthians because they wanted to help
[1:33:13] out some other believers with money with
[1:33:15] giving and the in chapter 8 we're not
[1:33:19] going to read it but the Macedonian
[1:33:20] churches which were Philippi
[1:33:22] Thessalonica and Berea they they came
[1:33:25] they became Christians in the Great
[1:33:26] Tribulation the Bible said but they
[1:33:28] still gave liberally to the Saints in
[1:33:30] Jerusalem and Paul was one of those that
[1:33:32] received their gift
[1:33:33] so these persecuted Macedonian poor
[1:33:36] Christians they gathered up whatever
[1:33:37] little they had and they sent it to Paul
[1:33:39] and Jerusalem and God said and Paul said
[1:33:41] that was a great sacrifice that you gave
[1:33:43] and the Corinthians now they had boasted
[1:33:47] or they had said that we're going to
[1:33:48] help some other church out and Paul's
[1:33:52] kind of reminding them you guys said
[1:33:54] you're gonna help that church out it's
[1:33:55] time to put your money where your mouth
[1:33:56] is go to verse 1 singer the a 9 verse 1
[1:34:03] this is just a good reminder about
[1:34:07] church do we undo we remember how
[1:34:09] important is for us to give to others
[1:34:12] because we're planting seeds of
[1:34:15] righteousness Paul
[1:34:18] voted numerous chapters to his writing
[1:34:20] all about giving to other churches now
[1:34:27] we can say men but I wonder if I asked
[1:34:28] let's take up an offering for this list
[1:34:30] what if next week I say let's take up an
[1:34:32] offering who's ready to put their wallet
[1:34:36] where their heart is right because
[1:34:39] that's what Paul is asking them Paul
[1:34:40] said you said you were gonna give now I
[1:34:44] said make sure you give the Corinthians
[1:34:46] might have some trouble with gifts but
[1:34:47] they were real givers they had a giving
[1:34:50] heart and Paul honor them for that
[1:34:53] singer than his nine won for us touching
[1:34:56] the ministering of this to the Saints it
[1:34:58] is superfluous for me to write to you
[1:34:59] for I know the firmness of your mind for
[1:35:01] which I boast have you to them of
[1:35:03] Macedonia he would go to Macedonia mine
[1:35:05] these Corinthian believers their givers
[1:35:07] they just give all the time he would
[1:35:11] boast on them he's like I don't need to
[1:35:12] repeat this to you guys but he does for
[1:35:15] a reason he does it for our benefit that
[1:35:19] a ki was ready a year ago and your zeal
[1:35:21] hath provoked very many so when other
[1:35:24] churches saw how much the Corinthian
[1:35:26] church gave it made them zealous to want
[1:35:29] to give to yet have I sent the Brethren
[1:35:36] lest our boasting of you should be in
[1:35:37] vain in this behalf that as I said you
[1:35:40] may be ready in other words it's time to
[1:35:43] put your money where your mouth is you
[1:35:45] said you're going to give your real
[1:35:46] generous Church and now it's time I sent
[1:35:48] them here to get your offerings less
[1:35:52] happy if they have methods don't
[1:35:53] Macedonia come with me and find you
[1:35:55] unprepared we'd that we say not ye
[1:35:58] should be ashamed in the same confident
[1:35:59] boasting in other words you better be
[1:36:02] ready to give you said you're going to
[1:36:04] give you better to be ready to give
[1:36:05] don't make promises that you can't keep
[1:36:10] don't be unprepared to give be ready to
[1:36:13] give verse 5 therefore I thought it
[1:36:15] necessary to exhort the Brethren that
[1:36:17] they would go before unto you and make
[1:36:20] up before hand your bounty
[1:36:22] wherefore where ever you had noticed
[1:36:23] before that the same might be ready as a
[1:36:25] matter of bounty and not as of
[1:36:27] covetousness look at verse 6 but this I
[1:36:31] say he
[1:36:32] which soweth sparingly shall also reap
[1:36:36] sparingly and he which soweth
[1:36:39] bountifully she also reap bountifully
[1:36:42] what a what a law of God I don't feel
[1:36:46] like I'm as blessed how come there's not
[1:36:48] as many blessings pouring out I don't
[1:36:50] know but you should check first how much
[1:36:52] have you how many seeds have you planted
[1:36:54] because your harvest would be a good
[1:36:56] indication of what you planted if you
[1:37:00] sow a little you're gonna get a little
[1:37:02] back if you give a lot you're gonna get
[1:37:04] a lot back
[1:37:05] how many can say amen to that he has to
[1:37:09] remind them little giving little harvest
[1:37:12] big giving big harvest every man
[1:37:16] according as he has purpose in his heart
[1:37:17] so let him give not grudgingly or
[1:37:20] necessity for God loves a cheerful
[1:37:22] message giver Amen God loves a cheerful
[1:37:27] Giver
[1:37:27] he loves it when people just give that's
[1:37:30] the purpose of my heart to give I just
[1:37:32] want to give God said I love that person
[1:37:34] I don't know about you but I want Jesus
[1:37:36] to love me
[1:37:37] I appreciate if you love me but I want
[1:37:40] Jesus Christ to love me so I want to be
[1:37:44] a cheerful Giver and God is able to see
[1:37:47] why because God is able to make all
[1:37:49] grace abound toward you if you give he's
[1:37:54] able to make it all come back to you but
[1:37:56] you've got you not have to trust the
[1:37:58] process as his written he hath dispersed
[1:38:03] abroad he hath given to the poor his
[1:38:05] righteousness remaineth forever in other
[1:38:08] words if you give to poor people nobody
[1:38:10] can ever take that away from you you've
[1:38:12] got treasures in heaven how they live
[1:38:15] you have my brother man so little time
[1:38:18] is devoted to storing up treasures in
[1:38:20] heaven verse 10
[1:38:24] now he that men are ministereth seed to
[1:38:27] the sower both minister bread for your
[1:38:29] food and multiply your seed sown and
[1:38:31] increase the fruits of your
[1:38:32] righteousness being enriched and every
[1:38:36] good and everything to all bountifulness
[1:38:39] which causes through us Thanksgiving to
[1:38:42] God they would just praise the Lord by
[1:38:45] these Christians are so generous they're
[1:38:47] willing to help out Macedonia they're
[1:38:48] helping out Jerusalem there this just
[1:38:51] makes us say thank you Lord that there
[1:38:53] are such generous people in this world
[1:38:55] amen now if you're real Christian your
[1:38:57] giving you don't expect it back that's a
[1:38:59] real Christian vows by the experiment of
[1:39:03] this administration they glorify God for
[1:39:05] your professed subjection unto the
[1:39:07] gospel of Christ and for your liberal
[1:39:09] see your freely distributing unto them
[1:39:11] and unto all men that's quite a
[1:39:14] statement not only did they quickly give
[1:39:16] to Christians they quickly gave to
[1:39:17] anybody and by their prayer for you
[1:39:21] which long after you for the exceeding
[1:39:23] grace of God in you thanks being to God
[1:39:26] for His unspeakable gift Wow now
[1:39:30] powerful they would give this Macedonian
[1:39:33] Church would give and then after that
[1:39:34] after the money left for their a little
[1:39:35] bit more poor they'd pray and say God
[1:39:37] bless those Saints in Jerusalem god
[1:39:40] bless them and meet every need that they
[1:39:42] have these people were devoted to prayer
[1:39:44] they knew the laws of God if you give to
[1:39:48] God when you lend to the poor you lend
[1:39:50] to the Lord amen they knew it and yet
[1:39:54] they were poor people too it's not how
[1:39:59] much you give it's how much you give of
[1:40:01] what you have right church I just
[1:40:05] thought we'd go over that again sowing
[1:40:08] and reaping let me bring it down to
[1:40:11] close here I'll try to this one says I
[1:40:13] got seven minutes now that's that's
[1:40:15] interesting I'll just read a few quotes
[1:40:17] but man talks a lot a lot about reaping
[1:40:19] and sowing he talks about Abraham after
[1:40:22] Abraham got the victory over the four
[1:40:24] kings during that time and Genesis 14
[1:40:28] that nelq as that came forth and gave
[1:40:30] him communion he said after the
[1:40:35] over my cousin it came out met Abraham
[1:40:37] gave him communion and some of you
[1:40:38] mothers I want you to notice something
[1:40:39] here - on the tithe paying now Levi was
[1:40:42] yet in the loins of Abraham when he met
[1:40:44] Melchizedek and the tie that Abraham
[1:40:46] paid to Melchizedek I who received ties
[1:40:52] paid ties for he was yet in the loins of
[1:40:54] Abraham when he met Melchizedek which
[1:40:56] was his great-great-grandfather wish I
[1:40:59] had enough time to preach here on sowing
[1:41:01] to the wind and reaping the whirlwind
[1:41:03] for you brother branham tide sowing to
[1:41:06] the winter it weeping the whirlwind into
[1:41:08] taifeng listen here that's what
[1:41:12] America's done he says way back long ago
[1:41:15] we had the old flapper man went over the
[1:41:16] flap around and Wednesday night the
[1:41:19] 1920s flapper of the roaring 20s today
[1:41:22] her daughter is a chorus girl her what's
[1:41:25] her daughter going to be next see what
[1:41:26] you do it bares something upon that your
[1:41:29] generations to follow you sin does
[1:41:31] visits two three and four generations
[1:41:34] and so does righteousness but Ram says
[1:41:37] live right it'll do something to your
[1:41:40] children to follow you on and on keep
[1:41:44] living right doing right separating
[1:41:46] yourself from the things of the world
[1:41:47] and live godly in this present world for
[1:41:50] Jesus Christ amen
[1:41:53] brother I'm context reaping and sowing
[1:41:54] to tithe giving and then to families
[1:41:56] we've got to live the life we've got to
[1:41:59] plant godly seeds before our children
[1:42:01] amen brother Branham said
[1:42:06] that John st. John recognized Jesus as
[1:42:09] the Messiah as Jehovah when he saw Jesus
[1:42:11] multiply the bread because the man he
[1:42:15] kind of dramatizes it and said when John
[1:42:18] was younger his mom would tell him
[1:42:19] stories about the Bible and how the
[1:42:22] manna would fall from heaven and John
[1:42:24] would look up at mama said does God have
[1:42:25] a lot of ovens in heaven is how he makes
[1:42:28] that man everyday and John's mom would
[1:42:30] say no John he's the Creator he can just
[1:42:33] multiply it because he's so powerful and
[1:42:37] then brother branham uses that to
[1:42:39] encourage us he says to tell more he
[1:42:43] said oh if we just take more time to
[1:42:44] tell our children Bible stories he said
[1:42:48] instead of Davy Crockett American
[1:42:51] history which huh me love American
[1:42:52] history I love American history I love
[1:42:55] it
[1:42:55] free some Valley Forge last July 4th he
[1:42:59] said I imagined you could go to this
[1:43:01] time and pick every little boy in this
[1:43:03] town and they all could tell me who Davy
[1:43:04] Crockett was but I bet there isn't 20 of
[1:43:07] them out of a hundred could tell you
[1:43:08] Jesus Christ was the son of God see
[1:43:10] that's just the American spirit moving
[1:43:13] through see and we find today that we've
[1:43:15] sold to the winds and we're reaping a
[1:43:17] world and that's exactly right he said
[1:43:20] but we ought to be teaching our children
[1:43:21] about Christ so see now he's getting
[1:43:26] into the generational aspects of how we
[1:43:28] have to sow the right seeds before our
[1:43:30] children and so God's Word into their
[1:43:33] lives praise the Lord I don't have time
[1:43:37] this spiritual amnesia one's really
[1:43:39] really long it's a really good quote I'm
[1:43:41] gonna close with this David thought I
[1:43:43] got about five minutes here let me those
[1:43:44] are this thought I listened to a sermon
[1:43:47] from a denominator I don't even know
[1:43:48] what you denomination was I just typed
[1:43:49] in I went on YouTube and just typed in
[1:43:51] whirlwind in the wind and a preacher
[1:43:53] come up here's a holiness preacher that
[1:43:55] I could tell he was preaching on closed
[1:43:56] and he was a holiness preacher and he
[1:43:58] had a good he had a good thing but he
[1:44:01] said the best example was David of
[1:44:03] sowing and reaping I thought that's a
[1:44:06] good thought so I went back and found my
[1:44:09] notes from two years three years ago and
[1:44:10] I preached out on David
[1:44:11] I had it some things remember before
[1:44:13] David and Bathsheba this took around
[1:44:15] took place around 10:35 BC he been King
[1:44:18] around thirteen years
[1:44:19] before this great sin she's probably
[1:44:21] between 40 and 50 years old that's what
[1:44:23] Scofield timeline says remember during
[1:44:27] these 13 years between the Uniting of
[1:44:29] the kingdom and this great sin with
[1:44:30] Bathsheba we read the following events
[1:44:32] David in a time of peace desires to
[1:44:34] build the Lord a house but Nathan assure
[1:44:37] him it's for Solomon so he's got peace
[1:44:42] all around him he's enjoying peace
[1:44:44] because he's actually reaping the
[1:44:45] benefits of all his Labor's right I mean
[1:44:49] oh the Bible said in the judges the
[1:44:50] Bible said God gave them peace when they
[1:44:52] defeated their their enemies God is
[1:44:54] going to give you peace if you can get
[1:44:56] the victory hey if you let Christ get
[1:44:59] the victory in your life you're gonna
[1:45:00] enjoy a season of peace hallelujah we're
[1:45:02] gonna be free from that there's gonna
[1:45:04] feel like your own spiritual cloud
[1:45:05] you're gonna feel like you're in
[1:45:06] heavenly places amen
[1:45:09] that's right church David then the
[1:45:12] subdues the Philistines and Moabites
[1:45:13] recovers the borders of Israel from the
[1:45:16] king of Zopa he also slew the Syrians
[1:45:18] and built Garrison's in Syria the Lord
[1:45:21] preserved him wherever he went
[1:45:23] David also built Garrison's and Edom and
[1:45:26] executed justice and judgment unto all
[1:45:28] his people he was faithful with every
[1:45:30] person judgment this is right this is
[1:45:32] wrong we're deciding this this is the
[1:45:34] judgment this is what stands he was
[1:45:36] impartial he was just true he was typing
[1:45:39] Christ David sought out any of
[1:45:44] Jonathan's seed in order to sow kindness
[1:45:46] to them and found Mephibosheth whom he
[1:45:48] calls the drone Jerusalem and he
[1:45:49] continually bred from the king's table
[1:45:51] glory
[1:45:53] remember David was undefeated remember
[1:45:55] that when he inquired to the Lord
[1:45:58] we have to balance it out because
[1:45:59] there's times Balaam inquired the Lord
[1:46:01] and he got the he got the the permissive
[1:46:03] will of God because he went inquiring
[1:46:05] with the wrong attitude
[1:46:07] he went there saying oh I hope God will
[1:46:10] let me get the money from King Barrack
[1:46:13] so we just can't say well I prayed about
[1:46:15] it brother Jesse I know I'm right
[1:46:16] you've got to pray with a neutral heart
[1:46:19] say Lord let your will be done not my
[1:46:22] will that's what David did Lord should I
[1:46:24] go open and take over sick Lag remember
[1:46:25] that should I go up and take your sick
[1:46:27] leg and the Lord said go take it you're
[1:46:28] getting all the blessings you're going
[1:46:30] to recover everything every
[1:46:33] oh you're gonna get back and he did it
[1:46:35] at the command of the Lord after prayer
[1:46:38] so see we must inquire the Lord but have
[1:46:41] the right attitude when we inquire the
[1:46:43] Lord David tried to show kindness to the
[1:46:46] ammonites after the death of the king
[1:46:50] because the king had helped him when he
[1:46:52] was running from Saul now at the bottom
[1:46:55] I put it may have seen David was
[1:46:57] invincible but no man is here's what
[1:46:59] David reaped after he sowed sin see even
[1:47:05] even Roe we say even the highest level
[1:47:07] of a Christian even the most mature
[1:47:08] Christians can make mistakes David was
[1:47:11] the wise virgin for his day nobody lived
[1:47:13] a higher life than he didn't David had
[1:47:16] to have this all planned out with
[1:47:17] Bathsheba that lust memory or with that
[1:47:21] lust what was was just moving now I
[1:47:24] heard something near there's my timer
[1:47:25] but I heard that Bathsheba was related
[1:47:28] to one of his counselors he was like a
[1:47:31] granddaughter of one of his wise
[1:47:32] counselors so one of his main counselors
[1:47:34] so he had seen her before there was some
[1:47:38] he had this all planned out because
[1:47:41] that's what sin is right think about it
[1:47:43] when you fall sure our people fall short
[1:47:45] oftentimes don't people plan to do that
[1:47:47] they're planning the sin they want to do
[1:47:50] and so David neglects the barrel in
[1:47:57] second Kings 11:1 yet your riah's heart
[1:48:02] was centered around the battle in that
[1:48:06] striking church I wonder this morning I
[1:48:09] wonder how many people actually see the
[1:48:10] battle going on today David says I've
[1:48:15] got so many victories
[1:48:16] I've been coasting I'm almost invincible
[1:48:18] I don't need to go out and have a battle
[1:48:21] I don't go out and try to win souls I
[1:48:23] don't have a prayer in my house I don't
[1:48:25] have to fight for these things
[1:48:27] he stopped battling he stopped trying to
[1:48:32] get victories in Christ he just put it
[1:48:36] on coast maybe he parked he just parked
[1:48:39] in lust I'll say like that he couldn't
[1:48:43] see the battle that was going on when we
[1:48:45] come to church do we see the battle
[1:48:47] going on when we go all when you go to
[1:48:49] your home tonight ask yourself am I
[1:48:52] seeing the battle because David after
[1:48:54] all these victories he just put it on
[1:48:56] coast
[1:48:56] he just got kind of lukewarm and
[1:48:59] everybody else is out there battling but
[1:49:03] his heart had left the battle I wonder
[1:49:07] where our hearts at because the Bible
[1:49:08] said wherever your heart is it's where
[1:49:10] your treasures at what's our treasure
[1:49:13] today what would be the greatest
[1:49:15] treasure we could have today it had to
[1:49:18] be something spiritual it have to be
[1:49:20] treasures laid up in heaven helping
[1:49:23] other people everybody see that so he
[1:49:30] planned out this adultery he calls Uriah
[1:49:35] back and he says Uriah going on and see
[1:49:37] your wife and rerai says i'm how can i
[1:49:39] think of this this relationship how can
[1:49:41] I think of this physical relationship
[1:49:43] when all my friends are out there
[1:49:44] fighting for their lord's army amen his
[1:49:48] heart was so into the battle
[1:49:50] he couldn't even joy a lawful
[1:49:52] pleasurable act with his wife I can't
[1:49:56] even think about that
[1:49:57] I'm in battle mode amen oh god help us
[1:50:00] to be in battle mode this morning amen
[1:50:03] help us be in battle mode when we leave
[1:50:05] here how can I do pleasurable things for
[1:50:07] my flesh all the time there's a battle
[1:50:10] going on and that's when David planted
[1:50:14] this adultery in his heart when he
[1:50:17] couldn't see the battle anymore Oh
[1:50:19] everybody's going to heaven everybody's
[1:50:21] being saved and yet people are probably
[1:50:22] dying and going to hell all the time
[1:50:24] couldn't see the battle left the battle
[1:50:28] no longer fighting for the things of God
[1:50:31] how many want to fight for things of God
[1:50:35] it was the season this is the time and
[1:50:38] season to seek God this is the time and
[1:50:40] season to go fight for the things of God
[1:50:42] and he neglects the time and season of
[1:50:44] God I'm just going to coast
[1:50:47] I'm just going to relax I got my eye on
[1:50:48] this little girl then he goes out there
[1:50:50] what happened she's bathing which is
[1:50:52] where BAM said I was wrong for her to do
[1:50:54] that they seemed like they had it kind
[1:50:56] of I don't know I've seen
[1:50:57] may have been planned out we don't know
[1:50:58] for sure but we know one thing
[1:51:00] he was neglecting the battle and I
[1:51:05] wonder if we're seeing the battle today
[1:51:09] David member Nathan comes and says
[1:51:12] there's a man that took out another
[1:51:14] man's lamb and David said he's going to
[1:51:15] restore him fourfold and isn't it
[1:51:18] interesting the very judgment David lays
[1:51:20] on this man gets laid on himself four of
[1:51:23] his sons died he said this he's gonna
[1:51:26] pay him back four fold and he lost the
[1:51:28] baby from that the first baby from
[1:51:30] Bathsheba Amnon Absalon and had an idea
[1:51:33] all died because of his own judgment the
[1:51:37] word that came out of his own mouth in
[1:51:42] that striking Church whatever I'm in
[1:51:44] so's that shall he reap that's striking
[1:51:48] and then what happened to him now
[1:51:51] remember dave was invincible Church he
[1:51:54] hadn't lost in a long time and it was
[1:51:58] one lust one moment one sin all planned
[1:52:02] out at all he ran past every red light
[1:52:04] every red light every red light because
[1:52:06] he wasn't battling anymore
[1:52:09] it wasn't fighting the battle we all
[1:52:11] know there's a battle but are we
[1:52:12] fighting in the battle or trying to cast
[1:52:15] out against are we fighting against
[1:52:17] spiritual wickedness in high places or
[1:52:18] we coming in prayer to Almighty God
[1:52:21] coming against spiritual wickedness all
[1:52:23] around or is there just no battle or we
[1:52:25] just going to church and smiling
[1:52:26] everybody and which is good I'll smile
[1:52:28] you but are we battling for the
[1:52:30] spiritual victories of God that's right
[1:52:35] his daughter got raped by his own son
[1:52:38] Absalom had a conspiracy against his own
[1:52:41] father he lost the kingdom for a while
[1:52:43] then David the the people he Satan
[1:52:47] encouraged him to number the people and
[1:52:48] thousands people died in a plague
[1:52:50] because of David and then Adonai
[1:52:56] at the end of his life tried to take the
[1:52:57] throne from Solomon but of course
[1:52:59] Bathsheba interceded their God had her
[1:53:01] in her seat let's end our feet remember
[1:53:06] brother Branham at the very height of
[1:53:08] his ministry in the 50s he went to South
[1:53:10] Africa and the Holy Spirit said I'm
[1:53:12] giving you this country but what
[1:53:15] happened he felt the very height of that
[1:53:17] discernment
[1:53:18] he took the invitation of the
[1:53:21] denominational x' and the holy spirit
[1:53:24] said you'll pay for that he reap what he
[1:53:28] sowed every man and god every man of God
[1:53:32] every woman of God we have to reap what
[1:53:35] we sow and the Bible says so to
[1:53:39] righteousness so to righteousness praise
[1:53:50] the Lord I want to make sure I don't
[1:53:51] miss something here as we close her
[1:53:56] weekend as we said last last Sunday -
[1:53:58] like the rich young ruler Jesus looked
[1:54:00] at his character man this man was a
[1:54:02] character he was approaching a pinnacle
[1:54:04] that rich young ruler would have kept
[1:54:06] going up with more character Jesus loved
[1:54:08] him look at David this character
[1:54:10] character character character then all
[1:54:12] of a sudden one bad decision caused all
[1:54:18] this whirlwind never see that think of
[1:54:26] celeb
[1:54:27] think of millionaires think of athletes
[1:54:29] who have had everything going for them
[1:54:30] but then they reap what they sow think
[1:54:34] of Tiger Woods he's the clearest example
[1:54:36] said all those records yet he was
[1:54:39] committing adultery on his wife all
[1:54:40] those years and it finally caught up
[1:54:42] with him he's never even got even close
[1:54:44] to winning since then because you reap
[1:54:48] what you sow never understand but the
[1:54:53] Bible says if we sow to righteousness we
[1:54:56] shall reap in everlasting life let's bow
[1:55:01] our heads for a moment here by the grace
[1:55:03] of God Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:55:10] this time Lord God Lord were grateful
[1:55:15] for the laws that you place in this
[1:55:17] universe Lord and father we've just
[1:55:20] briefly looked at this law of reaping
[1:55:21] and sowing Lord I purposely wanted to
[1:55:26] close the David because he's one we'd
[1:55:28] all look up to David was after the heart
[1:55:32] of God he was seeking your heart after
[1:55:41] all those victories he had a weak moment
[1:55:42] Lord God and then reap the whirlwind
[1:55:50] father I want to offer you thanks for
[1:55:54] your word Lord for your grace to us Lord
[1:55:58] that we can hear these things and learn
[1:56:00] from them today to God I pray for every
[1:56:03] person here Lord God they would realize
[1:56:08] what you have sowed into their life as
[1:56:10] we saw with the parable the talents you
[1:56:12] have planted something in our lives now
[1:56:15] help us to do something with it dear God
[1:56:16] all of us mean everyone lord help us all
