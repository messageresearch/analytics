[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just like to take a familiar scripture here the vein looks like get this new one here by God's grace okay we'll try we'll try this wildest monkey Jeremiah chapter 1 we like to look at purpose part 31 today of course Jeremiah was a prophet at the end of Israel's time in the promised land he actually saw Zedekiah the last king taken out he saw the dispersion but he was ordained for such a time as that I love those words that Esther said you know Mordecai told her you were born for such a time as that and so are we we can apply that to every age whose God has a time and season for everything so we can say today that you and I were born for such a time as this we're born to be overcomers and Laodicea it's all Malachi so I may need to turn it up there buddy I'm not sure oh it's not showing up okay can everybody hear it though does at least work for that no okay why do we have a couple extra batteries up here I'll try that in just a minute but let's read our text here before we take a seat by God's grace I'm sorry Jeremiah one that just read verses four five six and seven here Jeremiah 1 verse 4 then the word of Lord came unto me saying and I saw read verse five one two three before i form the in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations and I'll keep reading verse six then said i Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child verse seven but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak praise God may God has blessings Remus word may be seated I'm gonna try to switch out the batteries real quick and see if that works Oh was workin the nursery it's working in one place but not in the other so mommy can hear in the nursery but the live streamers can't is that might just be the Pope of mic yeah that's definitely on so should I use both how about that laughs these both today whatever take sprays hot to get people to hear the word of God amen I'll use both how about that phrase gah so praise the Lord yeah well that's great yeah I'd like to hear that sometimes I don't know if everybody can hear but I know everybody can hear that so praise oh let me get organized here a little bit by God's grace so we read our text out of Jeremiah and we're gonna be looking at this thought on purpose I have some some quotes here so you can you can switch over here I do have a few quotes in a little bit but I want to start with the the text here I read from Jeremiah because this was just on my heart and the Bible says that before I formed in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations I just want to make a few passing thoughts you know we've been looking at purpose now for quite a while almost a whole year and I wanted it I felt like it would go to the spot sorry it would go to the spot where each person could recognize their purpose in life and that deals with your gifts your callings God's plan you know your profession your family everything in life because we know that God ordains all these things and so I found a quote I want to read from the voice of the sign 1964 I didn't have time to put it up there I want to read it here there's only one form of eternal life if you've got eternal life then you yourself was in God's thinking before the world was created you're an attribute of his thinking because eternal never did begin or never can end you're a part of God's economy always and that's even though foolish version that's wise and foolish praise God because the Bible said Jesus in Matthew 25 says come and receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen so Jesus knows the remnant and he you know if we could use cloth as an example Jesus uses all the cloth praise God he likes the the pattern that he cut out you know for his bride but he uses the cloth as well anyone who would be saved they're all part of God's economy praise God he said it's just reflecting it's becoming now they got one more picture to develop that's death then the negative becomes positive then you're in the bride with Christ as he thought so see brother man like kind of dramatizes your life is like a bunch of pictures and that's what we is what we all like to see right that's why we do Facebooker that's how you do your photo albums you like to see from the beginning all the way to the end brother Branham said your last picture is right before death but he said after that last picture then negative becomes a positive and you're in the bride and with Christ as he thought like husband and wife today so God Christ in the church will be the same he said now that's the elected and the called Moses was born a proper child the Bible said that one of the prophets Jeremiah God said before he was even formed in your mother's womb I ordained you a prophet to the nation's so let's just meditate on that for a moment that before Jeremiah was born God knew him and ordained him a prophet and look at that thought too about sanctified got it already sanctified him which means set apart right like brother Branham you know God had sanctified him to be a prophet so God made sure there were certain things in his life he didn't do like murder people praise God like smoke or drink right or chew tobacco God sanctified God had a calling and purpose now see God God's calling and purpose worked with his free more agency because God knew that brother Branham would always want to do that praise God God knew that brother Branham would accept his will for his life so because God foreknew what he would choose God could sanctify him beforehand and declare beforehand the things that he would do in his life just like Jeremiah God knew Jeremiah would be thrown in down into a pit praise God God knew Jeremiah would want to quit but God also knew that God would encourage Jeremiah praise God and all the faces God knew that look at Jeremiah and try to discourage him God knew that he would have to overcome that so God told him be not afraid of their faces for him with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord amen how I love that praise God he said I've set thee this day over the nations and over the kingdom's to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant praise god what a ministry that is it's like he just had to tear everything up and then start all over again praise God what a ministry he had to do and he did it faithfully praise God now I'm going back to the quote he said John the Baptist why he was identified in the scripture Isaiah 700 years before his coming said he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and about four hundred years before his appearing again Malachi said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way before thee see he was foreordained and so was all those Offices of God if they were called of God he says if they're elected I'm sorry he said if they're educated into it it's only cannon fodder see it can't be nothing if it's a meal ticket then you sell your birth rights for a meal ticket you'll compromise to go with the organization or with some group but if it's of God you'll stand by that word regardless because you were born to stand by it amen so Jeremiah suffered awfully right Isaiah who was sawed to pieces he suffered awfully for the word of God's sake John the Baptist suffered and died for the word of God's sake amen brother Branham was rejected by all the church world for God's sake and for the words sake amen and so we know we will experience the same will suffer rejection for the word of God's sake hallelujah but if we are truly caught of God will stand by the word regardless of what any man says or any group says or any family member says we'll stand with the word instead of standing with anyone else he said Moses no one could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to do it a men and brethren sister if you've got eternal life you were ordained to do a certain thing maybe a good housewife maybe something else but nobody can take your place God has made you a place don't try to take somebody else's place that's a carnal impersonation see shows there's something wrong with you be what you are just exactly don't be nothing else amen now that's a good place to start because roadman tells us not to take anybody whose place and be what you are but I want to say this we'll never really know what we are or ought to be until we're born again we're being born again is so crucial to defining your position and finding what God has called you to do it's so important to be born again first praise God and then wait upon the like Paul he got born again and then he went out to Arabia to wait upon his ministry praise God just like Moses you know we know he didn't get born again in the soul but but he believed in the soul praise God he did believe in his soul because the souls are righteous in those days and if they believe God then they were saved amen because the Bible said the raht the righteous soul of lot the Bible call it a righteous soul that's part of the thing I've been studying all week about the soul the soul can be saved and give me righteous and just not sealed yet praise God so that's the scripture has to be that way and the Old Testament had to be the same the same way we are by the promise of God saved by grace through faith amen because the Bible said abraham believed God and it was counted him righteousness amen so the same thing gonna be for a lot lot believe God and the Bible said he was a righteous soul praise God so he believed no because he couldn't live the life that Abraham lived but he believed enough to be saved amen and the Bible said his soul was righteous amen so you and I though we weary verse we receive more revelation that then days gone by and so we have more responsibility you and I see so many quotes week after week after week may God help us just to live those praise God amen because there are so many things that have been taught and preached and said to us and to me too and we've got to live all that we hear and I believe God is calling us higher to live more what we hear praise God but of course there's a time and season for it all praise God we said don't be nothing else a be what God made you to be like Jeremiah he can only be what God called him to be a prophet praise God a preacher of righteousness like Noah said L of him as well he can only be what God called him to be so you and I know if we repent of our sins we get sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and we learn to lean on the Holy Ghost we know that God will guide us into his perfect will for our lives and church it can't be something too mysterious we know it's a mystery but it can't be too mysterious because God says in Isaiah 35 that the way of holiness is so simple that a fool won't air in there so it's got to be so plain to us the mystery of God's will for our life that that only a fool couldn't miss it so it's got to be laying right before us I believe it's laying right before us and the Word of God don't you I believe God's will for your life and your gifts and your call and God's purpose for your life it's laying right here in the Word of God and we just got to turn our eyes upon the Word of God amen and listen for the voice of Jesus listen to him vindicate truth to our lives praise God now that's the one I want to start with there was with that quote and I want to move on here to this quote because God is the god of variety not everybody of course has the same calling and I've mentioned this quote numerous times before but I haven't read it in this series because I've been saving it for imagine of times such as this things that are to be 1965 one of his last sermons I believe that God is a God of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it that way he wanted it and he made this season summer winter spring autumn he made the season that shows he's a god of riding he made you in a variety some men are real bluster so that means they're real open with their words right some men and women they'll just mmm they'll just tell you right away and that's okay they can be a Holy Ghost filled Saint like people they'll just they'll tell you exactly what they mean and some are real dogmatic and that means their routine and and their way is they think their ways the right way we got a lot of those in the message don't we that can be a good thing it's a good thing if you're dogmatic about the Holy Ghost now it's a good thing if you're blusterous for Jesus amen the trouble is when we get a wrong spirit on us right some are row dogmatic that means they're dogmatic means you believe what your your convictions and your real strong about them and others are fine and others are so kind they're just so nice they're not like blusterous and dogmatic like other people there's just such kind people and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom right God's got a variety of personalities in his kingdom so that gives us courage like we don't have to all preach like brother branham like the same style now we all have to preach the same revelation but we don't have to preach all the same style where his blusterous or dogmatic and murder man even says it in the seals he said he said brother nevels not like me but he said brother Neville he said it's real kind he says he said but I can kind of rebuke the people a little bit and he said shucks him like a piece of corn but I said I can do that he kind of laughed him brother Neville kind of laughs over there and says amen he said cuz because God can get the same message across just in a different way because God is a God of variety but we all got to be the same word the same revelation but we could have a different way in which to express it some express it real kind some express it a little more Stern and dogmatic like I remember brother Kevin uh you remember brother Kevin he said no when he served first started going to Perry greens church he said that he said they were the the Deacons were real Stern and dogmatic over there he said he walked in there popping chewing gum listen brother Perry green preach and he said those deacons came up and tapped him on the shoulder and said you spit it out and I don't know if they laid their hand out like that but maybe they had a tissue and I said my I said I don't think I'd ever do that to somebody I don't think I ever have either I've been a pastor of 13 years because I'm just more kind you know kind with some a real dogmatic some a real routine and we're a real star right our sisters laugh because they went to brother Peregrine's church but you know but there's different quotes on that like brother Branham will talk about being real Stern like with correction sometimes they'll say if people don't repent get him out from under the blood and then other quotes will say be he said let your prayer win him back to the Lord and don't put him out from under the blood so yeah so what it means you have to follow the leadership of the Lord in every situation and you have to use the timing of the Lord for different things but see God's got a variety of Christians praise God now here's the one I want to get to this is point of he's talking about look at st. Peter judge him by Andrew not having done a study on Andrew but brother he must have because he said Andrew is that prayer warrior just stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands that preached and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like he says more like the prophet or something and he set back and then brother man goes on to a different thought I just want to pull this one out here that brother Ram noticed the differences in the believers Paul was more scholarly Peter was more fisherman burly firebrand I'll never leave you Lord but then he did that was before the Holy Ghost but Paul wasn't really like that Paul was more scholarly and knew the scripture now Paul had to be scholarly Paul couldn't be out on a fishing boat because Paul had to write the New Testament amen so God plays Paul in the schools because his calling in life matched what he had to do for the Lord and so in Peter Peters calling in life he had the keys brother he had the keys he had to forcefully go up to Satan's Kingdom and he had to apply the kingdom of God and open doors of deliverance and open doors of the Holy Ghost he had to have strong faith to hold those keys and set the captives free amen he had to be he had to be built that way he had to know it was like a fishing for fish praise God because he was gonna call he was gonna haul in three thousand on the day of Pentecost amen I didn't know your praise God he had to know what it was like to be patient and wait for the fish to come but Paul I didn't always like to write the Word of God and to memorize the scripture now I shared this at Albion last month when I preached over there but I mean I've shared it with you too but that's you know the reason I look at my life my life I had to go to college my other brothers have preached they didn't go to college you know Simon camp but I had to go to college I to learn how to cite things and how to research things and I had to learn how to write papers and why did I have to go through that and when I heard a message most people that were my age they quit college why did I stay in college well I stayed in college because my ministry was gonna have to use a lot of those skills I would learn in college and it realized it so later on in life when people like brother Diggs and brother Brooks would tell me you need to write a book you need to write a book you need to do this you need to do that you need to share that with people and so I didn't know that right away but when I was in college we would take a class I think I shared it with you it was called a nonfiction class where they just teach you books that are our true fact books and the woman that the professor standing there and holds up a book and it says what Americans wore from 1770 to the present and she shares the book and said this is a book about how women used to wear slung skirts but now they wear pants and she hand the book to me like well I am I in this class I know I was in that class because I was supposed to receive that the truth of that and show how America has backslidden from her godly foundations and then share with the world amen and all those people on YouTube that are hungry and thirsty for God amen that's why I was in that class so see I was I can always relate to Paul I'm not putting myself on the same level Paul I'm the lowest of God's servants I'm the least of God's servants but I am a servant of God amen I am a Christian I do believe I have the Holy Ghost but I'm saying that I had to go through school in order to receive the facts about a Christian history to build even to build upon even what I knew brother Branham said and to find the actual references in it praise God my wife and I when we first came the message and Simon and Scott Overmeyer and I we loved going to the library before sister Karen I never want to go the library but after the message I loved going the library praise God because I could look at all the religious encyclopedias to say oh look what it says right here the original apostles baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church change it and then now going the library was exciting now it's not so much anymore because I don't do that anymore but I know my kids they'll go to the library just because they love reading but see that was the real power of Christianity to me that it changed my desire I never desire to study it and I never really enjoyed that really like college you know until I became a Christian and that once became a Christian I saw the purpose of it my God sent me here to find all these truths about history and then God sent me here to Shepherd a flock amen my purpose in life was to be more scholarly like and I know if I'd run from that then I'd be sinning how many believe that if I run from what God has shown me if I've run what God placed in my hand got literally place glory he literally braced that history book in my hand and brother man said use whatever in your hand praise God I would be it'd be a sinful thing for me to run from the calling of God upon my life and I can't try to impersonate other people I can't try to be like other be is what God made me to be praise God so I want to use myself as an example because it's a very easy example and it relates to this quote as you can see but see each of you you can do the same thing we can all look at our lives and see where God has brought us in order to know why we're here in the present and what we're to do right now because the sad part is most people believe the message they can see the truth but they never go deep enough to know what God called them to do they think message just being a message believers just believe in the truth and then come into church and and they're not doing anything else the rest of the days we're supposed to come to church but then the rest of the days we should be doing God's purpose for our lives amen our ministry extends outside of these four walls although there is a ministry as ice ended with laughs yes SWE's quote let me go with that again I'm gonna pull it up because I don't think many people have heard it before you you have a great ministry within these four walls but outside of these four walls you have another part of your ministry see you all of you are supposed to use your gifts to help me to meet everybody's gifts today that's what that's what brother Branham said the pre-service prayer before service whether it's in your home or the church the pre-service your ministry before the service is to help me so look at this it's reciprocal right brother bang everybody helps one me and then when I'm up here one helps everybody glory that's that's God's plan right for shepherds and flocks and so it is with the Shepherd and flocks right all the sheep give the Shepherd wool milk meat I'll give him all these things and then he turned around and he provides protection and comfort for all the Sheep see but madam said the Saints and their gift shall have their place first to bring and come together so see your ministry your your purpose within these four walls actually happens before mine yours is first I'm not even first your first Amen I'm second praise God you're first your ministry and your gifts and your prayers is first that's the first ministry mind second he says first which brings have I said before the sphere of the Lord so who brings the spirit Lord hear your gifts if you come to church and don't feel the spirit Lord we got to ask ourselves did we bring the spirit of Lord did we bring it that's a good question because brother and says you bring this through the Lord and I preached it many times but it's an it's an exodus where God told Aaron tell the people to bring the beaten oil to the tabernacle so the ministers can minister with the oil and produce light in the holy place amen glory in other words we can't have Church unless the people bring the anointing oil amen bori see that the ministry the people is first and then the priests did afterwards who brings the sphere Lord first in the church the people your gifts and it makes it much easier for the Holy Spirit to work through him then when a great spiritual meaning has just preceded his teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets into the word and teaches the word has that's already has just been manifested by the gifts now this is where we're going are we there yet I don't think so but this is where we should be going I know this for sure the bride of Jesus Christ is going that way and if you're a part of that bride then you will line up with this word when God starts doing it in his time and season but see we don't want to put it off and say well it must be for another day we've got to act upon it now we at least ought to try to act upon it now praise God so see that affects then you're next at your attitude towards the next service because then you realize my ministry is the first one and that helps the past or have his ministry after me my ministry is not even first it's you your ministry's first and now we're getting into purpose right we're seeing oh that that's my purpose at church my man I'm actually the first one to minister Church not me not the song leader not really amen the first ministry is all the gifts of the saints now I just I would just summarize it with prayer because no gift is really going to operate unless you've repented and being humble and you're praying and seeking god to be anointed so I just want to go back to that one okay so that was my whole desire was to share some of these quotes and to get the people to see you're different you you you may have a different calling or ministry than somebody else but the but the fact is we got to be faithful with that calling and we got to see that we have an important part each one of you each of your prayers are so important for the success of our church praise God each one of your prayers each one of your gifts it's important for the body of Christ your gifts first bring the Spirit of God and then the Spirit of God that's here can anoint me to help you and we just keep helping each other back and forth we just all coexist in love amen we just keep feeding one another right we keep eating and helping one another that's a real church body amen that's a real shepherd and flock [Music] glory I thank the Lord for his word don't you now listen you were born to do something you were born to do something and I've said this before but when I was down in 2009 I think I preached in North Carolina the first time when Tim humans had me to come down there I was sitting in the back I preached a saronite Sunday morning saronite youth meeting and I was there in the study as his office I still remember I was just you know going over quotes and typing and copying and pasting and the song specials were so powerful the anointing of the Holy Ghost was so powerful out there I had to stop what I was doing and I just bowed my head and I was weeping and crying just thanking God for the opportunity to preach his word and I said this little prayer I still remember I said dear Lord it is the greatest privilege of my life to preach your word if I could do anything in the world it would be preacher word to an anointed people Amen I know yeah but even like Jeremiah even if I got to preach to people sometimes that got hard faces and don't want to hear I'll still do that amen because I know it's in the plan of God amen I don't know sometimes you know sometimes the seed falls by the wayside sometimes it falls on thorny sometimes it falls on good ground but the seed still needs pray amen the seeds still need scattered and we'll keep scattering that seed until we see an increase amen glory that's where I said I remember praying and I said God I was born to do this thank you for letting me do this it is the greatest privilege of my life to preach your gospel amen that's how I was born to do I was born to preach I didn't really think about it but I was born to do it now I want to read this quote about sister she Karen brother man talks about your burden so at the end of this quote he said your burden seems to be your cross you must take up and follow Christ with so I'm gonna compare your gift your gift and ministry is like a cross it's hard it's heavy it's not easy praise God it's not uh doesn't always feel good preaching doesn't always feel good but it's a earning it's a labor is something you have to do in order to please God because Jesus said if you don't take your cross you are not a disciple in other words a learner I remember I read the quote last Sunday from works is faith Express if you're not learning more about your gifts but man said something's wrong see it's because you've thrown it you thrown your cross down and said I know I don't want that burden I don't want that responsibility shame on us if we say that that's the best thing that ever happened to us because it teaches us to die daily amen it teaches us to take up the cross and follow Christ it teaches to go slower in life and not so hard right it teaches to take our time and pray and make sure we're walking in the right steps praise God you know in high school we would train for the football games you know we do we would take a 45 pound plate like this but amen and we'd run a 400-meter with it and it got you strong it wore you out but it got too strong I'll tell you this when I didn't have that weight on me and I ran a 400 meter I ran a 50/50 second flat in the 400 meter I was pretty fast because I set the school record but when I picked up that 45 I was really slow I'm comparing that to taking up your cross I was really fast I could felt like I did a lot without the 45 pound but with the 45 pound I need to focus and keep my arms up I'd look at every step and make sure I had enough endurance and to focus on how I was running it was a more disciplined run praise God that's how it is when you and I when we get a real weight and a real burden to do something for Christ it's going to make us focus more it's going to make us be more careful about this things we do we won't make decisions on a whim we'll make decisions through prayer praise God we don't just decide where I'll go here I'll go there I'll buy this I'll buy that I'll get married here I'll get married there you won't make just whimsical decisions like that you pray and say god is this the willit for your is this your will for my life you run the race with perseverance yes you do but you've got a burden you gotta cross and you make sure every step you take is his step so see God gave a burden to you it's not going to be easy this week I preached let's see I preached twice that Sunday Tuesday morning a Bible Club Wednesday at church Thursday Bible Club and out twice today yeah twice a so you have seven times in seven days glory I like that because God give me grace my voice hasn't worn out yet and it's a burden is it easy no it's a burden but it's I just feel compelled to do it I don't know when the last time I'll get a chance to share someone the Word of God so I want to make sure I give them a chance to hear the word of God if they need prayer I'll pray for them if they need a Bible I'll give it to him well we must be willing to give people what they need we must have a burden to do more than what we think we can do so he gives you a burden and that's what this quote says about sister shekharan November they were the ones that the the people around sister Karen when she was dying now this is actually on the tape I don't have it today to show you but all the people she got gravely sick all these denominational people prophesied and said she's gonna live and brother Graham said thus saith the Lord she's gonna die and she died so people say they don't have like there's no there's no like people that leave the message say there's no proof that he's a prophet no there is proof there's proof you've gotta look you just gotta look now look what he says in identification he says but this if you can just see your own self today in the light if your spirit that was in you lived in a character back there now look where you are today and you'll see where you'd have been back there where would you abandon that time would you have tooken sides with the organization that Nathan wanted to organize or would your present character separated you from that and stay with the word see when it seemed all was against it so brother has taken us back to the days of Noah where would you have been in that group would you been right behind the prophet believing every word he said Amen or would you have been the ones that say oh we all can be preachers we don't need the Prophet and we don't need air in the priests we're all holy we all can do that that's what he's saying which group would you be in I rented the Court on Wednesday but man said Cora today Cora people say that the fivefold ministries failed and that's wrong the true 5min phone ministry has not failed the false five ministry has failed amen let me make sure my wife shared that with me I thought I better share that again to remind everybody the true five fivefold ministry cannot fail because they're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen but the false five ministry are pretenders or they're impersonators and they won't preach the Holy Ghost they won't preach even sanctification right they won't even preach doctrine because they don't want to live the Word of God but a real child of God who who's born again filled with the Holy Ghost will preach the word and live all the word that's what we see today they don't preach the word because they don't want to live the word they don't want to die raise god they don't want to take up a cross they just want an easy life Moses had been thoroughly it I've indicated that he had the message of the Lord God approved it in every manner just exactly what he had said come to pass told Israel plumb back and deuteronomy way back in there whatever these signs would be you must follow that and listen to it and hear what the word promised he was made manifest and still Dathan a smart leader down in the egypt rose up and said there you'll try to make yourself the only one that's got anything that wasn't Moses's thought he was only doing what God had ordained him to do all of them didn't have to be Moses's the people only had to follow what he said everyone didn't have to create and do miracles and things that's what the trouble with people today Superman shows that we Korah Dathan they wanted to be like Moses they want to take Moses his place they were trying to press into his position right but God didn't call them for that if call him for that he would have made himself known to them praise God we didn't call him for that and so now program takes this thought and he goes to sister she carrion who was a Pentecostal believer a lady asked me coming down the road the other day it's Florence a carrion brother Dimas sister and sister Williams and them sat in the car she said brother branham i fast and fast and fast and I still I can't cast out Devils remember brother Branham previously said whatever gift you have it's something you can do so see all these quotes line up about gifts if you've got a gift you can do it but you can only do it when the Holy Ghost is there because you can't produce a dream like my dad said dream me a dream well I can't ok performing a miracle I can't give me a word of wisdom I can't I gotta wait on the Lord but see sister Karen was fat because that was the anointing fast and pray fasten frame remember there was anointing of grown ends day was faster brave bastard pray pastor pray he said but they never got to the message a man they never got to the Word of God they start denominations and Trinities and women preachers and tongues as evidence they never got to the word but we've got to the worry man and now we need to fast and pray to find our position and our calling and make sure we're born again and draw close to God amen brother brand my fast and faster fast still I can't cast out Devils I said you wasn't born to do such now God gave him some prophetic knowledge right some prophetic word your duty is fast now notice if you catch that right notice that's what she was doing that's what she could do right but man said if God calls you to do something do it well she could she could fast she could give up meals just fast and pray fast and pray didn't bother her he said your duties not to actually cast out the Devils God wanted to use somebody else to cast out the Devils why to give them a purpose amen glory but your purpose was just the fast fast and pray see God don't ask you like that brother had to learn that lesson you can't do everything in life my if I if I let it my to-do list will grow to like 300 things I could I just can never get to it now I've got to remind myself after I break down and about crying I just can't do everything I just can't I can't do it all cuz well RAM used to tell the people he said rain or shine you just call me and I'll be there and he found out later it almost killed him and then he had to say I can't do it all so he didn't say that after a while after years and years of and then that's why the people would camp out on his porch and then that that yet he pray for them and the people would be healed and blessed but then his wife suffered his children suffered he suffered because he thought he could do more than what he's actually could do right and keep a balance and you remember that's what happened in the Welsh survivor how many member of the Welsh revival Evan Roberts what a man of God I've read his I've read his journal entries what a man of God he was the one that was pregnant he's saying send the Holy Ghost to Welsh for Christ's sake and then God sent the Holy Ghost oh I love that prayer amen that's glory that's not was pretty when you guys got the Holy Ghost I was saying send the Holy Ghost to Akron for Christ's sake amen glory and but he burned himself so much out brother William that he died like five years after the revival it was 1904 he died I think in 1909 or 1912 shortly after the revival because he just burned himself out to prayer and fasting and preaching and traveling till he wore out his own body and died prematurely now did will God receive that of course at least he's not rushing out he's wearing out but at least he's not rusting out doing nothing for the kingdom of God remember I said last Sunday by Bram's quote the worst thing you can do is neglect to try that's the worst thing you can do is to say you have one of these gifts up here the worst thing you do is say you have one of them and then don't try to do it and the way to try is to draw near to God in prayer and fast and seek God and watch God anoint you and then God will do something through you to show you that you can do something through his leadership but the worst thing to do is not even try to neglect that portion of God that divine gift that God placed in your life that's the worst thing you could do is not try but at least Evan Roberts wore out least he wore off that gift Amen hallelujah praise God that's what I was trying to have to do wearing myself out a couple years ago and I lost my voice I said God I'll never do that again see because I was at church I was screaming his shout in every service I was song lead in every service screaming the top of my voice then I go to Taekwondo and scream and shout and I go to school and yell a Bible club and scream that was too much screaming my zeal is eating up my wisdom I was getting some ice cream I was eyes from screaming a lot wasn't very sweet but I was getting a lot of ice cream inside to realize I got to be more careful but madam talked about your voice has two levels right he's at a first gear in a second gear now that quote makes sense to me now I know I gotta save the loud voice and I gotta have a backup voice too I can't wear myself out and I could and I could go prematurely off the scene I could wear myself out like that like I learned to balance it I gotta learn to use more wisdom now let me go back you wasn't born to cast out Devils so teachers don't feel bad if you can't do it don't feel bad but the thing to do is not sit there and do nothing the thing to do is seek God and say God show me what I am to do praise God because we got to do something in this life and coming to church is great it's part of the Word of God but there's a gift to do while you're in the church there's a gift to do before the service there's a gift to do outside the service with your family and friends and your co-workers and other message believers there's there's ministries to do out there if we'll just open our eyes and turn our eyes upon Jesus Oh glory amen praise God like I said with Mike Dirnt on Wednesday if you didn't watch it Mike durdle never heard the message until somebody walked up and game one of those cars from Jeffersonville with the pillar of fire and said did you know God sent a prophet he got so interested he wrote a letter to voice of God they sent him a video edit he asked for where's his church and he drove the next 10 or 15 years of his life from Mansfield although not man's to abuts near Mansfield all the way to Lima every Sunday and he left homosexuality God delivered that man from the sin of this day praise God he left Sodom rejoicing saying I found God did send a prophet and I'm doing what the Prophet said which is the Word of God amen so I wonder I just wish I would have asked him who handed you that card because I would like to know I like to go shake that person's hand and see Church if all your ministry is like I told what anyone not if all your ministry is is passing out my books do it now she has more than that but I just told her one time it'd be a good thing to do it passed out the books or pass out brother Rams books I got all these books out there see the thing to do and whether I said if you don't know your gift if you don't know if you're supposed to testify he said go try it sometime wake up in the morning say I'm gonna go testify at work today and I'm gonna try it see if it works like I told you on Wednesday before I went to get my teeth cleaned thank God I got him cleaned - mercy I prayed and I bowed my head in my room and I said Lord I have taken three books three of my books to the dentist in the name of Jesus help me to pass him out I I just put him in my bag I left him there we walked in I just I kept all my mind though I just prayed I went to get my teeth clean and I'll get them teen and all of a sudden she breaks out and she said man things are getting so awful today I wish they were like they were in the 50s she said I wish I knew when did all this sin start in our nation and I have a whole chapter dedicated to that and I go decade by decade brother amen in fact I started the 1800s then I go 1910 1920 all the way up to today and so there are new and as soon as I as soon as I heard that I smile but I couldn't smile - because I would it would have cut my mouth but I knew I said there it is there's the answer my prayer because I said God opened up a door and I and I told her about it and she literally went like this she's like a 70 year old woman she's like really I was happy to pay for your book I said you're not paying for my book so I went God I said here you go she said thank you and then a woman at the reception said can I have one and I gave out all three maybe that's what God called me to do is to be someone who can pass out and witness but see what I have to do and always find this church what do I need to do more pray about it say God just guide me today see we get so busy and in Turkey ought to we ought to be busy with our work right we ought to glorify God on the job we ought to glorify God in our homes but we got to pray about these things that God used me today like brother cams and I'll never forget - well I might forget it but he said look we ought to pray Lord put me in your path see I found out I found that on Wednesday Lord put me in your path open up a door so I can share with these people the Word of God the message of the hour and God heard my prayer something small like that but all's it took to deliver a man out of homosexuality was a car that said did you know God sent a prophet that's all it took and I think the person who gave it to him sister who I think that person found the purpose for their life right there they were born for that glory they were born to deliver God's Word to a homosexual so you could come out of that and realize I'm not a homosexual I'm a son of God hey there like some of us were smokers and liars and thieves amen and pornography and adulterers and fornicators but we realized when we heard the Word of God I'm not a child of the devil I'm a child of the king amen that person's purpose in life was to make sure he or she whoever was blessed their hearts passed out that card to a homosexual dying I mean he was in his 60s close to death he had health problems for a lot of his adult life see our purpose in life may be so simple what were we born to do oh god help us to do that he said you wasn't born to do such your duty is fast so like her maybe she sister she can't really love food but God said well you got to die to that now you gotta fast it'll probably your gift will probably be opposite of your nature probably like I didn't like studying brother bang I didn't like I didn't like reading books I'd rather watch movies but then God calls me gonna be a preacher I gotta study books all the time I gotta read sermons I gotta read this and write that and I didn't I didn't really like that it wasn't I just whizzed through high school I mean it was I didn't really study that much I was the guy in study hall the day before the test that's I was rewriting out the notes and I would sometimes I cheat I'd do the cheat sheets and put them between my knees it's a shame on me to say that but that was the truth but I mean a lot of it I knew cuz I could just soak it in just by listening you're watching visual learner but then the very thing God called me to do is opposite to what I want to do I didn't want to study the books now God called me to study books okay well maybe sisters you care and love food but God called her you've got to give that up it's probably something similar like that if we had time we teach these things in long meetings how that one person is burdened see there it is Church burden that's why I never want to beg anybody to do anything in this church I'm never gonna beg anybody now preach it again and again and again I'm preaching again all over the time but I'm not gonna beg people to do it I'm gonna bring it up so it'll deal with their conscience but if you are when God has called you to do something nobody's got to beg you to do it because your burden from heaven to do it amen because you're carrying an invisible cross to do it praise God brother bang is the same thing with bang Bang's had the burden of this church on his shoulders for last 13 years he's just carried it he's just carried it if I asked him to do something he does it why cuz he's got a burden for it he believes in it praise God same thing with me whether we got eight people in the church or nine people or four or three or 15 or whatever we got it doesn't matter I keep showing up service after service because I believe in it I've gotta burn for I know God's gonna have me answer for and I want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant the burden see each person is burdened like this for something over here I've got a burden to pass out tracts good do it do it do something praise God I've got a burden too fast do it do it do it whatever your burden is you got to find the bird and the heavenly burden now and you got to do that burden you got to carry that burden and you got a member that is it is a burden it's gonna be heavy sometimes it's not gonna be easy you think it was easy to go to for Paul to go up to Peter stick his finger on his nose and said you're the one that's that you're the one to blame think that was easy when that man walked on water and knew Jesus Christ and live with him three and half years think that was easy no but it was just calling you life a scholar walking up a scholar you know from a school walking up to a big burly fisherman oh you come to correct me no he wasn't like that you understand picture a big burly he's got big muscles you know through his robe you can see his big muscles he wasn't showing him off like people do today but he had to be burdened to correct with the word and so Paul did you don't know you don't and not for you to know it's him doing it so it's God showing you your burden like brother van at Sunday school why does van do that why does van go to this church and teach Sunday School week after week that sometimes one two or three kids why does he do that it's a burden did you make up that burden brother bang or to God give you that burden God gave it because he knows the children need the Word of God and if nobody else would do it I'll do it well God knew there'd be nobody else hey that's why God sent bang to do that amen that's why God sent me to preach here because he knew there'd be nobody else to do it it's him doing it in you why does a men do the songs he doesn't get praise right have any of you paid him the last few months for doing his song service anybody signed him up for music lessons down to Accra music down there anybody signed him up and pay for his lessons lately no he's got a burden to do it he's got a burden it's not something that we're telling him to do it's a god-given burden why does mankind Lydia come play the piano like that I don't pay them I know and I know this I know this for a fact I know people that would only plain in the musicians with the musicians and churches if they're paid I nope they've told me with their own lips so I'm not making it up I know what I'm talking about they'll only do it because they're paid and people that know this message see because it's not a burden the burdens about I need money doing wrong I mean if you love God God will provide your finances no doubt about that but the burden has to be a burden from God and not a burden from man or organization or pressure and that's how you know when it comes down in the pressure moments and the decision you make to either stay with the burden or leave it that shows what you're made of right there because Judas and the hours leading up towards the crucifixion it came pressure time he's got to make a decision is he gonna stay and go to Pentecost or is he gonna sell out and we saw what he did he sold out see God orchestrates all the events of everyone's life so they are forced to make a decision praise God and either stay with your burden either stay with God's calling and saying the perfect will of God or go off in the permissive will of God you can still be saved like Saul but you can be lost like Judas by going the permissive will of God see you're just submissive to your call that's the thing people don't listen enough in prayer if they're no hear God's call they're not there when the preachers going on they're not thinking it applies to them they'll think it applies to somebody else but if you don't have a burden if you don't have a ministry it's time to hear God's call for that cuz God is calling you the Bible said every man has a gift right the bow said a gift as he hath given to every man every man and woman has a gift of the Holy Spirit now may not operate right away-- it may be God's building you up to do something very important when a soul save us so strengthen somebody whatever it is but he's called you to do something and he said it will always line up with the scripture see if it's right or not can a woman fast Church can a woman fast and pray yeah can a woman cast out Devils yes I've seen that I told you that numerous times a woman can do anything except preach and lead men because that goes with song leaders and the right prayer before service and prayer during service you can't she's not to have the she's not to have the mic and leading the men right now we find this Moses that was criticized he was criticized by this group but God said to Moses separate yourself from him because I'm going to swallow him up in the earth he did now see you must know the hour that you're living and now judge your character with what they was so with this illustration just go back like we were saying with Moses which one are you are you in the group following brother branham that's the group I'm in I'm not trying to take them out and make myself a prophet I'm not trying to act like a prophet I'm not trying to prophesy or anything like that I'm just following Moses praise God I just call myself Joshua or Caleb is that okay I hope that's the group you put yourself and I hope you don't put yourself in the other groups the other Israelites either die in the wilderness or in the corn Nathan group amen don't put yourself in those groups my and you know what we looked at on last Sunday you know why they overcame or Wednesday night because they had another spirit in them how did Joshua and Caleb overcome because they had a Holy Spirit in them not a human just just a human will but they had the will of God they're the power and life of the Holy Spirit and so they could live a higher life they could follow Moses because they had the Spirit of God from Moses his ministry glory he said he was and God said to Moses separate yourself from him because I'm gonna swallow him up in the earth and he did now you see yeah you must judge yourself by the character what they was I've already read that so you got it twice okay now we saw with Jeremiah that you were ordained to do something remember the Bible said so Jeremiah was ordained to be a prophet nobody else could take his place he was the one God had called to be a prophet how do you know because God met him and told him how did Moses know God menon told him so church how are we gonna know god's gonna meet us and tell us I'm really expecting these these weekend meetings coming up here if you haven't heard it yet for me I'm expecting God to speak and tell you some of your callings in life this weekend I haven't shared that with Simon cam I talked with both him this week well Simon just by a voice mails but I'm expecting God to speak to some of us and show us more about our purpose and what we're ordained to do if you haven't heard it yet and I've God's by God's grace I wish you had if your hands but if you're not sure yet may God solidify it in these meetings coming up and I want to just bring out this thought hear about ordained you know the Bible said on the day of Pentecost that all those that were ordained to eternal life believed so anyone that God foreknew God for knew that there is 3000 would want to be saved so God made a way for them to be saved let me say like this church if each one of us by God's grace if each one of us want to walk in the full calling of God for our life then God has ordained a time and season for you to do it amen glory amen I I can't remember but a few last month I asked you to I had everybody's head bowed and I turned off the livestream I said who who knew who wants to know who who doesn't know that gifts for their life we had some hands go up and I said who who need to be more faithful to it I had some hands go up there so in our church we have both groups which is common I did the same thing in Albion asked all the same thing in fact in Albion more people said they knew their gifts and we're ashamed that they weren't investing more in them now where do we fall do we know our gifts first and if we know them are we investing them and learning more about them taking up our cross our ministry daily and following him or just kind of cruising along with the things of the world see we don't want to flow by the world's tides right we want to fly we want to flow by God's tides amen we don't want the world to kind of direct us we want to be directed by the holy spirit the holy win right we want to feel the wind of the Holy Spirit from place to place praise God not the winds of doctrine but the wind of the Holy Spirit that's how I was trying to get to amen see they were ordained now church I believe this if you're a child of God if you love God if you're born again then you are deigned to take your position in the body of Christ but you have to do it I can't do it for you nobody else can do it for you I can't put you in position only you can get in position your mom your dad grandma brother cousin pastor song leader nobody can put you in your position you've got to accept your position like Esther she had to accept her position she had to leave Mordecai right David he had to leave his father and he had to go minister in the in Saul's Court until he was King he had to make the decision you and I have them we have the responsibility of making the decision and that will fall in line with God's ordained time in place for us to come into position now I want to read this it's been a long time since I preached out of here but I want to just read one paragraph out of here it was such a blessing there we go studying books again I don't really like to study well you know I I tried to audio books I just don't remember audio books I got to read it I need a book that's hard cover her soft cover but hard paper that's how God made me I'm not going to get it on the you know why because I get distracted I'll check my email real quick but when I got that book there's nothing in that book but just a book that's why I told I even told the people I Bible coming so that's why I don't let people use their phones in church now I used to before I knew better but now I know now I know better because the phone pretty soon uh someone's gonna pop up or then the more the power is gonna go off you're gonna get a ring gonna get a buzzer there's too many distractions the Bible has no distractions amen it's all the word all the time hey man that's why y'all never allow it I don't think it's right they do in big churches that's fine let them do whatever they want let them do what they want little churches well I don't think it's us I don't think it's a wise thing to do now you might have seen me sometimes I test it out sometimes I use my pen on my iPad and try to take notes to see how much I can pay attention but then I got little kids you watch I love I love might remember they need me here they need me here like when I'm listening to a preacher preach so I haven't found that to be a very effective way to do it even for me because then I get tempted to go check my email so I've stopped doing that so you can test it out first to make sure because if I if I'm if I'm the call to lead the flock and if I can't handle it then I don't know I'm not sure if the other people can a know it either it just be wise not to do it that's just my opinion you know everybody can have their own opinion I'm not making a sound of law but just to me it's just wisdom like we don't want any district we have so we can check our phones or tablets all the rest of the week let's just give God some undivided attention Bray's God that's why we feel so far from God because the Bible says if you draw nigh for God He will draw nigh to you that's why I need a hard book I get it if I get a tablet I have my book on my tablet and I still can't read it because there's too many other things to do I can do this for school go do that but when I can just set that down and just hold the book I just and then it's just God now God can start ministering to me this chapter beautiful chapter it's it's called God's power in your weakness I'm just gonna read a paragraph cuz it was really beautiful bless my heart because it talks about how you and I are always becoming until we die we're always becoming what God called us to be until we die cuz that moment right before we die then we finally reached it right we finally reach we finally fulfilled God's will for our life think about that John the Baptist mine He fulfilled he didn't fulfill all of it until he was beheaded as a martyr right and then disciples mourn and and then of course if they were good disciples they would have followed they would have followed John's messages and go follow the Messiah they were good disciples now look at this I wanna read actually it's a couple paragraphs here most of all our weaknesses increase our capacity for sympathy and ministry in other words you can minister to someone else because you know your faults testing one two okay she's a son that's kidding I like that one time I heard a preacher do I like testing see we can minister to others because we see our faults and listen church you know what that motivates me a lot of times to keep going because I see my faults and I see other people falling way further than I fall because they don't know the message and that gives me Wendy a burden to serve more for God because I see we both fall short I'm fallible I need God's help it makes me sister Wendy to want to strut be a strong example of real Christianity because I see my faults but I see my friends that don't believe the message or maybe they do but they don't live right I see them fall to depths I think my in the world how in the world could they do that and it makes me gives me that zealous revenge we read on Wednesday makes one have zeal to do God's will praise God in other words if nobody else will stand with Moses out stand with Moses Amen who's on the Lord's side let them come stand with me that's what I like to say Amen who's on the side of Jesus Christ that really stays with the Word of God I want to say it on that side amen we are far more likely to be compassionate and considerate of the weaknesses of others God wants you to have a christ-like ministry on earth and that's my next series I'm gonna get to is the whole life of Jesus Christ on earth that means other people are going to find healing in your wounds your greatest life messages and your most effective ministry will come out of the deepest hurts that you've experienced I thought that was good the things you're most embarrassed about most ashamed of and most reluctant to share with others are the very tools God can use to most powerfully heal others and think about that brother branham why did I man tell the story when he lied to the IRS why do you tell the story about wanting to murder people and you know why does he tell us those because those encouraged us to know that he was a man he was on the same basis we are and if he overcame murder we can overcome what we battle if he ever caught if you overcome not having a backbone with his mother-in-law and the ministers in South Africa if he overcome compromise then we can overcome compromise but we are in the progress of becoming stronger amen we're in the progress of becoming what God wants us to do amen one day we'll reach it but we must not be discouraged and get hopeless and commit suicide like another team to this week in Copley so sad they just keep doing they become hopeless and they give up hope why because they're looking for other places than in Christ amen because Jesus Christ is our living hope okay man the great missionary Hudson Taylor said all of God's Giants were weak people see the only reason they were Giants was because God worked through them because every person that was a real true giant was nothing on their own it was God in them right just go read about Samson if you want to see a god one of God's Giants went down and got a process - right and then that night at midnight after he laid with the prostitute he got up and heard the Philistines brother bang he walked up and picked up the gates tons and tons of weight and walked him up a hill and set down and they all ran from him like little bees he just got done with the prostitute now who's the Giant there it's God see cuz he was still keeping his covenant so God honored his gift just like when Moses smote the rock he should have done it but God honored it because he was at the most of duty it was his gift but see Samson was becoming what he was going to be eventually member he was born to begin delivering Israel from the Philistines amen and so God worked out God worked even in his weaknesses to bring about Samson so he could accomplish God's calling for his life and he finally did he boy did he have to be humble didn't he he really had to be tore up and humbled and lose his eyesight and get ripped apart and feel like he was absolutely nothing you let around and made fun of and mocked but it finally brought into the place where he could die to his sinful flesh and desires and do the will of God Amen I wonder if that happen have to happen for some of us we might have to be embarrassed about to fall on our faces we might have to go through awful times because of our own mistakes but no matter what God will lead us and guide us into the path of God the footsteps he has for us to do and we will accomplish God's purpose for our lives but let's take warning that's what Paul said take warning take it from Israel take admonition from Israel that we don't complain that we don't lust that we don't go a horn that we don't commit idolatry let us learn from those examples and live a faithful life let's make the testimony more true to the word let's make our lives more like Joseph of the Old Testament by the bank where people have to struggle to find something wrong with our lives hey how did he a men only thing we can find is that he lied about shepherds he told his brothers to lie that's the only thing we can find that man's life because he lives so close to God may God help us to live like that and not be like Samson and give our heart to the things of the world and just give our gifts to God we want more than that we want to give our gifts and our heart to God I can't even get to this quote okay well praise the Lord God knows what he's doing the things you're most embarrassed about will be shared with others to be the very tools God uses to most powerfully heal others all God's Giants were weak people Moses his weakness was his temper it caused him to murder in gyptian strike the rock he wasn't supposed to or he was supposed to speak to and break the tablets of the Ten Commandments yet God transformed Moses into the humblest man on earth see Church we look at Moses he was the homeless man but he wasn't always he said come here let me fight you you're trying to take my Israel brothers smacked him and killed him in oh I better bury him in the sea I'm sorry not seen the sand of the sea God was looking at the end product praise God God's looking at your end product and he's gonna make sure you become what he wants you to be it's gonna take time it's gonna take some rough edges to be worn out praise God he's got to rake you over the coals sometimes just like he rakes me over the coals I mean you're not the only one I get raked over the goes to murder struck the rock so he misuse God's you know what bro Graham called him and how can overcome I'm gonna preach that later brother Ram called Moses a show-off and he said any real man of God won't be a show-off with his gift but I said Moses went in short officer you bunch of rebels I'll give you water from the rock and he smote the rock to show off what he could do with this gift so what did what did the meekest man on earth battle being a show-off praise God the meekest man on earth he started off by being a show-off he went to she could beat up their Egyptians I'll show you what I can do they says you want to complain watch what I can do but yet all those give God the glory don't they because we look at his life and see ma he failed let's learn from that and let's learn not to be a show-off in other words let's read the Bible and repent right now and say God forgive me if I've been a show-off forgive me if I've tried to make things happen forgive me for my temper how about that one forgive me now so don't embarrass myself later because I already have embarrassed myself but then God next time I see a temper help me to be a minister of strength for that person and pray for that person you know and I'll just say like this yesterday I was talking to somebody I was counseling them and they were saying how they brought rock and roll back in their life so I prayed about it you know I did afterwards I just sent that person all the songs I like lately I know what that's like I know what listen to rock and roll rappin country so see I was trying to Minnis I know what that's like because I used to be addicted to that but I try to give him something to help him and minister I know what it's like so I try to set him songs that lift up the Lord songs that are upbeat and they're they're they're jubilee songs see cuz he was going after songs of anger but we I'm trying to give him songs of joy he said Gideon's weakness was his low self-esteem and deep insecurities the angel said you mighty man he's like where where's where's the mighty man at he's where he had a bad self-esteem who I'm at least in my father's house yet God chose him he had deep insecurities remember I've reached that years ago but each before God did anything and get in Gideon had to have a sign just like brother Ram did writes a saying so we can relate to that we have deep insecurities is it 1 o'clock already oh god bless you it's been good such a good atmosphere here I haven't even noticed the time till now but God transformed him into a mighty man of Valor Abraham's weakness was fear not once but twice he claimed his wife was his sister to protect yet he's called the father of faith but he wasn't always Amen he was to become the father of faith amen after trial for trial after year after year after decade after sermon after sermon after sacrifice one after another finally he became the father of faith and I'll say this finally will become the Bride of Christ amen hallelujah it's gonna take a lot of hard sermons in-between here take a lot of hard weeks of Prayer a lot of hard weeks of digging down and read your Bible and confessing your sin might be embarrassed along the way but you're becoming the bride of Jesus Christ but God transform a bruh to Abraham into the father of those who have faith impulsive weak willed Peter he was very impulsive well I'll never deny you I'll die with you Jesus yet Peter became a rock oh my he was the least thing from a rock before the pet day of Pentecost the adulterer David became a man after my own heart I read that last week you know what Nathan said Nathan said because you have despised the word of the Lord the sword will never leave your house that means David when he should have been out in battle he was out there on the roof and he was thinking why does God's Word say I can't commit adultery I can't believe that I can't have this man's wife until he is our husband died he brought the sorry the Bible Nathan says you've despised the Word of God the man that used to write songs and sing out there with the sheep and the goats right he's to sing on the tree and make melodies and psalms but he got to the spot his life he neglected his prayer ministry to the time that's what I think it's a type of soldiers of the Lord prayer praying always with all prayer and supplication with the full armor of God when we neglect prayer we start compromising on God's Word so he got to this spot look at her oh my goodness she's so beautiful look at her she's undressing taking a bath on the top of the house how could God say I can't have it and then God says you've despised the word of the Lord and he said if you were to ask me in other words if you were to prayed amen but he wouldn't even pray about it he just did what his flesh wanted to do and that man became a man after God's own heart he wasn't always but he became a man after God's own heart John he was one of the arrogant sons of thunder he walked around with a man he thought I'm so much bearing these guys look at all the miracles we've done we were sent out two by two all these Samaritans say they won't receive your word Jesus shall I send down fire from heaven like he had any power to do it like you've got any power to strike anybody dead right like you like we have any power to smite someone blind like we have any power like we're the judge of the whole universe we're not but God took an arrogant man like John and made him the apostle of love oh thank you Jesus amen he so hated those guys for not receiving his preaching see cuz it was all about him my gift in my ministry Jimmy just bring down fire from heaven but later he became pray for those loved those he said little children you know the greatest commandment you've already been told he said love one another this is my commandment where's virtue this is my commandment that you love there she sits no she's nothing this is my commandment that you love one another that your joy might be full that's virtue song this is my commandment that you love one another I'm sorry to wake you up I didn't mean to do that I just thought of you you could go on on and on and on couldn't you these people were constantly becoming what God had called them their purpose for their life it wasn't at the beginning of their ministries that getting was valiant he wasn't valued at all but God saw God ordained him to be valiant so God made a way where he could be Amen hallelujah all right I'm gonna skip that all right let's say in our feet here stop the livestream god bless livestreamer sister Connie we love you god bless you although they're live streamers god bless you it's already an hour and a half I just been going going
