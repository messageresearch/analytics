thank the Lord revelation chapter 20 verse 4 just a reminder of this Sunday whether Simon will be preaching both services I'll be I'm flying out to Iowa on Saturday morning by God's grace and we're gonna preach these two services out there for brother Brooks so looking forward to that the Lord was really good last time where the Brooks keeps telling me one of the brothers there got the Holy Ghost when I prayed for him last time he said he's on fire he said can't wait to see you praise Allah a mess I like to see young men or anybody that gets the Holy Ghost and they just burn for Jesus and the brook said now he's like trying to he's trying to stir up the young youth and you know the teenagers in the early 20s and try to get them to do something for the Lord that's just that's wonderful that's what we live for you know eternal life you know that's what Jesus was talking about when he said whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven thank the Lord praise God God is so gracious and it's all by acts 2:38 amen thank the Lord that's the keys to the kingdom praise God revelation 20 verse 4 like to look at the Millennium tonight a little bit by God's grace I don't think I have time to finish it there's just so much on it I like to since we're in Revelation chapter 20 I like to look at the Millennium and look at quite a few quotes here from the prophet of God so revelation 20 verse 4 and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them I noticed Thrones multiple throne this name this at least means Jesus's throne and the twenty-four elders throne but I believe it could be more maybe in the Millennium prayer I'm sorry maybe the Menem Christ will have us your separate Thrones for all the bride members I don't know the Bible says we'll sit with him in the throne but we're not sure when that exactly is in his throne or it is just all the Thrones up there represent his throne we don't know exactly but one thing's for sure if we overcome we'll be in that throne that's the one thing we know that overcome the Beast and his mark today because overcome all that by the blood of the Lamb amen word of our testimony and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and catch us reigned with Christ a thousand years I and the word reigned there in the Greek means to exercise kingly rulership so they just they just don't live with Christ they reign with him and remember the scripture the Bible said Jesus has the rod of iron that rules all nations but he told the overcomer in Sardis that the overcomer gets a round of iron to rule over nations so what does he have he's the great leader he's the Messiah and were the Messiah we're little rulers under the big rule praise God that's right church verse fine but the rest of the Dead the foolish virgin and all the lost live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection verse 6 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection see how a church and a lot of people want to be blessed today but we don't want to just be blessed we want to be blessed but we also want to be holy live a sanctified separated life lesson holy is he they have part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years let's have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you again for this word help me Lord God I've prepared all these scriptures and in quotes but just Lord guide me by your grace and mercy you're able to to move me however the the people have a need Lord so just use me I'm nothing I know that I'm just reporting here for you for your call my life for my duty I'm just at my post of duty just like everybody else we're all in our post of duty we're happy to be here Lord God and father we ask that you just move by your Holy Spirit as you always do Lord God let's be humble enough to recognize your presence here tonight we give you the glory you promised to be here in Jesus Christ's name the church say Amen god bless yous B&C - praise the Lord so let's look to the Lord here I think I'll just jump right ahead to these scriptures I like to show ya smack I do have some quotes I got a lot of quotes actually then we'll look at these tonight by God's grace so I'm just bringing this scripture up here I want to look at this thought again how John sees Souls this is striking again my that are all in the Thrones right you sees Thrones and then he sees here souls that were that were there for many right not just one reason they're there for many reasons because there's ends in there there's ands so those that were beheaded for Jesus and for the word of God the Old Testament in the New Testament and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years praise God now they asked brother Branham about this in 64 they say could you please explain the group in Revelation 20 verse 4 are they part of the Bride of the past or in the future he says they are the bride completely both past and now amen not just the past that got beheaded it's the bride now as well they're the bride completely because they're living in the Millennium all right amen and now they ask him another there's more to the question they say so it's puzzling because the persecution of the bride but who else could they be in reign with Christ a thousand years would they be the 144,000 no they are the bride he said while they are beheaded for the witness now you say for they worship not to be sure but you say the Beast is yet to come the beasts has been all the time let me know that right because we know he's had four forms the Beast has a men the Beast has been all the time the Beast that was the one that fed them back there and then Lions dens fed them back there in the arena there in Rome so he's going back you know to the the turn of the first century there he says and that was the Antichrist that was the Beast right there set up a form of religion just exactly like almost a pattern the Roman Church was taken right out of the Bible when what when they did that they organized the thing and made an institution I made a universal Church out of it and all wouldn't bow down to it had to be destroyed it was amen and then he says and then in the part of the body that was then now the body has grown just like a tree till it's coming to the head see we all both martyr and persecuted and so forth so anyone who's in that Holy Ghost filled Church both martyr persecuted or those who just have to fight and contend with the Antichrist spirit they're all going to be on there on the throne amen now I just this I just caught this just familiar thought but I just want to give you a visible visual here the body has grown up to like a tree to that's coming to the head and I just thought of these two pictures so I thought I'd show it to you here's a restoration of the bride tree they start on the day of Pentecost there's all these Nicolaitans bugs remember the four bugs no man talks about cankerworm caterpillar there's all these bugs and as a tree grows you know the bugs eat away but here we are you know there's Pentecostalism you PC I was raised in some believe God Mormons Jehovah's Witnesses but here we are we're supposed to be we're a part of the book of Acts church that's putting forth a new branch and it's at the head of the trade praise God the Bible said in Romans 11 that we were grafted into the holy tree amen hallelujah so God made us one of those branches here awareness branch that's branched in this Gentile branch but he said don't get take heed that you don't get prideful he said because God is able to cut you off and graft in the jet the Jew branch right back into the holy tree and he will do that amen but as long as we're bringing forth the real fruit of Christ then we went when were grafted off we'll be raptured up to heaven amen that's a word to be work to be the bride that's reproducing the very same life of Jesus Christ amen at the very beginning and that reminded me again of the statue Berkman I just always liked this picture I'm just always reminded of it how Christ is the headstone no doubt he's the cornerstone as well we know that he's both the corner and the head he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end of her sin the last they meant but here he is he's the head of this as well he's the head of the pyramid hallelujah so I just want to give those again as a just a little visual there that everybody can see that just as a reminder I thought that was just so so beautiful the way brother Adam laid that out that is coming to the top of the tree praise God we're growing up into the top of the tree hallelujah amen now let me go back here and get a few scriptures I want to start back up here I wanted to start on some quotes about the the Millennium program said there's three comings to Christ to redeem the bride to rapture the bride and then to rule in the Millennium so you can always remember it's three comings by the three r's right redeem rapture rule praise God bro man tells us in blasphemous names I'm gonna skip down to the blue he makes itself perfected in three comings first time is to redeem his bride second time receive his bride third time in the lynnium with his bride and everything is perfected in threes praise God hallelujah now let's look at some Bible teaching from Isaiah 65 about the Millennium I'm just gonna put the exact quotes in here from future homes now in the book of Isaiah now you want to put these scriptures on Isaiah 65 17 Isaiah speak of the millennium that thousand years of rest for the people of God Isaiah spoke of it and said all the former things has passed away and how they'll build houses and habbit them maybe we just take time he said Isaiah 65 now begin uh Isaiah 65 17 I'm gonna turn there my Bible so I got it right laying right in front of me Isaiah 65 17 Church that's what the message came to do not to give us the ideas the human ideas of brother Branham but to direct us to the inspired ideas of the Bible amen and to restore all of the mysteries had been all the loose ends that we'd say of all the the laces have all been loosed but brother Ram came as a prophet to tie them all together praise God and that's what we thank the Lord for so verse 17 and behold I create a new heavens and earth and the former should not be remembered nor come into mine at some point we're not even going to remember the former world we're just going to be all caught up all filled up all soaking in the beauty of perfection amen other than because the Bible said Jesus will wipe away all the tears from their eyes amen and the former things shall never be remembered again I know there's a scripture I believe there's a scripture about that maybe I can find it real quick if I've marked it off I'm not sure if I have I don't have it marked off that I can find right now so verse 18 be glad to rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem our rejoicing and her people a joy and I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of cry alright now let me read this quote and III say I wrote the Prophet he said one of the prophets wrote exactly the entire Bible on his prophecy he starts out with the creation in the middle of the book about the for a chapter comes around John the Baptist the New Testament winds up there in Revelations in the Millennium there are 66 books in the Bible 66 chapters Isaiah he wrote a complete commentary now we find out he's getting the 60 here now we're getting the 60 bit chapter one more chapter and he speaks to the money 'm notice how beautiful behold I create new heaven and new earth and the former things should not be remembered or coming to mind it's to pass away be glad be glad and rejoice even in that which I've created for behold I create Jerusalem I'll rejoice and her people a joy now he reads all this scripture that we've already read and they shall not build and another and a habit that is your farm your son fall heir to it or some of your heirs they shall not plant nor eat another there they do their own planting and remain there they got eternal life amen so in other words mean Walter worry about writing a will in the Millenium praise God I'm not gonna give that land to any if I'm there I will give that land to anybody else it'll always be mine amen there's no more wheels there's no more giving away what you've labored for what you've worked and passing it on to someone else know that possession is yours amen hallelujah because they got eternal life hallelujah now and he goes on to read the rest of this here for is the days of a tree are the days of my people but Alexa long enjoy the works of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for their the seed of the Blessed Lord their offspring is with them so Malachi there's another core I don't know if I'm out here the Bible said he won't give I won't give my land to you but you'll have land right next to me if we both got the Holy Ghost you won't be spread out from your family you'll be with your family amen because it says the Ospreys with them praise God so my offspring if I got it if their they got the Holy Ghost they'll be right there with me amen I don't know you notice here's where I'm gonna get after a while and it shall come to pass now let's see what Scripture is he reading here let's skip ahead oh he's good to verse 24 and this should come to pass that before they call our answer while they're yet speaking out here and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like a Bullock thus shall be the Serpent's meat and they shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain saith the Lord he said what a promise of these prophets and the great sages teaches of the Bible way back in ancient day seeing this glorious day come hey man all right now okay yeah that's right so yeah he did read those all right no actually not verse 20 actually for some reason either he didn't read verse 20 or I didn't write it down verse 20 Isaiah 65 20 there should be no more offense and infant of days nor an old man that hath not failed his days for the child shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed now that's striking there's another quote I don't have it up here but I saw it earlier today I didn't have time to put up there my brother says it looks like there may be dying in the Millenium looks like there might not be but one thing's for sure after the money um's over and Satan is loosed there is dying after the Millenium so this scripture may be referring to after the Millenium what relief says it like see see how the scripture is it just mixed right in with all the millennium scriptures so that's why Miriam says you know it looks like it could be looks like it might not be but Ram said I don't know he said if I would if I knew I would tell you hey man thank the Lord for that hallelujah praise God okay now let's move on here I did those now by Madison just so you know I'm just gonna do a real quick review the new earth is not the Millennium but the madam says just as God create the earth in six days made the earth in six days or six thousand years as he said be not ignorant we read in the scripture one thousand years is one day praise God Peter says that in 2nd Peter 3:8 one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day praise God now there's the scripture we read earlier read that now notice though this millennial reign the thousand years is not the new earth see the millennial reign is a different reign that's what we go into the Millennium but it that isn't the new earth and new heaven no no that's just a rest play see a rest spirit that all the new heavens of the new earth for you see in the money and we have things that we would not go into that it's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden the seven day after he made the world the seventh day he rested and the Millennium praise God glory the Millennium is not the end of it there will still be time after the Millennium the my name is a space of time but not the new earth no indeed notice in that we'll get to it after a bit now I made this a long time ago I'm just going to go through real fast from what I understand this is how brother Ram teaches creation and then the seven church ages all right so the Millennium there is a seven-day so we have six days here of 6,000 years right now we're finishing the last six day the church ages right and then the eighth day will be the the New Jerusalem praise God the newer that's a new heavens and the new earth and I just got that little yeah I just got that little animation there that's so that's what it is Jesus is gonna he's gonna cap off the earth with a a pyramid home we know called as the New Jerusalem and nothing or her or destroyed and no abomination will enter that city amen hallelujah let me know homosexuality amen let me know fear amen there'll be no murders IV no defilement there'll be no cross-dressing amen there'll be nothing there it'll only be holiness and purity hallelujah nothing evil will enter in that place so we see that this the money of now is the seventh day and program caused another place I don't know if I just quote he calls it the Sabbath that's our Sabbath praise God hey we are gonna have a Sabbath day man a thousand years of rest no work or we say no no sin that's what it is - you are gonna work we're gonna build but there's gonna be no sweat to it amen glory sees that now the world has now almost 6,000 years old every 2,000 years it has a destruction and I'm just gonna pull it up here as you know this Christ returning to rapture his bride all right so every 2,000 years God does something great so we're looking for something great by God's grace amen the rapture amen now that's the seven church Aegeus praise God now then he burns are off and claims it for his own he puts his own back on it I noticed the perfect word this millennium it's a type of the seven day then comes the white throne judgment see we still have judgment we're still in time in the Millennium it's a day 1,000 years it's a time element now don't get that mixed up with the new earth no because it's not now I want to add this - I forgot to name this but Road Ram tells us in 1960 and the adoption series brother says the promised land that Israel went into does not type the millennium you'll hear people say oh we're going to get to our promised land in the Millennium well I guess in one way it is a promised land like it's promised to us but as far as the time with Israel coming out of Egypt going to the desert and taking the promised land Rivera said the Millennium and said the Millennium does not type the Promised Land the promise they had types or battle in the baptism of the holy ghost race got you coming out of Egypt represents crossing through the Red Sea water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ sanctification is the proving time God said I took you through the desert to prove you to see whether you would obey the Word of God amen and then acts 5:32 says God gives the Holy Ghost to all that obey Him amen so see the only people get the Holy Ghost are those who obey Him and all the elements of sanctification praise God and then they cross over into the promised land the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's where they really fight battles amen that's where they really wore a man and they drive out those seven nations hallelujah that's the spiritual type so the Millennium is not the promised land in fact what's interesting is program called Solomon he calls that a type of the Millennium which there's a huge gap between you know Josh were taking the promised land and Solomon there's a huge gap so that's interesting thought now I don't know how that all works out I haven't studied on that but he said because Solomon had a Golden Age there was time of Solomon's reign where it was total peace that was when the Queen of Sheba came remember it didn't last too long he only reigned 40 years but at the end of it the Bible said God got upset with Solomon I've been many times but just to remind you we have to watch out for the Solomon syndrome and we can't get lazy on God Simon got lazy on God because the love of women in other words he started spiritually fornicating right actually naturally and spiritually but we've got to make sure we don't naturally fornicate and make lots of things of the world right but ramstad denominations he said they can live so far from most sins he said but when they when they stick to their Creed's he said they're miss like they're making love to like a dead corpse so see like like Catholic priests for example or Lutheran priest they can live they can live pure sexually some of them might be able to but if they if they cling to their Creed rather than the true baptism the Holy Ghost but man says like that person is hang on a dead corpse making love to a dead corpse that's how much they love their traditions and their Creed's of men but we are Spade supposed to make love to Jesus Christ the word a living we must be we're dead to our old law and we're married to another that is Jesus Christ amen so see judge we're gonna be making love to somebody amen either a Creed the world or to Christ let's make love to Christ amen kiss the son lest he be angry amen we give all the kisses all the worship I love you Jesus we should give all the go because we gotta make love to somebody and we would have loved Christ they gonna make love to somebody hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord now see now the foolish virgin now look look at her she's a virgin so she does not fornicate she doesn't have intercourse with Devils because she's pure she's justified right and she must be pretty sanctified as well right but she never makes love to Jesus Christ nowhere she never gets born again she never gets really under the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I wish she doesn't make love to Hollywood doesn't make love to the music industry doesn't make love you know to sports and then famous individuals doesn't make love to that but she he's really giving our love all of our love to Jesus Christ amen let us enter into that chamber praise God uh they like Rebecca Isaac amen like the high priests and the hoist of Holies we got to enter in there and we got to know him in the power of his resurrection that's exactly right then there's no shame because that now you're clothed with power praise God you're in do with power from on high praise the Lord thank the Lord amen now so just so you know Israel coming out water baptism the desert signification crossing the land the promise that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost not the millennium because there was fights in the batches of Holy Ghost there was fights in the promised land there's no fights in the Millennium if you're one of those on the throne then there's gonna be no argued if you let's say you're on the throat let's say brother raised on the throne he's really low a certain portion of the earth and some of his constituents come up and say yes sir ruler brother ray we would like to take this land and plant this or that and Ray says no I want you to do something else I want you to do color or strawberries or whatever it is there'll be no arguing back and forth because this person brother ray or whoever be has a glorified body amen they have the glory of God upon them amen and all these people are predators multiplying and growing up they will not have that same type of then I haven't same type of authority a minute they'll not have the same type of authority and power that the believer has there'll be no arguing there there'll be no debating there it'll just be complete obedience it'll be the real true government the government of the throne of David amen amen it'll be glorious it'll be a golden age amen the Bible says your rule with a rod of iron power over Nations that's where the real Holy Ghost fell people not now there's cleansing now here's the cleansing before the money I'm now just so you know there's quotes on both sides but rod said there's cleansing before the money in which there has to be quarter Malachi 4 but then brother I've also said there's cleansing after maybe after the white throne judgment or something like that right so just so you know there's there's there's quotes on both so some of the scriptures may apply to you know before the money some may apply you know after the the white throne judgment so program talks about the sixth seal and then he talks about Armageddon now we've been through this I'm not gonna go this but this is where all stars fall from heaven you know the sixth seal with the two prophets oh you know nature breaks forth and I forget the exact units not much done right now but but the power over nature we know that now revelation 19 arm again went over that a few weeks ago remnant slain with the sword now rogram says in the Victory Day when she comes to the bow room again that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium arm again is going to clean off the earth so what cleans the earth the simpler the sword of the word amen what cleans out your life the sword of the word amen as long as the word is in your mouth it does the cleaning amen right because that's where Christ where it is it comes right out of his mouth and the word will do the cleaning she purifies herself with this atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and thing sinks this soaked blood of men upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth the volcanic breaks out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for people to live here Amen I say I like that I imagine we'll just be up in there after the sore goes out you know the birds get done with their great supper right sometime after that you will feel the starch the earth start shaking all of a sudden we'll see explosions and volcanic ash will fly up in there all over the world and hot magma will come out and lava will cover over the earth and every single burn and we'll just be standing there behind Jesus watching this and it'll burn in Oh cleanse and we'll see they'll be fire in his eyes Amen huh yeah because there's fire cleansing the earth just like the fire of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's what the baptism the Holy Ghost does to you right it burns out it burns out all your desires it cleanses your soul your soul is a new place for Christ enjoy hell amen come on and we watch a volcano after volcano it breaks out he says cleaning the earth wonder how long it'll be there brothers how long we watch the lava flow cover all the you know not down the force how long will we watch it the seventh seal says the millenniums coming up and see everything that it's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal now do you notice I'm opening the seven seals also three for mystery this one I'll speak I've spoken is a mystery the seven thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery let me write the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew what he returned now church none don't a lot of people stumble over this but don't stumble of this the RAM later says on tape the seven thunders were this were the seven revelations contained in the seven seals so see some people are really concerned about this like all we got to hear the thunders we got it I I believe we've already heard it we just gotta live it we just gotta live it that's real it's gonna come down to I'm not looking for maybe a new revelation I'm looking for just living what Hardy's been healed that's what I'm looking for praise God another looking for anything separate maybe a different met eight messenger some like that I'm not looking for that I'm looking for the bride to get a squeeze because that's what's gonna make us live the right way amen it's got to come in America it's God because that's the Beast out of the land amen it has to come out of here because the Spirit of beasts has migrated and who hears it of this land and raised up out of the land so it's got to come here and we'll see the bride get ready amen hallelujah now Jesus will sit on the throne of David in the money now my man tells us and is not jesus the son of David according to the fact that he will sit upon the throne of David in the millennium and reign and rule over us heritage surely so the key of David signifies it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium the key of David amen so Jesus has the key to take us into the millennium praise God Hey Oh because he has the keys to death and he'll will raise up his own paradis reign of the righteousness upon the earth praise God amen now mighty God available for us I'm skipping down the blue button the Millennium he comes as a son of David to set the throne on the throne of David Kay he was to take the throne of David he's on the Father's throne now and then he said he had overcome and shall sit with me on my throne as I've overcome and set on my Father's throne so he and the meriem he'll be the son of David what is it the same God all the time just changing his mask so I just found this pictures online I love this picture this is how I imagined when I pray you know right now he's on the father's from the Bible said he's on his Father's throne but in the Millennium he'll be on the throne of David or his throne and we'll call him son of David amen praise God so we see these three sons on a man when he was on the earth as prophet son of God son of David praise God so there is earthly ministry now he's in the intercession ministry but in the millennium East son of David praise God Amen thank the Lord now the foolish virgin will miss the millennium it is greater importance and wonder then imaginable look what he says here now I'm gonna just get just give me a minute here I'm gonna pull up these notes I wasn't really planning on it but I think I'll pull it up so I want you to see something here just a few scriptures all right yeah here we go it is the second and sorry it is the second resurrection we're in the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they miss being in the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of the bride but these people being is separated God loving people and trying to abide in the word I look they're always trying they're trying to live what the preacher says I don't want to try reaching should not be preaching amen where's the post margin they just try to do that brother Jesse I'll try to do that brother Samuel like you know ready I'll try to that brother Isaiah anyone who is just trying to do it they got to get past a try they got to achieve the word that the promise they got to receive the promise right there's more than just trying in fact there's a church age book corn I don't have it in front of me but but that says the only way you know you are an overcomer so church we gotta just not come to church we've got a look at our lives and say what do I need to overcome next hey we overcome what one step at a time foot steps are right possession so what steps is God asking you to take right now it's not just coming to church that's a good thing you got that step down if you're a faithful church member thank God for that amen but see those things that God is trying to lead you into praise God there's maturity there's ministry God is trying to lead us into that's what programs the - and programs life story the more I realize so so guilty and quit he just kept moving on with God he won the quit a couple times through his mother-in-law one time we listened to preachers one time in South Africa he listened everybody else but pretty soon he got to the point where God said you have to walk alone with me and mother said that's fine I'll be happy to walk with you Lord amen that's what we've got to do praise God see where God is calling us to walk into now I think for myself I think it's each person has to recognize the gifts in their life and be devoted and like my mentor said be just as interested in getting your gifts in their place in the house of God as the pastor is I believe that's what the Holy Spirit's calling everyone to do I believe that at least in our church because if not then we come to church and it's nickel late ISM where only the anointing is in the pulpit alright but what programs say God is the god of the pulpit he said God is the god of the audience right so see that's right that's truly my heart's revelation I'll be the guys show me through the scripture now that is the true spirit of the Holy Spirit is calling everybody higher to find your place and to be faithful with those talents he gave you or the pound which we'll get to that in a few weeks Lord willing remember they're 16 parables for the kingdom of heaven so we have to look at all 16 and we look at all 16 we'll be able to see what the kingdom of heaven is all about amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what it's all about amen right Church see try bush burn you're just trying to stay in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help and the work of the Lord will come up at the end time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truth is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed or they're going to miss the time where the saints will sit on Thrones judging nations and all the world but they're going to come up to the ruler of the nation they're going to the bush birds are going to miss that all because see the reason God can trust us to reign there is because we let Christ reign now amen Christ reigns in our life now and it's more important can you imagine Branson when Jesus steps into that Millennial temple program said that's the moment where the most holy is anoying today I didn't even let the 6-volt purpose of Daniel the last one is anoint the most holy aim and the holy heavenly anointing comes down to heaven and it sits in a throne as the son of David in the money of Jesus Christ takes his road and we we'll be right there if we're born again amen oh and they're gonna miss that all because they were foolish foolish to up being born again praise God that's the only thing they miss I was being born again right now we know some will be closer than others right like there are six things you can do to get salvation at the white throne judgment right you can close a Christian you can give them water give them meat you can take them in your house give them shelter you can visit him in prison or you're visiting when they're sick Jesus will give salvation to anyone that does those things to a Christian praise God so some will be closer than others amen we'll see we have to understand this that the foolish virgin misses it now here's why they're not responsible with their time they're not devoting their time to the kingdom of God like they ought to so it's patience 5 you just not some you know this have recall as I preach it a few times is right now you know I'm working on the next YouTube script I'm working on the wise and foolish virgins her brother Aaron brother Aaron suggested I do predestination I did that and it's been really a good video but a lot of people are liking us I've got some good feedback on that so thank the Lord for that now now this is so beautiful visions 5:14 it's perfectly in line with the parable of the ten virgins look at Ephesians 5:14 where for he says Oh wake now that sleepeth and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light amen remember the parable they're all sleeping why isn't foolish and all of a sudden the midnight cry went out behold the bridegroom cometh behold Jesus Christ is coming the rapture it's the message of William Branham wake up and get ready for the rapture amen that's what it was that was the shout it's the crying to go out and meet him trim your lamps and go out to meet Christ verse 15 see then that ye walk circumspectly now look that's exactly not as fool's but as well but they don't know they're not really knowing what they're supposed to do maybe I should do that and instead of giving their time and the Bible says later that they understand the will the Lord yes verse 17 wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will the Lord is amen they're just kind of something here stepping there but circumspectly means exactly or precisely so a wise virgin knows exactly what God wants them to do they know where their phones and they walk in that perfectly they know exactly they're not wandering from here to there and they don't waste their time the foolish virgin wastes their time not understanding the will of God what about RAM say he said to understand the seals to understand the symbols you have to take the rest of the Bible to understand the symbols I remember that we preset that's the same thing we're doing here to understand the foolish version the wise the 10 versions you gotta look to the rest of the Bible and that interprets it for you amen hallelujah praise God now acts 5:32 also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to those that obey Him so there's certain things about the foolish version they don't obey the directions to get the oil they don't obey that they're free from interacting and then loving the world they don't make love to the world but they still don't obey all the Word of God especially the baptism Holy Ghost now they go to Luke 11:9 let's look at this real quick here this was so beautiful precious I hope the Lord will reveal this to your heart maybe that's the purpose of tonight's message hope the Lord revealed TR Luke Luke 11:9 and I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock initially open you work remember that verse 10 for every one that asketh receiveth every one and he that seeketh findeth and him that knocketh it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread if any of you that's a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give a serpent or if he asks it shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion have ever given you a scorpion for breakfast maokai okay I got an eggs this morning though that's that's right verse 13 if ye then being evil those Pharisees know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him what no man say about the boys bhurji said the wise a good say go pray up is that right man see they just don't as they know they like being around the Holy Spirit you know the Bible says that you the bush version out of reach of message hell is the wise and foolish message I'm sorry the wise and foolish message believers I just want to make it so complain to everybody so they can see like the Buddhist version are right there to read or Lance for safe occasions understand they're knocking off the carbon off their wicks and they're pulling up their wicks but they're unavoidable they're sanctified they're not gonna have any little dress others not too tight not too short I'm pretty good you're pretty good looking good everything's nice for segregation right and they're hanging around I think and they like being around the lies they say can you give me some what you got si o si they're going to the wrong person again they don't want to make love to Jesus and now they're going to the believers [Applause] see there's a lot of message people that are around that like other people got the Holy Ghost but you ain't gonna get it for me to round them you got to ask Jesus in prayer don't forget Acts chapter 1 Church the Bible said they went up there for 10 days to pray 10 days they went up there to pray of supplication and have godly fellowship before the Holy Ghost come and then a lot of people say well I believe God sent a prophet I got the Holy Ghost no you don't you might got the anointing on your on your flesh might been baptized you might have a safe occasion anointing but you don't get it just by believing God's in a profit you've got to talk to Jesus about that amen so CHR Jesus says if if you know how to good gifts good give good give good gifts how much more will I give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him they just don't ask right they just don't get down here like there's the court I want to bring out yeah let me bring it out and this is what a lot of people really stumble on there's a quote where he says no more agonizing in prayer and it's after the seals agonizing in prayer yeah politics voting in and out saying this or that or the other like people politics and messy churches and the Holy Spirit has no more right away in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulture eyes down God denomination put their name on a book got lazy and soft and sets better gloating ha ha on some kind of dead carrier ha ha ha they're gloating about it princes they're going that I got a dead old word God sent a prophet now that's current word what I'm saying you've got to go past the gods and a prophet and find out what he said amen and receive the same Christ that he received how do you know it'll guide you into all truth amen that's how you know but see that's where we get a lot of message are just gloating I'm all right I'm okay and then supposed to be at least a honk that's a similar brother to the eagle the Prophet that brought the true word and manifested relies on the half ride man-made theology oh my goodness check let's see what I'm saying no more agonized no more asking the father right people in other words nobody a lot of people don't want to die out to the things of the world they still will love the things of the world see they don't really want to have prayer meetings and our prayer meeting is every Wednesday night 30 minutes before church every service and every Sunday morning at 10:30 our prayer meeting just so everybody knows we have to prayer meetings every week amen everybody's welcome to come but see this is the scripture we got to look to the scripture now go to Matthew 5:6 I know you like this one huh huh so this is all just striking me today as I was going through these scriptures she misses the millennium why she's virgin like she is not out there making love to Beyonce's songs she's not after watching The Rock's movies and making love to Hollywood she's not well then why don't she just enter in and make love to Christ she's foolish sure because she wants to do other things Matthew 5:6 well so they hunger and thirst after righteousness for they too busy on other things now the best illustration I think the easiest one for us is Abraham and lot right lot was a silver dollar I'm sorry Abraham was a silver dollar a lot was a penny what was law when Abraham said which way you want to go out what was he attracted by ah Sodom the plains near sound looked like he's attracted by money and then pretty soon he wanted political power because the Bible says at the gate and anyone that reads the Bible knows that the gates were they were the elders and judges the city right boys went to the games that bring me ten witnesses I'm by Naomi and Ruth all right ten I need any elders right here at the gate because that was the courthouse amen so luck got really caught up into the sodomite court system and politics and the money but the Bible said he was a righteous man see he took a little bit too much on the politics we like talking about politics in but we don't go too far right like we're like you're supposed to do to what you do you went a little too far on the money he kind of compromise to make a little more money he the by said he hung around the sodomites so much that every day affects his soul every day was the work he was just tormented tormented every day whenever I went to work it was glory what I had to do is just ask the Lord Lord I want to be there when the promised son comes but brother Ram said lot forgot about the promise see he was thirsty and hungry a little more for just the cares of the world I need to make a little more money to feed my children I need to make a have a little bit better job because I'm smarter right now I'm not telling you to take the lowest paying job I'm not telling you to do that what I'm telling you is to spiritually live so far away from Sodom that you can be like Abraham who had a trained army live separated and the son of man convicted him a man huh remember the son of man he said I'm not even going down in the sodomy I'm gonna send my angels or Robertson Billy Graham down there son of man ministry it's out there in the learners with Abraham because he's separated he's a friend of God amen he's hungry and thirsting for righteousness you know I was looking up Billy Graham and over obviously know Billy Graham and his wife cut her hair she wore dresses all her lives except I saw one picture where she had pants on right in the life she cut her hair she wore makeup but yet he fills stadiums that were so great hi sir he shook Bill Clinton's hand and Bill Clinton was a clear pure fornicator adulterer I wonder if he rebuked in church probably not but you can believe there are somebody rebuking Jacqueline Kennedy and now JFK you can believe that church amen when they heard they're not there's a manual and rebuking the fashions of the world the sanctification issues rebuking those because he knew if the people don't take care of those they'll never get born again you'll never get to the algebra if you don't get your ABCs right ha ha you know I found out to Billy Graham believe and he talked when you said I'm sorry Lord forgive me I'm repenting I'm becoming a Christian for the first time he said you're feeling all Dios Oh then he proves he wasn't perfect right man bruised he wasn't a prophet or albert's and bulldoze faith he prayed for 500 million just prayed to 5 right cuz he just bulldoze me bulldozing bulldoze me both ugly and people criticized brother ran for not praying for more feet height and burn actually go oh yeah me doing the angel says you're seen I think it was better his brother his gift was to reveal the power of arson my gift can't even hear you you've got to believe to be healed a man it's about touching Christ I knew it uh but you know Billy Robert same thing he thought his wife cuz then or cover her wear makeup sir and you know he talked about the only ghost you got to speak in tongues to get the Holy Ghost oh that's all the trouble with those men they're wrong on all these major doctrines and that's why they can never get born again praise God and church I appreciate a couple years ago I know six preachers that left the message and they're all wrong on the baptism the Holy Ghost some of them said you got it as soon as you as soon as you saw like a card like the man bro Graham story some of where we spent eternity some people took that quote and went too far with it some people said well you get it as soon as you turn that's just another Billy Graham doctrine some people said oh you got the Holy Ghost as long as you believe God sent a prophet and six preachers let's say that and all of them are on that side that side of the Holy Ghost without sensation but they never finished the quote but the Spirit of Christ doing the works in you the same works that he did in Christ so the foolish virgin doesn't really hunger enough for the baptism Holy Ghost is it thirsty enough for it doesn't really ask enough and you know our preachers recently you know Jesus offered the Holy Ghost to whosoever will twice twice let's read it John seven thirty nine thanks 38 so it is the you know church think about does Jesus invite the foolish version to get the Holy Ghost yes yes yes the food the foolish virgins were invited out sure they're invited out to them the bridegroom coming just like everybody else just like the five wise john 7:38 i'm sorry let's go thirty-seven in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink what do you say any man praise God that means me amen he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified that means David John the Baptist he not everybody else the most was the baptism in their human spirit not in their soul praise God they could never have the Holy Ghost in their soul because it could not be given until Christ is glorified why is that because the sins weren't really paid for amen oh but once Jesus brother William I said he said touch me not let me a sin to my father I've gotta go up there I got this money and we gives me a new body and after that he'll your souls clean it's white as snow it's white clean by the fleet to the flood and now my Holy Ghost can feel that so lame a hey man I tried to straighten somebody on that this summer they were saying well yeah I can live a life and I can sit like David he said gosh they'll be saved like David because David commits adultery and God still loved him he was mad for God's own heart I said sir that's not what jesus said jesus said the Holy Ghost was not given till Jesus Christ was glorified I said there's a difference and the church said man amen any man that would do that today not born again cuz we've got a greater power it was so powerful that Jesus breathed arms so like my man said Jesus wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than we want it but the wise will get to the spot where they're hungry thirsty they understand the will of God they asked for and Jesus gives it to him amen revelation 22:17 so see Jesus plainly offers that whosoever any man who wants to be a wise virgin give me a wise virgin revelation 22:17 and the spirit of the bride say come and let him in here say come and then him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him come let him take the water of life freely not goodness praise God that whole time Billy Graham stone you got the Holy Ghost well he was a thunder of a preacher wouldn't he I just like listening to his voice every now and then I'll turn on the turn Mike who is that Billy Ray I don't listen to him too often but he's got the voice of an archangel right when you tell them you're born again but that was an uncertain sound brother William hey if you repent you're born again and you're drinking the waters of life a little uncertain sound everything else before that was a good oh you gotta get saved got on your baptized course he's a Trinitarian he did father's with all the ghosts in that oh thank God that we don't have an uncertain stop we've got a certain sound and it's not say it the Lord how do you sometimes Billy Graham will be seven and brother I would hear that news that doesn't sound like it everyone else is like and they want to go make love to every other demons out there but Billy's thought Billy's like you already got it you already got no cry made a decision all right now my card I promise to come a hundred times a year to church sign the cards right then Burroughs that Billy Graham told him he said there's all the preachers fine thirty thousand converts I can't find thirty my dad said you ruin it wrong he said the way Paul did it went pulled in there he got three converse the next year come back he had thirty he said that's because Paul took him all the way to the baptism of the Holy but Billy was just saying you're filled already and I was they had maybe was the Red Sea they pass through the Red Sea and they're so happy ba made a decision praise God you got a long trip to go buddy there's more than trip to go and all Roberts he went over brother William he went over and he carried back the grapes and come back and said hey if you get these great oh you gotta be born together with you got a speaking tiny uncertain sound you got to repent you got to be baptized you got to be sanctified you have to hunger thirst ask and be filled with the Holy game and praise God this makes the difference between the wise and the foolish right the Y's are really hungry for it and the Y's are really thirsty for the Y's really want to make love to Jesus oh that's beautiful church oh my goodness go to uh I gotta look it up go to Luke alright I don't have it in front of me I just kind of came to my heart yeah Luke eight I'll just showed up here okay so the foolish version church is that third round not the fourth the fourth is the good grub the third one that springs up they got a start but they get choked out and they never bring forth the fruit of the Holy Ghost cuz they ain't born to the Holy Ghost yet so they can't produce the fruit of it that's right they impersonate it I like the kind no priest they impersonate it but it ain't the genuine fruit it's a human faith a human now human virtue human patients it ain't the real thing because when it comes to the word oh I need but there you said how to be read baptized they only got to talk to you about over there and they just got a look at your car praise God oh my god glory and that would spell mum thorns are they which remember these are foods versions they that have heard they heard the message go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life now listeners they're not even making love to it they're not even making love to the cares or the riches or pleasures because they're virgins praise God they're virgins but they just put a like lot like what they just put a little more emphasis on the cares on the ridges on the pleasures seems like they do they just keep putting it off a little bit no I'll sleep through the Holy Ghost next well I'll take some time and really get down to business with God once the kids are grown up I'll be a prayer warrior when I'm 50 you might not live 250 right see but what does the wise do redeems the time right now I know what God wants me to do right now foolish is like I'll try this I'll try but the wise knows exactly where God wants me to walk I know what I'm called to do I'm asking I'm hungry I'm thirsty and I'm receiving a new seat but on the good ground are they which an honest and good heart so see the foolish version are not really honest with themselves having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience here go to this one go to second Corinthians 7:1 I know this is a hard message tonight but you enjoyed I am I sure enjoy bringing it it's more fun to live it no sir not for is more joyous to live it I know yeah now how many Christians will read their Bibles about booze virgin and how many watch you fulfill just verse 1 of this of this chapter Sankar than 7 1 because most people just get lazier as they get older they get more laid-back I said most at all most people just try to obey my man said just try to soak in with the preachers of preaching rather squishing it out there just trying to just try to get something to kind of to wet me up I'm so Dharana cuz I'm I'm not born again just try let me soak up a little bit of the anointing see we gotta have anointing every day praise God amen singer these 71 having there affecting holiness in the fear of God which I'm not gonna say denomination which message believer you know cause the church with this attitude Lord and there's anything filthy but how many do you know that when they come out of church God's really butter and they're just they got the joy the Lord and they just they're going from glory to glory they're getting more victory they can tell you a testimony God just delivered me of this God help me with that I'm overcoming here how many got that testimony amen so see the Fouche version is not totally honest with themselves though if we have servant after servant you gotta be born again you gotta be sanctified you gotta be ready for the rapture those are all true but they're not really honest I know one time I did this but I said don't judge yourself by what used to be he said judge yourself about what you are right now don't forget you you don't dump yeah don't forget where you put your signpost down but also don't live back there but a forwarding tribe be honest with ourselves clock is a busybody as Bill Graham said oh this is good tonight amen thank you lord that whole time Billy Graham's getting over robbers to getting people wear short skirts wear pants I seen my buddies hanging another right there he got brother branham he's in a real small tiny church everybody's rejected him he saying you must be born again you gotta agonize in prayer you got to repent to that make up runs off your face ain't ah girl show me some dog me in a dinner and a demo church somewhere riding out making lunch of course repent be baptized get all the worldliness out perfect Oh holiest country stuff from all filthiness you must be born again [Music] because I did my duty I spoke in tongues what does i prophesy one time i sharted one time putting on my makeup or oh you know what I much rather take these pleasures over here then go to prayer me oh I use that quote I much rather do this it's more pleasurable than praying and seeking God how many want a good heart Church yeah that's ten or feet I'm going a good and honest heart yes that's the odds one of my greatest prayers right now Lord just help everybody in our church I'm not responsible for everyone out there I'm just responsible for this church right that's one of my greatest prayers Lord just give everybody in the honest heart and Jorge that's what I want too mercy we just went through the seasons right we all go through seasons I lose my confidence and pray for the sick but a man lost you know he lost his confidence of some of his gifts at times even for you for disobedience he lost the ability to use some of them right remember when he lied the angel said don't lay your line hands on the baby he could even exercise his gift cuz he send see there's times we get and lose there's all these seasons but the way to know is you're hungry and thirsty after right you're asking for it good and honest heart I thank God brother ray that we got a trumpet that declares a certain sound tonight I thank the Lord for that grace God that our prophet pointed us right to the Word of God that we have to live a separated life we have to live an honest life that we can't get caught up or choked up with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life my let's just bow our heads here for a moment as I God's grace this struck me so hard this morning I just had a preacher those things weren't my notes for the sermon I didn't get half of the money I'm thinking I just couldn't avoid that when I saw that quote but I said the first person are gonna miss out and it's so beautiful they don't even know what they're missing out we don't want to miss on that we need to redeem the time and just church the thing to do if you want to redeem it just act just do something just do five extra minutes tomorrow or just do five extra minutes tonight just start acting and pretty soon keep it right there and pretty soon like this like the parable says the man you see this growth in your life it's growing control [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
