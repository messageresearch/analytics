TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hey man what a powerful song that's the first I've heard of that one thing I could say is every time I come here I learned a new song I think today I've learned two so I've got to come here more often just to learn more songs but the scripture says Sing a new song unto the Lord so you know even even us as as Mankind we tend to get tired of the same old song the same old song so it's nice to hear a new song but not to say that the old ones that we put those away and don't sing them anymore they have their place too you know you hear an old hymn and you man I haven't heard this one in a long time and man I will put you in the spirit of worship you amen so the old is just just good with the new so thank you musicians and uh that's what I say thank you very much for the lunch today and the hospitality that's been shown to me and my family no just appreciate you all and I love you all and uh we weren't sure who we were going to do for lunch today so that tells me that brother Jesse didn't have any idea what y'all were planning today so uh it was very nice thank you for letting us be a part of it the it was good uh good being here this morning and looking forward to another evening amen so if you would uh we'll just go right to the word and uh Acts chapter 26. now I must say uh this morning speaking on the Midnight Cry brother amen sorry I guess somebody told me I called you Vang when I called you up by apologies I think I was just looking at brother bang and then when I looked at you his name just came out but uh brother amen told me that brother Jesse had just preached on that subject a little while uh just a couple weeks ago or something which I thought was pretty marvelous I almost asked this morning just the way that uh the Persona was almost asked was this just preached on but anyways uh before I came you know just praying about what I should speak on uh I was you know just praying about I wasn't sure actually a couple months ago uh I really felt led to come and minister to this group and I've told brother Jesse before I will not call you but if the Lord leads you to have me come speak you'll call me and uh so we we've had that relationship uh for years I have never called him and asked to to speak from his pulpit and uh by God's grace I won't ever have to because if the Lord leads he'll put it on his on brother Jesse's heart to to call us and invite us but it was about a couple months ago and and uh that message that I preached this morning that was uh that was really on my heart to to minister but uh I know you're standing so I'll keep it and try to keep it shorter uh I was also thinking on the way here there there was a message that I was thinking about and I I brought five or six messages with me uh today because I wasn't sure uh which way to go for the other message and before I got here I was thinking you know I'll speak on this one and and uh but after morning service I was back here praying Lord what do you want me to speak on on the the afternoon uh brother Jesse and I we got back from getting coffee from Starbucks and I don't drink Starbucks coffee if I don't have to uh but uh I like good old-fashioned Folgers and and uh Black Rifle I like those kinds of coffee but anyhow he was telling me that I think it was Wednesday he said he preached on isolation that that's that just about threw me back I said no way I got that message right in the back here and uh but I uh just praying about it and thinking about it uh I've got to go with what the Lord had led me on this after this morning's service so Lord willing we'll save it for another time brother that uh he also knows and I think I've told you all before that I don't go on uh I don't I don't watch the messages usually I would like to I'd like to watch his videos but I don't if I know I'm coming anytime soon I don't go on the website on purpose because I don't want to see what he preaches because I don't I want to be letter of the Holy Spirit you know I'm I'm addicted to something like that and you ask my family they'll ask well what are you going to speak on there's a brother at the church he just asked me that the other day and uh I keep it a secret I don't tell anybody it's I might have I might have said something six times in the last 20 years of what I'm going to speak on to somebody but I just generally don't like to uh tell people what I'd like to keep it a secret but uh because I want the Lord to work I want to see the the moving of the Lord and uh and I've seen it several times in case in point just this morning and I appreciate that so thank you for the feedback uh so if you would we'll just get into acts Acts chapter yeah Acts chapter 26 and verse 27. we'll just open up with this scripture and go to prayer it says King Agrippa believeth thou the prophets I know that thou believest then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadeth me to be a Christian and Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as I am except these bonds let's look to the Lord of Prayer Heavenly Father Giver of every good gift and the salvation of our souls we just thank you so much Lord I appreciate the song that was that was sung uh being invited out here and just uh just a powerful song it just tells of of how much you thought of us and and how powerful you really are and we just thank you so much uh for including us in that and uh Lord it's nothing that we have done because Lord we fall every day and uh we just depend on you to pick us up we we just bow our heads before you in honor and respect to know what we've when we've done wrong that we come before you with uh with that respect in our hearts to come before you to repent because we feel sorry for the things that we've done Lord we just feel bad for those things that just shows us Lord if that feeling wasn't there that just shows us how right we are in our hearts but Lord when we do something wrong may have prick us so much that that we can't deal with it any longer that we have to come and repent unto you father for there is no other power that we can come to for the remission of sins and and just the Forgiveness that you have for us and Lord help us to have the same heart toward others just as you have taught us to pray that if we want forgiveness that we ought to forgive others so father we just pray that you would be with us one more time this evening as we Minister your word and uh just pray that you would be upon me and just just pray that you would give each and every one of us inspiration this evening and uh just to hear your word and be blessed by it father we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated in that same chapter I'd like to go up to the the 19th verse where it says uh whereupon O King Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision is that our heart this evening I I know it's your heart that you want to do right you want to do what the Lord has led to do right but showed first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do Works meet for repentance now see notice what he says there in this next verse he says for these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me it wasn't so much the truth that he was preaching but it was who he was telling the truth to it was to the people that that that the the Jews tended to stay away from they avoided them because uh they just felt uh that they were unworthy and they didn't even want to touch Gentiles they didn't want to they did they didn't want to be associated with them it was a separation that the Jews didn't have uh relationship with anybody else other than Jews right so because Paul went to the Gentiles that's why the the Jews that's why the Jews were upset with him because he had gone to the Gentiles to let them know the same truth that they were supposed to know see verse 22 says having therefore obtained help of God I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great see he was not a respecter of persons just just going to talk to the governors and the Mayors and and the Senators and congressmans and people like that but he said to the small and to the great so he was preaching to the poor and to the rich and it didn't matter whoever he came in contact with that's who he spoke the truth to amen so we just we're just so grateful for God's ministers to do things just like that if you're poor you want to be spoken to just like a rich person right because you want to be treated as a human being you don't want to be looked down upon just because of the stature that you have just because you barely have 10 cents to to rub to two nickels to rub to your uh to your name amen so just being able to hear the truth as Gentiles we are a blessed people amen so witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which uh which the prophets of Moses did say should come he didn't say anything outside of the truth but what was already spoken amen that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles and as as he thus spake for himself Festus said with a loud voice Paul Thou Art beside thyself much learning doth make thee man see he thought he was crazy for going to doing these things going and having relationship with the Gentiles and telling them what lies in their scripture amen how dare you show it with an outsider see it was a club to them and if you're in a club you don't invite Outsiders and you don't share the secrets that are within that club to The Outsiders do you have to be a part of it if you wanted to know all the secrets but then in verse 25 it says but he said I am not mad most noble Festus see he even he even spoke with respect to Festus right uh even though that they're they're putting him on trial there he still spoke respectfully to Festus but most noble Festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness for the king north of these things before whom IO whom also I speak freely for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner verse 27 says King Agrippa believeth thou the prophets I know that thou believest then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadeth me to be a Christian then Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as I am except these bonds see he wanted everybody to be free and verse 30 he says and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them and when they were gone aside they they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing uh worthy of death or of bonds see they recognize that he didn't do anything wrong the Jews were just upset because he went and spoke to the Gentiles they went outside of the club see then then said Agrippa onto Festus this man might have been said at Liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar now some people uh reading this they might have the the same kind of thing as a oh man I wish I wouldn't have said anything then I wouldn't have to go to Caesar by them talking right here I could be a free man but sometimes we have to go through an experience that the Lord ordains and we still had to go through those things see it was ordained for Paul to go through that situation amen now see what I'd like to speak on this evening is moved not quickened so we'll we'll get into it moved not quickened or anointed but not alive now some people they get moved and that's it they can't go any further than that but the scripture tells us to go on to Perfection right we can't just say wow that was a good message brother Jesse wow that that just that just touched me right to my heart and then you go and do do what you're not supposed to do as soon as you leave there there wasn't anything real that was there it was just words that sounded good in your ears amen so those words might have been very moving but you've got there there has to be something with that move there has to be something to take place along with that amen it's not it's not good enough just for it to sound good but if it sounded good then you would do what what was told unto you amen but see a a a a painting doesn't get painted just because someone received an inspiration to paint the painting gets painted when somebody gets the inspiration picks up the paintbrush dips it into the paint and begins to paint not just because they received the inspiration but something touched them on the inside and then they brought something alive amen through an image I mean it's not alive that like you and I are alive and and breathing but you under they brought something out as a result of the inspiration but we must must not be hearers only but we must be doers of the word right so when we hear the word yeah that sounds real good yeah I really like that but uh I can't really do that now see when Jesus showed up on the scene things took place right people were moved in their heart something happened when Jesus showed up right see they they knew that something was about they they knew something was about to happen they felt a little bit different you ever notice when the presence comes about you you kind of feel a little bit different you might have felt down a few minutes ago but when you start singing Praise And and giving God the glory and start doing these different things how the feeling of your emotion will change from sorrowful unto happiness and and in a spirit of worship amen but the thing was is when Jesus spoke many people were astonished at what he said they couldn't really understand what he said but it was something different see people want to hear something different they don't want to hear the same thing all the time so that's how it is with a lot of these doctrines out there well we we got to start something different a different Doctrine because I'm I'm tired of all this Holiness stuff we we need to we need to magnify something and that's where man gets involved and that's where these false doctrines come from because somebody wants to look a little bit prettier a little bit more spiritual than the other guy it's not a competition we're preaching the same thing we ought to preach the same thing we're not competing if we're better ministers than the other that doesn't matter I'm going to say hands down I'm the worst preacher that doesn't it doesn't matter how good I am or not I'm preaching to myself now sometimes I get down about it but I I know I'm not the best preacher and it doesn't matter but he's the best God that's who we're preaching about if I can't bring God to you then I need to sit down so there's a difference between being moved amen we'll get into that Matthew 21. and verse 1. it says that when they drew an eye onto Jerusalem and we come to Bethpage unto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight away you shall find an ass tied and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you you shall say the Lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee not just some ordinary man but thy King cometh unto thee Meek and sitting upon an ass and occult the fall of an ass and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they sat them there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multitudes that that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna to the son of David now Hosanna is a term of adoration so when they're saying Hosanna they are adoring the man that's upon That Ass Up upon that gold right so they're they're giving a term of adoration to this man and it says blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and they're giving the highest adoration for this man that looks like looks like just a common man not realizing what the scripture says thy King cometh unto thee amen so he was more than just a common man now see and when they were come and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved they were moved saying who is this there's a whole group of people here well who is this person and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee now see not realizing that it was their King that was upon that uh that was upon that uh that answer they're just they're just saying that it's a prophet of Nazareth of Galilee some people just leave him as a prophet they can't go on to see him as a messiah they just stop it profit yeah he had a lot of good things to say are you obeying any of it oh right now see moved it means to shake or to agitate to cause the tremble of men to be thrown into a Tremor to Quake for fear metaphorically it means to agitate the mind now see when people saw this when they were when the people were crying hosanna in the highest they were throwing Palms in front of them they threw their clothes down in front of him giving him the highest adoration it agitated them in their mind well who is this type person who is this who is this guy so everybody was flocking around him because they thought it was some a man of great honor there's a governor coming to town is the President coming to town oh it's just the prophet of Nazareth oh it's just a common man but see they were stirred up they didn't understand they couldn't it was a confusing thing for them who is this man why is he drawing this big of a crowd what's going on Mark 15 and 11. it says but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas unto them now see again move means to shake up to stir excite and arouse now see the the when Jesus came into Jerusalem the people were moved so here the chief priests moved the people now see what this this moved it was a little bit different movement see we got all kinds of movements going on what which one is the right movement now see the chief priests they moved the people they influenced them so much to discredit Jesus that they wanted Barabbas instead of Jesus Amen see the different kind of a movement there it was an influence but it was of the wrong influence because it was out of jealousy but if we see the definition of of moved as an agitation or stirring up right see it's something that triggers an emotion but it's the action that happens after the moving that's what matters to show you where you stand amen so when you see something important you hear something in the word of God what's the action that follows that inspiration what's the action that follows your heart that was moved so much but see sometimes this this happens in in the church right you get moved you get into the spirit of worship and and then you're just so moved uh you just want to love everybody until you walk out the door then what happens to the love you you start yelling at somebody or you get agitated in traffic but what just happened in service I thought you removed I thought you felt the blessings of the Holy Spirit oh my this might not be real popular but sometimes people are only stirred up and excited but nothing takes hold people may get all worked up in worship service right some will be blessed and get the victory over something others might end up like a dog return it to his vomit I see it's the action that follows the inspiration to see quickened Romans 8 and 11. this should be a very familiar scripture to every Bible ready reader correct Romans 8 11 it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and what does Quicken mean I'm glad you asked Quicken means to cause to live it gives life it makes a life uh but it gives life by spiritual power to arouse and to invigorate I thought a pretty uh wow they used invigorate that's such a that's such a big word invigorate [Laughter] okay well what does that mean I didn't get the dictionary definition but but it's a it's like an extreme uh stirring up amen it's a it's an extreme excitement to invigorate to restore to life to give increase of Life thus of a physical life of the spirit quickening as respects the spirit endued with new and greater powers of life and metaphorically it's of of seeds quickened into life germinating springing up growing it means that something has taken place and something is growing something has died on the inside metaphorically about seeds something on the inside has died that's the old man but I've taken on that that movement that's that's something that just came into my heart I can't explain what it is but something's changing from the inside something is happening because I took God at his promise amen it was more than just an inspiration to you it's something now see Christianity isn't isn't just a religion it's a way of life it's a habitual way of life you have to make it become a habit to you it's not just gonna just it's not just gonna happen well those were good words and and uh yeah we want to live by that but if you don't recite them if you don't read them if you don't put them into practice it's not going to do anything for you it just becomes babbling now there's a key difference between movement and action I know I'm getting real uh physics you didn't think you were coming for a school lesson I'm not going to get too deep into the physics but trust me that there's a but if you don't trust me go check up on me uh between movement and action see movement is an effort it makes you feel like you're you're doing something or you're getting somewhere busyness and effort without progress is movement busyness and effort without progress boy you sure look take for instance people people will work harder to get out of work than just actually doing the work that's called laziness trust me I see it you will see people do more work to get out of work I don't get it I don't understand it just do the job you'd have been done in 10 minutes if you'd have just done the job you were supposed to do instead of taking two hours piddling around not doing anything now see that's movement just just moving around making it look like you're doing some work but little progress Luke 10 and 40 it says but Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said Lord does thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she helped me now she was busy but what was she accomplishing a clean house okay Mary had chosen the better part to sit at Jesus feet and hear truth right you could do the dishes anytime but when Jesus is present give him everything give him your time amen you've got to take time away from those things and give Jesus A Time amen see that's the difference between the Mary and the Martha Martha is just busy and covered about and all worried about uh the the cleanliness and are my shoes shine today well ever something else way better is going on we're not we shouldn't be concerned about the little peddly things we have to be concerned about the important things amen preaching to myself again now action action is effort with a meaningful objective it's accomplishing something action makes something it has you accomplish something something is a finished work when you put action to it or at least it's a begun work anyways but there's something being done when you take action second Peter chapter 1 and verse 21. it says for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost see but holy men of God spank this is the action why what caused the action that they were moved by the Holy Ghost see in in this moved in this scripture it means to be led or to carry a burden see it's a little bit different definition from the move that we heard a few minutes ago see this is why it behooves us to look at the meanings of words see move means to be letter to carry a burden of the mind to be moved inwardly and prompted it's more than just being inspired being led it's being prompted to do something see we can't force people to to see what we believe right you wish just like just like Paul was telling Festus and Agrippa I wish to God that all of you not not just King equipment not just Festus but everybody in this room that could hear me I wish that they would be in the same condition as me I wish they could see the same truth that I carry this is why I go through the perils that I do this is why he worked so hard and went through what he went through so others would hear the truth this word isn't just for us to Harbor in our hearts it's given to us to share where would we be if somebody didn't share the gospel with us amen now see we can't force people to live as we do people see the sisters and I can't wear skirts all the time I did just address this thing that's just an old-fashioned thing you know but you stand as a witness hey amen you stand as a witness amen it's not for everybody because they can't see it yeah see we're the elect we could only speak the truth the elect can only speak the truth right the bride isn't going to speak anything false not intentionally right right so as we speak the truth we must live the truth that's how people are going to know that it's the truth not just because of what you say it's because of what you do to back it up amen see people think uh it's too modern of an age to live something so old-fashioned but we are a witness against them as long as we stay true to that as long as we stay true to the truth Lord I'm going to read a quote now this is kind of in the middle of it so he this is he's referring to a correction by the word uh that brother Branham was in in this message it's in the anointing ones at the end time so if you want to go back and read it it's before paragraph 124. but he goes on to say this he says oh so many things how could we just go through it our time would be a way but you know enough to know what's right and wrong and how can I make them do it you can't make your child do what's right all the time you teach them to do what's right but it's up to them if they're going to do it right or wrong or not it's up to them if they're going to be obedient or not the same thing with us God can't make us do what's right he's told us what's right it's up to us if we maintain what's right but it's also our responsibility if we don't do what's right it falls upon us I'm going to say this if you've got the true spirit of God if there's correction that comes that's where it stands if you could receive the correction you know you have the spirit of God Amen if you can't take the correction no matter how hard it cuts no matter how embarrassed it makes you if you take that correction oh my that's the difference between the serpent seed and the god seed the god seed can take the correction so how could I do it you say well what you hollering about I'm a witness against you he says someday in the day of judgment you'll have not a corner to go into you won't have a place to hide because I have not shunned to declare the whole gospel amen I have not shown to declare the whole truth before you I am not shown to declare the whole gospel right and I am not ashamed of the Gospel but I will speak boldly of the truth amen and when I speak that truth when whether you accept it or not if you don't accept it he says you won't have a corner on that Judgment Day to hide yourself in because you know that I told you the truth and it was up to you if you were going to obey that truth or not you won't be able to blame me on that day is what he's saying the only person that you have to blame is yourself now see we can't walk blaming others if we did the wrong we've got to fess up to what we did wrong amen you can't blame your wife you can't blame you children you can't blame your boss you can't blame your neighbor you know you did it so just man up or woman up and say that I did it and I was wrong and move on amen that's the whole thing about repentance but he goes on to say how could Micaiah stop that how can Moses screaming trying to stop it and we know Moses this morning we talked about how Moses got so angry when he spoke the truth but we know that it was God that hardened Pharaoh's Heart Right Moses couldn't stop it if he wanted to but how can Moses screaming trying to stop it and Joshua and them running among the people and Levi Levi he pulled a sword and slayed them even they went on just the same amen but it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for it's thus saith the Lord they're going to do it you think them nominations he's talking about denominations will ever break up their denominations come back to the word it's not going to happen it's thus saith the Lord they won't will they go into the Antichrist exactly he says it's thus saith the Lord they will so what are you saying about I have to be a witness and so do you and he says all believers amen see the place that you got tonight that you're going to be a witness to stand against those that that defy the word of God Amen now see it's got to be the right kind of vessel in John chapter 15 and verse 1. he says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband in every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away see if you're in him you've got to Bear the same fruit as he is and every branch that bearth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you now I think I was reading that earlier and I didn't catch it I preached this at the home church and uh I was reading through that scripture and now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you I think that's going to be another message Brewing praise the Lord but now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you oh why didn't me and I and you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself accept it abide in the vine because that's where the life is no more can ye accept ye abide in me I am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned now we know that every seed shall bring forth of its own kind right so a maple tree is not going to bring forth a pine tree right now see you could be grafted in into the tree a branch could be grafted a a branch from One Tree let me specify that a branch from One Tree can be grafted into another tree okay you could be grafted and you could be supported by the life of the tree but if you are of a different branch of the tree you will bring forth your own fruit the same works that I do shall you do also right that's what Jesus said in John 14 12 the life is in the tree he said I am the vine and you are the branches without the vine there is no life so without the life you won't exist but you must be of the tree family you can't take a gorilla's arm and graft it into a tree I know that seems silly it seems Elementary but it has to be of the tree family you can't take something else and put it into another tree it's just not going to work see if it could be if if it could be a gorilla's arm it wouldn't be so close that it could deceive the very elect right because it would be so blatantly obvious that's that that's not part of a tree that's part of a gorilla you see what I'm saying it's going to be so close that it would deceive the elect if possible so just because the branches is grafted into a tree doesn't mean that it's going to Bear the same fruit that that tree is and that's how you're going to know we're Fruit inspectors right well what kind of spirit does this this person have well look at the fruit of his life that's going to tell you what kind of branch is grafted into a tree by their fruits that you should be known right so you might come to church and you might experience the moving of the Holy Ghost but if that Holy Ghost isn't anchored in your soul then it meant nothing you could almost get the same effect at a rock and roll concert right I gotta I gotta de-strangle myself here I feel like I'm being choked out amen you can get the same feeling in a rock and roll concert well what do you mean by that well brother Branham said he's seen which doctors and and these different uh people that weren't Christians speak in tongues so the so the spirit can can fall on a false vessel and you can feel the same feeling in a rock and roll concert it's the atmosphere that you're in you go to a tractor pull sometime you might not be into tractors or truck pools but if you just like that that Roar of the engine and just you know it'll stir up a man I don't know about a woman but usually it'll stir up the man whoa yeah oh I'm not even in the tractors yeah but you just get into the moment you get into the atmosphere and you and you do the Harare with everybody else that's screaming and shouting the same thing in in in in a worship service you see one person jumping and shouting what by golly I'm going to jump and Shout because I'm getting excited too you go to a rock and roll concert people are just jumping and thrashing I never got the headbanger thing but you know if I did that I'd get dizzy and pass out I don't know how they do it but they do it but they get they get an inspiration in there you get into that atmosphere you're gonna feel something it might not be something that you want to feel but you're going to feel something in there and it'll cause some people to just do some uh some weird stuff in a mosh pit what are you doing anybody know doesn't know what a mosh pit is they run into the crowd and they're they're expecting the crowd to to catch them and or they're just in the in the pit and they're just bouncing off of one another you know what kind of stuff is that it causes it causes you to do some weird stuff now see they think the same thing about us don't get that wrong they think that we're weird too so so you say you want to get in the presence of the Lord and do righteous things amen amen it said in the scripture that now we know that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost right that's just a fringe benefit that with that that's one of the gifts of the Spirit that we would get to do if we got in the presence of the Lord right so but we know that uh Paul said though I speak in tongues though I not don't have charity I could have uh I I could have all Revelation I could understand all these things all these Mysteries I could speak in tongues I could I could prophesy I could do all these spiritual things but if I don't have love it doesn't mean a thing so if God is not in it it's just movement it's just moving there's no action it's just movement you're just Treading Water that's all you're doing you're not swimming to the bank and then then you drown because you can only tread water so long take Peter for instance I didn't know that until this now but take Peter for instance he walked on the water for a moment and then he started drowning that Lord help me he can only do it for so long but without the master did Jesus say without me you could do nothing amen praise the Lord this is a quote from the another quote from the anointed ones at the end time he says why why can't he fly because look what he's been eating on he's been eating on Rotten denominational carry-on that means dead and decaying flesh that won't spiritualize his body it won't put him in spiritual Fitness in other words to to carry him up to the denominational or excuse me carry him up above the denominational differences see he's just fed on Rotten stuff that's not going to bring you a higher that's going to keep you down here it's going to keep your EarthBound excuse me see he's just fed on Rotten stuff his body is made out of that he can't go up there where that fresh meat carries that eagle he just can't do it now see we're talking about that everybody can't see what we see he says that fulfills Matthew 24 24 false Christ and the prophets that their signs and wonders would deceit the very elective possible see he's flying jumping up in the air flopping his wings but he just can't get high enough it's movement but it's not attaining anything but he just can't get high enough see that's right see he can't go he can't reach high enough to get that fresh Manna he can't he can eat the old man that's down here on the ground the old Dead Rabbits has been run over a week ago and a month ago and 40 years ago contamination he can eat that and just glowed over it and squawk and holler and carry on jump jump up and fly like another Eagle see he's anointed like another bird another bird amen there's a difference and he is a type of an eagle but he's not an eagle he's a type of an eagle a buzzard is he says we know that he sure is but he can't follow the genuine Eagle see he just can't do it no sir his body isn't built he's been eating on different carry-ons see and it won't be the fresh meat the fresh Manna it'd be something that Luther said something that Wesley said something that Dr so and so said it won't be on what Jesus said for this hour I say it goes back to people once and these people once they want to look so spiritual and so much higher and more revelated than somebody else that they come out with something new it's wrong but it's something new right because they can't carry on with the truth or they willfully ignore the truth amen I see some people just can't see that's where we are to thank God that we're able to see and give God praise that we're able to see what we can see in this hour we were privileged people it's not that we were somebody great that he's oh brother Jesse's such a great guy I'll pick him and brother amen he's another great guy he's Above the Rest I will pick him it wasn't like that he's not a respecter of persons amen but it's whosoever will that will come unto him and whosoever will that will accept his truth it's whosoever will that will go when he calls upon them it's whosoever will that will move when he inspires amen if we don't go who will now see if we go to John chapter 9. and in the 28th verse brother can I get another water please it says then they reviled him and said Thou Art his disciple but we are Moses disciples but you know if you were Moses disciples you would recognize what Moses spoke of amen so verse 29 he says we know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is talking about Jesus we know what Moses talked about but for this guy we don't know where he's from keep in mind they never met Moses either they didn't know who Moses what they knew of Moses so here they come talking about we knew Moses no you didn't but you didn't know Moses you know what Moses said that doesn't mean that you knew Moses for we know that God spake unto Moses if as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered his son under them why herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes you can't see it but I know he opened my eyes I know where he came from amen the people that should have known who he was couldn't recognize him verse 31 now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth His will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind amen not once in the Old Testament did anybody ever hear of eyes being opened but now this man comes and opened my eyes and you say you don't know who he is or where he's from but only God you know that only God can open eyes so if only God can open eyes who is this vessel being used amen get you not seen who's in front of you amen I don't know where he came from but all I know is I once was blind but now I see try to take that from a blind man try to tell him that he didn't see anything real try to sister if you if you were born crippled your ankle you know you couldn't walk or anything if God healed your ankle instantaneously and you were able to rise up and walk and run do you think you'd be screaming and shouting and telling people that God healed you I would be you might be the bashful type foreign but I know I would be How could somebody ask a question from whence he is he just opened my eyes that's how I know where he came from I might not know the scripture like you know the scripture but I tell you one thing I don't really need to know the scripture for the presence that I was just in amen all I know is once I was blind but now I see hey amen Lord now he said if you was Moses disciples you would know me for Moses wrote of me the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet likened unto me amen they claim to be but they wasn't because that they were so steeped in Tradition see tradition is like handcuffs to a prisoner they can't go any further because they're bound they're Bound by tradition they can't go on any further they can't do anything else because that's all they knew is what somebody else had told them because they didn't have that experience that's why it's so important that you have your own experience with God that way when somebody says where is your god that you're waiting on that you keep telling me about well you just touched me this morning that's where he is you want to know where he is he's right here I came with me every day amen I don't know how and I don't need to know how all I know is they told me that I needed a hip replacement but by a prayer of faith I don't need a hip replacement that's how I know you try to tell me that there isn't a God in this day I know that there is a God that lives in this day amen because I've experienced it amen you can't tell somebody that God doesn't exist when somebody's done experience it just like these priests were trying to trying to swayed this guy he did who is this guy he didn't really he didn't really heal your eyes did he uh yeah because I was born I couldn't see but all of a sudden this morning I can see something had taken place it was more than just an inspiration I felt the inspiration in there but something came alive Within Me amen something was manifest it wasn't something just sitting there idle a good word a little plaque that we oh I like that little motto right there I want to look at that every day it's more than just a motto it's more than just a philosophy it's a way of life amen and it's truth that we live by amen [Applause] see the fall rains on the just in the unjust the spirit can fall on anyone but a true vessel would be sealed with it amen gifts and callings are without repentance and there's the difference some will just be moved where others others will be put into action amen they will go on to Acts 2 38 and they will go on to Perfection they will put on all righteousness meekness kindness and humility there will be a change and there must be a change that takes place then when the time comes they will go on to a body change praise be to God isn't that what we're looking for we're looking for a body change amen and remember what you are here is what you are there see you're just in a little practice time here because you're practicing here to become something of what you're going to be there there's no changing when you get to the other side the change it takes place right here it's different if you've never heard anything about the word but you'll be held accountable for what you do with what you do know with much knowledge comes much responsibility [Music] so when you hear the word and you don't perform it there's no Corner that you can run and hide to because the truth has been declared to you it's up to you if you accept that truth and go on to Perfection or if you stay idle and just sit in a cesspool of death amen you want to be happy sitting in a cesspool I urge you to go to a frog pond where there's just all this algae and all that to see if you want to swim in something like that there's a cesspool for you go to go to a Hog's wallow see if you want to roll on that for a little bit amen I want to move on with life where the where the water is pure as could be amen amen I want the the Living Water amen I don't want some some dead wiggle tails in my water I want pure water amen praise be to God you know when people just kind of talking about about your ankle here you know when people were healed in the in the New Testament when they came in contact with Jesus they couldn't help but say something even when he gave Specific Instructions to say he might have said go show the priest what's happened here today other times he said see that you tell no man about it so do you think that man that was born blind open his eyes open you think he was keeping quiet you think that man at the gate when he rose up when when they said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee and he was healed and he rose up and he ran the first time I ever ran you ever see a baby try to walk on their first day it's not going to happen so how does a man that's never walked before how does he instantly walk all right there's a time if anybody's ever had surgery on a on a limb if you've ever broken anything it takes time to heal so when you during that time of healing it just sits there and it does it does nothing except to heal you can't see the healing process but it's a process so all that time that you can't use it because what they tell you is you go home and you rest and don't use it uh just just rest that's all they tell you to do that's all you're supposed to do because if you start doing all kinds of things if you broke a leg if you start walking on it you're going to break it again and then it's not going to heal right so rest is something that that's needed right so what happens after about six to eight weeks 10 12 weeks of not using something yeah I broke my wrist when I was 14. had surgery on I had a pin put in it got out of the cast you think I can move that thing like like this one nope couldn't do it it takes time and it takes exercise it takes Physical Therapy it takes you moving it and getting used to moving it again so how does this guy that never walked before how was he able to walk as soon as he was healed I don't know because I I think we would have to practice walking first right so there's another miracle not just that he was healed but he was able to walk amen just a little side thing there for you so amen but you know when Jesus told some people to be quiet I don't think they could be quiet I couldn't keep quiet that's just because I'm loud anyway but take somebody who's quiet take Emma for instance she's quiet she's bashful she doesn't say much she'd probably be running screaming if you had a broken leg or something and you were healed instantly I'm sure you'd be telling somebody about it wouldn't you I know I would you'd have a hard time keeping me quiet you know they tried to silence uh who was a Poland Silas they were trying to don't you dare speak in the name and don't you speak Jesus name again they put him in prison right do I have the right people Paul and silence don't don't speak in the name of Jesus anymore and we'll let you go free isn't that how some some people are you know I'm in the Civil Air Patrol I'm a uh uh a character development instructor you know what they told me when I first joined on to that there was a a chaplain that was he had to do a phone interview with me before I could do this uh character development stuff it's a what he told me was uh if you if you pray for somebody you can't pray in the name of Jesus well that's the only way I know how to pray and that's the only way I'm going to pray I don't care what you tell me kick me out I'm going to pray in the name of Jesus why because that's a scripture that I believe it's okay to hold other people down or the Christian's down but you can't hold other people down all the other religions could do what they want to do but don't pray in the name of Jesus see they want to restrict Christians oh why because the devil wants to restrict Christians because he knows the power of Prayer amen amen now see putting into action we need to be we need to be put into action not just moved not just hearing the word and thinking oh that just sounds wonderful and then go back to watching Disney movies the Frozen right we don't want to be frozen but we want to be on fire right we want to overcome that Frozen condition amen we don't want to be stiff-necked uncircumcised Christians amen but I want to be full of the fire of the Holy Ghost amen Ava praise be to God Glory now Jesus told this Parable that this is a a certain man with two sons Matthew 21 and verse 28 he says but what thinky a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work today in my Vineyard he answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said I go sir and went not whether of them Twain did the will of his father and they say unto him the first Jesus said saith unto them verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you the ones that are supposed to be the elect but now I have chosen publicans and harlots the lowest of the low to go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you amen excuse me kingdom of God I don't see much separation there for John came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed him not but the publicans of the harlots believed him see God is not a respecter of persons I know you keep hearing me say that but that's so important through the New Testament he didn't pick just a hierarchy but he picked the lowest of the low why because they gave him honor they believed him they took him at his word amen besides that what else did they have to lose they were already low how much lower could they go amen but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that you might believe him oh my God that shows what Spirit they were of right whoo oh my that could get a little thick in some atmosphere in some congregations but there have been several moments take place in the last decade excuse me movements did I say moments I meant movements there have been several movements take place in the last decade you've got defund the police you've got the me too movement you've got BLM you've got the pro-choice movement you got all these movements out here but what are they accomplishing if you look at it you don't you ever hear the saying follow the money that's a true statement you you look at these charitable these charity organizations I I can't remember what was that uh United Way I think that might have been it's I could be wrong so don't hold me to that so if I'm wrong don't hold anything against United Way if I'm wrong I can't remember which one but there are a lot of Charities several Charities out there that oh give to the poor you send us some money we'll we'll distribute it to the poor you know how much goes to the poor about five percent or less or less sometimes none at all but the CEOs of these charity organizations makes millions a year a year so where is all that charitable uh money going to it's not going to the ones that you thought it was going to go to the ones that you had a good heart to give to oh this organization is going to take care of these people they're not they are corrupt they are corrupt I don't understand these movements I I I get what they're trying to do but I really don't understand it's usually a self-serving motive that's usually what's behind these kind of movements it's because somebody got got inspired well we're going to go out and make a difference to what your opinion a lot of several of these movements they completely disregard facts I said well I don't think that's right well whether you think it's right or not it's it's what is you got to look at the facts of the thing you can't just make up make stuff up just to tailor to your movement right it doesn't work that way when you see a movement going in that direction you know it's a false movement pay no attention to that thing because usually the money is going to go to somewhere else other than what you attended intended it for all right I was going to say something but I can't remember oh yeah that's what I was going to say you get these people that say well I see an injustice so I somebody ought to do something about it why not you you see the Injustice you're crying out the Injustice usually it's a lot of ones that are screaming out against an injustice that sit on the bench and do nothing all they did is just like the the Jews that moved the people to choose Barabbas over Jesus it Rouses the people to such anger to see their that that one person's Viewpoint and they they do themselves a disservice because they don't go back and and research something they just take the the one Prince yeah that sounds right that sounds right that sounds right but it's wrong and then they go under a false pretense okay you get these rich people these millionaires that are complaining about injustices of of certain groups okay if you feel that strongly about the Injustice why aren't you broke why aren't these rich people broke because if they believed in it that much they would spend every dime to see that their purpose and their cause was carried out they would be broke they would be shoulder to shoulder against the other poor people it's just gain saying it's just smooth talking stirring up the people for self-serving motive amen that's the truth not just because I said it look at it research it look at these people like I said it's usually the loudest ones that's crying out that do nothing they expect other people to do the sacrifice why because they don't want to lose their status in case if they get into something a little sticky situation even when people they try to do good people try to hold them to something they try to find dirt they try to criticize something they try to find something negative about it to tear it down right absolutely the truth wow but the problem lies where people can get so moved and inspired but they just can't get over to be quickened just like the parable of the thorny and Stony and the good ground they can only go so far with God why because there's only one good ground if it's of the Stony ground it can't be of the good ground if it's a thorny ground it can't be of the good ground but we ought not to be so prideful and say well I'm of the good ground I'm of the good you know it's not something like that we are privileged people amen without Christ we can do nothing right they could be right there at the threshold and then just give up just like the Rich Young Ruler see he came and he knew the scripture when Jesus said what is the greatest Commandment that you should love the Lord God with all thy heart with all thy mind and with all thy soul and he says you know you're not far from the truth but there is one thing one thing if you know that there was one thing keeping you from Heaven what would you do we would take care of that one thing so that one thing doesn't matter anymore right we would put that one thing behind us and take a step forward to life that we would be quickened amen see some people just get to that threshold and then think times get a little bit tough they could almost make it they could almost and they just give up and they're just right there at the threshold if they would have just taken one step further they would have overcome the situation one step further that's why I say hold on a little bit longer hold on don't give up but hold on cleave unto that which is good amen we talked about this morning about Cleveland you know I think it was in the Old Testament where the warrior was he was fighting so many people and he couldn't take that sword out of his hand and because why his hand cleaved to that sword he couldn't let go he couldn't even pry his fingers off of it he was holding on so much because it was a habitual thing that he made it a habitual life right there he clung onto it he wasn't letting go this is the truth I'm going to hold on to this every day of my life amen this is what's going to get me through amen hold on just a little bit longer amen and what happens with that it's usually frustration despair sorrow somebody might say a negative three it might be something critical that somebody said which if you just let that roll off like water off a duck's back see sometimes we just take things too personal we might take it too personal yep I'm guilty of that sometimes you know it might not even be meant toward me but you know sometimes I I just take some things personal you know and uh so that I get I get a little discouraged here and there because I my wife lets me know about it so well you don't have to take it personal while you're right but I just this isn't right you're not even involved but it's the principle honey it's the principle [Laughter] see we justify our we justify ourselves to stay in something that we don't belong in yeah excuse me but James 1 and 12. it says blessed is the man that endureth Temptation blessed is the man that holds on through the Temptation blessed is the man that that overcomes the temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him amen we got to stop waiting for somebody to make a decision for us amen stop waiting for somebody to step in for you but take the action and be filled with the Holy Spirit you don't have to ask your parents for permission to get get the Holy Spirit you don't have to ask the brother Jesse's permission to read the word of God you don't have to ask us permission can I come to the altar to to get prayed for can I come to the altar to to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to ask these things you don't have to ask your parents you don't have to ask your wife you don't have to ask your husband you know when I was before I get in my heart I think I gave my testimony here a little bit yes and and I felt the pull of God and I said something to my wife do you have to be a member of the church to go up and and get prayed for it and now you don't have to be a member of the church go and get prayed for you don't have to ask permission it's because I didn't know I didn't know the ways the the way that I was still new to it I didn't know the ways of of how the church uh had their order you know I didn't want to overstep my bounds because you you can only do certain things in a denomination if you're not a member you're not invited to do certain things is that right but you have to be a member how do we become a member of of this church I don't know how you have it nearby laws but you know I know in our bylaws we don't have any membership dues we don't have uh any Apostles Creed that you have to recite you don't have to you don't have to be able to recite the Lord's Prayer you don't have to do this you don't have to do that you don't have to go in pairs knocking on people's door you know uh and and talking about a prophet that that's a welcome thing if you're talking about the truth I'm talking Jehovah's Witness sorry I shouldn't have said it but but you don't have to jump through hoops for an organization you don't have to jump through hoops here to become a member right you can just come and you support the church you come and you say I want to be a member right who who are we to keep somebody away from from the work of God if if I know my brother uh as well as I think I do he'd say come come I don't care what you had in your life I don't care if you just robbed a bank just confess it and give the money back right you see what I'm saying so I might have said this here before I can't remember but if there was if there was a sinner that just walked through the door and said hey I hear you're having church here tonight who would be the and everybody else who hears as is is baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and and uh you know you're just there and you're full of God who do you think would be the most important person in that room I would say the sinner right because we already know where we're going we have that blessed hope we have that assurance that person doesn't have that same hope so that's where we should turn our attention to right is to show love show forth the gospel amen I'm going to close here or start closing sometimes closing is a process right [Laughter] some people he's closing okay ready to go is he done yet other people what I miss brother Jose I remember when David preached here the one time he said well that's all I have what that's it but I'm still hungry I will never forget that that was so funny but you know that is so true the bride the bride of Christ will always hunger for the word of God Amen so I just love that I just love that amen that showed me where where brother Jose's desire was he wanted more of God but you know a a born-again Believer will not worship anything other than God right so in Hebrews 13 and 9. so if we won't worship any other God we will we will hold true to right Doctrine correct because going off on different Doctrine tends to lead you to adultery it'll lead you to something else other than God it says be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with knowledge not with revelation not with I'm the best prayer here amongst us well you're probably the most prideful amongst us too so what kind of award would you like uh say it's not a competition amongst Believers right but the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein see it it might seem like a good idea it might give you the wow factor at that moment but if you go back and look at the thing just like the movements if you go back and look at the thing research it a little bit and find out the motive and the objective of it it'll show what it is I see I don't I can't remember if I said this here before or not so forgive me if I did uh if you like it you like it if if not I guess you'll just have to deal with it uh the image that that King Nebuchadnezzar uh had set up was not of King Nebuchadnezzar now I'm kind of reaching out on this one I don't know what brother Jesse's taught on this one but I'm just this is this is the way I see it okay so bear with me for a minute if if I'm wrong I'll accept correction but just bear with me okay so the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up was not of King Nebuchadnezzar as some would lead you to believe uh out in the world that they want to say that oh that image was of King Nebuchadnezzar no it was not of King Nebuchadnezzar it was of Daniel what do you mean it was of Daniel give me a second see you in uh in Daniel you have belshazzar and you have baltus shazar it's a two little two-letter difference between the two names one belshazzar I I don't know the pronunciation so uh forgive me belshazzar was the son of King Nebuchadnezzar and Belta shazar was another name for Daniel so and Shadrach and meshech Shadrach Meshach and Abednego would not worship Daniel now see I'll get into that I don't want to get ahead of myself they wouldn't worship Daniel why because Daniel was their brother right the same as we should not worship brother Branham for he is our brother see if the devil cannot deceive you then he will push you overboard with truth see Nebuchadnezzar's son was two letters off from what he called Daniel he called Daniel Belta shazar hang on a second let's turn to it let's turn to Daniel there's there's a couple uh because if I say something that going out that far I want to have backup for it uh we'll read Daniel 1 and 7. we're not brother Brandon talked about this about how the image was Daniel I thought to myself okay brother Branham is a word Prophet if he's going to say something outlandish like that that is not a blatant statement in the Bible where did he get it from it has to be in there somewhere and I must have read the book of Daniel four or five times over and over talk about getting you to read the word so and I I got to pray and I said Lord I know it's got to be in here somewhere if you would just show it to me so these are the different areas so bear with me and I'll show you Daniel 1 and 7. unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belta shazar into hananiah Shadrach and to Michelle I don't know how you said Michelle it's kind of like Michael of Meshach and Azariah of Abednego now see these names that were given all right now say I'm getting ahead of myself I guess I might as well just say it so I can spit it out these names that were given unto Daniel and the the other Brethren there the names that they were given were the names of Babylonian deity do you think that they welcomed these names I don't think so at all but that's what they were given and that's what they had to live with so knowing that let's go to uh Daniel 4 8. Daniel 4 8 it says but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was beltashazar according to the name of my God is right there but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was beltashazar according to the name of my God and in whom is the spirit of the Holy gods and before him I told the dream saying oh Bel to shazar Master Of The Magicians because I know that the spirit of the Holy Gods is in thee and no secret trouble at thee tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation thereof see Nebuchadnezzar thought so highly of Daniel because of what Daniel could do but he didn't recognize the rightful place that Daniel had and the rightful place that God had so he and and as a uh what's the word that I'm looking for as a heathen he didn't know any better because he was a worshiper of other gods so he didn't recognize the one in the true God he didn't recognize the highest deity but he had the utmost respect for Daniel and I believe that's why he rose up the image of Daniel that's why he made the image of Daniel but see uh Belta shazar it means the lord of the straightens treasure and what is Lord the one that's in control right foreign Nebuchadnezzar's son it means Bell protect the king Belle is a chief Babylonian deity now see even though Nebuchadnezzar named Daniel after uh the the name of a Babylonian deity and and his Brethren along with him Babylon Babylonian deities see where they hold their place is that Nebuchadnezzar had raised up Daniel he lifted him up so much that he wanted other people to worship Him but Shadrach Meshach and Abednego would absolutely not do it and neither should we amen see he worshiped Daniel so he would deceive the very elect if possible see it's not always in the works of what a person could do that we worship the person that does the works it's not the works it's the it's the the person behind that works it's the it's the the being that that cut that made those Works come to pass amen amen now see you ever notice how people get upset when you don't worship what they what they want you to to worship see Nebuchadnezzar and his people were were killing people because they would not worship the image that he had raised up and he even threatened Shadrach mesack in a bed to go he threatened them with the furnace uh because they would not worship uh the image he said well we're going to put you in the furnace we're going to make it seven times hotter to the point where even the guards lost their lives taking these men to the furnace Why didn't it take their lives because we know that there was a higher power amongst them that because they honored God he also honored them and they were a witness against the people in that day amen now see in the New Testament the silversmiths got upset because the disciples were drawing people away from the idols right the silversmiths were mad because people weren't worshiping the Goddess Diana anymore I'll see I kind of attribute that to the the age of pornography that we live in right now if if if if the the righteous people were to stand up and cry out against pornography if they weren't involved with it uh if if they stood up and cried out against the the pornography industry they would be upset because you're taking money away from them see that's a whole thing right there that's a whole Drive behind that because it's a lucrative business it's a very lucrative business and if you start trying to take money away from it yeah they're going to get upset and they're going to want to try to take you out that's just the way it is people in all through history they try to Snuff out the truth and the messengers of Truth they've done it all through history starting with Cain and Abel and it's not finished yet see they were losing money so they got upset it probably would have tried to kill Paul and his companions and if and you had the same thing today they want to come against Christians because Christians stand against these wicked things so they want to they want to silence the Christians amen I'm gonna go ahead and close if you want to stay to your feet brother amen if you would come brother Fang you can come too [Laughter] but there is no God like our God right there is none like him even though people Through the Ages have tried to raise up images and to raise them or try to proclaim a deity as equal with him there is none equal with him so and this is one of my favorites I've been on this kick for a little bit I don't know why but this was uh I really like this story because it just shows the authority of God Amen first Samuel chapter 5 and verse 1 it says and the Philistines took the the Ark of God and brought it from uh brought it from Ebenezer onto ashdod when the Philistines took the Ark of God they brought it into the house of Dagon and said it by Dagon and when they have asked Dr Rose early on the morrow behold Dagon was Fallen upon his face to the Earth before the Ark of the Lord and they took Dagon and said in his place again see light can't have fellowship with Darkness righteousness can't have fellowship with unrighteousness and when they arose early on tomorrow morning behold Dagon was Fallen upon his face to the ground before the Ark of the Lord and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of Dagon was left to him so who is the higher power many people have tried to challenge God and his servants and many people have died trying amen that's our god let's look to the Lord in prayer most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just want to give you honor we want to give you praise because of who you are and that there is none like you and you are above all you were God above all gods You Were King above all Kings you were Lord above all Lords so Lord we come to you in respect unto your word unto respect of who you are and we want to give you honor and we want to give you the new

put their opinions aside and come to the Everlasting Truth for you are the truth the life and the way and may we come that precious way that one and true way that you have made for us oh God so father we just pray that you would be with each person tonight as we leave here tonight we pray that you would Grant safety unto each one to uh arrive at their home safely one more time oh God but father if you should decide that uh you should take us from this Earth the more blessed are we o father but Lord may we just leave a legacy if we are to leave this world maybe we leave a legacy behind me behind us that people would say that he lived true to his God lord may we have that witness may we have that testimony that he lived truth that he the whatever he spoke he lived may people see that and may they be convicted so much in their hearts maybe our lives be so salty that we would make others thirst around us oh God that we would be that that thirsting that Oasis that they could come and drink from oh God that we could share your word with them to show them that there is a real that there is a true way that there is a real God in this day and he is there for salvation that he is there to

there is a way to your problem there is a way to overcome and he is the life the truth and the way so Lord we just no matter what what what little tests or trials or Temptations might come through us
