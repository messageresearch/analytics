[1:21] well some us have work tomorrow right
[1:24] sorry about that I guess I'll watch the
[1:25] time sorry sorry I didn't think about
[1:27] that just thinking about my own self I
[1:29] shouldn't do that so Romans 7:4 and
[1:37] 5 it was a wonderful message I went back
[1:39] and listened to it uh today just to hear
[1:42] the message and so blessed by the songs
[1:44] and the worship and just what God spoke
[1:46] brother Austin sent me a text and said
[1:48] some of the things that were preach were
[1:49] I was saying like where is this coming
[1:51] from he's like that's just what he
[1:52] needed to hear so I said praise the Lord
[1:54] and there's one testimony to share at
[1:55] the end is very important uh to me kind
[1:59] of dealt with Sunday as well um so we
[2:02] I'll share that at the End by God's
[2:04] grace Romans 7 ver4 and
[2:07] 5 so I'm just starting off with you know
[2:09] looking at these two verses and we're
[2:11] going to just focus on the fruit because
[2:14] the Bible said you must be married to
[2:16] Christ and then you produce the fruit of
[2:17] the Holy Spirit I just want to start
[2:19] with that thought before you're married
[2:21] to before we are married to Christ we
[2:23] had fruit unto death you know the sin
[2:26] just produced death in our lives nothing
[2:29] nothing good right but once you come to
[2:31] Christ once you become married to Christ
[2:32] and you get his name when you're
[2:34] baptized then you produce the fruits of
[2:36] the Holy Spirit praise God Amen
[2:38] Hallelujah there's fruits when you're to
[2:40] be justified there's fruits the
[2:41] sanctification and then there's fruits
[2:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[2:44] preached on that because John said bring
[2:46] forth fruits unto repentance Hallelujah
[2:50] Romans 7 uh 4 and 5 I'll read verse four
[2:54] and then we can read verse 5 together
[2:56] verse four says wherefore my brethren ye
[2:58] also are become dead to the law by the
[3:00] body of Christ that you should be
[3:01] married to another even to him who is
[3:02] raised from the dead that we should
[3:04] bring forth fruit unto God let's read
[3:06] verse 5 on three 1 2 3 for when we were
[3:10] in the flesh the Motions of sins which
[3:14] were by the law did work in our members
[3:17] to bring forth fruit unto death may God
[3:21] add as a blessing to the Ring of his
[3:22] word you may be seated by God's
[3:27] grace all right so we'll try to take
[3:29] about an hour here I'll try to watch the
[3:31] time here by God's I'm Sorry by God's
[3:33] grace no school tomorrow right we just
[3:35] got work tomorrow right no school when
[3:38] did you go back girls when you go back
[3:39] to school December 3rd or January 3rd
[3:42] right okay the Wednesday that's okay
[3:43] that's all right January 3rd I go back
[3:45] the 4th that's right because you got one
[3:47] day before me I get one day after you so
[3:51] so we we see when we're married to
[3:53] Christ it produces fruit in our lives
[3:55] praise God so I want to read that out of
[3:57] Galatians 5 you have your Bible uh let's
[3:59] go to Galatians 5:18 I like how Paul the
[4:02] same one that wrote this right the same
[4:03] one that wrote Romans 7 wrote here
[4:06] Galatians and let's just review some of
[4:08] these fruits here of Our
[4:10] Lives thank God that the uh old married
[4:14] spouse is dead and the church said amen
[4:17] that law the legalism the curse we are
[4:19] dead to that spouse and we are married
[4:22] to Christ hallelujah amen praise the
[4:24] Lord do we do we still battle sin of
[4:26] course is sin still in our members yes
[4:28] of course Hallelujah but God doesn't
[4:31] hold that against us right that's that's
[4:33] the that's the battle that we must face
[4:35] that's the greatest battle ever fought
[4:36] praise God God gives us uh something to
[4:38] do with the faith that we receive praise
[4:40] God we learn to be an overcomer we learn
[4:43] to overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[4:45] the word of Our Testimony praise God
[4:46] amen amen and he he lets us uh fight the
[4:49] good fight of Faith Hallelujah and when
[4:51] we can't fight anymore he fights for us
[4:54] amen amen we feel like giving up praise
[4:56] God he sends in reinforcements
[4:58] Hallelujah feel like All Is Lost we feel
[5:01] like there's no hope Jesus gives us a
[5:03] reason to Hope praise God he is our
[5:05] Living Hope amen amen Galatians 5:18
[5:08] beautifully lays out this uh thought
[5:11] here actually I'll read 17 because the
[5:13] the flesh lust against the spirit and
[5:16] the spirit against the Flesh and these
[5:17] are contrary one to another so that you
[5:19] cannot do the things that you would
[5:21] that's one good thing to keep in mind
[5:23] the Holy Ghost was always opposite of
[5:25] the flesh the flesh wants to glorify it
[5:29] self and the the you know the three
[5:32] Avenues of sin lust of the eyes lust of
[5:34] the flesh pride of life but the holy
[5:36] spirit is opposite of that praise God
[5:38] they're contrary they're always fighting
[5:39] one against another right Hallelujah we
[5:42] want to live in a spot where we can
[5:43] easily uh surrender to the leading of
[5:46] the Holy Spirit rather than easily
[5:47] surrendering to the flesh right we want
[5:50] to live so close to God that that we can
[5:52] easily be led by the Holy Spirit now
[5:56] verse uh 18 for but if ye be led by the
[5:59] spirit you're not under the law now the
[6:02] works of the flesh are manifest which
[6:03] are adultery fornication uncleanness
[6:07] theous which is lawlessness oh I'm saved
[6:10] by grace I can live however I want no
[6:12] you can't that's that's called lashious
[6:14] idolatry which is a lot in our day in
[6:16] our group it's Idol idolizing brother
[6:19] brandom in tapes right uh witchcraft
[6:22] which remember uh Rebellion is the same
[6:25] as witchcraft yes remember I told you
[6:27] that Pastor in Florida uh uh got visited
[6:31] by evil spirits for two weeks in a row
[6:33] and he found out later it was witches in
[6:35] the church that were telling him not to
[6:37] preach and just press play that was
[6:39] witchcraft in a a Florida Church a
[6:41] message church so we can't we can't
[6:44] think of like witchcraft is something
[6:45] off there you know uh it's witches
[6:47] around a a pot or a cauldron of steam
[6:49] and stuff like that it's people that can
[6:51] come to church yes and say press play
[6:55] that's right but they can also say
[6:56] preach right you know they can say
[6:58] anything
[6:59] but that the way we test all things is
[7:01] give them the word test praise God
[7:04] Amen take take them to the word of God
[7:07] what does the word say praise God Amen
[7:09] and the word will manifest every time is
[7:11] it the spirit of God or the spirit of
[7:13] the Antichrist yes so see that's you
[7:16] know Satan's a he's a brother said he's
[7:18] a genius at his job it's too easy to
[7:21] detect a witch if you know if she looks
[7:22] like a witch with makeup on and a
[7:24] crooked nose and a black hat it's too
[7:26] easy right so he's got to be more
[7:28] deceptive all the time so let's make
[7:31] sure by God's grace we're walking
[7:33] according to the spirit and not the
[7:36] flesh amen like you can see now and I'm
[7:38] just going to get on this for just a
[7:39] moment just one more moment you can see
[7:41] the move the the move behind this tape
[7:42] church is you don't have to go to church
[7:44] just send us your money that's where
[7:46] they're at right now they haven't gone
[7:47] to church for years now it's been two or
[7:48] three years they haven't even gathered
[7:50] together for
[7:51] church that that's the effect of it and
[7:53] the Bible says gather more as you see
[7:55] that day approaches right and it's and
[7:58] it's gone completely opposite but but to
[8:00] them they're so blind they can't even
[8:01] see the Hebrews 10: 24 and 25 gather
[8:04] more and they can't even hear brother
[8:06] say it on the tapes the man said don't
[8:08] stay at home go to church he said if the
[8:11] spirit of God is in you it can't wait
[8:12] till those doors open up amen and some
[8:14] of you got your own key you can open up
[8:16] the door yourself hallelujah amen you
[8:18] ought to be thankful praise God that you
[8:21] can open the door of the church yourself
[8:23] Hallelujah if you don't if you don't got
[8:24] a key let me know I don't know if
[8:25] anybody's got a key but let me know if
[8:26] you need a key by God's grace we'll try
[8:28] to get you key
[8:30] Hallelujah now uh hatred variance
[8:33] emulations wrath Strife seditions
[8:36] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[8:40] reings now revelings are the late night
[8:41] parties I read that quote on Sunday but
[8:43] that's what brother was talking about
[8:44] reings late night
[8:47] parties and such of like of which I tell
[8:50] you before as I have told you in time
[8:52] past that they which do such things
[8:54] shall not inherit the kingdom of God
[8:55] that's why I told my barber today you
[8:57] know I don't go to late night New Year's
[8:59] Eve parties I said I'm in bed the same
[9:01] time hopefully
[9:03] earlier because late night parties is
[9:07] it's a it's a Temptation for sin it's
[9:10] always an open door for Satan right I
[9:13] think Zer and I were texting about that
[9:14] right you were texting about that when I
[9:16] was growing up you know we had uh family
[9:18] Christmas parties and family New Year's
[9:20] Eve parties and we'd be up till midnight
[9:21] we watch the ball drop and my my my dad
[9:24] and my my uncles and I we'd be playing
[9:26] cards we'd be gambling basically poker
[9:29] smoking and cussing and it was just a it
[9:31] was just all sin nothing ever good comes
[9:34] out of those things and the Bible tells
[9:36] that's a work of the flesh the Bible
[9:38] tells us that praise God the Bible said
[9:40] avoid all appearance of evil praise God
[9:43] Amen so it's a good lesson a good
[9:45] reminder for
[9:47] us the Bible said uh of though of which
[9:49] I tell you before fishing verse 21 as
[9:52] I've told you in times pass that they
[9:54] which do such things shall not inherit
[9:55] the kingdom of
[9:57] God now of course they can repent of
[9:59] these things and be saved like the thief
[10:00] on the cross he was a thief and he was
[10:03] forgiven right at the last moment the
[10:05] Bible don't even record him saying
[10:07] forgive me the Bible just says he said
[10:09] Remember Me amen hallelujah the Bible
[10:12] don't record where he says I Repent of
[10:13] my sins you're my lamb you know he don't
[10:16] say that he just says remember me and
[10:18] Jesus said today you'll be with me in
[10:20] Paradise that must mean Jesus knows your
[10:22] heart if you don't got the right word
[10:24] Jesus knows your heart praise God Amen
[10:27] Hallelujah see Church don't feel bad if
[10:29] you pray you don't got the right word
[10:30] just say God you know my heart and Jesus
[10:33] knows what's in your heart praise God
[10:35] Amen now here if you're married to
[10:37] Christ verse 22 but the fruit of the
[10:39] spirit is love you just love God's
[10:41] people you love your enemies you love
[10:44] the
[10:45] word amen that's the fruit that's how
[10:48] you know you're married to Christ you
[10:49] love the word like brother R said how
[10:51] can how can a church say they're married
[10:52] to Christ when they cut their hair wear
[10:54] pants and bobbed hair and makeup and
[10:56] speaking in tongues of the evidence and
[10:58] all these that it's not married to
[11:00] Christ they're married to a
[11:01] Creed and God will give them Grace if
[11:04] they'll repent right but their their
[11:06] their fruits show that they're not
[11:08] married to the truth of the word yes and
[11:11] I gave you a list of 100 things I didn't
[11:12] go through it maybe one of these
[11:13] Services I'll go actually slowly through
[11:15] the list so you can see it I didn't
[11:17] actually get to study on that one either
[11:18] more I like to get on 200 of those first
[11:20] but love joy peace longsuffering I think
[11:24] a joy you know the Bible said rejoice in
[11:26] the lord always and again I say rejoice
[11:28] amen amen and I was reading this week in
[11:30] Leviticus 23 I think it's Deuteronomy 16
[11:33] where talked about the Feast of Weeks
[11:35] and one of the brothers brother John was
[11:36] talking to me about that on Sunday
[11:37] there's seven Israel feasts remember
[11:40] there's the Passover that's Christ types
[11:42] Christ death there's unleavened bread
[11:44] that types Christ going down uh to hell
[11:46] to get the keys uh there there's the U
[11:48] the the Feast of first fruits that's the
[11:50] Resurrection the fourth one for is
[11:52] Deliverance amen four there's four uh
[11:55] there's four beasts the fourth one is
[11:57] the Feast of Weeks which is us it's two
[12:00] wave loaves that were waved before the
[12:02] people and they had leaven in them it
[12:05] was two it was two uh loav of bread it
[12:09] was the Jew and Gentile church amen
[12:11] hallelujah and the Bible said when in
[12:14] that Feast you harvest you harvest all
[12:16] the seeds that's why we're still
[12:17] preaching trying to harvest souls and
[12:19] the Bible said rejoice in that Feast
[12:22] amen hallelujah praise God what am I
[12:24] saying this is the season to Rejoice
[12:26] amen rejoice in Christ h am and then he
[12:30] says Rejoice always and again I say
[12:32] rejoice same man who is whipped five
[12:34] times the same man who is Shipwrecked
[12:35] three times the same man says Rejoice
[12:38] always and again I say rejoice find
[12:40] something to be happy about praise God
[12:42] Amen we got a lot of a lot of choices to
[12:44] find out what we should be happy with
[12:47] amen hallelujah thank God verse 23 well
[12:51] actually I never finished 22 joy peace
[12:53] longsuffering goodness I'm sorry
[12:55] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[12:58] Temperance against such there is no law
[13:01] and they that are Christ have crucified
[13:03] the flesh with the affections and lust
[13:06] and notice it's not a one-time thing
[13:08] it's a daily thing right amen I was
[13:10] talking to brother Brooks and we were
[13:11] kind of talking about this and he was
[13:12] saying you know he said I used to think
[13:14] that these things would be gone forever
[13:16] the the you know the the past sins but
[13:18] those spirits come back the Bible said
[13:20] don't come back right right like we
[13:23] would have thought oh I'll never be
[13:24] tempted by that again or you know we
[13:26] better be careful what we
[13:27] say right you got to understand that the
[13:29] demons are going to come back and
[13:31] they're going to try to come in with a
[13:32] little more strength right a little more
[13:34] persuasion but we got to be ready to
[13:36] cast them down praise God cast out any
[13:38] imagination that exalts itself against
[13:40] the knowledge of God
[13:43] Amen I like hearing you know veteran
[13:45] Saints like that like hear Brother
[13:46] Brooks's testimony like that stirs me up
[13:48] amen I want to be I want to be faithful
[13:50] praise God I want to be ready I want to
[13:52] be
[13:53] aware verse 25 if ye live in the spirit
[13:56] let us also walk in the spirit let us
[13:58] let us not be desirous of vain Glory
[14:00] provoking one another envying one
[14:02] another let's let's try not to provoke
[14:04] one another let's try not to Envy one
[14:06] another let's be happy for everybody
[14:07] praise God Amen now back back to Romans
[14:10] 7 here now the Bible said uh it's the
[14:14] Motions of sin in
[14:17] verse uh let's see verse five for when
[14:20] we were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[14:22] motions means the inward State or the
[14:24] Affliction of sins which were by the law
[14:27] did work in our members to bring forth
[14:29] fruit unto death so when you were a
[14:30] sinner you were in the inward state of
[14:33] sin it was just constant sin now I'm
[14:35] sure some of you might remember that I'm
[14:37] not asking you to raise your hand but
[14:38] you might remember when you were
[14:40] constantly sinning all the time right
[14:43] there was times like the Bible said in
[14:44] Genesis 6 I can relate to that every
[14:47] thought of the imagination of the heart
[14:49] was evil continually I remember that
[14:51] right now it seems like a long time ago
[14:52] so thank God for that but that that's
[14:54] the condition the world got in and Paul
[14:57] says that's the condition we were in we
[14:59] were in an inward state of the motion of
[15:02] sin Hallelujah
[15:04] right I like verse six but now amen
[15:07] those are two beautiful words amen I
[15:09] used to be in that inward sayate but now
[15:13] I'm delivered from the law praise God
[15:16] Amen that being dead wherein we were
[15:18] held that we should serve in the newness
[15:20] of spirit and not the oldness of the
[15:22] letter praise God Amen we are delivered
[15:25] from the curse of the law right as we
[15:28] want over on Sunday if you break one of
[15:30] them you're guilty of all of them but
[15:32] now we serve in the newness of the
[15:34] spirit and remember Church in context
[15:36] this is like this is like
[15:38] honeymoon this is you're serving Jesus
[15:41] like it's the honeymoon because it's a
[15:42] marriage you were you your old spouse
[15:45] died now know those of us who are
[15:48] married we know it's like to be on the
[15:50] honeymoon if you had one hopefully you
[15:52] had one by God's grace if you didn't I'm
[15:55] very sorry pray maybe I can help you out
[15:58] with that
[15:59] if you need some financial help I did
[16:02] that a couple times I've helped a couple
[16:03] people get some honeymoon times they
[16:05] need it by God's grace but anyways you
[16:07] know this is the context you're now
[16:09] married to Christ so serve your new
[16:12] spouse with the newness of spirit amen
[16:15] amen in other words your first love
[16:18] hallelujah amen serve Jesus with
[16:21] gladness of heart I just read that this
[16:22] week in Deuteronomy
[16:24] 28 God told Israel because you did not
[16:27] serve me with joy fness of gladness of
[16:29] heart therefore you shall serve your
[16:31] enemies what a rebuke but also what a
[16:35] blessing to us if we serve god with
[16:37] joyfulness and gladness we will overcome
[16:40] our enemies amen amen that's why
[16:42] Christians find it hard the message or
[16:44] any other the church they find it hard
[16:46] if they're not serving God with
[16:47] joyfulness and gladness they become
[16:49] Servants of
[16:51] sin and then brother Ram tells us uh
[16:54] that that he tells that then
[16:55] Christianity it's hard to be a Christian
[16:57] then
[16:59] right brother R tell us that I forget
[17:00] the exact words but brother R say uh you
[17:04] know PR people that had no Victory they
[17:06] have no Victory because they didn't
[17:08] serve god with joyfulness and
[17:11] gladness all the joy was taken out of
[17:14] Christianity right all the victory was
[17:16] taken out all the blessings somehow
[17:19] Satan deceived them and and tempted them
[17:21] into forgetting all the good things of
[17:23] God oh my my goodness but Paul says let
[17:27] it be a honey brother no wonder brother
[17:29] say let your marriage always be a
[17:32] honeymoon amen and all the amen or I'm
[17:34] sorry all the married people said Amen
[17:36] to that one Hallelujah not the oldness
[17:38] of the letter now this is a statement
[17:41] many people understand the letter kth
[17:45] but the spirit giveth life amen I
[17:47] noticed a lot of message preachers they
[17:49] condemn any Message Bible teacher
[17:52] because they're not like them they're
[17:55] not loud enough like maybe a Bible
[17:56] teacher isn't loud enough or not not
[17:58] speaking fast enough or getting the
[18:01] people excited enough remember brother
[18:03] Brian says that turns him off when
[18:04] people when preachers come in and they
[18:06] just got to have a loud service if they
[18:07] don't have a loud service then they're
[18:09] not uh having
[18:11] Church you can't judge every service by
[18:13] the noise right amen right God might be
[18:17] speaking in a still Small Voice God
[18:18] might be rebuking well nobody says amen
[18:20] when they're being
[18:22] rebuked when was the last time you
[18:24] shouted amen and dance around here when
[18:25] you got rebuked by something you don't
[18:27] do that when you're getting rebuked but
[18:29] the Bible Jesus said if I love you I'll
[18:31] rebuke
[18:32] you amen
[18:35] amen right so so this thought came to me
[18:39] as I was studying they these preachers
[18:41] use the letter kill it but they misuse
[18:43] it and it's misused out of context of
[18:46] course we condemn any false teacher
[18:50] who's teaching heresies whether they're
[18:52] loud or
[18:54] quiet but there's just as many loud
[18:57] preachers preaching heresies as there
[18:59] are quiet teachers right preaching
[19:02] heresies there's just as many I could
[19:04] take you on YouTube and show you just as
[19:07] just as many right so get your Bible go
[19:10] to 2 Corinthians
[19:11] 3:6 now let's look at the context of
[19:13] this because Paul mentions it here we
[19:15] should serve in the newness of spirit
[19:17] and not the letter again remember he's
[19:19] giving the contrast between the New
[19:20] Testament and the Old Testament that's
[19:23] the context the context isn't loud
[19:26] preachers against quiet preachers
[19:29] that's why church sometimes some of my
[19:31] favorite services are Wednesday nights
[19:33] when it's more quiet or Sunday nights
[19:36] when people are asking really good
[19:37] questions and I feel the presence of God
[19:39] moving in other words it don't have to
[19:41] be a loud service every time I thank God
[19:42] for the loud we had a nice loud service
[19:43] on Sunday that Sunday morning that was
[19:45] really good there's a lot of clapping a
[19:47] lot of rejoicing and thank God for that
[19:50] amen but have you noticed sometimes too
[19:52] God's in the quiet many times too amen
[19:55] why because the Bible says you're
[19:57] searching your soul
[19:59] the Bible said you take the can of the
[20:00] Lord and God escorts you remember down
[20:02] past your flesh remember that preach on
[20:04] that down and past your mind and then
[20:06] now he goes deep out down into your soul
[20:09] he takes the candle of the spirit right
[20:11] the candle and you go searching the
[20:13] Bible says Search Your Heart search your
[20:14] spirit search your soul right right
[20:17] search me oh God see if there be any
[20:18] wicked way in me the Bible says amen
[20:20] sometimes there's those deep searching
[20:21] Services praise God hallelujah Second
[20:24] Corinthians 3:6 who also has made us
[20:27] able ministers of the New Testament not
[20:29] of the letter but of the spirit for the
[20:31] letter kth but the spirit giveth life so
[20:34] pre Preachers will say well he's not
[20:35] loud enough he's doing too much teaching
[20:37] he's standing still too much see he's of
[20:39] the letter that's not what he's talking
[20:41] about right the Bible said Jesus sat
[20:43] daily in the temple teaching the people
[20:45] just sat he wasn't walking around all
[20:48] the time or running around like
[20:49] preachers he wasn't jumping around like
[20:50] I do sometimes you know he sat in the
[20:53] temple daily teaching the people the
[20:56] word of God right
[21:00] amen so let's get the context verse 7
[21:03] but if the ministration of death written
[21:05] engraved in Stones oh now we're getting
[21:06] to the context was glorious so that the
[21:09] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[21:11] behold the face of Moses for the glory
[21:12] of his countenance which Glory was be
[21:15] done away hath not I'm sorry how shall
[21:17] not the ministration of the spirit be
[21:19] rather glorious so the letter is the
[21:23] law Hallelujah the letter is The Ten
[21:26] Commandments and of course all the other
[21:29] 600 or 500 or sorry 6003 sorry 6003
[21:33] Commandments now look at verse 9 for the
[21:36] administration of condemnation so now
[21:38] the Old Testament is called condemnation
[21:41] there was only condemnation in there
[21:42] right the Messiah hadn't come yet you
[21:45] never could sacrifice enough Bullocks or
[21:47] goats right you you just never could do
[21:50] it much more do the ministration of
[21:53] righteousness exceed in
[21:55] glory so the letter is not new Testament
[21:58] teachers the letter is the Old Testament
[22:01] law it's the spouse who died and the
[22:03] church said amen it's that legalism it's
[22:06] that curse of the law that's what the
[22:09] that's what the letter that kills is it
[22:11] just said it right there it's the
[22:12] ministration of
[22:14] condemnation like Moses found out as
[22:16] soon as God gives me Ten Commandments
[22:18] before he can deliver them to the people
[22:20] they've already broken them amen that's
[22:22] the law praise God right that that
[22:25] that's when you know uh you're under the
[22:27] law that's when you know you're guilty
[22:29] right before you even know about it
[22:31] you've already broken it praise God
[22:34] now brother R says this about teaching
[22:37] he said I remember staying a year and
[22:38] six months in the Book of Revelation in
[22:41] the Tabernacle here that's what I like
[22:43] in teaching I just love teaching oh my I
[22:47] think it's wonderful it gives the basis
[22:49] and settles the church
[22:52] Hallelujah now look brother said there's
[22:54] a great vast difference between a
[22:55] teacher and a preacher see it's two
[22:58] different gifts of the Spirit Al
[23:00] together two different gifts and I
[23:01] humbly say this but I haven't got a gift
[23:04] of either brother Bram says now if those
[23:06] people believe every word is th sayth
[23:08] the Lord then brother Ram didn't teach
[23:11] anything because he says he doesn't have
[23:12] a gift to do it and he didn't preach
[23:13] anything because he said he's not a
[23:15] Preacher Brother Ram said mine of course
[23:17] is praying for the sick that's what the
[23:20] Lord called me to do but how many know
[23:23] brother Ram was a real preacher how many
[23:26] know brother really could teach the word
[23:27] of God you haven't you better go listen
[23:30] to the seals in the church ages again
[23:32] and Hebrew series listen to those again
[23:34] M but see he's being humble and even
[23:37] says this I humbly say this I haven't
[23:39] got the gift of be them so notice
[23:41] brother says I love teaching Jesus said
[23:43] in Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore and
[23:45] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[23:48] one name of the father Son and Holy
[23:49] Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ verse 20
[23:51] teaching them to observe all things
[23:53] whatsoever I have commanded you
[23:56] Hallelujah
[23:58] brother bram's talking about deacons in
[24:00] 1963 and and they the deacons asked
[24:02] brother Bram what if the people won't
[24:04] listen to the deacons and look what
[24:05] brother Bram
[24:06] says says people often get mad mad at us
[24:09] when we try to correct them he says they
[24:11] do at me too they'll do it at any man
[24:14] see a person that does that there's
[24:16] something wrong with that
[24:17] person Hallelujah they're not right with
[24:21] God for the spirit of Christ is subject
[24:24] to Christ teaching Christ's house Christ
[24:27] order
[24:29] if you've got the spirit of Christ you
[24:31] obey what the what the rules are at the
[24:34] church Hallelujah if you got the spirit
[24:37] of Christ you obey Christ teaching yes
[24:40] his house his order amen amen Jesus said
[24:43] go and teach the word of God hallelujah
[24:46] I just thought I'd take a few minutes
[24:47] out of here and preach that to you so
[24:48] you could
[24:49] understand
[24:52] Hallelujah brother B says this uh I'm
[24:56] going to skip that quote uh put up 1
[24:58] John 2:27 hun you're doing good tonight
[25:00] here I appreciate dedication you do good
[25:02] every service 1 John
[25:06] 2:27 I preached on this I think I
[25:07] preached on this recently but the
[25:09] anointing which you have received of him
[25:10] abideth in you and you need not let any
[25:12] man teach you now these people that are
[25:14] tape worshippers uh they'll they'll use
[25:16] this other people that don't believe in
[25:17] Preachers they'll use this and say
[25:19] they'll say well I've got the anointing
[25:20] I don't need anybody to teach me but as
[25:23] the same anointing teach you all things
[25:25] and is truth and is no lie and even as
[25:28] it has taught you ye shall abide in him
[25:31] now I'm not going to go there but
[25:32] earlier in this chapter John is saying
[25:35] there's false teachers and he's telling
[25:36] them when these false teachers come to
[25:38] you you don't need anybody to teach you
[25:40] because the anointing will teach you
[25:41] what to say in that hour amen that's the
[25:44] context now look what brother Ram says
[25:47] here I like I like what brother Ram says
[25:48] about
[25:49] this he said oh there's many that rise
[25:51] up and say oh I don't need to go to
[25:53] church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost
[25:54] has come he's the teacher but Ram says
[25:57] when you get get that idea you're just
[25:59] wrong so I'll remember that next time
[26:01] somebody tells me I don't have to go to
[26:03] church I don't need a preacher to teach
[26:05] me I'll say you're just
[26:06] wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set
[26:09] teachers in the church if he was going
[26:11] to be the teacher don't you like that
[26:14] why would one scripture contradict the
[26:16] other the route is none of them
[26:18] contradict each other that's right see
[26:21] there are first apostles prophets
[26:23] teachers evangelist pastors the Holy
[26:25] Spirit set teachers in the church so he
[26:27] could teach through that teacher and if
[26:29] it isn't according to the word God
[26:31] doesn't confirm it and then if it isn't
[26:32] the right kind of teaching it must
[26:34] compare with the entire Bible and be
[26:36] just as alive today as it was then
[26:39] there's the real thing made manifest
[26:41] amen that's what we're looking for
[26:43] church when I teach something I look for
[26:45] God to vindicate it amen or when I
[26:48] preach something I look for somebody to
[26:49] be blessed by that praise God Amen we
[26:52] got a good blessing on Sunday I'm going
[26:53] to share that testimony at the end here
[26:54] in a little
[26:56] bit and so that's what I look for and
[26:58] every time you know you know I I've I've
[27:00] had certain people you know email me and
[27:01] say brother Jesse when you put those
[27:02] videos out you're standing behind that
[27:04] Pulpit teaching the word of God they
[27:05] said I feel the presence of God I feel
[27:07] the Holy Spirit teaching I said praise
[27:09] God hallelujah that's what I want that's
[27:11] what brother man says that's what the
[27:13] gift should do right God should
[27:15] vindicate the gift praise God amen amen
[27:18] amen I'll tell you real just I'll tell
[27:19] you real plainly when I first started
[27:21] preaching it was really hard to get
[27:23] behind this sacred desk now now I'm used
[27:25] to it now I kind of I got a sacred
[27:26] respect for it I used to shake I us well
[27:28] not there but I used to Shake in my
[27:30] offices you know the different offices
[27:31] I've had I would Shake in trouble like
[27:33] what am I going to say I used to wonder
[27:35] can you imag a sister Naomi sister B I
[27:37] used to wonder how could I preach a half
[27:38] an hour I used to wonder that when I
[27:39] first start preaching and I preach two
[27:41] hours on Sunday and I stopped a short I
[27:43] could have kept preaching there's a good
[27:45] atmosphere in here I used to wonder like
[27:47] how I think my first sermon I preached
[27:49] was 15 minutes over at car sees
[27:51] apartment there on book booko
[27:53] Avenue right how how in the world what
[27:57] happen you just learn to yield to the
[27:59] Holy Spirit I might go from teaching a
[28:01] little bit then I'll bounce into some
[28:03] preaching amen hallelujah amen or might
[28:06] be trying to raise faith and just preach
[28:07] preach preach or might be trying to
[28:09] explain something and rightly divide the
[28:11] word of Truth praise God Amen because
[28:13] that's what Devils do Devils try to get
[28:15] people to doubt but the Holy Spirit
[28:17] comes in and teaches the truth praise
[28:19] God Amen that's what Satan's doing
[28:22] mainly now trying to get people to doubt
[28:24] the
[28:25] message and every time they get their
[28:28] eyes off the Bible Church keep your eyes
[28:30] on the Bible amen let me tell you that I
[28:33] always find that the holy spirit will
[28:34] take me back back to the Bible back to
[28:36] the Bible they want to get your eyes on
[28:37] William brandom and all these if if ifs
[28:39] and presumption presumption presumption
[28:41] just remember God sent brother brandom
[28:43] and he point us back to the word of God
[28:45] yes amen
[28:47] hallelujah so I love I love that quote
[28:49] brother BR says how why the Holy Spirit
[28:52] set teachers in the church if he was
[28:54] going to be the only teacher good point
[28:56] brother Brandon
[28:58] I love it Hallelujah now let's go back
[28:59] to Romans 7:8 I thought I'd take about
[29:02] yeah maybe half hour on that one 7 verse
[29:09] 8
[29:12] okay now this is a familiar text you
[29:15] know I've uh I I mention this often you
[29:18] know why church because I'm always
[29:19] preaching on being more Sanctified right
[29:21] amen a lot of my sermons come down to
[29:23] how can we be more pure before God Amen
[29:25] yes right cuz honestly once you got the
[29:27] Holy Ghost once it's confirmed in your
[29:28] heart you got the hly Holy Ghost then
[29:29] you say Lord what must I do now well the
[29:32] main thing to do is stay purified stay
[29:34] Sanctified so God can use your Holy
[29:36] Ghost amen right that's why we want God
[29:39] to use that Holy Ghost that's inside of
[29:40] me praise God amen
[29:46] amen now verse seven what shall we say
[29:49] then is the law sin God forbid now look
[29:51] at that the Bible just said the law was
[29:54] administration of death see because
[29:55] there was a part of curse in it right it
[29:57] was the curse was included there if you
[29:59] don't keep all of it you're guilty of it
[30:02] all but then he says is it sin though
[30:05] God forbid no nay I had not known sin
[30:09] but by the law for I had not known lust
[30:11] except the law said Thou shalt not covet
[30:13] but sin taking occasion by the
[30:15] Commandment wrought in me all manner of
[30:18] concusions I'm going to pull up my uh
[30:20] Greek Lexicon here and look up some of
[30:24] these
[30:26] words
[30:28] okay so bear with me here concusion says
[30:30] a desire or craving or longing for that
[30:33] which is
[30:34] forbidden
[30:37] okay for without the law sin was dead
[30:41] verse n for I was alive without the law
[30:44] once but when the Commandment came sin
[30:46] revived and I died verse 10 and the
[30:50] Commandment which was ordained to life I
[30:53] found it be unto
[30:55] death okay verse 11 for sin taking
[30:59] occasion by the Commandment deceive me
[31:01] and by it slew me now he's not talking
[31:03] naturally he's talking spiritually so
[31:06] the law was so hard to keep I felt like
[31:09] it killed me anybody ever feel like that
[31:10] before amen anybody ever try to set up
[31:13] your expectations for yourself well I'm
[31:16] going to do this this and that and when
[31:17] you don't do it you feel like it killed
[31:18] you you ever feel like
[31:20] that am I the only one you know we have
[31:23] we have such high which is good you want
[31:25] to have high goals right you want to I'm
[31:26] going to preach on that you want to set
[31:27] goals for 2024 I preach a little bit on
[31:30] it but you want to set goals but don't
[31:32] be discouraged if you don't reach some
[31:33] of them I mean I I went found goals I
[31:35] set like years ago and I finally got
[31:37] them done like three years later I I
[31:39] didn't get discouraged I mean I knew in
[31:41] the back of my mind I wanted to get that
[31:43] done but it's all in God's time and
[31:45] season praise God as long as I'm giving
[31:47] my best as long as I'm trying my best
[31:49] God will bless me hallelujah amen again
[31:53] we got to find like brother said lay out
[31:54] your thousand your texts your thousand
[31:57] th to-do items on your to-do list lay
[31:59] those out before the Lord and say holy
[32:01] spirit Lead Me amen and I'm going to
[32:04] watch in the next few days I'm going to
[32:05] watch the next few weeks and I'm going
[32:07] to see Lord which way you're moving me
[32:09] amen like I just had somebody you I
[32:10] thought about you know how was my year
[32:12] of 2023 I just had a guy
[32:14] overseas send me an email this week and
[32:17] he said brother I can't tell you how
[32:18] important that video series you did on
[32:20] the 24 Lies coming out of brandom
[32:22] Tabernacle he said cuz I'm surrounded by
[32:24] people think about that church we got a
[32:26] good
[32:28] we got we got a pretty healthy church
[32:30] amen some people don't have a healthy
[32:33] Church some people got preachers that
[32:35] sometimes preach and sometimes play
[32:36] tapes and then there's all these other
[32:38] tape worshippers around we're we're
[32:40] blessed by God's grace we're surrounded
[32:42] by some really good
[32:43] churches but this this man says I I I
[32:45] was I've always had this struggle here
[32:47] with with is is Bram Tabernacle off or
[32:50] not and then I stumble upon your channel
[32:53] and we know it's not a stumbling praise
[32:55] God it's God or ordering the footsteps
[32:58] amen amen hallelujah like that one guy
[33:01] told me he said uh for all these years
[33:03] I've been crying Lord raise up somebody
[33:05] to defend this message he's been praying
[33:07] that for years and then he found my
[33:08] channel why I've been doing it for many
[33:10] years yeah for 10 years I've been doing
[33:12] it for all those years God sent me
[33:14] somebody God already Raised Me Up amen
[33:16] hallelujah
[33:18] amen but it's it's this idea of uh doing
[33:22] God a service right being Sanctified
[33:24] being purified so God can use us now
[33:27] praise God amen amen now
[33:30] verse uh verse 12 wherefore the law is
[33:34] Holy and the Commandment holy and just
[33:35] and good I've been going through uh I've
[33:38] been going transferring all my notes
[33:39] from one Bible to my new Bible I've gone
[33:41] through Genesis through Joshua and this
[33:43] last few days it's been awesome I see
[33:45] all these types all these Shadows all
[33:47] these Revelations but it's reminding me
[33:49] there's so much Holiness in the Old
[33:51] Testament there's so many Beautiful
[33:53] Stories in there that I forgotten about
[33:55] like oh there it is that's
[33:57] I forgot about that amen the Bible said
[34:00] the law was holy and good and righteous
[34:03] amen amen but when it came down to me
[34:06] obeying it it slew me it killed
[34:08] me
[34:10] right it told me all these things things
[34:12] I doing were were sins these were all
[34:15] sins right and it slew me verse 13 was
[34:18] then that which is good made death unto
[34:20] me God forbid God didn't intend for this
[34:23] to be uh death unto me but sin that it
[34:26] might appear sin working death in Me by
[34:29] that which is good that sin by the
[34:31] Commandment might become exceedingly
[34:33] sinful so God remember we got to tie
[34:35] this in with Galatians God set up the
[34:37] law to as a school Master to bring us to
[34:40] Christ amen amen God put all 613 laws in
[34:44] there to get you and I to understand I
[34:46] need a savior amen I need Grace I need
[34:49] someone to forgive me of all my
[34:50] trespasses amen amen I need someone to
[34:53] keep the law for me amen I can't do it I
[34:57] need somebody that will keep it for me
[34:58] praise God and God provided him and his
[35:01] name is Jesus Christ
[35:04] amen
[35:06] hallelujah oh I love the word of God
[35:08] don't you verse 14 for we know that the
[35:11] law is spiritual but I am carnal sold
[35:13] under
[35:15] sin how many can say Amen to that I'm a
[35:17] very carnal person
[35:19] amen certainly verse
[35:23] 15 for that which I do I allow not
[35:27] for what I would that I do not but what
[35:31] I hate that I do now remember we just
[35:34] reference first John 3:9 on Sunday and
[35:37] that was one of the brothers that John
[35:38] said that was one of the greatest
[35:39] Revelations he had from Sunday he never
[35:42] understood the soul how does the soul
[35:43] work how can God forgive me he never
[35:46] understood that verse when I preached it
[35:47] and laid it out there now he understands
[35:49] it by God's grace amen I thought that's
[35:51] beautiful I said that's the same thing I
[35:52] needed I needed brother R to preach that
[35:53] to me Hallelujah the now think about
[35:56] that that the holy ghost that comes
[35:58] inside when you when you're born again
[35:59] the holy ghost that comes in there that
[36:01] Holy Ghost never
[36:03] sinned amen and now it's in you amen and
[36:07] now you got a part of God Amen but that
[36:10] was God's part of himself that was for
[36:12] you
[36:13] amen that never sinned Hallelujah and
[36:17] never can sin hallelujah amen that's why
[36:20] Paul says I've never sinned it wasn't me
[36:22] it was the sin that dwells within me
[36:24] praise God Amen wasn't the Eternal part
[36:27] of God that sinned it was this carnal
[36:29] part of me that
[36:30] sinned I'm going to read a quote in a
[36:32] little bit brother says it's like you've
[36:34] got two persons in you right that's why
[36:36] brother could say I'm who's my greatest
[36:38] enemy William brandom he don't even say
[36:40] Satan he says William brandham is my
[36:42] greatest enemy now Satan our enemy of
[36:44] course all his devils and his minions
[36:46] they're all enemies but he said my
[36:48] greatest enemy in other words is the sin
[36:50] nature inside of me right
[36:53] yes so see where you know the law is
[36:56] Holy the the law is good he said but I
[36:59] don't allow myself to obey more I do
[37:02] things that I hate you don't have to
[37:03] raise your hand but maybe did something
[37:05] you hated today right don't feel bad
[37:07] you're in some pretty good company
[37:08] you're in Paul's
[37:10] company you're in the first church age
[37:12] Messengers company amen amen hallelujah
[37:15] you're in David's company praise God
[37:17] right amen the Bible said he despised
[37:20] the word of God when he took bash Sheba
[37:22] in other words he his sin nature was I
[37:24] can't stand that word I despise that
[37:25] word I can have whoever I want now he
[37:28] might have been drinking like on that
[37:29] Sight and Sound you know we don't know
[37:31] but his his flesh that other side of him
[37:33] hated that commandment so he took bash
[37:34] Sheba anyway now Paul on of course A
[37:37] minor level he's got the Holy Ghost it's
[37:39] a new testament but Paul on a minor
[37:41] level says I do things that I hate
[37:46] right so how do you overcome Paul how do
[37:49] you overcome he tells us verse 16 if
[37:52] then I do that which I would not I
[37:54] consent unto the law that that it's good
[37:57] other words oh it's good to sin verse 17
[38:00] now then it is no more I that do it but
[38:03] sin that dwelleth Within Me Church
[38:05] repeat after me say I don't do it I
[38:08] don't do it sin does it sin does it
[38:11] hallelujah praise God Paul said it's not
[38:13] me it's sin that dwells within me amen
[38:17] Verse 18 for I know that in me that is
[38:19] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for
[38:23] to will is present with me but how to
[38:25] perform that which is good I find not
[38:28] how to accomplish in other words how to
[38:31] achieve that which is good I can't find
[38:34] it is that interesting he says I'm like
[38:36] on a journey I'm searching for a way I
[38:38] can obey the word of God and I don't
[38:40] find it sometimes right but the Bible
[38:43] says if you resist Satan he'll flee and
[38:45] then God will draw nigh to you amen so
[38:49] what is what do we understand from this
[38:50] Paul would sin he did things he hated
[38:53] and what it shows what it proves by the
[38:55] Bible he just didn't wait long enough
[38:58] and that's the same for you and I right
[39:01] hallelujah amen we all could resist
[39:03] Satan a little more a little more
[39:05] Faithfully couldn't we I'm talking about
[39:07] when you sin think about when you might
[39:08] have sinned today maybe you made it this
[39:10] far without sinning bless your heart
[39:11] it's possible very possible when I was
[39:14] over there in Theo I hardly you know I
[39:15] was really close to God I felt like I
[39:17] was just really really on fire for God
[39:19] hallelujah amen but think about that if
[39:22] you sin
[39:24] today you you you you W able to
[39:26] accomplish you weren't able to find that
[39:29] strength to
[39:30] obey CU you didn't wait long enough
[39:33] praise God the Bible said in every
[39:34] Temptation there's a way out yes amen
[39:37] amen amen verse 20 for if I do that I
[39:41] would not it is no more I that do it but
[39:43] sin that dwells within me hallelujah
[39:46] it's no more I that sins Hallelujah the
[39:49] seed of God cannot sin Hallelujah God
[39:52] hallelujah it's sin that dwells within
[39:54] me I then find a law that when I was
[39:56] would do good evil is present with me so
[39:59] we have this law whenever I want to do
[40:00] what God wants me to do there's always
[40:02] something there's always going to be
[40:04] something they're tempting me how many
[40:06] ever do that in the morning you want to
[40:07] get up and pray read your Bible but then
[40:09] there's something there's a law there's
[40:11] always something distracting
[40:14] you hallelujah it's a law or maybe you
[40:17] like to study at night or pray at night
[40:19] that's wonderful but then there's always
[40:20] a law sleepiness is going to be fighting
[40:23] you right or calling somebody or or
[40:26] texting somebody or watching something
[40:29] there's always going to be that law you
[40:30] know it so what do you have to do you
[40:32] have to be stirred up the Bible say you
[40:33] got to be stirred up stir up your mind
[40:36] and be ready to obey the word of
[40:38] God because you know it's a law it's
[40:41] it's always going to operate it's always
[40:42] going to be that way when I want to do
[40:44] good something's going to be right there
[40:46] now for me is when I want to study
[40:47] there's always going to be some popcorn
[40:49] right there that maybe once to maybe
[40:51] it's tell me to eat it
[40:53] right it might distract me from studying
[40:56] right that's I've always had that I've
[40:58] always had that law that law is always
[41:00] there right or if I want to fast oh I
[41:03] can smell the Burger King driving down
[41:06] the street now I don't buy it but I sure
[41:07] smell
[41:08] it right like those brothers from uh Jun
[41:11] City they said what's that smell I said
[41:13] that's Burger King we were getting the
[41:14] Chipotle said that's hard Temptation
[41:17] sometimes but there's a law anytime you
[41:19] want to do good the devil's right there
[41:21] to try to stop you so you got to have
[41:24] that sword of the spirit ready to fight
[41:26] Hallelujah we ready to fight Hallelujah
[41:29] so this time I'm going to find a way to
[41:31] do this amen amen I'm going to find a
[41:34] way to pray find a way to read my Bible
[41:36] I'm going to find a way to witness I'm
[41:37] going to find a way to listen to that
[41:39] sermon praise God
[41:40] am yes but he was honest sometimes I try
[41:45] to find it and I don't find it obviously
[41:47] because he didn't wait long enough
[41:49] because the Bible say you wait on the
[41:50] Lord what happens you renew your
[41:52] strength
[41:54] amen so the church there's that law the
[41:57] law is always going to be there right
[41:59] just like the law of sin and death sin
[42:02] die sin die right it's a law you're
[42:04] always going to find
[42:06] that verse 22 for I Delight in the law
[42:09] of God after the inward man see there's
[42:11] a part of us that inside that really
[42:13] loves the word amen
[42:15] hallelujah right we you know let's be
[42:18] honest there might be days we don't feel
[42:19] like going to church but I tell you once
[42:20] we get here the inward guy gets happy
[42:23] right amen the inward woman starts reing
[42:27] I used guys so I thought I used woman so
[42:28] you understand what I'm talking about
[42:31] the inward part of you now I'm happy now
[42:33] let's sing now praise God isn't that
[42:35] funny you know you struggled all day to
[42:37] do it but you get here it's so easy why
[42:39] cuz we got licks of fire amen there more
[42:42] fire here amen there's more faith
[42:44] there's more confidence in God there's
[42:46] more of Faith here there's more
[42:47] obedience I it's a great atmosphere to
[42:49] worship God hallelujah amen that's why
[42:52] it's so important that we gather
[42:53] together more as we see that day
[42:55] approaching
[42:57] see the inward man Delights in it the
[43:00] fleshly man is contrary to it it's enity
[43:03] it's hatred against God right your flesh
[43:06] don't want to serve God your flesh don't
[43:07] want to obey Paul says but I Delight
[43:10] after the inward man that's how that's
[43:13] how you have to always know that God
[43:14] will forgive you because it wasn't the
[43:16] inward man that sinned it was the
[43:18] outward man right right inward man loves
[43:21] to talk about the word inward man loves
[43:24] to hear sermons and take notes on the
[43:25] Bible
[43:27] and go study it at home the inward man
[43:30] love to do that verse 23 but I see
[43:33] another law in my members Waring against
[43:34] the law of my mind this is why brother
[43:36] calls it the greatest battle ever fought
[43:38] the greatest War that's ever been fought
[43:40] and it brings me into captivity to the
[43:43] law of sin which is in my members now
[43:46] captivity look at that church every time
[43:48] we sin we're LED away captive like we
[43:51] seen that song I'm no stranger to a
[43:53] prison right All My Hope Is In Jesus
[43:55] isn't that true true the Bible said
[43:58] every time we sin we let ourselves be
[44:00] locked in a jail
[44:01] prison but then Jesus every time lets us
[44:04] out praise God Amen he lets us out just
[44:07] by saying I'm sorry forgive me try me
[44:09] again hallelujah amen It Wasn't Me Jesus
[44:13] it was my sin Hallelujah it wasn't the
[44:16] seed that you placed in me it was this
[44:18] awful sinful flesh hallelujah amen and
[44:21] if you really mean it he lets you out
[44:23] amen now you're not a slave anymore now
[44:25] you're a free man or woman amen amen
[44:28] amen that isn't that interesting Church
[44:31] you know it's that it's just quite a
[44:32] thought there every time we sin we
[44:35] become a slave to it for short term
[44:38] right so think about that in and out of
[44:40] jail every
[44:42] day and Jesus keeps letting us out now
[44:45] that's love amen that is Mercy that's
[44:49] Divine longsuffering amen think about
[44:52] that we walk I not say like we commit a
[44:55] sin we get arrested every day put into
[44:58] prison captivity and then we ask for
[45:00] forgiveness and he forgives us and lets
[45:01] us out the same day amen you don't get
[45:05] in there for a week you don't get in
[45:07] there for two weeks it's not a fiveyear
[45:09] sentence amen it's the grace of almighty
[45:12] God now depending on the sin there might
[45:15] be some natural consequences right I'm
[45:17] talking about brother man says minor
[45:19] sins I'm if you got if you're doing
[45:20] major sins you're not born
[45:22] again because you got the fruit of the
[45:24] spirit praise God hallelujah but if your
[45:26] fruit is under death you're not quite
[45:28] born again it's time to get born again
[45:30] praise God Amen and I love this look at
[45:33] he says in verse 24 oh Wretched Man that
[45:35] I am this means Afflicted oh Afflicted
[45:38] man that I am it means enduring toils
[45:41] and troubles oh troubled man that I am
[45:44] anybody ever feel like that you're
[45:46] troubled right I'm
[45:49] Afflicted that's why brother man says we
[45:50] want to be we want to be set free from
[45:52] this uh what do he call it uh stank
[45:55] house what's he what's it called uh I
[45:57] can't remember that pest house there it
[45:59] is there it is sorry I couldn't think of
[46:00] that word there he said this is a pest
[46:02] house like a house of House Of Mice a
[46:05] house of rats we went to the pet store
[46:07] last week I saw a bunch of rats at the
[46:08] pet store pests right bunch of
[46:12] mice and that's what brother says your
[46:14] body is like a pest house full of rats
[46:17] and mice running all over it's just a
[46:19] bunch of it's a it's a corrupted area
[46:22] and Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am
[46:25] who should deliver me from this body of
[46:28] death oh right Church how many desire to
[46:31] have a body that's free from sin amen if
[46:34] you do you're just like Paul amen Paul
[46:37] said this body is wretched this body's
[46:40] Afflicted it's got an awful sin disease
[46:43] it's almost incurable but it is curable
[46:46] when you get a new body praise God it
[46:49] will be curable at the Rapture amen amen
[46:53] when death is swallowed up in life
[46:55] Hallelujah
[46:56] amen he said oh Afflicted man that I am
[46:59] who shall deliver me and then he answers
[47:01] it there's Deliverance in Jesus Christ
[47:05] amen he said I thank God through Jesus
[47:07] Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I
[47:11] myself serve the law of God Amen but
[47:15] with the flesh the law of sin now
[47:17] brother R tells us this is very
[47:18] interesting he never mentions the
[47:21] soul because remember the soul is the
[47:24] nature of your being
[47:26] but that's not what you serve god with
[47:28] that's the nature that your mind has to
[47:31] draw
[47:32] on praise God
[47:35] Amen your mind has to pray and ask God
[47:38] and you have to pray and say Lord what
[47:39] do you lead me to do and sometimes the
[47:40] spirit of God in your soul and the
[47:42] church said
[47:44] amen will be a still Small Voice or
[47:46] you'll just feel some some leaning from
[47:48] within you it's God speaking to you
[47:50] through the soul but your mind has to be
[47:53] brought into the service of God the mind
[47:56] has to ask the soul what must I do
[48:00] praise God Amen he says I serve God with
[48:03] my mind he didn't say soul right because
[48:06] the soul is sealed to the day of
[48:07] redemption the soul is just a nature
[48:09] nature right
[48:10] nature so is a nature that that that
[48:14] that that's your identity that's what
[48:15] you are but you think and make decisions
[48:18] in your mind and so the Mind must
[48:20] overcome the Mind must draw inspiration
[48:23] from the spirit of God in our soul
[48:26] hallelujah amen amen and this is my
[48:29] service to God let me look up that word
[48:31] serve to be a slave
[48:35] Glory I thought I'd get a few amens on
[48:37] that keep thinking or just keep
[48:40] listening in other words my mind is a
[48:43] slave to my soul amen right that's how
[48:47] we got to look at it we have to make our
[48:49] mind a slave the mind you must do
[48:52] everything the soul says amen amen if
[48:54] not we're going to get into cap
[48:55] captivity it happens at least once a day
[48:57] for most of us yes you might make it a
[49:00] couple of days you might make it like
[49:01] Cam said you might make it a week I
[49:02] don't know all things are possible but
[49:05] pretty soon you're going to fall short
[49:07] yes and that mind needs to get itself
[49:10] back into slavery to the Holy Spirit
[49:14] that's inside of you amen praise God
[49:17] brother says that statement he says all
[49:19] that the believer needs is already
[49:21] inside of you and sometimes isn't funny
[49:23] church sometimes we're looking up to
[49:25] heaven God send me something from heaven
[49:27] and that's you know something could come
[49:28] from heaven but really if the spirit of
[49:30] God is in you then the the direction or
[49:32] the the answer is already in you praise
[49:35] God amen
[49:39] hallelujah it's
[49:41] beautiful oh Afflicted man that I am I'm
[49:45] Afflicted with sin in my
[49:48] members but I thank God through Jesus
[49:50] Christ Our
[49:52] Lord he's going to deliver me
[49:56] hallelujah amen every day brother amen
[49:58] we're promised he's going to deliver us
[50:00] yes amen every day every time we go into
[50:02] captivity sister me God's going to
[50:04] deliver us out of captivity amen he
[50:07] promised Hallelujah that's a promise of
[50:10] God he knows we're wretched of our own
[50:11] selves he knows sin dwells within our
[50:13] members so he's faithful and just to
[50:16] forgive us and Deliver Us from all of
[50:18] our afflictions amen hallelujah now I
[50:22] want to read this quote brother R
[50:23] brother R uh gets asked about Roman
[50:25] 7even I don't know if you've heard this
[50:27] lately if you haven't you're going to
[50:29] like it if you've heard it lately you're
[50:31] going to enjoy it even
[50:32] more questions and answers part four
[50:35] 1964 Romans 7:14 to18 we know that the
[50:38] law is spiritual but I'm carnal sold
[50:40] under sin and then he reads the rest of
[50:42] the verse it says this I cannot
[50:44] understand they ask brother Bram I can't
[50:46] understand what I just read Romans 7 uh
[50:50] 14 to
[50:51] 18 that I do what I hate I don't do what
[50:54] I want to do
[50:56] I'm a Wretched Man and brother B answers
[50:58] this he said well Paul he said speaking
[51:01] to the Romans let me kind of Polish it
[51:03] up so you can
[51:05] see who's ever polished their shoes
[51:07] before I do it once a month or something
[51:09] like that what do polished you makes it
[51:12] more shiny right makes it more clear
[51:15] gets all the dirt off so I like how
[51:17] brother says that to you the word of
[51:19] God's all dirty but let me polish it up
[51:21] so it
[51:22] shines Hallelujah let me polish that up
[51:25] with some prophetic Revelation
[51:27] Hallelujah right now look brother says
[51:31] quote Paul said he said in me is two
[51:34] persons right one wants me to do wrong
[51:37] the other one wants me to do and every
[51:39] time I start to do right then wrong
[51:40] hinders me yes so brother tried to
[51:45] polish It Up by saying you got two
[51:46] persons inside of you you got a good
[51:49] person and you got an evil person yes
[51:52] and the church said amen but said you're
[51:55] outward man which is controlled by six
[51:57] senses I think he means
[51:59] five your inward man controlled by one
[52:01] sense which is Faith and this Faith
[52:03] disagrees with all senses if the senses
[52:06] doesn't agree with faith he's talking
[52:08] about the soul the soul will disagree
[52:11] with anything you see feel taste touch
[52:13] or smell it'll disagree with any of that
[52:16] if we'll listen to our
[52:18] soul he said but one is contrary to the
[52:22] other but as long as your senses agree
[52:24] with faith wonderful but if your senses
[52:27] disagree with faith then leave the
[52:29] senses
[52:30] alone right like an easy example uh you
[52:35] know the sense of smell if you're if you
[52:36] were alcoholic and you smell that beer
[52:40] can you know your senses are telling you
[52:42] to get it but the soul says don't do
[52:45] it so if the senses disagree with the
[52:48] word you got to stay with the word amen
[52:53] right Hallelujah
[52:57] he said Jesus made a statement a promise
[52:59] the inside man says that's true the
[53:02] outside man reasons that it can't be
[53:04] true to you he says then ignore the
[53:06] outside man and accept the inside man
[53:09] that's the same thing Paul was speaking
[53:12] of Hallelujah but said we are carnal and
[53:16] that part must perish but then inside
[53:18] we're Spirit man a soul inside and
[53:20] that's faith in God's word then we bring
[53:22] our entire body under subjection to the
[53:26] word by Faith by accepting what God Said
[53:30] Amen oh church that's when we get
[53:32] Victory when we accept What God Says and
[53:35] when we obey What God Says
[53:38] amen
[53:43] hallelujah brother says this as long as
[53:46] you're in this life you're going to be
[53:47] sticky he's talking about a caber right
[53:50] like a uh like a thorny plant it's got
[53:54] sticky thorns on it
[53:56] he says as long as you're in this light
[53:57] you're going to be sticky and have a
[53:58] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[54:01] as long as you live it's hard to say
[54:04] Amen to that but it's
[54:06] true you're going to be bothered all the
[54:09] days of your life by that other person
[54:12] living inside of
[54:13] you but the inside of you you're born
[54:16] again and when you're raised up you're
[54:18] in the likeness of Christ and all the
[54:20] sin is gone gone from you he says amen
[54:24] he says that's the thing
[54:25] and then he goes to this story of this
[54:27] man in Arizona he was at a Indian
[54:31] reservation and the man would come up
[54:33] and say me sick he'd say me sick me sick
[54:36] how many remember that story me sick me
[54:37] sick brother would pray for him he come
[54:39] back again you need prayer me sick all
[54:41] he knew was me sick well eventually he
[54:44] got saved he got healed in brother man's
[54:46] meetings by Jesus and then he got saved
[54:49] and then he got able to learn some new
[54:52] words brother says someone told me he
[54:54] got got converted and received the Holy
[54:56] Ghost and he said to the the Indian man
[54:59] how you getting along and he said pretty
[55:00] good and pretty
[55:04] bad so if I if I greet you at church and
[55:07] say how you doing brother amen I won't
[55:10] be offended if you say pretty good and
[55:11] pretty bad I won't be offended I know
[55:15] you're talking about a
[55:17] quote he said well how do you mean
[55:19] you're pretty bad and pretty good he
[55:20] called him chief he was the chief of the
[55:23] tribe well since me receive the Holy
[55:26] Ghost he said there's been two dogs
[55:28] inside of me one of them is the bad dog
[55:31] and one of them is the good dog now he
[55:33] says black and white and he said they
[55:35] argue all the
[55:37] time how many ever had arguing mind
[55:39] battles the flesh is saying do this do
[55:41] this you're say no I'm not doing that I
[55:43] know it's wrong I know what the word
[55:45] says well no you should do it you it
[55:47] make you feel better well no it's not
[55:48] it's going to get me grieving the Holy
[55:50] Spirit and they argue back and forth all
[55:52] the time that's right yes that's why
[55:55] sometimes we're not so happy we've had
[55:57] arguments all day but if you were at my
[55:59] house you wouldn't see me argu with my
[56:00] wife it was Jesse arguing with Jesse
[56:03] right all
[56:05] day maybe not all day praise
[56:10] God he said they argue all the time they
[56:13] growl and fight at one
[56:15] another you ever feel like you're
[56:17] growling and fighting inside I just want
[56:19] to do this no you're not doing this I
[56:21] just do it no I don't want to do
[56:23] it
[56:27] the he said the white dog wants me to do
[56:29] good he said the other one wants me to
[56:31] do bad well Chief which one of them wins
[56:34] the
[56:36] fight well that depends on which one
[56:39] Chief feeds the
[56:42] most so I think that's a good answer
[56:45] here see there just depends on the
[56:47] Waring of the body that's in you it
[56:49] depends on which one we cater to which
[56:53] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[56:56] after the things of the world or the
[56:58] spiritual nature after the things of God
[57:01] that does it amen and the church said
[57:04] amen we saw this earlier go to uh Romans
[57:08] I believe it was Romans 5 this just come
[57:10] to my mind right now or was it Romans
[57:14] 6 oh no it's Romans 6 yeah Romans
[57:20] 6 yes we get the same idea Romans 612
[57:23] let not sin there Reign your mortal
[57:26] body that you should obey it in the lust
[57:29] thereof in other words Church don't let
[57:32] don't let yourself get in a rut where
[57:33] you're addicted to a sin right yes
[57:37] right don't become a slave to that right
[57:40] Don't Let It Rain don't let it rule your
[57:42] life right and you've heard me say this
[57:44] before I ask God this all the time
[57:46] Lord keep me from sinning publicly that
[57:49] I don't bring reproach upon the church
[57:51] or or the
[57:52] people in other words I prayed God let
[57:54] my sin just be private between you and
[57:57] me that's how I want to live so close to
[58:00] God I don't bring any reproach upon the
[58:01] church or the message or the gospel
[58:03] because lots of preachers have brought
[58:05] reproach upon
[58:07] Christ and I pray God just keep please
[58:10] keep me so humble just rebuke me
[58:12] whatever you have to do rebuke me over
[58:13] and over again so that it could just be
[58:15] between you and I and nobody will see my
[58:17] struggles except me and you I must tell
[58:20] Jesus all my struggles praise God yes
[58:23] amen that's been my
[58:26] prayer I don't want sin to Reign Over Me
[58:29] I want to Reign Over sin yes amen
[58:31] because I'm a king you're a king you're
[58:34] a queen sisters you got something to
[58:36] Reign Over praise God Amen you got
[58:38] something to rule over
[58:40] Hallelujah I just I'm going to go and
[58:42] preach this one I just read this this
[58:43] morning in Deuteronomy God told Moses
[58:47] when you get Kings tell those kings they
[58:49] need to write the entire Bible out every
[58:52] day every year did you know that
[58:55] kings were supposed to make a fresh copy
[58:57] of the Bible every year and the Bible
[58:59] said they got to read the Bible every
[59:02] day who does Kings well I'm so busy I
[59:05] have so many responsibilities if you're
[59:06] a king you better read the word every
[59:08] single day hallelujah amen the only way
[59:11] he said your heart won't get turned away
[59:13] by chariots I need more
[59:16] chariots I need more money I or women
[59:19] right or wives or sexual Temptation uh
[59:22] and then he says uh other temptation
[59:24] Kings will or money all these things
[59:26] Wars and soldiers he says You must write
[59:29] the word of God out every day every year
[59:31] make a new Bible every year read the
[59:33] Bible every day study the Bible That's
[59:36] how you overcome this is how you fight
[59:38] your battles Kings amen amen and sisters
[59:41] that's how Queens fight their battles
[59:42] hallelujah amen
[59:46] amen I've never done that read the Bible
[59:49] in a year thing usually takes me a
[59:51] little longer because I I can't just
[59:52] read the Bible I've got to preach the
[59:54] Bible
[59:56] but there's no law that says you have to
[59:58] you know that's just a suggestion for
[59:59] kings of course their Bible is a lot
[1:00:01] shorter than ours is he only had the
[1:00:03] first five books of the Torah that been
[1:00:06] pretty easy to get through that in a
[1:00:07] year but the point is if you want to
[1:00:09] Reign spiritually if you want to Reign
[1:00:12] Over sin you got to take the word of God
[1:00:13] in every day that's the way Kings fight
[1:00:17] that's the way the Kings rule verse 13
[1:00:21] now here here this now brother this is
[1:00:22] what brother says K he used the word
[1:00:24] hater but the Bible uses yield same
[1:00:28] word yield neither yield your members as
[1:00:31] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:00:33] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:00:36] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:00:39] members as instruments of righteous unto

[1:01:51] there bud musicians can come I'm gonna
[1:01:53] let this be public too
[1:01:55] kind of involves my
[1:01:58] wife I guess I'll try to relate this if
[1:02:01] the Holy Spirit would bring me something
[1:02:02] to
[1:02:10] this I guess you know I just relate it
[1:02:13] like this you know my wife
[1:02:15] uh so Sunday night uh after church we
[1:02:20] went home
[1:02:22] and um you everybody left which was that
[1:02:24] was fine but the uh The Junction City
[1:02:27] Saints stayed after and they had
[1:02:29] questions for
[1:02:30] me okay they had questions like the
[1:02:32] sisters they wondered about those cloths
[1:02:34] that they wear you ever see them wear of
[1:02:35] course you probably see them wear the
[1:02:36] cloths that was a question um they had a
[1:02:39] question about uh ties and offerings so
[1:02:41] I try to answer that I I recorded the I
[1:02:43] recorded the
[1:02:45] entire uh
[1:02:48] conversation but God was really moving
[1:02:50] in in our midst there God was really
[1:02:51] moving uh I I can I watch I was watching
[1:02:54] faces
[1:02:54] brother said you can see when Satan gets
[1:02:56] upset on people's
[1:02:58] faces
[1:03:01] right and so I just you know I felt the
[1:03:03] leadership of the Holy Spirit God was
[1:03:04] bringing me verses I just kind of felt
[1:03:05] like I
[1:03:06] was I was doing the will of
[1:03:10] God
[1:03:13] so so we were here probably till like
[1:03:15] 4:30 maybe I don't know and I stayed
[1:03:18] after to clean up there you
[1:03:20] know but uh that night I went home and
[1:03:23] uh I went to bed and this is kind of
[1:03:26] just like a something that never
[1:03:28] happened to me before now amen this
[1:03:29] might happened to you one time uh I was
[1:03:32] sleeping I woke up at 1 or 1:30 a.m. and
[1:03:35] I could not
[1:03:38] breathe no air was getting in I've never
[1:03:41] had this
[1:03:42] happen it was one of the scariest
[1:03:44] moments of My Life um and I sat up and
[1:03:47] I'm
[1:03:48] like I'm going to try not to be too
[1:03:50] dramatic
[1:03:51] here I could not breathe I couldn't get
[1:03:54] any any air in no air was coming out and
[1:03:56] I'm
[1:03:58] like you know Christian's like what
[1:04:00] what's going on what's going on you know
[1:04:04] um I've never had this happen before and
[1:04:07] so um I didn't know what to do but I've
[1:04:10] choked I've choked before on food and so
[1:04:12] I went and got some water well I thought
[1:04:13] the only thing you know I'm just you
[1:04:16] know I'm just standing there like by the
[1:04:17] bed I don't know what's going on and in
[1:04:19] my mind I'm thinking this is
[1:04:22] it you're going to die
[1:04:25] thank God it
[1:04:26] wasn't um all I can think of in a moment
[1:04:30] was just run to the bathroom try to get
[1:04:32] some water so I ran into the bathroom
[1:04:33] there and then Kristen followed me you
[1:04:36] know she's going she's really upset I'm
[1:04:39] upset and I'm like and then Kristen's
[1:04:42] like do you want me to do the
[1:04:43] heick I couldn't talk all
[1:04:46] they I couldn't
[1:04:49] talk and uh all of a sudden she did the
[1:04:51] heck when she did the heck she just said
[1:04:53] Jesus Jesus Jesus and as soon as she
[1:04:55] said Jesus it's like something clicked
[1:04:58] and like the window opened amen amen I
[1:05:02] mean this was I don't know how many
[1:05:03] seconds it was but I didn't have air for
[1:05:05] a while I didn't see anything closing in
[1:05:07] but I'm like I'm going to die I'm going
[1:05:10] to die right here in my
[1:05:12] bathroom as soon as she said Jesus it's
[1:05:15] like the window open and I could breathe
[1:05:17] a little
[1:05:18] bit and eventually I cough cough cough
[1:05:22] um and so you know
[1:05:25] Christen was extremely scared right well
[1:05:28] I you know the next day I didn't think
[1:05:29] much of it and I thought you know I
[1:05:32] thought well maybe uh I sleep with my
[1:05:34] mouth open and maybe my throat got too
[1:05:36] dry and Kristen said I think it was a
[1:05:38] spiritual attack of
[1:05:40] Satan she's like you should check and
[1:05:42] see if there was any testimonies from
[1:05:45] Sunday and have you ever had that
[1:05:47] brother where you can't breathe in your
[1:05:48] bed or something like that I know a
[1:05:50] couple of Brothers Simons had it and it
[1:05:51] was an attack of the enemy right
[1:05:56] and I've never had that before but as
[1:05:58] soon as she said Jesus
[1:05:59] Jesus now in my mind I was like water
[1:06:02] water you know like my in other words my
[1:06:04] mind was so
[1:06:06] car thank God for a Godly wife yes my
[1:06:10] carnal mind I I didn't think of I just
[1:06:12] think of water because I was in a carnal
[1:06:14] condition the Bible says we're carnal
[1:06:16] sold under
[1:06:18] sin and so I texted the sisters and the
[1:06:21] brothers that came and one of the
[1:06:23] sisters said sure enough when we were in
[1:06:24] that meeting she said I was I don't know
[1:06:26] if you saw it she said I was battling
[1:06:28] depression for 2 weeks because somebody
[1:06:30] called me up and said I'm condemned I'm
[1:06:31] not going to get the Holy Ghost and she
[1:06:33] said when I taught that about the head
[1:06:35] coverings when I taught through the
[1:06:38] scriptures she said that depression left
[1:06:40] and she left here full of joy and she
[1:06:43] got all of her Victory back and brother
[1:06:46] even said it when people get
[1:06:47] deliverances those demons would follow
[1:06:49] him to the hotel room and sometimes you
[1:06:52] have to fight them off let me know if
[1:06:53] you want those quotes
[1:06:54] they would follow him to the hotel room
[1:06:56] and try to torment
[1:06:57] him I'm not saying what that what I'm
[1:07:00] not saying that's what happened but
[1:07:01] that's what I think happened because
[1:07:03] I've never had anything like that
[1:07:07] before and so I've been reminded this
[1:07:09] week of the importance of calling on
[1:07:13] Jesus also the mortality of all of us if
[1:07:18] time goes on one day I'll breathe my
[1:07:21] last
[1:07:22] breath when I do that I want people to
[1:07:25] be singing about Jesus shouting the name
[1:07:28] of Jesus Hallelujah I was reminded of
[1:07:31] mortality it's a real
[1:07:32] thing I was also reminded on the power
[1:07:35] of calling on the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:38] so that's just a little testimony I
[1:07:39] thought I'd share not really sure I
[1:07:41] could tie that into the message but I
[1:07:42] just want to encourage
[1:07:45] you you know in our weaknesses and our
[1:07:47] strengths he'll come Deliver Us praise
[1:07:49] God I was certainly delivered on Sunday
[1:07:52] night think about that Christmas see it

[1:08:22] she said Jesse it reminded me of my Mor
[1:08:24] of your mortality of our
[1:08:28] mortality one day if God carries we'll
[1:08:30] pass beyond the
[1:08:32] veil I just heard brother Ram say this
[1:08:34] week he said I'm so glad I settled that
[1:08:36] question many years ago he said I told
[1:08:39] Jesus I don't want any trouble down at
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:42] river how many want how many want a safe
[1:08:44] passage at the river praise God am you

[1:09:04] faithful that was a very scary moment
[1:09:07] but Jesus Christ came to

[1:09:11] name of
