so I want to kind of preach and build up the spirit build up the faith and then pray at the end and we'll ask everybody to pray up here together at the end so it kind of gets us in a good atmosphere in prayer but I had like four or five prayer requests given to me after church a lot of people need a prayer to me so I just opened up with the word of Prayer let's just bow our heads here gracious Lord Jesus we thank you to your God for all your love for all your mercy or your loving-kindness it's better than life or good thank you your perfect love thank you for your expressions of love or

gonna try so let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter three verse fourteen I like to go there I spent most of my studying time yesterday on this morning's message and so didn't quite to go as I didn't get to go as deep as I wanted to in the numerology study so I'm gonna save that for Wednesday hopefully study on that but let's go to Ecclesiastes 3 verse 14 and 15 I like to preach part 16 and this is called God require that which is passed I want to just briefly preach through these chapters here this has been such a blessing to me preaching through proverbs and Ecclesiastes it's been so wonderful I feel like God's given me a great revelation on the Kuip type of attitude that we should have what wisdom looks like today and how we can overcome despair as we preach on last time how we can overcome the discouragements of life Solomon was so over over overcome with despair so discouraged and yet he had everything physically he could possibly want and so it's been just been a great time of Revelation to see that we can have the joy and love of Jesus Christ and be just as happy now amen with having very little we should be so joyous so let's read please ask these three 14 and 15 and I'll set my timer here let's just go about half an hour and then hopefully by that time faith is face should be risen then we have six prayer requests yeah six let me read those before you read our text Jerry the gentlemen they're at giant ego he wants prayer he's gonna try to get Sundays off so he don't have to work on Sundays anymore cuz he already should have them off also I want to see my friend Seth save he's the one whose dad is God is healing his dad at the hospital Tonya said she had high trouble that's why she didn't come today she had I trouble so she even sent me a text saying I know God's a healer so let's just pray ask God to man that's a good that's a good confession let's pray to God will manifest his healing power to Tonya and then brother bill is in a campground where it's all flooded out so it's prayer that God will take away the flood waters and then Karen said pray for brother Norris when you burn when Keith Randolph was here I went up for prayer I stood in for brother Loras and Karen said she noticed a change the day after so we're still wanting more change but she said she said I want to give you a less timoni so I know I felt let the Lord that time to go up to her prayer for him that was a real encouragement but we love our brother and our sister so let's pray for him when we're done and then Christopher Jose said he's happy he had fevers all last night and today so let's I told him we'd pray for them so let's preach a little bit like I said 30 minutes and then we'll we'll close the prayer maybe we'll call everybody up here for prayer just cut so it kind of gets us out of the mold you know and we can raise our faith up here together please ask these three 14 and 15 I'll read 14 then we'll read 15 together verse 14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do with it that men should fear before him let's read verse 15 ready one two three that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath all ready been and God requires that which is passed let's have a word of Prayer let's just pray here father we love you Lord we love to sing your praises we love to worship you and father we just asked Lord it through the reading of this word you anoint this word God and Lord just continue to open up proverbs and Ecclesiastes Lord it's truly been a lord a transforming book for me Lord just to see your power Lord and the sea Lord the attitude we should have Lord towards our life and how blessed we are through the blood of Jesus Christ pour Solomon Lord he was a godly wonderful man buddy he lived before that atonement Lord and because of that Lord he he went through these things but Lord on this side now we can see how Lord you left your peace you said if I if I leave if I go away I'll leave my peace I'll leave my joy and Lord we know there is no greater joy than that joy of Christ Jesus so lord help us to learn from this help us to walk pleasing to you and anoint us here tonight as we want to pray as well the closing in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen see there for you Scott okay so I like to just preach a real shotgun message here just real I think that's the right word let's preach it kind of quick here by God's grace I preached chapters one two and part of three so I want to I want to preach three and four if I can tonight on this half-hour so let's go to chapter 3 verse 1 verses 1 to 8 are pretty familiar and I think it's just good to read over this to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away verse 7 a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love the time to hate a time of war and a time of peace amen so we know brother branham said this to do God a service first it must be it's time to do it the very first thing if we're ever gonna do God a service we've got to have the timing of the Lord amen so that's why this text is so critical to us before we do anything we should say Lord is this the time is this the right time to do this is this the time to do that I think we can all apply it to our lives you know what some of these things say is this the time for me to be married or this time for me to have children or this time for me to have this job or is this a time for us to start a church you know all these things in my life that I've seen God has directed the timing of it and we've always pray lord if it be your will let it be that let thy will be done not my will because we know it'll be done correctly if it's done in God's time praise God because remember David did everything when he tried to do God a service bringing the ARCA to Jerusalem he did everything right except he didn't consult the Word of God the timing was right the worship was right everything was right except he didn't consult the word he didn't consult the Prophet that's the only thing he missed everything else was good because remember three months later he did everything the same and it just went smoothly and perfectly and it was a great rejoicing revival time for Israel he just missed one thing the word it was the right time and so church that's so that's why prayer so important prayer will lead us to the right time prayer will use the right time and if we really devote ourselves to prayer and put a situation up before God in prayer and we try not to push it try not to make it happen then we know God will do it in his time God knows we're human God knows we're not prophets God knows all these things and we've just got to trust God Lord you know I'm not a prophet you know I don't see your visions you know I don't hear voices so you've got to direct me give me give me trust give me confidence that you will direct everything in your time amen and then we do our part by waiting upon him for his time and then looking to the word look to the word judge everything by the word like we were talking earlier you know at lunch like how could these things happen in jeffersonville how could these things happen the thing is they're not looking to the word we've got to look to the word because the pattern will never change that's what our text was for tonight and I want to make sure we just revisit that again okay so first it must be his time it must be the season you know I think of my friend who just died at 42 years old this must have been the season for him to die he's 42 there's a time a season to be born and a season to die so no doubt God must have give him some type of I don't you know I've been hurting testimonies come out about that but there must have been some type of warning because there's a season and just like now we can see the season for fall is almost on in fact Haven said this morning daddy it's almost winter time you know I'm like oh no not winter time I don't think about snow but you know God so just as obvious as this is that winters on its way so it is with our lives God has to give us a sign for all these things a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up a time to kill time to heal break down and build up all these things God has to make it simple for us because we know he's revealed in simplicity God's not the author of confusion praise God he's the author of understanding Amen so I just want to make sure I emphasize that first it must be his time so we must wait on the Lord if that's the very first thing we must wait upon the Lord for his timing now verse 9 and 10 now he breaks off from that thought so he lays that thought in there and then he goes to the next thought the next thought is what profit is there in his labor so we can see right now Solomon's still pretty pessimistic he's still pretty disc remember in Chapter two he was really discouraged he said I hate life a man who had unlimited women unlimited money unlimited power and he said I hate life my can you imagine that that shows how sin takes you further than you want to go that shows you how sin is only pleasurable for a season amen if all the women and all the money and all the riches if all that wouldn't satisfy it shows you that the Bible's true praise God only the joy of the Lord satisfies yes I'm so joyful tonight amen glory that we can have access to the presence of God amen to the joy of the Lord verse 9 what profit has he that labor in that wherein he lay birth I've seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it oh yeah in verse 11 he goes back to this so see verse 11 he says he have made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end this is an odd scripture doesn't seem very odd to you he said God has set the world or this means the desire for eternity if you look in the Hebrew it's a long duration always ancient time perpetual old God has set the desire for eternity in our hearts and so this means that we are us we are a human spirit we are a supernatural creature living a natural experience see God set it in our hearts there's something supernatural in us but we can't find can't quite find everything out yet because our bodies haven't been changed but when our bodies are changed then shall we know even as we are known let me say like this church you are known in the mind of God you are known and when you get that new body then you will know just as you are known by him amen but see this is man man desires this he desires this realization there's something he wants and he just wants to feel that eternity he desires to know eternal things but he can't find it out here on this side and Solomon got discouraged verse 12 for I know that there is no good in them for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all of us labor it is the gift of God praise the Lord so see God's gifts are simple things as enjoying life eating and drink and the fact that we get to go and fellowship between services or eat when we have Carians that's a gift of God because like my friend who passed away I'm sure all I like another meal with him it's been years since I had one and brother BAM said I would give you a hundred million dollars push a button for one hour to talk with my dad who has already passed member that quote I'd pay a hundred million he said I wouldn't even be what do you me a question I'll give a 100 million dollars so I can press the button and talk to my dad for one hour see it's the time that we have with people that's the real value that's the real value and so this is what Solomon is learning through the course of his life now I forgot to read this too I just wrote down some things God makes everything beautiful Jesus's death and Beryl did not seem beautiful but God made it beautiful in his time hallelujah Moses is life as a murderer and as a runaway slave did not appear beautiful but God made a beautiful in his time Joseph was in prison thirteen years it didn't seem very beautiful but God raised him up to the right hand of Pharaoh God makes everything beautiful in his time amen and you could go through more examples but those are the ones that just kind of come to my heart God makes everything beautiful in his time praise God even memory even all those slain Jews that were slain by Stalin and Hitler they're all crying out loora loora won't you avenge us and he says I'll avenge you he said but your your brethren must also be killed he said but I'll give you a white robe amen they were not listen Church they rejected him on this earth they said Jesus Christ he's not the Messiah he read they rejected God but God made even that beautiful in his own time he said because you were blinded you didn't know I'll make it beautiful my time I'll give you white robes and then I'll not only that I'll bend your blood right the mother harlot I'll then your blood upon the earth that's exactly right or that Antichrist spirit that was behind it so see this is true God makes everything beautiful in its time now verse 14 and 15 was our text brother Branham calls this room everybody call this who would have thought and in Ecclesiastes 3 God places the keystone of the entire Bible the cornerstone of the entire Bible is in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 along with Hebrews 13:8 the very keystone of the Bible well what's the foundation of the Bible brother Jesse where's of that Ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15 and Hebrews 13:8 that's the problem Aaron tells us of the church age book the very key stone in the midst of all this backsliding of Psalm and God gives him the key stone and this is the key stone I know whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever amen in the midst of his backsliding in the midst of his his trials in his hating life in the midst of his sinful condition God gives them a revelation that whatever God does it's forever you can't add anything to it nor do you take anything from it whatever God does he said men should fear before God amen the very key stone the very foundation of the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that's that's why this morning's message was so important you can't add to the message you can't add to what the Prophet said you can't add to the Bible if you do you break the keystone of the Bible you take the Keystone away so we cannot add we or we can't add or take anything away we've got to leave it just as it is because God requires that which is passed that's verse 15 that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God require that which is passed amen God is requiring us to go back God is requiring what he did on the day of Pentecost guys requiring that today amen Alleluia now here's how brother Branham says it the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scripture one in fact it might be called the keystone of the Bible here it is is the revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen praise God hallelujah he said then unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change he says apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all their ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages amen see God wants us to have our first love Amen that's what God did in the beginning the fusion church age God wants us to keep our first love keep our fire burning be real Christians let the example God requires what is past he requires it today amen so that's the very keystone of the Bible's right there Ecclesiastes chapter 3 praise God amen that's beautiful now verse 16 and 17 he says God shall judge all and moreover I saw under the Sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there and that the place of righteousness that iniquity was there and I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there's a time there for every purpose and for every work praise God see so we must confess all of our knick wa t because unconfessed iniquity will be there on the day of judgment God is gonna judge everybody all people we know that Solomon is aware of that just says that Keystone was there that whatever God does forever God has always judged right he's always judged sin he's always offered mercy he's always offered forgiveness and we must make sure we confess all unrighteousness all iniquity and we must appear before God with no sin Alleluia because he shall judge all remember brother and says now is our tribulation time right now is our purgatory is that right Church now is the time where you're uncomfortable right now it's the time where you feel like you're being burnt up and you feel like you're being going through two hard trials and now is our purgatory we must suffer now that will rain later amen glory verse 18 through 21 I said in my heart concerning the estate the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts Solomon prayed that God show them they're a bunch of beasts but for that which we fought the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befall of them as the one diet so diet the other yay they all have one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all his vanity now of course and you know he's got he's a little he's a little pessimistic here as well but he's letting them know they all have one thing in common man and beast the one thing in common is death verse 20 all go into one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again who note the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the Beast that goeth downward to the earth now Church if you know the message this is a little off right where did spirits go after they died in the Old Testament down did they didn't they go down to Paradise then they go to Abraham's bosom didn't they go down so see that this was just his thinking well believers must go up and sinners must go down right so see he's a little off he's a little off there because the spirits of good men went to Abraham's bosom now after Jesus rose now he might worry we could say he had a revelation of the future because it now after Jesus rose he rose first and then he come back down and then Jesus descended and he brought up captivity and led them captive is that right and now Church of UK if you watch the message to not only do righteous men go up but also their animals go up because where did fritzsche where did frits go brother man's dog right where did Prince's horse go where did that spirit go see so he's saying all these animal spirits go down humans go up but in reality after the cross all believers go up and the animals they loved must go up as well unless that was just a special gift for brother Branham which it could be but is that interesting he sees okay ant men go up humans go down but in all reality that time humans went down perhaps beasts went down but now since the blood of Jesus Christ now can go aren't you glad we can go up prairies god I'm glad that we don't have to go down to Abraham's bosom and glance over and see people suffering yeah we're we're cut from that now by the blood of Jesus Christ amen thank God for that so see he's still wrestling with this man versus beast man has no preeminence over the animal but God of course gives us a further revelation praise God verse 22 wherefore I perceive that there's nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion or who shall bring him to see which shall be after him so he says your portion is to rejoice in your works we do not know what will be after us so rejoice and what God has given you right now we can't worry about the future we can't fret about the future well what happens when I'm not the pastor here anymore is it is it gonna go on we shouldn't worry about that it's all in God's hands amen there's nothing better to just rejoice and what God is doing right now to see this so this is a good scripture for that quote brother Bram tells us write man always rejoice to what God did and what he's gonna do but they're missing what he's doing right now amen god help us to see what he's doing right now and rejoice and God's works going on right now amen beautiful alright chapter four I got 12 minutes so I think I can get through chapter four we'll see and I want to close with these numerous prayer requests verses 1 through 3 solomon sees the oppression that's in jerusalem that isn't this interesting he's the king and he can't even stop oppression now one of that's because of his sins or I wonder what why that why this is but he's the king and he can't even stop oppression in the world so I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the Sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter wherefore I praise the Dead which are already dead more than the living which were yet alive yay better is he than both day which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done on the Sun Sol Solomon sees political oppression so I don't know it was it was in his country or another country he sees political oppression and then he praises the dead since they did not have to live through the depression that's kind of a kind of a we'd say a backslidden thought right he's gonna he's a little bit back said here he's praising the dead or I'm glad the people died and don't have to go through this but later on God gives us a little revelation on this maybe I just thought of that maybe if I can find it real quick oh that was in Proverbs I'm not sure where that's at there's a scripture in Proverbs where it tells us don't fret too much about the oppressed because God is there judge in other words God will fight for all those who are oppressed but Solomon gets so discouraged he starts to oh and be better to be dead than be alive and so he gets so depressed and he gets so down and we see that's political oppression now look at verse 4 through 6 again I considered all travail on every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbor this is also vanity and vexation once you say amen to that and being your neighbor trying to be like the Joneses that's all that's vanity The Fool folded his hands together and eateth his own flesh betters and handful with quietness then both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit amen so see quietness is better than laziness or overwork just a quiet sweet human humble peaceful atmosphere how many want a peaceful atmosphere in your home it's more valuable than laziness sitting around do nothing and also overwork we've got to find the middle of the road praise God Lord give me peace the midst of all these things help me to say no to people this this week I was my wife was really proud of me my principal asked me to take something on I said no I can't do it she was so proud of me that I said no I was actually kind of proud of myself uh-huh you're getting little wisdom there brother Jesse but see this is peacefulness rather than add burden add burden add burden being able to say no and help me just have peace help me at peace Solomon sees the value in peace verse seven and eight to be alone as so his sword travail verse seven and eight then I returned earned i'm stay there and I saw vanity under the Sun there is one alone and there is not a second yeh he has neither child nor brother so see like a only child yet is there no end of all his labor neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do I labor and breed my soul of good this also is vanity yay it is sort or veil so see Solomon saw people they didn't have children they didn't have grandchildren they didn't have brothers sisters and alls they did was overworked themselves and he said that what I want to waste what a waste of your life to just live there I just work work work work work without any pleasure life without any joy in life see so see where they missing their missing love here work all this work work without love and enjoying time he said it's all vanity so see we can't get over balance how many brothers have I talked to over the years that tell me their biggest problem is overwork and they never do nothing to change it have you ever spared that brother William I've my this it's crazy in America in fact we had a brother here who visited from Columbus remember that he's from Ghana remember you remember that brother okay he said boy I came to America they have such great revelation he said we had such a good time in the Lord he said but then the company start working me to death so he said the word here's powerful the revelation is powerful but then the political and economic works you to death he said and he said he's not where he should be spiritually because he's being worked to death I heard a lot of amens on that one amen brother Jesse they work you to death like like they're trying to get me to do something else this week take on someone else do more do more do more I can't do everything I must choose to do what God's calling me to do amen amen but see he sees us here's a man all he does his work he has no one to work for it's vanity he's all overworked wasting his life look at verse nine two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor let's read verse 10:4 if they fall the one will lift up his fella but woe to him that is alone when he falls for he hath not another to help him up verse 11 again have to lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone verse 12 and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three for cold the cord is not quickly broken amen so Solomon sees how two are better than one he says in most cases because two can withstand in opposition but he says I like this he said three for cord is not quickly broken there's power and 3 right 3 is the number of perfection amen and this is used at weddings a three-fold cord is not quickly broken but I want to balance that out too because here Solomon's making an observation but remember Daniels stood alone on numerous occasions he was all alone in the lion's den but church he wasn't alone hey man hallelujah he was alone but he wasn't he had an angel with him hallelujah yes he was alone interpreting at Belshazzar's feast when he interpreted the handwriting on the wall all the other guys died but he didn't die because he wasn't alone God was with him amen Jesus told brother Branham in 1960 he had to walk with him to walk with him he'd have to walk alone in other words without the influence from organizations brother Brahim still had fellowship with brother Neville all the brothers around the tabernacle Higginbottom all the brothers brother cons all the brothers you can name all those names he still went hunting all the time with them but see he had to live alone he had to be separate from the influence that any influence that wasn't from the Lord Jesus Christ he stood on fellowship he still travel TCI fellowship with Billy Paul he travel with him all the time all around the world but it says he wasn't saying well you can't fellowship with anybody he was saying you can only be influenced by the Holy Spirit amen and so church but I want to apply this to or better than one because you even if you're alone even if whoever's alone you still walk with the Holy Spirit because you're never really alone praise God that's right honestly think about it you're either you're either with Devils or you're with the Holy Spirit even if people separate themselves from all the humans they either got a bunch of Devils around them or they got the Holy Ghost around them I mean they're no one's ever really alone so see Solomon's just looking at the natural and he's not focusing on the spiritual of course it wasn't open at that point st. Paul was single as whole life and he said yet there's a crown of righteousness waiting for him praise God because he wasn't alone two are better than one hallelujah Jesus stood alone he never married but no one could live a better life than Jesus Christ so again we see two are better than one the body of Jesus had the Eternal Spirit of the Father amen he was never alone except on the cross right the only time he was alone was on the cross he did it for you and I thank God so again these are the opinions of Solomon these are not thus saith the Lord statements these are observations you and I are never alone we are always standing with Christ hallelujah now interesting now in verses 9 through 12 this is all about friendship or marriage isn't it I want you to notice this is a good I found this from the commentary this commentary named Holman he said notice friendship was never called vanity in Ecclesiastes all these other things are called vanity work line women all these all these superficial things are called vanity but friendship has never called vanity that's because friendship is eternal praise the Lord I think it was Jose sent me text Oh today he said I said I appreciate your friendship he said he said brother our friendship is eternal I said you're right about that brother Brooke sent me a text this week and said I love you he said it's a eternal love friendship has never called vanity in the cleese yesyes because it is eternal man when you have a crap friend that's a Christian that friendship always be a eternal friendship it'll never end our friendship will never end brother bang I hope you don't want to end it hope I meant a good friend to you it'll never end you never end because it's eternal it's not vain it's not vanity there's value behind it because it's the love of God two are better than one and thank God Christ is always with us you see the Bible is even accurate with that friendship cannot be vain it's not vain there's always lasting value anything I can do for you or anything you can do for me is it there's an eternal blessing attached to that there's some there's some reward you'll get if even giving a glass of cold water in the name of an apostle not even the name of Jesus well I just give this to you because you know you follow brother branham's message that gets a reward I don't know if it gets eternal life but Jesus said it gets the report but jesus said when you've done it unto one of the least of these my brother and then you've done it unto me to see friendship is eternal how many want more friends now I want more friends because hopefully if they're good to me they can if they don't believe the way I do maybe God will give me turn of life amen because friendship is very very valuable it's not vanity extremely valuable I'm perfect I got one minute left for my half-hour sermon verse 13 through 16 this closes chapter 4 I love the Bible this Bible was so powerful right for out of prison I'm sorry verse 13 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished and we see that this morning if somebody's got to evil spirit on them and they can't humble themselves it'd be better to just be a poor old or poor little child than be an old king who can't be corrected by the Word of God because this guy's he got all the resources but he's never gonna do nothing for God because got the evil spirit on him man verse 14 for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is born in his kingdom B cometh poor I considered all the living which walk under the Sun with a second child that shall stand up instead there is no end of all the people even of all that had been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this is also vanity and vexation of spirit praise God let's say into our feet here I'm gonna stop right there it'd be better to be a poor little child with wisdom because you have a future you have at least a possibility to reign you can actually grow you can actually do something right but an old king who can't be corrected he's stubborn he's got a evil spirit on him he'll be an awful ruler and he'll make his kingdom poor he'll drive his kingdom right into the ground just like pastors I get a get a complex they can drive their church right down to the ground right we've all seen it I don't want to do that if you see a complex on me please let me know I don't want to I don't want to be the spot where I can't be taught and I can't learn any more I don't want to drive this into the ground I want to drive us up to heaven praise God I'm gonna ride the Holy Spirit I want to ride it like brother man said I'm riding it I'm riding it I want to ride it all up to heaven praise God an old king or a person who can't be corrected doesn't pay attention to warning signs I'll never see God warning him but even though a youthful king is successful for a time and pleases the crowd he to eventually get old lose touch and be abandoned political power and popularity are fleeting right we see it all the time with politics oh they're all happy for Obama and they're all happy for Trump well tell me what's really changed has anybody ever got closer to Jesus probably not they keep breaking the word to keep great more laws or doing more evil to see those things are all fleeting it's the person who can be corrected in the wisdom of God because remember wisdom is more valuable than anything else we can possibly imagine just the wisdom what is the what is the Bible choice what kind of person do I want to be what kind of friends should I be what choice should I make now what choice should I make there when we choose wizz it's more valuable than any financial blessing we could have the wisdom of God now I want you come here praise the Lord aren't you glad you're not standing alone tonight twos better than one tonight but we got a lot more than to hear all the adults agree how many agree that Jesus
