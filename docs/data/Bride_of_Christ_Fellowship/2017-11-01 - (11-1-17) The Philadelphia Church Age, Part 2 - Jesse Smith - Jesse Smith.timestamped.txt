[45:35] and the church said amen god bless you B
[45:38] and C the praise God
[45:39] [Music]
[45:43] take this little thought here tonight
[45:45] and look at the Philadelphia Church age
[45:49] part 2 now a I do have some quotes and
[45:52] some scriptures I want to show so
[45:54] whenever you're ready buddy you can
[45:55] switch over by God's grace I just find
[46:00] you know if we go scripture by scripture
[46:01] it's nice when you can
[46:03] there's my stopping point you can see
[46:05] that it's got a few slides here by God's
[46:08] grace amen okay so let's look at tonight
[46:13] here this is the sixth letter Jesus
[46:16] wrote or had John write to the Gentile
[46:18] cities this to the Philadelphia Church
[46:20] age and we know it lasted from 1750 to
[46:24] 1906 we know that because God gave his
[46:27] prophet thus saith the Lord and gave it
[46:30] to us and we're grateful for thus saith
[46:32] the Lord aren't you grateful for thus
[46:33] saith the Lord praise God and so we
[46:35] thank the Lord for that so we just read
[46:39] one verse now there's well this is a
[46:41] very deep topic a very deep topic but
[46:43] just again to remind you from last week
[46:45] here we are were in the sixth Church
[46:47] gauge going down through the history
[46:49] John Wesley was the messenger the aged
[46:52] lasted 156 years the main battle of the
[46:54] day was battling the synagogue of Satan
[46:57] according to Jesus and the anointing
[47:00] that they were battling over the Anti
[47:02] Christ anointing was a black anointing
[47:05] because it was the carryover from the
[47:06] dark ages where we hate to say it hate
[47:10] to call names but we have to because the
[47:13] Bible calls the Roman Catholic Church
[47:14] the mother harlot we have to call that
[47:17] and we're not attacking the people it's
[47:20] the spirit behind the people it's the
[47:23] system because that woman sits on seven
[47:25] hills and the only city that sits on
[47:27] seven hills that has control over kings
[47:29] and monarchs and nations is the Roman
[47:31] Catholic Church so
[47:33] they started capturing the wealth of the
[47:34] world around a thousand AD by the
[47:37] indulgences a--'s and the sales of
[47:38] indulgences and Crusades and so forth
[47:41] and wars of conquest
[47:42] that's just plain history anybody can
[47:44] prove that just by reading the
[47:46] Britannica as we have we've already
[47:48] preached that but just giving you an
[47:51] idea so this is what the church was
[47:52] still battling this Antichrist spirit
[47:54] now we've already completed last week we
[47:59] started with the summary we looked at
[48:01] the summary this is the age of the open
[48:02] door this was a great missionary age of
[48:04] course of the Reformation which
[48:06] yesterday was the 500th anniversary I
[48:08] don't remember that the 500th
[48:10] anniversary of Martin Luther nailing the
[48:12] 95 thesis on that church door in
[48:15] Wittenberg there 500 years yesterday by
[48:18] God's grace amen that's the real that
[48:20] was the real holiday yesterday most of
[48:21] the world was into paganism but the real
[48:23] believer had a real holiday yesterday
[48:25] praise God and let me tell you - the the
[48:29] the protesting is still on how many know
[48:31] that by God's grace we're still
[48:33] protesting the Pope's Authority because
[48:35] Christ never gave them that authority
[48:37] it's not again it's not to attack an
[48:39] individual I'm not judging their eternal
[48:42] destination only God knows but we are
[48:43] judging the false doctrine we are
[48:46] judging the evil spirits behind that
[48:49] that produce you know celibacy amongst
[48:52] priests and worship to marry and I idol
[48:55] worship of idols we are attacking those
[48:57] evil spirits we are judging those
[48:58] spirits we have to because jesus said we
[49:01] must judge every tree by its fruit we
[49:04] must do that and so we looked at the
[49:06] city we looked at Philadelphia the Asian
[49:10] City there the the second greatest city
[49:12] of that part of it was called Lydia that
[49:15] part of the country of Turkey modern-day
[49:17] Turkey we looked at the age and the
[49:19] messenger how many were blessed last
[49:22] week by that I just was so blessed here
[49:25] I just want to bring a few reminders
[49:26] remember John Wesley just two reminders
[49:30] he had methods for sanctification before
[49:33] he was saved and then after he got saved
[49:36] remember he was quite a story he thought
[49:38] he was saved for you know this whole
[49:40] part of his life he went to seminary but
[49:42] then at 35 years old he realized I went
[49:44] over to save the Indians who's going to
[49:46] save me and then he got saved by
[49:49] listening to martin luther's a reading
[49:51] of Martin Luther's preaching at 35 years
[49:53] old he was born again but then he made
[49:55] more methods to say to say sanctified
[49:58] huh me no st. Paul did the same thing
[50:00] let's turn in your Bibles let's go to
[50:02] first Corinthians 9 st. Paul did the
[50:04] same thing
[50:05] Paul was that just struck me my that's
[50:07] inspiration of the Holy Spirit there
[50:08] amen Paul did the same thing before he
[50:10] was say remember what was he a Pharisee
[50:12] of Pharisees even before Paul was saved
[50:15] he knew I've got to I've got to take
[50:16] measures to keep my body from
[50:18] controlling me I've got to control my
[50:20] body right in order to live a holy life
[50:23] Paul did the same thing Paul was
[50:25] Pharisees of Pharisees but after
[50:27] becoming a Christian he realized I still
[50:29] got to keep my body under subjection to
[50:33] the Holy Spirit all right let's go to
[50:36] verse 24 this is the great illusion he
[50:39] gives to the Corinthians member the city
[50:41] of Corinth was close to Athens and
[50:43] Athens is where they had the Olympics
[50:44] and all these athletic events so Paul
[50:47] writes this in something that they would
[50:49] understand he tries to relate the gospel
[50:52] in a way that they'll understand like
[50:53] today people might use the illustration
[50:55] of basketball to talk about Christ or
[50:57] football to talk about Christ because
[50:59] that's what you know they would
[51:00] understand so Paul does the same thing
[51:02] in verse 24 know ye not that they which
[51:04] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[51:07] the price so run that you may obtain and
[51:11] every man that striveth for the mastery
[51:13] is temperate in all things now they do
[51:19] it to obtain a corruptible crown but we
[51:21] an incorruptible I therefore so run not
[51:24] as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[51:28] that beateth the air but I keep my body
[51:30] and I bring it under subjection now
[51:32] listen right here last that by any means
[51:35] when i have preached to others i myself
[51:37] should be a castaway amen so see in
[51:41] other words i've got to control my
[51:42] desires of my flesh so that I don't get
[51:46] pull away from the gospel just because
[51:49] I'm feeding my flesh now you see it
[51:51] today we talked about it tonight with
[51:53] money a lot of times money pulls people
[51:55] away fancy cars big planes
[51:59] big mansions big churches money will
[52:02] sometimes pull people away right just
[52:05] like with Judas had pulled him away
[52:06] sometimes it's family or relationships
[52:09] when you see broken marriages broken
[52:10] homes and adulteries you know in
[52:12] churches sometimes it's relationships
[52:15] that pull people wait but Paul says I'm
[52:17] gonna keep my body under subjection that
[52:20] I will not be a castaway so see the same
[52:23] thing with John Wesley he realizes after
[52:26] I got saved I got to make sure my body
[52:28] doesn't take over a lot of people today
[52:31] in America its food food becomes an idol
[52:33] they just feed their bodies and they and
[52:35] they forget that we have to fast right
[52:37] because we know fasting is a spiritual
[52:40] feast we have so many natural feasts we
[52:42] have so many fellowships we need to have
[52:44] more spiritual feasts and that's fasting
[52:47] and not eating like we did like I asked
[52:49] you to do last Friday asked you to fast
[52:51] last are to ask you to fast that this
[52:54] third grader at our school won't have
[52:55] cancer anymore so please if you haven't
[52:57] fasted please fast tomorrow by God's
[52:59] grace now John's nature fit his calling
[53:03] he was he said I never remembered 15
[53:05] minutes out of an hour when I was
[53:06] depressed and yet he preached sometimes
[53:09] up to 800 sermons a year that's what
[53:11] history says about this man what a man
[53:13] now Susanna Wesley she was a prayer
[53:16] warrior she had 19 children but nine of
[53:19] them died she outlived many of her
[53:23] children and but she fully accepted she
[53:26] looked at her children and said these
[53:27] children are my talents from God so she
[53:30] went to extra lengths for them to hear
[53:31] the truth remember that when her husband
[53:33] was out fighting against heresies and
[53:37] others churches and the preachers
[53:39] weren't preaching the truth on Sundays
[53:41] on Sunday afternoon she would take her
[53:43] children and read her husband's sermon
[53:45] notes that's how much she loved God amen
[53:47] in other words if she didn't get fed at
[53:50] church he's gonna make sure that
[53:51] children got fed at home that's our real
[53:53] mother right there that's a real father
[53:55] if you're not getting that church you
[53:57] better make sure you get it at home
[53:58] there'll be no excuses on the day of
[54:00] judgment I with me church I'm sorry to
[54:02] feel chilly maybe I'm getting it up here
[54:05] but anyways I better preach harder than
[54:07] I warm up by God's grace but I don't
[54:09] want to freeze the church what I mean is
[54:11] I don't want you to be freezing
[54:12] I don't want you to be cold so see she
[54:16] went to extra lengths and we got to go
[54:18] to every length we can to make sure we
[54:20] have the truth of God's Word now she
[54:22] also met with her children individually
[54:24] for counsel and training and that's
[54:26] something I'm praying about you know
[54:28] I've got six kids now but Susana and
[54:30] Wesley would meet with one child every
[54:31] night and have a little meeting with
[54:34] them a short counseling and training to
[54:36] answer their questions and so forth
[54:37] that's one thing I'm considering doing
[54:39] by God's grace we like to do that my
[54:42] wife and I get a lot of time to talk to
[54:43] the kids though we appreciate that and
[54:45] but that's something that that she
[54:47] modeled a member her son Charles Wesley
[54:49] wrote 6,000 hymns and her and her other
[54:53] son John was the messenger to the aged
[54:55] preached thousands upon thousands of
[54:58] sermons want winning thousands of
[55:00] thousands upon souls so we make sure we
[55:03] gotta get the Word of God and we got to
[55:05] be dedicated to the Word of God that's
[55:07] real dedication right there now I'm
[55:10] gonna take the next part of this sermon
[55:12] here tonight and I'm gonna hit some
[55:16] highlights from the sermon that our
[55:19] prophet preached on December 10th 1960
[55:22] on the Philadelphia Church age so I'm
[55:25] gonna bring out some thoughts but I'm
[55:27] first going to show you the outline of
[55:28] the sermon so you're aware of it and I
[55:31] rotated the colors this I thought this
[55:33] would help you see a little better he
[55:35] starts off for the first few minutes
[55:36] with the age the messenger in the
[55:38] summary of the Philadelphia Church age
[55:39] and then he reviews the previous ages
[55:42] for about seven minutes and then he gave
[55:44] more history on John Wesley for about
[55:46] four minutes and then he preached on the
[55:50] open door the missionary age and power
[55:51] and not in word only that was almost 23
[55:55] minutes there then he preached on Jesus
[55:58] is the open door Jesus is God the name
[56:01] of Jesus and the Holy Ghost covenant for
[56:03] about 22 more minutes and then he
[56:06] preached on the supreme deity of Jesus
[56:09] Christ and the key of David for about
[56:11] five minutes and then he preached then
[56:13] he got down to the individual attributes
[56:16] of the church age the little strength
[56:18] that Jesus said they had the deity again
[56:21] in the name of Christ and water baptism
[56:23] and then he preached on the synagogue of
[56:26] satan'
[56:26] Jesus mentioned and then he preached on
[56:29] the hour temptation the crown reward the
[56:32] pillar reward and the new name reward
[56:34] and then they sang and did the closing
[56:36] for a few minutes that for that so if
[56:39] you haven't listened that has anybody
[56:41] who gone back and listened to the
[56:42] Philadelphia Church age nobody okay if
[56:44] you you might want to do that I'm gonna
[56:46] probably preach on this on Sunday by
[56:47] God's grace to give you some good
[56:49] background on that so tonight I'm gonna
[56:54] look at some important quotes from this
[56:55] sermon here so let's let's look at this
[56:58] quotation now the first quote that
[57:00] struck me was being in the right
[57:01] condition we must be in the right
[57:04] condition for the Holy Spirit to move
[57:05] now here's a little mention at the
[57:07] beginning of the message so we approach
[57:09] in Jesus name tonight asking that you'll
[57:11] bless us as we congregate ourselves army
[57:16] together to study the word and to know
[57:20] what you have for us in store for
[57:22] tonight that we might build up our
[57:24] spiritual bodies to a lively church now
[57:27] look at this a church where you could
[57:29] live and walk in and feel comfortable
[57:31] walking among your people telling us
[57:34] what to do and know that we do it right
[57:37] away how many want to be a church like
[57:39] that where Jesus could give us some
[57:41] instruction and then we do it right now
[57:43] we wouldn't put it off till next week we
[57:46] wouldn't put it off till next year we do
[57:48] it tonight by God's grace look at his
[57:50] next thought here and we love you Father
[57:54] but we know we're not quite in condition
[57:58] yet that you could speak through us
[58:00] just like you wish to isn't that quite a
[58:04] statement
[58:04] he recognizes we're not in the condition
[58:07] yet where you could just speak through
[58:09] us and then you ask for a fresh
[58:12] circumcision of the Holy Spirit cut away
[58:15] all the foolishness I'd say that I'd say
[58:17] amen to that tonight god help us to get
[58:19] all the foolishness out of our lives
[58:21] presenting foolish you shouldn't be
[58:23] doing that get it out of our lives so
[58:25] God can speak through us and I'm gonna
[58:28] skip past that one
[58:30] now I'm gonna skip ahead a couple years
[58:33] here yeah three years and then the
[58:36] Prophet preached this sermon called
[58:38] perfect faith from James chapter 2
[58:40] and I want to read this he has a long
[58:43] prayer line and he's encouraging the
[58:46] people to have faith and at the end of
[58:48] the prayer line he says now we're coming
[58:50] into the third pole which is the final
[58:52] move of the Holy Spirit before the
[58:53] rapture the Bible tells us that it's the
[58:55] call the latter rain in the Joel chapter
[58:57] 2 it's the latter rain he says I want to
[59:00] ask you sincere question you that pass
[59:02] through the prayer line can you actually
[59:04] believe and feel now that there's
[59:06] something happened to you since you've
[59:08] had hands laid on you
[59:10] he said raise your hand there it is this
[59:12] is just what we've waited for this is
[59:15] just starting to bloom now I did this
[59:17] for a purpose I'm working out something
[59:19] see it's taking this charge of faith and
[59:22] going right back to begin and come in
[59:25] see the kind of raised faith in a
[59:28] bracket where you've never noticed it
[59:30] that way before not a faith but a
[59:33] perfect faith and building up in here
[59:35] amen
[59:36] look at this and watch a perfect God
[59:40] with a perfect heart keep a perfect
[59:42] promise by His perfect word which is
[59:45] sharper than a two-edged sword and a
[59:47] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[59:48] the heart
[59:49] he says we're coming now to perfection
[59:51] because the people has to come to this
[59:53] in order for the rapture that's what's
[59:56] holding it away right now is waiting for
[59:58] that church to come to that perfect
[1:00:00] raptured faith looking for it now look
[1:00:02] it means a lot of shaving down for me it
[1:00:05] means a lot for you but together we'll
[1:00:07] make it by the grace of God so I want to
[1:00:10] bring out these two quotes because in
[1:00:12] 1960 he can say we're not in condition
[1:00:14] two for you to speak to us and now three
[1:00:17] years later he said we're getting into
[1:00:19] rapture and condition amen so see Church
[1:00:22] well I bring this out because we want to
[1:00:24] look at our lives and say em is my life
[1:00:27] getting more in a raptured condition now
[1:00:29] than it was last year praise God
[1:00:31] there's my life if I look back three
[1:00:33] years ago is my life more holy or is it
[1:00:36] more relaxed our lives should be more
[1:00:39] holy by the grace of God we should see
[1:00:41] our lives turning more like Christian
[1:00:43] lives right more and more than the image
[1:00:45] of Christ but it requires a great
[1:00:47] shaving down praise God it requires more
[1:00:50] of a sanctification
[1:00:53] I don't know if you've seen this quote
[1:00:54] before but I don't know if this is
[1:00:56] prophecy or not but I just want to read
[1:00:58] this quote from July of 63 now the
[1:01:02] Prophet said don't forget this
[1:01:04] Tabernacle will lose its strength and he
[1:01:09] shows how they're gonna lose their
[1:01:10] strength Satan had every gun in Hell
[1:01:12] trained on it he'll cause one person to
[1:01:15] do something that's contrary to what the
[1:01:17] other thinks he said that Satan's
[1:01:19] business if you can get somebody to say
[1:01:21] something and talk about somebody else
[1:01:23] and say well listen did you know
[1:01:24] so-and-so did this don't listen to it
[1:01:27] don't listen to it at all that's the
[1:01:28] devil see it's Satan don't believe it
[1:01:31] in other words gossip will weaken a
[1:01:33] church praise the Lord gossip will
[1:01:37] weaken a church that's how Satan comes
[1:01:39] in real suddenly real innocently
[1:01:41] and he says the tabernacle will lose its
[1:01:43] strength so it had strength so much so
[1:01:46] he said I see people accepting their
[1:01:48] healing right in the prayer line I see
[1:01:50] people with rapturing faith moving upon
[1:01:52] their hearts and this is almost over 50
[1:01:54] years ago and he sees it but he said
[1:01:57] it's going to lose its strength
[1:02:00] now we must watch what we say with our
[1:02:04] words I'm going to say help me Jesus
[1:02:05] with my words help me not to gossip
[1:02:08] about anybody in church help me to say
[1:02:10] only what's right about other people
[1:02:12] you see if not we're gonna lose our
[1:02:14] strength spiritually and and if you know
[1:02:18] for our sister Connie and I preached a
[1:02:19] message last year about the move in
[1:02:22] Jeffersonville because there's there's a
[1:02:24] lot of censor people but I believe
[1:02:26] what's happened is they got a false
[1:02:28] doctrine where it says pastors shouldn't
[1:02:30] preach anymore and that's I believe
[1:02:32] that's a false doctrine I preached a
[1:02:33] whole sermon on that and but we love
[1:02:37] them you know we love them I've talked
[1:02:38] to different people from that church and
[1:02:40] really really wonderful people but any
[1:02:44] spirit that denies the Word of God is
[1:02:46] the wrong spirit and when that spirit
[1:02:50] says pastors don't preach anymore yet
[1:02:52] the Bible says preach until everybody
[1:02:53] gets perfected
[1:02:54] something's wrong with that spirit right
[1:02:56] and the Holy Spirit will pick that up
[1:02:58] right away because the Holy Spirit is
[1:03:00] the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:03:01] intents of the heart
[1:03:03] but see the Wheatley says they're gonna
[1:03:05] lose their strength because the gosh
[1:03:07] and they're gonna fall away a little bit
[1:03:09] from their strength so we must turn
[1:03:12] Satan down now I got a thought here I
[1:03:14] want to bring out here the next thought
[1:03:17] is overlapping of the ages again this is
[1:03:19] pretty deep you know so sister Danny I
[1:03:21] apologize this is a really deep message
[1:03:23] I know it's really really deep we were
[1:03:25] talking about some deep scriptures to
[1:03:27] remember that we're talking about the
[1:03:28] Queen of Sheba and and the men of
[1:03:31] Nineveh and how they raised up in
[1:03:32] judgment against Jesus's generation you
[1:03:34] know the Pharisees but this is a really
[1:03:36] deep thought right here but I hope you
[1:03:38] can catch it by God's grace and I'm what
[1:03:43] I'm gonna do is I'm just going to skip
[1:03:45] because of time I'm gonna skip just to
[1:03:48] the Vitter to the visual and let's look
[1:03:53] in your Bible so now let's take our
[1:03:54] Bibles let's go back to revelation 3 I
[1:03:56] think I just I'm feeling like I need to
[1:03:58] go back there revelation 3:10 now we
[1:04:01] read verse 7 but let's go to verse 10 I
[1:04:04] think it'd just be better if I just flip
[1:04:07] flip ahead here and show how the ages
[1:04:11] overlap okay I just want to do that I
[1:04:21] think the
[1:04:22] to show it might be right here I think
[1:04:25] this might be the best way now remember
[1:04:27] we're preaching on the Philadelphia
[1:04:28] Church age but revelation 3 verse 11
[1:04:33] Jesus spoke to this word to this church
[1:04:36] age
[1:04:37] but the word was actually going to be
[1:04:38] fulfilled in the next age which shows
[1:04:41] the influence of the ages overlap and I
[1:04:43] have a Bible example but I want to just
[1:04:46] go over this one first
[1:04:48] so revelation 3 verse 10 what any we
[1:04:51] like to read that for me tonight by
[1:04:52] God's grace
[1:04:52] Adam okay thank you sir amen so in this
[1:05:12] Philadelphia Church age in verse 10
[1:05:14] Jesus says if you keep my word I'm gonna
[1:05:18] keep you from the hour temptation that
[1:05:20] will come upon the whole earth now
[1:05:22] that's in Revelation 13 so let's go to
[1:05:24] that the hour of temptation is where
[1:05:27] everybody is forced to take the mark of
[1:05:29] the beast or die
[1:05:30] that's what Jesus is speaking of
[1:05:32] revelation 13 now let's just read a
[1:05:35] verse verse 15 revelation 13:15 so this
[1:05:41] scripture shows there's a little bit of
[1:05:43] overlap Jesus warns this age about it
[1:05:45] but it actually overlaps to the next age
[1:05:48] so Jesus is preparing the future
[1:05:52] generations for the time of the
[1:05:54] Tribulation Period and if you listen to
[1:05:58] this message the Philadelphia Church age
[1:06:00] you'll hear him say lap over over lap
[1:06:02] lap over lap over over and over again
[1:06:04] and so I want to bring that thought so
[1:06:06] you're clear on it all right
[1:06:11] yes revelation 3:15 and he had power to
[1:06:14] give life under the image of the Beast
[1:06:15] that image of the Beast should both
[1:06:18] speak and cause that as many as would
[1:06:20] not worship the image of the Beast
[1:06:22] should be killed remember what is the
[1:06:24] Beast the Beast is the spirit of Rome
[1:06:27] that is the Beast because daniel said
[1:06:29] there's four beasts and Daniel said that
[1:06:31] last beast that beast that that stands
[1:06:35] there all the way
[1:06:36] the end time was iron and clay and we
[1:06:38] know that was turned out to be the Roman
[1:06:40] Catholic Church and the Protestant
[1:06:42] churches that are apostate so this has
[1:06:45] to be the spirit of Rome the beast is
[1:06:48] the spirit of Rome now verse 16 and he
[1:06:52] causes all both small and great rich and
[1:06:54] poor free and bond to receive a mark in
[1:06:56] their right hand or in their foreheads
[1:06:58] and that no man might buy or sell save
[1:07:00] the mark or the name of the beast or the
[1:07:03] number of his name here in his wisdom
[1:07:05] let him that hath understanding count
[1:07:07] the number of the beast for it is the
[1:07:09] number of a man and his number is six
[1:07:11] hundred threescore and six
[1:07:14] so we know the number of 666 is the
[1:07:16] number of the Pope because his Latin
[1:07:18] title is vicarious filet de in Latin and
[1:07:22] if you add up all those Roman numerals
[1:07:24] it's 666 and the Bible said that the
[1:07:26] Pope or the Antichrist sits in the
[1:07:29] temple of God exalting himself all
[1:07:31] that's above God all that's called God
[1:07:33] he sits above that and the Pope does the
[1:07:36] same today he everything he says it
[1:07:38] doesn't matter what the Bible says it's
[1:07:39] what he says so we know that's going to
[1:07:41] happen so Jesus was speaking of this
[1:07:43] time at the tribulation he says if you
[1:07:46] keep my word
[1:07:47] I'll keep you from the hour of
[1:07:49] temptation now just I just added a few
[1:07:51] life times in here so there's Luther
[1:07:54] that's what Martin Luther which yes
[1:07:56] yesterday was the 500 anniversary of
[1:07:58] Reformation there's John Wesley's life
[1:08:01] this is the life we're talking about now
[1:08:02] his life overlapped the age a little bit
[1:08:05] and then our prophet we believe was
[1:08:08] William Branham he was vindicated by God
[1:08:10] he had prophecies that came to pass a
[1:08:12] genuine prophet of God now here's where
[1:08:15] Jesus said the hour temptation now I
[1:08:18] hope everybody gets this Benjamin god
[1:08:20] bless you sir nice to see you
[1:08:22] Jesus set it to the Philadelphia Church
[1:08:24] age but it actually applied to the next
[1:08:27] age can everybody see that there's an
[1:08:31] overlap so that great temptation didn't
[1:08:35] happen in the Philadelphia Church age
[1:08:36] it's going to happen sometime soon in
[1:08:38] the future no man knows the day or the
[1:08:41] hour but we know the tribulation is
[1:08:43] coming amen
[1:08:43] this nation is ripe for judgment right
[1:08:47] it's right for judgment all the
[1:08:48] abortions
[1:08:49] all the homosexual and legalized sin all
[1:08:52] this legalized sin if God doesn't
[1:08:54] destroy this nation for all its legalize
[1:08:56] sin it's gonna have to raise up sila and
[1:08:58] gomorrah and apologize that right so
[1:09:02] this nation is under judgment so the our
[1:09:04] temptation is to come so i wanted you to
[1:09:06] see the overlap that we're talking about
[1:09:09] does everybody understand
[1:09:10] so there's overlap overlap sometimes
[1:09:13] Jesus speak a word but it'll overlap
[1:09:15] into the next age it'll overlap into the
[1:09:17] next generation we see that by the grace
[1:09:20] of the Lord now this might be a review
[1:09:23] for you too there's an overlap here with
[1:09:26] Colombia I preached on this a few months
[1:09:28] ago Colombo was the messenger to the
[1:09:30] fire to your church age but he actually
[1:09:32] lived before the church age started so
[1:09:35] see that shows another lap over his
[1:09:37] message and ministry finish but it
[1:09:39] lapped over into the age that he was the
[1:09:42] messenger for and remember he converted
[1:09:45] the entire nation of Ireland praise God
[1:09:49] entire nation
[1:09:50] this man was such a mighty man of God
[1:09:52] people flocked to hear his preaching
[1:09:54] they became Christians and they started
[1:09:56] churches all over Ireland amen all
[1:09:58] because of a man who's on fire
[1:10:00] hallelujah amen now here's the example
[1:10:03] of a lap over in acts 19 let's go to
[1:10:06] acts 19 verse 1 here's a good Bible
[1:10:10] example of a lap over X 19 1 and maybe I
[1:10:16] have some more readers Malachi we'd like
[1:10:18] to read a little bit for me Lydia would
[1:10:20] you like okay now all right
[1:10:23] Benjamin okay Malachi why don't you read
[1:10:25] verses 1 2 & 3 all right pause right
[1:10:50] there so here's a lap over these
[1:10:52] Christians were in Ephesus and they're
[1:10:55] living from the previous of John the
[1:10:59] Baptist which was just a few years
[1:11:00] beforehand but God had already entered
[1:11:03] into another covenant which was the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost covenant amen John the Baptist
[1:11:07] only baptized for repentance he said but
[1:11:10] ones coming after me who will baptize
[1:11:12] you with the Holy Ghost and fire a man
[1:11:14] that's exactly right so John's baptism
[1:11:16] just lasted a few years but it
[1:11:18] overlapped into the next ministry which
[1:11:21] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] ministry praise God and now Benjamin can
[1:11:26] you read why don't you read four and
[1:11:28] five sir
[1:11:42] amen so can everybody see that they were
[1:11:44] under the previous baptism now John was
[1:11:47] just baptizing he just said confess your
[1:11:49] sins I'm gonna baptize you that's all it
[1:11:51] was which was a great thing is it
[1:11:53] repentance a great thing how that it's
[1:11:55] great to find someone that will truly
[1:11:56] repent of their sins it's hard to find
[1:11:59] cuz Jesus said few there be that find
[1:12:00] that way it's the way of repentance and
[1:12:03] repentance means turning 180 degrees and
[1:12:06] not walking into sin anymore it's hard
[1:12:08] to find that but real believers have
[1:12:09] that praise God amen
[1:12:11] okay but this baptism that was just
[1:12:15] John's baptism this baptism was to get
[1:12:18] filled with Christ fill what the Holy
[1:12:19] Ghost its Christ in you the hope of
[1:12:22] glory
[1:12:22] this was the mystery that got a kept
[1:12:25] secret for 4,000 years praise God that
[1:12:28] was the mystery right because God dwelt
[1:12:31] with his people but he wanted to be in
[1:12:33] the people praise God holiday he dwelt
[1:12:35] with Adam and Eve but he wanted to be he
[1:12:37] couldn't be in them yet he dwelt with
[1:12:38] John the Baptist but he couldn't be in
[1:12:40] him but then he come to Pentecost the
[1:12:41] day of Pentecost and now God was in them
[1:12:44] praise God it was God in His creation
[1:12:46] praise God now they're filled with the
[1:12:48] Holy Ghost praise God
[1:12:50] that's exactly right now so John's
[1:12:54] baptism was no longer in effect once the
[1:12:57] Holy Ghost had been given they were
[1:12:58] living under it but God blessed the
[1:13:01] Ephesians with genuine sanctification
[1:13:03] under the truth of the previous age the
[1:13:06] ministries left over a bit but see God
[1:13:08] will honor anybody who sincerely
[1:13:10] receives the ministry that's brought to
[1:13:12] you that's the thing to do church if we
[1:13:15] can be that since here tonight I'll live
[1:13:16] everything I know God will bless us amen
[1:13:19] if we can live everything that we know
[1:13:21] if we can live everything that we heard
[1:13:23] God will bless us until we hear more
[1:13:25] amen until we hear more of the word that
[1:13:28] we need to hear praise God it's exactly
[1:13:30] right so see they laugh over but God
[1:13:33] always sends the true word to the people
[1:13:37] who want it by God's grace see these
[1:13:39] people wanted more of God so God could
[1:13:41] send it now Church this is why I believe
[1:13:44] this is why I believe you can only be
[1:13:46] born again by hearing the message of the
[1:13:48] hour is every with me they were
[1:13:52] defied the Ephesians were sanctified but
[1:13:55] they couldn't get the Holy Ghost until
[1:13:57] somebody came preaching the true message
[1:13:58] of the hour amen
[1:14:00] how you gonna be born again in a
[1:14:02] denomination don't even believe in the
[1:14:04] Holy Ghost you can't you gotta be born
[1:14:06] again in a church that believes in the
[1:14:08] power of God that believes in the
[1:14:10] filling of the Holy Spirit you have to
[1:14:12] be in a church that preaches that they
[1:14:14] could never live any higher than the
[1:14:16] preaching that they heard me the same
[1:14:18] way it is for us today
[1:14:19] if we went live higher we got to hear
[1:14:21] higher preaching praise the Lord if you
[1:14:24] want to live higher you got to hear
[1:14:25] higher preaching right you got to bring
[1:14:27] your body into subjection we got a live
[1:14:29] higher in Christ Jesus amen exactly
[1:14:33] right now this might be my last few
[1:14:36] thoughts here I got 30 minutes so I'll
[1:14:40] try to finish up I'd like I said I tried
[1:14:41] do an hour here I got some more thoughts
[1:14:44] I want to bring out and then I got end
[1:14:45] with some scriptures here by the grace
[1:14:48] of the Lord so in this sermon from 1960
[1:14:54] I want to go back to that Philadelphia
[1:14:55] Church age sermon I read this and it
[1:14:58] really blessed me I said last night was
[1:15:01] Martin Luther which we just celebrated
[1:15:02] the reason I'm getting this and the boys
[1:15:05] are putting it on tape talking about
[1:15:06] recording this sermon all day long and
[1:15:09] you say all day long on just what little
[1:15:11] history you give here he says no the
[1:15:14] historical points will go in the book
[1:15:16] see the book of the seven church age and
[1:15:18] I left it at school on my desk today so
[1:15:20] I don't have the book to hold up but
[1:15:22] it's out there if you like a copy the
[1:15:25] reason to get here is to get these
[1:15:26] things pulled out by the inspiration
[1:15:29] from before you people where we gather
[1:15:33] together to get the inspirational part
[1:15:35] of it the history I can read that out of
[1:15:38] the book now I just bring this thought
[1:15:40] out to show you that the Prophet would
[1:15:43] study on the history to have the history
[1:15:44] but he would come on the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] revealing something to him while he's
[1:15:49] preaching the Word of God praise the
[1:15:52] Lord while the Saints are gathered
[1:15:54] believing and worshiping and loving God
[1:15:56] and praying and calling out to heaven we
[1:15:59] could expect the Holy Spirit to reveal
[1:16:01] something fresh to us are you with me
[1:16:03] amen so the same is the
[1:16:06] famous for us tonight if we're really
[1:16:08] loving God and believing God's Word we
[1:16:10] can expect God to reveal something fresh
[1:16:12] to us tonight but we have to meet the
[1:16:15] conditions here he says it again I want
[1:16:19] to read this to you but here's where I'm
[1:16:21] looking for inspiration from that we
[1:16:25] pick it up on the tape we got he said in
[1:16:28] the book then we'll have both the
[1:16:29] historical data of the Philadelphia
[1:16:32] Church age and also the inspiration of
[1:16:34] the Holy Spirit to give us while we're
[1:16:36] together here this heavenly places in
[1:16:39] Christ Jesus I hope you feel like that
[1:16:42] tonight like we're in a heavenly place
[1:16:44] here by God's grace I feel it I don't
[1:16:46] know about you but I feel it I'm at work
[1:16:48] all day or I go to different stores on
[1:16:50] the weekend and I feel dirty in the
[1:16:52] world but when I come here I feel like
[1:16:53] I'm in heaven praise God because this is
[1:16:56] where the worship of Christ is given
[1:16:57] this is where praise and prayers are
[1:17:00] offered this is where his word is
[1:17:01] preached this is where Christ is
[1:17:03] magnified amen this is his house it's a
[1:17:06] house of prayer praise God so see this
[1:17:10] is heavenly places
[1:17:11] and I believe look at this it ought to
[1:17:13] make a striking little commentary on
[1:17:15] these church ages and the Lord grant us
[1:17:17] blessings to it how many feel that way
[1:17:19] about the church age book it's a
[1:17:21] striking little commentary on Revelation
[1:17:23] chapters 1 2 and 3
[1:17:25] absolutely Church absolutely now here's
[1:17:29] what I want to say it for us this is
[1:17:30] what we said about gossiping earlier or
[1:17:32] any-any sin amongst believers the
[1:17:35] Prophet says is if you got a resenting
[1:17:37] audience that means people that don't
[1:17:39] like the preacher are people that don't
[1:17:40] like the piano player people any anyone
[1:17:43] that's upset with anybody here if you
[1:17:45] resent anybody here you'll shut down the
[1:17:47] Holy Spirit see if you got a resenting
[1:17:51] this audience the Holy Spirit won't
[1:17:53] reveal and you know why because
[1:17:55] Ephesians 4:30 let's read that Ephesians
[1:17:57] 4:30 let's read that just so you know
[1:18:00] it's actually scriptural visions for 30
[1:18:03] of course visions for 30
[1:18:11] see the profit when to get inspiration
[1:18:13] while the body of Christ was gathered
[1:18:15] together that's what we want to get we
[1:18:17] want to get inspiration while we're
[1:18:18] gathered here tonight hallelujah and I
[1:18:21] feel like I already got some with that
[1:18:22] the type of Paul and John Wesley they
[1:18:24] both had sanctification before and they
[1:18:26] both got it after a man that wasn't even
[1:18:28] in my notes I was a revelation of the
[1:18:30] Holy Spirit I believe by God's grace and
[1:18:34] what is that for it's so that you and I
[1:18:36] will sanctify our lives the you and I
[1:18:38] will try to live a more sanctified holy
[1:18:40] life hey can the church say Amen that
[1:18:44] means you got a fast that means you got
[1:18:46] to cut out all the foolishness
[1:18:48] you got to see God gonna spend time in
[1:18:51] prayer got to spend time listening to
[1:18:52] the Word of God got to fall in love with
[1:18:54] Jesus all over again that's right that's
[1:18:57] right now Ephesians 4:30 who can read
[1:18:59] that for me by God's grace Adam okay
[1:19:02] back down thank you sir Adam okay so see
[1:19:11] you can be a Christian but then you can
[1:19:13] offend that's what the word grieve means
[1:19:15] you can offend the Holy Spirit and the
[1:19:18] best example is like a little dove right
[1:19:19] a real dove is gentle and sweet and it
[1:19:22] coos and everything like that but if you
[1:19:24] start getting all upset around it what
[1:19:25] does it do it flies away well that's how
[1:19:27] that's how you and I are if we're not
[1:19:29] real sensitive to the Holy Spirit that
[1:19:31] anointing and power just flies away and
[1:19:33] we wonder where's my mind my mind is not
[1:19:35] even on God what what happened we grieve
[1:19:37] the Holy Spirit and that's what happens
[1:19:40] here we come into church and we're upset
[1:19:42] with this person I'm upset with that
[1:19:44] person
[1:19:45] I'm except with the preacher I'm upset
[1:19:47] with the preacher's wife or you can name
[1:19:50] it hey you put your name in there see
[1:19:52] the Holy Spirit won't reveal because
[1:19:55] he's offended and that's absolutely
[1:19:57] scriptures anybody understand you've got
[1:20:01] to have something that working together
[1:20:03] look acts 2 verse 1 they were all in
[1:20:07] what a place in one Accord and then
[1:20:10] there came a sound from heaven rushing
[1:20:12] sea but no matter how much i pray look
[1:20:14] at this i know and lay day and night
[1:20:17] studying and praying before the lord
[1:20:18] walk down here maybe the anointing is on
[1:20:20] me walk up here and feel that resentment
[1:20:23] see it just
[1:20:25] leaves him right away he won't reveal
[1:20:27] nothing how many churches are in that
[1:20:29] condition they're so upset with each
[1:20:32] other they're so upset with somebody
[1:20:33] else that the Holy Spirit can't reveal
[1:20:35] anything to anybody because of spirits
[1:20:38] you see the Bible said you got to cast
[1:20:41] down anything that exalts itself against
[1:20:43] the Word of God it has to be cast down
[1:20:45] we can't hold evil spirits we can't hold
[1:20:48] evil thoughts we got to have our minds
[1:20:50] pure by the Word of God you see that we
[1:20:54] want inspiration we want to come here
[1:20:56] and be inspired
[1:20:57] oh I'm inspired by Susanna Wesley I'm
[1:20:59] inspired by John Wesley well let's see
[1:21:01] it by your life church set that was real
[1:21:04] quiet see we ought to draw inspiration
[1:21:08] this inspiration tonight our last year
[1:21:10] at least tomorrow at least at least
[1:21:13] tonight
[1:21:13] you ought to catch some inspiration
[1:21:16] that'll inspire you to draw closer to
[1:21:18] God tonight if not what what happened
[1:21:21] it's not God it's not God's fault God's
[1:21:23] not trying to keep the inspiration from
[1:21:24] you God's trying to get it to you it's
[1:21:26] us in our own sin is what keeps the
[1:21:28] inspiration away that's true see no
[1:21:34] matter how much a preacher can be
[1:21:35] anointed if we're all not anointed he's
[1:21:37] grieved away and when you walk down here
[1:21:40] under the anointing and feel your
[1:21:41] audience under the anointing that's when
[1:21:43] the Holy Spirit begins to work then and
[1:21:44] then he begins to move and do great
[1:21:46] things for us amen
[1:21:48] hallelujah now here gives another idea
[1:21:52] on it I think we need the Christ yes sir
[1:21:55] only way we see Christ is when he
[1:21:57] reflects in each other
[1:21:58] I see Christ in you you see Christ in me
[1:22:00] that's how we watch Christ I come to the
[1:22:03] meeting
[1:22:03] now here's he's a preacher right he's a
[1:22:05] prophet I start preaching I watch the
[1:22:07] people you can see whether they're
[1:22:09] interested or not in just a few minutes
[1:22:13] see that's what I do I look out and see
[1:22:15] whoa in my heart one who's interested
[1:22:16] who really wants to hear from God or
[1:22:19] who's resenting tonight who's accepting
[1:22:23] who's who's resenting we want to accept
[1:22:25] what the Holy Spirit's a seat your us
[1:22:27] will grieve the Holy Spirit you look
[1:22:29] over the audience you can tell whether
[1:22:32] you're boring them or whether you're not
[1:22:34] Jesus Christ should not bore us we
[1:22:36] should be excited about Christ
[1:22:39] something's wrong if we're not excited
[1:22:40] about the Word of God because we just
[1:22:42] preached a few Sundays ago
[1:22:44] there are unsearchable riches in Christ
[1:22:46] you can't you can't even search it out
[1:22:48] it's so great you'll never get to the
[1:22:49] bottom of it but you've got a desire it
[1:22:51] we've got to believe that how can Jesus
[1:22:54] be boring and the LA Lakers are exciting
[1:22:57] how is that possible heaven and earth
[1:23:00] will pass away the Lakers and the New
[1:23:02] England Patriots will pass away but
[1:23:05] Jesus word will never pass away how can
[1:23:08] that be more exciting than Jesus Christ
[1:23:10] the God of heaven amen
[1:23:13] the king of kings those kings in the
[1:23:16] sports worlds rise and fall Magic
[1:23:18] Johnson gets AIDS and Michael Jordan
[1:23:20] gets old and they rise and fall but
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ is still king of kings and
[1:23:25] Lord of lords whether they like it or
[1:23:27] not see it's it's our attitude church
[1:23:32] it's our attitude but see when you the
[1:23:37] first thing you know when they're
[1:23:38] hanging on every word it's kinda like
[1:23:40] preach to me preacher tell me the Word
[1:23:43] of God tell me about Jesus when you're
[1:23:45] acting like that he says see then I'm
[1:23:48] seeing Christ reflected in the person
[1:23:50] because they're hungry and thirsting for
[1:23:53] God we've got to hunger and thirst for
[1:23:56] God are you with me Oh hallelujah so if
[1:24:00] people are hungry and I'm preaching the
[1:24:01] prophets that see preaching the gospel
[1:24:03] he sees Christ reflecting in me I see
[1:24:06] the Christ reflecting in him that means
[1:24:08] Christ is in our midst then you see that
[1:24:10] when people are hungry for for God and
[1:24:13] are excited about the preaching and I'm
[1:24:15] preaching now we know Christ is here
[1:24:17] because people want to hear about Christ
[1:24:20] they're excited about Christ not about
[1:24:23] money or popularity or all this nonsense
[1:24:26] they're excited about Jesus Christ
[1:24:29] but you've got to reflect it and I've
[1:24:31] got to reflect it we've all got to be a
[1:24:32] part of that and that's when the
[1:24:34] inspiration will come praise the Lord
[1:24:37] it's exactly right
[1:24:38] that's the anointing that's the one
[1:24:40] accord right one in one place in one
[1:24:43] Accord of the Holy Spirit that's right
[1:24:48] now see now
[1:24:49] I say something and watch what effect it
[1:24:53] takes on them I watch their face light
[1:24:55] up full of joy Oh
[1:24:59] preachers like to see that I love to see
[1:25:01] that even when somebody just gets all
[1:25:03] joyful about Jesus amen
[1:25:05] hallelujah like I said the world wants
[1:25:07] us to be joyful about everything else
[1:25:09] but one place we ought to be full of joy
[1:25:11] is in the house of God then they're
[1:25:14] ready right then to receive something
[1:25:16] that's Christ's glory see but your face
[1:25:20] has got to be into you got to you can't
[1:25:22] you can't you can't hide it from God
[1:25:24] right
[1:25:25] Cain left the presence of the Lord the
[1:25:28] Bible said and his countenance changed
[1:25:29] his face changed right but if we stay in
[1:25:32] the presence of Lord like Steven then
[1:25:34] even when he's being stoned he has angel
[1:25:36] face hallelujah and the angel face even
[1:25:40] when he's at death's door why because he
[1:25:42] was so connected to Christ he was so
[1:25:44] reflecting Christ that they saw an angel
[1:25:47] on him amen
[1:25:47] oh god help us to have that anointing
[1:25:49] amen in the midst of our trials people
[1:25:51] will see Christ on our faces our face
[1:25:54] tells the story of the joy that's in our
[1:25:56] heart yes sir
[1:26:00] you see he said I see Christ reflecting
[1:26:02] in that person because the gospel the
[1:26:05] simple gospel of Christ is taking a hold
[1:26:08] in their heart because they're hungry
[1:26:09] and thirsty we got to come to church
[1:26:12] hungry we got to come to church thirsty
[1:26:14] and then we got to accept what God says
[1:26:17] and we got to thank God for what God
[1:26:18] says praise the Lord now this is
[1:26:21] actually scriptural yeah you don't think
[1:26:23] about your Bibles but before Peter Hill
[1:26:26] this paralyzed man he said look on us he
[1:26:29] had to have eye contact did you ever
[1:26:32] notice that in the scripture that
[1:26:34] paralyzed man couldn't be saying okay
[1:26:36] give me some money
[1:26:37] okay preacher whatever he had to look at
[1:26:39] that preacher and they both had to have
[1:26:41] faith in God's Word they had to have a
[1:26:43] cassette this that had to be in one
[1:26:45] Accord that'd be one Accord he said look
[1:26:49] on us and they said silver and gold have
[1:26:50] I none but such as I have give ID in the
[1:26:53] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth he said
[1:26:54] arise and walk praise God and the
[1:26:58] Prophet said this and you know it's true
[1:26:59] the problem is today we got too much
[1:27:01] silver and gold
[1:27:03] we need what Peter had power amen
[1:27:06] hallelujah we need power we don't need
[1:27:09] the silver and gold we need power but
[1:27:11] the world tells us we need more silver
[1:27:12] and gold more money God's God's moving
[1:27:15] is never in money God's Word is always
[1:27:17] in simplicity his power is in humility
[1:27:20] praise God
[1:27:21] humming ourselves hungry for God's Word
[1:27:23] believing God's Word that's all it takes
[1:27:25] is the humble simplicity of a believer
[1:27:27] praise God looking on the the preacher
[1:27:30] looking on the Word of God or looking at
[1:27:32] your Bible or looking in prayer focusing
[1:27:34] on the Word of God and it can literally
[1:27:36] change our lives if we just look at it
[1:27:38] the right way but it's got to be a
[1:27:39] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:27:41] that's right now read this last week
[1:27:46] now I'm gonna skip down here he says
[1:27:50] there are times I like to be all alone
[1:27:52] with my Christ my lord I can tell them
[1:27:54] all my troubles all alone that's what we
[1:27:55] need again then kind of a meetings that
[1:27:57] kind of a church that's the kind of
[1:27:59] church that prays down the blessings of
[1:28:02] God remember what did uh what did Salman
[1:28:06] say said my people were not there
[1:28:07] assembled in what my name if they'll
[1:28:10] humble themselves and call upon God the
[1:28:13] Bible said he'd pour out his spirit and
[1:28:16] he'd heal their land see when we
[1:28:18] assemble here we got a call on the name
[1:28:19] of Jesus we got to pray down the
[1:28:22] blessing Lord send the blessing Lord
[1:28:24] heal the child Lord give her give her
[1:28:26] the unspoken request Lord save souls we
[1:28:29] have to we have to pray the blessings
[1:28:31] down we have to humble ourselves and
[1:28:33] pray a real prayer praise God and not
[1:28:37] just you know Lord bless John Lord bless
[1:28:39] Jesse Lord bless Ben Lord bless amen
[1:28:42] that's not a real prayer we got to pray
[1:28:45] in the Holy Spirit that's right church
[1:28:47] where we stop worrying about who's here
[1:28:49] stop worrying about who's here at us we
[1:28:51] just got to know God's here in us amen
[1:28:53] that's the kind of real spirit prayer
[1:28:55] amen we don't care who's around us we
[1:28:58] got to be a church that prays down the
[1:28:59] blessings of God that's right he said
[1:29:04] I'm sure your pastor would appreciate
[1:29:05] every member becoming like that I would
[1:29:08] and I'd appreciate myself being more
[1:29:11] dedicated to prayer and how it would be
[1:29:14] if the church would just be like that
[1:29:16] can you imagine what our church would be
[1:29:17] like if we just prayed until the
[1:29:19] blessings came down think about that we
[1:29:23] prayed until the blessing came down
[1:29:26] hallelujah I hope you're seeing we have
[1:29:31] a lot of room to grow Church we're a
[1:29:35] young church right we just started our
[1:29:37] church 11 years ago we're a young church
[1:29:39] we need to learn how to pray the
[1:29:41] blessings of God down we have to learn
[1:29:44] that now I got a lot of scriptures I'm
[1:29:48] going to close with here and I got 12
[1:29:50] minutes okay
[1:29:51] plenty of time there by God's grace now
[1:29:52] I limit myself because if not I'm gonna
[1:29:54] wear out my voice I'm gonna lose my
[1:29:55] voice again and I told the Lord I won't
[1:29:57] do that because I'm not controlling
[1:30:00] myself like Paul said I got to control
[1:30:01] myself so I want to just pull out a few
[1:30:04] more scriptures that inspired me this is
[1:30:07] I just want to share this this is
[1:30:08] inspiration that struck me as we're
[1:30:11] preaching these church ages this is
[1:30:13] Bible inspiration that struck me that
[1:30:16] has actually helped me in my Christian
[1:30:17] walk have you been helped in your
[1:30:19] Christian walk since we've been
[1:30:20] preaching the series I hope somebody can
[1:30:22] say Amen I have I know I have and so I'm
[1:30:26] going to share some of these specific
[1:30:27] examples right from the scripture that
[1:30:30] have given me inspiration as I preached
[1:30:32] it because that's what we're supposed to
[1:30:35] have we're supposed to be inspired when
[1:30:37] we leave here my I love when the Holy
[1:30:39] Spirit spoke to my heart here I love
[1:30:41] when God gave me his promise here I love
[1:30:44] when I felt the blessing of God here I
[1:30:46] love when God healed me there we need to
[1:30:47] be inspired in the house of God it has
[1:30:51] to be that way and I was praying last
[1:30:53] Sunday night even after brother Simon
[1:30:54] preached I was praying God help us to be
[1:30:56] a church where people can feel the power
[1:30:58] of God in our church any church can have
[1:31:01] preaching any church can have singing
[1:31:02] but we want the power of God where it
[1:31:05] convicts people to repent where brings
[1:31:08] sinners to repentance right where it
[1:31:10] heals the sick praise God
[1:31:12] where it does miracles amongst us where
[1:31:15] it speaks in tongues and interprets
[1:31:17] praise God where it gives gifts of
[1:31:19] knowledge and words of wisdom and all
[1:31:21] these things all the moving of the Holy
[1:31:23] Spirit gifts of faith gifts of miracles
[1:31:25] we want to be a church where we're known
[1:31:27] by the power of God that's right it has
[1:31:29] there been power yes
[1:31:31] brother Jesse yes I say yes there has
[1:31:32] been power God has healed people here
[1:31:34] we're thankful for that but we just want
[1:31:36] to see more of it we want to see more of
[1:31:38] it and we can't let up we can't let up
[1:31:40] we can't get relaxed we can't get
[1:31:42] comfortable when you do that you lose
[1:31:43] your first love and you're on your road
[1:31:45] out I'll say like Paul you're on the way
[1:31:49] to be a castaway you're on the road to
[1:31:53] be a castaway
[1:31:54] we're God will cast you a I don't want
[1:31:56] to be cast away I want to be a faithful
[1:31:58] loyal Christian I want to be cast away
[1:32:02] from God's presence member David said
[1:32:03] cast me not away from your presence of
[1:32:05] Lord but renew a steadfast spirit within
[1:32:07] me help me to be more steadfast with my
[1:32:10] love for you Jesus how many be a more
[1:32:12] faithful Christian I hope our hearts
[1:32:14] desire that tonight amen
[1:32:16] so let me bring these out I got a few
[1:32:18] more minutes here I got one two three
[1:32:21] four five six about six more scriptures
[1:32:23] can you bear with six more scriptures
[1:32:25] okay
[1:32:26] I know you can search I know you've
[1:32:28] never turned me down one time I just
[1:32:30] want to hear your approval okay and I
[1:32:36] hope you're blessed here tonight okay
[1:32:37] now
[1:32:38] Ezekiel 46 9 this was inspired to me as
[1:32:41] I preached as I read it I caught the
[1:32:44] inspir felt I call inspiration of the
[1:32:46] Holy Spirit now you can believe
[1:32:48] different but I know it's helped my life
[1:32:50] because I know from this scripture I
[1:32:53] cannot leave the house of God the same
[1:32:55] way I came I preached us about welcome
[1:32:58] numerous months ago I'm really bad at
[1:32:59] estimating time but in zico 46 9 the
[1:33:03] Bible said when the people of the land
[1:33:05] shall come before the Lord and the
[1:33:06] solemn feast he the entereth by the way
[1:33:09] of the north gate to worship shall go by
[1:33:12] the way of the south gate so if you came
[1:33:13] in the north gate you gotta lead the
[1:33:15] south gate and he that enters by the way
[1:33:18] the south gate should go forth by the
[1:33:20] way of the north gate he should not
[1:33:22] return by the way of the gate whereby he
[1:33:24] came in but he should go forth over
[1:33:26] against it and this was a revelation to
[1:33:29] me because this scripture said God would
[1:33:32] not let you in the feast day he would
[1:33:34] not let you leave the church the same
[1:33:36] way you came amen that's what I'm
[1:33:38] talking about
[1:33:39] I let my church that all inspire you if
[1:33:42] you left the same way you came
[1:33:44] and you came in resenting and you left
[1:33:46] for setting shame on you you ought to
[1:33:48] leave a different way cuz God commanded
[1:33:50] you to leave a different way God
[1:33:52] ordained you to leave a different way I
[1:33:54] don't have to be the same person so many
[1:33:57] times in high school that's before I
[1:33:58] serve God that's what happened I would
[1:34:00] be so convicted by my Pentecostal pastor
[1:34:02] I love him
[1:34:03] Randy Trowbridge I would sometimes he
[1:34:05] would jump like this I'm gonna he would
[1:34:06] jump like this from times like that I'd
[1:34:09] be like glory and I'm like 15 years old
[1:34:11] and I would repent my seat and say Jesus
[1:34:14] forgive me but as soon as I left that
[1:34:16] church I went out to the car and turned
[1:34:18] on the rock-and-roll station and all my
[1:34:20] love for God left that's before I was a
[1:34:22] Christian you see I I was convicted but
[1:34:26] then I left the same way I came I drove
[1:34:29] out of the parking lot the same way I
[1:34:30] came and defeated we've got to have an
[1:34:32] experience where you're so inspired you
[1:34:34] walk out that door confident and knowing
[1:34:37] I'll never be the same
[1:34:39] Amen if not then we didn't get what we
[1:34:44] came for
[1:34:45] right we left the same way we came we
[1:34:48] got to leave differently than when we
[1:34:49] came and maybe it's with gossip like we
[1:34:53] said her maybe I struggle with greed
[1:34:56] maybe I struggle with lust
[1:34:58] maybe I struggle with this or that or
[1:34:59] that we can leave differently but we got
[1:35:01] to make sure we follow God's Word and
[1:35:03] say Lord inspire me give me the strength
[1:35:06] touch me tonight I need you you got a
[1:35:08] hunger and thirst for God and you can
[1:35:10] leave the different way tonight by God's
[1:35:12] grace so see that's a natural type of a
[1:35:15] spiritual truth because honey no
[1:35:18] judgment begins to the house of God how
[1:35:19] many know that this is a courtroom
[1:35:21] tonight you're gonna leave here forgiven
[1:35:23] and blessed and and full of joy judged
[1:35:26] forgiven or gonna leave here condemned
[1:35:28] right or in sin or discouraged or full
[1:35:31] of evil or full of lust like we said
[1:35:33] you're gonna leave here one way or the
[1:35:35] other it's your choice it's your choice
[1:35:37] because God is here to pardon you if you
[1:35:40] want to be pardoned because let's read
[1:35:44] this let's go to acts 13 now I on
[1:35:47] YouTube I've been get a lot of comments
[1:35:48] like oh you're judging me about this
[1:35:50] I've had my most popular videos make up
[1:35:52] in the Bible where I show how we
[1:35:54] shouldn't wear makeup the men or women
[1:35:56] but mostly women you know cuz that's
[1:35:58] that's the temptation for women but I
[1:36:00] keep getting these comments I get a lot
[1:36:03] of good comments a lot of good ones but
[1:36:04] the ones that don't like my teaching
[1:36:06] they say they say oh you're judging me
[1:36:10] and I say I'm not judging you I'm
[1:36:13] judging make up I'm judging make up and
[1:36:16] saying make up is wrong it's a heathen
[1:36:17] trait it's from the Egyptians and God
[1:36:20] told Israel don't learn the ways of the
[1:36:23] heathen it's a command right it's a
[1:36:26] Bible command and all three women that
[1:36:28] wore makeup in the Bible were immoral
[1:36:30] idol worshippers Jezebel is the most
[1:36:33] famous one and they think or you're
[1:36:36] judging me I never I never said you're
[1:36:38] going to hell
[1:36:38] I just said makeup is a sin because it's
[1:36:40] heathen and I said what you're doing
[1:36:43] though is if you love the world and love
[1:36:45] makeup and love these things then if you
[1:36:46] love the world the Bible said the love
[1:36:48] of God is not even in you how many can
[1:36:50] understand that by God's grace like
[1:36:53] again if I go to LA Lakers and I love
[1:36:56] Lonzo ball or go to the Cavs
[1:36:59] I love LeBron Jayde I scream for more
[1:37:00] for LeBron James and Jesus Christ I'm an
[1:37:03] idol worshiper and that player is my
[1:37:06] idol that's true that's very true acts
[1:37:10] 13 I believe it's 43 or 46 I just kind
[1:37:14] of came to my heart so bear with me I'm
[1:37:16] just have to give me a minute to skin
[1:37:18] the page you you and I judge ourselves
[1:37:22] yeah it's 446 who'd like to read that
[1:37:25] 13:46 Malachi okay then maybe Benjamin
[1:37:27] the next one maokai 1346 you will judge
[1:37:30] yourself yeah who judged the Jews here
[1:37:49] they judged themselves can every see
[1:37:52] that they judge themselves your attitude
[1:37:56] towards the word is your judgment either
[1:37:59] for yourself or against yourself do you
[1:38:01] either judge the word is right or my own
[1:38:03] attitude is right right and when Jesus
[1:38:07] plays back your life on the screen and
[1:38:08] all these at the white throne judgment
[1:38:10] for people and
[1:38:12] he's gonna say you judge yourself you
[1:38:13] judge me unfaithful you judge me I
[1:38:16] wasn't important you judge me I wasn't
[1:38:18] the love of your life you judged me and
[1:38:19] Jesus said because you do that now I'll
[1:38:22] judge you and you you're eternally lost
[1:38:24] does everybody see that by God's grace
[1:38:25] you judge yourself right but they're
[1:38:29] saying well you're judging me I'm not
[1:38:30] saying where you're going I'm just
[1:38:31] judging the sin does that help go to
[1:38:35] Philippians 1 now this one that came to
[1:38:36] me as well go to Philippians 1 I just
[1:38:40] love these nuggets by God's grace amen
[1:38:42] Philippians 1 now I just went there by
[1:38:51] memory I could have the wrong chapter
[1:38:53] but it's a scripture about judgment okay
[1:38:59] yeah it's verse 9 so Paul wrote this
[1:39:02] letter from prison to the church at
[1:39:04] Philippi look what he said in verse 9
[1:39:07] and this I pray that your love may
[1:39:10] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:39:12] and in all what church all judgment so
[1:39:17] see everybody judges everybody judges
[1:39:21] but see we judge by the love of God
[1:39:23] that's what's different about you and I
[1:39:26] we judge makeup or we judge judge
[1:39:28] cussing or we judge idol worship of
[1:39:30] sports figures or we judge alcoholism
[1:39:32] and transgender and all these things
[1:39:36] homosexuality and abortion we judge all
[1:39:38] that with the love of God with the love
[1:39:42] of God Paul said you need more and more
[1:39:43] love so that you can judge the right way
[1:39:45] glory hallelujah see that's a policy
[1:39:50] this is Holy Writ grow and love that you
[1:39:54] can judge things the right way because
[1:39:56] that's what that's what the discerning
[1:39:58] gift is discerning is judging discerning
[1:40:00] is judging this is of God this is of
[1:40:02] Satan how many know we need the
[1:40:04] discernment gifts in the church this is
[1:40:06] of God this is of Satan we need to judge
[1:40:08] the spirits alright hope that was okay
[1:40:13] that wasn't those who were not in my
[1:40:14] notes but I hope that's a blessing to
[1:40:16] you okay go to Revelation 219 we'll have
[1:40:18] two briefly hit these revelation 219 I
[1:40:22] hope by God's grace you receive some
[1:40:25] tonight that's what we're supposed to
[1:40:27] get when we're gathered together we're
[1:40:29] supposed to have inspiration revelation
[1:40:34] 2:19 remember I'm looking at your faces
[1:40:38] you're looking at my face we wouldn't
[1:40:40] have a face that glorifies the Lord yes
[1:40:43] Lord I believe that we're I'm hungry for
[1:40:44] more you were I believe the truth they
[1:40:46] men of the hunger and thirst for
[1:40:47] righteousness
[1:40:48] revelation 2:19 this was a great
[1:40:51] revelation to me I know thy works and
[1:40:53] charity and service and faith and thy
[1:40:55] patience and thy works and the last to
[1:40:58] be more than the first and the Prophet
[1:41:02] picks up the scripture he says do you
[1:41:04] see the secret to the Christian life
[1:41:06] when trials come on you you don't give
[1:41:10] God less of yourself you give God more
[1:41:13] of yourself
[1:41:14] he said that is the secret to the
[1:41:17] Christian life and like I said we see so
[1:41:20] many people pulling away from church
[1:41:21] dedications pulling away from other
[1:41:23] things instead of giving God more that
[1:41:26] you've got and the secret to
[1:41:29] Christianity is fighting through not
[1:41:31] looking at all the symptoms not looking
[1:41:33] at the problems but looking at the
[1:41:34] victory that Christ promised us a man
[1:41:36] because now you're looking at eyes of
[1:41:38] faith hallelujah now you're looking the
[1:41:40] long-term I see Christ I see him coming
[1:41:43] whether it's in my lifetime or not it
[1:41:44] doesn't matter if I die be the first one
[1:41:47] to rise amen that's right I'll be the
[1:41:50] first one to rise because that the dead
[1:41:51] in Christ will rise first amen and we're
[1:41:54] looking long-term so we don't compromise
[1:41:56] on the Word of God we give more of our
[1:41:59] lives to God more of our time more of
[1:42:02] ourselves
[1:42:02] the last is more than the first what
[1:42:05] about the last church age go hurry
[1:42:06] hallelujah
[1:42:08] amen the last is more than the first
[1:42:12] that's why I harp on that's why I try to
[1:42:13] remind you give more of God don't skip
[1:42:15] church or don't miss the sermon if you
[1:42:17] miss it go back and listen to it don't
[1:42:19] miss feeding on God's Word because it's
[1:42:20] going to become a habit pretty soon then
[1:42:23] you're gonna be in the habit of not
[1:42:24] hungry down them thirsting for the word
[1:42:25] anymore they're gonna wonder where the
[1:42:27] Spirit of God go you offended him
[1:42:28] you aggrieved him you're filling your
[1:42:30] life with things that are not more
[1:42:32] valuable the most valuable thing is the
[1:42:34] word of Christ because the word is a
[1:42:37] seed and the seed has life in it amen
[1:42:39] glory revelation 2 - this kind of ties
[1:42:42] in what we're saying a little bit about
[1:42:44] the false doctrines and some of our
[1:42:45] sister churches there's my hour let me
[1:42:48] set a timer here maybe tried 10 more
[1:42:51] minutes here I just need the reminder
[1:42:53] because I gotta shut down here
[1:42:55] revelation 2 - okay where the bench make
[1:43:00] you read to - thank you sir
[1:43:20] now one Revelation as I was preaching
[1:43:22] one inspiration I got to was where the
[1:43:25] prophet in the book says the true Passos
[1:43:30] would walk up to the false apostles and
[1:43:32] say you are not saying what Paul said
[1:43:34] therefore you are false and that was a
[1:43:37] great revelation to me because people
[1:43:39] today are saying pastors don't have to
[1:43:40] preach anymore just play the tape and
[1:43:42] church if we had enough bonus or if we
[1:43:45] letter the Holy Spirit to do that we
[1:43:46] could walk up to people that are trying
[1:43:48] to discount pastors and we could say you
[1:43:51] are not saying what Paul said therefore
[1:43:53] you are false I know that's rough
[1:43:56] I know that's hard but that's the truth
[1:43:58] Paul said if you change one thing about
[1:44:00] what he preached you're cursed did you
[1:44:04] know whatever you know that let's go
[1:44:05] three - Galatians 1 let's read that he
[1:44:08] said if you change one thing I preached
[1:44:09] you're cursed because he didn't get the
[1:44:13] gospel from his own thought he got it
[1:44:15] from Jesus Christ
[1:44:18] look at Galatians 1 eighth cavalry - for
[1:44:23] that by God's grace okay amen and then
[1:44:25] now okay so amen read 8/9 sir thank you
[1:44:46] sir
[1:44:46] Malakai read verse 12 this is why
[1:44:48] they're cursed because if you change one
[1:44:50] thing Paul preached you're changing
[1:44:52] really what Jesus told him to preach
[1:44:54] okay now go ahead verse 12 amen praise
[1:45:04] God let's say praise the Lord ready
[1:45:07] praise the Lord
[1:45:09] see you can't change what Paul said you
[1:45:11] can't if you change that you become
[1:45:14] cursed and you see people falling away
[1:45:16] into sin that's why they change what
[1:45:18] Paul said they're liars
[1:45:20] Paul said I was taught the gospel by
[1:45:22] Jesus Christ don't change it just say
[1:45:25] what he said now I don't know if you
[1:45:28] read this but I just read this yesterday
[1:45:29] morning and I was blown away go to 2nd
[1:45:31] Thessalonians 1 I'll try to I better
[1:45:33] close with this because I'm just gonna I
[1:45:35] just hi mercy Lord amen
[1:45:38] second Thessalonians chapter 1 I just
[1:45:40] can't be discouraged I just got to
[1:45:41] preach and be be good
[1:45:43] 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 8
[1:45:54] actually this back
[1:45:55] to verse seven now what's Paul saying in
[1:46:01] verse five and six is that those people
[1:46:03] who persecute Christians are going to
[1:46:05] experience the wrath of God that's what
[1:46:07] he's saying in verse five and six
[1:46:09] now think about people that have
[1:46:10] persecuted you you and I don't want to
[1:46:12] see them persecuted but the truth is
[1:46:15] many of them will not repent because
[1:46:17] remember it's always the false seed that
[1:46:19] persecutes the true seed right
[1:46:22] it was Ishmael that persecuted Isaac
[1:46:24] right and that's what Paul said in
[1:46:26] Galatians chapter 3 so we'll they'll be
[1:46:27] at the end time the false pretending
[1:46:30] church always persecute the true church
[1:46:32] the Church of Jesus Christ now look at
[1:46:36] verse 7 and to you who are troubled rest
[1:46:40] with us when the Lord Jesus shall be
[1:46:42] revealed from heaven with his mighty
[1:46:43] angels look at this in flaming fire
[1:46:47] taking what this struck me this blew me
[1:46:50] out of my chair almost I'm reading I'm
[1:46:52] like what vengeance
[1:46:54] Jesus is coming back with vengeance that
[1:46:58] means revenge he's gonna get revenge on
[1:47:01] all those who spoke bad about his word
[1:47:04] he's not in the Vengeance mode right now
[1:47:07] but when he comes back it's vengeance
[1:47:09] time and this struck me because all to
[1:47:12] hear Jesus love Jesus love he loves you
[1:47:14] yes he does God loves you got us up but
[1:47:16] when he comes back it's vengeance in
[1:47:20] other words you got to pay the price if
[1:47:22] you spoke evil against the Holy Ghost so
[1:47:24] if you denied the word of God in this
[1:47:25] case if you didn't obey the gospel he's
[1:47:27] coming back with vengeance and there's a
[1:47:30] reason for that but let's read them in
[1:47:31] flaming fire taking vengeance on them
[1:47:33] that know not God see that we're born
[1:47:35] again of the Holy Ghost and that obey
[1:47:38] not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:39] who shall be what punished with
[1:47:43] everlasting fire
[1:47:44] I'm sorry everlasting destruction from
[1:47:46] the presence of the Lord and from the
[1:47:47] glory of his power how come we don't
[1:47:48] hear before this preach as much because
[1:47:50] it will drive people out of the church
[1:47:52] but not the true people out of church
[1:47:55] it'll drive make believers out but it
[1:47:56] won't drive out true believers amen
[1:47:58] glory and wise Jesus have vengeance it's
[1:48:02] because of all these scriptures Jesus
[1:48:07] here we'll just
[1:48:09] I just briefly touched these in this
[1:48:11] scripture the Bible says the way of
[1:48:13] holiness is so simple a fool won't air
[1:48:15] in it
[1:48:16] this scripture revelation 22:17 says
[1:48:19] whosoever is hungry thirsty let him come
[1:48:21] let it let whosoever come let him come
[1:48:23] Jesus is inviting everybody and this
[1:48:26] scripture says that Jesus gives us every
[1:48:28] spiritual blessing that we could
[1:48:30] possibly desire in other words Jesus is
[1:48:32] offering the gospel to everyone it's so
[1:48:34] simple just stop loving the world and
[1:48:36] fall in love with Jesus amen so because
[1:48:40] they turned him down and they rather
[1:48:41] have a house a football well rather have
[1:48:44] Pittsburgh penguin hockey because they'd
[1:48:46] rather worship that Jesus has to come
[1:48:48] back with vengeance because he offered
[1:48:51] it so freely he gave everything he died
[1:48:53] on the cross he sent the Holy Ghost he
[1:48:55] sent preachers preaching his word he did
[1:48:57] everything he put it on radio he put it
[1:48:59] on internet he put it everywhere and
[1:49:01] they still turned him down they spit in
[1:49:03] his face in other words the Bible say
[1:49:05] they trample under feet the Son of God
[1:49:07] they say I don't have time for that
[1:49:08] nonsense they trampled under and the
[1:49:10] Bible said they crucify him afresh a
[1:49:12] second time that's right
[1:49:15] and because of that he comes back with
[1:49:17] vengeance I'm gonna get revenge on these
[1:49:19] that did not obey the gospel Church this
[1:49:22] is a serious thing tonight help us to be
[1:49:25] faithful let's stand to our feet I
[1:49:26] better stop there I just thought of I
[1:49:27] got a whole nother screen another group
[1:49:29] of scriptures but now it's almost out of
[1:49:32] o'clock that's got to stop by God's
