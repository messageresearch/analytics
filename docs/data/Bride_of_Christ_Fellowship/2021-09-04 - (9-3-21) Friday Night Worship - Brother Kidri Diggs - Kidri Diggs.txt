amen if you have your bibles let's turn to um genesis chapter 6 genesis chapter six and then we'll go to joshua chapter one amen genesis chapter six uh let's just start reading that verse five oh my genesis 6 and 5 the bible says and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping things and the files of the air for it repeats me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord amen let's go to joshua chapter one amen the bible says verse 1 it says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spoke unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your cults there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake me be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide and inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them amen lord bless reading of his word you can have your cease tonight amen church the word of god is so rich and we we have to believe that we're in bible days you know that we're not just out here floating around somewhere but we should be able to look in the bible and be like man i'm here this i i see this upon the earth i see this in akron ohio or in my case i see this in south carolina you know the bible it should be a reality the scriptures should be reality to us as as christians but tonight by by god's grace i want to use for a subject under the influence under the influence and you know normally when we think about that under the influence we think about maybe some substance abuse maybe somebody who's who's who's if i could be playing who's drunk or maybe high you know they're under a certain substance which puts them under influence where they're not operating the way they would normally operate but it's the very thing that's controlling them that's bringing out who they really are so when you fall under an influence that influence literally takes over your being amen against your own will hallelujah you think about the average because you know i've i've known some people who maybe have gotten drunk and before they were drunk they'd walk up to people like hey kadry how you doing you just such a good person i'm telling my family members you know they'd be like hey i love you man you just you that you know you know i i certainly appreciate you but when they get under their influence you know all that love they have for me they'll walk up to me and say you know what you nice nasty you do it in a nice way but you're still nasty i know what you're saying is the truth but the way you say it you say it in a nice nasty kind of way you know what breaks that out it's the influence of the substance that they're partaking of in church if a natural uh influence of some substance can do that to a a natural being what about us as children of god what about the influence of god getting into our system what about the influence of god taking control of your mind when you can speak his thoughts what about the influence of god taking control of your body well you can yield it to his will maybe you can walk on water hallelujah peter would have never been able to do that without the influence of god hallelujah so it's all right to be under the influence if it's the right kind of influence and what we're talking about tonight we're talking about the influence of the holy ghost holy that's what we want to be under amen but i kind of want to show you the parallel the parallel of the wicked influence versus the parallel of the godly influence in church um depending on which way you lean you look at the influence as being something that uh you would never want to do because the drunk person loves that influence but to you and i we're like man you got to be crazy and us as the christians we love the influence of the power of god but the unbeliever looks at us like we got be crazy hallelujah so the influence that you desire is the influence that you love hallelujah and the bible says whosoever you yield your members to that's whose servant you are hallelujah so if you yield yourself to a certain influence you become a servant to that thing you become a slave to that thing you are what that is hallelujah and if we let god influence us we become god hallelujah walking on this earth but let's look at the world let's look at the earth under the wrong influence and how god thought about it we look right here in the book of genesis and god said in the book of genesis he said to them and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth in that every imagination of his heart my every imagination of the thoughts of his heart church he was under such an influence mankind that everything they thought about was evil but it didn't just rest in their mind it was who they were because the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he hallelujah so these different influences that they had back in the bible days in genesis god said i can't take it no more god said i'm tired of looking at them being under the influence of wickedness hallelujah it's not just in their mind but this is what my creation has become holy god looked at men and all the sin and all the different things that was taking place and god said i'm sick of these influences i'm going to destroy this influence but i what i want us to catch is if you're not influenced by god you're influenced by evil spirit hallelujah hallelujah and listen how god looked at those who were not influenced by him the bible says it grieved god to his heart that he even made man i don't want to be looked upon like that when it comes to the eyes of god i don't want to be under such an influence of what's going on in the world such an influence of of of of houses and cars and land and influences of men and women and influences of hollywood and influences of mega churches and influences of doctrines and all these things god looked at it and god said i hate i made you see god has feelings yes and he was looking at creation and the bible says everything everything he imagined it wasn't about heaven it was evil thoughts it was an influence that was turning them into something that god was not so what was happening god was looking at creation and god is looking at it and saying we don't relate god is saying i cannot relate to what i'm saying god is saying i did not create man to operate like this earlier so in order for me hallelujah to be who i am i have to destroy this you know a lot of times when i talk to young people i say do not ignore the pull of god because when you come to church and god's dealing with you and and it happens over and over and over again and you still don't surrender your life the only thing left for you after so many times of that is judgment that's right yes and people wonder why certain things happen in their life or certain things happen on their job and all these things because god gives warning at the warning and it normally starts with just a simple pull of correction god dealing with the conscience and the heart the imagination of man trying to influence them of his nature and his character but we ignore it and right here in genesis they ignored god because man didn't start off like that so we have to believe that god continually tried to deal with man and help man and get them back to the place that they left when they were called adam but adam fell under the influence of his wife and his wife fell on the influence of the serpent and the serpent fell under the influence of the devil and god looked at the whole pattern and he said i'm going to destroy it but in the midst of god making his choice to destroy man he couldn't deny who he was he was a savior so even though everything else was under an influence of evil here god stayed under the influence of who he was as a savior and he could not help be what he was he could not help but be the attribute that was inside of him which was a savior so he picked out a family hardly he picked out a man hallelujah who wasn't no better than anybody else but he said you know what i'm going to put you under the influence of grace whoa hallelujah when everybody else was in the world doing that thing god came to know in the bible says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord everybody else their hearts were imagination was continually wicked and evil but then grace came to the house of noah now everybody's doing their own thing but noah's operating under a different influence but what seemed to look like grace almost felt like a problem because you think about the grace of god comes to the house of noah and he has to do something that man never did before he has to do things with his family that none of them were used to under the influence and direction of the word now what you understand is how important this is noah didn't have a bible noah didn't have a prophet noah didn't have scriptures and scrolls all know i had was a word from god whoa church church i want you to think about it a little bit deeper noah didn't even have any vindication he had to believe this word fall under the influence of this word strictly by faith he never saw rain before his family never saw ray before his friends never saw reign before now i wonder how can you be under the influence of god strictly by faith no matter what you've seen no matter what you've heard but you believe it's god's word talking to you and you're able to stand to that influence no matter what the world is doing because in the long run what looks like to everybody else as something crazy is really building a boat the grace of god but we look at what noah had to go through noah had a family holiday there were days hallelujah you can imagine let's just paraphrase let's just say jesse was no america hello and you know there were some days when noah hallelujah jesse couldn't go play with his son why because he had to stick with that influence he had to stay with what god had said to him strictly a word and you know there probably was days noah looked at his son and been like looked at his boys he had three of them be like man i want to play with them so bad so you know what he had to do he had to rightly divide his time hallelujah some days he'll go and play but then he'll tell the boys hey i got to get back to this boat see hallelujah he could be a father and still be under the right influence that's what's wrong with me and today hallelujah they're trying to be fathers but they're not under the right influence so they're turning into baby daddies why because of the influence of the world [Applause] but you look at it there were times hallelujah where he he couldn't spend as much time with his sons but he had to hallelujah he had to be under such of an influence that his life would influence his kids hurry to fall under the same men hurry up he had to be under such an influence and be happy about it how often do you see a sad drunk they like doing what they doing right they'll fall down and get back up and say give me some more and wake up the next day and brag about how much of the influence they was on even though they sick even though they might have a knot on their head from hitting the floor they'd be like whoa boy what a time we had last night why he's reflecting on being under that influence but we come to church and we have powerful services and never tell anybody about it we come to church and god talk directly to us and we go home silent we go to work silent we're in the store silent we're not causing what kind of influence are you undead noah holly he had to be under influence hallelujah where that influence would silently deal with his whole family by him just being faithful to the influence he's um that's why the bible says raise up a child in the way that they should go and when they get older it won't depart why because as you're raising them up there's an influence sitting in their lives let's catch it before i go on i want to give you a little bit of the definition of influence influence the capacity to have an effect on the character see there are things in our life that's having an effect on our character honey there are people all over the world who can't get enough of instagram and you know what it's doing is having a influence on their character they don't they don't they don't even know why they be in the house making little videos and little dances and doing all this stuff what is it it's the influence of id they don't know why they doing all your little skits and and all this little stuff and posing in the mirror it's the influence of tank top hey look i ain't got no problem with a little fun but when that thing influences you more than the influence of god is turning you into something huh hallelujah amen and then then they start calling themselves you got women now who would once just look at look at tick-tock or look at instagram and then they got this little thing this little thumb on that hug they got this thumb on there called like amen and they got another thumb on there that says dislike and no matter which one you get the most will influence what you do the next time you put a pitch up there and now you got girls hallelujah they're putting hallelujah pictures up there for the thumbs up why because the thumbs up is influencing them hallelujah and they begin to dress a certain way then their name changes hallelujah their name may be susan or something like that but now susan identifies as an ig model i'm sorry brother what is it doing it's developing a certain kind of character it's turning that person into something what about us we come and we hear the word of god every week hallelujah faithfully hearing preachers preach faithfully reading our bibles faithfully studying this message what should it do it should influence our character it should be turning us into something what is it not an ig model no it's turning us into the word man flesh that's what it's doing hallelujah think about your influences in your life holy look if your mother was a good homemaker her life would rub off on you if you appreciate who she was that's right yes but if you look at us all this woman did a fuss oh she did clean up this and do this and help me with my brothers and sisters and yeah i got six of them without realizing as a girl what that mom or her influence is doing she's trying to turn you into her what she's doing she's she's influencing you we're talking about a christian woman now her influence is giving out virtue hallelujah and then as she's giving out virtue that virtue is rubbing off on you holly and you are subliminally becoming what you're seeing just like a young man who's close to his dad his dad would teach him his trains but now in our days the boys don't want to follow up with their dads yes sir i'd give it all if if you come out in the work field if i had a dad who was a carpenter or a plumber or whatever he was and if he could teach me that trade you know i'd be up under i'd be up from like a little sad puppy which one what you want me to do that what you want me to do because if i seen that trade take care of me and my family hallelujah it'll do the same thing when i step out on my own hallelujah if we're seeing the influences of god develop christian people who have powerful lives it'll still do the same thing today if the influence hallelujah if the influence of god gave us a peter hallelujah it'll still do it today if the influence of god gave us an esther he'll still do it today and the influence of god gave us a power it'll skip it today if the influence of god gave us a roof it'll still do it today why because the words don't change listen as long as noah stayed with it the grace had to stay there on his family and the world got more and more regular and noah received more and more why grace once god begins to unleash his influence and you catch it he can't take it back that's right hallelujah we may deal with this the weekend but if god ever does something in your life holy you need to put that hallelujah in your secret place especially if it came to pass or did something righteous and faithful in your life hallelujah that that he can't deny and that you can't deny that it was god if you keep that hallelujah all you have to do is keep reminding god of what he did [Applause] because god could never say oh i didn't mean to do that he can't do that if he did it he meant to do it don't get nervous i'm gonna be too low i'm about to close let's look at noah now you know he had to stay with that influence of god and everybody looking at noah out there cutting down trees and pouring sap and beating beating stop out of you doing all this stuff and they looking at him like man this man crazy you know what they couldn't recognize grace the hot days he was out in the sun sweating and beating and doing and cutting and doing all this stuff they looking at like man come on no let's go party they couldn't understand what they were looking at was grace and maybe his boys maybe his boys i'm gonna break it up the holiday maybe his boys wanted to go to an aau tournament and noah's like hey boys i can't go we can't go we need to continue to work on this ark we need to continue to work on this all maybe another time hallelujah and maybe noah hallelujah he had to split his time up real wisely you know he had a wife also hallelujah and maybe his wife came to him and said honey you forgetting about date night he said honey i got to stay with this grace we gonna have a date night but right now i got the stairs in his influence see noah got to a place to where he could go take care of his family but he come right back under the influence and that's where god wants to be because brother branham hallelujah the prophet he said he said hey plan like it's another 50 years but he said live like god come in tomorrow or right now amen so church you got to know how to stay under that influence and you think about it now god only spoke that word of grace to noah he didn't speak it to his children he didn't speak it to his wife so noah's influence had to be so strong that his family could see man this man on another level i don't know what it is but he's so dedicated to this thing but look hollywood when you're under the influence that you love hallelujah it projects that to who's watching you hold up everybody else look at that noise like he's crazy building a boat but his family is looking at him saying god there's something different about daddy oh hallelujah noah's wife is looking at him saying there's something different about noah he's building this boat there's something about this boat the influence of his boat he's turned him into another man so noah's wife she got to the point saying honey don't worry about date night date night gonna be at the boat but jesse i could see her cook up a meal and get everything together and say honey we gonna have date night on the boat we're gonna send a blanket out on the boat we will have a little fun right here on the boat hallelujah and after we eat after we peek nick we're gonna move almost out of the way and we're gonna get right back under the influence [Applause] but that influence had to be so strong that his whole family his whole family would subliminally come under that same influence because they could see a man of god they could see a man who had a word from god but he loved what he was doing see that's the difference hallelujah about being a a born again christian and just somebody going to church because you're somebody going to church holy cobra started and they ain't been back since because now they're under the influence of covet and they don't even realize hollywood church to a certain extent we were under the same influence hallelujah but but the thing of it is is holy what's the root of who you are hey man what's the root of who you are you know what they said you said brothers i was never under the influence yes she was at one point of our life all of us had the way mass to go around what was that you were under the influence of copenhagen 19. sir look if that would have never happened we would have never been walking around with no mask on right i was i was i was at my um my daughter's school on a mask a hat and all this stuff i said you know what five years ago they would have never let me in the bank like this as soon as i walk in they'll hit the button they try to rob us but now i go in with a hat with a mask and they'll give me money you see hallelujah the wisdom of man is foolishness to god they're showing really how smart they are oh my but at one point of time we were all under that influence but how many of us couldn't wait till the regulations change see i'm one of those people see this is how you know you got another influence upon you and your influence should be isaiah 53 hallelujah your influence should be mark 16 hallelujah amen that should be your influence hallelujah church hallelujah i never fully adapted to the influence of covey because i'd get out of my car and walk all the way up to the door and see the sign you got to have a man now i got to go back to my car and get a mass why because i'm not under that influence whoa jesus christ is my safety jesus christ is my protection jesus christ is my coverage [Music] now i render to seasons what is seasons hell yeah but the restrictions and and regulations of of of covet is not who i am i'm under another influence holy oh my church manoa for 120 years stayed under the influence when all he had was a word he had no dreams he had no urine thumb and visitation come on now hallelujah he had no vision all he had is instruction from god and he didn't even know what he was building but all of it came from god and all he had to do is stay faithful to what he heard holy curse that's all we got to do stay faithful to what you're hearing amen and the grace of god will follow you through the rest of your life hallelujah under the influence it says the capacity to have an effect on the character development hallelujah or behavior of someone or something or the effect hallelujah or the effect itself harley see so the influence of a certain thing it has a natural effect over you that's why i'm glad to be able to say i'm a christian because everything that comes with being a christian has a effect on me [Applause] it deals with the it deals with the character development of who i am that's why god sent the vindicated prophet here so that prophet and the word that god was giving that prophet can have an influence on our lives that we will no longer be influenced by baptist doctrine influenced by methodist doctrine influenced by the pentecostals or if ruined by the catholic church but now we're influenced by dust share the law that's what we're influenced by we're not influenced by creeds and dogmas we're not influenced by the thoughts of man because the prophet gets his straight from god we're influenced by the changing of hands from the mighty angel to the seventh angel listen before i close listen lord the prophet of god say people want to do right he said i'm going to read you something right quick he says but you notice the woman in our day they don't seem to have that lady like they once had they're just like hallelujah they want they they they're just like they want to you know my mama would tell me my mom was in her 70s by the grace of god god's been good to her she used to tell me holly if you went to school without a dress on they send you back home you say really brother diggs yeah you know why because back then hardly america was still being influenced off of christianity you still had hallelujah some of the leadership of christ in the schools hallelujah but once they started taking prayer different influences came in harley and now they dress and do whatever they want to do and and nobody says anything about it but being under those kind of influences mankind was still hallelujah had a contact with god but as they fell under the influence influences world of the world and the minds of theology and the minds of who they thought were great people all all of their character and all of their convictions all of their godly convictions begin to leave them amen and now they're being influenced by their desire [Music] simple desire just to be liked oh my god all right listen he says they're they they're just like they want to he says but there's something won't let them do it it seems like there's hallelujah a heaviness hallelujah he said that you tell a lady that she shouldn't she shouldn't do such a thing and the lady looks upon that and believes that my brother jesse there are people you witness to women maybe you've you've witnessed too and they believe what you said but there's a heaviness hallelujah in the world holy there's a spirit hallelujah that walks among the land that won't let them give into it what is it it's a influence he said they believed that he said she wants to believe that but there's something that presses her hallelujah the other way and i want you to understand without god in your life there'll be a spirit that'll press you the other way the prophet god said the only thing that stopped him from getting the holy ghost when he was 12 years old was a spirit you mean to tell me god wants to give a 12 year old the holy ghost yes he does [Applause] more than a 12 year old eight-year-old man how about born in a womb with it like john the baptist oh whatever excuse they come up with god has a word for it he says see poor thing i feel sorry for her she's so caught in such a web of hollywood she doesn't even realize that is hollywood the influences of the world that's stopping her from doing what she really wants to do being a friend of mine was talking today i was coming up the road and we were talking about how people do stuff that just don't seem right and you know i say bro you know we kind of got to have compassion on them because the problem of god said they're not in their right mind hello you take a woman who's married and she goes running the streets and her husband fussing and fighting and all that if she was in her right mind she won't peace she won't peace in her home she's in her right mind she'd want her daughters to be raised up virtuous hardly if she was in her right mind she'd do everything she could do to protect them and protect their minds so you kind of you you kind of got to feel sorry for them because they're operating under another influence that's why when a person is under that influence they can't drive straight they swerving all over the world they in the seat hallelujah but they've lost the capacity to operate the right way and that's what happens to mankind when they fall under the wrong influence hallelujah they could be in the vehicle hallelujah but they love their sense of direction and the only thing left is an accident unless you get stopped by the patrol car [Applause] and so are we headed for an accident [Applause] but that six foot two hundred pound angel hallelujah came and got in the way some of us had to get arrested [Music] the ticket wasn't good enough because we was hard-headed some of us had to go to jail hallelujah but didn't we got the deal hung up we experienced more grace because the judge and the jury was on our side and just that grace made us give up and say i never want to come back to this place again hurry up thank you for your grace slow oh my god he said they're caught in such a web of hollywood in the advertisement of television radio newspaper harley on the street let's see what we have to do is bring it to our day he says television radio newspaper holly those things are not operating so much in our homes in our homes it's not it's not television newspaper radio it's apple sampson apple galaxy macbook and all the stuff and playstation all these different avenues to get your attention all these different avenues to put you under influence you know look i ain't got a problem with if your child play games it's just the kind of games they play that's right because you know some of these games they got you know they had a game called something robbery i can't i can't think of the name of it grand theft auto playing a game and teaching the kids how to rob but it goes deeper than that because not only is it teaching how to rob it has cursing on it it's playing rap music all of these different doors are being opened up because you're letting your child be entertained by something else you're letting your child hallelujah just have a little fun not even realizing there are other influences dropping in there you say brothers how you know this because one day when my son was small his uncle gave him the playstation thing cause i would never be a big gang guy you know i it just didn't matter to me we had a 326 when i was young and after that broke that was it my mama wasn't buying that nest that's just the way it was but now these things falling 500 easy you know what i mean but anyway you know one day my son was playing he was playing uh uh nba i forget what you call the game but he was he was playing that and i walked in there he playing the game playing the game and i heard the song we're playing basketball we love that bat skit i'm watching playing the game but something else got my attention we're playing basketball while he was playing they were playing an old rap song that i grew up on now he has never heard that song before he's more interested in the game but at the same time what the devil is doing he's blending the world he's blending the spirits that fought me hallelujah and now bringing him up to his day and the same things i had to fight now he's fighting it too i'll buy a video game so i say hey you hear that music she said yeah they said they taught my basketball i said you guys you have to take that game throw that and trash you're like bones girl daddy okay daddy you can't don't please that is all dead you can't i say look here the only way you gonna play that is it's that music he said no he said don't worry about daddy i can go in here and i can cut all the music out i said well you better get to doing it because you don't it's going to be in the trash and he went in he and see this is the thing i didn't know how to do it see that's how sleek the devil is but jesse holly he has things hallelujah in our lives that me and you we know about we know how to get to connect and control and then there are things that your kids are far more advanced on yeah you know what they're saying now if you got a you got a um any kind of electronic or something you can't get to they say give it to your child they'll figure it out so you know what in that's that same frame of mind i don't want to hear you come back to me to my school hall math hard science hard i just can't do chemistry but you can figure that game out doing it you can figure that phone out you know how to get these accounts together you know how to put all these messages together and put videos and do uh you can do all that you can do that you can do biology you can do that you can do algebra and calculus don't give me that school too hard stuff and they figure that stuff out with no instructions they just figure it out right i'm sorry y'all listen he says it seems he says hollywood advertiser tv radio newspaper streets in the store he's saying it seems to be that there is something that they just can't pull away from he said our young people hallelujah our old people our middle aged people he said and he said there seems to be something among men man don't seem to be hallelujah have that masculine touch that he used to have hardly now they're saying if a boy say hallelujah he can be eight years old five years six years old and he can come to his parents and say i think i'm a girl and they say holy let's handle this delicately try please my day you know what i do i grab my son hallelujah put him in the mirror and i said what you see you see a boy yeah yes sir i say that's what you are you are a boy the world has fallen under the influence of weak-minded parents listening to hollywood your children weren't created to be drag queens and chinese and all that's tough and they'll be the first ones to say they believe in god how can you believe in god and look at your life and say he made a mistake god don't make no mistakes so if you say hallelujah that you were created wrong and you say you believe in god i'll tell you you don't believe in god because if you were born hallelujah a certain way that was what god intended you to be everything else is just the influences of the mind [Applause] whoa the influences of hollywood yes sir y'all notice how they'll take these big stars and it'll happen with one of their children and they'll promote it all over the world y'all may not even remember this but remember years and years ago one of the biggest stars was a sports guy named magic johnson and he was one of the first ones who went public he went public with two things that they tried to make all right he got he had hiv hallelujah and they tried to make it all right it's all right you can't survive it you can't survive it and you know what else his oldest child is a homosexual yes sir junior is a homosexual and he's been a homosexual for years holly and look at it the spirit has come back around hallelujah is on the way now true it's influence right right people are afraid to call right right wrong you can't serve god unless you have that mindset [Applause] because god don't have no maybe ground he don't have no middle ground remember there was somebody who fell under the wrong influence and he came to god with a maybe oh i thought you said god told samuel he said go down there to the amla kites and kill everybody he said kill mama baby suckling goat horse dog everything kill every man sheep kill it all yes sir saul went down and said okay god i hear you went down there everything that he thought was pretty he saved he saved so all and then he tried to reason with himself what was happening he was under the wrong influence and before that he had this spoken tons and prophesied that's why you need a born-again experience the holy ghost is the only thing that's going to keep you under the right influence because you will find a reason not to do what god's saying and then try to justify it and he's trying to get all smart with god well we're gonna we're gonna sacrifice these beautiful sheep to god we're gonna sacrifice these ghosts to god and this and that but god said go ahead and kill everything and in the middle in the middle of him looking at all of us that he thought was pretty and he gonna sacrifice he left the king alive the very one who started them the kites you see how blinding you get when you follow your influences [Music] oh my church but he comes and he said oh it was the people it was the people they said there's no man you the king the people do what you say you can't lie to god you can't say i ain't come to church because bro jesse he too hard no you can come to church because you don't want to like my practice they doing the cover he said hey he said uh we got it uh streaming for you and we got it at the church i ain't shut the church i ain't shut the church down he said unless they come in and tell me i got to close though he said but other than that we're gonna keep the church over if you don't wanna come we're gonna have it up here but he said go as you land he let that go on for a while he let it go on for a while and then he dropped the bomb on everybody he said y'all notice i said go as you land cause if i would have told you go as godly you'll be in church [Applause] he said that's why i said go as you led because if we go as god leaders we will be in church because the scripture says as we see the damn prank [Music] touch he said you take a man today man don't seem to be birdie like it used to be it's all sort you say they want to wear suede shoes and purple and act like a woman you know what they can do all that but if you're a man he's still gonna have to heal if he a big man he's still gonna have a size 14 foot there ain't nothing he can do about that he can't chop that off and make that petite can't do it can't get no foot surgery to make his feet small no you know why because he was born like that let me leave that alone let me close it let me close with joshua listen i want to show you how important it is when you really fall under the right influence listen listen to the word god gave joshua first of all he told me he said moses my servant is dead he said moses my servant is dead now therefore arise joshua chapter one he said now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all the people unto the land which i do give to them not land that i shall give you land that i do give to them god is saying the land is already yours all you got to do is stay under the influence of moses hallelujah but now you watch him he gonna talk about moses and then he gonna say forget about moses and you stay under this influence he said moses my servant is dead now he dropped down in verse three now he's talking personally to joshua he says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses now god now he's telling joshua the same promise i gave moses i give unto you i want you to be under the same influence hallelujah he told joshua nothing oh my hallelujah listen listen church we drop down to verse five he says he says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of that life as long as you stay under this influence you will never be defeated listen again he's not living by a bible he's not living by strolls all he got is a word from god amen he don't have no vision no dream on that all he got is a word from god and god telling him go take the land just stay under all he got to do is stay under the influence of what god's saying listen this is what joshua did every battle he went through he probably recited this there shall no man be able to stand before me all the days of my life and then you go into the battle destroy everybody didn't go to the canaanites and it'd be thousands of them and he said god said there should not be any man able to stand before me all the days of my life go take the land hallelujah did he go to the jebusites and he said there should not be any man able to stay ah church and after so many times of that joshua's church they know that by heart hallelujah and they're saying it's not just joshua they're saying it as a congregation now there should no man be able to stand before us all the days of our now everybody's under the same influence everybody's under the influence of what god told one man church shouldn't we be under the same influence when god told a man hallelujah if you be sincere not even cancer i'll be able to stand before you amen hallelujah oh my church he was under such an influence that they wouldn't fall ai and they lost the battle yes joshua came back he said hold up gather everybody up hold up and he's standing off to the side saying that lord you said there should no man see how you say that thing there should no man be able to stand before me all the days of my life right so now he over there he thinking he said i ain't got nobody losing something wrong somebody under the wrong influence because i ain't supposed to lose no battle see joshua wasn't used to losing he was used to win so when he lost he knew that somebody was under another influence so he gathered everybody up he said hey y'all i ain't supposed to lose a battle so somebody did wrong and found out aiken has stolen some babylonians comments however so joshua killed him his wife his family his cousins his brother joshua killed everything joshua got that influence at the church don't be mad when people don't come back let them influences go we got a promise we operate under didn't god tell you akron is yours don't worry about where they go josh would say hey something wrong i ain't supposed to lose and after he killed egg in his whole family he went back and fought the same person he lost to because god promised had to be true so he went back after he got everybody back under the same influence again and won the battle joshua was under such an influence of that yes one day he was praying and somebody stood before him glistening looking all mighty and powerful all joshua could think about is there shall no man be able to stand before you and the bible says joshua put his head on his shoulder and joshua's talking to an angel and joshua said are you foolish or against us he was still under the influence it didn't matter who it was amen that's what paul said if an angel come and say anything giving it what i say let him be a curse [Applause] and the woman came up to brother branham and she said brother brother if you say it like this if you say the angel of the lord told you to do it this way she said he said if the angel don't say what god's word say he say i ain't saying it hallelujah sorry that's what it means to be under the influence joshua's standing in front of the captain of the host of the lord but to joshua he's looking like somebody i just got to fight today because i don't know who you are but i got a word that says i got a word that says come on y'all read it with me i got a word that says there shall no man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life [Music] come on musicians and that same influence brought the jericho walls down that same influence said rahab and her house free that same influence hallelujah had caleb said god didn't say that to caleb he said to joshua but caleb was under search of the same influence caleb said i was 20 years old i'm 40 years old when you dealt with me honey he said now these 40 plus years now i'm more stronger now than i was back then he's 80 years old and he's still under the same influence the messenger has been gone 50 plus years but we're still under the same influence [Applause] not the influence of a man but the influence of ghosts and the law church let's stay under the influence because if it's of god it's his grace coming unto you because what it looked like was crazy a man building a boat for 120 years was making him and his whole family judgment proof and what looks crazy to everybody else a kentuckian hallelujah preaching a message with funny grammar and all that stuff looks crazy he's making a people on the earth judgment [Applause] now let's stay under the influence of god's word church of you have no dream if you have no dream you have no vision just say what he said [Applause] that's all you got to do how do you need a visually just stay with what he's saying joshua just came with what he's saying amen let's pray let's pray let's pray lord jesus we love you lord and we thank you for your word lord because it's your word that we live by is your word that sets us free lord it's your word that allows us to go to the next stages of our life so lord as believers help us not to question you help us not to doubt but help us just to stand under that influence of your precious word lord we give you all the honor and glory and we pray lord it was something said to help your people draw nine closer to you in the wonderful name of jesus christ church say amen god bless you churches [Music] [Applause] i believe [Music] is [Music] is [Music] we're
