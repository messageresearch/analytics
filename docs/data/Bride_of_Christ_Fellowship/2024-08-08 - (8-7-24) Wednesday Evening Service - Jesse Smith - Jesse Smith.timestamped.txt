[2:04] forward to the services this weekend
[2:05] praise God now these are the delayed
[2:07] anniversary Services they're supposed to
[2:09] be in June but then the church had the
[2:12] leak and we're almost done I think
[2:15] almost everything's done by God's grace
[2:17] so starting to clean out and get
[2:19] everything back in order here it's nice
[2:21] to be back in the sanctuary praise God
[2:24] hallelujah so Ephesians 2 ver8 a very
[2:26] familiar scripture
[2:30] we're saved by grace through faith
[2:32] Hallelujah we'll read eight n and 10
[2:36] U why don't we read uh 8 n and 10
[2:40] together that's a little bit extra
[2:40] reading for us tonight I think I'd like
[2:42] to hear your voices and it's good to
[2:43] read the word of God because Grace uh
[2:45] Grace as we saw a few weeks ago Grace
[2:47] will produce a love for Holiness uh
[2:50] Grace teaches we should deny anything
[2:53] ungodly that's what it teaches so Grace
[2:55] teaches to live a holy life and here we
[2:57] see grace gives us uh salvation and then
[3:01] helps us realize we are created for
[3:03] God's workmanship we're created to do
[3:04] something for the kingdom of God Amen so
[3:07] let's read 8 n and 10 ready one two
[3:09] three for by grace are ye saved through
[3:13] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[3:16] the gift of God not of Works lest any
[3:20] man should boast for we are his
[3:23] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[3:26] good works which God hath before Ed
[3:29] saying that we should walk in them amen
[3:32] may God add his Blessing to the Ring of
[3:34] his word you may be
[3:36] seated I just saw that a fresh tonight
[3:38] we were created in Christ Jesus isn't
[3:40] that wonderful go uh God thought of you
[3:43] in his mind you were in the the mind of
[3:45] God hallelujah before the foundation of
[3:48] the world Paul tells us actually in the
[3:50] previous chapter uh so what a blessing
[3:52] to know that I'll set my timer here uh
[3:54] just so a Paige knows I usually preach
[3:56] about an hour on Wednesday nights okay
[3:58] all right all right I'll take the
[4:00] freedom I got there appreciate that you
[4:03] know every Sunday page I usually preach
[4:05] about an hour and a half I just get
[4:07] caught up in Heavenly
[4:09] places I just can hardly stop preaching
[4:11] because I love Jesus so much and
[4:14] sometimes it happens on a Wednesday
[4:15] night
[4:16] too so we're just thankful to be here in
[4:19] the house of the Lord here tonight so
[4:21] this is part five we looked at four
[4:22] previous sermons with the same title uh
[4:24] the message of Grace we looked at how
[4:26] Grace was extended to Adam and Eve we
[4:28] looked at how Grace uh was extended to
[4:30] Noah Noah found Grace in the sight of
[4:32] the Lord the Bible says Abraham found
[4:34] the grace of God and then last week we
[4:37] closed with how Israel just as a nation
[4:39] was given Grace and we know they'll
[4:41] always have God's grace because they
[4:43] have God's covenant when God makes a a
[4:45] covenant promise he can't break the
[4:47] promise he can't swear by anything else
[4:50] because there's nothing greater than him
[4:52] so he swears by himself amen uh the book
[4:54] of Hebrews tells us that and even the
[4:57] fact Israel is still in existence today
[4:59] Pro proves that God's grace is with them
[5:02] with all the missiles shot at them and
[5:03] the constant Wars they go through and
[5:05] how many times Jerusalem has been
[5:07] destroyed and rebuilt it just proof that
[5:10] God's grace is for Israel and remember
[5:12] we preached on Romans earlier this year
[5:14] we finished the entire book of Romans
[5:16] and the Bible says that uh once God has
[5:18] done with the done with the Gentiles
[5:20] he'll cut off the Gentiles and he'll
[5:22] graft back in the Jews so the Jews will
[5:24] come back into the Holy Spirit uh in
[5:28] other words they'll receive Jesus Christ
[5:29] as their Messiah they can't see it now
[5:31] because they're blinded to it but once
[5:34] God's done with the Gentiles he saved
[5:35] every last one then he can graft back in
[5:38] the Jews praise God and the Bible said
[5:40] don't be high minded don't boast
[5:41] yourself and and don't feel like you got
[5:44] everything figured out the Bible says uh
[5:45] serve god with reverence and godly fear
[5:48] and be thankful you're connected to
[5:50] Christ amen Christ is the vine you are
[5:53] the branches amen so let's remember
[5:55] we're only we only have anything because
[5:57] of God's mercy on us that God uh cut us
[6:00] off as a wild branch and uh grafted us
[6:02] into a holy tree you know we would be
[6:04] nothing except God uh grafted us into
[6:07] him Hallelujah we we have nothing to
[6:09] boast on praise God it was God who cut
[6:12] us off of the of the wild tree and put
[6:14] us into the Holy One it was God that
[6:16] brought us his love and his Mercy praise
[6:18] God none of us had any righteousness our
[6:20] righteousness was as filthy rags amen
[6:22] there's none that seeketh after God no
[6:24] not one amen and so I want to now look
[6:27] at the next character tonight I want to
[6:28] look at Moses tonight right um so uh I
[6:31] might even get into David we'll kind of
[6:32] see I never know usually usually I go
[6:36] slower than what I think I'm going to go
[6:37] you know so usually it takes me longer
[6:39] to get through my notes you know by
[6:40] God's grace so but that's quite normal
[6:44] uh I think I'll just skip down to Moses
[6:46] here and if you have your Bibles you
[6:48] know you can pull up numbers 20 verse1
[6:50] I'm going to start there uh and I'm
[6:52] preaching this uh this thought from a
[6:55] sermon from 1961 from God's Prophet
[6:57] brother William brandham he passed away
[6:59] of course in 1965 but but I was I've
[7:02] been listening to his sermon and P
[7:04] pulling out the important points I want
[7:05] you to see from the scripture these are
[7:07] points that he uh preached as well and I
[7:10] think you'll you'll like these here by
[7:12] God's grace so I'll just read this here
[7:14] uh and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[7:16] congregation together before the Rock
[7:18] and he said unto them here ye now ye
[7:19] Rebels must we fetch you water out of
[7:23] this rock this is not one of the
[7:25] highlights of Moses's life this is one
[7:28] of the low lights of Moses's life life
[7:30] this wasn't like you know he when when
[7:31] he stuck out his rod and and the waters
[7:34] parted on the Red Sea and he just let
[7:35] him on over that was a a highlight of
[7:38] his life this is one of the the failures
[7:40] of his life and uh uh you know God's
[7:43] Prophet said remember Moses that great
[7:46] leader God should have killed him when
[7:48] he went down there to glorify himself by
[7:51] smiting that
[7:53] rock and said you see what I can do in
[7:55] other words you rebels must we fetch you
[7:58] water from this rock and see you know
[8:01] the Bible tells it later that that Moses
[8:03] glorified himself Moses uh was making it
[8:07] he was putting himself into this like
[8:09] like he had the ability to get water for
[8:11] let's say two million people uh that's
[8:13] just one person's estimate there could
[8:14] have been a million there could have
[8:15] been three million it was just a large
[8:17] amount of people praise God and uh
[8:20] nobody can supply water in the
[8:21] wilderness except God but Moses puts
[8:24] himself in there like like I'm going to
[8:26] go fetch enough water for two million
[8:28] people God wasn't pleas with that and
[8:30] God said because you magnified yourself
[8:32] you will not go into the promised land
[8:35] right God kept them from going into the
[8:37] promised land there while he was alive
[8:40] because of his Disobedience he magnified
[8:43] himself and remember God never said to
[8:45] Smite The Rock God said to speak to the
[8:48] Rock so not only did he put himself in
[8:51] there you know he magnified himself like
[8:53] well I can fetch water like but he had
[8:55] no ability to do that uh but then he
[8:57] even disobeyed God he disobeyed the word
[8:59] of God God and he smoked the waters
[9:02] right the first time and no Waters came
[9:04] out he smoted it again look God gave him
[9:06] a little warning there aren't you glad
[9:07] God gives us warnings right look at
[9:10] God's mercy there he should have just
[9:11] stopped oh that's right I was supposed
[9:13] to speak to the Rock but in still and in
[9:15] his uh the Bible said that that the
[9:17] Bible actually said that they provoked
[9:19] Moses in his anger see because he was
[9:22] angry the first time it didn't come he
[9:23] said W Smite it again he got angry again
[9:26] and he was he was upset with the people
[9:28] he was name called the people now we
[9:30] don't want preachers at name call the
[9:31] people right but then we know Jesus you
[9:34] know called the Pharisees some really
[9:36] strange really uh harsh names I'll say
[9:38] like that he said you serpents you uh
[9:41] you you den of vipers and you den of you
[9:44] brood of vipers you know there's times
[9:46] where you got to pull out those names
[9:47] but it must be led of God hallelujah it
[9:49] must be led by the Holy Spirit
[9:51] Hallelujah but in this moment it was it
[9:54] was anger it wasn't God's spirit it was
[9:56] anger that he was calling them you bunch
[9:57] of rebels
[10:01] and so we see that you know he stepped
[10:02] out of the will of God he should not
[10:04] have smoked The Rock he should have
[10:06] spoke to the Rock and he should not have
[10:08] put himself in the picture he should not
[10:10] have glorified himself he should have
[10:11] glorified God hallelujah now Church
[10:15] what's what's amazing uh now if you pull
[10:17] up numbers uh uh
[10:21] 12:3 what What's amazing is that uh
[10:24] Moses is called the meekest man on the
[10:27] earth that means the the most humble
[10:30] that means the one who who who most puts
[10:32] God first there was nobody on the earth
[10:35] during moses' time who put God first
[10:37] than him remember it's like the same
[10:39] thing with job remember God said is
[10:41] there anybody like job devil remember he
[10:43] said that he's a perfect man there's
[10:44] none like him so see that there are you
[10:47] know God knows who's really trying to be
[10:49] humble God knows aren't you glad God
[10:50] looks at your life God looks at all of
[10:52] our Lives amen and he sees how we're
[10:54] trying to Humble ourselves and serve God
[10:56] God sees your efforts of of of humbling
[10:58] yourself and and and the Bible said
[11:00] dying daily God sees that you want to
[11:02] serve him amen hallelujah but look the
[11:05] Bible says you know he was the meekest
[11:07] man on the whole Earth but I'll say it
[11:09] like this he wasn't always
[11:11] Meek but when he was humble when he was
[11:13] repenting when he was when he was aware
[11:15] of God when he was worshiping God then
[11:18] he was a very Meek
[11:20] individual and this proved it you know
[11:22] we're not going to read all this chapter
[11:23] but remember in this chapter uh his
[11:25] brother and sister Aaron and and Miram
[11:27] were making fun of him because he
[11:28] married a I'm sorry minite yes in E I'm
[11:30] sorry Ethiopia
[11:32] Ethiopia and uh and they were making fun
[11:35] of him and God looked at the brother and
[11:38] sister and said you should not make fun
[11:39] of him and and what did Moses do he went
[11:42] quick to prayer he went to pray for them
[11:45] now church God help us to pray for the
[11:47] people that make fun of us amen is that
[11:49] the first thing we do when someone sends
[11:50] us an awful text or an awful email it
[11:52] ought to be right or someone gives us a
[11:55] a dirty look to our face or someone
[11:57] maybe says a cuss word to us or
[11:58] something is the first thing we do when
[12:00] to pray for them it ought to be praise
[12:02] God Moses had this type of meekness but
[12:05] see he wasn't always the meekest man and
[12:08] church you know as as much as we are
[12:09] Servants of God and we love God and
[12:12] we're we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[12:13] don't always act like it and the church
[12:15] said what I'm trying to do is get us to
[12:17] be humble here tonight right just
[12:19] remember remember how humble we must be
[12:22] and church I'll say like this there
[12:22] might be moments you and I might be some
[12:24] of the most humble Christians people
[12:26] might ever meet but there's also times
[12:28] where we're prideful
[12:30] and we don't honor God the way we ought
[12:32] to those moments ought to be recognized
[12:34] we ought to repent and say God make me
[12:35] humble again Hallelujah let me remember
[12:38] your grace Hallelujah let me not be
[12:40] prideful let Lord don't let me put
[12:42] anything into this I can't do anything I
[12:45] need you Hallelujah I need you every
[12:47] hour I want to remain I want to abide in
[12:49] you Lord Jesus I want to abide in the
[12:53] vine so you know uh we can see how uh
[12:56] Moses you know he he he loved God but he
[13:00] also stumbled at times he needed the
[13:02] grace of God hallelujah here's one I
[13:06] just you know I think could be important
[13:07] to see Exodus
[13:17] 4:24 and if you uh haven't read this
[13:19] recently I just you know I was kind of
[13:21] shocked Again by it today it been a
[13:22] while since I read this and it came to
[13:24] pass by the way in the end that the Lord
[13:26] met him and sought to kill him God was
[13:29] seeking to kill
[13:31] Moses God was chasing Moses down brother
[13:34] Austin can you imagine you imagine God
[13:36] chasing me down to kill me not to bless
[13:39] me to kill me right yet he was the
[13:42] meekest man on Earth is that the
[13:44] scripture see how we need to be balanced
[13:46] in the scriptures Hallelujah we need to
[13:48] remember this now remember this is at
[13:49] the beginning of his ministry this is
[13:51] Exodus 4 he just met the burning
[13:55] bush just met the burning bush
[13:59] right and then he's getting ready to go
[14:00] down after this he go he goes to meet
[14:02] Aaron he's getting ready to go down to
[14:04] deliver uh Israel and God's coming to
[14:07] kill him because he hasn't circumcised
[14:10] his
[14:11] son see this is where we see
[14:14] neglect God sees our neglect right God
[14:18] sees our neglect but I love this this
[14:20] also is his grace in order to get him to
[14:23] obey the word of God hallelujah this is
[14:26] God's grace God could have just killed
[14:28] him right but we know the story who
[14:29] saved his life
[14:31] church that Ethiopian sweetheart of
[14:34] his Hallelujah that's right look at
[14:37] verse 25 then Zapora took a sharp Stone
[14:39] and cut off the foreskin of her son and
[14:41] cast it at his feet and said surely a
[14:43] bloody husband art thou to me now
[14:45] there's numerous uh interpretations of
[14:47] this some people say this is a positive
[14:48] thing some people say it's it's her kind
[14:50] of complaining I don't know so uh verse
[14:54] 26 so he let him go so the Lord let
[14:57] Moses go because his wife interceded for
[15:00] him talk about
[15:01] Grace now my wife saved my life on a
[15:04] couple of occasions but not like this
[15:06] Hallelujah I was choking one time and oh
[15:08] yeah I was choking twice and both times
[15:10] my wife saved
[15:12] me so I got I got a lot to be thankful
[15:14] for amen I could I can relate a little
[15:16] bit to Moses not all the way by God's
[15:20] grace but then she said a bloody husband
[15:23] Thou Art because of the circumcision so
[15:24] he neglected it all those
[15:26] years and it was God's grace that God
[15:29] gave him a wife who would step in and
[15:32] fulfill the circumcision the
[15:35] ceremony when he wouldn't she
[15:38] did see see Brothers some and I'll say
[15:41] to the married men and the brothers if
[15:42] you're not married you're going to be
[15:43] married Lord willing someday Brothers
[15:45] we're going to battle neglect God God's
[15:47] called us to be leaders but sometimes we
[15:49] neglect our
[15:50] duties God calls us to be strong men
[15:53] Faithful Men do the word of God leaders
[15:55] but sometimes we don't lead the right
[15:57] way and the brother said amen I'm not
[16:00] perfect I make mistakes I wish I was a
[16:02] better father a better husband a better
[16:04] Pastor uh than I am but I can be better
[16:08] if I humble myself
[16:10] Hallelujah and but I also want to
[16:12] recognize when there's times times when
[16:15] I neglect things times I don't obey the
[16:16] word of God I gotta remember God's grace
[16:19] will bring me out of it hallelujah amen
[16:21] glory brought Moses out it'll bring you
[16:24] out Hallelujah it'll bring us out if our
[16:26] hearts desires to be like Moses Brothers
[16:29] and sisters to be humble Meek Christians
[16:31] remember the meek inherit the earth amen
[16:34] the meek those who are humble realize
[16:36] they're nothing trusting God for
[16:38] everything those are the kind of people
[16:39] God's going to reward and give you a
[16:41] portion of this Earth in the Millennium
[16:43] Hallelujah and the future home those are
[16:47] the people God's going to reward those
[16:49] like Moses who do the will of God it
[16:51] wasn't perfect but neither are you and I
[16:54] Hallelujah there's only one perfect man
[16:56] that's the man Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[16:59] and he is now the high priest the
[17:00] mediator in heaven he's ever living to
[17:03] make intercession for your
[17:05] neglect amen or your mistakes or my
[17:08] mistakes he lives to do that praise God
[17:10] and that shows he's loving that shows
[17:12] he's merciful that shows he has Grace
[17:14] for us
[17:15] hallelujah
[17:18] amen go to James uh 4 verse5 there
[17:22] sister Olia you got your Bibles of
[17:24] course you guys all can go thank you
[17:26] this was just made fresh again to me
[17:29] I had forgotten you know I guess I just
[17:31] you know I'm human I'd forgotten that
[17:33] God is a jealous God even in the New
[17:35] Testament you know we always hear about
[17:37] the difference between the Old Testament
[17:38] New Testament I agree the New Testament
[17:40] is better promises but I forget many
[17:42] times how God is still jealous in the
[17:45] New Testament and here's the scripture
[17:48] that proves it James according to the
[17:49] the history James was the first one who
[17:51] wrote a book of the Bible in the New
[17:53] Testament he's the first one he was the
[17:55] leader of the church in Jerusalem
[17:57] remember he was uh I think the second
[17:58] Mar if I'm not mistaken if I'm not
[18:01] mistaken Stephen and then James if I'm
[18:02] not mistaken I could be wrong on that so
[18:05] I'm open to correction on that one
[18:07] please correct me you know after
[18:09] church now remember he's talking about
[18:11] in the first four verses uh he's like
[18:14] don't be don't have friendship with the
[18:16] world he says don't be an adulterer
[18:19] don't be a fornicator that means that
[18:21] means be true to your wedding vow you

[18:42] marriage Hallelujah God places such
[18:45] value on that it's a it's a great price
[18:48] in the sight of God
[18:50] hallelujah but here we see you know uh
[18:53] James says do you think that the
[18:54] scripture says in vain you think it's
[18:56] useless that God says the spirit that
[18:59] dwelleth in US lust us to Envy or is
[19:02] jealous you think the Bible just says
[19:04] that in vain like that's useless and
[19:06] remember he's talking about Christians
[19:08] they they'll go to church remember like
[19:09] they'll go to James's church but then
[19:11] they'll go a man he'll go sleep with
[19:12] another man's
[19:14] wife and James says don't you know that
[19:17] God's a jealous God shouldn't do that
[19:20] and some of the people would go down
[19:21] they would come to church James's Church
[19:23] they go out and then they'd worship
[19:24] other Idols they'd bow down to other
[19:25] idols and James says don't you know
[19:27] God's jealous don't you know God wants
[19:29] all your love and church doesn't he to
[19:32] deserve all your love he went to the
[19:34] Cross Hallelujah he conquered death Hell

[19:59] right but see James say don't you know
[20:02] you're a Christian Jesus Is God Jesus Is
[20:05] God hallelujah he's
[20:06] God uh remember uh in John 14 uh it was
[20:11] uh Phillip Philip said show us the
[20:13] father Jesus and he says have I been so
[20:16] long with you Philip that thou Hast not
[20:17] known me don't you know that I in the
[20:20] father and the father's in me amen
[20:23] hallelujah Thomas looked at his hands
[20:25] and said my Lord and my
[20:27] God Jesus Jesus Is God God is uh Emanuel
[20:31] is God Is With Us Amen Hallelujah Jesus
[20:34] was God In the Flesh Hallelujah God
[20:36] manifest In the Flesh and James says
[20:38] don't you know that Jesus is jealous of
[20:40] our love think about you husbands would
[20:42] you want your wives just going out and
[20:44] flirting with other men of course not
[20:46] would you wise want your husbands go
[20:47] flirting with other women of course not
[20:48] why because you're jealous of their love
[20:50] right in a in a Godly way you they
[20:53] promised to love you didn't you promise
[20:55] to love Jesus hallelujah amen
[20:58] good to see brother Mercy tonight
[20:59] brother God bless
[21:02] you that's a real treat to have you on a
[21:04] Wednesday night brother we have three
[21:06] special treats tonight what is it triple
[21:08] blessings I mean they just they keep
[21:10] pouring out on us all the time verse six
[21:13] so God's jealous even in the New
[21:15] Testament now but look even though God's
[21:18] jealous what does he do he knows we're
[21:19] not perfect what does he do he gives us
[21:21] more grace
[21:23] amen we might we might miss the
[21:26] Mark we might uh make God offended the
[21:30] Bible said the Bible said you can offend
[21:31] the Holy Spirit grieve not the Holy
[21:34] Spirit but see because of that we don't
[21:37] lose our Salvation what he does he gives
[21:39] us more grace Hallelujah Grace to try it
[21:42] again Hallelujah and not fail this
[21:45] time gives us more
[21:47] grace that's why I love when The
[21:49] Headstone came back in Zechariah 4 they
[21:51] were shouting Grace Grace amen it was
[21:55] just emphasizing we need an extra
[21:57] portion of Grace Hallelujah everyone
[21:59] look the Bible says he gives more grace
[22:02] amen even to that original early church
[22:05] right some people in that early church
[22:07] remember the Bible said in James 2 some
[22:08] people in that early
[22:10] church when a rich person would walk in
[22:12] they would push out the poor people oh
[22:14] no I'm sorry you got to move let let's
[22:16] let these people with the the nice
[22:17] garments let and the big rings and the
[22:19] fancy hat let's let them sit right up
[22:20] here in front the early church got
[22:22] caught up in that sometimes but what
[22:25] does God do he gives us more
[22:27] grace Hallelujah and church let's just
[22:30] be humble however God wants to send us
[22:32] to the correction let's just receive
[22:34] it right like brother said brother BR
[22:37] said my wife is my correction so who's
[22:39] the one that corrected brother Brandon
[22:40] the most his wife who corrects me the
[22:42] most my wife Hallelujah right who
[22:46] corrects you the most well you fill in
[22:47] the blank amen but let's receive
[22:50] correction wherever it comes
[22:52] Hallelujah because we know it's God's
[22:54] love to us it's God giving us more grace
[22:56] so we can be right Hallelujah because
[22:58] that's what we want to be we want to be
[22:59] right not for our righteousness but for
[23:02] the glory of
[23:05] God see wherefore he sayith God resists
[23:08] the
[23:09] proud see but giveth Grace unto the
[23:13] humble
[23:14] Hallelujah all right now now I could be
[23:18] wrong on this but it looks like three
[23:20] times God could have killed Moses I
[23:22] could be wrong on this but just hear me
[23:24] up after he killed that man when he was
[23:27] 40 years old God could have killed him
[23:30] remember that in Egypt remember that
[23:32] church God could have killed
[23:35] him next time he didn't circumcise his
[23:37] son God could have killed
[23:40] him think about that a prophet of
[23:43] God a prophet of God could have been
[23:46] killed by God but God showed
[23:49] what and now I don't think it's in the
[23:51] Bible but brother Ram said about the one
[23:53] I read earlier about uh Moses smiting
[23:55] The Rock in numbers 20:10 brother said
[23:58] God should have killed him or could have
[23:59] killed him now that might have been an
[24:00] exaggeration I don't know but let's say
[24:02] it wasn't let's say God could have done
[24:03] that that would have been three times
[24:05] God could have killed him but God showed
[24:07] Mercy every time how many times have we
[24:09] fallen short of God's glory but yet God
[24:11] has shown us more grace
[24:13] Hallelujah we might have to sing uh the
[24:17] uh The Reckless Love of God but it's not
[24:19] Reckless we we don't call it Reckless
[24:21] what do we call it the precious love of
[24:22] God we might have to sing that at the
[24:23] end right because we don't deserve it
[24:26] but God still God's love gets poured out
[24:28] on us
[24:29] amen right it's just the love of God
[24:31] it's an expression of God's grace and
[24:33] love that's who he is God is love amen
[24:37] he's just expressing his character to us
[24:38] aren't you glad amen that if we fall
[24:41] short he gives us more grace Hallelujah
[24:44] he doesn't take the grace away and say
[24:45] no I'm done with you no I'm gonna give
[24:47] you more Grace I'm not going to give you
[24:48] what you deserve I'm Gonna Give You
[24:50] Grace oh my the B David said that in the
[24:53] Book of Psalms remember that David said
[24:55] you've not given unto us what we deserve
[24:59] H Allelujah now I'm just adding my words
[25:01] there that's not the official King James
[25:03] version I'm kind of just guessing on the
[25:05] words there out of memory but you
[25:07] understand that so what do we see we see
[25:10] God you know he has a right to be angry
[25:13] sometimes right but the Bible said his
[25:15] anger won't last forever amen glory to
[25:18] God hallelujah he was mad at
[25:21] Moses right at least once we can prove
[25:24] it by the scripture right when he when
[25:26] he just failed to do the circumcision
[25:28] God was going to kill
[25:30] him now what about us parents parents
[25:32] how how careful we should be to make
[25:34] sure we raise our children the right way
[25:36] I'm looking at the parents right we
[25:37] should be we should be so careful
[25:39] right and and we are but many times we
[25:42] need reminders
[25:43] right I like I like God's grace God
[25:46] God's grace gives us a chance to reset
[25:49] right let's start this over again let's
[25:50] try this again like I told you I just
[25:52] recently uh hit the reset button on some
[25:54] of the standards in our house I just had
[25:55] to reset it last month I appreciate that
[25:58] I'm glad I'm glad God can show me things
[26:00] where I need to be corrected I'm glad
[26:02] God Loves Me Like That amen I'm glad for
[26:05] the precious love of God hallelujah
[26:08] amen see and there's times God gets
[26:11] angry but his anger won't last forever
[26:13] the Bible says
[26:15] hallelujah so if this is true you know
[26:17] at least two or three times God could
[26:19] have killed Moses but God showed Moses
[26:22] Grace and then God put him in the Hall
[26:25] of Fame of faith in Hebrews
[26:27] 11 what
[26:28] a man who should have been killed God
[26:30] May puts in the Hall of Fame yeah that
[26:32] that that's the kind of God we serve
[26:34] amen a God who takes the the nothings
[26:36] and the uh The God Who takes the former
[26:38] murders and he makes them real children
[26:40] of God hallelujah glory to God Amen see
[26:44] Church there's hope for us amen there's
[26:46] great hope for us hallelujah that if we
[26:49] continue to live by faith and not walk
[26:51] by sight but walk by faith if we
[26:53] continue to walk by faith and receive
[26:55] more of God's grace then God has great
[26:57] precious promises in store for us amen
[27:00] if we can just endure the light
[27:02] afflictions Paul tells us in second
[27:04] Corinthians if we can just endure those
[27:06] then we will have such a greater weight
[27:08] of Glory waiting for us in heaven
[27:11] hallelujah
[27:13] amen and if all we get is a white robe
[27:16] that'll be enough for me brother
[27:18] Mercy if I if my mansion's small or I my
[27:21] Mansion gets deleted that's fine as long
[27:22] as I get to be there with Jesus
[27:24] Hallelujah that's all I want amen all I
[27:26] get is a white robe if all I get is
[27:27] eternal life and I don't get a crown
[27:29] just let me be with Jesus throughout all
[27:31] eternity Amen Let Me worship the one who
[27:33] died for me and changed my life amen and
[27:36] gave me extra Grace despite my failures
[27:38] hallelujah praise God Amen that's the
[27:41] God I serve amen the God who gives more
[27:45] grace so this is a new testament
[27:47] confirmation you know that that God is
[27:50] jealous over our time right we've been
[27:52] preaching about you know men overcoming
[27:55] uh pornography right God's jealous over
[27:57] that time
[27:58] God's jealous what you look at on your
[28:00] phone God's jealous of that he's jealous
[28:04] what the songs you sing you should only
[28:05] sing for Jesus Hallelujah God's jealous
[28:08] of what you watch you should only watch
[28:09] Christian movies Hallelujah right God's
[28:13] jealous right because uh Jesus said if a
[28:16] man looks on a woman lust he's already
[28:18] committed the act in his mind and every
[28:20] movie has one of those scenes in it well
[28:22] almost every
[28:24] movie and I remember this as a young
[28:26] Christian imagine this 20 I became a
[28:28] Christian 24 years ago when I became a
[28:30] new Christian I watched a video where
[28:31] even in the dis the old Disney movies
[28:33] the cartoons they would put immoral
[28:35] pictures right in there they was just
[28:37] flashing in there it's like the
[28:38] subliminal message you couldn't even
[28:40] watch I think it was Rescuers Down Under
[28:42] if I'm not mistaken they put uh an
[28:45] x-rated picture right there and you can
[28:46] see it right in the I itan just flashes
[28:48] before you I mean this is what the devil
[28:51] does he takes something that looks good
[28:53] but he sneaks some sin in there but
[28:55] remember that cartoon doesn't glorify
[28:57] Jesus doesn't teach you to love Jesus
[29:00] but the Bible teaches you to love Jesus
[29:01] Hallelujah you are created to love Jesus
[29:04] amen hallelujah you weren't created to
[29:06] love Disney you're created to love Jesus
[29:08] Christ
[29:09] hallelujah
[29:12] amen so God gave Moses more
[29:18] grace
[29:20] Hallelujah now there's a few more things
[29:22] I want to say I'm going to read this uh
[29:29] uh brother Bram makes this uh
[29:31] observation and when I say brother Bram
[29:33] it's just like quoting Billy Graham or
[29:34] something like that or Martin Luther you
[29:36] know I I've written a book I wrote about
[29:38] Martin Luther John Wesley uh all all
[29:42] those uh wonderful
[29:57] iranusatensions he said Moses wanted to
[29:59] show he had a little authority a little
[30:00] power so he Saidi bring you water this
[30:02] rock he said God should have killed him
[30:05] for
[30:05] it God should have separated him that he
[30:08] broke God's law right there and notice
[30:11] he smoted it twice and the Bible said
[30:13] that rock in the wilderness was who that
[30:16] rock was
[30:18] Christ right and so see even in Moses's
[30:23] failure God uses failure to point to
[30:26] something that The Rock was going to to
[30:28] be smitten
[30:30] twice once physical now this is a little
[30:32] deeper here once physical as Jesus was
[30:34] smitten on the cross and once spiritual
[30:38] at the end
[30:40] time how many believe that by God's
[30:42] grace and we're going to show you the
[30:44] scripture go to Hebrews
[30:52] 6 Hebrews 6
[30:55] ver6 people think oh Jesus he could not
[30:58] be crucified again well not physically
[31:00] of course but spiritually even so many
[31:03] churches are crucifying the word of
[31:06] Christ today we would say in other words
[31:08] they're speaking evil they're
[31:10] blaspheming against the word of
[31:12] God the Bible says You must repent of
[31:14] your sin and if a church says no you
[31:16] don't have to repent God just accepts
[31:17] you as you are that's that's crucifying
[31:20] the word if if if the church says well
[31:22] God doesn't do Miracles anymore they've
[31:24] just crucified the
[31:26] word they put him to a an open shame
[31:29] right because they're going against the
[31:30] word of God
[31:33] hallelujah Hebrews 6:6 if they shall
[31:36] fall away to renew them again unto
[31:37] repentance seeing they what do they do
[31:39] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[31:43] God aresh and put him to an open shame
[31:46] now we believe the writer of Hebrews was
[31:48] Paul but I'm not going to argue with it
[31:49] it doesn't say I'm not going to argue
[31:50] with anybody but it it fits all of his
[31:52] previous writings but but the point is
[31:55] Paul's saying people today they can uh
[31:58] when they when they deny the word of God
[32:01] it's as if they're crucifying the Son of
[32:03] God another
[32:05] time right that's what the Bible
[32:08] says so we must be very careful to
[32:11] believe all the word of God to accept
[32:14] all the truth of God's word
[32:16] amen you know some people don't believe
[32:19] in uh Mark chapter
[32:21] 16 let me go there uh Mark 16 I believe
[32:24] it's verse
[32:26] 15 I just want to just give those
[32:29] examples if people say these things
[32:30] don't exist anymore well you're a little
[32:32] too late to tell me that because I've
[32:33] seen almost all these before in my life
[32:35] amen a little too late to tell me that
[32:37] that uh these Supernatural things don't
[32:39] happen anymore if they say these
[32:41] Supernatural things don't happen they're
[32:43] crucifying the Son of God aresh they're
[32:45] putting him to an open shame because
[32:47] openly they're preaching it from their
[32:48] pulpits oh God doesn't speak in tongues
[32:49] anymore God doesn't heal the sick uh God
[32:52] doesn't do these Miracles they're
[32:53] crucifying aresh the Son of God remember
[32:57] that had to be because Moses Smit The
[32:59] Rock twice he smoted it I'm sorry SMI
[33:00] Smith's not of work he smoted it twice
[33:03] sorry and I teach English too for a
[33:09] living I teach it for my profession and
[33:12] I can't get it right sometimes see how
[33:14] God has
[33:16] Grace go into all the world and preach
[33:18] the gospel to Every Creature next verse
[33:20] 16 he that believeth in is baptized
[33:23] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[33:24] shall be damn leave it up there now now
[33:26] there's are cases where people can't get
[33:28] baptized if they're dying on their death
[33:29] bed and they they and God will save them
[33:32] but if they have a chance and someone
[33:33] will say oh no I don't have to be
[33:35] baptized they're crucifying the Son of
[33:37] God aresh because Jesus
[33:39] said he that believeth and is baptized
[33:41] shall be
[33:42] saved
[33:44] right and and if they say you don't got
[33:46] to repent they they they broke into acts
[33:48] 238 where Peter said repent and be
[33:50] baptized every one of you in the name of
[33:53] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[33:56] remission means sending away so you got
[33:58] to repent of your sins and God will send
[34:00] your sins away and that'll make you the
[34:02] happiest person you've ever been I know
[34:05] because I've experienced said amen I was
[34:07] told I told that to Malachi this week I
[34:08] said the second happiest day of my life
[34:10] was when I married your mother I smiled
[34:13] so much my cheeks hurt oh man I think
[34:15] when I was uh I was waiting there I
[34:18] think I was like massaging my cheeks to
[34:19] make him to try to take some of the pain
[34:21] away but the happiest day of my life is
[34:24] when I finally repented of my sins and I
[34:26] said Jesus I'm not living for the world
[34:27] anymore Jesus I'm Living For You
[34:29] Hallelujah that was the happiest day of
[34:31] my life
[34:36] Hallelujah so uh next verse eight or 17
[34:39] and these signs shall follow them that
[34:41] believe in my name they shall cast out
[34:42] Devils I've cast out devil seven
[34:45] times people but if anybody says oh you
[34:48] can't do that that's not real they've
[34:50] just crucified the Son of God a fresh
[34:52] that spoke of Moses smiting it
[34:54] twice Jesus was smitten on Calvary 2
[34:57] years ago and he's being smitten today
[34:59] why are they smiting him today because
[35:01] the Antichrist is going to
[35:02] rise right they're all they're going to
[35:04] bring all the world religions together
[35:06] and then they're going to say you can't
[35:07] buy or sell unless you you take this
[35:10] Mark we just saw at the Republican
[35:12] National Convention how many saw that
[35:14] they opened up with a Hindu woman uh
[35:17] from California praying to the one true
[35:19] God and it was a Hindu god it wasn't
[35:23] Jesus and while she prayed to the Hindu
[35:25] god they had crosses up here and they
[35:27] had uh uh they had the the Star of David
[35:30] over here all the symbols of all the
[35:32] religions because they're trying to
[35:34] promote this one world religion I'm
[35:36] sorry I'm not trying to be different but
[35:37] that's blasphemy there's only one true
[35:39] God and his name is Jesus Christ
[35:41] Hallelujah that's what the Bible tells
[35:43] us there's only one true God hallelujah
[35:46] but see that's the they're already
[35:47] pushing that one world religion to the
[35:49] Republican party and I'm not democrat or
[35:51] republican I voted a long time ago I
[35:53] voted for Jesus Hallelujah that's the
[35:55] sign I got in my front yard 2020 24
[35:58] Jesus is our only hope
[36:00] amen hallelujah now I'll vote probably
[36:02] Republican right because I always do but
[36:05] it's it's ultimately in God's hands amen
[36:08] God will raise up whatever leader he
[36:09] wants and he'll pull down the other ones
[36:11] amen so all we can do is go say pray God
[36:13] give us the Right leader Hallelujah his
[36:15] timing is perfect he's right all the
[36:17] time we're wrong all the time God's
[36:18] right
[36:19] amen
[36:21] hallelujah see this is how they
[36:23] crucified Jesus today
[36:26] churches Jesus said in John or I'm sorry
[36:28] Jesus said in Matthew 7:14 broad is the
[36:31] way that leads to destruction and many
[36:33] go there on he said but narrow is the
[36:35] way that leads to life and few everybody
[36:38] say few few there be that find it Jesus
[36:40] said very few people out of these eight
[36:42] billion very few are going to find it
[36:45] what's a few out of eight billion I
[36:46] don't know maybe a million I don't know
[36:48] half a million Jesus said few there be
[36:52] that find it Hallelujah so thank God
[36:54] that we found the narrow road that leads
[36:56] to life I found that road and that road
[36:58] is named Jesus because he's the way he's
[37:01] the road amen he's the way the truth and
[37:03] the life Hallelujah no man comes under
[37:05] the father except through Jesus Christ
[37:07] Hallelujah that's right thank
[37:10] God uh they shall speak with new tongues
[37:13] I've heard speaking in tongues my whole
[37:15] life amen we've heard in our church six
[37:17] times by God's grace speaking in tonu is
[37:19] real now there's a lot of impersonations
[37:21] of it there's a lot of wrong but there
[37:22] is a genuine real one Hallelujah and if
[37:26] they say there's not they're cruci
[37:27] ifying the Son of God aresh 18 and this
[37:30] is what Moses was speaking of Christ was
[37:32] the rock we'll show that in a little bit
[37:34] and they shall take up serpents and if
[37:35] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[37:37] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[37:38] sick and they shall recover I just saw
[37:39] this out in Iowa a couple weeks ago
[37:41] remember that testimony that young
[37:42] mother the doctor said uh all your
[37:44] arteries are clogged up and you don't
[37:46] have much time to live I I don't
[37:48] remember all the details but I just
[37:49] prayed for her and the next day Monday
[37:51] she went back or two days later she went
[37:53] back and she had another EKG and she
[37:55] said her heart was completely f
[37:59] and she's a nurse Hallelujah I just laid
[38:02] hands on the sick and they recover just
[38:04] like Jesus said amen it wasn't me it
[38:06] wasn't my ability I just did what he
[38:08] said that's all Moses can do that's all
[38:10] you and I can do just do what Jesus says
[38:15] hallelujah now we don't take up serpents
[38:17] that means you get bit by a serpent
[38:18] while you're out doing the work of God
[38:21] right just like Paul remember on the
[38:22] island of Mita it bit him he threw it
[38:24] off in the fire that's what we got to do
[38:26] now remember that we just got to cast
[38:27] down anything that bites you just cast
[38:29] it down and move on
[38:30] Amen evil thought bites you just throw
[38:32] it down keep moving on
[38:35] Hallelujah Glory now what verse did I
[38:38] say I want to bring up I already forgot
[38:42] it yes thank you hey buddy got great job
[38:46] First Corinthians 10 great
[38:48] job
[38:49] proud so proud of you
[38:52] buddy 1 Corinthians 10 not in a prideful
[38:55] way you know uh in a humble way
[38:59] Glory ah verse four and did and all did
[39:03] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[39:05] drank of that spiritual rock that foued
[39:07] them and that rock was
[39:09] Christ Christ was the rock that Moses
[39:12] smoked right and he smoked it once it
[39:15] didn't bring water he smoked it twice
[39:17] and then it brought out
[39:19] water Hallelujah see that's what that
[39:21] represented even in Moses's failure God
[39:24] uses our failures to glorify him Church
[39:26] don't we know Romans 28 that God will
[39:28] make all things work together for our
[39:30] good because we love him and we're
[39:32] called according to his purpose amen we
[39:34] ought to know that by now amen God will
[39:36] take our mistakes amen and it'll make it
[39:38] glorify him
[39:42] Hallelujah I I know this as a fact in
[39:45] all my mistakes as a pastor or father or
[39:47] husband I always see how I learn
[39:49] something very valuable from that now
[39:51] sometimes I even forget it and I need to
[39:53] be reminded again but I know in some of
[39:55] my biggest mistakes I'm like oh that's
[39:56] right I know I shouldn't have done that
[39:58] now and it's it's just amazing it's like
[40:00] the holy spirit will bring those things
[40:02] to my remembrance right when I need them
[40:04] not to repeat that same mistake twice
[40:07] what is that that's God giving me more
[40:09] grace I don't deserve it I didn't earn
[40:12] it but it's God giving us more grace
[40:16] because he's a loving God he's a god of
[40:19] Second Chances third chances fourth
[40:21] chances he's the god of 490 chances
[40:25] because Peter said I'll forgive seven
[40:27] times Lord he said 70 times seven amen
[40:31] he's the god of 490 chances
[40:34] hallelujah oh my we know there's many
[40:36] more than
[40:37] that now remember Church you
[40:41] know we and I'll say like this I pull up
[40:43] Galatians 2:20 I preached this a few
[40:45] years ago at one of our Easter services
[40:48] I'm sorry Good Friday services and I
[40:50] said this I brought up the scripture and
[40:52] I showed
[40:53] how just a simple idea you and we will
[40:58] either crucify Christ
[41:00] and or or we crucify our own will so
[41:05] there's going to be a crucifixion in our
[41:07] lives one or the
[41:08] other Hallelujah so we must make the
[41:11] decision I'm going to Crucify My sinful
[41:14] desires every day I'm gonna die to
[41:18] myself look what Paul said what did Paul
[41:20] said Paul said I am crucified with
[41:23] Christ amen hallelujah
[41:27] nevertheless I still
[41:30] live now the other verse says he dies
[41:32] daily we'll pull up that one next
[41:34] remember that brother
[41:36] Austin yet thank you sir yet not I but
[41:40] Christ liveth in me so the only way
[41:42] Christ can live in US is if we crucify
[41:45] the Bible said the lust and the
[41:47] affections thereof every day I told this
[41:51] to Malachi I've told this to my children
[41:53] my family every day I got to crucify the
[41:56] lust of the eyes
[41:57] the lust of the flesh your body wants
[41:59] something you you're not supposed to
[42:00] have or the pride of life you want to
[42:03] chase that Almighty dollar every day
[42:05] it's like you go to bed you got the
[42:06] victory you wake up and there it is and
[42:08] you got to crucify it again I just wish
[42:10] you would stay dead
[42:12] amen right just wish you'd stay dead but
[42:16] no we got to be like Jesus we got to be
[42:18] like Paul told us and we we must crucify
[42:20] our desires and our and and we must
[42:24] learn to be a real disciple of Jesus
[42:25] Christ we must take up our cross and
[42:27] follow Jesus Hallelujah just like he
[42:30] took up the cross for us
[42:32] hallelujah he said the life which I Live
[42:34] Now In the Flesh I live by the faith of
[42:37] the Son of God see you don't live by
[42:39] your faith you live by Christ's faith we
[42:42] already read it in Ephesians 2 Faith is
[42:44] a gift of God see you live by Christ's
[42:47] Faith Christ Christ gives you the
[42:49] anointing of his
[42:50] faith who loved me and gave himself for
[42:53] me Church you are loved by God
[42:56] tonight you're loved by God he gave
[42:58] himself for you right that he might he
[43:01] might uh save you and then he might uh
[43:04] make you zealous over your the purpose
[43:06] for your
[43:08] life not for somebody else's life for
[43:10] your life don't try to be like anybody
[43:13] else now you can find somebody in the
[43:14] Bible if they got your same gift and
[43:15] your same calling amen but don't patter
[43:18] yourself I gotta be like that guy I
[43:19] gotta be like that you got to be exactly
[43:21] who God made you to be Hallelujah just
[43:24] be yourself just be who God made you to
[43:26] be praise God everything will work out
[43:28] now Die daily I didn't forget this time
[43:30] 1 Corinthians
[43:32] 15 we're already in chapter 10 that
[43:34] worked out pretty good but my
[43:37] Bible there it is uh 10:31 I'm sorry
[43:40] 1531 sorry
[43:44] 1531 I protest by your rejoicing which I
[43:47] have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die
[43:50] daily he said I'm crucified with
[43:54] Christ and I must die every single day
[43:59] so church now we can plainly see why
[44:01] Moses had to Smite The Rock
[44:05] twice right he had to be smitten on
[44:08] Calvary and at the last time he had to
[44:10] be smitten because the world's going to
[44:12] reject him the world's going to crucify
[44:13] him and they're going to accept the
[44:14] Antichrist think about that he's going
[44:16] to sit in the temple of God he's going
[44:17] to sit in the rebuilt Jewish temple
[44:19] whenever gets rebuilt and he's going to
[44:21] declare that he is God and exalting
[44:23] himself above all that's called God and
[44:24] they're going to want that rather than
[44:26] Christ
[44:28] Jesus that's right that's what the Bible
[44:30] said he's got to be crucified at the end
[44:33] time right but we'll know the Bible says
[44:36] we have wisdom to know that
[44:38] Antichrist hallelujah we're not all left
[44:41] without a witness we're not all helpless
[44:42] or hopeless we've got the wisdom of the
[44:44] Holy Spirit Hallelujah his number 666 is
[44:48] is easily found by vicarius and I can't
[44:50] say that fil day you know how to say it
[44:53] fil day that means Vicor of the son of
[44:56] God
[44:58] who's the Vicor of the Son of God the
[44:59] pope of Rome right the vicer that's what
[45:02] that's his title Vicor of the Son of God
[45:05] that means he's the substitute for the
[45:06] Son of God no he's not no he's not most
[45:10] of all his teachings are outside of what
[45:11] Jesus said Hallelujah I don't have time
[45:14] to go into that but I got videos on that
[45:15] if you want to listen to that one about
[45:17] God's grace I just put them out last
[45:19] week
[45:22] all
[45:24] so and three times you know God's Propet
[45:27] brother brandom said that uh Christ was
[45:29] going to be crucified a second
[45:31] time right we see that because he's
[45:33] going to be rejected Christ is going to
[45:35] be rejected uh the Bible said there must
[45:38] become a great Falling Away first
[45:39] remember that verse second I think it's
[45:41] second Timothy 3 let's read that so
[45:43] that's that's the falling away they're
[45:45] going to crucify and put him to an open
[45:47] shame I think it's second Timothy 3
[45:59] well this I'm sorry this is this will
[46:00] work but I'll I'll find the other one
[46:02] too uh 2 Timothy
[46:04] 3:1 this know also that in the last days
[46:07] perilous that means Troublesome how how
[46:09] many know we got trouble in America
[46:11] there's trouble all around the
[46:13] world perilous time shall come for men
[46:15] should be lovers of their own selves
[46:17] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[46:19] disobedient to parents see children need
[46:21] to obey their parents the Bible says
[46:23] that will be a condition of the end time
[46:26] unth thank ful Unholy they don't live a
[46:28] separated life under god without natural
[46:31] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[46:33] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[46:36] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[46:38] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[46:41] God having a form of godliness but
[46:43] denying the power thereof from such turn
[46:46] away all
[46:48] right that's the first one no notice in
[46:51] the last times all these conditions are
[46:53] going to happen in church these things
[46:55] are found in churches
[46:57] right we don't find these just out in
[46:59] this out in the world this is found in
[47:01] the
[47:01] churches right they love Pleasures more
[47:04] than lovers of God if the pastor
[47:05] preaches longer than 15 minutes I'm
[47:07] walking out of the church you've already
[47:09] sat through 45 minutes God bless
[47:12] you right they don't sing my song I'm
[47:15] complaining to the Deacon
[47:18] board just they just love love
[47:20] themselves more than they love
[47:22] God you know they they'll build I'll say
[47:25] like this they'll build themselves a
[47:26] million dollar house but how much are
[47:27] they giv to the missionary World it
[47:29] won't put nothing in the missionary
[47:31] plate building up your retirement what
[47:33] about the kingdom of
[47:35] God got to give themselves a pool and a
[47:38] sauna and all these things and if you
[47:40] just got rid of the pool you could to
[47:41] send that $10,000 and give a a church uh
[47:45] food for a whole month or two months but
[47:48] you've got to have your swimming pool I
[47:49] don't know why I'm preaching on swimming
[47:50] pools maybe I'll find out tonight maybe
[47:54] somebody will send me a message on
[47:55] YouTube um thanks for I was just going
[47:57] to buy a pool no I'm not going to buy a
[47:59] pool wouldn't that be great
[48:03] Hallelujah I think the other one if I'm
[48:05] not this is my memory now I'm going by
[48:06] memory so forgive me uh 2 Thessalonians
[48:08] chapter 2 it's right before Timothy
[48:10] second Thessalonians I believe this is
[48:12] the Fall Away brother William it might
[48:14] be he's saying amen so hopefully we're
[48:16] both right here yeah there it is verse
[48:18] three yes sir second Timothy 2:3 this is
[48:21] speaking of the
[48:23] Antichrist let no man deceive you by any
[48:26] means see don't any preacher deceive you
[48:28] make sure he's preaching the word of God
[48:30] for that day shall not come except there
[48:32] come a falling away first there it is
[48:34] there's that crucifying Christ a second
[48:36] time just like Moses showed
[48:40] us and that man of sins that's the
[48:43] Antichrist the son of predition means
[48:47] destruction who opposes and exalts
[48:50] himself above all that is called God or
[48:53] that is worshiped so that he is God sth
[48:55] in the temple of God
[48:57] showing himself that he is
[48:59] God so there is coming an antichrist
[49:02] he's going to sit in the Jewish temple
[49:04] once it's rebuilt and he whatever he
[49:05] says he's going to magnify himself above
[49:07] the Bible above Jesus
[49:10] Christ Hallelujah but in order for this
[49:12] to happen the churches have to fall away
[49:14] from the truth they have to crucify the
[49:16] Son of God in order to receive the son
[49:18] of predition think about
[49:20] that they're going to
[49:22] crucify the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[49:25] spiritual realm not the physical
[49:26] everybody catch that he's not going to
[49:28] be crucified a second time physically
[49:30] it's going to be
[49:32] spiritually but you and I are not going
[49:33] to do that we're going to crucify our
[49:35] fleshly sinful desires and we're going
[49:37] to live by the faith of Jesus Christ
[49:40] Hallelujah God help us I imagine we're
[49:43] get some good preaching on that this
[49:44] weekend so I'm looking forward to that
[49:46] he's going to come in here and preach on
[49:47] crucify with Christ or
[49:49] something God can do whatever he wants
[49:51] I'm just I'm hope I'm hoping by God's
[49:54] grace amen
[49:57] now I want to read a story where uh
[49:58] brother brandom tells a story this is
[49:59] from 1963 where he let God down you
[50:02] might remember
[50:04] this there was a woman brother R prayed
[50:07] for um and God healed her temporarily
[50:11] but then she went in the hospital and
[50:12] she died and she was a young mother she
[50:14] had at least one child remember do you
[50:16] remember this story um and the woman
[50:19] died and brother R was all confused and
[50:21] he tells us the story he says Lord God
[50:23] you owe me an
[50:25] understanding after me go going out
[50:27] there and telling that husband and him
[50:29] coming to the Lord after You' done these
[50:30] things for him and all like that and
[50:32] then you take his wife like
[50:35] that so brother Rah was upset Lord uh
[50:39] you just saved this wife's husband and
[50:41] now you took his wife you owe me an
[50:44] understanding brother Braham said when
[50:47] you tell God something like that he's
[50:49] going to leave you sitting alone now
[50:51] think about Moses right Moses neglected
[50:54] to circumcise his son and God was going
[50:56] to come after after him kill
[50:58] him brother Brandon speaks in a prideful
[51:00] way and says God you owe me something
[51:02] and God left him he said for a couple
[51:04] days we even couldn't even feel the
[51:06] couldn't even feel the spirit of God for
[51:08] a couple
[51:09] days see because we get prideful right
[51:11] we say things shouldn't say right we get
[51:16] prideful uh we think we know something
[51:18] we think we we deserve something right
[51:20] God owes God doesn't owe us
[51:22] nothing God doesn't owe you and I God
[51:25] doesn't owe me anything
[51:27] right because he already paid it all he
[51:29] already gave me everything he already
[51:31] gave me eternal life Hallelujah he
[51:33] already gave me forgiveness of all my
[51:34] sins
[51:36] Hallelujah he says he don't owe me
[51:39] nothing now this is the Old Kentucky
[51:41] grammar from n 1963 he don't owe me
[51:44] nothing I'm in debt to him well God just
[51:47] let me pout it out for a few days you
[51:50] know so brother R Likens himself to a
[51:52] little baby pouting see that's how
[51:54] humble brother Brandon was I was just
[51:56] like a baby pouting God why don't I feel
[51:57] your presence all these days are going
[52:00] by I don't feel you I don't feel like
[52:01] you're talking to me and God had to show
[52:03] him it's because you exalted
[52:06] yourself sound like
[52:08] Moses sound like anyone familiar you
[52:10] know that sometimes exalts themselves
[52:13] and says prideful things oh you don't
[52:15] have to say Amen but you know who it
[52:17] is it's you it's
[52:22] me like God why didn't you heal this
[52:24] person why did this person die right
[52:27] and and we might say it out loud now
[52:28] surely we think it but God keep us from
[52:30] saying it out loud help me not to think
[52:32] that Lord forgive me Jesus you know I
[52:34] trust you especially when tragedies
[52:37] happen that's when we're most tempted to
[52:41] speak against God because we think we
[52:43] want we think our life should go our way
[52:45] rather than God's
[52:47] way God has a perfect
[52:49] plan remember the Bible says people
[52:51] don't consider when people die
[52:53] tragically people don't consider that
[52:55] God is sparing them from an awful future
[52:58] where's that verse anybody remember that
[53:01] verse I don't have it on my I don't have
[53:04] it up here right now people don't
[53:06] consider that they don't consider that
[53:09] but God in his Mercy he knows the right
[53:10] time to take people right he took his
[53:13] own son after 33
[53:16] years and he never sinned he never did
[53:19] anything wrong yet God's timing is
[53:21] perfect he works at the pace of
[53:25] perfection the church said brother
[53:27] Aaron's sermon still with
[53:30] you everybody still got your first love
[53:33] Brother Paul's sermon still with
[53:35] you
[53:37] Hallelujah well he just let me pot it
[53:39] out for a few days and after about three
[53:41] or four months one day I was sitting on
[53:43] the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me
[53:44] in a vision and said now go to her
[53:47] mother and say this to her mother did
[53:49] not her time to die come the year before
[53:52] that when she was drowning in a creek at
[53:55] a picnic
[53:57] so the Lord show brother Bram that
[53:58] mother should have died a year ago she
[54:00] was swimming and she was drowning in the
[54:01] water but God spared her life for one
[54:04] more year to spare her and then also
[54:07] save her
[54:08] husband see so God gave her extra year
[54:11] of
[54:13] Mercy Hallelujah see he he didn't know
[54:16] that when he said you owe me uh this
[54:18] doesn't make sense this is not the way I
[54:19] thought it should go he wasn't thinking
[54:21] that when he said that he didn't know
[54:23] that church there's a lot of things we
[54:25] don't know the Bible says God's thoughts
[54:27] are higher than our thoughts his ways
[54:30] are so much higher than our
[54:32] ways he knows just how to do it amen he
[54:37] knows just how to design your life my
[54:39] life he knows exactly what to do at just
[54:41] exactly the right time he doesn't need
[54:43] to be questioned he needs to be
[54:45] worshiped he needs to be
[54:50] believed that's what he
[54:54] deserves man brother man say the Lord
[54:56] told him she should have went out and
[54:58] gone to heaven at that time but I had to
[55:00] take her when she was ready to go so she
[55:03] herself wasn't ready she would have went
[55:05] to hell and she drowned
[55:07] there but God gave her another year to
[55:09] get right that's the God we serve amen a
[55:13] god who's rich in
[55:14] Mercy he said then I got down and cried
[55:17] imagine brother getting down and PR he
[55:18] said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor
[55:20] stupid servant I should have never said
[55:23] that
[55:24] Lord a servant of God who's preached all
[55:26] his life and dedicate his whole life to
[55:28] Jesus Christ he said Lord I'm so sorry I
[55:30] should not have said that I'm just poor
[55:31] I'm just a poor stupid person sometimes
[55:34] Church don't we feel like that way some
[55:35] way we're just don't don't you feel like
[55:37] Paul sometimes I'm the chief of all
[55:39] Sinners I feel like Paul sometimes Lord
[55:42] why am I such a failure why do I fall
[55:44] short in this why Lord forgive me but
[55:47] Lord it keeps us humble and it makes us
[55:48] more like Moses Hallelujah remembering
[55:51] the grace of God REM remembering that
[55:54] God wants to pour out an extra portion
[55:57] of Grace upon us how be thankful for
[55:59] God's Amazing
[56:01] Grace
[56:03] Hallelujah I think I'll close in just a
[56:05] moment here let me
[56:07] uh I think I'll close with this
[56:09] here go to Romans 4 this a for scripture
[56:12] but I'm going to close with this Romans
[56:15] chapter
[56:18] 4 keep your
[56:24] spot at verse I'm going to read this
[56:26] quotation again from William
[56:35] brandham I just want to read this
[56:37] briefly I'm almost at an hour I'm at 53
[56:39] minutes think of that 53 minutes on a
[56:40] Wednesday night I'm talking about
[56:42] closing
[56:44] already
[56:46] um before we read Romans
[56:49] 4 brother Bram said a man walked up you
[56:52] and said uh he was attacking God he said
[56:54] brother Bram God is unjust God because
[56:57] he let Moses down he said Moses toiled
[57:00] with those Hebrews for 40 years in the
[57:02] wilderness and let him down because he
[57:04] wouldn't let him go into the promised
[57:06] land so see a man's attacking God to
[57:09] brother
[57:11] brandham what does brother Ram say
[57:13] brother Ram said oh
[57:15] nonsense I'll say like this God don't
[57:17] let anybody down
[57:19] Hallelujah God won't let you down God
[57:21] doesn't let me down God gives us exactly
[57:24] and if our heart's in the right spot we
[57:26] recognize God's hand is in this and the
[57:28] Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[57:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[57:31] hallelujah God doesn't let people know
[57:34] God doesn't fail that's what I'm saying
[57:35] God doesn't fail
[57:37] us God does exactly what he wants to do
[57:41] and it's exactly for our good the Bible
[57:43] says somehow it's going to work out for
[57:45] our good
[57:48] Hallelujah it has
[57:51] to he's the author and finisher of our
[57:54] faith
[57:56] that means he authored it he wrote it
[57:58] all out and then he's going to make sure
[57:59] it comes to pass he's going to bring to
[58:01] pass everything in your life that needs
[58:03] to come to pass not that you want to
[58:05] come to pass but what you need to come
[58:07] to pass amen I teach that in first grade
[58:09] there's a difference boys and girls
[58:10] between wants and needs you can't have
[58:13] everything you want but you sure got to
[58:15] have your needs if you're going to
[58:16] survive I feel like I'm in teacher mode
[58:18] already two weeks early
[58:20] amen but that's for us God's not going
[58:22] to give you what you want God's going to
[58:24] give you what you need Hallelujah am
[58:26] just like he gave Moses amen he gave him
[58:29] what he needed he needed correction
[58:31] because he was exalting
[58:33] himself he needed an angel to chase him
[58:35] down I'm going to kill you because he
[58:37] neglected his son he needed to see God's
[58:40] grace on his
[58:41] wife his wife saving his
[58:46] life and and you know William brandham
[58:48] said that William brandham said Zapora
[58:50] was God's choice for
[58:53] Moses and if you know it God chose your
[58:55] SP for you too God chose brother amen
[58:58] just for
[59:01] you I know she's
[59:03] amen God chose my wife just for me she
[59:07] put her right there when I was
[59:09] 17 and right when I needed a a
[59:12] girlfriend I thought I needed a
[59:14] girlfriend God said I'm giving you a
[59:15] wife I'll take it
[59:19] Hallelujah uh August what was it August
[59:22] 29th August 28th was our first date
[59:27] 1998 24 26 years we're going to
[59:30] celebrate that together by God's
[59:33] grace but brother brandom looked at that
[59:35] preacher said
[59:37] nonsense God didn't let Moses down he
[59:41] let Moses into the promised land 1500
[59:45] years
[59:46] later amen hallelujah amen he if you go
[59:51] to Matthew we don't have to go there but
[59:52] Matthew 17 you know who did who did
[59:54] Peter James and John see on Mount
[59:55] transfig ation he saw Elijah and who who
[59:59] did he see Moses made it to the promised
[1:00:02] land God Will Never Let You Down
[1:00:04] hallelujah amen
[1:00:07] glory if you've got a desire on your
[1:00:09] heart and it's a Godly desire God will
[1:00:11] make sure you have that desire amen you
[1:00:14] might not see it on this side but you
[1:00:15] will see it sometime
[1:00:17] hallelujah
[1:00:19] amen but R said Moses was as alive as he
[1:00:23] ever was amen standing there talking to
[1:00:26] Jesus before Jesus went to Calvary him
[1:00:28] and Elijah standing together talking
[1:00:31] imagine not only did God let Moses in
[1:00:33] there God let him talk to his own son
[1:00:35] the sinless beloved Son of God he got
[1:00:37] let he got to talk to the Lamb of God
[1:00:39] and get him ready to go to the Cross
[1:00:42] hallelujah oh
[1:00:46] my Moses and Elijah appeared to Jesus
[1:00:49] Peter James and John on Mount
[1:00:50] Transfiguration Moses was not dead he
[1:00:53] was alive God didn't let him down he
[1:00:55] made it into
[1:00:57] Palestine oh I love the word of God
[1:00:59] don't
[1:01:00] you glory but said see the grace of God
[1:01:05] provided that for
[1:01:06] Moses God's grace so God didn't fail him
[1:01:10] God can't fail that preacher's that
[1:01:13] preacher is crazy that would say God
[1:01:15] failed he's a crazy preacher don't
[1:01:16] listen to
[1:01:18] him now I'm closing with this I preach
[1:01:20] hour I'm so 58 minutes man
[1:01:26] you remember this um Romans 4:18 who
[1:01:30] against hope believed in hope so in
[1:01:32] other words Moses was I'm sorry Abraham
[1:01:34] now is believing in the
[1:01:36] impossible now we're just showing a
[1:01:38] we're just showing the power of
[1:01:39] forgiveness with these verses okay I
[1:01:40] know talking about Abraham but remember
[1:01:42] God showed the same forgiveness to Moses
[1:01:44] God could have killed him maybe three
[1:01:46] times at least two it looks like for
[1:01:48] sure because he killed another man and
[1:01:50] they didn't circumcise
[1:01:52] gers God was chasing him down to kill
[1:01:55] him
[1:01:59] he says who against hope believed in
[1:02:01] hope that he might become the father of
[1:02:02] many nations according to that which is
[1:02:04] spoken so shall thy SE be and being not
[1:02:08] weak in
[1:02:09] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:02:13] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:02:15] old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:02:17] womb so they were both so old at
[1:02:19] 190 that the reproductive parts weren't
[1:02:22] working it was dead they're no longer
[1:02:24] working but because God had come to
[1:02:26] Moses and come to Sarah he believed that
[1:02:29] God would do it because he had a promise
[1:02:33] and so any promise in the Bible we can
[1:02:35] have hope in even if it doesn't look
[1:02:37] like God's going to do it God will do it
[1:02:39] Hallelujah God will perform it praise
[1:02:44] God verse 20 and he staggered not at the
[1:02:49] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:02:52] strong in faith giving glory to God now
[1:02:56] any Bible reader knows Mo or Abraham
[1:02:58] staggered at least five
[1:03:00] times right he went down to Egypt he
[1:03:03] went to the king ailec he laughed at
[1:03:06] God's promise and I remember that
[1:03:08] Genesis 17:17 he laughed at God he
[1:03:10] laughed in God's face
[1:03:13] right he took Hagar I mean he did he he
[1:03:17] just he made numerous mistakes but when
[1:03:20] God records Abraham's life God doesn't
[1:03:22] remember the mistakes Hallelujah that's
[1:03:25] an act of God's grace
[1:03:27] Hallelujah he didn't stagger he didn't
[1:03:30] stumble at the promise of God he was
[1:03:32] strong in faith giving God glory that's
[1:03:34] what we need to do tonight give God
[1:03:36] glory in the midst of our trials amen
[1:03:38] even if the promise hasn't happened yet
[1:03:40] trust God give God glory because it will
[1:03:42] come to pass if God promis it
[1:03:46] amen verse 21 he was fully persuaded
[1:03:49] that what God had promised he was able
[1:03:52] to perform and therefore was imputed to
[1:03:54] him for right righteousness and it was
[1:03:56] not written for his sake Alone Oh I like
[1:03:59] that one amen he said it wasn't for him
[1:04:02] alone he said that it was imputed to him
[1:04:05] he said but for us also to whom it shall
[1:04:08] be imputed if we believe on him that
[1:04:11] raised up Jesus our lord from the dead
[1:04:14] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:04:16] was raised again for our
[1:04:18] justification see this was written not
[1:04:21] just for Abraham's sake it was written
[1:04:23] for our sake amen that we should be
[1:04:25] strong in faith just give God glory as
[1:04:28] we wait on the promise even after we
[1:04:29] make mistakes just remember God will
[1:04:31] give you more grace he'll forgive all
[1:04:33] your mistakes and he'll call you an
[1:04:35] overcomer and he'll reward you and
[1:04:37] answer your prayer and he'll give you
[1:04:39] that promise that you waited so long for
[1:04:41] because God is rich in Mercy
[1:04:47] Hallelujah last quote William brandham
[1:04:49] said when I think of Abraham all the
[1:04:51] mistakes he made and Moses his
[1:04:54] mistakes but but when Abraham's
[1:04:56] commentary was written in Romans 4 the
[1:04:59] Divine commentary was written Paul wrote
[1:05:01] Abraham's commentary he never mentioned
[1:05:04] one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no
[1:05:08] never was even accounted to him
[1:05:11] glory Paul said Abraham staggered not at
[1:05:14] the promise of God through unbelief but
[1:05:16] was strong giving praise to God and
[1:05:20] William Bram said my humble prayer
[1:05:22] before the grace of God that's here this
[1:05:24] evening
[1:05:26] I hope my testimonies wrote like that
[1:05:30] that God won't see my
[1:05:33] mistakes and that's true because it said
[1:05:35] this is written not just for Abraham's
[1:05:37] sake but for us
[1:05:40] also amen he says that when my
[1:05:44] commentary is written my obituary that
[1:05:46] it won't be read out that I made
[1:05:48] mistakes and done wrong but God will
[1:05:50] only see the things that I tried to do
[1:05:53] for him
[1:05:55] he'll take the grace of God that I
[1:05:57] believed in and that's what I'm solely
[1:06:00] trusting in for upon my merits I could
[1:06:03] no more go to heaven than any of the
[1:06:05] rest but upon the grace of God I'm
[1:06:07] depending yes it's Grace that I'm
[1:06:10] depending on Amen let's stand to our
[1:06:12] feet musicians can come let's give God a
[1:06:14] round of applause amen
[1:06:18] hallelujah let's sing that of course

[1:06:44] iniquities our transgressions God says
[1:06:46] I'm going to give you more grace I might
[1:06:48] chase you down until you repent but I'm
[1:06:50] going to do it because I love you God
[1:06:53] loved Moses God said Moses you're the
[1:06:56] meekest man on this Earth remember God
[1:06:58] said there in numbers 12 he told he told
[1:07:01] Aaron and Miram there's none like Moses
[1:07:04] on the whole earth you know I'll give
[1:07:05] people dreams and Visions but Moses
[1:07:07] isn't like that I talk to him face to
[1:07:10] face he's such a he's such a friend to
[1:07:12] me praise God he's such a friend but yet
[1:07:15] God in his Mercy would chase him down to
[1:07:17] get him to recognize his neglect and
[1:07:20] show him that he should obey the word of
[1:07:23] God how many thankful for amazing Grace
[1:07:26] tonight let's have a word of
[1:07:28] prayer as we pray just talk to the
