[43:35] tomorrow someone else is gonna have to
[43:37] find out that's someone that Jesus
[43:39] Christ is the same tomorrow because he
[43:43] is the same every day that is called
[43:45] today someone is gonna find out that
[43:47] Jesus Christ is the same way amen and it
[43:50] might as well be you it might as well be
[43:52] me
[43:52] someone's gonna find out why because his
[43:55] mercy and His grace towards us that's
[43:57] one thing about David is he is a man
[43:59] that understood the loving kindness of
[44:01] the Lord Amen not know if you've ever uh
[44:04] you know I read the you know over and um
[44:08] I suppose see if I can read this real
[44:10] quick over in Psalms oh dear I didn't
[44:16] write it down but over in Isaiah 65 it
[44:20] said something along the lines of my I
[44:25] thought I wrote that down I didn't so
[44:28] well that's alright but over in Isaiah
[44:30] 65 I believe was it says I will give you
[44:33] the sure mercies of David the owner
[44:35] repeats it again in the book of Acts
[44:37] talking about Christ as I gave him the
[44:39] even the sure mercies of David amen and
[44:42] David had mercies that he was sure about
[44:44] amen
[44:46] God had given oaths look think about it
[44:48] Dave is all from the from the very
[44:50] moment that God started visiting him he
[44:54] was just a boy in the in the flocks just
[44:57] a boy is a there we go I will give you
[45:00] the sure mercies of David amen and and
[45:03] just think about is the so David has
[45:06] mercies that were sure in his life think
[45:08] about this man this this boy he started
[45:10] off as a boy there and just tending his
[45:12] father's flock God never failed about to
[45:15] show up on the scene amen he said when
[45:18] the when the lion came to take one of
[45:19] the sheep he said God gave me the
[45:22] ability to take care of the lion they
[45:24] may say when the when the bear he says I
[45:26] took the lion by the beard and he
[45:28] grabbed me he slew the lion when the
[45:30] bear came to take on the sheep he said
[45:32] Lord gave me the ability to take care of
[45:34] the bear and then when the Goliath came
[45:37] he says and the same God that gave me
[45:39] the ability to take care of those the
[45:41] same God will give me the ability to
[45:42] take care of this take the head off of
[45:44] this man today God David as a man I knew
[45:47] that the mercies in his life were sure
[45:49] he knew where he stood he knew who he
[45:51] was worshiping he knew the God that he
[45:54] was serving and he knew that God would
[45:56] always show up there on the scene in his
[45:57] life
[45:58] amen he was also a man that you know how
[46:01] many times something would go wrong in
[46:03] his life amen he was a man that knew
[46:06] that how does live on the mountaintop
[46:07] but he also knew how to live down in the
[46:10] valley amen but he also knew that
[46:12] whenever he was down in the valley he
[46:14] said there you are will be with me right
[46:16] you'll never leave me nor fail me he'll
[46:18] never forsake me amen David is a man
[46:21] when you talk about the sure mercies of
[46:22] David David has some mercies to him that
[46:25] were sure amen
[46:26] he has some mercies that would never
[46:28] fail never forsake him amen so when I
[46:31] when I when I read that verse in Psalm
[46:34] 103 where he said who redeemeth thy life
[46:38] from destruction who crowns thee with
[46:40] loving-kindness and tender mercies and
[46:43] you always hear about the sure mercies
[46:45] of David or the tender mercies of David
[46:48] and the loving-kindness it's all it's
[46:50] littered throughout all the Psalms thus
[46:52] those two terms are scattered throughout
[46:54] all the Psalms love the loving kindness
[46:57] of the Lord and his tender mercies
[46:58] because David had an understanding of
[47:01] God's loving-kindness of his tender
[47:03] mercies so I started going back through
[47:06] the Psalms I started reading about those
[47:08] words loving-kindness and tender mercies
[47:13] because I wanted to understand them
[47:15] better and better because if I got if I
[47:18] have something from the Lord
[47:19] I want to know what it's all about amen
[47:23] footsteps is possession right amen so if
[47:25] we have something I want to know what it
[47:28] is
[47:28] amen and the Bible says that he has
[47:30] crowned us with loving-kindness he has
[47:33] crowned us with tender mercies a man
[47:35] that's a possession that he's given us
[47:37] that's something that we have that's
[47:39] something we can take hold up and we can
[47:41] use and it upon life's journey Amen it's
[47:43] so nice why is look kind of researching
[47:46] the the word loving-kindness I'm just
[47:50] kind of going down and reading all the
[47:52] places in the scriptures where it showed
[47:53] up and and just you're reading what what
[47:56] does this word mean yo and as you do you
[47:59] know and you're looking through the
[48:00] scriptures you know and you take the the
[48:02] Hebrew and all that and you can dive
[48:04] down from there to the root word you're
[48:07] just kinda because because we want to
[48:08] know what it is
[48:09] Amen we're like Caleb we're like Joshua
[48:11] if there's something in the Bible that
[48:12] can be ours we're gonna grab ahold of it
[48:14] and take amen so if God has crowned us
[48:17] with loving-kindness and tender mercies
[48:19] let's find out what these tender mercies
[48:21] and loving-kindness is are a mess when I
[48:23] was reading about loving-kindness is it
[48:25] was it was like when a man when he has
[48:28] loving kindness towards someone it's
[48:31] like when he can badly can condescend
[48:34] down to someone who was lower than
[48:35] himself a man he can go down and pick
[48:38] that man up and he can put him up on
[48:41] right here up and so they could be equal
[48:44] so they can be side by side and and that
[48:47] man may not even be deserving to be
[48:49] there but the but the one man who has
[48:51] loving kindness upon someone it'll grab
[48:53] that man and pull him up from where he
[48:54] is and it'll set him by his side he'll
[48:57] Kucera flesh of his flesh bone of his
[48:59] bone amen was one God crowns us with his
[49:02] loving-kindness what's he doing he's
[49:04] saying I picked you up for where you
[49:06] were a man and I had mercy upon you I
[49:09] had grace upon you and when God says I
[49:11] have crowned you with this Amen this is
[49:14] how we live this is the authority that
[49:16] we live under this is our authority this
[49:18] is our this is our power this is our
[49:20] might this is something we've been given
[49:22] this is this is ours we have ownership
[49:24] of it Amen that God picked us up from
[49:27] where we once were any we don't have to
[49:29] worry we're not down here anymore
[49:31] amen he said that we would be joint
[49:33] heirs with Christ amen he would flesh of
[49:36] his flesh bone of his bone
[49:38] we've been crowned with the loving
[49:40] kindness of the Lord a man he said that
[49:43] we will sit with him in his throne a man
[49:45] he has given us everything that we have
[49:47] need of upon this last journey hey man
[49:50] so I started looking said I went through
[49:52] it that word and when I got down to the
[49:53] tender mercies I started reading it and
[49:55] when you boil it on down to the sum of
[49:58] the root words it had to do with
[49:59] caressing like a said like a like a
[50:02] woman that a child in her stomach would
[50:05] massage her belly with the tender
[50:08] mercies that she has towards her unborn
[50:10] child think about think about the
[50:13] thoughts that a woman would have towards
[50:16] her unborn child think about is there
[50:18] any is there any thoughts of bitterness
[50:21] is there any thought is there anything
[50:24] she can she can blame the child for is
[50:27] there anything that she can point her
[50:28] finger at that child for you know
[50:30] discipline is the farthest thing for her
[50:32] mind you always she's you know is that
[50:34] for all that she's going through with
[50:36] the child in her in her belly but yet
[50:38] she has when she robes her belly there's
[50:40] it's the thoughts of love
[50:42] loving-kindness and tender mercies why
[50:45] because she's worth she loves that child
[50:47] and she's looking forward to a time when
[50:49] she can experience it face to face she's
[50:52] looking forward to the time when she can
[50:54] take that child home amen as that child
[50:57] can grow up in an inner home amen and so
[51:00] when God says I have crowned you with
[51:02] the tender mercies of Jehovah and we
[51:04] Rita also her about the tender mercies
[51:06] of Jehovah yeah it's the same thoughts
[51:08] that a woman would have towards her
[51:10] unborn child these are the this is how
[51:13] God is gonna relate to us this is how
[51:16] God is gonna meet us day by day this is
[51:19] when we get down we go and we bow down
[51:22] at our bedside and pray this is the
[51:24] thoughts that God has towards us when he
[51:27] hears our prayer amen this is the
[51:29] thoughts that God has towards us when we
[51:31] pray when we open up our Bible we read
[51:33] our Bibles and and when God looks down
[51:35] from heaven and sees that we are in love
[51:37] with his word the thoughts he has
[51:39] towards us are with his loving kindness
[51:41] in his tender mercies a man when we take
[51:43] a prayer and we laid
[51:45] the altar where the blood of the Lamb is
[51:46] he is thinking of us through through the
[51:49] attributes of loving-kindness and tender
[51:50] mercies amen
[51:52] and what what can't what more can he do
[51:56] Amen you know okay David is one who is
[51:59] throughout all of his life he always
[52:01] knew the God that he served amen he
[52:04] always knew that the God that he served
[52:06] would see him through a man it doesn't
[52:09] matter how high he was how low he was
[52:11] wherever he was upon life's journey
[52:13] whether it was in Israel or out of
[52:15] Israel Amen God was whipped by his side
[52:18] amen
[52:19] God said he'll never leave you nor
[52:22] forsake you
[52:22] Amen that you always I was a you know
[52:26] think just thinking about like when you
[52:27] listen to the tapes of brother branham's
[52:31] and you get to the prayer lines and and
[52:32] brother Brian will be up there on the
[52:34] stage and Yaya and yeah and you hear him
[52:37] speaking and he's and he says oh and he
[52:39] sees he sees the pillar of fire going
[52:42] through the audience you know one time
[52:46] in the questions and answers someone
[52:49] went to brother Branham a wrote a
[52:50] question they said what is that pillar
[52:52] of fire that follows you around and he
[52:56] says it's the Holy Ghost
[52:58] he says it's God it's not just to me but
[53:01] to every true believer
[53:04] Amen anyway I want you to think you know
[53:06] we think about all those prayer lines
[53:08] and all those things but the same God
[53:10] that has crowned us with blubbing
[53:13] kindness and tender mercies that same
[53:16] pillar of fires here tonight Amen I
[53:20] didn't say back 50 years ago maybe it's
[53:23] just a brother brand had a gift where he
[53:25] could see it Amen now I might not have
[53:27] that gift that I can see it but
[53:29] sometimes like no one he's in the room
[53:31] amen amen I know that you do too amen
[53:34] because there's times where you the
[53:35] service gets so sweet where you know
[53:37] that God is in the room you know that he
[53:39] has answered his word you know because
[53:41] God makes an appointment with us God
[53:43] made an appointment with us when he said
[53:46] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[53:47] name I will be right there and the Missa
[53:51] I mean it doesn't have to be in this
[53:53] church room that could be a husband and
[53:54] a wife a man that can be a husband and a
[53:57] wife and her children

[54:14] he says that when I do arrive when I do
[54:17] show up on the scene he said I'll be
[54:18] just the same as I always was a man of
[54:21] my thoughts towards you have not changed

[55:32] am here I have faithful to answer your
[55:34] prayer hey man you remember when when
[55:37] Solomon dedicated the temple amen he
[55:40] prayed that great prayer he said Lord if
[55:43] any of your children be anywhere I pray
[55:45] father if they could just come into this
[55:47] temple father and if they come into this
[55:49] temple and they just raise their hands
[55:51] towards the heavens I pray Lord that you
[55:53] Lord would hear from heaven and hear
[55:56] their prayer they said furthermore Lord
[55:58] if they be off on a journey and can't
[56:00] get to this temple that if they be
[56:02] anywhere that if they just turn their
[56:04] face towards the temple that you Lord
[56:06] will hear from heaven and answer their
[56:08] prayer and he said furthermore Lord I
[56:11] ask you
[56:12] step further now if there be a stranger
[56:14] who has nodded you that's whether he
[56:17] whatever religion he might come from but
[56:18] if he be a stranger to the house of
[56:20] Israel but he be travelling front
[56:22] through the land and he comes and he
[56:23] comes into this temple a man he spray
[56:26] puts his hands up before you Lord and he
[56:28] prays this prayer in your temple that
[56:30] you Lord would hear from heaven and
[56:32] answer that man's prayer I wonder do you
[56:35] think that that that that dedication
[56:37] prayer still has authority tonight amen
[56:42] now that now sahlan prayed that prayer
[56:44] for God's holy temple does God still
[56:47] have holy temples a man know ye not that
[56:50] you are a temple of the Holy Ghost don't
[56:53] you know that you are a temple of the
[56:55] Holy Ghost that means that if you are a
[56:57] temple of the Holy Ghost thing God has
[56:59] the God set according to Salman's prayer
[57:03] three thousand years ago I will hear
[57:05] your prayer I will hear the cry of your
[57:08] heart when you cry out unto me you who
[57:11] have been crowned with the loving
[57:12] kindness of the Lord you who wear the
[57:15] crown of my tender mercies I hear I'm
[57:17] standing here with the blood of the Lamb
[57:19] waiting to make waiting to intercede for
[57:22] you based upon your confession whatever
[57:25] is you have need upon life's journey I
[57:26] have given it to you when I give you the
[57:29] Holy Ghost amen I'm just waiting for you
[57:31] to confess waiting for you to pray amen
[57:34] amen yo I'm almost positive there last
[57:37] time I was here I read from Psalms 18
[57:39] but we're gonna read there again tonight
[57:40] amen I'm sure nobody here remembers it
[57:42] anyway amen so let's let's turn to
[57:47] psalms 18 I just I read this Psalm
[57:49] almost everywhere I go it's all my
[57:52] favorite scriptures in the Bible amen
[57:56] Psalms 18 verse 6 in this Psalm David
[58:00] was distressed he was surrounded by his
[58:05] enemies he was in a bad spot he was
[58:10] about ready to be killed I mean he
[58:13] didn't know what was gonna happen but
[58:15] one thing he knew for sure that God was
[58:17] gonna take care of him amen so why so
[58:20] here he and Psalm 18 verse 6 he says in
[58:24] my distress
[58:26] called upon the Lord I cried unto my God
[58:29] and he heard my voice out of his temple
[58:31] and my cry came before him even into his
[58:35] ears Amen so so David was a man that
[58:39] knew that when he was going to pray into
[58:42] the Lord now he wasn't anywhere near the
[58:43] temple but he knew that he when he when
[58:46] the prayer left his mouth he knew
[58:47] exactly where his prayer goes amen who
[58:50] here knows where their prayers go when
[58:52] they'll affray amen everybody that's
[58:54] been crowned with a tender mercies and
[58:56] the loving kindness of the Lord needs to
[58:58] know where your prayers go when you pray
[59:00] Hebrew says that our play he that the
[59:02] Lord Himself is standing there waiting
[59:05] to make intercession for us based upon
[59:07] our confession Amen where we confess our
[59:10] mouth when we say Lord I have a need of
[59:12] this I have a need of that Lord I'm
[59:14] about my father's business I'm raising
[59:16] my family a man I'm at my job I'm trying
[59:21] to make a living for my family or I'm
[59:22] trying to raise my children or my
[59:24] children going wayward or my children
[59:25] need this Lord I'm about your business
[59:28] that you gave me amen
[59:29] and when that confession what you
[59:31] confess with your mouth it leaves your
[59:33] mouth where does it go but it goes way
[59:35] up into the temple the Most High God
[59:36] where the blood of the Lamb is sitting
[59:38] there waiting waiting for you to make an
[59:40] accession for you based on what you
[59:42] confess hey man let's see let's go on
[59:45] down here in Psalms 18 I want to read
[59:47] the next 10 or 15 verses or show and
[59:50] show you the reaction that happened when
[59:53] David prayed this prayer it set off a
[59:55] chain of events amen one prayer took one
[1:00:00] verse he said I cry out to the Lord in
[1:00:02] my distress and my cry went into the
[1:00:05] Lord's temple and he heard me out of his
[1:00:07] temple Amen so we get to verse 7 this is
[1:00:11] God's reaction to David's cry amen and
[1:00:14] the same thing is available to us
[1:00:16] tonight amen amen and any night to
[1:00:20] anybody who's been crowned with the
[1:00:21] loving-kindness and tender mercies of
[1:00:23] the Lord this is us beginning to
[1:00:25] understand the loving kindness of the
[1:00:28] Lord amen verse 7 it says then the earth
[1:00:31] shook and trembled the foundations of
[1:00:34] the hills up moved and were shaken
[1:00:36] because he was Rothes why was God
[1:00:38] wrought
[1:00:39] because someone is disturbing one of his
[1:00:41] children amen God was wroth God was
[1:00:45] getting angry because someone was
[1:00:48] causing his children to cry out one of
[1:00:50] his turn was crying out in distress and
[1:00:52] God was getting angry at David's enemies
[1:00:55] amen amen whoo-whee and we all have any
[1:00:58] Saints Amen the devil goes about with
[1:01:01] like an anger like an angry lion seeking
[1:01:03] whom he may devour
[1:01:06] amen amen verse eight and there went up
[1:01:09] a smoke out of his nostrils fire out of
[1:01:12] his mouth devoured coals were kindled by
[1:01:14] it he bowed the heavens also and came
[1:01:17] down God Himself is coming down to earth
[1:01:21] at the cry of one of his saints amen
[1:01:24] amen and darkness was under his feet he
[1:01:28] rode upon a cherub and did fly yay he
[1:01:30] did fly upon the wings of the wind
[1:01:32] he made darkness his secret place his
[1:01:35] pavilion round about him were dark
[1:01:36] waters and thick clouds of the skies and
[1:01:39] at the brightness that was before him
[1:01:41] his sick clouds passed hail stones and
[1:01:44] coals of fire the Lord also thundered in
[1:01:46] the heavens and the highest gave his
[1:01:48] voice hail stones and coals of fire yay
[1:01:51] he sent out his arrows and scattered
[1:01:53] them he shout lightnings and
[1:01:55] discomforted them then the channels of
[1:01:57] the waters were seen the foundations of
[1:02:00] the world were discovered at thy rebuke
[1:02:01] O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy
[1:02:04] nostrils he sent from above and took me
[1:02:07] he drew me out of the many waters and he
[1:02:10] delivered me from my strong enemy and
[1:02:12] from them they which hated me for they
[1:02:15] were too strong for me and God heard
[1:02:19] David's prayer and God showed up on the
[1:02:22] scene amen and God is still the same
[1:02:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:27] when one is says there in date remember
[1:02:30] how he remembers in Daniel chapter 10 or
[1:02:32] 11 I forget where it is where Daniel had
[1:02:34] been praying even praying amen and
[1:02:37] praying and he and his praying facing
[1:02:39] towards Jerusalem and he's crying out
[1:02:41] under the Lord and all sudden angel
[1:02:43] comes he says after 21 days the angel
[1:02:46] came and the angel says something that
[1:02:48] was always so striking to me he's the
[1:02:50] angel said that day the moment you
[1:02:53] start praying your prayers were hurt
[1:02:56] amen the moment you start praying heaven
[1:03:00] started listening
[1:03:00] the moment you start praying now I might
[1:03:03] have taken me 21 days to get here but I
[1:03:05] want you to know Daniel I don't want you
[1:03:07] be doubt and I don't want you be to
[1:03:08] scourge IVs I want you to know it even
[1:03:10] though it took me twenty one days the
[1:03:12] answer the very moment you started
[1:03:14] praying all of heaven was started
[1:03:16] listening amen and for the children of
[1:03:18] God who had been crowned with the
[1:03:20] heavenly with the tender mercies of God
[1:03:22] they've been crowned with his
[1:03:23] loving-kindness amen God is crowned and
[1:03:25] we're sitting up with them in heavenly
[1:03:27] places in Christ Jesus amen where we're
[1:03:29] sitting with him in his throne amen and
[1:03:31] he is waiting for his children when they
[1:03:33] cry out I will answer as British like I
[1:03:35] answer this prayer I'm ready to move
[1:03:37] heaven and earth based on your head on
[1:03:38] your knee
[1:03:39] amen amen who has needs tonight amen and
[1:03:46] God is the same yesterday today and
[1:03:47] forever amen think about when when when
[1:03:51] Paul when st. Paul grabbed up his pin he
[1:03:53] started writing he's right in the book
[1:03:55] of Hebrews and he got to Hebrews chapter
[1:03:57] 13 and he kept on writing he wrote it
[1:03:59] down verse one he wrote down verse two
[1:04:02] he's writing by what he was he doing he
[1:04:04] was moved by the Holy Spirit to write
[1:04:06] amen is now what the Bible says that s
[1:04:09] st. Paul was writing the Bible says that
[1:04:11] his hand was being moved by the Holy
[1:04:14] Spirit amen
[1:04:15] because as they're the men of old were
[1:04:18] moved by the Holy Ghost to write saying
[1:04:20] we got to Hebrews chapter 13 7 he
[1:04:22] started writing and he got the Hebrews
[1:04:24] 13:8 he says Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:27] yesterday today and forever amen he
[1:04:30] wrote that by permission he wrote that
[1:04:32] by commandment that and went out as a
[1:04:35] prophecy that Jesus Christ every day is
[1:04:38] that is called today Jesus Christ will
[1:04:40] be the same a man now I don't quite
[1:04:43] remember what the day the date is today
[1:04:45] it might be April 13th or April 12th or
[1:04:47] April 14th I'm not sure it might be 14th
[1:04:49] I think I don't know but but so on this
[1:04:52] day on April 14th 2018 it was prophesied
[1:04:56] over 2,000 years ago that Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] would be the same today and somebody has
[1:05:02] to find out that that's true somebody
[1:05:04] has to know that he's the same
[1:05:06] I mean that prophecy has not failed amen
[1:05:09] and that prophecy won't fail tomorrow
[1:05:11] and it won't fail the next day it's
[1:05:13] gonna go on every single person that has
[1:05:15] been crowned with the tender mercies of
[1:05:17] God that has been crowned with his
[1:05:18] loving-kindness is gonna find out that
[1:05:20] that scripture is true amen he is the
[1:05:23] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:27] it's just like you know in the they're
[1:05:30] in the assault and the New Testament is
[1:05:34] like a grain of mustard seed amen you
[1:05:37] know and then it says that your prayer
[1:05:38] would be like a also says else way your
[1:05:40] prayer would be like a mustard seed amen
[1:05:44] oran he also talks about the seat though
[1:05:46] the the mustard seek plant
[1:05:48] he says when is sown it is small
[1:05:52] he says when is grown is greater than
[1:05:57] all things of that which was song is
[1:06:00] small but when it has grown it is
[1:06:02] greater
[1:06:03] amen and then it talks about mustard
[1:06:05] seed faith also you know but but think
[1:06:07] about it how many times do we pray a
[1:06:10] prayer that seems so small look at
[1:06:14] David's prayer there in Psalms 18 he
[1:06:16] says I cried unto the Lord it took one
[1:06:18] verse to describe his prayer a little
[1:06:21] prayer when I saw no am I've been so
[1:06:23] small but yet God made such a mighty
[1:06:25] response to it Amen why because he's the
[1:06:29] same yesterday today and forever Amen he
[1:06:31] is just waiting for his two children to
[1:06:33] cry out a man last heard of Psalms 107 I
[1:06:36] got along I hope you all like the Bible
[1:06:38] because I got a long reading here I
[1:06:39] wanted to read Amen
[1:06:45] solves 107 it's kind of a unique and
[1:06:49] unique chapter it's kind of slep in
[1:06:53] about four or five different stories I'm
[1:06:57] not going to read the whole chapter by
[1:06:58] probably will read about two-thirds of
[1:07:00] it at least amen and so and so about
[1:07:03] every eighth verse every eight verses or
[1:07:06] so it's another story and it's a story
[1:07:09] about lows that discover that God is
[1:07:12] rich in mercy and praising God for
[1:07:15] delivering him out of whatever it is
[1:07:17] that they were going through
[1:07:20] amen so let's go to Psalms 1:07 will
[1:07:22] will read the first nine verses here and
[1:07:25] stop this is talk ulis part the first
[1:07:28] nine verses here is talking about those
[1:07:30] that were redeemed out of Egypt
[1:07:33] amen now they were in bondage they were
[1:07:36] suffering amen they had a promise that
[1:07:39] God had given to Abraham but they had
[1:07:41] not quite realized their promise yet and
[1:07:43] all sudden God delivered them out of
[1:07:45] what they were going through and getting
[1:07:46] to them into their promise they meant
[1:07:49] and it says what's almost everyone says
[1:07:52] o give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[1:07:54] good for his mercy endureth forever let
[1:07:57] the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he
[1:08:00] hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy
[1:08:02] and gather them out of the lands from
[1:08:04] the east and from the west and the north
[1:08:05] and from the south they wandered in the
[1:08:08] wilderness in a solitary way they found
[1:08:11] no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty
[1:08:14] their soul fainted in them but then they
[1:08:17] cried unto the Lord in their trouble and
[1:08:20] he delivered them out of their distress
[1:08:22] he led them forth by the right way that
[1:08:26] they might go to a city of habitation oh
[1:08:28] that man would praise the Lord for His
[1:08:31] goodness and for his wonderful works to
[1:08:33] the children of men for he satisfies the
[1:08:35] longing soul and filleth the hungry soul
[1:08:38] with goodness amen
[1:08:40] God heard their cry they are wandering
[1:08:43] in the wilderness and what they do God
[1:08:44] heard their cry so they said oh that man
[1:08:47] would praise the Lord for His goodness
[1:08:49] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:08:51] children of men amen now this next this
[1:08:55] next chunk of Scripture here next 10
[1:08:59] verse 8 verses or so he has a little
[1:09:01] story about those that are bound by
[1:09:03] sickness and are in prison amen starts
[1:09:08] in verse 10 and it says such as sit in
[1:09:11] darkness and in shadow of death being
[1:09:14] bound in affliction and iron because
[1:09:17] they rebelled against the words of God
[1:09:19] and contemned the council the Most High
[1:09:21] therefore he brought down their heart
[1:09:23] with labor and they fell down and there
[1:09:25] was none to help but then they cried
[1:09:27] unto the Lord in their trouble and he
[1:09:30] saved them out of their distress he
[1:09:33] brought them out of darkness and the
[1:09:35] shadow of death and you break their
[1:09:37] bounds bands asunder
[1:09:39] oh that main would praise the Lord for
[1:09:41] His goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:09:43] to the children of men for he have
[1:09:45] broken the gates of brass and cut the
[1:09:47] bars of iron and sunder a man how
[1:09:50] remembers in in Isaiah 65 he said the
[1:09:53] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:09:55] has anointed me hey man he's annoying to
[1:09:57] me to break them out of the prisons he's
[1:09:59] anointed me to heal them they're blind
[1:10:01] he's anointed me to bring them out of
[1:10:03] prison he's annoyed to mean it healed in
[1:10:05] the sick why because the Spirit of God
[1:10:06] when he comes this is what he does
[1:10:08] Amen when the Spirit comes he heals when
[1:10:11] the Spirit comes he delivers when the
[1:10:13] Spirit comes he says freeze and oh that
[1:10:15] Mainland praise Him amen
[1:10:18] this next this next few 8 verses here
[1:10:21] talks about men that are fools men they
[1:10:26] ought to know better but do something
[1:10:27] anyhow Amen men that know what the word
[1:10:31] says but they can't quite find
[1:10:32] themselves to obey the word Amen or
[1:10:35] other or they're just not intelligent or
[1:10:36] they're just not or just they're foolish
[1:10:38] men and how the mercy of God goes out to
[1:10:42] them still even amen we who were not
[1:10:45] worthy God has made us worthy a man says
[1:10:48] start earn-in
[1:10:49] in verse 17 fools because of their
[1:10:52] transgression because of their
[1:10:55] iniquities are afflicted their soul
[1:10:57] abhor athough manner of meat and they
[1:10:59] draw near to the gates of death then
[1:11:02] they cry unto the Lord in their trouble
[1:11:03] and he saves them out of their
[1:11:05] de-stresses he sent His Word and healed
[1:11:08] them and delivered them from their
[1:11:10] destructions oh that men would praise
[1:11:12] the Lord for His goodness
[1:11:14] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:11:16] children of men let them sacrifice the
[1:11:18] sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare
[1:11:20] his works with her joy see oh that men
[1:11:23] would praise the Lord for His goodness
[1:11:24] and his wonderful works of it a man we
[1:11:27] ought to worship Him he's crowned us
[1:11:29] with loving-kindness until even when we
[1:11:31] weren't worthy amen
[1:11:33] III think God Yahweh this the times that
[1:11:37] God has heard my prayer when I was even
[1:11:39] worthy of the times I worship in the
[1:11:42] most Amen the times when I know I don't
[1:11:45] deserve it and yet God still
[1:11:47] answers my prayer or still shows up on
[1:11:51] the scene or still shows up when I pray
[1:11:53] or still shows up when I worship even
[1:11:55] when I know I don't even deserve it
[1:11:57] that's what causes me to worship Him the
[1:11:59] most hey this next section will be the
[1:12:02] last section we read but I was talking
[1:12:04] about men that are in boats when they're
[1:12:06] when they're surrounded by water and
[1:12:08] their only hope is in the boat that
[1:12:10] they're sitting in and when their boat
[1:12:12] begins to fail that they turn to the
[1:12:14] Lord
[1:12:15] amen it says verse 23 they that go down
[1:12:20] to the ships go down to the sea and
[1:12:22] ships that do business in great waters
[1:12:25] these see the work of the Lord and His
[1:12:27] wonders in the deep for he commandeth
[1:12:29] and raises the stormy wind which lifted
[1:12:31] up the waves thereof they mount up to
[1:12:34] the heaven and they go down again into
[1:12:35] the depths their soul is melted because
[1:12:37] of trouble they reel to and fro and
[1:12:40] stinger like a drunken man and are at
[1:12:42] with their wit's end then they cry unto
[1:12:44] the Lord in their trouble and he
[1:12:46] bringeth them out or distress he maketh
[1:12:48] the storm a column so that the way is
[1:12:50] there of our still and then they are
[1:12:52] glad because they be quiet so he
[1:12:55] bringeth them unto their desired Haven
[1:12:57] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[1:13:00] His goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:13:02] to the children of men because he brings
[1:13:05] brings them to their desired Haven hey
[1:13:08] man I don't think there's a Christian
[1:13:09] out there right now that does not have a
[1:13:10] haven in mind that they'd like to get to
[1:13:12] a man because Lourdes promises a place
[1:13:16] of rest a man where we are no longer
[1:13:19] resting upon our works but we are rested
[1:13:22] upon the Holy Spirit of the Living God a
[1:13:24] man that we go through our times of
[1:13:26] troubles but one thing we do know for
[1:13:28] sure that our God is with us every step
[1:13:30] of the way hey man we might go through
[1:13:33] times where we are poor we might go
[1:13:35] through times where we were rich oh my
[1:13:36] go times where we were sick or at times
[1:13:39] where we're well but in all things we
[1:13:40] give our thanks and our praise to God it
[1:13:43] repeats over and over again and the
[1:13:44] scripture says old that main would
[1:13:46] praise the Lord for His goodness and for
[1:13:48] his wonderful works and the children of
[1:13:50] a mint to its owner mint because it's
[1:13:52] not that they don't go through troubles
[1:13:53] but that our God will deliver them out
[1:13:56] of every single trouble Amen God got the
[1:13:59] law God will deliver his children
[1:14:01] out of their troubles and when it comes
[1:14:03] down to the end of this chapter it comes
[1:14:05] down to the verse that we read there a
[1:14:06] little bit ago starting there with verse
[1:14:09] 42 it says the righteous shall see it
[1:14:12] what do they see they see every single
[1:14:15] thing we just read they're the righteous
[1:14:17] we'll see how men how God is always
[1:14:19] about delivering men out of their
[1:14:21] troubles the righteous will see it and
[1:14:24] rejoice and all Nikoli shall stop her
[1:14:28] mouth whoso is wise and will observe
[1:14:31] these things even they shall understand
[1:14:34] the loving kindness of the Lord that's
[1:14:39] kind of what I just wanted to get
[1:14:40] through get over tonight is the
[1:14:42] understanding of the loving kindness of
[1:14:44] the Lord that no matter where you are
[1:14:46] upon life's journey whether you're 5
[1:14:49] years old or 15 years old or 25 or 35
[1:14:52] fourth hour old you are that God knows
[1:14:55] what stage of life you are in amen he
[1:14:59] knows whether you're a child growing up
[1:15:02] he knows whether you're a teenager or
[1:15:04] going through the struggle as you change
[1:15:06] your change of life you know he goes

[1:15:20] leaving and you're entering into a new
[1:15:22] stage of life without sure God knows
[1:15:24] every single stage of your life he knows
[1:15:29] the temptations that you go through amen
[1:15:32] and but you don't want things for sure
[1:15:35] that God wrote our names upon the Lamb's
[1:15:37] Book of Life amen
[1:15:40] if God has called you if God has
[1:15:44] revealed to your name that your name is
[1:15:47] written upon the last book of life
[1:15:49] if God has as when God starts drawing

[1:15:55] bank
[1:15:55] amen that the very God that has began to
[1:15:58] draw you will see you all the way
[1:16:00] through the very God from the first time
[1:16:03] he began showing up at your heart's door
[1:16:05] and when the very first time he starts
[1:16:07] drawing you remembered always remember
[1:16:08] that that God will see you through all L
[1:16:10] of your life amen I have been you know

[1:16:25] minute through all my teen years all the
[1:16:27] struggles I would God was there amen
[1:16:31] every single thing I went through as a
[1:16:33] teenager God was there in my 20s all

[1:16:39] I've gone through God has been there God
[1:16:42] has been with me every step of the way
[1:16:43] amen I see it and I understand now the
[1:16:46] loving kindness of the Lord that my God
[1:16:48] will see me through why because he knew
[1:16:50] the struggles I would go through with
[1:16:51] the day he chose me
[1:16:53] amen the day that God started drawing me
[1:16:56] the day that God started knocking on my
[1:16:58] heart's door he knew every state mistake
[1:17:00] I would make amen
[1:17:02] but it's just like you just like I've
[1:17:04] said a long time ago you know that that
[1:17:06] God will not sentence his children to
[1:17:08] life in prison a man we might go through
[1:17:11] this or go through that but God will
[1:17:13] never sentence one of his children to
[1:17:14] life in prison
[1:17:15] he might correct you he might chastise
[1:17:16] you but he has in mind that he's gonna
[1:17:18] bring you up he's gonna bring you up out
[1:17:20] of the mud out of loving-kindness and
[1:17:22] set you up on it by his side amen so you

[1:17:27] that you can be about your father's
[1:17:29] business once more Amen that's where
[1:17:31] Christ is trying to draw us to amen so
[1:17:34] the wherever the Holy Spirit lead us
[1:17:35] that we can be about our father's
[1:17:36] business
[1:17:38] amen amen because he is the same
[1:17:41] yesterday today and forever amen you
[1:17:44] know Jesus you know and he well he went
[1:17:47] up to the tenth the tablet to the
[1:17:49] tabernacle that was a tabernacle that
[1:17:51] one day and he and he and he stood up to
[1:17:54] read and he went and he grabbed the
[1:17:57] scroll of Isaiah I mean turn or to
[1:18:00] Isaiah chapter 61 and all the eyes were
[1:18:04] watching him to see what he would say
[1:18:06] and he stood there and he started
[1:18:08] speaking he said the Spirit of the Lord
[1:18:10] God is upon me and on top until that
[1:18:15] time never had a man stood in a
[1:18:18] tabernacle and read that scripture with
[1:18:21] the full authority that this man was
[1:18:23] reading
[1:18:24] amen the many times that scripture men
[1:18:27] read but had never been read with the
[1:18:29] authority that was being read at that
[1:18:31] time a many faithful priests had stood
[1:18:36] up at the at the front of the tabernacle
[1:18:38] and said this morning we are gonna read
[1:18:41] from Isaiah 61 and here they go through
[1:18:43] and they'd start reading and but but
[1:18:46] none of those men could actually say
[1:18:48] that without the assurance that the
[1:18:50] Spirit of Lord God was upon them but at
[1:18:54] this time a man sit up with the full
[1:18:57] authority he stood up knowing that the
[1:19:01] words that he's saying or for him to
[1:19:03] speak he stood up there knowing that

[1:22:09] they knew what that blood could do amen
[1:22:12] the priests there they were they were
[1:22:13] they spent their whole lives being
[1:22:17] taught and trained how to handle the
[1:22:19] sacrifices a lamb for this dove for this
[1:22:24] goat for this a book for that if someone
[1:22:28] comes with this problem this is what you
[1:22:30] do if someone comes with this problem
[1:22:32] this is what you do and we are anointed
[1:22:34] priests unto our God you have to have
[1:22:36] the same ability that we know what our
[1:22:38] poor sacrifice is capable of a man we
[1:22:41] know what the blood of Christ can do
[1:22:43] amen and Jesus Christ is standing there
[1:22:45] at according to Hebrews he is standing
[1:22:48] there at the altar up and
[1:22:50] with the blood of his own blood he's
[1:22:53] entering the holiest of holies we're
[1:22:55] waiting to make intercession for us
[1:22:56] based upon whatever our confession is
[1:22:58] and we have been anointed to be priests
[1:23:00] and of the Most High God amen priest
[1:23:03] sent to the unto the unto the oil we're
[1:23:05] here to handle the Word of God
[1:23:07] we're here to were the new to handle the
[1:23:10] sacrifice of the God to bring the blood
[1:23:12] of Christ to the people amen to let them
[1:23:15] know what that blood can do
[1:23:17] amen to let them know what is capable of
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:21] but not just but not just a priest he's
[1:23:24] anointed us to be Kings also remember
[1:23:26] the kings were responsible first the
[1:23:30] priests were responsible for for the for
[1:23:33] the temple amen but the kings were
[1:23:36] responsible for the entire land and they
[1:23:39] could take the authority of that word
[1:23:42] that was in the Ark of the Covenant and
[1:23:44] expound it's it's era as air as place of
[1:23:48] Dominion and and 6-pound at the
[1:23:51] uttermost boundaries of Israel that the
[1:23:54] rule the word wouldn't just stop at the
[1:23:56] tabernacle door but that that rule of
[1:23:58] the word would go to the so if you're an
[1:24:00] Israelite who's whose home is at the
[1:24:03] furthermost geographical spot from the
[1:24:06] temple I don't care if you are at the
[1:24:09] point that geographically is in Israel
[1:24:11] but the furthest point away from the
[1:24:13] temple wherever that place may be if
[1:24:15] that's where your home is that you would
[1:24:17] still be underneath the Dominion of that
[1:24:18] king and that king has the
[1:24:20] responsibility of making sure that the
[1:24:23] rule of that word that was written by
[1:24:24] God's own finger and the Ark of the
[1:24:26] Covenant the commandments of the Lord
[1:24:28] are that the that the Dominion of that
[1:24:31] word has expound the furthermost
[1:24:33] boundaries of his a man there so if
[1:24:36] we've been anointed kings and priests
[1:24:38] amen we are anointed to take the the
[1:24:41] rule and the Dominion of this word amen
[1:24:45] and to bring that to the other most
[1:24:47] boundaries of our homes or our
[1:24:48] properties those are the most boundaries
[1:24:50] of our families a man to bring that to
[1:24:53] our workplace wherever we go though we
[1:24:55] are a king and a priest to our Most High
[1:24:57] God and just like salman's when he
[1:24:59] dedicated the temple he said that if any
[1:25:01] man anywhere
[1:25:02] you'd be a stranger come into this
[1:25:04] temple and pray a prayer I pray Lord
[1:25:07] that you lo would hear from heaven and
[1:25:09] answer him this prayer but we are the
[1:25:11] anointed priests and we are the Temple
[1:25:13] of the Most High God so if a Hindu or a
[1:25:15] Muslim or if anybody comes to the house
[1:25:18] of the Most High God which are we that
[1:25:20] we who've been crowned with the tender
[1:25:22] mercies and the loving kindness of God
[1:25:23] who being given the the authority to
[1:25:27] handle the sacrifice could could pray
[1:25:30] for someone with the full surety knowing
[1:25:34] that our God will hear our prayer amen
[1:25:36] that we know how to handle the sacrifice
[1:25:38] they have even if the man's now a
[1:25:40] Christians say I know a God in heaven
[1:25:43] and I and I know that he has anointed me
[1:25:47] to to bind up the brokenhearted a man to
[1:25:50] set the captives free
[1:25:51] and I see it you've been bound by the
[1:25:53] sickness but the Spirit of Lord God is
[1:25:55] upon me and he has anointed me to handle
[1:25:57] the sacrifice and I am here to tell you
[1:26:00] about the blood of the Lamb about the
[1:26:02] Almighty sacrifice and what it can do
[1:26:04] what it can obtain what his power is the
[1:26:07] power of the Almighty God the power of a
[1:26:09] resurrected Messiah who is the same
[1:26:11] yesterday today and forever I'm here to
[1:26:13] testify that he is the same yesterday
[1:26:15] today and forever it's our
[1:26:16] responsibility to bring that to the
[1:26:18] people so that they can believe so they
[1:26:20] can when they bring that in they ask you
[1:26:22] all would you pray for me brother
[1:26:24] oh you have testified to me you've told
[1:26:26] me about this Jesus Christ that he's the
[1:26:28] same yesterday today forever that he'll
[1:26:30] hear my prayer would you pray for me

[1:26:33] answer back with the full assurance of a
[1:26:35] king the full assurance of a priest that

[1:26:40] to be in that position that you're God's
[1:26:41] anointed you to pray and to know that
[1:26:44] when your prayer leaves your mouth you
[1:26:46] know that it goes right up to heaven
[1:26:47] where the blood of the Lamb is waiting
[1:26:49] there make an ease money to make
[1:26:50] intercession for whatever you pray amen
[1:26:54] Salah and it's no longer but now it's

[1:27:20] crowned with the loving-kindness and
[1:27:22] tender mercies of the Lord it's not that

[1:27:27] we have to wonder about it but he has
[1:27:29] crowned us with this amen

[1:28:02] crowned us with the Saints this is what
[1:28:05] he has given to us

[1:28:09] believe it enough we don't put it into
[1:28:11] action enough or we're not coughed or we
[1:28:14] don't give out the confidence enough to
[1:28:17] make others know that we're sure what
[1:28:19] we're speaking about amen
[1:28:21] but it's our duty amen it's our duty to
[1:28:24] have that confidence in the word amen
[1:28:27] and you only had that confidence by
[1:28:29] experience try him Saints Amen it's by
[1:28:33] the testimony say men when when you when

[1:28:37] upon the altar amen you see God answer
[1:28:40] your prayer like oh my God heard my
[1:28:43] prayer and then you can start believing
[1:28:47] for greater things amen and when you

[1:28:53] could see gray or things it's like
[1:28:55] brother Branham he always had that a
[1:28:57] little story that he preached over and
[1:28:59] over again about blind Bartimaeus yoni
[1:29:03] they say blind bartimaeus was sitting
[1:29:06] there outside the walls of Jericho he
[1:29:09] was a beggar an Israelite but he was a
[1:29:11] beggar amen and hewed and he had come up
[1:29:14] every morning he o to to beg there and
[1:29:17] he would sit down upon the rocks there
[1:29:19] that would have been sitting there ever
[1:29:20] since
[1:29:21] Joshua is gay they gave out the shout
[1:29:25] and the walls came tumbling down and the
[1:29:28] rocks were still laying there to the day
[1:29:30] bartimaeus and Bartimaeus he'd go there
[1:29:33] to bang he's like I'm sitting here as a
[1:29:34] bagger sitting on a rock that fell here
[1:29:39] at the very commandment of God sitting
[1:29:43] here as a bagger where God in his power
[1:29:46] might shook this rock down and this is
[1:29:49] where I sit begging oh my sitting here
[1:29:52] begging where the power of God was made
[1:29:54] known was made manifested a man think we
[1:29:57] do the same thing when we listen to the
[1:29:58] tapes amen we sit as beggars listening
[1:30:03] to the power of God in the prayer line
[1:30:06] it's no different than what blind
[1:30:08] Bartimaeus was doing amen and he would
[1:30:10] think back to all those all those all
[1:30:12] those Bible stories his mother told him
[1:30:15] as a child he think about how his mother
[1:30:17] would tell him about how
[1:30:19] Elisha you know you know oh oh you are
[1:30:22] Timaeus you know when you wouldn't you
[1:30:24] know Elijah we when he was when he was
[1:30:27] here on the earth just a few miles from
[1:30:29] our house here he came right down this
[1:30:32] road here Bartimaeus and he was walking
[1:30:34] arm-in-arm Elijah and Elijah and they
[1:30:37] went down to the river Jordan this river
[1:30:39] right here just where were you go
[1:30:40] fishing all the time and he went out in
[1:30:42] the part of the river Jordan and went
[1:30:44] and God Jehovah almighty
[1:30:47] you know his servant was tired Elisha
[1:30:50] from from working all the time and being
[1:30:53] about God's service and God just took
[1:30:55] him up a home he didn't have to bring
[1:30:56] any horses God provided the horses and a
[1:30:59] chariot of fire took him straight up to
[1:31:01] heaven a man and Elisha was left behind
[1:31:04] and he took Elijah's man so he went back
[1:31:07] to the River Jordan it's just that River
[1:31:08] you go fishing bartimaeus was that same
[1:31:11] river Amen the same river of you playing
[1:31:13] amen and and in Elisha camp and he smote
[1:31:17] those waters and he said where is the
[1:31:19] god of Elisha and the river parted and
[1:31:21] he walked across on dry ground and he
[1:31:24] thought back to those but as he was
[1:31:27] sitting there on that rock they've been
[1:31:28] shaking down by the power of God he's
[1:31:30] seek him back to all these Bible stories
[1:31:33] his mother told Amen me thinking about
[1:31:36] how the story about how it was just a
[1:31:38] few miles where he is standing that
[1:31:40] Joshua is after there when they're in
[1:31:43] Cantor
[1:31:43] the plains of Jordan or of Jericho that
[1:31:46] is he us got up one morning he went for
[1:31:49] a little walk and he saw a man clothed
[1:31:51] with a sword by his side and and Joshua
[1:31:54] goes up and he and he draws sorry says
[1:31:56] are you for us are you with our enemies
[1:31:59] and the man said nay but I am the
[1:32:02] captain of the host of Lord and Young
[1:32:06] Bartimaeus I want you to know that that
[1:32:09] that man was standing just a few miles
[1:32:11] from where you were born here at the
[1:32:13] captain of the host of Lourdes where you
[1:32:15] play walked upon this very ground and
[1:32:18] Bartimaeus was thinking about you know
[1:32:20] if I had been living here in those days
[1:32:23] that I would go up to that great captain
[1:32:26] of the host of lore and I say oh great
[1:32:30] captain of the Lord's host I pray Lord
[1:32:33] that you give me my sight back yo and he
[1:32:36] said you know or he'd say you know if I
[1:32:38] was living here in the days of Elijah
[1:32:40] and Elisha and I had gone up to you know
[1:32:42] like if I sit here begging it then that
[1:32:45] if I saw them walking by or heard them
[1:32:48] walking by or Haarmann armed as they're
[1:32:50] going down into the river to part the
[1:32:52] River Jordan that I would that I would
[1:32:54] say old great prophets of the Most High
[1:32:56] God I pray that you give me my sight
[1:32:59] back and I believe that the Lord would
[1:33:01] give me my sight back if one of those
[1:33:02] men would pray for me
[1:33:04] amen what we do the same thing when we
[1:33:06] listen to the tapes oh if I was only
[1:33:09] here in the days when when brother
[1:33:11] Branham was here oh if I could only get
[1:33:13] in the prayer line if I could only do
[1:33:15] that amen
[1:33:16] you know I've done the same thing in my
[1:33:18] own ministry when I first started
[1:33:19] preaching I was like Lord brother
[1:33:20] Branham you know he could he could go up
[1:33:22] to a to a pulpit like this and he look
[1:33:26] out in the audience he'd see a pillar
[1:33:28] fire come in the room in the center or
[1:33:30] someone he'd see what's wrong with him
[1:33:32] he say you sir your name is this and I'd
[1:33:34] say but Lord what have you given me
[1:33:38] you gave brother Branham those tools to
[1:33:42] perform his ministry but Lord what have
[1:33:44] you given me to perform my ministry
[1:33:46] because I am responsible for the same
[1:33:49] people that had the same kinds of needs
[1:33:52] in the same kind they come with the same
[1:33:55] expectation that God will meet their
[1:33:57] needs
[1:33:57] and God showed me I gave you the word
[1:34:00] the same exact word amen and really it
[1:34:04] wasn't the visions that healed Amen it
[1:34:07] wasn't the fact that brother Brian saw
[1:34:09] the pillar of fire the meaner healed he
[1:34:10] said I just do these things to bring up
[1:34:13] your faith but when they put inwardly
[1:34:15] putting their faith in they're putting
[1:34:16] their faith in the word of the Most High
[1:34:17] God and God heals them and it's the same
[1:34:20] thing tonight amen we may not feel in a
[1:34:23] man we might not feel his presence in
[1:34:26] the room oh yeah we know he's here
[1:34:28] because he made an appointment with us
[1:34:30] 2,000 years ago he said where you are
[1:34:33] where two or three are gathering my name
[1:34:35] I'll be right there in the midst of it
[1:34:37] hey saying when you gather in my name
[1:34:39] and you know when you gather I will be
[1:34:41] just the same as I have always been amen
[1:34:45] just the same as when I walk down into
[1:34:47] this tabernacle here
[1:34:49] one time that when Jesus was in a house
[1:34:52] that they all Sun the ceiling tiles
[1:34:54] moved aside and a man came down as they

[1:35:00] is the same God this year right now a
[1:35:03] man we might not have to tear up the
[1:35:05] roof but he's the same yesterday today
[1:35:07] and forever and he's standing there with
[1:35:09] the blood of the Lamb amen waiting for
[1:35:11] us to make a confession to say lord I
[1:35:13] know that you're the same I know that

[1:36:03] services where maybe you know or in
[1:36:05] places where Jesus wasn't being given
[1:36:07] the preeminence that he ought to have
[1:36:08] had a man but it only took one
[1:36:13] one person gave him the pre-meds one
[1:36:17] person gave him the primettes and when
[1:36:20] she went up to Jesus and and no one was
[1:36:22] paying Jesus knee attention you stand
[1:36:24] there being unloved - unwashed unkissed
[1:36:27] you know his feet were dirty you know
[1:36:29] and all that all is all he had suffered
[1:36:32] the the rejection you know of not being
[1:36:35] accepted by the ministers of that day
[1:36:37] and as all the high and mighty were
[1:36:39] sitting there and there as Jesus not
[1:36:41] being welcomed that one made him
[1:36:43] welcomed one made him welcomed and when
[1:36:47] she went up to him that then all eyes
[1:36:49] were upon him to see what she would do
[1:36:51] that she broke open the alabaster box
[1:36:53] and crying she started anointing him and
[1:36:56] in washing his feet with her hair and
[1:36:58] all of a sudden that in the midst of
[1:37:00] that all sudden everybody in that room
[1:37:02] was in the midst of a worship service
[1:37:05] amen but only two could actually enter
[1:37:08] into that worship service Christ and the
[1:37:11] woman amen and everybody else was sealed
[1:37:15] outside of the worship service amen
[1:37:19] stolen the time of true worship came to
[1:37:22] beam what is it he is right there in the
[1:37:24] midst of them just like we are here
[1:37:25] tonight amen and any of us you know I
[1:37:30] don't know well oh well I trust we all
[1:37:32] came here with the right for the right
[1:37:33] reasons I trusted it you know we're just
[1:37:35] a small crowd were humble folks I trust
[1:37:38] me I came for the right reasons but
[1:37:39] every single meeting we have an
[1:37:41] opportunity to be like that woman it
[1:37:44] only takes one Amen it only takes one
[1:37:48] when one person gives him the
[1:37:51] preeminence when one person begins to
[1:37:53] worship and with a true heart of worship
[1:37:55] when one person enters in all sudden
[1:37:58] when that worship service starts it's a
[1:37:59] thing the thing is sealed
[1:38:02] amen amen and many are sealed out and
[1:38:06] many are sealed in amen but we ought to
[1:38:10] approach every service so we can be like
[1:38:12] that one with alabaster box and we are
[1:38:15] the ones those are the ones that have
[1:38:18] their prayer answered those are the ones
[1:38:20] that he says whatsoever you ask in my
[1:38:22] name I will do it
[1:38:24] Abyan because i have crowned you with my
[1:38:26] tender mercies amen
[1:38:28] why because she layer sealed into the
[1:38:30] worship service amen there is to a woman
[1:38:33] and her Lord Amen and he is the same
[1:38:37] yesterday today and forever Amen you
[1:38:41] know over and over in a Isaiah 62 you
[1:38:48] remember how it says there is talking
[1:38:50] about Beulah land hey man you remember
[1:38:54] the scripture is that it's a it's Isaiah
[1:38:57] chapter 62 verse 4
[1:38:58] I'll read it here and it says thou shall
[1:39:01] no more be termed forsaken neither shall
[1:39:05] thy land be termed desolate but thou
[1:39:09] shalt be called hepzibah and I'll and
[1:39:13] shall be called married a man and I was
[1:39:17] looking at that a while back and I
[1:39:19] thought about I took those words and
[1:39:21] just you know for the homeschooling
[1:39:24] crowd here you know for the when you go
[1:39:28] down into your English lessons you learn
[1:39:31] about antonyms and synonyms amen
[1:39:35] because you you know when you the were
[1:39:38] an antonym is it's an English word so
[1:39:43] when you take a word like forsaken the
[1:39:46] word forsaken has antonyms and there are
[1:39:49] words that means something completely
[1:39:50] opposite of what the word forsaken so
[1:39:54] the word forsaken has a lot of different
[1:39:56] meanings but each of those meetings have
[1:39:58] antonyms that have opposite meanings
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:02] so when God here said that you will no
[1:40:05] longer be termed forsaken amen
[1:40:09] and your land will no longer be called
[1:40:11] desolate then that means that whatever
[1:40:13] those antonyms are that we get whatever
[1:40:16] the opposite is amen because we're no
[1:40:19] longer be gonna be called Forsaken we're
[1:40:21] no longer gonna be called neglected
[1:40:22] we're no longer going to be called
[1:40:24] desolate amen but instead we're gonna be
[1:40:26] called whatever the antonyms of those
[1:40:28] are that's what we get amen amen joy
[1:40:31] said in Psalm versary says it said thou
[1:40:34] shalt no more be termed forsaken neither
[1:40:37] shall thy land be
[1:40:38] term desolate but thou shalt be called
[1:40:40] Hepzibah and I'll and boola
[1:40:42] for the Lord delighteth in me and I'll
[1:40:44] and shall be married a man so the
[1:40:46] antonyms of forsake and he said there
[1:40:51] for you shall no longer return forsaken
[1:40:54] it says the the antonyms are forsaken
[1:40:56] are cherished we will be cherished by
[1:41:02] the Most High God we will no longer be
[1:41:05] called those that are forsaken but we
[1:41:08] called those that are cherished another
[1:41:11] antonym has helped will be those that
[1:41:14] are helped by the Most High God will be
[1:41:17] those that are nurtured by the Most High
[1:41:20] God will those that will be wanted
[1:41:23] desired amen Christ desires to nurture
[1:41:28] us He desires to cherish us he designs
[1:41:31] not just he desires but he does it he
[1:41:33] actually doesn't he performs us why
[1:41:35] because we're no longer called forsaken
[1:41:36] amen what were past that we've been
[1:41:39] given over that amen and your land will
[1:41:42] no longer be called neglected but it'll
[1:41:44] be the antonym of neglected is cared for
[1:41:47] considered Amen cultured brought up Amen
[1:41:52] heated or used to you know you're one
[1:41:57] that you're helpful in the kingdom Amen
[1:42:00] your land is no longer called neglected
[1:42:02] but now it's being nurtured and you're
[1:42:04] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:42:06] living water amen hallelujah amen your
[1:42:10] land and long we call desolate amen
[1:42:13] may be cultivated it'll be populated
[1:42:15] it'll be used I mean you won't be
[1:42:17] devastated he more will be built
[1:42:19] you'll be constructed you'll be enriched
[1:42:22] you'll be helped you'll be improved upon
[1:42:25] from where you once were a man why
[1:42:27] because here you go from glory unto
[1:42:29] glory unto glory why because you've been
[1:42:31] crowned with loving-kindness you've been
[1:42:34] clowned with a crown with the tender
[1:42:35] mercies of the Lord amen amen

[1:42:58] her and he says that your land will be
[1:43:02] called Beulah which is married now if
[1:43:04] those we don't take the antonyms because
[1:43:07] that the antonyms aren't given to us we
[1:43:09] take the synonyms which a synonym is
[1:43:12] something that means the same thing
[1:43:13] amen so we take these words delight and
[1:43:17] take the words married and one of the
[1:43:19] synonyms of delight and married he says
[1:43:21] that my delight is in her the light
[1:43:24] means contentment he is contented in us
[1:43:28] amen he's contented to be with us amen
