[16:28] to drink water
[16:30] let's read verse 7 1 2 3 and the lord
[16:33] said unto gideon by the 300 men that
[16:37] lapped will i save you and deliver the
[16:40] midianites into thine hand and let all

[16:54] thanking you thank you that the battle
[16:56] belongs to you lord and that song i
[16:58] thought it was very fitting i didn't

[17:02] this sermon here tonight because this
[17:04] battle belonged to you lord god and we
[17:06] thank you god that you fight
[17:08] our battles god and you give us
[17:09] inspiration when we have to put our
[17:11] little efforts into it you give us all
[17:12] that in
[17:13] inspiration and strength but lord so
[17:16] many times you fight the battles for us
[17:17] where we don't have to do really
[17:18] anything dear god we just have to praise
[17:20] you we just have to worship you and obey
[17:23] you
[17:24] and not mess it up dear god and just
[17:26] humble ourselves so we humble ourselves
[17:28] here tonight lord god we ask god did you
[17:29] speak through me and hear through the
[17:31] people hear through me as well i need
[17:33] your grace and strength i need your
[17:34] revelation each one of us do bless the
[17:36] live streamers over so happy to have

[17:40] livestream would be fixed somehow lord

[17:46] and whatever we need to learn help us to
[17:48] learn it dear god that people can hear
[17:50] your word
[17:51] and we'll give you all the thanks and
[17:52] praise thank you for all the sacrifices
[17:53] that have been made all the long days of
[17:55] work today
[17:56] and the saints still come in the house
[17:58] of god bless them abundantly in jesus
[18:00] christ's name the saint said
[18:02] amen god bless you as you're being
[18:03] seated praise god
[18:11] so we'll try to you know i'll try to do
[18:12] 40 minutes here if i can by god's grace
[18:14] we'll see how that works out and
[18:16] continue on this thought
[18:19] looking at the life of gideon
[18:24] so we're picking up where we left off
[18:26] last wednesday uh night
[18:29] by god's grace
[18:31] and we see the 300 lappers or the 300
[18:35] but uh
[18:39] okay
[18:43] all right thank you
[18:47] thank you i appreciate that
[18:53] all right
[18:57] you would think after all these years i
[18:58] could figure this out
[19:02] that better
[19:03] okay thank you
[19:06] hard to teach an old eagle new tricks
[19:08] you know it's hard to
[19:13] 300 lappers or we'd say dogs
[19:17] were accepted by god
[19:20] last week we saw how
[19:22] the army got
[19:24] uh decreased from 32 000
[19:27] down to 10 000. so 22 000 left because
[19:30] of fear
[19:31] that's what we see today many people are
[19:33] fearful won't come to church or won't
[19:36] serve god because of coveter because of
[19:38] other situations you know
[19:40] but fear
[19:42] paralyzes the majority of people that
[19:44] say they want to serve god fear
[19:46] paralyzes them what will my family say
[19:49] what will this person say so we know the
[19:51] majority of people will fall away due to
[19:53] fear and didn't jesus say that too he
[19:55] said men's hearts will be failing them
[19:57] right for fear
[19:59] so it's a very prophetic this
[20:01] portion of scripture is very prophetic
[20:03] for the end time
[20:05] and remember that was about
[20:06] uh about 70
[20:08] of the church left after that first
[20:11] uh shaving down we'd say
[20:13] and now then last week we got to 10 000
[20:16] and god said the number's still too big
[20:19] the church is still too big
[20:21] because there's too many people that
[20:23] were going to be prideful
[20:25] if they were a part of god's victory
[20:28] so god had to take down 9
[20:31] 700 more he had to send nine thousand
[20:33] seven hundred more people home
[20:36] okay
[20:37] so now it's gone down from thirty two
[20:38] thousand to ten thousand to three
[20:41] hundred
[20:42] three hundred is not even one percent of
[20:44] thirty two thousand
[20:46] so it's actually point nine percent of
[20:49] one percent it's not even one percent of
[20:52] 32 000. so when god looks it's
[20:54] interesting when god looks out of people
[20:55] we think well big numbers big faith
[20:58] not not always
[20:59] in fact very very few times is that ever
[21:02] the case right think about the two
[21:03] million that came out of israel right
[21:05] only two from the original
[21:08] group uh that were 20 years and older
[21:10] went in
[21:11] right anyone that was 19 and under
[21:14] still went in with joshua and caleb
[21:16] right but anyone that was 20 and older
[21:18] 20 was the age of accountability in the
[21:20] old testament at least for going in the
[21:22] promised land
[21:23] right so god shaves down 99 99.1 percent
[21:28] of the church
[21:29] just down to
[21:31] uh the very
[21:32] real depth of people who are not fearful
[21:35] and not prideful my prayer is god take
[21:36] all that away from me
[21:38] take my fear away take my pride away
[21:41] lord just leave take take that away and
[21:43] just leave me with faith in your word
[21:44] praise god amen and i say like this even
[21:47] for our church and every message church
[21:48] should want the same thing right which
[21:50] church doesn't want to have people that
[21:52] are humble
[21:53] and that are not afraid that are strong
[21:55] and courageous in the lord praise god
[21:58] not afraid of
[21:59] rumors of nuclear war not afraid of
[22:01] another coven wave coming this fall you
[22:03] know they're not afraid of all these
[22:04] things but they're trusting in the
[22:06] living god if god brought me through
[22:07] yesterday he'll bring me through
[22:08] tomorrow praise god
[22:10] because god is faithful and even if god
[22:11] lets me go to the grave praise god i
[22:13] mean every all the saints down through
[22:14] the ages except the couple have gone
[22:16] through the grave praise god
[22:17] some have gone in more noble ways than
[22:19] others we'd say more noble but each one
[22:21] if they were faithful to god's word then
[22:23] no doubt they received an overcomer's
[22:25] crown praise god hallelujah because they
[22:28] overcame satan
[22:30] they overcame the wicked one on this
[22:33] side hallelujah and the one thing
[22:35] they'll take with them is their
[22:36] character hallelujah so just keep that
[22:38] main thing keep the character of christ
[22:40] in your life amen because that's what
[22:42] you'll take over you'll leave your
[22:44] clothes you'll leave your jewelry
[22:46] everything else will stay here but you
[22:47] will take one thing that's your
[22:49] christ-like character hallelujah that's
[22:51] the one thing that will go over so out
[22:54] of 32 000 how many were humble and how
[22:57] many were really trusting in god 300.
[23:01] 300 out of 32 000.
[23:03] at church we can say the same right you
[23:05] can you can go on youtube and you can
[23:06] see all the mega churches think about
[23:08] how many thousands are out there how
[23:10] many are really
[23:11] uh not afraid of the end times how many
[23:14] really have
[23:15] how many are really humble
[23:17] and they just want the just give me the
[23:19] word of god i don't want any showmanship
[23:21] i don't want any hollywood i don't want
[23:23] any jokes i don't want all of that i
[23:24] just want god's word amen i just want
[23:27] faith in god's word how many would that
[23:28] be i imagine it'd be less than one
[23:30] percent
[23:31] hallelujah
[23:33] because remember brother and uses this
[23:34] scripture for the rapture he uses this
[23:37] story for the rapture now
[23:40] hopefully i'll get a little bit more
[23:41] into that but remember 300 is a pretty
[23:43] good number in scripture right 300 men
[23:47] get the victory here
[23:49] how long was the ark it was 300 cubits
[23:53] so salvation came
[23:55] in that generation through 300 cubits
[23:59] hallelujah
[24:00] it was 300 long
[24:02] mary the sister of lazarus anointed the
[24:04] feet of jesus with the perfume how much
[24:06] did it cost 300 denarii
[24:09] 300.
[24:11] so we look at this number 300 here
[24:14] how many foxes did samson catch
[24:16] 300.
[24:19] 300 and he loosed them upon the harvest
[24:21] of the philistines
[24:23] so we see this number of 300 a number of
[24:26] victory massive victory right a big
[24:28] victory
[24:29] uh through the number of 300.
[24:33] hallelujah
[24:36] so 300
[24:38] believers
[24:40] were strong in the lord and also were
[24:42] able to overcome pride because pride was
[24:44] that last one fear was the first one
[24:46] that cut everybody off the second one
[24:48] was pride so 300 were strong in the lord
[24:51] and humble a very very small group
[24:55] praise god remember we saw last week the
[24:58] ones that bowed down they were the
[24:59] self-indulgent ones they didn't keep
[25:01] their eye on the enemy
[25:03] right self-indulgence so pride is
[25:06] indulging in yourself and worshiping
[25:08] yourself right loving yourself
[25:11] and god had to cut send all those people
[25:13] home anyone that's going to self-indulge
[25:15] i got to send them home
[25:16] i want the people that are
[25:18] alert that are ready for battle amen
[25:21] that's the kind god wanted
[25:22] so god sends
[25:24] 9 700 home
[25:26] he didn't even want them hanging around
[25:28] he didn't want these prideful people
[25:29] around you so seizures sometimes god's
[25:31] got to cut off people out of your life
[25:32] so you can you can be the right kind of
[25:34] christian you should be
[25:35] he wouldn't even let him hang around he
[25:37] said go home
[25:39] you're not ready for battle go home amen
[25:41] so if god lets people come out of our
[25:42] lives praise god
[25:44] god knows what he's doing amen
[25:46] god knows how to cut off the right
[25:47] people and also send in the right people
[25:50] at the right time amen
[25:52] hallelujah god knows what he's doing
[25:55] he's building an army that's what he's
[25:57] doing
[25:58] hallelujah
[26:00] and gideon was a real man of faith like
[26:02] his 299
[26:03] brothers
[26:08] god's always in the minority i love what
[26:09] jonathan said in first samuel 14 6. he
[26:12] said there is no restraint to the lord
[26:15] to save by many or a few
[26:18] in other words jonathan knew it doesn't
[26:20] matter if there's two people or 2
[26:22] thousand if god's with us nothing can
[26:25] stop us amen
[26:27] if god has sent me here it doesn't
[26:29] matter how many people are with me if
[26:31] god has a job for me to do i'm gonna in
[26:33] other words if god gave me an
[26:35] unconditional promise it's gonna come to
[26:37] pass amen
[26:38] as we saw on sunday some are conditional
[26:40] some are unconditional but in other
[26:42] words this was unconditional
[26:45] how did that just struck me right now
[26:46] yes hallelujah is unconditional because
[26:48] gideon keep adding question after
[26:50] question after question you would think
[26:52] seeing an angel would be enough to
[26:54] convince you
[26:55] that god's going to use me but it just
[26:57] wasn't one time
[26:58] we're going to see it tonight it's 11
[27:00] times god talks to him last week i
[27:02] showed you it was already nine times he
[27:03] needs two more in this chapter you would
[27:06] think if wouldn't you just think if i
[27:07] just saw an angel come and told me
[27:09] sister who it's all gonna be all right
[27:11] god's with you i mean you would think
[27:12] that would be enough right i mean you
[27:14] would think
[27:16] right but god knows we're all human and
[27:18] god knows we're all fearful and god
[27:19] knows we're living in these pest houses
[27:21] amen
[27:22] hallelujah so god is gracious to come
[27:25] again and again and reaffirm his word
[27:29] and strengthen you and build you up in
[27:31] other words god is building up god's
[27:32] giving you everything you need in other
[27:35] words god will not let his unconditional
[27:37] promise fail hallelujah
[27:39] he's going to be with you praise god and
[27:41] jonathan said i don't care how many
[27:42] people few or many god will get the
[27:45] victory praise god
[27:47] if he's if he's doing something if if
[27:49] god is orchestrating a move that that he
[27:52] has ordained nothing can stop it nothing
[27:55] can stop it amen and god's going to make
[27:57] sure he gets your attitude my attitude
[28:00] our ideas all lined up with his word so
[28:03] we can all greet his word and say amen
[28:05] to the word of god
[28:07] hallelujah he's going to he's going to
[28:08] do it
[28:10] that's what i want to show on sunday
[28:11] lord willing i'm going to show how
[28:13] we preach on pride on sunday but this
[28:15] sunday i want to go a little bit further
[28:16] with pride
[28:17] and show how in in when god brought
[28:20] israel out of the wilderness
[28:22] god said i brought you out to test you
[28:25] to humble you
[28:27] so i want to look at that for a while
[28:29] and church then you see
[28:31] some of them accepted the humility in
[28:33] other words god ordained all these
[28:35] trials to make them more humble and
[28:37] learn i've got to rely on god for
[28:39] everything in my life
[28:41] some people learned that and some people
[28:43] didn't
[28:45] the ones that learned it kept going on
[28:47] by god's grace
[28:48] those that didn't those that couldn't
[28:50] humble themselves and just learn to
[28:52] trust in god in every situation they
[28:53] spoke against god they spoke against
[28:55] god's prophet and god let them die in
[28:57] the wilderness
[28:59] so i want to deal with that thought lord
[29:00] willing on sunday because that's a
[29:01] beautiful thought in other words our
[29:03] whole life is about learning how to how
[29:05] to humble ourselves
[29:07] and learn how to obey the promises of
[29:09] god and trust god
[29:11] that god is doing something in our life
[29:13] he's building a testimony in our life
[29:15] praise god he's bringing us to some
[29:18] testimony he wants us and he wants the
[29:20] whole world to see it praise god amen
[29:23] right because he's going to use your
[29:25] testimony on the day of judgment amen
[29:27] he's gonna use it for his glory
[29:30] and so your whole life is built upon
[29:33] humbling you
[29:34] right god orchestrates all these events
[29:36] of our life why does this seem so hard
[29:38] why does that trouble keep happening why
[29:40] do i keep battling this why all this is
[29:42] to humble us so we'll learn to trust in
[29:44] god's power not our own praise god
[29:47] amen now in verse eight
[29:51] so the people took victials those are
[29:52] meals or like food
[29:54] little meals
[29:55] in their hand now notice how much food
[29:57] did they take a handful
[29:59] in other words they didn't take a lot of
[30:01] food
[30:02] meaning god was telling them this isn't
[30:03] going to be a long fight
[30:05] praise god he didn't give him a whole
[30:07] week's worth of food here
[30:09] right
[30:11] take a handful take a mixture in your
[30:13] hand so what can you fit in your hand a
[30:14] sandwich now those days they probably
[30:16] have sandwiches right
[30:17] maybe they had like a apple
[30:20] fish so they got one meal
[30:23] and they're gonna and this little army
[30:25] of 300 is going it's going to go defeat
[30:27] 120 000. that's half of accurate because
[30:30] then we look up akron what was the akron
[30:32] population we looked that up
[30:36] wow
[30:37] so yeah take one meal and you guys are
[30:39] gonna go defeat akron
[30:41] you're gonna defeat the whole army in
[30:42] akron just on one meal on the power of
[30:45] that one meal because it wasn't gonna be
[30:46] their power it's gonna be god's
[30:48] power other words god was showing them
[30:51] take one victual in your hand you just
[30:53] need one meal this ain't gonna last very
[30:54] long if you just obey the word of god
[30:57] and notice they also took trumpets
[30:59] trumpets were sat were uh were
[31:02] instruments to declare war
[31:06] right does the bible say the trumpet
[31:08] gives an uncertain sound remember
[31:10] brother brandon preached that uncertain
[31:11] sound
[31:12] so in other words and the bible said
[31:13] every voice is as a trumpet every voice
[31:16] makes a sound of some signification the
[31:18] bible says
[31:20] so see now we can start seeing god's
[31:22] gonna when god's gonna use us when we
[31:24] fight battles for god god's gonna give
[31:26] us a meal praise god he's gonna give us
[31:28] a trump he's gonna give us a voice
[31:30] see we're kind of showing the types and
[31:32] shadows here
[31:33] and he sent all the rest of israel every
[31:35] man into his tent and remained those 300
[31:37] men and the host of meaning was beneath
[31:39] him in the valley
[31:43] now church what's interesting this
[31:44] struck me as i was studying today
[31:46] this was going to be not just a trumpet
[31:49] this was going to be the last trumpet
[31:52] anybody catch yet
[31:54] the last trump at the rapture
[31:57] this was going to be the last trumpet
[31:59] for 40 years
[32:01] because judges 8 verse 28 says thus was
[32:04] midian subdued before the children of
[32:06] israel so that they lifted up their
[32:08] heads no more and the country was in
[32:10] quietness
[32:12] 40 years in the days of gideon and the
[32:15] church said amen and notice when does
[32:18] this take place
[32:19] after the seventh year
[32:23] seven represents church ages
[32:28] hallelujah enoch was the seventh from
[32:30] adam
[32:32] enoch took a rapture
[32:34] hallelujah
[32:36] so now we see they're gonna blow the
[32:38] trumpet for the last time
[32:40] for 40 years
[32:42] so we're coming up on the last trump
[32:44] hallelujah amen
[32:46] gideon is used to blow the last trump
[32:49] hallelujah amen that's what brother said
[32:51] god is trimming down his church like
[32:53] gideon he said if you do if you obey the
[32:55] little things you'll catch the big
[32:57] things amen amen if you can obey the
[32:59] messiah like this if you can receive and
[33:01] accept the former rain you'll catch the
[33:03] ladder rain amen
[33:05] hallelujah
[33:08] glory so this was the last trump
[33:12] for 40 years and also there wasn't gonna
[33:14] be an eighth year
[33:16] it was ending after the seventh year
[33:18] amen hallelujah there wasn't going to be
[33:21] an eighth
[33:22] and eighth church age
[33:24] it was ending after the seventh
[33:26] hallelujah
[33:27] remember mount transfiguration on the
[33:29] amount of transfiguration the bible said
[33:31] after six days
[33:33] jesus took peter james and john to high
[33:36] mountain and showed them the coming of
[33:37] the lord amen
[33:39] hallelujah amen
[33:42] see that's right amen
[33:44] glory that's how i that's what i do i
[33:46] walk in the i got to leave out i walk
[33:48] right in outside amen right away right i
[33:49] walk in
[33:50] because i know it's good praise god
[33:53] but remember what did jesus what they
[33:54] what what did they see they saw jesus
[33:56] moses and elijah
[33:58] brother said moses represented the dead
[34:01] saints who were resurrected elijah
[34:03] represent the saints that didn't have to
[34:05] die those are the living saints that are
[34:07] changed in the moment and the twinkling
[34:08] of an eye praise god in other words they
[34:10] foresaw the rapture they that's what
[34:13] we're seeing here today they're
[34:15] gideon is representing the rapture
[34:16] praise god this is the last trump for 40
[34:19] years praise god
[34:20] amen
[34:22] and notice the host was beneath them
[34:25] see believers are always on higher
[34:27] ground
[34:29] church remember satan is always under
[34:31] your feet
[34:32] always
[34:34] even if you're living in sin still he's
[34:36] still under your feet all you got to do
[34:37] is say jesus forgive me and then that
[34:39] spirit will leave and you're already the
[34:41] overcomer already praise god
[34:44] amen
[34:46] they're looking down the bible said
[34:47] they're looking down upon their enemy
[34:51] see we're sitting up in heavenly places
[34:54] praise god
[34:56] we're at the place of advantage amen
[34:58] we might be small number but god is on
[35:01] our side
[35:02] and we're in a place where an elevated
[35:04] place we're sitting in heavenly places
[35:06] we see where the enemy's at and god is
[35:08] going to direct us to the victory praise
[35:10] god
[35:11] amen
[35:12] hallelujah
[35:16] thank the lord for that
[35:19] they were beneath them and that's what
[35:20] the bible says in romans this is one of
[35:22] my favorite scriptures romans 16 20 and
[35:24] the god of peace shall bruise satan
[35:26] under your feet shortly
[35:28] in other words paul is saying keep
[35:29] hanging on satan's gonna be put under
[35:31] your feet praise god
[35:33] just hang on
[35:35] because the grace of our lord jesus
[35:36] christ be with you amen what does it
[35:38] god's grace
[35:40] verse 9.
[35:41] he said the same night and it came to
[35:43] pass the same night that the lord said
[35:45] unto him arise
[35:46] get thee down into the host for i've
[35:48] delivered it into thine hand
[35:51] hallelujah so the same night or the same
[35:55] day that he sent away 9 700 soldiers
[35:59] prideful soldiers at that imagine they
[36:01] felt pretty good
[36:03] all that spirit of pride is not hanging
[36:04] around nobody's bragging about their
[36:05] muscles anymore thank god amen
[36:07] i bet they felt really good now right
[36:09] it was just calm and humble and sweet
[36:12] christians
[36:13] and all these men that were prideful i
[36:15] could
[36:16] you hear me out here did you hear what i
[36:17] did at the olympics down there at the
[36:18] the jerusalem olympics you hear what i
[36:20] did down there and my i really i really
[36:22] showed off down there
[36:24] all the pride was gone amen
[36:26] they just had humble
[36:29] simple
[36:30] warriors for god that's all they had
[36:33] they didn't have fearful and they didn't
[36:34] have
[36:36] they didn't have uh prideful either
[36:38] the same night
[36:40] a church gideon is now beginning to know
[36:42] the voice of the lord better
[36:46] and god is coming to increase his faith
[36:49] while decreasing his army
[36:52] as his army gets smaller his faith gets
[36:55] greater
[36:56] at church that's how we should be
[36:57] if the circumstances get worse our faith
[36:59] should get greater
[37:01] but you know what we're gonna we're
[37:02] gonna have to be like getting we have to
[37:03] say god help me out
[37:05] lord i need i need some signs here lord
[37:08] hallelujah i need you lord could you do
[37:11] something here i really need to answer
[37:12] my prayer
[37:13] i got an unspoken need
[37:16] you know i need god lord i need you to
[37:18] really come on the scene and encourage
[37:19] me
[37:23] so it's the same night
[37:24] and god comes to him and speaks to him
[37:27] that was in verse 9.
[37:29] arise so that means he was sitting right
[37:32] he's got his church all separate he's
[37:33] got a small little flock he's sitting
[37:34] down god said rise up now's the time to
[37:37] rise
[37:38] at the night time
[37:40] doesn't that sound familiar are the wise
[37:41] virgins
[37:43] they're all sleeping and the cry goes
[37:45] out the bridegroom comes
[37:47] go you have to meet him amen and they
[37:48] all rose hallelujah
[37:52] very same thing
[37:55] now look at verse 10. here's where i
[37:56] love god's great mercy
[38:00] now remember verse 9 he says rise up
[38:01] i've already delivered it in your hand.
[38:04] verse 10
[38:05] but if
[38:08] you're still afraid gideon
[38:11] to go down
[38:14] he says take pharah your servant down to
[38:17] the host isn't that something god said
[38:19] rise up you're going to go defeat him he
[38:21] said but if you're still a little afraid
[38:25] i'm going to give you the last portion
[38:28] of faith glory there it is let me give
[38:29] you that final anointing of faith amen i
[38:32] think that you need to overcome this
[38:35] insurmountable enemy
[38:37] this seemingly invincible enemy
[38:40] if you have any last fears church if we
[38:42] have any last fears about the rapture
[38:44] the squeeze guess what god's going to
[38:46] take it out of us amen if we're the
[38:48] bride he's got to take it out because
[38:49] this is his victory it won't be us
[38:52] glorying in what we've done it'll be god
[38:54] being gracious to us and taking out our
[38:56] fear and accomplishing his purpose amen
[39:01] god will not share his glory with any
[39:04] man
[39:06] hallelujah
[39:07] he won't share it with
[39:09] adam he won't share it with moses he
[39:12] definitely want to share with moses he
[39:13] wouldn't let moses go in the promised
[39:14] land
[39:15] he won't share with joshua
[39:18] he won't share it with
[39:19] peter
[39:20] he won't share it with brother branham
[39:23] you or i he won't share with nobody
[39:26] this is going to be god's work this is
[39:29] going to be god's testimony amen
[39:30] hallelujah
[39:32] us we're learning how to do is get the
[39:34] fear out and get the pride out and be
[39:36] humble and obey the word of the lord
[39:37] amen
[39:39] that's all we got to do praise god
[39:42] not be afraid and be humble
[39:46] and god can do a great work
[39:48] at this last trump
[39:51] hallelujah thank god
[39:57] oh glory
[40:00] now church what does this do this this
[40:02] verse verse 10
[40:03] well let's read verse 11 and thou shalt
[40:05] hear what they say
[40:07] so god tells me if you've got any any
[40:09] last fear left
[40:11] you're going to go down to the host hear
[40:13] what they say afterward shall thine
[40:15] hands be strengthened to go down into
[40:16] the host so in other words god's saying
[40:18] here you're going to get your last sign
[40:20] that you need
[40:21] and this last sign will strengthen you
[40:24] and when you hear this sign then you're
[40:26] going to be ready for battle
[40:28] in other words this is the last
[40:30] portion of faith that you need to
[40:32] receive and then you'll be ready to
[40:34] defeat the enemy
[40:36] i build up your face slowly i started
[40:38] with an angel
[40:39] praise god then a sacrifice and a
[40:41] disappearing angel
[40:43] then i met you and sent you to your
[40:45] father's house you got victory at your
[40:46] house amen
[40:48] hallelujah
[40:49] then i met you with the wool first it
[40:51] was wet and then the ground was wet i
[40:53] met you there
[40:55] and now i met you here i've given you
[40:57] i've trimmed down your army i met you
[40:59] every step of the way there's one more
[41:01] thing you need
[41:02] if you're going to be victorious
[41:04] and so i'm going to give it to you amen
[41:06] god wasn't going to keep it from him god
[41:08] was going to give it to him amen
[41:10] everything we have need of god is going
[41:11] to give to us if god is calling us he'll
[41:14] equip us amen hallelujah
[41:16] he's going to be faithful he's going to
[41:17] be merciful
[41:19] he will accomplish his victory in our
[41:21] lives
[41:23] this magnifies god's faithfulness not
[41:26] gideon's faithfulness
[41:29] because god is going to get all the
[41:31] glory gideon doesn't come out of this
[41:32] saying look at all the faith i've got
[41:36] bless god i had great faith
[41:39] i probably say that he would say
[41:44] i believe but god helped my unbelief
[41:47] does that sound familiar like jesus
[41:49] hallelujah that's what jerry says said i
[41:51] believe lord help my unbelief
[41:54] right because we've all got unbelief
[41:57] or maybe something like uh
[42:00] where where
[42:01] with man it's impossible but with god
[42:04] all things will be possible
[42:07] he wasn't going to come out of there
[42:08] with his chest all out and look what i
[42:10] did and i'm the bride and look how great
[42:12] i am look at
[42:14] god's sake saying hey i brought you this
[42:16] far
[42:17] if you got any more fear
[42:19] i've got the last bit of word that you
[42:21] need to get over that fear
[42:24] and now look gideon doesn't stand there
[42:25] and say no i don't need that i've
[42:26] already got enough faith
[42:28] right
[42:29] he didn't turn it down like oh god i
[42:31] don't need that were you joking with me
[42:32] again oh my you're so funny you got a
[42:34] sense of humor don't you lord you know
[42:36] he's like no actually i need that last
[42:37] bit of faith
[42:39] i've still got fear i just like saint
[42:41] paul amen
[42:43] he had fears within and fears without
[42:45] praise god in other words you're gideon
[42:47] i'm gideon we all need god's grace to
[42:50] bring us to perfection to bring us to a
[42:52] place where we can get a victory praise
[42:54] god
[42:55] because without him driving it out we're
[42:57] gonna have we can have any victory
[43:00] see it's god putting the situations of
[43:02] our life together to mold our character
[43:06] to expose our weaknesses
[43:10] so that he gets the glory so that we
[43:12] learn to depend on him in our tough
[43:14] situations
[43:17] so grace gets magnified mercy gets
[43:20] magnified his faithfulness that god gets
[43:22] magnified
[43:23] because this is the battle god's not i'm
[43:25] not i'm not i'm not sharing with gideon
[43:26] i'm not sharing my glory with anybody on
[43:28] this
[43:29] hallelujah and as you'll see gideon
[43:31] don't even take a sword to this battle
[43:34] the first part of the battle
[43:36] he takes the sword to the second part
[43:37] but he'll take a sword to the first part
[43:41] hallelujah
[43:43] so go down there you're going to hear
[43:44] something you're going to hear something
[43:46] that builds your faith doesn't that
[43:47] sound familiar faith cometh by
[43:49] hearing
[43:51] hallelujah you need to hear something
[43:53] right
[43:54] so he goes down there with the armor
[43:56] bearer
[43:58] just like god gave moses
[44:00] his brother aaron to go with him
[44:03] right
[44:05] see god god is mouthful i'm sorry god is
[44:07] mindful in the mouth of two or three
[44:09] witnesses every word should be
[44:10] established
[44:12] hallelujah
[44:13] and god knew gideon's hands would be
[44:15] strengthened after he heard the
[44:18] interpretation of this
[44:21] praise god
[44:23] god knew this is the last thing he
[44:24] needed to go down
[44:26] or you need to go down there to get
[44:27] strengthened
[44:29] to defeat a numberless army perhaps 120
[44:32] 000
[44:33] and god knew the last thing he needed
[44:35] was to hear that the enemy feared him oh
[44:38] hallelujah
[44:40] amen sometimes church we just need a
[44:42] reminder that satan and the devils
[44:44] tremble at the name of jesus praise god
[44:48] when you confess your sins and you get
[44:50] your mind transformed devils tremble at
[44:53] your prayers amen hallelujah that's the
[44:56] last thing gideon need to hear that the
[44:58] enemy's more afraid of me than i am of
[45:00] them amen
[45:01] hallelujah praise god amen isn't that
[45:04] right
[45:06] didn't that devil say well paul i know
[45:07] jesus i know but who are you didn't the
[45:09] devils know paul
[45:12] and didn't paul say sometimes i do
[45:13] things that i hate but i don't want to
[45:15] do them
[45:17] what does that mean he fell short but
[45:18] then he recovered right away he repented
[45:20] and got right with god don't you know
[45:22] it's the same thing with you
[45:24] god's not expecting you to do a perfect
[45:26] job of never sinning but god is
[45:27] expecting you to get cleaned out when
[45:29] you get dirty
[45:31] and come back to the battle praise god
[45:34] and then devils know you
[45:35] right
[45:37] devils know you when they bring a
[45:38] temptation but you're able to overcome
[45:40] it and cast it down the devils know this
[45:42] person is a real saint
[45:44] hallelujah
[45:46] you know you don't have to cast out
[45:47] devils like in a prayer service or
[45:49] something like that you just got to
[45:50] resist the devil and they flee praise
[45:52] god and that what the bible says
[45:54] see when you resist them then you don't
[45:56] have to cast them out because you don't
[45:58] let them inside the house amen you're
[46:00] just resisting them and then they have
[46:02] to flee and no doubt they tell other
[46:04] devils about it
[46:06] no doubt
[46:07] because they're studying you right year
[46:09] after year month after month trying to
[46:11] know your attributes
[46:13] but we must keep learning to resist them
[46:16] praise god yes satan may come in a
[46:17] different way from time to time we still
[46:19] got to resist him praise god
[46:21] we still got to rebuke him we still got
[46:23] to overcome how many will do it by god's
[46:24] grace
[46:25] amen
[46:28] glory
[46:30] so now we've come
[46:32] to the 10th and 11th
[46:34] time god has finally worked on this guy
[46:37] doesn't that sound 11 something for me
[46:38] or like 11th hour workers
[46:40] anything like does that sound familiar
[46:43] rapture anything last workers
[46:45] hallelujah
[46:47] so we see a 7 and 11 praise god
[46:50] all these godly numbers amen
[46:53] hallelujah 300 victory
[46:57] the angel gave him six words of the lord
[46:59] then he got a word from the lord you'll
[47:01] not fear then he got two signs answered
[47:03] and here in chapter seven verses nine
[47:05] and fifteen
[47:07] he gets god speaking again saying you're
[47:09] going to deliver them into your hands
[47:11] and the 11th time is when he hears his
[47:13] dream interpreted
[47:17] look at verse 12.
[47:19] well i'm sure i'm sorry we never
[47:20] finished 11. then so the second part of
[47:22] 11. then he went down with furrow and
[47:24] his servant unto the outside of the the
[47:26] armed men that were in the host and the
[47:28] midianites and the amylokites and all
[47:29] the children of
[47:30] east lay along in the valley like
[47:32] grasshoppers from multitude and their
[47:33] camels were without number as a sand by
[47:36] the sea for multitude
[47:40] praise god
[47:41] verse 13 and when gideon was come behold
[47:43] there was a man that told a dreamer to
[47:44] his fellow and said behold i dreamed a
[47:46] dream and low a cake of barley bread
[47:48] tumbled into the host of many and it and
[47:51] came unto a tent and smote it that it
[47:53] fell and overturned it that the tent lay
[47:56] along
[47:58] this is quite
[47:59] quite a
[48:00] odd story
[48:02] verse 14 and his fellow answer said this
[48:04] is nothing else save the sword of gideon
[48:08] the son of joash a man of israel for
[48:11] into his hand hath god delivered midian
[48:13] and all the hosts
[48:15] gideon hears the enemy
[48:18] talking about how afraid they are of him
[48:21] his little army of 300. now i don't know
[48:24] if they knew it was 300 or not
[48:26] but gideon gets word that they're afraid
[48:28] of him praise god
[48:30] just like the spies when they went over
[48:32] to joshua they talked to rahab right
[48:34] rahab said we know this this this army
[48:36] is mighty the devils know your prayers
[48:39] are powerful amen
[48:41] hallelujah we just saw it praise god
[48:42] with you with uh lena's mom amen
[48:45] we just saw how powerful prayers are
[48:47] amen get out satan we yell remember
[48:49] remember you yelled that brother
[48:51] we shouted jesus amen
[48:53] devils tremble
[48:55] at the name of jesus hallelujah
[48:59] thank god
[49:00] oh it's beautiful
[49:03] this is the la god knew this is the last
[49:05] thing gideon needs
[49:09] a barley of or cake barley wrote not a
[49:12] picture that a barley a circular piece
[49:15] of bread rolling down a hill hits a tent
[49:18] and knocks the tent over
[49:20] and the guy says this is nothing but
[49:23] gideon
[49:25] gideon's a piece and and barley bread
[49:28] was just the common that was the first
[49:29] harvest at the feet the first of the
[49:32] feast of first fruits
[49:33] barley was the first bread that or the
[49:35] first seed that they harvest just was
[49:37] common bread
[49:38] wheat came later
[49:40] so this was common bread it was usually
[49:42] the food for the poor and the beasts
[49:48] and so this this was not the best bread
[49:50] this was just common everyday bread
[49:53] and so now the enemies are afraid of
[49:55] this common just humble man named gideon
[49:58] the least in his father's house nobody
[50:01] special
[50:02] but somehow god has put the fear of
[50:04] getting into their hearts and they're
[50:06] afraid of this common everyday guy you
[50:08] know just he is and he's picking up
[50:10] momentum he's going downhill even though
[50:13] his church is getting smaller he's
[50:15] getting stronger amen
[50:17] although the odds seem stacked against
[50:19] him
[50:19] actually momentum is on his side amen
[50:22] hallelujah thank god because he's
[50:24] obeying the word of god amen and he
[50:26] didn't come down here to play with the
[50:28] tent he come down and knock down the
[50:30] tent amen
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:37] it's an unstoppable cake of bread
[50:41] it's a violent strong
[50:43] uh end over end cake of bread that's
[50:45] gonna it's a common despised loaf of
[50:48] bread
[50:50] that's gonna destroy the midianites
[50:53] remember the bible says god has chosen
[50:55] the foolish things of the world to
[50:56] confound the wise
[51:00] he's chosen the weak things of the world
[51:01] and first corinthians 1 27 to confound
[51:04] the things which are mighty so now these
[51:07] mighty warriors with the the shiniest
[51:09] armor and the sharpest swords the
[51:12] longest swords now they're shaking in
[51:14] their
[51:15] their their their armor over a piece of
[51:17] bread a common piece of table bread or
[51:19] or the bread you toss to animals god was
[51:22] confounding the wise how the new god was
[51:25] hiding in simplicity amen
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:29] and the fear of god comes into them
[51:32] in this mighty army
[51:35] all because well guess what the people
[51:37] cried out they heard the god said i'm a
[51:38] prophet there it is they heard the
[51:40] prophet that's another way it's like the
[51:42] rapture they cried they were in bondage
[51:44] for seven church ages right they went
[51:47] we wanted to be free from strife midi
[51:50] knights of strife division
[51:53] but they couldn't get victory
[51:55] so god sent them a prophet the prophet
[51:56] left the seed
[51:58] and the weakest ones the weakest
[52:00] christians are the ones that are least
[52:02] esteemed the least esteemed churches
[52:04] amen hallelujah the least esteemed
[52:06] message believers are the ones that god
[52:08] comes to amen
[52:10] the ones that are not prideful the ones
[52:11] that are humble the ones that will not
[52:13] fear god comes to them and he raises up
[52:16] a small but mighty army and god brings
[52:19] all their fear out and god likens them
[52:21] unto a calm and despised group of people
[52:24] but that's the people god chose for the
[52:26] battle
[52:27] amen
[52:29] seems like i'm in that type somehow
[52:32] seems like you're in that time somehow
[52:35] you know there's some common everyday
[52:36] message believers that people never
[52:38] thought to not amount to anything it
[52:40] seems like god's going to use them for a
[52:42] great quick short quick work before the
[52:44] rapture amen uh to shake up the devil's
[52:46] armies amen and get a victory and
[52:49] overcome and conquer death hallelujah
[52:52] i hope i live to see it praise god
[52:54] if not somebody's gonna live to see it
[52:56] right so let's live like we're gonna see
[52:58] it amen
[52:59] i didn't know you let's say holy
[53:02] god has chosen the weak things of the
[53:04] world to confound those that are mighty
[53:07] remember church we're like into bread
[53:09] remember that it was our text for the
[53:11] uh the communion when we had it over uh
[53:14] or resurrection weekend first
[53:16] corinthians 10 17
[53:18] for we being many are one bread and one
[53:21] body
[53:22] for all partakers that one bread
[53:25] we are a bread so gideon's army was a
[53:28] piece of bread coming down
[53:31] and bread destroys a tent
[53:34] common bread destroys the enemy
[53:37] didn't jesus say i'm that bread
[53:39] hallelujah isn't jesus the word amen
[53:41] hallelujah
[53:43] it's a bread it's a body
[53:47] how many know there's life and bread
[53:49] he said i'm the bread of what death i'm
[53:51] the bread of life
[53:53] life
[53:54] will always get the victory hallelujah
[53:58] verse 14.
[54:00] and this fellow answered and said this
[54:02] is nothing else save the sword of gideon
[54:04] the son of josh
[54:05] a man of israel for in his hand hath god
[54:07] delivered many and all the hosts praise
[54:10] god verse 15.
[54:14] oh before i move on this is also yeah i
[54:16] looked at my nose in esther 6 13 haman's
[54:19] own wife recognized her husband was
[54:21] going to fall the enemy knew they were
[54:23] going to fall
[54:24] the devil knows his days are limited
[54:27] that's why he's
[54:28] uh battling as hard as he can but
[54:30] abraham said satan is like a wounded
[54:32] animal and whenever you see a wounded
[54:34] animal you know you don't go up to them
[54:35] because they're going to just lash out
[54:36] they know they're wounded they can't
[54:37] right and so satan is lashing out today
[54:39] at the generation that the culture right
[54:42] he's lashing out this is the last
[54:43] attempt
[54:45] remember brother brahm said he said the
[54:46] homosexual was so bad in his day he
[54:48] didn't see how there could be another
[54:49] generation well look how it's advanced
[54:51] now
[54:52] like i was telling that to brother
[54:54] maybe austin or some other one but we're
[54:56] saying remember in sodom they had gangs
[54:59] of men that were violent and doing very
[55:01] wicked things in gay and nobody stopped
[55:03] it
[55:06] and jesus said as it was in the days of
[55:08] lot so must it be in the days of sodom
[55:10] i'm sorry the days of the coming of son
[55:11] of man
[55:14] so see it's it's it's it's been
[55:16] corrupted beyond even what brother
[55:17] random imagined
[55:19] see
[55:21] so thank god thank god he's protected us
[55:22] church thank god
[55:25] but the world will do what the world
[55:27] wants to do god has to give them over
[55:29] because that's what they want to do
[55:33] verse 15 and it was so when gideon heard
[55:35] the telling of the dream and the
[55:36] interpretation thereof that he
[55:38] worshipped
[55:40] glory
[55:41] and returned in the house of israel and
[55:43] said arise for the lord hath delivered
[55:45] into your hand the host of midian
[55:48] so as soon as getting hers wow there was
[55:51] a dream
[55:53] and the dream was interpreted a dream
[55:55] interpreted becomes a
[55:58] prophecy
[55:59] vision
[56:00] so what did he need he needed another
[56:02] vision
[56:03] he needed another prophecy he needed one
[56:06] more supernatural
[56:08] dream from god amen
[56:10] where he heard the enemy
[56:13] testifying about what god was going to
[56:15] do amen how do you know you praise god
[56:18] thank you jesus
[56:21] and gideon stopped and he worshiped
[56:23] right there
[56:24] see when god blesses you you're not
[56:26] ashamed to stop and praise the lord
[56:28] hallelujah when you see god's hand
[56:30] minister i was praying as i i prayed i
[56:32] remember i said oh lord you just you
[56:34] blessed me so much i just was crying and
[56:35] thanking the lord right before i come up
[56:37] just to sing the songs here i just oh
[56:38] yeah that's right i forgot to thank the
[56:40] lord thank you jesus you are jehovah
[56:43] jireh amen
[56:44] before i needed it you already gave it
[56:47] hallelujah
[56:48] how great you are
[56:50] so they're not afraid to worship
[56:52] immediately
[56:54] when they hear the word of god or when
[56:55] they see god's word come to pass they're
[56:57] not afraid to worship
[57:00] he returns to the camera and say let's
[57:01] rise up
[57:03] i've got my 11th sign
[57:06] i've got the last thing i need in other
[57:08] words i've got the latter rain
[57:11] i've got the last thing i need
[57:13] all my fear is gone
[57:15] glory
[57:16] every prayer i've prayed god has
[57:18] answered oh church can you imagine if we
[57:20] ever got to a spot like that
[57:22] and this persecution comes on the screen
[57:24] comes on can imagine we will pray for
[57:26] things and god you know we'll say in a
[57:28] matter of a few weeks all these prayers
[57:30] are coming to past church we start
[57:31] seeing dead dead ones raised from the
[57:33] dead and i mean every fear would be gone
[57:36] no matter how insurmountable the enemy
[57:38] looked we would know god answered our
[57:40] prayer he gave me everything i asked
[57:42] he's kept his word every dream has come
[57:44] to pass amen i believe and nothing can
[57:47] stop us amen
[57:50] if god did that in the natural old
[57:53] testament under blood bubbles and goats
[57:54] what about now amen
[57:56] where he's going to do something even
[57:57] greater praise god
[58:00] going to defeat death
[58:02] in the moment and the twinkling of an
[58:04] eye hallelujah
[58:10] i believe this there's gonna be more
[58:11] than 300 go in the rapture
[58:13] i hope so by god's grace how many we got
[58:15] here tonight one two three five six
[58:16] seven eight ten twelve about 15 here
[58:17] tonight so yeah we're just a small
[58:19] little group praise god
[58:20] we're going i already believe they're
[58:22] going by god's grace
[58:23] he didn't call me for this for me to
[58:25] fail praise god
[58:27] like getting he didn't call me to fail i
[58:29] was the least esteemed right where we
[58:30] see ourselves we're the least esteemed
[58:34] we're the rejected ones but that just
[58:36] qualifies us to be used by god as he
[58:39] takes away all of our fear
[58:41] amen
[58:43] hallelujah
[58:46] the church remember this was the one two
[58:48] three four this was the fourth time
[58:50] gideon was afraid there's my 40 minutes
[58:52] so i'll give myself five more here
[58:58] that was the fourth time gideon the
[58:59] minute he was afraid
[59:01] and god knew it god said but if you're
[59:02] afraid i'll give you one more dream
[59:05] interpreted i'll give you one more
[59:06] prophecy
[59:09] and it's exactly what you'll need to
[59:10] hear i need to know that even the enemy
[59:12] knows they're going to lose
[59:14] even the enemy is afraid of me because
[59:16] god's with me
[59:18] not because i'm anything but because
[59:20] god's with me
[59:21] hallelujah
[59:24] beautiful
[59:28] verse 16.
[59:36] verse 16. and he divided the 300 men
[59:38] into three companies so 100 in each
[59:41] company
[59:42] and he put a trumpet in every man's hand
[59:44] and enemy pitchers and lamps within the
[59:47] pictures
[59:51] i want you to notice here he divides
[59:53] them up in order to surround the host
[59:57] now remember this is a
[59:59] host in the valley that was huge
[1:00:02] the bible the bible says like
[1:00:03] grasshoppers right this is so many
[1:00:06] but god's going to have 100 over here
[1:00:09] 100 over there
[1:00:10] there's a triangle that must represent
[1:00:12] god somehow hallelujah
[1:00:16] and every man needed these in his hand
[1:00:21] he needed an empty pitcher
[1:00:24] a lamp lit with
[1:00:26] fire and a trumpet
[1:00:31] now notice 300 men going out to battle
[1:00:34] 120 000 soldiers
[1:00:38] 300
[1:00:40] you know what that reminds me of
[1:00:42] abraham one time took 318
[1:00:46] trained servants
[1:00:48] by the power of god
[1:00:50] and he went out and whipped five kings
[1:00:54] he come back
[1:00:55] and he met melchizedek and melchizedek
[1:00:57] said oh blessed be you
[1:00:59] of elohim amen
[1:01:01] hallelujah that's what abraham said i
[1:01:03] know god gave me the victory here's a
[1:01:05] here's my tithe amen
[1:01:08] the only reason i got this victory which
[1:01:10] was because you gave it to me
[1:01:11] melchizedek amen
[1:01:13] so i'm coming to bring you the tithe
[1:01:16] so gideon could have went against out in
[1:01:18] this battle knowing i've got less than
[1:01:20] abraham
[1:01:21] but the same god that defeated
[1:01:23] five kings with abraham can defeat
[1:01:26] a hundred twenty thousand with my group
[1:01:28] as well
[1:01:29] because jesus christ is the same
[1:01:31] yesterday today and for how do you
[1:01:33] believe he can still do it
[1:01:35] hallelujah
[1:01:37] god does whatever he wants amen
[1:01:41] what it takes is the same faith
[1:01:44] the same humility to say lord i still
[1:01:46] need more signs
[1:01:48] lord i'm still a little afraid
[1:01:50] i believe but help my unbelief
[1:01:55] right
[1:01:57] lord if you're going to do this lord
[1:01:59] please help me out
[1:02:01] i need your strength i can't bring this
[1:02:03] to pass on my own i'm learning i'm
[1:02:05] understanding i can't do this on my own
[1:02:07] i need your help
[1:02:10] and god's voice will somehow come back
[1:02:12] and say okay this situation is going to
[1:02:13] happen i'm going to allow this to happen
[1:02:15] so your faith rises in my promises
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] notice again it's attacked by night
[1:02:26] god looked at him the angel looked at
[1:02:27] him said get in you mighty man of valor
[1:02:30] go cut him down at night time when
[1:02:32] nobody's around you mighty man of valor
[1:02:36] here he says now you're going to get a
[1:02:38] victory over 120 000 go at nighttime
[1:02:41] you mighty woman of valor
[1:02:44] night time
[1:02:46] night time the victory at night time
[1:02:48] evening time glory amen
[1:02:50] evening time hallelujah
[1:02:52] they actually went on at midnight
[1:02:54] bible said the middle watch
[1:02:59] so just take your trumpet
[1:03:02] your empty picture or picture
[1:03:05] and your lamp
[1:03:07] just take those three did you see sword
[1:03:09] in there
[1:03:10] no
[1:03:11] and yet pretty soon i'll preach it next
[1:03:13] wednesday they shouted the sword of the
[1:03:16] lord and of gideon and they don't even
[1:03:18] have any swords on him at that moment
[1:03:22] because a natural sword is not what god
[1:03:24] wanted them to have
[1:03:27] it wasn't the sword of man it was the
[1:03:29] sword of god hallelujah
[1:03:32] let's stand to our feet by god's grace
[1:03:34] musicians can come i better stop right
[1:03:36] there that's 45 minutes
[1:03:45] hallelujah
[1:03:49] how many want god to take out all fear
[1:03:52] and all pride
[1:03:54] how many realize we have a great battle
[1:03:55] ahead of us
[1:03:57] we have a tremendous enemy that we face
[1:04:00] now some of us have certain battles
[1:04:03] certain things we're praying for in our
[1:04:04] lives right now
[1:04:06] that's those are major obstacles those
[1:04:08] are major enemies but we all have this
[1:04:10] enemy of fear we all this enemy have
[1:04:13] this enemy of fear of what's going to
[1:04:14] happen in the next few years
[1:04:18] will free will free speech be taken away
[1:04:23] will the will we need permission to
[1:04:25] preach as brother branham said there's
[1:04:26] going to become a boycott against the
[1:04:28] churches
[1:04:31] are we ready for that enemy
[1:04:34] hallelujah
[1:04:36] he said if you when you go out you
[1:04:38] humble group you humble church you real
[1:04:39] small church he said just take your
[1:04:41] trumpet which is your voice
[1:04:44] just take your take an empty vessel
