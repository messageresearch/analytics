[0:49] genesis 6 11.
[1:02] i was surprised to learn churchill an
[1:04] estimate today
[1:05] it was estimated three to four billion
[1:07] people
[1:09] died in the flood
[1:23] at the end there was only one family
[1:25] left that really believed the word of
[1:26] god
[1:28] all other minds all their families the
[1:30] reminder is filled with imaginations of
[1:31] wickedness all the time
[1:33] jesus said as it was in the days of noah
[1:35] so shall be the days that come into the
[1:36] same man
[1:38] genesis 6 11. i'll read and then we'll
[1:40] read verse 13 together here
[1:42] the earth also was corrupt before god
[1:44] and the earth was filled with violence
[1:46] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[1:48] it was corrupt for all flesh had
[1:50] corrupted his way upon the earth
[1:52] verse 13 let's read that together one
[1:54] two three and god said unto noah the
[1:57] beginning of all flesh is come before me
[2:01] for the earth is filled with violence
[2:03] through them and behold behold i will
[2:06] destroy
[2:08] one more word of prayer here heavenly

[2:25] nation

[2:28] your leadership here tonight in jesus
[2:30] christ
[2:41] the earth was filled with violence
[3:02] phone i'll just text it to you real
[3:04] quick so thank you
[3:06] yeah it's on right now silky
[3:19] so hopefully she'll be on just a few
[3:20] minutes god bless sister
[3:22] uh stephanie
[3:24] and all the livestreamers god bless
[3:26] everybody
[3:28] the earth was filled with violence
[3:33] we know
[3:34] uh the scripture is repeating in this
[3:35] day and we know every two thousand years
[3:37] god has to do something to the earth
[3:40] the first two thousand years god had to
[3:42] destroy
[3:43] three to four billion people that's half
[3:45] the world's population that we have
[3:47] today
[3:48] three to four billion people probably
[3:50] died during the flood of noah's day
[3:53] every heart every imagination except one
[3:56] family
[3:58] had totally been given over to uh the
[4:00] bible says violence the bible also says
[4:02] marrying and giving to marriage right
[4:04] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[4:07] the godly scene line was choosing to
[4:08] marry based upon looks rather than
[4:10] character
[4:11] and so god had become fed up with it
[4:14] god had given two thousand years of
[4:16] grace two thousand years of grace two
[4:18] thousand
[4:19] and here we are it's about two thousand
[4:21] years of grace as well right since that
[4:23] great second major event the second
[4:25] event was the greatest event of all time
[4:26] it was the death of jesus christ and his
[4:28] resurrection hallelujah the greatest
[4:31] event there ever was the greatest
[4:32] weekend there ever was amen
[4:34] and brother ham says you know the cross
[4:36] was the greatest day then sometimes he
[4:37] says or then other times he says the
[4:39] resurrection was the greatest day so i
[4:40] just say the greatest weekend amen
[4:42] hallelujah they're both they're all the
[4:44] great days they're the whole weekend
[4:46] but then jesus said in luke 17 26 we're
[4:49] very familiar we can probably all quote
[4:50] it by heart as it was in there of noah
[4:53] so shall it be also in the days of the
[4:54] son of man they didn't eat they drank
[4:56] they married wives they were given in
[4:58] marriage until the day that noah entered
[5:00] in the ark and the flood came and
[5:02] destroyed them all
[5:03] likewise also as it was in the days of
[5:06] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[5:08] they sold they planted they build it
[5:11] but the same day the lot went out of
[5:13] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[5:15] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[5:17] shall it be and the day when the son of
[5:19] man is revealed
[5:20] praise god the word of god is true i
[5:22] know jesus prophesied these days amen
[5:25] he prophesied of it and so we see the
[5:27] first two thousand years flood next two
[5:29] thousand years the blood of christ the
[5:31] last two thousand years it's going to be
[5:32] a fire baptism for the earth right god's
[5:35] gonna come and destroy the outside of
[5:37] the earth he's going to renovate the
[5:39] earth the earth's crust with fire right
[5:41] atomic fire the bible has a fervent heat
[5:44] yeah right but the man said it made he
[5:46] said it might be volcanic ashes
[5:48] volcanic fire as well that's right from
[5:50] the heart of the earth he said it could
[5:52] be uh atomic fire
[5:54] so it could be a combination but he's
[5:56] going to burn uh the outside the
[5:58] perimeter
[5:59] with fire and start all again by the
[6:01] grace of god the bible says the
[6:03] righteous thank god your righteous
[6:04] church the righteous will walk upon the
[6:06] ashes of the wicked my goodness
[6:08] hallelujah bye
[6:10] the earth is filled with
[6:24] the reason uh the the god had to send
[6:27] the flood is because the people hated
[6:28] god they didn't want to retain the word
[6:30] of god they didn't want to listen to
[6:32] noah's preaching they don't listen to
[6:34] enoch's preaching right we saw last week
[6:37] because they're ungodly deeds and
[6:38] they're ungodly words they're ungodly
[6:40] speeches god had to come in and destroy
[6:43] them right with the flood of noah's day
[6:47] romans 1 28
[6:49] says they did not like to retain god in
[6:51] their knowledge god gave them over to a
[6:53] reprobate mind and do those things which
[6:54] are not convenient
[6:56] so the root problem is hatred for god
[6:59] being filled with all unrighteousness
[7:00] fornication wickedness covetous
[7:02] maliciousness full of envy murder
[7:06] debate deceit malignity whispers
[7:09] backbiters haters of god despiteful
[7:12] proud boasters inventors of evil things
[7:15] disobedient to parents without
[7:18] understanding covenant breakers without
[7:19] natural affection implacable unmerciful
[7:22] who knowing the judgment of god
[7:25] that they which commit such things are
[7:27] worthy of death not only do the same but
[7:30] have pleasure in them that do them
[7:33] right they just you know on social media
[7:34] they'll just clap on all the people that
[7:36] that continue to speak evil things
[7:38] they'll clap on abortions they'll clap
[7:39] on uh uh
[7:41] any evil wars and
[7:44] unjustified wars and lies they'll just
[7:46] clap on any evil thing and homosexuality
[7:48] and transgenderism they'll just clap and
[7:50] they have pleasure in them that do them
[7:53] that's the state of the world that we
[7:55] see today and ultimately they hate the
[7:57] word of god right but we love the word
[8:00] of god praise god amen we're standing
[8:01] for the word of god true in this dark
[8:03] day just like noah's day amen
[8:05] we're not the type of noah but we're the
[8:06] type of enoch amen right that type of
[8:09] enoch brother but it's a wicked day the
[8:10] saint
[8:11] the bible said murders jesus said
[8:13] murders originate from the hearts of men
[8:16] in mark 7 21
[8:19] for from within out of the heart of men
[8:21] proceed evil thoughts adulteries
[8:23] fornications
[8:24] murders and so we see where it
[8:27] originates in the heart of man
[8:30] now in mark 15 7 it's a it's the uh
[8:34] the text of mark in the gospel where
[8:36] jesus is on trial before pilate and the
[8:40] people are given two choices they're
[8:42] given jesus or barabbas right
[8:45] right but the rap said you were the
[8:46] barabbas
[8:47] yeah and the church said amen i'm gonna
[8:49] preach that maybe next year for uh for
[8:52] easter and
[8:53] good friday the man said we were all
[8:55] barabbas
[8:57] but they were given a choice in verse
[8:58] seven and there was one named barabbas
[9:00] which lay bound with them that had made
[9:02] insurrection with them who committed
[9:03] murder in the insurrection
[9:06] and the multitude crying aloud began to
[9:08] desire him to do as he had ever done
[9:11] unto them and pilate answered them
[9:13] saying will ye that i released on you
[9:15] the king of the jews
[9:16] for he that for he knew that the chief
[9:18] priests had delivered him for envy
[9:20] but the chief priest moved the people
[9:22] that he should release barabbas unto
[9:25] them
[9:26] now the people were given a choice do
[9:27] you want a murderer or an innocent
[9:30] do-gooder
[9:32] an innocent pure man to win a murder or
[9:35] a pure word and they said give us the
[9:37] murder in church the same is produced
[9:40] today praise god the united states and
[9:42] every other nation would rather have
[9:43] murderers than jesus christ the word
[9:46] how do you know because they kicked
[9:48] jesus christ out of this out of the
[9:49] schools
[9:50] they take jesus christ out of the
[9:52] businesses
[9:53] out of the government courtrooms all
[9:55] right yeah and i'll say like this they
[9:56] kicked him out of the churches amen
[9:59] but not our church amen
[10:00] jesus welcome here hallelujah he's
[10:02] always welcome here amen
[10:04] hallelujah brother says when he gets
[10:06] here then you got to welcome him here
[10:09] praise god amen when he comes you got to
[10:11] make him feel welcome kiss the son lest
[10:13] he be angry
[10:15] we must make it when we feel his
[10:16] presence we must make him feel good make
[10:18] him feel welcome entertain the holy
[10:20] spirit amen
[10:23] hallelujah the u.s would rather have
[10:25] murders than jesus christ they'd rather
[10:27] have that
[10:28] because if they had jesus christ they'd
[10:29] have the word of god
[10:31] but they turned on the word of god
[10:34] and so this is the effects
[10:36] that we're reaping and sowing today
[10:39] rather
[10:40] reaping today
[10:41] the bible said these are works of the
[10:43] flesh in galatians 5 19.
[10:45] it is the flesh that wants to murder it
[10:47] is the flesh that wants to be violent
[10:50] it is not the soul of a believer
[10:53] it says the works of the flesh are
[10:54] manifest which are these adultery
[10:56] fornication and cleanness lasheviousness
[10:59] idolatry witchcraft hatred hatred
[11:02] variants emulations wrath stripes
[11:04] additions heresies endings murders
[11:07] drunkenness revelings and such life of
[11:10] the which i tell you before as i have
[11:11] also told you in the past that they
[11:13] which do such things shall not inherit
[11:15] the kingdom of god
[11:17] when a man or woman lets these wicked
[11:19] things come out of their lives without
[11:20] repentance god will keep them out of his
[11:22] kingdom those things have no place in
[11:24] his kingdom his kingdom is a holy
[11:27] kingdom amen his kingdom is a righteous
[11:29] kingdom this is a kingdom of grace amen
[11:31] this is a kingdom of goodness hallelujah
[11:33] and mercy hallelujah and he'll keep
[11:36] anyone who does the works of the flesh
[11:37] to keep any one of them out
[11:40] because they live in the flesh rather
[11:41] than living to the soul yes
[11:44] hallelujah
[11:47] the real problem of course is the
[11:49] wickedness in the heart of man
[11:53] first john 3 15 says whosoever hated
[11:56] this brother is a murderer and you know
[11:58] that no murder half eternal life abiding
[12:01] in him
[12:05] so what is the difference between us and
[12:07] the world the difference between us is
[12:09] that we have eternal life praise god
[12:12] we have a source of strength inside of
[12:14] us that the world doesn't have they
[12:16] can't understand it
[12:18] but we receive the life of god and it
[12:20] makes us cry abba father amen when you
[12:24] have a life of god when you're a child
[12:26] of god it makes you cry to the father
[12:28] and it makes you intercede to the father
[12:30] it makes you talk to the father it makes
[12:31] you long for the father amen it makes
[12:34] you want to keep in contact with the
[12:35] father hallelujah
[12:37] amen
[12:38] but murders have not this life
[12:43] no i'm not going to go this direction
[12:44] but church we can murder people with our
[12:45] words
[12:47] right we know that we can kill their
[12:49] influence and all we have to do is say
[12:51] lord jesus forgive me i'm sorry
[12:53] take that out of my heart
[12:55] amen
[12:56] that quote he said if you're going into
[12:57] meeting with somebody he said and you
[12:59] don't love him he said first tell them i
[13:01] don't love you and let's pray so i can
[13:03] love you because if i don't love you i
[13:05] can't help you
[13:07] right that's what he says
[13:08] be honest with people if you don't love
[13:10] them tell them and then be honest with
[13:12] god say god put love in my heart amen
[13:15] so i can love
[13:16] people i'm trying to help praise
[13:18] god that's the real difference is love
[13:21] love makes all the difference so love is
[13:22] eternal life
[13:24] but murders have not love in their
[13:26] hearts
[13:28] so the real problem
[13:29] is
[13:30] love of sin and it's a hatred for god
[13:33] and his word
[13:35] now church some of you may know this or
[13:37] not i don't know you might not
[13:42] there's been hundreds and hundreds of
[13:44] school shootings yes
[13:46] and also subway shootings and anywhere
[13:48] just mass shootings we'll just call it
[13:50] like that
[13:51] hundreds and hundreds
[13:53] and i went and uh as i was studying this
[13:55] you know today
[13:57] i thought where did all this start and
[13:58] it goes back to 1995.
[14:02] now there's there's other other mass
[14:03] killings different things but as far as
[14:05] this recent generation
[14:08] there was a movie called the basketball
[14:09] diaries i never watched it thank god i
[14:11] never watched it
[14:16] uh
[14:17] leonardo dicaprio's in it he's this
[14:18] famous guy as a wicked man as far as we
[14:20] know
[14:22] and in the movie they glamorize shooting
[14:25] up a school
[14:28] two years later 1970s or 1997 there was
[14:31] a mass shooting in kentucky
[14:33] that
[14:34] the the the boys that did it did exactly
[14:36] like the movie
[14:39] the the victims went and sued the movie
[14:41] theater and won over hundreds of million
[14:43] dollars
[14:46] so
[14:46] so so it's obvious
[14:48] people mimic what they see
[14:52] right
[14:54] and then think of columbine i was alive
[14:55] i was in high school in colombia that
[14:57] was a very strange a very strange time
[14:59] when the columbine shooting happened
[15:01] in colorado
[15:05] and it's just been going to universities
[15:07] and schools and sonny hook and
[15:09] connecticut i mean
[15:11] there's so many happen we just forget
[15:12] about because there's so many
[15:15] where does this start it starts why by
[15:17] satan planting these thoughts in
[15:19] people's minds and the people
[15:22] don't cast these thoughts down they they
[15:25] take a reprobate mind they choose to
[15:27] hate the word of god if they let the
[15:29] word of god retain in their minds they
[15:31] would they would have love in their
[15:32] hearts
[15:33] hallelujah if they retain the love of
[15:36] god in their hearts and minds they fear
[15:38] god
[15:39] but instead they they take god all other
[15:41] minds and they put these evil songs and
[15:44] now now it's in video games of course uh
[15:46] covers of course in benson's then but
[15:48] it's so much in video games and movies
[15:50] and music and church i just saw the
[15:52] statistic the other day teenagers spend
[15:54] at least four hours on uh online or tv
[15:58] every day four hours
[16:00] four hours you think that's all good
[16:02] stuff
[16:03] it's all trash amen yeah and they're at
[16:06] school for seven hours a day
[16:08] and how much of that time are they
[16:09] getting this evil stuff put in there all
[16:11] the conversations they're having think
[16:12] of that how much time do they actually
[16:13] talk to their parents in there probably
[16:15] like one minute or less than that 30
[16:17] seconds
[16:18] yeah so the devil is pouring in hour
[16:20] after hour of poison and they get one or
[16:23] two minutes and then like roman says
[16:24] then you take them to church for sunday
[16:26] school and you expect them to be perfect
[16:28] or expect them to turn out good
[16:32] whatever you put in the child is gonna
[16:34] come out praise god now it's not a
[16:36] guarantee every time
[16:38] but the bible says if you train up a
[16:39] child in the ways it goes and when it's
[16:41] not old it'll not turn from it praise
[16:43] god
[16:44] there's probability the probability is
[16:46] if you put the word of god in the church
[16:48] does not put this on children let's put
[16:49] it on all of us if we put the
[16:51] before that i do want to go show about
[16:53] the united states i wrote this in my
[16:54] book my second book
[16:56] speaking of america's history like
[16:59] israel america quickly fell from her god
[17:01] very beginnings in the roaring 20s think
[17:04] of that right
[17:07] less than
[17:08] 140 something years after starting the
[17:10] roaring 20s saw the rise of rebellious
[17:13] women who cut their hair
[17:14] wore makeup for the first time mini
[17:16] skirts smoked and dance in defiance of
[17:18] god's holiness and we're not just
[17:20] putting on the women the men let them do
[17:21] it
[17:22] sure the men the ones the men are the
[17:24] ones that opened up
[17:25] the the the clubs so they could do it
[17:28] right they could have shut it down
[17:31] remember we saw that on mother's day who
[17:32] gets the word who gets the worst
[17:34] absolute worst judgment it's men it's
[17:36] evil leaders jesus said you pharisees
[17:38] will have the greater condemnation right
[17:41] because you led all these people astray
[17:44] they have the authority they had the
[17:45] ability they had the key to the door but
[17:47] they kept they kept themselves out and
[17:49] they kept other people out jesus greater
[17:51] damnation will you have all right
[17:55] oh but much more great rewards will have
[17:58] for swinging that door open wide and say
[18:00] come into the kingdom of god let the
[18:02] little children come unto me praise god
[18:04] amen hallelujah
[18:06] glory
[18:09] most men stood there and they liked it
[18:11] they permitted it with weakness and fear
[18:13] and shame
[18:15] holly wrote hollywood rose to claim
[18:17] during the great depression of the 1930s
[18:20] usher in this court this cultural
[18:22] corruption
[18:23] the 1950s brought in elvis presley rock
[18:26] and roll planted the seeds for the
[18:27] sexual revolution of the 1960s
[18:34] jfk was elected in 1960
[18:36] in 1962 prayer was taken out of schools
[18:43] abortion was uh
[18:45] legalized in 1973 there's been 64 or 65
[18:49] abortions i'm sorry 64 65 million
[18:52] abortions since 1973
[18:55] the church how how much is that cup of
[18:58] iniquity filling up here tonight
[19:00] how much is that cup of iniquity
[19:02] 63 million worldwide
[19:05] abortion since 1973.
[19:09] remember the bible says all those
[19:11] all those voices cry the blood cries to
[19:14] god
[19:15] from the earth
[19:18] homosexuality was moved out of the list
[19:20] of mental disorders in 1973 and then on
[19:23] june 26 2015 the supreme court legalized
[19:26] this abomination
[19:28] look how fast and look how far the
[19:30] nation has fallen
[19:33] since they took god out of everything
[19:37] every morning though at school when i
[19:38] when we said the pledge means i was
[19:39] pointing by saying one nation under god
[19:41] i let all the kids see me
[19:43] because i know we're still one nation
[19:44] under god as long as i got a chance to
[19:46] share it i'm gonna share it by god's
[19:47] grace i'm gonna say that extra louder
[19:49] under god amen
[19:51] hallelujah
[19:53] our constitutional right praise god
[19:57] now
[19:58] it's fallen so fast we see that
[20:01] i want to now move back here to the
[20:03] scripture because
[20:05] some people say that
[20:07] uh the bible is very violent and that's
[20:09] true
[20:11] but god has a purpose behind it yeah
[20:14] sure
[20:16] now i got this from a preacher john
[20:18] piper of course i don't agree with much
[20:20] of what he says but i used to like him a
[20:22] lot before i come in the message
[20:23] he lists three reasons
[20:26] why the bible's so violent and
[20:28] actually the most violent book of all is
[20:30] probably the book of judges
[20:33] so he says
[20:35] the first reason so violent because it
[20:37] shows what happens when there's no civil
[20:39] authority there's no king and there was
[20:41] no prophet in those days yeah
[20:43] so when you don't have a king and you
[20:45] have a prophet and you don't have
[20:46] retribution for wickedness
[20:48] men and women will do about anything
[20:51] they will they will fall so far so fast
[20:55] there's no limits to the wickedness that
[20:56] they do if there's not a godly king and
[20:58] a prophet on the scene
[21:01] so why is the bible so violent it shows
[21:02] you what happens when there's no civil
[21:04] authority
[21:06] and there's no prophet in the land
[21:09] second
[21:11] violence on the earth shows how awful
[21:14] rebellion against god truly is
[21:16] that's what violence actually shows it
[21:18] actually shows how awful it is to deny
[21:20] the word of god
[21:22] right
[21:23] it shows us the of sin
[21:26] and it all started with adam and eve
[21:29] yeah
[21:31] so that's why the bible has to be
[21:32] violent it shows this is what happens
[21:35] this is the effect of disobeying the
[21:37] word of god amen
[21:39] all men die in adam glory but all men
[21:42] are made alive in christ jesus amen
[21:45] hallelujah thank god
[21:47] thank god for christ jesus amen
[21:52] now i'm going to say the third one to
[21:53] the end
[21:54] that's what i'm going to close with
[21:56] that's the best one
[21:58] now church the bible is extremely
[22:00] violent i'm just gonna give you some
[22:01] examples as i said the days of noah's
[22:03] flood three to four billion
[22:07] men and women drunk children animals
[22:10] that's not good animals that's just
[22:12] humans
[22:16] did you know 500 000 men died in
[22:18] israel's civil war under king jeroboam
[22:21] 500 000. that's in second chronicles
[22:24] chapter 13.
[22:26] now that's a little less than our
[22:28] american civil war
[22:30] so i looked up some online mailchimp
[22:32] right now about that more than i would
[22:33] but 600 000 anywhere to 1.5 million
[22:36] of our own men
[22:38] of our own americans
[22:42] but israel had these
[22:44] awful
[22:46] mass
[22:47] deaths as well remember with the many
[22:49] nights how many died 120 000
[22:52] yeah midnight
[22:54] died in that one battle then i think
[22:55] there was 15 000 more that gideon and
[22:57] his his sword took care of
[23:02] there's many many examples let me read a
[23:04] couple more here i found this it looks
[23:05] like a reliable website it's the ones i
[23:07] looked at it was pretty reliable
[23:12] 185 000 were instantly destroyed by god
[23:16] in second kings 18 and 19. it was king
[23:19] senator
[23:20] remember when he come against your host
[23:22] of fat joseph like what do i do lord he
[23:24] said just praise the lord in the house
[23:26] of god a prophet came in and said just
[23:28] praise the lord amen
[23:30] hallelujah
[23:31] while they were worshiping
[23:34] the angel lord went out and destroyed
[23:35] all those 185
[23:38] 000
[23:39] men died at one one one day
[23:43] the syrian men that died
[23:48] and israel did not have to fire a single
[23:50] arrow in their defense
[23:52] amen
[23:53] god was fighting for his people amen
[23:58] now 140 000 plus died in another civil
[24:01] war in judges chapter 20. remember when
[24:04] the benjamites did this wickedness and
[24:06] all the other tribes went up against the
[24:08] vengeance right because of the wicked
[24:10] they did to the the man's concubine
[24:12] right
[24:15] 140 plus thousand died in that civil war
[24:21] 127 000 syrians were killed by ahab in
[24:25] first kings chapter 20.
[24:28] over 100 000 syrian foot men and then 27
[24:31] 000 others
[24:33] died in that battle
[24:34] 127 000.
[24:40] now this one is
[24:41] really shocking as well
[24:43] seventy thousand israelites died as a
[24:45] punishment when david
[24:48] did his sentence and numbered the people
[24:51] remember god gave him a choice remember
[24:52] that
[24:54] is it gonna be you
[24:56] is it gonna come upon you and you and
[24:57] you but he said just let it be the three
[24:59] days of pestilence yes three days of
[25:01] festivals
[25:03] seventy thousand
[25:06] remember twenty four thousand died after
[25:08] the plague of male pior
[25:11] twenty four thousand died in one day
[25:18] 24 000.
[25:23] now church the bible is clear it is
[25:26] god's will that not one little one
[25:28] perish
[25:30] matthew 18 14 even so it is not the will
[25:33] of your father which is in heaven that
[25:35] one of these little ones should perish
[25:37] amen to that amen it's not god's will
[25:39] it's not god's perfect will
[25:41] right
[25:46] if you look at verse 10 matthew 18 verse
[25:48] 10 take heed that he despise not one of
[25:50] these little ones for i say unto you
[25:51] that in heaven they're angels who always
[25:53] behold the faith of my father which is
[25:56] in heaven
[26:02] so these are scriptures
[26:04] we believe we believe them with all of
[26:06] our hearts
[26:09] but god has to allow free more agency
[26:13] he has to
[26:14] or else he will be unjust on the day of
[26:16] judgment right
[26:19] if not a person can say well you made me
[26:21] do this
[26:22] you can't send me to hell because you
[26:23] made me murder these people no i'm
[26:26] saying no i didn't
[26:27] no
[26:28] i let you be tempted but everybody was
[26:31] everybody was tested i said i i let you
[26:33] be i allowed it i allowed it to happen
[26:36] because everybody must be tempted
[26:38] everybody must be tested because our
[26:40] life is a trial of our faith right
[26:44] it's a trial to live by the holy spirit
[26:46] or the unholy spirit
[26:48] which spirit do you want to live by you
[26:49] only by hatred or do you want to live by
[26:51] love we're living by the love of god
[26:53] today praise god amen amen it's not the
[26:56] will of god that one of these little
[26:57] ones should perish
[26:59] thank you lord now remember there's four
[27:02] reasons
[27:04] god allows suffering went over on uh
[27:06] sunday night but uh not everybody heard
[27:08] it
[27:08] first god allows suffering for self
[27:11] knowledge you understand you you have
[27:13] knowledge of yourself better and you can
[27:16] judge yourself better
[27:18] right
[27:20] if we suffer physically it helps us to
[27:23] understand the effects of our sin what
[27:26] it does to other people
[27:28] right
[27:29] when we suffer we can say wow this this
[27:32] this cold or this was really awful or
[27:33] this covered was really awful or
[27:35] whatever we suffered with
[27:37] but that reminds us of the effects of
[27:39] sin
[27:40] it reminds us
[27:43] that
[27:44] our sin has done awful things against
[27:46] god's word
[27:48] so we judge ourselves and we see the
[27:50] evil effects of our own sins
[27:52] and it brings humility to us
[27:55] that's the first reason
[27:56] so you have a self-knowledge of yourself
[27:58] and a self-judgment you can judge
[28:00] yourself
[28:02] well because i did this i would because
[28:03] this happened to me i'll never do that
[28:05] to anybody else
[28:07] i suffered and so because i suffered i'm
[28:09] going to make sure nobody suffers like
[28:10] that
[28:11] right amen
[28:14] the second reason we suffer is to learn
[28:16] obedience like jesus
[28:18] sometimes god if we don't obey god give
[28:21] a spanking after scourging after
[28:22] scourging until we finally learn to obey
[28:25] praise god
[28:26] we've been better off but we would have
[28:27] done it the first time the church said
[28:29] amen
[28:31] sometimes we won't obey so god's got to
[28:33] make us suffer so we will obey
[28:36] third we suffer because it brings
[28:38] greater greater fruitfulness
[28:41] the bible said jesus suffered like no
[28:43] man ever suffered but the bible said
[28:45] because of that he was exalted to a
[28:47] place higher than the heavens amen amen
[28:49] he said because he died alone the bible
[28:52] said he would see his seed hallelujah he
[28:54] would see the generations after the
[28:57] multitudes and men's the believers that
[28:58] would come after him this he would see
[29:00] and see because that one holy see would
[29:02] plant it that sea would multiply thanks
[29:04] god amen amen
[29:08] and then we suffer so we can be a
[29:09] testimony to other people
[29:12] true
[29:14] well brother you know you struggle with
[29:16] this well listen i struggle with that
[29:17] too but i overcome you can overcome
[29:19] amen
[29:20] remember the bible said god will not
[29:22] give you a test that you can't overcome
[29:27] i'm so glad he put those limits on him
[29:28] praise god i'm so glad he put a limit
[29:30] and said god won't let brother jesse be
[29:32] tempted where he couldn't handle it
[29:34] it's too much for him no no i can handle
[29:36] everyone because i can do some things
[29:38] through christ who strengthens me no i
[29:40] can do all things through christ who
[29:41] strengthens me
[29:43] hallelujah
[29:49] i just like this scripture luke uh you
[29:51] pope luke 2 30 2 34 2 35
[29:58] this was at jesus dedication and simeon
[30:00] blessed them and said unto mary's mother
[30:02] behold this child is set for the fall
[30:04] rising again of many in israel and for a
[30:06] sign which shall be spoken against
[30:09] so this for a sign jesus christ lived
[30:11] here for a sign
[30:14] yeah a sword shall pierce through his
[30:16] own thy own soul speaking of mary also
[30:19] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[30:21] revealed
[30:23] praise god so jesus was manifested and
[30:26] his life was a sign and it showed his
[30:29] life made you decide which side you're
[30:30] going to be on
[30:31] right it was a sign to everybody this is
[30:33] a holy man this is god's son this is the
[30:36] son of god
[30:37] surely this man was a son of god and it
[30:40] was a sign
[30:42] and it reveals that the hearts your our
[30:45] response to that reveals our hearts
[30:47] today
[30:48] hallelujah so it is today a christian's
[30:50] life today a christian that lives the
[30:52] right kind of life their life is a sign
[30:55] hallelujah
[30:57] not only are you a witness that helped
[30:59] other people but you're a sign for good
[31:02] you're a sign that people can look at
[31:03] and say there's a real believer i know i
[31:05] know there's one it's sister so-and-so
[31:08] right it's brother so-and-so
[31:10] praise the lord and you have to live a
[31:12] life so your life
[31:14] manifests and then it reveals the people
[31:16] around you reveals what's in their
[31:18] hearts amen
[31:19] that's true
[31:21] that's true
[31:22] so sometimes you have to suffer
[31:26] right so that hearts can be revealed
[31:27] around you
[31:28] right and that kind of goes that thought
[31:30] of the perhaps people will be saved
[31:33] right when you suffer someone might come
[31:34] to your health or your aid
[31:37] they might come to secure you the bible
[31:38] says
[31:39] yes to help you out and that will reveal
[31:42] what's in people's hearts and lives
[31:44] amen amen
[31:46] so those are four reasons god allows
[31:48] suffering how but i put a fifth in there
[31:50] to manifest the desire of each heart for
[31:53] that that could be a lap over but it
[31:54] could be part of one of the other ones
[31:56] like jesus's life and ministry did
[31:59] it manifested it revealed what was in
[32:02] the hearts of the people and so it is
[32:03] today church with violence we see today
[32:05] or these uh all the awful things going
[32:07] around the world it manifests what's in
[32:08] people's heart
[32:10] whatever side they take on it it shows
[32:11] what's in their heart yeah it's easy to
[32:14] tell what's in people's heart
[32:16] it's easy to tell if good things are in
[32:18] their hearts or of evil things in their
[32:20] hearts
[32:27] see god allows suffering because he must
[32:30] allow free more agency
[32:32] and either fill up your cup of blessing
[32:34] or fill up the cup of iniquity
[32:37] is that right
[32:38] genesis 15 15 and i shall go to thy
[32:41] fathers in peace speaking of abraham
[32:42] thou shalt be buried in good old age but
[32:44] in the fourth generation so 400 years
[32:46] later they shall come again hither for
[32:48] the iniquity the amorites is not yet
[32:50] full
[32:52] so in 400 years finally the cup of the
[32:55] amorites is going to be filled up
[33:00] so god said i'll not these people are
[33:02] wicked in the canaan's land but i'm not
[33:04] going to judge them for 400 years left
[33:06] our nation's had over 250 years we're
[33:08] getting close to the cup being full
[33:10] praise god yeah
[33:13] and with technology and people living
[33:14] longer that allows more deaths to happen
[33:17] because people live longer
[33:19] right
[33:23] and so it's filling up
[33:28] now the last mention i could find of the
[33:30] amorites was in uh solomon's time
[33:34] in second chronicles eight
[33:36] well
[33:37] chronicles
[33:39] eight seven seven chronicles eight seven
[33:42] as for all the people that were left of
[33:43] the hittites and the amorites and the
[33:44] parasites and the hivites and the
[33:45] jebusites which were not of israel but
[33:47] of their children who were left after
[33:49] them in the land whom the children of
[33:50] israel consumed not them did solomon
[33:53] make to pay tribute unto this day
[33:57] so god held off the wrath but once
[33:59] israel went in the promised land god
[34:01] started pouring out his wrath god
[34:03] started pouring out
[34:05] temporary judgments upon all these
[34:07] nations he let it go for so long let it
[34:09] go for so long and then god then come
[34:11] down full and god poured out the wrath
[34:13] upon them true praise god
[34:16] god in other words god was so merciful
[34:18] praise god he was so rich in mercy
[34:22] giving them hundreds and hundreds of
[34:23] years to repent
[34:26] but wait until the time was right
[34:29] and then some of them even survived some
[34:31] of them
[34:31] a small remnant of each of these ones
[34:33] survived
[34:37] church ezekiel 33 11 says say it say
[34:40] unto them as i live say the lord god i
[34:42] have no pleasure in the death of the
[34:43] wicked
[34:45] but that the wicked turn from his way
[34:46] and live turn the eternity from your
[34:48] evil ways but why will you die or house
[34:50] of israel
[34:52] yeah god didn't delight not having to
[34:54] pour out those judges no no it's not
[34:56] something you look forward to no
[34:58] no the bible is thus saith the lord
[35:01] saith the lord god this is thus saith
[35:02] the lord
[35:04] in other words if god allowed them to be
[35:07] destroyed then then god had given them
[35:09] so many times so much time that god knew
[35:11] they were not going to turn back now
[35:12] sure
[35:15] let it go as far as it can go
[35:18] all right i've got to intervene here but
[35:20] he does not delight in that
[35:23] that's why even preachers or christians
[35:25] or anyone that delights in the death of
[35:26] the wicked they got a wrong spirit
[35:28] they don't have the holy spirit
[35:31] because jesus even from the cross what'd
[35:32] he say father condemned them he said
[35:35] father forgive them they don't know what
[35:36] they're doing
[35:38] i know there's other times you talked
[35:39] about the children of hell with the
[35:41] pharisees and things like that but you
[35:43] gotta bounce you gotta you gotta include
[35:44] the other ones too praise god you gotta
[35:46] include all of them
[35:49] you gotta look at all them
[35:56] let's look at a few scriptures here uh
[35:58] on another thought here
[36:02] today was a busy day so you forgive me
[36:04] my notes are they're all like oh look i
[36:06] gotta find them they're not the right
[36:07] order i'll say it like that so forgive
[36:08] me
[36:11] now i got this from the living waters
[36:13] website my kids are like the living
[36:14] waters website we like that website
[36:17] it's called why do bad things happen to
[36:19] good people
[36:20] i just i'll read this yeah i'll quote
[36:21] this website he says why do bad things
[36:23] happen to good people the biblical
[36:25] answer is there are no good people
[36:28] except jesus amen
[36:30] in mark 10 18 jesus said that only god
[36:32] is good because god is good he will see
[36:35] to it that justice is done on the day of
[36:36] judgment
[36:38] if god gave each of us justice now every
[36:40] one of us would end up in a terrible
[36:42] place called hell and we would all
[36:43] deserve it
[36:45] didn't i just read you on sunday brother
[36:46] said i'm not worthy to live
[36:49] church said amen
[36:50] i'm not worthy i'm not fit to live
[36:54] right everyone deserves judgment
[36:57] because their own rebellion to the word
[36:59] of god
[37:01] he said god is the standard of
[37:02] righteousness and all of us have fallen
[37:03] short of that standard there aren't
[37:05] really any good
[37:07] people
[37:08] that bad things happen to
[37:11] a better question is why does god allow
[37:13] good things to happen to bad people
[37:16] yeah
[37:17] why does god allow good things to happen
[37:19] to bad people that's a better question
[37:22] right
[37:23] and that's because that's what god said
[37:25] jesus said be like your heavenly father
[37:26] he sends rain on what the good and the
[37:28] evil the just and the unjust why would
[37:31] god send rain on unjust people
[37:34] but he does sure he does because he's
[37:37] merciful
[37:38] long suffering
[37:41] it says with reasons known only only to
[37:43] god he demonstrated his love for us and
[37:45] the fact that while we were yet sinners
[37:47] christ died for us amen in spite of our
[37:49] evil wicked sinful nature god still
[37:51] loves us he loved us enough to die to
[37:53] take the penalty for our sins when he
[37:55] was crucified on the cross
[37:57] often things happen to us that we simply
[38:00] cannot understand instead of doubting
[38:02] god's goodness in times of suffering we
[38:04] should trust him we should echo the
[38:06] words of job though he slay me yet will
[38:08] i trust him amen praise the lord
[38:11] the book of job shows us that god is
[38:13] trustworthy amen even though we don't
[38:15] understand the surroundings around us
[38:17] praise god amen
[38:19] this ends with this i like it kind of
[38:21] kind of brings it back to full circle
[38:23] why do bad things happen to good people
[38:25] he said that only happened once
[38:27] and he volunteered for it
[38:30] that was jesus amen
[38:35] bad things only happened to one good
[38:36] person that was jesus christ amen
[38:39] praise god
[38:44] you know uh
[38:47] about seven years ago when we first
[38:48] moved in here
[38:50] or was it in there i can't remember we
[38:51] used to have a brother come to the
[38:52] church named kevin i know you remember
[38:53] brother kevin
[38:55] his 18 year old son was killed in a
[38:57] motorcycle accident
[39:01] and uh
[39:02] he come up for prayer one time after i
[39:04] preached he said he said brother jesse
[39:06] he said this is just such a weight on me
[39:09] he said can you pray for me and church i
[39:11] don't know what it was in that moment
[39:12] but in that moment i felt like i had
[39:15] lost a son
[39:17] and we wept together wow right together
[39:20] he thanked me numerous times after that
[39:22] of course he left the church right we
[39:24] loved him
[39:26] but at the wedding the last wedding we
[39:27] went to stephen's wedding
[39:29] some of the people from the church that
[39:30] that's his home church now
[39:32] they come up to me and said
[39:34] wait you're the brother that brother
[39:36] kevin talks about all the time that
[39:37] prayed with him and
[39:39] he said god gave him a real touch when
[39:41] you prayed for him praise the lord
[39:43] praise the lord
[39:44] hallelujah
[39:46] bless the lord i don't know what it was
[39:48] it was a strange strange moment sister
[39:49] who was like the holy spirit come down
[39:51] it's like i could feel his faith
[39:53] it's praise god
[39:58] and we don't even know why god allows it
[40:00] we don't know why
[40:01] all right in that moment it's like the
[40:02] holy spirit brought down at least a
[40:05] bit of comfort a bit of peace yeah
[40:08] a bit of consolation that god knew what
[40:10] he was doing and this man now goes
[40:11] around and tells people about it just
[40:13] that moment just that moment of peace
[40:15] just that moment
[40:17] uh of a touch from god god's a
[40:18] vindication of the holy spirit praise me
[40:20] wonderful that god knows our sufferings
[40:22] wonderful god knows what we go through
[40:24] and god cares what we go through praise
[40:26] god sure yes he does
[40:31] he said it
[40:33] there's at least
[40:36] let's see i found at least three reasons
[40:37] god takes young people home early
[40:42] pull up isaiah 57 1.
[40:50] the righteous perish and no man laith at
[40:52] the heart and merciful men are taken
[40:53] away and none consider that the
[40:55] righteous is taken away from the evil to
[40:58] come
[41:00] sometimes god takes people
[41:02] to spare them from awful things that are
[41:04] going to happen later
[41:06] that's the first reason sometimes god
[41:07] takes the other ones
[41:09] number two
[41:13] we don't have to pull this one up but
[41:15] god may allow it as a test to other
[41:17] believers
[41:19] as in the case of job's seven children
[41:21] being killed
[41:22] by satan
[41:24] with that storm
[41:26] in job 1 verses 7 to 12 job was being
[41:29] tested when his seven children died that
[41:30] was a test
[41:33] would he curse god boys the test he'll
[41:35] curse god
[41:36] you've just surrounded with all these
[41:37] blessings if you just take these away
[41:39] he'll curse you he don't serve you
[41:41] because he loves you
[41:42] and job had to come face to face with
[41:44] the hardest test of his life
[41:46] but thank god he passed the test amen
[41:48] he loved god amen
[41:50] more than anything else he loved god i
[41:52] mean love god more than anything else
[41:54] that ought to be that ought to be your
[41:55] prayer that i'll be in your testimony
[41:57] church we're not guaranteed a bed of
[41:59] roses
[42:01] we're not guaranteed to easy life we're
[42:02] not guaranteed prosperity naturally
[42:05] now we are guaranteed spiritual
[42:06] prosperity if we if we
[42:08] if we go on to know the lord
[42:13] other times
[42:14] young people die because of dishonoring
[42:17] parents proverbs 20 verse 20. this is
[42:20] the more sadder one
[42:21] but again only god i mean god will know
[42:23] in these situations
[42:25] whoso curseth his father or his mother
[42:27] his lamp should be put out in obscure
[42:29] darkness wow
[42:31] there's at least three reasons now
[42:32] church that's that's my little small p
[42:34] brain right there's probably many many
[42:37] more reasons why god would take a young
[42:38] person
[42:39] i just want you to show there's even
[42:41] grace in there god would keep someone
[42:42] from evil things that would come upon
[42:44] their lives
[42:46] because god is all-knowing
[42:48] yes he is
[42:49] god cares praise amen yes he's the god
[42:52] of grace yeah which is unmerited favor
[42:55] yeah he's the god of grace yes
[42:58] hallelujah
[43:01] thank you jesus remember
[43:03] the death of the saints is precious in
[43:05] the sight of god
[43:08] psalm 116
[43:10] 15. pull that out there 1 16
[43:14] 116 15.
[43:18] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[43:20] death of the saints of course that
[43:21] separated one
[43:23] saint is a separated one who chooses
[43:24] purposely to separate from the things of
[43:26] the world
[43:31] and again the lord will not allow the
[43:33] trial to come upon us
[43:35] that is above our ability to handle
[43:38] we'll never get to a spot where i say
[43:39] this is too hard i've got to end my life
[43:41] i can't i can't i can i can't go on
[43:43] it never gets that hard
[43:46] see satan tricks people into thinking
[43:48] that
[43:48] he deceives them the bible says he sets
[43:50] a snare and that people get caught in
[43:52] his trap
[43:53] into thinking i can't handle this church
[43:55] we can do all things glory we can do all
[43:57] things through christ who strengthens us
[43:59] i'm gonna say it again you can do all
[44:01] things through christ who strengthens
[44:02] you
[44:03] [Music]
[44:06] people pull that out to play a better
[44:08] football game they'll have to play a
[44:09] better basketball game
[44:12] but then they'll avoid it in tough times
[44:14] like this
[44:20] or they'll avoid it when the lord wants
[44:22] to send me another child
[44:25] because they don't want another child
[44:27] well i can't handle it well i can do all
[44:29] things through christ
[44:34] oh i can't handle this yes you can
[44:37] if god is for us who can be against us
[44:39] praise god amen amen
[44:41] hold out there first corinthians 10 13.
[44:43] first corinthians 10 13.
[44:54] there have no temptation taking you but
[44:55] such is as common to man but god is
[44:58] faithful who will not suffer to be above
[45:00] that ye are able but will with the
[45:02] temptation also make a way of escape
[45:05] that you may be able to bear praise god
[45:07] amen
[45:08] faithful able to bear
[45:11] church let's say let's set it together
[45:12] say i'm able to bear can we i'm able to
[45:15] say it again i'm able to the bible says
[45:18] you're able to bear things you're able
[45:20] to bear your sufferings your trials
[45:22] you're able to bear it it won't be too
[45:23] hard for you
[45:25] it won't be too difficult it won't be
[45:26] too confusing
[45:28] trust the lord hallelujah trust god in
[45:30] every situation yeah he's faithful he
[45:32] won't give you something you can't
[45:33] handle
[45:36] the problem
[45:37] so we see all these reasons god is
[45:38] suffering god takes young people
[45:46] now i want to just share a few things
[45:47] here before i close i wasn't going to
[45:48] preach too long here tonight
[45:51] just because i wanted to lay some things
[45:52] out here
[45:54] the real problem with all this murder is
[45:56] demon possession
[45:58] because matthew 8 44 says
[46:01] you're you are your father the devil and
[46:03] the lust of your father ye will do
[46:05] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[46:07] a bow not in the truth because there is
[46:09] no truth in him when he speak of the lie
[46:11] speakers of his own for he's a liar and
[46:14] the father
[46:15] yes amen
[46:17] that's right
[46:20] i just want to just say a few things
[46:26] the president went on last night and
[46:28] talked about solutions to this problem
[46:32] i completely disagree with him
[46:37] how many mass shootings will it take for
[46:39] anyone to use common sense
[46:45] like i heard a guy say on on the news he
[46:47] said this nation just sent 40 billion
[46:50] dollars
[46:51] to ukraine for what
[46:53] so they can
[46:55] it's fight
[46:55] even our land you're right
[46:57] if they could put 40 40 billion to
[46:59] another country why don't they put 40
[47:01] billion into the schools trying to cop
[47:02] in every school right
[47:04] amen everywhere there's cops there's
[47:06] never a shooter mad shooter is there
[47:08] because they don't want to get shot
[47:09] right
[47:12] it's total hypocrisy yeah
[47:15] the leaders of this nation
[47:16] total hypocrisy they could solve the
[47:18] problem like that
[47:20] if they wanted to
[47:23] how come those guys don't go into
[47:25] police officer buildings and do the mass
[47:27] shootings
[47:32] because they'll be dead in five minutes
[47:34] sure one or one five seconds whatever
[47:36] you're gonna say
[47:38] or the place that i have security guards
[47:40] that are armed why don't they go shoot
[47:42] up shoot that place up
[47:43] they're cowards they go to these places
[47:45] where there's no there's no guns
[47:48] the truth is these wicked leaders
[47:51] they need death they need tragedy to
[47:54] keep their power and increase their
[47:55] power until they lay down the mark of
[47:57] the beast
[47:58] that's the truth amen they want this
[48:01] type of tragedy and destruction because
[48:04] it will help them to get more power
[48:06] right
[48:08] because what they really hate is
[48:09] christians that's what they really hate
[48:11] that's it
[48:12] that's true
[48:15] it's so true
[48:17] you know when that abortion like now
[48:18] they're saying no more guns no more guns
[48:20] no more guns no more death no more death
[48:22] yet uh two weeks ago
[48:24] they were marching outside of supreme
[48:25] court supreme court horse or houses
[48:27] rather saying we want death we want
[48:29] death we want death
[48:31] do you catch that
[48:32] they're saying we we want to kill we
[48:34] want to kill but then when it comes to
[48:35] the guns we don't want we don't want
[48:37] them dead we don't want them dead
[48:39] you can't have a
[48:40] they're murderers you can't have it both
[48:42] ways like that
[48:44] and like they were telling me there's a
[48:45] law in california almost coming up where
[48:47] they can have abortions after the baby's
[48:49] born
[48:51] up to two weeks they're trying to get in
[48:52] california they're trying to get up to
[48:54] two weeks after a baby's born they could
[48:56] take the baby in so i don't want anybody
[48:58] trying to make it legal merciful that is
[49:01] just back to the days of uh
[49:03] the days of baal worship where they have
[49:04] humans baby sacrifices yeah
[49:06] yeah just back to that
[49:09] right now it's all worth it worse it's
[49:10] all evil it's all it's all wickedness
[49:13] but the same people that are
[49:15] are saying get rid of the guns so we can
[49:16] save life are the ones marching for
[49:18] death
[49:22] they sent trillions of dollars after
[49:24] coven for relief to schools for
[49:27] fruit roll-up
[49:28] fruit roll-ups and uh cereal boxes
[49:31] sister naomi i don't know if your kids
[49:32] get they offer to the kids every day
[49:34] free food they get free lunches for two
[49:36] years because of cobin
[49:38] trillion a trillion dollars
[49:41] instead of sending food what they send
[49:43] to police officers
[49:45] and some healthy food not cocoa puffs
[49:48] to rot their brains and their bodies
[49:50] right
[49:50] yeah it's ridiculous isn't it 40 million
[49:53] ukraine one trillion for covet and they
[49:55] won't even save the lives of these
[49:57] innocent little ones it's hypocrisy
[50:00] yes it is
[50:03] when are they gonna use common sense
[50:08] you know
[50:09] murders rapes everything is going up in
[50:11] every
[50:12] liberal city right now in america it's
[50:14] the highest it's ever been philadelphia

[50:18] number of homicides and murders

[51:10] yeah
[51:16] you know stephanie's proud listen she
[51:18] sent me a text last night after i'd gone
[51:19] to bed i got it this morning when i woke
[51:20] up at 5 30 and
[51:23] she said please pray for those 21
[51:25] families affected i said i certainly
[51:26] will so i did
[51:28] but i texted her back and i said
[51:30] also don't remember there was 21 that
[51:32] died yesterday but i said there was also
[51:34] 3 000 that died
[51:36] in abortion clinics
[51:40] every day in america three thousand
[51:42] babies
[51:44] are killed
[51:46] every day
[51:50] a guy one of my friends i told you about
[51:51] that guy
[51:52] i passed every time i go into giant
[51:54] eagle he's an older guy catholic guy
[51:58] he said they said pray for that i looked
[52:00] i
[52:00] he said pray for those families i said i
[52:02] will i put my hands on the shoulder i
[52:04] said sir and i said we need to pray for
[52:06] those 3 000 mothers today who murdered
[52:08] those babies that they'll be convicted
[52:10] and repent of that and not go back to
[52:11] the abortion clinics
[52:14] right don't we need to do that
[52:20] see these these hypocrites and liars
[52:22] they get all said about 21 we're upset
[52:23] about it too it makes me cry all right
[52:26] but what about the 3 000
[52:28] right
[52:30] don't those lives matter
[52:32] don't the lives of chicago and
[52:34] philadelphia don't those lives matter
[52:36] absolutely they all matter
[52:39] and if they had the love of jesus christ
[52:40] in their hearts it would matter to them
[52:43] and they would use some common sense
[52:47] they could do it
[52:48] they could protect the kids but they
[52:50] don't want to they need the tragedies
[52:53] they need to lay down a mark they need
[52:55] to lay down their agenda
[52:58] and that's why they're going to keep
[52:59] allowing it
[53:03] now for jesse do you pray that they'll
[53:05] change things yes i do pray but i know
[53:07] it's highly unlikely
[53:09] but i still pray amen
[53:14] that's because of ezekiel let me go to
[53:16] ezekiel 30 here go to ezekiel 30. i
[53:18] showed this to austin i think i showed
[53:19] it with some again
[53:28] earth was filled with violence
[53:33] is it east eco 30 or i think easy go 22
[53:36] let me just check my
[53:39] 22 yeah i'm sorry zico 22 verse 30 sorry
[53:42] honey i got it
[53:50] church did you know this
[53:52] god did not destroy israel in the days
[53:55] of the old testament and kicked them out
[53:56] of the land until there was a time when
[53:58] nobody was interceding in prayer anymore
[54:03] now we know it'll never get that way for
[54:05] america right but it'll be fewer fewer
[54:06] fewer because we'll always have holy
[54:08] ghost-filled saints here until the
[54:09] rapture they'll always be frightened
[54:12] but god now look god said i was looking
[54:14] for a man among them that should make up
[54:16] the hedge
[54:17] and stand in the gap before me for the
[54:19] land that i should not destroy it but i
[54:21] found none
[54:23] god is looking where's a believer in
[54:24] jerusalem where's the believer in the
[54:26] promise and that will pray for me to
[54:28] have mercy on this place and he couldn't
[54:30] find any wow
[54:32] there was no more left
[54:34] that's why i believe in the power of
[54:36] prayer still amen because i've got
[54:38] children
[54:39] and they could have a future i don't
[54:41] know it's in god's hands there could be
[54:43] more generations yeah right they're
[54:45] going to outlive me if things go normal
[54:46] according to the normal
[54:48] things of life
[54:51] and so what is god in jesus christ is he
[54:54] not the same yesterday today forever
[54:56] he is the same yesterday today and
[54:57] forever
[54:58] didn't jesus say in john 4 24 god is
[55:01] looking he's seeking actively seeking
[55:04] for true worshipers who worship in
[55:06] spirit and in truth praise god amen
[55:08] hallelujah
[55:10] but once he found noah in the days of
[55:11] ezekiel ezekiel was taken out of the
[55:13] promised land as well he was a
[55:14] babylonian prophet
[55:18] once
[55:19] once all the men stopped crying inside
[55:21] for the abominations then the
[55:22] destruction came in
[55:26] now only god knows when the rapture is
[55:28] the day and the hour is up to god
[55:32] but i'm saying while we're here we
[55:34] should pray
[55:35] for mercy
[55:36] amen we should pray for people to be
[55:38] saved
[55:39] i still pray for the god to i know god
[55:42] raises people up but i know god can pull
[55:43] him down as well
[55:46] i still believe in that
[55:49] now we need to do uh first up phones
[55:51] five one
[55:52] i'm about to say this at the beginning
[55:53] first thessalonians five one
[56:00] that's not the problem
[56:03] one two and three premier scriptures
[56:07] this has to be because it's prophecy
[56:09] jesus talked about it luke 17. paul
[56:11] talked about it the whole world is going
[56:12] to be saying peace and safety for the
[56:14] times and seasons brethren you have no
[56:16] need that i write unto you
[56:18] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[56:20] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[56:22] the night in other words they would know
[56:24] the time and season of the rapture
[56:26] right we can see it we can see all the
[56:27] prophecies i made a video about it 14
[56:29] signs were in the end time now there's
[56:31] probably 10 or 20 more
[56:34] for when they shall say peace and safety
[56:36] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[56:38] as travail upon a woman with child and
[56:41] they shall not escape
[56:44] so see there's got to be this violence
[56:45] there's got to be this wickedness
[56:47] there's got to it's got to match the
[56:48] days of noah as we know
[56:50] but midst of it all god doesn't want the
[56:53] wicked destroyed
[56:56] god is merciful and if god allows little
[56:58] ones to go no matter how they go
[57:01] god has a reason for it and you can
[57:03] trust god
[57:04] hallelujah that's the only one we can
[57:06] trust is god almighty praise god amen
[57:08] hallelujah true
[57:14] the earth is filled with violence
[57:19] so the last reason why is the bible so
[57:21] violent i'm going to close with this
[57:27] if you would go to revelation 13 8 i'm
[57:29] going to close there's a few scriptures
[57:30] right yeah
[57:39] and all the dwell upon the earth shall
[57:40] worship him whose names are not written
[57:42] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[57:45] from the foundation of the world
[57:48] the church you know you know the
[57:50] scriptures in isaiah
[57:51] jesus was beaten so much he looked like
[57:53] a worm i was he said i'm not he said i'm
[57:55] not a man i'm a worm
[57:59] you couldn't even recognize he was a man
[58:04] all the all the whippings
[58:06] beatings
[58:08] couldn't even recognize he was a man
[58:10] true so before adam and eve did one
[58:12] before the world was even founded god
[58:14] know god chose the most violent
[58:17] gruesome
[58:19] horrible death
[58:20] ever possible
[58:23] in order to save his people
[58:26] god had it planned out the most violent
[58:28] thing that would ever happen would be
[58:29] jesus christ the innocent son of god
[58:32] dying on a cross he had that planned out
[58:35] before the shooter did that
[58:36] yesterday
[58:38] he had it planned out before the flood
[58:39] happened in the days of noah he had it
[58:41] all planned out
[58:45] the most violent act in history planned
[58:47] before the foundation in the world the
[58:49] crucifixion of jesus christ why is the
[58:51] bible so violent because this most
[58:53] violent act was used to show us the love
[58:56] of god that we can get a small glimpse
[58:58] of god's love to us
[59:00] amen
[59:04] the cross just gives us god is infinite
[59:06] how do you believe god's love is
[59:07] infinite amen well that means the cross
[59:08] just gives us a small glimpse into how
[59:11] great god's love really is
[59:13] because our human minds we can't
[59:15] understand all of it right it's
[59:17] impossible to understand how great god's
[59:19] love is for us
[59:21] but the best way he can show us with our
[59:23] human little finite mind
[59:26] is the sacrifice of the innocent son of
[59:29] god
[59:30] we get a small glimpse of god's love
[59:34] hallelujah
[59:36] the greatest event of all history yes
[59:39] and revelation 5 magnifies it
[59:41] everybody's in heaven john's crying he
[59:43] said there's no one worthy to take the
[59:45] book and loose the seals to give us the
[59:46] revelation oh hallelujah
[59:49] no man was worthy amen
[59:52] until a lamb came forth as he was
[59:54] slaughtered the bible says
[59:56] he looked like he was slaughtered amen
[59:58] in other words the mystery of the book
[1:00:00] the understanding of the book could not
[1:00:01] come unless a lamb who was that the most
[1:00:04] violent death came and took that book
[1:00:07] and opened that book that you and i
[1:00:09] could receive the revelation and
[1:00:10] understanding of it and in that book see
[1:00:12] the love of god hallelujah
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:17] no one was worthy
[1:00:18] it shows us the only worthy one is the
[1:00:20] one who took the most violent acts upon
[1:00:23] him
[1:00:24] the most evil the most beating the most
[1:00:27] aggression you could ever put on a
[1:00:28] person jesus christ took it
[1:00:31] thank you lord and then the bible says
[1:00:35] revelation 5 verse 9.
[1:00:45] our song in heaven after all this glory
[1:00:49] after all this russian ukraine fades
[1:00:51] away after all this inflation fades away
[1:00:53] after all this
[1:00:55] lgbtq whatever fades away
[1:00:58] after all the wickedness is done away
[1:01:00] with there's only going to be holiness
[1:01:02] left and what are we going to sing about
[1:01:04] church we're going to sing about the
[1:01:05] most violent act
[1:01:07] that ever was accomplished
[1:01:09] on the cross
[1:01:10] but that violent act is what purchased
[1:01:13] our eternal life amen
[1:01:16] what do we sing about the bible said
[1:01:18] they sent a new song
[1:01:20] yes thou art worthy to take the book and
[1:01:22] open the seals up for thou was
[1:01:24] slaughtered that's what the word means
[1:01:26] and that's redeemed us to god by thy
[1:01:28] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:01:31] and people and nation
[1:01:34] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:01:38] we're going to be singing about the most
[1:01:39] violent act there ever was put on a
[1:01:41] person
[1:01:42] the crucifixion of jesus christ that's
[1:01:44] how the musicians come here
[1:01:54] why is the bible so violent for those
[1:01:56] three reasons at least
[1:02:00] but the crucifixion of christ is the
[1:02:02] very pinnacle of violence
[1:02:04] that we can see
[1:02:07] what needs to be done
[1:02:08] to forgive our sins
[1:02:11] what would it take to make us redeemed
[1:02:13] and bring us back to a spot where we can
[1:02:15] be one with god it would take the most
[1:02:17] violent act ever
[1:02:19] on god's land
[1:02:21] hallelujah
