Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight thank you for the prayers of the saints the song of the saints or we just know you're gonna answer those six requests Lord God we're trusting with all of our hearts we don't know when we may not know how we may not know when but you'll certainly do it again you'll show up on the scene and answer these requests we thank you for Jesus we're so encouraged Lord from the meetings this weekend and also now with brother Brian Hawkins being healed of Crohn's disease you are the mighty God and we humbly serve you here tonight lord help us to get out of Way and speak to us Lord teach us through this thy word Lord this is your word this is Lord the the book your prophet said would be a great blessing Lord to the people so Laura take these thoughts bless them to your people here tonight and father we look forward to hearing from you Lord speak to us as we said we trust you do it we love you Jesus with all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless your being seated praise the Lord now I can switch over when you're ready praise the Lord so I want to just go over these quick quotes real quick going verse by verse brother Branham said there's a great benefit to the churches and it's only a ministry that a pastor can do so I want you to be encouraged you know and I encourages me to read these as well by God's grace remember brother Branham said oh my he said I remember staying a year and six months in the book of Revelation and the tabernacle here that's what I liked in teaching I just love teaching oh my I think it's wonderful it gives the basis so the foundation and it settles the church amen aren't you glad that these doctrines can be settled praise God in fact the person who has come in here said told me in an email that their church has no no foundation they have no doctrine they just preach on thunders and all kinds of things like this and they want to come to our church because they've been streaming and felt led of the Holy Spirit that they feel settled and the word is being taught well Ram said he loved teaching how many love teaching the Word of God oh I love it I love going deep in God's Word don't you now he said here he talks brother Brown just got done reading Ephesians chapter 1 verses 4 & 5 he said this book is not addressed to evangelistic teaching or evangelistic I'm sorry Vangelis sermons he said I don't touch this on the fields I bring this to the church for Paul addressed to the Saints those that are called and preserved in our field and our set aside and are in the holy spirit already in Canaan's land just take a moment stop and think about that when was the last time you heard evangelists go verse by verse and teach you like a whole chapter when was the last time anybody ever heard what sister Beatrice is shaking her head and she served the Lord a wonderful amount of years by God's grace and that's true brother and said there are certain gifts you know they don't that do certain things but we appreciate Evangelos Evangelos coming here they're supposed to set a fire in the church amen but pastors are supposed to teach the Word of God scripture by scripture this is something that evangelist can do is go right here and teach the Word of God like we've been doing by the grace of God so I just want to review those briefly so you remember those now I want to show you how this chapter ends now I want to get your feedback what I did was I put like the main idea of a section of this last part of the chapter and then I put the scriptures behind it and I want your hands raised if you want me to if you want me to go through the scriptures because I want to know how familiar you are with those scriptures you might be very familiar that's wonderful we'll go right to the end then but I kind of would like to know so have your hand ready if you can if not I'll just preach what I feel like to preach okay because I would like your feedback but I don't want to get redundant if you've already know these things and they bless your soul and you've already you invested been blessed by them we'll head to the end where where brother em take sus in this teaching okay so I got the the main ideas in white and then the scriptures in yellow so you'll see it right here so brother Branham in the next portion of the church age book he quotes these three scriptures and shows there's a separation of people at the white throne judgment now we know we know the scripture so in Matthew 25 he separates the the group that's the righteous from the goats and they're as sheep separated from the goats and this is also revelation 20 where the books are open and they separate those to eternal life and those to eternal judgment and then Daniel 7 where the thousands upon thousands ministered minister to Christ and the books are open as anybody would need to go through those by God's grace I thought that was pretty familiar I'd like to go through this okay praise the Lord let's do that let's go to Matthew 25 this is a really good scripture I love this portion mother so much and recently when I've sat down with a few I think it's been two or three people I said I said do you know how merciful God is and I used Matthew 25 God is so merciful he's gonna give people eternal life just for being good to the righteous I'm sorry just being good to the Bride of Christ 25:31 so the white throne judgment is a separation of people now the rapture is kind of like that too except it's separating the bride from the whole rest of the world but at the white throne judgment you're separating the righteous from the goats now remember program said they're not sheep the foolish virgin are not sheep necessarily because the sheep already heard the voice of Christ and were already raptured are you with me but the Bible said they're separated as sheep from the goats and remember this is a parable so let's go to verse 21 I'm sorry 31 25 31 when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations look at that even Russia right China North Korea all nations will be gathered before Christ amen and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now look as a shepherd so brother ram catches the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and said now look it's as a shepherd it's not literally the Sheep though he said because the sheep are the bride members because the Sheep won't follow a stranger you see a foolish virgin might follow a stranger they might follow somebody who's not exactly on the word because they're just living the best they know how right some of them are just given eternal life just because they were nice to a bride member but see the Sheep already heard the shepherd and they got eternal life and they're in the rapture amen now he says this verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left so I'll just stand over here like this sheep are over here and the goats are over there so you are sheep tonight by God's grace you understand what I'm saying there say what I'm saying we want the believers right all the believers to be on the right side now the bride will be with him on the throne amen so you all if we're bride members will sit on the throne with Christ that's right now verse 34 then shall the King saying to them on the right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world now stop right there you see and that scripture Jesus knows the foolish virgin he knew them before the foundation of the world so just when you and when people preach all where the bride we were known before the foundation world that's true but also the foolish virgin was known before the foundation of the world as well right because God God has full omniscience right he's all-knowing so it's no surprise that Christ is giving them salvation because he already knew they'd be saved before the foundation of the world now verse 35 for I was hungered and you gave me me so think about times you were hungry and somebody fed you now this just my thought right here my grandmother grandma Emma Smith she fed my family when we were so poor we got kicked out of what we lost our house because my dad was got laid off and the farm they had a drought the farm fell we went bankrupt and my grandmother fed all of us little children and took all eight of us in because my parents had six kids so I'm I'm hoping this scripture reaches out to my grandmother my grandmother wore shorts painted her face went to the Catholic Church but Church I'm hoping listen I said hoping I'm hoping God will give my grandma Smith eternal life because she fed a family and look now we got we believe bride members in the family we believe we're trusting with all of our hearts we were poor they'd have no money and she fed us now I'm just just trying to let you know I'm trying to apply this to my life here okay now I said I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord or when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink let me stop right there a church do you understand this real quick we must be humble enough to receive gifts from people recently I've talked to so many Russians they somebody but a few people that they tell me well I'm I got so much pride I won't take a gift but I look Church if we that if these people didn't take a gift they wouldn't have received eternal life you see that they had to let a sinner come and give them food they had to let somebody come help but when they're sick are you with me Church we have to be humble enough to receive help but so often we get so prideful we won't we won't let anybody know that we've got struggles I'm not I'm not telling you to go tell everybody all your problems or put all your problems on Facebook I'm not saying that but if somebody knows you ever need sometimes you got to be humble enough to receive that that does that you understand that Paul was the same way in Philippians for I just read through the whole book of Philippians and on Alman colossians paul said i received your gift that you sent me not that I necessarily needed it but so that you would have fruit for your rewards that's what he said in Philippians chapter 4 because he said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I know how to abound and I know how to be abased I know to be content with whatever I have but see Church even as the bride of Jesus Christ we if we're in a bad state we got to accept people's gifts so I thought that would be helpful to you then show the rights okay we've did 3738 when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say to them verily I say to you as in as much as you've done it delete one at least of these my brethren you've done it unto me praise God there's the Living God in the Living Church then shall ye say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer to him saying Lord when saw thee we in hung or thirst or a stranger naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall ye answered them saying verily I say to you in as much as you did it not unto the one at least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting judgment but the righteous into eternal life now I want you to go back to verse 37 now here's a group that's receiving eternal life and they're surprised to receive it can you imagine that that I wonder what kind of life did they live on earth where when they stand before Christ they're surprised what when did we do this Lord when they weren't even aware right because they say Lord when saw thee we hungered or fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink they're surprised and mother and said there'll be surprises and disappointments on the day of judgment look at this church this is quite striking the foolish version is gonna be surprised when did we see you so see the foolish version doesn't even have enough spiritual understanding to recognize God in flesh right because they did something good to God in flesh brother Adam and they didn't even have an idea that was God in flesh look how humble a real Christian is they are so humble that a foolish virgin don't even know that this is God in flesh oh my holiday that encourages me tonight amen that God can be in me Christ can be in me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I can live such a humble life that people don't even know God is inside me they might think oh he's a nice fella like people told me this week the nicest fellow they ever met or something like that but by the grace of God look how the foolish virgin is not even aware that God's in flesh how many want to be aware of God in flesh I do I want to see Christ in you I want you to see Christ in me but these voice version they didn't they're certain they're shocked what do you mean when did we do this when did we do this to you Jesus they didn't know Christ was in his bride they maybe know that now go to Revelation 20 verse 11 let's do that because we had one hand up that one to read over this I appreciate your patience here tonight now see Church we'll get something out of this if we just keep pulling on the Word of God amen there's things in here that we can learn from theirs but this book's eternal I went back and listened to a sermon I preached five years ago and I was hearing things like my I forgot all about that and boy was I a lot louder and I was a lot more what could I say zealous I had a lot more energy now I feel like I hardly have any energy mystery this week I'm gonna preach five times this week I preach on Tuesday morning at the Bible club preach tonight I'll preach tomorrow after school advice on Sunday I just want to give everything I can to Christ if that's what my life is praise the Lord that's usually not that busy but this week is extra busy week all the weeks all the turns off fell on me this week that's okay I can do all things through Christ I can be content with whatever my love is it's 11 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and heaven fled away my and there was found no place for them think of that heaven and earth there's found no place so where we at we're in heaven right hallelujah where the Friends of the Lord then the earthly heavens right the atmospheres verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now get ready remember we're talking about separation remember separate God's separating people from the sheep as sheep from goats now look at this verse 13 and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it imagine those bodies laying down there in the bottom of the sea Christ is gonna call those bodies up amen and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them so see it is there it is that like the rich young ruler remember he died in hell he lifted up his eyes he's gonna get called out of that and they were judged every man according their works and death and he'll were cast in like a fire and this is the second death and whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast in the lake of fire see the separation Christ caused everybody from the seas from the lands wherever they are he calls him even from Hell right from Hades we'd say he calls their souls out of Hades pulls their bodies up out of the sea and then he brings them together reads what's in the book separates one to one to eternal life and the other to the lake of fire that's right the last one Daniel 7 9 and 10 let's go there we just got done preaching on Daniel and I believe it was June if I'm not mistaken preach the whole Book of Daniel praises God Daniel chapter 7 verse 9 all right 7 9 and 10 I beheld to the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire amen picture that that's the remember this is the same picture same idea fiery flames there's just fire everywhere and Christ is sitting there and you're right next to him amen hallelujah verse 10 a fiery stream issued and came out four from a for my thousands thousand thousands ministered unto him in ten thousand times ten thousand stood before the judgment was set and the books were open there are those same books we just read about amen and we know they're judge by their works praise God okay now let's go the next point that's the first point God separates people how about this why do the righteous or foolish virgin why do they must appear at the white throne and why they're given eternal life we already read why they're giving into our life does anyone wanna go through those are we pretty familiar with those when everyone raised their hand we pretty familiar with those maokai okay show you pretty familiar with those okay let's read the John 5 okay I'm gonna do this for the little ones cuz I'm pretty sure they're not familiar with this here we just read that one we'll just read these right here these three because they're really short John 5:24 I think I do I do want them to hear that tonight John 5:24 and then 28 and 29 John 5:1 am i this is one of my favorite scriptures and one of the most convincing scriptures that there are two resurrections this is beautiful John 5:24 alright maokai can read verse 24 for me thank you sir that's you and I church we've already got eternal life how many Goods amen to that you've already passed from death unto life there's nothing to be judged for because Christ took your judgment you're trusting in him he's your lamb amen he's your sacrifice now case you want to try 28 honey anyone try 28 is that okay for you to read are you there hon I'm sorry okay thank you marvel nut Thank You verse 29 and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation there's your two resurrections amen hallelujah this is your second resurrection this is when everybody in the grave everybody in the sea right everybody in the land wherever they are everybody's got to come forth to the judgment now let's also read revelation 20 verse 6 let's go back there a lot of turn your Bibles tonight by God's grace but you know perhaps that persons watching tonight you know who likes the teaching and they don't get much doctrine so I'd be a blessing of them as well now I know about you but even last Wednesday night the very scriptures I read the next morning somebody put it on Facebook the very same scriptures I read and they don't even know I mean we haven't talked for almost 20 years so I just put a little comment on there I just preached that last night see God trying to get us to hear his word amen God's trying to open up our eyes and to help us really see and understand God's Word revelation 20 verse 6 lesson and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection that's the bride on such the second death hath no power the lake of fire but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so that's the first resurrection all the Holy Ghost field Saints live during the thousand years the millennium after that all that in the graves are raised up now the next verse this will be the last one we read before we go to that next point go to Philippians 3:11 you probably haven't read this one ment lately unless you were in the church age book Philippians 3:11 how many are doing everything they can do to go in the rapture how many are doing that tonight that's what Paul's saying right here he's gonna do everything he possibly can do to be in the resurrection hallelujah I'm Church honestly most people are gonna be guilty of not doing enough right they didn't do enough like the foolish virgin she didn't do enough she didn't bring enough oil right and they said go get some you should've went got some before see we got to be guilty of doing a lot we got to make our calling election sure praise God because the foolish version is gonna be guilty of not doing something they should have done now listen they lived all the word that they knew except the Holy Ghost word that's something we got to clarify when we don't think Sunday I'll preach a little bit more on the Fujin and the wise virgin for the RAM said the foolish virgin lives all the word that they know except the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they knew about it right the foolish virgin knew oh I should have had more oil I'm gonna go out and get some oil real quick right because that's what the white wise virgins said so they lived all that they knew under sanctification but they didn't live what they heard about the Holy Ghost is that true so see that's something we got to keep in mind - foolish virgin lives all of the justification all sanctification but they don't get born again they don't have the power that they ought to have amen now Philippians 3:11 here's a mighty man of when we say oh I shouldn't exalt the man but here's a wonderful man of God an obedient man of God and look what he says in verse 11 if by any means I might attain in the resurrection of the dead now program brings us out in the church edging he said why would Paul say if there was only one resurrection and that was the white throne why would Paul say if by any means he said because everybody's already going to be called to that resurrection he's talking about the first resurrection eighty men if by any means I can go on the rapture I'm gonna try to go in the rapture amen you see that if by any means I'm trying to get to the first resurrection I don't want to be in the second resurrection I already want to be resurrected by that time hey I already want to be living a thousand years during that time huh yeah amen glory now how about this one the souls under the altar also receive eternal life or white robes at the white throne judgement anybody need to go over that one that's the Jews right here brother Branham said the Jews and the foolish virgin get their white robes judgment because that's when they're either given eternal life or that's when their caste and like a fire does anybody need to read that by God's grace okay let's just read this one right here let's just read revelation 6:9 brother Branham said the white robes equal eternal life that's what white robes symbolized is eternal life revelation 6 9 through 11 I think that'd be the best one to see because other ones I can quote in just a minute Revelation 6:9 11 brother Adam you wanna read for us a little bit tonight thank you sir can you read 9 and 10 then I'll read 11 hey men look what are they crying out for Church vengeance but God said don't cry out for vengeance he said Ben used his mind saith the Lord and here this scripture right here is when Stephen said father let he said Jesus lay it not to their charge when he's getting stoned in this scripture Luke 23:34 was when Jesus said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing we looked at that last week so see this proves these Jews are not born again and when you say Lord oh I hope these people go to hell that proves you don't have eternal life right you say God have mercy on them they've sinned against me please forgive them that shows you got something inside of you amen you've got eternal life well this preacher did this or this sister did that forgive them because that's what eternal life will do it's exactly right so white robes is immerse 11 revelation 6 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so that's the Jews right they said let Jesus blood be upon us and our children so that number of martyrs has to be fulfilled and then they're given white robes at the white throne judgment that's eternal life okay then brother Branham goes through a review of the three kinds of believers and the fourth class or it's also called the second kind of believer and here's their quick review you have everybody's either saved or lost the saved are believers the lost or make believers and unbelievers and here's the fourth class brother Branham said you have a wise virgin and a foolish virgin you have a make believer and an unbeliever and brother BAM reviews all this and then he says the wise virgins names cannot be removed off the Lamb's Book of Life and he said the righteous their names remain on the book of life he said the make believer has their names removed and then he said the unbeliever their names were never written on the book of life he said but there is some record somewhere of them because they lived but not on the records of life as far as trusting in God for salvation is that helped by God's grace that helped names cannot be removed names remain on the book of life names removed and names were never on the book of life they never claimed to have life but these like Judas they claimed to have life oh yeah I'm I'm an apostle I cast out devils I do all these things but yet he turned and sold Christ away right amen all right November in our day but man lists these those who worship the Pope those who worship the ecumenical move their names were never on the book to begin with that's what the Bible said their names were never on the book even though they went to church Bible said their names were not written on the book of life before the foundation of the world all right now I just want to read a couple of these the next point the program says the sovereignty of God and how he can do what he pleases with his own creation so God can do whatever he wants with the foolish virgin I can do whatever he wants with the make believer or the unbeliever let's read a few of those uh brother Adam will you get that one proverbs 16:4 Malachi you get job 2130 these were some really good scriptures in there I thought might be helpful I'm gonna read Romans 14 7 through 9 his brother Adam said oh you might read this and think that's unfair you know how can God remove names and and all these things and brother branham brings out the scripture that shows that God because of his foreknowledge he knows what they choose and so because of that he can do whatever he wants with them because he made them and he knows whether they're a vessel of honor or vessel of dishonor alright so Romans 14 7 through 9 I'm gonna pull that up here real quick Church if you're a vessel of Honor we ought to rejoice tonight amen God's using me to honor his name hallelujah 14 7 through 9 now for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself so whether you live or die eternal life or separation you belong to Christ for whether we live whether we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's for to this and Christ both died and rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the Dead amen so whichever side you're on saved or lost you're still belong to Christ amen you're his possession okay for the Adam read proverbs 16:4 please sir amen God made the wicked people for the day of evil right and we're gonna get to that next it's the people that are burned in this in the lake of fire God made them for that he knew for knew what they decide so he their vessels of dishonor okay next Malachi job 2130 amen they're reserved into that they're ordained to that that's their destiny that's why people that's why I seen on the Emmys a few years ago they had all these famous people I forget some of their names but they're all singing highway to hell we're on the highway to hell and they're rockin and rollin to a CD with Church many of those people that's exactly where they're going they were made for that but you and I that makes us sad you and I that makes us pity them you and I we cry I'm on the highway to heaven amen and none can walk up there but the pure in heart amen that's why they put devil hats all when they sing that and do all kinds of evil stuff like that because that's where they're going that's what they're made for they're children of Satan but we're children of Christ amen so we sing about heaven so we sing about Jesus and nothing will deter us nothing will pull us away nothing can remove our names from God's book amen because we are God's seed hallelujah so see all those scriptures prove that God sovereign I know what they're gonna choose I can make him to honor I can make him or her to dishonor her to honor he does that it's his choice it says Prag ative all right next the church age is like it on the wheat plant as we are the wheat seed of Abraham that we would be gathered in a Christ garner does anybody need to read those the Bible said if we're believers in Christ were Abraham's seed okay and then John the Baptist said Christ is going to gather his wheat into his garner the wheat seed right the seed the believer hallelujah now brother Branham said the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life which is a part of a book I'm sorry is the book of life or of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life that's quite a deep statement so let me show you a picture I just pulled this off the internet here so you have a wheat plant all right brother Bram said the blade right here the stalk you get a stalk I imagine this is the stock imagine tassel maybe that the husk would be what's around the seed and that I'm sorry the chaff is around the seed the Huskers are or the chaff well Bram said all that is the church so all this is just the people that call themselves believers all the way up but brother Graham said each church group protected and contained the believers who possess the life of Christ in other words the life of that seat right there was down here but it was hidden away praise God that that church group protected it as a church grew on and on the life kept moving amen and brother Branham compares us like the Ephesus and and you know in Samara and all the way up and then now it's layer to SIA we're supposed to be seed time amen but all these ages protected that life the same life that's in that seed does that help by God's grace but Ram said think of the book of life as a wheat plant he said that's what you think of it so part of this is let's say you take the seeds out here what you can do with the rest of it well Graham so you're gonna burn the rest of it right right some of it might be saved you know but we're definitely say the seed okay and then the rest of its gonna be burned with Ramson that's what you do with it and he said that's what is it the book of life there's a part of the book of life that's the Lamb's Book of Life that's the seed part amen let's read quote so I'll have the quotes here for you if I'm not making sense then this has to make sense and brother Branham said if I don't make sense then the Holy Spirit will make sense for you praise God because I don't have the education and do it or I'm not smart enough to do it that's the Holy Spirit reveal it to your heart Jesus Christ died he gave his life that life was to come back up on the church and bring many sons like on himself under glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of the life of Christ amen let me just say like this can I just apply it to my life the Assembly of God denomination brother Adam was a carrier for the life that was in me amen Jose what church were you in before the message any church okay great - the message okay it was anybody in the denomination I know whose sister beau was the Christian Missionary Alliance was a carrier of the life that was in the yang family amen are you with me that that church protected that life until the lie hit that part and then when that life at that part and the light at that part the life of the seed came forth praise God that's what happened to Simon and cam and I hallelujah and sister Betsy we're the life was just carried by that denomination and then the light shone and here come the believers amen and so the Prophet said the church was just the carrier the denomination just carried the life and that's why I'm glad they pray for me that's why I'm glad they they gave food to me I so I'm glad they paid for our bills and clothes us when we didn't have clothes thank God for the carrier amen Graham said as the blade stocked a stone husk were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church corporate through the ages has been the carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say that the book of life is the whole wheat plant all right so I'm going to show that picture again a little bit smaller I had some more words at the bottom so brother have said a Bible example of this is Israel leaving Egypt they all ate drank and we're baptized and saw the cloud this plant enjoyed all the blessings right of the rain enjoyed all the blessings enjoyed all the all the hot Sun it sat in the laying the Friends of the Sun right it drank all my was baptized when I had a big rain right but all but a tiny minority had their names blotted out of the book of life for the Bram said the group protected the life praise God now the Prophet said we have the very same thing today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names though will be bought it out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life that's quite a statement I don't care I fully can't explain that church like I said in church let me just say like this the book of life to me right now is the deepest doctrine that I've ever studied now that's just for right now it used to be the seven thunders but when I saw the quotes on the seven thunders to me it wasn't deep anymore to me it's seven thunders were the seven times brother branham breached with thus saith the Lord the seven seals like to me that's pretty mean it's pretty simple to Revelation to see that I guess God just dropped in my heart but one of the most deepest doctrines of all to me is the book of life because I can't quite fully understand everything but do I believe it you bet you I believe it was all my heart amen I can't explain everything but I do believe it's right this is the record God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and that's first John 5:11 and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world Ephesians 1:4 they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world amen Brandon said that great royal see Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit they are original amen hallelujah honey I've got the original spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost amen you have that hallelujah if you have that then you love the Word of God because after they got it the Bible said they didn't stop fellowshipping with all the Apostles they kept breaking bread having communion they kept here in the Word of God why because they loved the Word of God they're a part of the Word of God they're a part of Christ amen that's what this wheat plant was amen it carried the seed now we can see why the redeemed now it's all about the foods virgin bought back by the original owner I'm sorry she's sorry talking about the bride I'm sorry why the redeemed bride I'm sorry I thought he was gonna say redeemed foolish virgin now we can see why the redeemed bride she was in the meze he was in Adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the record she's part of him she's in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the bride is a member of him and he loses none but that is not so concerning the all in the book of life for amongst them are even those like Judas etc who have a part in the record but their names are removed at one time his name was there but it had to be blotted out because of idolatry remember that he idolized money so God removed his name on the book of life now I'm coming up to something that I don't know if you remember this but in yellow we'll get to that in just a minute we can see those who come in the last days that are after having done wonderful works Jesus will say that they never knew that member that Matthew 7:21 it is not that he was not aware of them his omniscience precludes that but they were not for known as in the bride and neither were they for known as amongst the righteous of the second resurrection now here's where we're good to they bore no fruit so let me stop right there those who did miracles and cast out devils and spoke in tongues and prophesied that was not fruit of the Spirit are you with me that was gifts of the Spirit do you understand that but Graham said they bore no fruit yet they did miracles so see miracles are not fruit fruit is fruit simple statement miracles are not fruit fruit is love long-suffering patience godliness temperance right brotherly kindness all these things we'll get to that in just a minute see miracles are not fruit he said because they were outside the word they didn't abide in the word and they therefore were sentenced to death see they would just take the rain they'd shout and they they do miracles all these things but they wouldn't live in the word they wouldn't lay in the word so the word could actually produce something in their lives they just wanted to produce miracles they want to produce fruit praise God look at that that's striking to me church that's striking they had miracles but miracles are not the same as fruit of the Spirit and listen I'll say like this they're not as important what would you have miracles and go to hell or fruit and go to heaven pretty simple answer to me I rather have the fruit praise God you see this is what we're taught then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aid and comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of and go into life everlasting that's the foolish version finally there are those such as Pharaoh who never had their names in the book of life and their caste and they could fire now I want to make a note here I may want to teach more on the fruit of the Spirit cuz I Lee preached one sermon on it was it two years ago last year I think was last year because this in church the fruit of the Spirit is part of the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost I said part on purpose and that's because the fruit of the Spirit is part of the evidence of being filled only goes because the evidence is being in the word all the way right and the fruit of spirit is just part of the word for our day now get your Bibles handy I got what I got ten more minutes can bear with me 15 more minutes bear with me here I just made this today at work I thought you know maybe I'll I'll help the church with this now well first thing I want you to notice I put three question marks I don't have this fully studied out but at least that know this and at least know the quotes that we've just read so I'm trying to take the quotes I just read and then apply them to all these scriptures hello here the wise version has all the fruits of the spirit now the foolish virgin at least now this is the part understand at least in Jesus parable they don't bring forth any fruit of the Spirit which would make sense because they're not born again right they don't have the original seeds not quit the Seas not quickened if you leave a seat on your shelf and don't put in the ground you're never gonna get fruit because the seeds got to be quickened right so foolish version have seed inside their souls but it's not quickened that's why I can see it because remember Jesus said I for knew you and I prepared this for you from the foundation in the world we just read that tonight are you with me Jesus for knew they're gonna be saved they must have a seat inside of them but it's not quickened by the Holy Ghost because Jesus prepares the kingdom for the foolish virgin all right I'm just I'm just telling red letter words okay all right let's see that's why I don't quite fully understand that what does that mean now here's the part I really don't understand because the make believer is gonna be lost and the Bible said their fruit is withered so that's that's a hard part I don't understand which is also called Krupp true and we'll read these Churchill reading so you can you can see exactly what I'm talking about that's why I don't quite fully understand this how can they have corrupt fruit but these guys have no fruit that I understand that I understand unless you're just looking at this seed right because this would be a this would be a evil seed this would be a seed of Satan because Judas was a son of perdition he was a son of Satan so they just had the wrong seat these must have the right seed but no fruit when all the fruit and these must have the wrong seat and bring forth corrupt fruit it just came to me right now so I hope that's the Lord here tonight and now the unbeliever I don't know do the Hat I don't know I don't think they could have even any fruit so let's read that ok let's go here let's see what you and I need to have how many how many one have all the fruits of the spirit there's nine of them so Church we got nine things we should be searching for tonight I know I am praise God that's like on the church I pray on the mum in the morning in my prayer closet every morning and read my Bible every morning I can by God's grace I want to see the fruits of God because only the bride has the fruit of God only the bride the foolish virgin choked out there's no fruit jesus said so glacials 5:22 all right but the fruit of Spirit is love joy that's what we need today how many oh how we love the joy of the Lord in the presence of God is fullness of joy if people don't have joy it's because they haven't been in God's presence was it Sunday just a time of joy with brother Brooks and and all the saints boy just a time of joy hallelujah see but that's a fruit you have to have that it takes time to be born again and you got to say with it so you gotta stay in the word and then you produce joy in its season love joy now what about love can you love people that's I call you a Holy Roller can you love people that hate you can you love people that say well you're just off preacher I disagree with you preacher and you're you're the most this and this than that can you still love those people yeah God will test you if you say yes then he's gonna test you like he has me and everybody else right love joy peace got peace like a river in the midst of all this trials you still have peace in your soul I'm not fighting a war against God I've got peace with God alright next longsuffering can you wait and have patience with somebody even when they're wrong can you suffer with them a long time are you gentle now there's times Jesus wasn't gentle we don't we know that but gentleness is a fruit of the Spirit Jesus was gentle with many people though right especially on the cross he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's gentle if I ever saw gentle that's gentle Stephen father laid out to their charge right as the stone is coming to hit his head father don't lay it to their charge that's gentleness of the Holy Ghost right there now look goodness now I don't study on that too much but you got to be good ever studied on that one faith hallelujah you have revelation in your heart amen that's a fruit of this spirit I got the revelation meekness the member' meekness is putting yourself last meekness is realizing you're nothing and Christ is Christ has preeminence and everything that's me realizing I'm nothing he's everything temperance is self-control right that's also in the statue perfect man but there's another level when you get born again of controlling your fleshly passions that's what the Greek says cause it passions of the lusts of the flesh against such there's no law now who do you know church no no don't say it out loud who do you know that manifests those fruits of the spirit that's somebody you want to follow amen that's somebody you want to follow on Facebook or Instagram if they're not on Instagram that's somebody you want to watch their life and see how do they live their life because they have all nine and seasons on seasons you see the nine fruits of the spirit of their life that's the kind of person you want to model your life after because it takes the Holy Ghost to do that and remember very few Jesus had few there be that find this road and this road even right few be saved Jesus said okay now mark let's go to mark 4:8 I might do it on time okay I got ten minutes all right bear with me I just want to be humble that's why I put those question marks on there I honestly don't have it all figured out other than like I just said these are of course different seeds this would have to be the true seed of God because God for knew they'd be saved and that just kind of came to me today like I said I haven't put as much time into studying that as I like to but I think that's right that's my thought that just came to me okay mark for seven I'm sorry for eight we can read worried both but let's start with verse eight okay it's the parable the force foregrounds seeds fought on four types of grounds verse a and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increase and brought forth some thirty and sixty and some hundred thirty times the fruit 60 times the fruit a hundred times the fruit oh my what a harvest for Jesus amen I want to see my life bring forth thirty fold I want to see my life bring 460 hundredfold I want to see fruit in my life praise God I want to be able to see mine it's five years after I preached that sermon I want to see I got more long-suffering now I've got more joy now hallelujah I've got more faith now amen fruits of the Holy Spirit look at verse seven now here's what I said the foolish virgin she Hearst is her her see we say their seed their plant is choked and so they get no fruit of the Holy Spirit that's what the Bible says mark 4 7 let's read it together ready one two three and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded what no fruit so they have the right seed but they don't have any fruit they don't really love like Christ loved right they don't really have goodness like Christ had goodness they're not really as temperate as Christ was you see there has to be a difference so what's the difference the fruit was the difference the fruit was the difference between the wise virgin and the food lish the wise had all the fruit 3060 hundred the foolish had no fruit of the Holy Spirit see why it's important to really believe in the fruits of the spirit I know there's a couple quotes people misunderstand but we'll have to go through that again I appreciate last year like I said we went through the whole quotes and I don't I don't really wanna get that tonight now make believer now here's where I said here's a little bit of a sticker brand called a stickler I think he called it which is like I said I can't explain all these but Matthew 7:15 I just want to be humble and keep on learning I want to be honest with you brother Ram said he wouldn't preach on hell until he understood it right he was that humble okay Matthew 7:15 I can I can lay these scriptures I can understand these scriptures by it like I said to explain it especially with these right here these two but like I said it must be corrupt okay Matthew 7:15 now look we're talking about beware of what church false prophets so this group is false prophets just like Judas right they might have had the genuine anointing to prophesy but then their souls were false they were not believers they were unbelievers right they were pretenders beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly of their ravening wolves remember Judas he didn't want Mary to wash Jesus feet because he wanted that money what was he a wolf he was hungry to take their money remember that we've reached out last week I think it was it two weeks ago yeah I was Mary Mary washed Jesus feet and Judas said why don't you sell that money give it to the poor he was a wolf in sheep's clothing trying to eat up that money I really wanted that money he was a wolf in sheep's clothing oh brother just you should have used that money on this and you should have did this and that now be careful Judas one of the money himself verse 16 ye shall know them by their what fruits I gotta say they have fruit but it's the wrong kind of fruit do men gather grapes or thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit that's that really helps right there every tree that brings not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them amen that helped hoping to help now go to Jude 112 I think we're gonna end there listen we'll end with that by God's grace Jude 112 I think I'm at about an hour yeah I got five minutes left here and I'll save that last few paragraphs for Sunday Lord willing we'll see the Holy Spirit can always change my message he's done that before Jude 112 okay now Kai you want to read that for me Jude 112 thank you sir okay there you go that's why I put the question mark because when I read Jude 112 I put it in both places because the one place is set of withered fruit and one place is said no fruit so this is one I'm not quite sure do they have any I'm not even sure so that's when I still don't know but we can definitely see how these are both the right seed once quickened brings forth fruit other ones choked these would be the wrong seed right because they're lost so like I said I may want to teach on each individual fruit of the Spirit since the Prophet said did you know this remember this he said we should judge ourselves based upon the fruit based upon our current fruit that we're producing all right let me see how much i'm marga cuz i think i got four minutes here yeah four minutes okay yeah let's just I got three more quotes we can get through that four minutes I'm pretty sure yeah cuz it's the last part on the wheat plant thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the harvest is the record of the church and even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and as not all the plant is used in the harvest so with the church all the churches not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of it is gathered in the garner and a part of it is kept that it might enter into the eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is accounted chaff is burned and like a fire and this is exactly what John the Baptist and Jesus said for John said the wheat would be gathered in the chat burn let's enter our feet here Jesus said buying the tares then gather the wheat now here it is right here here's today the ecumenical move will bind the tare churches together for the tares must be bound first remember that Jesus said that's the season our program said that's the season when right now is the binding of the tares and though their end is burning they're not burned at their binding but it reserved to later date but one of the tares about the rapture contains and does sometime between the binding and the revelation of the Antichrist did you catch that clue right there but I just gave us a good clue with the rapture you take place because jesus said that we cannot gathered until the tears are bound in the Academical Council so what does that mean Church it means we're going to see the churches bind themselves together before the rapture we don't know everything that's going to happen before the rapture brother houses go to the scripture we are going to see the churches by themselves together in a tight ecumenical council remember graham also said it's the american churches that are going to bring on the squeeze the american churches then will come the day when all stand together as seen in Daniel the King will be there with his bride to him and in front of it will be the multitudes who are to be judged yes all over there all the books are open a final disposition of all is made the harvest is indeed over the books once opened are closed let me pause right here let's feel where the tears of those are me let's go where the tears are bound first let's go to Matthew 13 he said gather together the tears first let's just read taxes you got that okay there it is remember Jesus sends out the angels and he said of them an enemy have done this what planned the tears the servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them see so they had to both had to mature we've got the tares mature but while they returned you and I are mature what do you mean mature with more fruit brother sister more fruit by the grace of God more love for my enemies right more self-control my life I'm not getting more worldly insipid back in the world habits I'm getting more devotees I can't control my passions better now than before I knew yeah it's exactly right glory he said let all throw together until harvest time rapture time if the time of harvest I'll say the Reapers gather ye together first the tares let those tear churches by themselves together in a world economical council member Rick Warren shouldn't call his name but forgive me memory said oh look at our Pope he's claiming the Pope is his spoke about you but he's not Mike ok ahem whoever's Pope he is is going to bind them together in the ecumenical council and they're gonna find themselves together first he said and buy them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn praise God and church those are not my words those aren't even brother branham's words those are Jesus Christ by the tares first get them ready for the burning right which would be Armageddon and also a lake of fire I think Armageddon is the actual the first burden and then he said then you'll gather the we see we've gathered the seeds into my bar there's one hour right there a perfect time how doesn't you thank you though thank you Jesus trying to control myself here now this is that server from 2012 I'm preaching hour and 50 minutes and everybody was patient with me that was a great reminder that everybody loves me good I'll tell ya I was too zealous my wife's like yes he used to preach to sermons in one sermon and I heard both a name that I heard John released the same day the bank god bless them oh they preach an hour tonight can you imagine if I preached 50 more minutes and you didn't get out till 9:42 night and I'm still preaching I can't do it anymore God is humbling me God said helping me to understand my zeal you know I gotta have more wisdom with my zeal but look how much these people love and that was a great reminder but I need to love you too I do but I want to be more mindful I want to grow in grace and not anymore the see Church I want to grow in grace I want to grow and participate how do you want more fruit to the stage that's as we close let's pray for that let me put these scriptures up here sorry you look at that list and you look let's look long and hard for about 30 seconds let's look at this list there's nine fruits of the spirit sorry I don't have any but you understand to get the fruits what you have to do Church crucify your flesh that's the only way we've got to take things out of our lives if you want to be more like Christ man that's why we always say like you can't coach as a Christian you can't coast and say well stop reading my Bible I'll stop listening to brother branham I'll stop the attendant as many church services and I don't want to sound critical but there is no other way to bring forth fruit then crucify people think I'm being you know maybe critical or oh he's going down the same thought again but don't you see how it all works together like this is how you grow as a Christian you hear the word you say hey man you say hallelujah we water that seed and then tomorrow to the right hand of life tomorrow you live exactly what was preached tonight hey another new year that's what you got to do if it becomes a foolish life it becomes a life that's choked out by the cares of the world and then money becomes more important than tarnish right then a relationship becomes more important than praying and pretty soon that seed is choked out and it shows people aren't even born again to begin with oh it's so important to have the fruit of the Holy stream jesus said that foolish merchant hasn't no none of this fruit I'll be encouraged in that just by God's grace that's a good list again in your heart let's just take about a minute here there's little time for some others there was do you have love real gob a love you can love your enemies think about the last person who really offended you do you love

deepest subject right now that I've studied he put twenty pages of the church age book about the book of life far more than any other subject dear God and Lord he brings us down to the end of the chapter and it shows that the Bride of Christ the wise virgin is the only one with real through the spirit Oh God then your prophet said we should judge our lives by the fruit that would presently produce it because that's what Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit Lord you saw in the hands are raised in all sincerity or did I sincerely say peace Lord enjoy for me peace and joy from you I am seeing some of these others I can see some of these Lord in my life right now and I thank you for that no gotta do thank you Jesus I can see some of these fruits manifested I thank you for that Lord I

word for Lord miracles are not fruits as we saw tonight Marika's are the signs that the anointing is there the father fruit is sign that your life is there other that the seeds been quickened and the seeds been watered with praise and worship and also an anointing as well dear God the anointing waters it that Lord not the seed be choked by the things of the world help our church help Bride of Christ fellowship to really be the bride the true bride or the set of our seed being choked may we choke out the voice of Satan hallelujah may we silence his voice we silence the voice of the world
