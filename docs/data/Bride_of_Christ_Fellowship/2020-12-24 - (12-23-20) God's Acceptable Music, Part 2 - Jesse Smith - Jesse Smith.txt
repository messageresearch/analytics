lord willing to this series on music ephesians 5 10. ephesians 5 10. give you a moment to get there i'm still getting there look at god's acceptable music part two tonight we'll be looking at more just general scriptures about music uh being a new song and having a new song and a few of brother graham's quotes about that and how we looked at last week in future weeks lord willing perhaps this weekend we'll be looking at what makes a song acceptable unto god or a song unacceptable unto god lord willing we'll be studying on that more in the next few days and we'll continue this series by god's grace so i just want to encourage brother amen and lydia and malachi we had numerous people come this weekend and say they were so blessed by the music so it's not to make anybody prideful but it's to uh to uh just show a witness that uh visitors come and they can sense the presence of the lord and they can see everyone's dedication and creates a real freedom and they come up and told me with the these shining faces just so happy it was neat to see that so thank you for uh our musicians for playing skillfully sometimes loud sometimes quiet right and worshiping the lord because it creates such a beautiful atmosphere so ephesians 5 10 we looked at this last week about were the children of light in verse 8 not darkness and it's our duty to prove what is pleasing to god so let's read ephesians 5 10 together on 3 1 2 3 proving what is acceptable unto the lord now if you would go down here let's go down to verse 19 we know verse 18 talks about being filled with the spirit singing is one way to keep the anointing of the holy spirit in our minds so let's read verse 19 as well one two three speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord amen may god has blessings to read his word you may be seated so just for convenience sake here uh i'll be preaching off the ipad every now and then i'll reach back here well maybe i'll reach over here and get my bible i will read some longer portions of scripture but you know i have a bible on here too and since i don't have a pulpit in front of me i just have to hold this here so god bless everybody let me set a quick timer here so don't go too long we'll set it for 45 minutes and see how that goes tonight we want to keep going with the 6 30 start time heading into 2021 just helps our family get to bed a little bit earlier uh especially during the work week and the school week it is really nice so we're gonna try to stay at that 6 30 start time and you know sometimes if we don't get started till 6 35 or 6 40 hope that's okay uh with our live streamers uh if we're running behind or something like that but uh by god's grace we would like to keep going at 6 30 just to give us a little more rest on wednesday nights so god bless everybody coming off a wonderful weekend there with brother cam ministering through the holy spirit and uh seeing his family what a great time we had the lord here i think i'll start here with just again reading the references that i've been using as i'm studying the first one is ben narad sermon it's on our youtube channel from april 2016 called the approach to war music i've been listening to that listen part of it today uh just a tremendous message from the holy spirit also i've been listening to the seven part series by dr frank garlock on youtube and all these i recommend i think they're really great teachings now the next one is a 10 part series by a brother in the seventh day adventist church named christian b i forgot his last name now this one you got to be kind a little bit careful he plays lots of samples of worldly music so if you're struggling with worldly music i wouldn't recommend listening to that one maybe because he'll play like you know longer portions of their songs maybe 30 seconds or something and then certain images he'll show as well now he tries to block out you know um immoral parts i appreciate that um but just so you know if you are struggling with music and worldly music i would just stay away from now it's a 10 part series that's over 12 hours long so i was listening to it on the second speed or twice the speed to get through a little faster and then the fourth reference uh listened to a little bit this week was the article from rebecca branham smith from 1992 called music the sound and unsound so again those are my four references i'm using right now of course along with the bible and brother rams message but those are the four additional ones you might want to enjoy as well so just real briefly we saw four important duties now we know there's more i'll probably add more but we looked at the four duties we have to prove what pleases god with rhythm and lyrics second we have to create the right atmosphere so singing with sincerity and third identify the meanings of sounds now this one might even go with the first one actually that when i think about it a little more um proving what pleases god is probably doing that same thing identifying uh the sounds of golly music versus the sounds of worldly music so those could too could be interchangeable and then fourth uh it's our duty to introduce new songs okay so tonight i want to look i just want to begin by looking at the scriptures about new songs okay so children get your bibles ready got numerous scriptures and hopefully they'll read loud enough or hopefully they're all close enough to the computer so everybody can hear their voices by god's grace so as i told you last week there's nine verses that say new songs uh new songs and so there's a nice sample there of the holy spirit saying sing to me a new song sing a new song well the only way you can sing a new song is if he gives you a song and so god is in other words god is saying sing a new song let me inspire you for a new song and it'll do that many times for giving you a victory or giving you a testimony so start with uh lydia lydia let's do psalms 33 malachi if you get psalms 40. acacia psalm 96. haven if you like greenhouse even how do you feel okay psalm 98. okay so lydia will start off off with psalms 33 verses 1 2 and 3. rejoice in the lord o ye righteous who praises comely for the upright praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the salt tree and an instrument of ten strings sing unto him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise amen thank you now let's look at a few thoughts in here verse one notice praise is calmly or beautiful for the upright praise is boring to the sinner right and perhaps the foolish virgin but to the holy ghost-filled saint who's upright in the truth and keeping all sin out of their lives confessing other sins praise is a beautiful thing because they realize all their power comes from god right we don't have any power strength of our own all of us unless we're attached to the vine we have no life right nothing good about any of us jesus said apart from me you're nothing that's my life scripture john 15 5. i'm nothing if anything good comes out of my life it's because i was attached to jesus and all glory to jesus for that so it's a beautiful thing for those who are walking true to god to sing praises so that gives us a clue if we're in our church service and we're not really enjoying the worship we need to look at our lives and see am i living up right before god or have i allowed some sin to creep into my life if we're if we're serving god with joy and happiness song service ought to be a great highlight to our day praise god verse two we use we see some instruments now a harp sultry instrument of strings praise god that's so we love by the amens guitar malachi can play guitar as well and of course the strings and the piano and there's piano strings on the inside they got a titan tune and everything i'm not much of a musician so we thank the lord for that stringed instruments now verse 3 sing unto him a new song now the definition in hebrew is new but it's also fresh sing to him a fresh song play skillfully with a loud noise now the word noise means a shout for joy okay so in other words we have to have a fresh shout a fresh reason right a fresh way to be joyful in our lord like that first song all my songs i'll sing for you jesus there's a song in my soul right that's a was a new song to us recently in that last few years and it's still a new song it's a fresh song for all of your goodness i'll love you forever jesus so see these are uh these are desires of god that we want to walk in and we want to manifest we want to sing him a fresh song from our heart we want to shout it with joy praise god so see fresh songs make you joyful so see there's a reason people when they come to church they're not joyful right they they don't sing a new song or they haven't got a victory in the lord right they haven't trusted god or they got sin in their lives so there's no joy in their song there's no joy in their life but as believers if we're walking upright confessing our sin and then obeying the word of god we get the blessings and benefits of obedience which makes us joyful we see victory we see satan under our feet praise god and we walk victorious and we possess the land as brother cam was talking on sunday right we possess our inheritance footsteps our possession praise god in other words we're winning the battles we're overcoming satan we're overcoming every temptation and we sing a new song because we got a fresh victory we got a fresh testimony for jesus christ [Music] psalms 40 verse 1 2 3 and 4. so malachi please four verses i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see and fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord's trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies amen so david writes this after he was in a pit after he was in an awful situation dirty mirey clay right just an awful spot to be in but the lord delivered him he had to now look look church had to patiently wait in that dirt right patiently uh wait in the muck he had to patiently wait until god uh had it in his right time in season to deliver david out of there he brought him out of a dirty place a bad place how many can say god's brought me out of a bad place right awful place a rotten place right but when he did that he set your feet on something that's solid right your life feels like it's back as it should be praise god your life doesn't feel like you're sinking or unstable your life feels stable you have firm foundation uh firm steps you know you're not gonna fall praise god amen because you're standing on a rock you're not gonna slip you're not gonna get dirty not gonna get filthy you know where you're standing and you're a victor you're more than a conqueror in christ jesus and he establishes all your ways because you're walking on the rock of the word not stranded right sometimes we feel stranded or we feel lost and hopeless we're in a ho we're in a pit right we're hopeless and it doesn't seem like we could ever get out but god will bring us out just wait patiently call upon the lord and then when he does the bible said i'll give you a new song amen [Music] and what is the song it's a song of praise i love this part did you catch this many shall see your new song after you get a victory so see god wants us to go through trials come out of those trials and then have a new song people will see our testimony my jesse was delivered or lydia malachi was delivered and look at him sing look at them testify right that's why i want to put our songs on facebook or youtube right people need to see what god has done and then the bible says many will see it here and shall trust in the lord it doesn't say uh maybe make converts right but it will encourage the saints praise god the believers will see your testimony they'll see your life your song and that will inspire them oh if god brought them out and bringing them and look at the joy of their lives god's going to bring me out the joy will come soon the joy may come in the morning or tomorrow morning or the morning after but i'll i'll have joy i'll be able to sing again and god will give me a testimony god will bring me out of this dark season and it'll bring me to the mountaintop [Music] hallelujah thank the lord see it's god who puts the new praise song in your mouth see but you got to let god or you got to open your mouth to sing it right god will bring you the song he'll introduce a new song or somebody else in most cases he'll allow you to hear a new song but you got to open your mouth we have to open our mouths and sing it and really feel it and understand this is what god has done for me so see god's songs are meant to inspire others to trust and have faith in god so that's that's where a song special can be such a blessing if somebody's been through a difficult time and then they sing a special it can just impact so many people one time i was at that women's retreat there in new york and one of the sisters was up there playing and before she played and sang the special she said this song came out of an awful dark time and that awful dark time was an abusive relationship but when she played that song every eye in the place was weeping and crying and praising the lord of such a beautiful song i need to contact the pastor and get that song i just wish i would have remembered to get that it was such a beautiful uh atmosphere of praise and worship and it reminds me of this scripture right here in a horrible pit abusive relationship but the lord brought her out gave her a new song and it caused many others to trust in the lord because if god can bring this person out and give him a new song and give him hope god can bring me out god can bring you out and god is going to do it and when he does sing the new song sing the new praise let everybody hear your testimony not not in pride but in humility to declare with the joy of god in your heart declare the works of the lord that others might be inspired not to give up on god but to trust in god and then sing the new song and give him praise hallelujah i think that's beautiful oh hallelujah help me the holy spirit to remember to get that song by god's grace all right psalm 96 all right keisha can you read verses one to four oh sing unto the lord and new songs sing unto the lord all the earth sing unto the lord bless his name show forth himself his salvation from day to day declare his glory among the heathen all his wonders among all people for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods amen thank you just want to notice a few things here we're to sing a new song to the lord all the earth so everybody see everyone every church is required to sing a new song not just ours every church should have a new song that keeps the worship fresh right keeps it full of joy it sure does and then do it every day look day to day right we got to keep praising god to keep pressing play on the worship right and keep praising the lord each and every day can't stop we got to keep praising the lord let that atmosphere and the glory of god just fill our home we need to keep doing that and then if we get a chance we declare among all the people so no matter who's around us whatever who comes to church we should praise god as usual and then god is great and because he's so great he's supposed to be greatly praised that means exceeding so exceeding praised abundantly praised forcefully praised that's another expression so use our force right use our uh our our eagerness right to praise the lord it should be something that we should be eager to do and uh pour ourselves into it all of our hearts it shouldn't be a weak praise right or a faithless praise it should be a praise of faith that you've got confidence in god because you know god is great so i'm going to praise him greatly all right psalms 98. now this is the song we sang uh sunday it's called psalm 98 sing unto the lord a new song for what he's done so that's the song that we sing where'd we get that song well we got it from i think shane and shane is the uh the artist who wrote that if i'm not mistaken uh now we gotta be careful with some of their songs of course they seem like really nice brothers in christ but of course they don't follow the message we got to be careful with some of the songs they do but it's a beautiful song if they wrote that that was truly inspired because it comes straight out of scripture so heaven why don't you just read the first two verses let's sing unto the lord a new son for he has done marvelous things his right hand in his holy arm has gone gotten him the victory the lord hath made new in his salvation his righteousness have he opens shoeid in the sight of the of the heathen yeah great great job haven thank you so see give god a new song because he's done great things so this year you know god's done great things it's been a hard year for some right in some ways it has but god's done a great thing by preserving your life you're still alive right coronavirus didn't take you didn't take me thank the lord although i had it but god was merciful there's so many great things he's done protecting us providing for us healing our loved ones and families and the churches as we've been preaching on what a tremendous blessing praise him and sing him a new song because of all the amazing things that he's done look at even talks about his victory his victories like his right arm his strength praise god his right arm hath got him the victory so sing to him a new song because he's so strong he's reached out his hand for you this year praise god also verse three he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of god make a joyful noise into the lord all the earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise oh i was getting happy just ah just thinking about singing some more praise god oh because of all god's done all his mercy his grace verse five singing the lord with the harp with the with the harp and the voice of a psalm with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord the king let the sea roar and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein i think the first verse goes uh that the seas roar and all that fills it yeah let the rivers clap their hands and the oceans and the mountains sing i think we get in the next verse verse uh hey yeah let the floods clap their hands a flood clapping its hands amazing all the way smacking and clapping together right let the hills be joyful together joyful hills before the lord for he cometh to judge the earth which with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity so just clap and sing and praise he's coming praise god he's coming with truth justice mighty acts and judgment as well praise god amen notice all the earth right so all the earth needs to sing a new song praise god so this doesn't uh exclude anybody every church should be singing new songs this is the song we sing as well thanks to those who got inspired to write it psalm 98 now how many are guilty of breaking this command the bible said all the earth everybody greatly prays with joy right if we don't come to church and sing with joy we're breaking this command so we got to have joy all right we got to get out of the flesh and get into the holy spirit praise god like brother branson said the church age book don't sit there like a wall flower during the song service right you my children me we need to stand up and praise the lord and give him worship and praise get into the spirit right get into the holy spirit don't stay out of the holy spirit get into the holy spirit you do that by tapping your foot clapping your hands praising the lord smiling that's you got to get into the spirit you've got in other words you've got to agree with the holy spirit right we don't sing sad songs right we sing are we singing songs of repentance that can be sad right if we need to repent but if we repented and all that then we need to sing a joyful noise unto the lord all right psalms 144. looks like we'll sing the lydia can you go to verse 9 psalm 144 9. yeah i want to read the from nine down to the rest uh but lydia i'm just going to read nine and ten i will sing a new song unto thee oh god upon a sultry in an instrument of ten strings blessing praise unto thee it is he that gave us salvation unto kings who delivereth david his servant from the hurtful sword amen so i'm gonna use instruments i'm gonna praise you with a new song praise the lord because he gave salvation he delivers us he delivers us from hurt see that the hurtful swords god keeps you from being hurt amen we heard about that with brother ray right god's protecting us he's keeping us from being hurt so it's okay to be a small church right because god's protecting us he's keeping us from pain so we should thank the lord for that praise god amen verse 11 rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood see we don't want to fill our mouths with vain things and ridiculous statements we want to sing and fill our mouths with the praises of god to glorify him for all he's done for us hallelujah here's verse 12. this is really going to encourage my sons and daughters hopefully that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth so keep me from lying keep me from vain words that my sons may grow up like plants how do plants grow really fast right and really strong right so if we keep ourselves from evil words we can keep ourselves from evil associations and from lies and we live the truth our sons are going to grow up strong and quick right they're going to be really really good with the things of god they're going to really understand the word of god and be strong and really show growth right how many want to grow really fast right you don't want to be you don't want stunted growth do you we don't want to be stunted in our growth right we don't want to wither away like the bible says we want to have fruit that always is bringing forth more and more fruit we want to be planted by rivers of water we want to benefit from being planted in christ we don't want a weak testimony we want a testimony of faith now this ought to encourage my daughters right here verse 12. let's finish the last part that our daughters may be as cornerstones polished after the solitude of a palace so we keep ourselves from lies don't believe the world's lies oh you're not pretty enough oh you're not tall enough oh you're not oh you're never gonna or dressing like that oh you're never gonna get a husband that's all lies that's all vanity that's a bunch of trash praise god right you live holy you live godly and the bible says our daughters will be like cornerstones what's a cornerstone it's the foundation right it's it's what everything is built upon everything is based upon that cornerstone so daughters i hope you can understand this your life is so important your life is the stability of your husband and your children right if you're strong and if you're godly it's like the cornerstone it's like brother man says you're the backbone right your your testimony your holy life gives foundation strength for everyone else who was that told me recently like i couldn't do nothing without my wife i think cam said that over the pulpit right well i say the same thing what can i do without the cornerstone of my wife right because of her she's faithful at the home right she her life because she's strong keeps the baby and feeds everybody you know feeds me because of her stability everybody's life is held up like what a palace not a dump right not a tent holy daughters are like polished and like polished beautiful stones right oh just so smooth and so pretty right our dog our daughters are so pretty when they're holy it's like you're the foundational stone of a big beautiful palace but without the foundation what happens to the palace stumbles right can be easily broken but with the cornerstone it has strength it has stability so sisters and daughters i hope you're encouraged by god's grace that god says when you sing a new song when you get rid of all the liars when you obey the truth and believe the truth you're like a polished cornerstone hey man you're stable the backbone and i'll say like this sisters girls and daughters you're so much like christ because christ called himself the chief cornerstone hallelujah he's the chief cornerstone but you are a cornerstone a minor cornerstone praise god hallelujah so be encouraged especially lydia and the ones that are getting older towards womanhood you know just each year you're polished more and more by the holy spirit and god's going to place you as a cornerstone and everything that will be built upon your faithfulness to christ right your ability uh your ability to flee from strange children right to flee from speaking lies so when you speak the truth god polishes you up and one day he's going to build lord willing if he carries he's going to build some beautiful palace upon your life praise god right look at uh look at the look at the the palace of your lives that built upon mommy's life praise the lord don't you want that same thing see so i got suns that are strong like plants we've got good plants growing outside uh good good plants we harvest right in the fall plant in the spring and harvest summer and fall good plants and some good blueberries this this year right that's like our sons strong growing up really fast strong but our daughters are like chief cornerstones they're stable they're the peace everything else is built upon everything trust and rest on that cornerstone so your family girls and your husbands will all rest upon your life your testimony your ability to stay pure to the word of god all right and then look at verse 13 so because of that sister's faithfulness and the brothers strength our garners are full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets what's this all about the new psalm right victory because you've cast down lies because you because you separate yourself from friends that aren't christians god gives you a new song he polishes your life and he builds a life every area of your life is fruitful and you've got a new song in your lips verse 14 that our oxen may be strong to labor that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining oh hallelujah in our streets amen keep that song in our heart keep ourselves from evil uh god will bless our work god will bless everything we'll do and we won't complain we'll be happy and joyful because look at verse uh last verse verse 15 happy is that people that is in such a case yeah happy is that people whose god is the lord amen very easy isn't it children very easy just that's a gas be our prayer rid me and deliver me from strange children that don't want to serve god who speak vanity talk about they talk about things that don't even matter right no who cares about what is that going to him is that going to be in heaven then we shouldn't talk about it right we shouldn't and then on their right hand their strength is falsehood they want to do evil things they want to do evil things to people stay away from them god will make you a strong plant god will make you a cornerstone you'll be happy the bible says if you're in such a case as that praise god lord if lord terry's that's going to be in my book the next book by god's grace about family i wrote that down and saved it all right psalms 149 please knockout maybe we can read some of this this is a shorter chapter as well yep knock i do one through four please psalms 149 1-4 praise the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints but israel rejoiced in him that made him let the children of zion be joyful in their king let them praise his name in the dance let them seek praises unto him with the timbrel and heart for the lord take his pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation amen praise god god loves worship the king loves to be worshipped he loves for his people to rejoice right he wants them joyful in the lord happy to serve the lord and then the bible says get out the uh the tambourine and the harp and play it all together and dance and praise the lord and sing oh praise his name would dance right girls hallelujah you can do it in a you can do it spontaneously or you can do a planned out dance you know i was watching a video a couple years ago of israel some of their dances that they do at feast time and it's all choreographed right ladies and gentlemen so it's choreography dancing is okay but so is spontaneous dancing amen as long as it glorifies god doesn't glorify the flesh but exalts the lord jesus and shows your joyfulness your rejoicing in what god has done for you amen he takes pleasure in his people so see god loves to see us dance and sing and praise the lord and get out the tambourine that's the same word tambourine that satan had pipes or tambourines so see it's satan just he's just impersonating right god loves the tambourine god loves that beat god loves to dance and and shout hallelujah he has pleasure he inhabits the praises of his people amen all right verse five lady help me out here hon i know you can do it here oh i'm sorry that's okay uh verse five let the saints be joyful and glory let them sing aloud upon their beds do you think more people would be happy if they'd sing on their beds rather than scrolling on their phones on their beds what do you think they'd be a lot more happier if they sung on their beds right or how about complaining on their beds or watch a movie drinking a beer on their bed a lot of people do that right or do evil things on their bed but the bible said sing as you're going to bed sing in verse 5 joyfully sing to god in your beds i know it's hard for us right especially with some of our little ones and they don't want to go to bed and they might not be in the best attitude but we can get better that can't we sing and be happy in our beds may god help us right verse six let the high praises now that word means uplifting let the uplifting songs of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand so we're to sing uplifting songs and have the word of god ready right there in our hand right because that's what the word is right the word is like a sword right so when you when you sing a uplifting song something that encourages you something that makes you happy right something that makes you hopeful for the future that's like having the sword of god and chopping at the enemy praise god driving him back in the name of jesus christ verse 7 to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron wow that's what the word of god does right the bible said whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven there it is right there casting out devils right by singing well you know that with king saul singing casts out devils right it binds them up just like the bible said binds kings principalities powers with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron oh we're so blessed we're so blessed to be a free people that's what the people were telling me this weekend your church is so free they said we love the freedom in your songs why are we free because the word of god has broken the chains off us right we could be in chains defeated discouraged not not joyful depressed and sad but when the when we when we get the holy spirit it breaks those chains it drives them away and people can see that we don't have feathers on we're free because the sun has made us free indeed amen glory verse 9 to execute upon them the judgment written this honor i love this have all the saints all the saints have this honor to drive away enemies to not be enslaved to sin but to be free from sin and to be joyful and to give god much praise praise ye the lord hallelujah oh we just need to praise him more and more breaks every chain breaks every destroys every principality and power when we sing praise to god and sing him a new song i just know i'm down about 10 minutes already wow and that'll be 45 minutes all right let's read the whole chapter this this of course doesn't uh this doesn't say the word new song but let's just read psalm 150 just as a reminder here maybe we'll ask uh who read it last would you read it now everlasting in case you can go to psalm 115. let in case you read the first four and then haven't you read the last two psalms 150 go ahead acacia one through four hundred praise the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the sultry and harp praise him with a tambourine and dance praise him with his stringed instruments and organs all right having to do five and six praise him upon loud symbols praise him upon high standing symbols that everything that i have breath praise the lord praising the lord amen thank you so this just gives so much freedom right so much encouragement just to praise god right praise him in the church it starts off with that praise him in the firmament of his power for his mighty acts all of his greatness his excellent greatness use the trumpet the sultry the harp timbrel dancing praise him with string instruments organs symbols high sounding symbols any everyone that's alive needs to praise the lord if you're alive tonight praise the lord hallelujah let everything that has breath praise the lord maybe we'll sing that one at the end we'll sing the character song and then we'll sing praise god in the sanctuary remember that one uh we haven't seen that in a while we need to get out there and do some dancing and praise the lord praise him for his acts of power let's sing that tonight by god's grace that's a beautiful song oh just to feel free and feel happy right and just rejoice in what the lord has done for us praise god he's done great things for us hallelujah now isaiah 42 10 it just kind of repeats worldwide praise with new songs that's why i enjoy getting like we sing a hillsong song tonight and a phil wickham song these are new songs and some of these songs go around the world and again they may have elements of rock and roll in them but we take them out and we uh we sing the part that glorifies god the lyrical inspiration from the holy spirit that we see in the scripture and we can sing that to god with the right rhythm the right lyrics the right expression and it glorifies the lord because god is the inspiration behind the lyrics and most of the music but then sometimes those artists inject as we saw last wednesday they inject some worldliness into it and we just we just take that out right we spit out the seeds and we just take the cherry pie praise god psalm 42 10. sing unto the lord a new song in his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof so all those in the boats right all those in the islands as far as men are scattered praise god sing him a new song wherever you go over all the earth because god is the god of the whole earth praise god all right now that's the first seven bible hits on new songs let's go to revelation 5 and this will be the eighth and then revelation 14 will be the ninth so lydia revelation 5 malachi revelation 14. revelation 5 9 and 10 lydia can you read 9 10 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that which slain has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth praise god so heaven heard a new song in revelation 5 when a new act was done right so previous to this new song the lamb had not come to take the book right still and had the seven seals on it we know that we know the the background of this right because in chapter six the first seal is taken off right so a new song comes when a new act is done so just like in our lives when we see something new happen it's like when god sends a godly husband for lydia one of these days that's a new thing right or a godly wife for malachi that's gonna be a new thing that's a news it should be a new song then so we'll be able to sing a new song where god has provided a great thing for us or if somebody gets sick god forbid but if somebody gets sick and god does something new he's never done before like with bangs you know father we should be able to sing a new song it should have new meaning to it amen hallelujah now if there's a new song when the seals were open what about the new song when the bride gets raptured that's never been done before right so there's gonna have to be a new song praise god because it's never happened before just like here this has never happened before so when it happened they sang a new song he's worthy right is he worthy is he worthy he is hallelujah of all blessing and honor and glory and power hallelujah thank the lord jesus so the wedding supper when she we have communion with jesus this is where your imagination should go to work right here right anything that's new new song millennium new song it's never happened before we've never had a thousand years of peace a thousand years with no mind battles we never had it what songs are we gonna sing in the millennium a thousand years of no war no more tanks and no more planes and bombs a thousand years what kind of songs are we going to sing hallelujah how about that song when the new jerusalem comes down how about that oh this is home right this is a new home song our eternal home future home wow they're going to be song about the future home praise god [Laughter] oh my revelation 14. now i read verses one to three one two three and i looked and lo the lamb stood on the mount zion and with and 4 000 having his father's name written in their foreheads and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of great thunder and i heard the voice of harper's harping with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song about 140 and 4 000 which were redeemed from the earth amen so see there are only there's some songs that only the redeemed can sing right we always talk about that with angels can't sing some of these songs right praise god and so here why is this a new song well if you guys have uh remember if you remember from when we preached on the covenants this is a new song because israel is no longer blinded right so now israel is just like joseph and his brother right oh we know this is joseph joseph is alive right he's not he's not he's upset with us israel is going to sing a new song because he realized oh our messiah already came and he's not upset with us in fact he received our repentance and he gave us the seal of the holy spirit in our souls praise god and we're redeemed by the lamb in other words we're not under the old covenant we have the new covenant praise god we have better promises we have better blessings we're singing a new song because we have a new covenant praise the lord amen that's why when we first can say boy we can really sing new songs to the lord because we are married to our old uh under our marriage covenant right uh romans 7 says that he says you were married to sin and and death but now he said you ought to be married to another even christ jesus hallelujah amen amen thank the lord jesus all right so my 45 minutes is about up here let's close with this i just want to take a few moments and close with this thought i mentioned it last week and it kind of came to me while i was ministering i thought what is it about singing singing is contacting the spirit realm right what is singing singing is reaching out to the heavenly realms because it's a spiritual act it's reaching out trying to contact the spirit realm now we know the world does a good job of that contacting the demonic realm right make some lie steal lust murder all kinds of things because they're reaching out to the demonic realm they're asking for demonic help that's basically what they're doing when they're singing but when we're singing we're praising god asking god for his holy help amen his divine help so singing is your way that's why when we sing we got to sing sincerely right we've got to sing it from our hearts or else it's not going to do us any good but if we sing sincerely it reaches out to that other realm in heaven said lord i need you jesus speak through me live through me help me jesus so singing is contacting your heavenly home we already looked at ephesians 5 right don't i'm sorry don't get drunk on wine but be filled with the spirit speaking yourselves in psalms hymns spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord so see we gotta sing to god try to contact god and see what god would give to us what he would like us to receive but ram says this he said it's cold outside but we won't be cold inside we pray the holy spirit will just warm our hearts in such a way we'll know that his presence is so tangible look at that tangible tangible means you can feel it right i believe he's just as tangible tonight as the light is on my hands everybody look at the light on your hands just like there's light on your hands so god is here right now do you believe that he said he's just as real as the light or just as real as anything that you can touch with the five senses the five senses wasn't given to man to contact god with right five senses was given to man to contact what his earthly home we contact god by faith the sixth sense so see singing helps us contact the heavenly realm praise god this body all your five senses contacts your heavenly home but singing and open up and open up your thinking that helps you to contact the heavenly home program says we contact god by faith well where is faith faith is both in your mind and your soul right because faith is just a form of the holy spirit right it's an attribute of the holy spirit remember judas had faith but then he forfeited it he lost faith but peter had faith but he didn't lose it because jesus prayed for him praise god amen he said i'm going to pray that your faith fail not amen and of course peter had to make that you know free work free moral agency decision but jesus prayer kept him and held him in his time of great temptation and i know jesus will keep us in our time of great temptation as well praise god so your five senses contact this home but singing and worshiping in faith right that contacts your heavenly home that's why singing is so powerful especially with groups like the children choir or our or our songs here tonight it's it's all of us it's all saying god we want to contact you we want to touch you we want you to touch us praise god we want to hear from heaven hallelujah second kings 3 11. and we could read all this but most you know the story jehoshaphat and ahab's son come to elisha the prophet and they say is jehoshaphat says is not there here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him and elijah remember what elisha says he said i won't even listen to the ahab's son except jehoshaphat was here sounds like he's a little bit angry huh sounds like he's a little bit uh upset with ahab's son which he ought to be verse 13. verse 15. bring me now a minstrel and that's someone who can play the instrument right the hebrew actually says it's a strained instrument right but one time i preached i think somebody corrected me on that one but somebody a menstrual someone who came to play for elisha so they said how do we how do we find out god's thoughts how do we how do we contact god he said bring me somebody that can play the worship see maokai lydia how powerful you two can be people want to come to church they want to hear from god guess who's got a good guess who plays a part and helps them connect to god you guys location with your singing haven with your singing haven i see hey many times i'll see haven't stand up and raise their hands that's helping people contact god so in case you're doing it on sunday see you guys do your razors when you start reaching out to god that helps other people reach out to god and hear from god so elisha we want to hear from god he said somebody bring me a sister that can sing real good bring me a brother that can play this piano here they want to hear from god this is how we contact god it's not by going up and eating an apple oh that's okay right it's not my oh let's just go drill some more holes in the wall you know i said how you're going to contact god you got to cry out to god you got to sing to god you got to praise god you got to reach out to god with your sixth sense with your mind with your your heart your emotions and the bible said it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches remember they filled them up with water and then the enemy when they woke up the next morning they looked out they saw the water the light reflecting it made the water look like blood everybody fled and israel got the victory but how did they figure out what to do go get me somebody that can play the real songs of god that really knows how to worship we'll hear from heaven and children i believe that can happen every service god will direct us he'll speak something to us that's why your songs are so important right that's why your prayers are so more that's why how you worship is important if we're sitting like this and song service and it's boring shame on us we're actually hindering the service right go get me a minstrel go get me someone who knows how to worship someone who knows how to praise god with rejoicing and gladness and joyfulness of heart god is greatly to be praised we want to touch god we want to hear from god we got to praise the great god great god in a great manner forgive me we want to hear from the great god let's sing how great he is hallelujah see so music is an invitation channel to invite the powers of heaven to come down it's calling out for spiritual power to from god the world does it for satan's power but we call out to god it's inviting god to come and fill us with his power connecting to the spiritual world of god's holiness let's stop right there by god's grace so malcolm all right now we want to sing king of my heart uh or i'm sorry how many kings what other song are we gonna sing praise god in the sanctuary let's sing uh let me see if i can find the lyrics real quick just uh yeah

it'll create a beautiful atmosphere we need to hear from god we'll put on some godly music and go praying and worshiping and god will give us the thought so give us the wisdom this brother can preach if we ask for the wisdom especially praising and worshiping he's going to pour out his wisdom to us abundantly liberally the bible says what a blessing what a privilege as power heads for word of prayer here heavenly father thank you for this opportunity to worship you to be gathered together virtually lord god we feel your presence we feel your joy your greatness lord god you're greatly to be
