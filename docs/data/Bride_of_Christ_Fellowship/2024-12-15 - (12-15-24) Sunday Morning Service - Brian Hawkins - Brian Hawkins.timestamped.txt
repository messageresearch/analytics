[0:00] and everybody else I think I
[0:02] know so uh before I get too far uh I
[0:07] want to greet everybody uh from Brother
[0:10] Jim uh he sends his greetings says hello
[0:13] and I'm just going to say everybody at
[0:16] the church said said hello because they
[0:18] they heard we were coming out here and
[0:20] they said hey tell them we said hi tell
[0:22] them we said hi so in a nutshell
[0:24] everybody says hi amen and uh just
[0:27] wonderful to have a uh body of Believers
[0:31] that we could just Fellowship together
[0:33] and be in agreeance amen and just uh
[0:36] following after the same thing after the
[0:38] right thing and uh pressing the course
[0:41] you know fighting the good fight of
[0:42] Faith
[0:43] amen and this brother you don't know yet
[0:47] uh I've been trying to get him out here
[0:48] to introduce y'all uh to him brother
[0:51] Austin Pew uh he moved up he moved up
[0:55] what last year about a year and a half
[0:57] ago something like that and uh but I've
[1:00] been trying to get him out here and uh
[1:01] he's a young
[1:03] Minister and uh I'm not trying to push
[1:05] his ministry I just want to come and in
[1:07] introduce him uh to the group over here
[1:09] because he hasn't he hasn't met y'all I
[1:11] think he's heard a lot about brother
[1:12] Jesse and uh so I I would like for for
[1:16] him to meet him and uh what I'd like to
[1:20] do today is a little bit uh unorthodox I
[1:23] guess you could say uh I I hope it's not
[1:27] dry uh because what I'd like like to do
[1:30] is go through four of the gospels not
[1:32] the whole thing now just uh go through
[1:35] one event and it's it's rare that uh uh
[1:39] one event goes through all four gospels
[1:42] uh so uh that's kind of what I'd like to
[1:46] uh do today so if I see uh falling
[1:50] asleep some yawning I I'll I'll try to
[1:53] close up I don't want to bore you I
[1:55] think this is a place I'm I'm used to
[1:56] setting a timer uh like at the home
[1:59] Church
[2:00] uh other places but I think this is a
[2:02] place that uh I don't need to set a
[2:04] timer uh I kind of grew
[2:07] up uh come and Minister for brother
[2:09] Jesse and brother Cam and uh both groups
[2:13] you know I I remember preaching at
[2:15] brother Cam's one time I wasn't very
[2:17] long he got up afterward he says well we
[2:20] typically like long services this is a
[2:22] little short but we'll take
[2:25] it so however the Lord leads that's the
[2:27] way that I I want to go and I'll try not
[2:30] to be too lengthy uh to keep you keep
[2:33] you hostage but you know on a day like
[2:35] this what else do you have to do
[2:37] so uh if you would turn with me uh to
[2:41] Matthew chapter
[2:43] 26 and starting in the first verse this
[2:47] is on the uh I usually like to title it
[2:52] later but uh I'd like to speak on the
[2:54] alabaster
[2:56] box the alabaster boxen
[3:01] so Matthew
[3:03] 26 first verse to the
[3:09] 16th still hear some pages
[3:12] turning says and it came to pass when
[3:15] Jesus had finished all these sayings he
[3:17] said unto his disciples ye know that
[3:20] after two days is the Feast of the
[3:22] Passover and the son of man is betrayed
[3:25] to be crucified so notice here this one
[3:27] says two days is the Feast of the
[3:30] Passover then assembled together the
[3:32] chief priests and the scribes and the
[3:33] Elders of the people unto the Palace of
[3:35] the high priest who was called
[3:38] Caiaphas and consulted that they might
[3:41] take Jesus by subtlety and kill him they
[3:43] were trying to be secretive and discreet
[3:45] that's what subtlety is there uh and
[3:47] that's how the the serpent was uh he was
[3:50] the most subtle beast in the field so
[3:53] you see the kindred spirit that lies
[3:56] here this is the underlying root right
[3:59] here of the jealousy and the uh
[4:03] misunderstanding of why they are trying
[4:05] to ultimately kill him yes sir so verse
[4:09] five it says but they said not on the
[4:11] feast day lest there be an uproar among
[4:13] the people see they're trying to keep
[4:16] the people pleased at the same time but
[4:18] yet they're they're trying to take uh
[4:21] the blessing away from the people you
[4:23] know kind of doesn't make sense but
[4:25] that's how the devil
[4:27] operates uh now when Jesus was in be
[4:29] Bethany notice he was in Bethany in the
[4:31] house of Simon the
[4:33] leper so there came unto him a woman
[4:36] having an alabaster box a very precious
[4:38] ointment it doesn't say just uh a
[4:41] precious ointment so this is something
[4:44] significant when it says very precious
[4:47] ointment and poured it on his head as he
[4:50] sat at meat but when his disciples saw
[4:53] it they had
[4:54] indignation saying to what purpose is
[4:56] this waste for this ointment might have
[4:59] been sold for much and given to the poor
[5:01] when Jesus understood it he said unto
[5:03] them why trouble ye the woman for she
[5:05] hath wrought a good work upon me so this
[5:08] is a good work that this woman has done
[5:10] Upon Jesus for ye have the poor always
[5:13] with you but me you have not always so
[5:17] do what you can while he's
[5:20] around amen so for in that she hath
[5:24] poured this ointment on my body and a
[5:26] couple verses ahead before it says that
[5:29] uh it was it was poured on his head so
[5:31] Jesus is saying for in that she hath
[5:34] poured this ointment on my body she did
[5:37] it for my burial that's the whole reason
[5:39] why she did it for his burial preparing
[5:41] for the burial so verily I say unto you
[5:44] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[5:46] preached in the whole world there shall
[5:48] also this that this woman hath done be
[5:50] told for a memorial of her because she
[5:52] has done a wonderful act to him gave him
[5:56] honor gave him tribute and there will be
[5:59] a memorial morial wherever the gospel is
[6:01] preached of what she has done she didn't
[6:04] ask for it but it was just the effort
[6:06] that she put forth and that's the result
[6:08] of
[6:09] that
[6:11] so verse 14 then one of the 12 called
[6:14] Judas a scariot went unto the chief
[6:16] priests and said unto them what will you
[6:18] give me and I will deliver him unto you
[6:20] and they Covenant with him for for 30
[6:23] pieces of silver and from that time he
[6:26] sought opportunity to betray him let's
[6:29] bow ahead
[6:31] heavenly father
[6:33] it's with great uh honor that I I stand
[6:38] here before your UH your people today
[6:41] and what a privilege it is Father we
[6:43] just pray that you would be with us help
[6:44] us guide us give us your wisdom uh help
[6:47] us to speak the words of truth and uh
[6:49] guard these lips that they wouldn't
[6:50] speak any G that they wouldn't speak any
[6:52] falseness oh god father we pray that you
[6:55] would be with the hearers that they
[6:57] would have understanding of what would
[6:58] be said today praying that uh it's a
[7:01] blessing to the people uh may they be
[7:04] instructed may they be encouraged may
[7:05] they draw closer unto you father we love
[7:08] you we appreciate you we pray that you
[7:10] would be with brother Josh Martin as
[7:11] he's ministering back at the home Church
[7:13] there and uh just pray that you would be
[7:15] with us through the remainder of the day
[7:16] and always as you had promised that you
[7:19] would never leave us nor forsake us we
[7:21] again we just ask all this in your
[7:23] precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[7:26] amen may be seated
[7:31] so as we read uh through this I kind of
[7:34] wish I had a print out but uh I didn't
[7:37] do
[7:39] that uh so it's going to take me a
[7:42] little bit to kind of go back and forth
[7:43] I just kind of want to uh skim over that
[7:47] pretty quick as I called attention to
[7:49] certain uh
[7:51] details is that they were uh it was two
[7:54] days before the Passover this is in
[7:55] Matthew two days before the Passover
[7:57] they were in Bethany and in the house of
[8:00] Simon the
[8:01] leper uh and the woman came to him with
[8:04] an alabaster box of very precious
[8:06] ointment and poured it on his head now
[8:08] I'm pointing out these different details
[8:10] because uh not that it's amongst us but
[8:13] I've read different things of of how
[8:15] people will debate and dispute uh this
[8:18] whole story because they're concerned
[8:21] about different
[8:23] details uh but if you if you witness a a
[8:27] car accident or an accident at work or
[8:31] something else a Breakin whatever it
[8:32] might be if you have witnessed to action
[8:35] and I'm a witness to an action and the
[8:37] sister here is a witness to that same
[8:39] action they're going to get three
[8:41] different stories from three different
[8:44] Witnesses because it's three different
[8:46] viewpoints three different
[8:49] perceptions so all three of us are not
[8:52] going to line up exactly in every
[8:56] detail these gospels were written by men
[8:59] that were were moved by the Holy Spirit
[9:01] men that were there that got to see
[9:03] things happen and that's just the nature
[9:06] of being a witness is that you might not
[9:09] have all the same details as somebody
[9:11] else and they the the people want uh
[9:15] this detail exactly the same as another
[9:17] detail where you're not going to have
[9:19] that well they say well if God wrote it
[9:22] well these men wrote it as they were
[9:23] moved by the holy spirit so there's
[9:25] going to be some kind of differences and
[9:27] that just shows you of how a human can
[9:30] be used of the Lord right and come up
[9:33] with the same account because they they
[9:34] were writing it much many many more uh
[9:38] many years later here I go again I was
[9:40] having problems talking on the way
[9:43] here so hopefully you get everything
[9:45] understood uh
[9:47] so when they wrote it years later and
[9:50] trying to recall different things you're
[9:51] going to miss some things right so they
[9:55] were just trying to write the account of
[9:57] what they saw and what happened
[10:00] so is it okay if if if some of those
[10:03] details aren't exactly the same you know
[10:07] so it it doesn't deter me from reading
[10:09] the word and and being closer to the
[10:11] Lord it it doesn't push me away so if if
[10:15] you notice at verse eight it says but
[10:17] when his disciples saw it that they had
[10:20] indignation so it's just general it
[10:22] doesn't specify which disciple it just
[10:25] says when his disciples saw it that they
[10:27] had indignation
[10:36] uh and in verse 12 it says uh well in
[10:39] verse 10 excuse
[10:42] me where is it that she anointed him on
[10:45] on it poured it on his
[10:48] head in verse seven so on his head and
[10:51] then a few verses later it says uh Jesus
[10:54] is saying that sheath poured this
[10:55] ointment on my body so right there it
[10:57] almost looks like a uh a discrepancy to
[11:01] different readers well one part is a
[11:03] head one part is the body well the head
[11:05] is part of the body right so and people
[11:09] just get uh caught up in so many of
[11:11] these uh little details that really
[11:14] doesn't mean a whole
[11:15] lot but yet they they they try to uh
[11:19] they try to nullify because well this
[11:21] isn't matching here and if it's supposed
[11:22] to fit dovetail uh then this isn't
[11:25] matching and the puzzle piece isn't
[11:26] going to fit it doesn't fit according to
[11:28] their the ology and what they don't want
[11:30] it to fit to amen so we have to be
[11:33] careful that we don't read it that way
[11:34] with a bias but we need to read the
[11:36] scripture with an open heart open mind
[11:39] and open prayer right so let's turn to
[11:43] Mark 14 starting in the first verse this
[11:47] is the same story remember this this is
[11:49] the same story and I hate using the word
[11:51] story because it sounds like a a bedtime
[11:53] story or a uh uh a fictional story I
[11:57] don't believe that it's fictional
[12:01] right because we have four witness
[12:03] accounts of the same
[12:05] happening well there's something there
[12:08] there might be one that that that might
[12:10] not be the same story but we we'll get
[12:12] to that one and that's that's where
[12:14] people have an issue uh Mark 14 and
[12:17] verse one it says after two days was the
[12:19] Feast of the Passover and of unleavened
[12:21] bread and the chief priests and the
[12:23] scribes sought how they might take him
[12:24] by Craft and put him to death see taking
[12:26] him by subtlety and and to kill him so
[12:30] verse two it says' but they said not on
[12:32] the feast day lest there be an uproar of
[12:33] the people and being where in Bethany
[12:36] and where the house of Simon the leper
[12:39] so these two were saying the same thing
[12:42] as he sat at meat there came a woman
[12:44] having an alabaster box of ointment of
[12:46] nerd okay we got something
[12:48] different there nerd but it also
[12:50] says very precious so this is something
[12:53] that signifies that is very
[12:56] valuable and she break the box and
[12:58] poured it on on his head so those two
[13:01] are collaborative they're they're
[13:03] together they're in saying the same
[13:04] thing and there verse four it says and
[13:06] there were some that had indignation
[13:08] within themselves now this one says and
[13:11] there were some it doesn't say the
[13:13] disciples it doesn't specify one
[13:14] individual it just says that there are
[13:16] some that had indignation within
[13:19] themselves and said why was this waste
[13:21] of the ointment made for it might have
[13:24] been sold for more than 300 p and have
[13:26] been given to the poor and they murmured
[13:28] against against her verse six it says
[13:31] and Jesus said let her alone why trouble
[13:32] ye her she hath wrought a good work on
[13:35] me see this is an emphasis right here is
[13:38] that she has done a good work to
[13:41] him she didn't even
[13:43] realize what she was doing she didn't
[13:47] realize the magnitude of the The Works
[13:50] that she is doing to him but it made
[13:52] such an impact on Jesus that he he's
[13:54] even saying that she wrought a good work
[13:57] on me now let's kind of give a back
[14:00] background to the story does everybody
[14:02] understand what kind of woman this
[14:05] was okay so she had no business one
[14:09] people thought she had no business being
[14:10] in the presence of the Lord you know I
[14:13] don't know if you ever feel that way
[14:14] that you you you do something bad and
[14:16] then you feel that you can't you you you
[14:18] don't deserve his grace you don't
[14:20] deserve to be in the presence of the
[14:22] Lord but repentance right here right
[14:24] here is an example yes a sinner an
[14:27] ill-fame woman she knew what she did she
[14:30] had to go buy the box and she knew what
[14:33] she did before she bought the Box she
[14:35] knew what she was doing with the box
[14:37] right she had plans for this box knowing
[14:40] what kind of a person she was knowing
[14:43] she was damaged
[14:45] goods but until she gets into the
[14:48] presence she didn't know exactly why she
[14:51] was going to do it all she knew she was
[14:53] going to do it she had planned to do it
[14:58] there was something on the inside
[15:00] there's something on the inside of you
[15:01] when you raise your hands to Worship the
[15:03] Lord when you speak some encouragement
[15:05] to somebody there's something with it
[15:07] you don't know why you're saying
[15:08] something I remember saying something
[15:10] here one time to a brother I don't know
[15:12] why I said it but it came out later of
[15:14] why it was being said we might not know
[15:17] why we're saying something but we feel
[15:19] pushed we feel pressed right there's
[15:22] something that we just need to do with
[15:24] it look we're not armchair uh we're not
[15:27] armchair Christians we need to get out
[15:29] do something you know we can't just say
[15:30] that we're Christians right but there
[15:33] has to be Works following that right am
[15:37] so and this is her works of showing that
[15:40] she she was going to get
[15:42] something even if she didn't get favor
[15:44] she wanted to pay him this tribute she
[15:47] at least did something and made an
[15:49] attempt to do
[15:51] something so he says uh sheath wrough a
[15:55] good work on me for ye have the poor
[15:57] with you always and whensoever you will
[15:59] uh whensoever you will you may do them
[16:02] good but me you have not always she have
[16:05] done what she
[16:07] could right there she wasn't highly
[16:11] intelligent she wasn't a Pharisee she
[16:13] didn't know all the scriptures but she
[16:15] did what she
[16:17] could she can't Minister from a Pulpit
[16:20] she might not be the Glorious singer in
[16:22] the church but she did what she
[16:25] could somebody might try to sit her down
[16:28] oh she has no place Place doing this she
[16:29] has no place and they had that
[16:31] indignation don't you know what kind of
[16:33] woman this is and you're letting her
[16:36] touch you she did what she
[16:39] could maybe that's what we should have
[16:41] titled it this
[16:43] morning but she did what she
[16:46] could she did something about it not
[16:50] being an armchair Christian I don't know
[16:52] that thought was in my mind this
[16:54] morning Hallelujah but she has come a
[16:58] forehand to anoint my body to the
[17:02] burying and if you read the chapter
[17:05] before this the two I think it's two not
[17:08] quite the third but at least the two
[17:10] previous chapters in in Matthew before
[17:12] preceding this the uh uh Matthew 24:25
[17:17] he's telling the whole story about him
[17:19] having to go and be crucified he's
[17:22] telling of things of what's going to
[17:23] come and here he's here she's coming and
[17:26] anointing him for that purpose
[17:28] Hallelujah and the disciples have
[17:31] indignation for the work she's doing to
[17:33] him yes they didn't recognize who they
[17:38] were with oh we're with Jesus he does
[17:42] all these Miracles he's able to discern
[17:44] people's hearts but they didn't realize
[17:47] who was who the what presence they were
[17:51] in they couldn't see that far and these
[17:54] are the people that walked with him
[17:59] these are the people that served with
[18:00] him yes they learned from
[18:05] him
[18:06] amen so verse n it says verily I say
[18:09] unto you wheresoever this gospel shall
[18:11] be preached throughout the whole world
[18:12] this also that she hath done shall be
[18:15] spoken of for for a memorial of her see
[18:18] it's the same thing saying the same
[18:19] thing as Matthew right it's going to be
[18:21] a memorial for her and because it made
[18:23] such a mark on him that he really
[18:26] appreciated that and said she did a good
[18:28] thing even when the disciples thought
[18:30] that that uh uh uh she had no business
[18:32] doing it now did the disciples have the
[18:34] same Spirit as the Pharisees that were
[18:36] trying to kill him in
[18:39] subtlety yes see there was oh why let's
[18:43] visit that there for a second yes sir if
[18:46] you go back you know Jesus had his eyes
[18:49] to go somewhere else and the and and the
[18:50] people were kind of upset because it
[18:52] looked like he wasn't paying attention
[18:53] to them it looked like he didn't want to
[18:55] be there so uh uh uh the disciples got
[18:58] upset I can't remember I think it might
[19:00] have been Peter he said Lord shall we
[19:03] call down fire from
[19:06] heaven he said you don't know what
[19:08] Spirit you're of right why because back
[19:12] in the Old Testament when the prophet
[19:14] called down fire it was because they
[19:17] were searching after another
[19:20] God he said is there not a God that's a
[19:22] Healer and you're seeking some other
[19:24] you're seeking some other entity other
[19:26] than me
[19:28] and then they wanted to come to the
[19:30] prophet and slay the prophet see it's
[19:31] been the same age it's that same old
[19:33] devil it's that same old sloof trying to
[19:36] trying to take down the righteousness
[19:38] that's right and it's the same spirit
[19:40] that you see right
[19:42] here the spirits don't
[19:45] die
[19:48] amen he says in verse 10 it says in
[19:50] judas's scariot one of the 12 went unto
[19:53] the chief priest to betray him unto them
[19:55] and when they heard it they were glad
[19:56] and promised to give him money and he
[19:58] sought how we might conveniently betray
[20:02] him and we see that's the same thing
[20:04] Matthew says the same thing that it was
[20:06] Judas that that had indignation and it
[20:08] it wasn't because he wanted to give the
[20:10] money to the poor it's because he was a
[20:12] Treasurer and he was greedy I
[20:16] think got to watch them
[20:19] [Laughter]
[20:20] treasure sorry that was a sideline that
[20:23] that was unnecessary
[20:27] sorry you got watch you got to watch the
[20:30] spirit be behind whoever's amen so so
[20:34] you see in Simon the Lep's
[20:36] house let's visit this here for a
[20:39] second whose house was it Simon the
[20:43] leper now does that seem odd to anybody
[20:47] that there were people in Simon the
[20:48] Lep's
[20:50] house because the law of the leper is
[20:54] you couldn't even have fellowship with
[20:57] people because you had had to be
[21:01] isolated so what happened either he was
[21:06] lepress and was delivered of
[21:11] leprosy or he was not fulfilling the
[21:16] law because in leprosy a person with
[21:20] Leprosy now there's different things in
[21:22] in the in the whole law of it different
[21:25] types if it's if it's white or if it's
[21:27] not if it's a on the whole body there
[21:30] are different levels of whether they
[21:32] could be with people or not and I think
[21:33] it's 10 days that they have to sit
[21:35] outside the camp and the priest had to
[21:37] decide if they were healed or not before
[21:39] that they can come back in Fellowship
[21:42] why because it was contagious yeah that
[21:45] could go a whole another thing the a
[21:46] little leev leth the whole LP right
[21:48] there
[21:52] so so in Luke uh chapter
[21:55] 7 uh so he had to have been healed or
[21:58] something something there right he had
[21:59] to have been delivered of of the leprosy
[22:01] so I don't know why they still call him
[22:03] Simon the leper it could have been
[22:04] because he had leprosy and that's how
[22:06] they were uh uh uh labeling the person
[22:08] of how they could uh uh uh distinguish
[22:11] between uh there aren't twoo a there two
[22:14] names in here anywhere two of the same
[22:18] names so it's so they could distinguish
[22:21] you we distinguish uh brother Brian
[22:23] Crosman from myself you know that's
[22:25] Uncle Brian and I'm brother Brian you
[22:28] know
[22:29] almost everybody calls him Uncle bran at
[22:31] the church so so that would be a
[22:33] distinguishing so that that might be a
[22:35] term used to distinguish this Simon from
[22:37] other Simons because there were a lot of
[22:38] Simons there were a lot of jesuses Amen
[22:42] there were a lot of the same names so in
[22:43] Luke chapter 7 and 22 it says then Jesus
[22:46] answering said unto them go your way and
[22:48] tell John what things you have seen and
[22:51] heard how that the blind see the lame
[22:54] walk the lepers are cleansed right the
[22:58] deaf here the dead are raised to the
[23:00] poor the gospel is preached now I wonder
[23:03] if this Simon the leper was one of these
[23:04] that was that was healed one of these
[23:07] ones that was cleansed now if that's the
[23:09] case he should have had a different
[23:10] attitude of what was going on here right
[23:13] now I'm not saying he was or or wasn't I
[23:16] don't know if he was I I don't know we
[23:17] don't see that in there if he was the
[23:19] one cleansed amen so and we can only
[23:22] infer a little bit from from the
[23:24] information that's given to us so
[23:27] Alabaster box what is an alabaster box
[23:30] you might think that it's something
[23:31] that's so great and magnificent but here
[23:33] you go it's a box made of
[23:37] alabaster which
[23:39] uents the contents are preserved the
[23:43] Ancients considered Alabaster to be the
[23:45] best material in which to preserve their
[23:49] ointments breaking the Box probably
[23:51] means breaking the seal of the box so
[23:54] it's just a storage box to keep ointment
[23:58] yes but it's made out of the best
[24:02] material amen so so what she went and
[24:06] she didn't just go get a little Cedar
[24:08] box you know something for the poor she
[24:10] went and got an alabaster box something
[24:13] that was of the best material yes I say
[24:16] oh my brother I'm going to be all over
[24:18] the place let's go back into Malachi yes
[24:21] where the priest were wanting to give
[24:23] over the lame and the Halk and not the
[24:26] not the choice lamps yes they were
[24:29] shirking their duties why because they
[24:30] were cheating it a little
[24:32] bit she wasn't she wasn't cheating any
[24:35] bit right
[24:36] there she was giving her all let's visit
[24:39] that woman with the two
[24:42] mites just maybe a couple
[24:45] pennies but there were people that were
[24:47] given offering and they were given man
[24:50] they might have been given a couple
[24:51] hundred dollar bills and they think they
[24:54] were given a
[24:55] lot but what did we learn from that
[24:57] parable
[24:59] right that that woman that gave the
[25:01] least amount of money gave the most yeah
[25:04] why because it's not out of our
[25:06] abundance it's out of our lack of what
[25:10] we give right that's the value now she
[25:14] didn't have much but she gave her all
[25:16] she did what she
[25:18] could to get the best for the
[25:21] best he's not some some lame junkie that
[25:25] somebody found out of an alley but he's
[25:27] the king of kings and the Lord of lords
[25:30] amen this man is something
[25:33] important and she didn't give him a lame
[25:36] box a broken box a cheap box a piece of
[25:39] cardboard keeping this ointment in but
[25:42] she gave him of the best
[25:45] material and that just speaks volumes
[25:48] against the ones that were so righteous
[25:49] in that day speak volumes of the ones
[25:53] who should have known hallu the ones
[25:55] that knew the scriptures so well yes sir
[25:59] they know it's so good but they didn't
[26:02] understand it that's right they had eyes
[26:05] to see but couldn't see they had ears to
[26:08] hear but they couldn't hear Hallelujah
[26:11] they were as deaf and dumb and
[26:14] blind as somebody that was in the
[26:17] natural yes sir they couldn't navigate
[26:20] in the
[26:23] Supernatural so what is a spike there we
[26:26] everybody doing okay this morning so
[26:29] let's see what nerd
[26:31] is
[26:33] nerd a very expensive
[26:39] luxury a very expensive luxury item used
[26:43] in perfumes and
[26:45] incense when we have that understanding
[26:47] that she gave the
[26:50] best something very expensive she gave
[26:53] her all for
[26:55] it no matter what her past was
[26:59] yes she wasn't looking at
[27:01] that amen she wasn't looking at well I'm
[27:05] a Baptist well I'm a Methodist well I'm
[27:07] a message I'm a
[27:10] Pentecostal brother sister he's not
[27:12] looking at that he's looking at the
[27:14] blood tag he's looking at the effort
[27:16] that you're putting into it amen he's
[27:18] seeing if you're giving your all not
[27:20] just your effort and just the works to
[27:22] to say that I'm better than somebody but
[27:24] he's looking at your Works to say I
[27:26] believe you Lord
[27:28] I have my faith I believe you so much
[27:30] that I'm going to go out and work for
[27:32] you you speaking to me you want me to do
[27:34] something I'm going to go do it
[27:36] amen that's the value when you sacrifice
[27:39] your time and your money and something
[27:42] for him hallelujah what is a purchase
[27:46] it's sacrificing something to gain
[27:48] something
[27:51] else we go right into the pearl of great
[27:53] price but I'm going to try to focus
[28:00] historically historically it's used to
[28:03] anoint
[28:05] individuals of high
[28:08] esteem of high
[28:10] esteem this was for rich people this was
[28:13] for important people these are for
[28:16] potentates these are this is for
[28:20] Kings not for
[28:23] peasants that's why they were getting
[28:25] upset because they must have had the
[28:27] understanding that Jesus Jus was a
[28:28] peasant he was a poor man he didn't even
[28:30] have a place to lay his
[28:32] head so what was their perception that
[28:35] he's a poor peasant no wonder their
[28:37] indignation came up and this was I
[28:39] didn't even think about this
[28:41] one but they didn't even
[28:44] consider of who he was they didn't know
[28:47] whose presence they were in they didn't
[28:49] know him as king yet they didn't know
[28:51] him as as as Lord of lords yet they
[28:54] didn't know that
[28:56] yetu but this is just to tell you of how
[28:59] how precious it says very precious
[29:04] ointment this isn't everyday uh uh I
[29:08] don't know Johnson's Baby Shampoo it's
[29:11] pretty common stuff right but this is
[29:13] something very
[29:16] expensive to
[29:18] anoint important
[29:21] people people of High
[29:25] esteem so whereas it's used to anoint a
[29:29] person's
[29:30] head which we see that's what she did
[29:33] right broke the box and poured it on his
[29:35] head oh but but it gets even a little
[29:38] bit
[29:39] better used to anoint a person's head
[29:42] whereas the anointing of Jesus feet was
[29:44] considered a
[29:48] waste oh
[29:49] my and that goes along with people not
[29:52] holding him in high
[29:55] regard it's used in religious
[29:59] ceremonies oh but here's a good one
[30:01] coming good thing y'all are sitting down
[30:03] but you might be up here in a
[30:05] minute it's used for emotional and
[30:09] mental
[30:12] well-being this happened when two days
[30:16] before the
[30:17] Passover and what happened
[30:20] after the
[30:23] crucifixion what happened before the
[30:25] crucifixion The Garden of Gethsemane
[30:28] where he faced his greatest
[30:32] struggle he faced his greatest battle to
[30:36] where he said Lord if it be possible let
[30:38] this cup pass from me but nevertheless
[30:41] not my will but I want to continue with
[30:44] your
[30:46] willj not what I want because I want to
[30:48] quit I want to give up this is a weak
[30:51] moment for me and it was so stressful
[30:53] that he was sweating blood yes sir which
[30:57] comes from an extreme stressful
[31:02] situation so this is for an emotional
[31:04] and mental well-being that are among the
[31:07] most celebrated uses of Spiker essential
[31:11] oil it's calming scent
[31:14] see its calming scent is known to have a
[31:18] soothing effect on the
[31:20] mind a soothing effect on the mind
[31:23] making it an excellent aid for reducing
[31:26] Stress and Anxiety
[31:28] y so what was the purpose of she
[31:31] breaking the alabaster box and pouring
[31:33] it on his head what did Jesus say It was
[31:35] done for his burial for his
[31:41] death this was in
[31:44] preparation it wasn't just a a
[31:46] coincidental thing that a that an
[31:48] ill-fame woman spent everything she had
[31:51] on an expensive
[31:53] ointment to anoint him there was a
[31:56] purpose behind it
[31:58] Hallelujah she didn't understand it but
[32:01] he understood it Hallelujah no wonder he
[32:03] could say she had WR a good work on
[32:08] me she had no
[32:11] indignation what did she have to
[32:14] lose consider her place consider your
[32:18] place what do you got to
[32:20] lose come and give your all to
[32:24] him Hallelujah
[32:29] the oil's properties are believed to
[32:32] help balance the emotions providing
[32:35] Tranquility calming him
[32:38] down as a human while you're making him
[32:41] man yes I am making him man because he
[32:44] was fully man but the you say he's God
[32:47] yes he's fully god well I don't
[32:50] understand that well a lot of people
[32:54] don't but once your eyes are open you
[32:57] you can see that he's able to be both
[33:00] man fully and God fully yes sir amen not
[33:05] just a little bit part here and a little
[33:07] bit part here but he's all in all he was
[33:09] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[33:11] Hallelujah fulfilling the scriptures
[33:14] amen yes sir Speak Lord oh
[33:17] my this makes it a valuable
[33:21] asset in bringing peace and Tranquility
[33:25] amen this makes it a valuable asset in
[33:27] practices like meditation and yoga but
[33:30] it's far beyond that
[33:32] brother where it aids in creating a
[33:35] Serene environment you ever been in the
[33:38] presence of the Lord where there's chaos
[33:40] happening in your life and then you
[33:42] happen to come to a service and then all
[33:44] of a sudden you're in that service and
[33:45] you're given worship and that atmosphere
[33:48] becomes Serene amen why because a prince
[33:51] of peace has showed
[33:55] up the king of glory has showed up
[34:01] amen where it aids in creating a Serene
[34:04] environment conducive to relaxation and
[34:08] introspection Jesus was more than likely
[34:11] getting more and more stressed as the
[34:13] days were getting closer for his
[34:15] crucifixion so no wonder he had this
[34:21] ointment
[34:26] amen prise praise the Lord amen yes
[34:37] sir now everyone has their own opinion
[34:39] on how to worship God right you have
[34:42] your way of worshiping God but sometimes
[34:45] you get so stuck to your Traditions that
[34:47] you think everybody has to worship the
[34:49] same way that you do yes sir and that's
[34:52] the hindering aspect is the
[34:55] tradition because if you're Traditions
[34:58] you've been held back because of their
[35:00] Traditions they couldn't see God because
[35:03] of their Traditions they couldn't be set
[35:05] free we are bound by Traditions
[35:09] Hallelujah If We Hold to those
[35:11] Traditions if we let go of that
[35:13] tradition we could be set free brother
[35:15] sister Hallelujah all we have to do is
[35:17] just let go in the presence of the Lord
[35:19] one time
[35:21] amen praise the
[35:23] Lord and people try to say oh this is
[35:26] the right way to worship this you got to
[35:28] raise your hand this way you got to
[35:29] raise your left hand you got to raise
[35:31] both hands you got to have them down low
[35:33] you got to be able to jump one time you
[35:35] got to be able turn around two times
[35:38] people come up with some weird stuff
[35:41] man it's weird show me in the scripture
[35:45] where it says
[35:47] that there was nowhere in the scripture
[35:49] where it's going to say hey bring an
[35:51] alabaster box to some strange man that
[35:53] comes into a leopard's house and anoint
[35:56] him with all
[35:58] yes there was something that pressed on
[36:00] her that she felt that she had some
[36:02] Liberty
[36:05] amen praise God if we just let go one
[36:09] time stop being so stuffy yes
[36:13] sir get on fire one time baby we were
[36:16] listening to some songs this morning the
[36:19] the refiner and then touched by I can't
[36:20] remember what it was yeah touched by a
[36:22] fire I said oh my maybe we should change
[36:25] this this is two songs of having fire in
[36:27] a row but we need a little bit of fire
[36:30] amen youo if you believe the message
[36:32] with brother B he says yo it's okay to
[36:36] get a little out of order now and then
[36:37] because we need a little bit of fire
[36:39] right it's better to have a little fire
[36:42] than no fire at
[36:44] all she did what she could amen so we're
[36:48] going to do what we can amen for what
[36:52] for our Glory uh-uh we don't seek our
[36:55] own that's what love is if we love him
[36:57] we're going to come with love
[37:00] amen
[37:03] so could you just imagine this
[37:07] woman coming into a house that she
[37:10] wasn't even invited more than
[37:12] likely or maybe because of her past
[37:14] maybe she was invited for a certain
[37:17] reason but in her mind she wasn't going
[37:20] to do that no more that's right the
[37:23] things that she used to do she wasn't
[37:24] going to do it no more this was a
[37:26] deciding fact factor in her life that
[37:28] I'm going to bring this I'm done with it
[37:30] I'm through with it and it shows because
[37:31] she spent all that money that she earned
[37:33] from doing what she did on a something
[37:36] for much more righteous praise
[37:41] God Amen so could you imagine this woman
[37:45] coming into a house that she was more
[37:46] than likely not invited you ever go into
[37:48] somebody's house even if you were
[37:49] invited you just feel
[37:53] uncomfortable you just feel a little out
[37:55] of place yes sir why because you're the
[37:58] only one from
[38:01] Pennsylvania you feel a little bit out
[38:03] of place because y'all worship a little
[38:05] bit different y'all sing songs a little
[38:07] bit different from what we do but we got
[38:09] the same Spirit
[38:11] brother Hallelujah if we're not on the
[38:14] same beat we'll get
[38:18] there my kids are said that's just you
[38:23] Dad but imagine this woman coming in
[38:26] could you imagine the easy feeling that
[38:28] she's
[38:29] got the feeling of not belonging knowing
[38:33] her past coming in where there's
[38:35] Pharisees the disciples and
[38:39] Jesus just imagine the weight that's on
[38:42] our shoulders of how she doesn't feel or
[38:45] how she feels that she doesn't
[38:51] belong he took that right away now
[38:53] didn't he sir he made her feel the most
[38:57] most welcome there
[39:00] ever yes
[39:02] sir oh
[39:05] my because she didn't come the way that
[39:08] they thought she should have come well
[39:11] you're supposed to knock on the door
[39:12] three times and wait until you're
[39:13] invited you know before I gave my heart
[39:15] to the Lord I asked my wife you know I
[39:17] felt the pool to go to the Altar and it
[39:19] was it was for like three weeks that I
[39:21] didn't go and I felt that pool and I
[39:23] thought I should have gone and I asked
[39:25] my wife you know uh people were up at
[39:28] the altar and I tap I said do you have
[39:30] to be a member to go up in
[39:33] front
[39:36] no okay I got that cleared up then you
[39:40] don't tell anybody I ask that
[39:43] question why did I ask that
[39:46] question I didn't
[39:49] know it's okay to ask
[39:54] questions here's something else here
[39:57] here's another Rabbit Trail here we
[39:59] go the difference between oh no I just
[40:02] lost his
[40:03] name
[40:07] Zechariah Elizabeth's
[40:10] husband and Mary when they both both
[40:13] asked the question when they were given
[40:14] the situation hey this is going to
[40:17] happen how so how's that going to be two
[40:21] different ideas behind the question good
[40:24] two different reasons behind the
[40:26] question yes same question
[40:29] how one was in disbelief as the other
[40:32] one believed and I don't see it but okay
[40:36] let's
[40:38] gol amen

[40:54] when you sit in the seat of the scornful
[40:55] when you're sitting there criticizing
[40:57] everybody of how they're worshiping so
[40:58] wrong because it's not down to and this
[41:01] is stuff I want so sitting there
[41:03] criticizing people how they worship
[41:05] because they don't worship the same way
[41:06] that you
[41:07] do what's happening right brother you're
[41:10] missing out on what the presence of the
[41:13] Lord you're so busy worried about
[41:15] something else when you should be
[41:17] concentrating on breaking that Alabaster
[41:20] Box and anointing him on his head amen
[41:22] hallelujah giving God oh my giving him a
[41:26] little bit of Glory giving him a little
[41:28] bit of worship giving him a little bit
[41:30] of sacrifice of your time quit worrying
[41:33] about everybody else
[41:35] Hallelujah we got to focus on him glory
[41:39] to God
[41:41] hallelujah oh my see the problem
[41:45] is these people had so much pride they
[41:48] couldn't let go yes sir yes

[42:59] probably can I know the scripture way
[43:02] better than you I know the message way
[43:05] better than you and you probably do
[43:09] right it's not where it
[43:12] is brother brandom said you know the man
[43:14] came and told Brother brand well you
[43:16] don't know your
[43:19] Bible he said that might be so you might
[43:22] know it better than me and you know that
[43:25] man was humble enough to say these these
[43:27] men here sitting in here probably know
[43:28] the Bible better than I do talking about
[43:31] the theologians
[43:33] right that takes a lot for a man to say
[43:36] especially when they come and Blas him
[43:38] about different things oh you're he's so
[43:40] prideful show
[43:42] me because he had so much humility that
[43:44] he could say that somebody knew more
[43:46] than he did right brother yes but what
[43:49] did he say I know the author real
[43:54] well God so where we sitting brother and
[43:58] sister
[43:59] Hallelujah you might memorize so many
[44:02] scriptures and I probably
[44:04] forgot all the scriptures that I
[44:07] memorize then you probably have
[44:09] memorized you
[44:12] young now I'm not gloating somebody
[44:14] could be competitive in
[44:19] that but if we can come together and we
[44:23] can agree we're going to Worship the
[44:25] Lord amen praise the Lord what can I do
[44:27] for you what can I pray for you with
[44:31] Hallelujah we come unified in the spirit
[44:34] amen that's where it is because why
[44:37] we're not looking at one another am
[44:39] you're going to forget what color shirt
[44:41] I'm wearing today by next
[44:43] week what does that matter people are
[44:46] looking at carnality way too
[44:51] much
[44:53] Hallelujah you were off key here you
[44:55] threw me off
[44:58] I couldn't sing the rest of the rest of
[45:00] the
[45:00] service
[45:03] sorry get used to it because that's how
[45:05] I am I might be offbeat but that's how I
[45:09] am because I'm going to make a Joyful
[45:12] Noise unto the
[45:13] Lord you might criticize I don't
[45:17] care because I'm going to sing and I'm
[45:20] going to sing with gusto
[45:23] Hallelujah my kids are musicians and
[45:25] they probably cringe every time I sing
[45:27] or do
[45:29] something they could do that at home
[45:31] just don't criticize me in the church in
[45:32] the middle of
[45:34] worship because then it's on
[45:36] you
[45:38] amen because they should be worshiping
[45:41] where we should be in worship I better
[45:43] get going
[45:45] here amen but you
[45:49] know this woman had the idea she I think
[45:52] she had an idea of where Jesus was
[45:55] because she sought him out I oh brother
[45:59] that's not the way it was in the Garden
[46:00] of Eden that's not what I'm talking
[46:05] about he's coming seeking after you
[46:07] giving that
[46:10] press she answered that press
[46:15] already but now it seek
[46:19] him just like David brother
[46:22] Jesse the Lord told her seek me and he
[46:26] said says thy face Lord will I seek
[46:31] Hallelujah that press was already there
[46:34] she was answering that press by seeking
[46:37] him out

[47:00] messages yes sir that man you know the
[47:03] the Lord asked him well how do you see

[47:07] not far from the kingdom of heaven yes

[47:25] scoffield King James Bible that's good
[47:29] enough I can stop there I'll read it

[47:33] while just so I could say with a good
[47:36] conscience when somebody asks have you
[47:38] been reading your Bible well yes I've
[47:41] been reading my Bible but I'm not going

[47:51] and sister but we've got to press press

[47:58] seeking him out every day Paul said I
[48:03] Die daily and he also said with my mind
[48:08] I serve the Lord
[48:10] hallelujah putting the things in the
[48:13] past behind me because I'm letting go of
[48:16] that weight that's easily besetting me
[48:19] but I'm going to go on and I'm going to
[48:21] press as hard as I
[48:24] can I'm going I'm not just going to
[48:26] throw out a couple quarters and buy some
[48:28] cheap thing like most people do at
[48:30] Christmas time because they wait until

[49:43] that's trying to hold you down yes
[49:46] sir that blood isn't weak brother and

[50:01] Liberty oh my nothing is held against

[50:14] word in perspective Justified my kids

[50:19] going you use
[50:22] contractions like it's going to be a
[50:24] good day
[50:27] they're rejoicing in the Holy Ghost they
[50:30] are right so let's use a
[50:35] contraction just if i' I
[50:41] had just if I'd never done it in the
[50:44] first
[50:45] place Justified
[50:49] simplified amen praise the Lord let's
[50:52] turn to Luke chapter 7 I better get
[50:54] going we'll be here all day
[50:57] Luke 7 verse
[51:06] 36 everybody doing okay
[51:09] [Music]
[51:10] amen somebody praise the Lord praise the
[51:13] Lord amen Luke 7 and starting 36th
[51:20] verse it says and one of the Pharisees
[51:23] desired him that he would eat with him
[51:26] see this this Pharisee desired Jesus to
[51:29] come and eat with him
[51:31] right and he went into the Pharisees
[51:34] house and sat down to
[51:37] meet verse 37 it says and behold a woman
[51:40] in the city which was a sinner which we
[51:42] know this already
[51:44] right when she knew that Jesus sat at
[51:46] meat in the Pharisees house brought an
[51:49] alabaster box see she knew that he sat
[51:51] at meat I couldn't remember but I should
[51:53] have remembered because there but he
[51:56] knew that uh Jesus sat at meet in the
[51:58] Pharisees house brought an alabaster box
[52:01] of
[52:02] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[52:05] him weeping oh
[52:08] my being in the presence of the Lord
[52:11] some people react
[52:15] differently people that love the Lord
[52:18] when they recognize when they're in the
[52:20] presence of the Lord will respond
[52:23] differently than somebody that cannot
[52:26] recognize
[52:27] who he is what he's done and in that
[52:30] they're in the
[52:31] presence yes
[52:33] sir when she got into the presence oh
[52:38] my I had this thought here a little
[52:40] while back you
[52:42] know if you read through I know it's
[52:45] another
[52:46] Trail if you read through when the angel
[52:49] of the Lord when an angel came in the
[52:53] presence of a man what did the man do
[52:57] they bow
[52:58] down and to give obeisance to bow down
[53:02] before them and give honor and tribute
[53:04] and what did the angel say see thou do
[53:07] it
[53:08] not because I'm not the one that you
[53:10] need to
[53:12] worship if a man is compelled to do that
[53:16] in the presence of an Angel oh
[53:22] my how should we as a Believer respond
[53:26] in the presence of the almighty amen if
[53:30] a man is going to do that in the
[53:31] presence of an Angel how much more we
[53:34] should do that in the Lord's presence
[53:37] amen
[53:39] sir so her coming in the presence of the
[53:42] Lord she was weeping and she began to
[53:46] wash his feet with her
[53:50] tears brother sister that wasn't just a
[53:54] little dribble
[53:58] that wasn't a little squeeze out of tear
[54:01] because I know it's not right to give a
[54:03] drye
[54:08] confession this
[54:11] was this was a
[54:13] sincere repentance because remember she
[54:16] gave him her all she's giving him all of
[54:20] her
[54:23] repentance oh here goes another one now
[54:26] repentance we understand repentance I
[54:30] think some people might not fully
[54:32] understand what repentance is see they
[54:34] go so far and they say Lord forgive me
[54:38] but it's just like the Old Testament and
[54:39] they continue on doing what they were
[54:41] doing yes sir but repentance means to
[54:45] stop what you're
[54:47] doing yes not go in the same direction
[54:50] but it means to turn and go the opposite
[54:53] direction
[54:57] the things you used to do do them no
[55:03] more that is
[55:05] repentance not saying well I've been
[55:08] forgiven this time and then after I go
[55:09] to service I'll go right back to what
[55:11] I'm
[55:12] doing that's not repentance
[55:16] Hallelujah that is a motive to continue
[55:20] in sin that is making Grace disgrace
[55:27] oh
[55:30] my there's a difference she had she was
[55:33] giving everything this is a sincere
[55:37] repentance amen that she had flowing
[55:41] tears tears enough to wash his
[55:47] feet and we think that a little shot
[55:50] glass not that I want you to know what a
[55:51] shot glass is but it's just a what uh I
[55:55] don't even think it's a full
[56:00] ounce but it's small enough and we think
[56:02] that that might that's not enough to
[56:04] wash his
[56:07] feet what did it say in the other one
[56:10] she did what she
[56:14] could and she did her
[56:18] best that whether it was a shot glass or
[56:22] whether it was
[56:24] a what I can't even remember what
[56:27] they're
[56:28] called like the one liter the big
[56:32] slams whether it's a big drink or
[56:35] whether it's a small one you give them
[56:37] all the worship that you can you give
[56:39] them all that you have you might have a
[56:41] little bit of Faith don't look at other
[56:43] people with great faith because it's
[56:45] going to ruin your faith
[56:50] amen so whether it was a little or
[56:53] whether it was a lot it doesn't matter
[56:55] it just says that she washed his feet
[56:57] with her tears amen amen but what does
[57:01] matter here is that she wiped them with
[57:04] their hairs of her head she had enough
[57:08] hair I'm so glad I don't have to worry
[57:11] about that but she that and the the the
[57:15] woman's hair is the glory of her right
[57:17] it's her
[57:18] glory she oh my she even surrendered her
[57:23] glory to what washing his feet and the
[57:26] ointment was something so great it was
[57:28] looked down upon for using it on his
[57:31] feet and she gave him her
[57:35] glory that she dried his feet with the
[57:38] lowest part of his
[57:44] body looked as the the dirtiest part of
[57:47] a
[57:49] body and she humbled herself enough to
[57:53] surrender her glory
[57:57] that should give a whole new meaning of
[57:59] this scripture that should give a whole
[58:01] new meaning to you to come with more
[58:03] sincerity to give out more of you to
[58:06] him
[58:14] amen what is the next one and kissed his
[58:18] feet
[58:28] she brought herself so low that she even
[58:31] kissed the lowest part of his
[58:37] body and anointed them with ointment
[58:42] verse 39 now when the Pharisee which had
[58:44] bidden him saw it he spake within
[58:46] himself saying this man if he were a
[58:49] prophet would have known who and what
[58:51] manner of woman this is that touches
[58:52] them for she is a sinner and Jesus
[58:54] answering saying unto him Simon I have
[58:56] somewh to say unto thee and he saith
[59:00] Master say on there was a certain
[59:02] creditor which had two debtors the one
[59:04] owed 500 p and the other 50 and when
[59:07] they had nothing to pay he frankly
[59:08] forgave them both tell me therefore
[59:10] which which of them will love him most
[59:13] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[59:15] he to whom he forgave most and he said
[59:18] unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he
[59:21] turned to the woman and said unto Simon
[59:23] you see this woman see us thou this
[59:25] woman I entered into thine house thou
[59:27] gavest me no water for my feet but she
[59:29] has washed my feet with her tears and
[59:32] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[59:34] thou gavest me no kiss at all gave me no
[59:37] entertainment at all didn't even
[59:39] acknowledge that I came
[59:44] in having a form of godliness but
[59:48] denying the power
[59:51] thereof quit just having a
[59:54] form have that
[1:00:00] godliness thou gavest me no
[1:00:03] kiss but this woman since the time I
[1:00:05] came in ha not ceased to kiss my feet my
[1:00:08] hand with oil thou did not anoint but
[1:00:10] this woman ha anointed my feet with
[1:00:12] ointment wherefore I say unto thee her
[1:00:15] sins which are many are forgiven
[1:00:18] amenallah for she loved much but to whom
[1:00:22] little was forgiven the same loveth
[1:00:27] little not to be competitive but I love
[1:00:30] the Lord a
[1:00:32] lot why because I've been forgiven a
[1:00:37] lot I'm not saying go out there and sin
[1:00:40] as much as you can just to say you love
[1:00:42] him is so much more than somebody
[1:00:46] else but you come with what you
[1:00:50] have you're going to do what you
[1:00:54] can don't try to have somebody else's
[1:00:56] testimony you bring your
[1:00:59] testimony it doesn't have to be
[1:01:01] something so great because somebody
[1:01:03] who's bragging on their testimony isn't
[1:01:06] really isn't really sorry that they did
[1:01:08] it
[1:01:10] probably why because they're bragging
[1:01:12] about
[1:01:13] it when they should be remorseful about
[1:01:17] it yeah those are the things that I used
[1:01:20] to
[1:01:22] do and sometimes it's funny because like
[1:01:25] I think I told told yall that I put on a
[1:01:27] dress one time yes I'll have to tell you
[1:01:29] brother sometime later there's a long
[1:01:30] story and that was a long time ago and
[1:01:33] it wasn't for that
[1:01:34] reason it was out of a dare so I'll just
[1:01:37] leave it at
[1:01:40] that I've been forgiven much you don't
[1:01:44] have to magnify your testimony just tell
[1:01:47] the truth yes sir amen just tell What
[1:01:50] the Lord Has Done For You Hallelujah god
[1:01:53] well I don't have a testimony the Lord
[1:01:55] hasn't done much
[1:01:58] we talk about it a lot back at home you
[1:02:01] made it to church didn't
[1:02:03] you you make it to work day in day out
[1:02:06] you make it to the grocery store day in
[1:02:08] day
[1:02:09] out you got food on your table you got
[1:02:12] CL clothes on your back you got a roof
[1:02:14] over your head yes sir yes sir it might
[1:02:17] not be like Donald
[1:02:19] Trump's and it might not be like the the
[1:02:22] homeless beggar on the street but you
[1:02:24] got something
[1:02:30] am we got to stop looking for the best
[1:02:32] of material things that's
[1:02:34] carnality we should be looking for the
[1:02:36] best things to give to our Lord give him
[1:02:39] the best of our service give him the
[1:02:41] best of what we have amen
[1:02:50] hallelujah and they that sat at meat
[1:02:52] with with him began to say within
[1:02:54] themselves who is this that forgive us
[1:02:56] sins also see and that just goes to show
[1:02:59] that they had no idea whose presence
[1:03:00] they were in and he said to the woman
[1:03:03] thy faith has saved thee go in peace
[1:03:09] hallu see it didn't
[1:03:13] say when this was taking place the other
[1:03:15] two said two days before the Passover
[1:03:17] right but it was in the city it doesn't
[1:03:19] say which city it just says in a city
[1:03:22] but it it's conclusive that there was a
[1:03:25] sinner and it was a
[1:03:27] woman she brought some ointment she
[1:03:29] anointed his body we'll just we'll just
[1:03:31] keep it as the body regardless of it's
[1:03:33] head or feet we'll just say body okay
[1:03:35] because we understand that those are
[1:03:36] parts of the body so we know that there
[1:03:39] was an anointing of this ointment on his
[1:03:44] body there was a washing of feet there
[1:03:46] was a drying
[1:03:48] of so and we know that Jesus people were
[1:03:52] had indignation toward the toward the
[1:03:55] action that took place right so people
[1:03:57] were upset of what she was
[1:04:01] doing so we could say that these these
[1:04:03] iters items are conclusive he doesn't
[1:04:05] say anything about the poor in in this
[1:04:07] particular book here right so it almost
[1:04:10] looks like it's a different
[1:04:15] place why because it says of a Pharisee
[1:04:19] it doesn't say Simon it doesn't say a
[1:04:22] leper but it appears to be the same
[1:04:25] thing
[1:04:28] you it's hard for me to believe that
[1:04:29] this is a coincidence that two identical
[1:04:33] situation two identical
[1:04:36] events are taking
[1:04:39] place I have a hard time with that you
[1:04:42] could try to convince
[1:04:44] me but to me it doesn't really
[1:04:48] matter
[1:04:50] okay all I know all I'm seeing is what
[1:04:55] he taught that's what I got out of this
[1:04:58] I didn't pick out all these little
[1:05:00] details of of what's lining up from one
[1:05:02] book to the other I picked out the
[1:05:06] lesson that's what spoke to me
[1:05:12] Hallelujah that's what brings it to
[1:05:15] light hallelujah amen so John chapter 12
[1:05:19] and I'll try to I don't we doing okay
[1:05:22] yes sir
[1:05:25] John chapter 12 verse
[1:05:32] one you can call me crazy you can tell
[1:05:35] me I don't mind know my Bible you can
[1:05:36] tell me I don't have the understanding
[1:05:38] that's fine that's Dandy that's
[1:05:41] okay I'm okay with
[1:05:43] that as long as that's you if the Lord
[1:05:46] told me that I would be like this woman
[1:05:48] getting in his presence in
[1:05:50] repenting amen so you see the difference
[1:05:55] I'm not here to please
[1:05:57] you you're not here to please your
[1:05:59] fellow
[1:06:01] man so John chapter 12 starting in the
[1:06:03] first verse it says then Jesus when six
[1:06:07] days before the
[1:06:09] Passover oh the other one was two days
[1:06:13] and the other one was
[1:06:14] unspecified oh we got a discrepancy we
[1:06:17] don't believe the word anymore I'm not
[1:06:19] going to go to church I can't read the
[1:06:20] Bible if it can't be if if it's if
[1:06:24] there's no continuity in there then I
[1:06:25] just can't believe a Bible that breaks
[1:06:31] continuity that's the argument that you
[1:06:33] he brothers and
[1:06:36] sisters but you
[1:06:39] know I'm going to combat that thing and
[1:06:41] say that that Spirit was there
[1:06:43] before that Spirit was already in place
[1:06:46] that Spirit doesn't want to see the
[1:06:48] truth that's that spirit is already a
[1:06:52] blind
[1:06:53] spirit and that's what I got to say
[1:06:55] about
[1:06:57] that so then Jesus six days before the
[1:07:00] Passover came to Bethany same place
[1:07:02] where Lazarus was which had been dead
[1:07:05] whom he raised from the
[1:07:07] dead so people knew about those
[1:07:10] wonder they knew the
[1:07:14] possibilities they knew the
[1:07:17] potential that's why I kind of wonder if
[1:07:19] this Simon the leper was amongst them of
[1:07:22] the lepers that were cleansed but hey
[1:07:25] then it says then took
[1:07:29] who
[1:07:30] Mary now it's specifying an
[1:07:35] individual oh this can't be the same
[1:07:38] story as the other
[1:07:41] three right that's the argument I'm not
[1:07:44] I'm not saying that personally I'm I'm
[1:07:45] thinking this is the same thing so then
[1:07:48] took Mary a pound of ointment of
[1:07:50] nerd very costly and anointed the feet
[1:07:52] of Jesus and wiped his feet with her
[1:07:53] hair same story same things
[1:07:57] happening right and the house was filled
[1:08:00] with the odor of ointment then saith one
[1:08:02] of the disciples oh even this is the
[1:08:04] same all four somebody was upset all
[1:08:08] four they had indignation at the event
[1:08:10] taking place yes
[1:08:13] Hallelujah all four were critical of a
[1:08:17] worship to the
[1:08:18] Lord and the house was filled with the
[1:08:20] odor of ointment then saith one of his
[1:08:22] disciples Judas es scariot up there's
[1:08:24] another one sing L out now we're getting
[1:08:29] somewhere John has a habit of doing that
[1:08:32] of being a little bit more
[1:08:36] specific I love how brother gab Smith
[1:08:38] did that the Book of John oh man that
[1:08:40] was some good eating that
[1:08:44] day that brother brought out so much
[1:08:46] stuff oh my good that I that was a good
[1:08:50] message so then saith one of his
[1:08:52] disciples Judas the scariot Simon's son
[1:08:54] oo
[1:08:57] Simon's son which should betray him so
[1:09:01] we know Judas the scariot is the one who
[1:09:03] betrayed him the first two we see Simon
[1:09:06] the leper doesn't say that he was a
[1:09:08] Pharisee
[1:09:10] right in Luke we see that it was Simon a
[1:09:18] Pharisee where we getting here so Simon
[1:09:21] the leper a Pharisee this is where
[1:09:24] they're now this is my understanding is
[1:09:26] this okay brother
[1:09:29] Jesse I know I came with something
[1:09:31] different I didn't know how he was going
[1:09:32] to respond to this I'll find out
[1:09:35] afterward he he's been so gracious and
[1:09:38] and extending me liberty to to come and
[1:09:40] and speak so he has confidence that I'm
[1:09:43] not going to intentionally lead you down
[1:09:45] a wrong path right
[1:09:49] so so we see uh one of the disciples
[1:09:53] which is Judas a scariot and we know
[1:09:55] that is going to betray Jesus right so
[1:09:57] and this is Simon's son why was uh uh uh
[1:10:02] Judas is asking why was not this
[1:10:03] ointment sold for 300 p and given to the
[1:10:05] poor so now it gets to the the the root
[1:10:08] of the issue here of Judas was the the
[1:10:12] the bag holder right he was the
[1:10:15] treasurer his motive wasn't so much that
[1:10:17] he wanted to give to the poor and I
[1:10:19] don't believe that that was his true
[1:10:21] motive right sometimes you hear oh boy
[1:10:24] here he goes that form of godliness
[1:10:26] sometimes you hear people have a
[1:10:28] confession and they say things because
[1:10:30] they're sooth
[1:10:32] saying telling you something that you
[1:10:34] want to hear but there're a sheep and
[1:10:37] wolves clothing right so it's a
[1:10:39] deception so be careful watch that
[1:10:41] person watch that
[1:10:44] Spirit yes sir watch that spirit because
[1:10:48] you'll see it manifest in other places
[1:10:50] when they're not paying attention when
[1:10:51] they're not trying to be so so good in
[1:10:53] front of everybody when they let loose a
[1:10:56] little
[1:10:57] bit you'll see the tress don't you worry
[1:11:01] you don't have to force it it it'll just
[1:11:03] come all by itself
[1:11:05] right it it'll show yes sir we just have
[1:11:09] to have our eyes open to
[1:11:10] it so verse six he says then he said not
[1:11:13] that he cared for the poor but because
[1:11:15] he was a thief in case if you thought
[1:11:16] what I said was wrong he say this is
[1:11:18] saying itself that he didn't care for
[1:11:20] the poor so not that he cared for the
[1:11:22] poor but because he was a thief and had
[1:11:24] the bag and bear what was put therein
[1:11:27] verse 7 then said Jesus let her alone
[1:11:29] against the day of my burying has she
[1:11:31] kept
[1:11:33] this same thing same situation right for
[1:11:37] the uh for the poor you always you have
[1:11:40] with me or with you but me ye have not
[1:11:42] always much people of the Jews therefore
[1:11:44] knew that he was there and they came not
[1:11:46] for jesus' sake
[1:11:49] only but that they might see Lazarus
[1:11:51] also whom he had raised from the dead
[1:11:54] but the chief priest consult Ed that
[1:11:56] they might put Lazarus also to death
[1:11:59] because why that by reason of him many
[1:12:02] of the Jews went away and believed on
[1:12:06] Jesus oh you know what's taking place
[1:12:10] there taking money out of their
[1:12:13] pocket so now it's therefore no longer
[1:12:17] lucrative in this church
[1:12:20] because true things are happen oh
[1:12:22] they're prelighting they're pulling
[1:12:24] people away
[1:12:25] is taking money out of their
[1:12:27] pocket see there's no money in my pocket
[1:12:30] so you can't take
[1:12:33] it it's already
[1:12:37] gone now it's just set
[1:12:41] aside so this this was the whole reason
[1:12:44] this is the root of it because they were
[1:12:46] taking the Jews away from
[1:12:50] them because in their eyes they were
[1:12:52] going to look to the public they were
[1:12:54] going to be they were no longer
[1:12:57] significant see these people had so much
[1:12:59] pride that they broadened their
[1:13:00] filteries to look so much more Pious
[1:13:03] than other
[1:13:07] people oh
[1:13:10] my
[1:13:13] so Simon is uh Judas iscariot's father
[1:13:17] Simon the leper Simon the Pharisees
[1:13:19] Simon judas's Father the are they the
[1:13:21] same person to me and does it mean any
[1:13:24] does it matter not really I'm just
[1:13:26] trying to tie the story together a
[1:13:28] little bit so John 12:4 says then saith
[1:13:31] one of his disciples Judas the scari at
[1:13:33] Simon's son which should betray him
[1:13:35] Simon's son right so in John 13:2 it
[1:13:39] says and supper being ended the devil
[1:13:41] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:13:42] the scariot Simon's son to
[1:13:46] betray now John
[1:13:48] 11 and verse
[1:13:52] one this is this is kind of
[1:13:56] strange to me but it's
[1:14:02] there and everybody's
[1:14:05] waiting now remember we read in John
[1:14:08] 12 and now this is John 11 it says now a
[1:14:11] certain man was sick named Lazarus of
[1:14:13] Bethany the town of Mary and her sister
[1:14:16] Martha well what significance is that so
[1:14:21] verse
[1:14:23] two it was that
[1:14:25] Mary oh my it was that Mary that which
[1:14:29] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[1:14:30] wiped his feet with her hair whose
[1:14:32] brother Lazarus was sick this is
[1:14:35] mentioned before the event actually took
[1:14:38] place in chapter
[1:14:41] 12 that was a little strange to me but
[1:14:44] uh but we also have the understanding
[1:14:46] that they they wrote the scriptures
[1:14:49] later right yes sir so this isn't this
[1:14:52] isn't real time okay so
[1:14:59] so I'm going to try to bring things to a
[1:15:01] close everybody okay
[1:15:05] so and you might be asking in your mind
[1:15:08] I've kind of asked that already is what
[1:15:10] is the purpose of you bringing out all
[1:15:11] these differences so because one thing
[1:15:15] is is there's there are people having
[1:15:18] dispute and disagreements and arguing
[1:15:21] over these like I said earlier that uh
[1:15:24] that the
[1:15:26] uh the details of each of the
[1:15:29] story okay so that that's one thing so
[1:15:32] Luke chap chapter
[1:15:34] 10 and verse
[1:15:36] 38 I just want to read this uh real
[1:15:39] quick it says now it came to pass as
[1:15:40] they went that he entered into a certain
[1:15:42] Village and a certain woman named Martha
[1:15:44] received him into her house just kind of
[1:15:46] distinguishing the the service of of
[1:15:48] Mary and Martha because this is going
[1:15:50] back and this is saying that this is the
[1:15:52] same uh situation here right because we
[1:15:54] read the this was this was that Mary
[1:15:56] that uh anointed his head and washed his
[1:15:58] feet so uh now it came to pass as they
[1:16:01] went that he entered into a certain
[1:16:03] Village and a certain woman named Martha
[1:16:04] received him into her house and she had
[1:16:07] a sister called Mary which also sat at
[1:16:09] jesus' feet and heard his
[1:16:13] word where was she
[1:16:15] sitting at jesus'
[1:16:18] feet what happened in these stories that
[1:16:21] we read as she anointed his feet
[1:16:25] so she was at his feet in this same
[1:16:27] story right here
[1:16:32] uh verse 40 but Martha was cumbered
[1:16:34] about much serving and came to him and
[1:16:36] said Lord Dost thou not care that my
[1:16:39] sister hath left me uh uh to serve alone
[1:16:41] bid her therefore that she helped me and
[1:16:44] Jesus answered and said unto her Martha
[1:16:45] Martha Thou Art come about uh uh excuse
[1:16:49] me thou art careful and troubled about
[1:16:51] many
[1:16:52] things but one thing is is
[1:16:55] needful and Mary hath chosen that good
[1:16:59] part which shall not be taken away from
[1:17:05] her why because we read in the other
[1:17:08] ones that that act is a memorial unto
[1:17:12] her and what she did there being at the
[1:17:15] feet of Jesus doing a good work unto
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] him brother sister
[1:17:25] the parable that Jesus had had had
[1:17:28] talked about when you gave somebody
[1:17:30] something to drink you gave
[1:17:33] something you gave somebody something to
[1:17:35] eat you clothed
[1:17:38] somebody and what did he say when you
[1:17:41] did it to the least of these you did it
[1:17:43] unto me so when we do something for one
[1:17:47] another we are doing a great work for
[1:17:51] him so let us do what we can can while
[1:17:56] we can
[1:17:58] amen so but one thing is needful Mary
[1:18:01] has chosen that good part which shall
[1:18:03] not be taken away from
[1:18:06] her now see we were talking on the way
[1:18:08] here uh sh was saying you know it just
[1:18:12] seems to be that spirit in this day and
[1:18:14] it is is that everything is just fast
[1:18:17] busy fast busy have no time for doing
[1:18:22] things but that's where it comes to get
[1:18:25] your Alabaster Box you can call it
[1:18:28] time what's in your Alabaster Box yes
[1:18:31] hallelujah what are you going to bring
[1:18:33] what is important to
[1:18:35] you me personally I'm going to be honest
[1:18:38] and open and tell you I need to answer
[1:18:42] that same question myself I have to
[1:18:44] reflect I have to go back and see what's
[1:18:46] important to me and choose the priority
[1:18:50] going to a volleyball game to suffice a
[1:18:53] friend's invitation
[1:18:55] isn't more important than the word of
[1:18:57] God I'm not saying those things are bad
[1:19:00] but if you're busy busy busy busy and
[1:19:02] that's like the the lowest of the
[1:19:03] priority of the list throughout the
[1:19:06] day and you need to get into the
[1:19:08] presence of the Lord should probably sh
[1:19:10] that uh unless you gave your word
[1:19:12] because you better hold on to your
[1:19:14] word that's why try not to give your
[1:19:17] word that way you're not held to
[1:19:19] something right if you will try to go
[1:19:21] there if the Lord will we'll go there
[1:19:24] tomorrow this this day that day right
[1:19:27] so everything okay praise the Lord so
[1:19:31] how will the bride make herself ready
[1:19:34] it's not going to be like Martha it's
[1:19:36] not going to be comfort about much
[1:19:38] things and and being busy busy busy busy
[1:19:40] that uh no time for anything but it's
[1:19:42] coming like
[1:19:44] Mary it's coming like Mary because she
[1:19:48] have chosen the right thing amen
[1:19:52] so through all this
[1:19:55] I'm going to
[1:19:56] say
[1:19:59] uh through all these details that were
[1:20:01] given and the the
[1:20:03] comparison that that's nice as a as a
[1:20:06] conversation piece you know talking
[1:20:08] about different things
[1:20:11] and bouncing off ideas off of one hey
[1:20:14] what do you think about this story I'm
[1:20:16] kind of having a hard time you know
[1:20:18] putting things together uh so what was
[1:20:22] what was a point of of bringing that it
[1:20:26] doesn't matter who was
[1:20:28] where where they were you know who they
[1:20:31] were doesn't matter who they were where
[1:20:33] they were what they were doing uh it
[1:20:35] matters what they were doing
[1:20:37] that's but do you understand what I mean
[1:20:39] but the the through this whole
[1:20:43] situation I don't we don't know how many
[1:20:45] people were were there we know that
[1:20:47] Simon the leper was there we know that
[1:20:49] Judas was there and it says disciples so
[1:20:52] I can only infer that there are more
[1:20:54] than one disciple there right so it says
[1:20:57] more than one disci indicates more than
[1:20:59] one disciple we know Mary was there we
[1:21:01] know Martha was there we know Lazarus
[1:21:03] was there we know that other people
[1:21:05] gathered because they wanted to see
[1:21:07] Lazarus which we read in the scripture
[1:21:09] right so there were several people
[1:21:12] there but there was one singled
[1:21:16] out that recognized the presence of the
[1:21:22] Lord all these details can derail
[1:21:26] somebody but when we look at it what did
[1:21:30] you get out of the lesson out of the
[1:21:32] parable that he was
[1:21:34] teaching to me I got he who's forgiven
[1:21:37] much loves
[1:21:39] muchl to me I got your sins are
[1:21:42] forgiven to me I got she did a great
[1:21:46] work and if she did a great work I
[1:21:49] should pattern
[1:21:50] myself to do a great work right these
[1:21:54] are the things that we should be getting
[1:21:56] out of not concerned so much of all
[1:21:59] these details that we find out tend to
[1:22:01] line
[1:22:03] up it's not so much in disputing and
[1:22:06] arguing and competing with one another
[1:22:09] right because the scripture says blessed
[1:22:12] are your eyes that you could
[1:22:15] see we can't
[1:22:18] criticize others relationship if ours is
[1:22:23] wrecked yes
[1:22:25] Hallelujah that's scriptural by the way
[1:22:27] but not not those exact words you know
[1:22:30] the log and the and the Splinter you
[1:22:33] know how can you correct somebody when
[1:22:34] you got something going on in your own
[1:22:36] eye you're trying to pull out something
[1:22:37] small out of somebody else's and you got
[1:22:39] this big old huge thing in you and your
[1:22:40] eye take that thing out you
[1:22:43] know so and that's what we're getting at
[1:22:47] don't get caught up in so much of the
[1:22:48] details yeah it it's nice to to read
[1:22:50] through the scripture and see where
[1:22:52] things fit you know putting it together
[1:22:53] like a puzzle I understand that but when
[1:22:56] people are fighting bicker and
[1:22:57] backbiting one another because they
[1:22:59] don't see what you see or they think
[1:23:01] that you're wrong and but what what do
[1:23:03] we understand that to be I'd rather be
[1:23:06] right in my spirit and wrong in my
[1:23:08] Doctrine than vice
[1:23:10] versa right I don't want to be wrong in
[1:23:13] the spirit if I could be corrected I I
[1:23:16] want to let you know hey thank you for
[1:23:18] showing me that I'll look more into
[1:23:21] it and I'll pray about it
[1:23:25] I'm not right de flash I'm not right
[1:23:27] about everything I'm not always
[1:23:30] right and I hear Hawkins kids hey man
[1:23:34] sorry I shouldn't be
[1:23:36] joking I'm a human being none of us are
[1:23:38] right all the
[1:23:41] time
[1:23:45] so all these details all these arguments
[1:23:48] it's a
[1:23:50] distraction pull yourself away from
[1:23:52] those distractions and it's time to to
[1:23:54] refocus remember I preached that here I
[1:23:57] think focus on the right thing people's
[1:24:00] people's eyes when you're looking at one
[1:24:02] thing that's the that's what's in Focus
[1:24:04] but when you're looking at something
[1:24:06] Beyond this becomes blurry and that
[1:24:09] comes in focus when you're looking at
[1:24:10] this here what's in front of you that
[1:24:12] becomes in focus and everything else is
[1:24:14] blurry let us focus on the word and
[1:24:16] everything else is obscured
[1:24:19] amen hallelujah so when we have that
[1:24:22] concentration
[1:24:24] that we focus on him let let's stand to
[1:24:26] our feet this
[1:24:29] morning
[1:24:31] so but the the whole point is missed
[1:24:34] because of all these details that are
[1:24:37] distractions in the presence of the Lord
[1:24:40] is missed see when we're thinking about
[1:24:42] something else we don't recognize when
[1:24:44] the
[1:24:45] presence when the Lord is present with
[1:24:47] us and then we miss out on on things
[1:24:50] so
[1:24:53] so but not recognizing the presence of
[1:24:56] God when you are able to recognize the
[1:24:58] presence of
[1:24:59] God it and when you recognize that it it
[1:25:03] releases the power to heal and whatever
[1:25:06] you have need of it will release the
[1:25:07] power to open your eyes to recognize him
[1:25:10] oh or blind your eyes so you'll never
[1:25:14] recognize him what opens the eyes of one
[1:25:17] closes the eyes of the
[1:25:19] unbeliever
[1:25:23] amen just want to read this real quick
[1:25:26] he says I tell you friends just because
[1:25:27] that we are members of the church or
[1:25:29] something like that that doesn't mean
[1:25:30] too much to us you better buckle up that
[1:25:32] armor you better take that whole word of
[1:25:35] God and hold on to it and quit this
[1:25:36] Hollywood acting out
[1:25:40] here he's he's talking about saying
[1:25:42] saying that you're a Christian and not
[1:25:44] acting like a
[1:25:46] Christian you know you're putting on a
[1:25:48] front to people saying that you're one
[1:25:51] thing but you're a devil on the
[1:25:52] inside you that's that's pretty much
[1:25:55] what he's saying stop this Hollywood
[1:25:58] acting but get real get sincere be
[1:26:01] genuine
[1:26:03] amen so he's saying quit this Hollywood
[1:26:06] acting around here it's got right into
[1:26:08] the church and it's a shame and this was
[1:26:10] way back I I can't even remember what
[1:26:12] year it was but it was back in the
[1:26:14] 60s so that was a long time
[1:26:16] ago I wasn't alive then don't don't let
[1:26:20] the beard deceive you just because it's
[1:26:22] gray doesn't mean I was alive back then
[1:26:25] so he says' but Hollywood glares just
[1:26:28] makes a bright light and the church
[1:26:30] today is trying to compare with
[1:26:33] Hollywood the church is competing with
[1:26:35] Hollywood because why we have these
[1:26:38] charismatic preachers out there right
[1:26:41] and and I'm not saying anything against
[1:26:42] it some people need that some people
[1:26:44] like that but then it becomes that they
[1:26:47] don't want to hear somebody else because
[1:26:51] they're not as entertaining they're
[1:26:53] looking for the entertain tainment
[1:26:54] Factor well you've got to scream and
[1:26:56] shout you've got to run the aisles
[1:26:58] you've got to do this
[1:26:59] you've all these different things that
[1:27:02] uh people think these ministers are are
[1:27:04] are popular for now I'm not criticizing
[1:27:07] the ministers understand what I'm saying
[1:27:09] is that the level that they are people
[1:27:13] cling to certain
[1:27:16] personalities you can't cling to just
[1:27:18] because they they run and Shout what's
[1:27:21] the message that's coming across
[1:27:24] that's what we need to look at what what
[1:27:26] are we looking at for every person right
[1:27:29] we are looking at the Spirit behind
[1:27:33] it so don't get caught up into into
[1:27:36] these into these preachers and and
[1:27:37] they're good and they're good I'm like I
[1:27:39] said I'm not coming against the the
[1:27:41] preachers I'm saying that people hold on
[1:27:42] to that entertainment value and now it's
[1:27:44] a competition with Hollywood okay
[1:27:47] because you've got to meet it or beat
[1:27:51] it you understand what I mean is how
[1:27:54] ollywood they'll make a movie they they
[1:27:56] made action movies if if you go way back
[1:27:58] to Charlie
[1:28:00] Chapman I don't know if you know the
[1:28:02] name but there's no words it's just
[1:28:05] music and he's just doing silly stuff
[1:28:08] okay it's like slapick humor it doesn't
[1:28:10] make sense he just does things and
[1:28:12] people thought it was funny back then
[1:28:14] some people think it's funny now they're
[1:28:17] mainly laughing at black and white but
[1:28:19] uh but through the years they have uh
[1:28:25] developed uh what's a word that I'm
[1:28:27] looking for the
[1:28:28] graphics they developed these uh there's
[1:28:31] a word that I'm looking for if somebody
[1:28:33] knows it help me out you're welcome to
[1:28:34] blur it out but it's like the graphics
[1:28:37] uh when they do things like Steven
[1:28:41] Spielberg with uh Star Wars years ago
[1:28:43] that that was something with the with
[1:28:45] the
[1:28:46] effects yeah what yeah the the effects
[1:28:49] that they make and special effects
[1:28:51] that's that's the word I was looking for
[1:28:53] and they've just grown and learned how
[1:28:55] to do it better so what they do is all
[1:28:58] these action movies they've got to meet
[1:29:00] it the latest uh Hollywood box off his H
[1:29:04] you got to meet it to that to where
[1:29:07] people would and it's like all the same
[1:29:09] line you know I remember Rambo Commando
[1:29:12] and all those all those dumb
[1:29:15] movies they had like the same Baseline
[1:29:18] somebody uh they they get uh something
[1:29:21] happens they get kicked out somewhere
[1:29:23] and the whole Army against them and they
[1:29:25] they grab a gun and they grab a few
[1:29:26] people and they're the only ones you
[1:29:28] know they're blasting all these guns and
[1:29:30] and uh they're the only ones left alive
[1:29:32] you know they're the hero of the story
[1:29:34] and there are so many movies out there
[1:29:36] like that but it's how much gunfire is
[1:29:38] in it how much different effects are in
[1:29:40] it so you see what I mean I'm I'm I'm
[1:29:43] trying to give that comparison of
[1:29:45] Hollywood they try to meet that last
[1:29:47] movie and then they have to beat it for
[1:29:49] people to watch
[1:29:51] it because it's got to be better than
[1:29:53] the last last one and people get stuck
[1:29:55] in that rut of ministers because or the
[1:29:58] ministering of the word because they
[1:30:00] they have to have that charismatic they
[1:30:02] have to have that entertainment
[1:30:06] value preaching the word is not
[1:30:10] entertainment preaching the word is life
[1:30:13] and
[1:30:16] death so when he's comparing
[1:30:19] Hollywood this is this is something
[1:30:21] serious to me when he's making that
[1:30:23] comparison that's something
[1:30:26] serious so but what what he's saying is
[1:30:29] quit acting like them quit trying to be
[1:30:31] like Hollywood it doesn't matter the
[1:30:33] great building you have right it doesn't
[1:30:36] how much it doesn't matter how much
[1:30:37] money what what vehicle the pastor's
[1:30:39] driving he's driving out of necessity
[1:30:41] and because they got another one coming
[1:30:43] I always call that vehicle an apartment
[1:30:44] on Wheels this just a big
[1:30:47] boy there's a lot of room in
[1:30:50] there so you understand what I mean
[1:30:54] yes so he's saying it's it's got right
[1:30:58] to the church and it's a shame but
[1:30:59] Hollywood glares just makes a bright
[1:31:00] light and the church today is trying to
[1:31:02] compare with Hollywood Christ is not
[1:31:04] Hollywood Christ is in the
[1:31:06] individual praise the
[1:31:08] Lord Hollywood glares while the gospel
[1:31:11] glows with humility God isn't in these
[1:31:13] great fine fancy places and all this
[1:31:15] stuff that we see he comes in humility
[1:31:17] in the form of meekness and gentleness
[1:31:19] passed right through and if you are
[1:31:21] acquainted with the
[1:31:22] word then you'll see it but if you're
[1:31:25] not acquainted with the word it's just
[1:31:27] going to go right by you're not going to
[1:31:29] see
[1:31:30] it oh my that's about where
[1:31:36] is just want to
[1:31:38] ask you might not physically have an
[1:31:40] alabaster box but I'm just speaking
[1:31:43] metaphorically you know if you had an
[1:31:45] alabaster box what would be in
[1:31:49] it we read through the scriptures of
[1:31:52] what uh this this siner Mary had in her
[1:31:57] alabaster box that it was the finest
[1:31:59] ointment it was the the finest that she
[1:32:02] sacrificed everything she had so I want
[1:32:05] to ask you what do you bring I'm I'm not
[1:32:07] one to tailor messages for for holidays
[1:32:10] and things but we know Christmas is
[1:32:11] coming and people are thinking about
[1:32:13] gifts but I'm not worried about
[1:32:14] Christmas I'm worried about what gift
[1:32:16] you're going to bring the
[1:32:19] Lord what are you going to bring in that
[1:32:21] Alabaster Box what is it is it
[1:32:25] worldliness is it sincerity is it truth
[1:32:29] because he even spoke in his word that
[1:32:32] if we are coming to worship him that we
[1:32:34] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:32:37] if if there's nothing genuine then we're
[1:32:39] not coming the right way in that I could
[1:32:42] say that you're worshiping
[1:32:44] wrong other than that you worship how
[1:32:47] the Lord lead you to worship how you
[1:32:49] feel in your heart that you do a good
[1:32:51] work unto the Lord
[1:32:56] so I just want to ask you know uh just
[1:32:58] kind of lay it out there that some
[1:32:59] people will say I've I I've heard the
[1:33:02] situation that uh if if if God doesn't
[1:33:07] I'm leaving it out there I need healing
[1:33:09] and if God doesn't heal me then I'm not
[1:33:11] going to serve the Lord
[1:33:13] anymore our walk with the Lord is not
[1:33:16] contingent on whether he heals us or
[1:33:19] not our relationship with him is I love
[1:33:24] him why because he first loved me praise
[1:33:28] the Lord Heavenly
[1:33:30] Father Lord if there's any that has a
[1:33:33] need if this message has struck somebody
[1:33:35] today just pray that you would be in
[1:33:37] their heart and their spirit and their
[1:33:38] soul that it would just give a press of
[1:33:41] what you want them to do oh Lord that
[1:33:43] they would give themselves over more to
[1:33:45] you if they were just halfway if they're
[1:33:48] weighing uh on the fence not sure which
[1:33:51] way to go Lord we just pray that you
[1:33:53] your spirit would just come and and make
[1:33:55] it real to them just come and and set
[1:33:58] that genuine love dove Spirit upon them
[1:34:00] oh father that they would surrender
[1:34:02] their life to you oh god father we think
[1:34:04] of Revival people say Revival is done
[1:34:06] and over with there are no more revivals
[1:34:08] but Lord we'd understand Revival to be a
[1:34:11] a Reviving of something that we already
[1:34:13] have there might not be a group Revival
[1:34:16] or or something uh but we've been taught
[1:34:18] that there's no organization Revival but
[1:34:20] Lord there is still an individual
[1:34:22] Revival and if there's somebody that has
[1:34:25] need of a Revival today an individual
[1:34:27] Revival with you I just pray that they
[1:34:29] would let themselves go that they would
[1:34:31] open that Alabaster Box and bring that
[1:34:33] sacrifice before you oh God bring that
[1:34:35] pre very precious ointment before you oh
[1:34:37] God and anoint you just surrendering
