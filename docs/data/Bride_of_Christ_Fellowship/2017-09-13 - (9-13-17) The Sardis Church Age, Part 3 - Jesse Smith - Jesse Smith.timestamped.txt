[20:11] we have three baptisms on Sunday was a
[20:13] wonderful time and Lord I make plans
[20:16] with all three of them to get back and
[20:18] do some Bible studies and so we're
[20:21] trying to do that by the grace of the
[20:22] Lord one of those Bible studies started
[20:25] about a year ago after putting Austin's
[20:27] baptism on face book and then this woman
[20:30] said I want to be baptized in water like
[20:33] that so we started the Bible study in
[20:34] fact we finally baptized her and then
[20:36] two other people in the name of Lord
[20:37] Jesus on Sunday night that was a real
[20:39] blessing so just if you would keep those
[20:41] families and prayer they're all from
[20:42] Copley so if you think about it when you
[20:45] pray please pray for the Copley families
[20:46] that God would add them to the message
[20:49] and God's calling for their life so
[20:53] let's take our Bibles here tonight it's
[20:54] go to Revelation chapter 3 look at verse
[20:56] 2 and 3 tonight revelation three two and
[21:00] three we're looking at the Sardis church
[21:01] age part three I realize I'm almost
[21:05] through this book on my own page 259 so
[21:08] to make it a good progress by God's
[21:10] grace
[21:10] and I love this book I love going to
[21:12] this book and looking forward to
[21:14] tonight's message by God's grace let me
[21:17] set a timer here so I don't go to too
[21:21] long here
[21:23] alright revelation 3 verse 2 revelation
[21:29] 3 verse 2 we'll start there read verses
[21:32] 2 & 3 verse 2
[21:36] let's read verse 2 together and I'll
[21:38] read verse 3 verse 3 is kind of long
[21:39] let's read verse 2 on three one two
[21:42] three be watchful and strengthen the
[21:45] things which remain that are ready to
[21:47] die for I have not found thy works
[21:50] perfect before God now read verse 3
[21:53] remember therefore how thou hast
[21:56] received and heard and hold fast and
[21:59] repent if therefore thou shalt not watch
[22:02] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[22:05] shalt not know what hour I will come
[22:08] upon thee he-man let's have word of
[22:10] Prayer that's God to minister to our
[22:11] hearts tonight through the word of God
[22:13] Lord in heaven again we pray Lord our
[22:16] third time praying Lord God this is a
[22:18] house of prayer Lord God we pray again
[22:20] Lord speak to us through thy word Lord
[22:24] when I read the quote where your prophet
[22:26] said after Jesus resurrected he wasn't
[22:29] they didn't understand all of his
[22:30] preaching but when he broke the bread
[22:33] Lord as he did before his crucifixion it
[22:36] opened the disciples eyes and they knew
[22:39] it was Jesus and Lord many times Lord
[22:42] maybe we don't catch everything during
[22:46] the preaching but Lord may do something
[22:48] tonight through the preaching and
[22:49] through just the act of the Holy Spirit
[22:51] that would let us know your presence is
[22:53] so near tonight Lord God we love you
[22:56] Lord and we want to see you in our Mitz
[22:58] Lord God and Lord we know it's you Lord
[23:00] that speaks and it burns our hearts Lord
[23:03] as the Cleophus and his friends said did
[23:05] not our hearts burn as he talked with us
[23:08] along the way talked to our hearts
[23:09] tonight Lord and let our hearts be
[23:11] sensitive to what your spirits saying
[23:13] father bless our efforts Lord and now I
[23:16] do pray Lord for those three souls I'd
[23:17] forgotten about those souls already this
[23:20] week such a busy and stressful week
[23:22] where father I do now pray for them
[23:24] thus my efforts Lord God to keep in
[23:26] touch with them and their efforts as
[23:28] well may we continue those Bible studies
[23:30] and may souls be one for your kingdom in
[23:32] Jesus Christ's name in every said Amen
[23:36] god bless you to be in season praise God
[23:39] [Music]
[23:46] all right so let's look at the Sardis
[23:49] church age tonight by God's grace we'll
[23:54] get as far as we can here by the grace
[23:56] of the Lord now look I do have slides so
[23:58] put all these quotes on here so whenever
[24:01] switch over no switch over God's grace
[24:08] [Music]
[24:15] all right so let's look at Part three
[24:17] tonight and trust you're enjoying the
[24:21] word of the Lord here I'm a preacher not
[24:23] on fear lately so it's kind of
[24:25] interesting just kind a little different
[24:26] to get back to the Sardis church age so
[24:29] we're thankful we read our text I didn't
[24:30] reverse one but we read two and three
[24:32] tonight we're looking at the warning of
[24:35] finishing verse one and verse two we've
[24:39] gone through I've we preached the
[24:40] salutation from Jesus right he says I'm
[24:43] the one who has the seven stars the
[24:46] seven spirits of God and we preached the
[24:48] denunciation how he said ah you have a
[24:52] name that you live us but our dead and
[24:54] we went through that on how this age
[24:56] labored in denomination for the RAM said
[24:59] if there was ever an age with
[25:00] denominational zeal it was this church
[25:02] age which is a sad thing so let's just
[25:05] go through this here will hopefully be
[25:06] done about an hour by God's grace
[25:08] revelation 3 verse 2 jesus said be
[25:11] watchful and strengthen the things which
[25:12] remain that are ready to die for I have
[25:16] not found that works perfect before God
[25:18] what a statement there that Jesus would
[25:21] tell the church age your works aren't
[25:23] perfect in other words they're not
[25:24] fulfilled what a statement
[25:26] we don't want Jesus to say that to us do
[25:28] we we don't want Jesus say that we want
[25:30] to do all the will of God that God has
[25:33] planned for us we don't want to fall
[25:35] short of that we want to do something
[25:36] for for the keen
[25:38] of God we want to know exactly what were
[25:40] to do praise God I am said I wish it
[25:43] could be said that the sardian age was a
[25:45] restoration instead of a rest rest grabs
[25:48] a Reformation but I cannot say that the
[25:51] word is not called a restoration but
[25:53] certainly calls it a Reformation had it
[25:56] been a restoration the age would have
[25:58] been another Pentecostal age but it was
[26:01] not the best that could be said of it
[26:04] was strengthen that which remains that
[26:07] is ready to die there was something
[26:10] missing ma yes there certainly was this
[26:13] age had justification but it missed
[26:15] sanctification and the baptism of the
[26:18] Holy Ghost I'm gonna say a little bit
[26:19] more on that in a little bit that's
[26:21] quite a statement to say that this age
[26:23] add justification but miss
[26:25] sanctification here's why that's a
[26:26] statement many of these men died for
[26:29] their faith I know Martin Luther didn't
[26:31] but many of the Reformers they gave
[26:34] their lives at the stake and yet Church
[26:37] it's hard to wrap our minds around this
[26:39] yet they weren't fully sanctified can
[26:43] you imagine that you could be a martyr
[26:44] burning the stake and not fully be
[26:47] sanctified that's quite a statement from
[26:50] the prophet of God but he's God's
[26:52] messenger to the hour and I will show
[26:54] you a few examples I will remind you of
[26:55] some of those examples so the Prophet
[26:58] says they had this age Sardis age had
[27:00] Reformation which was justification that
[27:03] means sanctification Wesley's age was
[27:05] also Reformation it wasn't a true
[27:08] restoration of the baptism of the Holy
[27:11] Ghost and so that's what we see here I
[27:14] think I got yeah I just have Martin
[27:15] Luther's life on there okay that's all I
[27:17] had
[27:17] oh do i Wesley - okay I'm looking at my
[27:19] slides okay then there's brother
[27:20] branham's okay so you have justification
[27:23] the Prophet said we wish we could say
[27:25] this was a restoration but Church the
[27:27] restoration is happening now amen it's
[27:30] happening right now how can you say that
[27:32] well I can say that because the gospel
[27:34] is still going to every nation and all
[27:36] those who receive it receive the full
[27:38] benefits of it praise God which we'll
[27:40] get to in just a little bit we want to
[27:41] share some things so referent
[27:43] justification sanctification under
[27:45] Philadelphia but now the true
[27:47] restoration is happening today and we
[27:50] can see that because brother Branham is
[27:52] industry was fully restored it had signs
[27:54] wonders miracles plus it had sacrifice
[27:57] it had character praise God and I also
[28:01] had godliness and it had everything his
[28:03] ministry had everything that the
[28:06] original Church age had praise God the
[28:08] st. Paul's Church age the fees and
[28:11] church age his ministry had all of it
[28:13] now it's trying to get that full
[28:14] ministry to the full Bride of Christ
[28:16] around the world that's what's happening
[28:18] now we're trying to get that full
[28:19] ministry to Akron to every USA every
[28:23] country must hear the gospel before
[28:25] Christ comes back amen and that's what's
[28:28] happening today by the grace of the Lord
[28:29] now the Prophet goes on to say that is
[28:32] what God's original plan was that is
[28:35] what they had at Pentecost they were
[28:36] justified they were sanctified and were
[28:38] filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to
[28:41] me the reason for being justified and
[28:43] sanctified is to the end that you might
[28:46] be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is
[28:50] the reason that there's a church it is
[28:52] the temple of God filled with God even
[28:55] the Holy Ghost the same spirit that was
[28:57] in Jesus while he was here on earth
[28:59] causing him to do the mighty works which
[29:02] he did came back up on the church of
[29:04] Pentecost so that they did the works
[29:07] that he did amen hallelujah this age
[29:10] should not have those works oh they had
[29:13] the written word now look at this but
[29:15] not the revealed Word aren't you glad
[29:16] you got the revealed word we've got the
[29:19] written and the revealed hallelujah oh
[29:21] my that's glorious this was the
[29:25] Reformation period but fear not little
[29:28] flock God said I'll restore and this
[29:31] reform was going to be the start of it
[29:32] he said he was going to according to his
[29:36] promise take the church back from the
[29:38] depth of Satan in the Dark Ages to the
[29:41] depth of God that they had at Pentecost
[29:44] and in the first few years of the six
[29:48] existence of the church Mendes statement
[29:52] Church I know there's not many of us
[29:54] here tonight but I hope we can
[29:55] understand this how tremendous of a
[29:58] statement this is we are supposed to
[30:00] have the depth of God they had in the
[30:04] book of Acts
[30:05] that's why brother branham said members
[30:06] dust saith the Lord the fullness of
[30:08] Pentecost will be in the bride and
[30:11] that's that's why we that's why we keep
[30:13] praying that's why I have a burden you
[30:15] know to keep praying and wanting to see
[30:17] more of God and preaching as hard as I
[30:18] can and living as close to God as I can
[30:20] because we're supposed to have a depth
[30:23] of God that goes beyond what Martin
[30:25] Luther had a mighty man of God Church a
[30:28] mighty man
[30:29] John Wesley who traveled hundreds of
[30:32] thousands of miles for the gospel
[30:33] brother Branham traveled hundreds of
[30:35] thousands maybe millions who knows but
[30:38] these men labored for the gospel and
[30:40] we're supposed to have that same depth
[30:41] that they had in the book of Acts my
[30:45] church that's just that's hot to me
[30:47] that's that's extremely humbling that my
[30:49] life should have the same depth they had
[30:51] and I want that life so I just added
[30:54] this word right here the death of God
[30:55] this is what we're talking about the
[30:57] depth of God and what did I do and I put
[30:59] that okay I put the same thing on there
[31:00] I'm sorry I didn't mean to put all those
[31:02] movements on there but the point was the
[31:05] depth of God back here was slowly lost
[31:07] right and then they had the depth of
[31:09] Satan right during the Middle Ages and
[31:12] then what's coming back to the depth of
[31:14] God and remember its restoration right
[31:18] its restoration so as we near closer to
[31:22] the rapture what's happening we should
[31:24] be getting closer to God we should see
[31:27] more signs like they saw at the
[31:29] beginning right so our as we approach
[31:32] there we should see more and more signs
[31:34] of what they had right here back at the
[31:35] beginning right more the truth of the
[31:38] word more sincerity more power more love
[31:41] right more revelation we should see
[31:43] these things by God's grace so does that
[31:45] help to see that this is the same death
[31:47] we had right here it started great here
[31:49] faded so great increase decrease
[31:54] increasing and this should be the full
[31:56] increase at the coming of the Lord now
[31:58] what is the depth of God number brother
[32:00] Branham told us he said it's Ephesians
[32:03] 3:18 the death of God is having Christ
[32:08] in us the hope of glory and remember
[32:11] when I preached on the love of God
[32:12] remember how I had four parts in
[32:13] Ephesians 3:18 it had a breath which was
[32:16] wide from east of the West it had
[32:18] length which was length of days days and
[32:21] generations it had depth which the Bible
[32:23] said was the depth of the wisdom of God
[32:25] and then it had height the Bible said
[32:28] God's love reaches to the heavens
[32:30] so remember wise virgins are wise to the
[32:34] will of God we're supposed to have the
[32:37] depth of God remember we're going back
[32:38] to the depth of God so the depth of God
[32:42] is the wisdom of God and that's what the
[32:44] Bible calls us wise virgins it's it's
[32:47] just absolutely perfect this Bible is
[32:49] sealed just so perfect
[32:52] if we got the Holy Spirit we can't make
[32:54] a mistake once at Amen because it's so
[32:56] it's so clear all this ties together the
[32:58] depth is the wisdom it's the with the
[33:01] with the will of God because remember
[33:02] Matthew 7 those who didn't do the will
[33:05] of God Jesus said I never knew you even
[33:08] though I had their miracles I never knew
[33:10] you because we must if we have the love
[33:11] of God we'll have the depth of the
[33:13] wisdom of God as well the will of God
[33:16] for our lives now I said be careful get
[33:19] this it says in the second verse that I
[33:22] read for I've not found thy works
[33:24] perfect before God do you know what the
[33:26] meaning of not perfect really is it is
[33:28] unfulfilled the age was an unfulfilled
[33:31] age it was just the start of getting
[33:34] back that is why said the Bible caught
[33:36] at Reformation not restoration it has
[33:39] started out in the doctrine of
[33:40] justification which meant salvation was
[33:43] all of God are you still thankful for
[33:45] justification glory my salvation is all
[33:47] of God praise the Lord now I'm almost
[33:51] getting to where I want to share a few
[33:52] things here okay Martin he's speaking of
[33:55] Martin Luther I skipped a few paragraphs
[33:56] here because I think we'd been over
[33:58] before he denounced the Pope it was
[34:00] wonderfully good as he started but God
[34:03] had said fifteen hundred years before he
[34:08] said Luther you are going to start
[34:10] things but your age will see it all
[34:13] unfulfilled I'm leaving that to the
[34:16] later amen hallelujah our God reigneth
[34:18] he knows the end from the beginning
[34:20] yes Luther was his messenger it didn't
[34:22] look like it as we examine the flaws and
[34:25] we'll get to the flaws in just a moment
[34:26] but there was a man called Jonah he had
[34:29] flaws in his life too he was a prophet
[34:32] you and I might not want to say so on
[34:35] the basis of how he acted remember he
[34:39] got really mad with God he got mad with
[34:41] God for being merciful to the Gentiles
[34:44] but God knows them that are his and he
[34:47] had his way just as did with Jonah he
[34:50] had his way with Luther that age and he
[34:51] will have his way until the consummation
[34:54] and then brother Graham tells the story
[34:57] of the Lutheran seminary out west that
[34:58] was seeking gifts remember that story
[34:59] brother Branham said that the seminary
[35:03] had a farm you know and the students
[35:05] would work on the farm at the seminary
[35:06] to make money for their tuition he said
[35:09] but the the president of the seminary
[35:10] found a book called the gifts of the
[35:12] Spirit and it's written by a man out of
[35:14] California he said we want the gifts of
[35:16] the Spirit so the president flew some
[35:18] students out with him to California and
[35:22] went to the author and said teach us
[35:23] about the gifts of the Spirit the man
[35:25] said we don't have them I just wrote a
[35:26] book on them jerk that's all we need we
[35:29] need not just to talk about him we need
[35:31] to have them praise God and I'm willing
[35:33] to wait because I know it's the promise
[35:35] of this hour but I don't know how God's
[35:36] gonna bring it to pass in other words I
[35:38] don't know if God's gonna raise up a nun
[35:39] another generation that will pray for
[35:41] the gifts of the Spirit or that that
[35:42] will make more dedication I don't know
[35:44] but one thing I know is God said he's
[35:46] gonna have the fullness of the Spirit in
[35:47] this bride and I just got to be willing
[35:50] to wait and I've got to be willing to
[35:51] sacrifice I've got to be willing to do
[35:53] my part to see more of God in the church
[35:55] so the point and then the the president
[35:59] called brother Branham and said brother
[36:00] Branham you didn't write a book on it
[36:02] but we've seen the gifts operate in your
[36:04] ministry and so brother they asked
[36:07] brother brother man says yes sir
[36:09] he said they do operate and so we asked
[36:11] brother Branham he's the brother branham
[36:13] we went the Holy Ghost he said do we
[36:14] have the Holy Ghost and mother Ram said
[36:16] potentially you have the Holy Ghost
[36:17] remember that and he said no what do you
[36:20] mean and brother have looked out at the
[36:22] field out there at their seminary and he
[36:23] said he said I'll give them an
[36:25] illustration they can understand
[36:26] remember that brother Ram said he said a
[36:30] man went out in a field one time and he
[36:31] planted all his corn and he said little
[36:33] tassels sprouted up and the man walked
[36:35] out in the in the the summertime Sun and
[36:38] said praise God for my field of corn and
[36:40] when I asked the president he said did
[36:43] the man have corn field yet and the
[36:46] price
[36:46] said well in one way he did and brother
[36:48] Ram said potentially he had corn
[36:51] he said that's you Lutheran's with the
[36:54] blade sprung up right
[36:56] not even knee Bhatt not even knee-high
[36:58] by the fourth of July just the blade
[37:00] sprung up not even the tassel brother
[37:02] Ram said and so here's the illustration
[37:04] brother Ram gives the blade had just
[37:07] sprung up but he told the Lutheran
[37:08] Church you're the blade right the tassel
[37:12] was Wesley brother Ram said then
[37:14] everybody thought it was Siva brother
[37:15] Ram said there's no there's another
[37:16] stage there's the chaff stage and he
[37:20] said the chaff stage protects the seed
[37:22] until it releases the seed and brother
[37:25] Ram said the Pentecostal church
[37:26] protected the message of the hour and
[37:28] then it pulled away and now we have seed
[37:31] time amen we're just a true seed of God
[37:34] is being preached to the people hey I
[37:36] love you all the Pentecostals traditions
[37:40] and men should be taken out and we
[37:42] should have just seed word being
[37:43] preached to the church it's exactly
[37:45] right and so it goes Luther Wesley Azusa
[37:48] message or Branham you could say I
[37:50] forget the name of the man who started
[37:52] that movement
[37:53] anybody remember I can't remember
[37:56] forgive me but I could have put his name
[37:58] on there but I forgot his name but just
[37:59] so you know I just wanted to put those
[38:00] up there it's the same thing I could put
[38:02] Branham and other guys name I forget his
[38:04] name he was we only had one I forget his
[38:05] name
[38:06] a black man really wonderful man I think
[38:08] he prayed six or eight hours a day
[38:10] before their revival six or eight hours
[38:12] a day that's a real soldier the cross
[38:15] now whatever it is and the way that it
[38:19] was done was by God's perfect will and
[38:21] programming the Lutheran's had the Holy
[38:24] Ghost potentially under justification
[38:27] the Methodists had a potential in a
[38:29] saint vacation and today has brought
[38:30] back a restoration the Holy Ghost is
[38:33] here now here's what I want to say I
[38:36] want to say this all along because this
[38:37] is if you really read Martin and the
[38:40] study Martin Luther's life like I just
[38:41] read the I just read the Britannica
[38:43] article that's a short article but
[38:45] there's journals of Martin Luther's life
[38:47] I mean he wrote journals and he this guy
[38:49] was a soldier of the cross but let me I
[38:52] just want to say this we're not exalting
[38:54] ourselves above Martin Luther or any
[38:57] reformer I just want you to know that
[38:59] many were martyrs and tireless workers
[39:01] and that can you say men
[39:03] we're not exalting ourselves they could
[39:06] only live as high as the word that they
[39:08] received right and we're not exalting
[39:11] ourselves but we have to live higher
[39:14] because more words been revealed to the
[39:16] books been revealed he had one
[39:18] revelation right basically one
[39:20] revelation did you know Martin I think
[39:24] you know this Martin Luther wrote that
[39:26] the Jews were guilty of crucifying
[39:28] Christ and it caused many Jews to be
[39:29] killed did you know that that's in the
[39:31] history of the Britannica he didn't have
[39:35] the fifth seal revelation because it
[39:36] wasn't time for the fifth seal you three
[39:38] revealed yet remember he started his
[39:42] words the peasants took his words and
[39:44] they started a peasant war and thousands
[39:48] of peasants were slain trying to destroy
[39:50] the government of that hour I don't
[39:53] remember which one it was and only it
[39:55] was wrong but anyways thousands lost
[39:58] their lives and brother bran picks that
[40:00] up in history and says see he was a
[40:02] mighty mighty man of God and when
[40:04] anointed but he made mistakes that
[40:07] sanctification would not have made and
[40:09] that's true but yet church there was
[40:11] many people that were mighty martyrs in
[40:14] that time but yet they couldn't live
[40:17] above now so how do you explain the I
[40:20] explained like this the Holy Ghost so
[40:22] anointed them in their justification in
[40:23] their minds that they were able to be a
[40:25] martyr for Christ but yet they made
[40:28] numerous mistakes that a sanctified
[40:31] person would not have made I've read a
[40:35] little bit now on John Wesley's life did
[40:37] you know there was whispers around him
[40:39] now I'm not saying anything bad about
[40:40] him but there's whispers about some some
[40:43] relationships he had outside of his wife
[40:46] that there may have been some were
[40:47] certain unfaithful relationship or
[40:49] something like that perhaps like
[40:51] flirting or something like that I don't
[40:52] know what but from what I've read and
[40:54] this is a guest well-known with those
[40:56] who are in the Wesleyan Church they're
[40:58] aware of this so I'm just letting you
[41:01] know these were mighty men of God when
[41:03] anointed but when that anointing left
[41:05] church they weren't sealed on the soul
[41:07] okay they weren't seen on the soul to
[41:09] live the full life like they ought to
[41:11] lived
[41:13] you know Martin Luther Jews diamond
[41:16] peasants dying but yet look at the labor
[41:20] Martin Luther wrote at least ten books
[41:22] how many books have I written none I
[41:23] wanted to start one this summer I didn't
[41:25] get done oh I told you that I want to
[41:27] get to it later but I've already got a
[41:28] good outline for it and whenever I get
[41:30] my videos done my revelation videos I
[41:31] want to move on to that ten books and
[41:34] church he translated the entire Bible
[41:38] into German of the Holy Spirit under
[41:41] justification I don't know if you knew
[41:44] this did you know this that brother
[41:46] Murphy Wang from China did you know this
[41:48] he translated the entire King James into
[41:50] Chinese and he's alive today he's a
[41:52] missionary today and he they're seeing
[41:54] such underground revival in China for
[41:57] the message Church we got modern-day
[42:00] Martin Luther's but listen he's living a
[42:02] holier life if you understand what I'm
[42:04] saying like he's got the seal the Holy
[42:06] Ghost where he don't cause people to die
[42:07] you understand he don't cause people to
[42:10] to be killed he don't put the hate on
[42:12] Jews you understand and did you know
[42:15] Martin Luther the rowdism Luther and the
[42:19] other reformers they drank alcohol and
[42:20] their missteps cost lives there was room
[42:24] for sanctification there's quotes you
[42:26] can pull up right on Martin Luther's
[42:27] websites you know people that follow him
[42:29] he would talk about if you want good
[42:31] sleep drink some beer before you go to
[42:34] bed and different things like that he
[42:35] like he was he was he just wasn't
[42:38] sanctified all the way now but yet many
[42:43] men like him wrote ten books say many
[42:46] souls I mean labored we'd say in many
[42:49] ways more than we do in many ways but
[42:52] yet the same thing with David he killed
[42:54] Goliath and killed all these men but
[42:56] then he killed a man and committed
[42:57] adultery with another man's life you see
[43:00] that's the power of the anointing you
[43:03] know that he had it was a powerful 90
[43:05] but when it left he didn't have that
[43:06] seal there and so he did things that I'm
[43:09] born again person would not do praise
[43:12] the Lord everybody see that and we're
[43:14] not any better but we just have access
[43:17] to more power and glory and we will do
[43:20] all the works that God has ordained us
[43:22] to do right remember in Ephesians 2:10
[43:25] all the
[43:26] of God were RT ordained and we just
[43:28] gotta walk in on my faith so we should
[43:31] expect our lives not to cause hate not
[43:33] to cause division that's to cause
[43:35] murders right not to cause flirting and
[43:38] and questionable relationships and
[43:40] things like that our lives should be so
[43:42] pure because we have a pure word Amen we
[43:45] have a greater word of Revelation that
[43:47] we have amen because like I said on
[43:50] Sunday on Sunday member on Sunday night
[43:53] we went over more about how the
[43:55] disciples had to be sanctified remember
[43:58] you and I I just placed myself I guess
[43:59] I'm this compared to Peter I'm lower
[44:02] than that I'm this compared to any of
[44:05] those apostles were nothing but God left
[44:07] us those examples in there so that we
[44:09] can examine ourselves and live a
[44:11] justified life a sanctified life and
[44:14] have the power of the Holy Spirit and be
[44:17] is adopted as we can whether brother
[44:18] Branham said he said you can be an
[44:20] adopted farmer I'm paraphrasing he said
[44:22] positionally placed he said you can be
[44:24] positioned place housewife you can be
[44:26] positionally placed doctor or farmer or
[44:29] a factory worker he said or preacher we
[44:32] can be positionally placed but our lives
[44:34] should be so pure we should have such a
[44:36] holiness our walk should say holy holy
[44:39] holy Lord God Almighty literally people
[44:43] should see our walk and they should
[44:45] literally sense just a holiness about
[44:47] our lives it should be so holy does that
[44:50] make sense those are the examples I want
[44:51] to give there because I just you know
[44:53] doing a quick quote search on Martin
[44:55] Luther and and I just saw more and more
[44:57] how how there's times with anointing
[45:00] left he needed sanctification in certain
[45:02] areas but I'm not saying like I'm not
[45:04] saying we're better I'm just saying more
[45:05] powers been given to us we should live a
[45:07] fully sanctified life and Holy Ghost
[45:11] filled life we should not cause murders
[45:14] like I said they're not should be should
[45:16] not be questions about our relationships
[45:17] and all these things our lives should
[45:20] look like Christ it should be the depth
[45:22] of God's love in our lives the depth of
[45:25] it the wisdom on how to follow the Lord
[45:28] Jesus Christ the depth of it because
[45:31] we're going back to the depth of God
[45:33] amen
[45:34] right we're going back to the beginning
[45:35] the depths of God I got a few more
[45:38] slides here let me go back to the second
[45:40] see how many I got I'm at 216 okay
[45:44] 2 4 6 10 12 14 you got time 16 18 20 22
[45:54] 24 I got 24 do we have time for 24 I
[45:56] don't know I forget he says okay if we
[46:00] can't rather I just did you know I don't
[46:05] wanna go maybe I should go a little
[46:06] faster but but I think you understand
[46:08] what I'm saying
[46:08] we're not exalting ourselves but we
[46:11] should be able to look at someone's life
[46:12] and say my and not in judgment but let's
[46:15] say judging ourselves we should never
[46:18] say my we should live a higher life err
[46:20] we should be able to see the power of
[46:22] God the power of God can help us live a
[46:24] little bit higher than that I mean or
[46:26] another word and sometimes a lot higher
[46:28] than that a lot higher than a lot of our
[46:31] friends and co-workers right and not to
[46:34] judge them but in church it ought to
[46:35] give us a pity a divine pity of love for
[46:38] their soul today I was uh I was praying
[46:42] over and weeping I was crying and
[46:44] pleading for some of the souls I set up
[46:46] a reunion for our state football
[46:49] championship team I set it up at the end
[46:52] of October and I'm inviting everybody
[46:54] and at the end I'm gonna have a guest
[46:56] speaker I'm working with some different
[46:58] people and I'm gonna try to at the end
[47:00] of my keynote event about how to be a
[47:03] champion in life because we're champions
[47:05] on football but who cares about football
[47:07] who cares anymore it's just nonsense but
[47:11] my whole point of doing this reunion was
[47:14] at the end so I can bring Christ to them
[47:15] and Church of God knows my heart I'm on
[47:17] my knees in my my closet this at this
[47:20] evening before church crying and weeping
[47:22] saying god save anyone on this I have
[47:24] this team picture on my phone save
[47:26] somebody on this team so that Souls
[47:30] don't go to hell we should have such a
[47:32] divine pity to win souls brother Graham
[47:34] said if you can't do nothing else
[47:35] he said win one soul to Christ praise
[47:38] God but have said the worst thing you
[47:39] can do is not try and do nothing we got
[47:43] to try to do something I'm willing to
[47:45] pour out myself there's gonna be a
[47:46] three-hour event I'm willing to pour out
[47:48] my money whatever I can do to try to
[47:50] give these guys one opportunity to hear
[47:52] one more time about Jesus Christ
[47:54] I never know if I ever have a chance
[47:55] again one of my teammates have already
[47:57] died he died actually shortly after high
[47:59] school he died at 21 years old from
[48:02] leukemia and so my heart's been burden
[48:04] lately I've been one just wanting to win
[48:06] souls I just want to see someone I just
[48:07] want to push somebody if all's they can
[48:09] be is a lot a foolish virgin then God
[48:11] help him to be foolish virgin praise God
[48:13] to be inversión to live all that they
[48:15] know with the Word of God so I want you
[48:18] to know I'm trying to everything I can
[48:19] to win any soul to the kingdom of God
[48:23] jesus said be watchful and strengthen
[48:26] the things which remain that are ready
[48:28] to die now the idea is expressed in
[48:30] these two words watchful and strengthen
[48:31] are these here's the idea to watch
[48:35] contains not only the idea of being
[48:37] awake but to be alert to be otherwise
[48:41] insinuates danger and loss to strengthen
[48:46] means more than just to give strength it
[48:48] means to fix and establish for
[48:50] permanency I like that permanency don't
[48:54] you want to be a permanent Christian
[48:55] don't you want your testimony to be
[48:57] permanent well brother Jes gave up after
[49:00] 11 years of pastoring he just gave up no
[49:03] I want to be permanent by calling on God
[49:05] on to be a permanent fixture like the
[49:07] Bible said I love this the Bible said if
[49:09] you're a Holy Ghost overcomer you're a
[49:11] pillar in the house of God think about a
[49:14] pillar at the White House that pillar is
[49:16] hardly gonna move unless somebody like
[49:17] bombs the White House or something like
[49:18] that that is always going to be a
[49:20] foundational piece upon that that that
[49:24] at that temple right or we say we're
[49:27] infrastructure whatever it may be that
[49:29] building it's always gonna be a
[49:31] permanent fixture and that's what the
[49:33] that's what brother ham said that's what
[49:34] strengthen means we're gonna be so
[49:36] strong we have a permanent part with
[49:37] playing with God amen
[49:39] we play our part we keep our position
[49:41] we're a permanent part of the family of
[49:43] God these two commands refer to what is
[49:46] left of the truth which itself is ready
[49:49] or about to die this expression of the
[49:52] Spirit comes before me as an
[49:54] illustration so here's his illustration
[49:56] about these two watchful and strengthen
[49:59] here's so this is the condition next
[50:02] it's about slaves to just give you an
[50:04] idea this is the condition that Luther's
[50:07] Church Asia was in
[50:08] a group of slaves in total bondage
[50:10] physically and morally have risen up and
[50:12] escaped from their captors indeed that
[50:14] is what Sardis means the escaped ones
[50:15] they are pursued and their great and
[50:18] glorious gains are all but lost and
[50:20] we'll stop right there that's what
[50:21] Martin Luther's age was they'd escaped
[50:24] from slavery but they got Egyptians on
[50:26] their tails yeah I can never see that
[50:28] it's a perfect type right of Israel
[50:30] coming out of Egypt right water blood
[50:32] spirit Red Sea wilderness Promised Land
[50:36] right it's a perfect example
[50:37] they left the the world of the the false
[50:41] Egyptian Roman Catholic Church system
[50:43] Anglican all that they've left that but
[50:45] now they're being pursued and they're
[50:48] being chased after that's what the
[50:50] Prophet says that's his illustration
[50:52] slaves that are free but now they're
[50:54] being pursued they've not been retaken
[50:57] so Luther and them wasn't weren't
[50:59] retaken but about all that can be said
[51:01] is that they have escaped not clean
[51:03] escape that some were according to the
[51:05] word they had lost much of their
[51:07] liberties now the Lord says you are
[51:08] potentially back in captivity see that
[51:11] you don't go back that's what he's
[51:12] saying to Luther's age you're out of it
[51:14] but don't go back all right couple more
[51:17] here oh that is the right time okay okay
[51:23] yeah all right I got my time confuse to
[51:26] keep from going back become alert and
[51:28] remain ever watchful concerning the
[51:30] things of your captivity or you will
[51:32] lose all strengthen yourself now and
[51:34] what you have left in such a manner as
[51:36] to permanently establish what you have
[51:38] and thus ensure against future loss this
[51:43] will be your opportunity to fulfill what
[51:45] you have not fulfilled but did they go
[51:48] on program said no sir they did not heed
[51:52] to the voice of the Spirit and another
[51:54] age went into captivity and so God
[51:56] raised up others who would carry out his
[51:58] will let's stop right there did Luther
[52:00] go into captivity
[52:01] no member of RAM said it was the
[52:03] generation after praise the Lord it
[52:06] wasn't Luther himself it was a
[52:08] generation after that denominated around
[52:11] Luther wrote their Lutheran Creed's and
[52:13] their catechisms like my wife went
[52:14] through the Catechism and everything and
[52:16] the confirmation remember that a few
[52:18] more few weeks ago it wasn't Luther
[52:21] was the second generation after him but
[52:24] he still needed sanctify we saw that God
[52:27] bypassed a Lutheran denomination as he
[52:29] has all others and they never came back
[52:31] God had to go on in a new age bring
[52:34] further truth and a little more
[52:36] restoration now we have completed that's
[52:40] the end if you look in your church age
[52:41] book when you get a chance we that's
[52:42] that's the end of the warning so we've
[52:44] done the agent messenger salutation
[52:45] denunciation now we've done the warning
[52:47] next time Lord willing we'll move into
[52:50] the judgment but not tonight I just want
[52:51] to close with a few more thoughts here
[52:53] and then I'll close with these slides
[52:56] they go kind of quick because I just I'm
[52:58] gonna state important quotes from the
[53:00] 1960 Sardis sermon you'll probably
[53:03] notice a lot of these quotes are from
[53:05] the church age book but I but I listened
[53:07] to intently I listened to the 1960s
[53:10] sermon and I've tried to inject the most
[53:13] important thoughts okay and I tell you
[53:15] as you know that church age book is so
[53:17] faithful to the sermons almost every
[53:19] major thought in the sermon is in that
[53:22] church age book that's why we love the
[53:24] church age book alright so these are
[53:28] some important quotes so on verse 1 I'm
[53:30] gonna read verse 1 so you got it here's
[53:32] an important quote brother Branham
[53:34] picked up this really good thought I
[53:36] don't know if you saw this before but
[53:37] it's the use of the name of Jesus during
[53:40] the seven church ages did you check this
[53:43] thought it's interesting here it is it's
[53:46] it's verse one know thy works that thou
[53:50] has a name that now liveth and aren't
[53:52] dead that's from the Sardis church age
[53:55] chapter three verse one so the word name
[53:58] so brother Branham picks up the word
[54:00] name I don't know if you ever caught
[54:01] this this was a beautiful thought the
[54:03] use of the name of Jesus during the
[54:05] seven church ages
[54:06] look what brother Adam said this is from
[54:07] the sermon I got different text so you
[54:09] can see it's just to give your mind a
[54:11] difference
[54:12] it's from the sermon not the church age
[54:14] but well the RAM raises I know your
[54:16] works that was the name that they'll
[54:17] live us and our dead so we're gonna
[54:19] focus on the word name he said turn over
[54:21] the next church age you find out but
[54:23] thou hast not denied my name
[54:26] so did you got your Bible he's talking
[54:28] about did you have your Bibles or let me
[54:29] pull it up here Revelation 3:8 I'm sorry
[54:32] I just think it would make it a little
[54:33] more sense what part me
[54:35] make a little more sense if I show it on
[54:37] here Revelation 3:8 I can just do it
[54:39] here real quick I got everybody trained
[54:41] to look at the screen now so I usually
[54:44] tell you if I want you to take your
[54:45] Bible out so forgive me so he's talking
[54:47] about in the church age after Sardis
[54:49] which is Philadelphia then Jesus says
[54:52] this thou hast not denied my name okay
[54:59] so in Sardis he said you have a name
[55:02] that you live but you're dead okay which
[55:05] you're organized he's talking to the
[55:07] whole church age not Luther Luther was
[55:08] alive you don't forgot but there they
[55:10] lived a name but were dead and now in
[55:13] the Philadelphia Church age brother
[55:14] Branham said you've not denied my name
[55:16] let's go back to that quote it's an
[55:18] interesting thought I don't know if he
[55:19] caught it I thought was a beautiful
[55:20] thought see now the following church age
[55:23] Philadelphia
[55:23] you've not denied my name but in this
[55:25] church the Sardis you have a name watch
[55:28] here now here's where as it is he
[55:29] injects his thought here I have a slide
[55:31] for next this church kept his name but
[55:33] this church kept his name this church
[55:36] kept his name in this church went
[55:37] through a dark age and there was nothing
[55:39] said about it when they come out to the
[55:41] life on this side the first little
[55:43] escape one when Luther pulled them out
[55:44] you have a name that you're live but
[55:46] you're dead now now what name do they
[55:48] use after they quit using Jesus name
[55:50] father son Holy Ghost and there ain't no
[55:53] such a thing it's a dead it's a dead
[55:55] theology I'm thankful I buried all those
[55:58] three individuals in the name of the
[56:00] Lord Jesus Christ I told him I said if
[56:02] you want me to say father only ghost I
[56:04] said I will I'll say this I'll say i
[56:06] baptize you name of the Father Son Holy
[56:07] Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[56:10] they all said we'll just do Lord Jesus
[56:11] Christ so see these people are taught
[56:15] the Trinity Church and it's so sad they
[56:16] don't even know what it is but thank God
[56:18] we know what it is amen and when it's
[56:21] really presented without all their
[56:22] Creed's they can see it without a
[56:24] problem
[56:24] just like you and I that's all I got
[56:27] hope that maybe one of these families
[56:29] will come in the message I'm hoping I'm
[56:31] not prophesy I'm probably saying aha I
[56:33] said I'm saying you know I prayed for
[56:34] and I'm hoping I don't know but I
[56:38] believe if God placed me there surely
[56:39] someone wants the message and that city
[56:41] of I think there was 50,000 I'm not sure
[56:44] I have last time I checked it I did a I
[56:47] did a community evaluation on it one
[56:49] time
[56:49] when I was in graduate school but I
[56:50] can't remember not how many but maybe
[56:52] 50,000 maybe 30,000
[56:54] somebody's gotta believe the message in
[56:56] there now here's the point brother I was
[56:57] talking about the name of Jesus Christ
[57:00] in the church ages if you look in
[57:02] chapter 2 verse 3 in Ephesus the Bible
[57:04] said you've had patience for my name's
[57:06] sake
[57:07] so Bella I'm saying they had the name of
[57:09] Jesus Christ in the first search age
[57:11] they used Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus
[57:13] Christ now in Samoa there's no mention
[57:15] you can look it up I looked it up I
[57:17] typed the name every time in the book of
[57:19] Revelation you're not going to find it
[57:20] in some urn in church ancient that means
[57:23] they were still using the name of Lord
[57:24] Jesus Christ Pergamos said thou holdest
[57:27] fast my name they still had the name of
[57:30] the Lord Jesus Christ dire tira there's
[57:32] no mention the 5th church age they had
[57:36] the name of Jesus but not the real life
[57:38] behind it right most of the age
[57:39] organized and so they were dead
[57:43] spiritually because they were had a name
[57:45] they live but weren't really alive to
[57:48] Christ
[57:48] now verse filled up on the Philadelphian
[57:51] church age you've not been not denied my
[57:53] name God started restoring the name of
[57:55] Jesus hallelujah
[57:57] and then there's no mention of the name
[57:59] in Laodicea remember there's overlapping
[58:02] so the program said Philadelphia's
[58:04] message overlaps to our age and so we
[58:07] have the name
[58:08] we've not denied the name of Jesus
[58:10] Christ glory alright now let me say let
[58:15] me see you next okay so in this quote
[58:19] you read the scripture again and then he
[58:20] basically rebukes the the Lutheran's he
[58:25] says he said what they do they put it
[58:27] right back in denomination again pot
[58:29] can't call kettle black so a Lutheran
[58:32] can't say oh you have horrible Catholic
[58:34] because they're doing the same thing
[58:35] they're both using Father Son Holy Ghost
[58:37] they're both using three God's the cut
[58:40] the pot can't call kettle black they're
[58:42] both black they're both using a false
[58:43] doctrine he said see cuz you're right
[58:46] back in it using the same Creed's and
[58:48] names and well Luther brought out many
[58:51] of the Catechism is everything else that
[58:52] the Catholic Church had and took up a
[58:53] name himself see they're both used in
[58:56] organizational names are both using the
[58:58] titles instead the name of Lord Jesus
[58:59] Christ
[59:01] well Ram said see you have an
[59:03] that you're living but you are come from
[59:05] this dead thousand years here and you're
[59:07] still holding that name you got a name
[59:09] remember to be sure that's right the
[59:11] other churches said you have kept my
[59:14] name you've kept my name in this age
[59:16] they lost it and come out here and said
[59:18] you've got another name you're living
[59:19] but you're dead does that make sense now
[59:21] you can see from Ephesus they had the
[59:23] name F system Pergamos had it higher
[59:27] tier didn't Sardis didn't they had to
[59:29] Crete they had titles and then
[59:32] Philadelphia had it Laodicea didn't but
[59:34] we know it carries over you know that
[59:36] does that make sense I thought wow what
[59:38] a striking revelation the name of Jesus
[59:40] Christ was starting being used and the
[59:41] church age - slowly was changed then it
[59:44] was changed the father only goes but now
[59:46] we have believers that have not denied
[59:48] his name today amen that's you and I and
[59:50] all the faithful Saints from
[59:52] Philadelphia on that have kept the name
[59:53] of Jesus Christ
[59:54] alright a couple more here oh I got
[59:58] plenty time verse two this is the
[1:00:03] thought I'm going to bring out in the
[1:00:04] quotes your works are complete or
[1:00:06] perfect if you're born again of the Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost in other words if you get born to
[1:00:12] the Holy Ghost if we're born of the Holy
[1:00:14] Ghost
[1:00:14] our lives will totally fulfill God's
[1:00:18] idea on what we were supposed to do
[1:00:20] right in other words we will do the will
[1:00:23] of God because those that are lost
[1:00:25] didn't do the will of God Jesus said I
[1:00:27] never knew you so anyone who has the
[1:00:29] Holy Ghost will be perfect before God
[1:00:31] they'll do everything God told them to
[1:00:33] do
[1:00:34] and David did all of that except for in
[1:00:37] the matter of Bathsheba remember the
[1:00:39] Bible said he said you kept all your
[1:00:41] will of God except in the matter of
[1:00:42] Uriah the Bible said that one time he
[1:00:46] got out of the will of God of course he
[1:00:48] made mistakes but the Bible recognized
[1:00:50] that was the one time he transgressed
[1:00:51] badly against the Lord so here's what
[1:00:54] Brad said remember that's not my idea
[1:00:55] I'm just saying what brother Brandon
[1:00:57] said okay I'll let you know if it's a
[1:01:00] maybe a fresh revelation I think I've
[1:01:02] received okay just like the Joshua of
[1:01:04] the seven nations that was other
[1:01:05] evidence say that that's a revelation I
[1:01:08] felt God gave to me I honestly do and I
[1:01:11] felt like it was backed up by the
[1:01:12] scripture ok brother BAM says I've not
[1:01:15] found your works perfect
[1:01:17] well Graham said you haven't come to
[1:01:19] perfection so under justification you're
[1:01:21] not quite perfect yet because we find
[1:01:24] out that they had justification right
[1:01:25] here justification he said I beg your
[1:01:28] pardon está case right on Luther and
[1:01:29] signed vacation is here and here's the
[1:01:32] Holy Spirit see now that three elements
[1:01:34] that worked in those three Church ages
[1:01:36] that's what it takes to constitute a
[1:01:38] full berth amen so he full birth is
[1:01:41] being perfect before God aren't you glad
[1:01:43] Church we can be perfect before God I
[1:01:46] decided I don't know what I can hardly
[1:01:49] contain myself to think that I can be
[1:01:51] perfect whereas Luther's age couldn't
[1:01:53] yet look at all they did but I also have
[1:01:56] to look at look at all they failed into
[1:01:58] because lacking the word not their fault
[1:02:01] just the age they lived in right just
[1:02:04] the age 11 because you and I we can only
[1:02:06] live as high as the word that's preached
[1:02:07] to us right I tell people all the time
[1:02:09] hoping they'll say well what do you
[1:02:11] preach I thought to the people I
[1:02:13] baptized they said why can't I get
[1:02:15] Victor of this and I said you can't live
[1:02:16] higher than you can preach alright I'm
[1:02:19] sorry that the people preach to you and
[1:02:20] I was hoping they'd say okay what do you
[1:02:21] preach but they didn't yet but I'm
[1:02:23] hoping they will
[1:02:24] I'm really hoping they will cause I
[1:02:26] don't want to be a proselyte
[1:02:26] I don't wanna proselyte people to our
[1:02:28] church I want people to come because
[1:02:29] they're drawn by the Holy Spirit like
[1:02:32] Amen was drawn here I never had to beg
[1:02:33] him to come he just kept coming back you
[1:02:35] know same thing with your whole family
[1:02:37] you know the whole ya yang family by
[1:02:39] God's grace I didn't we didn't beg
[1:02:40] anybody nobody had to beg me to come to
[1:02:42] church I came here because I heard
[1:02:44] something I never heard before
[1:02:45] and something inside of me said that's
[1:02:47] right and I'll forsake everything for
[1:02:50] the truth of the word of God amen that's
[1:02:52] I want to see in our day but by God's
[1:02:54] grace we can be perfect we can totally
[1:02:56] fulfill God's will we don't have to come
[1:02:59] up short if we have a full berth now
[1:03:02] here's the next thought brother Ram
[1:03:03] gives ok I think yeah I'm gonna go
[1:03:06] through this past the three works of
[1:03:08] grace were a restored beginning with
[1:03:09] Sardis age yeah we've I've just had a
[1:03:11] slide on this I must have did double
[1:03:13] slides forgive me so they're living a
[1:03:16] name that they're dead they were
[1:03:17] justified under Sardis right yeah I'm
[1:03:20] sorry I think this is a repeat yep I
[1:03:22] think I just added sorry John Wesley's
[1:03:25] sanctification brother Ram that's the
[1:03:27] Holy Ghost right does every know that I
[1:03:28] think that's a that's pretty simple
[1:03:29] there yeah I'm sorry
[1:03:31] I think I just wanted to show another
[1:03:32] slide on that so I did double slides I
[1:03:34] kind of repeated my time there so
[1:03:36] forgive me I know this might be the last
[1:03:38] one let's see here
[1:03:39] three three okay almost two four six
[1:03:43] okay almost there ten more okay this
[1:03:45] will go fast you and I escape the enemy
[1:03:49] I'm sorry yeah we and also Luthor's age
[1:03:53] we escape the enemy with the first work
[1:03:56] of sanctification remember picture
[1:03:58] Israel coming out of Egypt right picture
[1:04:00] them coming out of Egypt they escaped
[1:04:02] Pharaoh they escaped this the others
[1:04:04] taskmasters right and program says the
[1:04:06] same thing when you get baptized in the
[1:04:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ now reads
[1:04:13] the scripture he said holdfast your
[1:04:15] justification stick to it don't let them
[1:04:17] people stop that back away from you that
[1:04:19] also you've received you heard they read
[1:04:21] the same Bible we read see but they just
[1:04:23] didn't take all of it because it wasn't
[1:04:25] revealed to them it wasn't for their age
[1:04:28] see Luther can't help it he didn't have
[1:04:30] all the word like we have that's the
[1:04:32] reason they'll come forth in the
[1:04:33] resurrection they walked in the light
[1:04:35] they had to walk in so they'll come
[1:04:37] forth amen by Reformation I mean the
[1:04:41] escaped ones those that escaped even in
[1:04:44] the Sardis Church understand what I mean
[1:04:46] the escaped ones is one he's talking
[1:04:47] about they're right here this little
[1:04:49] bitty group here that's living by
[1:04:51] justification he said that's the one
[1:04:55] that does it see it's the second round
[1:04:56] that does okay I'm sorry this the one
[1:04:58] that denominated I don't know if I read
[1:05:01] this - you're not if I didn't forgive me
[1:05:03] now look they come out they seen the
[1:05:05] light Luthor turn right after the death
[1:05:07] of Luther not Luther that's what I was
[1:05:09] saying earlier Martin Luther didn't
[1:05:11] denominating organize it was the group
[1:05:13] after him Luther never made an
[1:05:15] organization it was a bunch after him
[1:05:17] Wesley never made no organization it was
[1:05:19] the group after him them founders of
[1:05:21] Pentecost never made an organization it
[1:05:22] was a group after them that's the one
[1:05:24] that does it see it's the second round
[1:05:26] that does it the real angel of light
[1:05:28] will never make an organization Amen I
[1:05:32] like that by God's grace so see we can't
[1:05:34] organize the member organizes just this
[1:05:36] organizers saying no more Holy Spirit
[1:05:38] I'm not going to give any more
[1:05:39] that's what organization is whenever
[1:05:41] someone says there's I can't take any
[1:05:43] more the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:05:44] you can't leave me any further into
[1:05:46] anything else they've organized so god
[1:05:49] help us to hear the voice of the Holy
[1:05:50] Spirit that's why I Church I'm listening
[1:05:52] every service I'm listen what the Holy
[1:05:54] Spirit is asking me to give up write or
[1:05:57] sacrifice or obey what more do I need
[1:06:00] obey I don't want to get a deaf ear to
[1:06:02] what the Holy Spirit saying we must come
[1:06:05] here to learn even if they're just for
[1:06:07] adults here tonight mercy
[1:06:09] I appreciate the faithful Saints you
[1:06:10] know but even if there's four I want to
[1:06:14] be able to hear what the spirit saying
[1:06:16] right and I got a couple more in verse
[1:06:22] brother that makes this statement this
[1:06:24] quote about chapter 3 verse 4 he said
[1:06:27] the few that they're talking about are
[1:06:29] the Holy Ghost filled believers the very
[1:06:31] few which we know little flock for not
[1:06:33] little flock let's read this quote he
[1:06:36] reads verse 4 there's worse for thou
[1:06:38] hast a few names I should have made that
[1:06:40] bowl and I actually wanted to make that
[1:06:42] boat now has a few names even in sardis
[1:06:45] which have not defiled their garments
[1:06:46] they shall walk with me in white for
[1:06:49] they are worthy there was a few of them
[1:06:52] that still would not bow down to that
[1:06:53] thing and kept themselves pure and clean
[1:06:55] the trace from way back to Pentecost the
[1:07:00] spirit filled hallelujah a lot of them
[1:07:03] then when Luther's age begin to dominate
[1:07:05] what they do sorry right back in the
[1:07:07] Bible said acting like their mammy come
[1:07:09] right back down started a nomination but
[1:07:12] a few of them stood right out that they
[1:07:14] wouldn't do it
[1:07:15] they stayed right out for God so I hope
[1:07:18] that makes sense Luther was one of the
[1:07:22] Holy Ghost Pentecost Saints for his day
[1:07:24] does that make sense but they but he
[1:07:26] didn't have it in the soul right but he
[1:07:28] acted as close as anybody could act to
[1:07:30] one of those day of Pentecost and he he
[1:07:34] acted the closest they'd seen amen was
[1:07:37] Martin Luther praise the Lord because
[1:07:39] that was the life being restored it was
[1:07:41] the first part of life justification so
[1:07:43] he was the one that acted the closest to
[1:07:46] the day of Pentecost
[1:07:47] oh my hallelujah I love that he keeps
[1:07:51] going Jesus said well alright you got a
[1:07:54] few names they're worthy to walk before
[1:07:55] me dressed in white don't make a
[1:07:57] denomination
[1:07:58] don't take up the nickel Aiden doctor
[1:08:01] now don't start your denomination off
[1:08:03] again but just stay free and God let the
[1:08:07] Holy Spirit lead you as you go on
[1:08:09] there's a few of them still left a many
[1:08:13] want to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:08:14] tonight that's Santa Fe I believe I made
[1:08:16] it
[1:08:16] I believe I made it by God's grace
[1:08:17] praise the Lord all right
[1:08:20] I still got 13 minutes left for an hour

[1:09:06] all these things still relate to us

[1:09:11] power available to us today because we
[1:09:13] have more the word so I just want to

[1:10:28] further Lord I want to be led further I
[1:10:30] want to know what it's like to grow
[1:10:32] deeper in love with you dear God for we

[1:10:36] thus saith the Holy Spirit Lord teach us
[1:10:39] to be more wise teach us the Lord have
[1:10:42] the depth of love in our lives where
[1:10:43] we'll continue to hear your voice every
[1:10:46] service nor every day in our homes we'll
[1:10:48] get on our knees and pray dear God Lord
[1:10:52] I'm so humbled in my heart Lord so look
[1:10:55] at Martin Luther to think I can have
[1:10:58] hired the partner they're like Lord I
[1:10:59] just feel so little dear God
[1:11:01] I feel so unworthy of a man who wrote
[1:11:04] ten books who had the courage to nail a
[1:11:07] paper with 95 complaints of the Roman
[1:11:11] Catholic Church on a church nor who
[1:11:14] stood before trials oppose God what a
[1:11:18] mighty man you made him dear Lord I feel
[1:11:20] so irrelevant compared to that man dear
[1:11:25] Norma but yet Lord I know what the word
[1:11:27] says I know what history says about his
[1:11:29] life but I just want to say this own
[1:11:32] live all the word that's revealed to
[1:11:35] this age I don't want to cause any
[1:11:38] hatred toward Jews or black or white or
[1:11:40] any race more than lunch cause any
[1:11:43] painter and Lord against the government
[1:11:45] I just want to cause hatred against sin
[1:11:48] dear Lord I want to cause the love for
[1:11:52] the word of God I just want to see so
[1:11:54] sane I just want to do what you are
[1:11:57] dating my humble little life to do going
[1:12:01] to God so insignificant compared to
[1:12:07] Martin Luther John Wesley John Calvin
[1:12:11] John Wickliffe who died at the stake
[1:12:14] burned as a martyr to understand some of
[1:12:18] these things how it could be that we can
[1:12:19] live a more holy ghost in life than men
[1:12:22] like that I can't understand it but it
[1:12:24] seems
[1:12:25] nor that according to your prophet Lord
[1:12:27] more of the Spirit of God has given
[1:12:29] person the soul today we could be fully
[1:12:33] sealed or the word can get into our soul
[1:12:35] the Holy Ghost can get into our soul
[1:12:39] give us the quickening power my god we
[1:12:43] can clearly see how David mister as the
[1:12:45] mighty of a man as he is we can clearly
[1:12:48] see that murder adultery Lord would not
[1:12:50] be pleasing in the New Testament or ever
[1:12:52] Lord God but especially in this hour it
[1:12:55] not be pleasing to a Holy Ghost filled
[1:12:57] Saint they couldn't do it North because
[1:13:02] Satan sealed out little God father I'm
[1:13:06] just humbled by this message tonight or
[1:13:08] not because I've preached it nothing
[1:13:10] you're no record I know that but just
[1:13:15] Lord reading these things Lord and
[1:13:17] pondering them thinking about the
[1:13:21] amazing sacrifices and these men have
[1:13:24] made Lord so I say a prayer for myself
[1:13:27] and for our church that you'll lead us
[1:13:30] Lord to do your perfect will for our
[1:13:32] lives or it may just be living pure a
[1:13:36] virgin pure life or spiritually Lord God
[1:13:40] we may not write books I know that
[1:13:43] everybody's an officer we may not raise
[1:13:46] the dead all of us Lord
[1:13:48] not everyone's an apostle but Lord we do
[1:13:51] want to do all your will for our lives
[1:13:54] every time that's my prayer Jesus
[1:13:57] tonight it makes me cry thinking about
[1:13:58] this I feel so insignificant Lorne I
[1:14:01] feel like that's your problem prayed at
[1:14:04] 53 years old he said I feel like I've
[1:14:06] done nothing for God Norda 30 he write

[1:14:11] thing I've done nothing for you Jesus I
[1:14:14] just would do something for me dear God
[1:14:16] I just want to win some souls Lord I
[1:14:19] just want to see the book of Acts church
[1:14:21] and Akron Lord God if it be your will I
[1:14:24] know what the prophecy is I know what
[1:14:25] the Bible says would you grant it to us
[1:14:28] Lord Jesus I pray help me the humble
[1:14:31] myself lord help us all go home with
[1:14:33] ourselves I feel like you see our
[1:14:36] sincerity tonight Lord God
[1:14:39] I love you Lord Jesus we just want to be
[1:14:43] sincere before you and we want to be
[1:14:46] faithful to the word dear God

[1:14:50] restoration I don't want a Reformation I

[1:15:00] know thank you for it Lord willing to
[1:15:01] wait 25 years I got 11 under my belt
[1:15:03] dear God I think before the Apostolic
[1:15:06] things we have seen Lord I do believe
[1:15:09] there's more you believe there's more
[1:15:10] for us Lord God as your prophet said
[1:15:13] we've seen apostolic times in perfect
[1:15:14] faith he said but we want to see more of
[1:15:16] it and I'll keep asking for that because
[1:15:20] I want to see more so today I want to
[1:15:23] see a church that sinners or sit Canyon
[1:15:25] and come in like Peter and Ananias and
[1:15:27] Sapphira I want to see that girl or God
[1:15:29] I want to see Lord I want to see like
[1:15:34] the day of Pentecost Lord where people
[1:15:36] shouting and praising God and people so
[1:15:39] hungry for they say what is this manna
[1:15:41] what is this and Lord somebody stand up
[1:15:43] and say this is that which Joel spoke of
[1:15:46] hallelujah the prophesy from the bride
[1:15:52] and I'm wanting to cry for that money to
[1:15:55] pray for that Lord I'm willing to plead

[1:15:58] the prayer like Jacob wrestling about
[1:16:00] with the angel give me strength to be
[1:16:02] able to wrestle it out of your God all
[1:16:05] of us Lord God these faithful Saints
[1:16:08] here tonight less than the Lord God they
[1:16:10] want to wrestle doubt they've had the
[1:16:12] strength and they had the opportunity to
[1:16:13] come here tonight may they dress without
[1:16:15] me I wrestle it out Lord may give us our
[1:16:18] hearts desire nor God to be wise virgins
[1:16:21] with the death of your love and to have
[1:16:24] a real relationship with you Lord all
[1:16:26] the days of our life your God as we
