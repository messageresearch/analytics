[50:36] [Music]
[50:42] [Music]
[51:11] I want to continue this little thought
[51:16] on modesty I've been reviewing this
[51:18] reviewing modesty and I'll probably look
[51:21] at makeup tonight as well by God's grace
[51:24] my own okay so the mic on I think the
[51:30] batteries run out maokai can you get
[51:32] some batteries for me please
[51:35] thank you buddy and you have to get them
[51:37] they're on the floor they're on the
[51:38] greens on the green mat and they're
[51:42] Duracell I think anyways let's take a
[51:44] few scriptures let's read first Timothy
[51:47] 2 again by God's grace I had a couple
[51:52] witnesses that I should be teaching on
[51:56] this that were I just thought were
[51:57] strange you know you as a minister you
[51:58] know you look for you look to God and
[52:01] then you say Lord you know just show me
[52:02] some witnesses and yeah thank you sir
[52:07] yeah I'll take all three about to thank
[52:09] you but I had extra witnesses this week
[52:16] it was interesting you know Sunday
[52:19] Sunday night we preached on modest
[52:20] clothing and swimwear and then my
[52:23] children had swim lessons the very next
[52:26] day and it forgot all about that so I
[52:29] went there and was reminded how
[52:30] important modesty is our children our
[52:32] girls did swim lessons with long skirts
[52:36] on and long shirts on and they tights
[52:39] underneath you know of the skirts but
[52:42] they were they were the most modest -
[52:45] dressed children there so we're very
[52:47] thankful about that and then Tuesday I
[52:50] was at my workout last night at
[52:52] Taekwondo and the master starts talking
[52:56] about how modesty has changed he's never
[52:58] talked about modesty malachi as a
[52:59] witness there and all of a sudden he
[53:01] talks about how in the 1950s he used to
[53:03] be a shame for a man to have just a
[53:05] t-shirt all on TV he talked about mash
[53:08] does anyone ever
[53:09] growing up seen - I saw reruns growing
[53:11] up a mash my dad loved mash anyways I
[53:16] guess they wouldn't let the man so that
[53:17] was a second witness and then today at
[53:19] school these kids come up one of the boy
[53:21] comes up and said mr. Smith I got a
[53:23] cross earring in and my heart just sank
[53:25] you know I'm like oh mercy but and what
[53:27] do I say to this kid he's like he's
[53:28] eight years old and he just got it he's
[53:31] got an earring Pierce I said I said
[53:33] buddy I didn't plan it the Holy Spirit
[53:35] just brought I said does that remind you
[53:37] of Jesus and he said yes I said okay I'd
[53:41] say you know I didn't say nothing like
[53:43] yeah you know nice yeah my heart's
[53:45] broken yo and then a girl just a few
[53:47] seconds later said mr. Smith I'm going
[53:49] to get my nails done and get crosses on
[53:51] them I just like there wasn't the same
[53:53] thing I said those crosses remind you
[53:55] Jesus so I've had three reminders for
[53:59] reminders this week about the importance
[54:01] of a holy life and a holy outward
[54:04] appearance so I just felt led to keep
[54:06] studying on this so let's go to 1st
[54:08] Timothy 2:9 Oh have you be seated by
[54:09] God's grace I think it's a good review
[54:12] for us all and like I said I've had 4
[54:15] witnesses you know um so I just feel
[54:18] like it's the right thing to do at this
[54:19] point
[54:19] we finished Philadelphia Church age on
[54:22] Sunday morning and so we looking at the
[54:26] labor to see uh probably soon by God's
[54:28] grace probably review some of those
[54:31] first Timothy 2:9 appreciate everybody
[54:34] be in the house of Lord tonight amen
[54:36] god bless you for your sacrifice coming
[54:37] out to the house of the Lord
[54:40] okay good mics on all right praise good
[54:43] that's it look at verse 8 well start at
[54:48] 8 I will therefore that men pray
[54:50] everywhere brothers are you praying
[54:53] everywhere but Adam but Paul or maokai
[54:55] he praying everywhere men are supposed
[54:57] to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[55:00] without wrath and outings nothing
[55:03] doubting just pray don't doubt God verse
[55:05] 9 in like manner also that women adorn
[55:08] themselves in modest apparel with
[55:12] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[55:16] broided hair of gold I'm sorry or gold
[55:20] or pearls
[55:22] costly array but which becometh women
[55:24] professing godliness with good works
[55:26] that the woman learn in silence with all
[55:29] subjection Amen let's just have word
[55:32] prayer here I will just take that as our
[55:33] scripture here and we'll be probably
[55:34] looking at other scriptures as I said
[55:36] let's just have a word of Prayer
[55:37] Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight
[55:40] Lord we're thinking about the glory land
[55:42] dear God we're thinking what wouldn't it
[55:44] be when we get over yonder Lord God
[55:47] hallelujah we long to see your face Lord
[55:49] if we know God Lord you're invisible but
[55:52] you became visible in your son image of
[55:56] your spirit your invisible spirit so
[55:59] father we look forward to that day Lord
[56:01] and as we said on Sunday night Lord
[56:02] we're dressing now like they dress in
[56:05] heaven dear God and father we know
[56:07] that's important Lord God for if not
[56:09] we'll be found naked
[56:10] Lord we don't want to be found naked in
[56:12] sin we want to be clothed naturally and
[56:15] spiritually so father I pray take this
[56:17] time tonight Lord speak through me
[56:19] Lord that the Holy Spirit touch every
[56:21] heart Lord God as we know your spirit
[56:23] can pull us in the direction you'd have
[56:26] for us here tonight bless your people
[56:28] those livestreaming those present those
[56:31] that are listened to it on archived Lord
[56:32] God I pray may the Spirit of God speak
[56:34] to us in Jesus Christ's name
[56:36] nobody said Amen god bless she's been
[56:39] seated praise the Lord okay so I'll
[56:44] probably show some of the other
[56:46] scripture or some of the other quotes we
[56:48] have in pictures by God's grace I think
[56:51] we'll go back and okay
[56:54] we want to want to review this real
[56:58] quick we started with this on Sunday we
[57:03] showed again out Jesus in Revelation
[57:04] 1:13 Jesus has a rope down to the feet
[57:08] then of course women you know cover
[57:11] shoulder all the way down in skirts of
[57:13] course and men wear pants we talked
[57:16] about that now I'm going to skip ahead a
[57:18] little bit go to Daniel chapter 2 let's
[57:22] just start there and here's the visual
[57:24] for that Daniel 2 breaks up the image of
[57:28] Daniel in five parts so I I think it'd
[57:30] be kind of easy you know to show these
[57:35] five parts in Daniel chapter two and I
[57:40] got that was all fixed over here there's
[57:42] five divisions now the scripture I don't
[57:44] I'm I'm Daniel three over there but not
[57:46] Daniel - I didn't have time to get
[57:47] Daniel to up there but I thought I
[57:50] thought that was a little inspired I
[57:52] thought inspired by the Holy Spirit that
[57:54] if the Holy Spirit broke up an image of
[57:56] a man in five parts then that's perhaps
[57:58] how God breaks up our bodies in those
[58:01] five parts by the grace of the Lord a
[58:04] Daniel chapter 2 I'm sorry I'm having
[58:08] trouble finding Daniel here Daniel Hosea
[58:14] Thank You Daniel chapter 2 there we go
[58:16] Harvey now I think I'll start okay you
[58:31] got a service 31 the IO King sauce and
[58:34] behold a great image this great image
[58:35] whose brightness was excellent stood
[58:37] before thee and the form thereof was
[58:40] terrible the images head was of the gold
[58:42] case there's the First Division the head
[58:46] the second his breasts and arms of
[58:49] silver that's the second division now
[58:53] here's where I got a little bit confused
[58:54] on Sunday because I forgot Anna read it
[58:56] for a few hours and it said his belly
[58:59] and thighs of brass so belly loins and
[59:03] thighs all go together and that's the
[59:05] major part of the body that we'd say the
[59:08] largest part of the body so head breast
[59:10] belly arms loins
[59:12] I'm sorry belly loin thighs and then
[59:15] legs and feet we'll see in the next
[59:16] verse verse 33 his legs of iron his feet
[59:19] part of iron and part of clay does that
[59:23] help by God's grace that's the picture I
[59:24] didn't have on Sunday night by the grace
[59:26] of Lord so which parts did was Jesus
[59:29] covered in in heaven Church he was
[59:31] covered all the way from the breasts all
[59:33] the way down to the feet amen hallelujah
[59:36] he was covered all the way down there so
[59:38] we believe it's best to cover as we said
[59:40] on Sunday I'm sorry that should have
[59:42] been a little lower it should have been
[59:43] past the knees there as we said on
[59:45] Sunday we believe we should cover from
[59:46] the shoulders at least down past the
[59:48] knees
[59:49] and our sisters got to be careful you
[59:51] know if they wear a skirt right past and
[59:54] he's got to be careful not to expose
[59:56] thighs because thighs our nakedness in
[59:59] the scripture okay so we want to make
[1:00:01] sure now you see it sometimes sisters
[1:00:03] you know in the message or whatever
[1:00:04] they'll have a little slits in the back
[1:00:06] and then if they bend down or to pick
[1:00:08] something up people can see their their
[1:00:10] thighs and they shouldn't do that you
[1:00:12] know that's wrong that's showing
[1:00:14] nakedness so we want to have it long
[1:00:16] enough where we don't cause anybody to
[1:00:18] stumble we don't want to be guilty of
[1:00:20] causing anyone to stumble okay so I
[1:00:23] thought this would be helpful here by
[1:00:25] the grace of Lord now I want to show a
[1:00:28] little more history now Sunday we showed
[1:00:31] this in 1922 this is out of Chicago City
[1:00:35] or I'm sorry in Chicago I'm not sure
[1:00:37] where but these two women were getting
[1:00:38] arrested for showing off their thighs
[1:00:40] and that's history now we're gonna find
[1:00:44] out just ten or fifteen years later it
[1:00:46] was okay but in 1922 they could be
[1:00:49] arrested for showing off your thighs
[1:00:51] which was shocking and then a few years
[1:00:54] later this must be the 30s or 40s
[1:00:57] they would measure the women's dresses
[1:01:01] their swim dresses they had to be a less
[1:01:03] than six inches from the knee so if it
[1:01:07] was more than six inches from the knee
[1:01:08] that the skirt they they got kicked out
[1:01:10] they couldn't swim at the beach and
[1:01:13] that's sad I just think it's the it's
[1:01:16] just mind-boggling to think of this now
[1:01:18] let's review a little bit of history
[1:01:20] here so this is part two on the modest
[1:01:22] clothing like I said I had actually four
[1:01:25] witnesses I just thought of the other
[1:01:26] ones there but my Taekwondo instructor
[1:01:28] talked about how truth is pliable but I
[1:01:31] told Malachi's that truth is not pliable
[1:01:33] so my instructor was basically saying
[1:01:35] that you know in the mass days in the
[1:01:37] 1950s a man at Essure it was in modest
[1:01:41] but he said today he said boys can go
[1:01:45] down the streets and they're you know
[1:01:46] they're pants hanging down in the city
[1:01:47] imagine that happens you know they show
[1:01:49] their undergarments he said that's he
[1:01:51] said that's okay for people today he
[1:01:53] said but for both generations today in
[1:01:55] 1950 being totally naked on the street
[1:01:58] was sin or was wrong so he said see see
[1:02:01] how truth is bendable and in my mind
[1:02:03] no it's not bendable truth is not
[1:02:06] bendable God always wanted that apart
[1:02:08] from the shoulders all the way down
[1:02:11] clothes they meant God's Word has never
[1:02:13] changed hey men God started that in
[1:02:16] Genesis 3:21 when he put coats of skins
[1:02:18] on Adam and Eve he wanted it there and
[1:02:20] it continued all the rest of the Bible
[1:02:22] even into the book of Revelation into
[1:02:24] the future so truth is not pliable truth
[1:02:27] is truth truth is unchanging amen and
[1:02:30] that's all the students today at a
[1:02:32] school with earrings and fingernail pain
[1:02:34] and I'm just like oh my but here's the
[1:02:38] history the public undressing of the
[1:02:40] 1900s and like I said if you want to
[1:02:41] copy the book buy you one if you can't
[1:02:43] afford it
[1:02:44] throw a nice book had a lot of great
[1:02:45] history I'm gonna alright what I'm gonna
[1:02:47] do is I write my book I'm going to
[1:02:49] contact the library and use a lot of the
[1:02:51] books he used and then and be able to
[1:02:53] read them myself so here from 1900 1910
[1:02:58] this book shows the woman's arms were
[1:03:00] exposed remember this time they were
[1:03:03] separate parts of the beach there was
[1:03:05] total segregation at the beach there was
[1:03:07] men on one side women on their side well
[1:03:09] in the 1900s and 1910s it went from
[1:03:11] long-sleeve up to no sleeve in the 1920s
[1:03:16] their legs started being shown and their
[1:03:18] back started appearing
[1:03:20] I remember recalled in the rest of 1922
[1:03:23] fourth eye exposure they arrested in
[1:03:26] 1922 for exposing their thigh but there
[1:03:30] was no arrest in the 30s and 1930s they
[1:03:32] women started showing cleavage and
[1:03:34] technology advanced which led to new
[1:03:37] fabrics and fibers for tight swimwear so
[1:03:41] before you couldn't see the form of the
[1:03:42] body they were just so baggy but then
[1:03:46] inks are getting tighter 1935 is
[1:03:49] actually 1935 the two-piece suit was
[1:03:51] invented but was not popular to the
[1:03:53] 1940s it shocked people for almost 10
[1:03:56] years 5 10 years people were shocked
[1:03:58] like wow they're showing off the
[1:04:00] midsection I think it's called the
[1:04:02] midriff I think if I'm not mistaken ok
[1:04:06] and it was so shocking it didn't even
[1:04:08] come publicly didn't happen publicly for
[1:04:10] a number of years because here's what it
[1:04:12] said in 1933 this is from Harper's
[1:04:14] Bazaar magazine it
[1:04:16] said no other human device can even
[1:04:18] approximate the utter freedom that
[1:04:21] perfection of fit at least or in motion
[1:04:24] I'm sorry I arrest our motion that airy
[1:04:26] but strictly legal sense of wearing
[1:04:28] nothing at all so this is a magazine
[1:04:30] promoting women to wear really tight
[1:04:33] swimwear and they're saying it gives us
[1:04:36] the freedom to feel like we're in
[1:04:37] wearing nothing at all I mean
[1:04:39] spiritually warning signs should have
[1:04:42] been going off in people's minds right
[1:04:44] but this is in 1933 so see that's why
[1:04:49] today women have that same type of we'd
[1:04:52] say adulterous or kind of harlot kind of
[1:04:55] spirit when they wear clothes that are
[1:04:57] super tight you know especially to work
[1:04:58] out you know like you see CrossFit
[1:05:00] people or something like that they feel
[1:05:02] like they're wearing nothing at all
[1:05:04] that's because they are in one way they
[1:05:07] they are they're wearing it so tight it
[1:05:09] gives the form in their body causing men
[1:05:11] to lust so skin tight clothing was
[1:05:14] devised to offer nudity and covering at
[1:05:18] the same time so see it's a mixture
[1:05:20] right it's I was covering but also
[1:05:22] nudity because it gives the the full
[1:05:24] form of the body right it gives the
[1:05:27] whole form of the body but it's a
[1:05:29] mixture of we'd say nudity and covering
[1:05:31] it's a perversion amen
[1:05:33] now the 1940s and 50s was when the
[1:05:37] two-piece suits revealed the midriff
[1:05:39] which is the place between the chest and
[1:05:41] the waist so revealed this area here
[1:05:46] strapless suits and bared shoulders were
[1:05:49] now seen advertisers began using these
[1:05:51] immodest women to sell their products
[1:05:54] and they still do it today
[1:05:55] of course 1960s and 70s the navel was
[1:05:59] exposed the belly button so they never
[1:06:01] saw that belly button to the 1960s or
[1:06:04] 70s and yet the one-piece conservative
[1:06:09] suits right that's what the that's what
[1:06:11] the religious people would say well I'm
[1:06:13] not wearing a two-piece suit I just got
[1:06:15] a one-piece suit but that one-piece suit
[1:06:17] kept coming up higher and higher and
[1:06:19] reveal more of the thigh all the way up
[1:06:22] to the waist right and so now the
[1:06:26] one-piece suits are more erotic than
[1:06:28] they'd ever been the
[1:06:30] conservative suits because they show the
[1:06:33] thigh all the way up to the waist and
[1:06:35] now the 1980s 1990s
[1:06:37] everything's been revealed since then I
[1:06:39] don't even write the words on there
[1:06:41] because they're just so awful okay now
[1:06:44] does that help you a little bit this is
[1:06:45] all historical fact like nobody can
[1:06:48] argue with this and the whole time God's
[1:06:51] people are standing there saying onward
[1:06:53] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[1:06:55] with the cross of Jesus going on before
[1:06:57] and there's a Christian marching on and
[1:07:00] brother Brandon saw the vision of the
[1:07:02] Church of America member he said she
[1:07:03] just had some covering on the bottom she
[1:07:05] was totally naked up top right dancing a
[1:07:09] rock-and-roll smoke and cutting her hair
[1:07:10] that's what the vision showed and
[1:07:12] brother Graham said that vision is thus
[1:07:14] saith the Lord amen
[1:07:17] so see how we're obviously we've gone
[1:07:19] towards that the the world now but the
[1:07:22] bride she's all dressed in her wedding
[1:07:24] garments amen she's all ready to take a
[1:07:26] flight to the sky Haven just got to stay
[1:07:29] in line Church amen we just got to stay
[1:07:31] in line stay with the word now what I'd
[1:07:35] like to do is take a few moments we did
[1:07:38] the Daniel 5 I just want to have some
[1:07:40] other notes I didn't have time to put up
[1:07:41] on here but we'll just go to some other
[1:07:42] notes but before I forget let me honey
[1:07:46] remember Mary Mary Tyler Moore's anyone
[1:07:48] remember Mary time oh okay
[1:07:49] last year she passed away and I had it
[1:07:52] on here that's not it here it is did you
[1:07:56] know she was the first woman to ever
[1:07:59] wear pants on a sitcom in the 1950s how
[1:08:03] many member Mary Tyler Moore she was on
[1:08:05] the life or Time magazine I think Life
[1:08:08] magazine when she passed away last year
[1:08:09] and it says the reason this article was
[1:08:13] written was because Hillary Clinton was
[1:08:15] running for president last year and she
[1:08:18] kept wearing pantsuits and the pantsuits
[1:08:20] caused such a revival amongst the
[1:08:23] worldly women to wear pant suits they
[1:08:25] become popular again because Hillary
[1:08:27] Clinton was wearing well led this
[1:08:29] article to be written that in fact Mary
[1:08:31] Tyler Moore was the first woman ever on
[1:08:33] a sitcom to wear pants I don't remember
[1:08:36] what year it was but
[1:08:40] interesting is it clearly leaps and
[1:08:42] bounds have been made since Mary Tyler
[1:08:44] Moore first began wearing pants on air
[1:08:46] but it's important to remember the woman
[1:08:48] who started it all in that sad there was
[1:08:52] a time when people were shocked like
[1:08:54] they're showing a woman in pants on TV
[1:08:57] they were shocked
[1:08:58] what you probably member to when they
[1:09:02] first put a husband and wife in the same
[1:09:04] bed on a sitcom that what you used to
[1:09:07] have separate beds on the early shows
[1:09:09] the first time there was a cuss word on
[1:09:12] TV all these firsts but we get so but
[1:09:15] the world has gotten so desensitized in
[1:09:17] church we're at a spot now where the
[1:09:19] generation raised up and they've never
[1:09:20] even heard what we believe they don't
[1:09:23] even know that there was a time when
[1:09:25] women never wore pants they don't even
[1:09:26] know that they don't even know there was
[1:09:29] a time women used to never wear makeup
[1:09:30] so we've got to be the generation we've
[1:09:33] got to share with them amen all right
[1:09:37] now this is my thought I had I had some
[1:09:41] different thoughts written down I wanted
[1:09:44] to cover some of these things now who's
[1:09:46] never seen the scriptures on makeup has
[1:09:48] anyone ever seen the scriptures our
[1:09:49] makeup here has everybody seen it
[1:09:50] already seen off all three of them or is
[1:09:54] it see all three have you sister Connie
[1:09:56] seen all three scriptures on makeup face
[1:09:59] painting in the Bible but Adam have you
[1:10:00] seen him okay let children have you seen
[1:10:04] them okay let's go over them just so
[1:10:08] you're aware of them okay I thought we'd
[1:10:09] cover that let's go to 2nd Kings 9 this
[1:10:13] is the first one 10 kings 9 this week I
[1:10:20] finish another chapter so now I have
[1:10:21] almost 20,000 words done in the book so
[1:10:23] I'm excited about that by God's grace
[1:10:25] the next chapter those gonna take the
[1:10:27] longest because I'm doing nose-rings
[1:10:29] everything else makeup high heels and I
[1:10:33] need a lot of research on that I can get
[1:10:35] the scripture on that but I'm adding
[1:10:36] actually need a lot of research on that
[1:10:38] so I think the process I think it's
[1:10:41] gonna slow down here as far as getting
[1:10:43] chapters done real fast so for second
[1:10:48] Kings 9 please send Kings 9 and this is
[1:10:51] the part this is one of the parts I love
[1:10:53] about the message because people say oh
[1:10:55] you worship brother branham or you
[1:10:56] follow a man or you follow man but
[1:10:58] everything I can say is right back to
[1:11:00] the Bible and I love that's what I love
[1:11:02] these studies that's why I made those
[1:11:03] videos in the first place because we are
[1:11:06] not following a man we're following
[1:11:08] Christ amen now a man a prophet point us
[1:11:12] to the word and we follow his teachings
[1:11:14] as they go back to the word but this is
[1:11:17] what I love about the message because it
[1:11:18] takes us back to Scripture now second
[1:11:21] Kings 9 now hum you know the story that
[1:11:30] Jay who was anointed to finish the work
[1:11:32] of Elijah I remember that he was
[1:11:34] anointed by I believe Elijah I'm sorry
[1:11:37] No Deal I show he was anointed by Lisha
[1:11:40] because he lied jaw anointed Elijah okay
[1:11:44] and then a son of a prophet anointed the
[1:11:46] next king I forget which one it was but
[1:11:48] Jay who was anointed to do this and in
[1:11:51] verse 22 go to verse 22 Jay who has to
[1:11:56] avenge all the sins of Jezebel and Ahab
[1:12:00] he has to avenge and he does it with
[1:12:04] thus saith the Lord God
[1:12:06] was going to judge Jezebel Abe and their
[1:12:10] sons he's got to pour out the judgment
[1:12:14] upon them because of the wickedness that
[1:12:16] they did remember I remember that
[1:12:18] Jezebel killed hundreds of Hebrew
[1:12:20] prophets kill them genuine we'd say holy
[1:12:24] spirit now they weren't filled in the
[1:12:25] soul where they were filled in the
[1:12:26] spirit genuine holy spirit filled Hebrew
[1:12:29] prophets she had him killed and then she
[1:12:32] killed neighbor
[1:12:33] now the Bible said they Jehu I'm sure
[1:12:36] that Jezebel committed whoredoms now I
[1:12:41] don't know if that's just spiritual
[1:12:42] whoredoms or natural whoredoms I don't
[1:12:44] know but we'll see it right here in
[1:12:46] verse 22 so along with all the murders
[1:12:50] and a certain authority over her husband
[1:12:53] because remember she killed Namath
[1:12:54] without asking her husband she basically
[1:12:56] was becoming King she took over the
[1:12:59] rulership of her husband so that's verse
[1:13:03] 22 and it came to pass when Joe ran now
[1:13:05] that's the son of Ahab and Jezebel saw
[1:13:08] Jehu that he said is it peace Jacob can
[1:13:11] you imagine what kind of fool would this
[1:13:13] man be he thinks he's gonna have peace
[1:13:15] with a man of God who's anointed by the
[1:13:17] Holy Spirit and he answered what peace
[1:13:19] so long as the whoredoms of thy mother
[1:13:21] Jezebel and her rich witchcrafts are so
[1:13:24] many a church that's how we should feel
[1:13:27] how can we have peace with sinners when
[1:13:30] they keep sitting around us pray how can
[1:13:33] we we cannot have peace any Christian
[1:13:35] can't stand to have sin around their
[1:13:37] lives that's what I want to get to our
[1:13:39] homes if we really say we have the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost how can we let sin in our homes
[1:13:44] whether it's on our phone or TV or
[1:13:46] anything like that we can't if we're
[1:13:48] truly born again amen if we can allow
[1:13:52] sin to keep happening and happening
[1:13:53] something's wrong we better see if what
[1:13:56] we're born again amen now look at this
[1:13:59] verse so see whoredoms and witchcraft
[1:14:03] now see I don't know if these are
[1:14:04] spiritual whoredoms
[1:14:05] which of course any sin any flirting
[1:14:08] with the devil is a whoredom because
[1:14:10] it's a spiritual intercourse with Satan
[1:14:12] but I don't know if she was also
[1:14:14] committing natural whoredoms which would
[1:14:17] be adultery I don't know if she
[1:14:19] committed adultery against Ahab or not I
[1:14:20] don't know but Jay who says you have
[1:14:23] whoredoms and witchcraft now I don't
[1:14:26] know if you know the story but in verse
[1:14:27] 24 Jay who draws a bow with his full
[1:14:30] strength and smoke jo Ram between his
[1:14:32] arms and it says and the arrow went out
[1:14:36] of his heart and he sunk down in this
[1:14:38] chariot this is the this is the facts of
[1:14:41] the Bible
[1:14:42] remember the Jehovah the Old Testament
[1:14:45] is who
[1:14:47] Jesus of the new but see God is gracious
[1:14:50] in the New Testament we know that God's
[1:14:52] more long-suffering in the New Testament
[1:14:55] so the so a lot of the sinners today
[1:14:57] like Jo Ram he was judged right there on
[1:15:00] earth now will God judge people today
[1:15:01] sure he'll judge people day but we see
[1:15:04] many sinners and whoredoms and women and
[1:15:06] you know movie stars and we see them and
[1:15:08] it seems like they aren't judged for
[1:15:10] entire lives and maybe that happens
[1:15:13] sometimes but we must always look at the
[1:15:15] end of their life right like the Bible
[1:15:18] said look at the end of a thing look at
[1:15:19] Elvis he's the easiest example look at
[1:15:22] Michael Jackson when Elvis died he was
[1:15:25] on drugs he was running around with
[1:15:27] women separated from his wife he was so
[1:15:30] unfaithful to his marriage vows he died
[1:15:32] according to his his bodyguards he died
[1:15:35] reading a book about Satanism on his
[1:15:38] toilet he died right there on the toilet
[1:15:39] passed out he was just an awful
[1:15:42] condition Michael Jackson he died
[1:15:44] because he couldn't sleep he was so
[1:15:46] tormented by demons remember that and
[1:15:48] you see that last year where they went
[1:15:50] and researched his computer and found
[1:15:52] child pornography all over the whole
[1:15:53] thing this I mean these this and this a
[1:15:56] man he looked so nice and he was full of
[1:15:59] demons I hope he repented but it didn't
[1:16:02] look like it because he was not ready to
[1:16:03] do another concert series

[1:16:28] all these how many remember all these
[1:16:30] people last year all these musicians
[1:16:32] that committed suicide remember that all
[1:16:34] these lead singers of all these bands
[1:16:36] committing suicide you know just blowing
[1:16:38] I like to say but blowing their brains
[1:16:40] out because they have no peace because
[1:16:43] there's no peace in drugs there's no
[1:16:46] peace in rock and roll there's no peace
[1:16:48] and riches there's only peace in Christ
[1:16:52] look at the end of a thing well here we
[1:16:55] have God laying a judgment upon Jay I'm
[1:16:58] sorry Jay Joe
[1:17:01] now he's not done he killed somebody
[1:17:04] else with Joe Ranft and then they buried
[1:17:06] the man and then he goes after Jo Jo I'm
[1:17:08] sorry
[1:17:09] jo ramse mama Jezebel see that one of
[1:17:13] these days shirts the Lord is gonna be
[1:17:14] come knocking for people that disobey
[1:17:16] the word of Lord whether RAM said that
[1:17:18] Jezebel had a pastor she just didn't
[1:17:22] obey the pastor Elijah right he's gonna
[1:17:26] come knocking some day it's time to time
[1:17:28] to meet your maker
[1:17:29] all right so Jay who comes knocking on
[1:17:32] the door verse 27 I'm sorry that's where
[1:17:37] they smite has ayah he comes knocking in
[1:17:39] verse 30 and when Jay who has come to
[1:17:42] Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she
[1:17:45] painted her face and tired her head and
[1:17:48] looked out the window okay so why did
[1:17:52] she paint her face because she knew now
[1:17:54] according to history it seems like since
[1:17:56] they had time to bury the bodies of
[1:17:58] those other guys that Jay who slayed it
[1:18:00] seems as if she knew she was next so
[1:18:04] what does she do in the day of her
[1:18:06] destruction what does she do she paints
[1:18:08] her face to try to intimidate God's man
[1:18:11] in utter defiance against the man look
[1:18:14] it's the spirit of Satan against the
[1:18:16] holy spirit and was that what does the
[1:18:19] spear Satan do it tries to intimidate it
[1:18:21] tries to be aggressive right in defiance
[1:18:25] oh look who I am I'm the queen she
[1:18:28] paints her face up to defy the spirit
[1:18:30] the holy spirit and the entire head just
[1:18:33] means to make her hair look really
[1:18:34] really calmly a really beautiful
[1:18:36] so she dresses all of herself up to try
[1:18:39] to somehow maybe seduce or defy the man
[1:18:43] of God my look who she said in verse 31
[1:18:46] and as Jay who entered in at the gate
[1:18:48] she said had Zimri peace who slew his
[1:18:52] master and he lifted up his face to the
[1:18:55] window and said who is on my side who
[1:18:57] and there looked out to him two or three
[1:19:00] eunuchs he said throw her down so they
[1:19:02] threw her down and some of her blood was
[1:19:04] sprinkled on the wall and on the horses
[1:19:06] and heat rode her under foot what an end
[1:19:09] look at the end of a person can
[1:19:11] everybody see that by God's grace look
[1:19:13] at
[1:19:13] she tries to paint herself up whether
[1:19:15] through seduction or intimidation let me
[1:19:18] say like this some pain up face won't
[1:19:20] fool a real man of God
[1:19:22] amen hallelujah
[1:19:25] even though late in these message
[1:19:26] churches they try to let them paint
[1:19:28] their faces that won't fool man of God
[1:19:30] hallelujah good because you can't fool
[1:19:34] God amen
[1:19:36] it's exactly right now look what
[1:19:38] happened this is the word of the Lord in
[1:19:40] verse 34 she's called a cursed woman go
[1:19:43] see this cursed woman she's a king's
[1:19:46] daughter barrier she's a king's daughter
[1:19:49] verse 35 they go to find her body
[1:19:51] there's not much left
[1:19:52] verse 36 wherefore they came again and
[1:19:54] told her told him and he said this is
[1:19:56] the word of the Lord which he spake by
[1:19:58] the servant Elijah the Tishbite saying
[1:20:00] in the portion of Jezreel shout dogs eat
[1:20:03] the flesh of Jezebel and the carcass of
[1:20:07] Jezebel shall be has done upon the face
[1:20:09] of the field in the portion of Jezreel
[1:20:10] so that they shall not say this is
[1:20:13] Jezebel and now I'm gonna be able to
[1:20:14] find her because of what an awful
[1:20:16] influence she had upon God God's Word
[1:20:20] and killing all those godly servants a
[1:20:23] church that's what God did to the
[1:20:28] Jezebel person right how many were what
[1:20:32] God does to the Jezebel Church how many
[1:20:35] know what he does let's go to Revelation
[1:20:37] 19 God does the same thing Revelation 19
[1:20:45] and brother Brandon brought this out in
[1:20:48] the fifth seal if you remember this this
[1:20:50] thought was brought out in the fifth
[1:20:51] seal revelation 19 verse 17
[1:21:03] on angel standing in the Sun and he
[1:21:04] cried with a loud voice saying to all
[1:21:06] the fowls of fly in the midst of heaven
[1:21:08] come and gather yourselves together unto
[1:21:10] the supper of the Great God that he may
[1:21:13] eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of
[1:21:14] captains and the flesh of mighty men and
[1:21:16] the flesh of horses and of them that sit
[1:21:18] on them and the flesh of all men both
[1:21:20] free and bond both small and great and I
[1:21:23] saw the beast and the kings of the earth
[1:21:25] and their armies gathered together to
[1:21:26] make war against him that sat on the
[1:21:28] horse and against his army now go down
[1:21:31] to verse 21 and the remnant were slain
[1:21:32] with the sword of him that sat upon the
[1:21:34] horse which sword proceeded out of his
[1:21:37] mouth and all the fowls were filled with
[1:21:40] their flesh and the church said but RAM
[1:21:43] said see look at the end of the Jezebel
[1:21:45] spirit once it gets in the church what
[1:21:47] happens both of them are eaten by dogs
[1:21:49] I'm sorry burnt my animals Jezebel eaten
[1:21:52] by dogs and the church is eaten my Birds
[1:21:56] see what the end is see what God thinks
[1:21:59] of a rebellious idolatrous group of
[1:22:01] people that transgressed the Word of God
[1:22:04] God doesn't like it right he doesn't
[1:22:07] like it and he brings forth judgment
[1:22:09] against it amen now we know there's not
[1:22:13] one scripture in the entire Bible where
[1:22:16] God ever asked anyone male or female to
[1:22:18] paint their face right you know you
[1:22:21] never asked anybody to do that so we
[1:22:23] must not now give me just a moment here
[1:22:26] I got a look to my scriptures real quick
[1:22:29] and let's go there I know the next one
[1:22:32] is in Jeremiah so let's go to Jeremiah
[1:22:34] I'm sorry I don't have the scripture
[1:22:36] I'll have it just a minute here I got to
[1:22:38] pull it up Jeremiah for third yes
[1:22:46] Jeremiah 430 this is the second one on
[1:22:49] painting the face Jeremiah 430
[1:23:02] alright who'd like to read that for me
[1:23:04] cuz I'm gonna read that okay okay thank
[1:23:06] you sir all right now this is an
[1:23:30] allegory I don't know what allegory is
[1:23:32] just like a story that represents
[1:23:34] something okay so it's like a it's a
[1:23:39] it's not a literal woman but this is a
[1:23:41] spiritual woman like it's a type it's a
[1:23:43] story of a type God is talking about
[1:23:45] Israel and Israel would go and make love
[1:23:47] or have whoredoms with the other nations
[1:23:50] and so God gives an allegory like a
[1:23:53] story in other words you're like a
[1:23:54] prostitute woman or a harlot woman or
[1:23:57] idolatrous woman that when she wants to
[1:23:59] find lover she goes and paints her face
[1:24:01] okay that's what the scripture said in
[1:24:03] verse 30 you deck yourself with
[1:24:06] ornaments of gold see decking yourself
[1:24:08] up dressing yourself up though you're
[1:24:10] though you rent you I face with painting
[1:24:12] in vain show the make thyself fair that
[1:24:14] lovers will despise thee they will seek
[1:24:16] thy life now you'd have to look up here
[1:24:19] but it's really small but I wrote this
[1:24:22] is God issuing a sentence against Israel
[1:24:24] because of what verse 12 says even a
[1:24:27] full wind from those places shall come
[1:24:29] unto me now also will I give a sentence
[1:24:31] against them this is God issuing a
[1:24:33] sentence he's judging them now notice
[1:24:35] with Jezebel and Israel they both paint
[1:24:39] their faces in the day of their
[1:24:40] judgement and that's striking and that's
[1:24:44] writing to see you know the judgments of
[1:24:47] God are on somebody when they're
[1:24:48] painting their face when they're
[1:24:51] presenting their face away God is not
[1:24:54] pleased
[1:24:54] you know the judgments of God can be
[1:24:56] against them could be upon them it's
[1:24:58] very possible in fact all three there's
[1:25:00] another example in Ezekiel get to in
[1:25:01] just a minute but you know some somehow
[1:25:04] now unless they're totally ignorant of
[1:25:06] it but the judgments of God are against
[1:25:09] them because this is what the Bible
[1:25:11] tells us happens when they paint their
[1:25:13] face now they're gonna get destroyed by
[1:25:15] I horsemen and bowmen in verse 29
[1:25:19] because of all their bitter wickedness
[1:25:22] and verse 18 their rebellion in verse 17
[1:25:25] and their foolishness in verse 22 this
[1:25:28] is why I God's judging them and God is
[1:25:30] God is saying how can I compare a nation
[1:25:33] and try to explain what they're doing
[1:25:36] and he said the best way to do it is a
[1:25:38] prostitute woman someone who's
[1:25:40] unfaithful to their husband who decks
[1:25:42] herself dresses all herself up and is
[1:25:45] unfaithful to her husband alright does
[1:25:48] that help by God's grace hope so boy
[1:25:51] it's quiet out there all right a man I
[1:25:54] know it's a tough tough topic Ezekiel 23
[1:25:57] 40 Seco 23:40 Seco 23 40 is the next
[1:26:14] text now again this is an allegory it's
[1:26:17] a type of Israel as another woman here
[1:26:21] and this is a chapter where she's
[1:26:24] lusting after the gods of other nations
[1:26:26] namely Egypt in Assyria now this is even
[1:26:33] more
[1:26:34] descriptive of a prostitute woman this
[1:26:35] is even more descriptive so let's go to
[1:26:37] verse 14 2340 and furthermore that ye
[1:26:42] have sent four men to come from far unto
[1:26:45] whom a messenger was sent and lo they
[1:26:46] came for whom now it is wash thy self
[1:26:49] paint that I paint a thine eyes and deck
[1:26:51] thyself with ornaments so see their
[1:26:55] lovers were far away so they they took
[1:26:57] such thought there they were so into
[1:26:59] idolatry and fornication and uh or
[1:27:01] whatever more that they said they sent
[1:27:04] from afar away and they were willing to
[1:27:05] wait for the sin to come in striking
[1:27:09] it's kind of like how people day will
[1:27:11] order things online and they'll wait for
[1:27:13] them to come in they'll order sin and
[1:27:15] we're actually waiting for two days with
[1:27:16] prime you know having Sun prime till it
[1:27:19] comes and in that sad that's how that's
[1:27:22] they have it shows they have no more
[1:27:24] conviction no more if they can order and
[1:27:27] then they can wait for sin they can wait
[1:27:29] all this time it shows they've so grieve
[1:27:31] the Holy Spirit they can't even hear the
[1:27:33] voice of the shepherd anymore
[1:27:35] amen the voice the shepherd saying
[1:27:37] return come back return but they can
[1:27:39] order things from far away and wait till
[1:27:42] it comes in because they're so Baxton
[1:27:45] alright verse 41 and sat us upon a
[1:27:49] stately bed and the table prepared
[1:27:51] before it whereupon thou sent nine
[1:27:53] incense and my Nowell so look she's now
[1:27:58] that's that's actually wrong did you
[1:28:00] know that's that's punishable by death
[1:28:01] for anyone to copy the oil and incense
[1:28:05] of the tabernacle was punishable by
[1:28:07] death so see how it's a religious well
[1:28:11] it's a religious thing here she mixes
[1:28:13] religion with lusting she makes his
[1:28:19] religion with seduction and where did
[1:28:22] all the painted face women go they went
[1:28:24] to the churches right they become
[1:28:27] preachers women preachers see they're
[1:28:30] mixing religious things with spiritual
[1:28:35] fornication right or in many cases
[1:28:37] physical fornication because a lot of
[1:28:39] these women are married twice that a
[1:28:40] preaching you know they got all these
[1:28:42] awful relationships they can't handle
[1:28:45] relationships because they're not based
[1:28:46] upon the Word of God
[1:28:48] they write books about relationships and
[1:28:50] can't even keep their relationships
[1:28:51] intact right they do conferences these
[1:28:55] million-dollar women conferences on how
[1:28:57] to keep a marriage and they're in their
[1:28:58] second or third marriage
[1:29:01] that's a pocker see if I ever saw it
[1:29:04] that's wrong but look can you see it's
[1:29:06] the same spirit it's mixing truth with
[1:29:11] lust now look what she does in verse 43
[1:29:15] and I said into her that was old in
[1:29:17] adultery this woman's been doing this
[1:29:18] over and over and over and is that with
[1:29:21] the Catholic Church denominations
[1:29:23] they've been a committed adultery over
[1:29:24] and over and over was Satan but not us
[1:29:28] we're virgin to Christ amen how do we
[1:29:30] were virgin to the word because we're
[1:29:32] washed in the word amen we don't commit
[1:29:36] adultery with denominational spirits and
[1:29:38] compromising with demons no sir
[1:29:42] look at verse 43 old adulteries will
[1:29:46] they now commit Horner's with her and
[1:29:47] she would them yet they went in unto her
[1:29:50] as they go into a woman that played the
[1:29:51] harlot so went they in under aloha and
[1:29:55] to a holy bar
[1:29:57] I'm sorry Ola and ahold of ah the lewd
[1:30:00] women that was Jerusalem and Samaria I
[1:30:02] believe if I'm not mistaken all right
[1:30:05] now those are the three on makeup
[1:30:10] does that help by God's grace is that
[1:30:11] new to anybody okay maybe a few my
[1:30:13] children I think it's new to you right
[1:30:14] children I don't think now we've read
[1:30:16] through that but I'm looking we've never
[1:30:18] pointed out to you like that
[1:30:19] okay now go back to revelation 2:20 let
[1:30:21] me just read this again here now this is
[1:30:25] one of the most striking things when you
[1:30:26] talk about makeup revelation 2:20
[1:30:36] revelation 2:20 who'd like to read that
[1:30:39] one for me Lydia okay thank you sweetie
[1:30:55] amen my this is 1896 let me go back to
[1:30:59] second kings real quick and see what
[1:31:00] year that was
[1:31:01] this is striking because the same spirit
[1:31:04] that was in Jezebel is now in the
[1:31:07] Christian Church and now it's battling
[1:31:09] Jesus Christ why because Jesus Christ
[1:31:12] was God of the Old Testament same to
[1:31:15] same two opposite spirits now Jezebel's
[1:31:19] this said she died in 884 ad so 9 this
[1:31:24] is almost a thousand years later that
[1:31:26] same spirit is still fighting the Holy
[1:31:28] Spirit amen
[1:31:30] and so you see that and now what do we
[1:31:33] have today we have women in the churches
[1:31:34] they've done the same thing Jezebel did
[1:31:36] they have Serpa thority over men they
[1:31:38] silenced the true preachers right they
[1:31:41] threatened the real preachers they wear
[1:31:45] makeup they emphasize money and
[1:31:47] prosperity just like Jezebel emphasized
[1:31:49] money prosperity land remember she took
[1:31:51] name boss land emphasize money and
[1:31:54] prosperity and they participate in
[1:31:57] idolatrous indulgences like the fancy
[1:32:00] cars and the planes like we talked about
[1:32:02] a few weeks ago
[1:32:08] and see how that Jezebel spirit likes to
[1:32:11] attack the true preachers so what did
[1:32:14] Elijah do Elijah ran from her and then
[1:32:16] what did God do God fed him and then
[1:32:20] made him aware that he wasn't the only
[1:32:21] one not bowing down to Jezebel's
[1:32:23] religion hey man
[1:32:25] hallelujah I like that and that's what
[1:32:27] we can do you know we can rest in God
[1:32:31] and we'll Sep we have to separate
[1:32:33] ourselves from that Jezebel group and
[1:32:34] God will feed us and let us know we're
[1:32:37] not the only ones not bowing down he saw
[1:32:39] I've got a bride all the way around the
[1:32:40] world amen who will not bow down to the
[1:32:43] Jezebel system praise God
[1:32:45] amen now I just want to say this too I'm
[1:32:48] not saying that every woman
[1:32:50] where's make up is gonna be judged
[1:32:52] because I don't know that but I'll tell
[1:32:54] you they're on the road to it right
[1:32:56] they're on the road because the only
[1:33:00] thing that God wants on our faces is his
[1:33:02] glory
[1:33:03] that's his glory that's the only thing
[1:33:06] in the Bible like Stephen had the face
[1:33:07] of a angel he didn't paint it up to look
[1:33:10] like a angel you know eating it out the
[1:33:11] paint and the mirror and everything like
[1:33:13] that he had the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:33:15] and that made him have the face like an
[1:33:17] angel praise the Lord and that's what we
[1:33:20] need today by the grace of God
[1:33:23] yeah that's second Corinthians 3:18 we
[1:33:27] all with open face beholding as in a
[1:33:30] glass the glory of the Lord so we look
[1:33:32] in when we look into the Word of God
[1:33:34] it's like looking the presence of God
[1:33:35] with the open face and we're changing
[1:33:39] the same image the face of God right
[1:33:41] because we're with open face looking the
[1:33:42] word of God the face of God and change
[1:33:45] the same image from glory to glory even
[1:33:47] as by the Spirit of the Lord so as we
[1:33:50] look into the word of God
[1:33:51] we're changed are our faces change into
[1:33:55] the very image of God we'd say in other
[1:33:57] words the image of joy the image of the
[1:34:00] fruits of the sphere how do they know
[1:34:01] yeah the anointing of God when we look
[1:34:04] into the things of God we're changing
[1:34:06] the very image of Christ as far as the
[1:34:08] spiritual image amen okay now I got a
[1:34:16] few more
[1:34:16] make sure I cover oh yeah its go to
[1:34:21] revelation three yeah since we're there
[1:34:22] let's go to Revelation Lee this is next
[1:34:24] one I want to cover about the nakedness
[1:34:25] here you're very familiar with it though
[1:34:27] I think revelation three I want to read
[1:34:37] the scripture about the latest in church
[1:34:39] age about the nakedness here now isn't a
[1:34:45] striking Church and everything I showed
[1:34:47] you in history about women undressing
[1:34:49] themselves isn't it striking it all
[1:34:51] happened in the Laodicean church teacher
[1:34:53] in that striking it didn't happen other
[1:34:56] church ages on this level this scale but
[1:35:00] at the end of the world and the church
[1:35:02] age was 1906 to current day and the
[1:35:06] 1900s the first decade was when the
[1:35:09] sleeves started coming up and God Artie
[1:35:11] then Jesus said naked in that's striking
[1:35:15] now we know it's course naturally naked
[1:35:18] and spiritually naked we know it's both
[1:35:21] because it's natural riches right and
[1:35:24] lacking spiritual riches
[1:35:26] okay now let's let's read their verse 17
[1:35:29] because thou says I'm rich and increased
[1:35:31] with Goods and have need of nothing
[1:35:32] knowest on that wretched and miserable
[1:35:34] poor blind and there it is naked now
[1:35:38] they're spiritually naked and naturally
[1:35:41] naked and so what does Jesus say I
[1:35:43] counsel thee so I want to sit down and
[1:35:46] have a counseling meeting with you and
[1:35:47] advise you to buy of me gold tried in
[1:35:50] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:35:52] white raiment that the may s be clothed
[1:35:54] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:35:56] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:35:59] eyesalve that thou mayest see see
[1:36:02] there's the facial cosmetics God wants
[1:36:04] you to have I Sal glory what's the ice
[1:36:08] what's eyeliner or eyeshadow is that
[1:36:10] what people put on see they got an all
[1:36:12] confuse that's just the perversion God
[1:36:14] wants you to have on ice al amen ice a
[1:36:17] health and fully clothed amen
[1:36:19] with the right robes of the
[1:36:20] righteousness of Jesus Christ in the
[1:36:22] strikin Satan such a pervert but he's
[1:36:25] such a pervert of God's Word he's not a
[1:36:28] creator he's a pervert or of God's
[1:36:30] Oh God so I'm giving you a better eyes
[1:36:32] and Saint said I'll give you prettier
[1:36:34] eyes you know it's just so sad these
[1:36:36] women that will email me and and and
[1:36:38] text me and make all these comments like
[1:36:40] oh we just need a little make-up to
[1:36:41] enhance our beauty
[1:36:43] how can you enhance any beauty that God
[1:36:46] made how can you as a dying human being
[1:36:50] of failing miserable human as we are
[1:36:53] we're all miserable dying you know that
[1:36:55] our flesh is abilities miserable right
[1:36:57] how can we as failures as human being
[1:37:01] ever make anything that God did any
[1:37:03] better the fact is we can't the fact is
[1:37:06] all humans do is copy God's design amen
[1:37:09] we uh we bought a book where they showed
[1:37:12] last year where man finally made a wave
[1:37:15] like an ocean wave and they were
[1:37:18] shouting and rejoicing and I think they
[1:37:20] estimate I think it was remember that
[1:37:21] book maokai yeah he remembers that book
[1:37:24] they were rejoicing all we made our
[1:37:26] first man-made wave and it looked like a
[1:37:29] real wave like a surfer could surf on
[1:37:31] and gods like I've been doing that for
[1:37:33] 6,000 years
[1:37:35] hey they they put it in a book that they
[1:37:39] pat him on the back that give them a
[1:37:40] warrant oh you made a wave and gods like
[1:37:42] I've already been doing this all this
[1:37:43] time see they worship the creature more
[1:37:47] than the Creator amen and they're
[1:37:50] spending their time trying to try and
[1:37:53] trying to do a god it why don't we just
[1:37:54] do what God tells us to do amen now
[1:37:57] there's nothing wrong with making a wave
[1:37:59] you know people like parks as long as
[1:38:00] they dress holy you know water parks
[1:38:02] what's wrong when there's nothing wrong
[1:38:04] with that the point I'm trying to make
[1:38:05] is that Satan's always perverting God's
[1:38:08] Word and God's creation with the high
[1:38:11] south and the nakedness and everything
[1:38:13] like that but let me show you did you
[1:38:15] know your souls naked until you're born
[1:38:16] again do you know do you know that the
[1:38:18] scripture says that it has no covering
[1:38:21] all all souls of Christians need a
[1:38:24] covering and it's called a spiritual
[1:38:26] white robe in other words it's the seal
[1:38:27] of the Holy Ghost so let's go to 2nd
[1:38:30] Corinthians 5 we read this a little bit
[1:38:33] on well we read it on the screen but we
[1:38:36] didn't read it in our Bibles how many
[1:38:40] don't I'm ok
[1:38:40] I'll probably let me give me about 50
[1:38:42] more minutes here
[1:38:44] hope it's been a blessing here so far by
[1:38:46] God's grace singer in these five verse
[1:38:52] one for we know that if our earthly
[1:38:54] house this Tabernacle were dissolved we
[1:38:56] have a building of God and house not
[1:38:58] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[1:39:03] that means Church there's already a
[1:39:06] theophany there waiting for you but the
[1:39:09] man said there are the theophanies and
[1:39:11] glorified bodies are there waiting for
[1:39:13] you now there's already a glorified body
[1:39:16] up there waiting for us
[1:39:18] verse 2 for in this we groan earnestly
[1:39:21] desiring to be clothed upon our house
[1:39:23] which is from all how I want to have a
[1:39:25] seat being Maya theophany oh how I want
[1:39:28] to be in my glorified body verse 3 if so
[1:39:32] that be being clothed we shall not be
[1:39:35] found see look at this naked without a
[1:39:38] theophany or without a glorified body
[1:39:40] spiritually a soul is naked the soul the
[1:39:45] soul has no covering it has no life
[1:39:48] right because the Holy Ghost is life in
[1:39:52] other words buh-bam said what represents
[1:39:54] life in heaven is a white robe so this
[1:39:56] is a soul that has no white robe now I
[1:39:58] don't know what that looks like I don't
[1:40:00] know if they have tattered garments on
[1:40:01] or if they're just I don't know I don't
[1:40:03] know all's I know is that eternal life
[1:40:05] is white robes and you're clothed you
[1:40:08] are born when you're born again you've
[1:40:10] already got your white robe amen
[1:40:12] well hallelujah that's exactly right see
[1:40:15] this is a scriptural verse for for we
[1:40:19] that are in this tabernacle do groan
[1:40:21] being burden not that we would be
[1:40:23] unclothed see but clothed upon that
[1:40:28] mortality might be swallowed up in life
[1:40:30] so our clothing is life eternal life
[1:40:34] praise God
[1:40:35] so a soul without eternal life is
[1:40:38] unclothed is unmake 'add so it's
[1:40:44] important for us to know that by God's
[1:40:45] grace and that ties in again it ties it
[1:40:47] with litleo see in church age they're
[1:40:49] rich increased with goods but are blind
[1:40:51] make miserable and naked these churches
[1:40:55] like this lukewarm churches or coached
[1:40:56] culture
[1:40:57] lukewarm sources they do not have the
[1:40:59] Holy Ghost they're not born again every
[1:41:02] see that and so their souls are naked
[1:41:04] according to the Word of God amen
[1:41:07] hope you like that that's one thing I
[1:41:08] just pulled out there I thought I'd make
[1:41:10] sure I told that by God's grace now I
[1:41:13] had a few more notes here Parman let me
[1:41:14] just look at them real quick I don't
[1:41:16] have time I had that extra mean I don't
[1:41:17] have time to get were they on here I
[1:41:18] wanted to do there's a naked soul okay
[1:41:24] oh yeah the fifth seal let's go to
[1:41:26] Revelation chapter 6 this is another
[1:41:28] example of not having a eternal life the
[1:41:33] Jews in this day if they die today
[1:41:35] they're faithful Jews if they're
[1:41:37] faithful they'll go to the martyrs altar
[1:41:39] in heaven and their souls will wait
[1:41:42] under the altar not yet clothed with
[1:41:45] white robes the white robes will come at
[1:41:47] the white throne judgment revelation 6
[1:41:53] now verse 9 tells us they were slain for
[1:41:56] the word of God not for the testimony of
[1:41:57] Jesus Christ the Word of God which means
[1:42:00] they're Jews and verse 10 shows they
[1:42:03] can't be Christians because they're
[1:42:04] asking for revenge and neither should
[1:42:06] you and I asked for revenge you should
[1:42:08] say Lord take vengeance upon mine
[1:42:10] enemies I'm not gonna take vengeance
[1:42:12] Lord you take vengeance now verse 11 and
[1:42:17] white robes were given unto every one of
[1:42:20] them and it was setting them that they
[1:42:21] should rest yet for a little season
[1:42:22] until their fellow-servants also and
[1:42:24] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:42:26] they were should be killed so see they
[1:42:29] don't get white robes until after they
[1:42:31] die but a Christian has it now while
[1:42:34] they're alive amen
[1:42:35] that's right we have it now according
[1:42:39] the Word of God our souls are not naked
[1:42:40] our souls are sealed our souls are
[1:42:42] marked and we have the clothing I
[1:42:45] remember jesus said in Luke 24:49
[1:42:47] he said when the Holy Ghost comes you'll
[1:42:50] be endued with power from on high and
[1:42:51] the word endued means clothed upon your
[1:42:55] souls clothed with power from on high
[1:42:57] amen oh they do yeah praise God that's
[1:43:01] exactly right
[1:43:03] now let me find a place to close
[1:43:09] I can either do an abomination
[1:43:14] let me just do the home life yeah let's
[1:43:16] go Deuteronomy chapter 6 let me just
[1:43:17] close I want to close with this thought
[1:43:18] about the home life I'll preach on the
[1:43:20] tents a few sundays ago two sundays ago
[1:43:23] let's just close that Deuteronomy
[1:43:24] chapter 6 because here's the burden that
[1:43:33] I saw when I was preaching a brother
[1:43:34] Brooks's church and by the Tim Hume
[1:43:35] search the burden I saw is that all the
[1:43:38] pastors wanted to see a revival in the
[1:43:40] home the people knew the message but
[1:43:43] their home life wasn't holy like it
[1:43:46] should have been in other words they let
[1:43:48] they made compromises and let's ending
[1:43:50] it in the homes so to make sure I go
[1:43:53] over this by the grace of the Lord go to
[1:43:57] verse 6 here and these words which I
[1:44:05] command you this day shall be in thine
[1:44:06] heart and thou shalt teach them
[1:44:08] diligently unto thy children and shalt
[1:44:10] talk of them when thou sittest in that
[1:44:12] house when thou walkest by the way when
[1:44:16] thou liest down when thou risest up now
[1:44:20] let's be honest with ourselves even live
[1:44:22] streamers and even everybody here let's
[1:44:24] be honest with ourselves are we sitting
[1:44:25] down and talking about the Lord all the
[1:44:27] time in our houses we should be if we're
[1:44:31] spending more time talking about worldly
[1:44:32] things and and what we need what we got
[1:44:34] to do if we're spending more time
[1:44:36] talking about that than the Word of God
[1:44:37] then we've broken the Word of God right
[1:44:40] we've broken it because this is what we
[1:44:44] should do we should surround ourselves
[1:44:45] fill our our mouths full our minds fill
[1:44:49] our lips fill everything with the Word
[1:44:52] of God amen it's a command this was a
[1:44:54] command in the Old Testament we're to
[1:44:57] teach them diligently to the children
[1:45:02] and when you're lying down when you're
[1:45:04] laid down you should pray before you go
[1:45:05] to bed right when you rise up you should
[1:45:08] start talk about Jesus right away when
[1:45:09] you rise up another lujah verse look at
[1:45:14] verse 8 now this is I love this and thou
[1:45:16] shalt bind them for a sign upon thine
[1:45:17] hand and they should be as frontlets
[1:45:19] between thy eyes they literally you know
[1:45:21] the
[1:45:23] about the Pharisees they literally put
[1:45:24] them on their hands and between their on
[1:45:26] their foreheads there's little boxes of
[1:45:28] Scripture they're called phylacteries
[1:45:30] they literally would wear these
[1:45:32] phylacteries that had scriptures written
[1:45:34] on a little paper and they would bind
[1:45:36] them literally because they took this
[1:45:38] literally now we should say God helped
[1:45:40] the Word of God to be constantly in my
[1:45:42] mind help you know like the Bible said
[1:45:45] marked in the forehead and all my
[1:45:47] thoughts be on the Word of God that all
[1:45:51] my works in my hands be to help out
[1:45:53] other people to be a real Christian
[1:45:55] that's right
[1:45:56] verse 9 and thou shalt write them upon
[1:45:59] the post of thy house and upon thy gates
[1:46:03] everywhere you look every door there's
[1:46:05] Jesus outside of that I say at the gate
[1:46:08] at the fence you see Jesus you want to
[1:46:11] see Jesus everywhere in your home praise
[1:46:12] God this is beautiful see a whole life
[1:46:17] is our life you and I are only as strong
[1:46:21] Christians as we live in our houses
[1:46:28] remember we looked at
[1:46:30] I'm sorry Joshua a few weeks ago for
[1:46:31] success was that last week but if this
[1:46:33] success Joshua said you're only gonna
[1:46:35] have success when you meditate on the
[1:46:38] word when you speak the word and when
[1:46:40] you obey the word you're only gonna have
[1:46:42] success in life when you do that it has
[1:46:45] to be a high tradition to be everything
[1:46:46] your life has to be about Jesus Jesus
[1:46:48] all the time
[1:46:49] you know my dad one time had a and often
[1:46:52] never forget this I'll just share this
[1:46:53] quick story my dad one time had a
[1:46:55] experience with God he was praying in
[1:46:58] his closet
[1:46:59] you know something said pick up he said
[1:47:00] what did Jesus say he went bought a
[1:47:01] Bible he started reading only led red
[1:47:04] letter words and he saw where Jesus said
[1:47:06] go in the closet you know my dad was a
[1:47:08] you know kind of verbally abused growing
[1:47:09] up because his name was Snooki and he
[1:47:11] was always made fun of and he still is
[1:47:12] made fun of by different people many
[1:47:16] ways he's like Wow
[1:47:17] jesus said go pray the closet so he did
[1:47:19] that he did it for like I think it was a
[1:47:20] couple months and he finally got the
[1:47:21] spot he got in there and he didn't feel
[1:47:23] nothing he said God where are you I've
[1:47:25] done this and I haven't heard your voice
[1:47:26] the next night he went in there this was
[1:47:29] Tori tells all my family all my brothers
[1:47:31] sisters he said when the moment he
[1:47:33] dropped to his knees he felt the holy
[1:47:35] presence of Jesus and it so scared him
[1:47:37] he ran out of the closet jumped on the
[1:47:40] bed tried to wake up my mom and wouldn't
[1:47:42] wake up he said when he laid there on
[1:47:44] the bed he said the Holy Spirit hid his
[1:47:46] feet and came through his feet all the
[1:47:48] way up through like a hot sensation and
[1:47:50] then hit went to the top of his head and
[1:47:53] then went all the way down and my dad
[1:47:56] showed me his Bibles afterwards almost
[1:47:58] every word was highlighting the Bible
[1:48:00] and circled he just had an insatiable
[1:48:02] appetite for the Word of God after that
[1:48:04] and he said he felt like you know he had
[1:48:07] smoked for years this was when he was in
[1:48:09] his 30s he said I'd smoked for years and
[1:48:11] after that went through me said I felt
[1:48:13] like I never smoked a cigarette in my
[1:48:14] life and he said he said Jesse he said
[1:48:18] he said when that Holy Ghost hit you at
[1:48:19] the bottom of your feet
[1:48:20] he said all she want to think about is
[1:48:22] Jesus all she want to talk about is
[1:48:24] Jesus and my dad for a while you know
[1:48:25] after I gave my life to Lord on a pastor
[1:48:27] he tried to make me feel like I wasn't
[1:48:29] born again because I never had that
[1:48:30] happen to me and I was little
[1:48:32] discouraged a little bit not for long
[1:48:37] but I said dad I said that's just your
[1:48:39] experience not everybody has to have
[1:48:41] that experience and I said here's how I
[1:48:44] know dad because I said dad the very
[1:48:47] next day you said you went out into the
[1:48:49] fewer farmer you went out into the field
[1:48:51] and when your farmer friends offered you
[1:48:53] cigarette and he you knew you shouldn't
[1:48:56] have did it but you had it anyway you
[1:48:57] went back to smoking and yet my dad
[1:49:00] would still read the Bible he said he
[1:49:01] knew it was wrong and he's like he's
[1:49:04] like yeah you're right Jesse I shouldn't
[1:49:05] have done that I said my dad I've never
[1:49:07] had the experience you had but I said
[1:49:09] I've shake I've got on my knees and I've
[1:49:11] shaken till I couldn't even hardly move
[1:49:13] because the Friends of God in my closet
[1:49:16] I've shaken at church services praying
[1:49:18] afterwards where I felt like my ribs
[1:49:20] were gonna just break because and it
[1:49:23] came on me three times one time my
[1:49:24] brother cams Church it felt like oh it
[1:49:27] felt like just a presence coming on me
[1:49:29] and then it would leave and then it came
[1:49:30] back and church when it came the third
[1:49:32] time I said God don't do it again I feel
[1:49:34] like I'm gonna die the presence of God
[1:49:37] come back so strong three times on me I
[1:49:39] never forget that you know why because I
[1:49:41] drove through the snow it was level
[1:49:42] three snow I think I drove through the
[1:49:45] snow from my house at cams Church going
[1:49:47] like 20 miles per hour fasting and
[1:49:49] praying all day and we preached it had
[1:49:52] some tremendous services that's how I
[1:49:54] remember and I said dad here's a
[1:49:55] difference you had that and you said all
[1:49:58] you can think about is Jesus I said but
[1:50:00] you went back to smoking I said I didn't
[1:50:02] have that but now all I can do is think
[1:50:05] about Jesus and I've got the same result
[1:50:07] except I got more results because he
[1:50:10] never he stopped going to church he
[1:50:11] never went to church he never got same
[1:50:13] device a dead I'm not only justified I'm
[1:50:15] sanctified
[1:50:16] I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I see
[1:50:18] miracles I'm preaching out every three
[1:50:20] times a week I said I've got just as
[1:50:22] much I've got more than you had amen
[1:50:25] see he just had an experience he just
[1:50:27] had an anointing where God was trying to
[1:50:29] clean him out but the point is when
[1:50:31] Christ comes in you all you want to hear
[1:50:33] about is Jesus all the time
[1:50:34] amen your home Jesus your cause Jesus
[1:50:38] your phone Jesus everything you think
[1:50:41] about is Jesus amen
[1:50:42] that's all it is and my dad can relate
[1:50:45] to that to a degree because he's had an
[1:50:48] experience with God and I had a simmer
[1:50:51] experience of course I'd never I never
[1:50:52] had to go through me like he did but I
[1:50:54] felt where I couldn't like I was gonna
[1:50:55] die because there was such a holy
[1:50:57] presence there three times one after
[1:50:59] another so you see this is what we have
[1:51:02] to have we have to have a life at home
[1:51:05] that matches our life at church so how
[1:51:09] many like to come to church you know
[1:51:10] Frasier I don't like to come to church
[1:51:11] and raise your hands and pray I do I
[1:51:13] love to do that but guess what if I do
[1:51:16] in a church and don't do it at home
[1:51:17] that's hypocrisy
[1:51:19] can you say Amen George
[1:51:22] see that's right and that's why we know
[1:51:24] too when people come to church and don't
[1:51:26] enjoy the preaching don't enjoy the
[1:51:29] prayers and the songs it's because
[1:51:31] they're in sin something has compromised
[1:51:33] in their home because the church will
[1:51:37] only be as strong as our whole lives are
[1:51:40] because where did where did God tell
[1:51:42] Moses where you got to have God at just
[1:51:44] at the tabernacle he said put it in your
[1:51:46] home that's right and any death in a
[1:51:51] home made everything unclean from the
[1:51:53] waters of separation sermon we preached
[1:51:55] on recently this is why it's so
[1:51:57] important our homes have to stay a
[1:52:01] sanctified holy place for Christ
[1:52:04] now go to Matthew 23 I'm going to end
[1:52:06] with this well I'm going along and I
[1:52:07] thought Matthew 23 verse 25 and I felt
[1:52:16] that
[1:52:17] wonderful services Sunday my prayers
[1:52:19] life has been renewed at home maybe I
[1:52:23] don't know how to explain to you but
[1:52:24] I've just been eager to pray and that's
[1:52:27] how we we should we should have that
[1:52:28] more and more all the time all these
[1:52:32] things that really helped me by God's
[1:52:33] grace Matthew 23 25 and you know how it
[1:52:38] is sure Tommy Noah as Christians we go
[1:52:40] through battles which means we go up and
[1:52:41] down up and down up and down but I'm
[1:52:44] just saying if we're seeing long
[1:52:45] stretches of time where people are we're
[1:52:47] living in sin we're not having eagerness
[1:52:49] to pray we're not enjoying reading our
[1:52:51] Bibles it's time to check up and make
[1:52:53] sure we're clothed with the Holy Ghost
[1:52:55] we don't want to be naked wretched
[1:52:57] miserable blind we don't want to be like
[1:52:59] that we want the Holy Ghost I south we
[1:53:02] want the Holy Ghost gold amen
[1:53:04] we with the Holy Ghost white raiment
[1:53:06] amen our lives must match what we do at
[1:53:09] church that's right
[1:53:13] Matthew 25 I was re 23 25 army look what
[1:53:18] he says here what when you scribes and
[1:53:19] Pharisees hypocrites for you make clean
[1:53:21] the outside of the cup and of the
[1:53:22] platter but within they are full of
[1:53:24] extortion and excess now does that
[1:53:29] remind us of churches today could be
[1:53:30] message church any church people come to
[1:53:32] church and every single hair is in place
[1:53:35] and they can and the Pharisees dress
[1:53:38] holy we can dress perfectly holy come to
[1:53:41] church looking holy you can be totally
[1:53:43] clean on the outside and be dead on the
[1:53:46] inside because you're just people are
[1:53:49] just putting on a show it's true that's
[1:53:55] the latest in lukewarm spirit they're
[1:53:57] blind miserable naked and don't even
[1:53:59] know they think that because they come
[1:54:01] to church and have a nice outward
[1:54:03] appearance that God accepts them well
[1:54:04] that's part of it but what's more
[1:54:06] important is our inward condition see
[1:54:11] the Pharisees had it down and that's why
[1:54:13] we got a lot of modern day Pharisees
[1:54:14] they come to church you shake their hand
[1:54:16] they look like they're happy but the
[1:54:19] main thing is that they get happy with
[1:54:20] the word if they get happy with the word
[1:54:22] there must be happy in Christ because
[1:54:24] Christ is the word amen some people
[1:54:27] can't even say men or can't even raise
[1:54:28] their hands or
[1:54:29] never come up for prayer or never spend
[1:54:31] time praying or sir loving the loving
[1:54:34] God or enjoying the services
[1:54:35] something's wrong if you don't love this
[1:54:37] like you did when you were first save
[1:54:39] you've got to get back to the first love
[1:54:41] amen
[1:54:42] you have to because you're a church
[1:54:45] experience is just a reflection of your
[1:54:47] home experience it is because the church
[1:54:50] is a home as well
[1:54:52] the church is a spiritual home your home
[1:54:55] is your natural home look at this here
[1:54:59] so beautiful on the outside but full of
[1:55:05] uncleanness look in verse 26 now blind
[1:55:07] Pharisee cleanse first that which is
[1:55:08] within the cup and the plan that the
[1:55:10] outside then may also be clean won't you
[1:55:14] scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye
[1:55:15] are like unto whited Sepulcher --zz
[1:55:17] which appear indeed appear beautiful
[1:55:20] outward but are full of dead men's bones
[1:55:22] and all uncleanness now what was the
[1:55:24] scribe Church a scribe with somebody who
[1:55:26] copied the Bible these people would copy
[1:55:30] the Bible all day and Jesus says you're
[1:55:32] full of deadness and that's the point
[1:55:36] we're making where people say well I
[1:55:37] listen the message but yet they worship
[1:55:39] brother Branham all I do is listen to
[1:55:41] the message that's fine but see people
[1:55:43] can do that too they can copy the Bible
[1:55:46] they can be fully it seems like in the
[1:55:47] word all the way but are they living the
[1:55:50] word of the hour see the Pharisees
[1:55:52] weren't living the word of the hour so
[1:55:54] the question is are we living the word
[1:55:55] of the hour amen are we actually living
[1:55:59] what brother Branham said are we living
[1:56:01] what Jesus taught us in the scripture
[1:56:04] that's the real test
[1:56:06] verse 28 for even ye also outwardly
[1:56:09] appear righteous unto men but within
[1:56:11] you're full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:56:17] alright so see that they had excess so
[1:56:21] when they when they go home they have
[1:56:23] extortion which is kind of like stealing
[1:56:26] like money laundering excess is having
[1:56:31] excess enjoyment for sin right so a
[1:56:35] church they don't sin but when they get
[1:56:36] home they sin never be with me when they
[1:56:40] come to church they're clean clear the
[1:56:43] West
[1:56:43] well look at that sister ma she got a
[1:56:45] brand new skirt off good for her what
[1:56:48] her hair is so clean well brother you've
[1:56:50] got a brand new tie on and some money
[1:56:51] you bought this for me so thank you I
[1:56:53] having a new tie out but some of you
[1:56:55] bought it for me what do you want maybe
[1:56:57] I don't know they're here tonight but
[1:57:00] see that's all they see but that's not
[1:57:03] the real person the real person is what
[1:57:05] you are at home it's a real person and
[1:57:09] that's why these things even on modesty
[1:57:10] you know it's important but the real
[1:57:12] modesty is we sell in Sunday night the
[1:57:13] real modesty is your submission to
[1:57:15] Christ your modest opinion of herself
[1:57:18] I'm really not that great I'm really not
[1:57:20] that great of a person I have to rely
[1:57:22] upon Jesus I've got to submit myself to
[1:57:24] every word of God I've got to constantly
[1:57:26] die daily and just cling to the word
[1:57:28] that's exactly right church they're full
[1:57:33] of uncleanness hypocrisy and iniquity so
[1:57:37] when they go home that's where they sin
[1:57:39] when they're a church they look nice too
[1:57:42] they look nice to everybody it's nice I
[1:57:44] don't want to be one of those type of
[1:57:46] people Matthew six lamb with that
[1:57:51] Matthew six that's why the Bible says
[1:57:54] examine yourselves before communion
[1:57:56] examine yourselves and see if you're in
[1:57:59] the faith do I do it i do excess and
[1:58:02] sins at home do I do the things at home
[1:58:04] I wouldn't do a church it shouldn't be
[1:58:06] that way we should live at home the same
[1:58:09] way we live at church the same way we
[1:58:12] act in the fellowship room owner that's
[1:58:13] the same way we should act at home right
[1:58:16] the same way we act when we're singing
[1:58:19] here is the same way we should act at
[1:58:20] home it has to be the same it can't be a
[1:58:23] different life this is what the
[1:58:24] Pharisees had mastered they could live
[1:58:26] and sin at home but then a church they
[1:58:28] look like they're just so righteous and
[1:58:30] holy and clean no they weren't Matthew
[1:58:35] 6:5 and this is for me
[1:58:38] but I'm gonna have time but member and
[1:58:42] verse to Hippocrates love to go out in
[1:58:45] the streets and get praise and give
[1:58:46] things to people out in public where the
[1:58:49] real Christian does it in secret
[1:58:51] see it's all this public its outward
[1:58:53] they can put on a real nice outward
[1:58:56] public show now verse five when thou
[1:58:59] praise be not as the hypocrites are they
[1:59:01] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[1:59:02] in the corners of the streets that they
[1:59:04] may be seen a men verily send to you
[1:59:07] they have their reward if your favorite
[1:59:11] pray place to pray is only at church
[1:59:14] when sister Cody's watching or Lydia's
[1:59:18] watching something's wrong with our walk
[1:59:21] with God we are total hypocrites right
[1:59:25] now my favorite place to pray is right
[1:59:28] here but it's when nobody's here I'd
[1:59:31] love to look up at Jesus and pray I turn
[1:59:34] the lights off it made me music I just
[1:59:36] love to talk to him and I just all by
[1:59:37] myself that's my favorite place so I
[1:59:40] could say I like to pray a church but
[1:59:42] it's what no one else is here just Jesus
[1:59:45] and I but what did Jesus say hypocrites
[1:59:47] only want to pray when brother Adam is
[1:59:49] watching right they just want to when
[1:59:52] somebody's around that they know that's
[1:59:54] when they love to pray the most and I
[1:59:57] told you before I've got a bow that I'm
[1:59:58] constantly praying before people
[1:59:59] constantly every service I'm praying
[2:00:01] three or five times a service I've got
[2:00:03] to constantly make sure that I love my
[2:00:05] prayers at home just as much as the
[2:00:07] prayers here because I don't want to be
[2:00:11] a hypocrite I don't wanna be a Pharisee
[2:00:12] I don't put on an outward appearance but
[2:00:16] my inward part is full of excess and
[2:00:18] iniquity now let's enter our feet this
[2:00:22] thought I heard a brother say this
[2:00:24] recently Judas had such a Judas hid his
[2:00:28] sin so well memory had a thief sorry I
[2:00:30] don't remember that he was such a thief
[2:00:32] and he never repented of his love for
[2:00:35] stealing and money but he hid it so well
[2:00:40] right he hid it so well that when Jesus
[2:00:43] said one of you betrayed me at the at
[2:00:45] the Last Supper he said one of you will
[2:00:47] betray me he hid it so well that all the
[2:00:50] other guys look at themselves
[2:00:52] nor does it me they didn't all say
[2:00:54] always Judas I saw him last week
[2:00:56] stealing from the treasurer finally that
[2:01:00] serpent seed is caught get him out of
[2:01:02] here Jesus no he hit it so well for two
[2:01:07] how many years he was there two and
[2:01:09] three he did it so well that they didn't
[2:01:11] even know it when he left they didn't
[2:01:12] even know he was going to betray Christ
[2:01:17] so see how the Bible see why it's
[2:01:19] important the Bible says make sure you
[2:01:22] talk about Jesus when you go to bed when
[2:01:25] you rise up at the dinner table let's
[2:01:29] not make Donald Trump the main
[2:01:32] discussion at the dinner table or a
[2:01:37] late-night talk show or whatever let's
[2:01:39] not make that that that can maybe just
[2:01:42] be talked about in passing what you see
[2:01:44] Trump do this or see the news there our
[2:01:45] main topic of discussion should be Jesus
[2:01:48] what does Jesus done first lately is it
[2:01:52] on our door frames is Jesus on our gates
[2:01:55] the main thing is Jesus is Jesus on our
[2:01:58] hearts is Jesus on our minds or -
[2:02:02] carried away in too many things it's
[2:02:04] okay to think about the future and and
[2:02:06] business and and money and for me you
[2:02:08] know education and teaching it's okay to
[2:02:10] think about those things but the whole
[2:02:12] motivation behind it is how can I do
[2:02:14] this to glorify Christ how can I do this
[2:02:17] into honest the most honest way and the
[2:02:20] most diligent way how can I work for my
[2:02:23] lord if Jesus was my principal how would
[2:02:25] I teach then Oh glory see that it had
[2:02:31] our home life has to be our life and has
[2:02:36] to be the right life and then we know
[2:02:40] that we're right with the Lord remember
[2:02:45] pure religion is visiting the widows and
[2:02:47] fatherless in their afflictions and
[2:02:49] keeping yourself unspotted from Laodicea
[2:02:52] praise God
[2:02:53] let's bow our heads in word of Prayer
[2:02:54] here I'll stop right there I went a lot
[2:02:57] longer than I thought I was going to go
[2:02:59] parmie I hope it was a blessing tonight
[2:03:02] by the grace of God like I said I want
[2:03:04] to keep looking at this
[2:03:05] modesty and things and then I wanted to
[2:03:08] bring that little thought there kind of
[2:03:10] a chopped-up message but like I said
[2:03:12] I've had four witnesses this week about
[2:03:15] modesty and holiness and everything like
[2:03:17] that let's just take a moment let's
[2:03:19] think about our lives for a moment
[2:03:22] Heavenly Father all we bow our heads
[2:03:24] Lord God Lord as we said help us to be
[2:03:28] modest in our hearts
[2:03:29] help us to be modest in our estimation
[2:03:31] of our own abilities dear God help us to
[2:03:34] remember we have no ability we have no
[2:03:37] strength of ourselves we need you Lord
[2:03:39] God even these topics today Lord most of
[2:03:43] us dress modestly Lord my girls swam
[2:03:48] very modestly this weekend
[2:03:50] my son had long pants on and not a shirt
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:56] or none of us probably here wear makeup
[2:03:58] or paying our face and loan that
[2:04:03] qualifies us as having a beautiful
[2:04:05] outward appearance but tonight as we
[2:04:08] close or we want again remember these
[2:04:09] things that Judas and the Pharisees seem
[2:04:12] to have in beautiful outward appearance
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] they were able to hide their iniquity
[2:04:20] hide their excess or they're able to
[2:04:25] hide that Lord from everyone except
[2:04:29] Jesus and when I say like this Lord I
[2:04:34] hope our sins are hidden so well that
[2:04:35] you're the only one who can make us
[2:04:38] aware of them Lord God but we won't
[2:04:42] Lord keep them hid we will confess them
[2:04:45] and expose any wrongs in our lives
[2:04:50] we don't want to be hypocrites we don't
[2:04:52] want to be full of dead men's bones we
[2:04:56] want to be filled with life we want to
[2:05:00] have the white robe of eternal life
[2:05:02] a man we want to be clothed upon with
[2:05:04] eternal life Jesus Lord let us take it
[2:05:11] take examination Lord if if in our homes
[2:05:15] if we're not talking about Jesus more if
[2:05:17] we're not Lord reading and enjoying the
[2:05:20] prayer life if we only love to pray at
[2:05:22] church lord help us to make that right
[2:05:26] lord help us to have the right attitude
[2:05:28] lord help us to look forward to going
[2:05:30] into the closet tonight or tomorrow and
[2:05:33] just having time alone with you Lord God
[2:05:38] you commanded Moses and said talk about
[2:05:41] it all the time think about it all the

[2:06:00] word help us Lord God as my dad taught
[2:06:05] me long ago when you get the anointing
[2:06:08] of the Holy Ghost and all you want to do
[2:06:09] is love Jesus I know your prophet said
[2:06:13] the same exact thing oh god help us to
[2:06:16] Love You Lord God help us to think about

[2:06:21] more glory and let our home life become
[2:06:29] more godly dear Lord that we can bring
[2:06:34] that anointing that we have at home we
[2:06:36] can bring that all to the house of God
