[1:44] be sharing a little bit about that but I
[1:46] just preached on the future home so uh
[1:48] I'm going to post that on YouTube if you
[1:49] haven't listened to that for a while
[1:50] it's a real blessing three and a half
[1:52] hour sermon from brother Brandon it's a
[1:54] tremendous message uh he said he lived
[1:57] off of it for two weeks so I can see why
[1:59] it's it's a tremendous uh sermon with so
[2:02] many types you know the Old Testament

[2:05] promises that await us hallelujah Bible

[2:21] Revelation 10:9 we'll read that
[2:24] first I'd like to preach this morning on
[2:27] eat the book Hallelujah eat the book
[2:29] just a simple thought as we see uh in
[2:31] these three portions of scripture eat
[2:33] the book Hallelujah let's read this
[2:36] verse together ready 1 two 3 and I went
[2:39] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[2:42] the little book and he said unto me take
[2:46] it and eat it up and it shall make thy
[2:49] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[2:52] mouth sweet as honey amen uh go to
[2:55] Jeremiah 15:16 if you have your bible
[2:57] Jeremiah 15:16
[3:00] as I studied this I realized there's at
[3:02] least three portions of scripture where
[3:04] God literally says eat the
[3:07] book Jeremiah
[3:16] 1516 I'd like you to read this one with
[3:18] me too if you could let's read this on
[3:20] three one two three thy words were found
[3:23] and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto
[3:27] me the joy and rejoicing of of Mine
[3:30] Heart for I'm called by thy name oh Lord
[3:34] God of hosts and one more Ezekiel 3:3
[3:37] thank you for all your turning and all
[3:39] your reading Ezekiel 3
[3:52] verse3 Ezekiel 3 verse three let's read
[3:54] that ready one two three and he said
[3:57] unto me son of man cause thy belly to
[4:01] eat and fill thy boughs with this roll
[4:05] that I give thee then did I eat it and
[4:09] it was in my mouth as honey for
[4:12] sweetness may God add his Blessing to
[4:14] ring of his word you can be seated
[4:15] praise God brother you sang Honey in the
[4:17] Rock and then you sing that that eating
[4:19] song The Bread song I'm like you're in
[4:21] the right channel I'm in the right
[4:23] channel it's great to be in the right
[4:24] channel amen but it's comforting to know
[4:26] if I'm in the wrong Channel he can
[4:27] straighten me out praise God Hallelujah
[4:30] so I want to preach this morning on eat
[4:32] the book uh just simple thought I've you
[4:34] know I think I've had this thought
[4:34] waiting on the wings for months and just
[4:36] kind of waiting for the right time but
[4:38] as I listen to sermons you know these
[4:40] last few days I listened to a message of
[4:42] Grace again and uh I just thought well I
[4:44] think I'll go to this thought here uh
[4:46] it's good thought and just a just to tie
[4:48] numerous prophets together here uh by
[4:51] God's grace so again we're coming off a
[4:53] wonderful weekend last weekend uh
[4:54] keeping our first love and just want to
[4:56] tell you how much I appreciate
[4:57] everybody's support for those services
[4:59] and let's keep our first love by God's
[5:01] grace Hallelujah let's remember those
[5:03] prayers last week let's remember your
[5:04] time seeking God and let's seek more of
[5:06] God today by the grace of God hallelujah
[5:09] and then Wednesday we looked at the
[5:10] message of Grace just an encouraging
[5:12] message there about God's grace to Noah
[5:14] and us and Abraham and uh how God God Is
[5:17] With Us despite our mistakes praise God
[5:19] God's not going to give up on us uh
[5:21] there's nothing special about us what's
[5:23] special is God gave us Grace that we
[5:25] found Grace
[5:27] Hallelujah like just like Jeremiah said
[5:29] we found the role Hallelujah God helped
[5:32] us find the scriptures Hallelujah and
[5:34] that's God's Amazing Grace to us I want
[5:36] to say this too you know yesterday you
[5:38] know we we were close to my wife's
[5:40] grandmother and just the reminder about
[5:42] how death is so real and I just want to
[5:44] give a reminder and I was uh as I woke
[5:46] up this morning I just as I was brushing
[5:48] my teeth and whatever you know going to
[5:51] I just listened to a uh I listened to a
[5:53] funeral from a message Church down in
[5:54] Louisiana brother the Tim fruits church
[5:56] and a 55y old man man died this week
[5:59] unexpected expected me um and I just
[6:01] like what brother Tim was saying at the
[6:03] end of the sermon you I had it on two
[6:04] speed you know just I could get through
[6:05] it um he said just slow down and enjoy
[6:09] every moment you have with your loved
[6:11] ones so I just thought you know that was
[6:13] kind of two witnesses you know just
[6:14] let's remember just enjoy every moment
[6:16] he said you know many times we just rush
[6:18] through life and everything's a rush we
[6:19] got to rush to get back we got to rush
[6:21] to do this let's just today let's just
[6:23] enjoy the time that we have with one
[6:24] another by God's grace let's uh be
[6:27] thankful with the time that we have I
[6:28] thought it was such a good reminder um
[6:31] I'm so glad we got to go see you know we
[6:33] went we made time to go see a lane you
[6:35] know back in December uh we just made
[6:38] time to do it because I realized and
[6:40] we're not perfect I'm not perfect but
[6:42] you know uh we have to remember that
[6:43] let's make time to spend time with the
[6:45] people that really matter to us by God's
[6:48] grace so just keep that in mind I just
[6:51] thought that was a good reminder let's
[6:53] let's enjoy this service let's not be in
[6:54] a rush to get out of this service that
[6:56] doesn't mean I need to preach two hours
[6:57] right um but just let's just enjoy the
[7:00] moment here by God's grace I'm going to
[7:02] set a timer here I'm starting my hour
[7:04] now okay uh usually go an hour and a
[7:06] half on Sunday but we'll see how it goes
[7:08] here today so let's enjoy this time that
[7:10] we have together um oh yeaha was up here
[7:13] and she said I I forget how long she
[7:14] might have been like up here in an hour
[7:16] she said it felt like 20 minutes and
[7:18] don't you think so you know I think it
[7:19] was like a four four hour service last
[7:21] Sunday morning it felt like 15 minutes
[7:23] it didn't feel long you know when you're
[7:24] in the spirit those things don't feel
[7:26] long uh it's such a joy to be in the
[7:29] presence of the Lord amen so we're
[7:32] thankful so I want to just start off
[7:33] just let's look at the symbolism of
[7:35] eating here uh Webster defines eating
[7:37] you know we're very familiar with it
[7:39] right we eat all the time and uh to take
[7:41] in through the mouth to ingest to
[7:44] swallow in turn or to
[7:47] consume uh so we know what eating is you
[7:50] know we know it's it's a slowly breaking
[7:52] up of something in our mouth and then uh
[7:54] it becomes a part of us and uh you know
[7:57] eating symbolizes the most intimate act
[8:01] right because you have to do this in
[8:03] order to live it's the most intimate
[8:05] thing that you do is eat uh uh because
[8:08] you're you're taking in something
[8:09] something died so you could live brother
[8:11] Ram tells us hallelujah something must
[8:14] die so you can live and you're becoming
[8:17] one with something right I told you my
[8:19] testimony I I became one with too much
[8:21] sugar so it looked like I had polka dots
[8:23] all over my feet all right I was
[8:25] becoming one with the wrong thing
[8:28] physically but thank God I become one
[8:30] with the right thing spiritually by
[8:32] God's grace and so that was a good
[8:34] lesson to me you know I really got to be
[8:36] careful what I take in you know in the
[8:38] natural because you're going to become
[8:40] one with it right uh and what what a
[8:43] more important thing it is spiritually
[8:45] praise God to take in the right thing
[8:47] and that's what we do as Christians we
[8:49] take in the right thing Hallelujah we
[8:50] take in the word of God on at least
[8:52] three times a week in Services praise
[8:54] God but we should be taking it in every
[8:56] single day Hallelujah you should be
[8:59] eating the word of God drinking the Holy
[9:01] Spirit each and every day by the grace
[9:03] of God find a song that's a new song a
[9:05] fresh song and that's why the Bible said
[9:07] sing to him a new song Make It new and
[9:10] it's like a it's like a new food or it's
[9:11] like a new taste it's like a new
[9:13] experience by God's grace amen you know
[9:15] you you ever find a new restaurant oh I
[9:17] love that or when we found BB Bop it's a
[9:19] new feeling you know we found uh I heard
[9:22] they got soy so maybe we're not going to
[9:24] be going there so much but uh you know
[9:26] you find a new something new and oh it
[9:28] just excites you you know you're excited
[9:30] to put this new thing into you right and
[9:32] that's how the word of God should be it
[9:34] should be something new that we want to
[9:35] put into ourselves amen hallelujah and
[9:37] because it is new every day remember
[9:39] God's bread and the shoe bread it was
[9:41] replaced every week so it was new all
[9:43] the time it was always fresh God's word
[9:46] is always fresh Hallelujah we must keep
[9:48] it that way we must remember that
[9:49] because enemy tries to make us forget
[9:51] God's word is always fresh and new
[9:53] Hallelujah when I listen uh it was
[9:56] Thursday with Casa uh when I listen to
[9:58] the Future home I'm like my it feels
[9:59] like I have never listened this sermon
[10:01] before that's how fresh God keeps his
[10:03] word hallelujah I've heard it before I
[10:05] preached it before but just hearing it
[10:07] again it's like oh I feel like I'm right
[10:09] there amen hallelujah I feel like I'm
[10:11] right there saying Amen brother
[10:12] Bram Hallelujah we are going to a future
[10:15] home amen there is a New Jerusalem
[10:18] Hallelujah that we're going to
[10:20] Hallelujah brother manam said we'll walk
[10:22] up and down those streets he said
[10:24] there's Avenues in heaven uh he he said
[10:27] uh he said there's a River of Life and
[10:29] we'll walk walk up and and he said and
[10:30] Jesus will walk up with us and give us a
[10:32] drink of the Waters of life because the
[10:35] Bible said we'll walk with him in white
[10:38] Hallelujah so you'll get to stroll that
[10:41] future home with your lord and savior I
[10:44] don't know how he's going to do that
[10:45] with all these billions of Christians
[10:46] amen but he can do it hallelujah amen if
[10:49] anybody can do it it's Jesus Hallelujah
[10:52] so we uh I just want to basically lay
[10:54] this a simple Foundation uh you know
[10:56] Matthew
[10:57] 26:26 said as they were eating this is
[11:00] the last supper Jesus Took bread and
[11:01] blessed think of it his last moments on
[11:04] Earth before he dies what did he do he
[11:07] had communion we had it on uh in July
[11:10] 14th was it not if I'm not
[11:13] mistaken so if if if if he could have
[11:15] done one last thing before he left this
[11:17] Earth what would he do he would sit down
[11:19] and have a meal with you and he would
[11:22] eat with
[11:23] you think think how important is when we
[11:25] get to Fellowship together and just eat
[11:27] together right or just have communion
[11:29] the Lord's Supper it is one of the most
[11:31] sacred and special things that we can
[11:33] possibly do Jesus didn't say hey let
[11:36] let's go for a vacation let's go hike up
[11:38] a Mount of Olives or something like that
[11:40] let's let's go for a quick uh getaway
[11:42] now we we appreciate vacations they can
[11:44] be refreshing but he said let's just
[11:46] have an intimate meal together and then
[11:49] the Bible said Jesus broke the bread and
[11:51] blessed it and gave it to the disciples
[11:52] and said take eat this is my body and he
[11:54] took the cup and gave thanks uh and gave
[11:57] it to them and said drink ye all of it
[11:59] praise God hallelujah so we we see
[12:01] eating and drinking together giving
[12:03] thanks is something we should do he said
[12:06] this is the blood of my uh new testament
[12:08] which is shed for many for the remission
[12:10] of sins Hallelujah but I say unto you I
[12:13] will not drink henceforth of this fruit
[12:16] of this Vine until the day when I drink
[12:18] it new with you in my father's Kingdom
[12:20] and when they had sung and hymn they
[12:22] went out into the Mount of Olives so
[12:25] eating drinking giving thanks singing
[12:28] Hallelujah that's what Jesus wants to do
[12:30] with us hallelujah now he said I'm not
[12:32] going to do it in the natural but he
[12:34] told us do it in the spiritual praise
[12:36] God and do that until I come back
[12:39] Hallelujah and by doing that you'll
[12:41] remember what I've done amen you'll
[12:44] remember me Jesus if you do what I did
[12:47] with my disciples Hallelujah so here we
[12:49] see the symbolism of eating and Paul
[12:51] calls it the the communion of the body
[12:53] of Christ Hallelujah he says it in 1
[12:56] Corinthians 10:16 the cup of blessings
[12:59] you've been blessed right since July
[13:01] 14th when you had communion you've been
[13:02] blessed because it's the cup of blessing
[13:04] hallelujah it's the plate it's the food
[13:07] of a blessing the cup of blessing which
[13:09] we bless is it not the communion of the
[13:11] blood of Christ the bread which we break
[13:13] isn't not the communion of the body of
[13:16] Christ for we being many are one bread
[13:18] and one body for we are all partakers of
[13:22] that one bread sometimes I think we
[13:24] forget how powerful communion is the
[13:27] Catholics have a high thought of it and
[13:28] they 've got the wrong thought their
[13:31] thought is as long as that's in me I'm
[13:33] I'm you know think about this it's
[13:35] almost like a a a it's almost like a
[13:37] cartoon they think as soon as they drink
[13:38] it like they get some power it changes
[13:40] them you know like a cartoon character
[13:42] or something like that that's what they
[13:44] actually think and they have that in
[13:46] their mind but it's it's true in one way
[13:48] in a spiritual sense when we believe the
[13:51] word of God when we obey the word of God
[13:53] it gives us Supernatural strength praise
[13:55] God it gives us a spiritual Focus
[13:59] Hallelujah where we're now we have
[14:01] spiritual power amen we don't have to be
[14:03] spiritually weak because we're eating on
[14:05] the spiritual life of God
[14:08] hallelujah we don't have to be
[14:09] discouraged we don't have to be
[14:10] distressed we don't have to be depressed
[14:12] we don't have to be worried because
[14:14] we're taking life into us it's the
[14:16] communion of blessing hallelujah amen
[14:18] that's what it does to us and thank God
[14:20] for the reminders that we need
[14:23] Hallelujah the word communion to uh uh
[14:25] in the Greek means a partnership it's
[14:28] the cup of partn parip when we partake
[14:30] of that communion it's saying Lord I'm
[14:33] partnering with you Hallelujah like we
[14:35] heard last week I'm letting you drive my
[14:37] my vehicle right I'm letting you direct
[14:39] my life
[14:40] Hallelujah I I don't have the ability to
[14:43] direct my life I would surely steer the
[14:46] wrong way like Cas and I saw that car on
[14:48] the side of the road they steered the
[14:49] wrong way last last night that that's
[14:52] how we would do it if we take control of
[14:54] Our Lives we're going to go into the
[14:55] ditch we're going to make a mess of it
[14:57] but we give it over to God we let God
[15:00] have the the the the the leadership in
[15:02] our lives and we have partnership with
[15:04] him thank God he lets us sit in the
[15:06] front seat with him amen hallelujah can
[15:07] I say like that or you'll take the back
[15:09] seat whatever you want just sit in the
[15:10] car with Christ Hallelujah whatever
[15:13] spiritual type you want to use amen
[15:15] hallelujah it's the communion it's the
[15:18] partnership of blessing it also means a
[15:20] fellowship hallelujah it's remember we
[15:23] do these things to remember we eat to
[15:26] remember you know because so often in
[15:28] this life we forget forget how God how
[15:30] close God is we forget how good God's
[15:32] been to us so this is a cup of memory
[15:35] this is a eating and drinking so we
[15:37] remember Hallelujah because we don't
[15:39] want to forget all the blessings God has
[15:41] given to us amen and we don't want to
[15:44] forget the future blessings
[15:46] Hallelujah I just loved Austin's
[15:48] testimony you know how the Lord last
[15:49] week at the altar showed him you know he
[15:51] went back to that moment you know when
[15:53] when when the parents are arguing and in
[15:54] that moment of pain God helps brother
[15:56] Austin see I was right there with you
[15:58] the whole
[15:59] time Hallelujah that that Fellowship God
[16:02] was trying to Fellowship God was being a
[16:04] comfort God was there Hallelujah and we
[16:06] remember we always remember God's with
[16:09] us hallelujah no matter what we go
[16:11] through God is with us
[16:13] hallelujah remember there's that part we
[16:15] we want to know him in the power of his
[16:16] resurrection we want to see resurrection
[16:18] power but we also remember we must be
[16:20] partakers of his sufferings as well
[16:23] that's part of the cup hallelujah
[16:25] hallelujah wine uh as we as we saw a few
[16:28] months ago wine can be pretty bitter the
[16:29] church said Hallelujah not all wine is
[16:33] sweet but wine can be bitter amen it
[16:36] could be a bitter cup Hallelujah at
[16:38] times but we do all this we eat to
[16:41] remember that's why we come to church to
[16:43] remember God's
[16:44] promises and also to hear new ones right
[16:46] the Scribe brings new and old we'll hear
[16:48] a new scripture we never heard before Oh
[16:50] that's that's fresh but also the old
[16:52] ones both the new and old help us
[16:54] remember the promises of God it REM
[16:57] helps us remember that we are in
[16:59] partnership with God God want God is
[17:01] working with me and he's going to work
[17:02] through me praise God hallelujah you are
[17:06] having an impact on people praise God
[17:08] whether you know it or not whether you
[17:09] see it or not you are hallelujah amen I
[17:13] was reminded that yesterday people I saw
[17:15] some of my high school friends and and
[17:17] they they said they learned things about
[17:18] me and I learned things about them
[17:20] Hallelujah and they they can see God
[17:22] working with me they can see God uh
[17:24] working in me and and I can see God
[17:26] working in them hallelujah how do you
[17:28] see by their fruits by their their
[17:30] decisions uh by their choices praise God
[17:33] but that's why we eat to remember the
[17:35] Lord Jesus Christ and remember you know
[17:37] eating is also symbolic of marriage
[17:40] relations uh in the Song of Solomon 4:16
[17:43] it says awake Oh north wind and Come
[17:45] Thou South blow upon my garden that the
[17:48] spices thereof May flow out let my
[17:49] beloved come into his garden and eat his
[17:52] Pleasant fruits so we this is that's why
[17:55] I said earlier eating is such an
[17:56] intimate thing uh you know God has no
[17:59] other way to describe you know
[18:00] relationship between a husband and wife
[18:02] than eating he can't describe it any
[18:04] other way right it's such an intimate
[18:07] personal thing and uh you know the
[18:09] adulterer uh the adulterers also said to
[18:12] do this in Proverbs 30:20 this is a Ser
[18:14] good serpent SE in scripture such is the
[18:16] way of an adulterous woman she eateth
[18:18] and wipeth her mouth and saith I have
[18:20] done no
[18:21] wickedness so we see there's two types
[18:23] of uh I mean there's two types of eating
[18:25] you know one is sincere one is real
[18:28] genuine love
[18:30] right but the perverted eating is a
[18:32] denial it's a uh the they partake of of
[18:35] sins they partake of lust of the Flesh
[18:37] and lust of the eyes and pride of life
[18:39] and then they say I I haven't done
[18:40] anything evil they're so deceived right
[18:44] so see church members can go through all
[18:45] the acts it looks like they're having
[18:47] intimacy with God but if you look at
[18:49] their actual life then you can see
[18:51] they're actually having intimacy with
[18:53] Devils
[18:54] Hallelujah so all you know that's why we
[18:56] got to be careful that's why I love amen
[18:58] and Malachi they can take a song they
[19:00] can take a song like we heard uh uh from
[19:03] our friends that visited they love how
[19:04] we we were able to change songs that and
[19:07] really in some of those songs that that
[19:09] we've been able to change to make holy I
[19:11] think they said we cleaned out the songs
[19:13] but they said we like how brother amen
[19:15] and Malachi can clean out the
[19:17] songs but you know in some of those
[19:19] videos they might those people in their
[19:21] rock and roll and rap they might be
[19:23] partaking with the
[19:25] devil but the lyrics are good the lyrics
[19:28] are inspired they speak of God it just
[19:31] shows they're partaking right with evil
[19:34] spirits because they got the wrong Style
[19:36] music but we can take the right words
[19:38] and we can give it the right uh the
[19:40] right uh tone and the right beat and the
[19:42] right Melody and all the right chords I
[19:44] don't know nothing about music so I'm
[19:46] just pulling these things out you know
[19:47] but you can give it the right thing and
[19:49] then those songs allow us to have
[19:51] intimacy with Christ hallelujah amen
[19:54] same words just like the Bible right
[19:56] they could the devil will preach that
[19:57] verse you know a John 17 what's that
[19:59] Devil's verse uh not the devil's verse
[20:02] but the devil's perversion of the verse
[20:04] Jesus said I would that they be one even
[20:06] as as we are one remember that and the
[20:09] Antichrist will take that and said see
[20:10] we should all be one with the Roman
[20:12] Catholic Church see it's it's it's
[20:15] intimacy with Devils because they're
[20:17] twisting uh they're they're taking the
[20:19] word and and making it mean something
[20:21] that it doesn't mean but you and I can
[20:23] experience that real Oneness with Christ
[20:25] Hallelujah because we confessed our sin
[20:28] we are seeking to please God we are
[20:30] obeying the word of God we're doing the
[20:32] best we can to be zealous over good
[20:34] works hallelujah amen and let the Lord
[20:36] work through us hallelujah amen not in
[20:40] control of our own lives but letting
[20:42] Christ live through us the hope of glory
[20:44] and brothers you can show Christ on the
[20:46] soccer team can't you yeah I did on the
[20:49] football field like I told you that one
[20:51] guy cussed me up and down all game I
[20:52] just looked over and said Jesus loves
[20:54] you boy he turned away right quick right
[20:56] away he didn't talk to me the rest of
[20:57] the game amen you can talk to Jesus on
[20:59] the field amen someone calls you a name
[21:02] you sayi praying for you then just bow
[21:04] your head and pray no of course after
[21:06] the game you know don't pray during the
[21:08] game
[21:08] you pray before and pray after that's
[21:12] right now so see this eating is liken
[21:15] unto marriage relations and brother B
[21:17] tells us that in the church age book
[21:19] Revelation 2:14 thou Hast them that hold
[21:21] the doctrine of baam who taught BAC to
[21:23] cast a stumbling block before the
[21:25] children of Israel to eat things
[21:26] sacrificed unto idols and commit
[21:30] fornication and brother bam says you
[21:32] know in the early church they weren't
[21:33] actually eating uh things sacrificed to
[21:36] Idol he talking about the Roman Church
[21:37] in the early church when they started
[21:39] the early Roman Catholic Church he said
[21:42] so when these people were bowing to
[21:43] images lighting candles and using Pagan
[21:46] hes confessing their sins to men all
[21:48] which belongs to the devil's religion
[21:50] they were partaking with the devil and
[21:52] not the Lord they were in idolatry
[21:54] whether they admitted or not he says so
[21:57] you can see eating is actually partaking
[21:59] in a spiritual
[22:01] sense
[22:03] right so we can see all those acts of
[22:06] you know they think lighting a candle is
[22:08] going to get them closer to God they
[22:10] think praying to Mary or Joseph when
[22:12] they're actually doing that they're
[22:13] actually partaking with
[22:15] demons they're making love to they're
[22:17] giving their love they're giving their
[22:19] intimacy to Demons aren't you glad that
[22:21] your love goes straight to God Almighty
[22:23] hallelujah what a privilege that and
[22:26] that's why Jesus wants worshippers who
[22:27] Worship in spirit and in truth
[22:29] hallelujah amen that we we don't we
[22:32] don't have vain worship Jesus said they
[22:34] worship me in vain teaching for
[22:36] doctrines the Commandments of men aren't
[22:38] you glad you get to come to church and
[22:39] you know God has received your worship
[22:41] because you felt him giv Amen to your
[22:43] worship Hallelujah I love that when God
[22:46] comes down and gives an amen to a sermon
[22:48] I studied for amen because it was God
[22:50] leading me to that it wasn't me there's
[22:52] nothing good in me but I like when God
[22:54] comes down and gives a a Heavenly amen
[22:57] so be it to that service
[22:59] amen Malachi saw it over there in Iowa
[23:01] we sure got some good amens over there
[23:03] God God amens his word
[23:07] hallelujah but see it shows we're
[23:09] communing with the Holy Spirit and we're
[23:11] not giving you know our intimacy to
[23:13] devils and false doctrines we're not
[23:16] eating things sacrificed to Idols we're
[23:18] eating on the word of God we're eating
[23:20] the book
[23:21] Hallelujah that's right so just with
[23:24] that Foundation now let's look at our
[23:25] scriptures here I'm already 15 minutes
[23:27] in Ezekiel
[23:30] chapter uh Ezekiel 2 if you have your
[23:32] Bible go to Ezekiel
[23:38] 2 go to verse eight Ezekiel 2:8 now as
[23:41] you're turning there remember Ezekiel
[23:42] I'm just going to read this from
[23:43] scoffield like Daniel and John he
[23:46] prophesied out of Jerusalem he wasn't in
[23:48] the land of Jerusalem when he was
[23:49] prophesying or Israel and his prophecy
[23:52] like theirs follows the method of symbol
[23:53] and
[23:54] vision
[23:56] Hallelujah unlike the threee exilic
[24:00] prophets whose Ministry was primary to
[24:02] either Judah or the 10 tribe Kingdom
[24:04] Ezekiel is the voice of Jehovah to the
[24:06] whole house of Israel
[24:10] Hallelujah so remember he was out of the
[24:12] land and yet his letters and prophecy
[24:15] would go to all Israel all all all the
[24:18] people of God whether they were
[24:20] scattered or whether they were they
[24:21] stayed there in the land Hallelujah
[24:24] Ezekiel
[24:26] 2:8 now actually I'm going to go a
[24:28] little little bit here let's go up to
[24:31] uh boy this is quite a this is quite a
[24:34] chapter God basic in verses 1 to S God
[24:37] basically says these are a stiff hearted
[24:39] group of people that you're going to
[24:40] preach to I'm glad I got uh soft
[24:43] soft-hearted people to preach to praise
[24:45] God I'm sorry you I'm very thankful you
[24:48] all don't stand there with stiff necks
[24:49] and just stare at me and give me your
[24:51] stiffest neck and you won't say Amen you
[24:53] won't enjoy you know you won't Feast on
[24:54] the things of God I'm glad I got a
[24:55] church that loves the word of God
[24:57] hallelujah but God told Ezekiel this is
[24:59] what this kind of the church you're
[25:01] going to have this is the kind of uh
[25:02] people you're going to have to preach to
[25:04] Hallelujah and now let's go to Just
[25:06] verse 7 for time sake and thou shalt
[25:08] speak my words unto them whether they
[25:09] will hear or whether they will forebear
[25:11] for they are most rebellious you got a
[25:13] really rebellious Church Ezekiel of
[25:15] course we know he wasn't a pastor but he
[25:16] was a prophet verse eight but thou son
[25:19] of man hear what I say unto thee be thou
[25:21] not rebellious like that rebellious
[25:23] house open thy mouth and eat what I will
[25:26] give thee amen so that's how you know
[25:28] you're eating the word of God you're
[25:30] receiving what God says hallelujah
[25:33] you're not rebelling against it you're
[25:35] actually uh doing it
[25:37] Hallelujah and in in the simplest sense
[25:40] as I said on the testimonies as we were
[25:42] preaching over there in Kentucky and
[25:43] Iowa even on the issue of the lust of
[25:45] the eyes right and how men battle
[25:48] pornography and all these things if a
[25:50] man is fighting against that and
[25:52] resisting that he's eating the word of
[25:54] God hallelujah right that's the simplest
[25:57] sense amen that he's not rebellious but
[25:59] he's fighting against it he's getting
[26:01] Victory Hallelujah that's just a simple
[26:02] sense I can or simple example I can
[26:04] share with you hallelujah or another one
[26:07] uh bitterness you know I've been dealing
[26:09] with bitterness you know with those same
[26:11] Services too brother Brooks tell me
[26:13] about some situations like M no wonder
[26:15] the Holy Spirit had me preach these
[26:16] things but if someone's willing to go
[26:19] after churches and say I'm sorry forgive
[26:21] me now they can say I'm having intimacy
[26:24] I'm eating the role amen I'm not a
[26:26] rebellious church member I'm obedient
[26:28] child of God hallelujah and don't get me
[26:31] wrong I know there's times and Seasons
[26:32] but I'm just saying as soon as possible
[26:34] make haste Hallelujah today Harden not
[26:37] your hearts as the day in provocation
[26:40] Amen Let It Be Today amen we shout the
[26:43] him of Heaven let it be today we repent
[26:45] and overcome the cares of this life and
[26:47] the sins of this world let it be today
[26:50] that we eat the book of God hallelujah
[26:52] amen don't wait for another day
[26:55] amen don't be rebellious Hallelujah now
[26:57] we all got streaks of rebellion I I
[26:59] understand that I'm not and we're not
[27:01] you know in God's eyes in heaven we're
[27:03] not rebellious but our flesh Rebels on
[27:05] this Earth I didn't expect many amens on
[27:08] that when that's came but it's true
[27:09] anyhow verse nine and when I looked
[27:11] behold and hand was sent unto me and low
[27:14] a role of a book was therein if God
[27:17] could give you anything you know you you
[27:18] you think Ezekiel might look up and see
[27:20] a stack of gold coins no he better than
[27:22] that God gave him eternal life in the
[27:24] book
[27:25] Hallelujah if God could give you any
[27:27] brother God could have gave the humanity
[27:29] anything else he would have gave it to
[27:30] him but what he gave him was the word of
[27:32] God
[27:33] hallelujah glory
[27:37] amen he says there verse nine oh that's
[27:41] right a book verse 10 and he spread it
[27:43] before me it was written within and
[27:45] without and there was written there in
[27:47] Lamentations mourning and woe so it
[27:49] wasn't going to be an easy sermon to
[27:50] preach this wasn't you know God's going
[27:53] to bless you and you're going to have
[27:54] prosperity and everything's going to go
[27:56] good that wasn't the word for that day
[27:58] now we thank God for Prosperity we thank
[28:00] God for his blessings but that's not why
[28:02] we serve him
[28:04] amen that's why most churches serve God
[28:07] just for the blessings we don't serve
[28:09] God for the blessings we serve God
[28:11] because of his character yes Hallelujah
[28:13] because of who he is amen and church
[28:16] we'll be tested on that like the trials
[28:18] of life when we lose loved ones and diff
[28:20] difficult happens difficult things
[28:22] happen sicknesses uh losses Financial
[28:25] losses all these things we'll be tested
[28:27] and the longer we live the more we ought
[28:28] to be convinced we serve God because of
[28:30] his love because of his character
[28:32] because of who he is and not just what
[28:34] he gives us naturally Hallelujah what's
[28:37] most important is what he gives us
[28:38] spiritually
[28:40] Hallelujah sometimes it's just the joy
[28:42] of knowing you're saved it's just the
[28:44] assurance that you're a child of God
[28:49] hallelujah that's more valuable than
[28:51] other any other physical blessings those
[28:54] things things can be come and go they
[28:56] can be taken away in a moment praise God
[28:58] and all you've got left is the word of
[29:00] God that you've eaten
[29:03] Hallelujah right that's all you've got
[29:06] left when everything falls apart and
[29:08] brother said like my head swiming all
[29:10] these things all you have left is what
[29:12] the word of God that you've eaten that
[29:14] you become one with praise God that you
[29:15] have intimacy with that's all you've got
[29:17] left is intimacy with God
[29:24] hallelujah chapter 3 verse one moover he
[29:26] said unto me son of man eat that thou
[29:28] findest I'm glad God lets us find his
[29:31] word just like that Mana right go out
[29:33] and get the Mana I promise it'll be

[29:44] thankful we're under the same anointing
[29:46] amen eat this roll and go speak now look
[29:48] there's see there's a reason Church why
[29:50] you eat the word of God so you can go
[29:51] tell somebody about Jesus remember you
[29:54] overcome by the word of your testimony
[29:56] amen just have a testimony your heart be
[29:58] ready to share just have something ready
[30:00] to share because that's the purpose of
[30:02] eating you become one with it and then
[30:05] you can talk about it because you're one
[30:06] with it

[30:10] you side and say uh and you could tell
[30:12] me all the details of your favorite fast
[30:14] food right you could tell me oh man

[33:55] hour but get your heart filled with the
[33:58] comfort that God is with you Hallelujah
[34:01] remember it's got to be a fiery prayer
[34:03] uh the the altar the the incense had to
[34:04] be on fire before it could go in the
[34:06] presence of God in other words be
[34:08] sincere make sure it's your most sincere
[34:11] prayer humble yourself in the sight of
[34:13] God and he will exalt you in new season
[34:16] Hallelujah all right now Jeremiah go to
[34:19] Jeremiah 15:16 again as you're turning
[34:23] there Zephaniah and habach uh were cont
[34:27] Temporaries of Jeremiah's earlier
[34:30] Ministries okay and then those passed
[34:32] away and then Daniel was alive towards
[34:34] the end of Jeremiah's Ministry isn't
[34:36] that that's what I love about that Sight
[34:37] and Sound they bring Ezekiel Daniel and
[34:39] Jeremiah all into the same time period
[34:41] because they were all in the same time
[34:43] period I see some some people be upset
[34:46] and say uh they'll quote brother brandom
[34:47] and they'll say uh brother said that God
[34:49] never has two uh prophets at the same
[34:51] time well it depends the context you're
[34:54] talking about I've heard quotes from
[34:55] Brother R talking about that and he says
[34:57] look Moses was leader than Joshua so in
[35:00] the context brother's talking about
[35:01] that's true but it was a different time
[35:04] during the days of of Jeremiah Ezekiel
[35:07] and Daniel right God's people are
[35:09] scattered all over so God had to have
[35:11] multiple prophets
[35:13] amen see people argue and say this and
[35:15] this and that that nonsense just be
[35:17] humble praise God just look at the word
[35:19] of God
[35:20] Amen see it's that critical spirit
[35:22] remember avoid vain babblings
[35:25] amen that stay with me amen Allelujah
[35:28] remember Jeremiah remained in the land
[35:31] ministering to the poor
[35:33] Remnant until they went to Egypt with he
[35:36] followed them this is from scoffield and
[35:38] where he died think of that he died in
[35:40] Egypt early in the 70 years captivity so
[35:43] Jeremiah prophesied before and during
[35:45] the Exile of Judah and connects the
[35:48] pre-ex prophets and with Ezekiel and
[35:51] Daniel prophets of the
[35:53] Exile so see God had multiple prophets
[35:56] in different areas praise God but if
[35:59] God's people are in one place and
[36:00] they're not scattered yes God has one
[36:02] Prophet to lead them by yes one
[36:04] everybody understand that by God's grace
[36:06] but if they're all scattered about God
[36:07] has to have different prophets to
[36:08] minister to the people in the land
[36:10] outside the land
[36:12] Hallelujah all right Jeremiah
[36:15] 15:16 thy words were found and I did eat
[36:17] them just like Glory just like Ezekiel
[36:20] found the words amen just like Noah
[36:23] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[36:26] remember he attained it ah Hallelujah he
[36:29] attained it and also you could go to the
[36:30] pearl of great price he found he already
[36:32] had pearls but then he found the Pearl
[36:35] he already had good religious things
[36:37] these are good ideas but there's one
[36:39] truth that's greater than all of them
[36:41] that's Jesus Christ Hallelujah he found
[36:43] it but see God ordered a steps God knew
[36:46] he'd find it amen because of
[36:49] predestination I did eat them so I found
[36:52] them I ate them and Thy Word was unto me
[36:56] the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I
[36:58] called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts
[37:00] now we get another idea after eating you
[37:02] remember you testify and you get some
[37:05] Joy I hope somebody leaves this service
[37:07] with some Joy you came to service with
[37:09] joy buddy I know he that's the happiest
[37:11] I've seen him Hallelujah well maybe not
[37:13] the happiest but it's good to see him
[37:15] happy there's times I'm not happy
[37:17] there's times we're not happy but God
[37:19] has made us glad amen restore the joy of
[37:22] my salvation Hallelujah you won't be
[37:24] joyful all the time but it sure it's
[37:26] good to feel the joy it comes after
[37:28] eating the word of God it comes after
[37:31] intimacy with the Holy Spirit praise God
[37:34] Amen Hallelujah that's how it comes he
[37:37] found joy that's why I was so glad you
[37:39] know uh La last week after somebody at
[37:41] the altar I shook some of your hands and
[37:42] I was I saw all this Joy on your face I
[37:44] thought praise the Lord they must have
[37:47] ate God's book amen right that's what
[37:49] the Bible says you eat his word makes
[37:52] you joyful gives you strength
[37:56] Hallelujah
[37:58] Glory now why was he happy why why could
[38:01] his heart Rejoice because I'm called by
[38:02] his name aren't you glad you're not
[38:04] called by
[38:05] Methodist Lutheran Pentecostal Catholic
[38:08] aren't you glad you're called by Jesus
[38:11] Christ our church is bride of Jesus
[38:13] Christ we're called to be the Bride of
[38:16] Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why I'm
[38:18] glad we got that name
[38:20] amen see that that's what's the name
[38:22] we're called by we're recognized as
[38:24] Christians Holy Ghost filled Christians
[38:26] Hallelujah
[38:28] now I want to read what John Gil said
[38:30] thy words were found I ate them the
[38:32] messages he was called to deliver unto
[38:34] the others appeared to him to be of God
[38:36] as they were as welcome to him as food
[38:38] is to a Hungry
[38:40] Man Allelujah he's cheerfully receive
[38:43] them treasure them up in his memory
[38:45] digested them in his mind and carefully
[38:47] retain them so are the doctrines of the
[38:50] Gospel which are the words of God and
[38:52] not of men when by searching in close
[38:54] application they're found the scriptures
[38:56] and are under the Ministry of the word
[38:58] they are food to souls sweet Savory
[39:02] wholesome nourishing and
[39:04] strengthening is that what you thought
[39:06] about last Sunday Services they were
[39:08] Savory words yeah they were good I took
[39:11] well I took quite a few notes on that
[39:12] sermon let me just show you
[39:15] here this is kind of like an ingredients
[39:17] list or something like that from cooking
[39:19] I took all these notes from Brother Paul
[39:21] I got all these Nice Notes here all
[39:23] these notes then all the songs I want to
[39:24] sing up see all this eating of the word
[39:26] makes you want to rejoice and sing all
[39:28] these songs
[39:29] amen hallelujah see we we find if the
[39:34] natural is true about eating what about
[39:36] the spiritual amen must be so much
[39:38] greater
[39:41] Hallelujah he says the word was to me
[39:44] the joy and rejoicing of my heart that's
[39:47] why the Bible calls it honey Allelujah
[39:50] anybody had any honey lately praise God
[39:53] honey it makes you happy it's it it
[39:55] gives you strength I remember when
[39:56] brother Kevin was here and I showed
[39:58] there's like 20 benefits to honey
[39:59] there's probably a 100 benefits to honey
[40:00] you
[40:01] know my wife was telling me even you can
[40:03] put honey on your skin you know and help
[40:05] with your skin
[40:09] complexion go at your own
[40:11] risk I should probably had some honey to
[40:13] my face am but you know there there's so
[40:16] much truth in this the word should bring
[40:18] us joy the word should make us rejoice
[40:22] Hallelujah because you're one with it
[40:25] it's not something out Glory it's not
[40:26] something outside of you it's inside of
[40:28] you amen it's not just out there but
[40:31] it's actually in here
[40:33] hallelujah because we're called by God's
[40:35] name amen go to Revelation
[40:40] 10 now we're familiar with this brother
[40:42] brandom says Revelation 10 1-7 is
[40:45] history pardon me I dropped my pen
[40:48] there brother says Revelation 101:7 is
[40:51] already history that means the seven
[40:52] Thunders have already sounded and the
[40:54] church say I just like to say that
[40:57] that's my belief that's my conviction I
[40:58] like I just like all those I think I had
[41:01] 14 proofs that the Thunders have already
[41:02] sounded if I went back and listen that a
[41:04] few months ago but brother says
[41:07] Revelation 10 1-7 but now it's history
[41:10] it's past quote that's a quote
[41:13] Hallelujah but then in Revelation 10:7
[41:16] we know the mystery is given to an angel
[41:18] he can't be a Heavenly Angel right he's
[41:21] got to be an Earthly Angel because he
[41:22] has to sound out his message to the
[41:24] Earth and God didn't call angels to
[41:26] finish the of God because Amos 3:7 says
[41:30] God always he'll do nothing but he
[41:32] Reveals His secret to his servant the
[41:34] prophet amen so if this Angel is going
[41:37] to finish a mystery and it's a Seeker we
[41:38] didn't know it's got to come through a
[41:40] prophet
[41:41] Hallelujah right and we know David's
[41:43] called a prophet Paul I'm sorry David's
[41:44] called an Angel David is a prophet and
[41:46] Paul's called an angel Paul's called a
[41:48] prophet as
[41:49] well okay
[41:51] now and look and look verse eight again
[41:54] he says and go and take the little book
[41:57] so see there's something that that is
[41:59] you and I that's instruction you and I
[42:00] have to draw nigh to
[42:03] God go you go and take it praise God
[42:06] John had to go and get it so we've got
[42:08] to go and get the Bible off our Shelf
[42:11] and open it you got to go you got to go
[42:14] down to the altar like you did last week
[42:16] I love that Amen in 18 years I never had
[42:18] a church uh I never had our church ever
[42:20] come down to the altar like that I said
[42:21] well that that shows you just got to
[42:23] wait wait and wait and be patient and
[42:25] God will God will give you desires of
[42:26] your heart am amen it just does my heart
[42:28] a lot to see the church down at the
[42:29] altar you know we don't do it every
[42:31] service but it's just a blessing to see
[42:32] that but God gives us the desire of our
[42:35] hearts he said you go and take it and
[42:38] then uh ask right and that's why the
[42:39] brother man said pray for Revelation
[42:41] more than anything else ask for
[42:44] Revelation you know like one of the
[42:46] sisters there on Thursday night she said
[42:48] uh she said I need wisdom Casa saw and
[42:50] all the sisters GA around and prayed for
[42:51] her for wisdom afterwards I told her I
[42:53] said you're going to get a a whole lot
[42:54] of wisdom because God said in James 1 if
[42:56] you ask ask and believe you'll get it
[42:58] liberally God's going to just like pour
[43:01] out the blessings on you of wisdom she
[43:04] had to know this how do you handle this
[43:05] uh family situation about depression and
[43:07] not working how do you handle this God
[43:09] will give her wisdom Hallelujah and it
[43:13] don't it don't matter if God gives it to
[43:14] her or somebody gives it to her as long
[43:16] as God as long as God brings the wisdom
[43:17] it could come through a preacher it come
[43:19] through a brother come through a sister
[43:21] but God is going to give that woman
[43:23] wisdom because God's word cannot lie
[43:27] okay so go take it and then he says in
[43:30] verse nine give me so he said' give it
[43:31] to me he said ' take it and eat it so he
[43:34] said go get it then he says give it to
[43:36] me then he said take
[43:38] it so see as humans we just got to make
[43:40] effort Hallelujah we got to get into the
[43:43] presence of God we got to draw n to God
[43:45] and we got to partake of the things of
[43:47] God that's why I told some of those
[43:49] young believers I I said uh find
[43:50] something you really want to study you
[43:51] know whether it's the Book of James or
[43:53] find a book of Revelation find something
[43:55] and go take that and just make that your
[43:57] own you know I told Mali you know write
[43:58] in your Bible I told these brothers I
[44:00] said if you need any markers or anything
[44:01] you let me know you know see that's how
[44:04] I brought my Bible for the first time
[44:06] after eight months I finally got it all
[44:08] highlighted with all my previous
[44:09] highlights and this just shows to me
[44:12] like this just shows all my notes it
[44:13] just shows I want intimacy with the
[44:15] Bible with God's Bible that's my way of
[44:18] saying I don't want to forget this I
[44:20] want this not just to be on those pages
[44:22] I want God to write it on my heart
[44:24] Hallelujah and I'll remember it more if
[44:26] I write it on the page amen but I spend
[44:28] that time eating Hallelujah I know some
[44:30] of us like to eat as fast as we can but
[44:32] with God you don't want to do
[44:34] that I remember there's a Time John
[44:36] Graham and I we would race and see how
[44:37] fast we get with our meals so then we
[44:39] can go be more
[44:40] productive you know we're all about
[44:42] efficiency that was way back in the day
[44:44] and he's like well if I do this and that
[44:46] and I I can be done in like two minutes
[44:48] man that's a good job maybe I can get
[44:50] done in one minute can I eat that
[44:52] burrito in one minute how you're going
[44:54] to suffer for that later on with
[44:55] indigestion or something like that
[44:57] but with God is exactly the opposite God
[45:00] wants you to take your time now if all
[45:02] you got there's cares of the world and
[45:03] there's things we with children or a
[45:05] business or whatever emergency then yeah
[45:07] just enjoy whatever you got but God
[45:10] wants us to do the opposite let's sit
[45:11] down and enjoy the meal praise God let's
[45:14] sit down and enjoy the presence of God
[45:17] hallelujah I started that in January I
[45:19] just got through with it last week I got
[45:21] all my notes from the previous and I
[45:22] added a bunch of notes and now I'm going
[45:24] to add like an index where all all all
[45:26] the major message doctrines and I'm
[45:28] going to have the starting spot for it
[45:29] like hell's not Eternal that's going to
[45:30] start at Luke 16 I'm going have all the
[45:32] main verses for that so I can I can if
[45:34] any anytime I can use this at the pulpit
[45:36] and I can teach somebody the truth and
[45:39] really I really I'm depending on the
[45:41] Holy Spirit but I got to give the Holy
[45:43] Spirit something to work with that's say
[45:47] you can't just expect the Holy Spirit to
[45:48] give you something if you're not
[45:49] constantly feeding on the Holy Spirit
[45:52] Hallelujah all right good I'm sure you
[45:54] know that by go just thought I'd remind
[45:56] you there
[45:57] so Revelation 10 he's got to eat the
[45:59] book and then what does he do just like
[46:01] Ezekiel just like Jeremiah after he eats
[46:04] he can
[46:05] prophesy after you eat you can prophesy
[46:08] Hallelujah right you got to eat first
[46:11] and then
[46:12] prophesy I love it now it goes on to say
[46:17] though that it was sweet in his mouth
[46:20] Hallelujah we see that uh in verse nine
[46:24] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[46:26] honey now there's 1 2 3 four five
[46:30] there's there's five verses that say the
[46:32] word of God is sweet as honey we already
[46:35] read one of them Ezekiel 3:3 but let's
[46:38] read some other ones here by God's grace
[46:40] uh Psalm
[46:42] 19:10 our brother saying hunting the
[46:44] Rocks I knew this is we need a reminder
[46:47] if you don't think the word of God is
[46:48] sweet uh you need a reminder you need to
[46:50] remember Hallelujah you sit down and
[46:53] remember the body of the Lord the broken
[46:54] body of the Lord and the Holy Spirit
[46:57] Hallelujah Psalm
[47:03] 1910 I got to get there
[47:07] okay faster than me good job I like to
[47:11] read it Psalm 1910 more to be desired
[47:14] are they speaking of The Commandments
[47:17] and righteous judgments of the Lord then
[47:18] gold yay much than much fine gold
[47:22] sweeter also than honey and the
[47:25] honeycomb
[47:27] think about that all the Commandments of
[47:28] God are sweeter than
[47:31] honey and let me bring it back to the
[47:33] brothers Brothers when the Bible said
[47:34] don't look at a woman in lust if you
[47:35] obey that that'll make you that that
[47:37] tastes as sweet as
[47:39] honey or sisters uh don't wear makeup
[47:42] don't cut your hair that should be as
[47:44] sweet as
[47:45] Honey
[47:47] Hallelujah and church it is when you're
[47:49] walking in obedience other words you're
[47:51] never going to be as happy as you can
[47:53] unless you're obeying the word of God to
[47:54] the best of your ability amen you'll
[47:57] never be happier or rejoicing of my
[47:59] heart like Jeremiah said you'll never
[48:01] have more rejoicing than when you're
[48:03] walking in full obedience to the word of
[48:05] God hallelujah how many believe
[48:08] that because it's like honey it could
[48:11] not be any
[48:12] sweeter right nothing could be sweeter
[48:14] than than knowing uh I'm partaking of my
[48:17] Creator's words I'm living off of him
[48:20] and he's my delight he's my life he's
[48:23] I'm one with him he's inside of me and I
[48:25] know I came from him Hallelujah

[48:48] this our children when we have a free
[48:50] moment we're just quick to pick up our
[48:51] phone but church we got to ask God to
[48:54] help us to not do that so much and just
[48:56] have some sweet meditation moments now
[48:59] it's okay if you pick up your phone and
[49:00] you're actually going to read the Bible
[49:01] but we know if we're reading the Bible
[49:02] or not on the
[49:04] phone see and this is something that's
[49:06] been a good reminder to me just take

[49:11] we just get to walk we're not looking at
[49:13] our phones and uh uh we just get to look
[49:16] at the sky look at the clouds and talk
[49:18] about God and that's that's a
[49:20] fulfillment of that that's one way to
[49:22] fulfill that just meditate on the things
[49:24] of God and your life just gets sweeter
[49:27] your outlook your perspective everything
[49:29] gets sweeter if you just meditate on God
[49:32] hallelujah think about that scripture
[49:34] think about that sermon think about that
[49:35] Doctrine think about that Judgment of

[50:06] honey

[50:11] God's word when you're hearing it right
[50:13] now and if it's blessing you it should
[50:15] be sweeter than honey to your
[50:18] mouth when I when I eat honey I used to

[50:22] for the
[50:23] pancakes I was always where's the honey

[50:37] honey but just although I believe in
[50:41] baptism I sprinking it on there right
[50:43] and it's just such a sweet taste it's
[50:46] it's such a fulfillment it's such
[50:48] satisfaction that's how it is when you

[53:40] games every Thursday night he passed out
[53:42] just one page it's just it's like a it's

[53:47] verse and one day he's this this is how
[53:50] he says he does it he lays out like nine
[53:53] or t of these and he just prays and he
[53:55] ask God to kind of guide his hand you

[54:02] with football or anything I don't know
[54:04] he says Lord you got it my hand I prayed
[54:06] I'm going to give it out a week later so

[54:47] her coworker came to her crying a few
[54:49] days later and said I was just about
[54:50] ready to go commit
[54:53] suicide because I was going to commit

[55:24] someone from committing suicide
[55:28] and uh and then you know she went on to
[55:29] say how that mother now has a a new
[55:31] outlook on life and all these things all
[55:33] because of one piece of paper and it was
[55:36] I don't know what scripture was about
[55:37] maybe about uh God's mercy or God's
[55:39] forgiveness it had nothing to do with
[55:41] football but just in a and and this man
[55:44] has done this brother Austin he's been a
[55:45] coach for over 30 some years every
[55:47] Thursday night for 30 years print off
[55:48] all these papers you think oh he's
[55:49] wasting ink and these guys don't want to
[55:51] hear it Church you never know where your
[55:53] influence is going to
[55:54] go you never know but see church it's
[55:57] the Purity Glory it's the purity of just
[55:59] eating the word well I know the Bible
[56:01] says I'm supposed to share the gospel
[56:03] and I'm just going to share in my humble
[56:04] little
[56:05] way he's not a preacher but he can share
[56:09] the word in some type of
[56:11] way and it can cause somebody save them
[56:13] from Death save them from Hell perhaps
[56:16] if maybe they got saved I don't
[56:18] know so I I think I texted him this
[56:21] morning I said thank you I love all
[56:22] those God moments you know oh and he
[56:24] said when he was in a when he met his
[56:26] wife
[56:26] he was just like in a teacher he's a
[56:28] teacher like me he's a math teacher he
[56:30] said when he met his wife he said he
[56:32] said the Holy Ghost came over him now
[56:34] this is a man who don't know the message
[56:36] the Holy Ghost came on and he said this
[56:37] is a real warm feeling he said I like
[56:39] this whatever this is I like this he
[56:41] said was the Holy Spirit he said I I got
[56:43] you know goosebumps God is here and he
[56:46] said within a few minutes this woman
[56:48] walked in the door and sat down like
[56:50] kind of in front of him and he went up
[56:51] and eventually they got married you know
[56:53] it was just a neat testimony like God
[56:55] comes and confirms ter this is the one
[56:56] he' been looking for a wife you know
[56:58] didn't want to be alone all these things
[56:59] like that I love that God will show up
[57:01] when you need it praise God Amen I love
[57:04] God hallelujah now so we see how many
[57:08] believe God's word is
[57:10] sweet see if people leave services and
[57:13] they're not they're not thankful with
[57:14] the word of God well then they're either
[57:15] going through a rough service or they're
[57:16] rebellious I'm sorry a rough SE rough
[57:18] season right they're either going a
[57:20] rough season the word ought to be
[57:22] sweeter than anything else it ought to
[57:24] be such a blessing to be in the house of
[57:27] God and you know it is if you've been if
[57:29] you missed a service lately you know it
[57:31] is the blessing to be here and hear the
[57:33] children sing and and hear the adults
[57:35] sing amen and and hear the prayers go up
[57:37] it such a blessing to be in the presence
[57:39] of God nothing could be sweeter
[57:41] Hallelujah because it's intimacy it's
[57:43] Oneness with
[57:44] God God told John you eat the book
[57:47] Hallelujah that was us right because it
[57:49] must be prophesied to every people's
[57:51] Nation tongues Kindred tribes Hallelujah
[57:54] the Gentiles Hallelujah so we see the
[57:57] sweetness of God I'm trying to bring
[57:58] this down I'm almost at I'm at 51
[57:59] minutes
[58:02] here all right so it's in our mouth
[58:04] sweet as honey but in our belly it's
[58:10] bitter let's see what brother Ram said
[58:12] about this I want to read this to
[58:14] you he said and this Sevenfold book of
[58:18] seven Redemption plans talking about the
[58:20] Seven Seals has been brought to us and
[58:22] that's what this book holds this is from
[58:24] 1961 actually uh Revelation chapter 5
[58:27] part two now we're going to get over to
[58:30] the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel
[58:31] proclaimed something that he had a
[58:33] little book that John had to eat and
[58:35] when he did he got it into his belly and
[58:37] it was bitter but in his lips it was
[58:41] sweet and here's how brother Ram
[58:43] explains it when you have to digest it
[58:46] then it gets bitter because everybody's
[58:49] against
[58:51] you everybody telling you're a Holy
[58:54] Roller you're this you're that or the
[58:56] other see you're off of your
[58:59] head no my head just got on placed the
[59:02] right way actually my head my head
[59:03] finally got screwed in the right way my
[59:05] head was off before now it's
[59:07] on my man said so it's hard to digest
[59:11] it he says but when you're testifying of
[59:15] his glory it's sweet in your
[59:17] lips amen hallelujah I love that amen so
[59:21] the bitterness is when people say hard
[59:23] things about you right and you're living
[59:25] the Christian life and it's a part of
[59:27] you and everybody's against you that's
[59:29] the bitterness but the honey is all the
[59:32] testifying the worship the singing the
[59:34] praising of God the glory of God
[59:36] hallelujah when it's in your lips when
[59:39] you get a chance to share your
[59:41] testimony
[59:44] hallelujah
[59:47] hallelujah now on the bitter aspect I
[59:49] said I dealt with the sweetness right on
[59:51] the bitter element brother Ram tells us
[59:53] this he's quoting Revelation and Jesus
[59:55] said they they shall walk with me I
[59:57] mentioned this earlier because it was on
[59:58] my mind this is what God says he will
[1:00:01] bestow upon them for their upright walk
[1:00:04] now remember upright walk is just
[1:00:06] walking right walking in obedience to
[1:00:09] the word of
[1:00:10] God this is part of their inheritance
[1:00:13] that he has reserved for
[1:00:15] them if they were willing to walk with
[1:00:19] him through the
[1:00:20] toyss and snares of life and be honored
[1:00:24] to him he was going to reward them he is
[1:00:28] not forgetful of our labor of love God
[1:00:31] will always recompense us for our
[1:00:33] efforts to please
[1:00:37] himen so God's reward for you if you can
[1:00:41] walk through this life through the toils
[1:00:44] and the snares if you can walk through
[1:00:46] this life with the bitterness of the
[1:00:48] word of God the bitter impact it has on
[1:00:51] people's reaction to you his reward is
[1:00:54] if you can walk through this filthy
[1:00:55] world world if you can walk with the
[1:00:57] bitterness in your stomach week after
[1:00:59] week month after month year after year
[1:01:01] decade after decade if you can do that I
[1:01:04] you inherit the fact that I will walk
[1:01:06] with you in the Millennium and the
[1:01:08] future home
[1:01:10] Hallelujah that's your reward Hallelujah
[1:01:13] if you can walk with the the honey in
[1:01:15] your mouth praising God but also the
[1:01:16] bitterness sometimes that comes along
[1:01:18] with this the rejection he said I'll
[1:01:20] walk with you in white for you are
[1:01:23] worthy I read this quote case she was
[1:01:25] there read this on Thursday night we
[1:01:27] closed down service two people came up
[1:01:29] for
[1:01:30] prayer and I said okay we'll close the
[1:01:32] service but a brother comes up remember
[1:01:33] brother Howard he comes up and he tells
[1:01:35] his testimony he's crying he said these
[1:01:38] last few weeks he said I'm one of 10
[1:01:40] children and all nine children have
[1:01:43] rejected me and my parents he said I've
[1:01:46] shared the message with all uh TW all
[1:01:50] other 11 family members and everyone has
[1:01:53] turned me down he said I talked to my
[1:01:55] brother on the phone today he said it
[1:01:57] seemed like he was interested he said
[1:01:59] but by the end he didn't want to talk
[1:02:00] about it anymore he said I came to
[1:02:02] church he said I felt so empty
[1:02:05] today I felt like I had no hope I I felt
[1:02:08] like uh what's the purpose of this
[1:02:10] what's what's the struggle like why is
[1:02:11] this all four he said I came to church I
[1:02:13] felt empty he said and then you brought
[1:02:15] it all the way down to this and showed
[1:02:17] this is the reward the future home
[1:02:20] walking with Jesus is the reward if you
[1:02:22] can just walk through this life the toil
[1:02:26] and snares of this life there is a
[1:02:28] reward for it God sees you Hallelujah
[1:02:31] and I'll say like this he's already
[1:02:32] walking with you amen
[1:02:34] hallelujah he's already walking with you
[1:02:37] but you actually get the the the
[1:02:39] spiritual reality of it in the natural
[1:02:41] with the glorified body you actually get
[1:02:43] the glorified walk with him in that
[1:02:45] Heavenly City in that future home you
[1:02:48] actually get that extra reward and he
[1:02:50] said that's just what I needed and he
[1:02:52] cried tears of joy Hallelujah because
[1:02:55] Jesus Promised as if you can walk
[1:02:57] through this life you'll walk with me in
[1:02:59] white
[1:03:00] hallelujah amen church that's what I
[1:03:02] call an ontime
[1:03:04] God I didn't know what to preach I I
[1:03:06] didn't even know how to end that I think
[1:03:07] I I was like Lord help me how do I end
[1:03:08] this sermon you know I just I feel led
[1:03:10] to go to those scriptures and the last
[1:03:12] scriptures were the ones that quote was
[1:03:14] the one he needed the most
[1:03:17] amen I said now the brother use that KN
[1:03:20] to cause you to pray more I said
[1:03:23] remember I had six siblings right first
[1:03:26] it was uh Simon came in then me and then
[1:03:29] Betsy then cam Paul's received it and he
[1:03:32] you know he's he loves the Lord and
[1:03:34] we're talking about it so look we just
[1:03:36] got one Hallelujah five out of six
[1:03:39] that's pretty good I like 100% amen we
[1:03:42] just got to keep praying Amen to be
[1:03:44] buried in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ Hallelujah he's got
[1:03:50] 10 so we got to have hope and we got to
[1:03:53] realize just keep eating the word of God
[1:03:56] just keep the sweetness on your lips
[1:03:58] amen keep the sweetness of the testimony
[1:04:00] on your lips and pretty soon people will
[1:04:02] see you really love Jesus amen it's not
[1:04:05] about some man it's not about some tapes
[1:04:06] not about some headquarters it's about
[1:04:08] Jesus Christ Hallelujah getting back to
[1:04:10] the word of God
[1:04:13] hallelujah yes they' walked through the
[1:04:15] world and had not partaken of it what's
[1:04:18] partaken mean that means
[1:04:20] communion he says they had not let the
[1:04:23] World Systems overcome them
[1:04:27] when the illustrious names of that age
[1:04:29] had yielded to the blandishment of the
[1:04:32] state and the The Chosen political
[1:04:34] mindedness rather than the spiritual
[1:04:35] mindness and were on their way back into
[1:04:37] the world these few stood for the word
[1:04:38] of God and thereby honored the Lord now
[1:04:42] he would honor them in return
[1:04:45] Hallelujah so it's just like that story
[1:04:47] brother R said he was in Israel and he
[1:04:50] watched a Shepherd lead his flock right
[1:04:53] through the market where there's food
[1:04:55] and dat and Kiwis and all this he said
[1:04:58] they walked right through and not one of
[1:05:00] them jumped up and started eating
[1:05:01] because they were trained to the voice
[1:05:04] of their Shepherd Church don't you know
[1:05:05] that's how we are today the great
[1:05:07] Shepherd Jesus Christ leads us right
[1:05:09] through Leo DEA there's this and that
[1:05:11] all these Temptations but we're sheep of
[1:05:14] God Amen we're obedient to the word of
[1:05:17] God we forfeit our rights amen we do not
[1:05:20] partake of these things but we've
[1:05:21] decided to follow Jesus I have decided
[1:05:24] no turning back back amen amen
[1:05:27] hallelujah and if we can partake of him
[1:05:30] while we walk in this life and not
[1:05:32] partake of the things of the world then
[1:05:34] Jesus rewards us I'll also walk you up
[1:05:36] to the tree of life amen to the rivers
[1:05:39] of life and I'll give you a drink at the
[1:05:42] rivers of the Throne of God hallelujah
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] amen what a blessing they shall walk
[1:05:49] with me in white he says for they are
[1:05:53] worthy you have partaken Glory you
[1:05:56] partaken of the things of
[1:05:58] God and not partaken of the things of
[1:06:01] the world for they were death unto
[1:06:05] you they identified themselves with him
[1:06:08] on Earth and now he would identify
[1:06:10] himself with them in the New
[1:06:13] Jerusalem Hallelujah brother says it
[1:06:16] makes me rejoice and makes me want to
[1:06:18] weep to think that of his condescension
[1:06:21] for you and I will note that Jesus is
[1:06:24] not dressed in another color different
[1:06:26] from the Saints as Earthly leaders would
[1:06:29] do right all the big leaders of the word
[1:06:31] they all got their their their their
[1:06:33] beautiful clothes and all these things
[1:06:35] but said that's not a real leader a real
[1:06:37] leader wants to be like his
[1:06:39] people hallelujah he says no they are
[1:06:43] like him he is like them they are like
[1:06:46] him even as John said they see him as he
[1:06:49] is they have a body likened under his
[1:06:52] glorious body with a robe that is white
[1:06:55] Hallelujah I'm trying to close here I'm
[1:06:58] really trying there there's my hour
[1:07:00] right there there's my last seconds of
[1:07:01] my hour
[1:07:05] Hallelujah let me just read I'm just
[1:07:07] going to go over this briefly and maybe
[1:07:08] I could do a part two I don't know we'll
[1:07:09] see but John chapter 6 is a beautiful
[1:07:12] chapter in this chapter in verse 35 he
[1:07:14] said I am the bread of life I
[1:07:17] am Jehovah I am I am who I am he said I
[1:07:21] am the bread of life in other words I'm
[1:07:22] your bread I'm your food
[1:07:26] in verse 40 he says everyone that
[1:07:27] believes has eternal
[1:07:30] life and I will raise him up oh church
[1:07:33] if we make Jesus our bread if we make
[1:07:37] Jesus our bread he will raise us up
[1:07:39] hallelujah what a promise it's so simple
[1:07:43] right just keep feeding on the word of
[1:07:45] God and God will resurrect your body
[1:07:48] Hallelujah verse 48 he says again I am
[1:07:51] that bread of life in verse 57 51 he
[1:07:53] says I am the living bread oh it's not a
[1:07:56] stale bread it's not a rotten bread it's
[1:07:58] not a dead bread it's not Stony bread
[1:08:00] it's living bread Hallelujah God's word
[1:08:03] is life to
[1:08:04] us verse
[1:08:07] 54 can you put that up there John 654
[1:08:09] thank you hun who so eateth my flesh and
[1:08:11] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:08:13] I will raise him up in the last day
[1:08:16] everybody say haath ready you already
[1:08:18] got it brother said you already got it
[1:08:20] let's thank God cuz we already got it

[1:08:24] I've already got it amen
[1:08:26] I believe I've eaten the flesh I've
[1:08:29] drinken the blood amen I partake of the
[1:08:32] word I worship in the Holy Spirit I let
[1:08:35] I take the holy spirit in I've already
[1:08:37] got eternal life
[1:08:38] Hallelujah because I'm eating on him now
[1:08:43] Hallelujah verse 57 eat and live eat
[1:08:48] means to live as a living father sent me
[1:08:50] and I believe I'm sorry and I live by
[1:08:52] the father so he that eateth me even he
[1:08:54] shall live by me so eating is believing
[1:08:59] in other words Church what we preach
[1:09:01] what what you read in your Bible you've
[1:09:02] got to believe it and act upon it that's
[1:09:05] when you know you're eating so John
[1:09:07] would know he's eating once he starts
[1:09:09] prophesying to somebody else Glory
[1:09:11] that's why it's so important when you
[1:09:12] testify to somebody else it just gives
[1:09:15] you a reminder yes I'm eating on the
[1:09:16] things of God hallelujah I'm living on
[1:09:19] the word of God because I'm eating and
[1:09:21] I'm testifying I'm talking about this
[1:09:22] sweetness that I taste in my mouth all
[1:09:24] the time amen talking about this
[1:09:26] delicious honey that I'm eating all the
[1:09:28] time it's the word of God
[1:09:31] hallelujah you've been a good audience
[1:09:33] here thank you and this is the verse I
[1:09:35] one of the verses I used yesterday John
[1:09:37] 663 he said Jesus sayith unto them he
[1:09:40] said uh the words that I speak unto you
[1:09:42] they are spirit and they are
[1:09:45] life see the word is the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:48] the holy spirit is life so we got to
[1:09:51] keep eating the word keep believing the
[1:09:53] word of God
[1:09:57] Hallelujah and of course you know the
[1:09:59] end of the
[1:10:00] chapter
[1:10:03] um the disciples this is a hard saying
[1:10:06] Jesus eat your flesh drink your blood
[1:10:09] who can hear
[1:10:10] it then he says then then the Bible said
[1:10:13] 70 of them left and Jesus asks his other
[1:10:15] 12 do you want to go too and Peter says
[1:10:17] where are we going to go you've got the
[1:10:19] words of eternal
[1:10:20] life where am I going to go I can't go
[1:10:23] anywhere else I got to go to where the
[1:10:25] word of of God is being preached where
[1:10:26] it's lived I got to go where it's sweet
[1:10:28] as honey praise
[1:10:30] God I want to see a preacher preach it
[1:10:32] like it's life and death amen hallelujah
[1:10:35] that's what I preciate about brother
[1:10:36] Paul and Aaron just their sincerity you
[1:10:38] can tell they live it they love it amen
[1:10:40] they want it they want they want to uh
[1:10:42] obey every word of God
[1:10:44] hallelujah remember I'm going to do a
[1:10:46] few more first John 511 this is the
[1:10:48] record that God hath given to us eternal
[1:10:51] life and this life is in his
[1:10:53] son okay so when you have this Spirit of
[1:10:55] the sun you have life you've already got

[1:11:00] eternal life ready I've already got
[1:11:02] eternal life he's G he's already given
[1:11:04] it to you just like the book he said

[1:11:08] amen right he says give it to you here
[1:11:11] come get it okay now take it now eat it
[1:11:13] so you got to take it and you got to eat
[1:11:15] it praise God Amen there's two steps in

[1:11:20] you you you did the right part coming to
[1:11:22] church you're taking it now let's eat it
[1:11:24] let's believe it praise God
[1:11:26] see that you got to take it and you got
[1:11:28] to eat it by God's
[1:11:29] grace uh verse 13 513 these things have
[1:11:33] a written unto you that believe on the
[1:11:34] name of the son of God that ye may know
[1:11:36] that you have eternal life see John
[1:11:38] wrote these things so you know it right
[1:11:41] the word of God is written so you know
[1:11:43] it and that you may believe on the name
[1:11:46] of the son of God so see knowing
[1:11:48] believing having eternal life it's all
[1:11:50] tied together Hallelujah the more you
[1:11:52] believe the more God is real to you the
[1:11:53] more you know you've got eternal life
[1:11:57] Glory I know everybody's getting tired
[1:11:58] here I'm trying to finish it I really
[1:12:00] don't want to do a part two on this I
[1:12:01] kind like to get some other things here
[1:12:02] by God's grace but it's a beautiful
[1:12:04] thought
[1:12:05] Hallelujah 1 Peter 5'8 says be sober be
[1:12:09] vilant because your adversary the devil
[1:12:11] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[1:12:15] whom he may
[1:12:16] devour okay so Satan's trying to consume
[1:12:19] us Satan's trying to devour our lives
[1:12:22] and make our lives go astray right ruin
[1:12:24] our
[1:12:26] testimony verse 9 whom resists steadfast
[1:12:30] in the faith that means stand your
[1:12:31] ground don't let him get more ground in
[1:12:33] your life say this is as far as you're
[1:12:36] going devil you're not going any further
[1:12:38] than this and then you start rebuking
[1:12:40] him remember resist him he'll flee flee
[1:12:43] means to run Satan will run from you if
[1:12:46] you got the word of God in your mouth
[1:12:47] Hallelujah think of that he just doesn't
[1:12:49] go away like okay fine whatever you know
[1:12:51] he doesn't walk away like we walk away
[1:12:53] I'll see you later actually runs
[1:12:56] away because he he can't handle the
[1:12:59] presence the Holiness of Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] amen he's such a a low Wicked Spirit a
[1:13:06] unclean Spirit he he wants to be far
[1:13:08] away from the Holy Spirit oh let's keep
[1:13:10] the holy spirit in our mouth let's keep
[1:13:12] the holy spirit in our stomachs
[1:13:13] Hallelujah and we'll walk with Jesus in
[1:13:15] white
[1:13:16] Hallelujah but look he's trying to
[1:13:19] devour
[1:13:21] you but we must resist him knowing that
[1:13:24] the same afflictions are accomplish in
[1:13:25] your brethren that in the world so see
[1:13:27] sometimes we're going to go through the
[1:13:27] fires of Affliction like our brother
[1:13:29] preached last week sometimes we'll go
[1:13:31] through very hard afflictions but the
[1:13:34] Bible says always in those moments
[1:13:36] resist Satan he'll flee from you draw
[1:13:39] nigh to God God will draw nigh to
[1:13:42] you and then finally 1 Corinthians this
[1:13:44] is my last verse 1 Corinthians
[1:13:47] 15:54 so in this corruptible shall put
[1:13:49] on incorruption So speaking of the body
[1:13:53] change and this more shall put on
[1:13:56] mortality then shall be brought to pass
[1:13:58] the saying that is written death is
[1:14:00] swallowed up in
[1:14:02] Victory oh death where is your
[1:14:05] sting oh grave where is thy
[1:14:09] Victory Hallelujah the sting of death is
[1:14:13] sin and the strength of sin is the law
[1:14:15] but thanks be to God which give us the
[1:14:18] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:20] notice that the grave doesn't have the
[1:14:23] victory death doesn't have the victory
[1:14:25] amen you've got the victory
[1:14:28] amen CU you've got Jesus Christ you've
[1:14:31] got eternal life hallelujah amen there
[1:14:33] is no victory in death there is no
[1:14:35] victory in the grave Hallelujah there's
[1:14:37] only Victory in Jesus my Savior forever
[1:14:40] Hallelujah and I love this thought the
[1:14:42] Bible said eat the book right if we eat
[1:14:45] the word and we me if we constantly
[1:14:49] Feast on the word of God then the Bible
[1:14:51] says the Holy Ghost will swallow us up
[1:14:55] if we swallow down the word of God's
[1:14:57] service week after week we are promised
[1:15:00] God will come and swallow us up
[1:15:03] amen oh it's like Paul said I'm trying
[1:15:05] to attain to what's already attained me
[1:15:08] oh Hallelujah I'm eating on this eternal
[1:15:11] life that's going to eat me up
[1:15:13] Hallelujah in other words I want to
[1:15:15] consume as much of God as I possibly can
[1:15:18] because I know one day God will consume
[1:15:20] my life Hallelujah he'll consume and eat
[1:15:23] up all the sin nature and I'll be given
[1:15:25] a brand new body a body like under his
[1:15:27] glorious body if I can only feed on the
[1:15:30] word of God if I can only eat the book
