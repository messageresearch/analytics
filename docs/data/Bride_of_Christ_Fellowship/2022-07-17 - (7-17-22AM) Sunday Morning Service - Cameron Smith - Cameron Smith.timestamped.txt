[0:38] fellowship in the word amen
[0:40] everybody happy to be christians this
[0:41] morning
[0:42] and you know uh in the old testament
[0:45] there was what they called the feast of
[0:47] pentecost
[0:49] and that feast they had a main
[0:51] requirement that you worship the lord
[0:53] right it said god gave israel that
[0:56] commandments that even if the strangers
[0:58] are here let them rejoice amen amen
[1:01] hallelujah so everything they have
[1:03] breath let them praise the lord amen

[1:11] to blow in the breeze of the wind but
[1:13] what we'll receive the wind of the holy
[1:16] ghost and we'll let god know that we
[1:18] love him amen
[1:19] why because look at what his mercy did
[1:22] for us amen
[1:24] we all should be on a path to hell but
[1:26] oh god thank god for that word where he
[1:29] said he first loved us amen
[1:32] hallelujah so man we just appreciate the
[1:34] lord this morning
[1:36] i can say word afterward about your
[1:38] pastor
[1:39] my natural brother but yet uh more
[1:42] importantly my spiritual brother um and
[1:44] by
[1:45] the hand of god almighty uh we
[1:48] uh god allowed us to come out together
[1:51] and we have been pressing this battle
[1:53] for a long time fighting for the truth
[1:56] earnestly contending for the faith amen
[1:59] and uh that's uh where we're at amen so
[2:02] we sure are glad to be here i love my
[2:04] brother's ministry as goes without
[2:06] saying and uh just uh
[2:08] all the work that the lord's doing here
[2:09] we rejoice for it and uh
[2:12] got a brother over here i haven't met
[2:13] yet god bless you brother kim smith and
[2:15] uh anyway we just sure appreciate the
[2:18] lord and uh you know the way i am i kind
[2:20] of i don't mind just getting excited so
[2:24] just
[2:25] bear with me if you could
[2:28] so
[2:29] revelations 5 1.
[2:31] i come here and i have i do i purposely
[2:34] don't look at what your preacher's
[2:36] preaching i don't want to know that
[2:38] he told me over a text one time a while
[2:40] back he says he's preaching on doctrine
[2:42] of the devils i don't come here to speak
[2:44] any doctrines of devils i come here to
[2:46] speak the word of god and i pray that
[2:48] you'll find that that's the truth
[2:50] and uh anything i preach i make sure
[2:52] that you know we're we're
[2:54] we're studied up prayed up we're we're
[2:56] trying to find the mind of god and i and
[2:58] i i'm at a place where i'm past creeds
[2:59] and dogmas i understand what that's
[3:01] about i understand what it nickel aids
[3:02] and spirit's about and god's purpose for
[3:05] this hour is he's trying to get the
[3:06] laity in condition amen uh whether you
[3:09] know it or not that's you amen
[3:11] hallelujah uh remember in first
[3:12] corinthians 14 it says there that
[3:15] if the heathen and the unlearned if they
[3:17] would come into your assembly and all
[3:19] prophesy
[3:21] hallelujah and what the secrets of their
[3:23] heart would be made manifest that they
[3:26] would uh say of a truth you have god
[3:28] amen
[3:29] so those spiritual gifts that god's
[3:31] trying to get as laity he's trying to do
[3:34] that
[3:35] uh what in order to show
[3:37] not just that we're living good clean
[3:39] lives but he is in your midst amen not
[3:42] just to clean you up but to get you in
[3:45] service amen amen hallelujah amen
[3:49] so by uh
[3:51] the lord's leading i had some ideas but
[3:53] uh this is where we'll go today
[3:55] revelations 5 1 got another passage
[3:57] after this it says and i saw on the
[3:58] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[4:01] a book written within and on the
[4:02] backside sealed with seven seals and i
[4:04] saw a strong angel
[4:06] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[4:08] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[4:11] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[4:13] on earth neither under the earth was
[4:15] able to open the book neither to look
[4:18] there on and i wept much because no man
[4:21] was found worthy to open and to read the
[4:22] book neither to look there on
[4:25] and one of the elders saith unto me
[4:27] wheat not behold the lion of the tribe
[4:29] of judah
[4:30] the root of david has prevailed to open
[4:33] the book and to loose the sea seven
[4:35] seals thereof
[4:37] and be i be held and low in the midst of
[4:39] the throne and the four beasts in the
[4:41] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[4:42] had been slain oh what a pristine moment
[4:48] amen having seven horns and seven eyes
[4:50] are you glad to be those seven horns
[4:52] today
[4:53] amen which are the seven spirits of god
[4:56] sent forth into all the earth and he
[4:58] came and took the book out of the right
[4:59] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[5:01] there it is perhaps some of the most uh
[5:03] deeper
[5:04] doctrines that we could work with here
[5:06] i'm not here to do that i leave that to
[5:08] your pastor i don't want to i know what
[5:10] it's like to have somebody come here
[5:11] pulpit and they just kind of unpreach
[5:13] everything you preach so
[5:15] we're not here here to do that we're
[5:16] here to add a thought but this is the
[5:18] direction we'll go amen i mean i'm gonna
[5:20] love this you realize this is the most
[5:22] sublime portion of scripture the prophet
[5:24] said
[5:24] that's right when he took the book
[5:27] because remember he was going to take
[5:28] his possession
[5:30] well what's his possession what's he
[5:31] after he's after you
[5:34] he's after a bride all right one more
[5:36] spot and we'll get going i don't mean to
[5:37] keep standing
[5:39] ephesians 1 3 it says blessed be the god
[5:42] and father of our lord jesus christ who
[5:45] has blessed us with all spiritual
[5:47] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[5:50] according as he has chosen us in him
[5:54] before the foundation of the world that
[5:56] we should be holy and without blame
[5:59] before him in love amen having
[6:02] predestinated
[6:03] us unto the adoption of children just
[6:06] the preachers
[6:08] us
[6:09] everybody in that ephesians church you
[6:12] were predestinated to become the
[6:15] adoption of jesus christ amen glory amen
[6:18] hallelujah
[6:21] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:22] will to the praise of the glory of his
[6:24] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[6:28] in the beloved when did he make you
[6:30] except in the blood and the beloved
[6:32] when he died on that cross for you amen
[6:34] well before that your name was on a book
[6:37] amen amen all right let's bow our heads
[6:39] for a word of prayer hallelujah our most
[6:42] beloved lord jesus christ we
[6:44] just as humbly as we know how god come
[6:46] this to this spot where we're just
[6:49] asking you to bless the reading of your
[6:51] word lord that you come down and see the
[6:54] needs of this people lord thou knowest
[6:56] oh god i i i don't have much to offer
[6:59] lord but all i have i'm just going to
[7:02] give to you lord
[7:03] you don't need my mind so take it oh god
[7:06] you don't need uh my mouth oh god but
[7:08] just take what i have and use it for
[7:10] your glory and lord let them realize
[7:13] that there's an amen in the laity today
[7:15] oh god and the more that they worship
[7:17] and love you the more you will inhabit
[7:19] your police of your people lord so may
[7:22] we see that lord and lord we're just
[7:24] asking that you just
[7:26] reveal these thoughts to the people here
[7:28] lord as uh you gave it to me so
[7:31] gently one day lord uh i'm looking for
[7:34] this word to be fulfilled lord and lord
[7:36] the church hears as well it's getting
[7:38] very dark uh sodom and gomorrah has
[7:41] encompassed this lord and now we're
[7:43] asking oh god just get us ready for this
[7:45] exodus in such a way oh god uh by the
[7:48] companionship that you offer to your
[7:51] children of the head uniting with the
[7:53] body of god and we're just asking over a
[7:56] positionally place your church oh god in
[7:58] the name of jesus christ we love you we
[8:01] ask you to have your way now as we say
[8:03] amen amen
[8:05] amen
[8:06] a little bit of a strange topic this
[8:08] morning
[8:09] but we have felt ready to come this
[8:11] direction i wish that's uh
[8:13] i know i would say this that uh if you
[8:16] have a need on your heart
[8:18] uh just keep on amen in the word keep on
[8:21] loving god
[8:22] sometimes god
[8:24] uh he'll come down and he'll answer your
[8:26] prayers he'll he'll move on you right
[8:29] i remember when i when uh when i started
[8:31] preaching there uh i was just up going
[8:34] and i'm an inspirational preacher by
[8:36] nature uh but i was up there just
[8:39] preaching away and things just started
[8:41] rolling out of my mouth i i i just
[8:43] started blasting i said shame on you
[8:45] people who who go to
[8:47] who come late to church because you want
[8:49] to go grocery shopping before church
[8:52] i just started nailing it
[8:54] and i just went on that rant it's been
[8:55] many years ago
[8:57] and anyway or after service i got done
[8:59] preaching
[9:00] and up comes this couple
[9:03] and they come up in front of
[9:05] me and they said we need prayer and i
[9:06] said well you need prayer for and said
[9:08] well we got a really bad habit i said
[9:10] what's that and they said uh remember
[9:12] you said something about people you know
[9:14] going grocery shopping trying to do
[9:15] everything before church yeah that was
[9:17] us
[9:18] they said in fact we were late tonight
[9:19] because we did it praise god but you
[9:23] know we have a type of god that does
[9:25] that thing does those things amen
[9:27] remember according to hebrews 4 12 that
[9:30] what his word is a discerner of the
[9:33] thoughts and intents of the heart amen
[9:35] so even today you've come to rejoice and
[9:39] worship jesus christ and yet how he
[9:42] answers back to your worship is he will
[9:45] come down and speak to you directly
[9:49] through the word of god amen and what
[9:51] doing that what he wants to do is he
[9:54] wants to hit the needs of your heart
[9:55] amen he wants to touch right where
[9:58] you're at if he if you're sad he wants
[10:00] to lift you up amen if you're frustrated
[10:02] he
[10:13] he purchased it at calvary and now the
[10:16] potential is unlimited amen
[10:19] it's us we've got to believe this word
[10:22] amen if we believe it remember your
[10:25] prophet said whatever you will become on
[10:27] this earth you'll do it by faith amen
[10:30] amen oh my lord
[10:33] or what you believe
[10:35] is it possible he said
[10:37] anything is possible amen
[10:40] if you believe
[10:42] now maybe they're saying those things
[10:44] standing at some picture and
[10:46] looking at a few things up here but i
[10:48] trust this will be a blessing to you yes
[10:50] we're going to go a little line here by
[10:53] the lord's grace
[10:54] the shared power
[10:57] of the signet all right man uh somebody
[11:00] say what's a signal you'll find out
[11:01] momentarily
[11:02] uh but uh we're just gonna bring this
[11:04] thought to you because how many believe
[11:06] that you're closer to your redemption
[11:08] than you've ever been amen amen amen
[11:11] it's drawing nine remember the bible
[11:13] says look up for your redemption draw at
[11:15] night right and we're in those moments
[11:17] right now where god is beginning to
[11:20] positionally place his people like never
[11:22] before how do you say that well if the
[11:25] world is coming to its fruit the
[11:28] serpents are becoming to one of
[11:30] serpentines remember the first serpent
[11:33] hybrid was a murderer that's right
[11:35] that's right hallelujah and what we're
[11:37] living in those days as the days of noah
[11:40] as the days of loss it's getting really
[11:44] dark but your prophet said that watch
[11:47] that when the challenges are harder god
[11:50] will raise a standard amen and lord he
[11:53] will come back what that evil is he said
[11:56] it required a greater thing he said in
[11:59] question answer 64 right so god provides
[12:02] it amen if you need a greater move he's
[12:04] here to give it amen
[12:06] amen because ultimately let's just jump
[12:09] to the end what he wants to do is give
[12:12] you a share of power
[12:14] now we just opened up with revelations
[12:16] 5. i'm not going to go very far here but
[12:18] i'm just going to set a little
[12:19] foundation
[12:21] and what this message has done for us it
[12:24] has revealed the opening of the seven
[12:26] seals amen yes hallelujah there he is
[12:30] and i would consider this the best
[12:31] rendering i can find but right there it
[12:33] is a seven sealed book
[12:36] and that was why in the hands of god
[12:38] almighty amen
[12:40] and watch there
[12:42] what i'd like you to see is here are
[12:45] seals on that scroll amen yes now
[12:48] remember as you see here there's an
[12:51] impression
[12:52] that needs to be made on that seal all
[12:55] right to make that and what they would
[12:57] do is this would be clay right here
[13:01] and while they would actually take a
[13:02] signet and press into it and then make
[13:05] an impression there all right now i'm
[13:07] doing this from uh for a reason because
[13:10] many of us you might be in the thought
[13:12] and say god uh i know by the scripture
[13:16] uh revelations 5 is something so
[13:19] phenomenal and it is but god is what
[13:22] painting a picture through the word of
[13:26] god to show us his plan the whole time
[13:29] all right
[13:30] now the way we'd like to begin this is
[13:33] to show you that that seal according to
[13:35] the prophet he said he said that the
[13:38] seal it actually shows a finished work
[13:41] all right so that seal that we seen
[13:43] right there it was on a scroll all right
[13:46] now somebody wrote that scroll amen and
[13:49] when they were done with it they put a
[13:51] shield on it and it would mean that it
[13:53] was finished completely
[13:55] amen
[13:56] and remember because he put the seal on
[13:59] it nobody could touch it until it went
[14:02] to the proper place to be opened amen
[14:05] yeah yeah we are going to get to a
[14:07] spiritual tie in a minute here but we
[14:09] find that what it secondly it shows
[14:12] ownership amen yes somebody owned that
[14:16] scroll amen yes
[14:19] hallelujah it was his and his alone
[14:23] together amen yes that's why oh if you
[14:26] thank god he doesn't say in revelations
[14:28] 5 it was jesus christ but when we see it
[14:31] was a bloody lamb the bride has the
[14:34] revelation it was jesus christ
[14:37] amen
[14:39] amen
[14:40] thirdly the seal it shows security
[14:45] that nobody can break that seal
[14:48] until the seal
[14:50] or the scroll
[14:52] would go to where it's supposed to go
[14:54] that's right
[14:56] hallelujah why are you saying all that
[14:58] because if you see on the spiritual
[15:00] context you know
[15:02] uh what god allowed that to be shown as
[15:06] ephesians 1 13
[15:08] says in whom he also trusted oh i hope
[15:11] you've got some trust this morning amen
[15:15] after that he heard the word of truth
[15:18] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[15:20] also after that you believed after you
[15:23] believed you were sealed with that holy
[15:27] spirit of promise amen
[15:30] wait a minute you got to seal the book
[15:32] but yet he says you're sealed amen
[15:35] that means that he'll show an ownership
[15:37] over your
[15:47] [Applause]
[16:00] well how is god looking at you
[16:03] your prophet said when he put your name
[16:05] on the book you can see you no other way
[16:08] than what you were on that book
[16:11] [Applause]
[16:22] [Applause]
[16:22] [Music]
[16:24] [Applause]
[16:29] which he says
[16:31] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[16:35] until
[16:37] the redemption
[16:39] of the purchased possession amen that's
[16:41] who you are
[16:43] they purchase you all right we're laying
[16:45] a foundation
[16:47] hallelujah the earnest which means the
[16:50] down payment
[16:52] the down payment was to seal you
[16:57] you have to have the revelation you're
[17:00] finished
[17:01] [Music]
[17:02] he's finished it at the cross of calvary
[17:06] amen
[17:09] you have to not only believe that
[17:11] you have to believe you're secure
[17:13] yes so when the bible says that he's the
[17:16] author of your faith
[17:19] we can get hung out there and say he's
[17:21] the author but he didn't only say that
[17:23] he said he's the finisher
[17:27] all right
[17:35] [Applause]
[17:41] amen
[17:42] amen so we see
[17:45] his desire
[17:47] is to make you
[17:49] full of revelation yes to know what
[17:52] truth is
[17:54] heard someone say here today
[17:56] in the message they said that the
[17:57] doctrine doesn't matter oh yes it does
[17:59] yes it does i disagree with that then
[18:01] why would god send the seventh angel
[18:03] right he sent the seventh angel to
[18:06] finish the mysteries according to
[18:07] revelations 10 7. that's right
[18:09] hallelujah so i say this god open the
[18:12] word ah amen
[18:14] glory
[18:16] so god gave you
[18:18] the holy ghost baptism or christ in you
[18:22] the hope of glory
[18:23] so that you would know who you are
[18:27] so many times in the message the prophet
[18:29] said you don't know who you are
[18:33] you've got to get away from all the fear
[18:36] and the scare amen
[18:40] i'm saying we've been listening this
[18:41] message for 50 years amen
[18:44] 60 years these things have been rolling
[18:46] on a lot of us a little bit too young
[18:47] for that but what you have caused it is
[18:50] trying to get you to believe that amen
[18:53] amen
[18:55] amen hallelujah
[18:57] so
[18:59] he shows that the book in heaven
[19:03] is the same
[19:05] and characteristic as what accompanies
[19:07] your life
[19:10] these principles i just lose everybody
[19:11] on that
[19:12] remember you're a finished product yes
[19:15] you got ownership security
[19:17] you got these things what wooing over
[19:20] your life
[19:22] waking up every morning and lord his
[19:25] mercies are renewed right you're waking
[19:28] up hey the bible says sorrow that's for
[19:31] a night but joy cometh in the morning
[19:34] amen
[19:35] that is the promise of
[19:39] [Applause]
[19:43] he said now those two great things
[19:46] now we're going to start first upon the
[19:48] seal of god
[19:49] now what is a seal
[19:52] the first place to see on the bible back
[19:54] in the days before people had educated
[19:56] like they are now they usually
[19:59] their seal was their signature just like
[20:01] we used today as our name
[20:04] sometimes the romans are and on back in
[20:06] jewish and way way back in the eastern
[20:08] early eastern countries they'd have a
[20:10] ring
[20:11] that had their seal and stamp it on
[20:13] something if they couldn't sign their
[20:16] name that seal a seal was a bonafide
[20:19] statement
[20:20] that was sealed by the seal
[20:23] nauseous and to try to copy this
[20:26] i'm going to go somewhere with that
[20:27] later but he said yeah was a capital
[20:30] fine
[20:32] ah
[20:34] just like it would be now to try to
[20:36] forge a check
[20:38] hallelujah
[20:40] you see you can't fake the seal
[20:43] yes you can't impersonate the seal amen
[20:48] there's a fine with that glory
[20:51] and usually the man wore it and had a
[20:53] seal worn on the back of his wrist or
[20:56] either on his ring and he would seal
[20:57] instead of signing his own name that was
[20:59] to show that it was he had sealed it
[21:03] all right
[21:04] yeah let's look at this real quick here
[21:06] this is why i love i'm gonna do some a
[21:07] little bit of a history lesson for a
[21:09] little archaeology and put right in
[21:10] there because you know there's people
[21:12] that still believe
[21:14] that there's no proof that israel was in
[21:16] that land
[21:18] but if you actually look at what they
[21:19] found and what they've been finding and
[21:22] what they continue to find there is an
[21:24] overwhelming amount of evidence that
[21:27] says that what is real that is her
[21:30] homeland amen right
[21:33] lord
[21:34] it ain't the palestinians it was given
[21:36] to god's people amen
[21:39] and someday the god of the jews will
[21:42] bring his gentile life and settle down
[21:45] there on mount zion amen yes glory
[21:48] there'll be a city 1500 miles by 1500
[21:52] miles
[21:54] [Applause]
[22:05] [Applause]
[22:07] because there's a rapture that's coming
[22:09] for you
[22:10] [Applause]
[22:15] now watch this
[22:17] i got the writing here
[22:19] that's king jeroboam seal they found
[22:24] he did that
[22:25] i'd like to have my pocket and sure
[22:27] because that's pretty cool
[22:29] i think that's pretty cool
[22:31] then what they recently found hezekiah's
[22:34] yes amen found hezekiah seal
[22:37] now watch this
[22:39] the importance attached to seals in the
[22:42] east
[22:43] is so great
[22:45] that without one
[22:47] no document
[22:49] is regarded as authentic
[22:52] no seal it doesn't mean a thing that's
[22:55] right that's right good
[22:58] amen the use of some method of stealing
[23:00] obviously therefore
[23:02] or promote antiquity
[23:05] notice how great god is from before the
[23:09] foundation of the world he had a book
[23:12] that's right hallelujah yes
[23:16] and what he could want allow that to be
[23:18] a closed book to the people
[23:21] yes yes
[23:22] remember when your prophet preached the
[23:24] sales he said there was elijah he said
[23:26] he was the only one
[23:28] right and brother said it was that god
[23:30] took and broke one of those seals and
[23:32] revealed to elijah that there was
[23:34] actually seven thousand more amen all
[23:37] right brother nice
[23:39] good
[23:39] he opened the word to him amen
[23:43] show him where he was not alone but
[23:45] there were more like him in it oh let
[23:48] his body catch that mind amen there's
[23:51] not sinners sitting next to you but it
[23:53] is the one it is the work of grace the
[23:56] seeds of predestination
[23:59] of god sitting on you right next to me
[24:08] [Applause]
[24:19] some pretty nice king seals
[24:23] but now watch
[24:24] the seal is so important
[24:26] that if there wasn't a seal on it it
[24:28] didn't mean a thing
[24:30] people would people niche they say
[24:32] what's this about
[24:34] right you write a letter ain't gonna see
[24:36] online you give the
[24:37] lydia lady look at that she's from the
[24:38] east she said what's this
[24:40] that is from i don't know if that's from
[24:41] my uncle camera now there's no seal on
[24:46] that's how important then watch
[24:49] from the get-go god allowed the people
[24:52] of the earth to catch the revelation of
[24:54] a seal
[24:55] amen and begin to use it
[24:57] because he had a purpose
[24:59] in the book of revelations that he would
[25:01] reveal to his ending that's right amen
[25:04] glory oh mom that's right don't worry
[25:06] we're just warming up right now
[25:08] hallelujah now watch this
[25:11] where there's a good use of a seal
[25:14] they also these men who have caught the
[25:17] mind of god and used seals
[25:21] they've tried to do it falsely at times
[25:22] that's right they've tried to usurp
[25:25] authority
[25:26] where they did not have the ability to
[25:29] usurp authority
[25:31] perhaps a great example is matthew 27 62
[25:35] it says now the next day that followed
[25:38] the day of preparation the chief priests
[25:40] and pharisees came together in the pilot
[25:41] saying sir we remember that deceiver
[25:44] said while he was yet alive after three
[25:46] days that were raised again
[25:48] command therefore that the sepulcher be
[25:51] made sure until the third day lest his
[25:53] disciples come by night and steal him
[25:55] away and say unto the people he has
[25:57] risen from the dead so the last heir
[26:00] shall be worse than the first amen there
[26:02] was only one heir and that was on their
[26:05] side amen right
[26:07] but notice what are they doing they're
[26:10] trying to keep christ in the tube
[26:14] your prophet said that's what they've
[26:15] been trying to do all this time is to
[26:18] keep the body of christ in the tomb hold
[26:21] on right right
[26:24] hallelujah but he said they can't do it
[26:30] thank you
[26:32] so much said to them you have a watch go
[26:34] your way make it as sure as you can
[26:36] so they went
[26:38] and made this a poker shirt
[26:41] sealing the stone
[26:43] and sent
[26:44] a watch
[26:46] that seal was so important
[26:49] that they tried
[26:51] to put a roman seal
[26:54] to keep jesus in the tomb
[26:58] right right but remember
[27:01] he has the logos was not in that tomb at
[27:04] that time huh that's right the scripture
[27:06] says he went to the souls in hell that's
[27:08] right right he took the keys of death in
[27:12] hell
[27:14] i noticed he did have to come back why
[27:17] was that he had a dead body in the grave
[27:20] amen
[27:22] and satan was trying to show his
[27:24] authority through a roman seal there is
[27:27] no roman catholic seal that you have to
[27:30] accept that's right
[27:33] [Applause]
[27:39] we changed it but they had no authority
[27:42] to change it this is the book that has
[27:45] been opened
[27:47] [Applause]
[27:48] [Music]
[27:50] [Applause]
[28:01] he's alive
[28:02] when he broke
[28:04] the seals off of that tomb that's right
[28:06] he showed that there was no greater king
[28:10] than who he
[28:12] [Applause]
[28:14] is no was
[28:16] authority
[28:18] than who he was that's right
[28:20] remember
[28:22] according to history
[28:23] they would place roman centurions around
[28:25] there
[28:28] that seal
[28:30] was not hard to break
[28:32] it was easy to break right
[28:36] but they put it on there to show that if
[28:39] you mess with this seal you have to mess
[28:41] with the entire roman army
[28:44] right
[28:48] hallelujah they didn't keep christ in
[28:50] the grain
[28:52] they have a u.n
[28:53] they're going to have a new world order
[28:56] they can have all these things moving
[28:57] they can have lasers and supersonic
[29:00] vests and hypervent and hydrogen this it
[29:03] cannot keep the bride down
[29:08] they are created for
[29:15] [Applause]
[29:24] when the bride comes to redemptive
[29:25] promises amen hallelujah translated
[29:29] jesus cursed the fig tree he said you'll
[29:32] do it
[29:34] right
[29:35] he says say to the mountain and it'll be
[29:38] moved if you believe in you that's right
[29:41] we must know who we are
[29:43] sure there's nothing that can seal you
[29:45] in
[29:47] ain't no devil that can seal you in a
[29:50] lie or a creed or a dog
[29:52] amen
[29:53] or even this laodicea that's right right
[29:56] there's no devil strong enough to make
[29:58] you complacent
[30:00] you have to yield to it
[30:03] but if you yield to the hearing of the
[30:05] word
[30:06] faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[30:08] the word amen yeah glory
[30:11] then faith will come from you
[30:14] so what's possible right now anything
[30:15] amen
[30:18] but the question is
[30:20] he broke
[30:21] to release the body from the grave amen
[30:24] yes yeah that body is released that's
[30:27] why in the third seal
[30:28] there came that voice in the midst and
[30:30] said hurt not the oil in the lie right
[30:33] the devil cannot hurt it yeah you want
[30:36] the holy ghost it's yours amen
[30:40] it didn't work just like it did for
[30:42] peter while peter yes make these words
[30:44] the holy ghost
[30:45] [Music]
[30:47] gentile you have the
[30:56] [Applause]
[31:01] hallelujah we're very good at sealing
[31:04] christ away were they
[31:06] hallelujah looks like they failed
[31:08] greatly
[31:09] all right
[31:10] notice your type
[31:12] here in daniel 6 remember daniel type of
[31:15] christ
[31:16] and what
[31:17] they put daniel in the pit
[31:19] with the lions good
[31:21] notice what they did now remember this
[31:23] is a tie of what christ would do
[31:27] then the king commanded they brought
[31:29] daniel cast him in the dead of lions now
[31:32] the king spake and said unto daniel by
[31:34] god whom thy servants continuing well he
[31:35] will deliver thee
[31:37] that's why jesus said destroy this
[31:40] temple in three days
[31:44] [Applause]
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:57] yes you know the prophet said the holy
[32:00] ghost is a positive force
[32:03] if he's here he's here to be positive
[32:05] he's here to make you more lonely
[32:07] he's here to make you feel more like a
[32:08] failure right he's here to turn your
[32:11] attention to his word
[32:13] why is that because you are a part of
[32:16] that word
[32:19] amen let this mind be in you that was in
[32:21] christ jesus exactly who being in the
[32:23] form of god thought in that robbery to
[32:24] be equal with god
[32:35] because i'll tell you whether you see it
[32:37] or not you've got to stay right there
[32:39] with the purchase power of that blood
[32:42] and say it's mine amen yes oh my i got
[32:45] some stuff tonight
[32:46] man help us to finish this baby but
[32:48] we'll go there or we'll go somewhere if
[32:50] the lord wants i don't know
[32:52] so what a stone was brought and laid
[32:54] upon the mouth of the net
[32:56] they put a stone
[32:58] over where they placed christ yes
[33:01] and the king sealed it
[33:03] with his own signet
[33:06] the king himself now notice the word and
[33:10] he came out
[33:11] and put a seal on it himself
[33:14] he sealed him
[33:18] with a secret
[33:22] and with the signal of his lords
[33:24] that the purpose might not be changed
[33:28] concerning daniel
[33:30] notice there was
[33:32] king of persia persia and they still had
[33:35] no ability
[33:37] and being the the dominion of power on
[33:40] earth at that time
[33:43] to seal daniel in amen because notice
[33:46] they were trying
[33:48] to make a purpose sure
[33:51] the devil has a purpose that he has for
[33:55] you too
[33:56] but oh praise the living god because we
[34:00] had a prophet that tells us that
[34:03] revelations 13 16 will come yes right
[34:08] there is a squeeze that is coming
[34:11] but when that squeeze hits
[34:15] it'll only manifest that which you
[34:18] are that's right brother that's right
[34:21] amen we're there going to a mark of the
[34:23] beast you have the seal of god already
[34:26] in there
[34:27] [Applause]
[34:29] to the third paul that are yours that's
[34:31] right right there with brother keith
[34:33] randolph last night
[34:36] and he said brother cam
[34:39] he said
[34:41] oh i just lost my train of thought
[34:43] he said brother cam
[34:45] there are people
[34:48] oh where's that thought at help me lord
[34:50] third poll
[34:51] yep five manchester there are people
[34:53] that believe that the third poll is only
[34:54] for brother branham no way no
[34:56] he said they believed that third poll is
[34:58] only for brother raymond i said what did
[34:59] they do with the quote he said he said
[35:01] that that there will be five
[35:02] identification the third fourth to help
[35:04] the church out in that time
[35:06] he said brother cam i don't know
[35:08] and i said here's the thing that gets me
[35:10] brother
[35:11] i said what is the third poll
[35:14] what is it right
[35:17] he's like well brother and i said i just
[35:19] jumped in
[35:20] it does not do my turn
[35:22] and i said it was the opening of the
[35:26] word
[35:27] yes the only thing that the third pole
[35:30] is is the opening of the heart
[35:33] which actually releases all of it right
[35:37] yes
[35:40] well wait a minute are you the wire
[35:43] he said you are part of that word that's
[35:45] right right brother that's right so the
[35:47] opening of the word that third poem must
[35:50] have an identification with you right
[35:52] yes because you are the word to be
[35:55] opened in this right it is went from the
[35:58] prophet to the prophecy amen yes it had
[36:01] to go from moses to joshua jehovah's
[36:04] savior take the people in to the land of
[36:07] what unconditionally
[36:09] overcoming all things glory
[36:13] see they've got a fate for you
[36:16] you're not in the plan
[36:19] they've already started depopulating
[36:22] right but they don't realize they're
[36:23] only getting
[36:25] in god's picture
[36:26] right brother because the bible says
[36:28] you'll walk on the ashes of the wicked
[36:30] that's right brother right
[36:32] yes yeah right
[36:35] oh but you'll not see it
[36:37] amen
[36:38] you will be in that great marriage
[36:40] suffer the land for three and a half
[36:42] years
[36:46] it doesn't matter what they have put you
[36:47] in that's why don't pay all that
[36:49] attention to the news that's right well
[36:50] there's gonna be a food shortage your
[36:52] father owns a cattle a thousand gallons
[36:54] that's right amen
[36:55] i think you bring a cow pie for you
[36:58] hallelujah
[36:59] he'll bring ravens ephesians he's that
[37:02] type of god amen
[37:04] he will take care of the election
[37:08] she was getting ready to die and all she
[37:12] did was watch seen a gentile prophet
[37:14] come that's right
[37:16] he said take care of me first
[37:19] that's right and god will take care of
[37:21] you that's right so she did that
[37:26] she made him watch out of the meat on
[37:28] the oil she made him a of a biscuit if i
[37:30] said it like that
[37:31] and then he said he said what thus saith
[37:34] the lord the meal will not run dry the
[37:37] oil will not dry amen until the falling
[37:42] out
[37:44] [Applause]
[37:46] he said he would take care of you until
[37:50] the latter rain
[37:52] it's real
[37:53] you want me to swear
[37:57] [Music]
[37:57] [Applause]
[38:04] oh i'm so dry
[38:06] maybe you're not taking care of that
[38:08] word of the prophet
[38:10] right brother right
[38:11] glory see it wasn't the man
[38:14] it was the message
[38:16] yeah that's right yeah right
[38:19] oh my
[38:21] all right let's get to where we're going
[38:25] so what made
[38:28] that seal
[38:30] so notice there's really only one seal
[38:31] that has any power
[38:33] god showed that he would destroy all it
[38:35] doesn't matter if they are the king
[38:36] world or the world's king powers
[38:38] he would destroy it
[38:40] their seals were nothing from them
[38:44] what made that seal we shown
[38:48] we showed you what the seal was
[38:50] but now we're going to show you what a
[38:52] signal was
[38:54] the segment
[38:55] was actually they would have an
[38:57] artificer of brass gold whatever it was
[39:00] and they'd have them generally uh
[39:02] speaking they'd have to make a ring
[39:04] and in that ring there'd be all sorts of
[39:06] little dents in there
[39:08] i preached this at home and they
[39:10] for the youth group little youth group
[39:11] they they made little seals for their
[39:13] cygnus from there
[39:16] it was pretty cool
[39:19] hallelujah
[39:21] but what when that man become a king
[39:25] they'd have a seal made up for
[39:27] so that whatever his will or a sickness
[39:29] made form so that whatever his will was
[39:32] they would bring a writing to him and
[39:34] read it over yeah that's what i want and
[39:35] he'd seal it
[39:37] yes with a signet
[39:40] why there's authority
[39:43] of royalty
[39:45] behind that seal
[39:48] going somewhere oh amen that's right
[39:50] anyway
[39:52] so there
[39:53] they have king ahabs
[39:56] his signet
[39:58] then we have king jotham's
[40:00] there is his signet
[40:03] there is his seal
[40:07] for the camp where are you going with
[40:08] all this this is powerful
[40:09] we gotta get got to have you hold on i'm
[40:11] showing you pictures so you get the mind
[40:12] of this yes okay yeah cause i want you
[40:15] to see it
[40:16] who was the one that had this the signet
[40:18] first that made seals gone
[40:22] yeah
[40:22] it's god's word
[40:25] well god's he's fully done with
[40:27] everything the book that was sealed and
[40:29] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[40:31] we better just
[40:32] look through the scriptures a little bit
[40:33] and see how these things go right
[40:36] all right so this signal ring it says
[40:39] belonging to josh jotham and with the
[40:42] picture of a typical asuazi sheep
[40:46] it's pretty neat they get whatever that
[40:47] symbol was of what they wanted their
[40:49] kingdom to stand for
[40:50] right there hey man that's something
[40:54] so the seal will be a representation
[40:58] of what the king stands for
[41:04] glory
[41:07] watch us
[41:09] you love the bible are you amen amen
[41:13] that guy 220 and again the word of the
[41:15] lord came into haggai in the 4th and
[41:17] 20th day of the month saying speak to
[41:19] zerubbabel the disperser of confusion
[41:22] governor of judah saying i will shake
[41:24] the heavens and the earth and i will
[41:25] overthrow the throne of the kingdoms and
[41:28] i will destroy the strength of the
[41:29] kingdoms of the heathen i will overthrow
[41:32] the chariots and those that ride in them
[41:35] and the horses and the riders shall come
[41:38] down every one by the sword of his
[41:42] brother
[41:43] talk about destruction
[41:45] in that day
[41:48] saith the lord of hosts
[41:50] will i take thee o zerubble
[41:53] my servant the son of shalthya
[41:56] saith the lord
[41:57] and will make thee
[41:59] as a signet
[42:04] amen
[42:08] i'm gonna make you that
[42:11] for i
[42:12] have chosen
[42:14] thee
[42:17] saith the lord of hosts
[42:20] we're getting ready to turn a little
[42:21] spiritual direction here
[42:26] so there he was he wasn't the king this
[42:28] rule
[42:32] but he was what
[42:34] he was a disperser
[42:36] of confusion
[42:38] yes yes god said i'm overthrown and you
[42:41] are my sickness
[42:46] why
[42:47] because he was a chosen vessel to do it
[42:51] amen
[42:56] look at the commentators say and i'll
[42:58] make thee as a signal i will exalt thee
[43:00] to high dignity
[43:01] power and trust

[48:05] pharaoh took off his ring from his hand
[48:09] and put it upon joseph's hand
[48:14] watch us
[48:15] because we would want identify a signet
[48:18] with a king but watch as this king
[48:23] takes his sediment off
[48:25] and puts it on the hand of joseph amen
[48:29] who is at his right hand
[48:31] which was a type of the father granting
[48:36] the positional placement
[48:40] to jesus christ
[48:42] yes
[48:46] a random investors of lyndon put a gold
[48:48] chain about his net and he made him the
[48:50] ride in the second chair which he had
[48:51] and they cried before him by the knee
[48:53] and he made him rule over all the land
[48:55] of egypt
[48:56] wow
[48:58] it's all about jesus now isn't it amen
[49:03] glory
[49:04] yes
[49:05] he is the king
[49:08] that father had a son a manifestation of
[49:10] a son of man
[49:12] and what
[49:13] after he come forth he said when they
[49:15] saw him they worshipped him some doubt
[49:16] it and jesus came and spoke and i'm
[49:18] saying all power is given unto me in
[49:19] heaven and earth
[49:22] all power
[49:24] was given in unto him
[49:27] all the power yes
[49:28] watch this we'll just say it right here
[49:31] in matthew 17 you have the
[49:32] transfiguration
[49:34] you see it actually happened before
[49:38] the crucifixion
[49:40] that things settled in with christ
[49:42] and jesus christ had lived such a
[49:45] perfect sinless lot
[49:47] not just before the dove came on him
[49:51] but in his ministry so that hearing my
[49:54] transfiguration
[49:57] he could get caught up
[49:59] and watch manifest the coming of the
[50:01] lord but also a bright cloud
[50:03] overshadowed them and beheld a voice of
[50:07] the cloud which said this is my beloved
[50:09] son in whom i am well pleased hear ye
[50:13] him amen
[50:17] brother brandon preach that message like
[50:18] 20 times
[50:20] anymore
[50:23] and you know he's really only talking
[50:24] about himself probably
[50:27] oh wait we know better than that
[50:29] that's right
[50:30] i wonder brother cam where are you going
[50:32] with this
[50:34] watch us
[50:35] so god will actually what
[50:38] we say like this so royalty in actuality
[50:44] can actually entrust who they are
[50:48] with someone else
[50:50] amen amen watch this
[50:53] here it is
[50:55] they found another seal
[50:58] it says edina yahoo
[51:01] son of king david
[51:03] king david had so much
[51:05] trust
[51:07] dignity
[51:09] and power
[51:10] as far as looking at his son then yahoo
[51:15] that he would give him a signet
[51:19] so that he could seal
[51:21] as the king did
[51:23] hey man amen
[51:26] hallelujah hallelujah they just found
[51:29] this one
[51:31] this seal translates to belonging
[51:34] to nathan malek
[51:36] servant of the king josiah
[51:41] the king
[51:43] couldn't do all the business himself
[51:45] that's right
[51:47] so the king would find entrusted
[51:51] people
[51:52] in his kingdom
[51:54] that he could what
[51:56] make to have a signet
[52:00] where they could have the authority of
[52:03] the caring and use it amen
[52:07] yes
[52:08] praise god
[52:16] we see this
[52:18] and look at this authority that is given
[52:21] right good what happens when authority
[52:24] is given to evil
[52:26] to the evil
[52:29] and the king took off his ring from his
[52:31] hand
[52:32] and gave it unto
[52:34] haman the son of amadetha the again the
[52:37] jews enemy
[52:39] and the king said unto haman the silver
[52:42] is given to thee the people also to do
[52:45] with them as it seemeth good to thee
[52:49] ma
[52:52] then the kings were the king's scribes
[52:54] called on the 13th day of the first
[52:56] month and there's written according to
[52:58] all that haman had commanded under the
[52:59] king's lieutenants and to the governors
[53:01] that were over every
[53:02] prophets and to the rules of every
[53:04] people of every province according to
[53:05] writing thereof and to every people
[53:07] after their language in the name of king
[53:09] of zurich was it written and sealed with
[53:12] the
[53:13] ring
[53:17] you mean
[53:18] in the natural
[53:20] a man could look so good to the king
[53:25] that they could actually receive
[53:29] the authority of the king and still be a
[53:32] serpent
[53:33] right
[53:38] hallelujah we've been watching it
[53:41] you think all these people that run the
[53:43] world are message believers
[53:47] they have been given an authority
[53:50] right now you say the king controls it
[53:52] or the devil he said these are his
[53:54] kingdoms
[53:55] sure but you realize that the devil
[53:57] can't do anything
[53:59] without approaching god that's exactly
[54:00] right brother yes he standeth day and
[54:03] night
[54:04] before god accusing the brethren
[54:09] hallelujah
[54:12] because what his ultimate goal is what
[54:14] he's after you
[54:16] right right
[54:19] notice
[54:22] so what did he do it's mine
[54:27] he got the authority of the king
[54:31] and it was good he could do anything
[54:33] just like it was the king's will
[54:35] so now he wants to kill
[54:38] god's people
[54:41] right we know how that worked out
[54:45] but notice
[54:47] remember power
[54:50] without character
[54:52] is satanic
[54:55] right
[54:56] but character with power
[54:59] is fixed to rule
[55:02] you say
[55:03] why i need that power in my life
[55:06] because god if you're his son he's got
[55:09] to see the character amen
[55:12] hallelujah hey if other people are
[55:15] getting anointed if other people though
[55:17] they're the ones that got to be means
[55:19] who cares right
[55:21] let them deal with it
[55:23] because you'll find that if it's if it's
[55:24] what
[55:26] if it's somebody with the wrong
[55:28] character given power they'll do the
[55:29] wrong thing that's right brother that's
[55:31] right
[55:33] hallelujah that's why i said well oh
[55:34] brother brother jesse why isn't my
[55:37] church bigger why isn't your church
[55:38] bigger we should be so big
[55:41] brother braham said he said he said
[55:43] don't expect this to get bigger and
[55:44] bigger wow he said expect it to get
[55:46] smaller and smaller all the time
[55:49] another quote he said while coming to
[55:50] the headstone it will come down to a
[55:52] very pinpoint
[55:55] that's right right hallelujah i don't
[55:57] care what's big i just want to stay with
[56:01] him amen
[56:05] because this message was sown for a
[56:08] purpose
[56:09] and that is to what
[56:12] jesus said in john saint john 14 12 he
[56:16] said the works that i do shall ye do and
[56:19] greater work shall ye do because i go to
[56:22] the father amen amen amen
[56:27] he wants you to do the same works
[56:29] and greater
[56:31] but do you think he's going to give it
[56:32] to you before you're ready for it no sir
[56:34] uh-uh
[56:35] but i'll tell you what he will i'll
[56:36] happen
[56:38] he'll allow the evil to come
[56:40] with the power of a saint that's right
[56:43] right brother
[56:47] watch us
[56:50] well jeremiah had a problem he kept
[56:51] warning them tell them to go to babylon
[56:52] tell them do this don't do that and they
[56:54] would never listen to him
[56:56] as i live saith the lord though coniah
[56:58] the son of jehoiakim king of judah were
[57:01] the signet upon my right hand
[57:03] yet would i pluck thee dance
[57:06] i gave you that power
[57:09] and i'll give thee into the hand of them
[57:11] that seek thy life and at the hand of
[57:13] them whose face thou fierce even in the
[57:15] hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon
[57:17] and then the hand of the chalians
[57:20] he could what grant people authority
[57:26] but it wouldn't be until they're good
[57:28] right amen i don't know about you but
[57:31] this is the day of false anointed ones
[57:34] right what brother branham said and
[57:35] anointed once at the end time he said
[57:36] and it couldn't happen
[57:38] until after the opening of the scene
[57:45] so the seals would release that
[57:48] that's why i'm saying it with the sea of
[57:49] the elected if it was possible
[57:51] that's right you've got to give it the
[57:53] word test
[57:55] hey man
[57:57] oh you know you're talking about bad
[57:59] people
[58:01] yeah

[58:15] was usually a ring a man that couldn't
[58:18] sign his name just had a ring he sealed
[58:19] it
[58:20] his ever what he wrote why he just
[58:23] instead of signed his name he put the
[58:25] seal on it
[58:26] it was a penitentiary
[58:29] offense to ever copy that seal yes
[58:34] look at this
[58:35] now today
[58:37] god has a seal
[58:40] and it's a penalty
[58:42] of death
[58:44] to copy that seal
[58:47] and listen

[58:51] methodists
[58:53] presbyterians right and pentecostals and

[59:15] the message is the absolute

[1:00:04] young brother and he just blasted that
[1:00:06] the message of the absolute

[1:01:17] said jesus christ he said he is a
[1:01:19] messenger that's right but not what

[1:06:13] no copies here
[1:06:15] the gospel god come
[1:06:18] all right all right
[1:06:21] watch again
[1:06:23] we won't read this
[1:06:25] they found
[1:06:26] jezebel's team oh my goodness
[1:06:32] on that woman
[1:06:33] right now suffers jezebel to preach
[1:06:37] so what when it came down to the
[1:06:39] vineyard of naboth
[1:06:41] jezebel's wife said in him does thou now
[1:06:44] govern the kingdom of israel arise eat
[1:06:45] bread and let that in the heart be merry
[1:06:47] i will give you the vineyard of naboth
[1:06:49] the jezreel so she wrote letters in
[1:06:51] ahab's name
[1:06:54] she was copying
[1:06:56] his
[1:06:58] what his word as if it was hers
[1:07:02] and sealed them with his seal
[1:07:06] i might have come to this because they
[1:07:07] found her seal too
[1:07:11] and sent the letters unto the elders and
[1:07:14] to the nobles that were in his city
[1:07:16] dwelling with nevada and she killed him
[1:07:18] didn't you that's right
[1:07:20] she would use now notice this
[1:07:23] when the serpent seed get a hold of the
[1:07:26] authority of the sickness
[1:07:28] they try scripturally we seem to destroy
[1:07:32] the people of god that's right
[1:07:35] what do you think they're going to do if
[1:07:36] your pastor stands for the truth
[1:07:38] they're going to try to destroy him
[1:07:40] shame on them they need to repent that's
[1:07:41] right why don't they search out the
[1:07:43] bible instead of calling the brother on
[1:07:45] the phone
[1:07:46] hallelujah right that's what i do
[1:07:49] i don't believe everything everybody
[1:07:50] believes i say you search it out
[1:07:53] right study this out
[1:08:04] because you see
[1:08:06] authority in the wrong position
[1:08:09] you're gonna be destroyed
[1:08:10] right when she did this
[1:08:12] elijah comes out and says the dogs are
[1:08:15] gonna lick your blood up
[1:08:17] notice
[1:08:18] with hormone
[1:08:20] him getting authority brought what he
[1:08:23] was trying to destroy the elect but it
[1:08:25] actually came to destroy him yeah
[1:08:28] that's right that's right jezebel to
[1:08:30] destroy the elect
[1:08:32] but the sickness she used would be what
[1:08:36] would come back to her from the message
[1:08:38] of a prophet and what caught her demise
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:42] all right
[1:08:44] that's why we got satan's even the
[1:08:45] message
[1:08:46] that's why we got anointed once at the
[1:08:47] end time
[1:08:49] because god is giving everyone
[1:08:51] an equal shot to see what is true
[1:08:54] authority
[1:08:56] it's coming down to this you better get
[1:08:58] ready for power
[1:08:59] you better get ready for a closer walk
[1:09:01] with god because there is meal and oil
[1:09:05] for you amen
[1:09:09] hallelujah
[1:09:12] come on brother sister
[1:09:14] i know we get tired they get tired in my
[1:09:16] church too
[1:09:17] look up the message you ever looked up
[1:09:19] the message brother answered you get
[1:09:21] tired he said it's a devil getting on
[1:09:22] you

[1:09:25] well i put you on a go-kart get you
[1:09:27] riding down the road
[1:09:29] you ain't gonna fall asleep on your go
[1:09:30] car
[1:09:32] right i'll put you in a buffet line
[1:09:35] you'll sit there for two hours
[1:09:38] i'm not condemning you i'm trying to
[1:09:40] show you where we're at all right
[1:09:42] we wake up and realize that the word is
[1:09:46] actually bringing you to heavenly places
[1:09:49] hearing the word it makes you say amen
[1:09:54] god heals
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:10] i'm an extrovert
[1:10:11] or introvert excuse me i'm an introvert
[1:10:13] i'm really
[1:10:14] quiet i don't say a lot
[1:10:17] i tried my wife nuts
[1:10:20] she's a sweetheart
[1:10:22] put up with me
[1:10:23] i'm just really quiet
[1:10:26] but when i get the anointing on me you
[1:10:28] see it i can't sit still and i can't
[1:10:30] shut up
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:35] and i thought myself a while back and
[1:10:36] like
[1:10:38] if the church could only get in a spot
[1:10:40] that they could carry the anointing just
[1:10:41] like that
[1:10:44] because whether you believe it or not
[1:10:47] there's a holy ghost not just at the
[1:10:48] pulpit right there's a holy ghost that's
[1:10:50] trying to amen inside of you
[1:10:54] you know the holy ghost can amen so much
[1:10:56] inside of you that god can fill this
[1:10:58] place with the glory of the lord
[1:11:00] amen and you'll shut the preacher up
[1:11:03] that's right
[1:11:04] yes
[1:11:08] i had a man come to my church a few
[1:11:10] years ago
[1:11:11] he was coming to my church and i told
[1:11:13] the story here already but i'll tell the
[1:11:14] gangsters coming my mind
[1:11:15] and he come to my church and anyways his
[1:11:17] first time visiting as far as i know
[1:11:19] and uh
[1:11:21] anyway he's sitting in the pew
[1:11:23] and i can't remember if i was preaching
[1:11:24] what was going on but i wasn't i wasn't
[1:11:26] backed by him i was up in the pulpit
[1:11:28] doing something but anyway
[1:11:31] my wife was across the road from she's
[1:11:32] seen all this
[1:11:33] and that brother
[1:11:35] he was crying and weeping and raising
[1:11:37] his hands and just enjoying whatever was
[1:11:40] going on there i can't remember that's
[1:11:41] how great my memory is
[1:11:43] but anyway he came up and testified me
[1:11:45] after church
[1:11:47] he said he said i was weeping he said so
[1:11:49] much he said and i looked through my
[1:11:50] glasses
[1:11:52] and said couldn't see through i'm like
[1:11:54] man i am crying so hard
[1:11:57] that my glasses have fogged up
[1:12:02] because of the presence of god so moving
[1:12:04] on
[1:12:05] yes he said then he pulled his glasses
[1:12:07] off to wipe him
[1:12:08] and he looked at their glass his glasses
[1:12:10] and there was nothing on him
[1:12:14] and he looked back up
[1:12:16] and he seen the cloud in the church
[1:12:19] that's right amen amen oh hallelujah but
[1:12:23] i'll tell you if you get in the same
[1:12:25] condition you'll see it today
[1:12:29] you'll see it when the pastor preaches
[1:12:33] the ephesians
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:12:41] hallelujah all right i got to hurry up
[1:12:45] all right so i showed you what that
[1:12:46] happens with the evil
[1:13:00] on that day did the king aziris give the
[1:13:03] house of haman
[1:13:04] the jews enemy unto esther the queen
[1:13:07] and mordecai came before the king
[1:13:10] for esther had told what he was unto her
[1:13:14] watch this
[1:13:16] now
[1:13:17] look at the transfer that's going on
[1:13:20] haman is sent to the gallows because he
[1:13:23] misused the authority
[1:13:26] yes
[1:13:27] talk about the binding of the tares
[1:13:30] yes amen it's gonna be so close it would
[1:13:32] deceive the elected
[1:13:35] but watch the king took off his ring
[1:13:38] when she had taken from her mom and give
[1:13:40] it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai
[1:13:44] over the house
[1:13:47] of haman
[1:13:51] so the picture was what
[1:13:53] to bring forth the authority in the
[1:13:55] right spot
[1:13:58] amen
[1:14:00] remember ahmad had the king's sign that
[1:14:03] all the jews would die
[1:14:05] that's right but before that
[1:14:07] he misused the authority and it killed
[1:14:09] him watch out these people messing with
[1:14:10] israel right now
[1:14:11] there's 144 000 thousand two prophets
[1:14:13] getting ready to rise out
[1:14:15] hallelujah
[1:14:17] now watch
[1:14:20] eighth verse right he also he's saying
[1:14:22] the mordecai chance you're saying the
[1:14:24] mordecai uh
[1:14:26] right also for the jews doesn't like
[1:14:28] with you in the king's name and seal the
[1:14:29] king's ring for the writing which is
[1:14:31] written in the king's name and sealed
[1:14:33] with his kingdom made no man reverse
[1:14:35] hallelujah and he wrote king of zero's
[1:14:37] name and sealed it with the king's ring
[1:14:40] sent letters posts on on horseback and
[1:14:43] riders and mules campbells and young
[1:14:44] dromedaries and wearing the king granted
[1:14:46] the jews which are in every city to
[1:14:47] gather themselves together and stand for
[1:14:50] their life
[1:14:52] yes oh just stand up you know and just
[1:14:55] fight
[1:14:58] to destroy
[1:14:59] to slay to cause to perish all the power
[1:15:02] of the people and province that would
[1:15:04] assault them both literally and women to
[1:15:06] take the spoil of them for pray and they
[1:15:08] were they were given the king's weapons
[1:15:09] too
[1:15:12] see when the righteous receive the
[1:15:14] authority
[1:15:16] it goes to the abundance of god's people
[1:15:19] it moves them where they might be put in
[1:15:21] a squeeze
[1:15:22] god provides a way for them to get out
[1:15:24] amen amen
[1:15:26] glory
[1:15:27] but what was it
[1:15:30] it was when the false got what they lost
[1:15:32] their authority because there's a
[1:15:34] transition that's right it's all heading
[1:15:36] out

[1:19:03] it
[1:19:04] that god can see virtue knowledge
[1:19:06] tempers patients run kind of scholars in
[1:19:07] him yes then god seals him or places him
[1:19:12] and there that's when you see the son's
[1:19:16] daughters hallelujah
[1:19:19] remember the same and statutory it he
[1:19:21] said you'd be living moving idols
[1:19:23] that's right right you know they tried
[1:19:25] to worship paul
[1:19:27] was it paul silas uh mercurus and
[1:19:29] jupiter
[1:19:30] right
[1:19:31] they tried to call you god
[1:19:33] but the only thing you can do is praise
[1:19:35] god yeah so we're just men like you
[1:19:38] let me point you out jesus christ
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:44] amen amen so who is god trying to get to
[1:19:48] where sinners you
[1:19:49] yes
[1:19:52] what clothes right here remember judah
[1:19:53] and tamar yes
[1:19:58] tama
[1:20:01] she had to what
[1:20:03] play the harlot
[1:20:05] to get the promised seed that god had
[1:20:07] for
[1:20:08] which was in the sea lion the promised
[1:20:10] seed line
[1:20:13] but notice this
[1:20:17] she wanted to what
[1:20:20] have the seed of judah
[1:20:23] just like we want
[1:20:25] the seed of the lion of the tribe of
[1:20:27] judah right to manifest from us amen
[1:20:31] impregnated by the word right right
[1:20:36] so notice she required
[1:20:40] a token
[1:20:41] of judah
[1:20:44] for the proof of the prayer nature
[1:20:47] amen and he said i was sending a kid
[1:20:49] from the flock she said will thou give
[1:20:51] me a flesh till thou send
[1:20:54] and he said what place shall give thee
[1:20:56] and she said thy sickness
[1:21:00] my braces my staff is in the head and he
[1:21:03] gave it her and it came under her and
[1:21:05] she conceived by him
[1:21:08] she wanted
[1:21:10] the
[1:21:12] yes
[1:21:14] she wanted judah's authority
[1:21:17] yes
[1:21:19] so not only
[1:21:21] was judah willing to give it
[1:21:26] but she was calling for the pledge of
[1:21:28] the segment
[1:21:30] amen that's right
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:36] just remember it concealed that way
[1:21:39] it was the proof of that he can trust
[1:21:41] you with his word
[1:21:43] that's right power behind it
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:46] there's deliverance behind it
[1:21:49] there was strength behind it
[1:21:51] listen
[1:21:52] hallelujah
[1:21:58] a little bit
[1:21:59] we started late
[1:22:02] we went as fast as we could
[1:22:04] all right
[1:22:05] that's why jesus gave you all these
[1:22:09] look at promises what was the simpsons
[1:22:10] and said jesus said on the peace be on
[1:22:12] you and my father sent me so i sent you
[1:22:14] when he had said this he breathed on
[1:22:15] them saying let him receive you the holy
[1:22:16] ghost whosoever sins you remember made
[1:22:18] it unto them and whosoever sends you
[1:22:20] retain their return right good good i
[1:22:22] told you i was gonna
[1:22:30] see why they try to put it all way back
[1:22:32] there
[1:22:34] but jesus says for those that believe
[1:22:37] that's right
[1:22:39] oh god
[1:22:43] he has desires
[1:22:47] he has desired
[1:22:49] this church to come and to hear ye in
[1:22:52] character
[1:22:55] 50 60 years
[1:22:58] moving
[1:22:59] trying to get the church in condition
[1:23:04] because you see you might see yourself
[1:23:07] as little and significant
[1:23:08] but that's not the way he sees you
[1:23:10] that's right
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] you realize
[1:23:14] john there's no no man born greater
[1:23:16] women than john the baptist
[1:23:19] that's right but then
[1:23:21] then jesus said but but all these that
[1:23:23] receive the holy ghost he's not even
[1:23:25] under them
[1:23:27] do you know what that is supposed to
[1:23:29] receive the holy ghost that's right
[1:23:32] that's right
[1:23:33] amen hallelujah hey times are dark but
[1:23:36] that don't mean you're gone that's right
[1:23:38] times might be tiring
[1:23:41] what the devils think they love you can
[1:23:43] change laws and times to wear out the
