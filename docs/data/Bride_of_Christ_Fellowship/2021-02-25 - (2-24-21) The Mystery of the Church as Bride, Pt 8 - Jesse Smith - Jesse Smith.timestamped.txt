[42:18] christ's name
[42:19] and the saint said amen god bless you as
[42:21] your being seated praise god
[42:29] all right so we'll look at uh part eight
[42:31] tonight we're looking at uh the mystery
[42:33] of the church
[42:34] as the bride uh last week we looked at
[42:38] uh samson's wife was that a blessing
[42:40] hope everybody thought that was a
[42:41] blessing last week uh
[42:43] and his wife and i still got to follow
[42:45] up i forgot to follow up with uh
[42:47] it was elizabeth's question i still got
[42:49] to look into that you know did samson
[42:50] break any law
[42:52] uh by taking the honey out of the
[42:54] carcass of the line i still need to look
[42:56] that up i got the other ones done but i
[42:57] forgot that one
[42:58] i didn't follow up on that one yet so
[43:01] lord have mercy on me and hopefully we
[43:02] can
[43:03] follow up on that for sunday so let's
[43:05] look here
[43:06] i'll set my timer here let's try to
[43:07] preach a half hour my
[43:09] let's see if we can do that okay so
[43:12] we looked at all these uh we've looked
[43:14] so far at six
[43:15] uh women from the old testament and
[43:18] their lives have typed
[43:20] uh uh the the bride of jesus christ and
[43:23] what i thought was interesting too was
[43:25] many of them you know had jewish and
[43:28] gentile kind of characteristics
[43:30] like lord willing if we'll look at ruth
[43:32] tonight uh the last one is the
[43:35] shulamite from the song of solomon and
[43:38] she's a really good type i was reading
[43:39] through that one today if we can get to
[43:40] that but
[43:41] she's a really good one because we know
[43:43] she's jewish she's shula shulamite
[43:46] i think she's a singer from a town of
[43:48] issachar but yet she said my
[43:50] uh my hair is black like the tents of
[43:52] keter
[43:54] okay so uh and the tents of keter were
[43:57] ishmaelites
[43:58] gentiles and so i just think it's so
[44:00] interesting like esther right
[44:01] she's a jew but yeah for most of her
[44:04] life she was known
[44:05] like a gentile no one knew her
[44:07] characteristics and that's a beautiful
[44:08] type
[44:09] because the the bride is composed of
[44:11] both jew and gentile
[44:13] amen paul was a bride member yet he was
[44:15] jewish right
[44:16] peter and different ones and so we see
[44:18] just a beautiful type it's just
[44:20] it's glorious how god types him in there
[44:23] like we saw with rahab she was gentile
[44:25] but married into the jewish faith right
[44:27] in the very lineage of jesus christ so
[44:29] there's always these things i love what
[44:31] the bible said
[44:32] the bible said jesus tore down the great
[44:34] wall dividing jew and gentile
[44:36] and made of two one new man praise god
[44:38] amen
[44:39] i think that's just glorious how the
[44:41] scripture always gives us these
[44:43] women that are both jewish and have
[44:45] gentile connections praise god
[44:47] let's look at ruth tonight by god's
[44:49] grace she's a gentile
[44:50] moabitus and she types the churches
[44:54] or the gentile churches marriage to
[44:56] jesus
[44:57] so we know ruth was childless she was in
[45:00] a state as a widow
[45:02] and that represents the church's
[45:04] fruitless life
[45:05] before coming to christ and her hopeless
[45:09] marriage to the dead letter of the law
[45:12] amen
[45:13] right she was never going to get any
[45:14] fruit out of the dead letter right
[45:16] in other words you're never going to get
[45:17] real holy ghost fruit through the dead
[45:19] letter right
[45:20] the curse of the law the bible says the
[45:22] law was holy
[45:24] but the law contained curses under it
[45:26] right
[45:27] the bible said to be guilty of one was
[45:29] to be guilty of all of them
[45:31] amen so there was a great curse
[45:35] that uh ruth was under
[45:38] now and it's typed there in romans 7 4
[45:41] so maybe i have some bible readers here
[45:43] tonight if we could
[45:44] amen all right first one haven roman 7
[45:46] 4. thanks for volunteering can you read
[45:48] romans 7 4 her marriage to boaz is going
[45:51] to symbolize the bride church's marriage
[45:54] to
[45:54] christ all right so romans 7 4 haven
[45:57] when you're ready
[46:02] you saying amen zion is that amen
[46:24] very good keep that up there if you
[46:26] would all keisha thank you
[46:28] let's get off all right great job haven
[46:30] kind of feel like i'm in the sunday
[46:32] night mode
[46:32] he said where for my brother now look
[46:34] you're also become dead to the law so
[46:37] i'm sorry ruth had to be dead to her
[46:39] husband right who passed away
[46:41] by the body of christ that she would be
[46:44] married to another
[46:46] to him who's raised from the dead that
[46:49] we should bring forth fruit
[46:50] unto god ruth was never going to bring
[46:53] forth fruit because
[46:54] her husband was dead so she had to have
[46:57] another
[46:58] marriage in order to bring forth life
[47:01] someone who was
[47:01] alive praise god amen not dead alive
[47:05] and so see boaz of course types christ
[47:08] okay so ruth's husband dying represents
[47:11] her being loose
[47:12] from the curse of the law praise god now
[47:16] brother braham breaks it down to ruth
[47:18] deciding ruth laboring and ruth resting
[47:21] praise god
[47:22] that's the three works of grace she had
[47:24] to decide that's justification
[47:25] she had to labor that sanctification
[47:28] then she had to just
[47:29] she had to rest that's the baptism of
[47:31] the holy ghost praise god
[47:32] so we see the beautiful type here now
[47:35] ruth
[47:35] here uh before marrying boaz she chose
[47:38] to travel back to israel with her
[47:40] elderly mother-in-law naomi
[47:42] and that types the gentile christians
[47:44] leaving their past
[47:45] lives and following the old past so
[47:48] naomi represents
[47:50] the old paths she's like the
[47:52] schoolmaster to bring us
[47:54] unto christ right because she had a
[47:56] choice do i go back to my worldliness
[47:58] or do i follow my schoolmaster praise
[48:01] god
[48:02] right and we know what she did she chose
[48:05] to
[48:06] follow naomi she said you'll be your god
[48:08] will be my god amen
[48:10] where you go that's where i'll go amen
[48:12] where you die
[48:13] that's where i'll die amen she saw
[48:15] something holy in that law
[48:17] praise god amen he saw something holy in
[48:20] that law she knew it was right
[48:22] amen so it represents the old strict
[48:26] uh teaching old teacher right the
[48:29] strictness
[48:30] of judaism because it was a school
[48:32] master and naomi
[48:34] led ruth back to israel and then
[48:37] ultimately to boaz because remember she
[48:39] didn't know where to go
[48:41] but it was uh it was naomi's idea amen
[48:44] hallelujah the old testament will always
[48:46] point you to christ amen
[48:48] hallelujah oh that's beautiful it was
[48:51] ultimately this word this old testament
[48:53] law that's pointing forward that's why i
[48:55] love reading this morning i started the
[48:56] book of mark this morning
[48:57] and the bible starts off and says to
[49:00] fulfill the scripture
[49:01] as it is written the bible said the
[49:03] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[49:05] prepare the way of the lord make his
[49:07] path straight praise god
[49:09] the voice of one crying in the
[49:11] wilderness where are you gonna find that
[49:12] you're gonna find that in malachi you're
[49:14] gonna find that in isaiah
[49:16] right this old law pointing us to christ
[49:19] right pointing us to the messenger amen
[49:21] pointing us to the forerunner and then
[49:23] pointing us to the messiah praise god
[49:26] like naomi would point her to boaz
[49:29] amen now the timing is perfect it's just
[49:33] beautiful
[49:34] so lydia can you read uh ruth 1 22. look
[49:37] at the timing
[49:38] of her justification she she decides to
[49:41] follow the law
[49:42] she decides to follow the school master
[49:44] the teacher right
[49:45] the trainer uh she decides to follow the
[49:48] holy teaching
[49:50] and when look when she arrives in the
[49:52] promised land amen
[49:54] so lily can you read that for us
[50:06] hey man leave that up there so barley
[50:08] harvest was
[50:09] marcher april right that was the first
[50:12] harvest
[50:13] march in april was barley right and then
[50:16] may
[50:16] on to august was wheat harvest
[50:20] so they always had two harvests right
[50:22] why that's why they needed a former rain
[50:24] and a ladder rain praise god they had
[50:27] two harvests
[50:28] and so here we see that they come back
[50:31] and the very timing where the
[50:32] the law is leading the gentile bride the
[50:35] very timing the very place and timing of
[50:38] their return
[50:39] is the time of the passover praise god
[50:42] amen that's what the word of god will do
[50:45] the word of god where will take you
[50:46] it'll take you to the cross of jesus
[50:48] amen
[50:49] hallelujah if you fought follow this law
[50:52] long enough if you believe in it if you
[50:53] believe the word of god
[50:54] memorize it it'll point you to christ
[50:56] it'll take you to isaiah 53 praise god
[50:59] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[51:01] was bruised for our iniquities
[51:03] but with his stripes we were healed amen
[51:06] glory so they arrive at uh
[51:09] uh passover time praise god so we see
[51:12] it's a beautiful prophetic type here
[51:15] how in this barley season it included
[51:18] passover which was the death of the lamb
[51:20] the unleavened bread which represents
[51:22] jesus's unleavened life
[51:24] and then the first fruits which
[51:25] represents the resurrection amen
[51:28] so her arrival at barley harvest
[51:30] represents the gentile christians coming
[51:32] to faith in christ
[51:34] by experiencing the spiritual blessings
[51:36] of jesus's death
[51:38] burial and resurrection and let me say
[51:40] i'm still benefiting from those
[51:42] blessings right now praise god
[51:44] amen even tonight church think about
[51:46] that even tonight
[51:47] we're still keeping the feast of
[51:49] passover unleavened bread
[51:52] and the first fruits right because we're
[51:54] living in the blessings of christ
[51:56] we the bible says that we continually
[51:58] preach the cross of christ amen
[52:00] because there's power in the cross
[52:02] there's power in the blood of jesus
[52:05] now let me prove it to you so malachi
[52:07] get first corinthians five
[52:08] seven and eight and then who else wants
[52:10] to read any other newcomers we're going
[52:11] to read
[52:12] heaven again okay that's fine ephesians
[52:14] 5 18. get that
[52:15] so malachi first corinthians 5 7 and 8.
[52:18] this is such a beautiful picture church
[52:22] you know the bible said that jesus ever
[52:24] lives to make intercession
[52:25] is that right well while jesus died 2000
[52:29] years ago
[52:30] he took he had to have taken some of his
[52:32] blood to heaven
[52:33] because the blood sits there on the the
[52:35] altar in heaven
[52:37] the mercy seat in heaven he he sits on a
[52:39] throne and that throne is the seed of
[52:41] mercy right
[52:42] so it's like a perpetual power of the
[52:44] cross
[52:45] it's as if the cross doesn't lose its
[52:47] power for two thousand years
[52:49] amen and it's a continual sacrifice
[52:53] uh the blood is always there to make
[52:55] intercession
[52:56] aren't you glad there's still blood for
[52:58] your sins amen
[53:00] aren't you glad there's still uh a high
[53:02] priest to intercede for you and i
[53:04] amen hallelujah there's the blood hasn't
[53:07] been taken away the blood's still there
[53:09] praise god
[53:11] and it's not like the catholic where
[53:12] they gotta go partake of
[53:14] of bread and wine where they think jesus
[53:16] has to die again he has to die again he
[53:18] has to die again
[53:19] it's not that it's not a mass right it's
[53:21] not the mass and it's not
[53:23] but it's a continual benefit of the
[53:25] power
[53:26] and of the blood there's still he's
[53:28] still a bleeding sacrifice right is
[53:30] there still a bloody sacrifice there
[53:31] amen
[53:32] there's there's something there to
[53:33] receive us there's something there
[53:35] to speak forgiveness for our guilt amen
[53:39] now here look what he says and it's
[53:41] gonna prove it to you i'm still so like
[53:43] ruth
[53:43] ruth came there right at the time of the
[53:45] passover we're still in passover
[53:47] we're gonna celebrate it in a couple
[53:48] months but church we're supposed to
[53:50] celebrate it tonight praise god amen
[53:53] and that's the reason people fall away
[53:54] is because they stop celebrating and now
[53:56] it celebrates not the right word
[53:58] the right word is worship amen they stop
[54:01] worshiping
[54:02] and like they're at passover right they
[54:04] think they can move on
[54:05] church we can never move on from the
[54:06] blood of jesus christ
[54:08] we'll grow in maturity but we still need
[54:10] the blood every single day
[54:12] so every day is a feast day praise god
[54:14] amen
[54:16] it's proven to us i don't have to prove
[54:18] it it's proven in the bible
[54:20] purge out therefore the old leaven so
[54:22] what's that speaking of unleavened bread
[54:24] right that you may be a new love as you
[54:27] are unleavened
[54:29] for even christ our passover passover is
[54:32] sacrifice
[54:33] for us therefore let us keep the feasts
[54:36] not with old leaven neither with the
[54:38] leaven of malice and
[54:39] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[54:42] of sincerity
[54:44] and truth amen so what god wants us to
[54:46] do is
[54:47] continually have the the sacrifice of
[54:50] christ before our minds
[54:52] and that's why church we've got to
[54:53] remember to sign cry for the
[54:54] abominations right
[54:56] we got we have to have that sincerity we
[54:58] can't lose our sincerity we have to know
[55:01] all the pain that was put on jesus so
[55:03] that we could be forgiven
[55:05] we can't forget the the the suffering
[55:07] that christ went through
[55:08] or the agony that he went through the
[55:10] cross passover
[55:12] has to remain real to us god help us to
[55:14] always remember the blood of jesus amen
[55:18] and if we keep that feast and you know a
[55:21] feast
[55:22] uh feast is a very solemn time right so
[55:24] all of our days have to be
[55:26] uh we've got to have a real sincerity to
[55:28] our days
[55:29] we have to make sure that we're we're
[55:31] constantly aware of what god has done
[55:33] and here it is right there we've got to
[55:34] keep
[55:35] the leaven out of our lives amen we've
[55:38] got to keep
[55:39] sin from growing in our lives
[55:43] we've got to be able to clean it out
[55:45] before it grows into something that
[55:46] would destroy
[55:48] us right or someone we love or someone
[55:51] that we care about or a friend
[55:52] we've got to keep the leaven from
[55:54] growing so it doesn't
[55:56] spoil our lives right we see it all the
[55:59] time where people let sin
[56:01] spoil their lives and it just ruins
[56:03] their life it'll ruin
[56:05] right their finances it'll ruin their
[56:06] marriage it'll ruin their local churches
[56:09] right
[56:09] it'll ruin their friendships
[56:13] people will let you know politics ruin
[56:16] 40 years worth of friendships right
[56:17] malachi we heard about that on monday
[56:20] now that one little political uh event
[56:23] ruin everything it'll just destroy it
[56:25] because leavens got in there
[56:27] but you and i need to clean it all out
[56:29] we need to wash it out
[56:30] we just sweep it out we let the holy
[56:32] spirit clean out our lives amen
[56:34] that our lives are free from sin
[56:38] and if we do that church it will be like
[56:40] we're keeping a constant feast
[56:42] of sincerity and truth now my bible
[56:45] tells me let me just flip a couple pages
[56:47] here
[56:48] well i shouldn't say well my bible my
[56:50] reference bible i should say
[56:53] my reference bible tells me this was
[56:55] written in 59
[56:57] a.d 59 a.d
[57:00] almost 30 years after the cross amen
[57:04] paul was still still saying we have
[57:06] access to the benefits of the cross amen
[57:09] we must remember the cross we must keep
[57:12] jesus's sacrifice and
[57:14] and the the crown of thorns uh and the
[57:17] uh the spirit his side and the the
[57:19] beating that he took we must keep that
[57:21] in our memory right
[57:22] we must keep it sincere we must live in
[57:25] truth we got to tell the truth praise
[57:27] god we got to
[57:28] make sure that we remember what he's
[57:29] done for us and live with appreciation
[57:32] and live like it's a feast amen
[57:36] it's what must be done he said let us
[57:39] keep the
[57:40] feast i don't know about you but i it's
[57:41] not easter but i'm still keeping the
[57:43] feast praise god
[57:44] all right i'm praying at my house i'm
[57:46] praying at the church i'm praying in my
[57:48] car
[57:49] right you should do the same thing right
[57:51] we're keeping the feasts
[57:53] we realize that it's a special time amen
[57:56] it's a special time every time is a
[57:58] special time in the prince of the lord
[58:00] amen
[58:01] it's something to keep it's something
[58:02] that is continually going
[58:04] and here's where ruth comes she comes at
[58:06] the time
[58:07] the most sacred time of the year praise
[58:09] god
[58:12] she made the decision i'm going to just
[58:14] i'm going to decide to follow the law
[58:15] i'm going to follow the school master my
[58:17] teacher i'm going to follow the holy
[58:19] teacher right
[58:20] and where does that take her it takes
[58:22] her to a time of feasting amen
[58:26] hallelujah now the next one i think of
[58:29] haven
[58:29] ephesians 5 18 could you read that
[58:31] before son
[58:48] is
[58:50] yes i don't know why i put that one in
[58:52] there actually i'm not sure how that
[58:53] is connected there so forgive me oh oh
[58:56] just being filled with the holy ghost
[58:57] because that came at the day of
[58:58] pentecost right
[58:59] so at the day of pentecost they were
[59:00] finally filled with the holy ghost in
[59:02] the soul
[59:02] so paul says we've got to constantly
[59:04] fill now this is speaking of the mind
[59:06] right
[59:06] be fulfilled or be filled in the human
[59:08] spirit because the soul gets sealed
[59:10] it gets a portion of the holy ghost
[59:12] that's right so
[59:13] we keep all these feasts we keep our
[59:16] sincerity
[59:17] and we keep our sinless lives before the
[59:21] lord
[59:22] now the bride church like ruth came to
[59:24] christ in a timely manner
[59:26] and then we enjoy all the blessings of
[59:29] the cross
[59:30] and of the final harvest pentecost
[59:32] because we know right now we're in the
[59:33] feast keeping a feast we know
[59:35] we know we need the cross we know we
[59:37] need unleavened life amen
[59:39] we know we need the resurrection life
[59:41] and we know the wheat is coming to
[59:43] maturity
[59:44] and jesus is going to harvest all the
[59:46] wheat that belongs to him
[59:47] because he's lord of the harvest amen
[59:50] hallelujah
[59:51] thank god it's a continual feast and
[59:53] church this should remind
[59:54] us look at this this should remind us of
[59:57] romans 12 how we're
[59:59] to continually be a living sacrifice
[1:00:03] so we have two continual sacrifices
[1:00:05] going on
[1:00:06] christ's sacrifice is continually
[1:00:08] working for us
[1:00:09] but then we've got to continually lay
[1:00:11] ourselves on the altar of sacrifice
[1:00:15] see the trouble is we people will come
[1:00:17] to come to christ they'll lay themselves
[1:00:19] on the altar for a few years
[1:00:21] and then they stop sacrificing right
[1:00:23] they stop uh dying out to themselves
[1:00:26] right like you know it's just it's just
[1:00:29] a point some people never fast
[1:00:31] some people can be in the message and
[1:00:33] never fast
[1:00:35] well jesus said when you fast don't be
[1:00:38] like the hypocrites he didn't say
[1:00:39] if you want to fast he said when you
[1:00:41] fast amen
[1:00:43] praise god they asked him how come john
[1:00:46] and his disciples fast and how how come
[1:00:49] you
[1:00:49] and your disciples don't fast he said
[1:00:51] how can the children of the bridegroom
[1:00:53] fast
[1:00:54] while the bridegroom's with them praise
[1:00:56] god this is a happy time this is a
[1:00:58] joyous time
[1:00:59] he said but after the bridegroom leaves
[1:01:01] then they will fast church
[1:01:03] it's a continual sacrifice we've got to
[1:01:05] beat our bodies and bring them into
[1:01:07] subjection
[1:01:07] paul said i'll do anything so i'm not a
[1:01:10] castaway of the faith amen
[1:01:13] he said i'll beat my body bring it under
[1:01:15] subjection i must do many things
[1:01:18] like one time somebody said uh recently
[1:01:20] they said
[1:01:21] well you should gain some weight you
[1:01:22] should eat more i just had to look at
[1:01:24] him i said well
[1:01:26] if i if i do that i won't fast
[1:01:29] right i i mean i appreciate that that
[1:01:31] someone cares
[1:01:32] maybe i'm too skinny and that could be
[1:01:35] true
[1:01:35] but the point i'm trying to make is that
[1:01:38] uh and there was
[1:01:39] it was in love you know it was a love
[1:01:40] but the point i'm trying to make is like
[1:01:42] i've got a choice
[1:01:43] because i know i'm old enough to know
[1:01:44] i'm 40 years old right i want to know if
[1:01:46] the more you eat the more you want to
[1:01:48] eat
[1:01:49] is that right i mean that's how it is
[1:01:52] well it's true with the coffee the more
[1:01:54] i drink coffee the more i like it right
[1:01:57] and i don't put sugar in there so it's
[1:01:58] not it's not a bad thing
[1:02:00] but the point i'm trying to make is that
[1:02:02] we've got to bring our bodies into
[1:02:03] subjection
[1:02:04] we amen we've got to master our own
[1:02:06] bodies amen we've got to have
[1:02:08] temperance which is self-control praise
[1:02:10] god we're the ones that know how often
[1:02:13] we should fast right
[1:02:14] the holy spirit should work with us in
[1:02:16] such a personal way
[1:02:18] that we know how to bring our bodies
[1:02:20] into subjection
[1:02:21] to find his leadership amen oh
[1:02:23] hallelujah
[1:02:24] praise god amen in other words it's a
[1:02:26] time to seek the lord
[1:02:28] it's a time to humble yourself so when
[1:02:30] am i i do it at certain times
[1:02:31] usually throughout the week and
[1:02:34] different other times
[1:02:36] because i know i've got to find the mind
[1:02:37] of god
[1:02:40] my wife says i do that all the time amen
[1:02:41] church
[1:02:43] that's my little signature you know cam
[1:02:45] brother cam does this
[1:02:46] i do this what does simon do you have to
[1:02:49] look that one up next time he freaks his
[1:02:51] fart

[1:03:03] you don't get that high voice like that
[1:03:05] everybody's got their little
[1:03:06] quirks you know but sea church that's
[1:03:09] what we're looking at here
[1:03:12] where we've got to be keeping a feast
[1:03:14] we've got to be dedicated right
[1:03:16] we've got to be sincere and we've got to
[1:03:17] speak the truth praise god
[1:03:19] it's a continual self-sacrifice
[1:03:23] you've got to choose like someone sent
[1:03:25] me a brother
[1:03:26] he sent me another he fell back to
[1:03:28] pornography not in our church
[1:03:30] he's overseas actually and he said
[1:03:32] please tell me what to do i said i just
[1:03:33] wrote it in all caps
[1:03:35] resist the devil and he will flee praise
[1:03:38] god
[1:03:39] he said give me a word from the lord i
[1:03:40] said that's thus saith the word amen
[1:03:43] that's all you got to do you've got to
[1:03:44] resist if someone was breaking in your
[1:03:46] house would you stop it would you resist
[1:03:48] them or not
[1:03:49] somebody's going to take your lunch
[1:03:51] right off the table would you resist
[1:03:52] them or not
[1:03:53] you've got to resist you've got to fight
[1:03:55] back amen
[1:03:56] hallelujah that's how we realize we
[1:03:59] gotta fight back against the
[1:04:01] sin nature inside of us and we've got to
[1:04:04] be a continual sacrifice
[1:04:05] we have to realize yeah there's times
[1:04:07] where we can let off the pressure
[1:04:09] but then there's time we got to realize
[1:04:11] i need to sacrifice
[1:04:12] so i can contact heaven amen hallelujah
[1:04:18] like the last time jose came up for
[1:04:19] prayer for the glaucoma
[1:04:21] some of us were praying and fasting i
[1:04:22] remember another brother was praying and
[1:04:24] fast and i believe if i'm not mistaken
[1:04:26] that same day
[1:04:28] of course you know i would usually like
[1:04:29] to pass on sunday saturday a little bit
[1:04:31] too
[1:04:33] as i just think it's uh inspiring you
[1:04:35] know i think it's a it's a it's a thing
[1:04:36] we have to do
[1:04:37] we have to keep a con i wasn't planning
[1:04:39] on preaching this this much
[1:04:41] i'm using that part of my most of my
[1:04:42] time here
[1:04:44] but we have a continual sacrifice in
[1:04:47] heaven
[1:04:48] right but it's it's too it's to create
[1:04:50] glory it's to bring heaven down to earth
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:53] hallelujah right let thy will be done on
[1:04:56] earth
[1:04:56] as it is in heaven what is going on in
[1:04:58] heaven continual sacrifice amen
[1:05:01] right continual intercession amen and
[1:05:03] what's earth supposed to be like
[1:05:05] continual intercession amen where we
[1:05:08] are the priests now praise god he's the
[1:05:11] high priest
[1:05:12] we're priests unto god we're not high
[1:05:15] priests we're just regular priests
[1:05:16] praise god
[1:05:17] right but we have access to the high
[1:05:19] priest amen
[1:05:22] hallelujah through prayer and
[1:05:23] intercession we can contact
[1:05:25] the high priest who's a mediator between
[1:05:28] god and man
[1:05:29] amen glory
[1:05:36] so i didn't mean to preach on that so
[1:05:37] long but anyways god knows we must need
[1:05:40] it praise god
[1:05:41] now in ruth's remaining story boaz
[1:05:44] redeems naomi
[1:05:46] in order to purchase and marry ruth in
[1:05:49] ruth 4 verses 9
[1:05:51] through 10. now you know the story so
[1:05:52] justification she's i said i'm following
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:54] when she got justified it led her when
[1:05:56] she decided that
[1:05:58] it led her to barley season led her to
[1:06:00] passover
[1:06:01] letter to christ right and then but then
[1:06:03] she's got to find a way to get food
[1:06:04] right she's got to find a way she's got
[1:06:05] to go labor
[1:06:07] right and naomi says go to boaz go to
[1:06:09] the messiah
[1:06:10] go to christ right labor for christ amen
[1:06:13] church
[1:06:15] labor for jesus and he'll give you all
[1:06:17] these little extra
[1:06:18] sheaves praise god like our brother
[1:06:20] donnie reagan was saying one time
[1:06:22] uh it was a good one uh that one time
[1:06:24] boaz said leave her so many sheets i
[1:06:26] forget how many it was
[1:06:28] and brother donnie just he illustrated
[1:06:30] it and he said as ruth was carrying it
[1:06:31] back
[1:06:32] he said look i got a sheep or he's
[1:06:33] looking at the wheat and he said look
[1:06:35] here's a god hiding himself in
[1:06:36] simplicity here's serpent seed that
[1:06:39] those are the seeds that were in that
[1:06:40] sheath
[1:06:41] here's the the seven church ages here's
[1:06:44] the seven seals i thought that was a
[1:06:45] really good
[1:06:46] i thought that was a cute illustration
[1:06:49] because she had the food she had the
[1:06:51] fresh harvest praise god the fresh word
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] boaz the great kinsman redeemer left his
[1:06:58] word to his future wife amen
[1:07:01] because you know that church we're not
[1:07:03] physically married to jesus yet
[1:07:05] brother brahm said we're potentially
[1:07:06] married to him by the baptism of the
[1:07:08] holy ghost
[1:07:09] but we're not physically married to him
[1:07:11] till we meet him in the air praise god
[1:07:13] but
[1:07:14] i said we are going to the marriage
[1:07:16] supper praise god
[1:07:17] we're going to be married to him right
[1:07:20] now he said we're just potentially
[1:07:22] we're espoused we're engaged oh that's
[1:07:24] why we can be so excited because we're
[1:07:26] looking forward to a holy
[1:07:28] a perfect and eternal wedding praise god
[1:07:32] oh hallelujah
[1:07:36] and i know how excited i was for my
[1:07:38] wedding praise god so
[1:07:39] imagine how excited we should be for the
[1:07:41] heavenly wedding
[1:07:43] praise god i was so excited i said lord
[1:07:45] just hold off the rapture so i can get
[1:07:46] married and
[1:07:47] have a few kids you know i think i said
[1:07:49] something like that
[1:07:50] but i knew i said hold it off so at
[1:07:52] least at least can get married you know
[1:07:54] because you know i didn't like my
[1:07:55] parents divorce and it really hurt me
[1:07:57] and
[1:07:57] i just wanted to do it right i want to
[1:07:58] do it god's way i wanted to know what
[1:08:01] real love was praise god
[1:08:03] god sure give me a wonderful wife and
[1:08:05] family praise god
[1:08:08] now
[1:08:11] so boaz redeems uh ruth and naomi
[1:08:15] he redeems naomi in order to marry your
[1:08:17] ruth
[1:08:18] this is the type of jesus shedding his
[1:08:20] blood on the cross
[1:08:21] in order to purchase both jew naomi
[1:08:25] and gentile ruth praise god beautiful
[1:08:29] acts 20 verse 28 says jesus purchased
[1:08:32] us with his own blood right just like
[1:08:35] boaz purchased them with his own money
[1:08:37] right
[1:08:38] so jesus purchased us with his own blood
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:42] hallelujah now after their marriage ruth
[1:08:45] bears a son named obed
[1:08:47] and lets naomi nurse her son or her seed
[1:08:51] right this types the seed life of the
[1:08:54] gentile church

[1:11:35] let's just start the shunamite so let's
[1:11:37] go there
[1:11:38] uh let's go to song of solomon if you
[1:11:39] would please song of solomon
[1:11:44] uh yeah give me five minutes here we'll
[1:11:46] finish because that's almost half hour
[1:11:48] so it'll be about 35 minutes sermon
[1:11:49] praise god
[1:11:51] uh song of solomon
[1:11:56] and uh little readers here let's have uh
[1:11:58] nature would you like to read
[1:12:00] yeah you like song and stop and that's
[1:12:01] right can you can you read uh
[1:12:04] song of solomon chapter 6 verse 13
[1:12:07] nature
[1:12:14] and then lydia song of solomon 1 verse 8
[1:12:18] malachi song solomon 2 verse 2
[1:12:21] and haven solo song of solomon six verse
[1:12:24] nine so nature's got 613
[1:12:28] lydia 1 8 malachi 2 2 and
[1:12:32] haven 6 verse 9. all right let's close
[1:12:34] with this thought here by god's grace
[1:12:36] it's just ah this is so beautiful
[1:13:01] the name of
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:09] yeah great thank you nature praise the
[1:13:11] lord
[1:13:12] so here's the the one place in this book
[1:13:15] where they name
[1:13:16] this bride this is the only place in the
[1:13:19] book where she's named
[1:13:21] she's not given a literal name she's
[1:13:23] just called the shulamite
[1:13:24] good job nature shulamite now the
[1:13:28] hebrew definition at least in the
[1:13:29] easton's bible dictionary means
[1:13:31] from shunim and shunim is a little
[1:13:35] village
[1:13:36] in the tribe of issachar okay so that's
[1:13:38] a jewish
[1:13:39] jewish tribe right all right
[1:13:44] so here we see a shulamite now
[1:13:47] the reason she types the bride of christ
[1:13:50] is because she is solomon's love
[1:13:52] interest
[1:13:53] in the entire book and she's his only
[1:13:56] love interest we know he really fell
[1:13:58] away in his older days right
[1:14:00] the bible said when he got old he got
[1:14:02] cold on god and fell in love with more
[1:14:04] women and their worship more than he
[1:14:05] loved god and god got angry god gave him
[1:14:08] uh god gave him adversaries the end of
[1:14:11] his life
[1:14:12] he was always constantly battling this
[1:14:13] guy i forget the name of the kings
[1:14:15] he just kept battling them because of
[1:14:16] his own belief
[1:14:19] but notice throughout this whole book
[1:14:20] it's just a beautiful book
[1:14:22] throughout the entire book he's not
[1:14:24] interested in any other woman just her
[1:14:26] she's never divorced and she's never put
[1:14:28] away like
[1:14:29] israel was amen
[1:14:34] she is his one and only lydia read the
[1:14:36] song of solomon one verse eight
[1:14:48] she was not a fair one among women she
[1:14:51] was the fairest
[1:14:53] among women the bride of jesus christ is
[1:14:56] not
[1:14:56] a good church she is the purest church
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:01] i don't know she's not one bride she is
[1:15:03] the bride amen
[1:15:05] she's the fairest of all the women amen
[1:15:09] hallelujah this is the only woman
[1:15:12] solomon's interest in
[1:15:14] in the entire book and solomon is what
[1:15:16] son of david
[1:15:18] praise god and son of david speaks of
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:21] millennium praise the lord amen malachi
[1:15:25] song of solomon 2 2.
[1:15:32] amen so we have a bunch of thorns does
[1:15:35] that remind you of hebrews chapter 6
[1:15:36] brother jose it just struck me hebrews 6
[1:15:38] the bible talks about thorns and how the
[1:15:40] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:42] but we're not thorns we're not bringing
[1:15:45] forth thistles
[1:15:46] we're lilies amen bringing forth
[1:15:48] fragrance and
[1:15:50] and blessing and beauty praise god amen
[1:15:53] we're a lily amongst a bunch of thorns
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:57] hallelujah so what should we do grow up
[1:15:59] in the christ amen
[1:16:01] hallelujah face the sun let the sun
[1:16:03] empower you praise god amen
[1:16:06] use the strength to grow up to the son
[1:16:08] hallelujah
[1:16:10] you're the fairest of all the churches
[1:16:13] you're the lily the beauty amongst all
[1:16:16] the
[1:16:18] immorality
[1:16:20] praise god and then uh haven song psalms
[1:16:24] 6
[1:16:32] 9.
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:46] foreign
[1:16:49] hey man george how can you say hardly
[1:16:52] any better words about a woman here
[1:16:55] she's blessed she's a dove she's the
[1:16:58] choicest of all the journal
[1:16:59] i got eight kids and we're not trying to
[1:17:01] you know we're not trying to show
[1:17:03] favorites or anything like that but
[1:17:04] in a family a big family in the old
[1:17:07] testament they recognize
[1:17:08] well this is the fairest of all of them
[1:17:11] this is the choicest of all of them
[1:17:13] praise god
[1:17:15] everybody knew this one this one's a
[1:17:17] she's extra special praise god
[1:17:20] hey amen hilaria she's affairs
[1:17:23] she's the lilly among thorns amen she's
[1:17:25] the one and only she's the blessed one
[1:17:27] she's special she's different than all
[1:17:29] the others why because she's been washed
[1:17:31] by the waters of the word
[1:17:34] all the other ones are dirty all the
[1:17:35] other ones are unclean all the other
[1:17:37] ones aren't prepared but you and i have
[1:17:39] been washed by the word amen
[1:17:42] a real cleansing amen i trust your soul
[1:17:44] feels that way tonight
[1:17:46] you're truly clean in your soul amen
[1:17:49] the bible said purified through the
[1:17:51] obedience
[1:17:52] to faith in your soul peter said that
[1:17:55] you're purified in your soul the other
[1:17:58] churches
[1:17:58] can't claim that they can't even get
[1:18:00] their minds pure let alone their souls
[1:18:02] but our souls have been washed in the
[1:18:04] blood of jesus amen
[1:18:07] hallelujah no he didn't put this one
[1:18:10] away at least in the book
[1:18:12] no this one wasn't put away this was the
[1:18:14] choices this was the
[1:18:16] the fairest of all of them now solomon
[1:18:19] was the fairest of ten thousand right so
[1:18:21] i'm trying to make sure i use the right
[1:18:22] language here because i keep wanting to
[1:18:24] say
[1:18:24] you're the fairest of ten thousand
[1:18:26] that's that's for that's for christ
[1:18:30] the bride is the fairest among all the
[1:18:32] women
[1:18:35] now the shulami again was from the tribe
[1:18:38] of issachar
[1:18:39] a little village in the issachar area
[1:18:42] now song of solomon 3 verses 9 through
[1:18:45] 11. can you read that one
[1:18:47] lydia i'm sorry malachi can you read
[1:18:49] that song of solomon 3
[1:18:52] 9-11 this this name
[1:18:54] solomon so we know it's it's speaking of
[1:19:06] solomon
[1:19:21] hey man praise god
[1:19:24] i was looking on the map i wasn't i
[1:19:26] didn't have uh
[1:19:28] didn't think to look up where issachar
[1:19:29] was but i can't find it right now
[1:19:30] because all the
[1:19:32] i was all the words in these old maps
[1:19:34] but here it names oh this is chapter
[1:19:36] three
[1:19:36] so this is solomon getting ready to go
[1:19:39] uh
[1:19:40] to meet his bride amen because their
[1:19:42] honeymoon and
[1:19:43] uh their wedding night is at the end of
[1:19:45] chapter three and in chapter four
[1:19:49] so this is i'm sorry specifically names
[1:19:53] solomon as the bridegroom and the
[1:19:56] shulamite as his
[1:19:57] lover and king so chapters one through
[1:20:00] three traces their romance from the
[1:20:02] beginning
[1:20:03] to the end of their engagement the
[1:20:06] shulamite she's asking to be drawn into
[1:20:08] fellowship
[1:20:09] uh by her lover despite her black
[1:20:12] sunburnt skin
[1:20:14] now this black sunburst skin shows she
[1:20:16] was a vineyard worker
[1:20:18] labor and she was not of royal ascent to
[1:20:21] the flesh
[1:20:23] amen because royalty don't work in the
[1:20:26] sun
[1:20:28] right but she worked outside so much you
[1:20:30] know there's scripture makes it sound
[1:20:32] like she's a shepherd but she no doubt
[1:20:33] worked in the vineyard as well
[1:20:35] so right away her skin color is
[1:20:38] connected with the gentile clan of
[1:20:40] keter which was a clan of the
[1:20:42] ishmaelites
[1:20:44] in song of solomon 1 verse 5. so can you
[1:20:46] read that real quick maokai
[1:20:47] song of psalm 1 verse 5. she said look
[1:20:50] upon me she
[1:20:51] she was asking for his love amen now
[1:20:53] remember she's the
[1:20:54] most beautiful one of the family but yet
[1:20:57] she's
[1:20:57] not royalty right go ahead okay
[1:21:07] amen so this gives evidence that she's
[1:21:10] jewish but she has an appearance as a
[1:21:12] gentile
[1:21:14] praise god amen hallelujah you and i are
[1:21:17] gentiles
[1:21:18] but inside we're spiritual jews amen
[1:21:21] that's right so see she's a type of the
[1:21:24] new testament church
[1:21:25] composed of both jew and gentile
[1:21:30] amen hallelujah
[1:21:33] so she's saying don't look at my outside
[1:21:36] on my outside
[1:21:36] i'm not royalty i'm i'm nothing special
