========================================

the 101 lays the foundation so I just want to go back to the foundations of a home church so let's go to 1 Timothy 3 and then we'll go to Hebrews 10 very familiar scriptures here but I just want to take it here tonight by God's grace brother the Patrick God bless you sir how you doing good real good thank you sir good to see you tonight 1 Timothy 3 and I might even shorten the the reading here just to reserve time it's already 7 o'clock here first Timothy three I wanted to do one through seven but I imagine we'll just read it um uh later on but let's just go to four and five let's go to verses four and five you know as a pastor I don't always like preaching on my duties or responsibilities but I'm going to do that tonight I don't do a lot of it um I just haven't had to after 18 years of Pastor and you know most people understand or have heard of the scriptures but uh we'll go over this here tonight by God's grace uh because of all the circumstances and I'll Trust be a blessing to you by God's grace verse four one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God so notice there's one man who takes care of the Church of God the local church and the way we know he can do it is because how he handles his house his own house the pre the prerequisite for being a pastor is having a Godly house in order Hallelujah that's the that's the prerequisite okay so Hebrews 10:24 and 25 and here where we're seeing where we're supposed to gather more as we see that day approaching praise God Hebrews 10 24 and 25 we can all read this Hebrews 10:24 and 25 very familiar uh scripture we'll read these here but God bless brother Mercy let's read this on three ready one two three and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see that day approaching may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated I do have some uh quotes here and scriptures so have your Bible handy I'm going to start with the the the 101 or the scriptural foundation for a home church and uh then by God's grace we'll I got numerous quotes from uh the prophet here that picture might look familiar if you've been here a long time that I used that in 2015 when I when we had the Pennsylvania Saints moving and we were over in that other Sanctuary over there I did a series on the home church so I'm just recycling that from 10 years ago hard to believe it's been 10 years we've been in this facility here by God's grace um but we did we read our text here tonight and I'd like to just do a Bible teaching on the home church and try to lay this out here um to give us an understanding here uh how the home church has operated and I think it'll help us give more clarity on uh uh current situations here so uh to start with you know where's a pastor found the Bible it's Ephesians 4:11 so You' got your Bibles we'll go to that here and like I said we'll just try to be quickly through here I spent most of my time on quotes today because I that's where I needed to spend most of my time digging through and finding quotes uh by God's grace so I didn't get time to put all the scriptures on here but most of you are are pretty familiar if I started reading it you might be able to finish it uh the verse verse 11 uh and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now the word pastor means Shepherd and the shepherd has to be just like all the others has to be different from all others that's why it's differentiated uh you have the Apostle Apostle means one cent so Pastor is not sent a pastor stays an apostle is sent out to start new churches right uh the prophet is not the pastor the prophet is the one who speaks in the name of the Lord foretells things interprets the word of God hallelujah and he's not one who stays uh the teacher is not one who stays he's not the shepherd he's the one that gives very deep instruction in the things of God hallelujah and the Evangelist doesn't say the Evangelist goes like in a circuit we saw it with Samuel in the Old Testament he he was a prophet but he he demonstrated that and then we see in the book of Acts Paul and Barnabas said let us go unto the churches that we've already started let's see how they do and we see Philip the Evangelist in Acts chapter 8 going to Samaria he does signs wonders and miracles stir up the faith of the people uh so we see different Ministries so uh with regarding the home Church a Shepherd Faithfully ministers to the Sheep stays there with the Sheep uh we know all Christians can't travel along with the Apostle right not all of us can afford to get on the planes and go on all every trip with the Apostle can we or the Evangelist nor do us some of us have the energy right and brother Jesse said amen hallelujah sister Kristen said amen we all said amen so uh if God's called you to a Ministry he'll back up he'll back up your ministry and then he'll open doors for your ministry the Bible said in Proverbs a man's gift makes room for himself so my gift to Pastor made its way uh I never thought I'd be a pastor but what happened to Tim Myers who started this this Fellowship he moved down to North Carolina there's only one person left who's a preacher that was me I didn't have to push my way into this I didn't have to do politics to become a pastor I was the only one on the ballot to be Pastor I never I never had to push myself into this and neither will anyone who's really called of God God will open it up to them you know even in the old Bible days no one even voted in the Bible days voting wasn't even in the Bible it was just God's leadership of men who were filled with the Holy Ghost right but as we passed along in time you know uh it's just been uh it's been one thing the church has adopted I think it's a good thing brother Bram said it's a good thing brother Bram said the vote of the church is the will of the Holy Ghost so brother said the the Holy Ghost now speaks through voting and so our church doesn't vote every year uh it's up to the discretion of the pastor we really only have a couple uh a couple offices really and I feel most of them by God's grace but that's because nobody else want to do other ones or they're not uh they're not fit to do them right you have to meet the quality ifications and so by God's grace that falls on me but every church is unique and and brother Bram did that when he first started his church he said he was everything he was song leader Deacon Pastor trustee he said you name it Pastor he was everything and so God has all kinds of varieties Hallelujah so uh you we see the pastor is different from all others uh you know Hebrews 10:24 says we gather more well where do we where do sheep gather if we're if we're the flock of God remember Peter said feed the flock of God right uh it's also said in Acts chapter 20 feed the flock of God Paul told Paul told the Ephesians well where do where do the where do the Flock go they go to a Shepherd right they stay with the shepherd so we can see if we're going to gather more and it's going to be one of these gifts uh where are the people going to gather they're going to go to the pastor to Shepherd them and also you know we read this on Sunday but uh in Matthew 18 Jesus said if there's a sin tell it to the church now he didn't mean the whole church worldwide uh Paul would had been Paul and I think about that every Pastor would had been sending letters to every every church every Christian Church in the whole world telling people sins so that that's impossible right and that's that's not what it was meant to do uh Jesus gave us instruction how the local church handles sin tell it to the local church right Paul wasn't saying you know the entire world the entire wild worldwide of Believers needs to know every sin and every uh disagreement or transgression in the in in the whole world it was just to the local church so if you put these things in context uh they they're very well understood uh by the grace of God now I just thought this too I found this and I'm going to just read this here uh by God's grace I I I knew this but I went and looked it up you know when when uh I looked at last week remember we looked at how um Babylon came in and dispersed uh the is is Israelis right destroyed the temple a lot of those Jews were taken to Babylon and they didn't want to lose their Fai so what did they do they started weekly meetings on the Sabbath which was for them Sundown Friday night to sundown uh Saturday night right because that's when the new day started at sundown so so for Jews it would already be Thursday for the Jews right now it already to be there Thursday right because the day ends When the Sun Goes Down start the new day starts uh but this started there in Babylon so they focused on prayer uh scripture reading and teaching in Babylon or wherever they were scattered Assyria I mean the Bible said all nations God said I'll scatter you to All Nations and so he did um and then during the time of the second temple zal's temple synagogues were established so once all the Jews or not all the Jews but once the Jews started coming back they started putting synagogues all over Israel and synagogues were just like little churches little centers of worship study and uh they were to supplement because that's what they had to do in Babylon they just met at synagogues they couldn't do animal sacrifices so once they got back well now they can do animal sacrifices but they like the weekly Gatherings and that was under the blood of bulls and goats what about under the Holy Ghost hallelujah how much more we appreciate weekly Gatherings Hallelujah that's right and so they uh after they returned they started doing the synagogues they just built different synagogues and if you know your Bible right we looked at a few weeks ago uh Luke 4:16 said Jesus his custom was always to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath so Jesus and all his Apostles right all his Apostles would have echoed him right or mimicked him imitated him and so they all would have went to the synagogue and every Saturday so Jesus Christ gives us this Foundation of what we call a home Church it started out of necessity now think about that I'm so glad I live in the New Testament I'm so glad I don't live in the Old Testament in the Old Testament you only appeared before God three times right that's far as required right you had to make a big sacrifice if you live far away Northern Israel or Southern you had to make a big sacrifice to go there but God required it if you're a Jew you got to go three times a year at the main three festivals right we've been through that the the seven feasts but a lot of them are kind of tied together close together right and so those are the three times and and so if you live far away you'd only go to church three three times out of the year as far now you might stay seven days to do all the feast days and you might be there for a week or more beyond that but you didn't get much fellowships think about that all that time you spend the rest of the year away from church I'm glad we can come here and worship God we can see one another multiple times a week hallelujah what a joy Hallelujah so no doubt the New Testament is so much a better Covenant Hallelujah with better promises amen but see they would spend months away from each other it been months since I saw brother Mercy months since I saw Austin and Lena and finally they get back together and bring their animals along and and they make all the conveniences and all the sacrifices and it would be so long and no doubt we can see how easily they'd fall away with their idol worship they they couldn't afford to go to church they didn't have time they didn't have the luxury like Vehicles we got they didn't have the luxury to go to up to the temple once a week yeah so see if they miss one you know if they if they don't confess their sin you know what might happen well the if you don't confess your sin what happens the sin gets greater and greater and greater and so then and then you know Paul and and isaah not Paul Isaiah and Jeremiah rebuke them and God says you you bring those sacrifices now three times a year but it's a stench in my nose he said I hate your burnt offerings because for all the other months they would reject God and worship idols and they try to come and keep their religion on the feast days and God said said I don't accept that what I accept is a broken and contrite spirit Hallelujah that's the sacrifices of God that God wants to see when we're Broken Hallelujah now and so this uh especially happened again of course from the second temple zable which about uh 55 uh BC and all the way down to the time of the Lord Jesus 500 years there and now it's been going on ever since by the grace of God this weekly Gathering Hallelujah now if you got your Bible 1 Timothy 3 now we I read through this earlier uh the bishop here means overseer so I'll look at this again 1 Timothy now this has to mean remember this this word Bishop has to mean the Pastor because Paul never mentioned Bishop in Ephesians 4:11 there's only five preaching gifts B Bishop is not a six there's only five right there there can only be one I mean there got to be one of those it's not it's not listed so the bishop the overseer has to be the pastor because which one of those gifts are overseeing of flock of people it has to be the pastor so that that's why you if you study your Bible you'll know the word Pastor bishop and Elder can all mean the same thing brother man lays it out in the church age book but most people haven't read the church age book but you need to you read you need to read the church age book hallelujah it's such a blessing Hallelujah now verse one this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth the good work now brother R says a man always run from the call but here it says at some point the man has to want the call right people run from God but eventually they got to want to do it so see you got to balance all these things out verse two a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife he can't be married twice three times Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality he has to be able to teach so I know if I'm a pastor I must be able to teach and I Do by God's grace now verse three not given to Wine nor Striker nor greedy a filthy ler and I have a video that goes through every one of these definitions I want to get to the main quotes tonight okay so you I've already preached out before years ago I got on video so I'm not going to go through all these uh but you can look it up here and maybe I will maybe Sunday we'll see but patient must be patient not a brawler not Covetous right one that ruleth his own house well having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God In fact the first thing brother Brook said uh when I told him I might Pastor he said I've always known you'd be a pastor because of how you treat your wife and your kids that's what brother Brooks told me and of course he ordained me to be Pastor here in akan not a novice now I started pastoring in 2006 so I was only saved about six years but brother Brooks saw the maturity in my life I was already mature enough I wasn't easily deceived or swooned over or I didn't have any of these uh uh sinful characteristics in my life so he's recognized me and church I believe my testimony has stood the test of time but it's only because Christ is in me hallelujah it's not my goodness I'm not preaching on me I'm preaching about what the the Bible says a Christian should have and a Christian can only have it because of Christ in us the hope of Glory Hallelujah because Christ gave me and each one of us a portion of his attributes of his character Hallelujah that's right not a novice or a young believer lest being lifted up with pride he shall fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them that are without so my job lest he fall into reproach and snare of the devil all right now then it goes into deep I'm also a deacon so these could be some of my all my requirements as well Hallelujah okay so you can see it it's one man he rules the house of God okay now the pastor rules his church like his home and this what I'm get I'm want to get to eventually I don't let my children disrespect me in my home so that's why I'm not going to let anybody disrespect me in this church Hallelujah you can't you can't let it happen if I let it happen in my home things bad things are going to happen in my home brother BR says there's a quote I'll get to brother BR says if you're he said if you're in the church you ought to be 100% with your pastor if not go somewhere else go find a someone you can support 100% we don't need more people we need more character that's it right there I didn't plan to say that but that was good amen because it goes along with brother R's quote amen it's not the amount of the people not the quality it's not the quantity it's the quality Hallelujah that's right and I've never begged anybody to come to this church Hallelujah you just come because you're led by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's just way it should always be now Titus 1:5 here uh again now he says uh Bishop uh and Elder now here it's an elder which means a bishop or overseer so which which of those five is overseeing a flock of Believers it have to be the pastor and then if you compare a lot of these requirements are repeated what where we just read in 1 Timothy chapter 3 so look at verse 5 for this cause left I Thee in cre that thou should us set in order the things that are wanting and ordain Elders in every city as I appointed thee now so see here it looks like Paul's telling Titus you've got the Holy Ghost you you pray and fast just like they did in the book of Acts remember before they sent forth Paul and Barnabas they prayed and fasted with prophets and teachers and then the Holy Ghost told them who to go with the Holy Ghost sent them out so in the in these Bible days the book of Acts they would just pray and God would vindicate that one as the pastor that one the pastor that City that one God would just Vindicated by the leadership of those who had the Holy Ghost but not today of course we vote but we believe your holy ghost in you is voting through you Hallelujah if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of Riot or unruly for a bishop must be blameless so see Elder and Bishop is the same thing Bishop means overseer and a Shepherd oversees sheep as the steward of God not self-willed not soon angry not given to Wine no Striker not given to Filthy luer but a lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men sober just holy temperate holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught so I was taught by Brother Brooks by Brother Craig uh Boer that he may be able to by sound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the gains Sailors for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision in that day Hallelujah the church said amen all right Hebrews 13:7 and8 you know we always say brother Rams you know his his motto was Hebrews 138 yes it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but what verse is before that I pray I I pray somebody tell me what what is the context of that verse the context is men ruling the church who are filled with the Holy Ghost verse seven remember them which have the what someone's got to rule God said could chose one man to rule the local church who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation so I should be an example you should look at my faith how does my faith work out in my life and you should try to follow that don't follow my mistakes but follow me like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ Hallelujah because everyone has mistakes but follow their overall faith that they have the faith in the word hallelujah and how do you know their faith by their works amen okay and then okay and then now we go to verse eight Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we don't have time but remember in numbers 27 I'm not mistaken I don't I don't have the verse but Moses is dying and God told Moses go get Joshua and ordain him as a man for the people to see that he'll go before the people lead the people take them out and bring them in God never said a dead man can be the pastor God set up a living man as the pastor and Bram Tabernacle should have said amen now verse 17 same same chapter this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he always had one man ruling as far as the local church of course there was always one major prophet right like Moses or Joshua right we know that down through the age verse 17 obey them that have the rule again rule someone has to give the rules and but it's not their rules by their own ideas it's their Rules by the word of God and submit yourselves the trouble is the trouble happens when people won't submit to the rule of the word that's when trouble happens I got a text Sunday about you know uh things as a mess in the church I don't say it's a mess but if there's a mess it's the Bible said it's always caused by Pride that's right right uh the Bible said wherever pride is there's contention so any mess would be someone who's not not giving in uh to the submission of the word and it could be the pastor it could be uh a deacon it could be any anybody but in each case you got to go back and say who's not submitting to the rule of the word that's how you know Hallelujah for what do they do now those that preach verse 17 for they watch over your soul as they that must give an account one day I'll give an account of the souls that were in Aron that they may do it with joy and not with grief so it's one or the other you live such a life that the pastor is joyful about your testimony or you live such a life that it Grieves the pastor is that right is that the word of God and notice the same word rule as in 1 Timothy 3 if he rules his house well then he'll rule the church well Hallelujah for that is unprofitable for you so see there's a lot of people that are going to lose profit on the day of judgment because of how they're misbehaved in the local church to The Men Who rule or the man who ruled in the local church that's what the Bible says it won't it won't be profitable for them if the pastor has Joy about their testimony or grief if Joy they get rewards if grief there's no profit there lose out on rewards right that's the word of God hallelujah this is the laying the groundwork right this is 101 this is the very beginning of of having a home church right this is this is Bible home Church 101 right the very simple things here now remember uh first timoth let's go back to 1 Timothy 5 we read this on Sunday verse 17 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor not just honor double honor now I know some people go way too far I don't want worship no Pastor no real genuine pastor wants worship but there there's something where where where we can show double honor if you honor somebody but then with with the the the pastors that rule well or the preachers you must give them double honor if they rule well right if they don't rule well bring bring correction to them right talk to them bring correction right like brother man said if I make a mistake he said whether you're a janitor whether you're a deacon he said meet me privately we'll talk about it that's right especially those who labor in the word and in Doctrine so instruction and the Declaration of the word of God so preaching and teaching really that's what that is preaching and teaching preaching is just declaring God's A Healer God hears your prayers God's faithful now but doctrine's different Doctrine tells you how to pray right how to fast how how to do all these things how to understand this right preaching is the seals are open the the seventh Angels come the Bible says what and then the teaching says what do the seals mean right young Brothers we going going through that last Sunday that's what teaching us it tells you what it means Hallelujah gives you instruction Verse 18 for the scripture sayith Thou shalt not muzzle the ax that treadeth out the corn and the laborer is worthy of his reward okay now that's also used in 1 Corinthians 9 with uh preachers accepting ties that's that's the that's the scripture so if an ax was uh if Ox was was grinding corn he could he could every now and then stop down and eat some of that corn and God said that's natural he's doing the work he should get a little bit of that he's got to eat right he's got to he's got to do that verse 19 against an elder so the overseer the bishop the pastor receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses now brother takes it even further when they came against brother Neville I'll show you the quote in 1957 he said you have to swear by it with an oath swear to God you saw that Pastor do that sin he said I he said I he said you have to say I swear I saw brother Neville drunk now brother was just giving an example brother Neville never got drunk he's saying You must swear he did it and then have proof that he did it just like at the court you can take anybody to court but you ain't going to win unless you got substantial proof real proof right two or three Witnesses now and my wife sent me a good verses we can you know we were talking you know uh God has to put so much Authority and and uh to the pastor and so much protection because the Bible said they're going to endure hardness like Paul says if you're a preacher you have to endure the hardness of the job it's not an easy job and I'm not asking for no one's asking for pity right neither is being a mom an easy job right it's not an easy job nor dad or whatever you know but we all got different responsibilities but God had to give such protection to the pastor because it would be such a difficult thing imagine a a Shepherd taking care of all these sheep and all uh and all the dangers and all the villains he's got to protect right imagine all the real real enemies out there it's not an easy job it's a hard job so he's got to have these protections built in so he does verse 20 them that sin rebuke before all that others may also fear so see sometimes we get common to each other we we lose some of the honor for one another I'm just not talking pastors but one another and so sometimes sins have to be preached publicly to bring us back to Godly fear so we don't become common to each other so remember that Christ is in each one of us and how we treat our brother sister is how we would treat our lord Jesus if he was here brother R says however you're acting now to the pastor or the Ministry is exactly how you would have acted to Noah or Jeremiah or Isaiah or even the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah like brother man use that that that quote he'll say well if Jesus was here i' i' I'd do better I'd do this and that brother man said no you wouldn't you do exactly what you're doing right now Jesus said it's better that the Holy Ghost is here that's what Jesus said because then he can be in more than one place at one time hallelujah hallelujah glory to God all right verse 21 I charge thee before God so I got a pastor has a charge a duty before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect Angels even the angels are watching us right because remember we'll judge the fallen angels that are trying to discourage us or tempt us we'll judge them see we have a charge before the and then of course the elector the saved angels that thou observe these things without part preferring one another so I can't say well because I like this sister I'm not going toing out the sin or I like that brother I'm not going to bring out the sin the Bible said do nothing with partiality right without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality Hallelujah this is home Church 101 welcome to class half the class is over I went do the history of this now I I don't I didn't have time to get these quotes but in 1964 they asked brother brandom you know is it okay to miss church to go hunting and brother man said no he said if you act if you possibly have a chance he said get in church and brother man said somebody told me I don't want to be illegalist brother BR said you ought to be a legalist at least at the beginning to come to church now everybody does a great job here by God's grace but I I can pull the quote if you want to look up legalist in 1963 or 64 you'll find it it's either in questions answers on the seal 63 or the four-part questions answers 1964 and two quotes uh people told Brother R brother ROM I I'm just as good of a Christian if I stay at home brother R says twice you cannot be as good of a Christian if you don't come to church he said because this is the table where God's food is fed to us hallelujah it's the shoe bread it's the the bread of God's face Hallelujah so if you miss God's table you miss God's food you won't get have God's spiritual vitamins and nutrition I know about your house but I don't want to miss one meal of my wife boy she can really Cook Brothers if you got a good wife cook you're blessed Hallelujah Glory I know all the sisters cook real good here so Hallelujah you're blessed but think about if you didn't have that meal how'd you feel I'd feel hungry I'd feel starving I'd feel angry right hry there it is see and so we got to stay in the presence of God that's where you get the food of God the strength of God hallelujah the life of God hallelujah I got the quotes if you want them text me I'll be happy to get them I just have time because I want to spend at least I'm already half my I'm right at half my time okay Saints there's 130 quotes where brother BR says post of Duty that means stay at your home Church go to your home church it's more it's almost almost three times as much as third pole quotes but I tell you like this if you if you're a part of the home church if you honor these quotes then you'll experience the third poll quotes speaking the word that's right hallelujah look at this in 1958 in 58 brother BR says tomorrow Lord willing if if it falls my lot to speak tomorrow afternoon so he's on a Saturday he says tomorrow afternoon a Sunday afternoon that is not on the healing service but an Evangelistic service and if you and your pastor your congregation can see to come we'd be happy to have you now look at this Sunday we do not ask people to leave their post of Duty unless the church has fully cooperated and you have no services at your church so brother Ram's in Iowa and he says you're going to have church tomorrow on Sunday he said we're not going to have our special meetings in the morning because we don't want to take anybody from their home church right so he would have a service right there in the middle between morning service and evening service when churches used to have evening service and the church said now we're getting back to our Sunday now I told you mothers if you if you're tired you just take a nap and St at home all right you can stream it God knows I've never carried a baby I'm never gonna but I know as you get as you get more experience I'll say like that as you get more experience uh it becomes harder so try to say the right words you by God's grace but look what brother man says we're here as a visitor we don't want to pull anyone from their poster Duty that's why I never tell anybody oh you leave your home Church come to our church I never pull anybody from their post of Duty we're trying to help that church grow and we want every member at his own church now I didn't have the quote here but brother R says I don't even I don't even want your tithes and offerings he said give that to your home Church brother said that I got the quotes he said don't give it to the widow woman give it to your he said give your offerings to the widow woman give your tithe to your brother bam loved the home Church why CU he was a pastor for 17 years in a homech Church Hallelujah all by basically all by himself for many of those years that's why he loved the home church because he was a bible-based prophet and then if you have sickness and you want to be prayed for tomorrow night get permission from your pastor this is called double respect double honor you don't have to ask me permission to anything but if you had double honor you might I'll just leave it at that and some people I never hear from them for months or weeks or what what maybe I maybe it was too long since I preached a 101 so forgive me if that's that' be my fault my fault Lord tell them what you want to do if it's the only night you can get here we'd be glad to have you but first is your duty at your church and tomorrow afternoon everybody I guess has no Services tomorrow afternoon so if you can come out I want to preach tomorrow Lord willing a perverted life and about an hour of your time I suppose I suppose at 2:30 look at that 2:30 2:30 was in between the morning and in the evening now for everything uh everything outside the Bible for everything outside the Bible the church has to have bylaws which are just rules I got the copy if you want a copy I'll print you off a copy if you want a copy it' be easier to send you a PDF but I could I'll print it off too save a little paper but um for every other area that's not specifically in the Bible you have to have bylaws okay brother Ram said and every so often according to the by of our church every year the deacons and trustees automatically fill their time or they they they did one year uh oneyear term so the Deacon was a was a deacon for a whole year and then he had the choice at the end of the year whether he wanted to continue the next year or not okay now uh ours is ours is a little unique but I'm just reading what brother Ram said here now every year the deacons or trustees automatically fill their time if they want to come back all right if they do not want to come back then they can place some in their places and this board has resigned brother Braham said it's the sovereignty of the law of the church by the word of God the bylaws right and the word of God you have your church bylaws that's why we wrote them now we wrote them in 2015 because that's when homosexuality was legalized and it was told to us by lawyers you better put you better get some bylaws and says that you don't have to marry homosexuals or else they can sue you but if you got a bylaw saying you don't have to then you're you're protected and then also put in there I'm glad I put it in there I said I will not marry anybody unless they go through seven rounds of counseling so I've had people come and ask me will you uh will you marry me and then if I say no this then they won't even invite me to the wedding that shows how much they don't even care about me they just want a preacher to marry them a little old nobody preacher no thanks I don't know how your life is going to turn out if I don't counsel with you I don't know what your I don't want my my name attached to that wedding I don't unless I know they got Godly character so thank God we put that in there I'm so glad my goodness he says therefore they just can't say well I think this man would be the right man for this or this or that brother Neville thinks this man would be the right man or the truste board thinks this no it has to be done by the church no one does anything within himself here it's the vote of the church it's a sovereign church now every church is different as we'll see the old set of bylaws was destroyed in the 1937 flood we've recopied those and will'll be hung on the wall over here soon the duties of the trustees deacons treasurers and so forth Pastor Associates and so forth so that's the sovereignty of the local church brother says now I'm getting this this is a very long quote if you want to listen to this and get a good understanding of the church home Church 101 listen to this sermon I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly Let each church have its own choose its own pastors its deacons whatever it is and that way the man in there has no Bishop over him like denominations right so in denominations if you're a Lutheran Pastor you're at let's say you're in a little town There's a bishop over you that has authority over you but there's nobody authority over me except the Holy Ghost right that's the beauty of the local church and the real Holy Ghost F Church man can't come in here and say I don't like Jesse I'm gonna get rid of him well you got a you got a like to you have a lot to dislike about me I agree but you can't remove me only the church can remove me and that's done by two-thirds vote that's in the bylaws yes he says the Holy Spirit want if the Holy Spirit wants to speak speak some to the church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or that it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit show me by the Bible what's greater than the Bible than a local Elder to a local church I just took you through the Bible who has more Authority in the church than anybody it's the pastor and brother Bram says that show me somebody greater that has more rule more Authority in the local church there's nobody he says that's right yes sir the sovereignty of local church each Church in itself he'll say it again in another way whoops by the way uh yes while I'm speaking somebody around this country is guilty of riding some cards to move brother Neville out of this pit you're going to have to settle that with me he says people speaking against his his Pastor right he said uhhuh uhuh yes indeed now I want you something said something about the Deacon board the Deacon board has not one thing to do with that the pastor no sir the congregation in full has all the authority a deacon board is just a policeman here in the church just to keep order and so forth when it comes to the rules the whole church has the say so and our say so is in the bylaws that's what everybody voted in here back in 2015 and it has not been amended yet right the church is built upon the sovereignty of the local church therefore I have nothing to say in moving this pastor or poting putting one in even brother brandham couldn't remove brother brother Neville from brandham Tabernacle it's named after him why because of the bylaws the way the Holy Ghost LED them to set up the church structure a prophet cannot remove a Pastor the church has to remove the pastor I own the property brother said it's given to the church you all are the church you people are the one who control you're the church yourself and the church the Holy Church of God is the sovereignty of the holy spirit in that church and the only thing I do is own the property give it over to the church give it for a church it's a taxfree see he got he wrote off his taxes right he's giving on his taxes and the church elects their own pastors I've have nothing to do with it the only way this pastor could ever leave would be the pastor decide himself to go or the majority of the votes of the church would have to say change the pastor that's the only way so you're stuck with me but guess what I'm stuck with you too now I say that in a joke okay I'm glad I'm stuck with you Hallelujah no Deacon board can do it the Deacon board only keeps order and things in the church and I'm pastor and I'm Deacon board because we don't have brothers that meet the qualifications right but if there's any complaint against any member if that member has a complaint against one another or something wrong you're supposed to go to that brother yourself and talk to him you and him alone now remember suay I asked you to do something for me I hope somebody's done it by God's grace if they won't receive it then the next thing takes place you take one of the deacons or somebody go with you to that brother then if he won't receive you then you come tell it to the church then if the church then if he won't receive the church then the Bible said let them be as a heathen a Publican that's right and any person that knows a guilty person and you don't go and talk to them then you're part I'm sorry and then you're the part of the church is going to answer for that sin that's right if you see somebody in sin and you don't go to that person you're guilty for that right that's what that's what is you're you're we're a body if you had if you had a disease uh if you had an infection what kind of person would you be uh if you wouldn't take your right hand and and put that ointment on that infection what kind of person would you be you'd be an insane person you'd be hurting yourself you'd be ignoring your own body your own health that's what happens here if we don't take care of sin in our church we become an infected church so do do the part of the body help out your body Hallelujah right keep sin out of the church you must do it remember the pastor is going to either say Joy with this person or grief with this person persons right he says person any persons anybody and if anybody has to complain against a deacon or against a deacon or some of the church it takes three people he said come tell the past if there's a grievance against a deacon if there's a grievance against a deacon the Deacon isn't a just man a perfect man he must hold that office office blameless okay uh and then he talks about voting a deacon out now I'm going to move on therefore no one person has nothing to do with this it's the majority of the people yes sir if 20 votes for him and 21 votes against him he goes or vice versa now that's determined by the the bylaws ours is more than 51% it's 66% 2third because we had a small Church see that's the sovereignty of the local church then each one of the members has to say so anything goes wrong then they can come right around the only thing that they have to do is to be before God that there absolutely see that nothing hinders the moving of the church and if if someone is sitting in the church and it's hurting the atmosphere then it's your and my responsibility to make sure that that doesn't hinder us anymore but now but the full everybody say full and say complete ready complete authority of the church is the pastor because that's what the bishop is that's what the Elder is read that in the Bible see if we just read it see if that's not Bible order that's exactly right there's no one above the Elder I have nothing to do with brother Neville does here in 1957 he has nothing the prophet has nothing to do with the local Pastor that's up to you and brother Neville if brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine that's up to you and him see if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to that's between you and him that's all if the congregation votes for him in there to preach that that's all right that's up to him the only thing I do is just owning the property and if something another comes by it's like the moving the pastor they try to move the pastor out and they went to take a vote on that you couldn't ask a deacon to do that you come to me to ask that it come down and say if you want to move the pastor tell me why what has he done yes we called him drunk now here's what I was talking about earlier or we call him doing this or that have you got three Witnesses of it yes we have then Witnesses must first be tried so get all the details and make sure their story lines up with the other person try them ask them questions go to every detail if it's against a pastor or Deacon he says Deacon don't receive an accusation against an elder lest it by two or three witness and let them first be proved against an elder then you have to swear to you have to swear to God and church we don't want to lie to the Holy Ghost and prove it that you s it Hallelujah and then if you did then that sin is rebuked openly and it's wrong then say congregation do you want to change your pastor and if the congregation votes forgive him let's let let him go on yet that's the way it has to stand see that isn't that fair enough the way to run a church he say isn't that fair see that's what the Bible said we have no Bishops and overseers and Boards he's talking about denominational Bishops and overseers that moves this pastor in that that's what we see in denominations my wife and I they just move pastors all over wherever they want whatever the bishop says but that's not the Holy Ghost way to do it there's nobody got Authority here but the Holy Ghost that's right he does the moveing we take him as the majority of the people the way the people go and then if one side wants to do this the other wants to do that the then and the side wins now look at this the losing side what do they do about it they should join right in with the rest of them and say we were wrong then we'll go right on because the Holy Ghost has made the choice that's right now that's a real that would be a real Humble Church that would do that but most people can't give up their opinion right I shouldn't say most I'm sorry some people I'll would say most denominational churches I should say that they can't give up their own personal opinions and and ideas right because they got their own convictions but brother said if you were really right with God you'd go there because it's the Holy Ghost with the majority of the people in the Church Hallelujah he said like Democrats and Republicans oh boy as long as we stand as a democracy As Americans we're not a democracy we're Republic if the Democrats is in the Republicans should push right on with them Republicans in the Democrat push on see that's just exactly what makes us a nation whatever we break that we break our democracy that's right de Democrats say I ain't got nothing to do nothing Republicans was in then we fall I'm a Kentucky together we stand divided we fall now if there's anything wrong in the church that you ever know of some individual or some person or anything you are Duty bound and will answer before God if you don't clear that thing out you the church that's why I told you on Sunday you need to reach out everybody know what I'm talking about if not you're guilty of it Hallelujah you got to clear it out I've got to clear it out now remember it's not on my shoulders it's on yours it couldn't could be on it couldn't even be on a prophet's shoulders it had to be on the local Church's shoulders and anything wrong in the church God will make you answer for it that's right that's the way he runs his church that's the way it is in the Bible That's the order of the Bible remember he gives the example of Joshua the hidden sins right caus people to die brother says for us it'll be people won't get their prayers answered they won't get healed right they won't get blessings from God because there's sin that's discouraging the the church there's there's leaven amongst us and it hinders our faith and God can't move the way he wants to move he said that's the order of the Bible That's the sovereignty of the local church and the pastors ahead that's right amen well I can say Amen to that too Hallelujah now remember our bylaws were approved 10 years ago they never been updated because we never really had to by the grace of God and I'm like I said I'm very glad they're there I'm very glad we did that uh it's kind of protected me and protected us of course as a church now I just want to uh this is I'm going to give you quotes from our bylaws now look at Even in our bylaws we base these upon brandom Tabernacle any director now a director is a the pastor of the president is is for the legal the legal uh legal definitions the pastor is the president deacons trustees any director so any Deacon trustee can be removed by the president the pastor this is in our bylaws if his judgment would see it to the be the best interest and benefit of the corporation so in other words I can remove any other officer anytime I want because I'm the pastor right anything for any reason I want because I'm supposed to be led by the Holy Ghost only the church can remove me right by which is okay it's okay both ways it's okay we agree to it it's okay both ways right so the pastor has that Authority right just just like it should be just like in my home I should remove anyone trying to if if anybody tries to squat in my home I should be able to leave remove them right out of my house and get the trash out of my house CU it's my house I rule that house and so we so as the pastor rules the Church of God hallelujah I wouldn't let any other man come in and start eating from my fridge sleeping in my bed drive my car say no sir I guess what time to lay it throw it down now by God's grace my first fight and now look this is the only time now for our church this is more appropriate to our church but the the live streamers might get a a a help out of this for song for song leaders Sunday school teachers custodians and musicians they're not voted on they're assigned by the pastor now one time I did a voting when we had Brother Andy raber here John Graham brother amen myself because I wanted to see who the people thought was the most anointed or got them in the spirit right remember Brother Andy won that vote with no no no no wonder he's gifted but in our church the pastor assigns all these and they got to meet all the other requirements like pay ties like attend church Faithfully be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ married one time right now for our for our situation there's nothing in the bylaws about song service nothing the only thing is that I assigned the song the song leading that's my responsibility and I've got the full Authority in the congregation hallelujah it's not voted on by nope it's assigned by the pastor that's how we agreed on it and that's how it's going to stay as long as I'm here hallelujah Glory why because if not the devil can get in that's why we wrote it like that all those 10 years ago so and I like I said I'll give you a copy you can get it electronically and then do a word search search song and singing there's only one time it's in the entire bylaws song leaders I assign them the pastor assigns them Hallelujah now where do we get our our our song leader order it was from Brother bram's tapes remember he talked about Joshua chapter 6 when Israel marched around Jericho right you had H uh the word the word was last right and you had singing before that so brother said singing goes first then the word so we've just based it upon that right but that's not even in our our bylaws that's not even in it and you don't see that in the New Testament right now we see in the Old Testament we see enter into his gates with praise and thanksgiving right so we can see how you bring praise first but there's no other details right right and I'm open I'm open somebody show me any other song service requirements in the New Testament there's none so this is an area of Liberty written in the bylaws that it's up to the leadership of the Holy Ghost in the pastor Hallelujah everybody see that I'm open to correction but I already know I've searched the Bible read the Bible many times I should say many read enough times to know it's there's no song leading and song uh service requirements in the New Testament and now just remember this too a member is terminated from the assembly if they shall continually cause issue this is this was written 10 years ago within the assembly deemed intentionally if it's intentionally done by the president the pastor and the Deacon which I'm both reason for dismissal is fully documented in 1 Corinthians 5 and the appropriate actions uh Matthew 18:15 through 17 misconduct includes fornication idolatry railing that's evil words against people false accusations against people extortion unruly not keeping the rule of the church being Covetous sexually immoral false Doctrine and dividing people against others that's grounds to be terminated from the church right but you follow Matthew 18 which which we we've done this dismissal shall be in accordance to Matthew 18 okay it goes through all the the the four steps Y and if if repentance is refused there no longer seem to be a member of the assembly after that fourth and final step no longer and they can be terminated from the church Gathering that's the bylaws that's the rules that we wrote up by the Holy Ghost 10 years ago how many think we should follow the rules Hallelujah that's why we wrote them you got to have rules right and somebody's got a rule by the leadership of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now brother Jose shared with he was he and I were talking one time recently he said brother Jesse said you know I've always he said I've always liked how you lead songs at the end he said because that's how brother brandom did it and I was like that's right I forgot about that when brother Brandon was at his home Church there's 34 quotes where brother brandom is at the end he's done singing he's preached he sings all the songs he says something like this he's singing till we meet till we meet till we meet at Jesus feet God be with you till we meet again finally got the key there now said dad you're off the key I know I know I got a headache tonight but says let's bow our heads now while brother nephl Neville dismisses us in a word of prayer this happened many times probably 30 probably 30 of those 34 maybe maybe more when brother R's at the home church he preaches he sings all the songs and he says Pastor come on up and close us in a word of prayer the prophet and that and everybody was okay with that because it's the sovereignty the everybody can every church has its own Sovereign desires how they want to lead song service but I want you to see that brother Jose brother Jose said maybe some people aren't listening to the tapes so they wouldn't catch that and I said that's good brother they don't listen to brother brandham so they don't know brother BR ends the services at his home Church by being the song leader too and the church said been too long since some of us listened to brother bradam at his home church now at his home Church so again this shows the sovereignty of the church now in most message churches yes after the pastor's done he gets his Bible goes off and then the song leader comes up that's fine they're allowed to do that that's the liberty of your local church do whatever you feel led to do right and be happy with it just thank God for it but the main thing is to file the leadership of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and that's what I believe I've done by the grace of God for 18 years I keep reminding that because it gives me reminder about the years boy they go so fast man it's almost it's almost uh spring break time already it's almost summer time coming up here now here's what I also want to say too if someone is distracting US during a service then the Deacon has to remove that person from a service if someone's distracting in an evil manner then that person needs to be removed now this is when brother Ram got a trap I'm not going to read all this but remember he was trapped uh the holy spirit said Satan set a trap for you he said this this 25-year-old couple came in and the man while he's preaching they sit on the front row the man would just just reach over on his girlfriend and start kissing her brother R's like please don't do that please don't do that please don't do that and finally the holy spirit said say whatever you want he said I forgive you for that I don't know what happened after that because but the quote ends he doesn't say if like did the deacons take him out he said the deacons wouldn't take him out but it was God allowing him to be tested to see what he would do with his spoken word and he passed the test he said father forgive them see and I said young man don't do that you're you're attracting the attention while I'm preaching now preachers aren't selfish wanting the attention but we're trying to get your attention on the word of God because the word of God will set you free Hallelujah the word of God Will Supply your need for the for the current season you're in hallelujah amen so anything that distracts attention from the preaching or songs needs to be removed and he just laugh right out out at me look at the disrespect where's the double honor oh oh there it is there's the Trap right there I said don't do that sir no please don't do that while I'm preaching now here same one yeah he said I forgive your act I'm not going to read all that because it's too small I it's not necessary I just want you to see if something's distracting brother B will look down he'll stop the service and say stop doing that that's distracting please he'll say it a number of times and then brother BR said deacons need to lead out disorderly people from a service now that' be me if someone's disorderly openly disorderly and dishonoring and disrespectful the deacons got to remove that person from the service one time we had it when I first was a pastor and I failed it I remember I failed that remember that I'll just tell it brother Joe Adams was preaching over at the first church and Mr Bell's dad was there and brother ad brother Joe was preaching and Mr Bell uh shouted something and I was so afraid remember that hun and I was the Deacon and I didn't remove him and eventually the man calmed down but that's one time I did fail I was too afraid of Confrontation but not anymore by the grace of God I learned my lesson I failed enough I've had enough experiences where now now we can deal with it now the man cooled down and you know Joe ended up preaching a wonderful message but it's one time I feel like I wasn't quite prepared for it that devil to manifest right there during the service that was on uh I don't remember mow Drive if any unbeliever would happen to be here be disorderly now unbeliever or believer or believer a kindhearted person would go to them such as an usher or Deacon and would ask them that they would ask to be kept reverent or be reverent while the service is in order then if he keeps going on brother B says then the person should would should be led out to one side to one of the back rooms somewhere and be talked to and dealt with kindly he's talking about when gifts are operating people speaking in tongues prophesying waiting on the Lord Prayer if anybody's distracting from any of these things of course preaching as well that person needs to be escorted out Hallelujah and that's what the our our our bylaws say that too deacons have to remove anyone who's irreverent or disorderly and purposely causing confusion or disorder in the service they'll be removed I've never had to do it I should have did it once I missed it but if it happens again I'll do it by God's grace because now I'm studying on it preaching on it by the grace of God brother man said the Deacon's word is Law and Order to tell someone to leave now in 1963 the deacons were kind of fed up at Brenham Tabernacle because they were losing control people W people weren't respecting them they said is there any better way to keep ordering the church that to remind people with a repeat from the deacons now occasionally he says now I think the pastor he said or play this tape let this stand for witness deacons are policemen and their word is Law and Order so if I as a deacon ask someone to leave if they don't they're disrespecting the Deacon and I'm G to have to use physical Force now church just an hour and a half up the road a few years ago there was a church problem and one of the guys wrote out a pamphlet and he said the Pastor I'm not going to name the pastor I'll tell you after service if you want to know and he stood uh first he was in the church passing out pamphlets that this pastor is a false Pro false Pastor the deacons had to physically move him out and then he stopped coming but then one day he showed up right outside right outside the front door passing out the tracks again and they the deacons had to stand there and keep him from getting in he would yell there this is just an hour and a half up the road message message church so I say like this we've had it easy compared to some churches we're just coming through our training Seasons I think here by God's grace but preachers have to do all the time people will get such an evil spirit on them they'll start just publicly trying to disrespect the the service or stand outside and pass out things and well now I'd be passing out text or something like that right but people have to do that there's one there was even a messaged man not long ago was stalking a messaged girl and this pastor had to call the cops to get a restraining order on them and they prayed they fasted they did all these things sometimes the law has to intervene he says the the deacons have the authority from the church and even from the laws of the nation to make that house of God the right place so if I had to call the cops on somebody being disrespectful i' do it but first I'd use phys physical Force that's what I do first because there any anyone disrespectful or dishonorable publicly doing it to dishonor and show disrespect they need to be removed from the service because it's hindering the service we're not here for disrespect we're here to honor the Lord Jesus Christ we're not here to disagree all those meetings go out there Jesus said go one go alone then take two or three if they don't tell it to the church and then the church goes to tell the person all those arguments go out there there's my hour I got it closer and anyone contrary to a deacon like that is subject to now he talks about there might be federal crimes I don't know I didn't look that up I should call the police officers if you tell them and they don't do it or something like that somebody with disorderly conduct he just don't know what he's getting into he's he's subjecting himself allotting himself to all kinds of findes in anything okay well that's perfect I think yep that's my let's stand to our feet and I got a couple more things to say God bless the live streamers here hallelujah
