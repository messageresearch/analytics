TRANSCRIPT
========================================
six God bless the live streamers trust the Lord will minister to you tonight by God's grace Hallelujah I'll read four and five then we can uh read verse together by God's grace this is a more scriptural picture as far as I understand the Bible never says the lion will lie down with the lamb the Bible says the wolf shall lie down with the lamb but we know the lion is in the next uh phrase there in the scripture so it's possible the lion will lie down with the lamb I don't see why not but just want to be more scriptural by God's grace am Hallelujah verse four and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them brother tells us that's the bride p and present amen and if the Lord carries future hallelujah amen hallelujah and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus like St Paul and for the word of God the Old Testament Saints and which had not worshiped the Beast that and I right there amen we will not bow down to this world beast system amen you see was it last week that our president and the pope were rubbing foreheads did you see that last week yeah they're out there big meetings rubbing heads and and putting the I guess it's all the one mind of the Beast putting all their minds together with the the Beast mind that's fine I'm not going to rub my head with a PO Beast system Hallelujah I already got Jesus Christ in my forhead Hallelujah I got the Seal of God in my forehead hallelujah thank God so that's you and I church we not worship the Beast neither his image right that's the World Council Churches United churches neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads we won't accept the Trinity Doctrine amen right and all the false doctrines or in our hands we won't do the works of the world church and they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years Hallelujah so it's not just living it's actually having Dominion amen verse 5 but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished that's we'd say the foolish Virgin uh that' be the uh make believer and the unbeliever do not live for a thousand years this is the first resurrection so the saints that rise and are raptured that's the first first resurrection they live from the Rapture through the Millennium that's the first resurrection let's read verse six together ready 1 2 3 blessed and holy is he that have part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a th000 years amen let's have one more word of prayer I don't see

stay strong Hallelujah we bring forth fruit in every season father so father we love you and bless us here tonight in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I realized you know last week I uh when I preached on Millennium at my house you know um I realized I didn't really finish it so I went and studied there today of course I want to preach on the seven dimensions uh maybe Sunday by God's grace and uh if our live streamers uh I wasn't able to live stream that on Sunday night I didn't feel like I want to live stream it because we have a lot of uh uh questions from the the youth and I don't like to put their names out there on the internet and so forth I try not to by God's grace um anyways uh I I believe there's actually only two Dimensions I don't believe there's seven dimensions there's only two existences right you either you're either existing here in the natural world or you're existing in the spir spiritual world there's only two existences right uh but uh God's word is true Hallelujah amen and we're not going to disfellowship based on something small like that Hallelujah but God's word is true amen we're thankful for that so we looked at our text here and remember just two disclaimers about the Millennium uh brother R said it's hard for him to understand and he said he didn't have all the answers on it and of course there's no thus sayth the Lord on this subject and so you'll hear in 64 questions and answers brother R say there's no sin in the Millennium right he'll say that but then he'll say there's sin before and sin after now if I use the same scriptures he used to teach it then there does say there is sin in the Millennium amen so I personally believe there is and if someone don't agree with me that's fine it doesn't really matter anyway let's just get to the Millennium praise God and the way we do that is love one another Hallelujah brother said only Divine love will make it over there hallelujah amen so if I'm wrong you and your love just love me into being right Hallelujah if I'm wrong just love me until I know I'm right Hallelujah and I can join your group on the Millennium or whatever topic people want to uh you know maybe dissociate on you know by God's grace but uh you know I can only preach it as I can see it you know by God's grace so again I just want to read this you know brother talk he's talking about marriage and divorce and I hope this is true brother remember if you got the wrong person you'll get the right one in the Millennium you just keep on going all wrongs will be made right there so here you know I'd like to study this this is an interesting thought now the way to study this would be look at permissive will of God when did certain Saints get out of the permissive will of God but then God brought them back in amen so I can think of people like Jonah I can think of people like Hezekiah that purposely got in the by their own choice I mean in the permissive will of God and if they made mistakes in that realm God would make it right in the Millennium so I can't think of any right now off the bat I'm sure my wife will be thinking real deep on that you know by God's grace and we can have some good conversations about that and if you have one question about that bring it Sunday night by God's grace but I just love it I love how brother says everything will be made right in the millennium why because it's God's seventh day yes it's God's day of rest and it's the honeymoon for the husband and the wife amen Christ and the church hallelujah it's that Divine honeymoon where where the husband and wife reain for a thousand years amen oh it's going to be a grand time Hallelujah now if you got your Bibles I guess you know don't have to really turn to them here tonight because I got them up here on the screen for you I figured out how to switch over aren't you glad for technology M it was so easy I kind of kicked myself from not doing it sooner but uh What uh what I can't do everything you know so let's look at some more Millennium verses you know um I found some more by God's grace and at the end I want to just make some proofs that we're not in the Millennium I have five proofs that we're clearly not in the Millennium of course there's way more right but I can just clearly show five you know we used to have a brother named Loris who went to our church here God bless brother Loris but his mom believed we were living in the Millennium W uh while her whole life she believed we're in the Millennium and so brother Loris brought that question to me and I went and studied it that's why I preached this back in 2016 I said brother I said you know nothing against your dear mother but here's the reasons I don't believe we're in the Millennium we haven't walked on the ashes of the wicked amen uh Satan's still around here all all the time amen I fight him and his demons every day yes sir so I know we're not in the Millennium because in the Millennium you won't see them amen right we see Satan all over these politicians we see Satan all over these uh oh my these sodomites you know you just you start naming them you know all the sins so is clearly here he's not the bottomless pit so uh there's so many proofs but you know uh not not to not to be disagreeable but just just to be kind and and stand where we believe we must stand Hallelujah and to recognize we're not the Millennium brother says it plainly of course but you know uh uh Psalm 22 I just love this about God God hides these things all throughout the Old Testament that's why the Bible said when you teach something it's got to be line upon line here a little there a little amen right jar here's a little Jeremiah 3 here's a little more in Psalm 22 amen there's a little bit more in Isaiah 65 amen Isaiah 2 Isaiah 11 Hallelujah here a little there a little amen but the same Holy Spirit finds all these different portions and puts it together for one thought Hallelujah and then you can like brother said it's like a puzzle amen he said if you're not careful these denominational preachers put the puzzle together they got the cow on top of the tree yes amen he said but we need the cow on the ground amen we need the pzz plac right together Hallelujah that we can see the whole plan of God Amen that's why God said brother R to finish the mystery of God so we can see what God is doing in this hour amen by so here we again see all the ends of the world shall remember and turn into the Lord so this see denominational use this and they say see there's going to be a big time Revival the whole world they think we're going to turn the whole world to Christ before the Rapture that's where they're wrong amen see but see how they miss see how they misplace it right there said don't misapply it don't misinterpret and don't misplace it yes sir Hallelujah so see they misplace it it gives them a false hope yes and it causes them actually to compromise because they think by compromising and joining up with the Pope they think that's fulfilling that but it's not amen it's actually fulfilling the other side the fall of the mother Harlot church amen and the daughters amen Amen brother or Jesus said I'm going to cast the children in with the mother yes sir they're uniting they're going back it's the uh the the iron and the clay and the feet amen right of the beast in Daniel chapter 2 it's that uniting together Hallelujah but we're not a part of that amen amen hallelujah glory to God and all the kinds of the Nations shall worship before thee there's going to come a time when all the world worships Christ amen but it ain't now amen the next thing they're going to worship is the Antichrist yes right they're all going to worship the Antichrist they're going to worship the image of the Beast right the the the church system and then the Antichrist is going to raise up and solve all those problems we preach on right we have to go back and preach that to refresh you I like to be a little refreshed on that too by God's grace verse 28 for the kingdom is the Lord's and he's the governor among the Nations oh what a governor amen hallelujah we tried to vote this current governor out but we missed it but they're not going to be able to vote Jesus out Hallelujah because God ordained him there amen hallelujah so see friends this hasn't happened yet so these just scatter look like to us they're just like scattered oh like a sewer amen sewing the word of God he just sews it out there and there's all these scriptures on different thoughts all scattered out but it takes the Holy Spirit to put them together amen that ought to prove to you as another proof that God sent brother ROM to restore the Bible amen oh it's undeniable like I told those uh the people that are against brother Bram the accusers I said if if William Bram didn't fulfill Revelation 10:7 then who did that's right amen who did right cuz it can't be a Heavenly angel it's got to be a man amen now you start naming people I'll show you how they were off the word and none of them gave thus sayith the Lord Brother come around and he told us what it was and then he said that's thus say the Lord yes sir and all of our major doctrines go right back to the Bible it proves God is in this message Hallelujah he's restoring Hallelujah glory to God he's restoring he's finished the mystery now we're eating the book and prophesying again amen hallelujah I love to prophesy again share the prophecies God gave us amen mhm you probably remember this one for us this a Christmas verse we'd say right the child is born a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder now of course that's speaking of Millennium too I could put that one up there too and his name should be called wonderful isn't he wonderful to you amen counselor is he your counselor is he the Mighty God the everlas the Everlasting Father the Son is the father Yes these two are one Hallelujah not three not not these three are three persons these three manifestations are one Hallelujah said the good word is a offes these three offices are one the Prince of Peace So if you need peace just go to Jesus tonight amen of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end so his kingdom just keeps expanding amen so again the denomination of churches will say well this is a Revival in America sorry it's not it's for the Millennium amen he said upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord will perform this amen God's jealousy right it's a holy jealousy amen God's jealousy for his bride to rule amen amen he wants his bride ruling on this Earth amen his jealousy for his bride to be treated the right way and to reign with him his jealousy will accomplish this amen hallelujah talk about the favor of God hallelujah again this hasn't happened but now we see Jesus connected to ruling on the throne of David amen remember he got this prophecy uh right before he was born it was told to his mother Mary and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus Jehovah is our Salvation he shall be great he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David Hallelujah and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever right they rejected him when he was here first but you and I received him amen to them that received him he gave power to become the sons of God hallelujah thank you Lord and of his kingdom there shall be no end hallelujah amen he was promised as Throne of David and remember Satan tried to give it to him early but Jesus was smarter than that oh he can't the devil can't deceive this one Hallelujah he could trick all the other ones but he couldn't trick Jesus Hallelujah CU he was the word amen amen see that's how God helps us to overcome that's why we can't be deceived because because we're a part of the word amen Cam and I were talking today and we're just like we're so thankful you know we see all these people falling we see all these churches getting false Doctrine but we said brother C said thank God that the elect cannot be deceived thank God that we cannot be deceived into sin and debauchery and and falling away and and going and taking Le I'm going to preach on Le pretty soon by God's grace we won't take any Le in the church Hallelujah the Holy Ghost cleans out the Le cuz we keep asking him to clean it out amen hallelujah oh it's glorious remember this a picture here now remember I preached this a few years ago this is not set in stone because what I mean is even in Jesus Earthly Ministry he was called Son of God and Son of David he even called himself the Son of God during his Earthly Ministry but it's it's just a a simple it's like a framework just to understand that he has at least three forms or sorry three offices again yes sir he's son of man Prophet Son of God high priest in heaven and Son of David ruling during the hallelujah amen and giving you a crown giving you Dominion giving you cities to re over amen that's right so on Earth he was the prophet right that's the Rich Young Ruler heimr Hoffman painted that around late 1800s beautiful picture that's that's that's the closest thing I've ever seen to what I saw Jesus Christ in a vision twice amen said that's the closest I've seen now here's where we have the great Revelation here right now the body of Jesus Christ is in the holiest of holies making intercession for us the Bible says that Hebrews 10 amen and brother said there's got to be blood somewhere up there in heaven amen so somehow God's got physical blood of Jesus in a spiritual Heavenly Holly of holies amen now wrap your brain around that try to explain that to me but brother said there has to be a blood that's there for a sin offer amen hallelujah else we can't be saved amen there's got to be Blood Of The Mercy Seat thank God there's blood on The Mercy Seat tonight there's Mercy for us tonight see brother your lick of fire makes me preach like this you know the people do it too but you know one more lick of fire look what it does I just get all excited you know I told Cam I said I'm ready to preach after talking to cam like we're talking about the scripture yes sir we're quoting scriptures back to each other I said brother I'm ready to preach tonight thank you the Lord they won't know what hit them Hallelujah I'm just joking I'm just really joyful amen but here here where you see it now in the Millennium we got all set up Jesus sits in the holiest of holies and there's no Veil there's no separation between him and the people but let me tell you now there's no separation between Christ and us right now amen that's right in other words God hears your prayers yes sir nothing's keeping you out of his presence just say forgive me and then come into His presence and the Bible said come boldly Hallelujah now this reminds me let me see can I put that picture I I I hung that picture up in I held that picture up in front of you guys last last week let me see if I can just put it up there uh about ezekiel's Temple or there's so much Revelation in the Bible my goodness so that's better right that's bigger than what I did last Wednesday right that's biger so the prophet Ezekiel was shown a vision of the Third Temple 572 BC just years after the first temple was destroyed and before the second temple was built though the destruction of the second temple occurred in 70 AD the Third Temple has not yet been constructed so look at this here we have a chamber for the priests we have the Western end more chambers of the priests now Jesus there's the altar see remember the the the the nations of the earth will come in they'll have to sacrifice animals amen right there's an inner Court outer Court there's look at this River of Life amen there's a River of Life that flows Jeremiah Say I'm Sorry Ezekiel says it yes there's a river of life amen that flows right through the house of God oh you can get a drink of it tonight amen there's a River of Life Tonight Hallelujah you can get a real good drink of the Holy Ghost tonight give you stimulation of Revelation amen it'll give you Joy amen amen and remember the same thing is in the future home there's a river that runs out of the top of the mountain of God Amen see it's a prefigure to the Future home it's a third reset brother Austin caught that Revelation I said brother you caught something right there no is the first reset the Millennium will be the second reset and the New Jerusalem will be the third reset Perfection amen yeah brother Austin caught that said bro you're getting the spirit of Revelation now amen see you're doing the right thing sister you know what I'm talk about hallelujah amen so you got outer walls you got uh remember and I love it the Bible say whatever way they go in they can't go out the same way that's how we come to church amen you never leave the same way you came amen hallelujah praise God you come you come depressed you leave out joyful hallelujah amen in discouraged you leave out singing the Praises of God Amen you say come on Mom put on that song uh let's praise the Lord on my soul come on dad put on some good song there let's Worship the Lord hallelujah the priest kitchen I mean all this is laid out brother said any Bible reader knows the Ezekiel Temple is in Revelation I'm sorry Ezekiel 40 to 44 now it's actually 40 to 48 but any Bible reader knows that and now here here's American football field brother Mike look how many football fields will fit in that Temple almost 2 4 68 probably nine or 10 football fields and God will call them all to the Feast of Tabernacles the Bible says all the all the feasts God will Jesus will call them in and they'll come in worship Hallelujah and Jesus will sit right there he'll sit right in the holiest of holies how many believe that amen that's what the Bible says and look at look at the last words go to Ezekiel I don't have in my notes but I had it last week go to Ezekiel 48 the last chapter of Ezekiel Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel I've been looking at Lin's pictures boy he's quite an artist what a man he was my goodness for a Baptist I tell you he that's amazing Revelation for a Baptist but that's right that was the man age so he had the he had the anointing for the man age what an artist my look at the last verse verse 35 Ezekiel 48:35 it was round about 18,000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is is here amen oh that's what that's what the name is the Lord is here hallelujah amen oh isn't Jehovah sh the Lord is with us hallelujah so be very similar to that very similar to Jehovah sh amen what do you call that house Jehovah sh amen God is here amen hallelujah and what did I told this to brother Rod I was standing by Charles finny's grave last week brother what a man of God he was amen hallelujah still got the denominations of his day and he blasted it he still like a gallant Soldier Hallelujah of the Cross but John Wesley's last words were the best part is the Lord is with us hallelujah and then he said it one more time before he died took one more breath he said the best part is the Lord is with us and then he his soul went to his Heavenly reward hallelujah hallelujah and he said the best thing is the Lord is with us but in the Millennium everybody will say the Lord is there Hallelujah the Corporal body is there hallelujah amen so now we got got a good understanding of it now there's the size of the future home we'll get to that later that's not a really guess I guess the the angle if you measured out uh 1,500 miles that's how big the future home is right it's just a little bit short of that and then of course that's what the future home looks like but remember there's no more seat so the artist got it I mean these could be Lakes I mean I don't know God has a different way to define it and that's about the size where it will be present day that's where the future home now not the Millennium the future home now the mill IAL Temple will be right there too we're going to get that the millennial Temple will be right smacked there right in Jerusalem by God's grace that's God's holy mountain we got to sing that at the End Amen Hallelujah great is the Lord and greatly to be praised Z want to seek that the other day is he still awake amen hallelujah stay awake buddy we're going to sing great is the Lord and greatly to be praised okay amen I want to see you worshiping yes sir all right amen that's right and there's that beautiful picture the Lin man look at this guy what a man of God Amen Jasper you know you got Gad Reuben Simeon the gates jasper stone brother Mike one of these houses probably in the bottom of corner that's probably where I'm going to live right there I'm the I'll be the least of all this all the right that's that's how we always want to paint ourselves maybe I live in the alley down there my wife and them they all have a nice house I'm probably live in that alley down there God gra uh but you know there's the River of Life amen it flows out from the Throne of God hallelujah amen amen glory hallelujah oh The Best Is Yet To Come we haven't seen nothing yet Hallelujah all the blessings all the glory of the word of God the presence of God the the Miracles of God we haven't seen nothing yet hallelujah it's only going to get greater as time goes on hallelujah amen all right now I'm going back because I skipped ahead because I didn't get to show those last week I'm going to skip ahead to where I am this week okay read that all right here we go Saints and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed amen and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these other kingdoms right Rome yes sir and all the kingdoms of this world Russia China America and it shall stand forever amen for as much as thou sawest now I'm not going to read that because this is of course Jesus as the stone at Armageddon coming down and he defeats the uh the image right the the demon powers right of Rome Hallelujah I love this I love what told D Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar the interpretation therefore is sure amen but Peter said we've got a more sure word of Prophecy Hallelujah in other words it becomes a moreal reality we're closer to this being fulfilled Hallelujah Peter's like we're more we got a more sure word because we saw Jesus I've seen him with my own eyes Hallelujah I've seen him with prophetic eyes I've seen him in a trans Hallelujah that's what he saw Mount Transfiguration Jesus said tell this Vision to no man oh there's the blending in of the other dimension hallelujah praise God that Dimension Blends in and Peter James and John they see a vision up on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah talking to Jesus hallelujah amen Moses represented the dead in Christ but you represent Elijah if we live to the coming if we live to the Rapture amen cuz Elijah never died hallelujah amen he he got to go to heaven without dying he represents those that are alive and remain that are caught up to meet the Lord in the air anybody remember Simon preaching that did he teach that here I thought he preached about Transfiguration while I was out okay remember that Moses represents the dead in Christ Elijah represents us if we live to see it and we're raptured up amen amen right Jesus is Jesus hallelujah amen our husband amen now this is quite a scripture I saw the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before now this is Jesus after he resurrected right and this is him coming to the throne of God so here we see son coming to the father amen that shouldn't stumble anybody because God's so great you can't even contain him amen no wonder he's called the Ancient of Days he never had the first day to start hallelujah amen right and the Bible said the father's invisible GL amen so the the visible son uh is who's the image of God comes to the invisible God amen amen Hallelujah that shouldn't but see trinitarian oh there's two persons well show me where the Bible ever says there's two persons it doesn't say that amen hallelujah one's God is invisible right and his son is visible hallelujah amen amen and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people there it is again all people see you got to see these same words all the time all nations all people languages should serve him see they're not doing it right now amen serving Jesus no no his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed amen now now I I don't want to get into this but if you just if you read early in the chapter the Bible says the ancient of days has has white hair like white wool and eyes like fire well that's Christ right so what we see we see God changing his Mas amen the Bible said he Chang changes his form Philippians 2:6 says he became in the form of a servant amen and that means you change your external appearance right so that's what God does all the time he goes from a pillar of fire right children remember the mass lessons we did a couple years ago yes sir he takes the pillar of fire he takes that mask on he puts on the body of Jesus amen he took that mask off he put on nezic right you can you can keep changing all the mask well here Ancient of Days takes off that mask amen amen amen he's changing his appearance but it's the same person person behind the mask hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory here's a new one maybe you haven't seen this one lately but the Saints I love this of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever that's a thousand years amen until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high there it is who is Judgment given to you amen if you can judge the situations now amen that's why it's so important where your home church is amen and how you treat people yes Cam was telling me you know where they live some not not not not everybody but some people they jump from one Church to get one problem they jump to the other church that's a that's a nice part we don't have many churches close to here because somebody don't agree with me it's hard for them to jump to another church and it's usually something very small yes sir right because by God's grace I've live blameless before the people amen hallelujah that's what the Bible said a pastor has to be blameless amen before the people but see that other places you know where there's lots of churches they can jump around and brother say you'll take your sin from that church to the next Church how many times have we seen it m in fact what's interesting sometimes they they jump around so much that they all go to the same church and then you got lots of problems in that church and a lot of false Doctrine amen that's right y but see if they can't judge these small little matters how are they going to judge the real matters amen they're not brother brother said if you don't catch in these little things he said the Rapture is going to go right over your head you're going to miss it you can't catch you the simple things of the Gospel amen right remember we had that verse Paul said it it should be you should have such a sphere of the Holy Ghost that even the least of the church members could judge something right amen that's probably the children yes even children if they got the Holy Ghost can judge a dispute between people amen right he said if you can't judge those you won't judge over there amen see why we got to be able to have the spirit of judgment hallelujah amen amen oh I love it but the Saints are given the kingdom hallelujah amen the holy ones that's what the Hebrew word means the holy ones are given the kingdom oh verse 27 and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions Shall Serve and Obey him that's that hasn't happened yet it's not happening now it's going to happen in the Millennium hallelujah amen oh church I'll tell you what I just want to be a saint amen if all these promises are to the Saints God I just want to be one of them amen I don't care if I'm the least of them I just want to be a Holy One Hallelujah yes I just want to be separated amen amen like like brother said if you're least in the kingdom of God he said then you still got every demon under your feet because if you're the least in the Kingdom of the body of Christ and you're the feet amen but if you're in the body you're still above every demon power amen like Paul told those Romans Satan will be bruised shortly under your feet hallelujah amen now notice Church look at all these verses I'm showing you tonight they all say the same thing that's what brother R said every Doctrine must be based on the word of God it not just one place but from Genesis to Revelation it must say the same thing yeah see that's why these last two weeks I've showed you these scriptures from the Old Testament they all say the same thing amen all the nations flowing in making sacrifices you know infants and children and and wolves and lambs and sacrifices and and being taught the word of God in Jerusalem and everything it's all saying the same thing hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost is not a liar the Holy Ghost does not contradicting himself the Holy Ghost guides us into all truth hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord Glory this is a brand new one I forgot this one and saviors now don't go around calling yourself a savior but the Bible calls you a savior amen the savior is what are Defenders amen the deliverers The Rescuers see we got to rescue somebody amen shall come up on Mount Zion is he still awake yes to judge the mountain Mount of Esau so where Esau lived in that time they had a mountain right and so God said hey look there's two mountains but the Believers of God's Mountain are going to judge all other mountains amen hallelujah and the kingdom shall be the Lords now here if you have I haven't seen this for a while wait I'm going to get to it yeah I'll get to a little bit here habac 21:14 it's been M it's been 2018 since I preach that or was it 2020 off for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of God that hasn't happened yet no as the waters cover the sea anybody been to the ocean lately look at all the waters out there it's all Waters amen it's Waters as far as you can see that's how the Millennium is going to be amen it's the word of God As far you can see hallelujah hallelujah oh maybe I'll look across the valley and I'll see you brother amen there's brother Mike he's reigning over that territory by God's grace I see the I see the Servants of God I see the deliverers The Rescuers I see the those Saints with Dominion I see them ruling over the whole earth hallelujah amen remember before you call just talk to me brother I already have the answer amen before we call to Jesus we'll already have the answer amen that's the promise to the believer hallelujah amen no wonder the Bible said the half has not been told brother amen so remember this this was okay I'm sorry 2021 this was three years ago anybody remember this series when I preached on Mountain so right now if you went to Israel right here on Mount Mariah would be where the Dome of the Rock is that Shrine for the Muslims I'm going to show the picture a little bit but Mount Zion is further west it's it's only a few feet higher you know elevation right now but the Bible said it's going to raise up God's going to raise up a mountain out of the mountain that's in Isaiah chapter 2 probably don't remember that this guy to preach it a long time ago but see you have Mount Mariah that's where Christ is crucified amen then you have Mount Zion it's a higher Mountain yes sir and this is the mountain we've been singing about amen why is that a special Mountain because Jesus is going to come back and stand on that mountain amen and 144,000 Holy Ghost Saints are going to get the Holy Ghost there amen Israeli Saints on that mountain amen no wonder my mom felt so good when she went to Israel praise God your mom did too H because that everyone knows Jesus is coming back there amen he's coming back Hallelujah just like he said amen amen yeah the Mount of ol the kid Valley Mount Mariah Mount Zion so there's the elevation so see uh Mariah is where they're going to rebuild the Temple it's 2400 Mount Zion's 2500 this about 100 ft higher wow they said olives is tall that that's just for now right that's just for now it's going to raise up later Isaiah 2 says it so so see if you're looking from this is from the East looking West this is not the right angle I'll show you later but here's Mount olives this is highest the highest point right there's the valley and there's the shrine now that that's where uh that's where uh Solomon's Temple used to be right in here right now Zion's up here right so you have mount you have Mount Mariah you have Mount Zion and here you have Mount of oliv that's the modern day view of it if you went there right and this is and this is where they think you know that's going to have to be broken down according to Revelation 11 they think and Israel's going to have to build their third Temple there yeah so here's if you're looking at it again the same direction here's Mount Mariah right where Christ was crucified and here's Mount Zion but if you turn it North uh if you're looking at from the north you have Mount Mari on this side and here's Mount Zion if you're look at just at a map so if you're looking at a map this is what it would look like to you see CU there there's North up there north south east west okay so Mount Zion the Bible said they'll remember in habach they'll flow into Zion amen they'll flow in and worship God on Zion amen hallelujah and there's a there's a a picture comparison so that's that that's Mount Mari where the Dome of the Rock is that's where we believe Israel is going to build their third Temple but Mount Zion is where Jesus comes back in this place mhm Jesus comes back he's going to stand over there see you can fit about 144,000 people there by God's grace hallelujah amen where does it say that Revelation 14:1 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having their father's name written their foreheads we just come out of Father's Day amen and your father's name is going to be in your forehead Hallelujah who's your daddy the Lord God is my dad Hallelujah he's your father amen you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world he's literally coming to that mountain amen hallelujah now just to just so you might have heard this before I might have even preached this before but there's one quote where brother said the heathens that never heard the gospel will be raised up during the Millennium now I personally don't agree with this anymore and I'll show you why but it's still a possibility because I'm not God Amen but there's a quote just so you know it's from 1962 questions and answers and the he that that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time talking about the millennium and the sons of God will be manifested if he's to Reign he's got to have something to Reign Over he's got a domain and they rule to reign with Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of iron with the Nations then the gospel the Manifest the sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here there will come the Millennium in that Reign upon the ashes of the wicked amen hallelujah amen that's why I've said you know think I've said over the years maybe God will raise up uh all those babies that were aborted and give them a chance I don't know right their souls are somewhere we know that right David's son that passed away he said I'm going to him amen that would be the sixth Dimension now that time would have been Paradise in the heart of the Earth but now it's in heaven amen right yes sir now here's why I don't believe it'll be the heathens that never heard because Hebrews 9:27 says it's pointed unto men once to die then the Judgment amen and then you that that's one witness now you got two witnesses down here remember these verses say all men are without excuse on the day of judgment yes sir so people got chance to hear and they got a chance to have uh uh what do they call the age of accountability which is not in the Bible but we understand it's a Bible principle amen if they got to that and they they failed to receive it then there's no excuses amen right all right so see I don't believe that the the people that lived and died will be raised up to live again I I believe it'll be just uh uh it'll be The Offspring of the people that survived during the battle of Armageddon that's it amen that's what Zechariah 14 say too brother we went last week if you're interested U Zechariah 14 that blew my mind I'm like wow that's been laying there all those years and I sir it just proves there's a time and season for everything amen there's a time and season for every Revelation hallelujah amen all right now um just I want to show this again here so the children know this especially and adults if you if you don't know this brother bam said that today is not the Lord's day that's right it's not Saturday or Sunday that's right he said today is certainly not the Lord's day this is man's day it's man's doing man's work man's Church man's idea of worship man's everything for it's man's world Cosmos but the day of the Lord is coming yes it is it's just that at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to that great day that's coming the Lord's day was when the days of man are over amen so it has to be after Armageddon amen and then that would be the start of the millennial amen right the day of the Lord and a day with the Lord is a thousand years with man yes amen right so we can see it the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God Amen oh Jesus ruling every Kingdom oh what a day that's going to be amen the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall and after that comes the Millennium right the judgments of the sword coming out of his mouth right yes destroying all the nations that come against him remember and remember the Bible say they're going to bury dead bodies uh for seven months amen that's the the Gaga Magog Russia and the the Kings of the East China amen America's already going to be destroyed during tribulation amen and then the Bible said they're going to burn the weapons for seven years all the tanks planes guns seven years to burn all that he says right now the world does what it wants to with the Christian but remember God allows it amen nothing can happen to you except God allowed it amen we can take comfort in that they call all the Christian all manner of evil names making fun of him but Church they ain't going to make fun Us in the amen hallelujah nobody's going to make fun of us in the amen there's coming a great and notable day when they they will wail and how for the lamb is coming in Wrath to judge the world and then after he judges it remember the righteous will walk on the ashes of the wicked into the Millennium amen glory so I i' I've preached out over the years it's been uh eight years since I preached that so I wanted to preach it again so you remember the day of the Lord is when man's Days Are Over amen immediately after AR yeah immediately after armagan the day of the Lord starts amen Thousand Years the day of the Lord 1,000 years remember here I'll just put that there everybody see that day of the Lord now you got it you got your first resurrection the Rapture you got the seven-year tribulation Armageddon remember all the woes in there I think the sisters asked about that got the woes in there in the tribulation you got the vials you got the plagues you got the trumpets to Israel you got the armag again you got the day of the Lord the Millennium you got the Battle of God Magog Satan's I stand he's tossing the Lake of Fire white Throne judgment and then you got the new Heavens the new Earth all right everybody got that amen amen now remember the Millennium is the seventh day okay so day one of human history day one 2 3 4 5 6,000 years so the the seventh day is a seventh time a seventh period of 10,000 years amen hallelujah it's also Sor then the new Earth in Jerusalem is the Eighth Day or the first day all over again amen right cuz the week is set up as seven days what's the eighth day it's the first day all over again amen it represents eternity an unending cycle Hallelujah and then remember brother said God does something great every 2,000 years so here was the flood here was Jesus blood and here will be fire to get ready for the Millennium praise God amen amen every 2,000 years so anybody remember that anybody remember that visual over the years anybody remember that you got it now by God's grace and and those seven those six I'm sorry those 7,000 years were also prefigured by the seven feasts of Israel amen Passover unleavened bread first fruits weeks trumpets atonement Tabernacles Hallelujah so when we're living during the Millennium it's actually the literal fulfillment of the Feast of Tabernacles amen we're going to build houses and we're going to live in them hallelujah amen and no no one nobody else will haveit them we will haveit them ourselves amen like the Feast of Booth I'm sorry yeah the Feast of booths Hallelujah Feast of Tabernacles yes sir Hallelujah we'll set up the house we'll live in it hallelujah amen nobody will take it over from us no sir won't have to sell there'll be no interest rates during those times Hallelujah there be no taxes hallelujah amen now I want to bring this in too because some people say uh you know that word the bride age now brother says the bride age five times and people have taken that and run with it yes and they'll say we're no longer in Le oysan Church AG we're living in leysia but we're not of Leo deia amen let me prove it to you brother man says it the church age ending and blacked out the bride is called have we already entered in the tribulation period no no no I just wish I had just had more time on that the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease right Leia goes into chaos the bride goes to glory amen the church age doesn't end until we leave amen amen hallelujah so don't let people tell you well the bride age is something different no Le see Church age is still going onen I just said it like this the bride age has been in every age amen the bride age is the bride that's got the Holy Ghost amen amen cuz if you got the Holy Ghost you're going to the Rapture Hallelujah right that's the only thing you need for the Rapture is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul Hallelujah and Jesus said when you get it you have power to be a witness amen that's why I told that I told Brother Mercy out there I told his young Brothers they want to get baptized and uh I said brother I said I to be baptized but then I had to get Sanctified then I had to get the Holy Ghost oh no I told that to Nia I told that to brother Nia I said brother Nia I I used to be afraid to go up there and preach and he's like used to be afraid to go up there and preach the way you shout and scream and clap and burst my eardrums I now he didn't say that I'm just joking I'm adding that myself as a joke but I said yes I used to be afraid but what it take it took power from on high yes sir when his power filled my soul then I knew I could do what he called me to do yes sir not can be a witness to aan hallelujah amen and wherever the Lord shall whe wherever the Lord Our God shall call me and wherever God shall call you you'll be a real witness hallelujah amen you can't do what God's called you to do until you're born again then you got power to do it hallelujah amen amen okay then okay I'm not going to read all that just for time sake now is that it did I get through that already yeah I think I wanted to let me how long have I been live streamers here oh 46 minutes yes okay that's fine yeah that's fine I I think I I do want to end a little early on this one by God's grace I didn't get a chance to go through all the old ones but we got plenty of quotes here to look at here my go guys so here I'm closing with this here now there's way more proofs we're not in the Millennium now but I want to go through five there's way more and and and most of them uh most of them on here are ones I've already preached but now think about all the verses I preached last Wednesday at my house and then all the verses I'm talking about from the Old Testament think about all those Old Testament verses and every one of those that says all nations and all these things and everybody will worship and everybody the the the glory of the Lord will will fill the Earth all those are proofs we not in the Millennium right right yes what about all those sacrifices Ezekiel wrote about all the animal sacrifices there's no animal sacrifices going on right now amen I'll just say this I I said brother Loris I felt sorry for your mom but she's wrong amen we're not in the Millennium now Hallelujah y I'm not I mean I rest a little bit during the summer but I don't get much rest other than that it's a time of rest when I'm in a perfect body say't no perfect body amen I wish it was five PR were not the Millennium now the wolf and lamb do not lay down together in peace now see you could you could go with a child does not lead a snake remember the Bible said a child lead a ass that's not happening now amen so there's hundreds of reasons we're not in the Millennium amen I'm just giving you five there's hundreds right number two you and I have not walked on the ashes of the entire Wicked population amen that's been burned over with the sword that came out of jesus' mouth amen see how insane people would have to be to think we're in the Millennium I mean and no shade on brother uh L's M she probably just she probably don't study like I do or preachers do do MH right she she just don't study right if you study God can reveal something to you amen if you don't study God can't reveal things to you yes sir it's just that's just how it is and sometimes you got to wait decades I had to wait over a decade uh I had wait a decade brother to get the Revelation brother Ram said when the seals were broken the serpent seed was revealed and brother I was like yes I love brother brandom I love the Bible but I don't understand this for 10 years and all of a sudden I'm driving to church holding my wife's hand and it dropped down from heaven thank you Lord that's right the serpent seed is in Revelation 5 because the kins and Redeemer could only been virgin born amen there amen I just said Glory struck me I didn't shout that loud but I was like smiling I think that's right and it is right hallelujah amen it had to be a virgin birth amen the Virgin birth had to undo whatever happened in the garden amen yes that's right now I got that from another preacher that's not for me because I always want to cite my sources now Revelation 5 that was the lord gave that to me amen but whatever happened the garden It could only be undone by a virgin Hallelujah God Amen that's right these denominational people you ask you ask them ask a denomination person uh why did Jesus have to be born virgin birth they have no idea well they say well you know he had to be sinless well why why amen because sin came in the world through a an act amen that type of act amen right amen so the Virgin birth was the cure to the uh the sin that entered in in the garden Hallelujah sir amen that's right amen virginity was the solution to the corruption that happened in the garden and even Paul said it Paul said I'm so surprised that Corinthians you're so soon removed from the gospel as Eve was beguiled by The Serpent and lost her virginity I've espoused you as a virgin church but I'm so concerned your minds are corrupted like e virginity was corrupted amen hallelujah how how much PL could it be amen amen it's hiding in plain sight they say Amen howy in plain sight CU people are so blind thank God for the isow of the Holy GH cuz I would not have seen it either unless God put that I out on me Hallelujah that grease amen amen Satan's still here on the Earth right but during the Millennium he's in the bottomless pit the Millennium is complete peace now we know there's now we as we read some scripture um that means there's no Wars the Bible said they'll learn not to War and the Bible said they'll turn all their weapons into like hoes and rakes and all kinds of uh garden garden uh utensils or whatever more garden tools there is garden tools because Jesus is ruling as the son of David okay now see that so even I got to correct that one because the Bible says there are sinners let me pull that up there just so our viewers can see that uh because I know I might get criticized on the comments that's that's you know if you're too hot for the kitchen get out of the kitchen right if it's too hot for you get out of the kitchen I mean I can handle it um I got the Bible I know what I believe I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of what I preach amen I study I wait on God I've got a Bible verse I've got quotes too hallelujah amen Sinners so it must be sinner yeah it was right there brother brother even cited it yeah brother even read it Isaiah 65 sorry uh 20 for the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be a curse yes so when one of these uh people die from the Nations 100 years old is going to look like they're cursed now remember they can get the Bible said they'll get plagues brother and be punished if they don't come up and worship God Amen if they don't get to come to the the feast and Tabernacles God will instantly punish them amen I wish he did it now by God's grace but God's I guess God's God's very merciful right now amen okay so see look it's in the same context here I know God hides verses I I know I just preached on that too but in the context here Jerusalem is a joy Israel is not having Joy right now they're in war with Hamas they're getting attacked from the north right now from Iran they're not a joy this hasn't been fulfilled amen they's crying they still got hostages amen this hasn't happened yet but it's going to happen hallelujah it's thus sayi the lord it's going to happen Hallelujah see I got scripture to back it up Hallelujah now let me try to find where I was closing there okay so I got to fix a couple slides as you can tell I got to fix a couple there by God's grace let me uh I would just say there's no war on the earth during the Millennium Isaiah 65 let me just get 20 says there are sinners though yes yeah that's right that's right okay now I feel better okay I feel better the Bible said we would build houses as an antitype of the Feast of Tabernacles what houses have you built right I haven't built anyen and even people that build them well they usually pay somebody to do it yes there's only a small group of Carpenters that can actually say they built a whole house amen right it's a very small uh minority that's actually built houses the Bible said the Saints build them amen so if we're in the mnium now we haven't built a house yet well we must not be Saints but I'm a saint hallelujah amen I separated myself from the things of the world Amen I used to be in the world full go that's I was telling brother cam I said brother that's what Cam said Cam said we were so wretched we were like isn't amazing God has given the message to our family I said yes brother yes amen I was a wret I wasn't even looking for it God came looking for me Hallelujah God's goodness was running after me Hallelujah and look this I even showed I shared this with brother Lis when I preached this when brother Lis was here I said brother you can share this well his mom had already passed away so I said this is where I would differ with your mom brother the Millennium was someday to brother brandom it wasn't not now he said brother bud I hope someday in the Millennium I can walk all them mountains there he said' I hope I'm with you brother brandom you can be just just think just think it amen you can travel like a thought amen you can travel like philli hallelujah amen you can be translated amen right you can walk on you can walk with up the hill brother I'll walk with him down amen or we can all do together how about we do together Hallelujah I can walk the mountains up there and look we won't get tired brother amen hallelujah hallelujah a brand new body like under Jesus's glorious body amen amen all right oh this one I was going to share with Lydia Lydia uh she got a little she got a little criticized know we all when we're real Holy Ghost filled Saints don't we all get some criticism somebody criticized Lydia and said oh the rapture's he's already here I'm sorry that's not what brother taught this is two exactly 20 days before brother brother died on Christmas Eve right yes 20 days before he died he preached the sermon the Rapture said one day there'll come a blast From Heaven the dead in Christ will rise first I'm going to skip down what a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward some of these days in that rapturing time that lays ahead see he's not here amen this is simple things for us but Church a lot of churches are in some deep false Doctrine amen we're blessed amen by the Holy Ghost to correct us amen hallelujah all the crazy doctrines going around unbelievable and what I see amongst a lot of them is they also quench the Holy Ghost that's why I told Brother cam they preach all these so-called Revelations it's so deep and the people just sit there dead amen they don't hear them they don't sing and shout like you do hallelujah amen amen they don't dance around and have a Jericho March like we do amen they don't cry out the altar like I do and some of us do by God's grace they just stand there and say they're quenching the Holy Spirit you got to let the Holy Spirit anoint you praise God yes sir so you praise God like you ought to Hallelujah see those false doctrines they quench the Holy Spirit cuts off the flow of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost ain't flowing through nobody Ain it God help it to flow through me help it to flow through you Hallelujah don't quench it let it flow hallah other words worship God he inhabits the Praises of his people yes sir he lives in that hallelujah amen we don't want a dead stiff starchy Wallflower Church get into the worship say Amen or say hallelujah or worship God or raise your hands or do something Hallelujah do something to benefit our church hallelujah amen hallelujah like brother Gabe said so many years ago why is brother Jesse got this was a long time ago he said why brother Jesse got to do all these things yes this a long time ago when I was doing almost everything you know he's like uh he was saying uh everybody needs to find something do everybody needs to find their Ministry Hallelujah see that can go for every church right it goes for albian don't let brother Jim do everything amen you keep playing that flute brother amen amen find your gift and give it to God for his Glory Hallelujah other words brother Jesse can't do all the praying for the sick even that everybody can do something for the kingdom of God glory see the church will be proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ on their chests yes I'm proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Amen Hallelujah that's what he says in the Rapture the message of God in the hour that we lived in yes sir that's the hour that we're looking forward to brother see Christ isn't come yet we're looking it lays ahead amen and then brother Ram even rebuked Satan out of the audience so he wasn't chained up in the bottomless pit amen I don't have to read those but I I like to I like to read it just so you can see this is sometimes what you can do when you're praying even if I'm not here you can pray for people yes sir right you just come up and maybe they're on their knees you can say can I pray for you and if Satan's really giving them a mind battle you can say Satan you can't hold them Jesus Christ rebukes you amen that's what even Michael said Michael said Lucifer I rebuke you amen just rebuke him and he'll flee he might hang around for a few minutes but eventually he'll go amen can rebuke that Spirit come out of here Satan I challenge you in Jesus Christ's name that's what you don't want to hear in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah Satan he says you see the hands of these people laid upon each other you're a defeated being you cannot no longer hold these people I charge in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God you turn this people loose and come out of them come out of them sickness and affliction from these people now remember they had to repent or else he's not going to come out amen right amen I jure Thee in the name of Jesus Christ that you leave them then he says believe with all your heart
