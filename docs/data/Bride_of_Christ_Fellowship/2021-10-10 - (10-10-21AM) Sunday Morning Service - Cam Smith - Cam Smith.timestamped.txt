[10:05] and uh it's there's nothing like seeing
[10:09] a heart humble to god and receive his
[10:11] word amen

[10:16] and a blessing uh to be a part of the
[10:18] work of god in this hour amen
[10:20] and uh i trust last night you received
[10:23] psalm 65 verse 4.

[10:34] whom thou causest or who whom thou
[10:37] choosest
[10:38] and

[10:43] that he may dwell in thy courts all
[10:47] right so notice blessed is the man
[10:51] god first has to do what choose you
[10:56] and if he's chosen you
[10:58] he will want he will cause you
[11:03] why do you think you're sitting in the
[11:04] house of god today
[11:06] hallelujah
[11:08] someone has chosen you it's god himself
[11:12] and now he's causing you to approach
[11:15] unto him
[11:18] that he may dwell in thy courts now that
[11:20] dwell that means to live
[11:23] to stay in that place all right we shall

[12:14] your life there should be the fullness

[13:12] rising of the sun oh god upon this
[13:14] assembly today as we've gathered lord we
[13:17] just believe that your spirit will speak
[13:19] god get me out of the way get the church
[13:21] out of the way once more lord and lord
[13:23] we're just like samson in that approach

[13:42] we're asking that you just allow this
[13:44] laity to come forth in a perfect
[13:46] yielding unto you lord that they might
[13:48] stand o god in the position that you
[13:51] seen them in
[13:52] at the foundation of the world for the
[13:55] loving precious name of jesus christ we
[13:58] give all unto you and we ask your
[13:59] blessing upon it all in the name of
[14:01] jesus christ we say amen you may be
[14:03] seated
[14:11] this morning by god's grace we're going
[14:13] to bring another thought to you
[14:15] and we'll need the lord's help this
[14:17] morning
[14:18] to do these things but i'd like to
[14:21] just bring this idea the attributes of
[14:25] the holy presence okay
[14:27] the attributes of the holy presence and
[14:31] as we start off reading that scripture
[14:32] and psalms there uh chosen and called to
[14:36] approach amen
[14:38] so even to feel the pull of god god
[14:43] remember he first loved us he had to
[14:45] draw us right no man could come to the
[14:48] father lest god drew him amen so to even
[14:52] be able to hear the word amen we
[14:55] understand that it was god's desire to
[14:59] make something that when you heard that
[15:01] name of jesus you realize that that was
[15:04] more than just a name amen it was more
[15:08] than just someone who started a religion
[15:11] but it was actually god himself who was
[15:14] calling you to that supper table of the
[15:17] word of god amen
[15:19] hallelujah now in going into this idea
[15:22] today of course we're going to take you
[15:24] to the temple and i want to start in
[15:26] this little direction and remember the
[15:29] old testament is nothing but types and
[15:31] shadows for the new amen and it also
[15:34] paints to us a picture of what we can
[15:37] expect by the living of the gospel of
[15:40] the new testament amen
[15:42] hallelujah the old testament you see
[15:45] that's why you know i've heard people
[15:46] say well you know all i need are these
[15:48] four gospels right somebody say i just
[15:50] need the words of jesus right some
[15:52] people say oh i just need the new
[15:53] testament and they cut off the rest of
[15:55] the book but brother schister this book
[15:58] is the word amen the word is the person
[16:01] of jesus christ he is coming forth in
[16:04] revelation both new testament and old
[16:07] testament amen
[16:09] hallelujah if anything those shadows of
[16:11] the old testament they bring in the
[16:14] perfect picture of your expectation as a
[16:17] believer in the lord jesus christ amen
[16:20] notice here in the old testament it was
[16:22] in the book of exodus well once uh moses
[16:25] went up to the mount god gave him the
[16:27] directions of uh the inspirations of
[16:30] what to build the tabernacle as right
[16:32] and remember uh it was a badger skin it
[16:35] was showing a type of jesus christ
[16:38] because remember it actually took moses
[16:41] nine months
[16:43] from the conception at mount sinai until
[16:46] the actual anointing of the tabernacle
[16:51] nine months showing you that it was
[16:53] actually jesus christ who was that
[16:56] tabernacle that israel was to draw unto
[17:00] you amen
[17:02] hallelujah now i want to establish this
[17:04] because when god sent the temple of
[17:07] tabernacle order he said it in such a
[17:09] way that only a few people could
[17:12] participate in worship
[17:15] oh my
[17:16] hallelujah you know when we come in here
[17:19] it's not just a few of you that can
[17:21] participate in worship
[17:26] hallelujah we'll get to this in a second
[17:28] but we understand that all are supposed
[17:31] to participate and be a partaker in the
[17:35] spiritual worship of jesus christ today
[17:38] amen
[17:40] so in the old testament when god sent up
[17:42] the tabernacle we see there's an outer
[17:45] quartz of the of the place or outer
[17:47] courtyard and oh and there priests and
[17:50] men would be able to gather right i'm
[17:53] gonna go somewhere in just a second now
[17:54] watch this so
[17:56] where that's men not women
[18:00] in the tabernacle there's looking
[18:02] glasses that a woman could look through
[18:05] but she could not approach unto the
[18:07] worship any further than that that only
[18:09] make a sister say hallelujah amen
[18:12] because you have been called to what to
[18:15] walk into the fellowship with god
[18:17] almighty amen
[18:20] then you would have the actual building
[18:23] set up of the tabernacle and the first
[18:26] uh the inner courts or the uh the holy
[18:29] place it would be one it would have the
[18:32] menorah the seven uh golden candlesticks
[18:35] it had the table shoe bread the altar of
[18:37] incense and that would be for the priest
[18:40] only right and then
[18:42] once a year there was a veil that what
[18:45] they could uh only the high priest
[18:47] himself could go into the holies of
[18:50] holies all right i'm laying a little
[18:51] foundation for where we're going all
[18:53] right so notice the high priest there's
[18:55] only one man that could go in there
[18:58] that was fulfilled in jesus christ
[19:00] one man going in there
[19:02] [Music]
[19:03] hallelujah and he paid the price with
[19:06] his own blood amen
[19:10] so
[19:12] i wonder if we could just separate on
[19:14] our cast systems today oh wait we don't
[19:17] have that today all right
[19:19] noticing in hebrews 9 6 now when these
[19:21] things were thus ordained the priest
[19:23] went always into the first tabernacle
[19:25] that's the holy place that we showed
[19:27] accomplishing the service of god
[19:30] hey where do you come today i come to
[19:32] church some of you say i come to service
[19:36] hallelujah god has put us in a place
[19:39] today that we are coming to service amen
[19:43] notice the sisters you don't have to sit
[19:45] outside you're right in this place
[19:50] hallelujah most of the inspiration that
[19:53] were on our fathers of the past they'd
[19:55] built a church where there'd be entering
[19:57] doors
[19:58] and then they'd have the doors leading
[20:00] to the sanctuary
[20:02] and then in this place they would have
[20:06] seeds where they could look this way and
[20:09] then there's a pulpit right here
[20:13] but there's no veil
[20:16] from there to there to separate where
[20:19] the holy ghost would speak to you
[20:25] the revelation is
[20:27] there's no separation
[20:30] that you no longer can come into the
[20:33] presence of the holy ghost himself amen
[20:37] because right here that was where the
[20:39] shekinah glory of god dwelts amen
[20:44] hallelujah it's not a man it's god
[20:47] himself that is in this room right now
[20:50] with you amen
[20:52] hallelujah
[20:54] now notice this i want you to see this
[20:56] in psalms 84 4 it says blessed are they
[20:59] that dwell in thy house they will still
[21:01] be praising thee amen
[21:04] that's a promise of god when you dwell
[21:06] in the house of god you're going to be
[21:08] always praising god
[21:11] hallelujah
[21:14] notice actually this psalm in psalms 84
[21:17] it's a psalm by david and it says a
[21:19] psalm 4 the sons of korah
[21:22] all right that was the priesthood all
[21:23] right now notice in the 10th verse the
[21:26] lord showed me this a while back it says
[21:28] for a day in thy courts is better than a
[21:31] thousand
[21:33] notice how he said he said the courts
[21:35] david was saying
[21:38] that the courts it was better to dwell
[21:41] in the
[21:42] courts right
[21:45] then a thousand
[21:47] days elsewhere
[21:50] not here
[21:52] not here
[21:53] right here
[21:58] this
[21:59] i would rather be
[22:02] a door keeper in the house of my god
[22:05] than to dwell in the tents of wickedness
[22:10] do you get what that means
[22:13] david's here saying he's saying the only
[22:15] thing i can be because i am not a priest
[22:18] is i can be a door keeper right here for
[22:21] the priesthood to go in
[22:24] oh how he wanted to go into here how he
[22:27] wanted to go into there but he could not
[22:29] go
[22:33] he was satisfied by just being out here
[22:36] opening
[22:38] doors that's all he could do
[22:41] and we say
[22:43] oh if i could only be the apple of god's
[22:45] eye like david was to god
[22:48] and brother branham said remember he
[22:50] said if david was among us now he'd be
[22:52] one of the weakest christians in our
[22:54] midst
[22:58] because he did not have the fire baptism
[23:02] to the soul amen
[23:04] he was restricted in the old testament
[23:06] to this experience right here
[23:09] oh how it ought to make you rejoice amen
[23:13] to think that god ordained you for such
[23:15] a fellowship i love divine amen
[23:20] hallelujah
[23:22] that's why god praised john the baptist
[23:25] but then he said he said that that the
[23:27] least that are coming after this are
[23:29] greater than that he was talking about
[23:32] those that would receive the baptism of
[23:34] the holy ghost stay amen
[23:37] hallelujah
[23:39] now let's get going
[23:41] so what was it
[23:42] in the new testament when christ died
[23:44] remember the the veil was wrench
[23:48] tearing it down so there's no veil
[23:49] between you and i today no veil between
[23:52] the high priest and and the church
[23:56] we are all entering into you see the
[23:58] holy ghost is not restricted to one
[24:00] little spot anymore he's in the whole
[24:03] congregation amen
[24:07] hallelujah
[24:09] now notice let's begin to go through
[24:11] this
[24:11] so we want to look at today
[24:14] that if we were called remember in that
[24:17] day
[24:18] in the old testament it was death to go
[24:21] into the into the holiest of holies
[24:23] only the high priest could go there
[24:25] but your prophet said that if you don't
[24:28] go in today you die
[24:30] before you die if you went in but now
[24:33] it's death to not go in
[24:38] you are called today to live in the
[24:42] holies of holies
[24:43] the actual presence of god
[24:47] now tabernacling himself in you your
[24:50] prophet called it tabernacling deity
[24:54] hallelujah deity speaking amen
[24:57] when a life is so set aside to god that
[25:00] it's god and god alone that has control
[25:04] you have a tabernacling deity in you
[25:06] amen
[25:09] what does that mean that's what god
[25:10] wants to be in you
[25:16] you don't think the devil comes to me
[25:17] sometimes and i know and i know
[25:19] sometimes a lady looks at stuff and
[25:21] saying how can it be me how can it be me
[25:22] it's a devil's lie that it's not you
[25:25] you are called to experience the holy
[25:28] ghost in a level that is this
[25:33] a holies of holies experience all right
[25:36] now watch
[25:37] 55 hidden lights and today he dwells in
[25:40] you as his tabernacle right you're the
[25:42] temple of god now right but we must make
[25:45] this place a dwelling
[25:47] like we were good last night there can't
[25:48] be any any funny stuff going on any any
[25:51] little secret sins you got to get them
[25:53] out amen
[25:55] you hallelujah when in the old testament
[25:58] when the temple was destroyed it was
[26:00] because the priesthood and the people
[26:03] failed to order their lives with god in
[26:06] that tabernacle
[26:09] or temple and it'd be destroyed every
[26:11] time yes
[26:12] we've got to let the holy ghost clean us
[26:14] out
[26:15] well how can i get in there
[26:18] hallelujah
[26:20] but we must live with god in the holies
[26:23] of holies a consecrated hidden life
[26:26] alone quiet with god
[26:30] he didn't say preachers
[26:32] every single one of you are a temple of
[26:35] god as a child of god
[26:38] that means that you've got to live with
[26:41] god in the holiest of holies
[26:45] you're called to dwell with this literal
[26:48] god
[26:48] [Music]
[26:50] that you have been chosen and called to
[26:53] approach
[26:54] a consecrated
[26:56] right
[26:57] that means god you have to make
[26:58] sacrifices in order to stay in communion

[27:05] you're in amen
[27:08] hallelujah
[27:09] it's not the law of it it's the desire
[27:12] for communion
[27:13] that's the mistake that people make well
[27:16] i've got to fast as long as jesus or i
[27:18] won't make it and they try to approach
[27:21] god on a legal basis and god isn't
[27:23] interested in your legalism
[27:25] he wants you to come to him because you
[27:27] want him
[27:29] because you want to know him amen you're
[27:30] satisfied with whatever he has for you
[27:32] amen
[27:36] so what does he put on your heart
[27:38] hallelujah
[27:40] fasting is part of it
[27:41] hallelujah staying away from the world
[27:44] that's part of it
[27:46] keeping the word constantly in front of
[27:48] you that's part of it
[27:50] and what god wants to yield you up to a
[27:52] alone quiet with god hidden in life amen

[27:58] well come around
[27:59] we become too excited upset about too
[28:04] many things
[28:06] what does that mean
[28:07] it shows there's something lacking
[28:14] the church ought to be a million miles
[28:15] up the road to what it is now we're
[28:17] still back down in the adolescent age
[28:20] like teenagers
[28:22] i got a couple they're almost teenagers
[28:24] now like oh glory to god and all of a
[28:25] sudden i see flashbacks of myself coming

[28:31] fussing fighting quarreling and stewing
[28:37] hallelujah
[28:38] you're still struggling with these
[28:39] things there's something lacking
[28:42] but there doesn't have to be something

[30:52] joy forevermore right there amen

[31:08] and full assurance of faith having our
[31:09] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious
[31:11] and our bodies washed with pure water

[31:38] lord if i felt like it well now a priest
[31:41] is to make a sacrifice and you the
[31:43] congregation notice how it says this are
[31:46] high priest of god to make a spiritual
[31:49] sacrifice
[31:51] there is only one high priest
[31:55] it's jesus christ
[31:58] but the prophet he likens the approach
[32:01] to you being a temple of god that you
[32:04] are a high priest going in to that
[32:07] holiness of holy presence down in amen
[32:10] it's based on your sacrifice you gotta
[32:12] say god i need to know you i've got to
[32:15] know you
[32:16] i will not be denied amen
[32:19] hallelujah now notice he even applies it
[32:22] to this service
[32:23] see the setup is still the same
[32:28] he said our high priest got to make a
[32:30] spiritual sacrifice that's the fruits of
[32:31] your lips giving praise to god you go
[32:33] down and say well i if i felt like it
[32:35] i'd go over and testify to somebody
[32:38] hallelujah well do it anyhow
[32:41] if you're a high priest brother it's
[32:42] burning in your heart whether you feel
[32:44] like doing it or not go do it anyhow
[32:46] because you've got to make a sacrifice
[32:49] something that's hard to do amen
[32:52] you might have felt a little bit wore
[32:53] out from last night don't worry i did
[32:56] too amen but i'm here to sacrifice for
[32:59] service unto god today amen i'm here
[33:02] believing the holy ghost is in our midst
[33:05] because his word obligates him amen and
[33:07] i stand right here knowing for a fact
[33:10] that all things are possible right here
[33:13] amen
[33:14] these signs shall follow them that
[33:16] believe hallelujah
[33:19] a royal people
[33:21] giving praise to god because god lives
[33:24] in this heart
[33:25] hallelujah
[33:27] so we realize that you being the temple
[33:29] of god this is obviously both christ in
[33:31] the old testament now it's youtube body
[33:33] spirit soul god wants to put that
[33:35] shekinah living right in the depths of
[33:38] who you are all right
[33:40] now
[33:41] i want to show you some things
[33:44] i feel the lord to do this today
[33:47] i want you to see this
[33:49] where are we interested in being with
[33:51] god in the holies of holies
[33:54] for the brethren call it the hidden life
[33:56] with god
[33:58] we hear so much and say glory to god i
[34:00] want to be in the holies of holies
[34:05] well what's in there
[34:08] the presence of god amen
[34:11] but when you actually begin to look at
[34:13] it
[34:14] you find
[34:15] that god actually had things
[34:18] that were put in
[34:20] that holies of holies
[34:22] he placed it within his ark
[34:26] the ark that it didn't matter if it was
[34:29] in the tabernacle or if it was carried
[34:31] on the priest's shoulders it was a
[34:33] living word amen
[34:36] and so much the brothers preaching
[34:37] joshua when they made preparation
[34:41] to
[34:42] to split jordan's red jordan c right
[34:45] jordan river when they went to do that
[34:47] they sent the art 2 000 cubits or spans
[34:50] or whatever it was in front of the
[34:52] people
[34:54] so that was the waters would open up
[34:56] again
[34:58] by that ark
[35:02] that ark is power amen that ark has
[35:05] christ himself the word
[35:08] and god has called you now to be in what
[35:12] in direct communion with that ark
[35:16] that's what it is
[35:17] right there
[35:19] that is the furniture he ordained in
[35:21] that ark but what what what what's in
[35:23] that ark
[35:25] and after the second bale the tabernacle
[35:27] which is called the holiest of all which
[35:29] had the golden censor and the ark of the
[35:32] covenant overlaid about with gold
[35:34] wherein that means inside of that ark
[35:38] now watch this
[35:39] inside of that heart was the golden pot
[35:42] that had manna and aaron's rod that
[35:45] budded
[35:46] and the tables of the covenant and over
[35:50] it the cherubims of glory shadowing the
[35:53] mercy seat of which we cannot now speak
[35:56] particularly oh my god
[35:59] i want you to see this now watch
[36:03] within that ark
[36:05] god placed attributes
[36:08] of his divine presence
[36:11] that you would be a partaker of
[36:14] if you go into that holies of holies
[36:19] all right and what was it we see what
[36:23] the ten commandments
[36:25] we see aaron's rod
[36:27] and we see the man of the pot of manna
[36:30] these are all in there well they're just
[36:33] in there because it sounds good
[36:35] god has a plan for his entire word amen
[36:39] it has to mean something
[36:42] there's something god is trying to show
[36:46] you in his word amen
[36:48] he want to put it there god does not let
[36:50] the word doesn't come haphazardly
[36:52] remember even when jesus christ come
[36:54] brother branham said jesus did not live
[36:57] his life haphazardly
[36:59] every move had a purpose
[37:01] every word had a purpose
[37:04] he said oh if he could just live like
[37:06] that amen
[37:08] to realize that christ in you it has a
[37:12] purpose amen
[37:13] your everywhere your every thought your
[37:16] every action amen
[37:18] it has a purpose
[37:20] yes
[37:22] we've got to move into deeper realms of
[37:24] christ
[37:26] and then we'll live it out
[37:28] hallelujah
[37:31] living in the holies of holies
[37:33] feeding on the arts contents is where we
[37:36] want to spend some time today i believe
[37:39] we've got a great start
[37:41] now remember
[37:42] this word is so deep yes
[37:45] that brother branham would preach the
[37:46] message influences
[37:48] and in that message he would talk about
[37:51] the burners of the of the uh of the
[37:53] incense the seraphims
[37:56] and he went in that message and said in
[37:58] order to live in heaven with god
[38:02] he said those seraphims had to have
[38:05] wings over their face
[38:07] over their feet
[38:08] and then what two wings to fly with
[38:13] we're talking about the same holies of
[38:16] holies experience amen
[38:18] but that one's in heaven that's why i'm
[38:20] saying this word is so deep
[38:23] that god anointed the prophet to say
[38:26] that you should be like the seraphims
[38:32] a burner of the incense a burner of the
[38:36] prayers unto god amen
[38:39] remember he said those three sets of
[38:41] wings were watched reverence humility
[38:44] and action amen
[38:47] hallelujah you got to be reverend you
[38:50] got to know that god's here right now
[38:51] he's watching you
[38:53] he's seeing how you're responding to the
[38:55] word he's seeing what you're going to do
[38:57] with it amen he's saying if you apply
[38:59] token today amen
[39:03] he wants to see if you're humbled by his
[39:05] presence in your midst
[39:07] many times god cannot come to a service
[39:09] because we're not humble enough to
[39:10] receive him we're not reverent enough to
[39:12] receive him
[39:13] he wants to be here
[39:16] oh hallelujah
[39:17] if we brought the president of some
[39:19] country in here we'd all be so humbled
[39:21] we'd all be so particular
[39:23] and that's just a man
[39:25] a failure of flesh at best
[39:32] see what if what is trump come in the
[39:34] room
[39:35] well depending who you are
[39:39] you'd sit right there and go i cannot
[39:42] believe he's here
[39:45] what if the god of all creation
[39:49] he could humble himself in such a way
[39:52] that he said i'll come right in the
[39:53] midst of him i'll dwell right there
[39:56] will they receive me will they believe
[39:59] that that i'm there will they treat me
[40:01] like i'm there and if they will
[40:04] what could happen there
[40:10] and god requires you have reverence
[40:12] humility then action to get on the move
[40:15] for him
[40:17] wings to fly with but we're working with
[40:20] the holies of holies today and i want to
[40:22] show you these things that first one
[40:24] that he mentioned was manna
[40:27] he put manna in that ark of the covenant
[40:29] that you would be able to feast on in
[40:31] that presence now watch psalm 78 and it
[40:34] rained down man upon them to eat and had
[40:37] given them the corn of the corn of
[40:38] heaven man did eat angels food he sent
[40:42] them meat to the fall oh man
[40:46] as they were leaving egypt they needed
[40:47] something to eat they were going through
[40:48] wilderness they didn't have crops
[40:49] anything like that god rained down manna
[40:52] for them
[40:54] hallelujah he rained it down every day
[40:58] factually rained it down every day
[41:02] my
[41:03] this is part
[41:05] of the holy holy experience absolutely
[41:08] hallelujah what was christ showing that
[41:10] it was
[41:11] john 6 47 verily verily i say unto you
[41:14] he that believeth on me have everlasting
[41:16] life i am that bread of life amen
[41:21] hallelujah your fathers did eat manna in
[41:24] the wilderness and are dead ah
[41:28] this is the bread which cometh down from
[41:30] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[41:32] not die i am the living bread which came
[41:35] down from heaven amen
[41:38] hallelujah
[41:39] where the eagles are
[41:42] where the carcass is the ego shall
[41:44] gather amen
[41:46] hallelujah and christ said that that
[41:50] manner that fell down to israel in dry
[41:53] times he said that was a type of himself
[41:59] i'm going somewhere with this now hold
[42:01] on he said
[42:03] i am the he said if any man eat of this
[42:05] bread he shall live forever and the
[42:06] bread that i will give is my flesh which
[42:08] i give for the life of the world
[42:13] so in that holies of holies god had
[42:16] aaron told moses to have aaron they they
[42:19] took some of that manna and they put it
[42:22] in a golden pot and they placed it in
[42:24] the ark of the covenant
[42:28] what was that for
[42:31] it was a type
[42:32] it was going into
[42:34] this type of experience that we need to
[42:36] know
[42:38] what these things were and what they how
[42:39] they pertain to us
[42:41] revelations 2 17 he that hath an ear
[42:44] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[42:46] the churches to him that overcometh will
[42:48] i give to eat of the hidden manna and
[42:51] will give him a white stone
[42:53] and in the stone a new name written
[42:57] which no man knoweth saying he that
[43:00] receiveth it
[43:01] yes
[43:03] so now god promises
[43:05] that he'll give you a hidden manner to
[43:08] the overcomer
[43:10] remember the seven church age received
[43:13] the rewards of all the other church ages
[43:19] so this is applicable to your walk with
[43:22] god
[43:23] let me show you
[43:25] what the prophet said about this all
[43:26] right now it's beautiful now watch this
[43:29] question answer 61 he says and christ is
[43:31] that hidden manna that comes from god of
[43:34] heaven afresh every day
[43:38] if you're living in the holies of holies
[43:40] this is for you
[43:42] that christ himself can pour upon you
[43:45] every day
[43:48] watch this
[43:49] we can't say well two weeks ago i had a
[43:53] great experience of god
[43:58] oh come on now
[43:59] this is factual i know we're tired i'm
[44:02] tired too but but like i'm still stuck
[44:04] in heaven i just don't move right back
[44:05] in amen but i'll tell you this you don't
[44:09] have to have a fresh experience from two
[44:11] weeks ago
[44:13] you don't need one from
[44:15] last night
[44:19] god ordained
[44:20] that you would come into such a
[44:22] communion with him
[44:24] that every single day
[44:27] you would be abiding in this holies of
[44:29] holies
[44:30] i'm going to show you something just a
[44:31] little bit here
[44:33] he
[44:34] says
[44:36] every day
[44:38] fresh now watch us this should be your
[44:40] expectation if you're there
[44:42] a new blessing
[44:44] a new something coming from god
[44:51] well it's not on emotion brother cam
[44:54] it's not on the supernatural
[44:57] don't let it's not on the major of it
[44:59] brother sister
[45:01] you've got to realize
[45:03] that the experience
[45:05] i mean
[45:06] who could go up to brother branham and
[45:08] say you know what you can't live 80 in
[45:10] the in the spiritual realm of visions
[45:12] you can't do it
[45:16] you can't let that gift operate in you
[45:18] every day all day
[45:22] that would be completely contradictory
[45:25] to what god was trying to establish with
[45:28] that angel
[45:30] hallelujah and in revelations 3 when
[45:33] christ himself gave the message to the
[45:35] angel he was to give it to you so that
[45:38] you could be a partaker in the same
[45:41] message that he received amen
[45:43] that's why brother sister this message
[45:46] it is required that you get into that
[45:50] holies of holies
[45:54] so when you wake up in the morning some
[45:56] of you really need some coffee
[45:58] i have i mean my wife do two runs this
[46:00] morning
[46:03] i need it
[46:04] hallelujah
[46:08] but did you realize
[46:09] that there's something spiritual
[46:12] that god wants to move with you
[46:14] every single day
[46:17] right
[46:19] we have christians on there i think i
[46:21] went through where was it at hobby lobby
[46:22] god bless them they want to be christian
[46:24] you know
[46:26] but they had a little little sign there
[46:28] and it said it said
[46:29] uh
[46:30] he said
[46:33] [Music]
[46:35] every day i've got to have a cup of
[46:37] coffee in god
[46:41] but you know what factually if i don't
[46:43] have coffee i still got god
[46:47] amen now whether you know it or not god
[46:50] can give you victory over being groggy
[46:51] in the morning
[46:53] god can give you victory for being a
[46:55] crab in the morning
[46:58] he can wake you up in the morning
[47:00] brother cam you're just saying something
[47:02] no it is factual that our god can do
[47:06] these things amen
[47:09] but you know what it is
[47:11] your life might start going that way
[47:14] and then you because death and life are
[47:16] in the power of the tongue
[47:18] you start saying well i'm not a morning
[47:20] person
[47:22] somebody say i am a morning person you
[47:24] are speaking the promise of that word
[47:27] over yourself good or bad amen
[47:32] that's why you say i am a son of god
[47:34] amen i'm filled with the holy ghost and
[47:37] fire amen
[47:39] every day god has promised me a fresh
[47:41] experience with him amen
[47:44] i've got joy in the morning
[47:46] his mercies are new right when i wake up
[47:49] amen
[47:51] there's a new song in my heart today to
[47:54] sing the love of jesus amen
[47:59] god is wanting to empower the spoken
[48:01] word on you
[48:03] but we find so many times that we
[48:06] actually
[48:07] get into trusting carnality
[48:10] the way we feel
[48:13] right
[48:15] when god comes over you there's feelings
[48:19] we can try to major on one quote that he
[48:22] said the the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:23] without sensation
[48:25] but you can't cut the quote off and say
[48:27] but the works of jesus christ working
[48:29] through them
[48:36] i think i said this at home the other
[48:37] day it's like your prophet said he said
[48:39] how can a man on fire sit still
[48:43] he can't sit still
[48:46] hallelujah pass around the matches
[48:48] let me see what you do when you're on
[48:50] fire
[48:51] let me see how much you can contain
[48:53] yourself in the house of god
[48:56] if i set a mess here right now you just
[48:58] want you to start kicking or whatever
[49:00] you do you'd find yourself moving by
[49:03] that fire it's the same thing with the
[49:06] baptism of the holy ghost he's trying to
[49:08] move you into a condition that you don't
[49:11] care what it is i'll do what you want me
[49:14] to do god
[49:16] i'll yield to your spirit
[49:18] honestly if the utterance comes to me
[49:20] i'll speak it out amen
[49:24] because i'm on fire for god
[49:27] hallelujah
[49:32] what is it
[49:33] if you're living the holy ghost
[49:34] there's a new blessing every day
[49:38] there's a new something coming from god
[49:40] i love this because the prophet never
[49:41] said what it was
[49:46] there might be a new revelation
[49:48] it might be a new prophetic herb
[49:52] over you
[49:54] it might be a new bar thrown over you
[49:57] again and again and again
[50:02] he said that hidden manna coming down
[50:04] from god out of heaven christ then we
[50:06] feast
[50:08] upon this manna which is christ and he
[50:10] sustains us through the journey till we
[50:12] reach the land on the other side
[50:15] that manna did not stop until they got
[50:17] to the to the promised land
[50:20] it could not stop
[50:23] hallelujah and i'm not saying that's the
[50:25] holy ghost because it's also a type of
[50:27] the millennium
[50:29] hallelujah
[50:30] and that manna falls fresh every day for
[50:34] you
[50:35] oh glory to god brother cam get the
[50:38] matches out
[50:41] hallelujah
[50:43] hallelujah we ought to be the happiest
[50:46] people in the world
[50:48] hallelujah it's sad that the prophet
[50:50] said the sickest body that i know of in
[50:52] the world it's a church of god
[50:55] we're not sick
[50:57] hallelujah we can't accept that
[51:00] we can't accept starch or any of that we
[51:02] need to be so yielded to god no matter
[51:05] what it is we'll do it
[51:11] the prophet talked about
[51:12] humiliation and he said if god wanted to
[51:15] humiliate you he said he said god will
[51:16] get you around a bunch of co-workers and
[51:18] he'll fall on you and want you to speak
[51:20] in tongues in front of them
[51:23] would you do that
[51:25] yes sir
[51:27] yes sir
[51:28] but i'll tell you what if you go out on
[51:30] your in your co-workers and you're
[51:31] scared of god
[51:32] you don't want to talk about god you
[51:34] don't want to live out god

[51:50] they'll start screaming something
[51:53] saying nasty words
[51:55] saying nasty things they can't control
[51:57] themselves
[51:58] right
[52:00] you're telling me that the devil can get
[52:02] so much on them that they'll carry on
[52:05] like that
[52:06] right

[52:10] your heart

[57:24] that manna and then it brings forth a
[57:27] life

[57:51] with his name in it you you get what i
[57:53] mean notice what he says what's this in
[57:55] manna what's this holy so holy entering
[57:58] into the adoption or the hidden place
[58:00] with god
[58:02] that's what it is
[58:04] see what the adoption is see what you
[58:05] find in your places
[58:06] see what you're getting serious about
[58:08] god and what learning how to yield
[58:10] yourself to god is
[58:11] he's positionally placing you in the
[58:13] body
[58:14] watch
[58:15] he says ministers of the gospel don't
[58:16] care about your denominations and what
[58:18] the world thinks but seek to enter into
[58:20] the hidden manna where the full
[58:21] revelation of god
[58:23] is make
[58:25] love perfect in your heart
[58:28] see what one of those blessings might be
[58:30] the love of god so overwhelming you in a
[58:32] day

[58:35] but you find out that whoa
[58:37] the holy ghost just moved a supernatural
[58:39] moving love in my life have you ever
[58:41] been there
[58:43] i know what it's like you know it's like
[58:44] when when when when you've got to
[58:46] brother branson in his early church
[58:48] at pastoring he said that when the
[58:50] people would leave they just cry so in
[58:52] love with one another
[58:53] oh god let us get back to them
[58:56] let us get that fresh blessing amen from
[58:58] god every day amen
[59:02] and you and god and everything else is

[59:09] let anything come what may you're hidden
[59:11] away what a place to live oh just let me
[59:14] abide there
[59:15] as the song said let me rest need the
[59:17] tree where uh
[59:19] so freely flows where the lamb is the
[59:22] light and the soul of the saved never
[59:25] die
[59:28] that's in the holiest of holies
[59:30] remember i was talking about those 3 000
[59:32] promises anybody count yours up last
[59:34] night well brother cam i've experienced
[59:36] 462.
[59:39] oh well that means there's still 2 500
[59:41] et cetera
[59:43] hallelujah there's that much god for you
[59:46] to receive amen
[59:51] so what was the manna so it's a fresh
[59:52] daily supply of heaven's food for the
[59:54] journey a new blessing a spirit gift or
[59:56] revelation for perfect spiritual health
[59:58] no hunger
[1:00:00] they had manna so they wouldn't be
[1:00:01] hungry
[1:00:05] hidden in manna or the living in the
[1:00:07] message of the hour never stagnates
[1:00:08] contaminates in the holy holies
[1:00:12] two was what within there was the right
[1:00:15] of aaron
[1:00:16] all right now i got to hurry up
[1:00:19] the rod in the old testament it
[1:00:20] symbolizes use as a walking staff to
[1:00:23] to shepherd uh the sheep as a king would
[1:00:26] use to ride to judge all right now watch
[1:00:28] this
[1:00:29] in number 17
[1:00:32] we have that god is actually ordaining
[1:00:35] who he would choose to be his priesthood
[1:00:40] and it was it was
[1:00:42] the levites the tribe of levi that was
[1:00:46] chosen to do that i'm just making it
[1:00:47] short now notice that third paul
[1:00:51] what god told brother abraham he said
[1:00:53] i'll meet you in there
[1:00:56] watch this and thou shalt lay all these
[1:00:59] all these sticks in the tabernacle
[1:01:01] congregation for the testimony where i
[1:01:03] meet with you
[1:01:07] that holiness of holies is the place
[1:01:09] that god meets with you
[1:01:13] i'm not speaking something that's that's
[1:01:15] that's unapproachable brother sister
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:17] i'm trying to bring you the revelation
[1:01:19] of what is possible in your midst
[1:01:22] so that you can reach out you know the
[1:01:24] prophet said don't ask god for small
[1:01:26] things he said ask god for big things
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] hallelujah i ask for deliverance i ask
[1:01:32] for the power of god amen i ask for the
[1:01:35] power to live consecrated unto you lord
[1:01:39] i ask to be a living representative of
[1:01:40] the power of jesus christ on this earth
[1:01:42] the world needs it
[1:01:45] as long as your motive and emotives and
[1:01:47] objectives are right you have the
[1:01:48] revelation of authority you have the
[1:01:50] humility of the reverence it's going to
[1:01:51] live out
[1:01:53] hallelujah
[1:01:55] that's what the third paul was i'll meet
[1:01:56] you in there
[1:01:58] same thing as my brother said last night
[1:01:59] matthew 6 you've got to go in the closet
[1:02:03] you got to go pray to god
[1:02:06] the scripture said in matthew 6 that he
[1:02:08] that heareth in secret will reward you
[1:02:10] openly
[1:02:14] hallelujah he rewards you just for doing
[1:02:17] it
[1:02:20] so what was it
[1:02:22] what was that rod doing
[1:02:24] it was symbolizing the chosen priesthood
[1:02:27] of god
[1:02:30] it should come to pass that the man's
[1:02:33] rod whom i shall choose shall blossom
[1:02:36] and i'll make to cease for me the
[1:02:37] murmurings of the children of israel
[1:02:39] whereby they murmur against you
[1:02:43] you know why god gave him manna because
[1:02:45] they were murmuring
[1:02:48] you know why he gave them
[1:02:51] the choosing of the priesthood so they
[1:02:53] wouldn't murmur
[1:02:56] you know the prophet said
[1:02:58] that the worst he said the crown of
[1:03:00] satan
[1:03:03] yes
[1:03:05] is a complainer
[1:03:08] a murmur
[1:03:10] a complainer
[1:03:11] they're not happy with anything
[1:03:13] they're not satisfied with what god's
[1:03:15] gave them
[1:03:17] they just sit right there and what
[1:03:19] they're always just being negative
[1:03:23] hallelujah and why because they provoked
[1:03:26] him in the wilderness they entered not
[1:03:28] into that land amen
[1:03:30] but notice when you're living in the
[1:03:32] holies of holies god ceases your
[1:03:35] murmuring amen he allows it to stop amen
[1:03:38] because you're living so much in the
[1:03:41] presence of god that there's no room for
[1:03:43] complaining why there's a fresh new
[1:03:45] experience every day amen there's a new
[1:03:48] blessing new revelation new move of god
[1:03:51] he's going to do something amen
[1:03:55] hallelujah
[1:03:56] look at this ride of god
[1:03:58] what was it
[1:04:01] he left that rod of god there to show
[1:04:04] the choosing and the elected of god
[1:04:06] all right
[1:04:07] ephesians was all about what
[1:04:09] that mature church at the rapture that
[1:04:11] adoption it's what
[1:04:13] it's a revelation of predestination that
[1:04:15] you were chosen to be in there
[1:04:17] hallelujah
[1:04:18] notice what did it do when it's put in
[1:04:20] there behold the rod of aaron for the
[1:04:23] house of levi bodied and brought forth
[1:04:25] buds bloom blossoms and yielded almonds
[1:04:28] what does that mean
[1:04:31] it's the same as the menorah when god
[1:04:34] set up the menorah
[1:04:36] he set it up
[1:04:37] with a an uh the balls the knots and the
[1:04:41] and the flowers
[1:04:43] yes
[1:04:45] actually i got that the knot the flower
[1:04:47] in the bowl which was the fruit all
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:49] three works of grace
[1:04:52] god would show
[1:04:54] on the people that he chose to be in the
[1:04:57] holiest of holies
[1:04:59] three works of grace would live out over
[1:05:02] them
[1:05:06] notice anytime
[1:05:09] they had the need
[1:05:11] to show the world or to show israel
[1:05:15] who was the call of priesthood
[1:05:18] all they'd have to do is show that rod
[1:05:22] it stayed in there
[1:05:24] remember this was a walking stick
[1:05:27] with nothing on it but it because it
[1:05:30] lived in the presence of god it what it
[1:05:33] showed three works of grace and notice
[1:05:37] that ball was huge
[1:05:42] hallelujah
[1:05:44] notice what he said
[1:05:45] he said there's many people tonight
[1:05:47] professing christianity who's dead who
[1:05:48] doesn't bear any fruits there's nothing
[1:05:50] in their life they seem to be helpless
[1:05:52] hopeless
[1:05:54] you're in the hole he's a holiest
[1:05:56] brother sister this revelation brings
[1:05:58] you into it

[1:06:17] to live under the attributes that were
[1:06:20] given in the holies of holies
[1:06:22] this word brings you to it
[1:06:27] he said that's not only in the
[1:06:29] presbyterian lutheran so far that's in
[1:06:30] pentecostals that's right it's the truth
[1:06:32] what you need today is come in before

[1:06:37] at this you're saying brother cam i
[1:06:39] don't know about all this then what you
[1:06:40] need to do is come into christ amen
[1:06:46] look what happened now the first thing
[1:06:48] he had to be refreshed to bring forth
[1:06:49] buzz about it out not only did it bud it
[1:06:51] brought forth blossoms not only did it
[1:06:52] blossom but it brought forth fruit now
[1:06:54] watch us and that's the way you'll be
[1:06:58] every believer that throws himself the
[1:07:00] outside
[1:07:01] out of the outer courts into the veil
[1:07:04] where christ is hide your life away

[1:07:40] bible i could probably say it but it
[1:07:41] isn't gonna be exactly right
[1:07:44] hallelujah but notice
[1:07:46] he says notice what he says it'll bear
[1:07:48] the fruits of the spirit
[1:07:51] if you've got the three works of grace

[1:07:53] fruit of the spirit you have the spirit

[1:08:43] scriptures we can teach our fiati but

[1:09:23] attribute notice what's three perfection

[1:09:31] of your life
[1:09:35] three no you don't need to go see what
[1:09:37] cecil demilles or whatever he's got
[1:09:39] going on
[1:09:40] is the
[1:09:43] ten commandments
[1:09:44] in that ark
[1:09:46] oh my god exodus 24 12 and the lord said
[1:09:49] to moses come up to me in the mount and
[1:09:51] be there and i will give thee tables of
[1:09:53] stone and a law and commandments which i
[1:09:55] have written that thou mayest teach them
[1:09:59] he wanted the ten commandments in there
[1:10:03] so that what he could reveal the word to
[1:10:06] you yes hallelujah
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:11] there they are i was just reading
[1:10:12] something before and and a sister in a
[1:10:15] church went to a garage sale and she
[1:10:16] bought me a martin luther catechism book
[1:10:18] from the early 90s like 1905 or
[1:10:21] something like that it's in really good
[1:10:23] shape
[1:10:24] and he had a preface in the whole thing
[1:10:27] and he said he went to all the churches
[1:10:29] that claimed to be lutheran and he's
[1:10:30] seen how backslid they were
[1:10:33] and he said to think that the ministry
[1:10:35] came to this
[1:10:38] and so he said he said he ended up
[1:10:40] writing the catechism because of that
[1:10:43] and he said the first thing that he said
[1:10:45] the the preachers were not teaching the
[1:10:48] people the word of god he said the worst
[1:10:50] thing he seen in the church he said that
[1:10:52] people were coming to church but he said
[1:10:54] when they would leave church they would
[1:10:56] be no different than the world
[1:10:59] that's what even a message
[1:11:01] denominational experience will produce
[1:11:05] amen hallelujah
[1:11:07] it's got to be living amen
[1:11:09] it's got to be in duty it's got to be
[1:11:12] living in the holies of holies amen
[1:11:16] the reason i said that was because in
[1:11:18] there he said he said the vast majority
[1:11:19] of people that are in our churches have
[1:11:21] no idea what the ten commandments even
[1:11:22] are
[1:11:26] he said you preachers he said the first
[1:11:28] thing you do he said teach teach your
[1:11:29] people those 10 commandments
[1:11:32] i just thought that was neat because
[1:11:36] you got to get them the word of god
[1:11:38] he said they're living like the world
[1:11:39] well no one they only know the ten
[1:11:40] commandments
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:42] we got a revelation so high that we
[1:11:44] realize that all ten commandments are
[1:11:46] revealed in just two
[1:11:49] hallelujah love the lord your god with
[1:11:51] all your heart your mind your soul amen
[1:11:53] and then love your neighbor as yourself
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] this revelation is fulfilled amen in our
[1:12:00] midst hallelujah
[1:12:01] i got time i got to hurry up
[1:12:03] oh glory to god i'm at one hour
[1:12:06] hallelujah
[1:12:09] pass around the matches
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:16] i'm going quick
[1:12:17] i want to go quick
[1:12:20] gotta be a nice preacher
[1:12:22] say lord can you say it through me
[1:12:23] quicker so i felt like brother brandon i
[1:12:25] said oh god it's like brother branstad
[1:12:27] said this takes me it just takes me
[1:12:28] hours to do it
[1:12:30] it takes me to do that and i preach even
[1:12:32] fast preach real fast
[1:12:34] hallelujah
[1:12:35] but you get a lot
[1:12:37] hallelujah it's trying to feed you the
[1:12:39] word amen
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:43] so notice within that
[1:12:46] which was the most important watch this
[1:12:49] was actually
[1:12:52] the ten commandments for the two tables
[1:12:53] of stone
[1:12:54] watch us
[1:12:56] the lord said unto moses write thou the
[1:12:58] words for after the tenor of these words
[1:13:01] i have made a covenant
[1:13:03] with thee and with israel
[1:13:05] that word that he enjoined you to
[1:13:08] was the covenant
[1:13:11] that actually sees you through
[1:13:14] it brought you back to the unconditional
[1:13:16] covenant
[1:13:18] not all but grace
[1:13:21] the revelation is grace well if grace is
[1:13:24] on you
[1:13:25] then how do you establish that with the
[1:13:27] word
[1:13:29] that's what we want to see
[1:13:33] all right notice the covenant in
[1:13:34] theology the covenant of works
[1:13:36] is that implied the commands
[1:13:38] prohibitions promises of god the promise
[1:13:40] of god to man that man perfects
[1:13:41] obedience should entitle him to
[1:13:43] happiness and do and live
[1:13:45] that do and die
[1:13:50] god gave them the word so they'd be
[1:13:52] happy
[1:13:54] if you would live the word
[1:13:56] then the blessings of the book would be
[1:13:58] upon you
[1:14:00] that's why we have to be a bible loving
[1:14:03] people amen
[1:14:05] read the bible believe that watch that
[1:14:07] there be a spirit of god to energize
[1:14:10] this word inside of you
[1:14:13] that's why the prophet called it and
[1:14:14] jesus called in john 4 the spirit and
[1:14:16] the truth
[1:14:18] he said that when you
[1:14:19] when the word is preached god will
[1:14:22] actually bring the spirit to energize
[1:14:24] that word inside of you
[1:14:26] if you believe that's what he's doing
[1:14:31] hallelujah
[1:14:33] watch
[1:14:36] and moses said under exodus 16 30. moses
[1:14:39] and error take apart and put an omar
[1:14:40] full man in there and lay it up before
[1:14:42] the lord to be kept for your generations
[1:14:45] as the lord commanded moses so aaron
[1:14:48] laid it up before the testimony to be
[1:14:50] kept
[1:14:53] you know what the testimony was
[1:14:55] they said it was called the testimony
[1:14:57] because it contained in it the law which
[1:15:00] was a testimony or testification of the
[1:15:03] mind and will of god unto israel
[1:15:07] now watch
[1:15:08] this
[1:15:10] the ark was called the ark of the
[1:15:12] testimony the ark of the covenant
[1:15:16] so you see the manna is there
[1:15:19] the rod is there
[1:15:22] but the ark does not get its name after
[1:15:25] those two
[1:15:28] it gets its name
[1:15:30] after the word of god the tables that
[1:15:33] were put inside of it
[1:15:36] now this is very important so you've got
[1:15:38] to catch this because notice he calls it
[1:15:40] the testimony what is that
[1:15:42] it's the testification
[1:15:45] of the mind and will of god unto you
[1:15:49] did you notice that
[1:15:51] it's god's mind to you
[1:16:01] hebrews 10 15 where of the holy ghost
[1:16:03] also is a witness to us for after that
[1:16:05] he had said before this is the covenant
[1:16:07] that i will make with them after those
[1:16:10] days saith the lord
[1:16:11] i will put my laws into their hearts
[1:16:17] not just hearts but in their minds will
[1:16:22] i write them
[1:16:27] hallelujah
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] the purpose what the attribute god is
[1:16:33] trying to express
[1:16:36] with the ark and the shekinah
[1:16:38] the key thing is he wants his own mind
[1:16:42] testimony
[1:16:44] to roll through you
[1:16:46] you see
[1:16:47] that's why brother sister that when god
[1:16:50] brings a hope to you of faith
[1:16:53] right
[1:16:54] god god will bring something in front of
[1:16:55] you and you'll say man i feel like that
[1:16:56] needs to be mine
[1:16:59] god's gonna save that soul i just not
[1:17:02] you see it's not different than the word
[1:17:05] because his will is the word
[1:17:08] so you've got to recognize that that is
[1:17:11] the will of the word living through you
[1:17:18] that means
[1:17:20] that the whole directive of the holy
[1:17:22] ghost inside of you
[1:17:24] is to live out in a supernatural way way
[1:17:27] fulfilling
[1:17:28] every unique thing that he has promised
[1:17:31] to you as a believer
[1:17:32] see
[1:17:34] it might not be on me
[1:17:37] hallelujah for the saving of sister
[1:17:39] naomi's aunt
[1:17:42] my brother bang's dead
[1:17:44] that that might not be written on my
[1:17:45] heart
[1:17:49] but that does not nullify that it's not
[1:17:51] the will of the word
[1:17:55] because that's what places you in the
[1:17:57] body
[1:17:58] when you can receive the communion with
[1:18:01] the holy ghost and he wants to write his
[1:18:04] word in you
[1:18:08] hallelujah because if you can catch it
[1:18:10] by faith it is thus saith the lord the
[1:18:13] will of god amen
[1:18:16] there's nothing stopping it from
[1:18:17] happening
[1:18:18] it don't matter if it's a person it
[1:18:20] doesn't matter if it's an animal it
[1:18:21] doesn't matter if it's a natural
[1:18:22] necessity it will be provided because
[1:18:25] god has shown you
[1:18:28] you've come to such a holy holy
[1:18:30] experience
[1:18:31] that you realize
[1:18:32] that his word
[1:18:34] is written in your heart
[1:18:39] no i said that for a reason
[1:18:42] it's just like i said last night
[1:18:45] god wants
[1:18:46] he said whatever you ask in my name
[1:18:49] you'll receive it
[1:18:52] you see how we're living so under
[1:18:54] privilege
[1:18:55] you see how something's lacking
[1:18:57] yes
[1:18:59] it's whatever is on your heart
[1:19:02] oh brother can that's way too much
[1:19:04] that's exactly what the devil wants to
[1:19:06] tell you
[1:19:09] as a preacher i always say start right
[1:19:11] here get that first love
[1:19:13] cry out for god until you know that you
[1:19:17] know that you've got the baptism of the
[1:19:19] holy ghost
[1:19:21] and then what you cry out
[1:19:24] for that holy ghost that's in you say
[1:19:26] god i'm yours live
[1:19:28] greater depths
[1:19:30] greater manifestation
[1:19:32] more of you and me less of me
[1:19:34] god he must increase i must decrease
[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:41] it's what this adoption is doing right
[1:19:44] so notice and their sins and iniquities
[1:19:46] will i remember no more
[1:19:49] now where omission of these these is
[1:19:51] there's no more offering for sin
[1:19:53] you see that revelation in there
[1:19:56] it brings you the revelation
[1:19:59] your sins are gone
[1:20:01] that's what the word is writing that
[1:20:03] word on your heart
[1:20:06] they've been remitted
[1:20:10] you know it's like brother bram said he
[1:20:11] said it's the only one that's putting
[1:20:12] that stuff on you is the devil
[1:20:14] that's right now if you ain't never went
[1:20:16] in you never went in this time go in
[1:20:20] hallelujah look at it look at the things
[1:20:22] that god has promised us
[1:20:25] look at that
[1:20:26] he wants to establish a word testimony
[1:20:29] through you
[1:20:30] he promised to write
[1:20:33] his laws into their hearts and their
[1:20:35] minds would he write them
[1:20:37] now we're going to close
[1:20:39] 56 hidden life with christ then and
[1:20:41] there they had the seven gold
[1:20:42] candlesticks seven prong lamp rather but
[1:20:44] inside behind the veil there was an ark
[1:20:46] and that ark
[1:20:48] in that ark was the tablets the ten
[1:20:50] commandments as we call them and that
[1:20:52] represented the human heart
[1:20:56] that how god promised in the days gone
[1:21:00] by
[1:21:01] that in this day that he would write his
[1:21:03] laws
[1:21:05] not upon the tables of stone but upon
[1:21:08] the heart he'd placed the law in the
[1:21:11] heart
[1:21:12] ezekiel spoke of it and the prophets all
[1:21:14] spoke of how that god would do that in
[1:21:16] the days coming which was a type
[1:21:21] hallelujah yes don't you see what that
[1:21:23] is though
[1:21:26] you see that's where the separation of
[1:21:28] legalism
[1:21:30] and grace stand
[1:21:34] because legalism will get you over here
[1:21:37] but you can never be happy there
[1:21:39] you'll still be murmuring you'll still
[1:21:40] be complaining you'll still want you'll
[1:21:43] still just feel like you're not there
[1:21:45] you gotta drop your legalisms
[1:21:49] grace produces the holy ghost hey what's
[1:21:52] it called the three works of grace
[1:21:55] the three works of unmerited favor
[1:21:59] he gives them to you because by faith
[1:22:01] you accept them
[1:22:03] and you stay right there remember
[1:22:05] brother branham said he said it's not
[1:22:07] just good enough to accept the blood
[1:22:10] he said you've got to stay there
[1:22:12] accepting it until he comes back and
[1:22:14] responds back
[1:22:18] he recognizes your repentance he
[1:22:21] recognizes your baptism he recognizes
[1:22:24] your need for this holy holy gospel amen
[1:22:28] and he recognizes it in such a way
[1:22:31] that what that now you recognize it
[1:22:34] and that's when it becomes an invincible
[1:22:37] army and god
[1:22:38] where we at i believe brother sister we
[1:22:41] are right here
[1:22:44] hallelujah
[1:22:45] and that's why the devil's fighting as
[1:22:46] hard as he is
[1:22:48] that's why he's trying to slow us down
[1:22:51] that's why he's trying to hold it back
[1:22:54] because if this bride lives this forth
[1:22:57] that devil ain't going to have nothing
[1:22:58] to do but but fall like he did in the
[1:23:01] days of the the disciples the scripture
[1:23:03] says and jesus said he said i've seen
[1:23:04] satan fall from heaven as lightning
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:12] don't you realize that this bride is
[1:23:14] coming to a place
[1:23:16] that the accuser of the brethren finds
[1:23:18] no more place in heaven
[1:23:24] hallelujah the accuser of the brethren
[1:23:26] is cast out
[1:23:28] hallelujah right now he's accusing you
[1:23:31] before god
[1:23:32] right now he's coming against your
[1:23:34] testimony
[1:23:37] you see he can accuse all he wants
[1:23:39] because there's still a mediating blood
[1:23:42] in your way amen
[1:23:44] hallelujah when he accuses you jesus
[1:23:47] looks at you but alls he sees is the
[1:23:49] blood amen
[1:23:51] hallelujah
[1:23:52] if all he sees is the blood if all's god
[1:23:56] can see is the blood what should we see
[1:23:58] amen the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:02] listen
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:09] so we always say god take me into that
[1:24:10] holy zolas
[1:24:12] but what's in there brother sister
[1:24:14] that's what i'm telling you this gospel
[1:24:16] is so rich
[1:24:18] this gospel is so deep
[1:24:22] that many times
[1:24:23] what is promised inside of all of it
[1:24:28] it's mind-boggling the human mind the
[1:24:31] finite mind cannot comprehend it
[1:24:36] but who's going to take you in there
[1:24:38] god's going to take you in there
[1:24:40] who's going to see that this is finished
[1:24:41] god is going to see this is finished
[1:24:44] hallelujah you crying out for the holy
[1:24:46] ghost you believe you got it amen
[1:24:50] watch what he does as he begins to
[1:24:53] complete your life more and more

[1:24:57] statue of a perfect man these things are
[1:24:58] living in your life

[1:25:10] fruits of the spirit can you i told that

[1:25:27] god you're gonna be able to focus on all
[1:25:29] this stuff every single day all day

[1:25:36] fully understand it and fully memorize
[1:25:38] it
