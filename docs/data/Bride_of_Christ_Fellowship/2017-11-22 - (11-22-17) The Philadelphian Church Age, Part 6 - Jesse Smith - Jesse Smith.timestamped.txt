[47:57] well I could talk to you afterwards Oh
[47:58] Paul's well by the grace of God
[48:03] revelation 3 verse 7 we look at the open
[48:10] door tonight by God's grace but as we
[48:13] said we looked in all the New Testament
[48:14] Scriptures on the open door on Sunday
[48:15] night and let's show what the Prophet
[48:19] talked about it as well but let's see
[48:21] where the Lord Jesus mentions it here in
[48:25] chapter 3 verse 7 and 8 for there say
[48:29] Amen
[48:30] I'll read verse 7 that we can all read
[48:32] verse 8 and to the angel the church in
[48:35] Philadelphia write these things saith he
[48:36] that is holy he that is true he that
[48:40] hath the key of David he that openeth
[48:42] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[48:46] man openeth let's begin on three one two
[48:49] three I know thy works behold I have set
[48:52] before
[48:53] for thee an open door and no man can
[48:56] shut it for thou hast a little strength
[48:59] and has kept my word and has not denied
[49:03] my name
[49:03] every thankful for the strength of God
[49:05] how many have kept the Word of God
[49:08] praise the Lord let's have a word of
[49:10] Prayer one more Heavenly Father we love
[49:12] you thank you for your word we've kept
[49:15] the word Lord by your grace we have
[49:18] strength o God today and we have more
[49:20] than a little strength we have Holy
[49:22] Ghost strength dear God hallelujah the
[49:26] joy of the Lord is our strength tonight
[49:28] thank you Lord Jesus father to speak to
[49:30] us through thy word Lord and courage
[49:32] those that are discouraged heal those
[49:34] that are sick Oh God Lord bring more joy
[49:37] to those who are joyful Lord Jesus we
[49:40] meet every need here tonight Lord only
[49:41] you can do it
[49:42] we're trusting and you all of our faith
[49:44] is in the Lord Jesus so we give you
[49:47] praise honor tonight and minister to us
[49:49] by your spirit in Jesus Christ's name
[49:51] when the saints said Amen god bless
[49:53] here's a CD dear praise God
[49:54] Malakai you can switch over when you're
[49:57] ready let's look at part
[50:10] six tonight by God's grace we've been
[50:11] looking at the Philadelphia Church age
[50:13] John Wesley the messenger and it's from
[50:16] 1703 and 1791 this is part six of the
[50:20] Philadelphia and church age is part 46
[50:22] in the series so it just makes me happy
[50:24] that God has given us that many sermons
[50:26] and he's given us a great understanding
[50:28] because member the Prophet said we have
[50:31] to understand this before we can
[50:33] understand the seven seals before he can
[50:35] understand the seven trumpets and the
[50:36] seven vials and the three woes and all
[50:39] these things which we'll get to by God's
[50:41] grace you know last year I was led to
[50:44] the Holy Spirit I believe to ride out a
[50:46] whole entire script on the whole entire
[50:48] book of Revelation so I wrote about 35
[50:50] pages single-spaced on the book of
[50:53] Revelation and I brought out all the
[50:55] symbols brother Ram taught and the
[50:58] timeline for the whole chapter so I'm
[51:00] making videos right now on our YouTube
[51:01] page I'm stalled out on chapter 6
[51:05] I got chapters 1 to 5 done I stalled out
[51:08] on 6 because I've been so busy lately
[51:09] but I have all the scripts and all the
[51:12] scriptures ready for chapter 6 all the
[51:13] way to 22 and I'll probably preach that
[51:16] after I get done here with the church
[51:17] ages we'll see what the Lord allows but
[51:20] I hope you've been blessed by the church
[51:21] ages it's so crucial it's not optional
[51:24] it's necessary it's been essential that
[51:27] we preach this amen and every believer
[51:29] knows that praise God so our text there
[51:32] the last Sunday we looked at the open
[51:34] door through the scripture I'm gonna
[51:36] show the same slide I finished with on
[51:37] Sunday night so according to the New
[51:40] Testament there's the following open
[51:42] doors in the New Testament
[51:43] I found a three four or five I found six
[51:46] open doors in the New Testament the
[51:50] first one is the opened order in the
[51:52] Philadelphia Church H for the missionary
[51:54] efforts that were given and that's what
[51:57] we read tonight we'll look at part of
[52:00] that tonight the second one we looked at
[52:03] on Sunday night was the open door for
[52:05] the Gentile dispensation in other words
[52:08] after the Jews close the door on Christ
[52:11] God opened the door of faith to the
[52:13] Gentiles if they're gonna reject me I'll
[52:15] open the door for the Gentile the
[52:17] Gentiles can come unto me
[52:19] and by the way I'm called it or the
[52:21] Pentecost experience hallelujah
[52:25] there's also open doors for local
[52:27] ministries like Troas remember Paul said
[52:29] God opened the door and trow as the City
[52:32] there that's where Eutychus was healed
[52:34] after he fell out of the second story
[52:36] building and died God raised him up
[52:38] right there intro as amen hallelujah
[52:40] amen
[52:41] then there's the open door to heaven by
[52:45] vision which Saint John the Prophet
[52:48] experienced so that's the open door to
[52:51] heaven and remember that was a type of
[52:54] the rapture
[52:55] so church I believe one of these days
[52:57] the door of heaven is gonna open for the
[52:58] bride of Jesus Christ and she's gonna
[53:00] take a rapture to the sky that was a
[53:04] vision to the rapture a vision open door
[53:06] to heaven what about the actual open
[53:08] door to heaven which is the voice right
[53:10] the shout voice I'm sorry which is the
[53:12] Trump the trumpet of God amen hallelujah
[53:17] fifth the open door Jesus says you must
[53:21] have an open you must open their hearts
[53:23] door so you must have an open door heart
[53:25] response that's requested by Christ this
[53:28] is the open or we must have we must open
[53:30] our lives and say Jesus take take
[53:32] control of every one of my rooms every
[53:35] part of my life take control my mornings
[53:37] take control my lunch breaks take
[53:40] control of my church attendance they
[53:43] control my money they control my
[53:45] attitude take control my sincerity take
[53:49] control of my family you got a Lord take
[53:51] control for all my entire life I give
[53:54] you the doors I give you the keys and
[53:57] lastly we saw this was striking the open
[54:00] door that's gonna be requested by the
[54:03] those that are left in the tribulation
[54:06] period we would say we'll call them make
[54:09] believers the make believers are gonna
[54:10] try and knock and get through the open
[54:12] door but Jesus is gonna say sorry the
[54:14] rapture is already gone I never knew you
[54:17] so we must make sure that our soul is
[54:20] sealed if our soul is sealed then we'll
[54:22] hear his voice when he calls us we must
[54:24] listen for the voice if so many people
[54:26] are listening for other voices instead
[54:28] of listening for the voice of the
[54:29] rapture
[54:29] praise God there listen to so many other
[54:32] things
[54:33] listen is jesus gonna call my name it
[54:35] could the rapture come tonight they're
[54:36] trying they're excited to listen to
[54:38] every other thing other than that sweet
[54:40] voice of the rapture amen
[54:41] but that's be listening for the rapture
[54:43] praise God now the problem there's a new
[54:47] quote I've never read to you before so

[57:05] God
[57:06] so let's get ready so I'm telling you
[57:08] get ready for the great mystery of the
[57:09] open door to reveal to your heart
[57:11] Marvis lee tonight let here yeah that's
[57:15] what the Holy Spirit do reveal God's
[57:17] Word to us now remember the prophets
[57:20] spent most of his time on the truth of
[57:21] the open door from the sermon 1962
[57:24] Philadelphia Church H we're gonna go
[57:26] through quotes about or sorry from the
[57:28] 1960 sermon about the power of Jesus
[57:31] Christ and the open door now here's the
[57:35] first thought the Prophet gives on the
[57:37] open door and now the age of the church
[57:40] age of the brotherly love the great
[57:42] missionary age and the open door age and
[57:44] the reward was a be made a pillar and
[57:47] the revelation was three names the name
[57:49] of God the City of God and God's new
[57:52] name is the revelation that was given to
[57:55] this church in this age now the great
[57:59] missionary age really loved the age of
[58:01] missions let me just name to you some of
[58:03] the great men I wrote their names down
[58:05] John Wesley George Whitefield Charles G
[58:09] Finney Dwight Moody William Carey the
[58:12] great missionary that went to India in
[58:14] 1773 David Livingstone to South Africa
[58:17] see although some of these great men I
[58:19] got names of plenty of them here great
[58:22] men that lived in that brotherly love
[58:23] the black man the white man the brown
[58:26] man the yellow man all walls was broke
[58:28] down and these men went out into the
[58:31] mission fields he said brotherly love
[58:34] stretching out a hand to all nations
[58:35] everywhere and it was opened up to them
[58:38] that they could go another door age I'm
[58:42] sorry another open door age because they
[58:43] couldn't before that they couldn't have
[58:45] done it the papal and the papacy of Rome
[58:48] and so forth had it also closed up till
[58:51] they couldn't go but in that age the
[58:53] doors was open because he said it was an
[58:55] open door age so we're talking about
[58:58] this age right here from 17
[59:01] was in 1703 the 1906 this age before
[59:06] this the papacy had closed the doors to
[59:08] certain countries you couldn't get in
[59:10] they had control by the politics and by
[59:13] the religion but in this age the
[59:16] Philadelphia Church age right here these
[59:18] 156 years from this church age God
[59:23] supernaturally opened the door for the
[59:26] missionaries to get into every country
[59:28] amen so remember Martin Luther was born
[59:30] here that was his life span John Wesley
[59:33] was born there and that was the age of
[59:35] the Philadelphia Church age the open
[59:37] door of course we have our prophet lived
[59:38] this age brother Branham now the our
[59:41] temptation remember was previously we'll
[59:43] get to that later
[59:44] now they opened up many doors during
[59:48] that age the door to the gospel the door
[59:49] to the mission fields the door back to
[59:51] Christ and everything was opened up
[59:54] during that age and you can see what
[59:56] they did the brethren done a great job
[59:58] out of it and from John Wesley the star
[1:00:02] after the Sardis age after he come over
[1:00:05] waking them up from the Sardis age from
[1:00:08] the past 150 years great missionaries
[1:00:10] like of no other time or age has covered
[1:00:13] the entire earth think of that now
[1:00:16] listen to what he says here every nation
[1:00:18] under the heavens has heard the word it
[1:00:24] completed many many years ago see but
[1:00:27] not the gospel just the word the letter
[1:00:35] killeth but the spirit giveth life so
[1:00:39] the Prophet said during the Philadelphia
[1:00:41] church age during this church age right
[1:00:43] here
[1:00:44] the missionaries went around the world
[1:00:46] and every God every nation hurt or got
[1:00:49] to read the Word of God today look at
[1:00:53] today almost every nation has some form
[1:00:55] of Christianity whether it's latter-day
[1:00:56] saints in it right or whether it's the
[1:00:58] Roman Catholic Church every nation under
[1:01:01] heaven has got that least hear the Word
[1:01:03] of God or have the Word of God but
[1:01:05] according to the prophet of God not
[1:01:08] every church has had not every country
[1:01:10] has had the power of God sorry try to
[1:01:13] get past that
[1:01:14] I'm gonna go back to this every nation
[1:01:17] under heaven has heard the word it
[1:01:19] completed many many years ago but not
[1:01:21] the gospel just the word now next time
[1:01:26] we're gonna look at this in that sermon
[1:01:27] the prophets spent about half an hour
[1:01:29] telling us the testimonies of power of
[1:01:32] the word of God the word is just the
[1:01:37] word in the Bible form but the power but
[1:01:40] the gospel is when this word starts
[1:01:42] living in your life
[1:01:44] praise the Lord how many ever seen a
[1:01:46] genuine miracle before the genuine
[1:01:49] miracle was the power of God that was
[1:01:52] not the word that was the gospel I do
[1:01:58] yeah that's what the prophets teaching
[1:01:59] us there's a difference between the word
[1:02:02] and the gospel the word is used to you
[1:02:05] and I pass in tracks how many believe in
[1:02:07] passing tracts I believe that that's
[1:02:09] just the word that's just the word but
[1:02:12] the gospel is when that word lives and
[1:02:14] there's supernatural miracles by the
[1:02:16] preaching of the word every nation has
[1:02:20] had the word but not every nation has
[1:02:22] had the power or the gospel praise God
[1:02:27] exactly right and Jesus said every
[1:02:29] nation must hear the gospel before he
[1:02:32] comes back to the earth that's why we
[1:02:34] need missionaries to go over and take
[1:02:36] the gospel not the word only but the
[1:02:39] gospel praise God the power of the
[1:02:41] gospel in church I believe we don't see
[1:02:43] enough power we don't have enough power
[1:02:45] in our lives because we're not sincere
[1:02:47] enough because the Prophet says
[1:02:48] sincerity brings power if you're sincere
[1:02:52] tonight then power can go to operating
[1:02:54] in your life a men but it takes
[1:02:56] sincerity and you know I've got to be
[1:02:59] careful all preachers everybody's got to
[1:03:01] be careful we always we can criticize
[1:03:03] others for lack of power in their lives
[1:03:06] but what about our life we can see in
[1:03:09] other people's lives it's easy to see
[1:03:11] well there's no power in that person's
[1:03:12] life but what about our life we're the
[1:03:15] ones that got a checkup what about the
[1:03:17] RAM say the log that rots the fastest is
[1:03:21] the one sitting in the water are you
[1:03:24] with me then the prophets say that which
[1:03:27] log if you ever log up on the
[1:03:28] grass or log in the water which one's
[1:03:30] going to rot the fastest the one in the
[1:03:32] water so which which people are going to
[1:03:35] get spiritually lukewarm first the
[1:03:38] people and the message of the hour or
[1:03:39] the people out there on some dead ground
[1:03:41] it's the people near the message of the
[1:03:43] hour Leuven if we don't keep on fire
[1:03:47] with God we're the ones that will write
[1:03:49] the fastest how many ever seen that in
[1:03:50] any church before message Church
[1:03:53] anybody seen a message Church the ones
[1:03:55] that get tired on God the fastest the
[1:03:58] ones that get discouraged with God the
[1:03:59] ones that give up with God the fastest
[1:04:01] are the ones in the message churches
[1:04:03] because the power of God is there but
[1:04:05] they're lacking sincerity amen
[1:04:08] hallelujah they'll come to church maybe
[1:04:11] for a while maybe for a long time
[1:04:13] they'll come to church when they go home
[1:04:15] they forget all about the preaching of
[1:04:16] the word but that's not hearing the word
[1:04:20] if you heard the word you take that word
[1:04:22] home with you didn't James say if you
[1:04:26] stare at a mirror and forget what you
[1:04:28] are then your gospel is in vain your
[1:04:30] religions in vain in other words if you
[1:04:32] come to church here what you are and
[1:04:34] then forget what your are what you are
[1:04:36] what you're supposed to do then you
[1:04:37] didn't hear a single word the preacher
[1:04:39] said that night or that morning and the
[1:04:42] church said Amen if we don't apply what
[1:04:48] we've heard we didn't hear anything we
[1:04:50] just sat and listened and tried to stay
[1:04:52] awake hallelujah
[1:04:55] that's exactly right if we don't apply
[1:04:58] what we've heard to our lives we didn't
[1:05:01] hear nothing it's exactly right and if
[1:05:06] we don't confess our sins we'll never
[1:05:07] have faith because we must confess our
[1:05:09] sins first then we can have faith and
[1:05:12] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:05:14] even though we know the love of many
[1:05:16] shall wax cold we should expect that
[1:05:17] people are gonna get colder and colder
[1:05:19] and colder but let them get cold you and
[1:05:22] I got to stay on fire you have to stay
[1:05:24] on fire I have to stay on fire you've
[1:05:27] got to keep your fire strong for Jesus
[1:05:29] that means you got to feed on Jesus when
[1:05:31] you're at home when you're driving the
[1:05:33] grocery store you got to feed on the
[1:05:35] word you got to fill your heart and mine
[1:05:38] when you're cooking supper like well
[1:05:42] I don't cook supper all the time but
[1:05:44] when I do I do this and to Jesus at work
[1:05:48] you got a feast on the Word of God amen
[1:05:50] you got a every break you'll have you
[1:05:53] you got to make sure as much you can
[1:05:55] stay on the Word of God this is why
[1:05:57] there's a lack of power that's why the
[1:05:58] word just becomes the word instead of
[1:06:00] the gospel the power to change your life
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:03] it's got that power we got to pray down
[1:06:07] the blessings of God people's prayer
[1:06:08] life takes a stumble well no wonder
[1:06:10] there's no power you got to pray you got
[1:06:12] to be in contact because memory read the
[1:06:14] court on Sunday you got to pray first
[1:06:15] then the revelation comes you got to get
[1:06:19] in the spirit first then the Word of God
[1:06:21] starts acting I talked to numerous
[1:06:23] people they said well Jess you know when
[1:06:25] I first got saved I saw so much
[1:06:27] supernatural and now I don't see nothing
[1:06:28] and you look at their lives and they
[1:06:30] don't pray anymore they don't come to
[1:06:32] church like they do there no listen to
[1:06:34] the Prophet they don't read their Bibles
[1:06:36] well what it makes perfect sense because
[1:06:38] one plus one is always going to be two
[1:06:40] amen two plus two is always going to be
[1:06:43] four if you put the sincerity in if you
[1:06:45] confess your sins if you pray down God's
[1:06:47] blessings if you ask God for revelation
[1:06:50] then God's gonna pour it out for you
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] but it's about our choice to see do we
[1:06:56] want the word or do we want the gospel
[1:06:58] we've got to have both amen
[1:07:00] but we got to have power hallelujah
[1:07:03] emember Holy Ghost evidence the Prophet
[1:07:06] said is we're in the word all the way
[1:07:07] and people say they're in the word but
[1:07:10] don't want to hear more preaching
[1:07:11] something's wrong with that experience
[1:07:14] that's right because when you got the
[1:07:15] Holy Ghost you love the Word of God and
[1:07:19] you want to live all of it amen and you
[1:07:22] don't get upset with preachers you love
[1:07:23] preachers amen
[1:07:24] just like the preachers love the people
[1:07:26] of God amen it's exactly right people
[1:07:29] don't have the Holy Ghost if they're not
[1:07:30] in every sermon they're not in every
[1:07:32] word they don't want to read their
[1:07:33] Bibles they don't want to feast on God's
[1:07:35] Word how can they have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] they can't because the Holy Ghost feeds
[1:07:38] on the word amen glory the Lord willing
[1:07:43] I'll preach the next message on that the
[1:07:46] word vs. the gospel and I'll break down
[1:07:47] some of these quotes and bring out more
[1:07:49] closer brother Branham what he said
[1:07:53] now the next the profit breaks into this
[1:07:57] thought now this is the thought that I
[1:07:58] never saw before so this is brand new to
[1:08:01] me I've never preached this to you so
[1:08:03] you can't say you already preached out
[1:08:04] before brother yes this is brand new and
[1:08:08] sometimes it's good to review because we
[1:08:09] have new people here and they need to
[1:08:10] hear it by God's grace and we have young
[1:08:12] people that don't understand it yet you
[1:08:14] know so we it's good to go over these
[1:08:16] things and I just try to do it as I'm
[1:08:17] led by the Holy Spirit as I'm led right
[1:08:21] by the Holy Spirit by God's grace and I
[1:08:23] did not plan as I studied and prepare
[1:08:25] today I did not plan to bring out this
[1:08:27] thought this thought just came out as I
[1:08:28] listened to the message and read it over
[1:08:30] again by God's grace now I said now
[1:08:34] watch the time coming now after the
[1:08:35] great missionary move I swept across the
[1:08:37] nations umbrella love to make what they
[1:08:40] had I'm sorry to take what they had
[1:08:41] nothing against of literature and
[1:08:43] whatever more into the different parts
[1:08:45] of the world now the church denomination
[1:08:47] had gone back to education and works
[1:08:49] again see gone back after the great
[1:08:53] denomination been set up Jesus set an
[1:08:55] open door after the Wesleyan age had
[1:08:59] come in and the Methodist Church had
[1:09:01] been established in the earth taking
[1:09:03] roots growing making a great big church
[1:09:05] which it is today when the greatest of
[1:09:07] them among the Protestant churches at
[1:09:09] that time the thing that took place then
[1:09:12] was Jesus and an open door for the
[1:09:14] church before they entered the Laodicean
[1:09:18] Church H so I want you to see that Jesus
[1:09:24] opened the door before they entered the
[1:09:26] legacy in church age the reason I'm
[1:09:30] saying this this way so you can see what
[1:09:32] I mean by the lap over see it's from the
[1:09:35] missioner age of the open door but you
[1:09:38] see he had told them he had the key of
[1:09:40] David
[1:09:41] now remember what's the key of David the
[1:09:43] key on the shoulder represents the
[1:09:44] responsibility that Christ has over his
[1:09:47] bride the key of David the key of David
[1:09:50] was on his shoulder the key the
[1:09:52] government will be upon his shoulder and
[1:09:53] he said the key of the David part
[1:09:55] represents Jesus as son of David so
[1:10:00] Jesus tells them I've got the key of
[1:10:01] Dave and I got responsibility for my
[1:10:03] bride and I'm taking her into the
[1:10:05] millennium amen
[1:10:06] but here he said he had set before the
[1:10:08] church now after that age of the
[1:10:10] missionary Whitefield and all those
[1:10:12] finis Sankey moody and down come down to
[1:10:16] now he said an open door before the
[1:10:17] church oh here's what you have to watch
[1:10:19] now it's just in between the
[1:10:20] Philadelphia and the latest seen aged
[1:10:23] the lap over now catch this he makes a
[1:10:27] statement here I want to bring out now I
[1:10:28] set before this church between the
[1:10:30] Philadelphia age and later CH an open
[1:10:32] door oh do you get it now and got your
[1:10:36] thinking caps on real good listen now
[1:10:38] this is good I tell you it's honey in
[1:10:41] the rock just getting the Nuggets out
[1:10:45] and shine them up I and the door to the
[1:10:49] sheepfold so brother Ram ties two
[1:10:51] scriptures together he ties I'm going to
[1:10:53] open the door for you in Revelation 3:8
[1:10:55] he ties it in with john 10:7 where jesus
[1:10:58] says i am the door and brother Ram said
[1:11:00] this is honey in the rock amen glory
[1:11:05] this is a golden nugget I'm shining up
[1:11:08] the golden nugget to scriptures Jesus
[1:11:11] opens the door and Jesus says I am the
[1:11:13] door he puts them together and said now
[1:11:16] you've got honey in the rock does that
[1:11:17] taste sweet to you Church that sweet is
[1:11:20] that sweet like honey to you to know
[1:11:22] that Jesus is opening the door and he is
[1:11:24] the door and the word is the door and
[1:11:28] Christ is the word and you've received
[1:11:30] the word I hope somebody's got some
[1:11:31] sweetness in their mouth tonight and I'm
[1:11:35] talking spiritual honey to eat that's
[1:11:39] all that's all Holy Ghost Hill Christian
[1:11:41] needs he needs one part of the Bible to
[1:11:43] interpret the other part amen
[1:11:45] you don't need anything outside of the
[1:11:47] Bible the Bible interprets itself
[1:11:49] because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible
[1:11:51] amen and it does not contradict itself
[1:11:54] that's what the prophet called hunting
[1:11:56] the rock you can listen to it if you
[1:11:57] want he said on the door to the
[1:11:59] sheepfold what is that door that was set
[1:12:01] now let's go back in our minds from that
[1:12:04] great missionary age in the Methodist
[1:12:05] that swept through the country with the
[1:12:07] message of sanctification Luther through
[1:12:09] justification Wesley come along with
[1:12:11] message of sanctification at the end of
[1:12:13] the Methodist age the end when it took
[1:12:16] roots and begin to come to great
[1:12:17] organization and when any church
[1:12:20] listen that's strong but I want someone
[1:12:23] to show me anywhere through the
[1:12:24] gleanings of history any church that God
[1:12:27] ever raised up come up the Pentecost
[1:12:30] away without any organization and as
[1:12:33] soon as it organized it died and never
[1:12:35] raised again Helen could be a good
[1:12:37] witness of this and so could us that no
[1:12:40] history any Church had ever had a
[1:12:42] revival and started a new church never
[1:12:45] came back to a revival they've all died
[1:12:48] I with me they've all died look at the
[1:12:52] ones we've seen in our day there's been
[1:12:54] different revivals that have happened
[1:12:55] around the United States what's that one
[1:12:58] down in Florida there's that Brown
[1:12:59] Street movement you remember that in the
[1:13:01] 1990s I was a teenager when it happened
[1:13:03] some people there and some city in
[1:13:05] Florida I think it was Browns some
[1:13:07] Brownsville City or something they had a
[1:13:09] speaking in tongues revival where's that
[1:13:11] revival today it's died out all's it was
[1:13:15] was just more speaking in tongues it
[1:13:17] wasn't a real genuine revival right
[1:13:20] because it never produced holiness it
[1:13:22] was just producing gifts but we're not
[1:13:24] interested so much in gifts as we are
[1:13:26] they giver because if we got the giver
[1:13:28] we'll get gifts amen when you deaf when
[1:13:31] you definitely have the giver you'll
[1:13:33] have definite gifts if you have people
[1:13:35] that are sincere with the giver amen but
[1:13:39] you got we got to be sincere we got to
[1:13:41] want the gospel and the word we got the
[1:13:44] word and the gospel we got our power
[1:13:46] when it takes sincerity it takes two
[1:13:49] sincere dedicated walk to Christ see
[1:13:52] more people are more want to be more
[1:13:54] dedicated to Amazon or Netflix than they
[1:13:56] want to be to Christ Jesus they're more
[1:13:59] faithful to Facebook or Instagram and
[1:14:01] checking their phone and checking all
[1:14:03] their computer things and websites than
[1:14:05] they are to the Word of God it's exactly
[1:14:08] right
[1:14:09] and that's why there's no power there's
[1:14:11] just word but there's no power amen
[1:14:16] see its lacking its lacking he says
[1:14:21] he says this any Church God ever raised
[1:14:24] up never have a revival he says oh the
[1:14:28] membership went on but they never had a
[1:14:30] revival show me a revival in the
[1:14:32] Lutheran Church today show me a revival
[1:14:35] in the pet and the Pentecostal church or
[1:14:38] the Methodist Church show me a revival
[1:14:40] where people are hungry for God and
[1:14:42] they'll spend more time at church than
[1:14:43] the Ohio State football game this
[1:14:45] Saturday show me where they're so hungry
[1:14:49] for God
[1:14:50] well they'll feast on the Word of God
[1:14:52] and they can't hardly get enough of the
[1:14:53] Word of God
[1:14:54] show me a people like that and then
[1:14:56] you'll see a revival see how you were
[1:14:58] struggling to have revival do you see
[1:15:00] that we have to be a church that has
[1:15:02] revival and keeps the revival going how
[1:15:06] do you get revival the Prophet says
[1:15:07] start praising him he said we lavish
[1:15:11] with your praise praise the Lord Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ
[1:15:14] worship Him be a true worshiper you see
[1:15:19] there it's not a rocket science science
[1:15:21] or something like that it's a simple
[1:15:23] basic gospel truth that we need to lay
[1:15:26] to heart praise God they organized which
[1:15:31] God said in other Church ages hates the
[1:15:33] thing the doctrine of the Nicolaitans I
[1:15:35] just drove by a Methodist Church yes a
[1:15:38] Methodist Church right there in Norton
[1:15:40] and they have a sign that says God is
[1:15:43] still speaking come into our church but
[1:15:47] it's a rainbow sign which means
[1:15:49] homosexual and it's got the homosexual
[1:15:53] flag on it God is still speaking Church
[1:15:56] that shows the nomination are not have a
[1:15:58] revival God's not speaking there if
[1:16:02] they've denied the Word of God Jesus the
[1:16:06] Spirit is not preaching from that pulpit
[1:16:08] it's now the Antichrist spirit are you
[1:16:11] with me Church they can't have revival
[1:16:13] because they've denied the Word of God
[1:16:15] now let's look at our lives are we
[1:16:16] denied any word of God if we are that's
[1:16:20] a reason there's no revival if we're
[1:16:22] obeying the word our lives are in
[1:16:23] revival amen see God hates the
[1:16:28] nomination he hates it he hates when the
[1:16:31] the people are conquered he wants the
[1:16:33] people to be on fire he wants his people
[1:16:35] to be
[1:16:35] free he wants his people to have the
[1:16:36] holy spirit move upon them he wants them
[1:16:38] to be excited about the Word of God we
[1:16:43] should be all of us should be not just
[1:16:44] me not just you all of us should be
[1:16:46] excited about the Word of God amen
[1:16:48] everybody should have a revival he said
[1:16:53] now remember we're not talking against
[1:16:54] anybody the good people are scattered
[1:16:56] God's got sheep and all them places out
[1:17:00] there where did you where did God find
[1:17:02] you which denomination to God finds you
[1:17:04] in God has sheep in every Church
[1:17:07] hallelujah see we're preaching against
[1:17:11] the system right and I'll say like this
[1:17:14] we're preaching against the Serpent's
[1:17:15] seed although we don't know which ones
[1:17:16] they are but we are preaching against
[1:17:18] them if you understand what I'm saying
[1:17:20] we don't know which ones we don't know
[1:17:22] individuals but we're preaching against
[1:17:24] their Antichrist spirit and their Anti
[1:17:26] Christ doctrine and their false
[1:17:28] teachings and all these things like that
[1:17:30] but God's got sheep in every one of them
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:34] that's true that's right methods Baptist
[1:17:37] whatever there are they're God's people
[1:17:38] if they're born again of the Spirit of
[1:17:40] God they're God's people but the
[1:17:41] organization has cramped them down and
[1:17:43] packed letter for Methodists the Baptist
[1:17:46] to camel light and so forth
[1:17:47] - they wore the letters out just packing
[1:17:50] from place to place they wore their
[1:17:52] membership papers out all right how the
[1:17:55] Lord said now in the end of the age I am
[1:17:58] the door to the sheepfold now stay with
[1:18:00] me here stay with me this is all
[1:18:02] building to where I've never preached
[1:18:04] these thoughts here now what door was
[1:18:08] opened about Jesus just between those
[1:18:11] two ages he's talking about Philadelphia
[1:18:14] and Laodicea 1906 about when the
[1:18:18] Methodists age and Dwight Moody in them
[1:18:20] faced or faded from the scene there come
[1:18:22] forth the breaking forth the people
[1:18:24] receiving the Holy Ghost speaking with
[1:18:26] tongues and things he says come back
[1:18:29] into the church that's about right in
[1:18:30] 1906 along and there all right what took
[1:18:33] place then after that begin to come
[1:18:35] along the first thing you know they
[1:18:36] organized in the old General Council
[1:18:38] which went in now called the Assemblies
[1:18:40] of God see out of that church that was
[1:18:43] left over and what taken place then he
[1:18:46] said an open door an open door
[1:18:49] alright now let's read this here I want
[1:18:54] to just try to stop right there let me
[1:18:56] read that again by God's grace I want to
[1:18:58] make sure I go over that you're gonna
[1:18:59] see it he gives a few different ideas
[1:19:01] about the open door in the Philadelphia
[1:19:03] Church age and the Laodicean Church age
[1:19:06] so I'm gonna be dead again so there was
[1:19:08] a revival in 1906 I remember the Sousa
[1:19:11] Street revival in California I remember
[1:19:13] that it was a revival but the first
[1:19:16] thing they did the first now these were
[1:19:18] the ones that were not right with God
[1:19:19] the believers there that were not right
[1:19:21] with God organized and made a
[1:19:23] denomination right but the Prophet said
[1:19:26] out of that was taken the open door so
[1:19:30] in other words as soon as they
[1:19:32] denominated that move of God Jesus made
[1:19:35] an open door for the true believer and
[1:19:38] that's what the Prophet brings out here
[1:19:40] now he quotes the scripture I know that
[1:19:42] works behold I've set before thee an
[1:19:44] open door and no man can shut it open
[1:19:48] door what was it it was the revelation
[1:19:50] of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ not
[1:19:54] being a second person of the Trinity but
[1:19:57] being God Himself made flesh and dwelt
[1:19:59] among us now if you notice just a minute
[1:20:03] let's just read that again shut it as
[1:20:05] little strength as not denied my name
[1:20:06] so look at this here I show this again
[1:20:09] let me show it one more time to show you
[1:20:11] what the Prophet says about it we have
[1:20:12] Luther he said there was an open door
[1:20:15] and did I do the right now
[1:20:17] okay so there's an open door he said
[1:20:20] right here the name of Jesus and the
[1:20:24] supreme deity of Jesus was an open door
[1:20:27] after they denominated there then Jesus
[1:20:30] opened the door for his name and for the
[1:20:35] supreme deity to understand Jesus that
[1:20:38] he is God amen he said that's the first
[1:20:42] time the names been spoke of now since
[1:20:45] back in this age back there when he lost
[1:20:48] his name I remember the Thyatira church
[1:20:51] age the fourth church age the Prophet
[1:20:53] said he lost his name because it was the
[1:20:56] darkest age they stopped using the name
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ and they adopted that wrong
[1:21:02] speed
[1:21:02] father son Holy Ghost right I saw
[1:21:05] somebody do it yesterday at our school
[1:21:07] they were praying for their food like
[1:21:08] this I thought oh lord have mercy and
[1:21:11] then they said we're not Catholic and I
[1:21:12] thought oh my
[1:21:13] well they've adopted Catholic ways right
[1:21:18] and Luther came out with a name that he
[1:21:20] was alive but he was dead remember the
[1:21:22] Sardis Church age they still didn't have
[1:21:24] the name in the 5th church age so the
[1:21:27] 4th church age which was remembered not
[1:21:28] over 900 years long they didn't have the
[1:21:31] name of Jesus and the sixth age Martin
[1:21:33] Luther didn't have the revelation name
[1:21:35] of Jesus but here I'm sorry the fifth
[1:21:37] age but in the sixth age at the end of
[1:21:39] it
[1:21:40] Jesus says that I'm going to open the
[1:21:42] door and I'm gonna give you the
[1:21:44] revelation of my name and also the
[1:21:46] revelation of Who I am
[1:21:47] amen hallelujah remember this quote now
[1:21:51] this is review - I preached this a few
[1:21:53] weeks ago remember the Prophet brought
[1:21:55] out the use of the name of Jesus during
[1:21:57] the seven church ages I'll skip the
[1:21:59] quote because you've already seen it
[1:22:01] remember in the emphasis church age
[1:22:03] Jesus said they had the name of Jesus
[1:22:06] he says you have patience for my name's
[1:22:08] sake the second church age there's no
[1:22:10] mention meaning they still had his name
[1:22:12] the third church age now hold us fast to
[1:22:14] my name now the Prophet said in the fire
[1:22:17] dear church age there's no mention of
[1:22:19] the name that's where they lost the
[1:22:20] revelation of the name of Jesus the
[1:22:24] Sardis church age jesus said you have a
[1:22:26] name you live but you're dead so they
[1:22:29] still don't have the name forties - ages
[1:22:31] now in the Philadelphia Age Jesus says
[1:22:35] you've not denied my name and now the
[1:22:37] name of Jesus is being restored back to
[1:22:40] the people amen now later see there's no
[1:22:43] mention but the Prophet said because of
[1:22:45] the open door and because of the overlap
[1:22:48] right because the overlap he said I'm
[1:22:50] going to keep you from the hour
[1:22:51] temptation in the sixth church age
[1:22:53] because of that overlap there's an
[1:22:55] overlap from the sixth agender seventh
[1:22:57] because of that we know the name of
[1:22:59] Jesus is still a revelation the name of
[1:23:01] Jesus still open door today to all those
[1:23:03] that believe in the name of Jesus amen
[1:23:06] so I'll give you a visual Jesus name was
[1:23:09] lost in this church age according to
[1:23:11] Jesus but it's restored here at the end
[1:23:14] of the Philadelphia the
[1:23:16] the Laodicea can anybody understand that
[1:23:18] by God's grace that's the lap over he
[1:23:20] keeps talking about these ages kind of
[1:23:22] lap over so the law the losing of the
[1:23:24] name lapped over the influence of that
[1:23:26] age laughed over but now the influence
[1:23:28] of the restoration is in our lives amen
[1:23:31] it's laughed over into my life
[1:23:33] hallelujah Amen now here's a quote here
[1:23:38] the prophet's gonna bring out another
[1:23:40] idea about the open door okay so let me
[1:23:43] just read this this following quote
[1:23:45] refers to the end of Leo see in church
[1:23:47] eight so the Prophet said right now
[1:23:49] we're living in another open door age
[1:23:52] okay so he's saying we have another open
[1:23:55] door so we'll get to this at the end I'm
[1:23:57] gonna actually gonna close with that
[1:23:58] that's the new thought I never heard
[1:24:00] before now we find out that this great
[1:24:02] revelation that God gave here to the
[1:24:04] church in this last days that God sent
[1:24:06] and reveals himself the open door
[1:24:08] between the two or two ages it wasn't in
[1:24:12] the lair of seein age neither was in
[1:24:13] this other age but it was between the
[1:24:15] lap over so it lapped over into both
[1:24:17] ages this open door lapped over into
[1:24:21] both ages it wasn't just one it was both
[1:24:23] he said I'll prove it a little further
[1:24:25] down now the revelation of himself is
[1:24:29] where he's built his church
[1:24:30] haami knows that to be true he built his
[1:24:32] church upon the revelation of himself
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:36] now let's get back to these open North
[1:24:37] scriptures here what is the open door he
[1:24:41] said the revelation of the supreme deity
[1:24:44] of Jesus Christ what did he say to his
[1:24:48] first church back here back in this age
[1:24:50] he said I am he that was which is and
[1:24:53] which shall come I'm the first and the
[1:24:55] last
[1:24:56] I'm the Almighty he said it three
[1:24:58] different times made his self deity to
[1:25:01] the first Church back here before he
[1:25:03] went into the last church age he said I
[1:25:05] set before you an open door if you want
[1:25:09] to see the revelation here it is where
[1:25:11] he would build his church and the only
[1:25:13] way that he could take his church is
[1:25:15] back to the revelation of what he is
[1:25:17] truly oh yeah glory now see I updated
[1:25:22] this slide so here's the six reasons
[1:25:24] here's a six open door so I updated it
[1:25:27] with this in yellow the open no response
[1:25:30] requested by Christ Atlassian church age
[1:25:32] this included the revelation of Christ's
[1:25:34] name and his deity that's the open door
[1:25:38] for us
[1:25:39] praise God Christ is saying open your
[1:25:42] hearts door and then they said I'll give
[1:25:43] you the revelation of my name and of my
[1:25:46] deity praise God you know that's one
[1:25:49] thing that all these false churches have
[1:25:51] you know the one thing they have in
[1:25:52] common it's not communion you know that
[1:25:55] most Protestants will say oh that that
[1:25:59] bread is not the body that wine is not
[1:26:01] the blood but you know the one thing
[1:26:03] they'll agree on Church is that Trinity
[1:26:05] doctrine that's one thing for them they
[1:26:09] can all grab their arms say we all
[1:26:11] believe God's three persons we all
[1:26:13] believe God is three see in other words
[1:26:15] they're all saying we're all idol
[1:26:17] worshipers praise God in fact they're
[1:26:21] all saying we're all denying the name of
[1:26:24] Jesus Christ and I'll tell you how just
[1:26:28] a little testimony the guys I work with
[1:26:30] at the Bible Club
[1:26:31] he taught last week and he said now
[1:26:33] brother Jesse's been teaching me a lot
[1:26:34] of things lately he taught me that the
[1:26:35] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is
[1:26:37] what he said what is it I said the Lord
[1:26:39] Jesus Christ and he said what is that
[1:26:40] like a different name I said it's the
[1:26:42] literal name of God and he said amen and
[1:26:46] he thought it right there to the kids he
[1:26:48] said father son Holy Ghost he said Lord
[1:26:50] Jesus Christ so see he can learn
[1:26:53] something that's pretty good sign if you
[1:26:55] can't learn something like that if you
[1:26:56] turn down that what are you doing you're
[1:26:58] closing the door you're not letting
[1:26:59] Jesus bring you to the open door glory I
[1:27:02] say there's hope for that fella
[1:27:04] Alleluia there's hope he can be taught
[1:27:08] the Word of God he can say he said
[1:27:09] father is Lord because Lord means ruler
[1:27:12] he said son is Jesus right God in flesh
[1:27:16] Holy Ghost is Christ Christ means The
[1:27:19] Anointed of what the Holy Ghost father
[1:27:21] son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ thank
[1:27:24] God for the open door amen
[1:27:28] what am i I'm trying to tell you that
[1:27:30] God's trying to open the door to people
[1:27:32] praise God but memory saw on Sunday
[1:27:34] night you've got to pray for the open
[1:27:35] door I've got to pray for open doors
[1:27:38] that's what Paul said Paul said pray for
[1:27:41] me and open door and I speak the word
[1:27:43] boldly as
[1:27:44] I ought to speak hallelujah thank you
[1:27:47] Jesus Lord open doors that's we're
[1:27:49] praying here at the altar before church
[1:27:50] Lord open heart save souls were sighing
[1:27:53] and crying for abominations if there's
[1:27:55] fifty in the city say 50 at 40 30 20 10
[1:27:59] if there's only eight if there's only
[1:28:01] three say what you can save souls we
[1:28:03] don't want to see people lost we want to
[1:28:05] see you open the door amen
[1:28:07] glory so they can see baptism they can
[1:28:10] see that Jesus is God amen so they can
[1:28:13] see Isaiah 44 where he says he said I am
[1:28:16] the only God if there's another God
[1:28:17] beside me I don't know him he look over
[1:28:20] and say well there's the son you know
[1:28:21] well actually there's another guy
[1:28:23] there's the Holy Ghost dove over here he
[1:28:25] said if there's any other God I don't
[1:28:26] know him why didn't he say there's them
[1:28:30] well if I there's no other God well I
[1:28:31] know them though I know my daddy and I
[1:28:33] know that the dove it's there's only one
[1:28:37] God and people don't understand that God
[1:28:39] was a father he became a son and now he
[1:28:42] sends his spirit as the Holy Ghost the
[1:28:44] one same person amen and if you can't
[1:28:47] see that he said you're blind he said
[1:28:49] your danger of hellfire because jesus
[1:28:51] builds his church upon the revelation of
[1:28:53] who Jesus is amen
[1:28:55] that's exactly right and program said
[1:28:57] that's the greatest revelation there is
[1:28:59] is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ he
[1:29:01] said that's the first revelation and
[1:29:03] that's the revelation we need for
[1:29:04] salvation do you think God's gonna let
[1:29:07] my daughter into heaven only if they're
[1:29:09] good to the bride that's the only way
[1:29:11] the only way because how can they in
[1:29:14] this age of information also got it
[1:29:16] going on to do his type in Google and
[1:29:18] say is God a Trinity is God three
[1:29:21] persons and you hit the images button
[1:29:23] and you'll pull up the one this wheel
[1:29:25] where all the Scriptures will point to
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ how many ever seen that one
[1:29:30] this we are never seen that okay do you
[1:29:35] want to see it tonight never seen the
[1:29:38] oneness meal okay bear with me here
[1:29:44] that's my youtube channel a lot of
[1:29:48] comments
[1:29:49] make up this week by God's grace so
[1:29:51] we're thankful for that the oneness
[1:29:53] wheel hauls people got to do today I'm
[1:29:56] sorry just go on YouTube airs right
[1:30:01] there that's the oneness wheel every
[1:30:04] scripture points got the Good Shepherd
[1:30:05] it goes Old Testament New Testament
[1:30:07] Jesus God the Redeemer Old Testament who
[1:30:10] doesn't God the Creator Jesus coming
[1:30:11] Jesus the rock Jesus first and last
[1:30:13] Jesus the I am and I am he Jesus the
[1:30:17] King Jesus the Shepherd Jesus the
[1:30:19] Redeemer and Savior Jesus the creator
[1:30:20] god is coming God the rock God the first
[1:30:22] in the last God said I am he God is the
[1:30:24] king God is the Shepherd all these
[1:30:26] things God in the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:30:28] Christ of the new praise God if they
[1:30:30] can't see that they're blind if they
[1:30:32] don't want to see it they're idolaters
[1:30:34] and the only way to get to heaven then
[1:30:36] is to be good to the bride because
[1:30:38] they've turned down the truth for what a
[1:30:40] lie and see what they're gonna do Church
[1:30:44] they're gonna unite around this Trinity
[1:30:46] or some other thing but that's gonna be
[1:30:48] part of it has to because the Prophet
[1:30:50] said that's part of the mark of the
[1:30:51] beast right the mark in the head he said
[1:30:55] is the doctrine of the false church
[1:30:57] Trinity doctrine just like the Trinity
[1:31:01] Broadcasting Network right Trinity they
[1:31:05] love this false lights a false teaching
[1:31:07] it's not there God never said I'm three
[1:31:09] persons he said I'm the only one there's
[1:31:10] nobody else beside me but see that's
[1:31:14] what they're gonna unite around and it's
[1:31:15] gonna look so pretty brother Adam the
[1:31:17] bank is gonna look so nice oh we all
[1:31:19] believe God praise God the Father Son
[1:31:21] and Holy Ghost but behind that is some
[1:31:24] lustful desires they still got because
[1:31:26] the Bible said they turn the truth of
[1:31:28] God into unrighteousness so see we all
[1:31:31] believe this we're all united in rouen
[1:31:33] but we all like to cuss or we all like
[1:31:35] to lust and we all like to have our big
[1:31:39] money in our big buildings rather than
[1:31:40] doing the right thing did you know
[1:31:41] there's a famous woman preacher and she
[1:31:44] spent $20,000 on one toilet in her house
[1:31:47] and it's not me you can look it up it's
[1:31:51] online because the government
[1:31:52] investigated them a few years ago
[1:31:57] $20,000 on a commode
[1:31:59] it's right there you can I'll take it to
[1:32:01] you if you want to see it this is how
[1:32:03] and see they can all unite around what
[1:32:05] women can cut their hair women can
[1:32:07] preach but we all believe in Jesus we're
[1:32:09] all going to heaven that's nonsense to
[1:32:12] deny the Word of God is to deny Christ
[1:32:14] Jesus said when you got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:16] he leads you into all the truth of the
[1:32:18] Bible is that right and by their fruits
[1:32:22] you shall know them so does that help by
[1:32:28] God's grace if you want to copy that I
[1:32:30] can print one off right after church I
[1:32:31] just got a printer right here I'll send
[1:32:33] it to Wi-Fi on print on the Wi-Fi okay
[1:32:35] if this doesn't prove God's one then
[1:32:38] people are just blind so where they
[1:32:40] gonna unite under this lie the Trinity
[1:32:44] oh that's okay I'll right by God's grace
[1:32:47] I don't know what I was into my notes
[1:32:49] gotta go look that up on the Internet so
[1:32:50] that must have been to help somebody
[1:32:51] here tonight that's when I first saw
[1:32:53] Simon getting out when I first came in
[1:32:54] the message I'm like oh yeah God's one I
[1:32:56] can see that now God never said I'm
[1:32:57] three persons he's three manifestations
[1:33:01] but he's one person because the word
[1:33:04] manifestation is in the Bible the Bible
[1:33:06] said God was manifest in the flesh and
[1:33:08] the Bible said the manifestation of the
[1:33:10] Spirit is given a prophet every man with
[1:33:12] all so the Holy Spirit manifestation of
[1:33:14] God
[1:33:15] the son is the manifestation of God and
[1:33:16] the father is God the invisible spirit
[1:33:20] right okay I know I said a lot there so
[1:33:25] try to slow down okay now now putting
[1:33:30] different colors on here because this is
[1:33:31] important and I've been saying this but
[1:33:33] I want to go over this now we find out
[1:33:35] what he said I said before you know open
[1:33:36] door I don't care how many manmade
[1:33:37] organizations comes up or denominations
[1:33:39] even the gates of hell can't shut it
[1:33:42] only way to beat it is to join it he's
[1:33:48] talking about this Jesus name in Jesus
[1:33:49] baptism and one God some about the
[1:33:52] oneness of God in other words that's all
[1:33:55] you can't join it so you have to be born
[1:33:57] into it right so there's nobody could
[1:34:00] ever stop that message of the supreme
[1:34:02] deity and the baptism in the name of
[1:34:04] Jesus Christ the gates of Hell will
[1:34:07] never prevail against it now you say how
[1:34:10] do you know that's right brother branham
[1:34:11] how do you know that's a
[1:34:13] revelation I love this simple answer he
[1:34:16] says it's exactly with the word how do
[1:34:20] you know you're right how do you know
[1:34:21] you got the message in our I know it's
[1:34:23] the mystery of God because it's written
[1:34:24] plainly here in the Bible that's how I
[1:34:27] know how do brother ran no he didn't say
[1:34:31] a vision he didn't say a dream he didn't
[1:34:33] say because I'm so perfect or I'm so
[1:34:34] holy
[1:34:35] he said because it's the Word of God
[1:34:37] amen it's the word it's not a man's idea
[1:34:41] it's God's idea no one else can say
[1:34:45] nothing about it exactly it's the word
[1:34:47] there's no place where anybody was
[1:34:49] baptized in the titles father only goes
[1:34:51] because 10 days after Jesus said that
[1:34:53] Peter baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ so if you have not been baptized
[1:34:59] in the name of Jesus Christ you need to
[1:35:01] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] yeah I was I was baptized father son
[1:35:06] Holy Ghost but as soon as I saw that I
[1:35:07] got rebaptised in the name of Jesus
[1:35:10] Christ hallelujah this great Saint Paul
[1:35:15] the angel of emphasis commissioned every
[1:35:17] person that had not been baptized in
[1:35:19] Acts chapter 19 no matter how you been
[1:35:21] baptized if you never been baptized the
[1:35:24] name of Jesus Christ he commissioned you
[1:35:25] to come and be baptized over again in
[1:35:27] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:28] he said if an angel from heaven comes
[1:35:30] teaching anything else let him be
[1:35:32] accursed so you can see what the angel
[1:35:35] that comes in this last days hallelujah
[1:35:38] what kind of message he's gonna have
[1:35:39] when he comes we may be leading up to
[1:35:42] him but I'm telling you when he comes
[1:35:44] he'll preached the baptism in the name
[1:35:45] of Jesus Christ if you don't believe it
[1:35:47] you come around tomorrow night he said
[1:35:49] let me show you through the scripture he
[1:35:51] certainly will and the circumcision of
[1:35:53] the heart the divine miracles the
[1:35:54] workings of the powers just like they
[1:35:57] had on the day of Pentecost the very
[1:36:00] original apostolic blessing will come
[1:36:02] right back to that little remnant to
[1:36:05] take it up yonder in the rapture amen
[1:36:09] this is God's plan he's got to bring
[1:36:12] people back from where they were at the
[1:36:13] beginning he's got to restore that same
[1:36:15] teaching right back at the end time in
[1:36:17] order to take his wife off the earth
[1:36:20] that contract will be just exactly like
[1:36:22] it was when it was tore off in the first
[1:36:24] way Oh
[1:36:26] how I love him no look oh I'm so glad so
[1:36:29] glad I can't express it hardly I'm so
[1:36:31] glad that like I can say I'm one of them
[1:36:33] I just wish all my brethren was like
[1:36:37] that I just wish that I could have my
[1:36:39] brothers and sisters out here my
[1:36:41] precious friends out in the world to see
[1:36:43] this great thing don't you church I'd
[1:36:45] give anything for that my heart bleeds
[1:36:47] for that when I start praying my heart
[1:36:49] bleeds God can you help somebody see
[1:36:51] this why can't people see this I'd give
[1:36:56] anything to get people to see that they
[1:36:58] need to be baptized in Jesus Christ's
[1:37:00] name and then you know that Jesus is God
[1:37:03] in the flesh not a second person but God
[1:37:06] in the flesh he's the image of the
[1:37:09] invisible person makes him the person it
[1:37:12] makes him the person of God about cease
[1:37:14] Express image of his person in Hebrews
[1:37:17] 1:3 he said I'd be willing tonight God
[1:37:20] knows I got a little boy Joseph to raise
[1:37:22] a little girl Sarah Rebecca lovely wife
[1:37:24] I'd hate to leave but if I know that my
[1:37:27] brother and the people that I know in
[1:37:28] this world could accept that believe
[1:37:30] that and be filled the Holy Ghost I'd be
[1:37:31] ready to go right now he says I'd be
[1:37:33] ready to die if that would make more
[1:37:35] people come to know this truth I'd
[1:37:38] sacrifice myself how many would say amen
[1:37:40] to that
[1:37:41] I would sacrifice myself in order that
[1:37:43] other people might see this truth
[1:37:48] hallelujah that's real that's real
[1:37:49] belief right there that's real love same
[1:37:51] thing Paul said Paul said I wish I was
[1:37:53] cursed that my brethren could see the
[1:37:55] Word of God Oh hallelujah are you so
[1:37:59] glad you're one of them Church are you
[1:38:00] glad are you glad tonight I'm so glad I
[1:38:03] can say I'm one of them Laurie
[1:38:07] hallelujah that's exactly right we ought
[1:38:09] to be glad or some of those Holy Ghost
[1:38:11] field Saints praise God
[1:38:13] we're not ashamed this kind of preaching
[1:38:14] we love this kind of preaching amen
[1:38:16] the world needs more of this kind of
[1:38:19] preaching that preaching I'm talking
[1:38:20] about not me
[1:38:21] that preaching the Word of God I'm just
[1:38:24] thankful I get the preacher by God's
[1:38:25] grace and I give my life to nothing else
[1:38:27] than to preach the Word of God he said
[1:38:32] all he said if you could if I could just
[1:38:34] and you can't look at he says he's tried
[1:38:36] he said if you talk to them gentle they
[1:38:39] think you're trying to push something
[1:38:40] over on them I've had it where I talk to
[1:38:42] people and I say well God sent a prophet
[1:38:44] they say you mean are you a Mormon you
[1:38:51] see and that's how it is Loran says if I
[1:38:53] talk to people real gentle they think
[1:38:54] you're trying to trick him into
[1:38:55] something so he says and there's only
[1:39:00] one thing you can do stay with the word
[1:39:02] and nail it down and that's exactly
[1:39:07] right just stay with it don't try to be
[1:39:08] real gentle and because the Mormons do
[1:39:10] that the Latter day Saints do that just
[1:39:14] stand with the Word of God now you have
[1:39:16] to like that I'm just saying like we
[1:39:20] don't have to put anything on we just
[1:39:21] have to say what the word says if
[1:39:22] they're a child of God they'll come to
[1:39:24] God amen nobody can pluck him out of my
[1:39:26] father's hand all the father given me
[1:39:28] has come to me praise God we just got to
[1:39:30] stay encouraged because we're in an hour
[1:39:31] when very few are gonna come we just

[1:39:35] brother that was here
[1:39:36] thank God Jose's here house let's be
[1:39:38] encouraged maybe God will send another
[1:39:39] amen some five years or ten years down
[1:39:42] the road but I'm willing to wait until
[1:39:44] God sends them because I'm just gonna
[1:39:47] stand on the Word of God like by Toll
[1:39:51] Brothers vague I said I thought we gonna
[1:39:52] have a lot more soul saying than this in
[1:39:54] the last 11 years but we do have the
[1:39:57] souls that God wants saved amen because
[1:39:59] God can't lose one exactly oh I said if
[1:40:04] I could okay I'm sorry I forgot to
[1:40:06] delete this sorry I wanted to eat that
[1:40:09] off because I want to make more room and
[1:40:10] a revelation himself has supreme needed
[1:40:12] what did he do it I just can't leave it
[1:40:14] somehow he revealed it in the church at
[1:40:16] Ephesus and I remember our message is
[1:40:19] the restoration of the original
[1:40:20] apostolic message so Jesus revealed his
[1:40:23] name to Paul right and now and then I
[1:40:27] got took away by the fourth church age
[1:40:29] but here in the sixth and seventh Jesus
[1:40:31] gives a lap over and he's gonna reveal
[1:40:33] his name to both ages especially at the
[1:40:36] end before he comes to raptures bride is
[1:40:40] that right and that was when the light
[1:40:42] first broke through to shine the
[1:40:43] Christian light the Holy Ghost Age
[1:40:45] started right here and Ephesus amen
[1:40:48] I'm getting that where I'm almost
[1:40:49] running close and this is almost this is
[1:40:51] almost a new thought it's right here
[1:40:52] here's the noose up yeah I think this is
[1:40:58] the next news no I'm sorry it's almost
[1:41:00] here almost now he says I've set the
[1:41:02] open door I have the keys he's talking
[1:41:06] like Jesus I'm the only one can open it
[1:41:08] I'm the only one can reveal it Jesus has
[1:41:10] the keys is that right
[1:41:12] there no man can come to me except my
[1:41:14] father draws them and all the father's
[1:41:15] give me will come to me
[1:41:16] no man can be saved only through Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ not through any Church any
[1:41:21] organization any bishop or Pope just
[1:41:24] through Jesus Christ he has the key he's
[1:41:27] the only one that can the keys of what
[1:41:29] David the future coming millennium where
[1:41:32] he'll set on the throne of David amen I
[1:41:35] have the keys of David I open this door
[1:41:37] nobody can shut it nobody can open it
[1:41:39] but me and nobody can shut it to me so
[1:41:44] here here's another visual now look I
[1:41:46] slid off I'm sorry I assumed out and now
[1:41:49] we see thyatira sardis Lucia here's the
[1:41:52] rapture here's the tribulation here's
[1:41:55] the money um everybody see that
[1:41:56] the Jesus they lost Jesus name here in
[1:41:59] Thyatira Jesus restores the name the
[1:42:02] baptism the deity of Christ he restores
[1:42:04] that here at the end of the Philadelphia
[1:42:06] Church age and he tells them I had the
[1:42:09] keys to millennium because look we're
[1:42:10] knocking on the door of the Millennium
[1:42:12] Church are you with me it's the last two
[1:42:14] ages it's the last few ages last few
[1:42:17] years right before the Millennium so
[1:42:19] Jesus reminds them I've got the key
[1:42:20] folks bride I've got the key I'm packing
[1:42:24] your responsibility on my shoulder and I
[1:42:26] got the open door to the Millennium and
[1:42:28] I'm gonna take you if you're faithful
[1:42:30] and keep my word glory he tells them
[1:42:34] right before the rapture right before
[1:42:35] the Millennium I'm gonna take you in the
[1:42:37] money I'm honey
[1:42:38] I'm bringing to you I got the keys to
[1:42:41] your millennium honeymoon uh what I can

[1:42:57] you'll be given a crown of life amen
[1:42:59] glory is it's right at the door
[1:43:02] or okay now here's the thought where he
[1:43:09] brings in now the open door that's
[1:43:10] revealed here now not only is it the
[1:43:12] name of Jesus in Baptism not only is it
[1:43:15] the supreme deity but now all that leads
[1:43:17] you to up the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:20] here's the next go this is the I never
[1:43:23] knew this before this was all fresh to
[1:43:24] me today so to me it's fresh revelation
[1:43:27] and I'm so very thankful for like
[1:43:30] brother Branham said so he reads a
[1:43:32] scripture he reason this is a scripture
[1:43:33] this is a revelation 3:9 there's a good
[1:43:40] night full right there so he said you
[1:43:41] could preach a whole night on that
[1:43:42] scripture you could watch what are they
[1:43:44] now then that he talked to that he had
[1:43:47] found his name after all this time here
[1:43:49] down there come in the open door Jesus
[1:43:52] Christ
[1:43:53] he said they got the Word of Life and
[1:43:55] been filled with the Holy Ghost and now
[1:43:59] he said those are there are those among
[1:44:01] you who are in the synagogue of Satan so
[1:44:04] let me go back there so all this time
[1:44:08] they didn't have a name and Jesus was
[1:44:09] bearing with him bearing with him Mary
[1:44:10] with him but finally he gives you the
[1:44:12] name and now that you got the name now
[1:44:14] you can be baptized in the name now you
[1:44:16] can believe there's one name to God and
[1:44:17] now there's a way to get back to the
[1:44:19] Holy Ghost amen but had been hitting all
[1:44:22] those ages but now at the end time he
[1:44:25] opens the door and said come on in to
[1:44:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to
[1:44:29] come through my name you got to come
[1:44:30] through the revelation of who I am oh
[1:44:33] thank you Jesus
[1:44:35] see I never saw the open door as the
[1:44:37] Holy Ghost until I read this message
[1:44:38] again I listened to it two or three
[1:44:40] times and I never saw this was the Holy
[1:44:42] Ghost connection until I read through it
[1:44:44] today so I was very thankful for that
[1:44:45] and I'm still not done here right here
[1:44:49] I'd had none here's a thought on the
[1:44:52] sleep inversion church so pay attention
[1:44:53] right because here tonight by God's
[1:44:56] grace we're a how many versions of the
[1:44:57] word how many are pure to the word all
[1:45:00] she do is live the word that makes you a
[1:45:01] virgin to the Word of God when you're
[1:45:03] separating away from the things of the
[1:45:04] world now you're a virgin you're yeah
[1:45:06] you have no you have no intercourse with
[1:45:08] the world all you do is have intercourse
[1:45:10] with Christ all you do is have a contact
[1:45:13] and fellowship with Christ
[1:45:16] he said let me break in the mornings
[1:45:18] message that's the sleeping version
[1:45:20] right there can you see it
[1:45:21] when was it at the end time oh when they
[1:45:23] went out see they are justified by faith
[1:45:26] sanctified justified through Luther's
[1:45:29] message sanctified through here but they
[1:45:31] miss the what open door no that's the
[1:45:35] baptism of Holy Ghost he just mentioned
[1:45:37] in the previous paragraph so people in
[1:45:40] this day they can go through
[1:45:42] justification sanctification but they've
[1:45:43] got to go through the open door amen
[1:45:46] which is filling your soul with the Holy
[1:45:48] Ghost amen
[1:45:49] and if you got the Holy Ghost she'll be
[1:45:51] full of life you'll be full of power
[1:45:53] you'll be full of joy you'll be full of
[1:45:55] faith you'll be full of long-suffering
[1:45:56] you'll be full of the fruits of the Holy
[1:45:58] Spirit hallelujah that's exactly right
[1:46:01] you see justified by faith through
[1:46:03] Luther sanctified through Wesley's
[1:46:05] message now here's the new thing this is
[1:46:08] all new to me this right here brother
[1:46:11] Bram said now there's another open door
[1:46:13] at the end of the day overseen church
[1:46:15] age I never knew this I knew there was
[1:46:18] open door in the Philadelphia Church age
[1:46:20] but I never knew there was an open door
[1:46:21] in art in other words I never knew that
[1:46:24] open door extended and made a kept open
[1:46:28] longer for the rapture so this is new to
[1:46:31] me now this is the quote paragraph 256
[1:46:35] and now this great temptation the hour
[1:46:37] of temptation that should come upon to
[1:46:39] try the whole world goes into the
[1:46:41] tribulation just in a few minutes we'll
[1:46:43] see it it goes on in the tribulation and
[1:46:46] the tribulation did not come in the days
[1:46:48] of Wesley so we agree so what age are we
[1:46:51] in what's this door said before it's
[1:46:53] where the church is headed right now and
[1:46:56] already in to the lair to see a church
[1:46:58] age so see this this promise lapped over
[1:47:00] this promise carried over from
[1:47:02] Philadelphia
[1:47:03] into the lair scene Church age but this
[1:47:07] little place right in here now here it
[1:47:09] is within the last 35 or 40 years has
[1:47:14] been an open door setting right before
[1:47:15] the people to come in and God will take
[1:47:18] the remnant and seal it off why did
[1:47:21] brother Branham say the last 35 or 40
[1:47:23] years because the Assemblies of God
[1:47:25] organized around 1920
[1:47:28] and this was 1960 so brother bands
[1:47:32] pointing out God started a revival but
[1:47:35] when they organized God said fine I'm
[1:47:37] done with you I'm opening a door of
[1:47:39] faith to the Gentiles sure I'm opening a
[1:47:46] door because they've closed the door
[1:47:48] denomination so Jesus says I'm gonna
[1:47:50] open the door to the last day Gentile
[1:47:53] bride and see I didn't know that I
[1:47:55] didn't know he said it like that and
[1:47:57] they'll go on into a lukewarm and it
[1:48:00] them out of his mouth the work will be
[1:48:02] cut short up goes the church and here
[1:48:04] comes the Antichrist moving in for
[1:48:06] destruction just perfect fits with the
[1:48:08] whole Bible right on around okay so
[1:48:12] here's a different picture this is just
[1:48:15] from 1900 to the year 2000 and now here
[1:48:18] we are we're over here like in 2017 so
[1:48:22] this was the time the prophet of God
[1:48:24] lived he lived from 1906 to 1965 now the
[1:48:31] open door of the last program said 35 or
[1:48:34] 40 years would have been from 1920 40
[1:48:36] years to 1960 so this open door must
[1:48:41] still be open today
[1:48:42] since the rapture hasn't occurred yet
[1:48:45] it's there but I understand what I'm
[1:48:46] saying after the Pentecost was
[1:48:48] denominated after Azusa Street they set
[1:48:51] the Assembly of God God said fine I'm
[1:48:53] gonna leave that Pentecostal group and
[1:48:55] I'm going to get myself a bride for the
[1:48:57] rapture with the open door of who Jesus
[1:49:00] is his name in baptism and the baptism
[1:49:03] of the Holy Ghost are they do you praise
[1:49:06] God that's exactly right now this last
[1:49:10] one look here's the last here's the last
[1:49:13] 40 or 60 years here okay it's this last
[1:49:16] one I'm sorry it's kind of hard to see
[1:49:17] well program preached this around 1960
[1:49:20] so he would have preached it right here
[1:49:21] he said the last 30 or 45 years it's
[1:49:24] been an open door and that open door has
[1:49:27] to keep going because the rapture hasn't
[1:49:29] taken place yet does that help by God's
[1:49:31] grace I just wanted you to see that I
[1:49:34] never knew that since they denominated
[1:49:36] makes sense they closed the door on
[1:49:37] Christ they said Christ can no longer
[1:49:39] get in and yet they were the ones who
[1:49:41] have the revival
[1:49:42] so Jesus just said that's fine I'm gonna
[1:49:44] go ahead and open a door for my Gentile
[1:49:46] bride
[1:49:47] she's got my name she's got my baptism
[1:49:50] she knows who I am I'm the one person of
[1:49:53] God and she's got the door to the
[1:49:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:56] they send our feet by God's grace I
[1:49:58] never knew that before so today there's
[1:50:02] been an open door and that's the open
[1:50:04] door
[1:50:05] since the Zeus's tree turned him down
[1:50:07] now we have so closing I hope you feel
[1:50:14] the same way but I can say this I'm more
[1:50:16] thankful for the open door the Holy
[1:50:18] Ghost baptism than anything on this
[1:50:23] Thanksgiving Eve I would say thank you
[1:50:25] Lord for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:28] I'm more thankful for that than anything
[1:50:30] I know up because remember I'm going
[1:50:32] back to this Court I used earlier
[1:50:33] oh then great mysteries that God would
[1:50:37] read begin the real the open door was a
[1:50:39] great mystery I think that was a great
[1:50:41] mystery to me I never knew that I never
[1:50:45] knew God had to carry over that open
[1:50:48] door because they denominated you they
[1:50:49] carry that open door
[1:50:50] well his baptism Horus person and for
[1:50:54] his Holy Ghost
[1:50:55] because then close the door on I never
[1:50:57] knew that as all those little things in
[1:51:01] there how God did so marvelously make
[1:51:02] them real to us
[1:51:04] churches are real to us tonight now for
[1:51:07] us it might not be real tonight because
[1:51:09] we've already heard it before but how
[1:51:11] many can say Lord I'm so glad it's real
[1:51:12] to me tonight that I know I've got to go
[1:51:15] through the open door of the baptism in
[1:51:18] jesus christ's name to know that Jesus
[1:51:20] is God and then I need to have this
[1:51:22] spirit fill me in my soul I'm more basic
[1:51:26] and for which we are very very thankful
[1:51:30] what thankful mean honest my life slide
[1:51:33] I just copied and pasted from Internet
[1:51:34] so I'm not selling this so no copyright
[1:51:37] laws apply to be honest but this first
[1:51:40] definition is conscience of your benefit

[1:52:04] Security benefit yeah
[1:52:08] he has advantages because he was a part
[1:52:11] of the system you and I have an
[1:52:15] advantages because we're part of all

[1:52:20] the mind of God chosen in Christ before
[1:52:23] the foundation of the world and we got
[1:52:26] that fence amen
