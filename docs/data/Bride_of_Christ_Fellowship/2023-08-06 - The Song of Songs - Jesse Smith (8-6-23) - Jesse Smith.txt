========================================

you know what the wedding coming up I just thought I'd preach on love today so amen my title is the song of songs by God's grace amen yeah that's kind of what's on my mind I'm sure it's all of our minds and um that's what brother Ram says the whole world wants is love praise God and of course that's the love of Jesus Christ when two are married that are Christians and they experience that love as well praise God in a marriage relationship so I want to preach on the song of songs we'll be spending some time and of course The Book Song of Solomon um but we'll start here because the whole purpose of marriage of course is to be a foreshadow of Christ and the church praise God so we're very thankful for that I'm sure if you're married you see that in your marriage amen I know I do in mine and Jesus Christ of course is called the bridegroom and his church is called the bride Hallelujah so let's read that one we can read verse 39 or 29 rather together and then I want to go to Song of Solomon uh chapter one after this let's read verse 29 if we can ready one two three he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled this is John the Baptist saying my joy is fulfilled I'm the friend of the bridegroom Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the bridegroom and his people are the bride Hallelujah and I love that he rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice how many love the voice of Jesus Amen Lorena said if he ever speaks to you it'll be a scriptural voice yes amen it'll light up with everything that's already been said in the word of God praise God let's go to Song of Songs chapter 1 verse one you know this book is a lot like the Book of Esther whereas you know some people will debate is you know should it be in the Bible and is it Inspire of course God allowed these two books Esther and Song of Solomon to be in the Bible because they were inspired of the holy spirit in any spiritual mind would be able to see that but we'll just read verses um one through four by God's grace I'll read these you know because they're a little bit longer here the song of songs which is Solomon's let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than Wine because of the savior of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee his name is like ointment with a wonderful smell that's what his name is like verse 4 draw me I love these words here draw me the woman is speaking Draw Me Lord we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his Chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we remember that I love more than Wine the upright love thee amen let's have one more word of prayer if I need on your heart let's just make a known unto God here today Heavenly Father we thank you God for this opportunity to be in your house Lord God we thank you for these songs that we sing Lord Jesus brings us into your presence Lord God hallelujah you're our savior our friend our our King but you're also God hallelujah so we thank you God that you would condescend to people of low estate like us but then Lord let your spirit abide in us and raise us up into spiritual Heavenly places Lord God making us Kings and Priests unto God but also Lord ultimately the bride of Christ the Lord God we're so thankful for this Revelation from your Bible and Lord God anoint me today God just use my lips and my mind dear God I just want to glorify you Jesus we just want to be in a rejoicing happy joyful State Lord as the wedding ears Lord God this Saturday so we thank you for your mercy anoint us now Lord each one of us in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I just want to review a little bit on the Song of Solomon but if you have your Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter one we'll just read a few verses here about the beginning here and boy could our current sinful Society learn a lesson from Genesis chapter one that God makes them male and female praise God Genesis chapter 1. verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now brother Graham tells us when God first made Adam and Eve they were in the spirit form Hallelujah like your soul form and they were one Spirit together Adam was one one part and Eve was another part and then of course God put flesh upon that spirit that Soul or maybe there's two souls in there now that I think about it and it was just one person it was just Adam the first Adam praise God we know Christ is the last Adam Hallelujah and then we know as the Bible says here uh but before that let's I'll read verse 28 and God bless them and God said them be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Hallelujah verse 31 and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening in the morning were the sixth day Hallelujah all right now we go down later in chapter two if you have your Bible there to chapter 15. uh Genesis 2 verse 15 and the Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so even in a perfect world God made man a worker right I heard a good podcast from Brother Jason Demars and he was saying you young man he said you need to learn how to work with your hands that's a good lesson he said and he kind of made a joke he said I'm the only one in the church that doesn't work with my hands that's kind of like me I work at a desk you know and with the children I guess I work with my hands I work a little bit but you know we got our we got plumbers and electricians and all kinds of things and uh construction workers but you know when God had a perfect world he had man work with his hands and I just like Jason's uh he was kind of just admonishing the young men don't get addicted to video games don't get addicted to uh you know just watching screens all day get out there and work with your hands do something praise God Amen build something because God called you to build something praise God right amen that's what the man was called to do and he was also supposed to subdue it he's supposed to overcome it praise God right he was supposed to run to the problems like last night I was trying to run to our stove and fix the stove right Emma is a lot of clanking and banging going around I didn't I got a little bit accomplished but not a lot I'll see what I can do tonight by God's grace uh and tomorrow maybe but you know as men that's what men are called to do they're called to run to the problem they're called to subdue it uh of course they you know that's what God's called us to do uh verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden that thou mayest really eat but of the tree of knowledge Good and Evil I shall not eat of it for the day that thou shalt I'm sorry but for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die all right now of course and then Adam gives the names to all the creatures again he's led by the Holy Spirit he gives them the names and verse 21 and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of the ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man's of course this is a beautiful uh story about how Eve is a part of Adam she's completely a part of Adam Hallelujah and God uh God made Adam's help mate from himself she was a part of him originally praise God and then in the original creation brother van tells us it was just Adam right it was just Adam and Eve as one Spirit they were one entity and then God separated them Hallelujah and you know we have numerous uh audio dramas right and then the Audio Drama Adam falls asleep and then after the surgery Adam wakes up and then he hears a sweet voice say Adam and he's like whoa you're beautiful and uh it just it's it's it's it's it's fun you know it's uh entertaining to think about yeah what was that like the first time he saw her and he could feel like you're a part of me you're my other right that you saw the other of the lion the other the giraffe other the bear yeah they all had pears but I don't have a pair where's my other and so Adam wakes up and and in verse 23 we get his exact words it's beautiful he said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh as she became manifested to him right she was inside of him before but now she's manifested and he says she's a part of me I'm one with her praise God she's bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh he should be called woman because she was taken out of man that's what woman means taken out of man because she was taken out of the man verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his mother and his father and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed Hallelujah so this is the word of the Lord so I like how the you know the Bible says even before uh Adam and Eve had a mother right Adam speaks this prophetically Adam no doubt was a prophet he said a a man shall leave his mother and father and then cleave to his wife and that's the word glue right so what's amazing is that they were first together then they're apart but then Adam says we got to be glued back together is that wonderful uh that's how God wants us in our marriages of course that's a great type of Christ in the church the true expression of marriage of course is unity it's it's one uh here Adam says it's one flesh it's one it's one bone right but the ultimate unity is in one Holy Spirit praise God yes and they caught that Hallelujah the Bride of Jesus caught it on the day of Pentecost the Bible said they are in one mind one Accord in one place hallelujah amen and that when the Holy Ghost Falls Church that's what has happened we've all got the same mind we've all got the same desires right we got I got the same intentions right we're all in the same place Hallelujah and then the Holy Ghost can flow and Rush In Like A rushing Mighty Wind Hallelujah oh it's beautiful we see it there two that are really one and they're to be joined one to another so we see uh God's pattern for this here in Genesis chapter one praise God now before we get the song to Solomon go to Jeremiah I just want to read a few verses out of Jeremiah Jeremiah 7 verse 34. as I was texting austinina this morning I said enjoy these moments leading up to your wedding day I I would I give a lot of things if I could go back and relive my wedding day I just I guess I'm sentimental like that brother man said the same thing he talked about the golden days he wished he could go back and live again I'm sure each one of us have days like that we wish we could just go back and live that again that's why we're thankful for cameras and video cameras and photos and oh what was that liking and uh I just said enjoy these moments you know take as many pictures as you can and uh Austin and Lena and and uh you look back on these days and I said it ever since I got married that was the happiest day of my life outside of being saved praise God my wedding day Hallelujah now Jeremiah 7 34 now don't get discouraged on these first three verses okay because Jeremiah is a prophet to warn the people he was the weeping prophet There's Hope at the end though but don't don't be sad at these first few verses here what it was was a warning from the Holy Spirit from Jehovah the husband to Israel the church the bride remember we said we saw that last Sunday that Israel was married to God but God had to divorce them because Israel wouldn't repent of her adulteries and her foreign adulteries and her whoredoms the Bible says but I just want I just want to get you I want you to see a thought out of here Jeremiah 7 34 then when I pause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of Mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride for the land shall be desolate so Jeremiah is warning the people here because of your sins you're no longer going to hear these happy voices in the streets right uh in the city uh the the word mirth means rejoicing or joy and the voice of gladness and so all these happy sounds you're not going to hear these happy sounds and what else is included in there the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride so Jeremiah just lets us know culturally in Israel the happiest times were waiting times and you'd hear the people now you think about how our little ones get so excited for weddings you know they are little girls they talk about being being married in their wedding days and they yeah uh they're all they all get to dress up and they look like little princesses the same was true you know it's amazing how God's pattern doesn't change and God's God's creatures act the same way today Hallelujah in other words the happiest times were wedding times when two individuals become one praise God and love and love is expressed and love love becomes manifested praise God and that's what we ought to see this week Austin and Lena ought to be the happiest people at their respective jobs this week you and I ought to be the happiest people as we go about our errands this week especially Saturday now of course we all be nervous you know one way but you know it ought to be a time of rejoicing praise God right because two like like like like God said it's not good for man to be alone not good for us and me alone so God had to make him a helpmate hallelujah our dear sister it wasn't good that Adam was alone now some are called to it like Paul just always want to bring Bells you know that's kind of my preaching is I always want to break it down Paul said I was I was have the gift to be single and he said I wish more people were single but you know that's his opinion today but God said Adam needs a help make praise God and then when these times were come you know uh the the cities and the streets will be filled with happiness oh it's the big day and uh in those days remember they pray that they prepared for a whole year the Bible said they uh the two fathers with the groom and the bride would make the engagement for one year and then uh the bride really wanted to see the groom for a whole year he'd be out building the house he'd be out preparing a home for his wives Hallelujah and she was just late with anticipation all the preparations would be made and so there'd be such joy in those little Villages you know Ramos Gilead or whoever it was Bethlehem and all the different Villages oh there's a wedding this week There's a wedding this week it was a time of Joy you'd hear people rejoicing praise God you'll be you see people happy Hallelujah amen again we get it in Jeremiah 16 verse 9. so you don't have to read this one but uh why don't you turn to Jeremiah 33 and I'll read two more verses so you turn to Jeremiah 33 10. I'll go to Jeremiah 16 9. for thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel behold I will call us to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of Mirth the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride so God's judgment was going to bring a end to all the joy of weddings also in Jeremiah 25 10 moreover our take from them the voice of Mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the sound of millstones and the light of the candle God's judgment was going to remove their work but not not only their work their way to sustain themselves but it was also going to remove the marriages right but we get this beautiful promise there uh in Jeremiah 33 11. now let's read 10 though yeah there we go thank you honey I see yeah good job uh yeah awesome thus say the Lord again there should be heard in this place where Jesus should say shall be desolate with a man and without Beast even the cities of Judah in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitants and without beasts so go to the next verse so what you've seen is Jeremiah's warning them three times I'm taking out I'm gonna take out all the joy I'm gonna take out all your work in other words I'm gonna allow Nebuchadnezzar and and uh Syria to remove you out of this land there'll be no more happy weddings I mean no more joyful times he says but I will bring it back hallelujah amen I'm gonna take it away because your sins but once you repent of your sins and come back I'm going to bring back the joy I'm going to bring back the rejoicing praise God again you're going to see happy children in the streets Hallelujah you're going to hear about it you're going to hear Happy brides and happy Grooms you know you're going to have it later on I'm giving you hope that it's going to come back praise God he called it the voice of Joy the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voices of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy and do it forever Hallelujah and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord for I will call us to return the Captivity land as at the first saith the Lord amen oh so beautiful so God says I'm going to take all this natural joy out so that you can get your life right spiritually but then when you get right spiritually I'll bring all this natural Joy back praise God amen why because God is good Hallelujah if God was good when he gave Adam and Eve one to another God was good when he gave all you know Esther and the hashmiris God was good Hallelujah and God is good when he gives Christ his bride hallelujah amen in each day each age each generation God is choosing now a bride Hallelujah men amen so let's remember this you know on Saturday let's let's listen especially to Austin's voice and Lena's voice we'll be hearing the voice of gladness right everything they say is gonna be real happy on Saturday right they're going to talk joyful we're going to hear joy and we're gonna hear their voices real happy praise God now just so you know God gave this same rebuke to the Vatican in Revelation 18 23 when they're destroyed with of course the bombs of Russia and the light of the candle shall be no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the uh and of the rise shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy Merchants were the Great Men of the Earth for thy sorceries were all I'm sorry for by thy sorceries We're All Nations deceived so the Vatican it must be in charge with all the merchants praise God right but God says I mean what this is one of the last things he says before uh this chapter closes right which shows one of the greatest joys in life is is marriages right it is weddings praise God is two people becoming one because it manifests it points to what all history is going to what is history going to history is going to the return of Jesus he's returning for his bride amen all it is through the very climax of the of the Gentile of the last two thousand years the climax will be Jesus coming down to Statue and take his wife off the Earth and take her to a wedding ceremony praise God amen amen and a wedding reception Hallelujah so if you would go to Song of Solomon here well let's get a few I'm just going to go over a few verses you know as you're turning that remember there's beautiful love stories in the Bible you know think of Jacob's love he worked 14 years for Rachel and the Bible said just like a few days that's some real love right there I worked 19 years at for copy Fairlawn and they don't feel like well I guess now they feel like a few days but all because of love all because of his love for Rachel 14 years felt just like a few days and we know love is such a great thing praise God Samson had a seven day wedding feast right so we know there were some celebrations if if the families could afford it it would last the whole week think about that all week long vacation just to celebrate one wedding now we kind of squeeze in just a couple hours because we're just life is so busy right there are so many deadlines and so many responsibilities but we also saw on the other side with funerals remember our people was a month that they mourned over Moses they take a whole month to mourn for a funeral takes seven days for a wedding so we see these Great Expressions of love now in uh in the book of Song of Solomon this again this is a very uh debated book but there's numerous themes and and uh I just want to look at just all the all the overall themes of this book um I preached on this back in 2010 I went and looked at my notes back in 2010 so 13 years ago I appreciate the whole book verse five works and just showed as many types as we could now there's a couple of different thoughts you know some people think this book is a love triangle and there's one quote for brother brand where he actually acknowledges that but it's only one quote um but I I think the more close uh description is it's Solomon uh with his first wife that's the that's the interpretation that I can look at and I feel like would be the closest um uh the closest interpretation but we see you know the beginning chapter one we see a couple themes we see a a common girl who's working out in the sun and she's not royalty Glory a woman who's not royalty and she is subjected just to being a Shepherd a lot like Rachel right and she's she's not royalty she's not she hasn't had an easy life but Solomon in his kingdom he looks out on her and he has favor on her and he draws her into his presence praise God in other words she wouldn't be the woman you'd expect that Solomon would choose right but that's what verse 4 says remember uh She was drawn into the king's Chambers a lot like Esther right so we see a lot of similarities here with Esther just drawn into the love of God hallelujah now verse five she said I'm black but calmly oh ye Daughters of Jerusalem as intensive keter those were um these those are Gentile curtains as the curtains of Solomon look not upon me because I'm black because the son had looked upon me my mother's children were angry with me very uh they made me the keeper of The Vineyards but my own Vineyard have I not kept and so you know she in other words she's a little bit uh embarrassed that she's been working out in the sun and she's not uh she's not royalty but you think Solomon cares about that no these These are inhibitions that uh a young woman would have right oh does he really love me am I really good enough let me tell you Church you're good enough for Jesus you're good enough because he paid the price to die on the cross for your sins praise God you're good enough but I love just how this love story it includes all their inner battles right she's like well he loved me uh my mother my family mistreated me how could he how could the king love me when my own family won't love me oh man Hallelujah because God's love is divine love Hallelujah because God doesn't look on the outward appearance man look or God man looks at it but God looks on the heart praise God you saw Wednesday night with eliab Hallelujah the prophet and everybody looked on his outward appearance but God wasn't looking at the outward God was looking at the heart amen Solomon's looking at this woman is lovely right and she loves me and I want to make her my wife Hallelujah so we see that Solomon chooses a a strange Choice it wouldn't be maybe the it wouldn't be the the Top Choice is what we would think now verse eight I like how verse 8 says if thou no not oh thou embarrass among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids besides the Shepherds tits so here Solomon already calls her fairest among women so what was it that Solomon was out around his kingdom something just caught his eye with this woman she was just very special right and is that how it was when you got married as soon as you saw that person that person just caught your eye Hallelujah I remember when first saw Kristen up in the library God's my witness I was too ashamed to look at her just because I was such a nervous person I just stared out at the newspapers it wasn't until somebody had you know you need to call Christian we call her push me into it see God's gonna make sure you marry the right person amen and then I was shocked you don't have a boyfriend now this course said before I was a Christian you know how can this girl not have a boyfriend and so you know God works it out and and so Simon just she just caught Solomon's eye and uh and then he brought her into his Chambers the Bible says hallelujah now what's interesting churches in verse 12. now look at 12 here the woman is daydreaming about their wedding night so the Bible even records that and of course it's a very intimate course of scripture right uh while the king sitteth at his table my spitner sent his forth the smell thereof so she knows she's catching his attention because just like Esther she had to be prepared she had to go through the purification process right and Solomon was a king so just like Esther this shulamite would have had to been prepared and and she would have been purified just the way the king lies amen Hallelujah and your spiritual life is just what Jesus likes Hallelujah your praise your worship your love your Devotion to Christ that's just what he wants praise God hallelujah a life that obeys the word of God a life that once a life that wants to be pure think about that church all these other churches they won't come and be made pure to going to the king but you and I made a choice we come in the friends of the king we've submitted ourselves to the Holy Spirit to be purified to come before King Jesus Hallelujah man I didn't realize how close this would be to the Esther servant from last week I'm just catching it now it's very similar thoughts here now here we get her daydreaming I'm going to skip verse 13 for the sake of our children first 14 my beloved is unto me as a cluster of campfire in The Vineyards of engetti behold our Fair my love Behold our Fair thou has Dove's eyes Behold our Fair my beloved yay Pleasant also our bed is green the beams of our house are Cedar and the Raptors of first so she can already see where they're going to spend so you can see wow and she's daydreaming this is going to be my home someday we're gonna have our honeymoon here so she's already looking about that and look that's what they do and notice they're just complimenting each other you're beautiful you're handsome right right right uh and so that finishes chapter one we see how she's found she's at least likely we'd say bride so are you praise God all right the member saw it last week the Gentiles had no covenants no hope we had no hope but the blood of Jesus Christ has brought us nigh Hallelujah and then they daydream about their married life their their wedding night and then they think about and then they complement each other and they also see uh where their future home is going to be hallelujah amen now chapter two uh begins uh another it's the dreams of a home in the forest so here they're thinking about maybe like uh a getaway maybe this is like a for the honeymoon or something or maybe it's a Solomon had so much money maybe had a home out in the forest but chapter two verse one said I'm the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys as the Lily among Thorns so is my love among the daughters someone says all these other women are like Thorns but you're my Lily you're my special one Hallelujah so I just you know I love it you know uh just the way the Bible describes these are all ways to describe your your spouse you're the special one you're the one that caught my eye you're the one that uh gets all my attention you're the one that touched my heart praise God amen verse 4 let's go down to verse 4. he brought me to the banqueting house and His Banner Over Me his love his flag over me as love you know and then she starts daydreaming again in verses five I'm gonna skip verse six there um in verse 7 so and there's different characters talking but here uh she says I charge the OU dollars to Jerusalem by the rose and by the Hinds of the field that ye Stern not up nor awake my love Tilly please okay so you know we can get some different lessons from this one lesson we can get from this is It's advice to the young uh women that are not engaged yet don't stir up love before it's time right she said don't stir up my love right speaking of Solomon but it's good advice to all the the women don't rush into relationship right right it's a great reminder uh don't live in in sexual immorality right it's a great reminder of these things these things are are they're all laid out in here now look and also of course all this all this descriptive daydreaming and all it has all this all these details but it also gives stern warnings in here uh to live a Godly life praise God to wait upon the Lord now here's where Jesus is typed as dancing or skipping verse 8. where do you learn how to dance brother Jess from Jesus it's in verse 8. the voice of my beloved behold he come he cometh leaping upon the mountains he skipth upon the hills praise God this is how she pictured her husband he just he runs all over the hills and he's just happy the voice of the ride group amen he's just singing on The Hills he just rejoices it's almost our wedding day and brother bear said when he danced around that that tree up there in the Colorado mountains and remember he heard the wolf uh he heard the the different animals howling to their mates he saw him he remember he saw the rainbow through the uh the ice and everything he said oh God you're the god of creation he said I went round and around he said he said I was just like David like David danced before the Lord he said people would have thought I was insane up there running around the tree praise God but now he said I was praising my banker Hallelujah I was praising God I was just like David hallelujah amen I'm skipping around the tree he said that's where we get it Solomon that's what she imagined his voice was like a man up there in the mountains enjoying his his pastures and his uh his planting and his Harvest praise God Amen so this is their dreams now later on in chapter two they have a formal uh banquet and then spring arrives in chapter 2 all right I think I'll skip skip ahead here let's skip ahead here to chapter two I'm sorry chapter three verse 9. I'm going to skip ahead here to the um to the time of of the wedding here by God's grace yeah I must have typed the wrong number there yeah let's go ahead to the wedding here here's where we clearly see in Solomon here marrying the shulamite King Solomon made him a chair of wood of Lebanon he made the pillars there of a silver in the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it a purple the myths thereof being paid with love I like that Hallelujah for the daughters of Jerusalem go forth O ye Daughters of Zion and behold King Solomon with a crown wherewith his mother crown him in the Day of His espousals and the day of the gladness of his heart so we see Solomon coming to the uh the the wedding here he's on a chariot and is paved with love praise God amen amen I'm sure all the roads that Austin's going to drive on Saturday when he when he finally takes lean away they're going to be paid with love aren't they yeah because God is directing God's directing the as they drive away that's their path it's like a type that's their path they're going to go on a journey together serving the lord God's going to guide and direct them praise God because Solomon's way was paid with love Hallelujah their future is paved with the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the love of Christ I love all the symbolism in here Hallelujah now I want to um look at a few verses in here yeah chapter four here uh we see is like the wedding night here the wedding and the wedding night now in chapter four uh the bride I'm sorry the bridegroom Solomon starts describing the woman and he and he starts from the head all the way down to the feet he describes almost nearly every body part of her and then he says verse 7 thou are all fair my love there's no spot in thee at church we all know we have flaws in ourselves right we all got scars I got we got birthmarks but this is love talking this is love saying no matter what you are I love everything about you praise God because you're mine Hallelujah that's what love does that's what marriage does looks past all of our faults right and rejoices that we have a spouse that we have someone to love praise God right I mean think about the woman you know the shulamite she's out there working with the the Sheep all day you know surely she had to get scratched or scars or something you know maybe she had to fight off a lion or bear or something she would not have just had it we'd say a perfect body right but in in his eyes in your spouse's eyes we ought to love everything about our spouse praise God that's what I preach at the marriage banquet over there in Pennsylvania you know especially with men men and men are tempted to you know look elsewhere and be distracted but I told them you got to make your wife the most beautiful one and you got to keep your attention on your wife praise God Hallelujah and I know part of that goes the man's got to take care of his body he's got to stay healthy the woman should take care of her body too praise God you want your spouse to make uh to think you're beautiful then you're enhance him that you ought to act like a praise God all right don't let yourself go to waste why would you let the temple of God be destroyed praise God right why would you defile purposely to file and not maintain the Temple of the Lord praying it's God's Temple praise God Hallelujah but that that's what love should be I love everything about you praise God hallelujah like I told my wife many times she said honey you just get more beautiful with each passing year I do tell her that I believe that's true that's true Hallelujah that's to me that's just my my desire I believe that verse 9. I like this that must ravish my heart my sister my spouse see when a man is fully in love with that woman everything's great about her right so right now Lena has no Faults in Austin's eyes there's nothing she's all perfect Hallelujah because his his heart's been ravished his heart's been won praise God this is the one I'm gonna love Hallelujah thus ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thyness just one of them just if you look if I just saw one of your eyes and you're you're sideways if I just saw one of your eyes it just grabs all my attention that's all it takes is one little look and you got my attention how fair is the smell of thine ointments than all spices and again goes through some descriptive Parts here um in verse 16 Solomon calls his wife a garden okay so here we see the wedding night and then in chapter five verse one he says I'm coming to my garden my sister my spouse and then notice at the end of verse 1 and chapter five oh friends drink ye or drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved so here we get another admonition when a couple gets married they need to stay in love right Simon's a newly married man and yet someone speaks in this in this letter and says you who are married stay in love praise God enjoy love abundantly praise God right Hallelujah in other words don't let things separate your love right I'm talking kind of Broad in general so you know what I'm talking about now keep your spot there but Paul says the same thing in First Corinthians 7 let's read that that just came to my mind a different to have that prepared First Corinthians 7. verse one now concerning the things wherever he wrote unto me it is not I'm sorry it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless avoid fornication every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband Render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband so the husband and wife give each other over to one another right verse four the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body but the wife okay so this is what they're saying in Song of Solomon keep the love alive praise God a but enjoy it enjoy married life abundantly that's what the Bible says right right verse five now defraud means to Rob so Paul says Rob not to one another so married couples sometimes if they're not careful can rob one another in this way right the Bible says don't do that except it be with consent for a time so it should only be agreed upon right Song of Solomon says drink abundantly right do this uh show express love to one another abundantly and then Paul says do it abundantly he said he said Keep Your Love alive always keep your love alive and only stay apart when it's consented unto prayer and fasting okay prayer fasting that's what it says in verse 5. that ye may give yourselves to fasting in prayer and come together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency so see again a lesson we learned there if a couple is not staying in love or uh loving abundantly then Satan can get in there right right so it's it's quite I mean think about that and the Bible says if a man don't treat his wife well his prayers will be hindered so there's so many things spiritually going on that can just be solved if a couple just stays in love amen right Hallelujah right you get so many more spiritual victories if we just stay in Love by God's grace that's just maybe the way I'll say it for today Hallelujah yes there we go verse five Hallelujah now verse six but I speak this by permission and not by commandment now he might say permission but that's a real good permission right there that's a pretty wise permission and I'll just say this I'm gonna try to say this very broadly honey we have a we have friends that are going through a difficult marriage situation I'm gonna try to say this is Brownies okay and the struggles they've gone through are so extreme uh it's it's almost unbelievable to know what they're going through mainly because one person has been unfaithful I think that maybe that's the best and just in so many ways so many ways and uh and it has just cause my wife and I to really appreciate God's grace in our lives right right and I said this before you know over the pulpit there's nothing like loyal love that's why Psalm of Solomon is written there is no love like the love between one man and one woman married right and I just want to share that we have you know it's just been hard to hard to explain the pain that is caused when a person is unfaithful right I mean people will suffer for every day every day they'll suffer I mean weeks on end months every day is uncertain it's going to be a divorce what's going to happen I mean everything's uncertain things and and people have thoughts they never thought about why because the devil got in there right right they didn't keep the vows that they promised that's why we're gonna go make vows next week hallelujah we're gonna have you guys make vows that's that's what it's all about the promise and you're promising we're going to be true to another so God can remain in your marriage and God can bless your family Hallelujah you can overcome Satan that's one great way to overcome Satan is by staying in love with your spouse praise God mm-hmm you know and I've had numerous preachers that's why they've had me preach the marriage Banquets numerous preachers tell me Jesse we love that you love your wife and the way you do and that's why we want you to come and preach to our men about how to love their wives so I don't know I'll say all I know is that when I was growing up my parents were divorced and all I wanted was a happy marriage that's all I wanted I just wanted someone to love me that's all I just wanted a happy marriage and I told you that testimony before right when I called the message my only prayer was Lord I want the Holy Ghost and Lord please let me be married a little while before the Rapture so I can enjoy it I can enjoy married life because I just wanted to know what that was like and God's given me 20 years Hallelujah but but to understand that that's what the song of Solomon's all about [Applause] now that's a natural love but we know there's a song greater than that that's the love of Jesus Christ praise God Amen but for the Old Testament they put it in there to show love is one is one of the greatest things they put it it was the greatest thing but of course what they meant was Christ and the church right because brother bam said we know what every scripture points to Jesus so the song of songs is that a king chose you to be his bride amen that's the song or song we didn't deserve it we were out there we never we thought it'd never be us I'm imperfect there's nothing good about me but you found favor in his eyes amen and he says you're all together lovely Hallelujah that's what the Bible says you can be all together lovely and your soul is what he's talking about praise God Glory all right so I just want to lay that in there because that's the subject of Song of Songs I didn't set my timer how long have I been here how many okay 10 minutes that says 46. I think you're right but I think some typo on there there's a bug in that I wasn't planning on preaching hour and a half I just wanted to get our hearts focused on the scriptures about love this is the great a momentous it's a Once a lifetime thing it's it's a momentous beautiful uh event that's happening here let me finish up here with song of Solomons I put a 15 minute timer on here so maybe I'll go 15 or 20. um I just want to hit a few highlights now after their first night together they start they have a few marriage problems that's what I want to share as well right after the wedding let me go back to Song of Songs um in verse chapter 5 verse 2 um it's right after the wedding sometime after the husband knocks on the door but the wife doesn't get up quick enough to answer now that's a beautiful type of God knocking at our hearts and we don't respond with prayer or worship soon enough right and it offends the husband the husband leaves but did they give up on each other they get divorced oh no they stay together there's Happy Times ahead I mean no there's seasons of marriage I have Beatrice and Jose oppresso amen there are seasons of marriage right this was a difficult season right after no don't have to be right it don't have to happen during the honeymoon you know but hopefully not but you know she didn't rise up and then she goes in verses six and seven goes to seek him to find him because she's sick of love she knows she fell short she knows she mistreated her husband and she wants to go make it right all right and then of course you know at the end of chapter 10 they I'm sorry at the end of chapter 5 verse 10 the woman goes through and says all the beautiful things about the husband head to toe right it's like Austin your dark hair is so dark it's like it's like the darkness of night it's so dark right and it goes through so these are little these are hints on romance right here his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of water let's see they're just beautiful descriptions and then in verse 16 she says his mouth is most sweet yay he is all together lovely he's my beloved and this is my friend right and later there's verses that that where the woman says this is the one whom my soul loves right that's why we call it the soul mate your two Souls we're together right that's what we believe they had to be taken apart now they come back together Hallelujah in marriage by God's grace so see even after difficult trials where one will fail another the love has to be restored they have to say we're sorry we have to let's start all over again by God's grace and then the love can return now um there's some just some beautiful uh descriptions in here now they're already married let's go to chapter six verse eight they're already married look at this there are three score queens and four score concubines and versions without number Mike Dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she's the choice one of that her that bear her the daughter saw her and blessed her yay the queens and the concubines and they praised her okay so this is the the the the the voice of the husband my one she's my dub she's my choice one praise God and that's the love we got to have as husband that's the love we got to have for our wives Hallelujah now chapter seven chapter seven gets into mature love and I want to go down to verse 10. as one of the seasons in marriage you gotta find times to get away from your busy life so recently you know we for our 20th anniversary we had that's one of our best getaways I think ever by God's grace might have been the best of all the all of them um but verse 10 I am my beloveds and his desires toward me chapter 7 verse 10. come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us Lodge in The Villages let us get up early to The Vineyards let us see a Divine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegrass bought forth and there will I give thee my loves the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which I have laid up for thee o my beloved in other words she made preparations we're gonna have a go get a getaway and we're going to spend time reuniting there okay so see marriages have that there's all the excitement leading up right and then there's trials but the Love Remains but then you got to make efforts to get away and rekindle the love as well special efforts to do that now the book ends with chapter eight and we see how love is so strong and and the we see this unending desire for these two to love each other all the way to the end they can't wait to be together Hallelujah and that's what we want is married couples we want our love to be strong that we can't wait to be together Hallelujah all right so let's read that here let's read verse six set me as a seal Paul thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel is the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which have a most vehement flame many Waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown if a man would give all a substance of his house for love it would be utterly content in other words love is greater than anything right just as death is final right death is final when someone dies don't see him again the Bible says love is greater than that right because death will be cast the Lake of Fire right but the love of Christ will continue Without End praise God for all eternity but the only the closest thing they can get to understand uh The Power of Love is to look at death because it's so final but there's a power greater than that love is greater than that love has no end Hallelujah the love of Jesus Christ I love it you know verse 14 what goes we'll close this portion with verse 14. the woman is talking again the the bride and the wife make haste my beloved and be thou like to a row or to a young heart upon the mountain of spices so in other words he's saying surely or is she saying come quickly my Lord and that's what John said come quickly Lord Jesus praise God see that so we see just a beautiful story I'm just going to overview you know for for you to understand it and I would encourage you read it uh read it when you get a chance it's a great great book if you haven't read it yet you know love is a special time uh when brother random got married or when brother tried to get engaged to hope he he couldn't do it face to face he couldn't get on a knee right so he did it in a letter he mailed it in the mail he was so so timid and then he didn't see her until they went to church right and brother and so he was sitting by her all the time in church wondering if she's going to accept his proposal that he wrote in the letter and brother Brandon said well I said now well she'll tell me after church well Billy I'm sorry but this is our last night together so he was bound all the negative thoughts right I could just hear her say oh I I just know what she was going to say it so I went out I never heard a thing that Dr Davis said and he just preached on I never heard a thing in the sermon I was worrying about what was going on to happen when I got outside of the church so see how love can just overtake you you don't hear one thing the preacher said love is important right love it love is important to our hearts we want to be loved we want safety we want security we want someone to love us brother bam you know after he was married to Sister Mita in 1962 If Abraham says this and the scripture he used is uh second Peter chapter one so let me read that real quick second Peter chapter one I believe it's verse four yes whereby are giving us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now the words divine nature partakers of the Divine Natures in other words you and I uh partake of the spirit of God right the Bible says you drink the Waters of life you eat the bread of life right brother and reads the scripture and it makes him think of his wife Mira and here's what he says he said excuses expression I told my wife here not long ago we're both getting old and I said to her I said do you love me like you used to so honey I'm gonna ask you that after service and she said I certainly do and I said you know I love you so much so I would like to take you in pull you inside of me so we could just be really be one now that he says multiply that by a hundred million and then you'll find out how the believer Who falls in love with Christ wants to get into Christ because it's a love and here he's going to show us how that through these promises we might be made partakers of Christ's divine nature these mortal bodies how we can be partakers of immortality amen now that's that that never would occurred to me partake in divine nature that makes me think I want to take partake of my wife coming inside and living inside of me but that's what a paid program think of husband wife Christ in the church and then brother Graham gives them in marriage advice here he says I believe that God gives us a mate and then we become part of each other and before a man gets married he should think all these things over study it a young man asked me the other day you think I could get ought to get married brother bands of such and such a girl I said how much do you think of her he said oh my I just love her I said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not so but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married and I said and so what I was trying to get to him this was that if you love her so much and that's you know I heard this quote and after I heard this quote I knew I was going to propose to Kristen I didn't know if she's going to say yes no I knew she's gonna say yes but after I heard that quote I heard brother Ram saying only marry her if you can't live without her I couldn't you know I couldn't picture anybody else marrying her I was like No One's Gonna Marry Her I gotta have her she's gonna be mine you know all the other brothers are getting married around distantly I'm gonna have her right you gotta have like a jealousy or kind of a you just have a desire right you're just you're zealous over that one person right that's that's what you got to have Hallelujah that's what my man says you got to have that he said now before you're married everything's just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toils and trials of Life come now there's the hard part he said that's when you've got to be so in love now I just shared how you do that you stay in love together physically you got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you until you understand one another that's the way it is with Christ we've got to be so in love with him to when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit [Music] how many times have I asked for my parents to come in the message or Mike to be healed different prayer requests we've asked over the years but even if he doesn't give it to me I love him anyway it doesn't shake me I know Jesus loves me why the only way you can do it is to become partakers of his divine nature and you'll understand he said I'm sorry he says then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you partakers of the divine nature now I don't know when we'll understand I don't I don't know when we'll understand why God doesn't answer our prayers but I believe someday we will right right I want to read you a couple love letters here this is George Washington our first president during the Revolutionary War he wrote to Martha he says my dearest as I am within a few minutes of leaving the city I could not think of departing from it without dropping you a line especially as I do not know whether it may be in my power to write again until I come to the camp at Boston I go fully trusting in that Providence he's talking about God which has been more Bountiful to me than I deserve and in full confidence of a happy meeting with you sometime in the fall so there I mean he's talking I'm not going to see you next week I'm gonna see you next

amen he says because I I'm going to prepare a place for you he says don't let your heart be troubled brother Jess isn't that awesome don't be trouble don't be anxious don't be fearful anything brother

now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I have come to the Holy Father keep them through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that name may be one as we are while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have joy fulfilled in themselves so this ought to make us joyful and the church said amen all these things Jesus prayed for our Oneness with the heavenly father in other words with the Holy Spirit that our joy might be fulfilled in US that we would not be troubled verse 14 here's how we get joy I have given them Thy word hallelujah and the world has hated them because they are not in the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world so yeah sometimes we want to get out of this place right Jesus and pray for us to leave what do you pray for but the thou shouldest keep them from the evil praise God hallelujah Jesus want us to stay here he wants us to overcome he want us to overcome the evil and if we're married we've got to use we gotta let our spouse work together with our spouse in the love of God to overcome the evil one praise God right it's exactly right and God will hear our prayers right Satan we'll get into our our families right because we keep the love alive the love of Jesus Christ oh it's beautiful praise God verse 16. they are not of the world even as as I am not

Systems is not our home he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth praise God and as thou has set me into the world even so I have also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that's where Jesus prayed for you praise God he said I pray for my disciples and all those that will hear through their word hallelujah amen we're reading their words right in the in the four gospels we're reading the words of the men Jesus prayed for and he prayed that we would be blessed and God would keep us right from all troubles and from all fear and keep us from all unbelief all these things if we just believe the word of his apostles oh it's beautiful verse 21 that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I am thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has set me so when when Christians see us unified as one group now look church we got a chance for this on Saturday for the world to come into our church and see the unity of the church and if listen if they're ever going to
