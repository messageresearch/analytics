[21:59] Peter 1:7 let's read that verse 2nd
[22:05] Peter 1:7
[22:20] second Peter 1:7 or VMI rivers
[22:23] hey bro van good to see you sister see

[22:42] Lord keep that on your heart all your
[22:43] life I wish I would have that when I was
[22:46] younger
[22:48] 2nd Peter 1:7 I remember every promise
[22:53] of God I'm sorry every blessing of God
[22:55] is obtained through believing the
[22:57] promise how many things you have a
[22:59] promise for brotherly kindness or look
[23:01] at that tonight just like you have a
[23:02] promise for godliness we saw on Sunday
[23:04] night
[23:04] temperance you have those promises with
[23:07] all those promises but it's to whosoever
[23:09] will whoever will believe God's Word and
[23:12] we're believers so thank God there for
[23:14] us 2nd Peter 1:7 let's read this on
[23:16] three one two three and to godliness
[23:19] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[23:22] kindness charity I'm just going to read
[23:25] verse eight myself for if these things
[23:26] be in you see they got to be inside you
[23:29] and abound they make that ye shall
[23:33] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[23:36] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so
[23:39] see all these attributes are added to
[23:41] you and they make your understanding of
[23:44] the gospel increase we shouldn't be more
[23:46] can we shouldn't be more confused about
[23:48] the message as time goes on we should
[23:51] understand it better because that's what
[23:53] the scripture says is you get another
[23:54] more anointing another anointing your
[23:56] understanding of the message I'll say
[23:59] like this crystallizes right it becomes
[24:01] so clear that's what the power of God
[24:03] does may God add his blessings to reams
[24:05] word maybe see the praise guy and again
[24:13] I'll try to watch the time here again by
[24:15] the grace of Lord but you know the funny
[24:16] thing is like we said last week we'll
[24:18] just stay in fellowship longer so we
[24:22] thank the Lord for the fellowship and
[24:24] that kind of goes along with our thought
[24:25] though for tonight you know brotherly
[24:26] kindness amen and I were just chatting
[24:28] before hand and he said I always feel so
[24:30] great being around you and the believers
[24:33] I said
[24:34] exactly right there's no other people I
[24:36] don't want to be around he's got the
[24:37] sweetest people in the world is the
[24:39] bride of Jesus Christ and the foolish
[24:41] murder are wonderful people as well
[24:43] praise God Jesus said he they were
[24:44] blessed and he foreknew them as well
[24:46] before the foundation of the world so we
[24:49] love all God's children praise God all
[24:52] right so let's take a look at these
[24:55] scriptures tonight I want to just teach
[24:58] on brotherly kindness I'll just pull up
[25:01] a rope quick quote I was looking at I
[25:08] was thinking about this quote when I
[25:10] pulled up here real quick
[25:20] all right so let's look at the start on
[25:25] brotherly kindness I trust you enjoyed
[25:27] the godliness on Sunday night I just
[25:30] love seeing how God's Word fits
[25:32] perfectly together when your godly your
[25:35] love like God sinners and enemies you
[25:39] love with the love of God by the grace
[25:42] of the Lord so tonight as we look at
[25:44] brotherly kindness remember it's the
[25:45] seventh anointing God gives you and
[25:49] let's just go back and look real quick
[25:51] briefly I all the things you have to
[25:53] reject the Bible says that we know
[25:56] Satan's devices yeah praise God we are
[26:00] not the bosses we're not ignorant of
[26:02] what Satan's trying to do so church if
[26:05] you and I if we're not born again then
[26:07] we know specifically where Satan's
[26:09] trying to attack us he's trying to get
[26:11] us to disbelieve right reject the faith
[26:14] that we first received and then he's
[26:16] trying to get us to be hypocrites to
[26:19] reject virtue right so he's gonna try to
[26:22] anoint believers with hypocrisy to say
[26:25] what they believe but not actually
[26:27] follow through on it and then Satan's
[26:29] gonna attack
[26:30] many in the message with human reasoning
[26:33] so they they they try to understand
[26:36] things with their own way rather than
[26:38] taking God's understanding God's
[26:40] knowledge of the situation also next is
[26:43] he'll try to tempt them with sensuality
[26:45] my this is a tough one all around right
[26:47] whether you got the Holy Ghost or not
[26:49] just bringing your fleshly body into
[26:52] subjection but Satan gets many people on
[26:55] sensuality next one is haste so instead
[27:01] of patience instead of accepting the
[27:03] anointing of patience Satan tries to
[27:06] tempt people to make quick hasty
[27:09] decisions without praying about it first
[27:11] Amen thank the Lord we always got to
[27:14] pray first even if it's just stopping
[27:16] for 10 seconds just stop and pray and
[27:19] you've got a chance to work on the
[27:21] situation praise God before making a
[27:24] decision praise God and then if you want
[27:26] godliness we saw on Sunday night you
[27:28] have to reject ereference you can't we
[27:31] just can't we get dissed Reese
[27:32] back sinners I told this thing the
[27:35] statement a few months ago but I've seen
[27:38] numerous Christians and I think it's
[27:40] just my judgment looking at their life I
[27:42] didn't talk to them personally about it
[27:43] but because they were ear reverent
[27:46] towards sinners and even the devil
[27:48] I feel like evil situations have
[27:51] happened them because they've been
[27:52] irreverent to the things too even
[27:55] sinners too even the devil make in front
[27:57] of the devil making fun of I've seen
[27:59] that at least two occasions people
[28:01] making fun of the devil and not
[28:05] respecting it remember the scripture
[28:06] says that even Michael didn't make fun
[28:11] of the devil let's go there let's go to
[28:12] Jude 1 so you can see that even Mike
[28:14] Michael had some level respect and I'm
[28:19] trying to think of the second one one of
[28:20] them was really really awful let's go to
[28:22] Jude what was the other one yeah help me
[28:26] Lord perhaps the Lord to help me
[28:28] remember another one railing yeah the
[28:33] scripture says yeah verse 4 in verse 8
[28:40] Jude which was the I believe the the
[28:43] brother of James Jude is warning
[28:47] believers not to to be like the
[28:52] sodomites right and then the angels
[28:56] because he warns him in verse 5 that God
[28:58] destroyed the the Jews that left Egypt
[29:02] because afterwards they believed not
[29:04] they didn't believe on all the way see
[29:08] we got to keep on believing praise God
[29:10] look at verse oh and just converse sixth
[29:13] and the Angels was catching up or cut
[29:15] not their first estate but left their
[29:16] own habitation you have two reserved in
[29:19] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[29:21] the judgment of the great day even as
[29:24] Sodom and Gomorrah the cities about them
[29:26] in like manner giving themselves over to
[29:27] fornication and going after strange
[29:29] flesh are set forth for an example
[29:32] suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire
[29:36] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[29:39] defile the flesh see that sensuality
[29:41] there they never got an only thing of
[29:44] godliness right I'm sorry
[29:46] temperance they never got it despise
[29:49] Dominion and speak evil of dignities now
[29:52] isn't that something all these riots
[29:54] member of a man we're talking bout that
[29:55] scripture they riot during the daytime
[29:56] Peter talked about they riot during the
[29:59] daytime look at all these riders a lot
[30:01] of them are for like the the homosexual
[30:03] movement the transgender movement they
[30:06] speak evil against any leader that won't
[30:08] give them any any demand they have even
[30:12] the mayors and the cities that let them
[30:14] do it and then if the mayors don't give
[30:15] them exactly what they want they go to
[30:17] their houses and you price all the
[30:18] violence this week you know with that
[30:21] they're just filthy they defile their
[30:24] flesh filthy dreamers they speak evil of
[30:27] the dignities and then verse 9 yet
[30:30] Michael the Archangel when contending
[30:31] with the devil he disputed about the
[30:34] body of Moses Durst not bring against
[30:38] him a railing accusation but said the
[30:41] Lord rebuke thee so Judas giving a
[30:46] differentiation between a holy angel and
[30:49] a filthy dreamer or a filthy sodomite a
[30:54] filthy sodomite isn't scared to speak
[30:57] against principalities and government's
[30:59] those though they'll rail against them
[31:02] in other words they'll attack their
[31:03] character but Jude says even a holy
[31:07] angel doesn't bring a railing accusation
[31:10] against Satan he just says the Lord
[31:12] rebuke thee any spot and you never see
[31:15] brother branham making fun of the devil
[31:18] now in the one case I I don't remember
[31:21] the second example mercy I wish I would
[31:22] remember that I wish would have wrote
[31:24] that down but the example I saw was this
[31:26] individual kept going around making fun
[31:28] of the devil and I never as soon as I
[31:32] heard it I didn't like it well the devil
[31:35] came in that person's family and made
[31:38] one of his family members go crazy now
[31:41] they're almost there on medication and
[31:43] almost insane and and someone that said
[31:47] they were born-again the Holy Ghost and
[31:49] had the Word of God
[31:49] well now the couple's divorced and a
[31:53] doctor II and people thought they were
[31:56] like solid and then with the Holy Ghost
[31:59] now I didn't
[32:00] I didn't talk to individual yeah I
[32:01] haven't felt led to do that yet but I
[32:04] just noticed I mean making fun of the
[32:06] devil and this happened so in other
[32:10] words it seemed like some confidence it
[32:12] seemed like an overconfidence you know
[32:16] the Bible says we don't bring railing
[32:18] accusations against Satan but we just
[32:21] rebuke him in Jesus name Amen praise God
[32:24] see whenever because we never want to
[32:26] get exalted with pride have a Satan's
[32:29] thing right pride but we be like him we
[32:31] we mimic him a week when we exalt
[32:34] ourselves even above him now as far as
[32:37] in the blood of Christ yes if we're
[32:38] exalted as far as God's glory but that's
[32:41] not something we brag about it's just
[32:42] the fact it's just our position but
[32:46] church let me say like this we got to be
[32:47] very careful what we say with our words
[32:49] this tongue is a world of iniquity the
[32:53] Bible says and who-who contained the
[32:56] tongue the Bible says I say who can the
[32:58] Holy Ghost field man or a woman praise
[33:00] God that's her Lord what's the obey
[33:03] God's Word and what's to live right
[33:04] before the Lord and once they learn from
[33:06] their mistakes cuz who hasn't made a
[33:08] mistake here we've all made mistakes
[33:10] especially with our lips oh my goodness
[33:14] so see let's be careful who we rail
[33:17] against be careful that's why when
[33:22] people move churches no matter never
[33:25] obviously people do it in Lima in
[33:27] different places and here we have to be
[33:30] very careful what they say about their
[33:32] past Church we have to be very very
[33:34] careful it's okay to differ with people
[33:39] but if you're blasting to them and
[33:41] giving regula accusation against them
[33:43] something's wrong with that heart
[33:45] something's wrong with that the church
[33:48] let's be sure we don't gossip and we
[33:50] don't rail against people and we don't
[33:52] judge people before the time he's got so
[33:57] see that's a temptation boy Satan gets a
[33:59] lot of people doesn't he say gets a lot
[34:01] of people with ear reference doesn't he
[34:03] they'll just say anything I'll just
[34:05] blast anybody and rail against them he
[34:08] gets a lot of people with that so they
[34:09] never get godliness and now tonight the
[34:15] the great temptation the the great
[34:18] device Satan tries to use is selfishness
[34:22] the last step before being born again
[34:24] yeah
[34:26] selfishness Oh help us Lord amen thank
[34:30] God so brotherly kindness is the self
[34:34] less miss you need to live for your
[34:38] Christian family while all God's Way
[34:41] praise the Lord so see those are great
[34:45] devices Satan uses unbelief époque recei
[34:49] human reasoning or man's intellect
[34:52] sensuality hast ear reverence and
[34:55] tonight selfishness now brother man
[35:03] tells us here now remember a temperance
[35:10] brother branham said you're starting to
[35:11] become a pretty good man at temperance
[35:15] he said but people can fall off at any
[35:17] point before charity people can fall off
[35:20] because they can they can blaspheme the
[35:23] Holy Spirit that was sanctified them
[35:26] that's what the scripture says in
[35:28] Hebrews 10 Loran said he said how many
[35:31] people are on the trash pile of
[35:34] ministers he comes him as we walk I'll
[35:36] rock along this highway causes the
[35:38] highway of holiness he said oh look at
[35:41] the trash heaps if you haven't listened
[35:42] that's a great message to listen to
[35:44] thank you for every minute he said how
[35:46] many people are on the side of this
[35:47] highway in the trash heaps they tried to
[35:50] serve God but when it came down to one
[35:52] of these anointings are one of these
[35:54] temptations they chose a lot of people
[35:57] to sensuality right instead of
[36:00] temperance they have to have this
[36:03] certain relationship or they have to
[36:04] have this certain drug or this certain
[36:06] thing to satisfy their flesh and so they
[36:10] never get the anointing of temperance
[36:12] same thing as irreverence instead of
[36:16] godliness instead of instead of speaking
[36:19] kind or just not saying anything at all
[36:21] like children we have a good
[36:22] conversation about that if we don't have
[36:24] anything good to say children what
[36:25] should say anything at all
[36:28] that shows if you got that quarter this
[36:31] you got some good godliness if you can
[36:34] hold your tongue and not speak against
[36:36] your brother and sister like we talked
[36:37] about this week with my family that's a
[36:42] good attribute of course that probably
[36:46] is with brotherly kindness but you
[36:47] understand what I'm saying
[36:48] when you have that reference you
[36:50] reverence your dad you reverence your
[36:52] mom you reverence your grandparents
[36:53] right you reverence everyone because you
[36:56] understand they're a child of God amen
[36:59] so tonight we want to look at this
[37:02] brotherly kindness and make sure we
[37:04] don't fall to Satan's temptation to be
[37:08] selfish now I'm still fighting the quo
[37:11] here yeah here Ryan
[37:13] gives the smallest teaching on brotherly
[37:17] kindness in this sermon it's the
[37:19] smallest amount he gives it a strange
[37:24] example maybe to us well Ram said adding
[37:29] relly kindness he says he says when you
[37:32] got that put yourself in his place on
[37:36] the matter so when you have brotherly
[37:39] kindness you can you can put yourself in
[37:41] somebody's shoes how would they feel or
[37:46] how would I feel if I was treated like
[37:49] that how would I feel if I was in her
[37:52] situation how would I feel if I was in
[37:55] his situation he then he quotes Peter he
[37:59] said Peter said Jesus my brother sinned
[38:01] against me shall I forgive him seven
[38:02] times a day and Jesus says seventy times
[38:06] seven Levine says brotherly kindness he
[38:11] said now you see if a brother's all out
[38:14] of tune don't be impatient with him be
[38:17] kind to him go anyhow so if somebody's
[38:22] attitude be kind to them and try to go
[38:25] to them and bring reconciliation to them
[38:29] that's being a problem a brother in
[38:31] Christ that's being kind to them if
[38:34] their attitude and try to help them out
[38:37] well Ram goes on to say somebody said
[38:40] not long ago
[38:41] oh can you brother branham believe these
[38:43] things the way you do and still go to
[38:46] the summaries of God and the oneness and
[38:48] all the rest you know that's a that's a
[38:53] good question if brother Ram but you
[38:55] know you hear him preach he preaches
[38:56] hard brother Graham preaches hard
[38:59] against the Trinity and sprinkling
[39:01] babies yep that for baptism and he
[39:03] blasts it you know he really does blast
[39:06] denominations but they asked him well
[39:08] how can you believe and preach so hard
[39:10] and still go to those places where the
[39:14] RAM says see brotherly kindness he says
[39:18] is the answer he said hoping some day
[39:22] I'm patient with him temperate and
[39:24] during with them knowledge to understand
[39:26] what he believes remember it's in his
[39:29] heart that's what it is virtue in
[39:31] yourself let it go out with kindness
[39:33] meekness to him having faith that some
[39:36] day God will bring him in and that's
[39:40] where brother Graham stops that's all he
[39:42] says about brotherly kindness so he says
[39:45] it's forgiving uh forgiving your brother
[39:49] 490 times right not seven times in a day
[39:53] 490 times in the day brother hey man I
[39:55] hope I never do that to you
[39:57] hope I never do 490 sins against you in
[39:59] one day if I do please forgive me each
[40:03] time you know and then go ahead and jump
[40:07] so people outside of the message that's
[40:09] a good example for him say he read
[40:11] praise God I said how can you go he said
[40:14] go and preach to them he said you still
[40:18] go preach to the summaries of God that's
[40:20] where I was raised I was raised in
[40:21] somebody's of God denomination or the
[40:24] oneness how can brother Graham still go
[40:26] to Trinitarian churches and oneness you
[40:29] know all these kind of churches he said
[40:32] what helps him do it is brotherly
[40:34] kindness preaching the word and hoping
[40:37] someday somebody will catch the
[40:39] revelation of God's Word now over the
[40:42] years church when we've traveled and
[40:44] gone on different vacations I think the
[40:46] last time was last year we went through
[40:49] Columbus I don't remember why we were
[40:52] traveling well it was a Sunday morning
[40:54] on the way home do you remember
[40:55] Oh was the homeschool convention okay
[40:59] and so ends Saturday night well we don't
[41:01] want to drive late in the night I get
[41:03] tired when I Drive at night so we stayed
[41:05] til Sunday and I think I had Simon cover
[41:07] for me or Brian Hawkins or something
[41:09] here well that morning you know if we
[41:12] left at 7:00 a.m. or 8:00 a.m. we get to
[41:14] Columbus right about the time a family
[41:17] members church service started well
[41:18] they're kind of Baptist or I don't even
[41:21] know what they are now Presbyterian
[41:23] Lutheran there's kind of like a strange
[41:25] mix but church we were able to go there
[41:29] and now it's totally different than our
[41:31] church right they come in there and let
[41:33] it look like they got their street
[41:34] clothes on nobody had a tie on I think I
[41:36] was only one that had a tie on everybody
[41:38] got their jumps their gym shoes on like
[41:40] their Nikes and like their basketball
[41:42] shoes out and there's collars and all
[41:46] undone and it's just different from us
[41:48] the women got their skinny jeans on the
[41:50] men got their senda skinny jeans on they
[41:52] got their earrings and the men the women
[41:54] and always the family and I are always
[41:57] nervous and us mr. Mason because we know
[42:00] we stick out like a sore thumb well you
[42:03] know church as they as they gone on I
[42:04] was just able to participate as much as
[42:06] I could I raised my hands I whispered a
[42:08] few amens because nobody was saying
[42:10] really anything and I'm just nervous in
[42:13] that situation but you know he preached
[42:17] on Philippians he preached on the book
[42:19] of Philippians and that's where I got
[42:20] some of the original notes I took notes
[42:23] on the Sir Martha I never knew that I
[42:24] never knew this is Paul was in jail when
[42:27] he wrote this and I learned quite a good
[42:29] few things from that and the preacher
[42:31] was a black young man and I went up
[42:33] afterwards I said I really appreciate
[42:34] that sermon brother and I did he said oh
[42:37] thank you
[42:38] and and I you know I didn't I had some
[42:41] books but I already gave it him out and
[42:43] I didn't have time to run out to the car
[42:44] but I did get my book away to my family
[42:47] member at that time and we went there
[42:52] and I just prayed about it my wife said
[42:53] what do you think we should do should we
[42:54] try to find a message church it's kind
[42:55] of odd the way and I was like no let's
[42:57] just let's just go to that family
[42:58] members church and show them some love
[42:59] then they've come to numerous services
[43:01] of ours and and in church that was my
[43:06] expression of brotherly kindness
[43:08] just like brother brand you say how
[43:10] could you go to a church where they wear
[43:11] skinny jeans I don't look at them I just
[43:14] yawn I don't support that
[43:15] I don't wear skinny jeans but I can
[43:19] still go there hoping that someday my
[43:21] testimony will have an impact on them
[43:23] and also sister Beatrice I went there as
[43:25] a messenger to deliver my book praise
[43:27] God
[43:28] which introduces brother branham's and
[43:30] then if they'll just read it it will
[43:32] show it right down through the scripture
[43:33] so I went there as not just a a
[43:36] worshipper I wasn't worshipper
[43:39] but I was also a messenger praise God
[43:42] now how can you do that because I'm kind
[43:44] to them I want to be kind of family I
[43:47] want to be kind to denominational people
[43:49] uh and all times cuz this in church I
[43:52] don't know who's gonna be saved and
[43:53] who's not
[43:54] we don't know who's gonna be saved my
[43:56] brother man told us he said never make
[43:57] yourself odd to be a Christian he said
[44:00] just tell everybody how much you love
[44:02] Jesus amen
[44:04] make yourself a fanatic we already said
[44:06] we already stick out like a sore thumb
[44:08] because of the way we dress right we
[44:10] already stick out let's not let's not
[44:12] raise our nose like we're better than
[44:14] anybody we're not we're still saved by
[44:16] the same grace they are now it's
[44:19] different that we've just we just
[44:21] continued on into the Promised Land
[44:23] praise God they might be on their way
[44:25] but we cross over amen so we should be
[44:29] glad they're on their way they may never
[44:32] get where you get but they got if they
[44:34] got out of Egypt praise God amen they're
[44:37] out of slavery hallelujah it might be go
[44:40] through some hot trials in the desert it
[44:43] might be really struggling with your
[44:44] skinny jeans this must be a really hot
[44:46] temptation these people God have mercy
[44:49] on their souls ah I don't know I don't
[44:54] know how they do it I don't know how
[44:55] they get past that I remember a few of
[44:57] them fine it you know but we want to be
[45:01] kind and church remember like Bobo says
[45:03] your your actions speak way louder than
[45:06] your words amen just my wife and the six
[45:09] jurors six girls walking in there with
[45:10] dresses on it my son and I with ties and
[45:13] shirts and looking like we're dressing
[45:15] that speaks louder than anything I could
[45:17] say praise God
[45:18] you can tell look at their faces I can
[45:21] tell I look
[45:22] their faces are something strange
[45:24] something happened they know we're
[45:26] different praise God but I just tried to
[45:29] encourage them the best we can because
[45:32] that's what a brother would do a brother
[45:36] would be kind to them how many got a
[45:41] college education here sister Naomi get
[45:43] one okay guys have a college education
[45:46] now which one of you with the college
[45:48] education would ever look down on one of
[45:50] the children because you don't have a
[45:52] college education which one do you think
[45:55] well I'm the way smarter you know look
[45:57] how great I am you know let me handle
[45:59] that problem because I got a college
[46:01] degree you know we all that means is we
[46:06] just spent more time in the school you
[46:08] know sitting at the desk taking more
[46:11] tests than you did but that doesn't make
[46:12] us any better I know but they men can
[46:15] try do a lot more things for this EDS
[46:16] better than I could I know for a fact
[46:17] bank and I'm I may have more credits
[46:21] than value at a school but that doesn't
[46:22] mean anything it just means that I know
[46:24] more about my job than he knows about my
[46:27] job that makes sense but he knows more
[46:29] about his job than I know about his job
[46:31] thank God
[46:33] and that's hard look at it like the
[46:35] denomination's praise God we just got a
[46:38] different training we just we've been
[46:39] trained longer the Word of God amen
[46:42] as far as deeper we've been we've seen
[46:46] the teachers notes praise God we got the
[46:50] answers to the task they even had the
[46:52] Ramson we got the devil we got the
[46:54] answer to the devil's question they
[46:56] don't have the answers to the devil's
[46:57] question but we got the answers the
[47:00] answer is the Living Word of God amen
[47:02] take the promises and take search the
[47:05] Scriptures for in them you think you
[47:07] have eternal life but they are they
[47:08] which testify of me we've got the
[47:11] devil's answers because we've got the
[47:12] revelation of the word that defeats him
[47:15] at every one of his tricks praise God
[47:18] they don't have the answers partly
[47:22] because they don't want them because he
[47:24] said whosoever will let him come and
[47:26] drink it's freely given to all of us so
[47:30] church that's what we have to have let's
[47:31] have faith that someday God will bring
[47:33] our brothers and sisters in that's
[47:36] faith someday God will bring them in
[47:39] let's show kindness to them while
[47:41] they're out there forever like I told
[47:43] that one brother Randy Merton you know
[47:45] Simon just since I would told me he he
[47:48] said he knew Randy was watching his post
[47:50] so with brotherly kindness he posted
[47:52] that in order to stir them up and that
[47:54] Facebook post from Simon one is so
[47:57] restored his soul back to the faith
[47:59] that's kindness instead of instead of
[48:01] preaching against him or railing against
[48:04] him he had kindness to him and keep
[48:06] giving on more opportunities more
[48:07] opportunities and then finally our
[48:10] brother came back in thank the Lord
[48:12] that's a good example hallelujah I'm
[48:16] never gonna get to my text here I got
[48:18] okay wow 16 minutes now this is the
[48:21] second stage of sanctification that's
[48:24] right this is the last stage of
[48:25] sanctification sorry now the Greek word
[48:29] you know means Philadelphia and this
[48:33] means love of the brothers or sisters
[48:35] the love which Christians cherish for
[48:37] each other as brethren now remember
[48:39] brother may have identified the
[48:41] Philadelphian church age because of all
[48:44] the outreach that they did two men in
[48:48] particular did tremendous missionary
[48:49] work William Carey I preached on it a
[48:52] couple years ago
[48:53] 2017 and Livingstone I think it was
[48:57] Scott Livingstone Carrie Carrie started
[49:03] a foundation I believe in Europe and
[49:05] then they raised they they raised
[49:06] thousands of dollars and millions of
[49:08] dollars and they would send he and he
[49:11] himself was the first one to go to India
[49:13] and started processing the heathens and
[49:17] they there their record is spending
[49:20] millions of dollars to send missionaries
[49:22] and Bibles and books to make schools and
[49:25] church God use schools did you ever know
[49:29] that the Old Testament had a school the
[49:31] prophets that godly men that came out of
[49:34] there did you know the messenger Martin
[49:37] came out of a school did you know st.
[49:40] Patrick who was Martin's nephew came out
[49:42] of a school in other words what I'm
[49:45] saying is any fellowship where you're in
[49:47] with Holy Ghost field people is a school
[49:50] this is a school phrase God go Ram
[49:54] taught it just the seven seals he said
[49:55] he said you've been the best class you
[49:58] could ever been God amen it's a school
[50:03] you're learning you're being taught
[50:05] God's word amen and so living Carey
[50:10] started many schools of over in India
[50:12] which they still go to this day now we
[50:15] don't believe in denominational schools
[50:17] but any fellowship as we'd say as a
[50:20] school it's a learning opportunity right
[50:22] because you're learning and then Scott
[50:26] livings Livingstone I'm sorry David
[50:28] Livingstone that Scott he's known as
[50:30] David Livingstone he went down into the
[50:33] deepest parts of Africa he was the first
[50:35] one that in the the age of the the
[50:37] friendly love went deep in Africa
[50:41] started many churches with many signs
[50:43] wonders and miracles that's why that age
[50:45] is called the age of brotherly love also
[50:48] they had just had the printing press
[50:50] invented the movable-type and they print
[50:53] off hundreds of thousands of millions of
[50:56] tracks and that was the age Jesus called
[51:00] the age of the open door see the whole
[51:03] world was opened up praise God and the
[51:06] missionaries went everywhere in the
[51:07] world praise God and so the best way
[51:11] Jesus could describe that church age was
[51:14] the caught brotherly kindness but you
[51:16] and I I get a special anointing of that
[51:19] right before the baptism of the Holy
[51:21] Ghost so you and I will have love for
[51:24] our brothers and sisters we will cherish
[51:26] each other as brethren I was gonna say
[51:31] this later mama st. now Church it's it's
[51:33] it's gonna feel different between men
[51:36] and women right in other words brother
[51:38] amen should feel my love way more than
[51:40] his wife right right in other words let
[51:45] me say like this sisters don't let
[51:47] brothers talk to you too long right it's
[51:50] not your husband you know I mean in
[51:52] other words I should have walk up to
[51:54] someone that's not my wife and just talk
[51:56] to them the whole time and give them
[51:58] attention and you know you don't I mean
[52:01] flirt with them or something like that
[52:04] so see what I'm saying you know because
[52:06] remember even in some countries they
[52:07] have brothers or sisters sit on
[52:08] different sides of the churches don't
[52:10] they sister now we seen on your head
[52:11] because they respect that line so much
[52:16] they respect the difference between male
[52:18] and female but as far as sacrifice yeah
[52:21] should be able to sacrifice my time and
[52:23] do the Bible study if sister who once
[52:25] won with brother amen
[52:26] I would minister them you know and
[52:28] likewise with any sister so you know I
[52:33] just want to make sure I say that
[52:34] specifically before my time runs out
[52:36] which it just seems it goes must be the
[52:39] summer time it must make it go faster
[52:40] this beautiful sunshine so see you are
[52:45] gonna strongly love your Christian
[52:48] family more than everybody else it's
[52:53] true it's true the Bible tells us
[52:59] plainly
[53:00] let's read it a Galatians 6:10 I don't
[53:03] have can you pull up there we'll just
[53:07] reading a few scriptures some of the
[53:08] easier real familiar with true disciples
[53:12] of Jesus Christ fervently love their
[53:15] church family fervently love them now
[53:19] Galatians 6:10 as we have therefore
[53:25] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[53:27] especially unto them who are of the
[53:31] household of faith so church you know
[53:34] when we're together we have lots of
[53:36] opportunities to be good to each other
[53:38] right
[53:39] lots cuz we see each other three or four
[53:42] times a week you know three at least
[53:45] hopefully you know some less some more
[53:48] so we should find opportunities to do
[53:51] something good for our family you know
[53:56] there'll be Express of course in
[53:57] different ways when Jesus said in John
[53:59] 13:35 all men shall know that ye are my
[54:03] disciples if you have love one to
[54:06] another so sinners will have to look at
[54:09] our church and say they really love one
[54:12] another praise God they're willing to
[54:15] gather you know three nights and
[54:16] oh sorry Sunday or sorry Friday Sunday
[54:18] for church services they're willing to
[54:21] they're willing you guys wash each
[54:22] other's dirty feet well I try to wash it
[54:25] beforehand right before you come to
[54:26] church now I don't always do that so
[54:28] brothers forgive me if I don't sometimes
[54:31] I put you through it ahead i watch my
[54:32] toes real good but the fact is that we
[54:35] laugh at that but the fact is a lot of
[54:37] churches don't do that they don't humble
[54:38] themselves and wash one another's feet
[54:41] but it's a great reminder that I am your
[54:44] servant for they men I am your servant
[54:46] if I can help you you got you have to
[54:49] please let me know and let me the Holy
[54:50] Spirit let me know that I can help you
[54:52] sisters you are your your your one
[54:55] another servants and God help us
[54:57] especially in America help us to always
[54:59] remember we serve one another we're here
[55:01] to help one another and that's why the
[55:05] way sinners should know that were true
[55:09] disciples of Christ like how many times
[55:11] have I shared it with you know Wendy's
[55:13] testimony of driving three half hours
[55:15] just to come to our church and people
[55:16] their eyes literally you know bug out of
[55:18] their face you know like they drive
[55:20] three hours that well there must be
[55:22] something special about that because
[55:24] there's many churches she passes there
[55:26] must be something about this church
[55:27] that's real special to her right you and
[55:30] everybody passes numerous churches to go
[55:33] to this one right I know I do what is it
[55:36] there's something special about God's
[55:38] people praise God they have they have a
[55:40] harmony as we saw on Sunday they got a
[55:43] unity of mind they all think the same
[55:44] way praise God
[55:46] they want to see Jesus returning they
[55:48] want to see Jesus in their lives now and
[55:51] they want to see Jesus in the air amen
[55:52] praise God we want to see them now and
[55:55] every service and every every day of our
[55:58] lives and our fellowships and we want to
[56:00] see it mostly in the air praise God
[56:02] because most won't see them in the air
[56:04] right most will see them at the white
[56:06] throne I want to see him in the air
[56:07] praise God that's our that's my desire
[56:10] that's what I'm living for praise God so
[56:13] see brother Titus is the last thing you
[56:15] get before God officially puts you into
[56:17] his family he's got to make sure that
[56:20] you are gonna treat his family the right
[56:24] way praise God I wrote this in the book
[56:27] I said it's as if God is saying I
[56:29] gratias
[56:30] they built you up into a godly spiritual
[56:32] being but before I officially adopt you
[56:35] into my family by the seal the Holy
[56:36] Ghost I'm giving you brother kindness so
[56:39] you will serve and love my other
[56:41] children that I've adopted that's what I
[56:44] wrote but that in the book by God's
[56:45] grace Oh to make sure you're gonna serve
[56:48] the body help the body not harm the body
[56:52] so the last anointing he gives you is a
[56:55] desire to love everybody in the church
[57:01] praise God now we know the Scriptures
[57:05] love is gonna continually decrease right
[57:09] Matthew 24:12 because iniquity shall
[57:11] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[57:13] I've heard that a few times the last few
[57:14] scriptures Paul said Paul and Paul says
[57:17] where that love is going to go love for
[57:19] God is gonna go way down but love in
[57:22] general is going to go to two other
[57:23] things love to south and love to
[57:26] pleasures okay
[57:28] so there's either there's one of those
[57:30] three things you can love either God
[57:32] yourself or pleasures let's love God and
[57:35] if you love God you'll love God's
[57:37] children hey grace why we shouldn't love
[57:41] ourselves more than God we shouldn't
[57:44] love pleasures more than God we must
[57:47] love God above all things like I said
[57:50] there's nothing wrong with the pleasure
[57:51] of liking ice cream once a week there's
[57:53] nothing wrong with that brother man I
[57:54] talked about pies and eating cherry pies
[57:56] you got all kinds of chocolates every
[57:58] year for Christmas I mean there's
[57:59] nothing wrong with you know what so a
[58:01] couple of times a week have a little
[58:02] pleasure for the flesh but we know we're
[58:04] talking about a pleasure that denies the
[58:06] word any worldly pleasure that makes
[58:09] people deny the word and get evil
[58:11] spirits and disobey God's Word that's
[58:14] the kind of pleasure
[58:15] we don't want praise God just little
[58:18] simple pleasures in life but it's
[58:22] actually pleasure that becomes an idol
[58:24] and becomes so great that the worship of
[58:27] God is dismissed and decreased we see
[58:31] the love of God should increase praise
[58:34] God hallelujah
[58:37] like like Paul Rader said I'm taking
[58:39] care of God's man I'll go first class
[58:41] if I'm gonna if I'm dying from from
[58:45] tiredness and I got a headache I need to
[58:47] take care of God's man a little bit
[58:50] praise the Lord
[58:52] oh I love that coke now look
[58:55] pull up first oh she's out can you do
[58:58] Lydia first Thessalonians 3:12 just to
[59:00] save some time the world is gonna
[59:03] decrease their love for God with Church
[59:05] we have to let God increase our love for
[59:09] him in other words you've got to yehliu
[59:11] not have to you the guy just look at
[59:13] this now look the Lord make you is God
[59:16] gonna make you love him more
[59:18] no in other words it's not gonna force
[59:21] you to be a better Christian no he can't
[59:24] force you or else you're a mindless
[59:26] dumb robot I use that word but a
[59:29] mindless unintelligent robot say like
[59:33] that I don't like to use that word you
[59:35] forgive me but see we have to understand
[59:39] what it's saying the Lord make you to
[59:40] increase and abound in love one toward
[59:43] another toward all men even as we do
[59:46] toward you in other words he's saying
[59:48] let God increase your love because God
[59:52] can't do anything outside your will he
[59:55] can only do what you let him do praise
[59:56] God so in other words yield your will to
[1:00:00] his and God will cause you to grow in
[1:00:03] love hey glory see guys aren't gonna
[1:00:08] make you go to the rapture guys not
[1:00:10] gonna make someone go to hell do you let
[1:00:12] some choose whatever they want so we
[1:00:14] have to make sure we read the scripture
[1:00:15] the right way thanks Lydia and thanks in
[1:00:17] case you're are you sweet helping
[1:00:19] appreciate then see the world is going
[1:00:22] to decrease and love but our love should
[1:00:25] increase so see Turk that's why that
[1:00:26] scripture your first love is so
[1:00:28] important you know and if this is right
[1:00:30] if this is right then we should go
[1:00:33] something our first love should increase
[1:00:35] praise God I don't know if I'm saying it
[1:00:37] not maybe the Lord could help me
[1:00:38] your first love is a great portion of
[1:00:41] love but if you got if you're praying
[1:00:43] for this your first love should be more
[1:00:45] loving Amen I don't know how to say it
[1:00:48] I'm just uh I'm too educated I'll say
[1:00:50] like that maybe I know steady words
[1:00:52] enough I need to be good more in the
[1:00:54] dictionary
[1:00:55] not dictionary the Bible that's the
[1:00:59] dictionary I got to be in but you
[1:01:00] understand you know we shouldn't be
[1:01:02] living in our second love or a lukewarm
[1:01:04] state we should be on fire for the Lord
[1:01:07] we're gonna guess we're gonna vote we
[1:01:09] got any like we said last week we're
[1:01:11] going to constantly battle we might be
[1:01:12] impatient at times you might be a little
[1:01:15] too sensual a time but all you have to
[1:01:17] do is say God forgive me restore the joy
[1:01:19] of my salvation bring that first love
[1:01:22] back and then increase my love again
[1:01:25] oppa a man I've seen over doors for the
[1:01:27] Lord now since what well I gave my heart
[1:01:31] Lord a night mm I'll just say for 20
[1:01:33] years I've seen it go up and down but
[1:01:35] it's on a steady increase i like the
[1:01:37] stock market
[1:01:37] i like that we're making spiritual gains
[1:01:41] though that's right he's gonna go
[1:01:44] through mountains and valleys right ups
[1:01:46] and downs but we're steadily increasing
[1:01:49] upward praise God
[1:01:50] that's our trend or trending upward amen
[1:01:54] it's it's true you know even writing
[1:01:56] this book I have such a burn to do it I
[1:01:59] know it's the Holy Spirit cuz preachers
[1:02:00] have told me I couldn't do it I don't
[1:02:02] know how you do it that's a huge job how
[1:02:04] could you well the Holy Spirit so the
[1:02:07] more on summer they men the more I think
[1:02:08] about the book that less I think about
[1:02:10] you know things I should probably be
[1:02:12] doing there's like other jobs you know
[1:02:15] like oh yeah choosing somebody to do a
[1:02:16] memory verse for July just forget about
[1:02:18] that because the whole time thinking
[1:02:19] about is God's Word and so forgive me if
[1:02:22] I forget little things like that but you
[1:02:24] know finding God's will for your life is
[1:02:26] the crucial thing and we'll have a whole
[1:02:27] series on that - it's a beautiful topic
[1:02:30] we'll see we should see our love
[1:02:32] increasing when and if our love
[1:02:34] increases our submission increases
[1:02:36] praise God in other words we do what God
[1:02:38] wants us to do praise God
[1:02:40] instead of what we want to do because
[1:02:42] we're not so much like it's living for
[1:02:45] other people amen praise God now in the
[1:02:52] book I put a I'm have to go a little bit
[1:02:57] longer than I think maybe my watch is
[1:02:59] broken I need to get a new watch
[1:03:01] throw this thing on there I I you know I
[1:03:05] just felt a lot of the Holy Spirit I
[1:03:06] wrote this chapter months and months
[1:03:08] this might been a year ago to put a
[1:03:12] section there if you have brotherly
[1:03:15] kindness you will locate and live for
[1:03:18] your Christian family you will not be a
[1:03:21] lone ranger Christian I had a person
[1:03:25] comment on my latest YouTube video this
[1:03:27] week and they said oh the Holy Spirit
[1:03:29] led me out of my home church and I just
[1:03:30] sit home and play tapes and I said I
[1:03:32] doubt very much sir that the Holy Spirit
[1:03:35] led you out of there because you're not
[1:03:37] part of a body and the Holy Spirit says
[1:03:39] gather Moors you see that Day
[1:03:41] approaching and the Bible says the five
[1:03:44] bold preaching ministry will perfect
[1:03:47] your faith and bring unity to the faith
[1:03:49] of the bride it literally says that till
[1:03:53] we all come in the knowledge and the
[1:03:55] unity of the faith until where's God far
[1:03:59] as I can tell we're not all unified
[1:04:01] quite yet we're getting close okay Evan
[1:04:03] brother Brooks Adan Jim and all these
[1:04:05] wonderful Saints we're very very close
[1:04:07] we're more unified than ever praise God
[1:04:09] it's true with our doctrine with our
[1:04:12] love but you're not going to have
[1:04:15] broadly kindness and run away from God's
[1:04:18] family you're gonna run to God's family
[1:04:21] as member Christ's custom was to be in
[1:04:25] the synagogue every sabbath day in other
[1:04:28] words there's forty minutes but i've
[1:04:29] nobody little further it's only eight
[1:04:30] o'clock how did that happen mercy I'm
[1:04:35] gonna give myself 30 extra minutes yeah
[1:04:41] somebody or something messed up with my
[1:04:44] watch this is just I must have pressed
[1:04:46] the wrong button or something anyways
[1:04:49] the Lord Jesus Christ God in the flesh
[1:04:53] his custom was to always be in church
[1:04:58] that was his example
[1:05:01] acts 20 verse 7 in case you can you put
[1:05:03] up there on the first week the disciples
[1:05:06] came together to break bread Paul
[1:05:08] preached to them and he continued his
[1:05:10] speech till midnight till midnight
[1:05:14] he preached till now the thing is we
[1:05:16] don't know what he started for in this
[1:05:20] case he preached him midnight and after
[1:05:22] midnight actually after midnight and so
[1:05:27] see that's that zeal of having you know
[1:05:28] no you know he's gonna leave soon he's
[1:05:30] got to get he said later he said I
[1:05:32] taught them the whole Council of God he
[1:05:34] knew there was part of the word of God
[1:05:36] he had the cover before he left so he
[1:05:38] preached really really long but you see
[1:05:40] first week Sunday that's why we gather
[1:05:41] Sunday that's why we break bread that's
[1:05:43] why we have communion that's why we
[1:05:44] preach sometimes love that's why we come
[1:05:47] together so much because Jesus did it
[1:05:49] constantly Paul did it constantly it's
[1:05:52] the example as set forth in the
[1:05:53] scripture Jesus can you go to Matthew
[1:05:58] 9:36 huh Jesus looked at the multitudes
[1:06:04] with no pastors and then he urged the
[1:06:07] disciples to pray for God to send
[1:06:10] laborers amen I'm laboring in the word
[1:06:16] of God and doctrine that's Scripture
[1:06:20] building a doctrine is labor it's not
[1:06:24] easy there's lots of scriptures to go
[1:06:26] through there's lots of things you have
[1:06:28] to rightly divide and take out and put
[1:06:30] in the Bible cause the labor took my own
[1:06:34] horn I'm just saying like it's a
[1:06:35] position I've caught up and called to it
[1:06:38] praise God
[1:06:39] see what he saw the multitudes he was
[1:06:41] moved with compassion on them because
[1:06:42] they fainted and they were scattered
[1:06:44] abroad as sheep having no Shepherd they
[1:06:46] never pasture they were just scattered
[1:06:48] abroad they really have somebody guiding
[1:06:50] them they follow Jesus or they'd have
[1:06:52] someone there just to be a shepherd that
[1:06:55] verse 37 they said his disciples the
[1:06:58] harvest truly is plenteous but the
[1:07:00] laborers are few
[1:07:01] next one pray ye therefore the lord of
[1:07:05] the harvest that he will send forth
[1:07:06] laborers into his harvest Jesus doesn't
[1:07:09] like to see people wandering without a
[1:07:11] shepherd
[1:07:12] and this man tells me the Holy Spirit
[1:07:14] let him do it I doubt that very much
[1:07:16] unless he that about to spank him and
[1:07:18] chase it at birth awhile so he can send
[1:07:21] them back in get the evil spirit off
[1:07:22] take him out get an evil spirit off and
[1:07:24] send him back in maybe that was it I
[1:07:26] don't know
[1:07:27] but look at Jesus he said pray you
[1:07:31] brothers need to pray that they'll be
[1:07:33] labor sent out who will feed these sheep
[1:07:35] praise God in other words I need
[1:07:40] somebody with brotherly kindness someone
[1:07:42] who's concerned about the souls of the
[1:07:44] people to make sure that they hear the
[1:07:46] truth of God and not some live from Hell
[1:07:50] or some televangelists or some
[1:07:52] headquarters right just taking orders
[1:07:54] from headquarters letting man rule over
[1:07:58] men but to make sure seen someone labor
[1:08:01] to feed them God's Word constantly and
[1:08:04] if they eat it and if they exercise
[1:08:05] they'll grow up in a real spiritual army
[1:08:09] of God amen
[1:08:10] hallelujah thank the Lord see harvests
[1:08:17] and preachers for a harvest that's why
[1:08:19] after he finally sat down in heaven
[1:08:21] Jesus he sent down five gifts to the
[1:08:24] church he sent them he ordained it
[1:08:28] praise God
[1:08:29] remember these gifts the fivefold
[1:08:32] ministry promotes precise truth unity
[1:08:36] and it keeps you church from immaturity
[1:08:39] doubt hesitation and deception you ought
[1:08:43] to be thankful for this local church it
[1:08:45] keeps you from being deceived
[1:08:48] think about where you'd be think about
[1:08:50] the church you're at before you came to
[1:08:51] this church now some of you might have
[1:08:53] good churches by God's grace but I know
[1:08:56] I you know before the message I didn't
[1:08:58] have some good at churches I've been
[1:09:01] very deceived in those churches because
[1:09:04] even let you divorce remarry as long as
[1:09:06] you spoke in tongues you're good you're
[1:09:09] good
[1:09:09] remember that was I'm another suicide
[1:09:10] missed testimony on YouTube this week it
[1:09:12] was so awesome
[1:09:13] after he first got saved he walked in
[1:09:15] there he was so on fire God but he would
[1:09:18] see the church members speak in tongues
[1:09:21] and then go do these sins and Simon's
[1:09:24] like how can I without the gift of
[1:09:26] tongues how can I live a more holy life
[1:09:29] than these people got miracles and
[1:09:31] speaking in tongues sounds like it don't
[1:09:33] make any sense
[1:09:35] the sign went to the pastor he said
[1:09:37] pastor you needed preached against it in
[1:09:39] the pastor
[1:09:41] it's assigned to one in the closet for
[1:09:43] three months every every night he said
[1:09:45] after work before like in bed said God
[1:09:47] send me the truth
[1:09:48] I don't care what it looks like I don't
[1:09:50] care what I have to do as long as I'm as
[1:09:52] long as I got truth I'll believe it
[1:09:57] and then God knocked down those two
[1:09:59] those two towers to fall and to shake
[1:10:02] people up and Simon got invited the
[1:10:04] Bible study the rest is history
[1:10:06] God showed him the truth it didn't
[1:10:07] matter what it doesn't matter who's
[1:10:10] around or how big the group how small
[1:10:12] the group how humble the group is as
[1:10:15] long as it was truth I want to be one of
[1:10:17] those race God that's the truth look for
[1:10:24] holiness remember Paul said follow those
[1:10:27] who call upon the Lord out of a pure
[1:10:30] heart
[1:10:31] hey people that are pure spiritually
[1:10:35] love God hard to find so because of our
[1:10:41] local church I believe you're not your
[1:10:43] mature you got faith you're not doubting
[1:10:46] you're not hesitating and you're not
[1:10:49] deceived I know you know there's five
[1:10:57] things or to go with before I close
[1:10:59] there's just five simple scriptures
[1:11:01] Church on how you can love your local
[1:11:06] church and I'll go through each one I'll
[1:11:09] try to just share a few comments here
[1:11:13] okay so the first one I had here I just
[1:11:16] going over the scriptures was meeting
[1:11:19] their physical needs now the early
[1:11:25] church acts 6:1 case you can you pull it
[1:11:26] up there
[1:11:33] now I'm going to share a literal example
[1:11:35] of this here in just a moment because
[1:11:36] the people never no longer come to our
[1:11:38] church and in those days when the number
[1:11:41] of disciples was multiplied there arose
[1:11:43] a murmuring of Grecians against the
[1:11:45] Hebrews because their widows were
[1:11:47] neglected in the daily ministration AC
[1:11:49] membra these people don't have freezers
[1:11:51] like we got they didn't have
[1:11:53] refrigerators so they couldn't store
[1:11:56] food right so every day there was widows
[1:11:58] that believed the message but they
[1:12:01] needed food delivered to them every day
[1:12:03] imagine that kind like your children
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:07] deliver food every day calicos Aldi
[1:12:11] workers are gonna get to deliver their
[1:12:12] groceries every day right kinda like
[1:12:14] that you have to make sure it's got like
[1:12:16] a parent they had two parents over the
[1:12:19] adults these widows didn't have any food
[1:12:21] and so every day they got to talk about
[1:12:24] meals on wheels how many know what meals
[1:12:26] on wheels is talking about that's
[1:12:28] exactly what it was just no wheels just
[1:12:31] meals every day these poor Christians
[1:12:33] verse two then the twelve called the
[1:12:39] multitude disciples of them said is not
[1:12:41] me I'm sorry is that reason that we
[1:12:43] should leave the Word of God and serve
[1:12:44] tables so no they never said it you know
[1:12:50] we don't we don't believe in giving
[1:12:52] people food they believed in it so in
[1:12:55] other words I'm trying to say some
[1:12:56] people's job in the church is to just
[1:12:58] help the poor people that can be your
[1:13:00] job thankfully at this point over our
[1:13:03] church I don't know anybody that is from
[1:13:04] with finances but if there was you know
[1:13:11] that's why when we had to so people come
[1:13:13] in the past you saw me with them a lot
[1:13:15] drive them to church I would buy them
[1:13:17] groceries because they needed food and
[1:13:21] their coming to church that's the
[1:13:23] Christian thing to do praise God you and
[1:13:27] I can't say we're Christians and say
[1:13:30] we're going to meet someone's spiritual
[1:13:32] needs if we don't meet their physical
[1:13:33] needs first right James says if you see
[1:13:38] someone cold and say go be warm but you
[1:13:40] don't give them a coat your faith is
[1:13:42] dead praise God
[1:13:46] that's why first we must look at our
[1:13:49] local assembly to see who has physical
[1:13:52] needs
[1:13:52] now how many member when sister Kahn
[1:13:54] used to come well she got sick and got
[1:13:57] laid off or something couldn't work for
[1:13:59] the errand gave me a check I'm not gonna
[1:14:02] say them out but it was multiple
[1:14:03] hundreds of dollars I just announced it
[1:14:05] over the pulpit you know she's out of
[1:14:07] work he just come up and give this big
[1:14:09] old check and I mailed it and let her
[1:14:12] know it was coming but she never cashed
[1:14:13] it I mean just and to me like that was
[1:14:16] such like childlike faith right and our
[1:14:19] brother was on fire for a while we know
[1:14:22] we have differences now but that to me
[1:14:25] that was like such childlike faith and
[1:14:27] not and so he must have had extra right
[1:14:29] you know which is understandable right
[1:14:32] so there's sometimes we have extra
[1:14:34] sometimes we don't I just want to use
[1:14:36] that as a simple example and we hear
[1:14:38] somebody struggling let's try to do
[1:14:42] something right away to help out let me
[1:14:47] say that again you know we had that
[1:14:47] fellowship for a couple weeks ago and I
[1:14:49] asked at the beginning I said does
[1:14:50] anybody know anybody that doesn't have
[1:14:52] food or clothing in the church and every
[1:14:54] said no we're not aware of it so just so
[1:14:56] you know I'm asking about everybody how
[1:14:57] you ask about everybody you know do they
[1:14:59] have it or not if not let's get it for
[1:15:02] them because that is our job our job is
[1:15:05] to make sure the physical needs are met
[1:15:08] first praise God
[1:15:11] think about even with Elijah member
[1:15:13] Elijah and the widow woman she's like
[1:15:17] we're gonna die he's like go make me a
[1:15:19] cake first well we're just gonna die we
[1:15:31] got one meal left he said she said he
[1:15:34] said put God first in other words he
[1:15:37] said seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:15:39] and all these things will be added unto
[1:15:42] you
[1:15:43] meet my physical needs first your
[1:15:46] spiritual needs
[1:15:48] see you if we're gonna be Christians we
[1:15:52] have to find we have to look and see
[1:15:54] people in our church you like when the
[1:15:56] coronavirus it I asked Amen and bang and
[1:15:59] different ones
[1:16:00] they got laid off I just want to know
[1:16:01] like I want you have any you need
[1:16:03] anything let me know if you need
[1:16:05] anything that's why we're here is to
[1:16:07] help people with their physical needs so
[1:16:11] how many want to just I don't say lord
[1:16:13] help my ears to be open you know sister
[1:16:17] Naomi here your dad got that shirt for
[1:16:19] that brother who used to come I've
[1:16:21] emailed him multiple times asking for
[1:16:23] his mailing address I could mail two
[1:16:24] people give it to me so just say you
[1:16:25] know I'm trying and I want to send them
[1:16:27] you know some cash and I knew he's out
[1:16:29] of it
[1:16:31] fine fine brother but I just can't get
[1:16:33] an address yeah I should I should have
[1:16:36] text people in the church used to go to
[1:16:38] that might be a better idea I just
[1:16:40] thought that now so you try you you you
[1:16:43] tried to meet the needs of people so
[1:16:46] they can worship the Lord because once
[1:16:49] your physical needs are met then of
[1:16:51] course that opens up you know get your
[1:16:52] focus off that and get your focus on God
[1:16:55] the spiritual things of God now for
[1:16:59] times sake I'll go to the next one you
[1:17:01] should have you and I should have
[1:17:02] radical forgiveness towards fellow
[1:17:04] Christians like 490 times a day radical
[1:17:09] in other words like 500 times a day
[1:17:12] forgive me if I make a mistake 500 times
[1:17:16] a day that's astounding you know a Peter
[1:17:20] set out to that he he said oh that's
[1:17:21] easy Lord no he didn't he said Lord
[1:17:24] increase our faith right he's they all
[1:17:28] Jesus that's easy he said God you better
[1:17:30] give me some more faith in other words
[1:17:32] you better give me more of a nice day
[1:17:33] ain't ahead if I'm gonna forgive my
[1:17:36] brother 500 times a day I better have
[1:17:38] more Holy Spirit strength cuz right now
[1:17:41] I know I don't have the strength to do
[1:17:43] that this is brotherly kindness this is
[1:17:47] the example program gifts for brotherly
[1:17:49] kindness and church think about we get
[1:17:53] all bent out of shape out of one mistake
[1:17:58] one thing somebody does one thing wrong
[1:18:04] oh right Jesus says it's way beyond that
[1:18:13] now of course when we repent right we
[1:18:15] repent yeah weak but in our flesh if
[1:18:21] we're if we're if we're caught in that
[1:18:23] moment of being in the flesh it's hard
[1:18:26] it can be hard but see God gives us he
[1:18:28] does increase our faith praise God he
[1:18:30] does increase the anointing remember
[1:18:34] Jesus gave the parable in Matthew 18 of
[1:18:36] the unmerciful servant Jesus forgives
[1:18:39] our sins that are so great we should be
[1:18:42] able to give people sin debts that are
[1:18:44] so tiny in comparison remember he was
[1:18:48] like the guy was forgiving of like one
[1:18:50] hundred thousand pounds or something and
[1:18:52] then he can't forgive somebody of like a
[1:18:54] hundred pounds one thing we should have
[1:18:58] is radical forgiveness in our church
[1:19:01] remember Philemon story
[1:19:04] I'll just read out of here Paul
[1:19:06] requested that Philemon offer generous
[1:19:09] forgiveness to a Inessa mmus his former
[1:19:12] slave now this Inessa miss had ran away
[1:19:15] from a slave owner Philemon
[1:19:17] that it cost him a lot of money you know
[1:19:20] slaves were very expensive that cost him
[1:19:23] a lot of labour too and Paul says I've
[1:19:28] led him to Christ he and he said now
[1:19:30] he's profitable to both of us and Paul
[1:19:35] says receive him as a brother and lay
[1:19:37] his debt on my account
[1:19:40] Oh talk about a Christian active dude
[1:19:45] how much would it cost us to somebody to
[1:19:48] load a part-time employee cost to clean
[1:19:51] your house all year what do you think
[1:19:52] I'll just make a guess how about $30,000
[1:19:56] part-time boss say and that's not even
[1:20:00] the cost to buy the person that's just
[1:20:02] the yearly value he said take that
[1:20:07] 30,000 or bit let's say 50,000 put that
[1:20:10] 50,000 and put it on my account I'll pay
[1:20:12] it off now that's real Christian
[1:20:14] forgiveness right there don't hold it
[1:20:17] against him
[1:20:18] you know he's broken your trust how many
[1:20:20] ever had their trust trust broken yeah
[1:20:23] you bought this servant you know he's
[1:20:25] supposed to he told you he's going to
[1:20:27] stay
[1:20:27] there but he lied and he ran away Church
[1:20:32] let's be a church of giving second and
[1:20:34] third chances fourth we go up to 500
[1:20:41] let's be a church where we give people
[1:20:43] more chances I'm not saying purposely be
[1:20:46] hurt now there are times we do have to
[1:20:49] like Jesus said on Sunday with goddess
[1:20:51] there are some times you have to be used
[1:20:53] despitefully used on purpose okay there
[1:20:57] are so many God will lead you to that or
[1:20:58] the God will just allow it to happen
[1:21:00] well I'm saying like don't let yourself
[1:21:02] be abused right you know better I hope
[1:21:06] everyone derstand what I'm saying
[1:21:08] but let's be a church that gives second
[1:21:11] and third chances now it's different in
[1:21:18] our day because in our day we all got
[1:21:19] cars and we can drive around to any
[1:21:22] church or in the message there's new
[1:21:23] worries just within an hour - there's
[1:21:24] numerous message churches so people can
[1:21:27] leave on church and just be happy the
[1:21:28] other one but those days they couldn't
[1:21:30] do that so some cities just had one
[1:21:33] church and so that person would sin they
[1:21:35] couldn't go to another church they
[1:21:36] couldn't stay at home they must they got
[1:21:38] to go back and make it right that's a
[1:21:40] real example of Christianity third has
[1:21:44] increased your gathering - I preach on
[1:21:45] this all the time so you're familiar
[1:21:47] with Hebrews 10 24 and 25 but I will
[1:21:51] read Romans 12:16 can you put that up
[1:21:53] there when we have fellowships or what
[1:21:56] do we have guess try to condescend to
[1:22:00] the less popular Christians it's okay to
[1:22:04] go say hi to the guest preacher yea
[1:22:05] spend some time talking on the guest
[1:22:06] preacher but make sure according to
[1:22:09] Romans 12:16 make sure you find the
[1:22:13] people that don't get talked to very
[1:22:15] much now be careful like I said like I
[1:22:17] wouldn't go to specific women and just
[1:22:21] spend a lot of time but I might in
[1:22:23] passing shake their hand and move on you
[1:22:24] know what I mean because I don't want to
[1:22:25] look like I'm doing anything evil avoid
[1:22:28] all parents of evil to see being the
[1:22:31] same night one to another might not high
[1:22:33] things but condescend see humble
[1:22:35] yourself to the lowest state the less
[1:22:37] popular or Christians being out why
[1:22:41] in your own conceits this is early
[1:22:44] kindness right it's easy you want to go
[1:22:47] hang around the guest preacher I know
[1:22:48] what that's like it's easy you want to
[1:22:51] go be with the guest preacher's wife you
[1:22:53] know that's easy thing to do and that's
[1:22:56] okay to do but Paul says don't forget to
[1:22:59] humble yourself if your brother if you
[1:23:02] have brotherly kindness and you really
[1:23:04] cherish the whole body of Christ you'll
[1:23:06] want to spend time with the popular ones
[1:23:08] and then unpopular ones because the
[1:23:11] unpopular ones still have a portion of
[1:23:13] God's Spirit that you love right there's
[1:23:16] still something if there are the message
[1:23:18] that they got though the ghost there's
[1:23:19] still something real special about them
[1:23:22] that's right you know James I'll go to
[1:23:27] James to you know this was a trouble in
[1:23:30] the early church and you know that and
[1:23:31] Naomi told me this trouble is something
[1:23:32] in some churches in Ghana if you serve
[1:23:35] people a certain amount of money just
[1:23:37] spend time with those people you got the
[1:23:39] same amount of money you're rich you
[1:23:41] hang out with the rich if you're poor
[1:23:42] you hang out with the poor same thing
[1:23:44] happens in America same thing happens it
[1:23:46] does certainly does James to 1 to 9 I'm
[1:23:53] gonna I - yes to one tonight yeah look
[1:24:03] at verse 2 for if there come unto your
[1:24:05] assembly a man with a gold ring and
[1:24:07] goodly apparel and their coming also a
[1:24:09] poor man and bow raiment and you have
[1:24:10] respect him that where the gate clothing
[1:24:12] is they didn't sit now here in a good
[1:24:14] place and say to the poor stand now here
[1:24:16] or sit here under my footstool are you
[1:24:19] not then partial in yourselves and
[1:24:21] become judges of evil thoughts hearken
[1:24:24] my beloved brethren hath not God chosen
[1:24:25] the poor of this world rich in faith and
[1:24:28] heirs of the kingdom which he had
[1:24:30] promised them they love it Paul says it
[1:24:33] normally works opposite what we think we
[1:24:36] think the guy with the big ring and the
[1:24:37] nice jacket we think he's the one that's
[1:24:39] got so much faith James says it's
[1:24:41] usually the poor people in the message
[1:24:44] that have the thing and the church said
[1:24:47] usually it's the poor why because they
[1:24:50] need God right they they gotta have got
[1:24:52] every day I got it I'm calling
[1:24:54] out on the scene everyday for my general
[1:24:57] necessities I'm not trusting in these
[1:25:00] fleeting riches I'm trusting in eternal
[1:25:03] riches amen James says it usually works
[1:25:06] the opposite so this is an example of
[1:25:13] what burly kindness will produce you
[1:25:16] will see you will want to be around the
[1:25:20] least popular Christians I'm thinking
[1:25:27] about sharing somebody's testimony about
[1:25:28] better not I know people are listening
[1:25:30] I'll just say like this there are some
[1:25:32] people or some churches I love going to
[1:25:34] and they're not very attractive looking
[1:25:36] I've talked about brothers now and
[1:25:39] they're not very nice to look at they
[1:25:40] don't have a lot of money but I tell you
[1:25:42] I feel the love of the Holy Ghost on
[1:25:44] those people and I love spending time
[1:25:46] with some of those people and then the
[1:25:48] rich and the esteemed and the so
[1:25:50] sometimes there's the snobbiest people
[1:25:51] you want to be around and I wonder are
[1:25:52] they even born again right so honestly
[1:25:57] church if you condescend to the lower
[1:25:59] less popular people you probably have a
[1:26:01] better time rather than that less mind
[1:26:04] battle soon cuz this let's say a Spears
[1:26:08] all those rich people might jump on you
[1:26:10] oh you're better than other people not
[1:26:12] better than anybody praise God we're all
[1:26:14] saved by the grace of God and we're all
[1:26:17] a part of a body that needs every person
[1:26:21] like on Sunday I needed Beatrice to hold
[1:26:24] Genevieve until I got back from getting
[1:26:26] the coffee's everybody right is she and
[1:26:29] she stayed with you that was great
[1:26:32] I needed that just a small example you
[1:26:34] know but we all need everybody's
[1:26:36] important pray everybody has a part
[1:26:38] praise God brother Bob says the preacher
[1:26:44] is the least of all because he's the
[1:26:46] servant of all so I need you more than
[1:26:49] you need me maybe that's just my opinion
[1:26:52] but we're swell I'm supposed to be a
[1:26:54] servant give my time get my energy give
[1:26:57] everything I can to the people now
[1:27:03] remember church jesus said you only get
[1:27:05] blessed when you have a fellowship when
[1:27:07] you invite people
[1:27:08] now you get blessed with fellowship with
[1:27:10] Christians but he said you'll get more
[1:27:11] blessed when you only invite the people
[1:27:14] that can't pay you back they can't
[1:27:15] invite you over to a fellowship jesus
[1:27:18] said when you have a meal inviting the
[1:27:19] poor the maimed the the blind the halt
[1:27:23] and the blind because they cannot repay
[1:27:25] you so let's consider that as we go I
[1:27:28] know I know in our society like there's
[1:27:31] not evil people out there right so we
[1:27:34] there's a lot of crazy people we
[1:27:35] probably don't host a lot of free meals
[1:27:37] at our homes right but let's be open
[1:27:39] just to think of our friends that are
[1:27:41] struggling and maybe have them or maybe
[1:27:43] just take them a meal that's the same
[1:27:45] thing have to come to your house you can
[1:27:46] take them a meal just I just want to get
[1:27:52] back to some basics of Christianity's if
[1:27:54] I understand what I'm saying like these
[1:27:55] are real examples of chryses what
[1:27:57] Christians do they pray they give alms
[1:28:01] they fasten it they love other
[1:28:03] Christians and this is what a lot of
[1:28:08] people don't do in the message so we
[1:28:12] want to be what the Bible says were to
[1:28:14] be and be real message believers praise
[1:28:17] God
[1:28:19] okay good five minutes okay yeah so
[1:28:27] we're impartial towards socio-economic
[1:28:31] status we don't favor rich or richer we
[1:28:38] love everybody in the church praise God
[1:28:42] no got two more things I'm sorry yeah
[1:28:47] one more thing as far as the things
[1:28:50] we're going through Christians need to
[1:28:53] pray for one another
[1:28:55] Ephesians 6:18 says a fully-armored
[1:28:58] Christian prays always with all prayer
[1:29:00] and supplication of spirit and watching
[1:29:03] thereunto with all perseverance and
[1:29:05] supplication for All Saints all the
[1:29:11] saints you know Sunday and Wednesday
[1:29:15] it's a good time to pray for everything
[1:29:16] the church Wednesdays usually the day
[1:29:18] where I pray for the minister's you know
[1:29:20] I think that other brothers they're
[1:29:21] laboring on the win
[1:29:22] not a camera I have worked all day and I
[1:29:24] think Lord shrinking brother can anoint
[1:29:26] him tonight for God's glory just praying
[1:29:32] for one another when you hear when we
[1:29:35] hear of Christians suffering persecution
[1:29:37] we should feel their pain and care
[1:29:40] enough to pray for them first
[1:29:42] Corinthians 12 25 and 26 says that there
[1:29:45] should be no schism in the body there's
[1:29:47] no division but that the members should
[1:29:49] have the same care one for another
[1:29:51] whether one member suffer all the
[1:29:53] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:29:55] honored all the members rejoice with it
[1:30:02] so seaters that's where we have to be so
[1:30:05] in tune with people's feelings that's
[1:30:07] why I told you before I can go to being
[1:30:08] so happy for Christians and then so sad
[1:30:10] because I hear about Christians dying or
[1:30:13] people having struggles overseas like
[1:30:16] your heart can break within the matter
[1:30:19] of your moments you can rejoice because
[1:30:21] somebody else has a good testimony or
[1:30:22] God does something great for somebody
[1:30:25] it's just it's being able to feel for
[1:30:28] the entire body of Jesus Christ
[1:30:30] now one more I want to read this here go
[1:30:33] to Psalms 12 verse 6 last one this is
[1:30:40] beautiful now you know the statute over
[1:30:47] man is a little different doctrine
[1:30:48] because it kind of brings a little
[1:30:50] different numerology right Bible
[1:30:54] numerology you know we know there's
[1:30:56] three works of grace but in those three
[1:30:59] works there are seven works in the three
[1:31:01] so I don't understand that yet but with
[1:31:08] the stature of a man there's seven
[1:31:09] anointings
[1:31:10] and then the eight caps it all office
[1:31:12] seals it all in which is kind of strange
[1:31:15] but we know eight represents a new
[1:31:17] beginning or the first all over or
[1:31:18] eternity look what the scripture says
[1:31:21] I'm I was just when I was writing this
[1:31:23] chapter I was just praying God send me a
[1:31:25] scripture that I can see clearly the
[1:31:27] stature of a perfect man amen
[1:31:30] the words of the Lord
[1:31:32] our pure pure words as silver how many
[1:31:36] times has tried a silver trying the
[1:31:39] furnace of Earth purified seven times
[1:31:43] now that's silver what about gold right
[1:31:47] this is silver so Redemption right
[1:31:49] silver represents Redemption right the
[1:31:51] silver that had to be paid for each soul
[1:31:54] each so all the silver shekels the men
[1:31:57] had to pay to redeem their souls to the
[1:31:59] tabernacle have to preach a whole
[1:32:00] separate sermon on that but silver
[1:32:03] always represents Redemption gold
[1:32:04] represents deity no so in other words in
[1:32:08] order to finish your purification your

[1:32:39] like God how can I have the character of
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ you must be purified seven
[1:32:44] times seven anointings
[1:32:48] see you must reject those seven devices
