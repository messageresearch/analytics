[27:08] [Music]
[27:29] I'm gonna be I'm trying to be mindful
[27:31] the time here tonight by God's grace so
[27:38] I'm going to set a timer here let's go
[27:39] out a few portions of Scripture I want
[27:42] to continue on the kingdom of heaven by
[27:44] God's grace let's start in Matthew 21 33
[27:49] [Music]
[27:54] we're making our way through the
[27:56] parables by the grace of the Lord 16 of
[27:59] them that I could find and today I would
[28:04] like to look at the wicked husbandmen
[28:06] and the king's son if we have time we'll
[28:09] look at the ten virgins as well a little
[28:11] more we preach on that a few weeks ago
[28:13] but it was kind of unplanned for so I do
[28:16] have
[28:18] more I like to preach on that by God's
[28:20] grace so Matthew 21 33 praise God 21 33
[28:43] now for the sake of time let's go down
[28:49] and let's well it's our 33 most of us
[28:55] will remember this as we read it Matthew
[28:56] 21 33 here another parable there was a
[28:59] certain householder which planted a
[29:01] vineyard and hedge it round about and
[29:02] digged a winepress in it and built a
[29:05] tower and let it out to the husbandmen
[29:07] and went into a far country and when the
[29:11] time of the fruit drew near he sent his
[29:13] servants to the husbandmen and that they
[29:16] might receive the fruits of it and the
[29:18] husbandmen took his servants and beat
[29:20] one and killed another and stoned
[29:21] another again he sent other servants
[29:24] more than the first and they did unto
[29:26] them likewise but last of all he sent
[29:29] unto them his son saying they will
[29:32] reverence my son but when the husbandmen
[29:35] saw the son they said among themselves
[29:36] this is the heir come let us kill him
[29:38] and let us seize on his inheritance
[29:40] verse 39 they caught him and cast him
[29:43] out of the vineyard and slew him verse
[29:45] 40 when the Lord therefore of the
[29:46] vineyard cometh what will he do unto
[29:49] those husbandmen they say unto him he
[29:52] will miserably destroy those wicked men
[29:54] and will let out his vineyard unto other
[29:56] husbandmen which shall render him the
[29:58] fruits in their seasons jesus saith on
[30:01] them did you never read in the
[30:02] scriptures the stone which the builders
[30:03] rejected the same has become the head of
[30:06] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[30:09] it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I
[30:12] say to you the kingdom of God shall be
[30:14] taken from you and given to a nation
[30:16] bringing forth the fruits thereof and
[30:19] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[30:22] be broken I notice you either fall on
[30:24] the stone or the stone falls on you but
[30:29] on whom said
[30:29] shall fall it will grind him into powder
[30:32] so which one do we want we want to be
[30:34] falling on the stone we don't want the
[30:37] stone to fall on us like in Daniels
[30:39] vision the stone comes out of heaven
[30:41] right and smashes the image at the feet
[30:43] we want to fall on the Lord verse 45 and
[30:47] when the chief priests and Pharisees had
[30:49] heard his parables they perceived that
[30:51] he spake of them and when they sought to
[30:53] lay hands on him they feared the
[30:55] multitude because they took him for a
[30:57] profit let's have one more word of
[30:59] Prayer here bow our heads and let's ask
[31:00] the Lord and minister here tonight
[31:01] Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord
[31:04] we're just a little a number but Lord it
[31:05] never matters because when the angels of
[31:07] God are present Lord we know they bring
[31:09] your presence Lord God and father you
[31:12] promised to be where two or three are
[31:13] there's nowhere else we'd rather be than
[31:15] in your house dear God so we thank you
[31:17] Lord for this opportunity to take your
[31:19] word now break it to your people and I
[31:21] pray Lord let the Holy Spirit minister
[31:23] to every heart reveal your word as you
[31:25] so often do dear God feed your people or
[31:28] this is a table where the saints of God
[31:31] are fed Lord by the spread out Word of
[31:34] God and father we love you we exalt you
[31:36] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[31:38] said Amen god bless yous being seated
[31:40] praise God now that just reminds me a
[31:43] few Sundays ago when I preached on the
[31:46] Kingdom of Heaven on a Sunday morning
[31:48] I'm sorry I preached on the gifts of God
[31:50] I was mentioning how in the parable
[31:53] member how in the parable of the pounds
[31:54] the the wicked servant had the cloth
[31:57] remember that and he wrapped the pound
[31:59] in the cloth and he brought the cloth to
[32:02] Jesus and Jesus was very upset and I'll
[32:05] just like to share this just because it
[32:07] was true and it was a little testimony
[32:08] of how the Lord speaks a few days before
[32:11] that one of the sisters in the church
[32:12] had a dream about somebody coming to put
[32:15] a cloth on the table in front of her and
[32:18] she stood up took the cloth off and
[32:21] threw it down and I just said preach it
[32:25] that morning so she had a few days then
[32:27] I come and preach it and church was that
[32:30] shows it shows God's trying to speak to
[32:32] us the table represents what God's place
[32:36] where God's children to eat and so when
[32:38] someone kind tries to cover that over
[32:40] and someone tries to cover it over with
[32:43] a man
[32:43] and made idea what do we got to do we
[32:45] got to take that I'd man-made idea and
[32:47] cast it down in the name of Jesus amen
[32:49] so we know that happens here tonight to
[32:52] ever the word is preached and hearts are
[32:53] hungry the word discerns the thoughts
[32:56] intents of the heart praise God now
[32:58] let's look at the wicked husbandmen
[32:59] tonight by God's grace and then Lord
[33:02] willing we'll have time for the king's
[33:03] son King son kind of goes with last
[33:05] week's ones we looked at I do have a few
[33:08] quotes Lydia I'm sorry not quotes rather
[33:10] but just the visuals to kind of keep us
[33:12] on track if you want to switch over
[33:14] there the wicked husbandmen the the I
[33:18] say like this you know the the the
[33:20] symbols are very obvious in this parable
[33:23] it's a beautiful picture here of Christ
[33:26] and the Jews and Gentiles so on my
[33:30] little outline there you know we preach
[33:32] on the endtime conditions here the
[33:34] parables and now you know tonight we
[33:36] look at the wicked husbandmen we looked
[33:38] at the great supper we in fact we ended
[33:39] with the great supper last week and
[33:42] there's a great correlation both of
[33:44] these deal with the Jew and Gentile in
[33:46] the great supper remember the rich man
[33:50] just invites all the Evite's his people
[33:53] close to him burst they turn him down
[33:55] which we know was the Jew and then he
[33:57] goes out into the streets and he invites
[33:59] the the lamed the lame halt in the blind
[34:01] and we saw how the scripture says that
[34:04] Jesus when he would minister that the
[34:06] publicans and the sinners that all of
[34:09] the Pharisees would get upset but he
[34:11] said he said those that are sick need a
[34:13] physician amen so the lowest of the low
[34:17] so the ones next next to the rich man
[34:20] here that got their first invitation
[34:21] represent the Pharisees Sadducees the
[34:24] men that should have received it that
[34:25] were closest to the temple of God but
[34:29] the low the lower Jews or the the least
[34:33] esteemed Jews those were the ones that
[34:35] were out in the streets and when when
[34:37] they came in the sermon said well we
[34:38] brought in as many as we could he said
[34:40] okay he said fine go out to the highways
[34:42] and hedges praise God and bring them in
[34:45] that my house may be filled praise the
[34:47] Lord and so that represent the Gentiles
[34:49] for the Gentiles were afar off Paul says
[34:52] remember that so the great supper was a
[34:54] parable or the Jew and the Gentile
[34:57] and now the wicked husbandmen is the
[34:59] same
[35:00] it shows how although many of the Jews
[35:03] reject it not all but many of them did
[35:06] the Jews gladly received the kingdom of
[35:10] God and will bring forth fruit unto God
[35:13] in their season praise God
[35:15] how many know we're in the season of
[35:16] harvest time it's Laodicea it's the last
[35:19] church age amen it is harvest time this
[35:22] is the age of harvest praise God and
[35:24] what's Uniting time the tares are being
[35:27] bound together rogram plainly says in
[35:28] the church age book that's the season
[35:30] we're in uniting time binding their
[35:32] binding together world economical
[35:34] councils but we've got to bind together
[35:36] to the Word of God amen
[35:38] and so see here we are in the wicked
[35:40] husbandmen and we see that this is a
[35:42] parable
[35:43] now don't forget this - I'll make sure I
[35:45] want to say this hear the word kingdom
[35:48] means Dominion or rule right so the
[35:51] kingdom of the revelation of the kingdom
[35:53] of heaven is the revelation of God's
[35:56] rule in the hearts of his people praise
[35:59] God because Jesus said the kingdom of
[36:01] God doesn't come with observation he
[36:03] said the kingdom of God is within you so
[36:05] the revelation of the mystery of the
[36:08] kingdom of heaven is God having dominion
[36:11] over his people's lives and he does it
[36:13] through the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[36:15] amen and then through that power through
[36:17] that that indwelling presence God says
[36:21] in 2nd Corinthians 6 he said this is
[36:23] what's different from the Old Testament
[36:24] he says come out from among them and
[36:26] then he says I will be your God he said
[36:29] I walk in you amen I'll talk through you
[36:32] I'll live in you and I'll be your God
[36:34] amen that's the beauty of the New
[36:36] Testament the beauty of the New
[36:38] Testament is God's permanent dwelling
[36:40] place in the Tabernacles or temples of
[36:43] the people of God amen hallelujah
[36:47] that's God's kingdom is Dominion in the
[36:50] lives and in the souls of the believers
[36:53] praise God so see when we have when we
[36:56] know the meanings of all sixteen of
[36:58] these parables then we have a complete
[37:00] understanding of God's Dominion or rule
[37:03] in the life of the New Testament
[37:05] Christian praise God and it also shows
[37:08] how it shows you
[37:11] or individual roll men we looked at the
[37:12] stewardship yeah it shows your
[37:15] individual role there's four I'm sorry
[37:18] three parables that show your
[37:19] responsibility my responsibility to be
[37:23] good stewards in the kingdom of heaven
[37:25] praise God mine oh it's so important
[37:28] through these revelations we see our
[37:31] individual role plus we see the kingdoms
[37:34] enemies praise God as we saw God always
[37:37] unmasks the enemies and we saw it we saw
[37:41] with the grain of mustardseed
[37:42] right we saw how that Antichrist comes
[37:45] in like a very small lie but it grows
[37:47] into something great we saw it last week
[37:49] with the leaven right
[37:50] Satan comes in while the evil woman the
[37:53] Roman Catholic Church mixes her eleven
[37:55] and three measures of meal father son
[37:57] Holy Ghost right my and see how he comes
[38:00] in we you know we're we're privileged in
[38:02] the mysteries of the kingdom we're
[38:05] privileged to see our role our
[38:07] responsibility our stewardship but also
[38:09] how sin enters amen and then we're also
[38:12] able to see how the Spirit of God enters
[38:15] amen I don't know which will get to
[38:17] lower wedding next week there's five
[38:19] parables just about salvation so this is
[38:21] how the kingdom of God gets started in
[38:23] your life praise God it gets started
[38:25] through these parables and then there's
[38:27] course the other parables about the Holy
[38:29] Ghost that show how God's Spirit takes
[38:32] full Dominion praise the Lord and how it
[38:35] represents the born-again experience
[38:37] hallelujah now so let's go back here and
[38:41] let's look at that wicked husbandmen
[38:42] briefly as far as the chapter I've been
[38:45] riding on this I got it done but this is
[38:46] the shortest section because it's so
[38:49] obvious the the symbols are so so clear
[38:53] that it doesn't take a lot of proof to
[38:55] kind of back it up so it takes less
[38:58] scripture now in this parable we read it
[39:01] to you God offers he offers the vineyard
[39:06] to the Jews but they turn it down
[39:09] right but then he gives it to the
[39:11] Gentiles who will bring forth fruit unto
[39:13] God now Jesus interprets this in verse
[39:17] 43 Mathew 21:43 because they start to
[39:21] get a little bit of common sense they
[39:23] started looking a discernment and they
[39:24] say
[39:24] Jesus talking about us were the ones
[39:26] that are gonna kill him they're gonna
[39:27] kill the Sun and they get a little bit
[39:30] of discernment and Jesus said did you
[39:32] never read in the scriptures the stone
[39:34] which the builders rejected the same has
[39:36] become the head of the corner this is
[39:38] the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in
[39:41] our eyes right
[39:44] can you imagine you're gonna build a
[39:45] house but then you reject the
[39:46] cornerstone like that what kind of what
[39:50] kind of destruction would would would
[39:52] you expect like you could only expect
[39:54] destruction to not have a cornerstone a
[39:57] real solid piece that's going to hold
[39:59] everything together my like you're just
[40:01] you're wasting your time
[40:03] you reject the cornerstone the most
[40:06] important piece the piece you got to
[40:08] take and spend the most time on to make
[40:10] sure it's perfectly level it's perfectly
[40:12] solid it's good son the good foundation
[40:15] the rock and yet they reject the very
[40:18] cornerstone he had signs wonders
[40:21] miracles he cast out Devils he healed
[40:23] the sick he healed every manner of
[40:25] sickness they should they they knew they
[40:27] should have accepted him right
[40:28] they knew Nicodemus said we know your
[40:30] teacher sent from God they knew he was
[40:32] the cornerstone but he said let his
[40:34] blood be upon us in our hands and our
[40:36] children for every generation because
[40:39] they didn't want to change their
[40:40] denomination amen my oh but you and I we
[40:43] left all denomination to have the
[40:45] cornerstone Amen what we wanted we want
[40:49] the stone Amen hallelujah but see
[40:53] interprets it verse 43 therefore say I
[40:56] unto you kinda like last week remember
[40:57] last week with the great supper Jesus
[40:59] said it's my supper remember that the
[41:01] man's a tall one day will sit in the
[41:03] kingdom of God and eat and Jesus said
[41:05] listen it's my supper the invitations
[41:07] out right now boy he said you know don't
[41:10] talk about the future recognize that
[41:11] right now praise God don't miss what
[41:13] God's doing right now I'm the same for
[41:15] us we always look for the rapture we
[41:17] always look you know to the marriage
[41:18] supper or the Millennium but let's not
[41:20] get our eyes too far there let's see
[41:21] what God's doing right now let's not
[41:23] miss what God is trying to do in our
[41:25] lives right now praise God but in verse
[41:29] 43 interprets a force and he says
[41:32] therefore sad to you the kingdom of God
[41:34] shall be taken from you look at that
[41:36] my Jesus was so
[41:38] Strait wasn't he for a while you give
[41:40] him like little parables about that he'd
[41:42] come around and say listen it's my
[41:44] supper
[41:44] the kingdom was given to you but I'm
[41:46] gonna take it from you look at it mine
[41:50] and these little small groups that he's
[41:52] preaching in here my I love how Jesus
[41:55] you know you he would give him a chance
[41:56] you know to recognize the truth but then
[41:59] he bring it right down to them and
[42:00] they've got to make a decision he said
[42:04] I'll be taken from you and given to a
[42:07] nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
[42:09] and whosoever shall fall on this stone
[42:13] shall be broken but on who sever it
[42:15] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[42:19] amen in other words it's like Jesus is
[42:22] our landing place praise God remember
[42:24] the Bible said church don't let this
[42:26] some of you but the Bible said a broken
[42:28] and contrite spirit is those welcome
[42:30] sacrifice in the sight of God that's
[42:33] what he's talking about he's your
[42:35] foundation and you've got to let
[42:37] yourself fall on him praise God in other
[42:39] words you got to let you let yourself at
[42:41] the mercy of God in other words God you
[42:44] just have mercy on my life I'll oh you
[42:47] take all responsibility for me I don't
[42:49] have a thought coming praise God I want
[42:52] your will I just want your perfect will
[42:54] all my life is in your hands I bring
[42:56] myself broken amen
[42:58] remember that scripture I just read this
[42:59] we go to Micah if you got a chance this
[43:02] scripture has always been a blessing to
[43:04] me Obadiah Jonah Micah
[43:10] he's got a scene that song in my head
[43:11] Obadiah Jonah Micah Nahum always I just
[43:15] that's one thing I got at work on
[43:17] Obadiah Jonah Micah Nahum now what have
[43:26] you
[43:27] full beautiful book this is now I gotta
[43:30] find it I think I got a marked out in my
[43:32] Bible yes now go to chapter 6 please
[43:38] Micah chapter 6 just reading it my being
[43:41] blessed this week reading the word and
[43:42] the morning devotions what a blessing it
[43:44] is to hear the word of the Lord now Mike
[43:48] of course is prophesying at a time of
[43:50] where destructions at hand at the time
[43:52] of Isaiah and they're very close to
[43:55] being in high as a kite very close just
[43:56] a few generations away to the judgment
[43:59] falling on Jerusalem and being scattered
[44:01] and taken out of the Holy Land and
[44:03] they're given warning after warning
[44:05] he's another voice of warning well look
[44:08] what he says now I'd like to uh let's
[44:15] actually let's go to verse three all my
[44:17] people what have I done unto thee Micah
[44:19] six three and wherein have I wearied
[44:21] thee look the people are tired with God
[44:23] and God can sense it
[44:24] this is George God can sense when we get
[44:26] weary right but we don't get weird with
[44:29] God we just get weary in the flesh right
[44:32] because in this case they were they were
[44:35] wrong for being with they were just
[44:36] tired of serving God we're not tired of
[44:38] serving God our bodies just get tired
[44:40] serving God right in the midst of sermon
[44:43] because we're attacked on every side
[44:44] especially in the mind but see Israel
[44:48] got weary with just going to church they
[44:50] taught weary with offering sacrifices
[44:52] even though that will see that they they
[44:55] gladly gave a lot
[44:57] he said testify against me other words
[44:59] what have I done - we are you testify
[45:00] against me for I brought thee up out of
[45:03] the land of Egypt and redeemed me out of
[45:04] the house of the servants and I sent
[45:06] before thee Moses Aaron and Miriam
[45:08] that all encourage our sisters right
[45:10] sisters did you catch that God said but
[45:14] what have I done I've sent you to men
[45:16] and I've sent you a woman
[45:18] Miriam led them in worship did she not
[45:20] as far as the women the tambourine
[45:23] players she led them in dancing so God's
[45:25] remembering or trying to remind those
[45:26] sisters listen I sent you Miriam see
[45:30] he's trying to get him to see it's not
[45:31] all about the men women got important
[45:33] part in this - and wasn't she a
[45:35] prophetess am i right is it was it
[45:37] Miriam a prophetess so not only did she
[45:39] prophesy
[45:40] and foretell things she also danced and
[45:42] worshiped it was a great part of the
[45:45] woman's worship amen
[45:46] see God's got to remind them that listen
[45:49] women you got important part to play as
[45:50] well everybody's got an important part
[45:52] to play amen
[45:54] see verse 5 o my people remember how
[45:58] what Balak king of Moab consulting and
[46:01] what Balaam the son of Beor answered him
[46:04] from him unto gilga that ye may
[46:07] know the righteousness of the Lord he's
[46:10] saying don't forget what Balaam and
[46:11] Balak did they sold out the word right
[46:15] for money number six where we shall come
[46:18] before the Lord and by myself before the
[46:20] High God shall I come before him with
[46:22] burnt offerings with calves of a year
[46:24] old verse seven will the Lord be pleased
[46:29] with thousands of rams or attend
[46:31] thousands of rivers of oil shall I give
[46:33] my firstborn for my transgression the
[46:35] fruit of my body for the sin of my you
[46:37] see this is what the carnal mind thinks
[46:39] Oh Lord God just wants more of my Rams
[46:41] he wants a thousand Rams or a thousand
[46:45] rivers of oil or he wants me to give my
[46:47] firstborn or give up my body but God is
[46:52] trying to correct them and say you got
[46:53] the wrong attitude
[46:54] you've got a slave's attitude rather
[46:57] than the attitude of love right they got
[47:00] a legalistic attitude instead of a
[47:02] attitude of love now verse eight he has
[47:05] showed the old man what is good and what
[47:07] does the Lord require thee but to do
[47:10] justly and to love mercy and to walk
[47:12] humbly with I God amen
[47:15] see they thought it was just more works
[47:17] more works more works but God's saying
[47:19] this and just get your heart right it's
[47:21] not that you have to do more works just
[47:23] make sure your heart is right in the
[47:24] works that you're doing amen see what
[47:27] does God require God's not ask him for a
[47:29] thousand rams see he's not asking for
[47:32] something that will just physically kill
[47:34] you he's not asking for that he's asking
[47:37] for mercy
[47:38] right adjust and humble heart that's all
[47:41] he's asking for and of course the other
[47:43] Commandments but see they were taking it
[47:45] so far that God was like a legalistic
[47:48] God God just wanted more and more and
[47:50] more but God's asking I'm not asking for
[47:52] all that I'm asking for your heart
[47:54] and then church you know if your hearts
[47:56] in it the works will follow right when
[48:00] you're in love with God is it hard to
[48:01] come to church when you're in love with
[48:02] God never never see it's just when we
[48:06] get discouraged in our minds and we
[48:07] battle in our minds now go to chapter 7
[48:10] the last chapter I just want to read
[48:12] this because it's encouraging you know
[48:20] God offered a lot of judgment against
[48:22] Israel but he also ends this word from
[48:25] the Prophet with hope hope of the
[48:27] restoration yeah this is 710 BC
[48:32] according to Scofield and Usher's
[48:34] timeline verse 18 who is a God like
[48:37] under thee that part of this iniquity
[48:39] and passeth by the transgression of the
[48:42] remnant of his heritage
[48:43] he retained a--the not his anger forever
[48:45] because he delighteth in mercy church
[48:49] listen you know the devil is always
[48:50] trying to get you to think God is upset
[48:52] with you but look God delights and mercy
[48:55] God delights and forgiving you praise
[48:58] God God delights when you come back and
[49:01] you failed again and just ask for
[49:03] repentance and ask for grace God
[49:05] delights in that praise God if your
[49:07] heart is right God loves when you come
[49:09] to him and say you're sorry he delights
[49:13] in having mercy remember Jesus said how
[49:15] many times you know Peter said how many
[49:17] times should I forgive seventy times
[49:18] seven 490 so think of that 490 times he
[49:22] delights in it you forgiving your
[49:24] brother and how much more God forgiving
[49:27] us if he delights in you for giving your
[49:30] brother five hundred times in a day I
[49:32] think he said or not oh how much more
[49:35] will God delight in mercy on us never I
[49:39] read that this morning I finished
[49:40] Michael this morning that was a
[49:41] beautiful encouragement look at that
[49:44] verse 19
[49:44] even though Israel's judge listen he
[49:47] will turn again he will have compassion
[49:49] upon us he will subdue our iniquities
[49:51] and that will cast all their sins into
[49:54] the depths of the sea the sea of
[49:56] forgetfulness praise God now I will
[49:59] perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy
[50:01] to Abraham which thou has sworn unto our
[50:04] fathers from the days of old and you
[50:06] can't have Abraham
[50:08] promised to Abraham without the promise
[50:10] B seed because Abraham is connected to
[50:13] his seed because all the blessings
[50:15] extended extend to Abraham and his seed
[50:18] after him praise God because memory the
[50:20] promise was to Abraham your seed shall
[50:22] possess the gates of their enemies amen
[50:25] and Galatians 3 says those who have
[50:27] faith in Christ they are the seed of
[50:29] Abraham hallelujah so see that we see
[50:33] this as a compound prophecy praise God
[50:35] not just a Jews but also spiritual Jews
[50:39] the Gentiles praise God the New
[50:42] Testament church amen we can see that
[50:43] without much you don't need a real
[50:46] spiritual mind to see that if you know
[50:48] Galatians chapter 3 so church be
[50:51] encouraged who's a god like unto our God
[50:52] who delights in mercy amen
[50:56] there is no God like our God amen the
[50:59] Lord Most High hallelujah and what is
[51:02] the required beecher CH but to do justly
[51:05] to do the right thing and to love mercy
[51:09] and to walk humbly with your God amen
[51:13] now let's head back to Matthew 21 I just
[51:16] I wasn't actually planning that I
[51:17] thought just kind of came to me so let's
[51:19] go to I just seen how it connected with
[51:22] the message so Jesus interest
[51:31] parable and he declares to the Jews that
[51:35] the kingdom of God is taken from them so
[51:37] now the symbol their obvious the
[51:40] Heavenly Father is the householder the
[51:42] owner of the vineyard or the kingdom of
[51:44] God Israel represents the husbandmen to
[51:46] whom the householder and trusts its
[51:48] fruit too but when the householder sent
[51:51] servants to receive the fruit the
[51:53] husbandmen beat killed and stolen them
[51:55] Jesus says these servants represent the
[51:58] Old Testament prophets God sent to
[51:59] Israel because they rejected them Luke
[52:03] 13:34 says o Jerusalem Jerusalem which
[52:06] killest the prophets and stonest them
[52:08] that are sent unto thee how often would
[52:10] I have gathered thy children together as
[52:12] a hen death gather her brood under her
[52:14] wings and ye would not how the Lord now
[52:18] how they'll think about that they
[52:20] rejected it but think about us were the
[52:22] ones that are supposed to enjoy coming
[52:24] close to Jesus's bosom amen like john up
[52:27] in his bosom they didn't you know the
[52:32] israel they didn't want to be like the
[52:35] little chicks right that come to the
[52:37] mother hen to get warm but we're the
[52:39] ones who want to be warm under mother
[52:40] hen right we're the ones that want to be
[52:43] warm bye mama
[52:44] amen mama God we know he's Papa God and
[52:46] Mama God always thinking for the bills
[52:48] taking Papa God he saved me he's mama
[52:52] God and Papa God see how God does that
[52:54] amen
[52:56] lastly after all those servants have
[52:59] been killed he sends his son to receive
[53:01] the fruit and this represents the father
[53:04] sending Jesus but the chief priests and
[53:06] Pharisees crucified him and noticed they
[53:09] put him out of the vineyard or without
[53:11] the gate see that of Jerusalem remember
[53:14] in the parable he took him without the
[53:16] the vineyard and that's just like Jesus
[53:18] was taken outside the city of Jerusalem
[53:21] to be crucified
[53:23] alright now the Pharisees and priests
[53:30] can see that Jesus is likening them to
[53:34] the wicked husbandmen and then he quotes
[53:36] psalms 118 22 and 23 which talk about
[53:40] them rejecting the Cornerstone
[53:43] oh my there's force
[53:45] the New Testament that called Jesus the
[53:47] cornerstone praise God acts 4:11 romans
[53:51] 9 33 ephesians 2:20 and first Peter 2:7
[53:56] they all call Jesus the stone and now
[53:59] that they call us the living stones
[54:01] praise God
[54:03] so we're a stone we're a solid Christian
[54:06] praise God
[54:07] we've got in other words we've got
[54:08] building properties God can build upon
[54:11] our lives amen god we're a part of the
[54:15] building of god
[54:16] our ministries are building something
[54:18] for the kingdom of god the bible calls
[54:20] it a dwelling place the Church of Jesus
[54:23] Christ is the dwelling place and the
[54:25] habitation of the Holy Spirit amen
[54:27] hallelujah praise God
[54:31] yeah see Paul echoes this Paul echoes
[54:37] Jesus's sentence against Israel in acts
[54:41] 28:28 he said be it known therefore unto
[54:44] you that the salvation of God is set
[54:46] under the Gentiles and that they will
[54:48] hear it I was at my wife and I were just
[54:50] talking about some of the some of the
[54:52] the wickedness around the world you know
[54:55] but we were just I was just thanking the
[54:56] Lord lord thank you that my eyes can see
[54:59] amen thank you Lord that I can see the
[55:03] truth of the word of God amen because so
[55:06] many can't they can see a lot of it but
[55:08] they can't see the mysteries of God they
[55:10] can't see the rapture mystery right mine
[55:14] they can't see the wheat and the tares
[55:15] they they can't see a lot of these
[55:17] mysteries but blessed are your eyes for
[55:19] they see hallelujah amen now this
[55:24] parable again ends like that with a
[55:26] great warning and then the Jews of
[55:31] course are very upset and we know that
[55:36] Jesus says they're the ones that are
[55:38] gonna reject the kingdom of heaven and
[55:41] is going to go to another nation it's
[55:43] gonna go to the Gentiles praise God
[55:47] all right now that one's done I'm gonna
[55:49] be done with that one let's go to the
[55:51] king's son so go to Matthew 22 the next
[55:54] chapter see some of these are pretty
[55:57] obvious to see
[55:59] and you can see how they clearly deal
[56:01] with the Jew and Gentile can't you see
[56:03] that it's clear how these deal with the
[56:04] Jew and Gentile so within the the 16
[56:08] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven Jesus
[56:10] is giving more support within there to
[56:12] show and prove to everyone this
[56:14] transition from Jew over to Gentile oh
[56:17] my the Bible said it was the cross haha
[56:21] my the cross broke down the middle wall
[56:23] perdition against between the Jew and
[56:25] Gentile the cross did that the blood of
[56:28] Jesus was so powerful what blood have
[56:31] you ever seen that tears down walls amen
[56:33] blood that shed that's all it takes
[56:35] was the blood to be shed and then the
[56:38] wall was torn down between Jew and
[56:39] Gentile it was broken down and it broke
[56:42] up all division and it brought unity
[56:44] we're all brothers and sisters amen by
[56:47] the blood of Jesus Christ we're all one
[56:49] family of God the family of the kingdom
[56:51] amen
[56:52] oh what a glorious truth that is
[56:55] hallelujah Matthew 22 verse 1 my I told
[56:59] you I try to be mindful the time here I
[57:02] was gonna try to preach 45 minutes I
[57:04] think I can do it by God's grace I only
[57:06] got 15 left I've already preached 1/2
[57:07] hour can you believe that I just can't
[57:10] believe how fast it goes but you know
[57:13] the kids are in school now I know you
[57:14] know kids are in school and I've been
[57:18] getting up extra early to do everything
[57:19] too so I want to be mindful the time
[57:21] especially during the school year now
[57:23] Matthew 22 1 2 14 now this is very
[57:29] similar to the parable that we did
[57:32] earlier parmi of the king's son I'm
[57:36] sorry oh not that one of the great
[57:39] supper yeah this is very similar to the
[57:41] great supper so the king son is very
[57:43] similar to the great supper because you
[57:46] have an invitation to come to a feasts
[57:48] but this one doesn't give any any detail
[57:52] after that last invitation comes out
[57:54] remember
[57:55] it just says watch and pray remember
[57:57] that it just it just kind of ends that
[57:58] way but in the king son it's different
[58:00] it actually shows you know it shows the
[58:04] Kings the king or the Father come into
[58:07] the the wedding ceremony here the
[58:10] wedding feast and he sees a man without
[58:12] a robe on
[58:13] so that'll be familiar to the children
[58:15] but I want to read the whole parable
[58:17] here to show how it's similar and show
[58:19] how it's different so Matthew 22 1 and
[58:22] jesus answered and spake unto them again
[58:24] by parables and said the kingdom of
[58:26] heaven is like on a certain King which
[58:28] made a marriage now that's what's
[58:30] different as well remember the other one
[58:32] was just a rich man who made a feast
[58:34] well now this parable is a father who is
[58:37] putting a feast on for his son and send
[58:42] forth his servants to call them that
[58:43] were bidden to the wedding and they
[58:45] would not come again he sent forth other
[58:48] servants saying tell them which are
[58:50] bidden saying tell that I'm sorry tell
[58:52] them which are bidden behold I prepared
[58:54] my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
[58:55] killed and all things are ready come
[58:57] unto the marriage but they made light of
[59:01] it and went their ways one to his farm
[59:03] another to his merchandise and the
[59:05] Renmin took his servants and entreated
[59:06] them spitefully and slew them but when
[59:09] the king heard thereof he was wroth and
[59:11] he sent forth his armies and destroyed
[59:12] those murderers and burned up their City
[59:14] then saith he to his servants the
[59:17] wedding is ready but they which were
[59:18] bidden were not worthy go ye therefore
[59:21] into the highways and as many as ye
[59:23] shall find bid to the marriage so those
[59:26] servants went into the highways and
[59:27] gathered together oh as many as they
[59:30] found both good and bad and the wedding
[59:32] was furnished with guests and when the
[59:34] king came in I look at here's the king
[59:36] coming in to see the guests right before
[59:40] the wedding
[59:41] so this is why I've said before I
[59:43] believe right before the rapture the
[59:44] Holy Ghost is going to come down the
[59:46] church and it's gonna remove all the
[59:48] foolish version or in this case this
[59:51] might be a Judas because of what happens
[59:53] to him he gets cast where there's
[59:54] weeping and gnashing of teeth so this
[59:55] kind of looks like a Judas upon a deeper
[59:59] examination and I say that church I say
[1:00:03] that because I've studied it out and all
[1:00:04] the weeping and gnashing scriptures
[1:00:06] reveal or I'm sorry relate to the lake
[1:00:09] of fire ok I know it sounds like it
[1:00:12] could be the tribulation it very well
[1:00:14] could be and I could I could accept that
[1:00:16] too but if you just look up weeping and
[1:00:18] gnashing it's always related to the
[1:00:22] Tribulation Period ok or lake of fire
[1:00:25] I'm sorry lake of fire
[1:00:26] so it's related to Lake of Fire how to
[1:00:28] read a couple of scriptures here to show
[1:00:30] it now verse 11 when the king came in to
[1:00:36] see the guests he saw there a man which
[1:00:37] had not on a wedding garment and he say
[1:00:40] that a friend how camest thou in hither
[1:00:42] not having a wedding garment and he was
[1:00:44] speechless then said the King to the
[1:00:47] servants bind him hand and foot and take
[1:00:49] him away and cast him in outer darkness
[1:00:51] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[1:00:53] teeth
[1:00:53] for many are called but few are chosen
[1:00:56] alright let's go through some of the
[1:00:58] symbols here so the revelation here is
[1:01:02] that the Jews are first invited but most
[1:01:07] of them reject it but the Gentiles
[1:01:10] respond to God's invitation for the
[1:01:12] rapture and are appropriately clothed in
[1:01:15] the wedding garment of the baptism of
[1:01:17] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:18] praise God amen the Jews turned it down
[1:01:21] right most of them not all but most of
[1:01:23] them turned it down so this King
[1:01:27] represents the Heavenly Father who's
[1:01:29] preparing a wedding for his son Jesus
[1:01:31] Christ and the the marriage represents
[1:01:34] the marriage supper of the lamb taught
[1:01:35] in Revelation 19 verse 9 the supper
[1:01:38] represents the weddings a reception of
[1:01:41] Jesus and his bride the New Testament
[1:01:42] church which takes a place immediately
[1:01:45] after Jesus raptures away his bride
[1:01:47] before the Tribulation Period those that
[1:01:51] were bidden with the first imitation
[1:01:53] that would not come are Israel because
[1:01:55] they rejected their own Messiah the king
[1:01:59] servants who carried the invitations
[1:02:00] were slain by those who would not attend
[1:02:03] the marriage
[1:02:03] they represent the prophets that we read
[1:02:05] about in the previous parable Christ
[1:02:08] spoke of that as well he said he sent
[1:02:11] them all the prophets and they stoned
[1:02:13] them they slew them and kill them now
[1:02:16] like this this is something that was
[1:02:18] fresh to me too
[1:02:19] the king sends his armies to destroy the
[1:02:22] city right and what does that represent
[1:02:24] it represents the burning of Jerusalem
[1:02:28] by the emperor Titus in AD 17 that
[1:02:31] beautiful just to see now what it was
[1:02:33] sad that it happened but it it's
[1:02:34] beautiful to see it Jesus for telling
[1:02:36] Titus is coming in many ways but here
[1:02:39] through a
[1:02:40] parable as the city was burped that was
[1:02:43] in verse 7 the Bible said he burned up
[1:02:46] their city so Jesus was for telling them
[1:02:48] listen because you rejected me I'm gonna
[1:02:50] send Titus and Titus is gonna burn this
[1:02:53] city and burn the walls burn the temple
[1:02:55] right now see the king sends out one
[1:03:00] last invitation to the furthest
[1:03:04] extensive his kingdom to the highways
[1:03:07] the Bible says yes verse 9 go therefore
[1:03:10] into the highways and so this represents
[1:03:16] of course both good and bad guests
[1:03:17] coming so that his wedding is fully
[1:03:19] attended and again this represents the
[1:03:23] Gentiles the invitation of the Gentiles
[1:03:25] the Bible says in Ephesians 2:17 I
[1:03:28] already mentioned it but they were a far
[1:03:30] off from the promises of God so see
[1:03:33] Jesus has to send his servants out to
[1:03:35] the highways afar off the outer extents
[1:03:38] of the kingdom and bring them in that's
[1:03:40] you and I children that's all of us here
[1:03:42] tonight were the ones that were afar off
[1:03:44] we were far from the kingdom of God
[1:03:46] right we were far from knowing about
[1:03:48] God's righteousness but God is mercy
[1:03:51] blind to the Jews that he might take a
[1:03:53] Gentile bride glory Paul Barnabas
[1:03:58] declare this to Israel in acts 1346 then
[1:04:01] Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it
[1:04:03] was necessary that the Word of God
[1:04:05] should first have been preached or
[1:04:06] spoken unto you but seeing that you put
[1:04:09] it from you and judge listen judge
[1:04:11] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:04:14] see brother like brother man said God is
[1:04:17] trying to you know people that go to
[1:04:18] hell they're gonna push their way to
[1:04:20] hell right they're gonna judge
[1:04:22] themselves God really don't even have to
[1:04:24] judge them really because they have
[1:04:26] already judged themselves unworthy they
[1:04:29] judge themselves unworthy of everlasting
[1:04:31] life because they turn down an
[1:04:33] invitation to the most delicious suffer
[1:04:36] you could ever be invited to amen
[1:04:38] they turn it down for what for these
[1:04:41] little measly excuses merchandise farm
[1:04:47] family right marriage and pleasures of
[1:04:50] this world they turn down the greatest
[1:04:53] event of their life
[1:04:54] they turn it down for a little foolish
[1:04:56] things of the world my goodness and so
[1:05:01] he says you judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:05:04] everlasting life lo we turn to the gens
[1:05:06] house
[1:05:08] now that's right because the Jews were
[1:05:10] unworthy of everlasting life just as the
[1:05:13] king called them not worthy in verse 8
[1:05:16] of the wedding member of the Bible said
[1:05:17] that mercy he says but they were not
[1:05:19] worthy just like Paul and Barnabas said
[1:05:23] you judge yourselves unworthy of
[1:05:25] everlasting life so see Jesus calls you
[1:05:28] worthy when you surrender your full
[1:05:30] freemore agency when you give your free
[1:05:33] more agency over to God then God calls
[1:05:35] you worthy because he's such a gentleman
[1:05:38] like I heard today that was such a
[1:05:39] powerful thing I never meant I never
[1:05:41] heard that before
[1:05:42] the rich young ruler turns away from
[1:05:44] Jesus and Jesus brother rain never goes
[1:05:46] up and says no no I'll give you another
[1:05:47] chance come on back Jesus just lets him
[1:05:51] go because he's got it he gives them the
[1:05:54] dignity he gives them the respect to
[1:05:56] make their own decision he's not going
[1:05:58] to force anything my brother man said
[1:05:59] God's not going to force anybody to do
[1:06:01] anything that's why you're free more
[1:06:04] agency your surrender of your free more
[1:06:06] agency to Jesus Christ is your victory
[1:06:09] amen
[1:06:10] because you submit your free more agency
[1:06:13] to your faith the faith of God and the
[1:06:15] Bible said faith is our victory amen
[1:06:17] hallelujah faith is the victory see you
[1:06:22] receiving the revelation of God and
[1:06:24] acting upon it that's right because
[1:06:27] remember all the revelation is is the
[1:06:29] will of God but medicine faith is a
[1:06:30] revelation of the will of God well Cain
[1:06:32] had a revelation then because Cain knew
[1:06:34] what God wanted but he didn't obey it
[1:06:37] he didn't surrender right his free more
[1:06:40] agency to the revelation of God glory
[1:06:44] amen hallelujah he God showed him the
[1:06:48] perfect will of God he turned it down he
[1:06:50] said well then sins gonna be right down
[1:06:52] to your door when you try to soon as you
[1:06:54] try to go out the door your of your home
[1:06:56] the spirits are gonna be right there to
[1:06:58] just you're and you're gonna accept them
[1:07:00] they're gonna jump on you're gonna
[1:07:01] attack you right and you're gonna be
[1:07:03] overcome and you're gonna be a vagabond
[1:07:05] see now what does it show
[1:07:07] it shows we got to have a right life in
[1:07:10] our homes see cuz he said sin lies at
[1:07:12] the door we got to have pure hearts when
[1:07:15] we come out at home amen
[1:07:16] you gotta have a pure heart when you get
[1:07:18] on to your bed in the morning right you
[1:07:20] got to pray or read your Bible until you
[1:07:22] have a pure heart cuz sin lies at the
[1:07:24] door praise God
[1:07:25] oh my thank the Lord
[1:07:29] now the climax of the parable though is
[1:07:32] in the last few verses 11 to 14 and this
[1:07:38] is why it's different this is why the
[1:07:39] king son is different than the other one
[1:07:42] the great supper the great supper just
[1:07:44] talks about three invitations going out
[1:07:46] remember that three invitations to the
[1:07:48] ones close by and then the streets and
[1:07:50] then the highways hedges but this one's
[1:07:52] different
[1:07:53] that deals with Jew and Gentile so does
[1:07:55] this one but this one gets into the
[1:07:57] baptism of Holy Ghost for the Gentile
[1:07:59] sea oh my that's good I never never seen
[1:08:01] it like that mine that's good praise God
[1:08:03] so not only does it go Jew and Gentile
[1:08:06] well then it even brings it to our day
[1:08:08] right then the last day right before the
[1:08:11] wedding the Holy Spirit's going to come
[1:08:13] down a powerfully I believe that's the
[1:08:14] latter rain amen that's part of the
[1:08:17] third pulling then when the King steps
[1:08:20] down amongst his church and he starts
[1:08:22] looking say look your brother raised got
[1:08:24] the white garment on praise God sister
[1:08:26] Beatrice look she dressed in white
[1:08:28] hallelujah but see she but but see she's
[1:08:31] gonna find some of these make believers
[1:08:33] amongst us
[1:08:34] like he's found in the last few years
[1:08:35] right and they might have signs miracles
[1:08:38] and wonders they might be among us they
[1:08:39] might have a some kind of a testimony
[1:08:41] but they're not born again and Jesus
[1:08:45] gonna say where's the baptism of Holy
[1:08:46] Ghost in your life they can't say
[1:08:49] anything speechless nothing to say no in
[1:08:53] other words they don't overcome by the
[1:08:54] word of their testimony they have no
[1:08:57] testimony why because they're not under
[1:08:59] the blood of the lamb they never really
[1:09:01] repented their sins they never really
[1:09:03] had an experience with God oh my thank
[1:09:06] God when we can cry out it cry it out at
[1:09:07] the altar amen
[1:09:08] when we can feel like we Bend in God's
[1:09:10] presence and we know we passed from
[1:09:13] death unto life amen when we know for
[1:09:15] the right we remember what it was like
[1:09:16] when we felt Jesus wash away all of our
[1:09:19] sins
[1:09:20] how the area and then we continue to
[1:09:23] live a life free from sin hallelujah
[1:09:25] oh and not just that but then receive
[1:09:27] the power the wedding garment of the
[1:09:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost oh thank the
[1:09:33] Lord thank you Jesus sees the Kings
[1:09:37] angry he's angry he said what do you
[1:09:41] mean you're amongst these Holy Ghost
[1:09:44] field Saints and you're not born again
[1:09:48] he's in other words he's saying the only
[1:09:50] way to get in here is to get the baptism
[1:09:53] Holy Ghost but the man said he found
[1:09:54] some way to sneak in maybe kind of in a
[1:09:57] window or maybe he snuck past the guys
[1:09:59] that maybe there's such a big rush you
[1:10:02] know the rush of the last few Saints
[1:10:03] coming in I don't know around the world
[1:10:04] now around the world maybe kind of suck
[1:10:07] his way in there we don't know how he
[1:10:08] got in but the King's angry see you know
[1:10:13] he should have looked around saying man
[1:10:14] all these people are born again I need
[1:10:15] to get born again and he didn't get born
[1:10:18] again he had every chance oh my can you
[1:10:21] bring a gene that church he had every
[1:10:22] chance while sitting there talking you
[1:10:24] know they're all talking he had every
[1:10:25] chance looking man these people had the
[1:10:27] Holy Ghost and I don't he had every
[1:10:29] chance just to say you know what forgive
[1:10:31] me I'm gonna go and get the the robe on
[1:10:33] yeah I snuck in here Lord I want the
[1:10:36] robe forgive me he had every chance to
[1:10:39] Humble himself because everybody around
[1:10:41] him is all born again oh my god help us
[1:10:44] to see if other people are born again
[1:10:45] god help us to humble ourselves to say I
[1:10:48] want to be more than a church member
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] I want what he's got what she's got but
[1:10:54] you're not gonna get it from them like
[1:10:56] the other parable says about the ten
[1:10:57] virgins you got to get it from Christ
[1:10:59] amen we got to go in Jesus Christ
[1:11:02] ourselves you got to meet Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] in your in your chair or you got to meet
[1:11:06] him at the altar or you got to meet him
[1:11:07] in the basement you know by a dog kind
[1:11:10] of like brother Samuel told me where he
[1:11:11] got the Holy Ghost you got to meet him
[1:11:14] somewhere I praise God
[1:11:15] you got to meet Jesus he's the one that
[1:11:17] gives you the new garment amen he gets
[1:11:21] so mad and he sends him out to where
[1:11:23] weeping and gnashing is why was he so
[1:11:26] angry because the Bible says kings or
[1:11:29] rulers provide change of clothes as
[1:11:32] presents for their honored guests right
[1:11:35] just like remember Joseph gave his
[1:11:36] brothers to change a garment but
[1:11:38] Benjamin got five to remember that see
[1:11:41] it's it is part of the glory of the rich
[1:11:44] man to give his friends new clothes
[1:11:47] right like William gave us those new
[1:11:49] clothes that was nice of him that was a
[1:11:51] great expression of respect and love
[1:11:55] turning down a wedding garment for a
[1:11:58] king's marriage would be the highest
[1:12:00] form of disrespect
[1:12:02] especially from a man who had on some
[1:12:05] filthy garments from out in the highways
[1:12:07] this man wasn't walking on you know the
[1:12:11] pearly gates gonna say he wasn't walking
[1:12:12] the pearly gates and streets of gold
[1:12:14] this man was out in the highways and
[1:12:16] hedges he stepping on you know dung and
[1:12:18] he's all dirty out there dusty and he
[1:12:21] had every chance to get his feet wash to
[1:12:23] get washed and put on a wedding garment
[1:12:25] and it's total disrespect to try to come
[1:12:28] into a king's ceremony for a son in the
[1:12:31] can I say like this to try to come in to
[1:12:35] the marriage supper in your filthy rags
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:38] in other words there's my 45 minutes
[1:12:40] give me ha this is hard give me five
[1:12:44] minutes here my wife's gonna remind me
[1:12:46] out in the man to which I wonder too I
[1:12:48] want you to honey I don't know where
[1:12:50] everybody out myself this is AB it's a
[1:12:53] busy time of year not every time years
[1:12:54] like this but the being here is always
[1:12:55] the hardest from August to October the
[1:12:58] hardest cuz all the changes and all the
[1:12:59] great cards and everything like that
[1:13:01] just it's just more stressful C so what
[1:13:06] is he doing here he's turning down the
[1:13:12] Grace and presence of the king even
[1:13:16] Esther knew hundreds of years before
[1:13:18] even after noon
[1:13:19] you can't come before a king in your
[1:13:21] filthiness the king the King makes away
[1:13:24] for you to be clean amen
[1:13:26] even she knew that a woman knew that and
[1:13:28] here's a man who's trying to come in the
[1:13:30] presence of a holy God li king in his
[1:13:32] own righteous and Jesus said you can't
[1:13:34] come to heaven by your deeds or your
[1:13:37] righteousness it's filthy rags you got
[1:13:39] to get washed by the Sun a man you know
[1:13:42] what I mean right by Jesus ma but he
[1:13:46] used the offer of garments and being
[1:13:50] washing clean and it was available as
[1:13:53] free
[1:13:54] it was freely given anyone could have
[1:13:56] got it so it shows that this man whose
[1:14:00] dirty without the garment he didn't he
[1:14:02] did disdain that he didn't respect the
[1:14:03] king like he should have he was he liked
[1:14:06] being around the Holy Ghost filled
[1:14:07] saints he liked to see them with the
[1:14:09] Holy Ghost but he himself I don't need
[1:14:11] all that I'm good enough I go to church
[1:14:14] I pay my ties you know I don't commit
[1:14:17] adultery I don't lie don't murder but
[1:14:22] see he had II had no respect for the
[1:14:24] King he didn't have respect for the King
[1:14:25] the king was freely offering it oh man
[1:14:28] we got to have respect for Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] don't we oh it's so true see the wedding
[1:14:34] garment as children need to know that
[1:14:36] that's why I'm one of the reason I'm
[1:14:37] preaching this the wedding garter
[1:14:38] children represents the baptism of the
[1:14:40] Holy Ghost that's also seen church I
[1:14:43] forgot that that's also seen in Gideon's
[1:14:45] life
[1:14:46] Gideon before he went to battle you
[1:14:49] remember he had to kill all of his I'm
[1:14:50] sorry he had to cut down all of his
[1:14:51] dad's groves all the abominations of a
[1:14:53] dad's house and then he got a name
[1:14:55] change and he got new clothes it's three
[1:14:57] steps there was three steps I preached
[1:14:59] on that years ago it's been a long time
[1:15:00] but even he had to get new clothes right
[1:15:04] before and number the prodigal son he
[1:15:06] came back and what they did when he came
[1:15:08] back on the Pigpen they gave him a ring
[1:15:10] they gave new clothes amen represent
[1:15:13] born-again you're fully in position you
[1:15:15] got the clothes on your you're clothed
[1:15:18] with power amen
[1:15:19] I know you're cold with power close with
[1:15:20] the ring and the and the shoes and the
[1:15:22] sandals praise God
[1:15:23] oh yes see it's a gift the whole ego
[1:15:30] is a gift the garment wedding garment is
[1:15:33] a gift and as to all them
[1:15:36] as many as the Lord our God shall call
[1:15:38] see Paul not children don't miss this
[1:15:40] one children don't miss this one Haven
[1:15:43] and Karras don't miss this Paul says the
[1:15:47] batch of the Holy Ghost is close to the
[1:15:49] Bible says put ye on the Lord Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ and make not provision for the
[1:15:56] flesh see that now that's Romans 13:14
[1:15:59] I'm not gonna pull it up but Paul says
[1:16:01] put him on hey put it on Jesus Christ
[1:16:04] put him on and Jesus said go up he said
[1:16:08] until you're and dude and that word
[1:16:09] means clothes go up there to the upper
[1:16:12] room and wait till you get the clothes
[1:16:14] of power amen wait till your life is
[1:16:16] clothed with power so you can overcome
[1:16:18] the gates of Hell hallelujah amen and
[1:16:21] then Jesus says it again in Revelation
[1:16:23] three four
[1:16:24] the Sardis church Jesus says you
[1:16:30] in sardis which have not defiled their
[1:16:32] garments and they shall walk with me in
[1:16:34] white for they are worthy hey hey man
[1:16:37] see this represents the clothes
[1:16:39] represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] Moran said wedding garments represent
[1:16:43] eternal life and Paul says the bat Zilla
[1:16:49] ghost is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:16:50] because remember brother Hamm said that
[1:16:53] when the member under the fifth seal the
[1:16:55] Jews were given the the white robes
[1:16:58] right and sees mother and says what does
[1:17:00] white robe represents except eternal
[1:17:02] life because eternal life is something
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost filled Christian has
[1:17:06] right now first John 5:13 says that
[1:17:10] these things have I written unto you
[1:17:12] that believe on the name of the Son of
[1:17:13] God that you may know that you have not
[1:17:16] will have you have eternal life and that
[1:17:19] ye may believe on the name of the Son of
[1:17:22] God amen
[1:17:24] see when you have the clothes of the
[1:17:26] bachelors all ghosts you have eternal
[1:17:28] life God's life is in you you have the
[1:17:30] power to live a life pleasing to God so
[1:17:35] this is where I say this the guest
[1:17:37] without the wedding garment he responds
[1:17:41] to the preaching about the end time so
[1:17:42] see he's a message follower
[1:17:46] he's a message follower cause it's at
[1:17:48] the end time right before the marriage
[1:17:52] so he but he fails to receive the gift
[1:17:55] of the Holy Ghost himself now to me I
[1:17:57] write in the book it's like Judas
[1:18:00] Iscariot because he's cast in the
[1:18:03] darkness where there's weeping and
[1:18:04] gnashing of teeth teeth which represents
[1:18:07] cast into hell according to four
[1:18:08] scriptures and they are matthew 8:12
[1:18:11] Matthew 24:15 Matthew 2530 and Luke
[1:18:15] 13:28 all them say weeping and gnashing
[1:18:19] of teeth with the lake of fire let's
[1:18:21] read one of them since we're there
[1:18:23] Matthew twenty five thirty
[1:18:24] since we're there just so you know I
[1:18:26] looked this up church I wanted to be
[1:18:27] sure weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:18:29] always represents the lake of fire
[1:18:31] Matthew 2530 this is the parable of the
[1:18:38] white throne not parable it's a story
[1:18:39] the white throne judgment
[1:18:48] yeah okay I'm sorry this is a parable of
[1:18:51] the talents yeah
[1:18:54] and Cassie the unprofitable servant into
[1:18:56] outer darkness and there should be
[1:18:57] weeping and gnashing of teeth I'm sorry
[1:18:59] that doesn't prove it let's go to
[1:19:00] Matthew 24 since we're there 15 I'm
[1:19:04] trying to show a pattern 24:15 know I
[1:19:17] wrote the wrong one there I see 24:15
[1:19:20] that's about the abomination of
[1:19:22] desolation I'm sorry well I got a typo
[1:19:24] let me write that down I gotta fix that
[1:19:26] okay go to matthew 8:12 then let's try
[1:19:29] to try that one matthew 8:12 pardon me i
[1:19:34] need to fix that one yes here it is yes
[1:19:44] let's actually let's read
[1:19:46] - and I say to you that many shall come
[1:19:48] from the east and west and shall sit
[1:19:49] down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in
[1:19:51] the kingdom of heaven but the chair of
[1:19:53] the kingdom should be cast out into
[1:19:55] outer darkness there should be weeping
[1:19:57] and gnashing of teeth all right so we
[1:20:02] see that there the Jews here are cast
[1:20:06] out into outer darkness with weeping and
[1:20:09] gnashing of teeth because they've turned
[1:20:10] down the kingdom now to me that's got to
[1:20:12] be the lake of fire but let's read
[1:20:15] another Luke 13:28 Luke 13:28 see
[1:20:19] they're out of the kingdom Luke 13:28
[1:20:40] all right sorry about that oh yeah I'm
[1:20:44] sorry blistery 27 - yeah so he's
[1:20:46] speaking of workers of iniquity this is
[1:20:47] why I believe it's a Judas type of
[1:20:48] person but he shall say I tell you know
[1:20:51] you not for once you are depart from me
[1:20:53] all ye workers of iniquity now you know
[1:20:56] workers of iniquity do not make it to
[1:20:57] heaven those are not foolish virgins for
[1:21:00] there because foolish versions are
[1:21:01] versions to the word verse 28 there
[1:21:06] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:21:07] when ye shall see Abraham Isaac and
[1:21:10] Kingdom and and Jacob and all the
[1:21:12] prophets in the kingdom of God and you
[1:21:14] yourselves thrust out see that that's
[1:21:18] Judgment Day they're gonna see Abraham
[1:21:20] Isaac Jacob in the kingdom of God and
[1:21:22] then cast out so I'm trying to prove by
[1:21:25] the scripture I got to fix that one I
[1:21:27] don't know where the other one is off to
[1:21:28] go find it but all the weeping and
[1:21:31] gnashing of teeth all deal with the lake
[1:21:35] of fire and the white throne judgment
[1:21:37] hope you can see that by God's grace
[1:21:39] workers of iniquity okay I'm almost done
[1:21:44] here
[1:21:51] okay so these garment rejecting
[1:21:54] worshipers they see the life changing
[1:21:56] power of God on others but never
[1:21:58] experience it themselves because Isaiah
[1:22:01] 64 verse 6 says but we are all as an
[1:22:04] unclean thing and our righteousnesses
[1:22:06] are as filthy rags this man's trying to
[1:22:10] go in the rapture on his own his own
[1:22:12] righteousness but you cannot trust
[1:22:16] church we cannot trust in our own
[1:22:17] righteous let's stand to our feet
[1:22:18] because I got to stop you and I cannot
[1:22:23] trust in our own righteousness Christ is
[1:22:27] freely offering his righteousness in
[1:22:29] exchange for admission of our sins sin
[1:22:33] Corinthians 5:21 declares for he hath
[1:22:36] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[1:22:39] sin that we might be made the
[1:22:41] righteousness of God in him
[1:22:45] alright how many believe that tonight by
[1:22:47] God's grace amen praise God
[1:22:51] alright so I think I went 50 minutes I
[1:22:53] want that's the lake of fire
[1:22:55] okay maokai here once you come here
[1:22:57] let's examine our hearts and lives the
[1:23:00] Bible said examine yourselves so make
[1:23:02] sure you're in the faith tonight praise

[1:23:05] with the right garments on tonight that
