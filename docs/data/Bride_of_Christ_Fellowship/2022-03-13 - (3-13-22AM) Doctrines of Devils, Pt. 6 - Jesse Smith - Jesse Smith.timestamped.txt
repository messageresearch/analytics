[13:13] by god's grace
[13:15] so god bless you good to see you today
[13:22] a few announcements here um
[13:25] i announced it on wednesday uh we i was
[13:27] invited down to preach in columbus but
[13:28] the day didn't work out so
[13:32] originally we were going to go the first
[13:33] week of april but
[13:36] the brother rescheduled so
[13:39] we won't be going to that can you switch
[13:40] over just for a moment here
[13:48] so
[13:49] as of right now we don't have a
[13:52] a date re rescheduled yet
[13:54] so
[13:56] i don't know if it'll get rescheduled or
[13:58] not he asked me to come
[14:00] on april 17th but for this reason up
[14:03] here i can't
[14:05] we're going to do another uh postcard
[14:07] outreach
[14:09] so in 2018 we sent out uh 2500 postcards
[14:13] and we had two people visit
[14:16] so it's like you send out a thousand you
[14:18] get one person and that responds so
[14:20] that's kind of like a formula or
[14:21] something but
[14:22] that's okay we said and now we're gonna
[14:24] send out five thousand so we get five
[14:25] people come i'll say thank you jesus
[14:28] um i just feel like everyone deserves a
[14:30] chance to hear the truth about jesus
[14:32] christ and and i've i've made a i've
[14:34] made a promise to god that i would do
[14:36] that
[14:37] so it's my personal promise
[14:40] it's something that i need to
[14:43] honor
[14:44] am i on here they asked me to turn this
[14:46] up okay yeah
[14:47] um so
[14:51] um
[14:52] now we're calling them bible mystery
[14:54] expos okay what happened here okay why
[14:58] are they switching up on me like that
[15:00] exposition just means an explanation
[15:03] so
[15:05] like we did last time we kind of showed
[15:06] we did five different services on it
[15:08] well i'm only gonna do three
[15:10] um just because i want to make sure we
[15:12] teach the children as well
[15:15] um
[15:16] so
[15:17] let you know lord willing if we get
[15:19] visitors next sunday night at 3 p.m we
[15:21] won't do the kids bible study so i'm
[15:23] sorry children you just have to you have
[15:24] to sacrifice that one bible study so
[15:26] other people get to hear the message and
[15:28] then i will take a one hour sermon and
[15:30] i'll preach from just three to four and
[15:32] i'll show how the mystery of god has
[15:34] been finished
[15:36] and then we'll have a prayer and if the
[15:37] people want pizza i'll go order pizza
[15:39] whatever you know
[15:41] just just just we want people to come
[15:43] and hear the word of god
[15:45] okay so now the reason we couldn't go
[15:46] down to um
[15:48] columbus on the 17th was because
[15:51] i'd already put on 5000 postcards that
[15:54] we're going to have a 3 p.m service on
[15:56] april 7 17
[15:58] and i couldn't change it they're already
[15:59] printed already paid for
[16:01] so i just told the brother from columbus
[16:03] you know i'm sorry
[16:06] but i did tell them this i said if you
[16:07] want me to just come myself i'll preach
[16:10] i'll preach you know april 16th for them
[16:13] and the morning of april 17th and i'll
[16:15] drive back up here for the 3 p.m service
[16:19] i'm just letting you know
[16:21] okay
[16:22] but i told him i probably i'm probably
[16:24] not going to invite the whole church
[16:25] down at this time
[16:28] just because of that
[16:31] because i already put it on the postcard
[16:33] so
[16:34] i'm not going to invite everybody on
[16:36] april 17th and we're gonna i don't want
[16:37] everybody to rush down there to columbus
[16:39] and rush back up for the 3 p.m service
[16:41] i just i just felt like i feel compelled
[16:44] to the holy spirit to do these
[16:45] outreaches
[16:47] um so we're gonna do that and you know i
[16:48] got brother austin got a quote on there
[16:50] so i
[16:51] would also put a new quote i have sister
[16:53] naomi's quote from 2018 on there but
[16:54] brother austin said this church has
[16:56] opened my eyes and revealed the truth
[16:58] about the baptism of the holy ghost this
[17:00] is from brother austin
[17:02] the mysteries of god the ministry of our
[17:04] prophet william branham and has
[17:05] introduced me to the feeling of love and
[17:07] acceptance that i've never experienced
[17:09] before anywhere else
[17:12] let's give that round of applause amen
[17:14] hallelujah
[17:18] i could sum that up well and say i agree
[17:20] that's what happened to me too when i
[17:21] come in the message
[17:23] i've never felt god's love anywhere like
[17:25] i do with god's people
[17:28] and they have done uh anything i've
[17:30] needed god's people have helped me out
[17:32] now most most times god has used my own
[17:34] brothers to help me out simon and cam
[17:37] and different ones
[17:40] so anyways this is being mailed out
[17:42] starting tomorrow
[17:44] and it's mailed up in a little few miles
[17:47] north of here up on
[17:49] arlington road
[17:51] last time i mailed him to green
[17:53] well to me i'm like well they got a
[17:54] chance i'm going to go somewhere else
[17:55] i'm going to go up
[17:56] i'm going to go further north to where
[17:58] there's a little more poor population
[18:01] this is the more green is a very wealthy
[18:03] area it's a fluent area i mean look at
[18:05] their parks i mean we're at their parks
[18:07] last week they have the most beautiful
[18:08] parks around so
[18:10] just so you know that's one announcement
[18:12] and that this is why i couldn't do the
[18:14] columbus trip when he wanted me to come
[18:16] april 17th
[18:18] okay
[18:19] so any if you have any questions about
[18:21] that let me know like i said uh we're
[18:23] i'm just burdened to
[18:25] invite people to come worship who like
[18:27] to worship so i'm going to
[18:29] take it off there

[37:07] that is an absolutely beautiful song
[37:09] brother praise god hallelujah that's
[37:11] what we all need is the help of jesus
[37:12] praise god let's stand and take our
[37:14] bibles here
[37:20] today let's go to second peter chapter
[37:23] two i'd like to get back to the series
[37:26] on
[37:28] doctrines of devils
[37:30] of course we're exposing the wrong
[37:32] doctrine and we're rejoicing in the true
[37:34] doctrine
[37:36] ii peter chapter 2.
[37:38] i got a lot to preach today it might be
[37:40] a two-hour sermon so i'm just warning
[37:41] you up front by god's grace i got a lot
[37:43] to preach today a lot of quotes i want
[37:44] to show you and
[37:46] um
[37:47] but you never know we'll see how it goes
[37:48] maybe it's all up to the holy spirit
[37:51] praise god second peter 2
[37:53] 18-19
[38:08] second peter 2 18-19 we're just using
[38:11] this as a text to show how devils teach
[38:14] false doctrines and they generally make
[38:16] great promises that people never attain
[38:18] to
[38:19] but like brother austin's beautiful
[38:21] quote there what we're trying to see
[38:22] here today is the revelation of jesus
[38:25] christ and feel his love
[38:27] that is a promise that we all can
[38:29] receive today praise god we can be
[38:31] amongst believers who love us who will
[38:33] who pray for us who will help us in any
[38:35] way they can
[38:36] praise god we can see the revelation of
[38:38] the bible all those things that our
[38:40] brother wrote that's exactly what we
[38:41] offer today and that's exactly what
[38:43] we've received praise god
[38:45] thank god so we're not promising
[38:47] something that you cannot receive we're
[38:48] promising what you can receive praise
[38:50] god
[38:52] ii peter 2 18 and 19.

[39:14] flesh through much wantonness those that
[39:18] were clean escape from them who live in
[39:21] air
[39:22] while they promised them liberty they
[39:25] themselves are the servants of
[39:27] corruption

[43:08] and god's joy and god's victory we're
[43:10] constantly seeking for those things amen
[43:13] hallelujah so uh thank you again it's
[43:16] good to have our visitors here by god's
[43:17] grace
[43:18] uh so uh
[43:20] today hopefully we'll get to the eighth
[43:21] what i think is a doctrine of a devil
[43:24] now i know this is very serious if i'm a
[43:26] holy ghost person i'm calling something
[43:27] of the devil i really want to make sure
[43:29] i'm right about it
[43:31] because i would never want to blaspheme
[43:32] the holy spirit
[43:34] so before i preach these i've really
[43:37] prayed and i've studied and i've seen
[43:39] the fruits or the effects that some of
[43:40] these doctrines have upon people
[43:43] and so that's why i felt
[43:46] a burden to preach these i've never
[43:48] preached this series before it's the
[43:49] first time i've ever preached this
[43:50] series
[43:51] so i hope it's been a blessing to you
[43:53] but lord willing today we'll get to
[43:55] i still want to continue seven and go on
[43:57] into eight uh by the grace of god
[44:00] so the first three are clearly found in
[44:02] paul's writings
[44:03] uh mandatory celibacy
[44:06] was a doctrine of a devil but now it's
[44:08] we marry whoever you want that's a
[44:09] doctrine of a devil
[44:11] uh mandatory vegetarian diet
[44:13] uh but now it's eat whatever you want
[44:16] you don't have to fast that's actually a
[44:17] later one on but uh
[44:19] you know it's interesting church and i'm
[44:21] not i'm not saying this for any hard
[44:23] feelings but we i met a message believer
[44:25] two weeks ago
[44:26] and he said you are the first message
[44:28] believer who's not overweight
[44:30] and uh not taking care of your body and
[44:33] he's been in the message six years
[44:35] now i don't say that for a joke you know
[44:36] because we all battle different things
[44:38] but i just thought it was so striking
[44:43] because the bible says that the bible
[44:44] says if we're not careful our belly
[44:46] becomes our god
[44:48] especially in america all the all you
[44:50] can eat buffets
[44:52] you know this nation is overrun with
[44:54] diabetes and heart disease and all these
[44:56] diseases that could be easily avoided
[44:59] if some if we got the anointing of
[45:00] temperance it's the green one on there
[45:02] is that the green one kind of hard to
[45:04] see from here okay i kind of need a
[45:05] light shining on that one
[45:06] uh
[45:07] temperance is self-control of bodily
[45:10] passions
[45:11] so
[45:12] if if people had that anointing of the
[45:14] holy ghost then they would have more
[45:16] control over this but i just thought it
[45:17] was so interesting that that that i
[45:19] didn't even ask him to say that brother
[45:21] bang that's just something he brought up
[45:22] and he looked at my kids he said they
[45:23] all look healthy you know i said well i
[45:25] i preach that
[45:27] i preach that we have to overcome
[45:29] gluttony right and we all battle
[45:30] different things right some might battle
[45:32] gluttony some might battle lust some
[45:34] might battle fear like we preach on on
[45:35] wednesday right wednesday night
[45:39] different things we battle i name them
[45:40] all the time yours might be a a
[45:42] different battle more spiritual battle
[45:44] might be greed
[45:45] uh so
[45:47] so we i just thought that was
[45:48] interesting and so we want our in other
[45:50] words church let me say it like this
[45:51] your whole life is preaching
[45:54] you you i think i'm the only preacher
[45:56] here right so i'm the only preacher so
[45:58] but your life is preaching amen
[46:01] and it's better to live a person a
[46:02] sermon than preach them on amen
[46:05] hallelujah it's not so much what you say
[46:07] it's what you do
[46:09] amen
[46:12] and brother branham a prophet told us
[46:13] your thoughts
[46:15] are louder in heaven than your words on
[46:17] earth than your actions you know
[46:18] in other words in other words you want
[46:20] to think the right things right you you
[46:22] want uh
[46:23] uh you want your thoughts to become your
[46:25] actions praise god
[46:27] praise god
[46:29] now uh the fourth one is kind of related
[46:31] there they some some around are
[46:34] our sister churches say there's no need
[46:35] to fast but that's not true
[46:38] they say the lord returned i mean this
[46:40] is just outrageous but they believe the
[46:42] and i'm going to get in this in a moment
[46:44] church
[46:46] i just we have to understand the day
[46:47] we're living in every age had different
[46:49] battles they're going through
[46:51] and i'm just going to give some examples
[46:52] in a moment
[46:53] so don't be discouraged you know that
[46:54] there's so many false doctrines it's
[46:56] always been that way
[46:58] the way to salvation has always been a
[47:00] narrow road
[47:02] there's always been
[47:04] voices and there's always been fanatics
[47:06] every in every age there's always
[47:07] fanatics in fact that's satan's trick is
[47:09] trying to
[47:10] put fanatics around us
[47:12] and to try to distract us from the real
[47:14] thing amen but we got to stay what's we
[47:16] got to stay focused on the real thing
[47:18] amen
[47:19] the main thing amen
[47:21] and that's the holy ghost praise god
[47:23] that's living in obedience to the holy
[47:25] ghost praise god that's the main thing
[47:27] because the holy ghost will always point
[47:28] us back to the word
[47:31] the fifth one is one we see a lot too
[47:33] many not so much in message churches but
[47:35] in denominational churches once saved
[47:38] always saved everyone to go to heaven we
[47:39] know that's not true
[47:41] the bible said they would turn grace
[47:42] into lawlessness in other words oh you
[47:45] said a prayer you can live however you
[47:46] want you're still going to heaven that's
[47:48] a lie
[47:49] doctrine of a devil because
[47:53] if you don't believe that just briefly
[47:55] uh just read the book of hebrews there's
[47:56] so many if you do this if you do this if
[47:58] you believe to the end there's there's
[48:01] there's two places about how you can be
[48:03] anointed but then you can
[48:04] trample underfoot the son of god you can
[48:06] crucify the son of god afresh
[48:08] after once uh loving the son of god you
[48:10] can crucify the son of god i mean what a
[48:12] powerful book amen
[48:15] and then god always wants you healthy
[48:16] and wealthy we saw that two two sundays
[48:19] ago or if i'm not mistaken by god's
[48:21] grace maybe it was last sunday i can't
[48:22] remember things are just going so fast
[48:25] now um
[48:27] now in number seven i'm very careful to
[48:30] say
[48:31] presuming and exalting brother branham
[48:33] and his followers as the greatest people
[48:35] of all time i believe that's a doctrine
[48:37] of a devil
[48:39] i believe that's the spirit of pride
[48:42] because not even jesus would tell
[48:44] he didn't he didn't even know he didn't
[48:46] even know who would be on his right hand
[48:48] or left
[48:49] and think about this think about paul's
[48:50] list remember paul's list of sufferings
[48:52] he went through
[48:54] he went on three missionary trips and he
[48:56] didn't have a boeing 777 or 767.
[49:00] his missionary trips were real
[49:02] missionary trips
[49:03] like our boat might go down and a couple
[49:05] of times the boats did he was
[49:07] shipwrecked numerous times
[49:09] when was last time you know a missionary
[49:11] that would the plane crashed in the
[49:12] ocean they had to survive that
[49:15] plane's actually safer than a car
[49:17] right so our travel was actually safer
[49:19] much safer than they had but paul was
[49:22] whipped uh three times and each time 39
[49:25] times
[49:27] he was in constant fasting constant uh
[49:30] perils robbers
[49:31] constantly being robbed he was
[49:32] constantly being mugged how many have
[49:34] you ever been mugged i've never been
[49:35] mugged my car's been broken into and
[49:37] when i was in college they smashed the
[49:39] window and took just a handful of
[49:41] quarters
[49:42] and it cost me a hundred dollars to fix
[49:44] the card they just wanted to record they
[49:45] just could have knocked on the door i
[49:46] would have gave him a hundred dollars
[49:49] i really would have honestly i would
[49:51] have
[49:51] if just a knock on the door don't
[49:53] destroy it i should have left a note on
[49:55] there i should have left the dog but
[49:57] it's my fault it's my fault i shouldn't
[49:59] leave money exposed in the car it's my
[50:01] fault but i'm just saying the point is
[50:03] it's just sad what people would do for a
[50:04] few dollars there might have been two
[50:06] dollars in there
[50:07] uh
[50:09] and i just think it's very prideful to
[50:12] assume
[50:13] and look at paul's life
[50:15] and paul said that jesus christ told him
[50:18] if anybody adds to anything that he
[50:20] wrote they're cursed
[50:22] amen and then paul said you'll be judged
[50:24] by my gospel amen
[50:26] now to me i think paul if i had an
[50:28] opinion my opinion is paul would be the
[50:30] greatest believer of all time now that'd
[50:32] be my humble opinion but i'm not i'm not
[50:34] saying it's it's right now these people
[50:36] go around these people go around and say
[50:38] brother bam is the greatest of all time
[50:39] the greatest person of all time prophet
[50:41] of all time and then you are the
[50:43] greatest people of all time i have a
[50:44] hard time believing that
[50:47] because of the bible
[50:49] because jesus tells us we'll get to that
[50:50] in a moment here
[50:52] now today lord willing after i get
[50:53] through a little more on number seven i
[50:55] want to go to number eight
[50:56] where people have basically said if you
[50:59] want rapturing faith in other words if
[51:01] you want to go in the rapture you're
[51:03] only going to get it by listening to
[51:05] tapes
[51:06] now i believe in listening to tapes i
[51:08] was listening to birth pains yesterday
[51:09] this day this scripture was fulfilled i
[51:10] was listening to that yesterday i
[51:11] believe in listening to tapes
[51:14] but i believe it's a doctrine of a devil
[51:15] to say that rapturing faith is literally
[51:18] on a tape or literally on my phone i
[51:20] have all program sermons on my phone i
[51:22] believe it's a sin to say rapturing
[51:24] faith is on my phone
[51:26] that's a sin
[51:27] i believe that
[51:29] it's worshipping a tape as sad is it to
[51:32] say it's worshiping a tape it's
[51:34] worshiping a man
[51:36] it's just a little slight uh difference
[51:39] than saying every word on the tape is
[51:41] thus saith the lord
[51:43] okay so but we're going to we want to
[51:45] show the scriptures about that and we
[51:46] will lord willing here as we go along
[51:48] now these and church i mean
[51:51] like can you imagine being a
[51:53] jason and mario they're they're coming
[51:55] in here hearing about jesus now we're
[51:56] hearing about tapes
[51:58] right you know and
[52:00] but when you came in what was going on
[52:01] when you came in right
[52:04] no matter what day you live there's
[52:06] always obstacles to that day
[52:08] like i just put a few notes on here you
[52:10] know god knew we'd battle these kind of
[52:12] doctrines of devils at these times and
[52:14] seasons imagine walking to timothy's
[52:16] church in ephesus and timothy's reading
[52:18] paul's words right we kind of went
[52:19] through this a few weeks ago
[52:21] and timothy would read and anyone who
[52:24] says you can't marry is a doctrine of a
[52:25] devil and everybody would turn a look at
[52:27] the preachers
[52:28] who preached that a few weeks ago
[52:32] and you would say we just we just want
[52:34] to see people go to heaven we just want
[52:35] to see people exalt jesus christ but the
[52:38] doctrines they were battling was people
[52:40] saying if you want to be holy you can't
[52:41] marry if you want to be a preacher that
[52:43] was this that was the battle they were
[52:44] facing in that day
[52:48] each day had a different battle to
[52:50] overcome imagine this one came to my
[52:51] mind if you were in herod's day
[52:55] when jesus was born and
[52:57] millions and maybe thousands of babies
[52:59] were being slaughtered that's what we
[53:00] have today with a modern-day abortion
[53:02] but it was more just it was just they'd
[53:04] rush into your house and
[53:06] end the life right there
[53:08] imagine living imagine living in fear
[53:11] you got a son brother bank i've got two
[53:14] imagine living in fear that government
[53:16] might come in at any time
[53:18] and end the life of that son
[53:21] see so each day has a different battle
[53:24] now our day by prophecy was evil
[53:26] seducers will wax worse and worse
[53:29] and outside of america christianity is
[53:31] the greatest persecuted group in the
[53:33] world
[53:34] so everywhere except america but look
[53:36] what happened in canada
[53:39] certain christians will raise up they'll
[53:40] take them to jail
[53:42] shut off their bank accounts so what is
[53:44] it it's getting closer church
[53:46] we all know that but we are not called
[53:48] to live in fear praise god we're called
[53:51] to live by faith the just the the ones
[53:54] that are holy the ones that are
[53:55] righteous will live by faith amen amen
[53:58] so we see it and it's slowly going that
[54:00] way satan works slowly
[54:03] right
[54:05] he's slowly going to work but every day
[54:07] have it ever you live in as a christian
[54:09] has its different battles that you'd
[54:11] face
[54:12] remember the early church they had to
[54:13] have the line anointing because they had
[54:14] to give their lives
[54:17] uh and they had to stand against all the
[54:19] all the wickedness of that day then the
[54:20] ox anointing then many had many more had
[54:23] to give their lives
[54:25] then the man anointed they had the
[54:27] wisdom of the holy spirit to understand
[54:29] about the reformation and back to the
[54:31] word of god but we're living in the
[54:33] eagle age praise god
[54:35] we're living in an age where we must
[54:37] watch and pray we must be able to rise
[54:40] up in heavenly places praise god we must
[54:42] be able to see a far ways off amen
[54:45] hallelujah we must be able to raise up
[54:47] and see we must not be contaminated by
[54:49] earthly things amen hallelujah we must
[54:52] have a prophetic vision and any
[54:54] prophetic vision must take us back to
[54:56] the word of god
[54:59] imagine john wesley's day when you lived
[55:01] in that he got kicked out when he first
[55:03] started preaching sanctification they
[55:05] kicked him out of the anglican church
[55:07] his dad was a preacher
[55:10] his brother was charles a beautiful
[55:12] songwriter amazing songs
[55:15] wrote thousands of songs
[55:17] but because of the persecution they were
[55:19] outside most of the time in the spring
[55:21] summer fall right because it gets cold
[55:23] and gets cold in that part of the world
[55:25] like it does here
[55:28] the churches said you can't preach in
[55:29] here so he said fine we'll go out in the
[55:31] pastures
[55:33] so imagine having service height did
[55:35] they have porta potts in those days
[55:38] just but just imagine this is what you
[55:40] live in
[55:41] we're rejected by the churches so we've
[55:43] got to have church out here in a pasture
[55:45] with animals
[55:46] every now and then you know you hear a
[55:48] moo and the children
[55:50] oh that's amen that cows amen in the
[55:52] word of god there you know
[55:54] just you know that that's what they have
[55:55] to live with that was
[55:57] and then the wintertime is so cold they
[55:59] might be outside maybe the sermons were
[56:00] a little shorter
[56:03] or maybe they just had to have small
[56:04] individual meetings in their homes
[56:06] that's the battle that they to live in
[56:09] right now ours now for us we're in
[56:11] america where we have the most freedom
[56:13] any nation's ever seen in the history of
[56:15] the world because our nation was founded
[56:17] on christ now it's not anymore
[56:19] because we've left the laws that we find
[56:22] in the word of god
[56:24] so we're living in uh we're living in an
[56:26] age we're living our country is off a
[56:28] reputation of being a christian nation
[56:29] but it's not a christian nation anymore
[56:33] now imagine if you lived in 1963 you
[56:36] knew the seals were going to be open you
[56:37] knew brother branham had discernments
[56:39] imagine living in that time and a
[56:41] struggle for you as you didn't live in
[56:42] jeffersonville
[56:46] and let's say you know the rich people
[56:48] could drive around the retired people
[56:50] old people could drive around and follow
[56:52] brother branham all these meetings but
[56:53] you couldn't
[56:55] and you knew there was a prophet in the
[56:56] land and you were sick or you needed a
[56:58] personal interview
[57:01] and you just wanted to be you knew that
[57:02] was god's prophet you would you would
[57:04] live under that pressure
[57:06] praise god and there was no internet
[57:09] and you had to wait till you got a
[57:10] postcard from the branham tabernacle
[57:12] saying when brother bram's meetings were
[57:13] going to be
[57:16] well you'd be really waiting for the
[57:17] mailman outside
[57:18] what time is it you should have been
[57:19] here at one o'clock it's already three
[57:20] o'clock
[57:23] yeah you could phone him a little bit
[57:24] you know he could phone too
[57:26] but that's what you you live under that
[57:28] pressure and stress
[57:31] and then imagine living in 1976 like
[57:33] brother loris and sister karen did they
[57:35] saw this they lived through it
[57:38] where brother had made the prediction he
[57:40] was calculating dates and he thought
[57:41] maybe 70 1977 would be the end
[57:47] and uh
[57:48] imagine living through that
[57:51] all the pressure leading up to it
[57:53] and then imagine living in the aftermath
[57:55] afterwards
[57:58] i thought he was a prophet i thought and
[58:00] the whole time it was never thus saith
[58:01] the lord it was just a human prediction
[58:03] just like you'd predict oh i think we're
[58:05] going to
[58:05] do this i think we're going to do that i
[58:07] think we're going to do that i think the
[58:08] lord might come in next year
[58:10] right we've all done it
[58:13] imagine living in that day
[58:16] and so
[58:17] imagine living in the 80s when the big
[58:19] movement in the 1980s around the message
[58:21] was the seven thunders and they were
[58:22] saying they had the revelation of the
[58:24] seven thunders and they were the only
[58:26] ones that were going to the rapture
[58:28] that sat under the late joseph coleman
[58:30] imagine that and church they had they
[58:32] had a motion those brothers would sit
[58:34] and jump in the front of the church they
[58:36] would jump the whole two three hours
[58:37] they would wave handkerchiefs and jump
[58:39] for two or three hours
[58:41] and they had miracles and you think oh
[58:43] is this the am i going to miss the
[58:44] rapture imagine living under that
[58:45] pressure
[58:46] but it turned out it was just man-made
[58:48] theology
[58:50] it was just human emotion work-up
[58:52] because later in life uh at the end of
[58:54] that the pastor's life there they let
[58:56] false prophets come in they prophesied
[58:57] of his healing and his resurrection from
[58:59] his death and it all failed the churches
[59:01] all split there was adultery uh there
[59:03] was a bank fraud money laundering all
[59:05] kinds of things
[59:07] your sins will find you out amen that's
[59:09] why i say let's get all the sin under
[59:11] the blood of jesus amen amen
[59:14] and it was all based upon what it goes
[59:17] what i've heard it's all based upon
[59:19] there was a certain video they took of
[59:20] joseph coleman preaching and a light
[59:22] flickered and everybody thought that was
[59:24] the pillar of fire but then brother
[59:25] perry green yeah that's right that's you
[59:27] sent that to me perry green said i have
[59:28] that same camera
[59:30] right and i was taking a picture or
[59:31] video and that same light flickered
[59:33] so it wasn't the pillar of fire it was a
[59:35] it was a mix-up on the video on the
[59:37] video camera
[59:38] it's just a light on the video camera
[59:41] and just so you know bro that brother
[59:43] was preaching those virtues over there
[59:45] but he said if you don't he said you
[59:46] don't have virtue until somebody touches
[59:48] you and you get instantly healed like
[59:50] jesus
[59:51] well that goes against the bible the
[59:53] bible says not all have gifts of healing
[59:56] amen
[59:58] but imagine living in that day
[1:00:01] and going through that trial
[1:00:06] how about living in the 1950s when
[1:00:08] brother branham would constantly talk
[1:00:09] about we could be destroyed in one hour
[1:00:11] by a russian bomb and now here that's
[1:00:13] what we got today it's right back but it
[1:00:14] was more serious there even in the
[1:00:16] schools they had practice for atomic
[1:00:18] bombs
[1:00:19] uh and safety drills remember that
[1:00:20] they'd hide under the desk well what
[1:00:22] that ain't gonna do any good if atomic
[1:00:23] bomb hits
[1:00:24] but they were under such pressure they
[1:00:26] wanted to do something they do anything
[1:00:28] to make themselves feel prepared for an
[1:00:30] atomic bomb
[1:00:33] imagine the 90s when the two souls
[1:00:35] movement which basically said
[1:00:37] anything you did in your past life like
[1:00:39] a marriage once you come to the truth of
[1:00:41] the message once you come to that
[1:00:43] uh
[1:00:44] you could divorce that first spouse and
[1:00:46] marry anyone you want
[1:00:48] because it was a two different souls but
[1:00:50] it's not you just have a soul that was
[1:00:51] unbelief and now the soul is quickened
[1:00:53] with the seed of god
[1:00:55] let's see it's false doctrine what about
[1:00:57] the perugia the perugia actually came
[1:00:59] out of ohio
[1:01:00] leave ale's church
[1:01:03] i'm calling names because he's passed on
[1:01:05] but he basically got away from the
[1:01:07] emotion he said the lord is here we
[1:01:08] don't need emotion we don't need fasting
[1:01:10] we don't need all that and it just
[1:01:12] became intellectualism
[1:01:14] so see that that combated the seven
[1:01:15] thunders they they saw the emotion the
[1:01:18] seventh under they knew that was wrong
[1:01:19] but then this guy gets off and said you
[1:01:21] don't need any of it but we know the
[1:01:22] route is you must be right down the
[1:01:24] middle of the road amen
[1:01:26] you need warmth in your soul the love of
[1:01:28] god in your soul emotion you need the
[1:01:30] love of god and you also need the wisdom
[1:01:32] and understanding on what the word says
[1:01:34] and how to live it praise god
[1:01:36] you need both both emotions and
[1:01:38] understanding
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:42] now i i lived through this technically
[1:01:44] but it didn't impact me but in 2001
[1:01:47] joseph branham put out the here i stand
[1:01:49] and that split up a lot of churches who
[1:01:50] can make tapes now
[1:01:52] and a lot of people lost friendships and
[1:01:54] family and associations
[1:01:56] who should make tapes we got to get the
[1:01:57] message out the whole world needs who
[1:01:59] should make it
[1:02:01] now look this this family's been causing
[1:02:03] problems for a long time not unity but
[1:02:06] division
[1:02:08] maybe unity to their false doctrine
[1:02:11] imagine living through that when your
[1:02:13] own brother your own sister would say oh
[1:02:15] no no only jeffersonville can make tapes
[1:02:18] no no no anybody can make a tape brother
[1:02:19] man let people make tapes imagine living
[1:02:21] through that
[1:02:22] losing friends over that
[1:02:24] we all have lived through this
[1:02:26] 2012 most of us the believe the sign
[1:02:28] movement and the falling away continues
[1:02:30] today all these questions right all
[1:02:32] these questions about brother man all
[1:02:33] these questions and it's i believe it's
[1:02:36] foolish to avoid those questions
[1:02:38] because if people have a question that
[1:02:39] means they want an answer
[1:02:42] and if anybody should have answers it
[1:02:43] should be us amen
[1:02:46] but see most most preachers hide away
[1:02:48] from those things they just ignore those
[1:02:50] things well that's that's fine they can
[1:02:51] do whatever they want but to me it shows
[1:02:54] a fear of a fear of questions
[1:02:58] but jesus never feared no question amen
[1:03:00] hallelujah and we won't have all the
[1:03:02] answers but the holy ghost will give us
[1:03:04] humble simple answers god is always
[1:03:06] revealed in simplicity hallelujah
[1:03:08] amen that's what we're living through
[1:03:10] now all these questions about william
[1:03:12] branham and his ministry we're living
[1:03:13] through that now
[1:03:14] and now we're in the the new tape church
[1:03:16] movement we start around 2015.
[1:03:19] i forgot to put that date up there
[1:03:22] and and that even seeps over into and
[1:03:24] these two kind of seep over into
[1:03:26] churches that believe in preachers
[1:03:29] see because the tape church movement
[1:03:30] says you can't correct god's prophet
[1:03:33] well that seeps over into
[1:03:36] message churches with preachers
[1:03:38] and they'll say you can't correct god's
[1:03:40] prophet
[1:03:41] but yet they'll do it in their own
[1:03:43] sermons
[1:03:44] so it shows there's a contradiction
[1:03:46] right
[1:03:48] you cannot correct thus saith the lord
[1:03:50] you can't do that but human opinions
[1:03:52] predictions yes the holy spirit can
[1:03:54] correct those and help us understand
[1:03:56] what was the truth of it praise god was
[1:03:58] it an opinion was it a thought was it a
[1:04:00] wish was it a desire
[1:04:03] see and then and
[1:04:06] again the holy ghost is not afraid of
[1:04:08] any question my bible says the holy
[1:04:10] ghost dissolves all doubts amen
[1:04:13] hallelujah amen
[1:04:15] my bible says always be ready to have an
[1:04:17] answer for the hope that you have within
[1:04:19] you praise god
[1:04:21] amen that's why we did that doing that
[1:04:22] podcast amen
[1:04:24] hallelujah it's brother william brother
[1:04:25] william sent an email yesterday and said
[1:04:27] he really he said he said i loved every
[1:04:28] word on that podcast
[1:04:31] i said well thank you brother you're so
[1:04:32] encouraging amen
[1:04:35] now let's go look a little further at
[1:04:37] this
[1:04:38] when they presume and exalt brother
[1:04:40] branham they're basically saying they're
[1:04:42] the goat
[1:04:45] that's a that's a funny that's a famous
[1:04:46] saying now in sports like who's the goat
[1:04:48] in football
[1:04:49] who's the goat in basketball and goat we
[1:04:52] know is like and unto a sinner
[1:04:55] sheep is like an unto god saints amen
[1:04:58] but see how this desire to be the goat
[1:05:00] the desire to be the greatest of all
[1:05:01] time see how it seeps over
[1:05:04] into the message and church remember the
[1:05:07] jesus own apostles battle that spirit of
[1:05:09] goat
[1:05:10] i'm the greatest preacher no no peter i
[1:05:12] remember god did this
[1:05:15] remember god did this in galilee
[1:05:17] remember when god did that through my
[1:05:18] ministry
[1:05:20] see so preachers that argue about who's
[1:05:22] the greatest brother of them said don't
[1:05:23] you never do that he said there's no
[1:05:25] great ones among us amen
[1:05:27] well yeah fivefold preachers will do
[1:05:28] that they'll call themselves generals
[1:05:30] they'll call themselves the most
[1:05:31] anointed preachers the greatest
[1:05:32] preachers of all time
[1:05:36] and that's wrong
[1:05:38] there's none of us great but god amen
[1:05:41] amen and if you think you're great let
[1:05:42] god say it not you
[1:05:46] my bible tells me the bible says the
[1:05:48] preachers are nothing the bible says
[1:05:50] they're waterers and there's planters
[1:05:52] but that doesn't give the increase only
[1:05:54] god gives the increase
[1:05:55] hey that's what my bible says let's read
[1:05:57] it first corinthians 3. it's not my
[1:05:59] notes but i'm going to read it because
[1:06:01] it just came to me
[1:06:10] first corinthians 3.
[1:06:12] see it's pride it's the spirit of the
[1:06:13] goat that rises up
[1:06:20] okay look at now the context we actually
[1:06:22] read this uh recently
[1:06:23] but look at the context verse five first
[1:06:26] corinthians three five
[1:06:28] who then is paul and who is apollos but
[1:06:30] ministers by whom he believed even as
[1:06:32] the lord gave to what every man
[1:06:34] that's why i think everybody will be
[1:06:36] responsible
[1:06:37] every man can at some point find a
[1:06:39] preacher now it's a lot easier with the
[1:06:41] internet today right
[1:06:44] but even then
[1:06:45] now verse six paul says who am i they're
[1:06:47] arguing who's the greatest well i'm of
[1:06:48] peter i'm of paul i'm of apollos
[1:06:51] verse six i have planted an apollos
[1:06:54] watered but god gave the increase
[1:06:57] praise god just think about your garden
[1:06:59] you can plant you can water but you
[1:07:00] can't make it grow
[1:07:02] the life of the seed has to make it grow
[1:07:04] with the sun and the water and the soil
[1:07:06] it all works together we just have a
[1:07:08] very small part in it but we don't give
[1:07:10] it life god gives it life amen
[1:07:13] imagine out on your garden saying oh
[1:07:16] look i'm the greatest seed planter in
[1:07:17] the world
[1:07:19] i'm the greatest water when you get out
[1:07:20] your hose imagine unraveling your host
[1:07:23] i'm the great i'm the most powerful
[1:07:24] waterer in all the gardens
[1:07:29] i'm a general gardener
[1:07:32] but if if god don't say let the sun
[1:07:33] shine your garden will be nothing
[1:07:37] amen if god doesn't send the sun if the
[1:07:39] sun doesn't visit you you have nothing
[1:07:41] the same is true today if the sun
[1:07:43] doesn't come down and bless our works we
[1:07:45] have nothing amen
[1:07:47] you can water it all day you can plant
[1:07:48] as many as you want all day but the sun
[1:07:50] doesn't come nothing's going to happen
[1:07:52] so god gets all the glory amen
[1:07:54] amen
[1:08:01] look at verse 7. so then neither is he
[1:08:04] that planteth anything so preachers are
[1:08:06] nothing
[1:08:08] we don't get any glory preachers should
[1:08:09] not get any glory and the church said
[1:08:12] i thought i'd get a good healthy amen on
[1:08:13] that one amen
[1:08:14] neither he that watereth
[1:08:17] but god that giveth the increase so paul
[1:08:19] saw the arguments oh i go to apollo
[1:08:20] church i go to peter's church i i just
[1:08:23] follow jesus
[1:08:25] well you gotta you gotta have a pastor
[1:08:27] so that's the wrong thought too
[1:08:29] the bible says so
[1:08:31] so he says he says all this to say
[1:08:33] we are all working together we're all
[1:08:35] nothing
[1:08:36] yeah god will reward us but
[1:08:38] we don't worry about that now
[1:08:40] he says labor he said do your part but
[1:08:43] god will ultimately bless your works it
[1:08:44] is god who gives the increase it's god
[1:08:47] who gives life amen
[1:08:50] verse 8 now he that planteth and he that
[1:08:53] watereth are one and every man shall
[1:08:55] receive his own reward according to his
[1:08:57] own labor
[1:08:59] so let's look at verse 9 for we are
[1:09:01] laborers together with god see god gives
[1:09:03] you a part in this
[1:09:04] but the bible says you're nothing you
[1:09:06] have a part in it but you're nothing
[1:09:09] okay but then god's gonna even though
[1:09:10] you're nothing god's gonna still reward
[1:09:12] you for that
[1:09:14] let's not walk around saying i'm the
[1:09:15] greatest water there ever was
[1:09:18] i'm the greatest guard i'm the greatest
[1:09:20] planter of seed there ever was no the
[1:09:22] bible says you're nothing
[1:09:24] but see there's a spirit that everybody
[1:09:26] wants to be the greatest
[1:09:28] the greatest basketball the greatest
[1:09:29] football uh the greatest whatever
[1:09:32] they want to be the goat because they
[1:09:33] got the goat spirit
[1:09:36] i don't know about the preachers that's
[1:09:37] all up to them right i'm not calling
[1:09:38] anybody out by name i'm just saying
[1:09:41] that's a spirit and they've got to get
[1:09:42] away from that
[1:09:44] amen remember the bible said dare not
[1:09:46] any of you commend each other by
[1:09:47] comparing yourselves one to another
[1:09:50] don't lift up don't encourage yourself
[1:09:52] don't try to brag on yourself based upon
[1:09:55] well i know amen to this i know vang did
[1:09:57] that i know jose and did that oh i'm i
[1:10:00] must be so great i must be so much
[1:10:01] greater we must be the greatest people
[1:10:03] of all time
[1:10:05] now remember where all the blessings
[1:10:06] flow from all the blessings flow from
[1:10:08] heaven by god's grace
[1:10:10] amen
[1:10:12] now is there any proof that the
[1:10:14] laodicean saints would be admired or
[1:10:16] exalted more than the other saints the
[1:10:18] greatest group of all time i say no i
[1:10:20] don't see any bible for that go to
[1:10:22] matthew 20.
[1:10:24] in the parable of the laborers
[1:10:32] jesus gives a parable about labors in
[1:10:34] his vineyard or his kingdom
[1:10:36] now we're not going to read this whole
[1:10:37] thing for time's sake
[1:10:45] but let me just rehearse the story verse
[1:10:47] one for the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:10:49] unto man that isn't householder that
[1:10:50] which went out early in the morning to
[1:10:52] hire laborers in his vineyard into his
[1:10:53] vineyard
[1:10:55] and when he agreed with the laborers for
[1:10:57] a penny a day he sent them into the
[1:10:58] vineyard now i'm going to skip ahead in
[1:11:00] the third hour he goes back looking for
[1:11:02] more workers so there's people that went
[1:11:04] out to work the first thing in the
[1:11:05] morning the first hour of the day which
[1:11:06] would have been 6 a.m can you imagine
[1:11:08] getting up and sick brother austin again
[1:11:09] some of us can too
[1:11:11] you're out now you're out there in the
[1:11:12] field at 6 a.m you're there i'm clocking
[1:11:14] in at 6 00 a.m
[1:11:17] so at 9 00 9 00 am they go back out
[1:11:19] anyone else want to work at 12 they go
[1:11:22] out now the last one is 3 p.m because
[1:11:24] the day ends at 6 p.m when the sun goes
[1:11:26] down
[1:11:28] so imagine you've worked all those hours
[1:11:30] you've worked nine hours
[1:11:33] i'm sorry yeah you worked 11 i'm sorry
[1:11:36] yeah 11 hours
[1:11:38] and the and right at two o'clock
[1:11:41] i'm sorry no right at five o'clock the
[1:11:43] the the the worker out there you're
[1:11:45] labored all day it's 5 p.m you got there
[1:11:46] at 6 00 a.m
[1:11:48] the late the worker the boss goes out to
[1:11:50] find one more group to come in
[1:11:53] and that brother says was you and i we
[1:11:54] were the 11th hour workers
[1:11:57] the ones that were called in right
[1:11:58] before the harvest amen
[1:12:00] right before the end of the day the end
[1:12:02] of the age amen
[1:12:05] and then at the finally at the 12th hour
[1:12:07] the end of the day he calls all the
[1:12:09] workers in for their payment
[1:12:13] verse 9. and when they came that were
[1:12:15] hired about the 11th hour they received
[1:12:17] every man a penny so
[1:12:18] he gives each person a penny
[1:12:20] the 6 a.m workers the 9 a.m the 12 noon
[1:12:24] the 3 p.m and then you the 5 p.m
[1:12:28] do you get a different reward or the
[1:12:30] same reward
[1:12:32] hallelujah
[1:12:33] verse 11 and when they had received it
[1:12:35] they murmured against the good man of
[1:12:37] the house saying these last have wrought
[1:12:39] but one hour and thou has made them
[1:12:41] equal to us which have borne the burden
[1:12:43] and heat of the day
[1:12:45] but he answered
[1:12:47] one of them and said friend i do thee no
[1:12:50] wrong this thou not agree with me for a
[1:12:52] penny take that thine is and go thy way
[1:12:54] i will give unto this last even as unto
[1:12:57] thee isn't that lawful for me to do what
[1:12:59] i will with mine own
[1:13:01] is thine i evil because i am good so the
[1:13:03] last shall be first and the first shall
[1:13:05] be last for many are called but few were
[1:13:08] chosen
[1:13:09] hallelujah
[1:13:11] so this is the only one i can see where
[1:13:13] we have people that have labored longer
[1:13:15] we have people that have done more but
[1:13:17] jesus gives the same reward he gives
[1:13:19] eternal life to all those who believe
[1:13:21] that's his promise today he's promising
[1:13:23] if you'll labor for his kingdom he'll
[1:13:25] give you eternal life amen how do you
[1:13:27] want to take them up on that offer
[1:13:29] hallelujah i'll work amen i work till
[1:13:31] jesus comes amen just give me an
[1:13:33] opportunity to labor in your kingdom i
[1:13:35] want to work for the master amen i know
[1:13:37] his business is right praise god and
[1:13:39] he'll reward us equally the bible says
[1:13:41] with eternal life
[1:13:43] so this is a parable about eternal life
[1:13:45] but does jesus
[1:13:46] say anything about these 11th hours
[1:13:48] being any greater than everybody else
[1:13:51] no
[1:13:53] in fact he actually uses the word equal
[1:13:56] that sounds like we just read in first
[1:13:57] corinthians 3
[1:13:59] they that water and they that plant are
[1:14:02] nothing they're
[1:14:03] equal
[1:14:07] now of course jesus let the last go
[1:14:09] first
[1:14:10] so to me that looks like well the only
[1:14:12] thing that we get first would be the
[1:14:14] rapture like if we're changed if we're
[1:14:15] living on earth that's the only thing
[1:14:17] that we get first but actually the dead
[1:14:18] and christ rise first i'm not sure about
[1:14:20] that
[1:14:20] but we'd be the privileged ones not to
[1:14:22] live so not not not to die rather
[1:14:27] so jesus gave no more honor and no more
[1:14:30] uh i'm sorry uh no more honor to any of
[1:14:32] the laborers or the last time laborers
[1:14:34] needed the first time laborers
[1:14:36] now we know there's a 30 60 100 full
[1:14:38] reward right the reigning over 10 cities
[1:14:40] that's the highest reward i've found
[1:14:42] about reigning over cities
[1:14:44] plus you have jesus saying there's a
[1:14:45] hundredfold reward in the next life for
[1:14:48] those who are missionaries
[1:14:50] or leave their homes houses families
[1:14:52] there's a great reward for that but i
[1:14:54] can't find any proof in the bible
[1:14:56] that our age would get a greater reward
[1:14:59] we'd be the we'd be the uh
[1:15:02] the popular people in heaven that's the
[1:15:04] way it sounds like
[1:15:06] there's people that believe that they be
[1:15:09] like all the saints to come up and say
[1:15:10] you made it out of laodicea
[1:15:13] i'm gonna look at paul and say how did
[1:15:14] you make it
[1:15:16] how did you make it
[1:15:18] the bible the bible makes it sound like
[1:15:19] in
[1:15:21] corinthians he had to even wrestle lions
[1:15:23] the bible makes it sound like that i
[1:15:25] don't know for sure but remember the
[1:15:27] christians were tossed in the
[1:15:28] amphitheater they're tossed in the
[1:15:29] center many of them lost their lives to
[1:15:31] lions
[1:15:32] like the gladiators
[1:15:35] which one of us have been you know
[1:15:36] thrown to lions
[1:15:38] how did you make it out of that
[1:15:42] see when you really meditate on these
[1:15:44] things and think about the holy spirit
[1:15:46] and what god has brought us through it
[1:15:47] makes us grateful for the age we live in
[1:15:50] but it also makes us understand others
[1:15:52] have labor longer amen others have
[1:15:54] labored in hotter weather than we have
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:57] hallelujah much hotter
[1:16:00] we get the end of the day
[1:16:06] so see that's why i believe it's a
[1:16:07] doctrine of a devil to worship
[1:16:10] and exalt brother branham and his
[1:16:12] followers above every other christian
[1:16:14] that ever was i believe that's wrong
[1:16:16] i believe that's a sin because even
[1:16:18] jesus wouldn't tell us who it was
[1:16:20] now i want to add this and this is
[1:16:22] closely related there's a quote where
[1:16:23] brother adam said when you're justified
[1:16:25] by jesus christ that means declared
[1:16:27] righteous it's as if you never did it in
[1:16:30] the first place now get your bibles
[1:16:31] ready let's go to revelation 5.
[1:16:35] now i believe that
[1:16:37] because of first john 3 8. now you go to
[1:16:40] revelation 5 but first john 3 8 says you
[1:16:43] cannot sin because the seed of god is
[1:16:45] within you
[1:16:46] so there's a part of your soul that once
[1:16:48] you're baptized with the holy ghost that
[1:16:50] part of you never sinned in the first
[1:16:52] place because that's god's spirit
[1:16:54] and god gave you part of his own life
[1:16:56] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:17:02] but some people preach this and over
[1:17:04] emphasize this until they don't even
[1:17:06] appreciate the sacrifice of christ
[1:17:07] anymore they've heard it so many times
[1:17:10] you never did in the first place now
[1:17:11] church if i preach that over and over
[1:17:12] again you think well then why do i even
[1:17:14] need jesus
[1:17:16] i never did it in the first place
[1:17:18] why do i even need a savior right
[1:17:20] and it makes people from my perspective
[1:17:23] in my opinion it makes people not
[1:17:25] appreciative of the cross
[1:17:29] or makes it too loose where they don't
[1:17:30] need to repent of their sins well i
[1:17:31] never did it in the first place why
[1:17:33] should i
[1:17:34] why should i repent if i never did in
[1:17:35] the first place and the church said you
[1:17:37] see where i'm getting on this see how
[1:17:39] these quotes can be taken it's a good
[1:17:40] quote but taken out of context and take
[1:17:43] it without a real bible teaching
[1:17:46] misunderstood
[1:17:49] a lazy attitude comes oh my
[1:17:51] god
[1:17:52] not an attitude of diligence and
[1:17:54] appreciation and love for god but a lazy
[1:17:58] attitude like oh i'm good i never did it
[1:18:00] in the first place i can just i i i
[1:18:02] don't have to i don't have to press on
[1:18:04] towards the mark of the high calling i
[1:18:06] can just kick back and relax because i
[1:18:08] never did in the first place well the
[1:18:10] reality of it is your soul didn't it but
[1:18:12] your human spirit and your body did
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:18] now revelation 5 9-10
[1:18:23] some of you are reading ahead and you're
[1:18:24] getting kind of a good jump on my sermon
[1:18:26] here so you are you know my main point
[1:18:28] before i get there so
[1:18:29] just say amen when we get there okay if
[1:18:31] you already know where i'm going yeah
[1:18:32] just give me an amen when you get there
[1:18:34] revelation 5 9.
[1:18:36] now how do these saints there's 24
[1:18:38] elders in heaven how do they act when
[1:18:40] they're around jesus
[1:18:41] are they acting like hi jesus i really
[1:18:43] never did in the first place thanks for
[1:18:44] what you did but i never really did in
[1:18:46] the first place
[1:18:47] what are they what are they focusing on
[1:18:50] what is the focus of these worshipers
[1:18:51] amen
[1:18:53] this is the chapter where they said no
[1:18:54] one's worthy to loose the book no man
[1:18:57] was found in heaven amen no man was
[1:18:59] found in earth or under the earth no man
[1:19:01] was found who was worthy amen
[1:19:04] well i thought we never did in the first
[1:19:05] place well we did it in our soul but
[1:19:08] that's not the attitude we take that's
[1:19:09] not our focus is walking around saying
[1:19:11] well i'm perfect i never did it i've got
[1:19:13] a part of god in me
[1:19:15] i shouldn't be thankful i don't have to
[1:19:17] be thankful for the cross that's not the
[1:19:19] attitude of people who are in heaven
[1:19:21] right now amen who worship god and who
[1:19:24] are already saved and have new bodies
[1:19:25] their attitude is worship the worthy one
[1:19:29] because the worthy one redeemed them
[1:19:31] amen amen hallelujah
[1:19:35] glory
[1:19:38] see what satan does
[1:19:40] he'll take a quote and he'll take it so
[1:19:42] far
[1:19:43] and people will swallow it
[1:19:45] where it becomes uh that quote uh to
[1:19:48] them it becomes the idol itself
[1:19:52] i never did in the first place i don't
[1:19:53] apologize i never did in the first place
[1:19:55] i don't have to clean up my life i never
[1:19:56] did in the first place
[1:19:58] it's a lie
[1:19:59] the bible said perfect holiness in the
[1:20:01] fear of god
[1:20:02] amen be thankful that your soul never
[1:20:05] sin because it's god's spirit
[1:20:07] but you realize i'm not always obedient
[1:20:09] to god's spirit amen
[1:20:11] i don't always obey god's spirit i need
[1:20:13] help obeying god's spirit amen i don't
[1:20:16] always live the way god wants me to live
[1:20:18] so i need mercy i need forgiveness i
[1:20:20] need blood i need redemption hallelujah
[1:20:24] revelation 5 9 and they sang a new song
[1:20:26] saying thou art worthy
[1:20:29] wait did they sing we are worthy
[1:20:31] no they said thou art well you never sin
[1:20:34] in the first place aren't you worthy
[1:20:37] no you're not worthy because you have
[1:20:39] three parts to your being
[1:20:41] and two of your parts are not worthy
[1:20:44] hallelujah
[1:20:45] and the bible says you were even your
[1:20:47] soul was dead in sins amen before the
[1:20:48] holy ghost came amen
[1:20:50] even your soul was dead in sins
[1:20:53] but when the anointing came that's when
[1:20:54] the baptism holy ghost came that's when
[1:20:57] god's anointing came but before that the
[1:20:59] soul was dead in unbelief the bible said
[1:21:02] you were shaped iniquity born in sin
[1:21:04] come to the world speaking lies but then
[1:21:06] the grace of god appeared unto you amen
[1:21:08] hallelujah
[1:21:09] and he made you alive you died to sin
[1:21:12] and he made you alive in jesus christ
[1:21:13] hallelujah
[1:21:16] so how does paul and peter i'm sorry
[1:21:17] yeah how does paul peter james john how
[1:21:20] do they worship god now that they've got
[1:21:21] glorified bodies
[1:21:23] well thanks jesus what you did i never
[1:21:24] did in the first place though no the
[1:21:27] bible said they say there's one worthy
[1:21:31] it makes them so happy brother amen they
[1:21:33] sing a new song at church
[1:21:35] amen they sing a new song in heaven amen
[1:21:38] hallelujah amen when you really
[1:21:40] understand the cross of jesus christ
[1:21:42] it'll make you sing a new song amen
[1:21:45] hallelujah
[1:21:50] they sang a new song saying thou art
[1:21:52] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:21:53] seals thereof for thou was slain and
[1:21:55] hast what
[1:21:56] redeemed us
[1:21:57] see their focus church is redemption
[1:22:01] i am bought glory i am bought back to
[1:22:05] god amen i was in the pawn shop i was
[1:22:08] sold under sin but jesus paid the price
[1:22:10] and he brought me out of the pawnshop
[1:22:12] amen amen glory brother jose their song
[1:22:16] in heaven with a glorified body amen
[1:22:19] hallelujah
[1:22:21] that body glorified body never sin in
[1:22:23] the first place that theophany never
[1:22:25] sinned in the first place but somehow
[1:22:26] they can never get away from the fact
[1:22:28] that they were unworthy
[1:22:30] and they were sinful amen at one point
[1:22:32] they were sinful and they praise god and
[1:22:34] they worship the lamb and say you are
[1:22:36] worthy you've redeemed us amen
[1:22:39] and they fall down on their faces before
[1:22:41] jesus christ amen
[1:22:43] that's what we don't have today many
[1:22:45] message people falling on their faces
[1:22:47] worshiping jesus christ
[1:22:49] said they stand there and pride and i
[1:22:50] never did it in the first place i'm the
[1:22:52] greatest of all time that's a sin
[1:22:55] hallelujah
[1:22:59] hallelujah
[1:23:01] so in other words church when you get a
[1:23:02] glorified body when it's all perfect
[1:23:04] glory when you get a perfect body
[1:23:07] don't get tired anymore don't get hurt
[1:23:08] anymore when you get a perfect mind no
[1:23:10] more mind battles glory
[1:23:12] when you get a glorified body which is a
[1:23:14] perfect physical body again you will not
[1:23:16] be saying how great you are amen
[1:23:20] you will still recognize all this is
[1:23:22] possible because of one man amen no man
[1:23:25] was worthy except jesus christ
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:29] even in a perfect body you'll still
[1:23:32] remember that you were redeemed
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:36] do you see them walking around do you
[1:23:38] see the 12 here walking around saying
[1:23:41] hey
[1:23:43] hey manasseh i'm going to rule over you
[1:23:44] someday because i'm greater than you
[1:23:47] the bible said the apostles will rule
[1:23:48] over the 12 tribes of israel
[1:23:51] you see them arguing do you see any
[1:23:52] arguments now about who's the greatest
[1:23:54] no
[1:23:55] the bible said they fall down and cast
[1:23:57] their crowns at the feet of the nail
[1:23:59] scarred feet of jesus christ
[1:24:03] you've redeemed us to god by thy blood
[1:24:05] we're still thankful for the blood amen
[1:24:08] hallelujah there's only one great one
[1:24:11] that's christ amen
[1:24:12] and let me say it like that he was the
[1:24:14] goat
[1:24:16] glory
[1:24:18] those two goats on the day of atonement
[1:24:19] that was christ amen
[1:24:21] hallelujah
[1:24:23] one goat died for the sins the other
[1:24:25] goat was a scapegoat amen he is the
[1:24:28] greatest of all time our sins were laid
[1:24:30] upon him and now we'll sing in heaven
[1:24:32] blessed is that blood that has redeemed
[1:24:34] us unto god amen
[1:24:36] hallelujah
[1:24:38] he's the greatest of all time
[1:24:41] because he took our sins upon him
[1:24:44] died for them
[1:24:46] this perfect sinless sacrifice but rose
[1:24:49] for our justification amen
[1:24:52] hallelujah that didn't strike me till
[1:24:54] now
[1:24:55] he's the goat amen
[1:24:59] because he was both parts of the goat
[1:25:01] amen both rose the goat the goats
[1:25:03] fulfilled that was christ in both realms
[1:25:06] he was not a sinner but he took your sin
[1:25:09] and my sin upon him
[1:25:17] so our our focus won't be on look how
[1:25:19] sinless my soul is
[1:25:22] well thank god for that we'll thank god
[1:25:24] for a sinless soul but our songs
[1:25:27] will be about one person amen
[1:25:32] our songs will be about the redemption
[1:25:34] the bible says and church don't forget
[1:25:36] this is the seventh realm this is the
[1:25:38] seventh dimension there's no higher
[1:25:40] dimension in all the universe in this
[1:25:41] universe
[1:25:44] so in other words you're never going to
[1:25:45] go to a higher exalted state than this
[1:25:47] state right here
[1:25:49] praise god amen
[1:25:51] in other words this is the greatest
[1:25:53] worship brother bang that there ever
[1:25:54] will be singing a new song right an
[1:25:57] author of eternity singing songs to the
[1:25:59] lamb of god who takes away our sin amen
[1:26:03] hallelujah
[1:26:14] look at verse
[1:26:18] well i want to go uh
[1:26:20] i kind of preached this here but
[1:26:22] revelation 4 11 also says this thou art
[1:26:25] worthy o lord to receive glory and honor
[1:26:26] and power for thou has created all
[1:26:28] things and for thy pleasure they are and
[1:26:31] were created
[1:26:32] when preachers or anybody says we're the
[1:26:34] greatest of all time
[1:26:37] they're worshiping there it is they're
[1:26:38] worshiping the creature instead of the
[1:26:40] creator
[1:26:41] that's what the bible says in romans 1.
[1:26:43] that's what the homosexuals do
[1:26:44] they worship the creature more than the
[1:26:46] creator
[1:26:51] and that goes to show how the religious
[1:26:52] spirit is the worst one of all
[1:26:55] because they live some things right but
[1:26:57] then they get a religious spirit and
[1:26:58] they reject the word of god
[1:27:03] now go to revelation 7 you'll see a
[1:27:05] picture of yourself as well
[1:27:07] this is you now the other one was the 12
[1:27:10] i'm sorry the 24 elders
[1:27:13] now before that i'm going to read where
[1:27:14] they cast their crowns here
[1:27:17] because i actually didn't read that when
[1:27:18] i wanted to get to that revelation 5.
[1:27:24] i didn't look up that verse but i like
[1:27:25] to read that here
[1:27:27] can anybody see that one real quick
[1:27:38] all right well we've got to break out
[1:27:39] the concordance nobody sees that
[1:27:41] maybe it's in chapter four must be
[1:27:43] chapter four
[1:27:49] keep looking if you can find it that
[1:27:50] would be a good help
[1:27:54] 410
[1:27:57] thank you sister
[1:27:59] yeah there it is amen let's say praise
[1:28:00] the lord praise the lord there it is
[1:28:03] share me right in the face brother babe
[1:28:04] i miss it sit right in face
[1:28:06] 4 10. the four and 20 elders fall down
[1:28:09] before him that sat on the throne in
[1:28:11] worship and that liveth forever and ever
[1:28:12] and cast their crowns
[1:28:15] before the throne amen
[1:28:17] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[1:28:19] glory and honor and power for thou hast
[1:28:21] created all things and for thy pleasure
[1:28:23] they are and were created
[1:28:25] in other words church where did i get
[1:28:26] this crown i got it from you
[1:28:29] jesus
[1:28:30] well i can't even have this because you
[1:28:32] created me for your glory
[1:28:35] i just did what you told me to do so
[1:28:36] really jesus this is your crowd amen
[1:28:39] i'm only reigning because you you gave
[1:28:41] me grace to do it
[1:28:43] not because of how great i am but
[1:28:45] because how great you are amen
[1:28:47] because you've redeemed me
[1:28:51] see how the focus y'all the devil get
[1:28:52] the focus off the right thing
[1:28:55] he'll get it on just your soul you never
[1:28:56] did in the first place and forget about
[1:28:58] the fact that we're going to spend
[1:28:59] eternity thanking god for redeeming us
[1:29:01] redeeming our souls amen
[1:29:07] now revelation 7 14.
[1:29:12] now verses 1 through 8 is the 144 000
[1:29:15] jews that are soon to be sealed maybe in
[1:29:17] our lifetime maybe maybe not
[1:29:21] after the rapture god goes back to the
[1:29:22] jews verses 9 through
[1:29:25] 17 is i believe the gentile bride there
[1:29:27] are seven quotes that say this is the
[1:29:29] bride one quote says the foolish virgin
[1:29:31] so i go with the seven because all and
[1:29:33] all of the details in here as well so
[1:29:35] verse nine after this i be held below a
[1:29:37] great multitude which no man could
[1:29:38] number of all nations and kindreds and
[1:29:41] people and tongues stood before the
[1:29:42] throne and before the lamb clothed with
[1:29:44] white robes and palms in their hands
[1:29:48] now look at verse 14
[1:29:50] and i said unto him sir thou knowest he
[1:29:52] said who are these
[1:29:53] arrayed in white robes and he said unto
[1:29:55] me these are they which came out of
[1:29:57] great tribulation
[1:30:00] and have washed their robes and made
[1:30:03] them white in the blood of the lamb
[1:30:06] so church what is the emphasis all these
[1:30:10] multitudes are waving palm branches i
[1:30:12] imagine some of them are waving these
[1:30:13] palm branches too amen
[1:30:15] like we are this morning waving our palm
[1:30:17] branches before jesus amen
[1:30:20] and what are they thanking god for
[1:30:22] they're thanking god that jesus brought
[1:30:24] me through great tribulation the trials
[1:30:27] of my life i came through and while i
[1:30:29] was going through those trials brother
[1:30:30] bang i made mistakes but god gave me a
[1:30:33] blood to help me wash away the stains on
[1:30:35] my garments amen
[1:30:37] that's why we're singing that's why
[1:30:39] we're praising god it was his blood that
[1:30:42] washed me his blood that cleansed me his
[1:30:44] his blood that brought me through he
[1:30:46] gave me clean garments as i walked
[1:30:47] through the trials of life as i battled
[1:30:49] devils on every side as i battled
[1:30:51] persecution it was his blood there to
[1:30:53] wash me and make me worthy and so i'll
[1:30:56] sing to him all the days of eternity
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] hallelujah
[1:31:01] now well thank you lord i never did in
[1:31:03] the first place i don't need to be
[1:31:04] washed
[1:31:06] see
[1:31:07] you see that
[1:31:09] my
[1:31:11] it's the attitude church
[1:31:17] they're not bragging about how their
[1:31:18] souls never sin in the first place
[1:31:21] they're not arguing about who's greater
[1:31:24] they're worshiping the worthy one
[1:31:33] all right
[1:31:35] let me just see if i have anything else
[1:31:37] here
[1:31:40] okay yeah we can move on now i'd like to
[1:31:44] it's eleven thirty nine we started at
[1:31:45] what ten
[1:31:46] thirty
[1:31:48] four okay so i've been about an hour
[1:31:49] right now
[1:31:50] okay so i'm just saying i may be another
[1:31:52] hour i'm just saying just saying
[1:31:54] okay
[1:31:55] well by god's grace the word is
[1:31:57] beautiful buddy the word is
[1:31:59] we can't that's what satan tried to get
[1:32:00] people's eyes off the word
[1:32:02] we got to keep our eyes right on the
[1:32:04] word of god this is what we find when we
[1:32:05] read the word of god
[1:32:06] now there's a move there's been a move
[1:32:08] for a while i've heard this many times
[1:32:10] since i've been the message
[1:32:11] that rapturing faith is literally on the
[1:32:13] tapes
[1:32:15] now james 5 7
[1:32:18] let's read that about the latter reign
[1:32:22] it says be patient therefore brother and
[1:32:24] unto the coming of lord behold the
[1:32:25] husband and waited for the precious
[1:32:26] fruit of the earth and hath long wait
[1:32:28] for until we receive the early ladder
[1:32:30] rain so
[1:32:30] the bible says latter rain is like rain
[1:32:33] falling from heaven so the bible says
[1:32:35] the latter rain will come from
[1:32:38] heaven now joel 2 23-26 we've read that
[1:32:42] many times we're not going to read that
[1:32:44] but the bible says the latter rain falls
[1:32:46] like it did in the first month which
[1:32:48] means at first
[1:32:49] so the latter rain falls like it did at
[1:32:51] first on the day of pentecost
[1:32:53] and then it will provide us with wheat
[1:32:56] which is the word amen
[1:32:58] it will provide us with wine which is
[1:32:59] oil amen i'm sorry wine which is
[1:33:01] stimulation amen
[1:33:03] and it provides us with plenty of oil
[1:33:05] the bible says which is the baptism of
[1:33:07] the holy ghost and let me tell you all
[1:33:09] three are available for you today praise
[1:33:11] god
[1:33:13] come eat as much wheat as you want amen
[1:33:15] come drink the wine of the holy spirit
[1:33:17] come enjoy the oil of the baptism of the
[1:33:20] holy ghost the bible says we will have
[1:33:22] these things and we will not be ashamed
[1:33:24] of our testimonies
[1:33:26] amen
[1:33:29] hallelujah and church that one was thus
[1:33:31] saith the lord
[1:33:33] that's why i've always said church we're
[1:33:35] going to advance we're going to go
[1:33:36] through seasons and trials but we're
[1:33:37] going to advance where everybody by
[1:33:39] god's grace that's got the holy ghost in
[1:33:40] our church is going to have plenty of
[1:33:42] wheat plenty of oil and plenty of wine
[1:33:45] amen
[1:33:46] hallelujah everybody's going to be happy
[1:33:48] coming to church amen they'll not be
[1:33:50] ashamed of the gospel praise god
[1:33:53] we're advancing towards that
[1:33:56] hallelujah and zechariah 10 1
[1:34:03] this scripture says you've got to pray
[1:34:05] for it
[1:34:06] well we already got the tapes do we have
[1:34:07] to pray for more tapes no we don't need
[1:34:10] more tapes now if we get them good
[1:34:13] but the bible says you pray for the rain
[1:34:15] to fall from heaven
[1:34:17] zechariah 10 1.
[1:34:19] now what does this do again this again
[1:34:21] this false doctrine exalts the tapes
[1:34:25] and it also exalts the self-righteous
[1:34:27] ones that say well i listen to more
[1:34:28] tapes so i'm going to definitely get the
[1:34:30] rapture in faith well what is that
[1:34:32] that's works-based rapture
[1:34:35] that's a works-based rapture
[1:34:37] but the rapture is based upon those who
[1:34:39] prepared right who had the oil
[1:34:42] they followed god's directions and got
[1:34:44] the oil
[1:34:45] the baptism of the holy ghost not how
[1:34:47] much they sat down and pressed play
[1:34:51] it's for those who got down to business
[1:34:52] with god got the baptism of the holy
[1:34:54] ghost received the baptism of the holy
[1:34:56] ghost and then followed with that holy
[1:34:57] ghost the rest of their days
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:04] all right zechariah 10 1
[1:35:06] ascii of the lord reign
[1:35:09] in the time of the latter remember when
[1:35:10] i preached on wednesday night was it
[1:35:11] maybe about a year ago i just felt the
[1:35:13] inspiration the holy ghost there's going
[1:35:14] to come a time church when we see the
[1:35:16] squeeze is on and the bible says here we
[1:35:18] have to pray for the latter rain
[1:35:21] in other words we will see the
[1:35:23] conditions
[1:35:24] and lord willing we might imagine we'd
[1:35:26] have to live with we would live through
[1:35:28] that what a blessing
[1:35:30] but also we'd have to recognize all
[1:35:32] these things are happening the laws are
[1:35:33] changing they're going to close our
[1:35:35] doors it's time to pray for la we're
[1:35:37] rapturing faith amen
[1:35:39] it's time to pray for it so see church
[1:35:42] you've got something to do don't let
[1:35:43] down on your prayer life
[1:35:45] because the bible said here you ask of
[1:35:47] the lord for the latter rain when it's
[1:35:48] time for the latter rain
[1:35:51] so the lord shall make bright clouds
[1:35:54] as you pray the clouds you'll start
[1:35:56] seeing the clouds you'll see the
[1:35:57] atmosphere change amen hallelujah as we
[1:36:01] pray for the latter rain the atmospheres
[1:36:03] will change and then we'll feel the
[1:36:04] refreshment of the rain
[1:36:07] glory
[1:36:09] to everyone grass in the field
[1:36:13] oh my
[1:36:14] all of god's plants amen god will water
[1:36:17] every single one amen he's so faithful
[1:36:19] god's anointing will fall on all the
[1:36:21] predestinated bride members amen
[1:36:26] now i don't know i've heard that before
[1:36:27] i think we talked about it bang or some
[1:36:29] somebody talk about will the latter rain
[1:36:31] fall on unbelievers i don't know i i
[1:36:33] just don't know how to understand that
[1:36:34] because that would mean rapturing faith
[1:36:35] falls on other people i don't believe so
[1:36:38] right now i look at uh
[1:36:42] i just i just i just don't understand
[1:36:44] that i'll just say it like that i don't
[1:36:45] understand that i kind of look at esther
[1:36:47] as my example
[1:36:48] you know the two wines the two wine
[1:36:50] banquets the former latter reign
[1:36:52] but i personally don't see how if
[1:36:55] they're anointed with the devil i don't
[1:36:56] see how exactly the rapturing faith is
[1:36:58] going to fall on them
[1:37:01] i just don't see that okay so i could be
[1:37:02] wrong
[1:37:04] if i stand here uh just sharing with all
[1:37:06] my heart praise god okay
[1:37:08] so my answer is no i don't believe it's
[1:37:10] literally on a tape
[1:37:12] because it's a holy ghost anointing
[1:37:13] located in heaven
[1:37:15] because god's gonna pour it out from
[1:37:17] heaven
[1:37:18] so i asked you this question last week
[1:37:20] was enoch's rapturing faith on a tape
[1:37:23] remember is jesus christ different today
[1:37:25] or is he the same
[1:37:26] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:37:28] forever amen
[1:37:30] did elijah have a tape or stone had
[1:37:33] rapturing faith was literally on that
[1:37:34] stone no
[1:37:36] it was anointing the bible said enoch
[1:37:39] walked with god
[1:37:41] as he walked with god that anointing got
[1:37:43] stronger and stronger amen hallelujah
[1:37:45] and he was under the blood of bulls and
[1:37:47] goats amen
[1:37:49] he wasn't under the blood of jesus
[1:37:50] christ that means he saw that sin
[1:37:52] conscious he knew he was a sinner and
[1:37:53] all these things and he just could never
[1:37:55] really get the victory
[1:37:56] but even despite that he would still try
[1:37:58] to overcome in his mind battles and it
[1:38:00] was just predestined amen it was just
[1:38:02] predestined that one day he would just
[1:38:04] take a step higher and then keep going
[1:38:06] higher because he walked with god his
[1:38:08] name means dedicated amen so he was as
[1:38:10] dedicated as he could be and when it was
[1:38:12] time when it was the season god sent the
[1:38:14] anointing and god took elijah i'm sorry
[1:38:17] enoch that he did not see death
[1:38:20] and then god took elijah a little
[1:38:21] differently praise god
[1:38:22] sent down a chariot from heaven amen
[1:38:25] hallelujah
[1:38:30] see that means church you can be
[1:38:31] raptured without the new testament
[1:38:34] that proves it's just an anointing
[1:38:36] praise god
[1:38:38] it's just an anointing from heaven
[1:38:40] because they got raptured without the
[1:38:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:48] so what is rapturing faith it's more of
[1:38:50] the holy ghost but the man said it's a
[1:38:52] refilling of the holy ghost he said this
[1:38:54] now again we've got to take this back to
[1:38:55] the word does that sound right yeah
[1:38:57] because remember in acts chapter 4
[1:38:59] uh the the uh the the christians got in
[1:39:02] jail for one day
[1:39:03] right they let them out the next day and
[1:39:05] they went and they they went up to the
[1:39:06] upper room again or another upper room
[1:39:08] and then they lifted up their voices of
[1:39:10] god and said we're grateful to the
[1:39:12] suffer for the kingdom of god and the
[1:39:13] bible said the holy ghost shook that
[1:39:14] prayer meeting amen
[1:39:16] and the bible said they were all filled
[1:39:17] with the holy ghost amen
[1:39:20] that doesn't mean their soul gets it
[1:39:21] twice it means their mind gets a fresh
[1:39:24] filling of the holy ghost praise god
[1:39:25] like we believe christopher got
[1:39:26] hopefully he's been a new person
[1:39:28] if he got that anointing in the mind
[1:39:29] then he has a brand new mind he has a
[1:39:31] transformed mind
[1:39:32] amen
[1:39:35] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:39:36] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:39:38] have worked in a small measure while the
[1:39:40] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:39:42] the body but when that head and body so
[1:39:44] christ and the church
[1:39:46] unite together the full power of the
[1:39:47] holy ghost would raise her up just
[1:39:49] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:39:50] dead in christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:39:52] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[1:39:54] and take a flight to the skies the
[1:39:56] dynamics of the holy spirit
[1:40:00] now these are my thoughts remember the
[1:40:02] prophet and the bride must already say
[1:40:04] what's in the word
[1:40:06] okay so in other words rapturing faith
[1:40:08] is talked about on the tapes
[1:40:10] but rapturing faith is also scripturally
[1:40:12] written in the bible
[1:40:14] so we should only say what the word says
[1:40:20] it's already in the word it's based upon
[1:40:22] the scriptures joel 2 23-26
[1:40:25] it's a false teaching to emphasize the
[1:40:27] tapes more than the bible and the church
[1:40:28] said
[1:40:30] the tapes point us to the bible i love
[1:40:32] brother ramsey they point me to the
[1:40:34] bible praise god aren't you glad you got
[1:40:36] to listen to them amen
[1:40:38] they point you to the bible they make
[1:40:39] you go study the bible
[1:40:41] they prove that jesus christ is the same
[1:40:43] as he was in christ brother ramsey so he
[1:40:46] is in our days the same today
[1:40:50] they point us to the bible the absolute
[1:40:54] now we already read this one
[1:40:56] the latter reign is an answer to prayer
[1:40:57] not an answer to pressing play enough
[1:40:59] times
[1:41:00] like they say you got a
[1:41:02] it's on the tape so you just gotta tape
[1:41:03] tape play play play play play so if you
[1:41:05] press play enough you'll get in the
[1:41:06] rapture
[1:41:08] that's not true
[1:41:09] not true
[1:41:12] you can't do that you can't press play
[1:41:13] while limit while breaking what
[1:41:15] ephesians 4 says about preachers
[1:41:18] see pressing play makes that scripture
[1:41:20] preachers must be in season and out of
[1:41:22] season there it is right there amen
[1:41:25] pressing play makes you have i have an
[1:41:26] off season now i don't have to preach
[1:41:30] that take a lot of pressure off me if i
[1:41:31] didn't have to preach i could just press
[1:41:32] play all the time
[1:41:34] and we all i act like everything's okay
[1:41:37] right
[1:41:38] then i wouldn't have to be in season and
[1:41:39] out of season
[1:41:41] does everyone understand
[1:41:42] see the bible's got all the answers amen
[1:41:44] hallelujah praise god hallelujah the
[1:41:47] word of god rightly divides the word of
[1:41:48] truth amen the word of god in us rightly
[1:41:51] divide the word of truth
[1:41:53] now here's uh this was my reminder from
[1:41:54] yesterday so now the quote in question
[1:41:56] is this now you you read closely listen
[1:41:59] closely does brother ever say thus saith
[1:42:01] the lord rapturing faith is literally on
[1:42:03] the tapes
[1:42:04] just
[1:42:04] listen closely now
[1:42:08] this is at the end of a sermon i
[1:42:10] remember when christ swept down there in
[1:42:12] that big light standing yonder at the
[1:42:13] bottom of the river 1933 in june when he
[1:42:16] said as john the baptist was sent to
[1:42:17] four fourth and four on the first coming
[1:42:19] of christ i send you with a message to
[1:42:20] the world to form the second coming of
[1:42:22] christ
[1:42:23] and around the world she swept when
[1:42:25] revival fires have been built for 15
[1:42:27] years on nearly every mountain divine
[1:42:29] healing across the nations and the power
[1:42:31] and the restoration now here it is
[1:42:33] anybody hear any thus say the lord's in
[1:42:34] here
[1:42:35] and now i believe
[1:42:38] she's ready this is in 1962.
[1:42:41] before the seals before marriage and
[1:42:43] divorce
[1:42:44] three years before he died
[1:42:46] i believe she's ready to strike that
[1:42:48] final climax that's what the rapturing
[1:42:50] that's what latter rain is it's the
[1:42:51] final climax of all the churches this is
[1:42:53] the final anointing god's gonna send
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:56] to bring forth a faith that will rapture
[1:42:58] to the church and the glory but remember
[1:43:00] enoch had that same faith
[1:43:03] elijah had that same faith
[1:43:06] and she is laying in the messages he
[1:43:08] didn't even say tapes
[1:43:11] did everybody catch that
[1:43:13] we're really at the end time we've
[1:43:15] talked about in everything but the thing
[1:43:17] has moved upon us now yeah yes sir here
[1:43:19] is one that's right
[1:43:21] and that's it he just goes on to
[1:43:23] something else after that does anybody
[1:43:25] see
[1:43:26] literally rapturing faith is on the
[1:43:28] tapes in that quote i don't see it
[1:43:32] i just see him he's he's ready for the
[1:43:34] lord to come now look
[1:43:36] he's waiting for the lad to rain for the
[1:43:37] rapture but god still hasn't opened the
[1:43:38] seals amen
[1:43:40] hallelujah god still hasn't finished the
[1:43:42] mysteries of god amen
[1:43:46] because the seals haven't been opened
[1:43:50] hallelujah praise god is everybody with
[1:43:52] me he's just a man he's hoping this is
[1:43:54] the end
[1:43:55] and hope i'm looking for the uh ladder
[1:43:57] rain now to finish and go in the glory
[1:43:59] but the seals haven't been opened
[1:44:01] glory revelation 10 hasn't even been
[1:44:02] fulfilled brother revelation 10 7 had he
[1:44:06] fulfilled or revealed
[1:44:09] and he thinks this is the now time for
[1:44:10] the rapture
[1:44:17] you know trees grow quiet quietly too so
[1:44:20] it's okay if it's quiet
[1:44:23] you ever seen a tree shout or scream
[1:44:24] when it's growing
[1:44:29] i'm glad you're all thinking out there
[1:44:30] y'all
[1:44:31] contemplating the word of god yeah amen
[1:44:34] now notice this this quote was a day
[1:44:36] before he preached sirs this is the end
[1:44:38] time that's where i got the inspiration
[1:44:39] for my second book that sermon
[1:44:43] now i'm sorry to use all caps i know
[1:44:44] that's hard to read and it's like
[1:44:45] shouting at you i'm not shouting it i
[1:44:46] mean i'm shouting for jesus but i'm not
[1:44:48] shouting at you guys
[1:44:50] brotherham said the bride is laying in
[1:44:51] the messages he never said i have an
[1:44:53] extra never there thus saith the lord
[1:44:55] and brother abraham said if the lord
[1:44:56] gave him a word it would speak it it's
[1:44:58] thus saith the lord.
[1:44:59] so see preachers are making this quote
[1:45:01] sound like they're lit
[1:45:03] literally rapturing faith is listening
[1:45:05] to brother branham
[1:45:07] now you're going to get inspired it's by
[1:45:08] the holy ghost absolutely but rapturing
[1:45:10] faith comes from god
[1:45:12] it's not on a tape
[1:45:14] right the point the tapes point to now
[1:45:16] brother brown has a quote where the
[1:45:17] anointing files the tapes yes i believe
[1:45:19] that
[1:45:20] yes i believe when you listen to a tape
[1:45:22] of brother brown the anointing can come
[1:45:23] people have been healed this day today
[1:45:26] people have been healed listening
[1:45:27] brother ram on the tape
[1:45:29] but the same is true for any preacher
[1:45:30] you can be healed reading this bible too
[1:45:33] hallelujah you can get a revelation
[1:45:35] reading the bible amen
[1:45:38] see but they're making it like you have
[1:45:40] to press play enough in order to go in
[1:45:42] the rapture
[1:45:43] that self man made righteousness
[1:45:46] and the very next day brother branham he
[1:45:48] was presuming on revelation 10 7
[1:45:51] he said revelation 10 7 was how to enter
[1:45:53] into rapturing faith
[1:45:55] so did enoch and elijah's rapturing
[1:45:57] faith make them leap over walls so look
[1:45:59] at the next quote
[1:46:01] but this one didn't come from the earth
[1:46:03] he come down from heaven we talk about
[1:46:04] revelation 10 because the mystery is all
[1:46:06] finished and when the mysteries finished
[1:46:08] the angel said time shall be no more and
[1:46:10] seven thunders throwed their voices out
[1:46:12] what if now everybody say what if ready
[1:46:15] this is a what if this is not a thus
[1:46:17] saith the lord can ever understand
[1:46:20] so the day before he says rapturing
[1:46:21] faith
[1:46:23] he said we want it it's length you gotta
[1:46:25] it says lay in the messages right the
[1:46:26] next day says what if the seven thunders
[1:46:29] are something to let us know how to
[1:46:31] enter into rapturing faith
[1:46:34] is it
[1:46:35] will we run leap over walls and is there
[1:46:38] something fixing to happen that these
[1:46:40] old marred vile bodies are going to be
[1:46:42] changed can i live to see it oh lord is
[1:46:44] it so close that i'll see it is this the
[1:46:46] generation now church was it his
[1:46:47] generation to be raptured no
[1:46:50] brother ram did not go it did not get a
[1:46:52] body change to go in the rapture like
[1:46:55] the shout voice trump the trump of god
[1:46:57] it's a what if he was doing his best to
[1:47:00] prepare the people for the coming of the
[1:47:02] lord amen just like we're doing today
[1:47:04] we're doing our best to prepare you to
[1:47:06] meet christ in the air amen
[1:47:09] but only god knows the day of the hour
[1:47:12] sir is my brother what time is it where
[1:47:14] are we at
[1:47:15] i don't know i don't know sir see it's i
[1:47:17] don't know i don't know
[1:47:19] i'm only honest how many how many
[1:47:21] appreciate honest people
[1:47:23] i don't know is it time is is the
[1:47:25] mystery all finished he hasn't even
[1:47:27] preached the seven seals church
[1:47:29] this is three months before he reached
[1:47:30] the seven seals and he's asking is the
[1:47:32] mystery finished he don't even know
[1:47:36] has the sounding all over
[1:47:38] is that really them seven thunders
[1:47:40] fixing to utter out something that
[1:47:41] little group that has gathered together
[1:47:43] will receive a rapturing faith to go
[1:47:45] into the rapture when he comes
[1:47:49] this is all questions
[1:47:51] this is all this is all saying we want
[1:47:53] to be ready for the rapture
[1:47:55] for we'll all be changed as quick as the
[1:47:57] angels come in a moment a twink of an
[1:47:59] eye shall be caught together with those
[1:48:00] that sleep to meet the lord in the air
[1:48:02] my prayer is this god if this be so i
[1:48:05] don't know lord
[1:48:09] in other words are those seven
[1:48:10] thunderers going to utter out mysteries
[1:48:12] that will give us rapturing faith to go
[1:48:13] in the rapture
[1:48:16] now at the end of brother and his life
[1:48:17] in the church age book what did he say
[1:48:19] the seven thunders were he said they
[1:48:20] were the revelations contained in the
[1:48:22] seven seals
[1:48:24] that means all the revelations about the
[1:48:26] four horse riders the jews in the fifth
[1:48:28] seal the tribulation and the seven seal
[1:48:30] the coming of the lord the rapture
[1:48:33] so at the end of his ministry he allows
[1:48:35] it to go into print that we've already
[1:48:37] got these revelations amen
[1:48:41] now here's some more just see i want to
[1:48:43] i want you to see the whole
[1:48:44] these are all the rapturing faith quotes
[1:48:48] in 1953 church look at this ten years
[1:48:50] before that he says give us rapturing
[1:48:52] faith tonight how many want rapturing
[1:48:54] faith tonight
[1:48:56] well let me tell you like this if you've
[1:48:57] got the holy ghost baptism you've
[1:48:58] already got rapturing faith amen it's
[1:49:01] just going to be more of that because
[1:49:02] see if brother abraham died does he
[1:49:03] still have rapturing faith yes
[1:49:05] hallelujah when the dead in christ rise
[1:49:07] he'll come up amen
[1:49:10] everything you have needed of is already
[1:49:12] in you for your earthly journey praise
[1:49:14] god
[1:49:15] and also for the afterwards
[1:49:18] so did he have rapturing faith yes we'd
[1:49:20] say in one sense he did
[1:49:22] because if you got the holy ghost the
[1:49:23] bible says first corinthians 12
[1:49:25] hallelujah
[1:49:27] it says if the spirit of god quickened
[1:49:29] jesus
[1:49:30] and he was raised from the dead so shall
[1:49:31] the holy spirit that's within you
[1:49:33] quicken your mortal body there it is
[1:49:36] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:49:43] uh let's see a month later
[1:49:46] oh god grant today praying we can all
[1:49:48] come together and see all those nine
[1:49:49] spiritual gifts moving through the
[1:49:50] church operating the whole church body
[1:49:52] then we'll have the rapture now see this
[1:49:54] is why some preachers believe we got to
[1:49:56] have all the nine gifts operating well i
[1:49:57] don't know that's that was a prayer
[1:50:00] but it wasn't thus saith the lord
[1:50:02] that's why preachers will hammer the
[1:50:04] church come on get your gifts in order
[1:50:05] get your gifts in order
[1:50:07] well if you've done all you can do
[1:50:08] you've got them in order you're just
[1:50:10] waiting for god to use you
[1:50:12] like i said you can't take god in your
[1:50:13] pocket and say well here's my here's my
[1:50:14] healing gift here but hang here you're
[1:50:16] sick i'll heal you because i have
[1:50:18] control i have full control over these
[1:50:19] gifts no you don't have full control
[1:50:21] you have partial control over your gifts
[1:50:24] see but see brother sia see brian how
[1:50:26] people can major on one quote
[1:50:28] but you got to take it back to the word
[1:50:31] does anybody see that
[1:50:32] i believe these quotes i mean i i can
[1:50:33] agree with them but
[1:50:35] it depends how far you take it
[1:50:40] the way it looks like to me is that all
[1:50:42] the gifts are just in the body somewhere
[1:50:43] because remember jesus said in john 14
[1:50:45] 12 he said greater works than thee shall
[1:50:47] you do because i go to my father the
[1:50:49] works that i do shall you do also he's
[1:50:51] talking about the whole church
[1:50:57] you can't you and i cannot add one cubit
[1:50:59] to our stature so all we have to do in
[1:51:01] other words to operate gifts is just lay
[1:51:03] before god just pray before him all the
[1:51:05] time serve god confess your sins and
[1:51:06] when god wants to use you church he's
[1:51:08] going to come find you amen
[1:51:11] you are a tool in god's toolbox can i
[1:51:13] say it like that
[1:51:14] would i need a tool do i got one down
[1:51:16] here
[1:51:17] no i don't well i mean i got an adapter
[1:51:19] that's a tool when i need that tool i
[1:51:21] just pick it up plug it in boom it works
[1:51:23] that's what god does with your life when
[1:51:25] god wants to use you to answer
[1:51:26] somebody's prayer god will use you
[1:51:28] praise god
[1:51:30] and here's your proof church here's your
[1:51:32] proof
[1:51:33] when god wants to use you he's going to
[1:51:35] use you praise god
[1:51:37] right brother bang
[1:51:40] now you might have had a revelation that
[1:51:41] that was going to finish it i don't know
[1:51:42] but did you have a revelation that was
[1:51:43] going to finish it do you know
[1:51:45] he didn't know neither did i
[1:51:47] i didn't know god was going to use you
[1:51:48] like that
[1:51:50] but i was what were you just waiting for
[1:51:52] god to use you
[1:51:53] amen just waiting there humbly say god
[1:51:56] use me god i'm making i'm crying out to
[1:51:58] jesus help me jesus amen
[1:52:00] hallelujah
[1:52:07] see i believe it's the spirit of the
[1:52:09] enemy that would want to just take one
[1:52:10] quote and twist it to try to deceive
[1:52:12] god's people or give them complexes
[1:52:14] right
[1:52:15] see remember holy ghost field people can
[1:52:17] have complexes and that would be the
[1:52:18] enemy brother man said it haunts him
[1:52:20] when he when he had a complex it haunts
[1:52:22] him
[1:52:24] holy ghost-filled people can have
[1:52:25] complexes
[1:52:27] haunting them they can have spirits they
[1:52:28] allow in their minds and if they don't
[1:52:30] drive them out it will haunt them
[1:52:32] that's why we can call the doctor of a
[1:52:34] devil because if it creates a complex
[1:52:36] that worships brother branham or causes
[1:52:38] pride in your life it is of the devil
[1:52:46] i love everybody here by god's grace
[1:52:49] thank you for suffering with me
[1:52:52] i never wanted to be a long-winded
[1:52:53] preacher but there's some things i just
[1:52:54] want to lay in there so
[1:52:56] just like brother said when you put a
[1:52:57] hammer and you just don't just you know
[1:52:58] tap it in and then you walk away no you
[1:53:01] really want that drywall to hang up you
[1:53:03] bang it in there amen
[1:53:05] you just put it all the way in there
[1:53:07] i believe one day we'll all be grateful
[1:53:08] that we sat this long and hear the word
[1:53:10] of god
[1:53:11] i've never been
[1:53:13] i've never been sad i did i'll say it
[1:53:14] like that
[1:53:18] here he says oil on your lamp is
[1:53:20] rapturing faith now that's real good
[1:53:23] like brother brandon if he died and had
[1:53:24] the baptism the holy ghost when that
[1:53:26] when the dead in christ rise he'll come
[1:53:28] up because he had rapturing faith in him
[1:53:32] there's your five wise virgins who had
[1:53:34] oil in their lamps rapturing faith glory
[1:53:37] believing i don't believe all the signs
[1:53:39] i'm going to believe all the wonders all
[1:53:40] the prophecies how many believe
[1:53:41] everything god does
[1:53:43] i thank god for all he does and all the
[1:53:45] churches the message churches and even
[1:53:46] denominational he'll answer some of
[1:53:48] those prayers i thank god for all that
[1:53:51] but rapturing faith will come through
[1:53:53] being baptized with the holy ghost
[1:53:55] now here brother says the pouring out of
[1:53:57] god's spirit will bring rapturing faith
[1:53:58] to the people there it is pouring out he
[1:54:00] didn't say it's on the tape
[1:54:02] if you take it back to the bible it
[1:54:04] comes from heaven
[1:54:05] it doesn't come from just a tape right
[1:54:10] maybe this is why preachers exalt the
[1:54:12] tapes
[1:54:13] because they misunderstand rapturing
[1:54:15] faith being on the tapes they think the
[1:54:17] tape has a holy ghost
[1:54:20] right but the holy ghost has to come
[1:54:21] from heaven
[1:54:24] okay now here's it's a long sentence but
[1:54:26] i believe the age has come now they're
[1:54:28] miraculous the phenomena this is the
[1:54:29] 1953 church this is 10 years before the
[1:54:31] seals
[1:54:33] i believe the rapture in faith the
[1:54:34] baptist holy spirit this great pouring
[1:54:36] out of god's spirit in the last days
[1:54:37] that's the thing that will bring faith
[1:54:38] into the people that'll take a rapturing
[1:54:40] faith that'll take the church into glory
[1:54:42] i believe i believe that
[1:54:43] i believe that
[1:54:45] it's got to come from heaven god's got
[1:54:47] to send faith to rapture us from heaven
[1:54:52] now next year
[1:54:54] but just the same god's moving on
[1:54:56] bringing the bringing in the rapturing
[1:54:58] faith for his church
[1:54:59] i could say amen to that
[1:55:01] if saints are going to die before the
[1:55:02] rapture they got to get the baptism the
[1:55:04] holy ghost that will be the rapturing
[1:55:06] faith they need for the dead in christ
[1:55:07] to rise first
[1:55:10] in 1954 they had to have rapturing faith
[1:55:13] now look he says right away we got to
[1:55:14] have it right away
[1:55:16] well we know that wasn't for the
[1:55:18] the body change rapture for the those
[1:55:20] that are alive in christ that had to be
[1:55:22] for those who needed the baptism of the
[1:55:23] holy ghost
[1:55:27] 12 years before he passed i'm sorry 11
[1:55:28] years before he passed away
[1:55:30] no i'm sorry that was nine years sorry
[1:55:31] nine years
[1:55:33] i forgot to switch the dates there
[1:55:36] satan you have held them captive so long
[1:55:38] but you've exposed tonight jesus is
[1:55:40] coming soon for his church and he's
[1:55:41] trying to give them rapturing faith
[1:55:45] 1958
[1:55:48] the power of the rapture and faith will
[1:55:49] be there at the time of the rapture i
[1:55:50] love this one the power of the church
[1:55:52] see this is what we're praying for
[1:55:53] church right here
[1:55:57] he says we've got to have rapturing
[1:55:58] faith in a church that can be changed in
[1:56:00] a moment between give an eye now
[1:56:01] remember don't don't don't get scared
[1:56:02] enoch had it
[1:56:04] in other words god will bring you to it
[1:56:07] elijah had it
[1:56:08] and he thought he was only one left but
[1:56:10] he wasn't
[1:56:12] there were seven thousand that didn't
[1:56:13] bother me
[1:56:15] you've got but don't worry see
[1:56:17] that's all i said but don't worry ready
[1:56:19] but don't worry don't worry
[1:56:21] it'll be there
[1:56:23] it's something that's there for you it's
[1:56:24] a gift to you because you have the
[1:56:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56:28] it'll be there and when the power of
[1:56:30] this church rises now i don't know if
[1:56:32] he's talking about the dead in christ
[1:56:33] like the church age
[1:56:35] or he's talking about like a church in
[1:56:36] africa like a ghana church or a church
[1:56:38] in america i don't know
[1:56:40] he doesn't tell us
[1:56:42] when the power of this church rises
[1:56:44] it'll bring its brethren the power of
[1:56:45] that church will bring the other and
[1:56:46] then there'll be a general resurrection
[1:56:48] we're looking forward to it
[1:56:50] that's why some people think it'll start
[1:56:52] at maybe brother cam's church come to
[1:56:53] our church or brother brooks church come
[1:56:54] to our church see they got different
[1:56:56] ideas but you don't really say
[1:56:59] so what's the thing to do love god with
[1:57:01] all your heart
[1:57:02] be ready
[1:57:05] rapturing faith was a move of the spirit
[1:57:07] not just listening to tapes 1963
[1:57:10] he says how can we sit here lord this
[1:57:12] ought to bring a rapturing faith the
[1:57:13] power of god that would sweep this whole
[1:57:15] audience and lord into higher heights
[1:57:16] and the glory of god we ought to have it
[1:57:18] in 1963.
[1:57:21] the first seal
[1:57:22] now he again links that's why some
[1:57:24] churches believe the thunders are
[1:57:26] necessary for the the latter rain that's
[1:57:27] why this is why
[1:57:29] i believe
[1:57:30] i mean it could be that but if i got the
[1:57:32] whole that's all that matters glory if i
[1:57:34] just got the holy ghost it don't matter
[1:57:36] if i got the oil i'm going out to meet
[1:57:39] the bridegroom amen hallelujah that's
[1:57:41] all that's required i need the oil i
[1:57:43] need the holy ghost in my soul and if
[1:57:45] i've got extra oil i'm going out i'm not
[1:57:47] running to try to find it i got it now
[1:57:49] praise god
[1:57:50] see what the devil does he tries to
[1:57:52] bring some quotes and tries to bring a
[1:57:54] misunderstanding of the quotes to get
[1:57:56] people off the real thing the real thing
[1:57:58] is like jesus said you must be born
[1:58:00] again hallelujah amen and how do you get
[1:58:02] born again repent of your sins be
[1:58:04] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:58:06] christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:58:08] the holy ghost
[1:58:09] hallelujah
[1:58:11] somebody asked me at work or one of the
[1:58:13] parents of the students at work asked me
[1:58:14] what's your favorite verse and at first
[1:58:16] i said john 14 6 jesus saith in them i
[1:58:19] am the way the truth and life but then i
[1:58:20] thought i changed i said acts 2 38 give
[1:58:22] me acts 2 38.
[1:58:24] that's the greatest verse to me not to
[1:58:26] me that's my favorite verse to me no you
[1:58:28] know why church not because it's maybe
[1:58:29] the most beautiful
[1:58:30] brother man said it's the creed of the
[1:58:32] church he said it was the creed of the
[1:58:33] apostles if they had a creed
[1:58:35] but you know why because that's the
[1:58:36] first scripture i memorized brother vang
[1:58:37] when i came in the message
[1:58:39] and i quoted that thing over i bought
[1:58:40] one of those tape recorders
[1:58:42] with tape on it and i would just drive
[1:58:44] to class and i would i would just say
[1:58:45] that over and over again listen until i
[1:58:47] memorize that verse
[1:58:48] and i've seen that verse change my life
[1:58:51] i have seen glory i've seen that that
[1:58:53] verse was made a promise to me brother
[1:58:54] rang by brother brooks and brother craig
[1:58:56] and that promise came to pass hallelujah
[1:58:59] amen they weren't promising me something
[1:59:01] way out there i could never attain but
[1:59:03] no this is a promise i could grab a hold
[1:59:04] of this is a promise that grabbed a hold
[1:59:06] of me praise god amen
[1:59:08] hallelujah amen
[1:59:11] thank god
[1:59:12] just hang on that promise brother austin
[1:59:14] hang on that promise
[1:59:15] acts 2 38
[1:59:17] hallelujah
[1:59:18] after all these years in the message
[1:59:20] what's my favorite verse the same one at
[1:59:21] the beginning
[1:59:22] hallelujah
[1:59:24] now you could you could debate we could
[1:59:26] have a good debate about which one
[1:59:27] brother jesse you should have said this
[1:59:28] but you know that's just what i said so
[1:59:30] we could debate that later
[1:59:33] see then there's he says this is future
[1:59:35] he says there's coming forth seven
[1:59:36] mysterious thunders that's not even
[1:59:37] written at all that's right and i
[1:59:39] believe that through those seven
[1:59:40] thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:59:42] days in order to get the bride together
[1:59:44] for rapturing faith that's why that
[1:59:46] movement in the 70s with the the seven
[1:59:48] thunders was so attractive to people
[1:59:50] they took this quote and they thought oh
[1:59:52] well it's got to be another preacher
[1:59:53] rise up and he's got to preach to seven
[1:59:54] thunders
[1:59:55] and he's got to have vindication and
[1:59:57] then he's got this light that's a it's a
[1:59:59] camera mistake
[2:00:02] is everybody with me
[2:00:04] see how the devil can take a few quotes
[2:00:05] i fear christians do not operate by fear
[2:00:08] they operate by faith hallelujah
[2:00:11] and the devil's using these cell phones
[2:00:13] as i said on wednesday night to bring in
[2:00:14] all these new disorders
[2:00:18] in other words spirits of fear that get
[2:00:20] on people if you want to do something
[2:00:22] pray first i love that quote brother i
[2:00:24] said before you do anything pray every
[2:00:25] day ask father say father shall i do
[2:00:28] this
[2:00:29] amen
[2:00:31] pray about it first
[2:00:33] take these desires and these concerns
[2:00:35] and these pressures and these fears take
[2:00:37] them before god say god what do you say
[2:00:39] about it amen
[2:00:40] and then just wait a few days
[2:00:42] before you act on it and the church said
[2:00:48] and then in 2005 wormwood was supposed
[2:00:50] to become a star and the angel was
[2:00:51] supposed to be behind that and destroy
[2:00:53] us all uh
[2:00:54] that didn't happen
[2:00:56] that got preached from message pulpits i
[2:00:57] had i printed it out off the internet
[2:00:59] because i thought it was so real
[2:01:00] i did that at the university of akron i
[2:01:02] remember printing that out
[2:01:04] in 2008 the market crashed everyone
[2:01:06] thought now oh obama's going to come in
[2:01:08] i anti-christ
[2:01:10] we lived through that
[2:01:12] 2015 the blood moons the pope came
[2:01:15] it was it was crazy here
[2:01:17] we lived through that
[2:01:18] 2020 the preacher from kentucky had the
[2:01:20] dream after the uh the united nations
[2:01:23] and russians were going to invade right
[2:01:24] after the election
[2:01:26] remember i showed you that
[2:01:29] all these things shake us up because
[2:01:30] we're human but each time we got to pray
[2:01:33] about each and every one praise god and
[2:01:36] remember the one thing that i need to
[2:01:37] focus on is to have oil praise god
[2:01:40] if i have oil i'm going out to meet him
[2:01:43] amen hallelujah
[2:01:45] if i've got oil i'll go out praise god
[2:01:47] if i don't i'll be looking for it but
[2:01:49] the thing to do is prepare bring it have
[2:01:52] the oil know that god is coming know
[2:01:54] that the bridegroom's coming and when
[2:01:56] you hear the shout go yet to meet him
[2:01:58] then you'll go out praise god
[2:02:01] god in simplicity
[2:02:06] this is after the seals the first one
[2:02:08] after the seals no yeah yeah the first
[2:02:10] one after jesus
[2:02:12] we got a bible here that speaks of this
[2:02:13] the rapture
[2:02:16] and here he is to identify his church to
[2:02:18] give it rapturing faith to take it away
[2:02:20] how could a person sit still see don't
[2:02:22] sit still receive the baptism of the
[2:02:23] holy ghost
[2:02:25] miracles
[2:02:27] brother man said miracles oh that's a
[2:02:28] typo miracles miracles ought to give us
[2:02:30] rapturing faith he says he said we're
[2:02:33] looking for a rapturing faith that can
[2:02:34] pull the church together and give it
[2:02:35] some supernatural strength that can
[2:02:37] change these bodies when we see a god
[2:02:39] that can raise the dead off the floor or
[2:02:40] out of the yard and bring him back to
[2:02:42] life again and present him before us
[2:02:43] when we see a god who can take a cancer
[2:02:45] let's eat a man to a shadow and raise
[2:02:46] him up to shrug the healthy strong man
[2:02:48] that ought to give us rapturing faith to
[2:02:50] the people
[2:02:52] okay praise god i agree
[2:02:54] if you're born again and you've got the
[2:02:56] holy ghost that i'll give you rapturing
[2:02:57] faith because you already got it inside
[2:02:59] of you
[2:03:03] here he prayed for a great move of the
[2:03:05] spirit that the church might receive
[2:03:06] rapturing rapturing faith
[2:03:10] now this is at the end of the sermon
[2:03:12] i was on my birthday yeah
[2:03:14] 17 years before i was born that's why 17
[2:03:16] is kind of mixed with my life i was born
[2:03:17] on the 17th this sermon was seven
[2:03:19] appreciate my birthday 17 years i don't
[2:03:21] know i just look for little just little
[2:03:22] things like that to encourage you
[2:03:24] uh lord years i've wanted to see this
[2:03:26] happen maybe it will make see look maybe
[2:03:27] maybe
[2:03:29] maybe
[2:03:30] just once more lord one great move of
[2:03:32] the spirit one more time lord and the
[2:03:33] church might receive rapturing faith to
[2:03:35] go in so he's he's praying maybe this is
[2:03:37] the rapture
[2:03:38] that's okay we should pray the same
[2:03:40] thing maybe this is the rapture amen so
[2:03:42] let's get ready praise god
[2:03:44] let's pray let's eat god let's give god
[2:03:46] all we have amen
[2:03:49] now brother brahm believed rapturing
[2:03:51] faith
[2:03:52] yet he took time to teach sunday schools
[2:03:55] to adult congregations
[2:04:00] think about that
[2:04:02] that and if you listen to some of these
[2:04:04] sermons when he says i'm a teacher
[2:04:05] sunday school he hardly ever raises his
[2:04:07] voice
[2:04:08] he's just teaching the word of god
[2:04:10] and yet he believed rapturing faith he
[2:04:12] said i would not try to he said i just
[2:04:14] try to make this a sunday school lesson
[2:04:16] so that would clearly understand so he
[2:04:17] tried to go slow
[2:04:19] like i'm going real slow today real long
[2:04:21] today
[2:04:23] and i'm looking for a time a break forth
[2:04:25] of the spirit of god these last days
[2:04:27] we're not living in for another surge of
[2:04:29] the holy spirit into the church for
[2:04:30] rapturing faith just before it comes
[2:04:33] in other words i'm gonna i'm gonna just
[2:04:35] i know rapturing faith is coming but i'm
[2:04:36] gonna sit down and go real slow and
[2:04:37] teach the people the word of god
[2:04:43] next quote
[2:04:44] brother branham believed the third poll
[2:04:46] would start the rapturing faith but said
[2:04:47] the lord did not tell him this so see
[2:04:49] that's why but austin we get this a lot
[2:04:50] around our ranks
[2:04:53] the brother graham said the lord never
[2:04:55] told me that the third paul was going to
[2:04:57] cause now the third poll is just the
[2:04:58] opening of the word it's the it's the
[2:05:00] word and demonstration it's speaking
[2:05:01] things right speaking healing speaking
[2:05:03] whatever speaking squirrels whatever
[2:05:04] they need them that's the third poll
[2:05:05] it's the power of the revealed word
[2:05:08] okay that's what it is brother man
[2:05:09] identifies it in this sermon
[2:05:11] he said i can't say much about it he
[2:05:12] says because i don't want him to say
[2:05:13] much about it the angel told him not to
[2:05:17] he says this is my opinion everybody say
[2:05:18] opinion ready
[2:05:20] i don't say the lord tells me this but
[2:05:22] the third poll will be the thing that
[2:05:23] starts the rapturing faith for the going
[2:05:25] away
[2:05:26] i must lay quiet for just a little while
[2:05:28] now remember you listen to this tape you
[2:05:29] might see such a change in my ministry
[2:05:31] right now dropping back not going up
[2:05:33] dropping back
[2:05:35] he says it can't go any further we have
[2:05:36] to wait just a minute until this happens
[2:05:38] over here to catch up when the time
[2:05:39] comes but it's thoroughly vindicated
[2:05:41] it's tightening and when that time comes
[2:05:44] and the press comes to a place that
[2:05:45] you're pressed out then watch so press
[2:05:47] out of what having church
[2:05:49] watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a
[2:05:50] few minutes watch the third poll then
[2:05:52] see it'll be absolutely to the total
[2:05:54] loss but it will be for the bride and
[2:05:56] the church
[2:05:58] so when the the government starts
[2:06:00] tightening down on christians he says
[2:06:02] watch the third pole then but he says
[2:06:03] the lord don't tell me that he said
[2:06:05] that's what i think it is
[2:06:07] but see a lot of people are awesome make
[2:06:09] that thus say the lord but he says the
[2:06:10] lord didn't tell him that
[2:06:14] we're closer than it seems to be i don't
[2:06:16] know when it's real close i may be
[2:06:18] building a platform for somebody else to
[2:06:19] step on i may be taken before that time
[2:06:21] i don't know and that time maybe this
[2:06:23] week that the spirit will come it might
[2:06:24] bring jesus christ he might come next
[2:06:26] week he might come yet tonight i don't
[2:06:27] know when he come he doesn't tell us
[2:06:29] that now look but i believe we're so
[2:06:31] close i would never die with old age
[2:06:35] right
[2:06:36] so right now brother man was born in
[2:06:38] 1909 so
[2:06:39] 2009 would have been 100 years
[2:06:44] okay so 101 110 113. 112.
[2:06:49] no i'm sorry 113. sorry
[2:06:51] he'd be 113 years old today but he says
[2:06:53] i think the coming is so close i would
[2:06:55] never die of old age before the lord
[2:06:57] came but most people die before they get
[2:06:59] to 113 right
[2:07:03] he said i just believe that
[2:07:06] and i say i want to say this i've never
[2:07:08] said it before but according to
[2:07:09] scripture according to what he said 30
[2:07:10] years ago
[2:07:13] he says everything has happened just
[2:07:14] exactly now look i may not do it now
[2:07:16] church this i'll encourage you but this
[2:07:18] message will introduce jesus christ to
[2:07:20] the world why are we sending out these
[2:07:21] videos why are we sending out the
[2:07:22] podcasts all the youtube videos why are
[2:07:24] we sending out these postcards so that
[2:07:26] this world
[2:07:27] can be introduced to jesus christ amen
[2:07:30] and how will they do it by meeting
[2:07:31] brother vain
[2:07:34] he's a representative of jesus christ
[2:07:36] by meeting brother amen
[2:07:38] sister who i can walk and i'm not gonna
[2:07:39] do it i can walk around and shake all
[2:07:41] your hands right
[2:07:42] because jesus said when you did it to
[2:07:44] the least of these my brethren the least
[2:07:45] amen the glory the least of these my
[2:07:47] brethren you've done it unto me
[2:07:49] hallelujah
[2:07:51] this message this revelation we have
[2:07:53] will introduce jesus christ to the world
[2:07:56] that's what i met when i met dave lewell
[2:07:58] and i met jesus christ
[2:08:00] the holy spirit anointing dave well i
[2:08:01] said this guy is either the biggest
[2:08:03] fraud or he's got really christian love
[2:08:06] turned out he had really christian love
[2:08:08] i'm glad he did because i got the same
[2:08:09] thing later
[2:08:10] hallelujah amen
[2:08:14] he said the holy ghost look the holy
[2:08:15] ghost gives us rapturing faith
[2:08:18] i'm trying to go fast now
[2:08:20] now i think the church has got to come
[2:08:21] to that to a rapturing faith i may not
[2:08:23] have the faith just now but i sure won't
[2:08:24] stand in the way of somebody that did
[2:08:26] have the faith
[2:08:27] and church that that's how when you have
[2:08:29] the really holy spirit when you really
[2:08:30] have the holy spirit that's how you feel
[2:08:31] i'm not going to get in anybody's way i
[2:08:33] have no i have no vendettas against any
[2:08:35] preachers i'm not going to stand in
[2:08:36] anybody's way but i'm seeking rapturing
[2:08:38] faith
[2:08:39] and i will not send in anyone's way
[2:08:41] who's going to get it
[2:08:42] because i want all god's people to go in
[2:08:44] the rapture
[2:08:45] and i know all the predestinated ones
[2:08:47] will
[2:08:48] okay you've been gracious with me thank
[2:08:50] you
[2:09:37] thanks for your patience there we go
[2:09:38] thank you sir appreciate that good good
[2:09:39] ears i didn't hear that good
[2:09:40] too much screaming shouting going on for
[2:09:42] me that's why i surprised
[2:09:43] but see i i just have a question about
[2:09:45] that because what about enoch
[2:09:47] you know what about enoch what about
[2:09:49] elijah
[2:09:51] do we need more rapturing faith than
[2:09:52] they had or is it the same rapturing
[2:09:54] faith now personally i would just think
[2:09:55] it's the same
[2:09:57] i just feel like it just takes the time
[2:09:59] and season of the rapture
[2:10:01] right it just takes the timing of it
[2:10:04] those who are privileged and called to
[2:10:06] it will receive it
[2:10:11] okay for time's sake
[2:10:14] let me read this one okay this is i'm
[2:10:16] gonna close with this i'll do one more
[2:10:17] scripture okay so quote scripture i'm
[2:10:18] done everybody take a deep breath free
[2:10:21] almost done
[2:10:22] i want to read this last week when all
[2:10:24] those rumors about russia you know and
[2:10:25] ukraine and the nuclear wars and
[2:10:27] everything brother branham said we feel
[2:10:29] like we're going through a great time of
[2:10:30] distress and trials how many can say

[2:10:33] perplexity of the time and distress
[2:10:35] between the nations
[2:10:36] but look brother said picture yourself

[2:10:47] fear and all the perplexity of nations
[2:10:49] you get engulfed in it

[2:10:56] right and we see these big waves of
[2:10:58] russia big waves of ukraine big waves of
[2:11:00] north korea uh

[2:11:20] charge of the boat
[2:11:21] how are we gonna make it when there's
[2:11:23] all these waves on the boat

[2:11:47] is my one gun more powerful than nuke
[2:11:49] all of russia's nuclear wars
[2:11:52] so it's like a wave i'm in this boat and
[2:11:54] there's a wave a hundred times taller
[2:11:55] than me how am i gonna make it
[2:11:58] the thing is don't trust in your guns

[2:12:04] lord of hosts amen hallelujah

[2:12:18] says we will crest every one of them
[2:12:21] we are more than conquerors or victors
[2:12:24] through christ
[2:12:25] the great captain jesus christ he has a
[2:12:28] hold of a string on the end of our ship
[2:12:31] and he's pulling us through the waves
[2:12:32] amen hallelujah
[2:12:35] in other words really i'm not in charge
[2:12:36] of the boat you're not in charge of the
[2:12:38] boat somebody's got a hold of our boat
[2:12:40] amen
[2:12:42] so it's wave after a wave will rush over
[2:12:44] don't worry that guy's the great god
[2:12:47] that great lamb of god will not let go
[2:12:48] of the string amen those are hands you
[2:12:50] can trust those are nail scarred hands
[2:12:52] amen
[2:12:53] and he'll pull you through this way just
[2:12:55] like he did the 2008 wave the 2015 wave
[2:12:58] the 2000 wave all these waves he's going
[2:13:00] to pull us through church if we'll trust
[2:13:02] in the living god if we'll trust in the
[2:13:04] chief captain amen amen
[2:13:06] let's stand
[2:13:13] this scripture while i was praying
[2:13:14] musician's going to come this scripture
[2:13:16] i was praying here at the author just
[2:13:18] come to my mind
[2:13:28] some people out of fear are trying to
[2:13:30] get ready for the rapture
[2:13:31] but the way we do it is we get ready for
[2:13:34] the rapture with the love of god
[2:13:39] so it's the same idea i was saying
[2:13:40] earlier as long as you got the oil
[2:13:42] as long as you've got the oil of the
[2:13:44] holy ghost you've got the love of god
[2:13:46] and paul said when christ comes
[2:13:48] all those think about this all those
[2:13:50] that love him
[2:13:52] will see him
[2:13:53] hallelujah
[2:13:55] church this means the foolish virgin
[2:13:56] won't see him this means a foolish
[2:13:58] virgin doesn't love him like a real
[2:14:00] christian loves them
[2:14:04] see they've foolishly they've loved
[2:14:06] other things right
[2:14:09] if they don't see him as appearing it's
[2:14:10] because they didn't love they were
[2:14:12] afraid of the rapture oh my
[2:14:15] god they got so afraid of the
[2:14:16] tribulation they got so afraid of these
[2:14:17] things they for they failed to love
[2:14:19] jesus christ
[2:14:21] they were foolish
[2:14:24] and chose to be fearful at the time of
[2:14:26] the rapture rather than full of god's
[2:14:27] love
[2:14:28] how many want to be full of god's love
[2:14:30] today amen
[2:14:31] church can i say like this we've got
[2:14:33] thus saith the holy bible
[2:14:36] if you love jesus christ hallelujah now
[2:14:39] if you love jesus christ now you will
[2:14:40] see him at his appearing amen
[2:14:44] so love again is christ love is god god
[2:14:46] is love and god is the holy ghost
[2:14:49] god is the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:14:52] let's bow heads for a moment
[2:14:57] just play that little hymn o love of god
[2:14:59] how rich and pure
[2:15:01] how marvelous and strong

[2:15:24] jesus
[2:15:28] the lord the enemy as we saw would try
[2:15:30] to exalt preachers even inside the
[2:15:33] message
[2:15:34] the enemy would try to exalt the
[2:15:35] churches inside the message but lord
[2:15:37] we've learned from the scriptures we're
[2:15:39] not exalting anyone we are all nothing
[2:15:41] we all get the same wage we all get a
[2:15:43] penny oh god
[2:15:44] hallelujah
[2:15:46] but it's the lord of the harvest it's
[2:15:48] the the god who gives the increase he's
[2:15:50] the great one
[2:15:52] he's the greatest of all time
[2:15:54] because he was like a lamb
[2:15:57] but he became like a goat
[2:16:00] hallelujah

[2:16:14] oh and again thank you lord that you
[2:16:16] sent us these bible revelations

[2:16:21] bringing us truth he was growing in his
[2:16:23] understanding
[2:16:26] and we can see it all boils down to this
[2:16:29] the love of god
[2:16:32] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:16:38] lord may each person
[2:16:42] sorry fall more in love with you dear

[2:16:50] righteousness which the lord shall give
[2:16:52] us at that day and not to us only
[2:16:55] but to all those that love his appearing
[2:16:59] lord
[2:17:00] we battle fears and then when we hear
[2:17:02] the news the lord
[2:17:04] may we just take everything to you in
[2:17:06] prayer dear god
[2:17:09] and may we remember that the great
[2:17:11] captain of the ship has a hold on our
[2:17:14] destination
