[23:43] have a few prayer requests here and then
[23:44] we'll invite our brother to come
[23:46] minister tonight by god's grace i have
[23:49] numerous requests i just wrote them on
[23:50] my phone here so
[23:54] um
[23:57] let's remember uh i have a cousin who
[23:59] was in a car accident today
[24:00] my mom told me not to say much about it
[24:02] so i'm gonna try not to do that
[24:04] um anyways i guess it's very severe
[24:07] um now i know a little bit about the
[24:09] situation
[24:10] um he's kind of backslid from the lord
[24:13] so let's just pray for
[24:14] restoration not only for that health but
[24:16] also for the soul
[24:18] you know i did numerous talks on the
[24:21] phone when i was
[24:22] you know talking about the lord but
[24:24] since then he's kind of straight
[24:26] so that's the mo that's a pretty urgent
[24:28] thing let's remember brother jose's
[24:30] health i talked to him yesterday
[24:32] he said he's still kind of sick and then
[24:34] their family still really tore up about
[24:36] the loss of
[24:36] armando so let's remember him in prayer
[24:40] i think the funeral is wednesday if i'm
[24:41] not mistaken it's wednesday
[24:44] oh yeah he asked for me to pray for um
[24:47] i forgot this one his daughter is flying
[24:50] in tonight
[24:50] into cleveland her name's jolene so
[24:54] let's remember
[24:55] jolene her flight and travel
[24:58] also our sister naomi and wesley and the
[25:00] kids are checking out monday by god's
[25:02] grace
[25:02] so let's continue to pray for them we
[25:04] pray for them wednesday night and
[25:06] i just continue to pray and ask god's
[25:09] blessing upon the trip
[25:10] and god's leadership also that little
[25:13] two-year-old boy we were praying for
[25:14] um still sick but he's out of intensive
[25:17] care so his mom did ask for prayer from
[25:19] all the friends
[25:20] um of the family which i think i'm the
[25:23] only friend of the family but
[25:24] i know your prayers are effective
[25:27] but the dentist had just had an unspoken
[25:29] need for himself to be able to
[25:31] get the channel of god tonight
[25:35] also um just pray for my mother and
[25:39] father i just haven't kind of like a
[25:41] prayer request for them by god's grace
[25:43] we've had some good news and
[25:45] i just don't want to say too much but
[25:47] let's just pray
[25:48] that that situation will be resolved

[40:03] room i was like

[41:35] hey man just uh just notice brother
[41:38] mcbride just expressing himself
[41:41] brother jesse you know us sometimes the
[41:45] anointing of god is kind of flows in a
[41:47] certain way
[41:48] and you just kind of get lost
[41:51] you know you don't mean to you know kind
[41:54] of
[41:55] strongly emphasize certain things but
[41:57] it's just like
[41:58] you want it to be out of your control
[42:01] and then sometimes when it's going on
[42:03] it's like man
[42:04] excuse me i didn't mean that but then
[42:07] you get right back into it
[42:09] again amen so
[42:12] we just want god to have his way tonight
[42:16] amen so uh let's not keep you standing
[42:19] much longer here let's
[42:20] let's turn to psalms chapter 20.
[42:25] i really don't know how it's going to go
[42:27] this
[42:28] particular subject here this is my first
[42:30] time ministering on this subject but it
[42:32] was something that's been on my heart
[42:34] for a little while now
[42:38] so we just look to god to bring it out
[42:40] in whatever way he sees fit
[42:42] yes sir
[42:46] so psalms 20. i want to start in verse
[42:50] 6.
[42:51] it says now now know i that the lord
[42:55] saveth his anointed
[42:57] he will hear him from his holy heaven
[43:00] with the saving strength
[43:02] of his right hand it says
[43:06] some some trust in chariots and some in
[43:10] horses
[43:12] we will remember the name of the lord
[43:14] our god
[43:16] they are brought down and fallen
[43:20] but we are risen and stand upright
[43:24] save lord let the king hear us
[43:28] when we call amen amen let's pray
[43:31] heavenly father
[43:32] lord please help us we ask this
[43:35] in jesus christ's holy and precious name
[43:38] amen
[43:40] praise the lord
[43:44] all right
[43:47] so now is it okay thank you
[43:54] that's convenient okay so um
[44:00] i want to take my time tonight but i
[44:02] don't want to
[44:04] i don't want to keep you terribly long
[44:07] because i know we have service tomorrow
[44:08] morning and
[44:12] but at the same time i don't want to
[44:15] get in god's way um
[44:21] this opening scripture here i'm going to
[44:24] kind of take some turns
[44:26] as we walk through this particular
[44:28] subject
[44:30] but i want to go to verse 7 again of
[44:33] chapter
[44:34] 20 of psalms
[44:39] it says some trust in chariots and some
[44:41] in horses
[44:44] and i want to emphasize that all right
[44:47] because
[44:48] as with all of the scripture you know
[44:50] this is actually god
[44:52] expressing himself through his servant
[44:55] okay so it's not this is not just a
[44:57] man's words
[44:59] it's actually god himself and he's
[45:01] expressing himself
[45:03] right and he's expressing what he sees
[45:06] amongst mankind
[45:08] the different influences and the
[45:10] mindsets and things that nature
[45:13] man so it's the holy spirit just kind of
[45:15] slows you down sometimes and draws your
[45:17] attention to something because it's
[45:18] something that he wants to express
[45:21] so in this part of the scripture he says
[45:23] some trust in chariots
[45:26] and some in horses
[45:31] that's a true statement even today
[45:35] you know people uh people trust in many
[45:39] different things
[45:41] many people trust in the wrong things
[45:44] hey amen and i want to kind of bring
[45:47] that
[45:48] as a focus tonight because in verse 8 it
[45:51] says in
[45:51] this paul verse 8 it says they are
[45:54] brought down
[45:55] and fall there's a consequence
[45:59] when you place your trust in the wrong
[46:01] thing
[46:03] okay so there's a lot going on in the
[46:07] world today
[46:08] uh and there's a lot going on around
[46:10] what god is doing in this hour
[46:13] so as a subject tonight i want to deal
[46:16] with
[46:17] a false sense of security
[46:21] a false sense of security praise god
[46:26] as i was meditating on this particular
[46:28] subject uh
[46:31] it's a lot beginning to come to me
[46:34] because how satan operates
[46:40] this is the thing that he always tries
[46:42] to bring about
[46:44] within anyone that he's trying to pull
[46:48] to his side
[46:50] he tries to give them a false sense of
[46:53] security
[46:55] amen and as an example of that let's go
[46:59] to
[47:01] genesis chapter 3.
[47:06] i have a lot of content here i'm just
[47:09] looking for the leading of the lord on
[47:10] which direction to go
[47:12] so i'm not even going to try to get
[47:15] through all of it i just want to go and
[47:16] stop however he leads me so
[47:19] in genesis chapter 3 starting at verse
[47:21] 4.
[47:23] watch this now i'm talking about a false
[47:25] sense of security
[47:28] it says in verse 4 of genesis chapter 3
[47:30] it says and the serpent said unto the
[47:33] woman
[47:34] ye shall not surely die
[47:38] now god obviously said you will die
[47:41] if you eat of the fruit of the tree of
[47:44] knowledge of good and evil correct
[47:46] amen it was communicated to her because
[47:49] she in turn told satan those exact
[47:52] things
[47:53] right but now notice how satan comes in
[47:57] and within her and he tries to lessen
[48:01] the
[48:01] he tries to take her mind and water down
[48:04] the consequences
[48:10] of yielding to what it is he was trying
[48:12] to impress upon her
[48:18] we understand that right he came in and
[48:21] his objective
[48:22] was in her mind to make her feel
[48:25] comforted
[48:27] and secure
[48:31] and by passing the word of god
[48:35] and yielding and accepting and partaking
[48:37] in
[48:38] what he was offering to her
[48:42] watch
[48:46] because his first word says ye shall not
[48:49] surely die so now that's the consequence
[48:51] that's the thing
[48:52] that hey i can't do this because this
[48:54] will be what happens to me
[48:57] and how many i'm listen sin would not be
[49:00] prevalent within the world today
[49:03] if people did not yield to this very
[49:06] same
[49:07] mindset
[49:10] any sin the enemy has to first convince
[49:14] the individual that there
[49:16] is no consequence or it won't be as bad
[49:19] as you think
[49:23] because when a person feels like that
[49:26] they feel a little more at
[49:27] ease yielding themselves
[49:30] to things that are not right
[49:35] see so he first comes to the mind just
[49:37] like the prophet taught us
[49:38] that's what the greatest battle ever
[49:40] thought is right and in that mind he
[49:42] reasons this is the purpose of the
[49:46] reasoning
[49:46] is to cause the person no matter who
[49:49] they are to yield
[49:52] to feel like oh it's okay if i go ahead
[49:55] and do this there's nothing's gonna
[49:56] happen
[49:59] watch verse 5 says for god doth noted in
[50:03] the day you eat thereof
[50:04] then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[50:06] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[50:10] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[50:12] good for food notice it had already
[50:14] happened
[50:15] this verse right here shows something
[50:17] saints
[50:20] at the reception right and
[50:23] at the reception and the acceptance of
[50:26] satan's
[50:27] reasonings she opened up her mind
[50:31] and she accepted she considered
[50:36] a prophet told us all you have to do is
[50:38] stop for a moment
[50:43] i need to remember nelly sanders yes yes
[50:45] sir
[50:47] the enemy knew remember we've been
[50:50] taught that satan studies us
[50:54] we weren't always saints of god
[50:56] worshiping god
[50:58] singing praises to god trying to yield
[51:00] ourselves to him and die
[51:02] to the things that we won't always like
[51:03] that we had our past lives
[51:06] how many realized satan was there those
[51:08] demon powers were there from the
[51:10] beginning
[51:12] right so everything that we've ever done
[51:15] they they were the ones that made us do
[51:18] it
[51:19] right amen we yielded ourselves to evil
[51:22] spirits and it caused us
[51:24] to live lives contrary to god's word so
[51:27] satan studies us
[51:28] and many times look the issues that we
[51:31] deal with the spiritual issues many
[51:33] times they are repeat
[51:34] issues
[51:39] because he knew if i got you on at one
[51:41] time more than likely i can get you with
[51:42] the same thing again
[51:48] amen so here it is now
[51:53] when you open up your reasonings when
[51:55] you open up your understanding when you
[51:57] when you consider
[51:58] or receive what satan is bringing to
[52:00] your mind
[52:02] a spirit comes in right then
[52:09] satan hadn't touched her right
[52:12] but all of a sudden in verse six what
[52:14] happened since now you see her thoughts
[52:16] beginning to change
[52:20] when nellie sanders stopped for a moment
[52:22] the devil knew she loved that music
[52:25] she loved to dance so when he saw her
[52:27] coming up the road when she turned on
[52:29] that road
[52:30] he had the dj to put on a song that
[52:33] would draw her
[52:35] because he knew her past he knew how to
[52:38] hook her
[52:39] you understand and as she continued to
[52:42] walk up
[52:43] she should never have come up that road
[52:46] when god delivers us from anything since
[52:48] the best thing for us to do
[52:50] is stay as far away from it as we can
[52:53] don't even go by don't touch it
[52:55] don't flip that channel no way near it
[52:58] don't turn that radio station
[53:00] nowhere near it don't go nowhere near
[53:02] that location where you know these
[53:03] things are
[53:05] that were enticing to your spirit
[53:09] she traveled up that road satan had a
[53:12] strategy now
[53:15] she got by the club that song was
[53:18] playing
[53:20] she was outside on the road and she
[53:23] stopped for a moment brother branham
[53:24] said
[53:26] as soon as she she was in the same
[53:28] position that eve is in right here
[53:32] she stopped for a moment and she
[53:35] listened to the music
[53:37] and right then that spirit came inside
[53:40] of her
[53:41] because she went from the road to the
[53:43] stairs and from the stairs to the dance
[53:45] floor
[53:46] how that devil was on the inside of her
[53:50] now
[53:50] leading her
[53:54] good eve just listened
[53:57] he hadn't touched her it was just the it
[54:00] was the grasp
[54:01] of his words that ended on the inside
[54:05] now she had received the spirit of the
[54:07] devil now her mind her thoughts are
[54:09] perceived
[54:10] now what was bad she began to see as
[54:12] being good
[54:13] that's the only way a person can sin
[54:16] that's right
[54:16] right satan has to be able to come in
[54:20] and people don't realize the power of
[54:22] words and what you see
[54:26] certain things ain't even worth
[54:28] listening to yes sir
[54:30] it's not because you're dealing with
[54:31] demons things you can't see
[54:34] listen when the devil enters inside of a
[54:37] person you don't feel nothing in your
[54:39] flesh
[54:40] right you can't you can't detect it
[54:43] like that right but yet it's there
[54:47] the woman when nelly shannon came to
[54:49] herself by the grace of god
[54:51] she ran to brother branham's house
[54:53] opened up the door brother branham
[54:54] prayed for
[54:55] and that bat like spirit came up out of
[54:58] her
[55:00] where did it come in that right on that
[55:02] road when she listened to that music
[55:04] yes sir if eve could see what was going
[55:09] on
[55:09] she would immediately have cut it off
[55:12] but somehow she was blind to be able to
[55:14] see what was happening
[55:16] and we understand god had a great plan
[55:18] that he was unfolding
[55:20] but we're just analyzing this part for
[55:21] the sake of discernment
[55:24] i'm talking about a false sense of
[55:26] security the devil made her watch verse
[55:29] six
[55:29] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[55:31] good for food and that it was
[55:32] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[55:34] to make and a tree to be desired to make
[55:36] one wise
[55:37] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[55:39] eat
[55:41] without fear
[55:44] how did she get to this point saints it
[55:46] was through reasoning power
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] and the reception of the spirit satan's
[55:53] tactics
[55:54] and the first thing you did is made her
[55:57] feel relieved and okay with
[56:02] the devil's knowledge yielding to his
[56:05] actions
[56:07] and the bible says on she took and ate
[56:10] the fruit thereof and did even gave also
[56:12] onto her husband
[56:13] with her and he did it adam willfully
[56:16] saying the scripture lets us know
[56:19] and it's for reasons that only god could
[56:21] bring out in these last days through his
[56:23] prophet he loved his wife
[56:25] and all of it was a plan it was speaking
[56:27] of greater things to come it was a love
[56:29] story
[56:31] praise the lord but nonetheless though
[56:33] he made her feel secure
[56:35] that it was okay to go ahead and partake
[56:37] in that but look at how he did it
[56:39] he just walked he worked with her in her
[56:42] thoughts
[56:47] when you talk about a a false sense of
[56:49] security
[56:50] there's an actual definition that goes
[56:52] along with that that i looked up to my
[56:54] surprise
[56:56] and what it means is this change when
[56:59] you look up a false sense of security
[57:01] it says this to have the illusion
[57:04] of safety and security in a situation
[57:07] that actually poses risk or danger
[57:12] it makes a person feel safe when really
[57:14] there is no safety
[57:16] it's danger but they feel secure they
[57:19] feel confident they feel all right
[57:22] they feel protected
[57:26] wouldn't satan want people to feel that
[57:28] way because see he's the master of
[57:30] illusion
[57:31] you see he wants as many people to
[57:33] follow him as possible
[57:34] so if he can get you to follow him
[57:36] without realizing that's what you're
[57:38] doing
[57:39] he's successful that's how that's why
[57:41] the world is in the conditioning it is
[57:43] today
[57:45] people have have taken on a false sense
[57:47] of security
[57:48] and they think they're all right
[57:52] why don't you come to church see you
[57:53] know god is able to help you bless you
[57:55] sir
[57:56] ah i'm okay i got to work and
[58:00] you know you know uh god is in my heart
[58:02] and
[58:03] you know uh you know we got to go to
[58:05] church churches everywhere the church is
[58:07] in my home
[58:08] all these reasonings and examples that
[58:11] the devil gives to individuals that they
[58:13] don't even realize
[58:14] is coming from a devil
[58:19] that's one thing saying i'm not we're
[58:22] not exempt from this
[58:27] when evil spirits are dealing with us
[58:31] it's not that we're seeing these spirits
[58:33] and we oh that's the devil and whatever
[58:35] whatever
[58:36] many times it's after we've been used
[58:38] and god brings it to our attention
[58:41] and he then leads us to repent
[58:44] many times evil spirits come and we
[58:46] don't realize it and we're operating
[58:48] under a bad anointing
[58:50] a wrong spirit and the holy ghost has to
[58:53] stop us and make us
[58:54] realize hold on do you realize what
[58:57] spirit you are of
[58:58] those two brothers they were just trying
[59:00] to help christ
[59:02] coming from a place and christ was being
[59:04] rejected and they said should we call
[59:05] down fire upon them i believe it was
[59:07] james and john
[59:08] shall we call down fire upon him from
[59:10] heaven as as elijah did
[59:14] and christ was the one that was being
[59:15] persecuted and rejected and he turned
[59:17] and looked at them and said
[59:19] you don't know what spirit you are
[59:22] those two men trying to stand for the
[59:24] word
[59:25] didn't realize they had become anointed
[59:28] by a devil
[59:31] you see how this thing operates without
[59:33] the holy ghost saints wing we ain't got
[59:35] no chance
[59:36] if god don't come and help us we don't
[59:38] know we can't we can't help ourselves
[59:40] keep ourselves we'll be
[59:42] all messed up it's only by the grace of
[59:45] god
[59:46] as me and brother jesse was
[59:48] fellowshipping on last night we touched
[59:50] upon that one part where
[59:52] peter just you're just trying to be over
[59:54] help because he loved christ but he was
[59:56] in a carnal frame of mind
[59:58] that was controlled in many ways by
[1:00:00] satan
[1:00:01] here he is telling the lord lord you
[1:00:03] don't have to go up
[1:00:04] and die like that and all these things
[1:00:06] happen to you and whatever no
[1:00:08] lord forbid from that to happen to you
[1:00:10] and jesus turned around because he was
[1:00:12] god he realized that
[1:00:14] voice something ain't right
[1:00:17] and he looked at peter he said get thee
[1:00:19] behind me satan
[1:00:22] but when you read peter's words none of
[1:00:24] us would have ever detected that that
[1:00:26] was the devil
[1:00:28] because of what he was saying it sounded
[1:00:29] like the loving words of a friend
[1:00:32] but yet it was satan himself trying to
[1:00:35] prevent the word from coming to pass
[1:00:39] but jesus being who he is he looked
[1:00:42] ratted and called it right out
[1:00:44] get me behind me satan
[1:00:50] so a false sense of security is
[1:00:54] is to have the illusion all right so now
[1:00:57] what does illusion mean
[1:00:58] all right it's following me here i'm
[1:01:00] just trying to lay a foundation
[1:01:02] all right because these are things that
[1:01:04] we deal with in everyday life like i
[1:01:05] said
[1:01:06] we're not exempt from it an illusion is
[1:01:09] a thing
[1:01:10] that is or like or or is likely to be
[1:01:13] wrongly perceived or
[1:01:15] interpreted by the senses
[1:01:18] it's a deceptive appearance or
[1:01:20] impression
[1:01:21] a false idea or belief
[1:01:27] for satan likes to create illusions
[1:01:31] within people's spirits in their minds
[1:01:34] to cause them to feel okay with
[1:01:37] accepting something that's contrary to
[1:01:39] god's word
[1:01:41] now notice this i want to touch upon
[1:01:43] this real quickly here
[1:01:45] because this struck me as i read it
[1:01:47] saints all right
[1:01:50] we want to go to uh
[1:01:53] lord have mercy
[1:01:57] let's go to romans chapter 10 and verse
[1:02:01] 13.
[1:02:03] this is a bible truth here but i want to
[1:02:06] show you
[1:02:07] express to you how it was that the lord
[1:02:09] showed it to me on this day
[1:02:11] romans 10 starting at verse 13.
[1:02:15] or rather we're just going to read verse
[1:02:16] 13. watch what it says here now
[1:02:19] it says in verse 13 of romans 10 4
[1:02:22] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:02:24] the lord
[1:02:26] shall be saved can we say amen to that
[1:02:30] that's right amen amen praise the lord
[1:02:34] the bible says that whosoever call upon
[1:02:36] the name of the lord
[1:02:37] shall be saved there are many people
[1:02:39] that proclaim christianity that read
[1:02:41] that scripture and believe it as we do
[1:02:45] but it's a twist to it
[1:02:49] now let's go by the grace of god to
[1:02:52] matthew
[1:02:55] chapter 7. remember that now romans 10
[1:02:59] and 13
[1:03:00] amen those that call whosoever shall
[1:03:04] call upon the name of the lord
[1:03:05] shall shall be said can we say
[1:03:09] shell they don't say maybe willy
[1:03:14] they don't say they don't say mighty say
[1:03:16] shell
[1:03:18] that's sure but watch this
[1:03:21] matthew amen
[1:03:25] matthew chapter what did i say matthew
[1:03:28] chapter 7 i want to start at verse
[1:03:30] 15 it says beware of false prophets
[1:03:34] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[1:03:36] but intimately they are ravening wolves
[1:03:39] it says ye say i'm sorry ye shall know
[1:03:42] them by their fruits do men gather
[1:03:43] grapes of thorns or figs and thistles
[1:03:45] it says even so every good tree bringeth
[1:03:48] forth good fruit
[1:03:49] but the but a corrupt tree bringeth
[1:03:51] forth evil fruit
[1:03:52] it says a good tree cannot bring forth
[1:03:54] evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[1:03:56] bring forth good fruit
[1:03:58] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[1:04:00] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[1:04:02] fire
[1:04:03] now notice in verse 20 remember now in
[1:04:05] romans 10 and 13
[1:04:07] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:04:09] the lord shall be saved
[1:04:12] but notice what it says in verse 20 i
[1:04:14] mean verse 21
[1:04:16] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:04:19] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:04:21] heaven
[1:04:24] so they were calling upon the name of
[1:04:26] the lord
[1:04:34] y'all see that right jesus speaking
[1:04:37] himself
[1:04:39] the same one that spoke romans 10 13
[1:04:42] is now speaking him in matthew 7 and he
[1:04:45] said all that said unto me lord lord
[1:04:48] shall not
[1:04:52] watch this amen
[1:04:56] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:05:00] which is in heaven watch so you have to
[1:05:03] have something something
[1:05:04] that accompanies you saying lord lord
[1:05:08] you have to have something else that
[1:05:09] accompanies your calling upon the name
[1:05:11] of the lord
[1:05:12] you just can't call upon the name of the
[1:05:14] lord and say what the bible says
[1:05:15] whosoever
[1:05:16] shall call upon the name of the lord
[1:05:17] shall be saved no sir
[1:05:20] your life got to be worthy of the gospel
[1:05:25] you have to have a life that accompanies
[1:05:27] that matches your confession
[1:05:30] if you calling him lord i mean he's your
[1:05:32] ruler that means he controls your life
[1:05:36] isn't that the right sense watch this
[1:05:39] though
[1:05:40] not everyone that said unto me lord lost
[1:05:42] an enemy to the kingdom of heaven but he
[1:05:43] do
[1:05:44] do with the will of my father which is
[1:05:46] in heaven
[1:05:47] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:05:50] lord
[1:05:51] have we not prophesied in thy name watch
[1:05:54] this
[1:05:55] i'm talking about a false sense of
[1:05:57] security
[1:06:00] look at the reasons that they begin to
[1:06:02] present forth to the lord
[1:06:07] yeah you called upon his name amen and
[1:06:10] look
[1:06:10] he anointed you he said look they said
[1:06:13] haven't we prophesied in your name
[1:06:15] he didn't deny it yes you prophesied in
[1:06:18] my name
[1:06:19] praise the lord and in thy name have
[1:06:22] cast out devils in whose name
[1:06:25] in christ's name and in thy name done
[1:06:29] many many wonderful works
[1:06:32] they were people that had testimonies
[1:06:34] people that would stand up in meetings
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:37] and give testimony of the power of god
[1:06:40] and what he did in their lives
[1:06:44] things that people sit back and look at
[1:06:46] and say oh my praise god that's a holy
[1:06:48] man of god it might even be a sister
[1:06:50] that gets up
[1:06:51] and give a testimony of something god
[1:06:52] did amen
[1:06:54] right but look i'm talking about a false
[1:06:56] sense of security
[1:06:58] many people feel as though because god
[1:07:00] moved at a certain time in a certain way
[1:07:03] that that testifies over some sort of
[1:07:06] seal that they're okay all around to the
[1:07:10] end
[1:07:10] when they know full well their lives
[1:07:12] don't match that word
[1:07:16] lord have mercy see i told you guys
[1:07:22] i get excited but look you see you see
[1:07:24] this yes
[1:07:27] how you see they they prophesied they
[1:07:30] cast out
[1:07:31] devils many wonderful works were done
[1:07:33] operated in gifts and everything
[1:07:35] and the devil made them take that as a
[1:07:38] security
[1:07:39] and a sign that they were all right with
[1:07:41] god
[1:07:43] he said depart from me i never knew you
[1:07:47] how did they feel otherwise what made
[1:07:50] them believe otherwise
[1:07:51] it was the same tricks of the devil that
[1:07:54] he used on
[1:07:55] eve came to their minds through
[1:07:57] reasoning and twisted things up in such
[1:07:59] a way
[1:08:03] and it made them feel all right
[1:08:07] yeah i know my life ain't right here and
[1:08:09] there
[1:08:10] but look at how the lord is moving i
[1:08:12] believe i'm his child see
[1:08:16] and they and they were able to carry on
[1:08:19] in that way
[1:08:20] trusting in what
[1:08:24] trusting in how they saw the lord move
[1:08:26] in their lives
[1:08:27] but yet they didn't align themselves
[1:08:29] with the word
[1:08:34] that's what anointed ones in the end
[1:08:36] time was all about
[1:08:37] yes god being able to rain down his
[1:08:40] blessings powers and gifts and
[1:08:43] everything upon a people
[1:08:48] brother branham said those two men spoke
[1:08:50] in tongues under the same anointing
[1:08:52] that's right but then god let him take a
[1:08:56] little closer look
[1:08:58] he wanted to shake their hand and look
[1:08:59] in their eyes and talk to him a little
[1:09:01] bit
[1:09:02] and all of a sudden the holy ghost began
[1:09:04] to reveal this man is a true christian
[1:09:06] but this man right here he got two
[1:09:08] different women in his life
[1:09:11] but operating under the same power
[1:09:13] calling upon the name of the lord
[1:09:15] felt secure was in a service feeling
[1:09:19] comforted
[1:09:20] do you see the devil will always do that
[1:09:23] somehow or another he'll make you feel
[1:09:25] like you're an exception of some kind
[1:09:27] somehow like you're special or something
[1:09:29] like you ain't got to fully line up with
[1:09:31] the word
[1:09:32] you ain't got to throw it up
[1:09:36] and that way let it cause a person to
[1:09:38] let down
[1:09:39] and and feel okay with going to church
[1:09:42] operating in a gift
[1:09:43] and then going home and doing things
[1:09:45] that they know they shouldn't be doing
[1:09:47] that same god that spoke to you there
[1:09:49] warns you in your heart not to do that
[1:09:51] no more
[1:09:52] and you ignore him
[1:09:56] i don't know why i'm saying these things
[1:09:59] in this way but
[1:10:02] per adventure might be somebody you know
[1:10:05] the lord knows yes but you under you see
[1:10:09] you see what i'm saying
[1:10:10] that's how the devil operates he makes
[1:10:12] people feel okay
[1:10:14] he he lessens the he he lessens in their
[1:10:17] minds
[1:10:18] he lessens the consequence upon
[1:10:21] themselves
[1:10:23] and notice this is something also i
[1:10:25] noticed in ecclesiastes saints
[1:10:27] ecclesiastes chapter eight
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:31] ecclesiastes chapter eight starting at
[1:10:33] well just one verse
[1:10:34] we're actually starting at verse eleven
[1:10:36] ecclesiastes eight in verse eleven it
[1:10:38] says
[1:10:40] how many guys say amen always up there
[1:10:42] all right praise the lord
[1:10:44] because sentence against an evil work is
[1:10:47] not
[1:10:47] executed speedily therefore the heart of
[1:10:51] the sons of men
[1:10:52] is fully set in them to do evil
[1:11:00] because when you do wrong nothing
[1:11:01] happens right away
[1:11:04] and the more look like brother branham
[1:11:06] told us god made
[1:11:08] every man with that sense within him you
[1:11:10] know right from wrong
[1:11:12] but what happens is the devil through
[1:11:14] his reasonings cause
[1:11:16] people to feel secure it in that
[1:11:19] i'm gonna say it like this in his
[1:11:21] decision because it's not theirs
[1:11:23] they yield themselves to the devil's
[1:11:25] mind and then they begin to walk
[1:11:26] according to his will
[1:11:29] right right and as they go to walk
[1:11:32] according to his will to get into it or
[1:11:34] do whatever it is that it
[1:11:35] is you got to bypass that first time i
[1:11:38] was listening to the prophet recently
[1:11:41] and he was saying how a mother might
[1:11:43] come into a child
[1:11:44] and that child might have been smoking
[1:11:47] and the mother might ask the child
[1:11:48] child have you been smoking he says now
[1:11:51] in your heart immediately that little
[1:11:54] buzzer goes over and said don't you lie
[1:11:56] little child
[1:11:59] he said but immediately the devil comes
[1:12:01] in and he begins to make that child try
[1:12:03] to cover it up to try to shun
[1:12:05] judgment for that time he don't want to
[1:12:08] get spanked or
[1:12:09] chastised or whatever the case might be
[1:12:11] so the devil leads that child
[1:12:14] to try to cover up the smell of the
[1:12:16] cigarette in their mouths
[1:12:17] and then tell the mother no i wasn't
[1:12:21] smoking mama
[1:12:22] he said the next time it's easier for
[1:12:24] that child to do it again
[1:12:27] once you bypass it that's how it
[1:12:30] operates
[1:12:31] the devil now causes you to feel secure
[1:12:34] because you did it and you were able to
[1:12:36] get away with it
[1:12:38] see anything happen and the devil can't
[1:12:41] say see you all right
[1:12:42] but didn't you enjoy that you can go and
[1:12:44] do it again
[1:12:45] and he tries to make them more deceptive
[1:12:48] with it
[1:12:49] cover up their tracks more so
[1:12:52] that's exactly what happens lord have
[1:12:55] mercy
[1:12:57] i'm gonna make a statement that's not
[1:12:58] popular but yet i
[1:13:04] there's many things that exist within
[1:13:06] the bride
[1:13:08] right that's why we ain't gone yet
[1:13:13] god's working with each one of us yes
[1:13:16] sir
[1:13:16] these besetting sins these wastes that
[1:13:19] hold us down and hold us back
[1:13:21] keeps us from thriving and really
[1:13:22] progressing and moving forward in the
[1:13:24] things of god
[1:13:26] all right but him being our father see
[1:13:28] he
[1:13:29] loves us and the devil calls is that the
[1:13:32] mesa be misinterpreted
[1:13:34] god begins to bring correctional
[1:13:36] chastise and people get upset with the
[1:13:38] word and the minister
[1:13:39] knowing full well that's in your life
[1:13:41] why are you getting upset with me i
[1:13:43] ain't the one doing the wrong
[1:13:44] i ain't know nothing about your life but
[1:13:47] the devil want to blind them to be able
[1:13:49] to recognize god in their midst
[1:13:53] cause him not to be able to see the love
[1:13:55] of god
[1:13:56] yes there's things i've had to deal with
[1:13:59] in my own home with my children as they
[1:14:01] were coming up
[1:14:03] it's one thing i tried to make sure i
[1:14:04] emphasized and i said now why do you
[1:14:06] think the lord allowed this to be found
[1:14:08] out about
[1:14:10] you realizing because he loved you it's
[1:14:13] his
[1:14:14] grace to you because he sees the enemy
[1:14:17] had a grip
[1:14:19] and he came to loose you
[1:14:23] but in that little mind it can't grab
[1:14:25] certain things at that time
[1:14:27] so they hear you but they don't hear you
[1:14:32] you understand what i'm saying but this
[1:14:35] is how the devil operates saints
[1:14:44] so when you have a false sense of
[1:14:45] security
[1:14:47] the devil creates an illusion that
[1:14:50] you're okay when you're not okay
[1:14:53] the things we just read are not saints
[1:14:55] the people we just read about that
[1:14:56] christ gave the example of in matthew 7
[1:14:59] they operated by the power of god in
[1:15:01] many different things
[1:15:03] but the devil calls them to misinterpret
[1:15:06] what was really going on
[1:15:08] because now even though they had things
[1:15:10] in their lives that wasn't right
[1:15:13] he made them feel like they were still
[1:15:15] okay
[1:15:16] god still loves you and he does
[1:15:19] but he hates the sins
[1:15:24] and the bible is true when it says that
[1:15:26] no adulterer no whoremonger and all
[1:15:28] these things you will not enter into the
[1:15:30] kingdom of heaven
[1:15:31] that's right the devil will never
[1:15:34] emphasize that he'll make it seem he'll
[1:15:36] make you not even
[1:15:38] people throw those scriptures away all
[1:15:39] day long for the sake of feeling okay
[1:15:42] and comforted and not feeling the
[1:15:44] conviction of the word
[1:15:46] anytime they hear anything that's
[1:15:48] pertaining to that when they know
[1:15:49] they're wrong in their lives they want
[1:15:51] to say you're judging me no
[1:15:52] i'm not judging you that's just a
[1:15:54] discernment of the holy ghost coming to
[1:15:56] help you in your life right now
[1:15:59] i'm not judging you but at the same time
[1:16:01] you are being judged
[1:16:05] jesus said i don't judge you he said you
[1:16:07] have one that judge you even the word
[1:16:09] that i speak unto you they shall judge
[1:16:10] you in that day
[1:16:11] that's right like we were talking about
[1:16:14] last night brother the voice of many
[1:16:15] waters what
[1:16:16] people don't realize it's christ and his
[1:16:18] bride
[1:16:20] walking around and like we were talking
[1:16:23] about brother people that that just are
[1:16:25] so
[1:16:26] normal and average and whatever people
[1:16:28] look right over the living word
[1:16:30] do you realize that's how christ was the
[1:16:33] bible says he had no beauty that we
[1:16:34] should desire him
[1:16:36] he walked past people all day long in
[1:16:38] the markets they bumped into the lord
[1:16:39] jesus christ god himself
[1:16:44] and didn't even realize it
[1:16:53] okay
[1:17:00] when you're dealing with the word trust
[1:17:03] because the bible says some trusting
[1:17:04] chariots some in horses
[1:17:07] that means that's where their confidence
[1:17:09] was the word trust means
[1:17:10] firm belief in the in the reliability
[1:17:14] truth ability or strength of someone or
[1:17:17] something
[1:17:19] the bible says some trusting horses
[1:17:22] summon chariots they relied upon it
[1:17:27] amen yes it was uh they had
[1:17:30] confidence in the ability of it
[1:17:39] so now what satan does saints
[1:17:44] as he comes and he tries to remove
[1:17:49] our confidence off of the word of god
[1:17:53] and place our confidence onto his word
[1:17:59] can we say amen to that amen he tries to
[1:18:02] remove
[1:18:03] our confidence off of the word of god
[1:18:06] and place our confidence in his word
[1:18:13] this is the reason why we have
[1:18:17] so many things that are taking place
[1:18:20] right now
[1:18:22] in regards to the falling away from the
[1:18:25] word
[1:18:26] how many realize that has to happen
[1:18:29] amen except they're coming falling away
[1:18:31] first
[1:18:33] but how does that falling away take
[1:18:35] place
[1:18:37] it's exactly what i'm talking about
[1:18:39] right now
[1:18:41] the devil comes in and he begins to
[1:18:44] reason with a person's mind
[1:18:48] and he begins to minister his gospel
[1:18:52] how many understand that yes sin begins
[1:18:55] to minister his gospel
[1:18:57] and his interpretation
[1:19:01] that he wants us to receive
[1:19:04] praise the lord amen and at the
[1:19:07] reception
[1:19:08] of that word it causes people to put
[1:19:12] down the word of god
[1:19:14] and to turn to error
[1:19:18] praise the lord all right to turn to
[1:19:20] actual error saints
[1:19:23] let me read to you this right here
[1:19:29] turn me to chronicle second chronicles
[1:19:31] chapter 26.
[1:19:37] second chronicles chapter 26 starting at
[1:19:39] verse 16.
[1:19:45] it says but when he was when he was
[1:19:48] strong talking about isaiah
[1:19:50] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[1:19:53] up in his destruct to his destruction
[1:19:55] notice that now
[1:19:58] because when you have a false sense of
[1:19:59] security
[1:20:01] there's one thing that that several
[1:20:03] things that that come along with that
[1:20:06] right and this is one of them right here
[1:20:11] in order for you to begin to walk away
[1:20:14] from the word of god or take a stand
[1:20:16] against the word of god
[1:20:18] first you have to you have to first be
[1:20:20] lifted up in your own heart
[1:20:25] now how many realize that's that's a
[1:20:27] characteristic of satan
[1:20:31] that's what happened in heaven first
[1:20:32] before all these things took place upon
[1:20:34] the earth
[1:20:36] he had a thought it dominated him
[1:20:40] it consumed him he wanted to be like god
[1:20:43] right yeah so he wasn't able to accept
[1:20:47] god's program the way that it was he
[1:20:49] wanted to be more than what he was made
[1:20:51] for
[1:20:54] isn't that something yes and one thing
[1:20:56] that happened to him
[1:20:57] in his heart he became lifted up
[1:21:00] he began to think more of himself than
[1:21:02] what he actually was
[1:21:06] now right here this happened to isaiah
[1:21:08] and the bible says it plainly
[1:21:09] it says his heart was lifted up to his
[1:21:12] destruction
[1:21:13] satan's heart was lifted up to his
[1:21:15] casting out from heaven as well his
[1:21:17] destruction is coming
[1:21:18] right but when his heart was lifted up
[1:21:20] he got cast out of heaven because god
[1:21:23] he don't play with that
[1:21:26] it goes on to say for he transgressed
[1:21:28] against the lord his god
[1:21:30] and went into the temple of the lord and
[1:21:32] to burn incense upon the altar of
[1:21:34] incense
[1:21:36] and as a writer the heart the priests
[1:21:38] went in after him and with and with him
[1:21:41] four score priests of the lord
[1:21:42] that were valiant men it says and they
[1:21:46] withstood as i
[1:21:47] the king and said unto him it
[1:21:50] appertained of not unto theesiah to burn
[1:21:53] incense unto the lord but to the priests
[1:21:55] of the sons of aaron
[1:21:57] that are consecrated to burn incense go
[1:22:00] out of the sanctuary for thou hast
[1:22:02] trespassed neither shall it be for thy
[1:22:05] honor from the lord god
[1:22:08] but notice aziah had another spirit on
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:13] there was something that happened in the
[1:22:15] unseen realm
[1:22:17] that assad didn't even he didn't even
[1:22:19] realize what was going on with him
[1:22:20] himself
[1:22:21] he didn't realize he was being anointed
[1:22:23] of a devil
[1:22:25] but now he rushes into the temple of god
[1:22:28] to try to do a service to god
[1:22:30] that wasn't ordained for him to do god
[1:22:32] already had an order that was already in
[1:22:34] place he was well acquainted with it
[1:22:38] but because he was anointed by that
[1:22:40] spirit the devil gave him a
[1:22:41] false sense of security i don't care
[1:22:45] listen you're the king you can do
[1:22:47] anything you want to do
[1:22:50] if you what what think about it what
[1:22:52] sense did it make why was he so
[1:22:54] fixed on having to go burn incense
[1:22:58] what was the big deal with that
[1:23:02] you know the devil all he wants us to do
[1:23:04] all day long is go contrary to god's
[1:23:06] word
[1:23:06] somehow nice right
[1:23:10] this was just the way in which god knew
[1:23:12] that he would fall by
[1:23:15] then it didn't make no sense king you
[1:23:17] the king what why you want to go burn
[1:23:19] incense
[1:23:21] and offer that seemingly small thing
[1:23:23] look at what happened to him
[1:23:26] praise the lord it says in verse 19
[1:23:29] then isaiah was rough
[1:23:33] and had a sensor in his hand to burn
[1:23:36] incense
[1:23:36] and while he was wroth with the priest
[1:23:39] the leprosy even rolls up in his
[1:23:41] forehead before the priest in the house
[1:23:43] of the lord
[1:23:44] from beside the incense altar you see
[1:23:48] that the devil made him feel comforted
[1:23:52] and okay made him not even think about
[1:23:56] the consequence
[1:24:02] don't let that marinate a little bit
[1:24:04] yeah
[1:24:06] the devil in his mind reasoned with him
[1:24:10] i wish the bible would have somehow let
[1:24:13] that be
[1:24:13] like written this was a conversation
[1:24:17] satan had with his eye
[1:24:19] then we would have known the faults but
[1:24:22] we can see
[1:24:23] by his actions that it had to be in this
[1:24:28] line
[1:24:30] now he's been persuaded now he's in
[1:24:33] action
[1:24:34] now he's fixed on doing what he feels to
[1:24:37] do
[1:24:38] go contrary to the word of god
[1:24:42] and stand to be argumentative with the
[1:24:44] priest
[1:24:46] the men that god ordained it had the
[1:24:48] anointing of god upon him and was
[1:24:50] standing by the spirit of the lord
[1:24:52] trying to stop him
[1:24:53] from destroying himself
[1:24:56] how many people are doing that in this
[1:24:58] hour
[1:25:00] the same spirit of god here in his bride
[1:25:03] trying to keep people from going forward
[1:25:05] any father
[1:25:06] you're going forward to your own
[1:25:08] destruction
[1:25:10] and god's ministry is healed to us by
[1:25:12] his spirit
[1:25:13] cried out and what the
[1:25:17] they're getting wrong they're getting
[1:25:19] upset as
[1:25:20] isaiah did and as soon as he got upset
[1:25:24] the bible said the leprosy began to form
[1:25:26] right there in his forehead
[1:25:34] his fall had began yes right there
[1:25:39] yes
[1:25:43] it was a trick of the devil that he fell
[1:25:45] for
[1:25:47] i don't know what his thoughts were at
[1:25:48] that time but you can only imagine
[1:25:53] from that point his decline was rapid
[1:25:56] yes
[1:25:57] he was done yeah yes
[1:26:01] see he he he he immediately was taken
[1:26:03] out
[1:26:04] physically but whenever somebody takes a
[1:26:07] stand against god in this hour against
[1:26:10] god's truth
[1:26:11] this same thing happened but in a
[1:26:13] spiritual sense
[1:26:15] yes they begin to go down
[1:26:20] they begin to die spiritually
[1:26:24] because they were fighting against the
[1:26:25] lord and his christ
[1:26:31] the grace of god trying to help trying
[1:26:34] to stop
[1:26:35] please don't do that you're going wrong
[1:26:37] you're going the wrong way
[1:26:40] that's not of me
[1:26:51] verse 20 and as a ride a chief priest
[1:26:53] and all the priests looked upon him and
[1:26:55] behold he was leperous in his forehead
[1:26:57] and they thrust him out from thence it
[1:27:00] says yea
[1:27:01] himself hasted also to go out because
[1:27:03] the lord had smitten him
[1:27:05] and isaiah the king was a leper unto the
[1:27:08] day of his death and dwelt in a
[1:27:10] several house being a leper for he was
[1:27:13] cut off from the house of the lord
[1:27:15] and jotham his son was over the king's
[1:27:18] house judging the people of the lord
[1:27:20] i mean judging the people of the land
[1:27:23] but branham says this here in a message
[1:27:26] called
[1:27:26] influence he says now we find out when
[1:27:29] you get
[1:27:30] lifted up right then you're on your road
[1:27:33] down see
[1:27:35] when you lift yourself up
[1:27:39] as we work through this particular
[1:27:41] subject that's a common thing i kept
[1:27:44] seeing
[1:27:45] is self proclamations yes
[1:27:49] i mean hope okay thessalonians chapter
[1:27:53] five
[1:27:55] starting at verse one it says but of the
[1:27:58] times and the seasons brethren you have
[1:28:01] no need that i write unto you
[1:28:03] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:28:05] lord that the day of the lord so cometh
[1:28:07] as a thief in the night
[1:28:09] for when they shall say
[1:28:14] notice who's saying it now
[1:28:18] it's a false sense of security for when
[1:28:20] they shall say
[1:28:22] peace and safety what made them say that
[1:28:24] the bible says it was them but it was a
[1:28:26] devil
[1:28:30] it wasn't god giving them that assurance
[1:28:32] it was a devil giving them that
[1:28:33] assurance
[1:28:34] like it gave me eve you shall not surely
[1:28:37] die
[1:28:38] it's peace and safety you can do however
[1:28:40] you want to do and whatever
[1:28:42] you want to do you can push your own
[1:28:43] agenda to whatever degree and limit
[1:28:47] all is well you're okay
[1:28:50] sudden destruction is not coming to you
[1:28:56] see you made that decision you did that
[1:28:58] and look you you're just fine
[1:29:01] listen to this now
[1:29:06] a person might make a decision that's
[1:29:09] contrary to the word
[1:29:10] and choose a lifestyle and an avenue to
[1:29:13] go by
[1:29:14] that's contrary that's wrong obviously
[1:29:18] but they can still go about their live
[1:29:20] streams and actually seemingly be
[1:29:22] blessed
[1:29:28] their job status might get better their
[1:29:30] income might get better
[1:29:32] whatever the case might be if they're a
[1:29:34] minister they might gain a large
[1:29:37] following
[1:29:39] huh and they might take that as signs of
[1:29:43] being the blessings of god
[1:29:49] it says when they shall say peace and
[1:29:51] safety then
[1:29:52] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[1:29:55] travail upon a woman with child
[1:29:58] and they shall not escape so with a
[1:30:00] woman getting ready to have a child
[1:30:03] right unless it's a uh already scheduled
[1:30:07] c-section
[1:30:09] right nobody knows the minute the second
[1:30:12] or the hour that child is gonna actually
[1:30:14] come out
[1:30:17] i have five
[1:30:21] the doctors actually thought they knew
[1:30:22] what they were doing
[1:30:25] because of their past experience they
[1:30:28] came my wife came in
[1:30:29] oh you're okay you're not but uh so many
[1:30:32] centimeters or whatever
[1:30:34] you you know we got time you can send us
[1:30:36] home
[1:30:39] and as soon as we got home and i pulled
[1:30:41] in my driveway my wife water broke
[1:30:45] she was in the house telling me the baby
[1:30:47] was coming
[1:30:49] i said now why that doctor told us to go
[1:30:51] home
[1:30:55] he the doctor i was supposed to be able
[1:30:56] to trust in him right he's supposed to
[1:30:58] know what he doing
[1:31:00] my wife said a baby coming i said no it
[1:31:02] hang
[1:31:04] i said that's why i said no it's not
[1:31:07] they don't come with me in the house by
[1:31:08] myself
[1:31:09] we got to get to the hospital i'll be
[1:31:14] unfainted
[1:31:16] police saw i called 9-1-1 and i remember
[1:31:19] when i called 9-1-1
[1:31:21] they gonna charge me extra money so i
[1:31:24] hung the phone up
[1:31:26] i want the ambulance to come they gonna
[1:31:28] charge me more money
[1:31:31] but because i dialed 9-1-1 they traced
[1:31:33] the call and they were knocking at my
[1:31:34] door and i was trying to get my wife to
[1:31:35] the car
[1:31:36] he said somebody called 9-1-1 i said yes
[1:31:38] sir it was me my wife having a baby he
[1:31:40] said come on
[1:31:41] got in the car he counted his lights he
[1:31:43] followed him she had the baby
[1:31:44] baby 10 minutes later
[1:31:50] now that doc that i thought you knew
[1:31:51] what you was talking about man you
[1:31:53] almost put me in a bind
[1:31:58] that see that man has limitations they
[1:32:01] think they know when they don't know we
[1:32:03] are so prone and subject to error
[1:32:06] we don't know nothing the bible says
[1:32:08] that right when a person thinks they
[1:32:10] know anything they don't know nothing as
[1:32:11] they ought to as of yet
[1:32:13] that's true that's bible
[1:32:18] when they shall say peace and safety
[1:32:20] watch
[1:32:21] they just said peace and safety but the
[1:32:23] bible says sudden destruction comes
[1:32:26] right i thought it was peace and safety
[1:32:28] what gave you that illusion
[1:32:32] what made you think everything was
[1:32:34] alright and that you could say it was
[1:32:36] peace and safety
[1:32:37] that wasn't the lord's word see they
[1:32:40] didn't realize they were in danger
[1:32:44] how many understand now watch this
[1:32:47] this is what the prophet goes on to say
[1:32:49] about this
[1:32:51] and isaiah ought to have taken that heed
[1:32:55] the warning of the priest now remember
[1:32:58] we call on him
[1:32:59] or we call him watch how he says this
[1:33:01] now talking about isaiah
[1:33:03] he says remember now he says we call him
[1:33:06] today a
[1:33:07] christian that god has blessed
[1:33:10] josiah was a blessed man god blessed his
[1:33:13] kingdom he blessed all of his efforts
[1:33:15] he had a thriving kingdom under his rule
[1:33:18] he saw a hand of god in many ways
[1:33:21] satisfying and increasing him in all
[1:33:24] sorts of things
[1:33:26] but because he saw god blessing him in
[1:33:28] such a way
[1:33:29] he began to feel secure that he was all
[1:33:32] right that he was above
[1:33:34] the word of god
[1:33:37] how many people fall for that same trap
[1:33:40] just because god did so many things and
[1:33:43] you got so many tests
[1:33:44] who cares you got to go along with god
[1:33:47] all the way into the end
[1:33:49] humbly submissively
[1:33:55] when a person has a false sense of
[1:33:56] security
[1:33:58] what comes along with that also is
[1:34:02] arrogance
[1:34:04] because the devil has convinced them
[1:34:05] that you're okay and that you're
[1:34:07] right and they go forth boldly to do
[1:34:10] whatever it is
[1:34:11] in their heart to do that was put in
[1:34:13] there by satan they're carrying out
[1:34:15] as christ said to the pharisees you of
[1:34:18] your father the devil and his
[1:34:19] lusts ye do
[1:34:24] so satan has lusts and people carry
[1:34:26] those lusts out as they yield to him so
[1:34:32] when you see a person that's lusting
[1:34:33] after the wrong things of the world
[1:34:35] that's not them they don't realize that
[1:34:36] though that's evil spirits
[1:34:39] controlling them from the inside pushing
[1:34:42] them driving them
[1:34:47] and again they only get to that place
[1:34:49] when they're able to feel
[1:34:50] like there's nothing that's going to
[1:34:51] happen to them somehow they're special
[1:34:54] god and them got a special relationship
[1:34:57] and
[1:34:57] and and everything gonna be all the
[1:34:59] rights you know i'm like the thief on
[1:35:00] the cross sees
[1:35:01] he was there and the lord took him right
[1:35:03] in ci you don't know how god gonna do so
[1:35:05] don't judge me
[1:35:09] isn't that something
[1:35:12] watch he was a man
[1:35:17] that was blessed by god but he did not
[1:35:20] want to stand correction
[1:35:24] how many realize the bible says as many
[1:35:26] as the lord loves
[1:35:28] he chastens them amen yazar didn't know
[1:35:31] that was the love of god coming to him
[1:35:33] through the priests
[1:35:35] he was just so fixed on having his own
[1:35:37] way and doing his own thing
[1:35:39] the devil blinded him from what was
[1:35:41] really happening
[1:35:43] if he would have just stopped and said
[1:35:44] you know what
[1:35:46] you're absolutely right i'm out of order
[1:35:48] this i'm the king but i ain't a priest
[1:35:51] god didn't ordain me to do that watch
[1:35:56] how he goes on to say this no matter how
[1:35:58] much the word
[1:35:59] said it what it was so he didn't want to
[1:36:01] understand that
[1:36:04] again with all the false doctrines and
[1:36:06] things that are breaking out all around
[1:36:07] the message now
[1:36:08] this is the exact thing that's happening
[1:36:11] they don't want to hear what the word
[1:36:13] really has to say they reason against it
[1:36:15] they shut it down they call it not of
[1:36:17] god and all of that
[1:36:22] he says this is again the message of
[1:36:24] influence
[1:36:25] it's in 1963 november the 11th this is
[1:36:28] part b
[1:36:29] it says watch this now
[1:36:32] and that's what's the matter with our
[1:36:34] peoples around the world today
[1:36:36] today around the world that they think
[1:36:39] that god will let them get by with
[1:36:41] something contrary to his word
[1:36:44] he'll never do it we must come back to
[1:36:46] correction and stand correction by the
[1:36:49] word
[1:36:50] and because of his arrogance talking
[1:36:52] about isaiah
[1:36:53] and because of his arrogance his
[1:36:56] arrogant way of acting
[1:36:58] he says he paid no attention to what
[1:37:00] this minister had to say
[1:37:02] he would do what he wanted to do just
[1:37:06] think now just stop in that mind just
[1:37:08] stop
[1:37:09] in in your mind a minute on that point
[1:37:12] he says how can a child now listen how
[1:37:14] he says this now
[1:37:15] how can a child face a father and mother
[1:37:18] that's godly
[1:37:19] how could a teenager look in the face of
[1:37:22] a godly old mother with her hair turning
[1:37:24] grave
[1:37:25] and say to this teenager honey mother
[1:37:28] has raised you different
[1:37:29] and you see back down through life
[1:37:32] what's
[1:37:32] done was done for mother meaning how god
[1:37:35] dealt with her and helped her and
[1:37:36] blessed her right
[1:37:38] all right he says don't do that and turn
[1:37:41] and not talking about the child and turn
[1:37:44] arrogant the child
[1:37:45] and turn arrogant and say take your
[1:37:48] religion and go
[1:37:49] i'll do what i want to do
[1:37:53] how many young people have i seen
[1:37:56] as they come up and as they reach
[1:37:58] certain ages the devil gets in their
[1:38:00] minds
[1:38:02] and makes them feel so secure in their
[1:38:04] thoughts
[1:38:06] they got it all figured out but you
[1:38:08] ain't went nowhere and did nothing yet
[1:38:11] you understand the whole world and how
[1:38:13] everything goes together nobody can't
[1:38:15] tell you
[1:38:16] got it i know i know i know i got it i
[1:38:19] know i'm gonna be all right
[1:38:20] all i need to do is reach 18 you'll see
[1:38:23] i got it all together
[1:38:25] i got a plan everything already waiting
[1:38:27] for me
[1:38:28] just just stand back and watch mom and
[1:38:29] daddy i'm gonna show you something
[1:38:33] not realizing god as with those priests
[1:38:36] to isaiah
[1:38:37] god is in those parents trying to guide
[1:38:39] and direct that child
[1:38:41] in the right way away from death and
[1:38:44] destruction
[1:38:46] and into the ways of life and peace and
[1:38:48] comfort
[1:38:49] in the true sense of the word amen
[1:38:54] but he reached those ages and the devil
[1:38:55] get in that mind that unconverted mind
[1:38:57] and somehow he begins to work with those
[1:38:59] thoughts and they just think they got
[1:39:01] everything together
[1:39:02] they don't want to hear nothing from
[1:39:04] nobody that's not in line
[1:39:06] with what they want to do already not
[1:39:08] knowing what's giving you those thoughts
[1:39:10] to want to do that in that way
[1:39:12] god will have you be obedient to your
[1:39:14] parents
[1:39:17] just to show you trying to rub against
[1:39:19] the grain shows
[1:39:20] it's evidence what kind of the spirit
[1:39:22] that is
[1:39:24] as i didn't know that was a devil on him
[1:39:28] it just made him want to go contrary and
[1:39:31] brother branham is bringing this example
[1:39:33] out
[1:39:33] saying that teenage daughter tell their
[1:39:35] mother take your religion and go out do
[1:39:37] what i want to do
[1:39:39] didn't brother branham's own daughter go
[1:39:40] through that phase
[1:39:42] right disobedient showing herself
[1:39:47] trying to find herself but at the same
[1:39:49] time being deceived about the thing
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:51] and caused her to do all kind of things
[1:39:53] that was hurtful to her parents
[1:40:00] and then yet in that way in that time
[1:40:02] and that in that same situation god came
[1:40:04] down through his prophet
[1:40:05] and said now even though she's acting
[1:40:07] like that this is how we need to handle
[1:40:09] her
[1:40:10] she needs a friend right now
[1:40:13] so you can't respond and allow yourself
[1:40:16] to get into your feelings
[1:40:19] you gotta humble yourself and yield
[1:40:20] yourself to god
[1:40:22] and allow god to work through you
[1:40:24] because this is how he's going to combat
[1:40:26] the devil
[1:40:27] not coming with all kind of strong words
[1:40:29] and things of that nature
[1:40:30] but this is how god is going to work
[1:40:32] against the devil you become her friend
[1:40:35] you be a friend to her because if she
[1:40:37] don't get it in you the double gonna
[1:40:38] give her a friend somewhere else
[1:40:41] and hot boy
[1:40:44] i mean i'm a dad now i got some children
[1:40:47] there now
[1:40:48] i don't know what it is about children
[1:40:50] they somehow trust in other children
[1:40:58] young adults trusting other young adults
[1:41:01] over their parents this young adult
[1:41:04] ain't got a job
[1:41:05] they ain't been no way in life ain't
[1:41:07] experiencing them but somehow they got
[1:41:09] wisdom that excels their parents in the
[1:41:11] eyes of that child
[1:41:18] that's the truth and it's the wrong
[1:41:21] influence
[1:41:25] why the devil the devil has made them
[1:41:28] feel secure
[1:41:29] through the words of someone else
[1:41:32] and it causes them to work against
[1:41:37] the very words of god that he's speaking
[1:41:40] through the ones that actually love them
[1:41:43] want the best for them
[1:41:50] amen he says what's the outcome of that
[1:41:54] teenager
[1:41:55] what happens to them it's gone they're
[1:41:58] lost spiritually
[1:41:59] morally many times physically and
[1:42:02] mentally
[1:42:03] they are completely cut off from mercy
[1:42:05] he says well then that would be a
[1:42:07] horrible thing for a teenage boy or girl
[1:42:10] watch how he says these saints then
[1:42:12] think about a man or a woman
[1:42:14] down in the ministry or a christian that
[1:42:17] calls himself a child of god
[1:42:20] and look into the commandments of god
[1:42:22] and turn their back and say my
[1:42:24] denomination don't believe it like that
[1:42:31] by their proclamation they're stating
[1:42:34] where their confidence is
[1:42:36] where their trust is they're relying
[1:42:39] upon they got
[1:42:40] confidence in what my church teaches
[1:42:43] now when it's the truth that's right
[1:42:47] but what's truth everybody says they
[1:42:51] have truth
[1:42:52] but there's only one truth and those
[1:42:55] that are
[1:42:56] fortunate by the grace of god to be a
[1:42:58] part of that
[1:42:59] they really have it they say they have
[1:43:01] it and they really have it
[1:43:03] the other ones say they have it and they
[1:43:04] don't have it at all
[1:43:07] they have a false sense of security is
[1:43:09] what they have
[1:43:11] yes they can look into the word and see
[1:43:13] things that are not right that don't
[1:43:15] line up but instead of them lining up
[1:43:16] with the word they try to make the word
[1:43:18] conform to their belief
[1:43:21] and they begin to twist the word in all
[1:43:23] kinds of ways
[1:43:25] every denomination has some truth in it
[1:43:29] every false doctrine that surrounds this
[1:43:31] message has some truth in it
[1:43:34] but it's the part they get off on that's
[1:43:36] the part that produces
[1:43:38] death so they can say many things right
[1:43:44] but it's the part that's wrong that's
[1:43:45] the danger
[1:43:48] praise the lord lord have mercy
[1:43:52] on the saints he says but isaiah didn't
[1:43:55] want to do that after god had blessed
[1:43:58] him the way that he had
[1:43:59] and yet he didn't feel like like that he
[1:44:02] could
[1:44:02] that he would do that he didn't think
[1:44:04] god would do him like that it says he
[1:44:06] thought he was going he was going to go
[1:44:08] on
[1:44:08] do it anyhow because he felt he was
[1:44:11] secure
[1:44:12] but while he was it kind of it kind of
[1:44:14] made him feel
[1:44:15] angry at those men too that was telling
[1:44:18] him the word of the lord
[1:44:19] and when he did he rushed in anyhow and
[1:44:22] we find out
[1:44:23] that in his face come leprosy and he was
[1:44:26] a level until he died
[1:44:28] he had never he that he he had never
[1:44:31] could go to the house of the lord
[1:44:33] anymore no more
[1:44:34] he died a leper after he had seen the
[1:44:37] hand of god
[1:44:38] and how he had been so good to him and
[1:44:40] done the things he had
[1:44:42] yet that man died isolated a leper
[1:44:46] now weak he says now can we do that
[1:44:48] we've seen many things
[1:44:50] but don't you never think that we're so
[1:44:52] secure
[1:44:53] that god can't put judgment upon us
[1:44:59] but when you're under an illusion you're
[1:45:01] deceived
[1:45:03] isn't that right and when you're
[1:45:05] deceived
[1:45:06] this means deception means something
[1:45:11] that deceives or misleads intellectually
[1:45:18] whenever somebody gets off of the word
[1:45:20] of god they're being deceived or led
[1:45:23] astray
[1:45:24] intellectually in the mind
[1:45:27] satan working with those thoughts amen
[1:45:30] he studies the message how many realize
[1:45:32] satan is a scholar of the message
[1:45:35] how many realize that yes he just don't
[1:45:38] come in in many cases and just
[1:45:41] says something that's totally off the
[1:45:42] wall to some he does but to me
[1:45:45] he don't he'll he'll come right into the
[1:45:47] message as he did
[1:45:49] and he'll learn the lingo
[1:45:53] amen and then he begins to put together
[1:45:57] things in his own twists and turns
[1:45:59] amen this little dot the bible says
[1:46:01] doctrines of devils
[1:46:03] using the word of god using the message
[1:46:05] of god
[1:46:06] twist it up in his own way and hand it
[1:46:09] off to somebody that's willing to stop
[1:46:11] for a moment
[1:46:12] and entertain it first it comes in as a
[1:46:16] thought
[1:46:18] then it becomes a word then it becomes a
[1:46:21] doctrine then it becomes a movement
[1:46:25] what is it saints the tears are being
[1:46:27] bundled
[1:46:30] when god was in heaven saying do you
[1:46:32] realize he knew
[1:46:34] every movement of the devil he saw
[1:46:37] every he heard every conversation he had
[1:46:39] with every angel
[1:46:42] and he remained on his throne
[1:46:46] the devil was not far away talking to
[1:46:48] the angels he had them gathering
[1:46:49] together
[1:46:50] speaking against the lord amen him
[1:46:53] contrary to the program of god
[1:46:55] and god was sitting right on his throne
[1:46:57] heard every single word and didn't move
[1:47:02] you want to know why it had to happen
[1:47:05] you don't think god hear the
[1:47:06] conversations of the many that are out
[1:47:09] there
[1:47:09] that turn against his word even those
[1:47:12] that are still amongst the message
[1:47:14] churches that hadn't left yet but
[1:47:16] they're having conversations about it
[1:47:19] god knows about any bit of it
[1:47:22] and he sits and he he's allowing every
[1:47:24] bit of it to happen
[1:47:26] every angel that came that third part
[1:47:28] every one of them had to come out
[1:47:30] every one of them had to fall
[1:47:34] god was there in the garden of eden eve
[1:47:36] had to fall
[1:47:38] he could have stopped it why didn't he
[1:47:43] something had to play all the way out
[1:47:46] god allowed certain things to come in to
[1:47:49] capture the minds of men in certain ways
[1:47:51] like i said to bundle them together
[1:47:55] nathan and corey had the riser
[1:47:59] after the fact amen
[1:48:02] god saw he he saw the renown
[1:48:05] he saw them congregating together going
[1:48:08] around
[1:48:09] gaining influence and popularity amongst
[1:48:11] the people
[1:48:12] waited until they had more influence and
[1:48:15] waited until their influence came to a
[1:48:17] climax
[1:48:19] and everybody that was caught up in the
[1:48:21] men
[1:48:22] amen the devil came in and made them
[1:48:25] feel secure
[1:48:28] a false sense of security
[1:48:31] to rise up against god's prophet
[1:48:35] isn't that right to their own
[1:48:37] destruction
[1:48:43] they thought they had something but that
[1:48:46] evil spirit moved amongst that whole
[1:48:48] group
[1:48:49] and all of them came with a dark cloud
[1:48:51] over them
[1:48:53] in a spirit room and none of them could
[1:48:54] see the darkness
[1:48:56] they thought they were walking in the
[1:48:57] light that's right
[1:49:03] state of their case you ain't the only
[1:49:05] holy one
[1:49:07] god speaks to all of us
[1:49:12] moses said i never said i was the only
[1:49:14] one
[1:49:15] i know god deal with his people
[1:49:18] but because you're coming to me and the
[1:49:20] way you coming to me
[1:49:23] let's let's have this thing prove let's
[1:49:25] let let's let god
[1:49:26] judge this case
[1:49:30] let me know what showdown is coming
[1:49:34] right now people are saying all sorts of
[1:49:36] things boastfully
[1:49:38] under a false sense of security deceived
[1:49:43] when that leprosy rose up in his eyes
[1:49:45] forehead
[1:49:46] oh it took all the air to that brother
[1:49:50] his arrogance was gone he was like a
[1:49:52] little child
[1:49:56] here come paul galloping down to go and
[1:49:58] try to gather up more christians and
[1:50:00] persecute him and whatever
[1:50:02] when that light knocked him down he was
[1:50:04] like a feeble person
[1:50:07] amen no more strength than that brother
[1:50:09] no more strong words
[1:50:12] scrounging around for help i've been
[1:50:14] blinded
[1:50:16] yes y'all had to knock the confidence
[1:50:18] out of
[1:50:21] that's the that that won't be the case
[1:50:24] with
[1:50:26] they'll go right on that showdown going
[1:50:29] to come
[1:50:30] yes hey man that showdown at mount zion
[1:50:34] all right hey man it ain't gonna be it's
[1:50:37] not gonna be like god like
[1:50:38] like i told you so so it's just gonna be
[1:50:41] god manifesting his word
[1:50:44] in the way that he choose he chooses to
[1:50:47] and it's gonna be a final witness
[1:50:50] to those that god purposely see it
[1:50:55] then it'll be wrapped up right to be
[1:50:57] gone
[1:50:58] but right now god is letting everything
[1:51:01] take its course
[1:51:03] everything that's moving right now
[1:51:04] supposed to move in the exact way that
[1:51:06] is moving
[1:51:07] the devil has to come in and make people
[1:51:10] feel secure
[1:51:11] in their falseness in their sin in their
[1:51:15] in their deception
[1:51:19] because when that time comes that he
[1:51:21] that is filthy be filthy still
[1:51:24] let him that is righteous to be
[1:51:25] righteous still
[1:51:27] it'll be a wrap and we're approaching
[1:51:30] that time now
[1:51:32] i thank god thanks for helping us in the
[1:51:34] way that he has
[1:51:35] yes to help our eyes to be open how many
[1:51:39] how many are grateful for that
[1:51:41] amen allowing us not to be amongst the
[1:51:43] deceived number
[1:51:46] and that's because of predestination
[1:51:47] it's because of who you always were
[1:51:50] i had to come you had to come we came
[1:51:52] from different parts of the world
[1:51:53] different walks of life
[1:51:54] but yet we were always a part of the
[1:51:56] same body we were always kin folk
[1:51:58] amen amen we're just now coming to
[1:52:02] realize
[1:52:02] who our real brothers and sisters are
[1:52:06] it's not the blood brother or sister
[1:52:08] it's the body of christ
[1:52:11] the mystical body of christ
[1:52:16] me and brother jesse as he said i don't
[1:52:18] know he said it's been seven years it's
[1:52:20] been quite some time since i've been
[1:52:21] here
[1:52:23] i remember the idiot she used to run
[1:52:28] from
[1:52:30] uh but no matter how much time passes it
[1:52:35] don't matter
[1:52:36] you know what it's like it's so
[1:52:38] refreshing
[1:52:39] it's refreshing to be able to come in
[1:52:42] contact with another brother or sister
[1:52:45] amen in the faith that you can
[1:52:48] fellowship with with around
[1:52:50] the true unadulterated word that's able
[1:52:53] to accept christ as he
[1:52:54] is and not try to change him up
[1:52:58] until whatever kind of christ
[1:53:02] didn't paul said one come preaching
[1:53:04] another jesus
[1:53:06] in his day how was it another jesus
[1:53:10] it was the same word of god change
[1:53:13] twisted turn
[1:53:15] different perspective he said in history
[1:53:20] if somebody coming preaching another
[1:53:22] jesus he said i fear
[1:53:24] unless you might bear with him
[1:53:27] i'm going to realize this message is
[1:53:29] christ
[1:53:31] it's the revealed word isn't that right
[1:53:34] it's the revelation of the word of god
[1:53:36] so if one come preaching another
[1:53:38] message that's not the message that god
[1:53:42] sent
[1:53:45] amen yes paul told his saints i fear
[1:53:48] unless you might bear how you you might
[1:53:51] consider what they're saying
[1:53:54] don't go on those sites
[1:53:58] those sites that are out there people
[1:53:59] preaching against god's word don't you
[1:54:01] ever
[1:54:01] don't don't entertain that don't listen
[1:54:03] to it for a moment
[1:54:07] you're dealing with spirits
[1:54:11] as i listen to the to those that have
[1:54:13] turned away from the word
[1:54:15] and i hear how it happened they opened
[1:54:18] up they did the same thing
[1:54:20] eve did they listen to the serpent
[1:54:24] it's the hiss of the serpent
[1:54:28] you know when brother branham said if a
[1:54:30] bird ever if
[1:54:31] if a snake ever catches the eye of a
[1:54:34] bird
[1:54:36] he said he becomes hypnotized he becomes
[1:54:38] locked in
[1:54:41] so the less he begins to flap his rings
[1:54:43] real hard
[1:54:44] and break that trance
[1:54:47] and get away it'll stand there
[1:54:51] hypnotized trans locked in
[1:54:54] all the way until it gets into that
[1:54:56] serpent's mouth
[1:54:59] the devil wants you to go out there and
[1:55:01] try to listen to the things that are out
[1:55:03] there and whatever especially because he
[1:55:04] knows where you are
[1:55:06] people getting caught up they getting
[1:55:08] captured in their thoughts stay away
[1:55:10] from it
[1:55:11] praise the lord amen ain't no point in
[1:55:15] giving no entertainment to it when you
[1:55:16] know that you standing in the truth
[1:55:18] stay with that true feed upon the word
[1:55:19] of god
[1:55:21] and you go according to how god leads
[1:55:22] you if he needs you to see something
[1:55:24] whatever then that's him leading you but
[1:55:25] i'm just saying
[1:55:26] because we're dealing with spirits and
[1:55:28] how spirits enter into people
[1:55:29] you want to be careful with that you
[1:55:31] will have unnecessary mind battles
[1:55:37] because of the presentation see sitting
[1:55:39] is very slick he's a minister now
[1:55:41] the bible say he transforms himself into
[1:55:43] an angel of light
[1:55:44] and his ministers transform themselves
[1:55:46] into ministers of righteousness
[1:55:48] you don't think that thing exists
[1:55:50] amongst this message right
[1:55:52] that scripture exists now today
[1:55:56] satan's words is under the skies wolves
[1:55:59] and sheep's clothing
[1:56:06] doing what trying to give a false sense
[1:56:08] of security
[1:56:12] yes
[1:56:14] trying to make people conflicted and
[1:56:16] venturing off in their thoughts well
[1:56:18] i wonder if this is let me think let me
[1:56:21] look this up
[1:56:22] it's a devil leading
[1:56:27] yes praise the lord
[1:56:31] this is the reality of what we're
[1:56:33] dealing with this is the real war
[1:56:36] paul said when he fought he didn't fight
[1:56:38] as one that was beaten in the air he
[1:56:39] wasn't fighting against flesh and blood
[1:56:41] hidden things that ain't make no
[1:56:42] difference
[1:56:43] you ain't fighting people we fighting
[1:56:46] devils
[1:56:47] he said we're also not against flesh and
[1:56:49] blood right but against spiritual
[1:56:51] wickedness
[1:56:52] where in high places
[1:56:59] we realize that right i
[1:57:02] ain't never seen the devil in my life
[1:57:05] with my own eyes we lord did that for my
[1:57:09] grades out you know i don't know what
[1:57:12] i might not be ready to see
[1:57:16] brother brandon can look at him in all
[1:57:18] kind of forms and shapes and whatever
[1:57:20] and that brother's staying like a solid
[1:57:21] soldier boy
[1:57:23] and they might make me haul or something
[1:57:24] i don't know
[1:57:26] but the lord knows what we can bear amen
[1:57:29] even though i can't see it you can see
[1:57:31] it because you see it when it expresses
[1:57:33] itself through human flesh
[1:57:42] so you understand saints
[1:57:46] strange subject it just came to me in a
[1:57:49] certain way
[1:57:51] you know there's so many things more i
[1:57:52] can say but i'ma cut it off right here
[1:57:55] you know uh we're in a time of the
[1:57:56] pandemic
[1:57:58] i read an article just the other day
[1:58:01] where uh you know people getting such a
[1:58:05] uproar about the mask and whatever don't
[1:58:08] even really see they're trusting in god
[1:58:10] yes wear a mask
[1:58:13] don't let that be your your abs don't
[1:58:17] don't don't don't don't don't don't
[1:58:18] put too much emphasis in that because
[1:58:21] that ain't really helping nobody like
[1:58:23] that
[1:58:24] if god don't keep you you ain't gonna be
[1:58:25] kept that's right
[1:58:27] we follow the rules that are set before
[1:58:29] us but at the same time
[1:58:32] god is the one you know we've got
[1:58:35] testimonies saints have had covered and
[1:58:38] whatever and it's had no real effect
[1:58:40] upon them by the grace of god
[1:58:42] whether you wear a mask or don't wear a
[1:58:44] mask it's like
[1:58:46] it ain't really keeping you like that
[1:58:49] but the world that's all they got
[1:58:51] right these natural means of trying to
[1:58:53] keep themselves and protect themselves
[1:58:55] these natural ways
[1:58:57] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:58:58] why it's overemphasized to the point
[1:59:00] to where there was a um a business owner
[1:59:04] that wrote a letter uh to people that
[1:59:06] were protesting mass
[1:59:08] now i'm all for mass i wear them
[1:59:10] anywhere that i'm supposed to wear them
[1:59:11] and all that
[1:59:12] all right i don't go against the law of
[1:59:14] the rules or whatever i want to abide
[1:59:17] you know i just put my trust in god but
[1:59:20] anyway this business owner wrote a
[1:59:21] letter
[1:59:22] and they said to people that protest
[1:59:24] mass
[1:59:26] if you come into my establishment
[1:59:28] without a mask on
[1:59:31] i take that as a threat
[1:59:35] a threat against my life and i will
[1:59:38] respond
[1:59:39] accordingly
[1:59:42] they posted it on their business door
[1:59:45] i've seen people get into fights and all
[1:59:48] kind of stuff man
[1:59:50] what is it it's a false sense of
[1:59:51] security
[1:59:54] you know as people just don't trust in
[1:59:56] god so the devil got to give him a
[1:59:58] substitute
[2:00:00] hey man we're in a pandemic but this
[2:00:02] pandemic was supposed to happen
[2:00:04] how many realize that it's a plague
[2:00:08] it's something that god allowed to sweep
[2:00:10] upon the face of the earth
[2:00:12] it's because of the sins that's been
[2:00:15] prevailing in the earth
[2:00:16] amen they rejected god's prophet
[2:00:19] isn't that right they've rejected the
[2:00:21] word of god pus put christ
[2:00:23] out so now all these things are raining
[2:00:26] down by the hand of god
[2:00:28] and it's more to come not just to cover
[2:00:32] there's going to be worse things to come
[2:00:37] but i thank god that we are his people
[2:00:41] and that he's helped us to be able to
[2:00:42] gain a relationship with him
[2:00:44] to where we can trust him do everything
[2:00:47] you're supposed to do
[2:00:48] be law-abiding citizens be real examples
[2:00:51] to people
[2:00:52] but at the same time in your heart and
[2:00:54] in your mind you know god you're the
[2:00:56] only one that keeps me
[2:00:59] if you get it he'll bring you through it
[2:01:02] if you haven't gotten it you gotta trust
[2:01:03] and believe that you ain't gotta get it
[2:01:05] you ain't gotta get it just because it's
[2:01:06] here
[2:01:07] you ain't got to be a part of the
[2:01:08] statistics praise god
[2:01:12] but either way god got everything under
[2:01:13] control
[2:01:15] amen all is well to the bride amen god
[2:01:18] bless you saints i feel like i've
[2:01:20] taken up enough time i feel led to stop
[2:01:22] right here
[2:01:24] amen amen i thank god for you i thank
[2:01:28] god for being here
[2:01:30] um just keep me in prayer
[2:01:33] and we have service tomorrow i just want
[2:01:36] to be led of god
[2:01:38] so just pray for me and and i believe
[2:01:40] god will give us what we stand in need
[2:01:44] appreciate each one of you and let us
[2:01:46] all just stand together
[2:01:48] if anybody desires prayer
[2:01:52] amen you are more than welcome to come
[2:01:55] up
[2:01:56] or you can stay where you are because
[2:01:57] we're going to pray anyway
[2:01:59] and man faith can touch god from
[2:02:02] anywhere
[2:02:04] you come up here that your faith got to
[2:02:05] be here
[2:02:07] amen your faith got to be released to
[2:02:09] god
[2:02:10] because the hand of a minister can't do
[2:02:12] nothing if your faith is not there ain't
[2:02:14] nothing going to move
[2:02:16] when your faith is there things will
[2:02:17] start shaking
[2:02:19] amen so let's bow heavenly father
[2:02:23] oh lord
[2:02:28] very undeserving of anything that you do
[2:02:30] for us lord
[2:02:33] none of us are stand here and boast
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:39] make any boast in the flesh
[2:02:46] god we see our failures we see our
[2:02:48] frailties
[2:02:52] and i know for myself i'm disappointed
[2:02:54] in myself
[2:02:57] because i don't i don't feel that i'm
[2:02:59] giving you what you deserve
[2:03:02] so i pray that you'll be merciful to me
[2:03:04] lord god in that way and help me
[2:03:08] to die more to yield more to humble
[2:03:10] myself more to you
[2:03:13] this is not for a show ministering is
[2:03:17] not a competition
[2:03:20] a true minister of god in his heart all
[2:03:22] he wants is for your will to be done
[2:03:25] he wouldn't even do it unless you feel
[2:03:27] led to do it
[2:03:30] he's not trying to be popular he's not
[2:03:32] trying to do
[2:03:33] anything to get any glory to himself
[2:03:35] lord all he wants is your will to be
[2:03:40] done
[2:03:43] there are certain things lord god that's
[2:03:45] hard to master
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:48] certain things we feel ourselves saying
[2:03:50] lord we wouldn't say within ourselves
[2:03:55] but i find lord that within my own life
[2:03:58] father i can see
[2:04:00] and relate to many things your prophet
[2:04:02] said he said himself
[2:04:03] that many things that he says he said it
[2:04:06] against us all
[2:04:09] but it's you screaming out and crying
[2:04:11] out against certain things lord and
[2:04:13] that's a blessing just to be able to
[2:04:15] have that
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] so lord never let us get in your way
[2:04:21] these are your children lord you are the
[2:04:23] partner we are the clay you know exactly
[2:04:25] how to
[2:04:26] shape us and mold us
[2:04:30] we don't know you said in your word
[2:04:32] father that the clay can't look to the
[2:04:34] potter and say what make us that
[2:04:38] far be it from us lord god to have that
[2:04:41] mind father just have your way
[2:04:43] you know what's best
[2:04:46] we just want you to have your way
[2:04:50] it's a wonderful presence in here right

[2:04:53] these are your children lord
[2:04:57] they love you lord god you love us
[2:05:00] help us lord jesus we don't want to
[2:05:03] abide in anything that's wrong father we
[2:05:05] want to die
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:08] lord we're not bastard children father
[2:05:10] we receive correction
[2:05:12] [Music]
[2:05:14] we don't throw it away father god we
[2:05:17] don't shun it lord we accept it but we
[2:05:19] embrace it because you know better than
[2:05:21] us father
[2:05:22] we don't want our own way we don't want
[2:05:25] our own mind we don't want to have the
[2:05:27] mind of a devil lord
[2:05:28] leading us down wrong thoughts of
[2:05:31] understandings of your word father god
[2:05:33] we don't want that lord
[2:05:35] we don't know what's best for ourselves
[2:05:38] father god
[2:05:39] you know what's best you our father you
[2:05:41] want to be led lord
[2:05:43] continue to lead us your people father
[2:05:46] god you've been doing it all this time
[2:05:48] and we believe in
[2:05:49] trust you will continue to do it lord we
[2:05:51] don't want our trust to be in horses or
[2:05:53] chariots or any of men's ability father
[2:05:57] we want our trust to be in the lord our
[2:06:00] god
[2:06:03] our trust shall be in the lord
[2:06:08] and lord as we've read tonight there are
[2:06:09] many that are calling upon your name
[2:06:13] and you said those that call upon the
[2:06:15] name of the lord shall be saved but we
[2:06:17] realize the twist that was within your
[2:06:19] word
[2:06:24] our lives must match our confessions
[2:06:28] lord
[2:06:29] it's not enough to see you come and move
[2:06:31] in a powerful way
[2:06:32] to speak or to heal or deliver or to
[2:06:35] work a certain miracle of some sort
[2:06:37] that's not enough we can't be secure in
[2:06:39] that
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:40] we can't have security in seeing the
[2:06:43] works of god around
[2:06:45] us lord we gotta be able to see the work
[2:06:50] of god in us
[2:06:52] as you said in your word is you that
[2:06:54] that's here lord both to will and to do
[2:06:57] of your good pleasure
[2:06:58] your prophet taught us lord that the
[2:07:00] holy ghost is christ in you living his
[2:07:03] own life through you
[2:07:06] taking our thoughts bringing it in line
[2:07:08] lord taking our lives
[2:07:10] bringing it in line lord so we can have
[2:07:12] the same testimony
[2:07:13] as those as those in antioch father god
[2:07:16] they were called christians they didn't
[2:07:18] call themselves that
[2:07:21] it's because the life of christ your
[2:07:23] life was so
[2:07:24] dominating within their souls until
[2:07:27] their actions and their words and their
[2:07:29] characteristics
[2:07:31] were so much like you
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] and that was the world's testimony
[2:07:37] of what they saw in them
[2:07:40] it's not we proclaim ourselves to
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:45] those that had a false sense of security
[2:07:47] they made many proclamations
[2:07:51] catholic church lord she says that she's
[2:07:54] not a widow and shall see no sorrow
[2:07:58] oh god
[2:08:02] in the land of cna's lord you said in
[2:08:04] your word father
[2:08:05] and that's why you sent us our prophet
[2:08:07] in this hour to help to break that
[2:08:09] spirit off of us lord
[2:08:11] because the spirit of laodicea is to say
[2:08:13] i am rich and increased for goods and
[2:08:15] have need of nothing
[2:08:17] it's a false sense of security
[2:08:20] because in your words you said little do
[2:08:22] you know that you're a miserable blind
[2:08:24] naked and ratchet
[2:08:26] and don't know it blind
[2:08:30] [Applause]
[2:08:32] lord that's a spirit upon this age
[2:08:36] feel insecure where they shouldn't feel
[2:08:38] secure
[2:08:40] but all we can say is thank you lord
[2:08:43] thank you father for sending your angel
[2:08:46] to us
[2:08:47] come out of her my people be not
[2:08:50] partakers of her sins
[2:08:53] so you should not receive of her place
[2:08:57] thank you for calling us out of the
[2:08:59] systems lord calling us out of the world
[2:09:04] calling us unto yourself
[2:09:07] we're grateful jesus forgive us of our
[2:09:10] sins
[2:09:11] forgive us of our iniquities lord give
[2:09:15] us strength we pray continue straight
[2:09:17] father
[2:09:19] to be able to walk with you lord
[2:09:25] bless this assembly lord every every
[2:09:27] saint that's here even those that are
[2:09:28] not here lord

[2:09:43] word lord god and they're receiving that
[2:09:45] word father
[2:09:46] and that they're being nourished they're
[2:09:48] being made strong
[2:09:49] and healthy through the reception of
[2:09:51] your word
[2:09:52] father down into their souls lord god
[2:09:56] and the life of that word lord god is
[2:09:58] giving them all the
[2:10:00] all that they stand in need of all the
[2:10:02] the nutrients and
[2:10:04] the blessings of your word begins to
[2:10:06] flow through their minds and their
[2:10:08] hearts
[2:10:09] and every part of their body you're
[2:10:12] gaining full control over your bride
[2:10:14] father god
[2:10:15] you're gaining that preeminence lord
[2:10:17] that was your desire father god and it's
[2:10:19] happening it's been happening lord
[2:10:22] and all we can just say father is thank

[2:17:53] hallelujah i just want to share two
[2:17:55] thoughts you know i wrote these down
[2:17:56] we must be where the true sign of god's
[2:17:59] blessing is a life
[2:18:00] of righteousness amen not of iniquity
[2:18:03] remember we preach the series on the
[2:18:04] mystery of iniquity
[2:18:06] iniquity doesn't do the will of god
[2:18:09] iniquity is lawlessness
[2:18:12] and i wrote this down we know what a
[2:18:14] false sense of security is now
[2:18:17] but by grace a true sense of security is
[2:18:20] like paul
[2:18:21] he said i fought a good fight i've ran
[2:18:24] the race
[2:18:25] i know there's a crown of righteousness
[2:18:28] that awaits me i've done the will of god
[2:18:32] i've not lived in iniquity i have obeyed
[2:18:36] i've lived in christ's righteousness
[2:18:40] praise god what a what a true sense of
[2:18:43] security that is
[2:18:46] as he goes to martyrdom as he goes to
[2:18:48] beheading he says
[2:18:50] i know there's a crowd of righteousness
[2:18:52] i've got a real
[2:18:53] sense of security how many want a sense
[2:18:55] of security like that
[2:18:57] amen let's pray together heavenly father
[2:19:00] that's the kind of sense of security we
[2:19:01] want
[2:19:02] if anyone here has a false sense please
[2:19:04] correct us rebuke us now
[2:19:06] because you rebuke and chasten all that
[2:19:09] you love
[2:19:11] may we receive it lord as a child of god
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:18] because we want to get to the end of our
[2:19:20] road lord
[2:19:21] whether it's the rapture or the grave we
[2:19:23] want to say like paul said
[2:19:26] i've got a real sense of security

[2:19:48] lord help us
