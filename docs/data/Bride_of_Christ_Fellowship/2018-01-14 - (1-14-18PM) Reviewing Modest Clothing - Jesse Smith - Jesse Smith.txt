[Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take our Bibles that stand tonight I promise I'm gonna keep it shorter on the song end here amen let's go to first Timothy 2:9 I want to just review I just call this reviewing modest clothing I just want to review this like I said I've just been felt burdened to go this direction and write a book on it so we're working on that and like I said I gave about three hours to read this book yesterday morning really good book I really enjoyed it there's only 71 75 pages or something like that Wow I could read through a book in one day who knew trouble is I'm choosing to loan books I got two smaller shorter books I just got so enthralled in it and it was just saying everything I'm saying except we have the message to really light these things up like I said we have even more Scripture but they do it like I said a really good job on scripture first Timothy 2:9 and who here has watched my long dresses in the Bible vide who's watched it okay everybody okay most people okay answer who's watched my for guidelines for Bible modesty okay what's almost okay alright so I will go over that tonight by God's grace I appreciate I know Adam has been really expressing some thanks for the videos that really encouraged me brother thank you so much and I appreciate that and I hope they're a blessing I was thing about this morning like wow if anyone in the church ever moves in and they don't nothing about the message I've got 50 videos at each of them I could sit but I'd probably better to sit with them in a Bible study but it's like I can't get to it there's a lot of teaching there so we're grateful for that but the master teaching put your roots down amen and he said it makes you settled in the Word of God so we were grateful for God's settling power first Timothy 2:9 all right in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair now that means golden I've rooted up the Romans around the Romans have but gold things a grease in their hair there's some pictures of that and then also it meant expensive so they would pay a lot of money to make their hair bride it or something like that and some some people ask me does that mean you can't braid your hair no this means some type of expensive hairstyle or adding gold to it or something that the women would go above and beyond brother Graham said that too it's not a braided hair broided hair or of gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works and let's go to revelation 113 we'll just read that then we'll have you be seated by God's grace [Music] like I said we'll try try to do a Bible study on this and make it a nice short strong powerful shot amen nice inoculation tonight I'll just make it ah ha ha our quick shot of an octal a tion of God's love amen revelation 1:13 let's read that together 1 2 3 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girl even God has blessed see the Reavers work may be seated god bless you now you can switch over when you're ready let's look at modesty I pulled up this PowerPoint from 2015 and I use this on the videos as well I just gave ideas or just giving some basic ideas about how to cover the body and I think this is both I think both these bodies are man bodies that's why the woman looks just the bigger than you know they're supposed to be man bodies you know I apologize I don't mean to do that but just so you know this represents the Lord Jesus of the scripture we just read in a garment down to the feet and then you know we encourage sisters you know I'm going to show how if you least cover to the knees that's godly but we just feel like the Holy Spirit is calling us to cover more there's a lot of reasons behind that like if a sister bends over or if she sits a certain way if the skirt just goes past the knee then it exposes a little bit of the thigh so we just as we said in the video we just encourage sisters to and brothers to brothers to to wear as long as garments as possible praise God so this is from 2015 but I'm just going to pull out a few things I'm going to show you some other things some other visuals I mean what I mean by that so I got 15,000 five over five fifteen thousand five hundred words right now by God's grace I got intro chapter one two and three all done so I'm really excited I feel like he knows a man like I feel like I'm getting somewhere you know I feel feel good about that and I feel I was talking about John you know I said we're talking about this and I said even if it helps one soul it'll be a tremendous blessing but I know to help more than that and the reason I know that is because this mess is on fire around the world here it's dying because it's been this country has been harvested over and over and over and over to where there's not many there's not many left it's gleaning over here but it's on fire in China it's on fire in South America it's on fire other places too so that's where I see a lot of our videos get picked up and over overseas I got a lot of questions from overseas so a lot of testimonies from overseas and Bob ley South Africa different places I can't think of them all so I felt like if God Terry's God can use a teaching like this or videos or books or something like that to minister to the people who are hungry and thirsty for the Word of God do you remember how you felt when you first read the church age book things and remember how you felt and I was it was exciting every page I don't know you might remember oh man and it was just and so much understanding came especially on the Godhead the book of life water baptism it almost answered every question I had and that's what I want this to be I'm trying to pull quotes from other Branum scriptures I want to be something where people can go and find truth and that's why I want to be so I want to be the perfect will of God now modest has two definitions not revealing emphasizing the figure and dressing as to avoid indecency especially to avoid sexual attention now in the book I start off by showing and I got a little sorry this is this should be skipped out of here I start by showing as Christians we can prove the perfect will of God that's in Romans 12 verse 1 present your bodies a living sacrifice unto God proving the perfect will of God so we can that's what I want to emphasize in this book like we're not guessing people should dress this way this is God's perfect will this is what God requires and I want you to know there's two kinds of nakedness in the scripture and so let's read these here we're familiar with Genesis 2 and 3 where Adam and Eve sinned and they are completely naked there are no clothes on them at all but the Bible cause there's another kind of nakedness John 21 7 let's read that and then we'll read the other ones too I think there'll be a help to you I think they'll help you understand it a little bit better it's really helping me to review these things and I hope it be a blessing tonight John 21-7 remember this is after Jesus rose from the dead the disciples say ah Peter said I go fish it I'll just go back to my previous lifestyle you know to me he said there's a little quietness not quite sure what to do I'll just go back to fishing which you know Jesus worked with him Jesus you know eventually fill him with the Holy Ghost but nothing bad necessarily but Jesus was on the shore and he told the casting out on the other side and then he pulled up a multitude of fishes in verse 6 and verse 7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter it is the Lord now in Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he Girt his Fisher's Co unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea so this is a different nakedness the fishers coat was the outer garment so they must have had a special outer garment they wore when they went fishing but underneath every Jew wore a tunic underneath ok we'll go through that a little bit so when he the Bible said he was naked he wasn't completely naked he had that long shirt like tunic on and it was just a thinner layer of clothing ok but notice when he went to see the Lord what he do put on more clothes so nobody can say no this is a New Testament you know this is he's risen no you know they couldn't say oh well the high priests of the Old Testament that's just Old Testament you can't say that because now Christ the true high priest hey Corey there is an high priest the high priest of our profession amen now he's risen and Peter knows he's gonna meet the Lord he puts on more clothes amen so I think I think thank you so you can see that and I think that would help people see that when you approach the Lord you've got to be wholly covered you got to be covered the right way ok go to Saul in 1st Samuel 1924 and I know a lot of this is reviewed by church we need to review it I'll be honest when I met back I forgot a lot of this stuff just because I'm on preaching on other things you know I forget why do I and it was good reminder this is why I have my girls and when my girls and my son asked me questions I can answer them this is why we do it it's to please the Lord first add me on 1924 now remember saw a saw was trying to kill David so he sent messengers I think two times and they they started prophesying so Saul's like I'm going myself I'm gonna kill myself and then when he got there he got under that anointing and he started prophesying 1924 First Samuel 1924 and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in the like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saw also among the prophets now see this is the same idea with Peter he took off as an outer garment okay he wasn't completely naked from what I can see because that wouldn't make any sense why would God ask Aaron to put on clothes to come into his presence but then Saul can take off his clothes it just doesn't seem to make any sense so what happened is that same thing kind of like with David as we'll get to next let's go to 2nd samuel 6:14 david took off his outer kingly garments and then he just had on an ephod which was a long-sleeve shirt like garment that a priest would wear and it kind of covered the shoulders and it kind of went down I'm not sure how far it went down but it was worn on top of the undergarment second Samuel 6:14 some people say that David danced naked before the Lord and that's wrong that's a misunderstanding of the scripture first samuel was our second samuel 6:14 and David danced before the Lord with all of his might and David was girded with a linen ephod he fought again covers his shoulder has special shoulder coverings and then it's a long shirt I'm not sure how long but he was clothed he was leaping and dancing before the Lord and member Michael makes fun of him and then she gets barren because she made fun of a Holy Ghost person dance in the spirit that's fine just love if I feel free to dance you know how Olivia don't make fun of me because I want to worship Jesus amen that's how we we have such a Liberty and a joy in his presence in his presence is fullness of joy amen so see there's two kinds of nakedness the scripture says the first kind is just completely naked no clothes at all the second kind is you have just the under layer on which we would call like a underwear layer for ourselves it's under the outer garment and it's a tunic now I'm not gonna spend we're not gonna read all these but Christ owns us and we are here so he makes the clothing rules the Bible said we're bought with the price the precious blood of Jesus you are not your own right we are Christ and then I like how Jesus says why do you call me Lord and don't do the things that I say amen and I like this the Bible says all manner of holiness let's read that first Peter 1:15 first Peter 1:15 I'm gonna try that I said speed us up a little bit first Peter 1:15 I know this is a lot of review about I just want to emphasize some important thoughts now let's actually let's go up and read 14 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance we used to have former lusts and we used to fashion or conform our lives to our previous lusts and that's why we should have look at today is my life conforming more to worldly lusts or is my life becoming more dedicated to Christ am i crucifying the flesh more or am i feeding the flesh more that's what Peter saying we don't fashion we don't conform our lives to the world we can form our lives to Christ okay now verse 15 but as he which hath called you is holy so be holy in all manner of conversation now that means conversation conduct and behavior so that covers everything all matter of conversation that word conversation just not words it's behavior conduct standard of life it's everything so Peter says in every area of your life you must be holy which means you must be separate from the world can I let me inject a thought here let's go to 1st Corinthians 9 I just this was my chapter to read this morning I was so blessed I thought my I gotta share this with the church I just thought it meant a lot to me I just thought it meant a lot first Corinthians 9 now this chapter Paul tells the Corinthians he said look I have power to be married but I'm not I have power to work I'm sorry power to take tithes and offerings but I don't some people do I do I'm thankful I can do it by God's grace when I need it and thankfully I can give a lot too I'm very thankful for that by the grace of Lord but he talks about anyone who goes to war gets paid he doesn't go on offer nothing and then he says thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and does God care for oxen does God care for oxen yes does God care for those of you who are laboring for the gospel yes whatever you're doing God cares now look at verse 10 this is powerful or say if he it off together for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written can you believe that that was from Deuteronomy 22 Deuteronomy 22 is written for who New Testament believers isn't that striking the the Jewish mind reads that oh yeah I got to feed my ox when he's treading out the corn but God said Paul said he didn't write that for their sakes for the actual ox the physical ox he wrote it for us spiritual oxes they uh slavers in the gospel he wrote it for our sakes see that's why you can't make blanket statements like oh we don't under the Old Testament anymore we don't need that you can't make blanket statements like that you've got to see how does the Holy Spirit interpret the Word of God and you and you've whatever question is we've got to take that back to the word and is this something Jesus teaches Genesis to Revelation is this the law magnified look that closer examine closer so we can see the unseen things is this the law magnified so see I love that that is such a powerful statement this was written for our sakes not for theirs now you know the rest of it he says if I won't to me if I don't preach the gospel and then he says I make myself a servant all in verse 19 and then to the Jews I became as a Jew to them that are under law I kind of became as under the law to them without the law I became as without the law that he might gain them to the week he became weak he would became all things to all men that he might save some so whatever situation he was in he would try to use wisdom to win those souls he would try to think what does a weak person think like I've got a minister what does it you think about this how can I administer to the Jew is that how you feel if I'm talking to a an older dad or older grandpa would think how could a God give me wisdom how to minister to an older grandfather from a previous generation you know he was a he was born after World War two or something you know the baby boomers age give me wisdom for the baby boomers age or if I'm talking to millennial I want a lord give me wisdom to talk to millennial you see we need wisdom for whatever situation we're in now and then at this illustration I mentioned this morning verses 24 to 27 he talks about athletes how they must keep their body to bring it under subjection they must beat in other words they must go to the boxing ring every morning and beat up your body why because in verse 27 he says lest by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway do you see that if we don't make our body suffer it's possible we could be cast away because we would be living according to what the flesh and when you cater to the flesh when you sow to the flesh you reap to the flesh but when you sow to the spirit you reap to the spirit that's why I've got to make sure I watch how much sugar I eat I gotta make sure that I exercise too twice a week I've got to take care of this body I've got to make sure I fast a couple times a week or however much I feel that of the Lord our lives as we said as we said we shouldn't be conforming to Laodicea we should be conforming to Christ like Paul and I know it's did you ever notice this I notice in my Bible and then chapter 10 he says more were brethren I would not that he should be ignorant how that our fathers under the cloud and all passed through the sea and he goes through all this of Israel basically saying they didn't bring their flesh under subjection so they were cast away and you see that can you see that in Laodicea people that follow the messages they get excited bout the message if they don't keep their flesh under control what's gonna happen they're gonna strain because they're catering to their flesh more than the Holy Spirit so I saw that connection this morning and that was that really jumped off the pages to me I thought I gotta share that sometime today with the Saints I don't know when but I'm gonna sneak that in there somewhere Paul said if I don't beat myself up I could be cast away I could be lost because that's what Israel was right they did not inherit the promised land because they didn't have dedication they didn't have what do they call it's the word I'm looking for discipline they have discipline over their human bodies that's right amen all right now I just want to lay that in there all manner of holiness so we have to practice holiness we've got to starve ourselves sometimes I don't know I'm talking about you've got to literally starve yourself you've got a fast you've got to draw closer to God you got to make efforts to be more spiritual at times than just carnal because we're carnal way too much yeah that's why I've got to put myself through that rigor I've got to put myself through the fastenings I got to put myself through that to make sure I don't get worldly because remember we're being fashioned either way all right now like I said some of these have to go through but I was just showing how God's Word transcends all generations the Bible's the Word of God forever so on having Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm the Lord God I change not you know all these scriptures we can quote right off which is great we'd love to do that now Philippians 3:16 let's read that again and that goes along with the clothing standard it's kind of hot in here Malachi can you open that window buddy put the ends 316th it's better hot than cold better hot than cold I'd rather be preaching in here than out there right now yeah just all right Saints come on everybody sit real all sisters sit really close together all the brothers sit really close flippy in 3:16 nevertheless we're in 2 we have already attained let us walk by the same rule that it's mind the same thing that word rule and the Greek is the word canon and canada is what they call the scripture they call it the Canon and Canon is the carpenter's measuring tape let us all walk by the same measuring tape and brother BAM said we need a clothesline religion right we need to make sure we know what's on the clothesline what's going up there what kind of clothes are people wear you know we need to know is this long enough is this is this holy enough God has one standard to judge everything and that's his word that is the Canon so we are all walked by one standard and God gives us and this is what was revealed to me I was writing the book we have the same clothing standard from Genesis 3:21 to Revelation 22:20 honey the same standard God never changed it this is one of those it's like unchanging things you know about grace and all these things God always had Grace on Abraham and everything that's the Covenant you know all these things that go unchanging you know sin and holiness and all these things the clothing standard never changes all the way through it's so beautiful all right now what I want to do is what I did is Iowa you know I had an hour in there I kind of went through and highlighted in my my outline real quick I just want out what I'll do is I'll do this I just kind of want I'll just go through each chapter a little bit so you can see what's gonna be like by God's grace okay so actually I was in start with the introduction in the introduction I start with how I went to Verizon store when I got my new phone and the first question they asked me when I got in there was not about my phone the woman said our long dress is part of your religion I see all your daughter's wearing them and I was so excited I mean honestly my face I smell like praise God only had three dollars with nothing I'd care at the three youngest months I think three youngest ones and it's so bless me this is a woman you know she's a black woman had hair done she must have straightened her hair is really long and curly and she had such respect she was so polite for me I thought thank you for asking me that and the girls were there I just started talking about Jesus all the even more after that it just opened up a great conversation I said no but I said I'm sorry yes it is Deuteronomy 22:5 says we don't wear the same garments men and women and it opened up a great conversation about how many kids we had and raising kids and how the Bible teaches us to raise our kids it was really special but I just admired I admired this woman out of her she's probably a sinner you know I mean but I admired her because she was so respectful and I said later she had the courage to ask me about clothing most people don't which I'm the same way that's what I put an introduction I'm nervous I'm timid I don't ask people their religious beliefs you know unless I feel really moved by the Holy Spirit so I so admired that woman and and I brought off the others thought from Romans 2:4 let's go there just so you can read it again I'd like you to read us to keep these things in your heart how many know if you hear it on Sunday sometimes you hear in your heart throughout the week oh I heard just heard the preacher preached at Romans 2:4 just and this is what I thought I just thought about this scripture or that despiseth out of the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leads us to repentance and in my heart I thought boy this this woman really wants to know she's so kind she really wants to note I thought God give me mercy to show it with goodness let me show how your goodness is what makes us put on more clothes it's your goodness because without him we're shameful we're naked but when God tells us how to dress and we it'll be God's goodness O God is going to cover us God's gonna get all the attention off us who we can't save anybody he's gonna use our clothes to get the attention off of us to point to God amen it is the goodness of God that'll lead us to repentance it's God goodness that'll cover our old tattoos that we used to get or you take out our piercings that we used to have or you know it's God's goodness that will do it because it it takes away the attention off us it is a life that's sanctified to Christ it's a life that fully points to Jesus amen now chapter one I kind of go like this I kind of start with the Word of God is the foundation of this book in our lives and spend up quite a few words on that and then God requires holiness just trying to think of any kind of highlighted things that might think might have helped you I already covered that and then going how do we become holy through obedience repentance and the preaching of the word legalism or love and I just want to say that again remember legalism is excessive adherence to the law or the word so if you add something on to the word now you're legalist okay so that's that's how you know what legalism because the example was in Paul Paul tried to inject Paul notice that the Jewish teachers were trying to inject circumcision back into the law and it wasn't required for Gentiles and so the Bible called it legalism and the Paul said that you have left grace because you've gone back to the law okay so we don't want to do that but what the Bible says we have to say now let's go to proverbs 35 and 6 but if it's been a while since you read this I think you'll be happy to read us proverbs 35 and 6 and I appreciate everybody being patient with me I know a lot of these things are familiar but but let's just enjoy them if we can like I said let's take an inoculation remember these things every word of God is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not to his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar look God is gonna call all these people on the day of judgment if they don't repent God's gonna call them liars now remember the false do we looked at this morning the false Jews says their original holy gospel Christian and they're lying so at some point where do they do they might add or take away from the Word of God and a lot of churches do it with clothing they they take away the clothing or they take away the requirements for clothing that's what most churches do I don't know many that add clothing do you like you gotta wear it now I guess I guess the women that wear the hats maybe I'm sorry the caps rather caps what is it done okay yeah yeah make it legalism yeah yeah yeah where they make it yeah had only yeah right so if they say you have to do that to be saved now they just added another line there like we say if you are saved you'll do what God says to do because you you do works because you are saved you'll find the truth if you are saved that's right so I don't want God to call me a liar I just want to say what the Bible says in regards to modesty so it's not legalism because I'm not we're not teaching anything excessive it's love now that we show our holiness is beautiful I think a few paragraphs on that the Bible said worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness now remember that holiness is all manner of conduct life everything dress everything worship in the beauty of holiness now I pointed out here let me see what I pointed out oh did you know this go to John 14 31 I've been so surprised by this John 14 31 now I think we all know it but I hadn't seen it in scripture in a while John 14 31 let's go there who'd like to read that for me John 14:30 Adam okay thank you whatever you ready amen it been so long since I read that Jesus said I love the father so Jesus he kept every command right how do you keep every command by love it wasn't a legalist like oh this is extra it was I'm gonna keep everything the father said because I love him that was just fresh to me I hadn't seen in a while so Jesus is the very epitome of beauty because of his care because he had no physical beauty that we would desire him but it was his character his beautiful character and that was based upon obedience by love now the next section we go through the two terms modesty and holiness but I think those are pretty familiar to us modesty we went over that not drawing attention yourself holiness means purification separation from the world the beginning of modest : let's go to Genesis 3:7 just to remind us here how am i doing I got 20 minutes well maybe I better I'll probably go a little bit faster then we can go back I thought about keep preaching a whole series on modesty and going a little slower through this so I may do that we'll see but but just I spend all my time on this yesterday so I've got to preach it that's what's fresh to me right now so pardon me Genesis 3:7 okay man okay how about Genesis 3:7 sir okay aprons in the Hebrew is loin covering so it's like a bikini bottom I could say like that I don't know what else to say oh it's like a towel wrapped around your private parts that's all was so when they hid behind the bush they just covered their loins that's all they covered I don't know if he was going like this for upper-body I don't know but it's a loins are only the reproductive area so the first people to dress immodest where Adam and Eve right and then God came in verse 21 we like to read that verse 21 Lydia okay so God comes and gave them the coats of skin now coats let me go to that I forget the actual word let me go to that coats so here's Adam and Eve Eric could add me just covers something like this a loin covering okay it was the reproductive parts the air around the hips that was a nakedness that God covers with coats of skins I think the shoulder should be covered too now so I got and I got or doctored on that I got more scripture so coats means a long shirt like garments I've tried to grow an understanding in the last two years because even though this is history I might not get to but the American women when they first started going to the beaches they wore dresses past their knees and then long-sleeve shirts long sleeve and as the 1800s went on in 1900 it went like this it was like a slow to wear now they can wear hardly anything I don't even like saying the terms you know like I don't even like saying it but that is literal history and the gentleman is so just it's it's so shocking they go like this just slowly inch by inches said every season every new swimming season they took off a few more inches inch by inch so from 18 I think it was 1890 they said when they first took up the sleeves from 1890 to 1960 they went from this all the way to almost nothing 70 years can you imagine that 70 years and you could in 70 years Satan could strip almost every woman in America almost and isn't this is that sad at one time I heard a preacher say he said how can a woman get out there in a bikini and stand out in front of all these people and yet let it yeah if you took that same woman put her in her house and a stranger walked in and she was in her underwear she would be all covered up you see the hypocrisy in that I thought boy what a striking thought that is is that true like a woman if stranger was in there she didn't know it she'd cover up she'd go get her robe on and cover up but yet outside at the beach she's letting every man look at every part of her form that's called a demon of deception a demon of lust and a demon of deception you're blind and literally naked and you don't even know it spiritually and physically so I just thought I'd show that now these are the areas in the Bible there's different body parts oh I forgot legs yeah I'm sorry members my picture I must got the wrong one sorry I'm my fault there on that one oh I must add a different one yeah this sweat mint is that okay is that okay there's nothing bad on there is it okay all right if you and in the book it was real to me I was writing the book in Daniel to God gives us a breakdown of the five parts of the body with the image it was so it was striking like oh there it is God divides a man into five parts so head I don't have head up your heads the other part a head I would say the collarbone so and then this will be the porosity the shoulders are included in the breast okay so this would be the breast I've got to move my lines up a little bit gonna move my standard up because I didn't have any scripture at that time I didn't understand now my wife and I we always cover our shoulders you never see me walk around with no shirt on you don't do that stuff so head one breast - belly three loins for thighs but I said five or six there must be six I said five must be six yeah there must be soon or no I'm sorry the belly and loins was one on the the statue of Daniel I think right no I don't know how to look it up I'm sorry anyways you understand all the body parts must be covered I think it's five forgive me maybe it was breast in the belly that's gonna bug me so forgive me okay anyways so God chose to cover the entire body okay now I'm quickly moved here so I show the beginning of a modest clothing in Genesis 3 and then I jumped to the days of Noah how they were sexy dress women and how that spirit is on people today I do because Jesus prophesied I just talked about how lust is such a temptation for people to marry outside the faith our spiritual eyes should see that the daughters of men are drawing away sons of God today just by physical outward attraction and the cause for em modesty is demon powers demon possession will cause people to take clothes off demon possession I can't it's hard to imagine but I was so possessed with demons when I was in high school I take off my shirt in front of everybody I'd swim in front of everybody and my wife and I could say the same on that you know we just swear you just what was it two possessed with demons yeah not frothing at the mouth but religious demons and that is the worst kind is that right Church and then the dangers are to dangers I've seen it in modesty the first one is you're guilty of causing others to stumble and you will go you'll answer to Christ for that because the Bible said you sin against Christ when you cause people to stumble so a woman or man that presents himself and people lust after them they're guilty they've sinned against Christ and have to answer for that the second one is your taking captive to the will of evil spirits so you get addicted to it right the so many women addicted to immoral clothing so you get addicted to the spirit of immodesty okay and then I never told this story can I tell you a little story from my life I put this story in here at the end okay I was eight years old so bear with me I'm in second grade acacia how are you eight okay sounds acacia sage I was living in Delta which is a small farm town we moved to Liberty center my second grade year and I start making friendships well over the winter I think it was in the winter we moved and so in the spring of that year I went to my friend's house and I'll never forget it this same set number that we are indication when I think we're eating like a snack before bed and his brother has a teeth his brother's a teenager you put MTV on at the top of it the TV was up there and we watched MTV and I saw videos I had never seen in my life before and I was literally under like this other class I never saw women dance like that I never saw clothes like that and I could not get those pictures out of my mind I went home and it wasn't just a week or two later and never anyone ever used to watch The Cosby Show Neverland okay we watched it religiously we were religious we're religious in some wrong ways too but every Thursday night I think was Cosby night I don't know if that was right night it's Tuesday or Thursday and I never miss Cosby night but after that after seeing that MTV ice cosby night my entire family was watching cosby and i was in the room and I was drawing bikini dressed women on baseball cards because when I was younger that's all I loved was baseball cards so I mixed the spirit of lust that I saw there with the only thing I knew was baseball cards and church in the middle of Cosme my mom walks in and said Jessie what are you doing and I was caught red-handed and there's this new church I'm eight years old and I've already got the spirit of lust on me eight years old just by seeing women dance and were showing their bellies and that was in the early 90s and that wasn't as bad as it is now and that spirit of lust stayed on me for years for years that's all I could think about and my mom didn't embarrass me she took the cards away but I kept thinking about it introduced me into pornography on the Internet I got addicted to that and it stayed over to college I would go to college and you could check out laptops the University of Akron I remember that brother bang or not and you could go study anywhere in the well I would go in there and I would you know do tobacco to tobacco and I'd go on pornography sites and then try to get a little bit of homework done it was awful and then when I came this message this message sent me free and I've not gone back so that maybe was 2002 or 2003 I haven't been attracted to any of that because of all the preaching praying see if we want to get delivered by BAM said you got to dig out if you want to be if you were to be empty nice that you got to dig out or or empty up so you can go up hey man you gotta unpack so you can go up praise God and so because all the preaching and all these things I've never gone back to that and God did it before I got married which I'm so thankful because I've seen I've talked to couples where pornography and I just talked about it over in Iowa where pornography is destroying marriages and I'm so thankful Jesus Christ deliver me but I want to show this in the book that had happened at eight years old the spirit of lust jumped on me and God finally delivered me when I'm 22 or 23 by the grace of God so that's the second danger being taken captive I was taken captive by the devil at his will because I yielded to his will never understand that all right so I show all the scriptures for that okay there's the conclusion chapter one nope that's done it that's what I'm working on right now I better I got 10 minutes here just bear with me is that story helpful for children keep our parents keep your children away as far as possibly you can or your nieces or nephews keep them as far away from even seeing that as possible now chapter two I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this I think I'll preach I think bang and bow we're here when I preached a message I call this chapter how to apply Old Testament scripture to the New Testament so before I can prove to everyone or whoever reads this book before I can prove that all these Old Testament Scriptures help us learn how to dress they have to know that you can use Old Testament scripture at times to develop New Testament doctrine so my wife I was talking to wife and she said you know I don't encourage you to put that before you actually teach on clothes I thought okay I like that that's a good idea so I was showing how scripture asks the Old Testament scripture has to be rightly divided like ceremonial laws for the priests are no longer the fact but they're still types and shadows and we can go through laws that are not in effect but there are many more laws that are still in effect there's allegorical truths you know the allegory of the bond the bond son or the I'm sorry the bond woman and the free woman that's the allegory of the law and grace so there's allegories we can learn from and then there's direct direct prophecy from the Old Testament that we must learn from now skipping ahead also there's this principle of you must have two or three witnesses to prety doctrine you can't just pull one scripture you got to have two or three witnesses from the scripture right every word must be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses and then I show how we're not under the law we're not under the law but we must the Bible says we must fulfill the righteousness of the law let me know that Romans 8 for we the laws righteous and through the holy spirit we fulfill the righteousness in other words we do what is holy by the leadership of the Holy Spirit not by our own efforts anymore it's not it's not me it's Christ in me the hope of glory there's no longer Jessie that lives there's no longer Paul that lives it's Christ that lives within me praise God I live by the faith of Jesus Christ and I covered the blanket statements I mentioned that earlier how you can own but I do sure you can make blanket statements like no person was baptized in title sponsor Holy Ghost God never asks one woman to cut her hair I never caught himself three persons God never caught a woman to be apostle the pastas never asked anybody to invite Jesus into their heart all these blanket statements that we can make that are true and then I close the chapter with abominations all these abominations are still abominations in the New Testament there's justifying sin homosexuality idolatry sacrificing children witchcraft cross-dressing worshiping with a wicked heart diverse weights and measure which is extortion and seven abominations of proverbs this is six I preached a whole sermon on that before so I'm gonna skip past that I know to everybody take a deep breath ready wake up I'm sorry if I put you to sleep I don't mean it I'm just trying to show you what I've done and then Jesus said I come to magnify the law so I showed that thought and then I brought the conclusion okay that's chapter two that was five thousand words okay chapter three let's go back to the slideshow so chapter three I just show these things right here there's four guidelines for modest clothing and this was revealed to me as I studied the first one has cover all areas of nakedness and that was remember we divided the human into five parts we must cover from I say the collarbone and shoulders cover down as far as we can go as far as we can go like I told my wife I'm never gonna ask you to wear more modest clothes than what I wear because I gotta be the leader I've got to be the example and I'm always covering my body as much as I can I'm never gonna ask her to do something I'm not willing to do because that might look like a hypocrite so that's applies to me too the second thing is what wear one layer of thick clothing or multiple layers of thinner clothing and this is seen of the coats the coats of Genesis 3:21 what animal did God probably sacrifice who knows would a sheep or a lamb and have you ever seen lamb skin boots they're really thick lansky lamb skin is not thin its thick so if Adam Eve only had one layer on it was a thick layer and you were not as seen their form you know we went out to see their clothes when other words were loose you know they you would not have been able to see the full outline of their body but the but later as we wore as go to the New Testament reading they always had an undergarment and an outer garment and then even a girdle on top of that like a belt they had a belt on top of the outer garment as well so they could gird up the loins and that's what that's what the Almanac says the Almanac says the Jewish women their clothes dragged against the ground and it was so long that when they need to do work or move around they would take the bottom of their robe and tuck it into their girl like that but they were still covering up almost everything that's how long their skirts were that's interesting I thought wow that's really good the third thing is something we all believe gender specific clothing men wear men's clothes women wear women's clothing I got a whole lot more on that I don't have time to show and then the last thing is actually loose and flowing clothing but I just put it like this on the video we need to wear clothes like Jesus's heavenly garments so those are four easy guidelines how many think they could remember those if somebody asked him I think you can remember you can remember four points about this or four points about that you can remember four points about God's clothes or point people to the this chapter let me close with this let's see make sure I got everything that I wanted to do for today okay with the shoulders I want to make sure I say about the shoulders I feel kind of corrected on that because the tunic was a t-shirt like garment so that would have covered a t-shirt of course would cover the shoulders and then the high priests always cover the shoulders they had a robe on and then the ephod the ephod was a special garment on top of their other garment and it literally says to cover the shoulders and memmer they even had to wear breeches so that these big long robes and under that they had to wear shorts that went down to their knees or breeches so when they walked up the ladder or since they ladder the steps to the goat or the brazen altar nobody could see under their skirts I was there under their robes which were called skirts so I'd cover their nakedness here and he also covered any nakedness here that's the point I'm trying to make if he had to cover his loins and up or his thighs enough and his shoulders then we know we should cover that today as well and of course here's another thing there's no scripture that says we can expose our shoulders and if there is please show to me I have not found one there's 75 bible scriptures on shoulders not one of them ever shows a person with their shoulders uncovered and God says that's good there's nothing so there's no witnesses for shoulders being exposed okay just so everybody knows all right okay some of these are pretty important go to Jeremiah 13 22 let's read it hope you're being blessed tonight amen hope you hope it's okay I'm gonna try to finish here like I said maybe go a few minutes over five okay just a few Jeremiah 13 22 now this is interesting we don't believe that you know if a woman shows her heels she's naked but I think in the context of this you'll understand what I'm talking about if thou saying that heart wherefore come these things upon me or the greatness of thy Nick what are thy skirts uncovered and thy heels made bare so some people have said oh if a woman shows her heels its nakedness why don't necessarily believe that but I think what it's saying is that when you uncover the skirt that means to take off it actually means to take off the robe so God was pulling back their shame and so along with that you would see not only the the legs but also the heels down to the heels because the Bible said women must wash each other's feet so it can't be sin to show heels if you're washing somebody's feet because you got to take their shoe off okay so but that's just an interesting scripture I saw one Almanac that said you know some women think they she even cover their heels but we know we can understand what it says we never see God anywhere else asking any one or all of us to cover our heels and also think about Jesus Jesus wash his disciples feet I mean the heels were right there so it's you have to take this in in context okay Isaiah 47 let's go there Isaiah 47 I just want to know that was in the Bible that shocked me I've never seen that before I was like wow interesting but we know it feet washing we'd have to show the feet or the heels Isaiah 47 this is where we believe we this is Bible proof you cannot show your thigh you cannot wear a miniskirt and show your thigh or wear shorts and show your thigh and say you're covered by you're covered know when you're soon as you show anything above your knees it's the nakedness and that's the scripture okay the virgin daughter daughter of Babylon verse 2 she's under judgment take the millstones and grind me I'll uncover thy locks make bear thy leg see uncover the thigh pass over the rivers eye nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen I will take vengeance and I would not meet thee as a man face of God's bringing judgment upon this woman and he says he says you're not to make bear the leg and uncover the thigh all right does that help by God's grace anytime you show the thigh and that's this is why I feel like we should cover much of the leg because the leg is not the same as the thigh the leg is from the knee down that's the leg so we got to be careful how much other leg we show like I said if someone what if her sister walks in here and her skirt goes past her knee praise the Lord but you better be careful very careful when you sit down or if you bend down in the back sometimes it exposes your legs and you don't want to cause anybody to stumble now I believe this too if you're not trying to have caused somebody to stumble and you cover yourself let's say you cover all the way if a man wants to lust after you there's nothing you can do but because the Bible says into the pure all things are pure if your heart is pure it's not on you if somebody lusts after you if you covered yourself fully because the Bible said God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked amen the heart if you are doing your our God will do his part you can't if somebody wants a lust they're just going to lust but we've got to be careful not to give them a asian of stumbling all right now here's something to uncover thy locks the nakedness so there's something with hair that I don't even understand yet and I'm off to like with broided hair I don't understand everything okay but I know there was ways that people could present their hair if they were royalty or if they were rich there's ways they could present their hair and there would not be godly especially if there was a lot of money or time to kind of make their hair look fancy in other words it was a spirit of pride that's what I'm trying to say there's a lot of pride involved there and even with the issue of a veil I just wanted has ever never studied that in the scripture when Tamar dressed like a harlot remembering what she did she put on a veil which is interesting because earlier in the book of Genesis Rebecca went to see Isaac and when she saw Isaac she put on a veil so there must have been some veils that pertain to harlots and some veils that pertain to virgins I don't know I'm just saying we've got to be yeah this is what I'm saying - we've got to grow to understand some of these things as well do I think we're covered now fully yes but there's going to be questions come up because I get them all the time on YouTube there's any questions that we don't have answers for so the thing to do is just say I don't know we'll take it back to the word and we'll rightly divide the word okay I just want you to know there's even though with the locks I don't I don't understand that right now but I know the Bible said her hair is given her for a covering we know that I just don't understand everything yes and I don't know if I will understand everything ty gets a new body so by the God's grace okay so the rest of the chapter I devote to the four kinds of clothing I'm trying to finish your bear with me okay so at the just list these clothes are not acceptable to God miniskirts women in pants sundresses because they're too short and they love times they show the shoulders high slit skirts low-cut dresses shorts short shorts skinny jeans halter or tube tops sheer blouses and every kind of swimsuit almost every kind of swimsuit in bikini that make it pretty clear alright last thing let me show you these pictures I was really really blown away now just so you know women have women and men have voice had separate garments there's George Washington and there's Martha men and women always wear suffer garments always I can show that next time we teach on this I can show all the way from I think it's 2,000 BC before Christ I can show you pictures or murals men and women always dust your dress different all the way down to today and now today's only time work now we can dress however we want no you can't its babble its confusion it's a state of confusion so see there's always been standards and I just pull these up from Martha Washington today I made this a few years ago there's Marcia Washington look how much she covered of herself around the 1920s the flappers what they do they start wearing short skirts they cut their hair and start wearing makeup I started wearing high heels the 1920s just brought such a huge degradation to our country it was awful and then the seventies brought about women and I'm sorry 60s brought about women in pants okay okay oh yeah George and Martha Kent okay now the book that I read if you'd like to copy this I could buy your copy I think it's fantastic it examines modesty through the changes in swimwear did you know bathing suits started in 350 BC with the Greeks and they would they would bathe naked but they started with costumes then they got to naked and maokai and lydia show me this when they studied rome when we did world history at home they showed me how romans always bathe naked all their athletes would perform naked can you imagine that look at those women the tennis women look at the track-and-field men and women they're almost back to where they started and that's where it started in ancient Greece and ancient Rome that spirit of sports and everything like that and now it disappeared for years and then it reappeared in the 1700s in England and Sicily was the place where they first saw bikinis Sicily that's what the history says but in the 1800's it started getting popular to go to the beaches and at first there are strict segregation women on this side men on this side then that standard came down when that center came down they started introducing garments for athletic movement so they want to be more active they want to they want to play games and beach volleyball yeah this isn't that late 1800s church and then law started to change to allow in modesty on beaches because if at first it was indecent exposure on the beach but then they said well if they're exercised and it's okay and that's that see the double standard their Beach is no longer we're considered a place for indecent exposure and then from the 1890s is when the short the long sleeves for women started coming up inch by inch and then if you fast-forward 70 years it's shortening the sleeves all the way to a bikini that barely today barely has any material to it now here's the picture and this is a the two policemen arresting this woman in this woman look they got short shorts on that was their swimming gear I covered this one because it was kind of a bad shot you know kind of like on the back side and I thought that's the the cop has to physically throw her into the paddy wagon for indecent exposure she they weren't on the beach this is out this is out not on the beach so they must I don't know if they took it off once they got to the beach I don't know but they got arrested in 1922 in Chicago it's fact for wearing short shorts and I have history to where a woman could have been killed in the 1600s for wearing pants in England she could have been killed the death penalty was involved now I don't think we should go back to the death penalty but I do think we should go back to fines I do think we should do that and here's the last picture of us in our feet and then as they started relaxed look now she can wear a tank top and now they measure this sign was from 30s thus the bottom of the the the swimwear had to be had to be less than six inches from the knee see how they just slowly inch by inch and they hired they these are these are called beach officials it used to be some old man's job to measure swimsuits can you believe that as a 1930s and think about how the revival there's no more revival in America I mean look how it happened slowly so that's why we've got to watch our lives what's it been 50 53 years since the Prophet left the scene we've got to watch our lives what will it be like if God Terry's 70 years after the Prophet left the scene what will it be like we have transgender homosexual on the rise what will it be like in a few more years it's shocking to think about it it's shocking but as we know we're the generation praise God we're the generation that lives the Word of God were the examples you are the light of the world praise God hope this was a blessing than I did enjoy it I didn't get to everything that I mean there they this guy goes through the nineteen hundreds every ten years he shows how history pulls history how they just kept going up further and further further and further further it's powerful I mean I I was just like drawn in this and there's so many more things I didn't get to but Lord willing we'll get maybes next Sunday night so hope you love the Lord tonight hope it's a nice refresher like I said if you have any questions feel free to email me I guess I don't have every answer I think as we as we search the Scriptures and we apply all these rules that we have the rules of in the mouth of two or three witnesses the rules of rightly dividing the word looking for two or three witnesses I think as we apply those rules I think we'll find that that God His Word is true his standard for clothing is unchanging Amen I think we'll find that standard by God's grace that's just bow our heads and prayer Heavenly Father thank you for this time lord I went a few minutes over Lord and thank you Lord that the people were patient with me bless them for their patience I hope something was said tonight that helped them order not thank you how you're helping me grow Lord and my understanding or as I read through these things with the shoulders Lord and the history or the shocking history how people used to care the majority of Americans used to care about modesty lord help us today to care about modesty help us to care about holiness help us to care Lord about our our outward appearance Lord and everything we do will point others to Christ and not just our sisters we know our sisters nor they're easily noticeable more than men dear God but then our brothers have such a reverence lord I might say like this a sobriety they're so sober they're so serious they're so aware of your presence through dear God that people will see this kind of Christian character on us our clothes speak holiness but our character speaks holiness help us Jesus tonight Lord help us in our homes Lord to keep not as clothing as much as possible help these children to as they grow to see the truth and have answers for their questions the Lord you've divided the body in such a way Lord God and you bought our bodies so if you divide it and tell us to cover that and leave it unchanged throughout the entire Bible Lord will obey that just like Jesus said I love the father we love you Father and we're going to keep your commands use this Lord God may you give me strength to finish Lord God I could finish soon and get this to be a product Lord ER and encouragement a resource to the people of God is something I'm about something lorded I never knew it was part of the restoration of this hour and Arnon blessed us tonight Lord as we sing a few songs and go our way Lord God prepares for Wednesday Lord God help us Lord just keep feasting on the word help us to listen to a tape Lord tomorrow and this another prophet read our Bibles more god help us to stay in the channel being taught by the Holy Spirit may we hear that voice urging us your voice [Music] thank you that we all can hear your voice tonight speaking to us through your word it was grace Lord to obey all these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the Lord let's go around flaws I said am as much time to prepare as I like to so far me but I try to get as much done as I could and I love questions like I said if you have a question let me know we happy to do that answer any question let's sing when I look into your holiness praise God [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] one of the important parts like trying to close at this all the saints and white robes have these robes that Jesus have on they go down to their feet so if we're gonna spend eternity covering all of our body why don't we start right now by God's grace I didn't think that's so beautiful if Jesus dresses modestly if Jesus doesn't go around showing off his big muscles and his toned thighs then why should we we shouldn't he's the example and let let it be done on earth as it is in heaven praise the Lord now how many Muslim would know most of all most of us don't need help with modest clothing we need help with a modest mindset help me not to do my will help me to have humility help me not to draw attention to myself how many would say amen to that I appreciate look out if you look around everybody's dressed modestly oh it's so fantastic I love it praise God I love coming here because I know my eyes are gonna be safe hey I just love it thank God for that but I think if we're honest as we go let's just pray this lord help me to have a modest spirit which means we think little of ourselves right and we don't draw attention to ourselves we only point others to Jesus Christ let's pray that as we go how many would say pray for me brother Jes for that that's my prayer father in heaven as were dismissed we're grateful bless your people for their hunger for the word their dedication to the word oh I love it Lord I'm so blessed to see their souls love your word I could never get enough of your word your God it's so glorious has changed my life delivered me from pornography when the other churches couldn't do it because they were preaching the word of the hour thank you lord I can see how my life was tainted by the spirit of lust through an honest evil Lord Yury need me you brought me back and now Lord you're using me and my wife and my children as vessels examples of Jesus I don't want to come before you naked physically or spiritually in orders we are closing your father as I said you saw the hands Bob give us honesty in our spirits which is not thinking very much of ourselves when we think about our brothers and sisters within ourselves we think about our neighbor or than we think about ourselves we think about Christ so much we just want to obey everything he says we want to pray all the time talk to Jesus give us that kind of hosting [Music] in greater rided upon our souls right now Jesus right that meek and quiet spirit for our sisters and that strong loving leadership of brothers ride it upon our hearts are fresh let us grow in these areas more than character thinking that we can all grow together we can all learn together pray for strength from this week should you tarry to protect us and I divine nail-scarred and protect us Lord because we're in the palm Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll stay no longer with you [Music]
