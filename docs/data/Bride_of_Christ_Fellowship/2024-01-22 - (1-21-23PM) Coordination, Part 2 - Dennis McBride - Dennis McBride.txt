TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right God bless you all I mean again just wonderful selections just to hear just the hearts of everybody all the kids and everything you know that's beautiful that's a blessing amen um you all are a lovely group thank you amen I don't know if the devil tell you otherwise but if he does he lying really you all are a wonderful group man it's just a real blessing to just be amongst people where you I mean in my heart I feel a connection right the spirit of God is here you know what I mean so that's just that's priceless that's priceless so all right brother vain God bless you brother amen good to see you okay so let's get into the word here now um pray that the Lord help help us once more and we've already prayed for brother Jesse that the Lord continue to use him 1 Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we going to start at Verse 18 so I guess this should be a part two amen I never had a part two before we got one now so uh the same topic coordination and same same subtopic connected 1 Corinthians 12 starting at Verse 18 says but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him amen and if they were all one member where were the body cuz sometimes the devil fights us you know sometimes people are not satisfied with who they are Satan loves to cause dissatisfaction you know what I mean cuz then that causes you to kind of not be able to see the valow you of of how God made you he'll have you looking at somebody else and say man I wish I was but you got something that they don't have and they have something that you can never have because each one of us are unique yes we're uniquely made in the sight of God and how we made is needed how we are made is needed for the body for for the church for the family that God has placed us individually within okay so uh verse 20 but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye I like this and the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of thee cuz the eye might feel like it has a greater role now I can see everything you can't see nothing so hand I don't really need you but yet let the eye try to reach for something that's right you can see but you can't do nothing else so you need that hand it says so that I can't say to the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of thee nay but much more those members of the body and I love how God places the Saints which seem to be more feeble are necessary amen and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestore more abundant honor and are uncommonly Parts the ones that don't have the attention the you know seemingly you know the the level of importance it says for all more cly Parts it says I'm sorry verse 23 again and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow a more abundant honor and uncommonly Parts have more abundant cess for our calmly Parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having giving more abundant honor to that part which lack which lack that there should be no Schism in the body it says but that the members and this is my point but that the members should have the same care one for the other amen and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it it says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular BL bow Heavenly Father we've read your word Lord may you just minister to our hearts as you see fit in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen so of course in me being a father of five with the age ranges with the age ranges that I I I have so I have 26 I have 22 I have 20 I have 18 and I have 16 right so uh everybody's got their own personalities nobody's the same right um and so and what I find is a parallel because for a number of years I was uh a supervisor well I was in the military right and so as you gain rank you have more people under you I was a supervisor for a number of years and so you're dealing with a group of people that are all different right but yet you have to uh provide uh guidance and training and development skills to try to cause them to to come together and work together as one unit you know and so the same thing for a church you know uh you can take it to the household right so is it's just that that that that element that's there where you're bringing different people together that have different a mixture of different qualities and what have you and you got to bring them together to work together in coordination right and so but in doing that it helped me to really begin to see for one the number one thing you have to really care about the people that you're working with yes if you have a manager or a supervisor that really don't care about the people you can feel that don't you yes and you will see it it'll be the the results of their leadership it'll be off I've been in those places where a person they might have a n you know a number of years of experience in a job or you know they've been in a 32 years but yet they don't have that right makeup to be a manager or to be a super supervisor they're harded and in the right place right and even even outside of that outside of the leadership the team itself right that's the one that's the number one thing I promote in my household is teamwork you know we but in order to have teamwork you got to have a care one for the other you got to care that I don't want to I don't want to create no more work for my brother or my sister so whatever role I have whatever I'm I'm I'm assigned to do let me do that so that the body or the group or the household can flow in the right manner so how much more God right we're all the body of Christ but members in particular so God wants each one of us to be a a highly functioning part yes amen right because there there is a way in which he wants his body to move there is an atmosphere that he wants to exist among his family I don't want no quarreling among my my my my children and I've had to deal with that you know you I kind of you know I'm I'm off I'm doing other things or whatever you know but then I'm listening you know I listen to tones and the choice words and I got to go to them sometimes I'm like is everything all right you sound a little edgy you know the things you saying are a little too sharp to me I don't think that's how God wants you to talk to your brother or your sister you know but I'm a father but I'm monor in these things without even really doing it on purpose but it's just it's my desire and that's how I know a family should operate so God is always listening to us he's always watching us you understand what I'm saying so he don't want no ISM or no Schism in his body he don't want it in the home he don't want it in the church and even while we're out in the world God wants us to represent him properly yes amen my mind just it just go places Saints let me share this with you right here okay uh brother brandom kind of picks up on that kind of that body illustration and he says here and what is the what is the works of God 1959 April the 4th he says my finger could never take the place of my ear no matter how much it tried neither could my mouth take the place of my eye he says but each member knows what it can do and all of them notice our topic again coordination he say all of them coordinating he says together makes the body move he says if this church can only see that so now notice now this is this is not just brother Brandon this is the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost is taking the time just like he did through Paul to lay out the different parts of the body and to make those emphases that same God was here here here here right here with the prophet and he's taking a time to emphasize these points he says if this church can only see that what's that all of them coordinating makes the body move we left off with showing how brother brandham was showing that the third pool now God allowed the third pool to operate in his life to show us an example to give us a taste through his experiences of what we should expect and he said he said you're only going to see this a little bit in my Ministry but you wait when that squeeze comes upon the bride he says watch the third pool then that's right but then God comes through the prophet and he begins to emphasize this point it's going to take coordination in order for us to see that third pool work properly through the body am amen so the Holy Spirit right now is working with all of us to bring us to our places so that this thing can come into a a real manifestation amen right so then he comes down he says if you can only see that it takes coordination it takes cooperation with all the body of Christ so now when we talk about Heavenly atmospheres sitting together in Heavenly places what does that look like it's not complicated it's very simple but it takes the effort of every heart to create that atmosphere we're amateur creators right right so it's up to us to actually create the right atmosphere for God to be welcomed so he can come down in the midst of us and really work and move as he wants to listen there are real needs Among Us right now there are prayers that's been offered up countless times sometime maybe you've been waiting a long time for a certain prayer to be answered or whatever how many realize there is gifts in here can we say praise the Lord to that the prophet said there is gifts in every local assembly there's the gift of interpretation of tongues tongues prophecy you know the gift of knowledge wisdom helps healing right so we're praying and we're looking for God to come and move to give us the answer to certain prayers right but if we all get into our positions conse Our Lives to God God will come right down and Supply that need maybe through one of the members of the body why was it that people were so uh enthusiastic about brother brandom coming they wanted him over here they wanted him over there they wanted him everywhere why was that excuse me because he had become so surrendered to God and God has such a control over his life until God can take that human man and speak through his mouth to give help and healing to the rest of the body amen you understand what I'm saying his love for God came to a profound place that's what the ministry was all about it was a display of his love relationship with his God Amen so how are the gifts going to come into a manifestation Among Us it's not it's not going and seeking for a gift but it's giving our hearts to The Giver amen and as we give our hearts to the giver and we fall more in love with God you will begin to see these things automatically surfac it don't even have to be in a church setting the Holy Spirit can just move on you at any time Heavenly places Watch what he says about this cuz that's what we're talking about here adoption again 19 1960 May the 15th he says oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would just if we be sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart he says that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted setting he says in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in the Heavenly places I want to drop this in if I may brother brandham says sincerity brings real worship amen he says sincerity brings power if you don't have sincerity I'm just going to say it just very plainly if we don't have sincerity our worship means nothing to God right that's a subject I've been dealing with also cuz it's like wow because he says in vain do they worship me you worshiping you taking you taking the time the effort the money the the the the all that you put into going I'm not talking about you guys but just places that have false doctrines and things of that nature they go through the through all that extent of effort and time and money and all that put they pour into building a building and and Gathering of people and then and on service days they sing songs and they have wonderful sounding worship all the lyrics are together everything is in tune and all the musicians are in tune and every bit of it is rejected by God because they're not sincere that's right they don't really love God they're just giving God a performance but God is bringing us above all of that amen it's not just a performance it's not just a a physical workup but it's from the heart amen the same worship they gave him before God said it's a stench in my nostrils now why what happened what changed their hearts change praise God everybody understand that he goes on to say setting together in Heavenly places he says not one evil thought Among Us do you believe that's possible yes say Amen it's possible all things are possible through Christ Jesus but we deal with things so often and sometimes for so long we we we kind of lose sight that I can really be delivered there is a real place that I can come to where I can be free from this bondage of whatever kind of sin it is why because I got a God that's already died for me my sins are already paid for and within that plan that he made what did he do he released his own Spirit to come back and live inside of my soul so that I can now rise up above all the listen he's the one that defeats the enemy for us amen all we have to do is welcome him yes listen the Bible says if there first be a willing mind that is accepted according to what you have and not what you don't have right yes you can't beat this way God has laid out everything for us and his helping hand is here to just come right in and accommodate whatever we need all right he says not one evil thought talking about Heavenly atmospheres Heavenly places not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another this is what he's calling Heavenly places most people had the idea oh we in Heavenly places brother do you feel the power of the Holy Spirit man the gifts operate you can have listen the lord gave us a well supplied message here you can have the gifts of the Spirit operating every and everything right but in the Bible it says all that say unto me Lord Lord shall not enter into the kingdom he says and they say haven't we prophesied in your name he said depart from me for I what I never knew you there was no relationship but yet it was the real power of God working among them so our focus is not on just the receiving of gifts but it's the to have a relationship with the giver yes amen that's the key note relationship with God and that'll bring the relationship among us that'll bring the real care that we need for one another so even though I'm preaching these things every bit of it is wrapped up into the baptism of the Holy Ghost it brings our perspectives it takes our perspectives from all these places and it brings it right in line with the mind of God cuz now that's what's working in us right so that's the number one thing listen if you're not sure that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let that be your priority and if you may have received it but need more so be it an initial feeling or a refilling let that be the focus every single day now now how do you come into that just on a daily basis submitting yourself to the things of God making time for God we make time for what we want to make time for that's the truth I don't know what the stores are around here right but whatever the favorite stores are you catch the news that they got a 99% sale on that means you get it for nothing now you got all kind of plans you got things to do and it's a one day sale you'll do whatever you can and at least try to make it the only way you won't make it is if you absolutely can't make a way but you'll be willing to change things because of the importance of getting something that would cost a $100 for a dollar brother you know I can get you know what kind of deal I can get God is much he's worth much more than that so can't we make sacrifices can't we make time for him amen look whatever you have done up until this point where has it gotten you right when it comes to the things of God what more could you have done right with you already know is he worth that extra effort yes sir he is amen that's the way that's the road to travel in into all these areas and I'mma leave you with something at the end that's been a key to what God has really been doing in my life over these last few months it it helped me so much Saints I'm kind of I'm I'm just I'm just kind of like in awe to be honest amen okay not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against another everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord in one place he says then suddenly there came from Heaven a sound like A rushan Mighty Wind he says there you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings okay so we touched on living our lives for others right and that's very important but I think God is kind of allowed me to see that in that particular way because it's like wow I didn't I I didn't ever considered it like that how I live my individual life within my own heart and my own mind my thoughts that I allow to flow through my mind it matters and it can affect my brothers and my sisters oh my God okay now watch watch this I'm not going to go back over that okay we we read the scripture where he he admonishes us that we love one another as he loved us he gave up a lot we realize that and when I say he gave up a lot meaning he lived a life on Earth that was going to be beneficial to the body of Christ he said I sanctify myself for their sakes how many remember that scripture it's John chapter 17 starting at Verse 18 he says as thou has sent me into the world even so have I sent also them or even even so have I also sent them into the world he says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanct ified through the truth so here it is he sees a need amongst these men and he's saying now I'm going to live my life in a certain way so that they can receive the full benefit of what's going to come from my life into their lives Amen brother brandom say he never Liv for himself he always he say he spent his entire time living his life for others now watch what brother brandom says here and what message is this this is called the the lamb and the dove he says while you're listening the most outstanding scripture he says one of them that I can think of is when Jesus said father think of it father for their sake I sanctify myself he says what was he doing setting the example for you and I and for them right he says he was a lamb what did he do he had a right to a home he was he was a man he had a right to be married he had he was a man he had a right to good clothes he was a man he say but he Sanctified himself he forfeited there are things that you and I could do places we could go right but it's not profitable for us it's not going to benefit us but it might hinder us it might it might create unnecessary battles is a term they use out in the world choose your battles wisely certain things we ain't got to have a battle with we actually go to the battle and we put ourselves in battle unnecessarily just stay away from the place stay away from the person don't watch it don't listen to it you eliminate the battle right there that's right I sanctify myself amen right he goes on to say um he could have he could have he could have come down the corridors of Glory a full statured man he says with an Angelic band sure he says but he Sanctified himself he could have at least been born in a nice clean bed somewhere but he was born in in a Manger over manure pile he says in a borrowed manger he says but he Sanctified himself why he was the lamb see friends we got to go back to the assembly line religion he says and so forth and all these things we're getting away from the real things humble yourself keep humble Lord I sanctify me he says Jesus was training some men that was going to take the gospel to the world 12 men so he lived a Sanctified life and for forfeited every worldly pleasure for their sakes glory to God see but he was God and he had the love that was necessary to be able to see them in the right way to lay down his life you understand but now we understand that we can lay down our lives also for our friends praise the Lord he says we ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing and our worldly pleasures and things like that for the sake of the people we're trying to lead to God Amen it's more than just word spoken we can we we we can learn the message or the gospel you know you can learn the verses of the Bible and you can go to somebody you can repeat words or whatever but what's more effective if there is a life that matches the words that are being spoken you understand what I'm saying now that's the working of the Holy ghost not just a right word to say and due season but a life that expresses Christ amen that puts God on display so that people can see a real God in their day remember the prophet said many people ain't going to never read their Bibles he said but they'll see you he said you'll be the only Bible they'll ever see why cuz your life is the message amen Paul said ye are our Epistles read of all men huh the more we surrender the more God molds us and our lives begins to reflect him more and more and he was the Living Word and we become the Living Word oh my praise the Lord Saints that's good to me amen he says he says let the dove come in tonight sanctify yourself that the dove of real faith will come in and take his abode all right I'mma try to draw it down to a close here but it's a few things I want to highlight when the Holy Ghost comes inside of you like I said it kind of brings your perspective into these places he works inside of us and he's been working right and he's working in each one of us I believe right now and he's bringing our focus and our sight and our attention to these needful areas because it's his work he see what needs to be done he's the gardener and so he's just dealing with us he's dealing with us but then I noticed that there's that Common Thread amongst all that really had the baptism of the Holy Ghost they begin to live their lives for other people watch this 1 Corinthians I'm sorry 2 Corinthians chapter 4 start at verse 10 2 Corinthians 4:10 he says always bearing about in the body how how how often how often always mean all the time right I mean like every day every every second every minute the Holy Spirit brings us con he brings into a consciousness of himself that's how we were able to fall into all kinds of sin and whatever when we lose consciousness of god notice how it says this always bearing about in the body he says the dying of the Lord Jesus what does that mean he died remember he said I would that you would love one another as I loved you he died to his own will remember in Gethsemane father if it be possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless let thy will be done and not my will so it's a death to our own will you understand and allowing the will of God to have the Forefront God don't want to force us he want you to want that he wants us to want his will he don't want us to be forced to take his will what is that to him it it's meaningless if you got to force somebody if you say tell me you love me what good is that if somebody got you got you ain't told me you love me if somebody got to make a statement like that something is wrong let me ask you this question does God tell you he love you that's important right God wants to be freely told he wants us to freely serve him he don't want to force us to do nothing he wants us to give it to him freely without being provoked that's what it's all about he introduces himself we start our journey he begins to show us who he is and in turn we're to gain that appreciation for him to say Lord you are worth my time you are worth the giving of my life to you father you are worth me dying so that you can live on the inside of me that's the place Paul came to Paul said I I count everything I ever learned and saw whatever as dumb that I might gain the excy of Christ amen talk about a love relationship praise God but notice this life of sacrifice here he says in verse 11 I'm sorry verse vers 10 Again always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest where in our bodies praise God he says in verse 11 for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake living your life for others right that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh he says so then death worketh in us but what in turn of that life in you so the more we die the more life comes to you because we become condu of the flow of the spirit of God that affects you in such a way until you begin to die to yourself and you begin to enter into that same love relationship 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 9 he says for I think he says for I think that God have set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to Men He says we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise notice they were taking this condemnation from the world because they were used by God to spearhead these revivals but it caused a lot of persecution they had to endure with a lot a lot of wrongdoing a lot of people they tried to kill Paul how many times one time they stoned him so he was unconscious and God had to well I think he actually died and God had to come and actually raise him up and when he got up because the Holy Ghost was so powerful so so full within him he went on to the next assignment that's a real life of sacrifice I'm not saying we got to go through that but whatever God chooses right amen he says we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ you're benefiting from our dying amen we are weak he says but you are strong amen he says ye are honorable and we are despised we're carrying forth this gospel and all the demons that are upon these religious leaders they're persecuting us they're blaspheming our names and all of these things but yet by our sacrifice it's causing you to now live in the sight of God and we're gladly giving our lives for you my amen he says in verse 11 even un this unto this present hour he says we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffered and and and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we blessed being persecuted we suffer it being defamed he says we entreat he says we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things until this day look at what he had to deal with for the sake of bringing that gospel Saints but the people because God was in him the people that he was laboring for he saw as being so valuable he said you're worth me giving my life for the sake of seeing you being able to live in your purpose amen amen and that's the place that the Holy Spirit I believe is bringing each one of us to amen so I'm going to make a few last points here that I want to leave with you that I think are very needful Matthew 18 and verse 6 Matthew 18 and: 6 says but who so shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drown in the depth of the sea he says woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense come in the Amplified Bible that same few verses read is this but whoever calls as one of these little ones I'm talking about our lives affecting other people yes Ain ain's life was connected right and he caused Israel to come into a great downfall and defeat on that day right we already went through that part of it so we're not going to go back over that again but we see how our lives can affect people positively or negatively but notice God's view here and it Amplified it gives a little more of a picture of it but whosoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble and sin you place a wrong example before somebody that's following your influence no matter where you might be watch how he says this by leading him away from my teaching it would be better for him to have a heavy Millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea so in God's mind if you call somebody that would believe on me that's currently trying to come to me to stumble because of your influence in their life and they see a wrong example come from you and you he said look I don't play with that just something to be mindful of because you know the way that the enemy had Eve or caus Eve to do what she did is because he took away he took away the seriousness of the repercussions of her decisions God said you will die if you eat of this tree Satan say you ain't going to die God is trying to keep you back from gaining more knowledge isn't that how things happen right the Devil comes in and tries to lessen the seriousness of what could happen as a result and now now that enables a person to feel like well I can go ahead because I I can just praise the Lord Amen brother brandom says let's live our lives for our neighbor sake let's live our lives for the people on our job sake you know just people that you will come in contact with and have an influence over or can influence live your life for that person all right so now I'mma give I'mma give these two examples here um and these really touch my heart amen okay we already went over in the first service what brother brandom says by our misconduct and our unconfessed sins we can block somebody from healing we can we can block the church from progressing right watch these two examples here Saints especially this first one this message is called how the angel came to me um and his commission he says there is a lady sitting right back over there in the corner I see that light hanging over her so the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord was present and he was drawn to that woman he says I see I see that I see that light hanging over he says that's the only way I can tell what he says what about it he says that's light that light that that light's hanging this light right here is hanging over the lady maybe just maybe he says maybe just in a minute if I can see what it is it'll break talking about what God want to show him he says listen to this Saints the lady is suffering with a heart trouble she's looking right to me he says and her husband is sitting next to her and her husband has got some sickness he's he says he's just been sick upset sick he says that's he says isn't that right sir raise your hands up if that's right if that's true he says that's right he says it's you lady with the little scarf there the mister isn't that right haven't you been just kind of upset today watch he says you have upset in your stomach the man that's right you all believe with all your heart both of you you accept it sir notice this now sir remember now with aen he called the tribe he called the family and he had one man pass in front of the other by one by one and he stopped with aching and he begin to hone in on him so now you see all these people in this Auditorium but now God is naring it down to one situation and now he keeps focusing in on that husband but the woman has the heart trouble watch this he says sir I tell you he says you too I see you with your hand up he says the habit of smoking he says quit doing that and now that's the holy Spirit right he says quit doing that he says you smoke cigars you shouldn't do that makes you sick watch how he says this saint he says isn't that right sir raise your hands up if that's true I'm sorry he said you smoke cigars you shouldn't do that makes you sick isn't that right if it is wave your hand like this that's what's upsetting you he says it's bad listen listen I thought cigarettes and stuff supposed to calm your nerves that's what they say right I got to calm my nerves at my job it's 23° outside and they out there under the smoke shed shivering fingers about to get Frost bit trying to take a few Puffs and they thinking that is to calm their nerves but the holy ghost is now showing otherwise it says throw away he says he says it's bad on your nerves you smoking it you think it's calming your nerves but it's making your nerves worse throw he says throw those nasty things away and don't do it no more and you'll get over that and be all right and your wife's heart trouble will leave her that's his wife whenever this heart condition surfaced she felt obviously something abnormal said honey something going on with me my heart is is is doing something I'm not you I haven't experienced this before and he said okay honey okay you know cuz that's his wife he loves her right okay honey I'm going to take you to the H let's go to the let's go to the doctor see what the doctor say so they're going to hospital visits they're going to appointments they're looking to the doctor to help them to understand what's going on with her heart she probably had medication she was taking but that wasn't the thing that was going to cure it right the thing that caused her heart trouble the thing that caused her heart trouble even to come into existence was laying beside her every night that little thing he had going on with that cigar he didn't even know that he was connected to his wife to that degree and he was bringing on a heart trouble because of what he was bound by throw the nasty things away and don't you do it no more and you get over he said you'll get over that talking about his stomach trouble he says and be all right he says and your wife's heart trouble will leave her you believe that isn't that right I can't see you from here he says and you know that he says but you're carrying cigars in your pocket in the front he says lay the things out and put listen to this now lay the things out take it out your pocket right now lay the things out and put it over he says and put your hand over on your wife tell God that you are through with that kind of stuff and you'll go home well and and you and your wife will get well his wife's cure was him stopping smoking they were connected you think about prayer requests and just different things that go on in different places this open my eyes you understand what I'm saying is when people have prayer requests and whatever like oh Satan is moving amongst the people you know all kind of things or whatever but then they're not even mindful of the fact that that little secret sin you have could be causing that prayer request second one it's a little girl here she had what they call hodkin disease a little girl come here not long ago from the high school her mother called me up said brother brandom my little girl praise God has got Harkin disease he says that's cancer forms in lumps and the doctors took a piece from from a break on her on her throat send it away and it was perfectly hot skins disase so so he said the next one breaks may break over her heart when it does she's gone she's going to die he says said she's got uh the way the way they're breaking she's got any anywhere about three months to live the mother said what shall I do send her back to school talking to the doctor right uh said let her go because she'll go probably suddenly and said she let her she let her go and let her go just let her go and live a normal life as she can don't tell her nothing about it so the lady said to me what must I do she went to the doctor there wasn't nothing for the doctor to do because the cure for her daughter lied within her bring her up brother brandom says watch this Saints and put her in the prayer line and I said you come with her he said I felt a little funny feeling the Holy Spirit moving the little girl needed healing she was going to die he said you bring her up but you come with her and when a little girl come by that morning with blue blue looking lips from makeup and as the school has them and the little thing come by I didn't know who she' be was going to call me on the phone I took a hold of her hand I said good morning sister he says there she was that was her just in a few moments look down to her mother and seen both of them without god without Christ I said how can you expect healing on these grounds will you accept now listen they going to the doctor the doctor telling her what he's telling her but the do the Lord made it that way to where nobody else couldn't do anything for them because he was going to use this bondage as a Deliverance there's a strange statement brother Brandon makes and I I wondered at it for a while but I think I finally understand it he says the hair off of a dog's back is good to put on the bite from the dog praise God God is using this very situation to actually bring Deliverance to them you understand the working of Satan being used to actually bring them out of bondage watch this just in a few moments look down saw a mother how can you expect healing on these grounds will you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior I said will you come to this pool here and be baptized in the Name of Christ for the remission of sins they said we will will do that he says oh you know what happened the woman may be sitting here this morning many of you know the case brother Mike Egan one of the trustees here watched the case that's been about four or five years ago the little girl was took back to the doctor not even one trace of Harkins disease was found in her her mother was seeking help but she didn't know that her decision was The Cure her decision to live for God and not only live for God live for her daughter and the disease was taken away the devil was cast out they were connected they were connected I feel led to stop right there Saints I feel that I've issued out given out what's been placed on my heart to give I do I believe without even asking I know you understand right and for these areas for these types of subjects it's not so it's not joyous meaning it doesn't make you happy but it's joyous to see that God comes in and deals with us in such detail remember in the Bible it says in Malachi I believe the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings how did that come about through God coming through a prophet and Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart getting down to the root cause of issues and bringing about real healing amongst the people that's what C every time Christ comes that's what he does he sets us free amen amen so I pray that Beyond this service that the Lord would continue to deal with all of our hearts it's his work we're his body he loves us he watches over his word the Bible says to perform it so I pray that God is continue to deal with all of us and help us to die to ourselves and to submit ourselves to him now there's a a a gold nugget that I said I was going to give to you I didn't say a gold nugget but it was a little something at the end it but it's a gold nugget amen all right I need for you take a real strong mental notive you ain't got nothing to write with or just write it down if you can I'm not speaking uh I'm not saying this just because I'm behind the pull pit just the UT forth words because it sounds right or whatever um I'm speaking this because of the realities that I've experienced myself I needed help I was tired of dealing with certain things continuously you know um I wanted to be more free than I ever been free before you know I wanted to have a just my mind wanted everything to just to come into a higher place a less plagued place and the Lord led me here and in my life I'm seeing the benefits of what he's come to prove to me is true God wants to prove his word to each one of us he wants us to know that he's real and that his word is right yes amen watch this now I'mma narrow this down to these few verses of scripture here something to just kind of take to heart I talked with brother Jesse about this on yesterday you're going to have to be led in your own in your own lives to really enter this but this is a tool that you can use to gain more victory in your life Isaiah 58 and I want to start here at um verse 6 Isaiah 58 and verse 6 he says is not this the fast that I have chosen I'm not going to ask how many people fasting here I'm just going to point this out right and if you if you are sincere if you if you if you mean business with God I'm telling you God is going to come and prove to you his word is not this the fast that I have chosen he says to loose the bands of wickedness so through fasting it brings Deliverance he says to undo the heav heavy burdens if your heart is burdened you got things that are waiting you down fasting becomes an Avenue through which God will release you from that heavy burden he says and to let the oppressed Go free oppression is not possession you might not be possessed by a devil but you got certain spirits that have gained a certain level of success within your life over time and those particular ones keep sweeping by and in one place the Bible says Satan takes people under his control at will because of that weakness that's there is like you always give over to it if you want to be free from that he says to let the oppressed Go free and notice and that who break you ye break every yoke so a yoke is used to control something they put Yol on oxen and things of that nature to drive it wherever they want to drive it yeah it's a control mechanism that's what demons do once they gain that place and they begin to drive people into things they don't even really want to do they don't want to do it but they become a slave to it they find themselves being weak and that's just due to a lack of consecration but God is giving us an answer right here if you want to be free from these things you enter into a sincere fast with these as a focus your self-reflecting lord I want to be free from this once and for all it's worth the sacrifice Saints I'm telling you verse 8 says then as as a result of fasting he says then shall thy light Break Forth as the morning and thine Health y your spiritual health being free from the sickness of sin he says and thy Health shall spring forth speedily God will recover you he'll cast that devil out right shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before Thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward notice in verse n we got prayers that we pray but the Bible says if there is some kind of condemnation in your heart you can't have confidence so you going to pray but because something is in your life and and that devil holds that over your head when you go to pray sometime well God do you even hear me you can't have a confidence but notice what it says here verse n then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer amen so that means that he don't just come and readily answer us when everything ain't on good terms between us and him right he repeats the same thing in the New Testament but he's saying here if you give yourself over to this lifestyle of consecration with includes which includes fasting then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer Thou shalt cry and he shall say here am I if thou take away from the midst of Thee the Yoke and the putting forth of the of the finger and speaking vanities right right I'm going to skip down he says in verse 11 and the Lord shall guide thee continually as a result of fasting and the Lord shall guide thee continually how many want to be guided by God continually amen that means you ain't wasting time on stuff that's unnecessary right he says and satisfy thy soul in drought in a spiritual drought I'mma give you what you need to feed you I'm going to give you the moisture of my spirit right he's he's the Fountain of Living Waters he told the woman at the well take a drink her soul was in a drought isn't that right and what was the result of her drinking from that life flow it healed her praise God Amen then he says and the Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul and drought watch and make fat thy bones your bones is a strength it's a strength of your body God I'll strengthen you all this is result of fasting now I'm telling you Saints it's the truth it works Amen brother brandham fasted but Paul said I fasted often brother brandham he fasted often many times three days before he was going to have a healing service and before he preached he would fast on certain days of the week it was incorporated we see the success of it watch this now I'm closing on this and make fat thy bone and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose Waters fail not and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places that that thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generations so ACC so so as a result of you fasting you're going to cause other people to begin to prosper and recover and be taken from the snares of the devil to begin to live the life that God intended for them to live you're going to raise up the foundation he says of many generations praise the Lord he says and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restore of the paths to dwell in if thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath of delight of the holy of the Lord honorable and shalt honor him not doing your own ways he says we see that where is it at not doing your own ways right you living for me now you ain't worrying about this having your way the way you wanted and if you don't now you got an attitude no now you begin to Value what my will is for your life over your own amen right nor finding thy own pleasure nor look speaking thy own words he want to have that control over you the way he use your mouth your tongue is surrendered to him amen amen man he says in verse 14 then shalt thou then thou then shalt thou Delight thyself in the Lord and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord have spoken it take that and lock Got Away in your heart and I know when it comes to fasting you just can't you you need to be led to enter into it but at the same time if you got a certain thing going on in your body and you go to the doctor and the doctor say oh that's a result of you drinking sodas that pain you feel that's because you're drinking soda you need to stop drinking sodas do you need to wait to stop drinking sodas once you realize that's the thing that's negatively affecting my body I can be free from what I'm experiencing if I just stop you're going to stop so we're not trying to force this upon nobody as a religious act CU your heart and your mind needs to be in the right place whenever you enter into it but you can't deny the benefits that God has laid out concerning what it brings so if you want these things in your life it's at your you you have access to it pray for me Saints I'll be praying for each one of you I pray God continue to bless you strengthen you keep you I know he will you're his wife and a man takes care of his wife and he's done a marvelous job at that amen I see the growth I feel like I said just that welcoming spirit I ain't no super spiritual guy or whatever but over time you just get you know you become familiar with certain things so I I believe God is really among you so may he continue to help you and bless you and bless brother Jesse to be yielded to bring messages that's Mee and du season spiritual F Minon amen so you all can eat well you know by the hand of God feeding his children what he knows you need let us all stand together I enjoyed my time with you and um until we meet again may the Lord just keep each one of us amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
