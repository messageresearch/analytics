[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let's go Daniel chapter 9 it'd be good Daniel chapter 9 we're sorry verse 2 alright well how do you be seated suck out space um two years ago I preached Daniel seven weeks I went back over the notes and I don't give anything different so I got the same notes I just added a little bit beforehand you know because as you learned you know you grow and learn I have it no silly program talk exactly the way I taught it you know because following his quotes you know so I'm just gonna start with a few different quotes just about the prayer that Daniel offers here before he gets the visitation from Gaber which is just a powerful humble prayer I just think it'd be good for us to read that or working our way through Daniel have you enjoyed it praise God man I've enjoyed it but hymns like wow you creatures do Daniel always been confused about Daniel he's the kind your notes on that or something welcome to help you I'm just certainly enjoyed it so he's a book I've had a lot of questions about but as I've read through it God is taking away all my fears you know I bought in understandest is like the Bible basically serpents itself then program has all the correct interpretations that we need so it's really been a wonderful time to have a lot more confidence about bookid and in praise God now we're down into Saturday just three more chapters ten eleven twelve so as a pastor it's hard to be in the middle of something it's always either be nice and to finishing something or start stuff it's hard to be in the middle I just want to get it done you know but it's got to be patient Daniel 9 verse 2 let's read it together 22 tree in the first year of his reign again understood by books the number of the years wear out the word Lord ladies Jeremiah the Prophet and he wouldn't come for 70 years in the desolations part is only father Lord we love you and father we're thankful for this word Lord that we've just read Lord this was written 2500 years ago 2500 years and yet Lord 500 years after this your son Jesus came to the earth and vindicated Daniel as a man of God so your profit came in this hour vindicated it again said how it was true and gave us the true interpretation Lord and it's so amazing or because this revelation was sealed up unto the end time Thank You Orden we're living in a day where we don't have to scratch our heads and be confused about the Book of Daniel the Lord you've given us the book of Revelation to help fill it and Jesus's words and and the prophet of the our Lord revealing these things that were grateful for of us Lord to stay in tune with prophecy Lord God we thank you for this time in your word bless it to your people Jesus Christ nee I reset it unless you can see their free stuff all right so hold on begin there I want to begin now come when you can switch over a fishing dancer I want to begin with Daniel 9 1 so there's some quotes here come on crazy Lord chapter 9 we view this honey to readers maybe I don't let him al Qaeda always there to help me anybody I don't add on the on different ones I could use a little bit of help it's it's really great to read the prayer that Daniel prays and this is the kind of prayer that an angel will visit you after if you look at this prayer it's quite it's quite a prayer or the we'd say for us maybe the Holy Spirit you know visiting us so let's look at this chapter 9 Jamis if foster brought us one of the commentaries I like to use it's also part of the table software that no random you know without voice of God puts out so it must been one of his books or must have use it at some funny time said chapter 9 took place in by 37 which is about 13 years after the vision of chapter 8 remember this book is all out of chronological order you can't have to go by you know the verse one of almost each chapter see you know would you person was ruling and so Daniel was about 83 years old at this time still praying and fasting eighty-three years old prey you're passing same god help me to understand what I were I'm living in see if you're doing it now Church it's a good inside here and do it later maybe Batman you're not doing about sorry to that that you could keep that humble approach to God of the Colombo he was 83 years old so numbers about 550 now chapter eight was about 550 he was about I'm saying Shepherd I'm sure sets he was 70 years old there so that's where we're we're looking at here he he said quite a old man down chapter one you know Darius the Mede had succeeded Belshazzar that took place in Chapter five this was in the first year of Darius is rule there according to chapter verse 1 in verse two Daniel received understanding through the books of Jeremiah the 70 years of Jerusalem's desolation on Jeremiah wasn't even two generations away he was just the previous generation yet just written these books and already within one generation one prophet of God could recognize another prophet of God as being a true prophet aren't you glad we're just one generation after brother Graham aren't you glad you can recognize whether I was a prophet and then when we go back and read his sermon to listen to his sermons God could inspire us to be able to see exactly where we are prophesy hey that's the robust so he came to understand through the reading of Jeremiah's books what day an hour he was living in and he found out there were just two years away from rebuilding the temple there just two years away from that is 70 years have to accomplish so here's a scripture you know that that Daniel was reading the whole land should be desolate these nations of the circle king of Babylon seventy years number Hanna dies it'll be - and Jeremiah's like hi he's like hot if you want to leave that go ahead but the Holy Spirit told me seven the real prophet will be vindicated by his words coming to pass all right and then he set out after the 70 years I'll punish the king of Babylon that nation their iniquity we're going to go to pass seven with us save the Lord after seventy years be accomplished at Avalon I will visit you perform my good work toward you and causing you to return to Jerusalem so something had to happen at 70 years something had to happen for them to go back and just at the end of 70 years Daniel gets inspired the prophet of God gets inspired to pick up the prophecy for his day in order to get the people prepared a man sounds like brother branham here gonna pick up Daniel pick up all these jobs revelation he would have pick it up in his hour to prepare us for the rapture Olivia the man said I want you to notice out that you'll get a alien I was stood from his people from his church without one church service brother man steady who's preaching so I wonder if he's preaching on the streets or in people's houses without any church to go to without any hymns to be saying but when he say himself in the midst of all this he's still out on to what the Prophet said no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to eat in temples everybody worship their idols no Christian songs nobody believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man of about 12 14 years old he was taken down there he held true to God and understood by Jeremiah's property that the days were almost accomplished how that would warn the heart of any true prophet of God today that we look back and see what the true prophet said and know that we're at the end time he said I understood by books that Jeremiah my brother many many years ago prophesied that Israel would stay down here 17 years that's times about fulfilled and he made himself ready and he called it fast rectified himself with ashes in sackcloth and put it on his head went to fast and pray need to understand about the day they were living in and if Daniel the prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books and bring him to such a place that even Israel coming out all them alive was coming out of that allowed to go back to the homeland what caused him to fast with sackcloth and ashes how much more on it to do to the Church of the Living God to know that time is fading out and shall be no more and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the great melindam ready to set it as we approach the coming of the Lord do expect creatures not to say fast anymore or you expect them to say fast and I would expect them to say fast as well right I'm saying before the restoration they had to be praying and fasting to understand the word and before our restoration that we know is Joel chapter 2 imagine you have the same condition what does it Church it's a consecrated life to Christ that's what we want how can we spend wases time gambling swimming holes on Sunday you go to Sunday's a day of worship no time for the Lord for the babysitter I'm glad you got time for the Lord tonight god bless you tonight anybody that does the other time the Lord they know it's their blessed because of that just run down if the pastor speaks on something they don't like you get up and go out if the church holds too long while you're dissatisfied look at our condition compare our lives of that prophet one man and the complete Kingdom with no church to go to it not nowhere else to go to it was torn down and burned down his City as people was captive 68 69 70 he had two years left before the decree from Cyrus and this just reminded me this this is the top part of the quote perhaps that people are dissatisfied today remember the prophecy for us I read this morning we're going to be satisfied with God my mam's noticing people are dissatisfied but our day we should be satisfied to come into church that's prophecy and this is a this is actually the one I read this morning I could have used this but it's tough stay the Lord we brought back by the spirit to the fullness of Pentecost now he also said this got no time for the Lord whether man money isn't everything money won't move the spirit II said it's not what light a gun works he moves by spirit and the moving of the Spirit comes only to a life consecrate to the word now what's that true in Daniels day the spirit moved nothing to understand the written word when he consecrated his life to God and so that's what we should be doing consecrated electric got here he says it again remember I've read this part about three or four times your program talks about spiritual gifts if you want to see if you have to sacrifice some of your ideas you have to sacrifice some of your time in prayer you have to sacrifice your stubborn will and break down in humility the whole curse you move is sacrificial so here's Daniel sacrificing time meals all this you know his own clothes you put on sackcloth and ashes young he's sacrificing at all in order to understand the written word of God how much more should we do that praise the Lord so see that's why I keep bringing that up wherever that's why this week I want to join me in prayer try to pray a little extra in the evening time I know we always try to pray in the morning that's fantastic let's add some more time program says if you want to know you got to consecrate your life he so here it is oh if there was ever time we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now it's right now that was a 1961 for we are the true servants we see the letters of the Apostles by the warnings of the Holy Spirit were in the last day the Holy Spirit speaks in the last day men will be heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God look at what I've said I understand it by letter so just like Daniel understood the conditions by letter or the grandma true prophet picks it up and said I understand these things by letter O CO or amen he picks up second Timothy chapter 3 hey Ned I just want to just bring this out just real briefly we're not time to read discipline never there's going to be two groups really there's going to be group that makes the rapture and the group that misses the rapture I know there's individual groups within them I know that I've thought that but if you're if we're the Bride of Christ our kind of coastal faith should be growing and we should be purified from all iniquity that's what Titus 2:14 says remember Jesus tells the made believer you did many wonderful works but your workers of iniquity so our works of iniquity all purged out while the the make believer keeps they keeps their works of iniquity they keep city they can't get free from the sin but we're supposed to be delivered from all iniquity more but the others are iniquities abounding because a lovable of the love is waxing cold so we just got really two groups we've got a group role in the rapture they're going to be they're going to be full of love they're going to be growing in faith growing in the word growing in spirit and these are not they're actually going cold or all the time towards the real Holy Spirit and we're going to be loving God more than our pleasures but they're going to be loving pleasures more than because the Bible said there more and more to seed so the more people get deceived the more they enjoy the pleasures of the world but the Bible says immerse I do want to read out if I can't I do want to read out because that would bless my heart yesterday I was pretty this was a sermon I thought was going to preach this morning then the Holy Spirit corrected me but it was so great to see you know the numerous stands raises for there are like eight or nine hands it was just asking for pairs that really was a help to me as the pastor that's encouraging second Timothy 3:14 it's just taking me a lot to get there okay so the prophecy is verse 13 evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived in the world are deceiving other people right but verse 14 but continue thou thinkest learn and has been assured of never from Paul's writing knowing of whom thou has learned them see assured so we're growing in assurance more insurance of truth oh we were taught these things not by a TV preacher with my brother Brandon a real man of God remember who we're learning them from were being assured because of the person we've heard from a true man of God brother Brandon and the last thing I've been hitting on this a lot because this has been one of the battles you know and memorable medicine spirits attacked churches so the spirit in the last year is to draw people away from church and draw them into sin all these things like that that's why I keep kind of hammered on that because Christians gather more as they see the Day approaching without with Holy Ghost filled Christians not with sinners with Christian but the Bible said and this might be good for us to read the Bible say everybody else will be separating themselves sensual not having the spirit and going out from the true believers so it is really is a separating time you know gathering the tears first and the weak will be gathered into the garner now what I do is good but I think you remember Jude 119 says their sensual that means they they're only they're only concerned about their fleshly appetites right and they suffer themselves from relief verse not having the Holy Spirit I see the Holy Spirit address together yeah it will never start a war between us that's our own humanity our own sin it always always always unite the believers praise God that's what I love to see people you know like I said in the house of God no matter how much people shout you know or like I said I've had shouters leave I've had answers and screamers leave and we've had we just want to see people feed on the word game and living holy ain't been gathered Moors we see that day of rotate man it's a good indicator you're walking the truth remember program said this is the age of self-love that's our warning we cannot love ourselves we cannot love material things that replaces the love of God if they're not careful they'll feel that they'll feel the coldness of the last state church so we gotta fight against that here's the quarter I was talked about this morning by Babson you saw about use is pride you see you get a family guy oh he'll their their child their little family Oh bless them but then he said as it continued he said as long as they continue let's say a family but first thing you know they got an old junk car maybe they're walking under they'll get a good car better hold versing you know they want it better but the world calls a better class associated move into a different neighborhood and then there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence see even where you live is important to God because it shows your influence you must always stay where the kingdom of God is and the glory of God is poured out stay that we can be spiritually fed day and night see why the home church is so crucial milligrams said because if not the first thing what comes separation in the home husband and wife father and children mother and children see that we should be getting filling after filling right pouring out that's why fell this morning good pouring out of the Holy Spirit on me amen if you toe it gives you strength give you encouragement maybe forgiveness maybe gives you a edification you know you got to constantly stay in that presence that's why after service is such important time to worship and enjoy God's blessings even I got a little shower garage Laura's doing some service oh sure I start crying and thank you God it just Heather eise's my heart that's excessive pouring out because now I'm not walking the flesh not walk in the spirit then I can say flow through me all these spirit I'm not concerned about the flesh I'm concerned about the spirit amen let's see people give that up yeah the whole gather in the morning what happens they get lift it up all right number three Daniel set his face to seek God's face I like that free to message one time our face seeking God's face in Albion and a sister in pants got healed afterwards she could even move her arm and she came up after service and told brother Jim she's a friend Jim look at this I was in the battle trainer singing or something she's look at this she said I felt a tap on my shoulder and she turned around nobody was there and then all the pumps training back to arch pinning move her arms five or six T's and I preached on Jezebel painting her face and she had paint on her face what was it it was God trying to show her that that's the truth of God and I don't know what happened after that but I know God showed her that was truth right there right during the preaching a man our face seeking God's face I know God loved that message because it wasn't mine it was his that's a Daniel did right here his face seeking God's face alright now let me go back here okay yeah I want to lay this out to just this will help us the Bible says prayer and supplication prayers you know like Jesus taught us to pray to talk to God but supplication is what is a humble request for fade mother that up in the Hebrew is saying God give me favor so as we read this prayer look how daniel is asking for favor of God returned to us visit us again forgive us give us favor let your hope return let your joy let the joy the Lord return let your people come back to the land he's up he's giving a supplication and when you say God give me a favor on the job or give me a favor with my family give me a favor that new guy at work I like that for that and it's trying to witness the guy work there and I'm gonna try the witness this guy don't work to him like lord give me favor with him that's a supplication I want the favor of the lower like for every service I want God's favor I love us understand a little bit about prayer supplication no prayers I God forgive me no but when you that's part of it our Heavenly Father you know I'll be thy name that's all true that's better that's wonderful that's very godly but when we want God's favor situation that's a supplication will you give me favorite God and how'd he do it he did it with fasting sackcloth in verses 4 to 19 Daniel offers a truly humble prayer God keeps the servant with those I'm sorry God keeps his covenant with those that love him and keep his commit my fall was so beautiful we read I just want to stop and empathize that Daniel says I know you'll keep your covenant to those who keep your covenant you get that so those that don't keep the Covenant God's not going to keep the covenant with them it shows every kid every promise and covetous by conditions because other people don't care they don't care about counts covenant god's promises god's conditions they don't care so they don't keep it but the people that love God's coming it will keep God's coming and then God will keep his covenant with that God honors those who honor him amen so if we can't let's just quickly read you this here mankind Lydia maybe you do some reading for me I'm appreciate that that's their hearts then when you doing Gouri okay so I don't we do five verses at a time that will get us from 4 to 14 about we have three readers yeah they'll get us the 20 okay so Malachi don't you start okay Lydia than Wendy Alki repour 2:8 okay but if you do that and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said O Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to know that keep his Commandments we have said have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and I rebelled even by departing from my precepts and my judgments neither have we hearken unto thy servants the prophets which spake and thy name to mark aids our princess and our fathers and to all the people of the land Oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the having some furious one but I'm to all Israel that are near better far off through all the countries whither thou has driven them because of their trespass I have trespassed against thee O Lord O Lord to us B'Elanna confusion of face to our Kings our Prince's and our fathers because we have sinned against thee amen thank you what a prayer he's confessing his sins and the sins of his people remember God works of Israel by covenant right so he has to pray that way not for us it's not that way it's individual right oh you kill us if still you still can't pray for the syphon crying for the dominations of your family the city we're supposed to do that but here he's he's he's intervening one prophet standing in the gap for the entire nation hi look at that just like Moses he stood the gap for two million people here's Daniel standing in the gap for how many millions at that time but they have all been scattered one prophet standing in the gap how many of us can standing up for our family man standing together the church pray for the people amen so Lydia what'd you do 9 10 11 12 all the way 30 finished either have me amazing voices choice of the Lord I got sloppy in his log which he has separate parts by statements apologist gay all Israel have transgressed I love unify departing but they might not obey my voice therefore the Christian upon us and the outside of the written and the law of Moses the servant of God because you stand against yet concerns his words which she spake against us there your sir judges at judges I'm bringing upon us a dream evil for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem as it is written in the law of Moses all this evil self - yes maybe not our prayer report the Lord our God that might turn from our nicknames and understand my truth hey wow look at this even recognizes we're cursed our people are cursed and it's because we've transgressed the Word of God see now you'll get somewhere with God when you can see your condition right in man I said this morning you've got a K - and you can't go deeper pretty like it is Lord what have I done I must have sinned lord I must repent I must turn from my iniquity see that see the humble repentance that he gives here this is a real prayer humility okay so anybody moved in 14 15 16 and 17 these are really goblets wherefore have the Lord wherever has a lord our subhan Depot and bought it upon this a Lulu and our God is righteous in all his work which he does for we obey not his voice and now O Lord our God that have brought by people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and economy we man as today as this day we have sinned we have done quickly o Lord according to all that righteousness I be sixty let that anger and that it very be turned away from the city of Jerusalem thy holy mountain because I see and for our iniquities of Jerusalem and like people are become held approach to all that about our purpose now therefore O Lord o our Lord hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplication and cost that face to shine upon the century that is Leslie would see Amen see him looking for favor there he said let your face shine upon us it's as if God turned his face away because they were so disobedient and now he's praying for God give us favor let your face shine upon us Amen well thank you I appreciate the readers there verse 19 Oh Lord here Oh Lord forgive Oh Lord hearken and do defer not for that own sake o my god for thy sitting that people are called by thy name and while I was speaking of bringing confessing my sin the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my god yay while I was speaking in prayer even the mad gamer whom I had seen the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation ah me that was three I'm not mistaken 3 p.m. that evening oh because they ended the six I believe that was the evening oblation if I'm not mistaken so you'd pray for quite a while can you imagine praying a pair like this he's quoting Moses he's quoting Genesis and he's quoting all these Old Testament Scriptures this is a condition were in because we haven't kept your promises that you gave to Joshua Moses it's our fault forgive me forgive the people this is a real humble prayer how many like that prayer that's a real prayer if you ever see one Ian was Ezra Nehemiah also prayed some really really awesome seer prayers paid back now in verse 20 and 21 I just wrote you know the angel Gabriel touched Daniel brought him skill and understanding that's in verse 22 and he informed me and talked with me and said Oh Daniel I'm Navajo important to give these skill and understanding now this case is not miracles right you didn't come to bring miracles he just came to give him understanding of the Word of God see how there's a time in season 4 everything he was earlier he was in the den of lions that's when he needed a miracle now he needs skill and understanding praise God so if you need a miracle guess what God can bring a miracle if you need understanding God will bring you understand that's right look at verse 23 at the beginning of that supplication the commandment came forth and I've come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved I love that scripture therefore understand the matter and consider the vision look at this then it was greatly beloved in heaven never he had a strict diet he took care of his body see that he denied anything that transgressed the law for his diet he kept the diet of God he would often pray had three times a day on his knees and here he saw God for understanding of books and and the angel says you're loved in heaven heaven loves you Daniel why is he so interested in what's going on in heaven he wants to know the wisdom of heaven that's how we should be David what has had a lot for our lives for our church when we have that kind of haven't haven't has to love us save ahead because we want the will of heaven to come down to earth right amen ah okay now let's jump ahead now back to the teaching who's never seen this who's never seen this Adam we're here when I taught that brother well then what kind of things so either I thought you've never seen that I'm standing you're both laughing okay yeah yeah brother Kevin asked you to run a website it's got some good views it's got a couple thousand views there so that's encouraging you know I got its grace but I taught this in April of 2015 so I haven't had anything added anything to it because I didn't find anything wrong with it as I've listened to brother Branham eNOS is over the last two years I would find anything wrong so I'm going to try to go or try to go a little bit quickly through here without going too fast like I said it's on our website I can email you the notes numbers 24 gable is going to tell Danny all about it seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon that holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy I remember the six full purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel all right now Rama preached at nineteen sixty one there was the six things I just put the numbers in there so you can see it now I summarized this as I preached a whole sermon on it I went back and summarized what each one was finishing the transgression is to take away the blindness of Israel and graft them back in that's what brother Graham talked like I said I taught a whole sermon on it I tried to squeeze it in to just summarize it here so it's the turning away of the Gentiles back to the Jews blindness causes transgression you're blind you can't see what you're doing you know so that's the first thing to finish the transgression is that end the transgression there's no more blindness then brother Branham said to make an end of sins was Israel's sin Iran believe literally ends when Jesus appears to 144,000 okay so that's the end of sins program said they can't just believe anymore because there is how they going to say you're not the Messiah he comes down out of heaven but I could say that it's like Joseph revealing himself to his brothers we're going to type that out and that sir the third thing to make reconciliation for iniquity Israel's iniquity is purged or pardoned on the one day of Isaiah 66 8 in which they are born again one day that's what in all iniquity leads amen number four to bring in everlasting righteousness with RAM so that's the one thousand year millennial reign that's the time of righteous when the glory Lord will fill the whole earth remember Bobo says brother have stopped and said member I'm not saying eternal righteousness it's just for the thousand years because it's everlasting righteousness okay because why cuz Satan still comes out one more time right and he challenges them and so forth but after the white throne judgment it's eternal amen there's no more sin there can be no more battles it's all eternal righteousness after that battle and after white throne judgment they understand that okay number five to seal up the vision of prophecy game okay to seal the understanding and every of it from Israel and everyone else until the end time and a brother Graham brought up revelation ten seven holiday video the seven that messenger would finish the mysteries to the Gentiles that's what he brings up it's sealed up to finish the prophecy the last thing was to anoint the most holy brother said they have to anoint the Millennial temple so there's a temple the Millennium but not in the future home because the lamb is the temple in the future home he says up there on top of the pyramid you know why he's the light he's the tempo he's everything Amen hallelujah but therefore the Millennium the temple must be an anointed program said he gave us he said any Bible reader knows Ezekiel 43 is the Millennial tribes and back to the millennium and I didn't know that so I showed you what I know I don't know too much ready I'm glad he told me what I don't know so that I can know it afterwards alright so there's a 6-volt purpose okay so we see that by God's grace next is Daniel seventy weeks okay that was verse 24 now I'm going to go through this one the purpose of understanding Daniel seven weeks program said is so we're expecting the right thing in the church and the seals he goes over again and again he said the major miracles are for Jews not the Gentiles right turning water to blood a famine for three to five years that's those are major marital debts and that's not for the Gentiles we're not going to see that before the rapture he says that's for the Jews he said what having a little miracle is little very neat in forever for me every American is a Great America but we're talking about worldwide you know turning water into blood all these things he said that's for the Jews so he said we you have to expect the right thing with Daniel 70 weeks you have to expect the right thing you know what our limited and I know this is so small I'm sorry he just said he felt that I didn't have time to blow those words up he felt let it bring this to so we can see how close we are to the coming of Christ now 70 weeks remain for the Jews at this point in Daniel here it was slow 550 when I say 537 537 seventy weeks are determined for the people now a week is seven years so glad you've seen this on our website I think okay I just know if you do that and over they amended who did that but a week in the Bible is prophetic for seven years okay a time is prophetic of one year remember Nebuchadnezzar seven times passed over him seven years passed over him as the Beast number and the mind and beast so a time is a year a week is seven years so God's got his rank numerology amen so Jacob works a week for Rachel which was seven years okay fulfilled her week which was seven other years are X we see that so the 70 weeks equal 490 years so the Jews had 490 years ago would deal with them until the consummation and the consummation means a termination or annihilation or complete destruction okay and that's of course through Armageddon so in other words they have 490 years that God will deal literally with Israel preach to them until Armageddon until everything is destroyed until the day the Lord comes which isn't one okay so brother Ram divides Daniel 70 weeks in the three three parts or three sections the first period is seven weeks the first to here is our seven weeks and sixty-two weeks okay it's right there verse 25 no they're at four and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks so he breaks up the seventy into three sections you have seven sixty two and one that's how God that's how the age of broke it up see all right the so the third week was one here this is I'm sorry the third section is one a week and he should confirm the covenant with many for one more week right so three plus the sixty-two gives you one more week there to make the total seventy all right now here's a visual every got the visual it's broken up the seventy weeks is broken up into three parts seven weeks or 49 years sixty-two weeks or 434 years or one week seven years the angel breaks it up I'm going to work I'm going to deal with Israel in these three sections of the 490 years how many glad I'm reviewing this that is it helpful to review it or y'all have that memorized over these two years I don't think yet exactly didn't I needed to go do my cupcake what did that mean you get what brother Han say about that can't retain everything in this sort to remember I know one thing is written on my soul I might not be able to understand it all the time but I believe it ain't a hand it's written in my heart so those are three divisions this division was until the time the temple was built this division was the time until Christ came and this division was Christ's ministry but never did get to break this in half because Christ only preached for three half years tonight have another division alright glory and this is when Kevin and Meridian after service and so father Jesse we've been in the message thirty years and that's the first time we ever understood Daniel seventy weeks I said thank you for telling me that that really encouraged me I must be on the right track somewhere god once the finally Goffe in his will to teach them in the right way so I appreciate that so seven weeks okay rebuild Jerusalem and trouble sometimes that's Nehemiah Ezra thereafter the Messiah was to come so we had to wait four hundred thirty four more years till Christ came and then the one week the Messiah confirmed the new covenant Jesus's disciples was the verse three half years but Jesus will use to prophets for the last three and a half years let me know that glory okay so the first period was seven weeks or 49 years and this is where the wall I'm sorry the street will be built again and the wall even in troublous times so Bill Graham said that was fulfilled the issue to rebuild it was March 14th 445 BC I was quite about remember our chapters 537 BC okay so it's almost 100 years later so God was really preparing his people the edict by Cyrus to rebuild it went forth and 445 until was completed to take 49 years to complete the temple the city to rebuild it to Daniel the walls would be built in trouble sometimes and many of us remember when it was built that mortar block in one hand and sorted out remember Nehemiah oh I was beautiful there fighting with one and building with you that's what we should be doing fight the enemy with one hand and building up the kingdom of God in another Amen there you don't worry and there it is Nehemiah 4:17 so there God foretold it in Daniel and here it's recorded in other scriptures truly prophetic so zoobel Azra Nehemiah fulfilled this first seven weeks so Cyrus is ordered to rebuild his right there I think I got some building in here yeah I got a little bit of animation as finished okay there 49 years later yeah okay there this 445 all the way to 396 that's the first division of that seventy weeks the first seven weeks or the first 49 years okay so that was a time issue wet and then they build it they finished it right there okay so what did I have here nothing okay that's good now the second period was 62 weeks and know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and priests card two weeks so sixty two more weeks right and then the street we go again so there's the second division yet seven weeks and now the second division is sixty-two weeks all right yeah threescore two weeks yeah so now I'm like sue me now right instead of zooming into the timeline now I'm zooming out that's the first there's the 49 years of the second one will be like this that's the second part of the that's the sixty-two weeks or the 434 years see now we'll get up to where Christ was born right here okay time until the Messiah begins his ministry so yeah the first get the temple rebuilt and then you have to wait to them aside gets here and then you can start on your third okay yeah so now 69 weeks out of 70 of in fulfills is that clear enough he said I'm giving you 70 weeks 69 will be filled until Christ starts his Holy Ghost ministry which I say he's still doing in the Gentiles today amen hallelujah now there's that third one the third section which will be Jesus beginning his ministry that's right there okay 30 ad the 70th week that's the 70th week 69 weeks have already passed the 70th week starts right there now brother Branham said the trouble we have is with calendars cuz the years in a lineup okay so he said there's got to be 483 years right so he said here's the trouble but now from 4:45 to 80 to 80 30 is exactly 475 years some other maybe even recognizes see some people don't get the years right but as we've already seen at the 69 weeks makes forded 83 now there's there's where the trouble comes right there see we've only got we've got only with the marking of the Bible here only 475 years and actually it's 43 a difference of eight years notice that a difference of eight years remembers like oh he noticed okay there seems to be a difference between eight years so here's the trouble the construction began in 445 BC and Jesus began his ministry in 3080 that the total number of years was only 475 this is a year short of the correct total which was 43 must be a problem somewhere but the problem tells us so the Prophet tells of the problem is the difference of calendars remember there are three counters for the RAM says he says the Julian calendar and the Roman calendar and the Christian calendar and I don't go too fast but I got to get done got to go fast but when we get done now the prophetic calendar has 30 days in a month or 360 days in a year now remember that this prophetic calendar of 360 days in the year so that's the prophetic calendar that God usually uses but brother answered their troubled encounters now the BC for 45 to 80 30 our Julian or strata version for strata me years which are 365 and a fourth day in each one then we reduce them days to our prophetic calendar program says you've got the change you have to fix the calendars the Julian and retic mother must be found the difference between them what's the difference between them and that's what he tells us so brother Aaron said use the Julian counter if you use the Julian counter that's more days in the year five and a four quarter more days in the year and if you adjust them to our prophetic calendar you'll get the right amount I know it's a little deep here but here's where we get to the math the Lord surprise school me in this but he's a madman but this is the best I could do so we must find the difference between the Julian prophetic calendar because it seems like we're eight years short if we use the prophetic calendar so the Julian calendar times that gives you that many days the Jewish calendar gives you that many days the difference is about seven years the Jewish calendar needs adjusted since the flood changed the length of the days and years the flood changed everything nowadays days a little bit longer right now we have more days in the year because of the flood brother Branham says all right okay now that's where talks about the flood I'm not going to read all that that's a lot of reading so the conclusion is the Jewish Keller needs about seven years added to it since the original way the track time was adjusted after the flood so when we add about seven to the 475 we come up to 482 that means we're just one short of 483 that we need so brother have said or what I didn't say this but you have to do this if you have the years zero between one BC one ad that takes the total of 483 which is the exact amount we need okay so together the years right you have to take the Julian calendar and remember that the days are longer you got more days in there if you add up all those days and add those to the prophetic calendar then you get the right amount of days okay and that's what brother have said you said you got to go back to the calendar to fix it because he says the 445 years before was exactly credit so that decree of Cyrus programs that we can't change that that decree ago build a temple you can't change that so it has to be start from that day you can adjust the dates you know eight years less or eight years more so that's what we do I know that's a real quick through it but I want to like I said I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on this because you get the picture I think you get the picture and you can go watch it if you want go slowly through but you have to adjust the calendars now we can move on to the last week the 70th week or the last seven years so now we've got up to the time of the decree went forth to the rebuilding of temple and the time through the temple rebuilt all the way up to Jesus starting his ministry and now we're at the third part which is the last week or the last seven years before the consummation or the annihilation at Armageddon so now we're in 925 9925 the third period or the final week of the seven years began after the first two periods so unto the Messiah the prince should be seven weeks and threescore two weeks so I'm showing it again to begin the middle and beginning of the 70th week okay so here Jesus begins his ministry and there's Jesus's ministries three and a half years so the Messiah was cut off during the midst of the week and everything that he was cut off but not for himself he was cut off for us a man how they feel that we might be grafted in right he was cut off that we might have a portion of God's grace amen hallelujah what a blessing so there's just three happier minutes true so now we're at sixty nine and a half weeks are fulfilled right of the first half of the 70th week okay so now five hundred eighty six point five out of 490 have been fulfilled just if you're going to get real technical so Daniel 9:26 and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people the Prince shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined brother branham said that the messiah was cut off all right let's do this America the destroyer of the city was Titus and the Romans so the prince that came after messiah was cut off the prince that came on em said with Titus he should come and destroy the city and the sanctuary that's exactly what happened in 87 this green is bling I think I don't know why I let that play okay so Titus he's the one who destroyed Jerusalem okay so the Messiah ministered there and Titus destroyed the temple you know less than 40 years later here's where brother Graham says it's down here this is in the first seal they asked for the Branham who was the Prince that cut it off or who's the prince that destroyed the temple Oh Graham said after Christ was cut off from the earth in the three half years of his ministry went ashore the temple who destroyed it he said Constantine no he saw beg your pardon Titus the Roman general okay so Titus was the Prince and then he says it later he said here as well forty years later Titus the general destroyed Jerusalem and scattered the people through all the work now here's the glorious once the Messiah is cut off he wasn't call for himself now we could graft it in amen programs if God went and dealing with the Gentiles we do not have any time a lot of the Jews have time allotted no man knows the day of the hour of ours let's go through it again here's the first seven weeks to rebuild the temple here's the second section which was four hundred thirty four years to Christ and there's the first half of the 70th week of Jesus ministry and now here's the Gentile age amen so God God basically stopped this period right here in the middle of period stops and said well now I'm going to grab to the Gentiles I can get a wife and Israel turned me down I'm putting her out divorcement I'm getting a Gentile bride how they do David and he's had grace upon the Gentiles for 2,000 years Amazing Grace how sweet the seventh alright and now what we're waiting for under the rapture will be the Stephanie or second half while that's going on we'll be up in glory at the wedding supper the marriage supper delay that's exactly right true Bride of Christ so there is a real small red rectangle there all right so remember the Messiah was cut off and now he should confirm the covenant with many for one week and the myth of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate now brother Branham tells us who this is he tells this is the Messiah was cut off okay so here's the quote when was the Covenant of Daniel 9:27 confirmed for weeks let's go back and show you that was Daniel 9:27 was this covenant confirmed see so many people put this in the future but program puts it back at Jesus day he said one half of it was confirmed the Covenant when Jesus was on the earth preaching to the Jews he never went to the James house at all he told his disciples don't go to the Gentiles he was to the Jews alone see any priest three and a half years that's half of the 70th week program goes on visit now and he'll last part the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of the tribulation here after the rapture the church then there are three and a half years here that will be confirmed to them again by the prophets Moses and Elijah Revelation chapter 11 you know the Lord amen so the last 300 years or second half of Daniels 73 is after the church ages there's the rapture of the bride now you have this three and a half year period right you have this three out of your period it's the second half of the seventh week of Daniel which is also called another name for synonym is Jacob's trouble it's also called we call it the Great Tribulation Period it's also the title of the sixth seal right tribulations being poured out and brother Branham said those prophets blow all the trumpets how many remember that the prophets blow all the trumpets during the sixth seal that causes some confusion with some but I'll get to that I'm gonna preach on the whole book of Revelation already got it are you laid out it's already done I just got to preach it but a way to get done with this before I preach it by God's grace all right raise the Lord so here you have the ministry of moses and elijah that's in revelation 11 in revelation 6 that's the tribulation ministry here at the end the rapture of moses and elijah that's the sixth and final rapture right for six raptures Jesus reveals himself to the Jews after that because the red the prophets are gone now Jesus reveals himself to the Jews and sometime after this you have the 144,000 sealed by the Holy Spirit it seems like the 144,000 get martyred and the bad kids destroyed our available Armageddon yeah fire to burn the earth and then we walk upon the ashes of the wicked into the Millennium praise the Lord now the one question I have is when's the rebuilding of the temple that's my question I don't know when that's going to happen I don't know if we'll see it before the rapture or if it all happens or the Tribulation Period I'm not sure I don't know if anybody is sure about that I'm not quite sure brother Branham said that say the Lord it's going to happen okay so I think I'll stop right there if you want my timeline I made that timeline back in 2008 I can always email that to you let's save our feet by God's grace someone told me that smother Graham is drawing I never got confirmed it I heard him on tape he said Becky you drew that the image of Daniel chapter 2 needed he said Becky looks more like a woman than it doesn't man so it seems like that might be the picture because he did say that on the tape I don't know have you ever seen ever Loras okay not sure yet that's what you know when I went to different places on the web that's the one that has said well but this is one brother Graham throughout but somebody else drew it in you know drew it up for us hide it out or something like that praise God you Lord tonight and man I know it's a fast teaching but it's important for us to know that it's important to know what our we're in it you have to know that by God's grace so let me I blood that let's just close with the word prayer here and let's ask God to help us pray this week you know as I said we're coming into our 11th year as a church he'll be that 11 years we've stood 11 years here in Akron ministering all those who want the Word of God so I want to make this a week of prayer and rededication to the ministry that God has given us the set I've gone through a little hard season I'll tell Wendy you know I just feel up and have a lot of rejection I've been feeling a lot of rejection lately I've got to remember they haven't rejected me they rejected Christ is that the sins that I've seen Church I've never told anybody to commit fornication I never told anybody to commit adultery I've never talked to not attend church I've never talked to not pay tithes and offerings I've never taught uh to women to cut their hair or men to wear shorts or to cuss or listen to rap music or rock and roll I've never taught any of these things that people do so I have confidence that I've stayed true to the Word of God hey and I just want to reconsecrate my life rededicate my life I know I've got to answer to one day I had this thought on Wednesday night we read wherever every Minister will give an account of his congregation remember that Wednesday night I don't remember that well the branch said you either do the bible's that you either do it with grief or joy look at this dog just Kennedy this morning Moses 5:00 to answer first congregation how's it going to answer first congregation of grief or joy there's probably going to be a lot of grief two million people and two made in the promised land how about Joshua Joshua can say my group we all crossed over already are you with me Church look at that's talking about my amazing so both men had to be faithful no matter how big the church was in fact the smaller Church had the easier way to get in did another mixed multitude and everybody was circumcised glory everybody was consecrated to the ministry they were hungry for the ministry and I'm going to have to do the same thing for the dottie for the Brooks you don't brother Barry green they got to stand there with their their ministries and either give account of their ministry with grief well I preach to them they just what they were just rebellious like Moses just a rebellious people or die I tried I got upset one time to get me on the promised land they may be so upset Lord forgive me but right but remember that God won't let somebody the promised land with that but Josh will be able to say their brother banging his say all my group made it in by God's grace he'll give account of his congregation with joy George I want to give an account with joy over our church because I know I'm going to have to so let's just pray as Biko's here then let's have a week of prayer if you can't go home tonight you didn't go on your prayer cause if you can pray for this week I just feel like I already know this is my time so get not work this is my time for prayer in your Bible it just naturally built into my life you know and I love it but I really want to do that let's pray if we can by God's grace brother Graham said if there's ever time the church ought to be seeking God and prayer like Daniel did it's bored in heaven we thank you I believe these sermons are very timely Lord I remember the one about the prayer life truly started my prayer life lord I thank you for that just a number of weeks ago more about the prayer life of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that give me such strength that was another pouring out of your blessings day and night you must stay where the Spirit of God is being poured out in our lives so we thank you for that lord help us to pray a humble prayer like Daniel we know we're not under a Jewish nation type of covenant we're under individual covenant but still help us to sign cry for the combinations that we've seen our families sometimes they come and go in our church that we see in the city Lord God that we see on our neighbours do have mercy Lord upon us dear God and as we confess our sins in the sins of others I
