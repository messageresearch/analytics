========================================

god thank you jesus praise god we can be done let's stand we have our bibles uh this evening we'll read our scriptures and then we will have just a little time of prayer as well for these requests why don't we read our scriptures first so let's go to let's go to leviticus 23 i'm gonna continue the series on the jew and gentile church but i'd like to look at the seven feasts of israel tonight and just try to make it to the uh the one we're in right now the feast of weeks i'd like to preach on that and just show the wonderful messages in that series so leviticus 23. verse 23 you know what i'm sorry that's the wrong verse that's the feast of trumpets i was studying on that earlier sorry let's go to uh verse 15. leviticus 23 15. forgive me i was studying on the trumpets because i was trying to answer a little question in my mind today so sorry i had 23 on my mind 15 verse 15. uh lord willing i'll read let me read a few here i'll read 15 16 17 and then we'll go to the memory verse to finish june with brother amen's every verse and sister who if you'd like to do one for july maybe you could think about that or pray about that i'd like to have if you could do one for july we'd like to do that by god's grace so we'll see if you feel that okay so let me read 15 16 17 and you shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering that be the first fruits of the barley harvest seven sabbaths shall be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall be number fifty days so jubilee and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the lord so god is gonna do something new in this fourth feast you shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of ten i'm sorry tenth deals they shall be a fine flower they shall be bacon with leaven they are the first fruits unto the lord praise god so we'll go down to our memory verse isaiah 40 110 and i've seen my children memorizing this one at home so i appreciate that they're quoting that when they have maybe rough nights or hard times at night they're coding isaiah 41 10. so thank the lord for that i appreciate how the lord writes that upon the fleshly tables of their hearts at such young ages that's a good example for us who are getting a little older uh to let the holy spirit write that upon our hearts verse 11. i'm sorry 41 verse 10. sorry 41 verse 10. let's read this together ready one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness praise god now before we pray let's remember a few requests had a little testimony this week yesterday i talked to my mom and uh she said jesse there's a woman there's a young lady having a baby she's uh over two weeks past her due date can you pray for her and i wasn't i wasn't expecting it but i'm like yeah mom pray for her i remember her she used to go to the church i went to when i was a little boy um so we just said a little prayer and uh i got a text this morning saying uh thanks for praying uh for my mom she said that last night uh this the lady had a baby boy and named it zion malachi and they don't even know our names of our children wow so i just thought that was really special so i i just want to thank the lord for that my mom said it was ten pounds eight ounces and that's a big boy right there there's a big boy uh so i thought what a nice uh honor uh my two sons just just interesting you know just interesting how god does things and but just she wanted to thank everybody for you know thank us for our prayers and uh so thank the lord for that just a nice little testimony there i did text mj this week he wants to come when he come hopefully he'll be here sunday he's interested in fasting you know he's in sanctification i don't know if you saw but amen got to talk to him for three hours on sunday after his church three hours they talked from one to four and brother amen was saying you gotta get born again get born again and so mj said uh he said when we come can we talk about maybe fasting as a church and i said oh yeah brother we can talk about that so even if you know just so be prepared in the next week or two if mj comes back you know we can fast maybe everybody can fast to breakfast everybody can fast a lunch or if you can go all three you can do that or just fast a supper and just take some time praying because he he really feels a need to overcome temptations in his life he realizes he's not living as high as we are which is okay we've been in the message longer we've got we've been battling the promised land a little longer he's just trying to get there praise god so just just keep him in prayer and i was a great conversation but amen got to have with him that was so wonderful are there any any other requests have on anyone's heart my mom asked for your prayers she had a surgery and she's still recovering so she asked for everybody's prayers as well anybody have any needs cares all right darling we'll pray for that anyone else have any sister oh yeah sure was that eus i just said we just saw her on saturday okay yeah we'll definitely stand in for prayer and if you feel that or remember at the end of service you can come up and stand in for prayer if you feel led you know i can anoint you with oil if you feel led sometimes you know sometimes brother iran would encourage people when the anointing is at the highest but we know god heals right here as well you know when we pray but just it's just one of those uh it's opportunity to be sensitive to the holy spirit to see which way he might want to bring healing but he could bring healing for it right now so you know but one thing i know is you know you have a real tender heart for your family so beau ma'am says you know you have to sometimes it helps to really feel for the person when you pray for them so god bless you for that i saw a little headline on saturday so let's pray let's pray for abi too and you uh so that the testimony is uh that yua will listen to our sermons on sunday when she goes to her church she actually live streams our sermons that's a real blessing to know that we're ministering she doesn't believe the things that you know her her family goes to you know so she listens to our sermons so thank god let's uh pray for them let's put our heads here for word of prayer heavenly father we've read your word thank you for this eternal truth lord the scriptures cannot be broken that's what you told us lord when you were on earth in a body of flesh you said the scriptures cannot be broken and the prophets were gods whom the word of the lord came to amateur gods in other words anointed with power of the holy ghost not in the fullness like christ but to a measure and god we're thankful lord that today we've received a prophet who had a a measure of the anointing lord we've received his message and we're growing in it lord we're growing in grace and knowledge of the lord and so father we want to give you thanks and praise lord to your son jesus christ for his death burial and resurrection we just sang about it oh praise the name of the lord jesus christ who rose on the third day and who lives ever living now to make intercession for the saints we come by the precious blood of jesus lord

your glory lord in jesus christ's name when the saints said amen god bless you as your being seated praise god so i just i just want to show as we get to this little lesson here i just want to show again uh that slide from sunday so you can switch over the timeline the prophetic timeline um this kind of comes up in the in the book which i have a little update on that the uh i got an email from the editor yesterday and he said i should get the final draft tomorrow but then i got to just make one or two more tweaks on it uh and then i got to add an index so people can find like donald trump's name joe biden's name i put black lives matters in the book i just i tried to bring all the current events up to where we are put cronovirus in there you know just to kind of see where we are here at the end of the seventh church age also brother branham's name and irenaeus and uh patrick and columba all the saints i did a just a long teaching on the church ages i want to have it in the back because i i've bought books in the past and when they have indexes that is so helpful that is one of the greatest helps you can have is to know right where you can't you don't have time to read the whole book but you need to go right to get that information so i got to do that but then hopefully hopefully it'll be uh out in a couple weeks we'll see by god's grace also right now at home i'm uploading the next youtube video it's about clarence larkin it's the longest video i ever did it took me so long i just finished it today it's an hour and 20 minutes proving that brother ram did not plagiarize clarence larkin so i finally got it done i put all the quotes on there so they can see it um so hopefully that'll be a blessing hopefully that will help people as i told you the only thing in future home the only question is in future home brother ram didn't cite anybody but we don't want to jump to the conclusion and say he purposely stole it he didn't purposely steal any information he probably just forgot to cite larkin because he cited larkin in the the church ages he cited him in the 70 weeks he cited him in the seven seals he just forgotten the future home but his emphasis was not on larkin although he used some of larkin's work his emphasis was on the three works of grace aren't you glad for the three works of grace larkin didn't teach the three works of grace i've looked i don't know if you had a chance to look through his books brother have you looked through larkin's books a little bit okay so yeah they're from 1919 and 1920 he wrote a book called the book of revelation and then he wrote a book called dispensational truths and i searched both of them like because you can search electronically for words he never wrote on the three works of grace so when brother am saw the future at home he used at least eight of larkin's teachings but then he showed how it was a it was a it was a type it was a fulfillment of the three works of grace right water blood fire right water blood spirit and so it just seems like brother branham forgot um and so i'm i'm so anyone that denies anyone that calls about the branham a plagiarist uh is either ignorant or they're trying to get people to leave the message on purpose because they got the wrong spirit okay and in the just for example the church ages brother random cited historians over 20 times and they say he's a plagiarist you don't make 20 citations and then say oh this person's a plagiarist in fact i have coached that brother bram said i tried to find all the history i could possibly find he told the brothers the church agencies he said bring all your history books and we'll search it all together we'll find everything that we can from history uh the fact was he just wasn't educated but that's why we love him right because he wasn't educated like the scholars today and those that deny the word of god so we love him because he was humble and he was a real servant of god so let's look at this here tonight you know we'll try to get at least here down to the feast of weeks that's where my goal is because that's that's how it relates to the mystery of the one church of jew and gentile okay so these are uh seven feasts uh given to israel every year they had a a religious year a spiritual year and then a civil year so they had uh these uh these these eight months here of religious year and then they had four months called a civil year and uh god was was giving he was giving a plan of remembrance remember god is the god of memorials praise god that's what i'm gonna work on after i get that video post i'm gonna work on that picture of you and when your dad got healed and everything like that i'm going to work on that next my god's great so i'm going to take a little break from the youtube videos and do some artwork i already bought the crayons and the markers and everything and the colored pencils and get back to doing some artwork so we can remember what god has done uh but uh here we we see that it's it's a it's a memorial to israel but also a prophetic calendar and it's one of the five calendars i showed you remember on sunday i showed you five counters that we can all look at for vision where are we what are we supposed to be doing and so we can see that uh in our calendar here we are in the feast of weeks where the we'd say the last month here we are at the sixth month almost ready for the seventh month it's interesting today's the last day of the six months so just an interesting just a fun little uh it's not a coincidence but it's just a uh just a a probably a sign from the lord right now i got a lot of information from kevin j connor's book called the feast of israel he said all the ceremonies and all that pertains to the letter and ritual of the law are empty in vain apart from the reality of christ so all these things are vain unless you see jesus christ in them and brother man talked about the drink offering and the meal offering and and the passover offering and the token and all that he talked about all that to say that everything pointed to jesus christ and he said if you don't see jesus christ in the scripture go back and read it again right that's the christ the mystery of god reveal that famous quote right so everything was written to point to jesus christ even the parts about evil people that's the judgment of jesus christ amen all right and sinners that's the mercy of that's the longsuffering of jesus christ praise god and so all these things are pointing to christ now under mosaic covenant that we looked at earlier god had three major feasts and two of them had two additional minor feasts for a total of seven feasts now church just a little reminder the word feast doesn't mean like it does to us a feast to israel was a sacred solemn meeting it wasn't like if i say let's have a feast at wingfoot park that's what we did on saturday that's a feast it's laid back it's all just eat as much as you want like that's what i did right drink just drink it whatever drink as much play as much as you want that's not what the feast meant for israel feast was a sacred time it was a holy time it was a divine appointment praise god and so that's why you know these are called even holy convocations solemn assemblies you know and living against 23 we're not going to read it but but the bible details them as all these all these synonyms all these descriptions all pointing to the same thing god wants to meet with his people church arts are glad god wants to meet with you praise god and not just seven times a year but all 365 days amen you know why because you're his temple you're his church you're his tabernacle god walks in you praise god and god speaks through you praise god hallelujah now i want to look at this scripture here uh the bible said three times in a year i'll just read it three times in a year all thy male shall appear before the lord thy god that's jehovah jehovah thy god in the place where he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread oh yeah that's why i put these in yellow because the scripture the scripture is interesting it just names it highlights these as the main names for the feast the unleavened bread so this is the major feast these are the minor which is interesting this is the major this is the major these are the minor interesting that's what god says here in the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles they shall not appear before the lord empty right that's why we bring our praises that's where we bring our tithes that's why we bring our songs to the house of the lord that's why we bring our prayers here let us not come empty amen let's not come with an empty mind let's come full of the praises of god amen ready to sacrifice unto god amen can i get an amen i get a big healthy amen from everybody that that's the part of your sacrifice tonight amen you didn't come empty you brought a word of praise you brought a word of thanksgiving amen don't come empty come to the house of the lord with praise every man shall give as he is able well see brother jesse i'm just not able to sing praises to god we'll shame on you then right you ought to be able to worship god and love god and have joy and peace and forgiveness you ought to feel happy in the lord the joy of the lord as you're able worship the lord amen hallelujah some are more able than others unfortunately praise god right some people don't want to worship the lord but we all should be worshiping the lord we should all be able and willing to give god our best when we gather together praise god see you give as you're able according to the blessing of the lord like god which he has given me praise god amen what a blessing praise god you worship god according to how much he's blessed you praise god oh hallelujah he that's forgiven much love is much he that's forgiven much praises much he that's forgiven much worships enough or worships much praise god that's how we should look at we should see all that he's done for us and be willing to come full of praises and give god based upon what he's done for us according to the blessings of god we ought to pour out of thanksgiving ah thank you jesus amen for all the blessings praise god hallelujah now in leviticus 23 it gives all seven feasts now i'm going to share this i was a little confused somebody told me last year that two of the feasts are not called feasts and i kind of stumbled a little bit on that but that's because i was thinking feast meant party right like we had on saturday and so in the book i got it i got it mixed up so i got to fix it before it goes to print uh because the the the day of trumpets is never caught a feast in the bible it's just called a day of trumpets and the the the day of atonement is never called feast of atonement right but if you read earlier in the chapter it does say all the feasts are holy convocations unto the lord and then it says the day of trumpets and the day of uh and the day of atonement are holy convocations unto the lord so see my this is where i'm just being honest i grow in understanding i don't have it all figured out i don't have all the answers but i can grow in grace and knowledge of the lord and so i'm sorry uh if i've taught that wrong before but they are all seven feasts it's just they're it's a different meaning of feast than what i was thinking it's actually sacred assemblies amen it's holy gatherings it's holy assemblies praise god uh so all seven are listed in leviticus chapter 23 but then you find them you know more about them all throughout the scripture see god said i you have to meet with me on my terms you can't come whenever you want you have to come when i tell you to come it's god's provided place of worship amen hallelujah he said you meet with me here at my place bring the sacrifices i want to be offered and and you are going to abstain from work and focus on your relationship with me praise god amen see they were not to do any work in church let's come to the house of god and not think about work let's think about jesus while we're here praise god for some of us it's easier than others so for me it's very easy for me to forget about work right now because i'm not working but even during the school year i've got to be careful to do that not to think about work but to think about the things of god so god said just leave all your agriculture behind right leave all your farm and your seeds and and your harvesting leave that behind and come appear before me hallelujah forget about the things of the world focus on heaven amen hallelujah and it wasn't optional if these these males had to appear right and that we would say they would be the biggest workers in the field right because god gave men a little more strength right the woman's called the weaker vessel that's no offense to hurts god's desire god has to have a greater god has to have a lesser we're the lesser when it comes to christ right even us brothers are lesser right we're christ is our head so it's it's no shame but god said all the men all the hard workers have to leave off work and appear before me and don't come empty bring all the all the sacrifices and then any extra according to the blessing you've received i don't know so you really found out who really loved god at that time praise god who brought the most blessing or were the most offerings who had the who had the the free will heart to really sacrifice unto the lord right so now you can see the historical the memorial aspect of this but also the prophetic aspect so let's begin with the passover it was the 14th day on the first month it was called the new year at the evening now remember jewish days start at sundown so as soon as we start seeing the sun down it's priority going down this is actually the start of thursday for jews it's already thursday now for us it's wednesday right it goes from sun sun down to sundown that's a day right so for them they've already started a thursday but we're still on wednesday so we got to keep that in mind right so that's why jesus had to die before the sun went down he didn't die on the friday right so part of that day all day saturday and then raised on sunday so he had to be die and raised within three days right just like jonah was in the heart of the art of the fish three days three nights so uh here they had they met on this 14th day each family sacrificed one one one-year-old male lamb and they ate a meal the lamb along with unleavened bread this was a memorial of god delivering them from egyptian slavery and there's many places that talk about this like exodus 12 leviticus 23 deuteronomy 16. the purpose the prophetic purpose was fulfilled in jesus's death on calvary and he fulfilled the details to the letter he died both for jew and gentiles praise god did it did it uh there was a mixed multitude that came out of egypt right gentiles hallelujah there was jew and gentile see the lamb brought out both amen hallelujah and the bible says in first john 2 verse 2 jesus christ is the propituation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world remember propitiation is a wrath bearer or a wrath taker a wrath appeasement so god has no wrath against you as long as you're trusting in jesus christ god's wrath is not for you god's favors for you god's blessing is for you don't worry about the wrath of god trust in the favor of god jesus is the propitiation which is the same word for mercy jesus is your mercy seat amen he took the blood praise god he took the wrath the wrath was put on him the blood was sprinkled on him that we will be condemned we'll be forgiven praise god hallelujah he delivered us from all slavery of sin just like they got delivered from egypt's slavery so church don't be a slave to sin tonight you'll battle it but overcome it keep resisting the devil he'll flee from you praise god don't be a slave to it don't go from week to week you're still a slave stop the slavery you're free man your free woman the lamb has set you free don't be a slave be a free child in jesus name hallelujah all slavery we're delivered from and paul says in first corinthians 5 7 we keep the fact the passover now which means we're partaking of the lord's supper in remembrance of him right so just like they would eat the bitter herbs and they would eat that meal and and they knew death was going to pass over them we're doing the same thing tonight amen we're feasting on the good word or the bitter word of god right and sometimes it's hard sometimes it's difficult we're feasting on that but where we have anticipation praise god amen we have anticipation that the the death angel is going to pass over us amen because we're sighing and crying for the abominations done in this city we're going to be marked by god but the passover the death angel will pass over us and we will go in the third exodus amen they win the first exodus pentecost was the second we go in the third death is gonna the tribulation will pass after us amen we're gonna meet christ in the air oh that's exactly right but see we're spiritually keeping the passover now praise god so it's like we're keeping these four praise god and these three last three all deal with israel well i'm sorry these two this deals with us as well that's us because that's the millennium okay now let's move on to the unleavened bread i was gonna try to make some good progress here i didn't even set my timer so let me set my timer now all right unleavened bread now beginning on the evening of the passover this bread feast lasted seven days emphasizing a diet totally separate from leaven so you had to do a whole week with no leaven right so just unleavened bread it represented israel partaking of no egyptian influences because leaven puffs up an entire lump of dough right it'll make the whole thing puff up and puffing up represents pride right puffing up you're puffed up in pride any israeli with leaven found in his house was instantly cut off from the congregation right that's pretty serious what if i come over to your house and i what if i just surprised you and knocked on the door and i found one uh what could i say i found one evil thing in your house what what an evil magazine or what what a magazine with one bad word or one bad picture what if i looked at your bookshelf and i found one picture that was wrong in your book and you say oh you're cut off from the church that's pretty serious they couldn't have one speck of leaven not one speck of pride not one speck of the world amen because it was speaking of jesus christ amen speaking of christ had no sin right but once in the promised land they were to explain this feast to their children in memory of god's mighty hand to deliver them so they had passover or the first night and then they had unleavened bread here okay now this jesus fulfills this again his death separates us from our sins so the lamb died and they had no leaven jesus christ died he had no leaven praise god he took all the lev all the leaven was put away hallelujah amen it separated us from our sins or leaven his blood washed away all sins just as the jewish houses were washed free from all leaven amen he's the true bread of heaven all christians feast upon we're all feasting on unleavened bread tonight amen if you read that bible if you heard this bible and you believed it you're eating unleavened bread tonight amen because that's what paul said paul said that we keep the spiritual feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven a mouse and wickedness see you can't eat jesus and have mouse and wickedness in your heart amen that's 11. but when you eat christ he's unleavened praise god and you won't have mouth you'll forgive and you won't do wickedness you live holy now we're feasting on unleavened bread praise god hallelujah that's feasting on christ the word amen see we but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth i'll tell you church sometimes i wish people could step in the place of a minister because i have to be deadly sincere like i don't know when people are going to come up for prayer like brother johnny came up for prayer he had an infection in his ankle on uh for last five days he didn't tell me he just come up for prayer now you talk about being sincere he's like just he said brother jesse we have faith just curse this infection and i'll be made well now brother william that made me really sincere right because i know people are struggling and can hardly walk for four or five days now he said after he went back to see he said he felt healed so praise the lord i haven't texted him this week but that's just an example of how i've really got to keep my sincerity that's why i can't eat on a sunday morning i know about you guys i mean that's fine for you but i've got to be sincere i've got to be deadly sincere the bible said keep this feast with sincerity and truth praise god i never know when people are going to come up here and have all these needs and i got really got to be sincere i really got to be honest and i i got a i got to mean business right i can't say oh mr devil could you please move sir could you please i you don't talk to devils like that you rebuke satan jesus rebuked him and said get behind me amen get thee behind hallelujah amen sincerity that's what i like to you know brother that's what i like to call sisters that's what i call i like to call some of you up to pray for people sometimes because it makes all of us more sincere because your prayers are just as powerful as mine are right now we might have different gifts but when we all pray together when we praise the body of believers oh heaven is moved praise god he delights in the prayers of the saints amen but see that when you're sincere and you come with a truthful heart to church you're keeping the feast of unleavened bread so you're not eating leavened bread you're not eating sinful things i'm not preaching sinful things tonight am i i don't believe so i'm not allowing you to uh to feast on the things of the world i'm not i'm not gonna allow you to be a worldly christian i'm not gonna allow myself to be a worldly christian i want us to all eat together amen the passover meal and the feast of unleavened bread let's feast on the holy things of god amen that's why we're here praise god it'll make you deadly sincere and then times and then i get tested too and people don't get well right away oh that's a real mind battle right there that's so that makes you even pray more during the week oh god help them lord you know give me patience right how many how many have the faith of abraham help me to wait 25 hours right he raided 25 years god helped me to wait 25 hours to get the victory i hope you understand i'm just talking realistic tonight praise god now the next one is the sheep of first fruits this is the final feast of the first month it was on the day after the sabbath following the passover so the third day after the third day you had passover unleavened bread and then you had first fruits a priest waved a sheaf like this a sheaf of barley first roots before the lord as a forerunner the rest of the crop would later mature for harvest also they had a lamb burnt offering did you know that a lamborgh offering a lamb had to be fully consecrated on the resurrection jesus was fully dedicated amen hallelujah a total burnt offering the lamb of god hallelujah ever lives to make intercession amen oh my and also a meal and drink offering so jesus christ also on his resurrection was a meal a thank offering and a drink offering as well oh hallelujah weren't they we're all thankful right they're all thankful on the resurrection day praise god now here this foreshadowed the resurrection of christ the greatest day in human history this was on the sunday the first day of the week the bible says this was fulfilled when god waved his resurrected son his first fruit son his resurrected son before israel as the firstborn from the dead jesus christ is the first begotten from the dead amen this is the first matter of harley from the seed first god and god wave jesus amen god wave jesus he's the first fruit is god he's the first fruits from the dead god waiting before israel hallelujah and this demonstrates all believers would have a resurrection at harvest time or the end of the world romans 8 11 promises us that the spirit that raised christ from the dead will quicken also our mortal bodies but the bible says notice we're raised from the dead in his own order everybody's got a different order praise god we don't like weight in church but listen everybody's got to order we can't all be like enoch right we can't all be like elijah everybody's got to order they've got to be raising so let's be thankful as long as i'm somewhere in that order it don't matter to me as long as i'm in there somewhere i want to have an order where i'm resurrected to life amen how today i'm resurrected to sit with christ in his throne amen in that order don't worry about your order just worry about having the life of christ in you praise god that's the main thing make sure you're really uh a mature christian praise god that's the main thing now the wave sheath and the other offering speak of his death and resurrection because they're inseparable like all these had to be on that that that sunday or that monday i'm sorry that sunday rather that first day of the week so the burn offering represents jesus's death through total obedience and also his constant total consecration in life and the meal offering and drink offering speak of their continual communion with christ through the lord's supper right because didn't he show up on that sunday night didn't he show up with his disciples he broke into the room and he proved he said give me something to eat give me something to drink right there he is there's the drink offering there's a thank offering there he is right communing with the people oh i'm so glad he communes with us as well amen in the holy spirit now here we are feast of weeks now we'll get to here and i'm good i'm doing good on time praise god now we skip ahead to the feast of weeks this is the third month or 50 days after uh first fruits now in feast of the trumpets brother ram this is the one time he says there's mix-up on the tapes he said this was uh he said this was seven months but it was seven weeks so if you listen carefully brother ram even fixes it later in questions and answers in 1964. but he said see it's seven it's seven he said it's seven months representing seven church changes and so he said i got a little mix up he said i'll probably hear about it he said but remember he said look in the bible amen hallelujah but great advice from a prophet of god i make mistakes there's mix-ups on the tapes but there's no mix-ups in the bible praise god amen and i was thinking more the more i thought about it johnny's statement on sunday the more i liked it you know i asked the jeffersonville people all these questions they have no answers and it's just like the pharisees jesus they said jesus uh i forgot their question they asked jesus do you guys remember but jesus said well let me ask you a question was john's baptism of men or was it from god and they said we can't tell right we can't tell so jesus said neither or do i tell you what you asked me that's the same thing i asked i asked joseph uh does the third person the trinity dwell in your hearts he basically said i believe every word on the tape is thus saith the lord in other words i can't tell well i can tell the third person a third god does not dwell in william the one god dwells in brother william amen there's not three gods there's not three persons there's one person the holy person the holy spirit praise god amen i can tell you the answer to that one but they can't tell you the answers because they don't have them because they're deceived the bible says you're deceived right because we worship in spirit and in truth they don't have truth they don't even know what the truth is right they have some truth but not all truth we should be guided into all truth by the holy spirit hallelujah some guy tried to correct me on the youtube yesterday and he said well brother you shouldn't call names like that uh brother brahm never called church names they never called names i said brother have you ever heard of brother brock and brother gilmore brother branham balls them out they were pastors in arizona brother branham balled them out he said i he said nothing against you he said but your churches are denominated and he names the name of their churches the first assembly of god and family assembly of god brother random names their church names on the tape and i said my dear brother i hope you'll look this up but brother random when he was led by the holy spirit he called names to try to bring some correction praise god and the bible said mark them that cause divisions praise god who's been causing division since 2001 with here i stand it's jeffersonville they've been causing they've dividing people well you can print tapes and you can't they've been dividing since truth at least 2001 and now they're dividing if you don't play tapes you're not the royal seat of abraham let me tell you you are not the judge of who the royal seat of abraham the holy spirit is the judge of who is the royal seat of abraham and the holy spirit vindicates their word with truth amen and they've got answers and they're guided into all truth and they've got the real holy spirit praise god not lies yeah i'd probably say the same thing brother william i probably say the same well if i if i was deceived i'd say the same thing well i don't know you know why because millions of dollars are being funneled into me that's what it's all about always money why the pharisees get upset because jesus was going to shut down their denomination they're going to lose their income they're going to use their lose their paychecks they're going to lose their retirement funds oh yeah it's all connected it's all connected to money it's always connected to money now god knows our hearts tried to correct we've asked for all these things god knows our hearts i just i didn't that wasn't that was not my notes but just as a representation you know a lot of people need that church there's a lot of people struggling with that right there's a lot of people that for whatever reason brother william they just don't have much discernment that means they're still out there in the wilderness they haven't entered into all these battles in the promised land praise god they can't handle this good mature corn yeah amen hallelujah they don't really want to see they don't want to fight amen but we're fighters amen hallelujah we're warriors we can hold the sword of the land we're not as scared of a spiritual battle because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world praise god amen hallelujah we're not some complaining babies out in the wilderness got to baby them to come to church and baby them to pray and read their bible baby them to study the doctrine and baby them to search the scriptures you don't gotta baby us we're already fighting for it we're fighting for it every day praise god hallelujah we're on the front lines every single day amen let's not be babies right let's be mature warriors oh thank you jesus praise god now pentecost or feast of weeks third month it was 50 days after first fruits 50 represents deliverance liberty freedom for israel because every 50 years they celebrated the jubilee year slaves were released from bondage debts and all inheritance were restored to their original owners all that's forgiven every 50 years oh my goodness i wish that was in my life right i was i wish the dead of my house would be would be all taken away well the difference is i didn't have the house in my family beforehand so it actually doesn't fit that type right you had to already be in your family for you to inherit it and be forgiven of the debt right so it don't really fit for us today it's not the same system now moses brought israel out on following the passover and they worshiped god at mount sinai did you know this they went to mount sinai and they were there on the 50th day after the passover did you know that what would they get what are they gonna sign it they got the law what happened at pentecost they got the law of the holy ghost right so is mount sinai and day of pentecost are both 50 days after an exodus hallelujah so there was there was lightning and thunder and black cloud and noise and fire at mount sinai there was wind of the holy ghost they were speaking in tongues there was fire on the day of pentecost because god's spiritual law was being brought down to earth amen not in law but in liberty praise god amen hallelujah i'm so glad that fire's inside of me praise god amen hallelujah see there the fire was outside now for us the fire's inside oh thank you jesus 50 days power and the presence of god undeniable they got the 10 commandments we got the holy ghost written upon the fleshy tables of our hearts hallelujah we got the word on our hearts amen they got it on the stones now once they got into canaan at pentecost they had numerous sacrifices they had two loaves of bread bake with leaven we'll get to that a little bit way before the lord and then they brought the following free will gifts this was the feast of bringing free will gifts right so whatever you want to give in your free will whatever you want to give god from your heart you bring it during this feast this is the long feast so bring any of these free will offerings burnt offering meat offering drink offering sin and peace offerings so god said bring any of those any of the sacrifices and bring them at the feast of pentecost bring anything from your heart whatever you want to give god from your heart bring it ah church anything we want to give god let's give to god amen this is the time to do it praise god this is the time to pour out our hearts a parole of thanksgiving to make ourselves a burnt offering for christ amen this is our time to do it whatever the free will is praise god remember god will bless you according to your free will offerings people say oh i'm always short on money because you're not giving enough away right the reason you're lacking is because you're you're keeping too much and you're not giving away because if you give god loves a cheerful giver and he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek god so if you if you're tied on money many times too selfish it's free will offering absolutely see so this feast marks the beginning of a four month long harvest one two three four four and there's four beasts i just caught that brother there's four beasts four anointings oh my goodness gracious that's a good one i remember that one four four months there's four anointings amen and the last one's the ego praise god oh my four months thank you jesus see and it was to harvest most but not all the crops because the poor and the stranger have to have a little bit of food don't harvest everything leave a little left over so the strangers make sure there's a little bit of of wheat left over at the end for strangers and sojourners so everybody can find a little bit of wheat hallelujah i'm glad praise god now acts chapter 2 fulfills the feast of weeks the day of pentecost this was spiritual freedom spiritual liberty for the souls of men by the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said go away in uh jerusalem until you're endued with power he said you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence you shall you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you do you feel the power you ought to have power in your soul if you've been to pentecost if you've been in the feast of weeks you've got power in your soul amen hallelujah you you know god is with you you've got authority praise god because he's living inside of you oh hallelujah he said you'll be a witness unto me both in jerusalem judea samara under the uttermost parts of the earth had my jesus had on today at lowe's and i got another chance to witness as a witness there's this woman and she was getting out of line of old woman i said oh can i go ma'am and she said oh yeah she said of course i'm gonna let jesus go before me because i had my jesus head on i said oh thank you amen and i almost forgot i looked and said now man the reason i wear this is because god healed my mom a cancer she's like wow she said sister she called her older sister she's an older woman too come over here this man's testimony and so i got to share what god did and i hope it raised their faith by god's grace see we're witnesses we shall be witnesses unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen even here at akron praise god we're witnesses of the power of god amen hopefully the next time they're sick they'll remember that testimony now here let me show you uh kevin connor has a list he has a chart with two columns in his book showing the similarities between mount sinai and the day of pentecost the upper room so at sinai they have thunder lightnings thick clouds fire audible voice at pentecost they're the prince of god rushing mighty wind licks of fire speaking in tongues mount sinai had of the 50th day right and then mount uh and then the pentecost was near mount zion on the 50th day it wasn't on mount zion but it's near mount so both of them were near mountains uh at at mount sinai it was the birthday of judaism it was the birth of the old covenant at the day of pentecost it was the church's birthday praise god the holy spirit got sprinkled they were enjoying to the covenant through the anointing of the holy spirit praise god hey i'm so glad i'm joined to that covenant amen he sprinkled me and he's filled me with this anointing praise god amen hallelujah i'm not outside the covenant i'm joined to the covenant i'm sprinkled with the anointing it's upon me i see it upon me praise god you see it on you we ought to be thankful we have a part of an everlasting covenant praise god they have the laws of stone written by the finger of god we have the word on fleshy tables hearts written by the spirit of god hallelujah at sinai 000 souls died at pentecost 3 000 souls were baptized amen on at sinai it was the ministration of death through the law of sin and death on the day of pentecost it was the ministration of life through the law of the holy spirit at sinai the glory was on moses's face at pentecost the glory of god they saw the glory of god in the face of jesus christ the bible says amen hallelujah in other words the holy spirit at sinai moses's face veiled the people so they could not see the glory at pentecost the believers have unveiled faces to be changed into the same glory of christ see he veiled it but now ours are unveiled and now you see the anointing of god on our faces didn't stephen have a face like an angel glory church when we're under that anointing our faces look different praise god at sinai the glory was to be done away with and at pentecost the glory remains and that's all from second corinthians chapter three i preached on that a few weeks ago i preached on that what was i preaching on though now i'm gonna quiz myself here what was i preaching on it i can't remember forgive me something i was building i'd use that as a start [Music] some thought can't remember that oh from glory to glory there it is thank you jesus thank you because at the end it says we go from glory to glory right that's that's the chapter talks about moses and the old testament now we have the new testament uh glory okay let me try to finish up here by god's grace now when i say that that means 15 minutes okay right so i think i think i'll figure that out on sunday okay so give me 15 more minutes now the most unique aspect of this feast compared to the first three was now they're waving 11 infused loaves of bread and this is the revelation of the jew gentile church composing one body did you see that how these two loaves were a new meat offering unto the lord in the previous three they never had a meat offering like this now you can have the leaven in the bread and the gu and god was waving two loaves before the people before it was the priest waving one right just waving uh seeds right seed mature seed but now you have seed that's been ground up right mature seed ground up and infused with sin i mean leaven now you have genuine wheat seed infused with sin that ought to sound pretty familiar to us right you have the deity of god i mean the weed of god plus the sin or leaven of the world mixed together and god is waving two loaves that are identical god's waving both of them before the people saying this is a new feast i'm doing something new praise god amen there's a season where uh the bread of god is infused with leaven it's the longest season of the year praise god and i'm doing something new praise god these two loaves are actually called one offering brother william these they weren't called two offerings it was one offering two loaves have become one offering two people have become one body jew gentile two groups have become one body paul says this first corinthians 10 17 if you haven't read this it works really it's beautiful it just ties in perfectly i'll read it to you he says for we being many are one bread it's one offering he's speaking to corinthians though which are gentiles but he said we are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread hallelujah and again paul says having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments containing ordinances for to make himself of twain one new man so making peace he takes two men and brings them together and fuses them together and makes one man so when the priest waved two loaves of israel he foretold god waving both spirit-filled jews and gentiles before the world the first loaf was waived was the 120 born-again jewish christians on the day of pentecost now remember these were jews from gentile nations right right and samaritans now they count as gentiles right because the jews would have nothing to do with them because they were half jew they weren't whole jews right so the holy ghost fell on jews and the holy ghost fell on gentiles samaritans see so god was waving both jew and gentile he was waving them before the people these are two separate loaves but it's one offering it's one body praise god they are the same substance is that right church how many believe you're the same substance as peter well i heard a three amends oh now it's pretty good you're the same peter said to the lame man rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ are we the same substance oh yeah when it's god's time to do it praise god when it's god's time to heal we are the same substance did peter discriminate yeah even after he had the holy ghost there's that 11 coming out of him right sometimes 11 is seen in our lives right it's obvious well he's got 11. brother jesse's not perfect he makes mistakes that's that's true i i've leaven infused in me but i also got wheat infused in me don't forget i got weak too you've got wheat too you might have some lemon but thank god you got weed praise god amen thank god you're a genuine original seed of god amen hallelujah which eleven and boy i'd really like to get the leaven out of this bread brother william but ain't gonna happen to the rapture when i get a new body praise god because that lemon's gonna be swallowed up and unleavened in unleavened nature amen hallelujah thank god this is called new because before leaven was forbidden and you're excommunicated if you had leaven before all the other feasts no leaven no lemon you're crazy if you have 11. now it's 11's okay 11 is part of the plan of god 11 infused church is what i'm gonna weigh before the people i'm gonna be glorified in two loaves i'm gonna be glorifying the jews i'm gonna be glorified the gentiles despite their shortcomings jesus christ died to save me and then take me as a witness and weigh me before acronym waive him for my family weigh me as a sacrifice i'm part of the body of christ amen god's waving you before your family that don't believe that don't have the baptism holy ghost he's waving you in your leaven condition oh thank god he forgives us amen thank god we have weed inside of us thank god for his mercy it's his choice to wave us before the people not ours it's his amen these are his feasts not ours i didn't ask to come to this message by the way message came and got me praise god you turned in to ask for it you were born into it because god wanted god wanted you in it praise god so don't leave it stay with it praise god it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you wait till you get older you'll see it when you start meeting somebody literally starting to meet some friends over there at her job she's seeing people that uh weren't born into the holiness of god right lydia cussing and swearing and throwing apples at each other and all kinds of evil teenagers stuff you know it's teenager stuff but lydia don't partake in that because she's a different breed she's a different kind of seed she's a weed seed amen she got a little bit of lemon in there right but she she got a lot of wheat in there too praise god hallelujah it's a new offering before no leaven now leaven is what i'm waving before the people wheat and leaven before the people before you're excommunicated no leaven because i was speaking of christ christ had no sin christ nobody who's worthy to loose the seals nobody no laughing amen hallelujah no there's no never allowed whoever looses that book you've got to have no leaven and john's crying and everybody's crying everybody's weeping everybody's searching who where is there no leaven and all of a sudden the lamb steps out no leaven praise god the unleavened lamb praise god he steps out he's worthy to take the seals and loose them thereof praise god the man with no leaven the unleavened lamb i can say it like that i have area he was worthy that's the one they were looking for i said like that that's one i'll say like this that's one we're looking for he's coming back in the clouds the unleavened lamb is coming back praise god so see these two loaves with leaven represent the new testament church we have a sin nature combined with a divine nature now church we sin but if you got your bible go to romans 6 14. i'll try to get there as soon as i can church we sin but here's the real proof you're a holy ghost-filled saint romans 6 4 no 14 yeah i'm sorry i'm going too fast here's the difference here's how you know you're born again it's just another one of those just piled onto one of your evidence scriptures for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace you have 11 inside of you but it does not dominate your life church i know what it's like to be dominated by drugs i know what it's like i was there i know what it's like to be dominated by cussing and dirty shows and sports and worshipping and hatred i know what it's like to be dominated but i'm no longer dominated by that the holy ghost dominates that we're still going to have leaven but that leaven will not reign over us we will reign over that praise god amen we will have dominion in other words christ will shortly put the serpent under our feet praise god the devil will shortly bruise under your feet don't be a slave to sin overcome a sin be a slave to christ amen that's a real proof you got the holy ghost sin does not rule our lives like let me just say this a few years ago we had brothers coming younger brothers that have now left and fallen away well you know what you know what ruled their life marijuana ruled their life it would keep them from coming to church uh they couldn't sleep because of marijuana they couldn't eat as much because of marijuana that had dominion but see we have dominion over that that doesn't impact us right that doesn't that that marijuana and when they smoked it determined everything they could do work and in church or not and then uh how much they ate and they got hungry and that that rule that basically that demon ruled their life that's witchcraft oh any administration of drugs is witchcraft so i don't know if they played a ouija board i don't know if they went to finger or tarrot car people or what but it's a form of witchcraft but see that had dominion and it ruled their lives and can't keep jobs and can't keep relationships but see the holy ghost in our lives rules and has dominion over all this leaven amen and so we have steady relationships we have we have steady church attendance we're steady on the job nobody's steady like a christian praise god because he is the holy ghost has dominion over his life amen hallelujah that's just a common example sin shall not have dominion over you i can point at each one of you sin will not have dominion over you the leaven won't dominate your life the wheat will dominate your life because your bread hallelujah your one bread see our daily lives are dominated by the baptism of the holy ghost see you present and give your lives as offerings unto god during this new testament season this four month long season this four beasts long season can i say like that that's glorious hallelujah i feel some stimulation revelation tonight amen the joy of the lord praise god that's what brother said it was amen the joy of the lord amen i love when the bible opens up like that oh that's beautiful praise god and brother said those beasts are thus saith the lord you know he said that they are thus saith the lord that means it's thus saith the lord we are flying with the eagle anointing above the cares of the world the cares of the world will not bring us down i could care less i'm an eagle i can fly way above that praise god i'm an eagle i'm anointed to do that praise god i've got power to do that amen that's thus saith the lord we've got that power let's tap into that power let's live above these things sin shall not have dominion over you eagle and you ain't just an eagle you're a flying eagle i don't know so start flying eagles don't let sin have dominion over you have dominion over it some things i want to say man maybe i better save them just kind of want to do some rebuking but i think i hold off on that one i better hold off because the time church so leaven is a common representation of evil and sin see we are new creatures just like it was a new me offering the bible says we're new creatures yet paul says sin dwells in my members so i've got sin in here but i've also got christ in here i've got two different natures in here i've got leaven and i've got wheat right and the scripture says paul is as bold to i'm sorry john is so bold to say whosoever is born of god does not commit sin think about that for his seed remaineth in him his wheat remains in him so god's not looking at the leaven god's looking at the wheat the seed the seed doesn't sin the seed's not leaven god's not looking at the leaven the leaven just makes it the size it is right god's looking at the seed john goes so far to say don't be discouraged about the leaven just confess 11 11. it doesn't have a big dominion over you it's not a big real it's not a real big feature in your life right it's not a big uh it's not a big problem because i've got wheat inside of me i've got christ inside of me the seed of god dominates my life amen my life is dominated by obedience my life's not dominated by disobedience and and sinfulness my life is dominated not with mouse and wickedness but with sincerity and truth praise god see that that's what you're dominated by being a sincere truthful christian john says that's the real you the wheat is you the leaven was added for a testimony the leaven was added for a witness unto all people right you would never be unleavened like christ because that was a special one-time offering less standard our feet i better stop right there that's my 15 minutes i'm closing christ's church will always have an element of sin but we're given the holy ghost to bring unity to other christians through the power of the spirit the power of the seed i love what schofield says let me read this scofield talks about the two loaves here's what he says observe it is now loaves not a sheaf of separate gross loosely bound together so at first fruits it was just a sheaf of loosely bound seeds right on the stalks they're loosely bound he said now it's loaves but now it's a real union of particles making one homogeneous body that's why william can fly a thousand miles over here and he's one with us because it doesn't matter the distance we're all one body praise god he can amen one day over there two days later he can amen and shout and sing and give god praise right here because we are one real unified body amen that's why in one day i can fly down to south america because i get there within six or eight hours and i can preach and the power of the holy ghost can fall there just like it falls here and they ha they talk english brother but i can hardly understand them it's just like it's like it's like spanish to me i can't understand but they can understand me well i don't need an interpreter down there you know but we can we can cross those lines because we're no longer separate particles we are all one body he said the descent of the spirit at pentecost united the separated disciples into one organism at pentecost god united the souls of christians through the baptism of the holy ghost causing them to have one heart and one soul and this same unity spread to the samaritans and then it spread to corniness and when they brought back news of the gentiles they get the holy ghost they acted the same way they said praise the lord we're all one body we're all one substance we're not all separate particles we're all one musicians you can come church that's why i can come to church wednesday after wednesday sunday after sunday because i'm one with the people of god i know without you i'm incomplete and i know without me you're incomplete we're one body we can't move on without each other we can't grow more in love with god without each other like it or not we're stuck together amen like it or not we're baked together church hallelujah now if i get off the word you can vote me out of course you know i would never want to get off the word because i want to stay one with you i want to stay one with all of god's people that's why we don't have separate agendas when we come to church we all got one one agenda to see christ exalted to see christ have dominion in your life to see christ have dominion in your lives sin will not have dominion over us and how do you get dominion repent hate your sin right and have the zeal the bible said if you really repent the zeal of god will come upon you if the bible said what revenge what zeal and you'll cast down everything that exalted so the next time satan comes around you say get behind me satan i'm not giving into that i've got power i'm a new creature in christ jesus you won't have dominion over me boy you devil you won't have dominion over me i've got dominion over you get behind me in the name of jesus christ let's buy our heads here wow what a beautiful revelation that is church my goodness i didn't finish it but either way yes we're one of the spirit tonight [Music] you can select
