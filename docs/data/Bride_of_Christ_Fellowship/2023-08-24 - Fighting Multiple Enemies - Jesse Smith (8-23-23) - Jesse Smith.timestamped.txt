[0:00] relied by God's grace and live streamers
[0:03] if you're from our church we'll have
[0:04] communion Lord willing on Sunday I'm not
[0:06] sure if it'll be amen I say Amen am or
[0:09] p.m I'm sure amen will be there by God's
[0:11] grace so a part of me
[0:14] a little tired today I got up you know I
[0:15] tried to go to bed early and then I just
[0:17] wake up early so I woke up at like 4 50
[0:18] this morning couldn't go back to bed
[0:21] but we're making it by God's grace it's
[0:23] going to be a good good service here so
[0:25] we're looking at our sermon title as
[0:27] fighting multiple enemies our text was
[0:29] with Jehoshaphat
[0:30] I want to read a little bit on the
[0:32] background here John Gill uh the
[0:35] preacher from the 1800s says this
[0:39] he says Jehoshaphat having notice of a
[0:42] numerous Army coming against him he
[0:45] takes himself to fasting in prayer with
[0:48] his people
[0:49] so I'll get to more on John Gill's
[0:52] statements later on but we see the
[0:54] background is with King Jehoshaphat he's
[0:56] the Israelite King one of the few good
[0:58] Kings of Israel right because most were
[1:00] not good Kings there were no good Kings
[1:03] of Northern Israel the only good kings
[1:05] were from Judah and Jehoshaphat was one
[1:08] of those Judah Kings we'd say now church
[1:11] if you read there in the scripture
[1:13] there's at least three groups that come
[1:15] against him now imagine
[1:16] you just don't have to fight one enemy
[1:18] not just two but three or maybe more
[1:22] some commentaries think more
[1:24] now you think one would be enough right
[1:25] oh my here's War again right Another War
[1:28] another battle it's kind of like uh we
[1:30] get we we get uh to a spot in our lives
[1:32] we feel relaxed we feel Victory we feel
[1:34] like we're on the Mountaintop and here
[1:36] comes another battle
[1:38] but
[1:39] like brother Brandon and I we talked
[1:41] about we you've heard it uh said it
[1:42] before we're either in a battle coming
[1:44] out of the battle or coming to a battle
[1:46] right it's one of those
[1:48] so wherever you find yourself you know
[1:50] be encouraged you know Israel found them
[1:52] spot themselves in a spot they were
[1:54] having peace but then enemies invaded
[1:56] them
[1:58] and sea church that's sometimes how
[1:59] we'll we'll go through our lives you
[2:01] know we'll be doing everything right and
[2:03] then the enemy will attack us it'll be
[2:06] like Joe right job is doing everything
[2:07] right he was praying for his children he
[2:10] was making sacrifices for the children
[2:11] praise God he was given wise words to
[2:14] all those that would come and sit at his
[2:15] feet he was helping the widows he was
[2:17] helping the poor he was helping he was
[2:19] helping everybody helping the fatherless
[2:20] but then God was bragging on job in
[2:24] heaven and he didn't know it praise God
[2:25] right if he had known that that probably
[2:27] would have helped him in his battle but
[2:29] God knows what we can handle he won't
[2:31] give us nothing that we can't handle
[2:32] praise God Amen but there he finds
[2:35] himself on multiple battles his family
[2:37] right his money and then his health so
[2:40] three areas and then his relationship
[2:42] his wife right even his wife
[2:45] imagine losing all your money imagine
[2:47] losing uh your children or I mean just
[2:49] this was these would be some of the most
[2:51] terrible enemies you could ever face
[2:53] spiritually
[2:54] right right or naturally or a
[2:56] combination
[2:57] but job is able to fight Hallelujah and
[3:00] we know how he gets Victory praise God
[3:02] hallelujah he gets Victory by not
[3:04] quitting amen amen amen he gets Victory
[3:06] by not cursing God hallelujah
[3:09] he gets Victory by we'd say toughing it
[3:11] out right
[3:13] just getting to just get through it
[3:14] praise God just keep asking call upon
[3:17] God I love it God even in the midst of
[3:19] his suffering God will send Revelation
[3:21] certain Revelation here he says I know
[3:23] my redeemer liveth praise God and I'll
[3:25] stand with him all day on the earth
[3:27] praise God Hallelujah in this body I'll
[3:30] see God hallelujah
[3:32] and God keeps him encouraged
[3:34] and I love it he cries out to God he
[3:36] said I just wish I could talk to God
[3:37] face to face then God comes down and
[3:40] talks to him praise God
[3:41] in a whirlwind
[3:43] and so we see we we see uh some of these
[3:45] keys to Victory when you're fighting all
[3:47] these battles cry out to God
[3:50] don't quit all right just continue in
[3:53] the faith
[3:54] try to stay positive amen
[3:56] right we saw with Joe I preached on that
[3:58] a couple years ago he went from negative
[4:00] to positive negative to positive finally
[4:02] he got on the positive Hallelujah yeah
[4:05] yeah trust God give God praise in the
[4:07] midst of the trial
[4:09] but here Joseph and Israel gets attacked
[4:13] they get invaded by at least three
[4:14] armies
[4:16] right I thought about that too you know
[4:18] we battled the lust of the eyes of pride
[4:20] of life lust of the flesh it's a great
[4:22] it's a great uh spiritual type for us
[4:25] Not only was it the moabites
[4:28] the ammonites
[4:32] John Gill
[4:34] right the syrians hired somebody to come
[4:36] and uh pay them back for what Israel did
[4:39] at Ramos Gilead
[4:42] now friends remember Moab and Ammon were
[4:45] descendants of lot
[4:49] right and what how did a lot have
[4:51] children remember that most of them died
[4:52] but he had children through his
[4:54] daughters the incest Acts or act
[4:58] and and luck with that you know look
[5:00] look what a compromising life allows
[5:03] look what it look what happens in a in a
[5:05] life of a compromiser like lot and yet
[5:07] the Bible said he was a judgment
[5:10] so we know he must have repented praise
[5:12] God
[5:12] yes right now I know we know his
[5:14] daughter's got him drunk and everything
[5:15] like that but still the fact that you'd
[5:16] get drunk
[5:18] right of course they didn't have the
[5:20] Holy Ghost like we got it today
[5:21] but look but look where it comes out it
[5:23] comes out of people that should have
[5:25] known right he knew the prophet's
[5:27] message
[5:28] lot knew the prophet Abraham praise God
[5:31] should have looked for the promised son
[5:33] but because he was a compromiser look at
[5:36] the fruits of his life It produced
[5:38] moabites and ammonites and it always
[5:42] comes back to hunt right well he's come
[5:44] back to hunt
[5:47] of course the Arabians there were
[5:50] uh heathens we'd say as far as We Know
[5:53] by the scripture
[5:54] and so he's not just attacked by one
[5:56] enemy not just two but three
[6:01] and so what does it drive a real
[6:02] believer to do go to church
[6:06] fast and pray amen the church said
[6:09] when you're facing trials on every side
[6:12] you got nowhere to turn because you're
[6:14] surrounded right it may look like I'm
[6:17] surrounded praise God right but I'm
[6:19] surrounded by Christ amen amen
[6:21] hallelujah
[6:22] so he's got one choice really the real
[6:25] believer only has one choice Run To God
[6:27] In Prayer right
[6:29] right Hallelujah that's what we've got
[6:30] to do I wanna I wanna now move to the
[6:33] New Testament and I'm going to end up
[6:34] closing with Jehoshaphat of course at
[6:36] the end
[6:37] I want to show how Saint Paul also
[6:40] fought multiple enemies
[6:44] okay this is because I just listened to
[6:46] the sermon present stage of my Ministry
[6:48] September 8 1962. if you want to know
[6:50] the day it was a powerful sermon I was
[6:52] really enjoying listening to that one
[6:54] I love hearing Brother Band talk about
[6:56] just his trials and the things he goes
[6:58] through
[6:59] and yet he still preaches the word of
[7:01] God all the rejection he faced but he
[7:03] still stayed true to God's word amen
[7:05] amen
[7:10] multiple fronts
[7:12] he had one group uh from Asia the Bible
[7:16] said all in Asia he said have rejected
[7:18] me
[7:20] so in almost an entire continent now
[7:22] I believe he was just being uh hyperbole
[7:24] there I'm sure there was a one or two
[7:26] Believers in Asia right he's probably
[7:28] using hyperbole I feel like everybody's
[7:30] rejecting me in Asia
[7:33] so he had a group that they just want
[7:35] nothing to do with him and no doubt you
[7:38] think they were talking good about Paul
[7:39] I think they're talking bad about Paul
[7:42] when was the last time somebody rejected
[7:43] you and would even text you back
[7:45] wouldn't even call you back
[7:47] all right that happened last year
[7:48] somebody in the message that I witnessed
[7:51] a message to I'm not gonna call names
[7:52] but you could probably figure it out I
[7:54] witness to message you I said you're
[7:55] wrong and he won't text me back anymore
[7:57] I said I kept texting won't text me back
[8:00] I said you're off the word of God and
[8:02] he's saying we're off the word of God
[8:03] well just battles we got to face on
[8:05] multiple fronts praise God
[8:07] we got to do that
[8:09] another uh battle he he fighted was the
[8:13] prosperity preachers in the message
[8:17] Paul said don't go to those preachers
[8:19] who suppose that gain is godliness
[8:23] that's a group he was fighting
[8:26] and no doubt they looked down on Paul
[8:28] because Paul only had one coat
[8:30] or sisters he only had one dress
[8:34] or one winter jacket we'd say
[8:36] maybe maybe you only had one pair of
[8:38] shoes look at our shoes down here
[8:41] he wasn't a rich creature the gospel
[8:44] didn't make him popular
[8:46] right now I can say Amen to that praise
[8:47] God not every preacher can say that in
[8:49] the message I can say Amen to that
[8:51] gospel has not made me popular
[8:54] now I understand there's big churches
[8:56] that are faithful and little churches so
[8:57] I'm not saying all big churches are
[8:58] wrong they can be right
[9:01] but in the life of Jesus and the life of
[9:03] Paul the brother random their filings
[9:06] got smaller as they grew in the word of
[9:08] God now Jesus of course grew the Bible
[9:10] said he grew in favor and knowledge as
[9:11] well the Bible said that
[9:15] and so he's fighting a battle there so
[9:17] he's rejected by Asia the prosperity
[9:20] message group
[9:21] saying well if you're not gaining you're
[9:23] not godly and I just heard brother Adam
[9:25] said Brother Robinson in 1962 he said
[9:27] you know the preachers out in California
[9:28] say if you don't have two Cadillacs
[9:30] you're not spiritual
[9:32] even in brother Adams day they were
[9:33] saying you've got to speak Cadillacs
[9:35] into existence
[9:37] how about we speak against the
[9:39] Temptation for a Cadillac right so in
[9:42] other words Satan get behind me I don't
[9:44] need your Cadillac
[9:45] I just need a car that runs now they
[9:48] brought an excessive God gives you
[9:49] Cadillac praise God right but you know
[9:51] you didn't speak them
[9:54] just speak for something just speak for
[9:56] what God promises it is where praise God
[9:59] amen praise God but that was already uh
[10:03] it was already a popular thing in
[10:04] brother random's day
[10:07] and then Paul said in the Corinthian
[10:09] Church some thought uh they wish they
[10:12] could have been baptized in Paul's name
[10:14] remember that Paul said I'm glad I
[10:16] baptized none of you because you would
[10:17] have said I baptized in my name so then
[10:20] we had Prophet worshipers as well
[10:22] there's another battle you got to face
[10:24] Prophet worshipers sound familiar right
[10:27] I'm gonna get this out of that a little
[10:28] bit by God's grace
[10:30] because I just want to show that these
[10:32] some of these battles I mean we're still
[10:33] about these same devils
[10:35] Prosperity message preach
[10:37] preachers that worship the prophet
[10:39] because Spirits never die thank God the
[10:41] holy spirit's Eternal praise God
[10:43] amen
[10:47] and then he's fighting on this front
[10:49] where people just forsake Him like
[10:52] demons
[10:54] Demas was with Paul for men numerous
[10:57] trips with him for a while but then
[10:59] Demas for succumb Paul said because he
[11:01] loved this present World more than Paul
[11:04] now what do we got we got message
[11:05] members like that they say they say they
[11:08] still love us but because they love the
[11:10] world they stopped coming to church
[11:13] right they don't have time for church
[11:15] anymore because they love this world so
[11:17] much so worldliness gets them
[11:19] right she got the prosperity
[11:22] the the prophet worshipers
[11:25] you got these guys
[11:27] you know they you got them on every side
[11:29] they just stopped coming they still say
[11:31] they're your brother but they love the
[11:32] world more than they love the message
[11:36] I want to read this quote from president
[11:37] Sage of my Ministry brother random said
[11:40] Paul with one quote one quote rather
[11:42] coat not one quote one quote
[11:45] he tells Timothy bring it to him because
[11:47] it's getting cold up there a man that
[11:49] had a Ministry that preached to tens of
[11:51] thousands that Paul did and in Ministry
[11:53] that could do all kinds of Miracles and
[11:55] seeing Jesus in a pillar of fire think
[11:57] of that
[11:58] Jesus commissioned him and yet owned one
[12:00] coat
[12:01] amen
[12:04] demon said or fell like that he'd turn
[12:06] away from him
[12:10] even if you see Jesus even if you have
[12:11] great testimonies that doesn't ensure
[12:13] you're going to have a lot of money
[12:16] because Paul knew Jesus in this in this
[12:18] sermon brother Ryan said Paul knew Jesus
[12:20] better than Matthew Mark Luke and he
[12:24] didn't say John he said Matthew Mark and
[12:25] Luke
[12:26] and he said what do you mean he says
[12:28] they got to walk with him right he said
[12:31] but Paul saw him afterwards and got a
[12:34] commission to write the Bible praise God
[12:37] yeah brother said Paul knew him better
[12:39] than the men that actually walked with
[12:41] him
[12:42] Hallelujah
[12:45] how's that working out for you Paul
[12:46] working out getting real wealthy getting
[12:48] real popular
[12:49] actually not
[12:51] so church I can't if I believe God's
[12:53] giving me more Revelation I can't expect
[12:55] to be more popular
[12:58] right
[13:00] we can't expect that because in the
[13:02] Bible looks like the more Revelation you
[13:03] get the more hated you are
[13:06] I can say Amen to that
[13:08] Hallelujah
[13:13] now Paul was up here preaching in troas
[13:15] we find out that a man was up there a
[13:17] coppersmith and he was a rascal and he
[13:20] hated Christianity and he'd done
[13:21] everything to Paul that he could do to
[13:23] him in the book of Acts and throw it had
[13:25] him thrown in jail and Paul even warns
[13:27] Timothy in the same thing watch that guy
[13:29] remember that in the scripture
[13:31] and here's Demas oh God let the people
[13:33] here here's the demon standing by a man
[13:35] that struck a man blind for disputing
[13:38] with him now you Church of Christ
[13:40] preachers put your coats on now he said
[13:42] I had one tell me one time smite me
[13:44] blind smite me blind you got the Holy
[13:46] Ghost brother random Smiley this might
[13:48] be blind and mother said how can I
[13:49] you're already blind
[13:51] right spiritually yeah think about that
[13:54] asking somebody to Smite you blind what
[13:56] kind of spirit would that be that's a
[13:58] devil challenging the real man of God
[14:06] now brother Adam says this now to show
[14:08] you the side that that Demas was on he
[14:10] remember battling on numerous fronts why
[14:13] didn't Paul Smite the coppersmith blind
[14:17] you know why Roman tells later because
[14:18] it wasn't God's will yeah
[14:21] you could only do what God's called you
[14:22] to do
[14:24] you can only do what the anointing that
[14:26] you have allows you to do and the church
[14:28] said
[14:29] church God when God wants you to do
[14:31] something he's going to send the
[14:33] anointing for you to do it and I believe
[14:35] like David if you missed the first time
[14:37] you get it right the second time he'll
[14:38] send it again praise God amen amen
[14:40] hallelujah that's what I believe with
[14:42] bring in the ark I believe God's a god
[14:44] of Second Chances
[14:47] he said that's the same kind of spirit
[14:49] that's on people that he said the same
[14:51] thing was on Demas a man that could
[14:52] Smite a man blind for disputing with him
[14:54] and then turn on a I'm sorry copper
[14:57] Smith spoil his ministry in the city no
[14:59] doubt demon said oh Paul's washed up he
[15:02] lost all of his gifts he lost his gift
[15:04] of smiting blind
[15:06] that's an interesting view that brother
[15:07] Adam gives because there was something
[15:09] that happened in Paul's Ministry that
[15:10] Paul that demon said I'm going to leave
[15:12] him
[15:14] the world looks more more uh appealing
[15:17] to me than Paul's Ministry
[15:19] because he stopped doing the Miracles
[15:21] now stopped
[15:23] right I'm sure he still had Miracles
[15:25] yeah
[15:26] right
[15:27] man said don't you see how that Spirit
[15:29] still lives today
[15:31] you're all washed up brother and brother
[15:33] is talking about himself preachers were
[15:36] telling brother Branham you're washed up
[15:39] because you don't have the big meetings
[15:40] like you did but that was so carnal it's
[15:43] not the size of your meetings it's the
[15:45] amount of truth that you have praise God
[15:48] because the Holy Ghost doesn't lead you
[15:49] into less truth it leads you into more
[15:51] truth praise God
[15:54] he said oh it just goes over the
[15:56] people's heads they just don't get it
[15:58] that's all there is to it they can't see
[15:59] it they don't understand
[16:02] so worldly message Believers think the
[16:05] size of the crowd is the most important
[16:07] thing
[16:08] yeah or the the money in the ministry is
[16:11] the most important thing don't get me
[16:12] wrong I wish we could build churches I
[16:14] mean some of these message churches have
[16:15] built hundreds of churches that's
[16:16] fantastic but the main thing is what do
[16:19] they do in that church now that they got
[16:20] it
[16:22] are they preaching the truth let's hope
[16:24] so or are some of those preachers trying
[16:26] to get rich off the money that they're
[16:27] given to them yeah yeah right in the
[16:29] other countries that's happened too
[16:32] now Demas
[16:35] he didn't Smite that man blind because
[16:39] he uh because he didn't want to didn't
[16:42] Jesus say I do nothing to the father
[16:44] shows me first
[16:48] and program said even when his own
[16:50] mother my own mother was died she would
[16:52] say Bill What's My outcome brother man
[16:54] said I couldn't say nothing until God
[16:56] said so first
[16:58] and that's just what happened
[16:59] man can't man is a failure to begin with
[17:03] he's only an Asian to which God works
[17:05] through and God works his own will but
[17:07] you see these now listen he says these
[17:09] super duper people that's always having
[17:11] this and that and the other you better
[17:13] stay away from it
[17:15] so brother Adam says any preacher who
[17:18] says I got every answer I've got a thus
[17:19] days Lord for everybody I got all the
[17:21] anointing to all these things but
[17:22] remember you better stay away from that
[17:24] because that doesn't match Paul's
[17:26] Ministry
[17:27] it doesn't match brother Adams Ministry
[17:30] now if somebody if a preacher has a gift
[17:33] and it's genuine gifts and God is giving
[17:35] them a season of lots of Miracles yes
[17:37] let's support that let's let's say Amen
[17:39] to that amen but brother is making the
[17:42] point every man of God doesn't have
[17:44] every answer and every miracle for every
[17:47] distressful situation
[17:49] like brother said I gotta sweat it out
[17:51] just like you've got to sweat it out
[17:54] Hallelujah
[17:57] Jesus himself didn't do that he said
[17:59] Jesus said I only work as the father
[18:01] Works he shows me what to do and then I
[18:03] go do it I can't do anything otherwise
[18:06] than that that's in the Book of John
[18:07] chapter 5 and John chapter 10. Jesus of
[18:10] course says the father is greater than I
[18:12] love this little me my God uh there's
[18:14] these trinitarians run into Jesus and
[18:16] they're saying Jesus uh you're equal to
[18:19] the father
[18:20] you're you're the second person the
[18:21] Trinity and Jesus says the father is
[18:23] greater than that how can I be co-equal
[18:24] with the father
[18:26] that's a good meme I like I like to
[18:28] share that with some trinitarians
[18:31] hallelujah it's because Jesus's body was
[18:34] not God it was a human body praise God
[18:38] Jesus body could die it could be tempted
[18:41] but God could never die and God can
[18:43] never be tempted praise God but the
[18:46] spirit that was in Jesus that was God
[18:48] hallelujah
[18:49] but that makes it sound like there's
[18:50] almost like two there's like a dual
[18:53] person brother random says but there's
[18:56] only one person right
[18:58] and George remember I I heard a preacher
[19:00] say this and I agree with it because I
[19:01] was just studying on it Jesus never said
[19:03] all power is given to me until after the
[19:07] resurrection
[19:08] did you notice that during his life he
[19:10] always had no it was Earthly life before
[19:12] he died you always had to wait on the
[19:13] father wait on the father he never said
[19:15] I have all power until after he was
[19:17] raised from the dead
[19:19] now why could he say it then because
[19:21] then he has a glorified body
[19:24] he has a perfect body right yeah it's
[19:28] never it's never going to go through
[19:29] Temptation it's never going to have to
[19:31] sweat it out and pray it out in the
[19:33] Garden of Gethsemane he's now perfected
[19:35] praise God and then he says in Matthew
[19:37] 28 9 28 19-20 all power is given to me
[19:40] in heaven and earth praise God Amen
[19:43] Hallelujah now he's got full power full
[19:46] Authority let me drop a little deeper
[19:49] Revelation on you here now
[19:50] Solomon said he said even the heaven of
[19:53] Heavens cannot contain you God
[19:59] Simon said how much less could this
[20:02] Temple that I built contain your spirit
[20:04] when the heaven of Heavens can't contain
[20:07] you
[20:08] so the point I'm trying to make is that
[20:10] all of God's spirit could not have
[20:12] dwelled in Jesus body
[20:15] but what does that mean the fullness of
[20:17] the godhead body that means God's full
[20:19] power and full authorities in that body
[20:22] because God's spirit cannot be contained
[20:25] in one body it's greater than the
[20:27] heavens of Heaven amen
[20:30] amen hallelujah that's a deeper thought
[20:31] there
[20:33] Hallelujah
[20:35] it's God's full power full Authority in
[20:38] the body of Jesus Christ and yes I agree
[20:40] with every scripture the fullness of the
[20:41] godhead bodily yes
[20:43] hallelujah amen full power full
[20:46] Authority but if if a temple can't
[20:49] contain God's spirit how much less a
[20:51] body of one person
[20:53] okay that's a little deeper thought
[20:54] there Hallelujah hope that doesn't choke
[20:57] anybody
[20:58] if so get some water that'll help help
[21:00] your choking there by God's grace then
[21:02] we can preach on that uh on Solomon's
[21:04] thought there
[21:09] and he said here Demas
[21:11] saw Paul a man that had a Ministry like
[21:13] that and yet was so poor he only owned
[21:15] one coat and wanted Timothy to bring it
[21:17] to him one coat but Paul set the example
[21:20] like Christ was he had one quote one
[21:22] quote keep saying quote then why does
[21:24] riches and lots of money and things mean
[21:26] so much to people today
[21:29] notice now and he had power till
[21:31] anything that was contrary to what he
[21:33] preached he turned around and said
[21:35] you'll be blind for a season and the man
[21:36] was blood
[21:37] and here the coppersmith done 10 times
[21:40] to him what that other man done he yet
[21:43] he got away with it Demas must have
[21:45] thought well see the other fellows
[21:46] washed up now he's lost his ministry no
[21:49] he hadn't lost his ministry not at all
[21:51] God don't do things like that God's not
[21:54] an Indian giver yeah notice now now that
[21:56] might not be politically correct anymore
[21:57] any Giver but God's not one that gives a
[22:01] gift and takes it away
[22:04] he said Paul was something on the order
[22:06] like Elijah Elijah the prophet went to
[22:09] the mountain by the commission of God
[22:11] called for fire to fall out of heaven
[22:13] and it fell he called for water came and
[22:16] then he commanded by the message of God
[22:17] and killed 400 priests chopped their
[22:20] heads off let them roll he said then run
[22:23] it then he run at the threat of a woman
[22:25] one little hypocrite hypocrite woman she
[22:28] was an Infidel Jezebel that one little
[22:30] woman which was keynote to every bit of
[22:32] it she's the one that caused it looked
[22:35] like he'd have got her first but God has
[22:38] his way of doing these things and his
[22:40] servants can only work according if he
[22:42] works according to the will of God
[22:45] okay so how come Elijah got scared
[22:49] at the threat of one woman because God
[22:51] hadn't called him to to do the judgment
[22:53] on Jezebel right
[22:55] how could Paul not Smite the copper
[22:58] Smith blind because God hadn't called
[23:00] him to do that
[23:02] but see that will choke some people
[23:05] all right do you remember when brother
[23:06] Adam said this and Look Away to Jesus he
[23:08] said watch my Ministry now it's not
[23:09] going up he said it's going to come down
[23:12] he said because prophecy has to catch up
[23:15] with my Ministry
[23:17] remember he said that liquidity Jesus
[23:18] December 29 1963 I always remember that
[23:20] because it's such a powerful message
[23:22] that's the one that has the five third
[23:24] pole speakings of brother Branham in it
[23:27] brother man's wife uh the storm
[23:30] the snowstorm he spoke to uh Sunny shim
[23:33] and there's two more I always forget
[23:36] he said not going up not getting greater
[23:39] but he said lesser
[23:41] brother random knew his ministry was not
[23:43] going to go greater it was going to
[23:44] become more humble why because God does
[23:47] that to his servants praise God
[23:50] I don't want your faith to go down I
[23:52] want your faith to be right where God
[23:54] wants your faith to be right amen but
[23:57] I'm bringing this out for a purpose so
[23:58] you can see how every preacher battles
[24:01] on different fronts yeah
[24:04] yeah Hallelujah
[24:06] he said don't you see friends you've got
[24:08] to move according to God's way of moving
[24:10] how many times have I set and set and
[24:13] counseled Brethren and how I would like
[24:15] to walk over and shake their hand say
[24:16] brother it doesn't make any difference
[24:18] let's just be Brethren along how can I
[24:20] do that and keep my commission with
[24:21] preach the word I don't want to do that
[24:23] so brother says I like to be brother
[24:25] with them but I've got to stick with the
[24:27] word of God
[24:29] now for him it's probably you know no
[24:31] women preachers serpent seed Lord Jesus
[24:33] Christ baptism God's one person that
[24:35] separates Fellowship right right some of
[24:38] those major topics
[24:41] well Ram said I've sort amongst
[24:43] amongst brother random my aunts over
[24:46] I know you're proud sent from God go
[24:48] over and restore her sight
[24:50] wish I could I'd do it
[24:53] I can't do it tell he tells me to do it
[24:55] see no one could do it Elijah couldn't
[24:57] do it no one else could do it
[25:00] amen amen
[25:02] so what do we have to do we have to wait
[25:04] on God
[25:05] now I've also read some testimonies from
[25:07] Brother matters Ministry brother random
[25:09] gave one of these young men a belt
[25:11] buckle
[25:12] and he said keep that it's going to come
[25:14] in handy one day so he one time he was
[25:16] uh he was diagnosed with cancer he put
[25:19] the belt buckle on and his cancer was
[25:21] instantly healed
[25:24] right what is that just like a prayer
[25:26] cloth
[25:27] and then he said he put it on a woman
[25:29] family member now imagine a woman
[25:30] wearing a belt going down
[25:32] and she had cancer she was healed as
[25:34] well
[25:36] but how come you know he doesn't get
[25:38] these other ants how come he can't go to
[25:40] this preacher and uh
[25:43] restore the blind sight because it
[25:45] wasn't God's will right
[25:47] Hallelujah
[25:49] so can we see the importance of knowing
[25:50] God's will church that's what I ended
[25:52] last Wednesday night remember the Divine
[25:53] Healing brother man brought it down to
[25:55] the great Revelation find God's will
[25:57] first
[25:58] yes you can speak as much be as positive
[26:00] as you can speak speak but you got to
[26:03] find God's will first
[26:07] doesn't matter how much oil you pour on
[26:08] yourself but man I said doesn't matter
[26:10] how many preachers pray for you you got
[26:12] to find God's will first praise God he
[26:14] said that he said that's good though if
[26:16] a preacher Brian or me or cam or brother
[26:18] Brooks or anybody brother Simon if a
[26:20] preacher prays for her he says that's
[26:21] good that'll encourage you praise God
[26:23] lives but he said find the will of God
[26:26] first now what I find is that sometimes
[26:28] we don't even find the will of God and
[26:29] God still answers our request like with
[26:32] Austin's migraine I didn't pray first
[26:34] well let's have word let's see if it's
[26:35] God's will we just prayed
[26:37] yeah right
[26:39] so there's times like that too
[26:41] so we have to say Lord if it's been a
[26:43] while since you haven't answered this
[26:45] prayer now let me seek your will right
[26:47] because after a while we don't know if
[26:49] God if it's God's will or not to do it
[26:51] if if he hasn't showed it to us and
[26:54] church this is what I'm talking about
[26:55] this is spiritual algebra when you have
[26:58] questions in your life that it doesn't
[26:59] actually say in the Bible
[27:02] this is when maturity has to take over
[27:04] and you got to find God's will for your
[27:06] life
[27:08] and then like like brothers I read that
[27:10] quote a few weeks ago no matter what God
[27:12] says yes or no you still love him amen
[27:14] why because he died for your sins
[27:17] amen hallelujah
[27:18] he sends the Holy Ghost on you and you
[27:20] scream and shout and rejoice and clap
[27:22] and dance all over the place Hallelujah
[27:25] speak in tongues whatever you might do
[27:27] prophesy dream dreams whatever you might
[27:30] do God has been so good to us praise God
[27:33] amen and we love the father so much that
[27:35] no matter what he says we'll trust him
[27:42] so see brother Brandon fought it on all
[27:44] the sides you've got the prosperity the
[27:46] people that left him
[27:48] right preacher saying come over do a
[27:51] miracle give give sight to my my blind
[27:53] aunt I have a I have a child uh in my
[27:56] class who's blind in one eye I have a
[27:59] child who's deaf in one ear I need to
[28:01] start praying for them
[28:02] now wouldn't that be powerful God did
[28:04] something just in the school day or
[28:06] something though on the weekend or
[28:07] whatever
[28:08] as soon as I heard that I'm like oh I
[28:10] believe
[28:11] I know he's able but I gotta find God's
[28:14] will right right
[28:15] I don't remember this a few years ago
[28:17] brother Kevin we were at the other place
[28:18] are they kidding brought up his uh was
[28:21] it granddaughter
[28:24] and she had eye trouble and I prayed for
[28:26] her
[28:27] and I said
[28:28] I don't know what you're trouble I think
[28:30] it was hearing trouble
[28:31] I don't know it's either I trouble your
[28:32] trouble we prayed for it right in the
[28:34] service I asked her is it insulin better
[28:35] it wasn't but brother Kevin said uh I
[28:37] think a year later it started healing
[28:40] and I never got the full details but I
[28:43] was the under the anointing in that
[28:45] service I was praying for it I was
[28:46] expecting her to say okay now can you
[28:48] hear better like I was expecting it
[28:49] right there but it didn't come right
[28:51] there I had to wait a little while by
[28:53] God's grace yeah
[28:54] right
[28:55] but sometimes our faith is so strong now
[28:58] me I'm not I was a little discouraged
[29:00] you know because it didn't happen
[29:01] instantly because I listened to brother
[29:02] Graham and it happens just instantly in
[29:04] his testimonies right right
[29:05] but there's testimonies where it doesn't
[29:07] happen instantly
[29:09] and you got to have patience
[29:11] how many want to possess your soul and
[29:13] patience tonight
[29:14] yeah we don't want to get impatient with
[29:16] God we don't want to get Hasty with God
[29:18] we don't want to get upset with God we
[29:20] want to have patience with God Amen
[29:24] now we fight the same battles
[29:27] and we fight other battles on both sides
[29:32] now I put out the video today I don't
[29:34] know if you saw on six dust save the
[29:35] Lords but we're fighting one battle
[29:37] where the people say brother man wasn't
[29:39] a prophet I just want to remind us he
[29:41] was a prophet hallelujah amen
[29:45] now there's many many thus say the Lords
[29:48] that have come to pass but these are the
[29:50] only ones I can verify with before and
[29:52] after so if you know of some other ones
[29:55] let me know
[29:56] first in 1958 brother random told
[29:58] Marilyn Hickey she's a short-haired
[30:00] red-headed woman preacher but she was in
[30:03] Brothers prayer line and brother random
[30:05] said thus saith the Lord you're going to
[30:07] have a baby if you believe go receive it
[30:09] well she didn't get it till 10 years
[30:11] later
[30:12] but thus saith the Lord came to pass
[30:15] and she talks about it they made a
[30:16] little video about her testimony brother
[30:18] Brown said I see a light between us and
[30:20] so they made like a Hollywood video of
[30:21] the light coming out of I think it was
[30:23] coming behind brother Brandon or even
[30:24] been on this side the light came and the
[30:27] sister and Marilyn saw that light come
[30:29] out
[30:30] and ten years later she got the baby ten
[30:33] years it is no joke to wait
[30:35] that's no joke
[30:37] that takes real maturity
[30:39] how many times do you think she
[30:41] questioned was was the man of God right
[30:42] or not was the man of God right am I a
[30:44] Believer or not the whole time she was a
[30:46] believer
[30:48] so what am I encouraging you be a
[30:50] believer praise God you're a Believer
[30:52] Hallelujah
[30:54] that was thus saith the Lord and
[30:57] second 1961 Birmingham said there will
[30:59] be no greater gift to the Gentiles than
[31:02] his gift
[31:03] and that's been 61 years I'm sorry
[31:07] that's been uh
[31:09] I can't remember the number of years
[31:11] sorry I had on the video I forgot it
[31:13] anyways it's been many years
[31:16] and no gift has even gotten close to
[31:18] brother Ram's gift
[31:20] nobody can stand there and tell them all
[31:22] the secrets and thoughts and do it seven
[31:24] or eight times in a row who can do that
[31:25] nobody can do that
[31:28] third brother said women will continue
[31:30] to strip themselves thus saith the Lord
[31:32] he said that in 1962 now sisters aren't
[31:34] you glad you keep your clothes on
[31:37] aren't you glad you're not a striptease
[31:40] to men but I said sending them to hell
[31:43] because of their lust and their
[31:44] immoralities their adulteries and
[31:46] fornications their whore-mongeries
[31:47] aren't you glad you live a holy life
[31:50] like I read that quote my man said you
[31:52] got something those women will never
[31:53] have the virtue of the Holy Spirit
[31:56] the character of the Holy Spirit
[32:00] fourth Abraham said thus saith the Lord
[32:02] I saw a vision of the United States
[32:03] Church dancing to rock and roll with bob
[32:05] hair and makeup on and that's exactly
[32:08] what we got
[32:09] thus saith the Lord
[32:12] 1965 for the man prophesied of Florence
[32:15] shakarian's death
[32:16] now she had stage four cancer and I
[32:19] showed on the video it's not hard I
[32:21] agree it's not hard to predict someone's
[32:23] going to die with stage four cancer but
[32:25] the reason why that was significant was
[32:26] because all of Flora shakarian's
[32:29] preacher friends were saying thus saith
[32:31] the Lord she's going to be healed
[32:33] so yeah false prophets let's say 20. 20
[32:36] false prophets versus brother random who
[32:37] is right brother Brown was right
[32:40] so it took a stand it took some it took
[32:44] a vision
[32:45] for brother Ram to know sorry sister
[32:47] unless God sends some other Vision or
[32:49] sends healing like Hezekiah right set
[32:51] your house in order
[32:53] unless God sends that
[32:55] passed away in 1965.
[32:58] so there's five six brother Randolph
[33:00] said in anointed one's the end time no
[33:02] denomination will ever break up and come
[33:04] back to the word of God
[33:07] now somebody on YouTube asked me show me
[33:09] some proof show me the dates and show me
[33:11] the quotes I sent them the quotes and
[33:13] they said that's not very convincing
[33:15] and I said I feel sorry for you
[33:18] I said Mercy
[33:19] who do you know who's prophesied one
[33:22] thing with thus saith the Lord
[33:24] and it's coming to pass who do you know
[33:25] nobody
[33:27] Hallelujah and there are six but there's
[33:30] of course there's many more in that
[33:31] those are just the ones that I can
[33:32] confirm
[33:34] that I know I've heard those people or
[33:35] those people have their own testimony
[33:37] and I said if you know some more share
[33:39] them with me and I'll make a new video
[33:40] okay
[33:42] who do you know that's even done one let
[33:44] alone six thus saith the Lord's ever
[33:45] come to pass
[33:49] you know thus saith the Lord had to
[33:52] return because the pillar of fire
[33:53] returned
[33:55] amen hallelujah when do we hear start
[33:58] people start saying thus say the Lord
[33:59] when the pillar of fire came to Moses
[34:01] Hallelujah and then Joshua and then
[34:04] Samuel then David then Solomon breaks
[34:06] down let me get Jeremiah Ezekiel
[34:08] Hallelujah all these Isaiah all these
[34:10] Mighty Men of God why because the pillar
[34:12] of fire came back and that's what we got
[34:14] today the pillar of fires back and we
[34:16] have thus saith the Lord we have thus
[34:18] say the scriptures Hallelujah
[34:19] amen
[34:22] well Ram gave us eight
[34:24] thus say the I'm sorry 12 I'm sorry six
[34:26] thus say the Lords on the Mysteries
[34:28] brother Adam said trinitarian is of the
[34:30] devil thus saith the Lord he said yet
[34:32] they can still be saved because it's a
[34:34] mystery
[34:36] second Israel's blindness program gave
[34:38] us thus saith the Lord
[34:40] Israel's blood
[34:42] until after the Rapture and then God
[34:45] will open their eyes when a fountain is
[34:47] open in the House of David
[34:50] third the baptism Holy Ghost I'm giving
[34:52] you the saith the Lord on the baptism of
[34:55] the Holy Ghost it's a third work of
[34:57] Grace
[34:58] foreign
[35:00] on the seven Church ages amen hallelujah
[35:04] fifth program gave us thus Faith the
[35:06] Lord on the Roman Catholic Church he
[35:08] said she's the mother of harlots
[35:10] he said
[35:12] they're harlots and the Catholic
[35:14] and Protestant churches that's flat but
[35:16] that's thus saith the Lord Now isn't
[35:18] that hard to say
[35:19] to a Assembly of God person
[35:21] that's what I was Raising or how about a
[35:23] Christian Missionary Alliance person
[35:26] right isn't that hard to say but it's
[35:29] thus saith the Lord
[35:32] let me say that let me say a different
[35:33] way that's thus saith Jesus Christ
[35:36] can I say it differently so it kind of
[35:38] sounds different for a new testament
[35:39] person
[35:40] it's thus saith the Lord these churches
[35:42] are
[35:44] right the systems of them
[35:46] they make like brother amen was saying
[35:48] they make love with fantasy football
[35:50] leagues on Sunday
[35:52] they get drunk on Saturday night uh
[35:55] suppers in the basement
[35:57] that's making love to demonic spirits
[36:00] they love fantasy football and
[36:02] drunkenness or they love the Holy Ghost
[36:04] but we love the Holy Ghost amen that's
[36:07] what makes us the bride Hallelujah
[36:10] because we won't cheat on the G on the
[36:12] Lord Jesus Christ we'll be faithful to
[36:14] Christ Hallelujah we will be a chaste
[36:16] virgin to Christ how many will be the
[36:18] chase virgin praise God like to hear
[36:20] amens
[36:21] I know so this is a review but think
[36:23] about this this is the man we're
[36:25] standing with and yet this attack says
[36:27] we're all crazy
[36:29] they're crazy
[36:31] I say that with love because they might
[36:32] watch our video I'll say I said that
[36:34] with love go back and watch the video I
[36:37] love you but you're crazy
[36:39] you're crazy because you disbelieve
[36:40] God's word
[36:43] where does the bible say God's three
[36:45] persons it doesn't say that right
[36:47] right where's the Bible say a woman can
[36:49] cut her hair hey don't say that
[36:52] where's the Bible said the Roman
[36:54] Catholic Church is a good church the
[36:55] Bible don't say that
[36:57] but I can show you where it says she's
[36:59] the mother of harlots
[37:02] okay and six and finally brother Graham
[37:04] said he said the Antichrist come in
[37:08] he said the mystery of iniquity what a
[37:10] revelation it's absolutely thus saith
[37:12] the Lord so the revelation of the
[37:14] mystery of the iniquity the Antichrist
[37:16] we have thus saith the Lord on it
[37:20] Satan Works through deception right in
[37:23] other words he's in the churches it's
[37:25] Satan in many of these churches
[37:27] deceiving people making them think
[37:29] they're Christians when they're not
[37:32] so I just shared this church I just gave
[37:34] you four I'm sorry uh 12 thus saith the
[37:37] Lord's 12.
[37:39] you can't get that at any other church
[37:42] and the church said
[37:44] you can't get that in the Baptist Church
[37:46] you can't get at the Pentecostal church
[37:47] we got 12 don't save the Lords amen and
[37:50] in my book I got 30 of them
[37:53] 30.
[37:55] here's eight more doctrines with us
[37:57] saith the Lord the water baptism
[37:58] Brotherhood says that's thus saith the
[38:00] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ be back
[38:03] if you're baptized father suddenly goes
[38:04] go be baptized again in the name of
[38:06] Jesus Christ
[38:08] so it's 12 plus 8 20. I'm giving you 20
[38:10] here tonight
[38:12] 20 thus saith the Lords
[38:14] second program gave us marriage and
[38:16] divorce he says the mystery of marriage
[38:18] and divorce he said it's thus saith the
[38:21] Lord what is it the quickening power
[38:23] coming to the church
[38:25] see God gave us thus said the Lord and
[38:28] Saints a preacher a Baptist preacher
[38:30] walked up to me last night at school and
[38:32] said pastor Jesse I got to ask you a
[38:34] question he said I'm coming to you
[38:35] because I have confidence in you I won't
[38:37] go to many preachers he said a couple
[38:39] wants to marry their divorced and he's
[38:42] divorced and he wants to marry another
[38:43] woman and wants me to do it should I do
[38:45] it and I said absolutely not
[38:48] I said because there's not a verse in
[38:49] the Bible where a divorced person can
[38:51] remarry and he's like you're right Jesus
[38:54] said if that person remarries it'll make
[38:56] them an adulterer and the person they
[38:58] divorce and daughter I said that's
[38:59] exactly right
[39:00] I said but now I said this because of
[39:02] Billy Paul Billy Paul's divorce and
[39:04] remarried I said what they can do is
[39:06] they can go get married
[39:08] at the courthouse and come back in we
[39:10] can still minister them but they got to
[39:12] know they're still living in adultery
[39:17] Hallelujah that's what brother Rand did
[39:19] yeah Billy Paul I'm not going to marry a
[39:21] second time go get married in the
[39:23] courthouse and come back to church and
[39:25] you can still be my secretary
[39:27] but you said you're still you're still
[39:29] living in adultery
[39:31] right
[39:33] and so he said I think you're right he
[39:35] said he said that's what 90 of the 99 of
[39:38] the preachers have told me I said well
[39:39] you've got some pretty good preachers
[39:40] there I'm actually surprised it's 99 I
[39:43] thought 10 or something like that
[39:44] but we got nothing to the Lord
[39:50] brother random gave us interpretation of
[39:52] Daniel's revelation of the image with
[39:54] thus saith the Lord he said it's not
[39:56] Russia that will rule the church I'm
[39:58] sure sorry rule the world it's wrong
[40:00] thus say the Lord show me a scripture
[40:02] where communism or anything else will
[40:04] rule besides Rome
[40:07] brother have said women who purposely
[40:09] dress in sexy provocative clothes will
[40:12] answer for committing adultery because
[40:13] they cause men to lust after them he
[40:15] said you're a tool of the devil at the
[40:17] Judgment bar thus saith the Lord your
[40:19] answer for committing adultery and your
[40:21] soul will be gone you know better look
[40:24] these women know better they have all
[40:25] these TV shows now all these apps women
[40:28] can make money just by stripping their
[40:29] clothes on an app yeah
[40:31] I think it's called what only fans or
[40:33] something like that Austin and Benjamin
[40:34] were telling me about that
[40:35] like all these dating services you can
[40:37] get a prostitute in a matter of minutes
[40:41] and they know better they know what
[40:44] their brother said thus save the Lord
[40:47] you answer for Judgment at the day of
[40:49] judgment and you'll be lost if you don't
[40:51] repent of that now which preachers are
[40:53] preaching that
[40:54] just a few faithful churches thank God
[40:57] we got it amen that's what the Bible
[40:59] said the woman that lives in pleasure is
[41:01] dead while she lives yeah
[41:03] which preachers are preaching that
[41:06] Urbana said a woman who cuts her hair is
[41:08] spiritually dead she's not born again he
[41:10] said that's thus saith the Lord I don't
[41:12] care how much he speaks in tongues
[41:13] dances sings sings in the choir runs up
[41:16] and down the church has all kinds of
[41:18] AIDS Society she's dead that's the saith
[41:20] the Lord amen
[41:22] Hallelujah
[41:24] see because she's already Dishonored her
[41:26] husband
[41:27] what's the other word for that dishonor
[41:29] is a really awful word for it I use on
[41:31] my video
[41:32] it's a really awful word like this it's
[41:34] a disrespectful kind of word I have to
[41:37] look it up
[41:40] the fullness of Pentecost will come back
[41:42] to the bride that's
[41:45] after 26. I've stayed on that many times
[41:46] over the years brother said the Elijah
[41:48] Messenger to the Gentiles appeared in
[41:51] the United States in 1965. that's thus
[41:53] saith the Lord he said so it can't be
[41:55] Joseph
[41:56] Joseph didn't have a Ministry in 1965.
[41:59] okay right there I just gave you 20 the
[42:00] state the Lord whether the church has
[42:02] that
[42:03] right now you would think we'd be
[42:04] shouting uh from the top of our voice
[42:06] but you did when you first come in the
[42:08] message
[42:09] but this is review right
[42:12] we got thus saith Jesus Christ why
[42:16] because it lines up with his Bible
[42:18] praise God Amen
[42:22] amen so we're fighting a battle on that
[42:24] side right
[42:28] so there's so there's 30 in there 30
[42:30] thus say the Lords in that chapter
[42:33] now we're finding the other side this is
[42:35] the one I've been I preach on usually
[42:37] every service the voice of God or
[42:39] Brandon Tabernacle
[42:41] uh worshiping of brother Branham they
[42:43] mainly break at least eight scriptures I
[42:46] think
[42:47] they call us preachers to neglect their
[42:49] gifts
[42:50] they do not gather physically together
[42:54] they add to the Bible they take away
[42:56] from the Bible they worship Brothers
[42:58] they won't ask questions I'm sorry they
[43:00] won't answer questions
[43:02] and there's a couple I think there's two
[43:04] more I'm forgetting
[43:07] but let me read you this list
[43:09] here's 24 lies that are coming out and
[43:12] they're all related to breaking those
[43:13] scriptures and I've shared these with
[43:15] the leadership there
[43:17] the first lie every word on tape is thus
[43:19] say the Lord they say the tapes can
[43:21] never be wrong the tapes have no
[43:22] mistakes the tapes have every answer
[43:24] that's the first line
[43:26] the second line all the answers are on
[43:28] the tapes if you have a question that
[43:29] answers on the tapes
[43:32] um is Moses and Elijah the real Moses
[43:34] Elijah or not but man said I don't know
[43:36] well the answer is not on the tape
[43:39] these people are insane
[43:41] and I love them
[43:43] third they say we we must unquestion
[43:46] believe every word on the tape is thus
[43:48] saith the Lord even if brother man made
[43:49] a mistake that's a lie
[43:52] fourth they said every Church must catch
[43:55] the vision you've got to play the tapes
[43:58] and every church is a take church I'm
[44:00] sorry the program never said that
[44:02] and church remember all these things
[44:04] brother random never said right
[44:07] Hallelujah who's the crazy one praise
[44:10] God it's not me Hallelujah not you
[44:13] you're the ones that got some sense
[44:15] about you praise God Amen but where's
[44:17] the big crowds going to all the other
[44:19] things except the truth
[44:22] prosperity
[44:24] No Mess no mistakes in the message no
[44:26] depends like I told the brother it
[44:27] depends what you mean by the message
[44:29] if you mean the Bible revelations I'll
[44:31] go with you on that
[44:33] but they make it sound like it's a tapes
[44:35] right number five the tapes are the
[44:38] token they actually say that
[44:39] and if you're in a tape church that's
[44:41] the evidence you have a token
[44:43] that's the same as saying speaking in
[44:45] tongues is the evidence of the Holy
[44:46] Ghost same devil amen I'm gonna say Amen
[44:49] amen same devil number six they say take
[44:52] boys are the true five-fold ministry
[44:54] that's a lie from hell
[44:56] preachers preach the gospel Hallelujah
[44:58] I'm getting fired up now I better calm
[45:01] down they say tapes are number one in
[45:04] the fivefold ministry show me that in
[45:05] the Bible right
[45:09] they say tapes are the primary Ministry
[45:11] brother Rams Head tapes are secondary
[45:13] it's a literal quote
[45:16] why aren't they saying what the tapes
[45:18] say because they're insane
[45:20] we got to pray for them
[45:21] the seventh lie they say brother random
[45:23] was identical to Jesus and his spirit
[45:25] and soul that's total heresy
[45:29] Jesus never sinned in his mind brother
[45:31] I'm sinned every day in his mind
[45:33] brother Graham's Saul was dead in sin
[45:35] Jesus Soul was never in sin
[45:40] sin somehow I don't know how
[45:42] but their spirits and souls are not the
[45:44] same
[45:48] eighth line anyone who doesn't uh say
[45:51] brother random uh has a living Ministry
[45:53] today is Demas
[45:56] Saints brother Brown is dead all right
[45:58] right we appreciate him we'll honor him
[46:00] to the day we die or the day we're
[46:02] raptured or the day we see him in the
[46:04] Rapture amen hallelujah but the Bible
[46:07] never says a dead Pastor or dead bishop
[46:10] or dead Prophet rules the church
[46:12] the word of God they preach still rules
[46:15] the church praise God but there's a lot
[46:17] of those prophets not just one
[46:21] yeah these are the same people that say
[46:22] brother M is the greatest prophet of all
[46:23] time but they don't say except for Jesus
[46:25] now why don't they say except for Jesus
[46:27] because they don't honor Jesus
[46:29] they honor brother more than Jesus
[46:31] the ninth lie they say Jesus said all
[46:35] churches must be taped churches
[46:37] according to revelation 22 16. it's a
[46:39] lie
[46:40] the 10th lie they said brother random is
[46:43] the angel in Revelation who reveals
[46:44] everything to John that's impossible
[46:46] there's no pre-existence of Souls
[46:52] the eleventh line brother Branham is the
[46:54] absolute I'm sorry brother's tapes are
[46:56] the absolute brother man never said that
[46:57] he said the Bible is the absolute
[47:01] the 12th lie any
[47:04] where and
[47:09] because I can answer questions and the
[47:12] Holy Ghost guides us into all truth
[47:14] the 13th lives I think the worst
[47:17] their Pastor said with thus saith the
[47:19] Lord they're in the perfect will of God
[47:21] by playing tapes
[47:22] I said there's no way they're in the
[47:24] perfect will of God there's no way God
[47:26] said that I think he got he might have
[47:27] got his channels mixed up
[47:30] they might be in God's will but they're
[47:32] in God's permissive will because they're
[47:34] breaking the word of God
[47:36] impossible the 14th as they say brother
[47:39] Adam is the greatest prophet of all time
[47:42] Jesus is the greatest Prophet about that
[47:45] brother I might be the greatest New
[47:46] Testament that'll be up to God I've
[47:48] always thought Paul but we'll see
[47:50] I don't know it's up to God but you
[47:52] can't say it unless the Bible says it
[47:54] because you can't add one thing to the
[47:55] narrative you can't add one thing to
[47:57] this Bible praise God or take away
[47:59] the 15th lie they say a prophet cannot
[48:02] be judged and brother random said in
[48:04] numerous quotes I have on there he said
[48:06] Judge Me by if this prophecy comes to
[48:08] pass or not
[48:09] a prophet doesn't mind being judged a
[48:12] prophet has to be judged the how are we
[48:14] going to enormous the prophet unless he
[48:15] passes the test
[48:18] 16th line I got videos on all these
[48:22] it's brother Brandon is their Pastor
[48:24] brother Ram said I won't always be your
[48:26] pastor and I got the coach this week
[48:29] brother said I will he said I never made
[48:31] a successful Pastor or never would
[48:35] never would that means even now he
[48:37] couldn't be a successful pastor
[48:40] he said because I've got a rambling
[48:42] Spirit In other words God called me to
[48:43] be a prophet not a pastor
[48:47] Hallelujah
[48:50] the 17th lie
[48:52] they're not Gathering more as we see
[48:53] that day approaching
[48:55] the 18th line life only comes to the
[48:58] tapes brother Brown never said that
[49:00] brother said life comes through the word
[49:03] see they're making this tape player
[49:04] where's my phone oh my phone's right
[49:06] there they're making that phone like
[49:08] they're
[49:09] phone equal to God somehow because
[49:11] they've got the message on there that's
[49:13] what I asked him I said does my phone
[49:16] have the token because the message is on
[49:18] my phone yeah does my phone have the
[49:20] Holy Ghost
[49:21] of course not
[49:24] the 19th lie
[49:26] God's program is to play tapes that
[49:28] deletes four folds of the fivefold
[49:30] ministry actually deletes all five
[49:32] because dead profits are not here right
[49:35] the 20th live we are we they say we are
[49:38] now in the wedding ceremony Brothers of
[49:40] the wedding ceremony is the meeting in
[49:41] the air right
[49:42] the 21st line the take when we listen to
[49:45] tapes it's like God speaking lip to ear
[49:48] like God spoke to Moses
[49:50] face to face
[49:51] I said show me one quote on that and
[49:54] there's not one quote in fact remember I
[49:56] said God never spoke to anybody else
[49:57] like that other than Moses and Jesus
[50:00] amen so who's saying what the tape is
[50:02] saying we're saying what the tape is
[50:04] saying
[50:05] think about this church think about it
[50:06] this this these lies gather millions
[50:09] they get millions of times
[50:11] last time they were set they had over
[50:13] 110 million dollars
[50:15] lies bringing money lies could make you
[50:19] popular lives make you famous
[50:21] I'd rather tell the truth and be
[50:23] rejected
[50:25] because I could stand before God and say
[50:27] I told the truth
[50:29] I said what the Bible said Hallelujah
[50:35] you all looking at me like brother Jesse
[50:36] yeah you just gotta overcome this
[50:39] I am
[50:41] the 20-second LIE they said they hear
[50:43] from God just like Abraham heard from
[50:45] Melchizedek
[50:47] that's a lie
[50:49] God was in a physical body when he when
[50:52] he was in Melchizedek
[50:54] God's not in the physical body in all
[50:55] their homes when they stream around the
[50:57] world that's what that's what they say
[51:01] they said just push play and Obey is the
[51:03] perfect will of God and they said God
[51:05] will still be pressing play brother
[51:06] Ram's tapes in heaven
[51:08] that's a lie now God's going to play all
[51:11] of our lives back
[51:12] but God's not going to say
[51:14] this way I'm not going to talk I'm going
[51:15] to press play and we're just gonna
[51:16] listen to brother Brandon in heaven
[51:17] that's what they say
[51:19] that's what they teach that's what they
[51:21] sing about that
[51:23] and this is the battles we're fighting
[51:26] see that's why I had to do this series I
[51:28] see all these 24 lives in church
[51:30] honestly every week I can go to their
[51:31] website they put a new blog post I can
[51:33] find more lies every single week if I
[51:34] wanted to
[51:36] but I just thought well I'll do 24.
[51:38] something good about 24 I guess 24 hours
[51:40] right something holy about that
[51:43] and the last lie put brother Brandon
[51:45] back in the Pulpit when did Brother Bear
[51:46] never say when I'm dead put me back in
[51:48] the Pulpit right
[51:49] and the Very quote the very sermon
[51:51] they're talking about brother Adam
[51:52] quickly taught at Perry Green's church
[51:55] and said I don't want to take the
[51:56] pastor's time
[51:58] and they use those quotes to say put
[52:00] brother Brandon back in the Pulpit he
[52:02] said purposely I don't want to take up
[52:04] the pastor of time in other words
[52:05] brother random respected the fivefold
[52:07] ministry and so do we praise God
[52:10] by the way I'm never a served Authority
[52:12] and so I'm greater than anybody remember
[52:14] you've heard it said he said I'm just at
[52:16] one Pebble on the beach now we know he
[52:19] he said he was a small pebble but we
[52:21] know he's a greater bigger Pebble
[52:22] because he's a prophet messenger
[52:25] all right now that's done with that okay
[52:27] so everybody can take a deep breath now
[52:29] bro Jessie's got his thoughts out all
[52:33] right
[52:34] so the I mean we're fighting battles on
[52:37] all fronts
[52:40] now thank God some of these don't affect
[52:42] us right thank God the tape movement
[52:43] doesn't affect us
[52:45] but churches have it remember I told you
[52:47] that Pastor from Florida member church
[52:49] this is back in 2016. evil spirits would
[52:52] battle him for like two weeks in a row
[52:53] in his in his house
[52:55] and he cried out to God and two people
[52:57] told him there was witches in your
[52:59] church and there there was the same
[53:01] people that were saying press play and
[53:03] stop preaching but once he preached it
[53:05] they left the church and everything was
[53:06] fine
[53:08] because Rebellion is the spirit of
[53:10] witchcraft
[53:12] Hallelujah
[53:16] so we're fighting battles on these
[53:18] fronts too and that's why I gotta stand
[53:19] where I stand
[53:22] but see how can I how could I not stand
[53:24] where I stand
[53:26] who wants me to make a compromise and
[53:29] say well you're the greatest children of

[57:16] everything done that's important I've
[57:18] never seen that fail
[57:20] it's like today I prayed I got up at 4
[57:22] 50. I prayed read my Bible studied a
[57:24] little bit

[57:56] now
[58:00] now you know the prayer he's calling on
[58:02] God and he quotes Solomon's promise but
[58:04] out of verse 14 then upon jehaziel the
[58:06] son of Zechariah the son of benoniah the
[58:09] son of Gio and the son of mathaniah
[58:12] Alibi of the sons of ASAP came and the
[58:14] spirit of the Lord
[58:16] I'm sorry can the spirit Lord in the
[58:17] midst of the congregation don't you like
[58:19] that praise God
[58:20] I like that when we feel God's presence
[58:23] in other words we are done thinking
[58:25] about who's looking at me right what did
[58:28] I wear what did she wear what did he
[58:30] wear we're done thinking about that
[58:32] we're done thinking about what's going
[58:33] on up there because we sense God is here
[58:35] hallelujah
[58:37] different Hallelujah when the spirit
[58:39] drops down and we forget about
[58:41] everything else
[58:43] even if just for a few moments don't you
[58:45] loving the spirit of God comes
[58:47] we can forget about our trials how tired
[58:49] we are or how distracted we are or all
[58:51] the struggles and all all the battles of
[58:53] tomorrow we can forget about that
[58:55] because God is here
[58:58] Hallelujah
[59:01] and then he prophesies
[59:03] verse 15 he said hearken ye all Judah
[59:06] and you haven't sub Jerusalem and now
[59:07] King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord
[59:09] unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by
[59:12] reason this Grace multitude for the
