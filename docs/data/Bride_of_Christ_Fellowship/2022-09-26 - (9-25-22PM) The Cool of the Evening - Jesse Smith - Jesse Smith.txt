for the service in Jesus Christ said amen God bless you as you being seated praise God not sure how long this will be this might not be a long sermon we'll kind of see how it goes I just want to take a little thought here for communion tonight the grace of God are we thankful for this morning's word that we heard praise God I was amen and I were talking about the blood and it's just so refreshing praise God I need that the enemy will come in and Whisper and he'll you know and I'll sin I'll make a mistake I'll feel awful then the word of God says if I confess my sins I am back in the light as he is in the light praise God and I can have Fellowship again so that's kind of what this message is about here tonight just a simple thought so I set a timer for half an hour we'll see struggle at least half an hour we'll see how it goes here you know just a few scriptures and there were you know mainly some quotes I was listening to brother Brandon yesterday and just had mainly some quotes I want to read I think there'll be just encouragement to you uh just to kind of how the brother man uses his imagination maybe it was prophetic Vision maybe it was imagination we were not he doesn't really tell us you know the ram said if it ever was uh uh from the Lord it would give it thus saith the Lord you know so not sure but I just want to start hearing Genesis 3 you know eight and nine and how the Lord come down in the cool of the day he was coming down for that Fellowship with his children praise God Adam and Eve and of course we know he found he found them in you know a sinful state uh but you know I just thought it was uh uh you know interesting and beautiful here how how God had would come down every day to meet with his his children and I just want to say you know just a general look at scripture you know a lot of great things happen in the evening time you know uh when when Noah let out the dub the Dove came back in the evening time so he so uh Noah got this reassurance that God is going to keep his promise and it came in the evening time and the dove represents the Holy Spirit Hallelujah of course that's one type of the Holy Spirit course the Holy Spirit fell at 9 A.M on the day of Pentecost morning time so God's spirit can come at any time of the day but I just want to take this one thought you know I'm going to go back to Genesis yeah um you know God can come anytime but there's just you know these special moments in scripture where God ministered in the evening time you know Ellie easer had made this long trip you know to get a bride for Isaac and he came to the uh the place of the camels the rest his camps there uh you know that Layman's place there and and uh the Bible said he rested in the evening time he came to the city the well at the evening time and the Bible said that evening time he let out a prayer and he said oh Lord God I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham remember Abraham had prayed that the angel Lord would go before Eliezer praise God the Sea church when everybody's praying together God is going to work out everything in your life praise God in other words pray before the trip all right we got an Amish strip coming up right pray before the trip pray during the trip praise God pray after the trip in other words keep that constant communion with the Lord praise God and that's what Elias are experienced he knew the prophet had prayed for him but when he got there and he really needed God to move he said a humble prayer and he said Lord let it be this way Lord if it be your will let it be this way kind of like get in he would have fleece before the Lord Lord If It Be Your Will would you please answer this way and I'd heard that you know there was over a hundred gallons of water that Rebecca I heard a preacher say you know he he researched how many gallons to to feed those uh camel 10 camels how much water would you need for 10 camels 100 gallons that we just carried I carry five gallons of milk every Wednesday to my family you know five's a lot I have a hard time carrying it you know in my two hands you know I kind of grip them like this you know and I can carry those those five gallons she made all those trips think about that 100 gallons all those trips and it was an answer to prayer you talk about a worker how about that 100 gallons of water he was praying Lord give me a clear sign that this Rebecca you know or this woman whoever it is is a real servant may she want to labor may she want to just be a servant tonight and bring water to all the camels and so Rebecca got anointed by the Holy Spirit she must have had at this now the thing about that evening time she worked all day some of you moms and dads work all day you know and coming to the evening and God will give you a special anointing praise God he'll just anoint you to fulfill the word of God hallelujah that's what I'm going to be like on Wednesday night I want to be even though I work all day I want to be anointed of the holy spirit so God can still hear your prayers so I can put my prayers with your prayers and the Holy Spirit can so speak to us on the Wednesday night or a Sunday night I just think it's beautiful that she was able to labor let's say 50 gallons 100 whatever it was all those gallons of water and being led by the Holy Spirit to do that and didn't even know she was watering her trip to meet her husband praise God she was she was doing her part Amen to allow herself to be able to to leave you know her I'll say like this her family behind and go to meet the bridegroom praise God just a beautiful story it came in the evening time so Assurance came in the evening time for Noah here Assurance comes in the evening time for Eliezer I know God heard my prayer Hallelujah I know God heard the prophet's prayer and then even connected to that you know uh Isaac when he was out meditating in the field the Bible said it was that Eventide event tied in uh Genesis 24th later on in that chapter verse 63 he went out to meditate in the field at even time don't you like that time where you can just you know the world calls it me time I just need some me time but really for us it's not me time it's us time Jesus and me praise God hallelujah is that how you feel when you want to talk with the Lord you know it's not it's not really meantime it's it's our time together Lord hallelujah and so Isaac went out to have a little Lord time he went to have some talk with his Heavenly Father praise God he went out there to meditate on the things of God and his prayer was answered in other words his faith became sight in the evening time praise God he lift up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming there was his bride Hallelujah you know he'd been heartbroken he lost his mother you know but here in the evening time here comes his bride praise God and we know the scripture now and I haven't studied this one real deep but the Bible does say in Zechariah in the evening time it shall be light praise God in other words in a time of Darkness there's going to come a great light praise God and that you know I think that scripture has actually multiple uh prophecies in it being fulfilled uh of course we know the Jews will receive Jesus Christ right in the middle or towards the you know the middle of the Great Tribulation a time of crazy Darkness Unthinkable Darkness but in even in the evening time it shall be light praise God Jesus Christ will come to them at a nation 144 000 will be born in one day Hallelujah amazing in the evening time it will still be light praise God some person told me try to say that oh we're we're in total darkness and they said well I've got quotes on this we're in total darkness I said you misunderstood the quotes I said the world's in total darkness but I said if you turn to the Rapture scripture in first Thessalonians 4 and 5 the Bible said we are not children of the night we are children of the day praise God in other words even though the whole world is in darkness we've got a spiritual Shiloh we've got a place where God's light is clearly shining on our lives amen we're not walking in darkness we're not wondering and groping where am I what's we know we can see plainly that God is with us God is for us hallelujah we have fellowship with God we know where we're going Hallelujah we know where we're headed we know what we're living for praise God Amen we have light we're not just stumbling around can you imagine just stumbling around in the Darkness you know just trying to find your path that's not us the Bible says God's word is a lamp unto our feet amen and a light unto our path Hallelujah and so we have all these great promises you know in the scripture you know and like I said like I said there's many different types you could use for example you know we're talking about evening time right here with Adam and Eve and these different places but the Bible says the remember the parable of the wise and bluish virgins when did The Cry go out to meet him at midnight well that's way past the cool of the evening so see there's all these different and then brother man preaches Shalom and says we have a new day he said we started a new day the morning he said it's the morning time so that's why you know we don't I'm just we don't want to go too far on just one type you know what I mean because there's many types you can use we are children of the day you know so uh the beautiful part is we have we we can see we can see Christ in all these different types in the Bible so in one type it's midnight we're trimming our lamps praise God we're trimming our lamps getting all the uh uh all the all the dust out there and I should say dust but all the uh was the carbon getting all the carbon off our lamps you know getting it all trimmed so it can shine really bright another time and another type where right at the evening time the Sun is setting it's the end of the day praise God and another type we're in the we're in total daytime the Sun is bright and we're looking for Jesus to come praise God I mean there's all these different types in the scripture and they can be used for different purposes praise God but tonight is for communion by God's grace tonight is for a community so now with that said I just wanted to just that was just a brief review of just a few scriptures about the even tide but now let's go back to Genesis I want to just spend the majority of my time there reading a few quotes and you know looking at this scripture again you know we read no scripture but you'll see how brother Brown dramatizes this text that we read in a different way so we'll get to that in just a moment but um this first quote brother random says um God would come down every evening to talk to them uh this is from 1955. now in the beginning when God come down the evening and talk to Adam and Eve and the cool of the day his great voice whispered to them here we get a picture of God would come down and God would whisper to them at night time isn't that what you do when you get the kids ready for bed or they when you're really tired don't you just you shout and scream at nighttime no no you you whisper you kind of take your voice down it's evening time and they had Fellowship love one another how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the lions come up the Tigers all of them and they Worship the Lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him so Adam and Eve would come to a spot and they could imagine all the tigers and lions all the animals gather out in Adam and Eve I wonder if they got down on their knees and said we love you Lord they just had a worship service I love you Lord and I live Bible and he would just whisper my brother brother man dramatized it how was your day in my garden today did you enjoy your day it was beautiful Lord we got to eat from this tree and took a ride on the lion hey Melissa one day where's he she wants to ride one day on the line and I said I think he will if the wolf will lay down by the lamb I think he'll ride a lion praise God in the Millennium too I mean even before the future home but brother Adam said the Lord would come down every evening and talk and Whisper you enjoy walking across the mountains did you enjoy that hike now look they didn't even sweat the whole time can you imagine you enjoy running around the hills did you well how was your run today oh yes Father we we had our arms around each other as we walked around the Lakes thank you for this wonderful day in your garden Lord order of Adam climbed up the giraffe's neck or something like that or the the T-Rex because they had all those dinosaurs oh yes Lord I got to ride the T-Rex today great ride he would just come down and Whisper brother man says that then again in 1957 he says let's go back in our minds back to the Early times what a beautiful Fellowship it must have been when God called his children in the cool of the evening and communed with them he said then kissing them as it was on their cheese and laying them down to sleep for a night's rest and the wild beasts of the field he bedded down without any disturbance no no any any I'm sorry no harm no harm no death no sickness no trouble to awake on a new day to walk in the prince of their creator without sickness oh God our Spirits grown for that time again for that's what we were made oh my I was made that that I was just lay down and the Lord would kiss my cheek and say good night brother Jess and then all the animals would lay down each one by us it's going to be great one day Lord willing in the future you know in the Millennium brother will wake up in just the newness of the Holy Spirit our bodies won't be tired no aches won't be thirsty won't be I won't have a crick in my neck I got this morning I woke up with a headache right there'll be none of that nobody well lay down you know wake up and just in the freshness of the Holy Spirit out today it's gonna be a glorious day Hallelujah think about uh I got I got I got 990 more years left we've only had 10 years here we got oh my just oh I feel so fresh today oh my God made this Earth for that we would have peace and perfect Fellowship perfect communion that's what it was made for now we get little moments of that you know we get little moments where we wake up and we feel refreshed and the morning just seems everything seems to go right of course then there's the chaotic level and there's the chaotic mornings you know where it doesn't go so well you're woken up you know in shock or or anger or fear or or sadness you know different times different ways to wake up but brother Ram says that that's you know that's what God would do he would come down and kiss them good night I hope you enjoyed your day in my garden I love you my children can you imagine if you say that I love you Lydia and they would hear his voice sweep down then they would hear his voice leave good night Dad love you let's go to sleep come on Tigress let's lay down try to go to bed brother may have said now man was born to have Fellowship man in the beginning back in the Garden of Eden he had wonderful Fellowship God come down in Fellowship with his company of men and women every evening in the cool of an evening God would come down under the big palm trees perhaps his sacred light as it was shining down on Adam and Eve in that great Cathedral fellowship with God had nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping now you can picture again they would just wait there they would sing and pretty soon they would see the pillar of fire come down the light of God kind of like the dove descended right the spirit of God descended like a dove real real gentle that's how they just sing there until Spirit up the living and they'd see him descended oh Father come to Father come to you and he whispered talk about the day little Ram said that's what God loved to do God loved to come down and that was the voice of God walking with them in the cool that's when God come down evening time praise God well bam says but I love fellowship with men I like to go out and talk with people who loves the Lord and have fellowship with them because we see the same thing our motives are the same our ideals are the same I like to like to talk with people he said men that hunt and fish many times we have Fellowship together just sitting and talking around those things because we like those things but the greatest Fellowship any man ever had was when he had fellowship with God when God had gave himself open to man to Fellowship back and forth with his creature the Creator and his creature and God was fellowshipping with Adam in the garden of Edom Adam had nothing to worry about everything was smooth and right he'd have to worry about his clothes he'd have to worry about something to eat he didn't have to worry about sickness he'd have to worry about death or sorrow he knew nothing about them just the freedom like a child isn't that how the kid isn't that why we love the kids they're not worried about you know supper hungry they'll worry about worry about it they're not worried about it they're not worried about paying the bills they're not worried about any of the stresses of Life they're just loving life like I said one time they just go from one playing event to the next playing event a child's life is like one adventure to the next adventure until they get tired and cranky right but he said that's what Adam and Eve had freedom Adam had a heavenly father who watched over him in fellowship with him every day would it be marvelous if we could get back like that again foreign but do you know every redeemed soul today that's living under their privileges of that kind of fellowship with God he said do you believe that God will take care and provide everything that we have need of in this journey and at the end of the close of this old Mortal Tabernacle God's promise to give us another one of these fellowships amen says we can live similar to Adam and Eve we don't have to live with anxiousness we don't have to live with stress and worry or fear he said we can have some sort of that type of Fellowship like that if we want to how many want to have that today praise God just have a fellowship with God where you just talk with God and you hear his voice you he or you feel his presence just confirm something back in your soul oh that's so special praise God just he's going to take care of me I've thought this this week numerous times and over the years I just felt like Lord if you could just show me the end of my life and you can just show me how long I'm going to live and then I wouldn't even you know I wish I could just see it so I wouldn't worry about these next I wouldn't worry about any year like it I always think this how would I act if I could see the end of my life and know how many years I mean how much peace would I have like let's say I was going to die at 98 brother you know I hope so I hope I'm late to my funeral too but like let's say that let's say I was going to live to 98. it would just do me so much good like I wouldn't worry about these next few years I'm 41. 1 you know some 57 almost 50 years you know how would I live if I if I just had some some consolation you know now that's just a human natural thought but really spiritually we already have a guarantee of eternal life we already have a guarantee that he'll never leave us nor forsake us and I say that you know I say that um because I desire that but I also believe I should live higher I should live like God is going to provide all my needs I have nothing to worry about praise God and even if I do come up a little short I still have Jesus praise God like I worry about I'm not gonna have enough to feed the children like enough am I ever going to run out you know and not be able to pay the bills I worry about things like that but really I shouldn't worry about things like that I should have a fellowship with the Lord and I should just have a constant talking with him like the Lord I know you'll provide and even if you you don't you'll bring me through that test you you'll just be testing my faith and and I'll come out better like job or some type or some type of way or another I know my testimony will glorify you I shouldn't worry right I shouldn't worry I should just have fellowship with the Lord he said God will take care and provide everything that we have need of in this journey he says now here's why John 5 24 very very saying to you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past from Death unto life how many believe that scripture speaking of you you will not come into condemnation you've already passed death and you've already come into life Hallelujah Romans 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand so we are standing in the grace of God how many believe you're standing in God's grace I'm not standing in God's Wrath I'm actually standing in God's grace and we rejoice in Hope of the glory of God Amen Hallelujah so we're standing in Grace hoping and trusting that we know God's word will be backed up praise God God will keep his word God's word cannot fail us amen Romans 8 1 and 2. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death praise God are you walking after the spirit tonight praise God that's why you're here you're here to follow God's holy spirit as spoken Through the Bible and also through the inspired words of a Preacher through the inspiration that we get through songs and music praise God Amen Hallelujah like there's times you know brother amen would sing that that one song of my door is shut my eyes are closed I'm on my knees and my hands are up that that song brother would be with me all week there are times you sang songs and they're with me all week praise God it is God what is it it's God talking with me it's God fellowshipping with me praise God and those songs you know keep me in his presence they keep me talking to him they keep me praising him praise God I think that's beautiful Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God sometimes we need rehearse on these don't we which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things in other words don't think on evil things don't think on the the bad things that are going to happen think on the things God has already freely given us amen hallelujah that's my desire the Lord help me not to be anxious help me to be careful for nothing help me to cast all my cares upon you Hallelujah I want to get back to a quote here in the beginning man used to walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden he said under the palm trees he and his wife with the cool of the evening come along they come out and worship God had a perfect Fellowship now look when he brings the news off God Longs for Fellowship he yearns he wants people to speak with him talk with him how many of the married people know that you yearn for your your spouse that's the reason you got married you you didn't want to be alone you wanted somebody that would love you right so it is with God God yearns for Fellowship he wants brother says he wants people to speak with him to talk with him he says you might sing too much I know I preached too much he says you might preach too much I know I do sometimes but there's one thing you'll never be able to overdo that's praying because Paul said I would that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands see God wants you to lift up hands on your job God wants you to lift up hands at the church at your home God wants you to lift up and pray to him everywhere the Bible said let's all say everywhere every everywhere everywhere God wants you to pray you'll never pray you'll never overdo prayer because God loves when you talk and you express your heart to him even when you're wrong like David David and Jeremiah those are great examples Jeremiah said I would curse today I read that last week Jeremiah said I cursed the day I was born but then later he gets the fire of God shut up in his bones he gets a fresh he gets a Revival amen hallelujah you get a Revival Hallelujah that Fellowship God brings out God brings us back to that Fellowship you'll never be able to have two too much fellowship with God God Longs for his creature who created her who he created in His image to Fellowship with him wouldn't it you love to have lived in the time of that Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the garden he'd come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with him wouldn't that be marvelous we would all like to have that time but now I Believe by God's word I can prove that you to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God tonight right straight back to that kind of fellowship and of course those are the scriptures I've already given to you right and the scriptures from this morning right the blood the death of Jesus Christ makes us holy uh unreprovable unrebutable in his sight praise God isn't that what Adam and Eve had they had no sin weren't they holy did they have any accusers no did they have any thoughts no so see the blood of Jesus Christ brings our souls that's what we've got to know our souls not our flesh so much and not yet we've got to get a new body but Jesus brings our souls back to that same condition amen hallelujah in other words you're you're your greatest longings your greatest desires your very nature your your God nature that Holy Spirit nature that nature having fellowship with God it's just like the Garden of Eden again that's what I I think that's what every Christian knows that's what I know that's what you know when we have our most sincere prayers to God and we express the very deepest desire of our souls that's the same Fellowship that Adam and Eve had with God it has to be because it's God's nature in US communing with God right it's that it's the spiritual Gene seed that I am of God the spiritual part that I am of God you'll think about All God's Children I'm one of those seeds I'm one of those you are one of those Genesis of God but it's that it's that attribute of God having fellowship with his father and when we come to that spout when it's our souls fellowshipping with God then we're back to the Garden of Edom by the grace of God that's what brother man tells us he said I can prove to you by God's word we can have that same Fellowship here tonight praise God isn't that beautiful Hallelujah he says you do good deeds because you're a Believer but that but that uh but that doesn't do it by Good Deeds joining church is all right but that isn't what does it he says it's when you recognize you're a sinner lost and the only way God can see you righteous is through the blood of Jesus Christ and they said let me give you a scripture for this fellowship if you abide in me and my word in you you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you brother Adam said there's the secret of it there's a secret of the great life that's hid away in God see that knows no fear whether it's stormy whether the clouds are over or whether the moon's not shining or the sun's not shining they're still living in the Shekinah Glory there you are the so abiding Christ abiding in his promises as we said confessing your sins and knowing that once you confess them you're holy unreprovable unrebutable in his sight that's the same Fellowship Adam and Eve had in the beginning and church we can have the baptism the Holy Ghost in our souls they can never have it Adam and Eve could never have it but we can have something they never had now they had something we never had we never had a sinless state but we could have something they never had amen hallelujah so don't yeah I mean it's good it's okay it's okay to have Godly jealousy Paul says that I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy right so it's okay to have some Godly jealousy but church we can have something that Adam never had praise God True Fellowship of the Soul where Christ lives in US praise God hallelujah he abides in our souls Christ in us the hope of glory Hallelujah Abraham said that's the secret of it that's the secret of it abide in me and my words abide in you confessing your sins first John 1 7 can you put up their Malachi if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin just timeless timeless the blood of Jesus Christ gives us this Fellowship in the cool of the evening you know last last week I mentioned how God doesn't need anything on a Wednesday night remember that it's of Acts 17 God has need of nothing God doesn't need anything to exist he's just going to always exist he's always Eternal there's my half hour God doesn't need anything to exist according to acts 17. but he does have desires right the Bible said he would that all men be saved although we know not all men will be saved very few will be saved the Bible said God in Ezekiel 33 God does not Delight in the death of the wicked so God desires that they wouldn't be lost and the Bible said in Genesis 6 God's heart strove with men it was striving with men that they'd be saved that they'd that they'd instead of always imagining evil they would actually imagine the blessings of God and the righteousness of God and the Holiness Noah is preaching God was striving with them won't you accept my Prophet won't you accept won't you accept it God was striving with them so this statement is true God needs nothing but God does have desires your brother Adam said God Longs for our fellowship now here I want to read this quote brother remember gives us a different perspective about God coming down in Genesis 3 8 and 9 after the sin program gives us a different perspective I don't know if you've heard this before maybe he said God loves The Fellowship of this creature in the Garden of Eden we're told that when man walked in the uprightness of God God came down the cool of the evening and fellowship with his children but then one day a voice came up in the presence of God said your loved ones your children has fallen and they've sinned and have did that which was wrong so one day God of course God knew it was going to happen but one day that announcement came from the angels your children have fallen Adam and Eve have fallen and sinned and of course that would have been you know maybe the middle of the day the heat of the day well the ram said God didn't select some Angel to go down and look it over to see if it was so or not or a certain cherubim of the heavens he said but God came himself crying out Adam Where Art Thou God himself come down crying for his lost children so see we just read it we think God's like where are you Adam but man said he come down and cried Adam where are you now think about that God's spirit came down was walking he come up to have fellowship and his kids weren't there see that he come down oh he said uh he of course you know we know God was just you know putting on that right just like Jesus would put on that he was going to leave his disciples in Luke 24. but God came down to show his love for Adam and Eve he come down crying Adam where are you add where's my child don't you want to have Fellowship you come down to show Adam and Eve that he so much cared about you didn't send the angel after them he came himself he wanted to show them I love you and I miss your fellowship he's crying where are you where are you where are you that's how it is sometimes when people will leave our church like I'll just cry like when a Brother's leaves or sister leaves a church I'll just weep and cry I just miss their Fellowship wow what have I done like I'll search my heart sometimes I'll have trouble sleeping at night when people leave like what have I done where did I and my wife have to assure me no Jesse you preach the truth they just they don't want to obey the Bible and come to find out later that's usually what it is but that's the spirit of Christ in you you want to go out and you want to bring the lost one back and that's what God did I missed that Fellowship I missed fellowshipping with these brothers and sisters that you know that they just leave us we miss that because we at one time we had everything in common and we love talking about the things of God but in times sin got in there brother Masters the only thing that breaks Fellowship is sin the only way to get it back is the blood of Jesus Amen Hallelujah so it's God's love that came in and he was crying Adam where are you Eve where are you my daughter my son where are you of course he knew but he wanted his children to know that he missed the fellowship now Church don't you know God misses our fellowship but we don't fellowship with him does God understand of course God understands you know Wednesday night I preached so hard and we Fellowship so long I woke up and I didn't have a chance to read my Bible and pray and all day in my heart I didn't feel condemned felt empty like that because I made sure you know that on Friday morning I had that time with them all I miss talking with my father praise God so we want to remember that that God and that's what I wanted to be I want to be where I'm not condemned if I miss Fellowship but I'm sad because I missed I knew God's spirit would come down and meet me there when I missed that time with the moment I was so looking forward just having that time and if I don't get that time with the Lord I'm sad about it like the Bible says the next day I need to make my calling and elections sure and make sure I have that fellowship with my Lord with my father if not Church we're going to get into bad habits right and and habits are what evil spirits bad habits are evil spirit good habits are the Holy Spirit bad habits are the evil spirits LeBron says again in Fellowship 1960. he said uh he said Adam and Eve would come up and they would worship God they would have fellowship and commune one with another that's the very thing that caused us together like this he's talking to talk about the church in Middletown Ohio setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit no difference in us we're all one in Christ Jesus in that Perfect Harmony of Fellowship there's nothing like it I've ever found on Earth hallelujah it's to come together in Heavenly places and have communion fellowship with god with each other now that's what God intended in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah Church isn't that how you you know I saw how I look at brother William you know we get like six months with him like the last two years we get six months but that's how I see I don't see any difference between him and I because we're all one in Christ Jesus Jesus died for him just like Jesus died for me and I love when we can have fellowship and we can talk about things that we agree on right that's how we love it with all of each other's all of our all of our fellowship when we talk about things that we agree on the Bible says it's Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when God is speaking to us when God is using gifts in our lives to help one another to strengthen one another that is fellowship in Heavenly places we're experiencing the very highest blessings the very highest form of existence we're experiencing it when God is hearing our prayers and answering our requests right here praise God you know it I know it when we try to fellowship with worldly people it's just not the same right but we can fellowship with God's people around the truth of this message this Bible truth there's no greater Fellowship than that praise God Hallelujah like today even with you know communion with Austin and Jose you know we just got to praying and fellowshiping and we're all three of us crying there and I'm just I'm just holding their necks like this I'm like there's no better Fellowship they're just dealing with God's people that we're we're trusting in the blood we're all Sinners we all fall short of God God's glory but in our souls we're not sinners in our souls we're redeemed sons of God in our souls and we can have that the same Fellowship that Adam and Eve had in our souls that the Bible says the spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God think about it while the world they're out in the bars tonight or they're out shopping at Costco you know which is okay I guess you know but you know they're they're at the bar watching the Browns make sure the Browns win devoting three hours to the Browns and here today we've wrote a six eight hours to the Lord Jesus Christ what a blessing amen and what a fellowship what a joy Divine leaning on the Everlasting on this is real Fellowship in Heavenly places praise God let me share this I know my sister listens to I talked to my sister yesterday but you know Emma was with us for two weeks and she had told us the other night you know every night we the cool of the evening every night in the cool team we gather together for Bible time now I told everybody amen some of those nights I'm really tired I feel cranky not every night but some of those nights because I'm exhausted preaching teaching yelling all day you know preaching but you know after two weeks Emma just announced in front of everybody these are my favorite times of the day this is my favorite time of the day you remember that she said that like I didn't even have nobody cursed nobody asked her to say that she just announces these are the best times because we're laughing we're talking the girls are hugging on our little ones they're all kind of arguing who gets to hug him but you know yeah that's what I love about God that everybody can hug on God when we have fellowship at church here when Jesus comes we can all fellowship with him praise God amen doesn't have all of them Lydia doesn't we all can hug on Jesus I don't have all of Jesus we can all have Jesus amen I thought that was so special and she just told me yesterday she said you know what I want for my life brother or Uncle Jesse I was like no she's like I want to have eight kids and have a family like this that really blessed my heart you know really eight kids I said just be careful Emma a lot of it falls on love Dad gets a you know leave unless he's a farmer you know works from home on his computer which I wish I could do that I enjoyed that when we had that covered time that was a really good but yeah I thought was so special you know evening time when everybody gathers together that's just like Adam and Eve adamy would gather and I pray worship all the animals come all their all their animal children you know they'd come in they'd all just rejoice and sing before God we're so special that Emma could come to our house and she can feel the prince of God come down and just enjoy talking enjoy laughing enjoy singing asking questions about the Bible worshiping the Lord there's something in us that desires that I thought it was beautiful that our sister you know felt that same thing there's nothing like it I've ever found on Earth program since then fellowshipping with God's children where we all agree on the word of God we all love Jesus Christ we're all here for one purpose to go to Jesus to serve our heavenly father he says uh in my time of fellowship and communion that's where God speaks to me that's the way we want to get in the spirit of it he says do you like to pray through and get in the spirit brother Ram ask that that's the only way you can do it shut yourself off from the rest of the world and get along with God that's the reason that you like to do that because the first couple came on Earth Adam and Eve it's what they now notice brother Adam said getting a loan in fellowship with God but he included Adam and Eve when they Fellowship they weren't alone right it just wasn't Adam fellowshiping with God it was Adam and Eve but the reason church we like to get along with God and we like to sing and worship and get in the spirit is because that's what our parents did in the very beginning that's the reason we love evening time Fellowship that's the reason we love evening time communion because Adam and Eve and God used to do that that's the way God would come down he let them you know work all day or play all day but then he would before they went to bed he would come down and he would receive their worship he would talk with them ask them about their day kiss them on the cheek and then he would go back his Spirit would go back to Heaven as a pillar of Fire that's why we love the evening times Hallelujah he says God made one preparation for man to be restored back to fellowship blood was the way back for Fellowship Hallelujah said did you notice God come down the cool of the day the setting of the Sun there's something about when it starts to get night people think of church and of God and Christians you see the sun setting you realize that your son is said and in the cool of the evening he'd come down and commune with them and there he lost that Fellowship because sin would not let him do it and then he was made flesh and dwell Among Us in order that he could come back again to man and live in man and restore man to that state of communion with them again and give him back his god-given right that's what he did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost so now we're getting back to the Holy Ghost our fellowship I'm almost done here it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your Fallen lost brother sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt The Lost Ones as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or woman when it strikes into their heart and takes a bow there's a thirst and a hunger for lost souls remember last Sunday we prayed for lost souls that's a wonderful service wasn't it pray for lost souls prayed for Revival he says that's what the Holy Ghost is there for in you to go after The Lost Ones to pray for the lost ones that's fellowshipping with God he said there's a hunger and thirst for lost souls that's what the that's what's the matter with meetings today there's not enough Spirit touching it to go for the lost and the dying it's more of a make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul-winning program how pitiful he said we could stay on it much so I just thought you'd like that quote that was a beautiful quote the reason we like evening Services is because it reminds us our lives are going to have a setting to them one day and we are assured at the end of that we'll go to see Jesus praise God when our day closes we'll have a new day we'll have eternal life praise God a new body and now the holy spirit is in us today to try to go after lost souls that's why I love when you know Nina will come up for prayer for her family or her sister how many times have we prayed for your family just in tears right you know like last week got the prep here for Wesley in tears you know we got to pray up here for different ones I was crying for my dad you know that is eternal life in you that's you having fellowship with God that's you feeling what God felt when Adam and Eve were lost praise God and so you feel that same Fellowship that God had I want the fellowship back and when you desire to see your lost ones come in that's the same thing God desires for all those lost ones to come back it's the heart of God it's the heart of Christ amen it's the desire it's the longing of God you're longing for their Fellowship amen you're longing for real fellowship with them when they can Fellowship on the truth of God's word praise God when you can fellowship and agree on everything and you don't have to avoid talking about Jesus so I long for that day amen when I don't have to be the one to bring up Jesus with my dad you know or I'm not I don't have to be the one to bring up Jesus or the message with my mom or something or my mother-in-law or whoever may be but God's spirit can grab a hold of them if it be God's will amen hallelujah if God will answer my prayers if it's the will of God where they'll want to bring up the message they don't want to bring up the truth they'll win a fellowship then we can have real Fellowship then we can have a real conversation we can enjoy we can be in one Accord that's what God desires one Accord intimacy and that's what it means intimacy praise God Hallelujah so these evening Services remind us of Fellowship God's fellowship with his children praise God and I was reminded of Wednesday night's sermon Ephesians 3 9 to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery so Paul says the Revelation come to show us the fellowship what is the fellowship it's the intimacy of the mystery it's knowing god and making him known that is the fellowship we know God is not three persons we know God is one person praise God we know Jesus is God and our desire is to make all men see the intimacy or the personal relationship of this mystery of Christ in them the hope of glory now is there a part of suffering yes Philippians 3 10 to know him and the fellowship of his sufferings so part of Fellowship will mean suffering for Christ but part of the fellowship is also intimacy of his love the power of his resurrection we don't want a part of Jesus we want all of Jesus we want the suffering we want the power of the Resurrection we want the revelation we want fruits of the spirit we want all the fellowship Jesus has we want all of it part of it's going to be suffering The Fellowship of his sufferings yeah I'm almost done we read in Colossians 1 21 keep it up there Malachi the Bible said you were sometimes alienated the word alien in the Greek I just forgot to look it up this morning it means shut out a fellowship you were an alien you had no fellowship and you were shut out like Adam and Eve were shut out of the garden they were aliens now to the prince of God but Jesus when he when he took the veil the Bible said God rent The Veil from top to bottom you're no longer an alien come on into Fellowship he's saying come on in you can have an intimate walk you can hear my voice you can follow my leading praise God you can know my will you can know my heart praise God you know my heart my heart longs for other people to be as well you are not an alien you are not out of Fellowship as long as you confess your sin you have Fellowship you have intimacy with god oh it's a beautiful promise beautiful promise brother Ram gives a prayer for a sinner now look look how he prays he said if you've never accepted Christ say this I want to accept him now and be meek and gentle all my life instead of being angry and harsh and bitter that the Holy Spirit would talk to me in the cool of the evening when I lay down my pillow at night I raised up my hands to him now when was the last time you did this church on your pillow you're on your pillow and you raise your hand up and say dear heavenly father I so love you and to hear His Kind tender voice talking back to me and say child I'm so in love with you but remember I said that's what the whole the holy spirit will tell you I'm so in love with you I'm glad that you accepted me I wanted to love you so much when you were unlovable but you wouldn't let me love you but now you've made it right and I can love you and we can be friends together brother man says don't you want to do that isn't that beautiful I just thought that was so special in the cool of the evening you lay down I love you Lord and Jesus says I'm so in love with you brother sister I'm so in love with you you're my friend I am so glad we're no longer enemies we are now family that's what God would speak to us in the evening time that's why I love that song you take me just as I am you know what's the name the one you love that's why I love that song it's to me it's all about the joy of salvation God's proud of me God loves me he's so in love with me that's what the quote says so here's one time I can say let's say what the tape say right God is in love with us praise God God he's so in love with us he's so glad we opened our hearts to him he just wants to have this fellowship with him this communion with him and last uh that scripture uh John 17 24. little man said Jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father you know what it was one thing after all of his sacrifice all he did here on Earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing that where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship I'm sure brother Williams heard this hundreds of times throughout the years right things that are to be 1965. let's look at Jesus prayer father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that I may be whole that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world so just leave that up there I'm praying that those you've given me can be with me where I am see Jesus knew he had a place Jesus Knew by God's promise he had a certain place he was going to be ruler of the world praise God he's going to rule the world with a rod of iron but his prayer was his father let those that you've given me let them be with me so I'm not alone let me have a bride amen that's my prayer my prayers let me have fellowship with this group that loves me let me have this fellowship with this group that you saw in your mind before the foundation of the world that you'd wash in their blood you'd make them holy unrebutable praise God unrebrewable praise God no faults no accusers this Blood wash group let them be with me where I am praise God Jesus was asking that you could be with him in eternity how many grateful for that and then he prayed for you in verse 20. neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so not only did he pray for your fellowship he prayed that that by that you would hear the word of God and respond to the word of God all as I am Church all we are is an answer to Jesus prayer and our fellowship also with Christ is an answer to his requests as well praise God let's stay in our feet as the musicians are coming here we'll just sing a song and then we'll get ready for communion remember Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Adam said there's threefold purpose to uh to Christ right preeminence God wanted preeminence in Jesus first second God pray one in preeminence in his church and third God would bring his children back to the Garden of Eating conditions and brother Adam said he said it a different way he said it thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them so after God gets preeminence in the bride we'll go back in the Millennium and also the future home we'll go back to the cool of the evening Fellowship where we can all gather together we can have the animals with us and the holy animals Hallelujah but none of that we'll have holy Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus and we'll all gather together and Christ will come down and meet with us in the cool of the eating we can have perfect Fellowship again how many looking forward to that by God's grace let's bow our heads here as we pray here and ask God for his grace as we approach communion here by the grace of God Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight Lord I've tried my best to convey these thoughts Lord as I I read through them over these last few days or one thing is clear you are longing for Fellowship and Lord Jesus as high priest you even prayed let
