bibles out here we'll go right to the scripture let's go to ephesians chapter five let's look at uh the mystery of church as the bride of christ we'll look at that again part three tonight i need some readers so uh haven't cursed think so i think you want to read no cares okay sorry that i know lydia mal kind of case you hopefully can read by god's grace hallelujah look at part three tonight by the grace of the lord uh some of this will be familiar but we are lord willing we'll get at the end we'll get to the five principles i never saw this before but there's five things paul said a wife uh should do for her husband and likewise five the husband for the wife i never seen it the way i've seen it now with the scripture and with a spiritual wife the church so it really is clear now i've never seen those five things so uh i like to hopefully get to that tonight by god's grace let me see a little timer here okay ephesians 5 32. i'll take that for our text tonight it's like that nice short verse oh yeah and i got my memory verse too i need to get that too so let's read both of those ephesians 5 32. this is so mysterious paul said it wasn't just a mystery it was a great mystery how christ is the husband of the church ephesians 5 32. let's read that on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church praise god first samuel 17 47. first samuel 17 47. thank you first name of 1747 praise god maybe we'll sing that at the end the battle belongs to the lord praise god it's a beautiful song let's read this memory verse on three one two three and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into my hands praise god let's have one more word of prayer let's bow our heads here tonight heavenly father lord we just come reverently we come humbly lord our hearts are full of joy as we sing about the rapture a chariot of angels coming down to pick us up lord god what a blessing what a privilege you did it with elijah and that was under the blood of bulls and goats what will you do under the blood of jesus christ oh god so we thank you lord for your amazing grace lord god lord imagine you won't send a chariot you'll just come yourself lord god and you'll meet us in the air as the scripture says hallelujah it won't be a messenger it will be the one that the messenger is pointing to the god of heaven jesus christ hallelujah lord we're preparing we're making ready tonight lord god for that moment we're making ourselves ready the bride does that and father we come here to be washed by your word we come here lord to make you our head our ruler our decision maker so father we yield to you tonight bless us now in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise god lord willing i made a little a reminder on my phone um for some this sunday night we'll have a little bible study with the kids and i'll have the girls we'll have to adjust that camera so it doesn't get the kids on sunday night so just i'm just letting you know to remind me and remind you so um and so both johnny and i were talking he was saying well brother jesse i like i want my children to know answers to questions like why do women have long hair why don't brothers wear shorts uh why don't women preach you know just questions like that uh and we so i thought that's a good idea we can train up the little kids you know and they can hear it and have a good bible-based answer so i thought that was good but johnny said he's been to churches where you know they asked the he asked the teenagers you know uh why do why do why do we believe this why do we believe in brother branham and they don't know all they know is brother brown quotes they don't know the word and uh so hopefully our children uh have a good understanding of both by god's grace and if not that's what we want to do we want to build that up we're going to build them up with scriptural answers then also be able to say well brother branham taught this too we want him to know both so lord willing on sunday night we'll start that we'll see how long it will we'll do it maybe we'll do it for a month or whatever we'll see uh did you remember in sunday school years ago i did that i caught it catechism because the word catechism means uh answers to questions do you remember that it was at the other waterloo church maokai do you remember i used to i used my uh powerpoint remember that that's okay i thought maybe you might remember but it's been years and years and years so uh lord willing that's our plan uh you know feeling led we want the parents you know we want everybody to uh have their needs met you know if that's a burden on people's heart then we certainly want to uh do that i think that's a great desire i was just looking for that uh i couldn't find i was looking real quick on my no not on there stop to look and find it i know if i dig a little bit i'll be able to find it must be on another document okay well i set my timer let's do 30 minutes by god's grace part three now let's go to start in galatians one so lydia malachi well we i'll have you two break up these verses uh acacia first corinthians 7 14 for you amen all right haven't you going to join us today all right glory haven you'll do acts 20 verse 27 haven praise god all right so we ended last time by looking at how uh there's the apostolic blueprint for becoming a bride member it's hearing the preaching in church when you and i receive the preaching of jesus christ we repent and get baptized we have uh engagement to jesus christ the bible said he's espoused us to one husband even jesus christ praise god i wonder how many people really knew that when they got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that you were getting engaged to heaven's bridegroom praise god it was an engagement service praise god but that's what paul says you're espoused to one husband christ now this section tonight i want to look at this called uh the unchanging gospel blueprint so this blueprint cannot be changed so lydia why don't you read galatians 1 6 let's see 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. so read 6 uh read verses 6 7 8 3 6 7 8. thank you is thank you malakai read 9-12 please do i now persuade men for god or do i speak to these men for if i let these men i should not be the jew of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel is amen there is a whole couple sermons just in this text here i'm just going to hit the highlights here by god's grace paul indicts anyone who would add one word or take one word away from his teachings this is an indictment he's shocked he's marveled how could this church that we started be so soon removed we just planted it a few years ago and we'll go back and see the years on that but how could they so soon be removed what were they doing they were adding circumcision back into it remember in chapter uh three it talks about that they were saying oh if you if you're going to be saved you've got to be circumcised and then he has to remind them in chapter three how did you get the holy spirit by the works of the law or the hearing of faith amen so he's shocked they're removed and he said anyone's curse whether we or an angel change the bible epistles that paul gave us they're cursed now we know today we looked at it recently there's permanent curses people curse to hell like cain balaam and but there's temporary curses upon people who are saved like uzziah right like king saul godly men for a while solomon they served god for a while but because of consistent iniquity they had curses upon their lives many times it was enemies they had to battle in fact i was just reading today who was that josiah at the end of his life he was a mighty king but then of his life he got a little lifted up he thought i can go back and i can fight and god said thus saith the lord don't fight he went to fight anyway he disguised himself remember that but he got hit by an arrow and he died yet they still honored him but you know see he died prematurely because he didn't honor god's word right uzziah died prematurely because he didn't honor god's word so this is what we say today are you brother jesse are you saying every church that doesn't believe the message is cursed to some degree i believe that to some degree because the bible says if you change it there's some curse that's going to come upon the people now church many times it's the slumber-ness right many times it's the lukewarm condition right they're rich and increased with goods have need of nothing and they don't realize that their lives are lukewarm before god think about that jesus said this age is going to have either hot lukewarm or cold god help us to be hot amen i was feeling hot during swing low sweet chariot amen i was feeling hot this morning when i prayed and read my bible and i was recording the next chapter i was feeling hot for jesus amen but we're sometimes up and we're sometimes down in our minds praise god but not our souls amen we never backslid we don't go throughout day backsliding into awful sins in our minds though we're sometimes up sometimes down but yes i believe it i believe people's eyes are are blind spiritually i believe their ears are dull of hearing and it's a temporary curse it's a temporary punishment upon them for changing the gospel i believe that's on the churches that reject brother branham and i believe that's on the churches that exalt brother branham there's some type of curse upon them because they're doing that and many times it's a prideful thing right many times it's a prideful thing i think many of the churches are like that they get cursed with a prideful spirit and god will bring down all those who are exalted with pride now look church are we pleasing men tonight or are we pleasing christ christ we don't worry what people say you know whether people like the gospel or not let them leave right if they don't want to stay let them leave but if they love jesus christ then they'll want to stay because we're preaching christ's gospel and we're not changing a part of it at all we're not trying to persuade uh men with a man's doctrine but with the word of god praise god and he says any servant of christ will not try to please the people he'll just preach the gospel amen and he's he certifies them he gives them a certification of proof i am not preaching this from myself jesus christ gave this to me by revelation hallelujah amen the revelation of jesus christ came to paul now i want you to see it where paul taught the same thing in every church so acacia first corinthians 4 17. yeah timotheus hey man what a beautiful every time i bring this up to the people that hate long hair on women they have nothing to say this has happened numerous times this past year i bring it up well no that was just for the corinthian church i said paul paul told timothy tell every person in every church i preach the same thing in christ everywhere praise god i love it the bible just leaves all these nuggets in there if we're willing to dig down and search it out thank you acacia beautiful remember in acts 20 verse 27 haven what did paul tell the ephesians acts 20 verse 27 you got that sweetie amen remember stay there three years so within three years we know you can preach the whole council of god within three years i've been preaching we'll hear what 14 almost 15 years i believe we've heard the full counsel of god amen i believe that there's only one faith paul says in ephesians 4 5. can you just put that up there occasionally just so we can see it i just want to remind us all there's only one faith and we're not being prideful by saying we believe it we're just being humble we're saying thank god he gave it to us amen right not that we're better than anybody but we do have a higher calling and we do obey the scriptures better because the bible says there's one lord one faith there's only one baptism there's not many different faiths there's only one faith now jude one verse three libby can you pull it up there on the i'm sorry on the computer hun you pulled up there on the computer sorry thanks for being so flexible there i just want everybody to see him by god's grace jude 1 3. so paul says there's one faith and jude says we must earnestly fight for it right it must earnestly be contended for that's why i went to the brothers in jeffersonville that's why i did the debate because i'm trying to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints i try to do it in love beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints praise god amen thank the lord now paul received a direct command from paul i'm sorry no timothy received a direct command from paul to keep every word of god in first timothy 6 13 and 14. hold up there lydia first timothy 6 13 and 14. many don't know about this one this kind of flies under the radar a little bit beautiful scripture i charge thee look at that a charge a command in the sight of god who quickens all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witness a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ amen and the church said hallelujah timothy had to keep it until christ came do you think it changes for us or do you think we still got to keep it amen we're still keeping it because he said keep it until you see jesus amen hallelujah wasn't a pick and choose well this was just for that church or that church it was for all the churches amen now there were certain problems in certain churches like you know uh fornication at corinth uh circumcision problems you know a galatia every church had their different problem remember that he those hebrew christians brother cam brought brother simon brought out they were babes in christ that was their problem instead of being teachers they backslid so far that they needed to be taught water baptism and salvation all over again that's how far they backslid paul cried writing the philippians a letter in philippians 3 17 19 which hopefully we'll finish sunday we'll see maybe i can finish that chapter on sunday philippians 3 17 18-19 paul says he cried because of the enemies of the cross of christ for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping now think about that he received these letters from jesus christ he gave him out and then when he sees people break them he starts crying you know why because it meant a lot to him because he met christ out there in the desert he left everything he knew he left the pharisees right he left all the apostles once he got saved he left all that met christ out there had a beautiful experience with christ and took his time wrote the letters and then to see those people change what he sent to them made him cry praise god ah because he cared so much about them that they are enemies of the cross of christ can you imagine being an enemy how could you be an enemy to the cross of christ because jesus says take up your cross now and follow me so see they're enemies of self-denial they're enemies of holiness right they're enemies of obedience right they're they're lovers of the lusts of the world all that jesus died to forgive people of they're lovers of that so now they're enemies of the cross and they heard paul and they read paul's direct letters fresh letters right just written on ink and parchment they read those fresh letters and they became enemies of the cross of christ i don't want to fight against the cross i want to take up the cross hallelujah but it's not going to be easy it's never easy verse 19. now look whose end is their destruction so these people are going to hell right those that are enemies of the cross enemies of righteousness and holiness whose god look at this their god is their belly that's who they worship oh if i can just get more for me and whose glory is in their shame remember the bible says the shame of your nakedness appear these are people that they glory in those you know sexy dress and all kinds of things they glory in that but the bible said it's their shame who mind earthly things they care too much about earthly things may god help us to set our affection on things above amen especially this time in a difficult time of the nation's going through here right here so paul wept when he saw people that they worshiped their bellies they worshiped themselves after getting the revelation of jesus christ he called them enemies of the cross they were more after earthly things than they were heavenly things what a rebuke now go to second timothy 2 16 through 18. i'm almost done with this section here then we'll get to this this five attributes of a submissive woman and a submissive church to christ second timothy 2 16-18 here paul rebukes the false teachers by saying their false doctrines are gangrene a flesh-eating disease and it literally destroys the faith of bride members or i'm sorry potential bride members potential right so they could be they could be uh potentially engaged to christ but when satan uh preaches his false doctrine and they accept the false instead of the true paul says their faith can be destroyed and church that should remind us of jesus's parable there's four kinds of grounds two of them are saved two are lost what happened to the two lost one of them satan just come and snatched it right away overthrew their faith the other one he burned it down with the heat of persecution and offense to withered away they slowly became less and less excited about god less and less interest in the message withered away and their faith was destroyed that's what paul says false doctrine destroys it overthrows the faith of some now what were they saying the rapture's already happened think about all the people that say brother you know the rapture already took place in 1963. i preached at a church like that in arkansas sad situation the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some thank god not all amen hallelujah praise god not all are going to be deceived the elect will not be deceived praise god those who love the world those who whose god is their belly they'll be deceived but not the elected amen now jesus solomon and john all say we must obey all the word of god jesus said heaven earth shall pass away my word shall not pass away not one of those commands will pass away solomon says god will call men and women liars who add or delete from his commands in proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6. every word of god is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and now be found a liar think about all those preachers that jesus is going to call liars at the white throne judgment they knew the baptism was wrong they knew the trinity was wrong they knew all these things were wrong but they told the people anyway oh it's true it's true and god's going to jesus is going to call him liar you lied to the people you deceive the people and john of course in revelation 22 says if you add to the word plagues are added to you if you take away god's part god will take your part out of the book of life and i love romans 3 verse 4. pull it up there acacia romans 3 verse 4 this scripture proves god's word is our absolute it's your final word it's your unlimited source of strength it's your anchor praise god amen it's your umpire it's your stoplight it's your stop sign praise god it's your judge it's your supreme court praise god it's your north star the word of god is everything god forbid yeah let god be true but every man a liar as it's written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might has overcome with our judge how are we going to overcome church by the word of god now let's get to this last section here i got uh 12 minutes on there but i'll probably go over a little bit than that okay go to ephesians 5 22 ephesians 5 22 in your bibles if you got them now before uh any brother wants to jump on a sister and say sister there's five things you got to do for me let me remind the brothers that jesus said the husbands have to love first praise god you know brother some brothers get in the wrong spirit and they just demand they just demand that the woman follow through but first they got to be leading with love because jesus didn't demand at first jesus led by love the leader is the servant praise god the one who has real love is the servant but we're looking at of course the we're looking at the spiritual application of these commands to the the wives right now paul uses husband and wife relationships here to express five attributes christ desires in his bride a woman always represents a church ezekiel 16 7 says god calls israel a woman and acts 7 verse 38 says moses was a part of the church in the wilderness okay so god calls israel a woman first but then she's unfaithful and then mo or i'm sorry stephen calls israel a church in the wilderness a bride in the wilderness so church and bride are always the same so the first aspect is found in verse 22. i'm sorry 23 go to 20 verse 23 i'm sorry hon ephesians 5 20. for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body now brothers before we could jump on our high horse we got to be willing to save our wives help them in every way we can jesus didn't lay aside some of his time he laid down everything for his family praise god right he laid him his whole self behind so a brother that's got the wrong attitude and wants to demand things he doesn't have the spirit of christ yet because the spirit of christ makes you a servant the spirit of christ makes you love first and then hope for love later right now jesus didn't have to hope he knew who'd love him but as brothers we have to hope amen we have to trust that our wives and our children will follow our example if we really lead with love in our hearts amen so the first attribute is the church of jesus christ has only one head the real church not the denomination the real bride of christ and who is christ christ is the word john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god so the word is the only headship now most churches you know are married they're headed by man-made creeds right bylaws traditions and they always contradict what paul wrote on many many things so let me ask you does the world rule those kind of churches is the word the head of those kind of churches no it's just like the pharisees they had made their man-made interpretations greater than the law of moses and jesus rebuked them in matthew 15 he said why do you transgress the commandment of god by your tradition that's the same thing we can walk into any denominational church tonight and say why do you transgress the commandments of god by your creeds right we could say that same thing why do you transgress the word of god and allow homosexuals to be married right why do you transgress the word of god and you make uh the wine and bread the literal body and blood of jesus christ right why do you let women cross-dress and men cross-dress why do you transgress the commands of god by your tradition now think about that church every church in this area would be guilty of that right so it's not that we're angry or upset i know i'm speaking a little stern tonight but it's just because paul said it in such a a such a simple plain manner to change one word brings a curse and so we ought to be thankful church we see the blessings of god on our lives right i see it all the time with friends that i s that i work with not so much anymore because of covid but when i was around the brothers that were in denominations you can see the the troubles they have in their lives like money trouble marriage trouble all kinds of troubles and they're little curses on their lives they're addicted to movies you know there are all kinds of secrets that they hide you know they have all these troubles on the side maybe adultery you know maybe all kinds of fornication all kinds of problems they're cursed because they change the word of god they don't believe the full word of god jesus said they on they draw an eye with their mouth they honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me praise god church it doesn't really matter what we say or what how we act it's what we do at home praise god it's what we do when we're out in the public it's what we do with our families doesn't matter what we say it's what we do praise god because the pharisees honor god they sang beautiful songs they dress nice and they dress holy which is good but they didn't keep the commands of god the word wasn't their headship he said in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so a lot of those people we know it we see it a lot of them are worshiping in vain their worship doesn't change them right how many people how many people are still laying out of church and they because of covet and they can tell it's really not a pandemic they're just laying out because it's easy right they're just laying out because uh their their worship is made anyway man they reject the headship of the word and i'll just have to close in a few minutes here so just bear with me now in this book church i list 10 of the most sinful teachings churches promote that say they're the church of jesus but these prove they're not let me just i'm going to list them off quickly homosexuality adultery they marry them two three times four fornication they support that they don't preach against that abortion murdering babies women preachers substance abuse viewing sinful movies and television shows shameful hair lengths false conversions they say they're born again when they're not even sanctified and in modest clothing there's 10 right there 10. how many more can we do if we put the catholic uh bread and wine in there i mean you start listing off all the things you can put in there really adds up quick doesn't it now remember paul said don't take one thing away look at that paul preach all these church we if we had the time we could go through all these here's one you don't hear often on homosexuality so in case you pulled up first timothy 1 10 and 11. here's one most people don't catch there's a few of these i thought i might bring out they might be a help to you now remember paul calls it a reprobate mind in romans 1 but we read that often i'm not going to read that one in first corinthians 6 he says uh homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of god and first timothy 1 verses 10 and 11. first timothy 1 verses 10 11. for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for men stealers for liars for and persons if there be another thing that's contrary to sound doctrine according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust so whoremongers is that same word for lying with mankind let me look it up real quick yeah that one does yeah it can mean that sodomites defile themselves okay yep homo sodomi homosexual yes theirs so that defile themselves with mankind that's one that is kind of left off the radar sometimes this one on women preachers we haven't read lately so let's read that first corinthians 14 acacia 36-34 first timothy i'm sorry first corinthians 14 34. we always we normally read the one in timothy but let me just show you how paul is so paul's so bold with this he says let your women keep silence in the churches that doesn't mean no praising it just means no preaching because he's talking about in this context who the word of god comes to right that's not in verse 36 we'll get there he said for is not permitted to them unto even to speak but they're commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law so paul's saying the old testament law still has weight in the new testament right god still has that same pattern women were never priests right that remains here the spiritual priesthood now remains women are silent in regards to the word the spiritual leadership and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home there must have been women debating in the corinthian church they must have debated right after church right because he says wait till you get home and talk about now our sisters don't do that now i've had a couple of that have left though i've had a couple debate me right out in the hallway and brother brooks brother brooks that i talked about last time there should be a woman here that used to debate right after and and say oh yes was wrong and you said this wrong brother brooks still remembered that my goodness now see they're not under the headship of the holy spirit and if they will learn it okay it's for it's even a shame for women to speak in the church when it regards to the word verse 36 what he says came the word of god out from you or came unto you only so do you get the word and are you the only one who gets the word he's saying i'm the only one who got the word praise god these corinthians didn't write the bible paul wrote the bible jesus chose him to write the bible if any man think of himself to be a prophet or spiritual let me acknowledge the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord oh it's just a small thing brother just is it a small thing [Music] it's an awful thing for a woman to try to lead the men because that's out of god's order all right now i thought that would be helpful maybe you haven't seen that one for a while now uh the substance abuse especially for our children children anyone that would smoke try to get you to smoke or drink or do any evil substance abuse any drug you've got to turn them down because you know it's a it's a demon-possessed person trying to do that to you and even in the areas of liberty right we talked about wine a few last year we talked about wine wine is an area of liberty people could drink that in their house if they wanted we choose not to so i know some people that do in the message i know some people that do that's fine but paul said if that would cause somebody to stumble i wouldn't drink wine in my house as long as the world's standing praise god that's a long time right because this world is going to remain standing right for a long time so let's read that just so everybody sees that romans 14 21 there are liberties in christ right there are liberties food right meats and uh you can vegetarian i believe christmas goes in there celebrating holidays some of the things people do i think that falls in there holy days yeah that's right holy days it's all coming back to my memory a little bit go to romans 14 21. you got that occasion all right let's read that him that is weak in the faith receive but not to doubtful disputations that's verse one can you go to verse 21 sorry about that 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak so anything we would eat or drink there's my timer so let me set five minutes that's only 35 minutes can you believe that he says uh if it causes somebody to stumble then we shouldn't do it right we should stay away from that uh for time's sake acacia first corinthians 8 13. first corinthians 8 13. so anyone offers you cigarettes or drunkenness or oh i'm at my friend's house in the message oh they're let's let's get some of their wine we can have a drink of wine i don't i wouldn't do that i'd stay away from that thankfully no one's ever offered me that yeah here it is wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend and all the children said that's beautiful hallelujah if anything would cause somebody to stumble then we should just not do it and the way you know is if they saw you do it like especially something that you'd watch or something you'd eat something you'd do and then they do it and they stumble right or they fall away from the gospel now hopefully by god's grace god would show us if we did something like that that would cause us to stumble okay so i just showed you 10 church can you imagine that just 10 simple doctrines that most churches deny can you imagine that church it's like they're preachers picture that it's like they're preachers when they get ready to preach they got scissors and they cut out those scriptures can you imagine a preacher doing that if he would come to the church and he would cut out first corinthians 11 about hair length can you imagine that's what they do they literally i said they literally they spiritually do that they cut out the parts about marriages and how to live holy they cut it out and they're bringing a bible that's got holes all in it and paul said to do that you're cursed should we cut up the bible or should we keep it the way it is keep it the way it is yeah we don't want to cut out one thing we want all of it amen praise god like my man said lock stock and barrel we want all of it praise god hallelujah let me close with this last thought here so everybody can see right everybody can see christ is not the head of most churches now church it's so easy now you just got to go on youtube and type in men's hair length right men men in shorts like answers are easier to find than ever in other words people have less digging less effort and so that's why god in this last age gets such awful judgments in the tribulation because all the knowledge was increased right knowledge has increased it daniel said and yet they still chose to turn down god's knowledge and that's just 10 of them that's just 10. like i said we can add communion we can out leadership pastors we can add all these kind of things in there that they break the word of god in those areas and someday i like to do that brother branham said there's hundreds and marriage and divorce he said there's hundreds of these things he said i can name but here's just one of a marriage and divorce so in closing you and i know most churches do not make jesus the head of the church he's really not ruling right even there's a rock and roll i could add a rock and roll right i could add that one of them and on all these ten scriptures there's no scriptures on the other side where it's okay for homosexual relationships to exist where it's okay for adultery to exist right can anybody think of one okay that's why i asked the people i believe a sign can you show me one time god ever asked a godly woman to cut her hair they didn't have no answer they got one of these emojis right now they didn't send it but that's what they should have sent me i don't have nothing or maybe it was that head-blown emoji right because that's what it was to me when i realized wow god never asked a godly woman to cut her hair the only people he asked to cut their hair was israel when they were sinning and they're going to be judged and kicked out of the land as a shame and then the slaves the slaves from heathen countries the women that they brought into their marriages right or slaves or concubines they made them shave their head for 30 days right for 30 days they had to wait before they become a part of the family that's the only time god ever asked a woman to cut her hair never a real godly woman you never find home you know you never find a woman preaching in paul's meetings or cutting their hair see the holy spirit will uh the holy spirit will do this first attribute it will lead the real bride churches to make christ head over everything how many want christ to be the head of your life praise god let's stand we want christ to be the head of this church who do you know which churches do you know that keep all 10 of those simple commands there's 35 minutes can you imagine that musicians if you'll come which church do you know and like i said in the next week or two i'll get to the list there's a list by size uh the pew research center lists all the denominations in church we can go with each one and we can go to their web page and show you where they deny paul's teachings how can the bride how can the bride make their creed the headship rather than christ they can't it shows they're the false bride we're talking about who is the real bride of jesus christ who's the one that's really married to him that really loves him amen we'll keep every word and we'll make him the head let me just preview for next week so you see the second attribute she's submissive to everything so she obeys all the way third thing she submits to christ washing her with the water of the word the fourth thing is she's glued to christ she's joined to christ and the fifth thing she's an attitude of reverence and that's the one i think american churches need the most help with just an attitude of reverence to christ right that word means to be in awe like whoa to be in all of oh my i'm going to be real careful you know i say like this i really felt it when cam was here preaching remember i came up here after that morning service and i was like we heard from heaven you remember that i was like we are that's i that's when the last times i could no i really enjoyed sunday that was beautiful that was glorious but the last time i really felt like everybody was in awe was at that service and we want to keep that i'm thankful that we can we can return to that atmosphere right we can return there but this is an attitude that we want to have all the time amen because the bride reverences her husband in everything amen praise god so may god help us have an attitude of reverence for christ that's what i want to get to maybe next week we'll look at those other four but i'm glad jesus is my head amen i'm glad jesus is the head of this church praise god he tells us what to do we got some learning to do absolutely i want to learn praise god i want to grow i want to be more like christ and we are so let's bow our heads here in in prayer let's just pray let's pray two things let's pray that uh we can always keep christ as our head in everything and then let's pray for our friends and loved ones in churches where christ isn't the head that god will show them that [Music] like when i talked to my mom a few years ago she knows her denomination christ is not the head there and i pleaded i begged with her to come out i remember with brother bang's little brother one of his little brothers i was pleading with him i said when are you going to come out of your denomination when christ is not the head but graham said thus saith the lord all denominations will take the mark of the beast [Music] something that has to be decided as a bride as a woman as a church the church has to make a decision is christ going to be my head is going to be his commands going to be my absolute or something else going to be my absolute heavenly father we bless your name tonight bless you jesus bless you bless you hallelujah jesus
