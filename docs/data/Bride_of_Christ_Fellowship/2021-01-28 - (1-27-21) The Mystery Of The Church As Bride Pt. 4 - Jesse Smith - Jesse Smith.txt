have glaucoma in my eyes when i did that when the doctor told me that i had really given the first i get nervous and i couldn't believe really and every day that you know you're not having anything when somebody tells you that you are safe but then after i left the office today i said i'm not going to assume i have that i refuse that amen the lord i am not that's right amen yeah and sorry there

just to get to akron all the miles sister naomi had to fly to get to akron praise god and so god is rich in mercy we're thankful that's right the smallest international church of all time so we are so thankful and i wouldn't have it any other way as we heard on sunday we need to be content and the holy spirit gives us power to be content no matter what state we're in and it's just receiving more of his strength all the time so god wish to bless you brother we'll keep praying for you and uh that if satan tries to bring back any boxer rattlesnakes we'll refuse it in the name of the lord great beautiful testimony thank god for that praise god so i'd like to uh just take about half hour here let me set a timer here this may be my shortest sermon ever unless lydia maokai can remember when i went shorter ever go short in 30 minutes okay and there's a reason to you know you know i don't know if you remember but usually in january february i cancel the evening services i've done that the last five or six years you know i'll say we'll take a little break right uh but i didn't this year and that's because we got the bland's driving um and i didn't know if karen and brenda would come on sunday nights that would be their only service they could come so i would never want to cancel someone's only service to be in the house of the lord so i haven't talked to karen or brenda yet so if they're streaming god bless them i can just remember to text them again i did a few weeks ago but i haven't done that and so i just want to be mindful too of my health and everything every winter i get sick because i don't sleep enough or i don't eat right or i push myself too hard or you know so if i can get a little bit extra sleep on wednesday nights i think i'll be healthier by god's grace in fact i know i will be so uh thank you for your patience let's just take about a half hour we'll try to get into this series now just so you know i am studying more on other series i just feel like i want to finish this one here um i've been studying on joshua i want to preach a whole sermon on the whole message on the the book of joshua i've been hearing all these thoughts i've been really enjoying them some from brother branham some from other ones i've heard online really good thoughts about joshua and just possessing the promises so i want to get to that series i still want to preach a series on the life of jesus i want to get to that i want to finish philippians one day i want to finish i could just get through that series but you know i had numerous testimonies from sunday morning service so people learned things they were humbled and people emailing me about what a great service that was so i thank the lord for that just god's grace we just have to stay in the channel of god right we have to present our bodies a living sacrifice and if we present ourselves as a sacrifice and it's acceptable unto god god will use us and so we just want to do that we just want to be led by the holy spirit uh and i just released the youtube video this morning about the 10 books uh the 10 best books to me i put it out at 6 a.m this morning and so if you i mentioned them briefly on sunday morning if you want to watch that you can see that um so that was just put out this morning and hopefully that will be a help to people i got one mistake in it just so you know over the jose there's one mistake guys i talk about jesus as the unleavened bread and i've made a mistake i kind of feel like i can relate to brother brandon how he'll make a mistake on tape i said the unleavened bread represents jesus's sinful life so just so you know i made that's an awful mistake but i my note said sinless life but i said sinful life so i'll probably go back and fix that but then i got to re-upload it so i don't know you know brother graham's mistakes on tape they just live on forever right you know so i don't know if i'll do it or not but i did make a awful mistake there and i was just reading it i just said the wrong word i know jesus lived a sinless life i know that he became sinful for me he took my sin upon him but i just made one mistake and i appreciate the brother who caught that a brother emailed me this morning caught it right away uh so i did say sorry but i'm not sure if i'll you know like brother brown will say on tape that he said rebecca went to marry her wife she married a woman according to that quote well it's a slip of the tongue you know same thing uh for me so you know if you watch that just be aware of that it's around the 18-minute mark he pointed out today so so let's look to the word of god here now ephesians 5 uh 32 we read that for our text here i just want to lay down in uh these thoughts here there's five attributes of the of the bride paulus for you and i now we should be really familiar with these attributes right because we we just don't call ourselves a church now we call ourselves the bride of christ and so if we call ourselves that we must live a higher calling or else we're just hypocrites right if we call ourselves a bride but we don't live like a bride should live then we're just hypocrites right we're sinners but we don't want to be hypocrites we want to be sincere christians praise god we want to be pure holy before the lord we want to be jesus's bride now we looked at verse uh i believe it was 20 i can look it real quick here we looked at verse uh 23 yes and we saw our first attribute was that christ must be the head of the bride we saw last week there i just listed 10 quick uh doctrines that prove most churches do not make christ the head homosexuality they adulterers fornicators murdering babies right women preachers substance abuse uh evil things presented before your eyes movies shameful hair lengths uh false conversions and in modest clothing that's just ten of paul's doctrines how many more could there be that people break throughout the scripture so that they're not the head christ is not the head of those churches so if we're sincere we honestly keep those we have a good chance to be the bride amen a lot better chance than denominations now if we're born again then we already are bride by god's grace but i just want to leave that out there brother ram never said well uh without a doubt i'm the bride he said i'm trusting my names on the lamb's book of life right remember that quote from the the seals the questions answers on the seals they said brother branham can you prove you're there no he said i can't prove my name's there he said god could use me as a tool for something else he said but i'm believing my name is there i'm living like my name is there praise god now the second attribute is in verse 24. let's read that ephesians 5 24 i won't have readers because i only got 25 minutes left so therefore as the church is subject in the christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything now this is scripture gotta bounce out not in sinful things right a woman doesn't submit this sin so that means in everything that's holy and good praise god so she's subject in everything so bride members uh are happy and they're supposed to obey every word of god just like jesus said i don't live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god or the mouth of god rather now obeying god is not should not be a hard thing right but it is sometimes to our flesh and our mind not to our soul but it can be a hard thing uh if we are for not living from the born-again experience so first john 5 verses 3 and 4 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for what sober is born of god overcomes the world amen and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith praise god amen so see church paul's talk i'm sorry john's talking about this he said faith overcomes faith is our victory is faith but it means faith that continues to grow praise god right he just said if you're born again it's not a hard thing to obey and then he says faith overcomes the world right so faith will overcome the world to be saved but then you grow in faith right from faith to faith right from glory to glory right you keep growing in the things of god so you're born again and then it's not grievous it's not a a difficult thing to obey you love to obey right that's the word of god and that's why many churches have a hard time they talk they just they just take the the commands out of their creeds and bylaws because it's grievous to them they don't want to obey but the bride loves to obey it praise god because that's her victory amen that's her victory even her faith in god's word and obedience to the word of god that's her victory what other churches can experience her goal is total submission to christ in everything she wants to be holy because jesus is holy peter tells us this first peter 1 14 peter says as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be holy i'm sorry so be ye holy in all matter of conversation because it is written be holy for i am holy now where's all those people that say we're not there's we don't need the old testament anymore peter's quoting deuteronomy praise god where god says be holy because i'm holy so again we see this idea of the moral law right or the the righteous laws of the old testament being carried over to the new praise god and this isn't a man we're wondering is he born again or not peter was there he had the keys to the kingdom he opened up the door to them to get the holy ghost for the jews for the gentiles for the samaritans this is a man he knew something about being born again praise god and so he's polling old testament scriptures saying this is a righteous this is a moral thing you should be holy because christ is holy so the bride feels the same way all right now i'm going to move a little quicker that's the second attribute is submission in everything so until uh we obey everything we still need to come to church and hear what the lord says out of his word right because we're still learning to obey praise god right because it's everything everything now the third attribute is in verse 26 it says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word so the third thing the third attribute says she allows herself to be washed she lets christ wash her right and the bible says in first peter 1 22 you're purified in obeying the truth through the spirit praise god so obedience to the word is what washes you so when you obey the word you and i should feel a washing at least over our souls i had a sister in the message one time tell me she don't go to this church uh lives many miles away she said i don't feel washed when i obey and i said well you ought to in your soul right you know because she said she battled with cutting her hair and you know she said she don't feel pretty and and battles that doesn't feel clean well i said well i don't know about your mind battles but i said the bible says if you obey you feel pure in your soul praise god see the trouble is people are too busy listening uh to this out here right and paying attention to what this says and what's in here they got to get alone with god so they can see what their soul is feeling praise god they can feel what the soul is telling them praise god with the holy spirit inside their soul the nature of the holy spirit inside they can listen to that nature they can feel that nature praise god because when you really get down and get quiet when you really are still and know that he's god you feel the holiness of god you feel it inside of you so i can't i i never was a woman's i can't relate to maybe what they go through but i know the bible says if you obey you are pure in your soul praise god that's scripture can you hold this up here acacia acts 22 16. the bible says when you repent you ought to feel your sins being washed away praise god and now why tarist thou arise be baptized wash away thy sins calling upon the name of the lord this is speaking of the apostle paul amen right he was guilty of holding the coats and he dragged christians to prison but ananias says he said wash away your sins we should feel the cleansing washing of forgiveness praise god amen when we come up to the get prayed for or we confess our sins or when we cry and say god forgive me we should feel the washing waters how many like the warm washing waters of the holy spirit praise god saying you feel god forgiving you and you have confidence i'm not going to do that again i'm going to overcome i won't let satan tempt me like that i won't let him uh get me i'll have zeal and i'll overcome next time i'll be more than a conqueror praise god amen amen hallelujah see it's the washing power of repentance by obeying the word now church also connected this if you got your bible go to revelation 1 5. go to revelation 1 5 and revelation 7 14. the bride will submit to the washing of waters by the word and many times church this is overcoming sin in the midst of persecution and temptation i just read it this morning i was reading my bible in the prayer closet and it said you ought to rejoice when someone says something evil about you and i started to smile and said praise god i got different people say evil things you know they email me things like that i said praise god i ought to rejoice this is the washing process praise god because look what the bible says from jesus christ who's the faithful witness the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood so when we see our former sins leaving us when we see our lives as more holy we ought to thank god and say jesus is washing me with his word amen revelation 7 14 oh it's beautiful revelation 7 14 and i said to him sir thou knowest he said these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb amen see when you go through trials when you go through persecutions and you you call upon jesus give me your strength give me your strength to forgive give me your strength to love i can do all things through your strength lord when you do that and you repent of wrongs and you do the right thing it's like jesus washing you from the dirt right it's like jesus washing you uh from a hard day or the sweat or whatever it may be or you know just the blood or the stains just washing it all away he said you overcome this way by letting jesus wash you getting through the trials getting through the persecutions overcoming sin and doubt and unbelief that's jesus washing you that's beautiful that's the bride that came through great tribulation how did you get there she washed her robes white in the blood of the lamb hallelujah church we know what first corinthians 1 18 says pull it up there acacia where is the power in the bride how does the power of god get to the bride it is through the preaching of the cross amen ah we ought to we don't appreciate that when when when anyone's preaching on the power of the cross that jesus died to wash you that's the power of god amen we want to see it always or maybe we sometimes you want to see it just in miracles and signs and wonders we thank god for healings but the powers in the cross right the shed blood how jesus conquered every sin amen he conquered it and sometimes we forget that that's where the power lays amen the power lays in the preaching of the cross jesus condemned all those spirits jesus conquered every spirit because they have no right to be there because jesus paid for them to be cast out praise god amen he paid the price for all every sin that could ever be committed he paid the price he took the punishment of every sin that we deserve and the power is in the cross amen hallelujah thank god that's where the power ladies church when we accept the preaching of god's word the forgiveness of the holy spirit that's where the power is amen to the world it's foolishness but to us it gives us strength amen strength to go another week how many got strength to go another week can you go a couple more days let's see wednesday thursday friday saturday can you go four more days i should know that there's four days till sunday yes because you get power from the preaching because the preaching points you to the cross and that's where uh the the sin debt was paid that's where your healing was purchased that's where your forgiveness was purchased reminding you of the power of the cross of christ that's where you got washed amen oh that's where the blood flowed down like a fountain amen hallelujah the bible said that's where the saints get washed in the blood hallelujah thank god so the reason churches don't get washed is because they don't preach they don't preach all the word right they don't preach all of the cross they don't preach all of god's teachings and i just listed 10 of them above right now remember your mind must be renewed or washed the bible says uh let me read that uh i'm going to go to ephesians 4 22. well you know i don't have time to read that i'm let's go to titus 3 5. let's go to titus 3 5. that's a big long text here i'll have to preach at another time titus 3-5 titus 3-5 now verse three talks about how he used to be ob or disobedient and foolish hateful wicked verse four but after that the kindness and love of god our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost isn't that beautiful praise god how did god save you he washed you and gave you a regeneration right a transformation that's what the the scripture says that's what happens not by our works but he washed us praise god we didn't wash ourselves praise god we couldn't wash away like the bible said can a leper get rid of its spots we couldn't wash it away in our own ability a special kind of soap had to come a special kind of bleach had to come right to wash away our spots the bible said it wasn't by our works but by mercy merciful washing of christ renewed by the holy ghost so church when you know that your mind may be backslid for a while but your mind is now renewed and your mind's on the right things you know you've been washed hallelujah thank god amen thank the lord so jesus constantly washes his bride the bible says so that's the third attribute she will make christ the head she'll submit to everything and shall also be washed by the waters of the word glory now the fourth one is in ephesians 5 31 so i'm going to go back there ephesians 5 31. ephesians 5 31 for this call shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh paul again quoting what genesis the old testament right giving it authority in the new now that word join if you look it up means glued it literally means glue right the wife is supposed to be glued to the husband okay and so we see that christians how are we glued to christ well through our our spirit we're supposed to meditate on the things of god we're supposed to pray without ceasing amen we're supposed to stay in that constant connection we're supposed to be in constant contact with the lord now of course you know we physically gather together like glue as well like jose said we're his family amen he's our family because the bible said in hebrews 10 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and the good work so one of the major points of coming to church is to think about other people how we can provoke them how we can help them how we can inspire them how we can stir them up praise god amen not forsaking the assemblies of ourselves together as the manner of some is not letting the glue be broken right not letting the bonds be dissolved right but gathering more as we see that day approaching you can't separate the bride from her husband nor can separate the bride from the bride amen right the sad part is most people are glued to their phones right or glued to the latest sports game now that's back on it's back in season right they're more glued to that than they are glued to the church and christ oh but thank god church we can fulfill the scripture just as eve uh and adam were joined together as they became one so christ and the church will be one as well amen and the last one i'm down to a few minutes here the fifth attribute is reverence i i ended the sermon last wednesday by mentioning this go to ephesians 5 33. so all these attributes did you catch that man i never caught that until i started reading this five attributes of the bride we gotta have all of them if we're gonna be the bride we must obey in everything we must be washed christ must be our head and we must be glued and joined one to another praise god and lastly we need an attitude of reverence ephesians 5 33 nevertheless that every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and see that she reverence her husband see that she do it that he do it right i'm sorry that she do it make sure she does that she really needs to reference her husband and husbands you really need to love your wives amen right and the bible says oh yeah that's right it's the same for the husband because the bible said he ought to give honor to the weaker vessel so it ain't just a woman who's you know real meek and quiet all the time and just reverence her husband but the man gives honor and thinks highly of his wife and wants to help her out the best he can right now you know reverence i read it last week in the greek means to be in awe of or to think awesome of so just speaking the name of jesus ought to be a sacred or hallowed thing to the bride church we got to make sure we don't make it a joke at times right we got to make sure we don't let it become too easy for us to say it or or are too common for us to say it that's why it's good that we're in church tonight praise god amen yeah because we we need reminders we need constant reminders to reverence the lord amen like if i could get to it i want to get to this thought tonight i don't know if i'll get to it oh yeah maybe i can get to it we have so many false prophets now in the charismatic movement that they don't reverence god that they don't even they they make millions of dollars they have millions of views on youtube they make all these false prophecies this is how much they only have that much reverence for god because they just constantly falsely prophesy in his name they use his name anyway to say whatever they want all kinds of false lies and false prophecies but you and i if we're the bride we won't do that we won't speak his name unless it's in reverence because the bible said let her have him in reverence see that she reverence christ jesus the lord he's not somebody you play around or boss around or tell what to do that's why if you don't answer our prayers we can raise our hands to heaven and say i still believe you lord i still reverence you praise god although my guy didn't get in the guy i voted for trump and pence right before even though my prayers weren't answered i never prayed more i ever did that don't affect me at all i'm still oh i know god will use this person to bring him back but whatever he's doing it's his plan it's not my plan i'm not trying to find my plan for my life i'm trying to find his plan for my life praise god he's got the plan for the world not me i'm supposed to submit to his plan and trust in his plan i'm not the boss of this thing it's i it never was supposed to be uh lord my will not thine be done that never was supposed to be that it's supposed to be let thy will be done not my will that's just one simple example the husband is great in the woman's eyes and it causes her to be meek and humble she's careful what comes out of her mouth she has quiet strength right and she has the treasure of a meek and quiet spirit a humble spirit now the woman the natural should have that and that should be a type of the church the church should be meek towards the lord right the church should be humble before god let's read that first peter 3 verse 4. now this is what our sisters should strive for our brothers should spiritually strive for this and then like i said honor for their wives honor if you honor somebody you don't disrespect them right you show them respect you think highly of them sisters let it be the hidden man of the heart so if we want to show reverence what has to happen our hearts have to be changed right we have to have soft hearts tender hearted the bible says in that which is not corruptable even the ornament and that beautiful that's a good thought your soul is incorruptible because the seed of god's in there praise god see your character is incorruptible when you have the character of christ built into you that's eternal life praise god that's eternal character amen doesn't corrupt even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price it's a great victory as our sisters are meek and quiet praise god right towards their husbands it's a great victory when our brothers honor their their wives that's a great victory it's a great price it's not a small thing it's a great victory glory now paul closes ephesians 5. now i notice verse 32 is that our text the mystery as christ and the church this is all about christ in the church you know a lot of times we'll use this text for marriage teaching that's great but this really this tonight this is the way it should be preached it should be preached for the church as a whole to reverence jesus christ and obey every word of christ that's really what it boils down that's the real reality of it but he ends it verse 33 nevertheless that every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband praise god so brothers we have a great duty as much as we love ourselves we need to love our wives that same way right that's why i tell my wife i say honey if you need something get it because that's how i am if i want something most of the time i'm going to get it because why should i wait without it if i can get it you know what i mean why should i make my life harder you know it's going to be i'll make it easier that's why god give me that money to spend what am i gonna do take that money to heaven am i gonna turn to heaven i'm gonna i need to use it here that's why the lord gave it to me praise god to take care of myself now there's a time and season that was the other time to save there's a time to give there's a season to lose and a season to get but it's it's this idea of love well if i'm taking care of myself i'm definitely going to take care of my wife that's what the scripture says so he ends this on love a husband loves and a wife reverences she stands in awe of her husband i wouldn't say nothing against that man of god i wouldn't say nothing against him he's god's servant remember that story from mishawaka i wouldn't say nothing against god's servant that's a strange situation brother man woke up in that at home he went remember went to the black man's house with his wife and he was gone but just brother man was there and his wife was there so i don't know or maybe they had kids or something but he said uh where's your husband sister and he said he left and uh he's gonna be gone for a few days and brother man said well did he leave you with any money she's like no doesn't that upset you and she said no i would never speak a word against god's servant that's a real respect right there praise god right god help us all we all need more reverence for the lord we need honor for one another and we need respect for jesus christ we can do it we are doing it by god's grace but like the bible says we can grow in this grace also there's 30 minutes i'm going to go a little bit more in 30 minutes okay i'll set another timer so paul ends with love now let me end with this thought about false prophets and i think this will make us thankful for the churches we live in you know sometimes i get discouraged or we don't see enough prophecy but that's okay because you and i should not even try to get close to prophesying unless we know it's god because if we do if we go past that it shows we lost our respect for christ we lost our reverence for the name of god when we start trying to speak for him and it's not our duty to speak for him now i don't have the video but i was gonna maybe i'll share it on sunday but anyways we the next section is judging christian groups by their fruits the bible says i told this to a work co-worker today her name is mindy no one's gonna know who it is but i gave mindy my book and she loved it and she gave it to some amish people she's not i mean her hair shorter almost as short as mine but she said she loved my book so i don't know what to i don't know what to say about that anyways she wanted she wanted five extra copies of my book i gave it to her that was last year anyways i ran into her today and she said you know where i'm doing another bible study i said great great get to know the bible she said i don't want to judge anybody and i said that's right mindy i said we don't judge their eternal destination but jesus said judge their fruits and judge their actions she's like that's good i said that's what jesus said i just read it this morning actually on the note sorry that i was right it was ready right there ready to go we're not to judge the destination but we are to look at their lives and see what's coming out of their mouth what do they believe and how do they act we're supposed to judge that that's our duty to do that the bible said prove all things test every spirit and jesus specifically says warning us about men right matthew 24 4 and jesus answers to them take heed that no man deceive you now god by god's grace i would never want to deceive you that's why i even told you my mistake on the video this morning i ain't got nothing to hide i'm a man i'm not i'm gonna be judged by christ uh hopefully on the when judgment rewards are given out not the white throne judgment my god that's my prayer but see i i would never want to deceive you i would never want to bring a preacher in here that would deceive anybody and if so i trust god would give me grace to not invite them back but jesus specifically warns us of false prophets and we can only judge groups as as they adhere to the word of god as they're glued to the word or they detach from the word of god that's the only way to judge them so church we're not being prideful when we can say this church is truly not the bride i just gave you five five easy attributes to show if it's a bride church or not and we should be able to clearly identify if a church's bride or not right because either they keep those five things or they don't and they're so obvious right outward appearance is very obvious marriage situations are very obvious right uh all kinds of other things we listed there there's so many they're so obvious and so it's not we're like we're being judgmental but we are judging what we see we are uh and can i just say like this analyzing the situation to see what we got i mean i'm not sure how house to say it we're looking at the reality of the situation when i watch these videos yesterday and today i was so blessed uh there's a minister and this was really something and i'll just have to tell you i have to show you the examples maybe sunday if i can i still want to show you examples of good and bad music and i still want to show you these examples there's a charismatic movement which you know it's called the word of faith how many ever heard of it it's big names like benny hinn right uh creflo dollar right uh kenneth copeland those are probably the biggest names you might hear of well every year they make predictions right about what the year is going to be like and they say the lord came to me in 2019 and told me that it's going to be like this and then the next year is going to be like this well this one brother not in the message he went and he looked at all their predictions for 2020 and i watched the video or i listened to the video today while i was driving and he put 20 preachers on their big name preachers and showed all their predictions for 2020. now who would have thought church in 2020 that we would have had a global pandemic shut down almost every section of society right shut down sports uh government the middle class restaurants hollywood so this guy i i i made a comment that when i just made this stop i said thank you for your great work he and he he ain't even a message you believe he ain't even pentecostal but i thanked him for his work and all 20 19 of them didn't say anything about anything hard now can you imagine all 20 said god told me about the year 2020. all 20 of them said blessings prosperity stadiums are going to be filled with all kinds more stadiums than ever going to be filled with people praising the lord and god on purpose look at that on purpose god showed them that they're false prophets but you should see their incomes they keep going up you should see there are youtube videos millions people keep going to these false prophets you know why because the bible said they love false prophecies put up jeremiah 5 31 it's scriptural they say they keep to themselves teachers having itching ears tell me lies they want lies and you can hear it they clap for the lies year after year after that's because church they don't have the spirit of truth but we got the spirit of truth praise god amen or we don't want lies we only want the truth of god jeremiah 5 31 it's okay to gang it up the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love whose people god's people now they weren't true god's people they were just called by god's name just like today they go by the name christian but they're really not god's people because god's people god's true people they don't love lies they hate lies and my people love to have it so and what will you do in the end thereof that's uh jeremiah 5 31. and we know jeremiah is a big rebuke right it's the last one the last prophets before what was the last prophet and then zedekiah last king were taken out of out of judah that was the last king and then it was exile time for 70 years the last one and the people there they love the false prophecies so the brothers showed 20 preachers before 2020 that all said good things and only one woman said well i see a crisis but then god's going to give great grace after it now can you imagine something that's never happened in our lifetime before and nobody god didn't show it to all these prophets and then after colvin struck he showed prophet after prophet the same ones said they to end and it's going to get better and it got worse and they all said in the name of the lord i cursed this coronavirus and then the election came in november and they all said trump was going to get a second term every one of them now church that that's just three and it happens every year year after year after year that's a woman that's a false bride that doesn't respect the lord because she speaks in his name lies she deceives in his name but the real bride reverences the name of jesus and won't speak anything unless it's thus saith the lord how many believe that if you want the link let me know i'll share it with you after service or something like that it's a it's amazing to see him say that and then i saw i love youtube boy yeah there's a lot of things i don't like about youtube but that's one thing i like about youtube they got those videos saved on there and you just got to click and say what'd they say last year what'd they say last month what what are these so-called prophets see they didn't see nothing they saw what they saw was the lies from satan is what they saw all right let me close we are to judge individuals and situations the bible said heretics avoid we're to judge individuals and say that's heresy and we are to avoid them jesus christ said judge not according to the appearance he said but judge righteous judgment don't look at just outside things that you see right judge righteously remember paul prayed for the philippians remember this i love this from chapter 1 philippians 1 verse 9 and 10 i pray that your love may abound more and more knowledge and in all judgment all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that's why i want to get to that music thought that's why i'm going to get to these examples of false prophets because we're supposed to show this is go this is okay this is excellent this is calmly to worship god this way it's the right way to worship god we're supposed to be the ones approving and we should grow in this like our standards shouldn't get lacked we see so many people in the message their standards are so high but then they fall over the years that's not a real christian a real christian grows in judgment praise god it doesn't lay down the standards the christian raises up the standard amen raise up a standard against wickedness remember paul said who is the mature christian he said those that eat strong meat they he said they are skillful in the word of righteousness but baby christians can't judge what's right or wrong like i asked the brother on the email yesterday i said well is billy paul the real joseph or not he said i can't judge it because in 1951 brother ram said billy paul said joseph in 1956 he said joseph is joseph i said if both of us saith the lord which one's joseph are there two josephs and they said i can't judge well of course you can't because you're a baby right if you're a real mature christian you can you can exerci exercise discernment to know okay this one was this was just a feeling this was his personal opinion and this is the real one right here you can judge that because you know god's word doesn't contradict itself right and that doesn't make somebody uh stumble it makes somebody who's who's exercised who's mature in judging situations not according to appearance but judging righteous judgment now let's stand to our feet here musicians you can come lord willing next time church i'm going to go through catholics protestants ether and orthodox anglicans oriental orthodox mormons jehovah's witnesses you name it in the book i show all where they get off the word of god because the bride doesn't get off the word of god the bride i'll say it again the bride doesn't get off on the word of god she's in the word all the way she don't obey in some things she obeys in everything and if and if jesus wants us to obey everything he has to make a way for us to achieve it praise god is by the indwelling power of the holy spirit just feeding that power growing in that power growing in love growing in judgment paul said that's my prayer that the church will grow in judgment we want to grow in knowledge there's 1.3 billion catholics there's 900 million protestants there's 270 million ether eastern orthodox there's 110 million anglicans there's 62 million oriental orthodox and there's 37 million others i guess worthy all others oh my goodness and each one claims i'm the bride i'm the right well how do you know uh we got a good we got a good measuring stick right here praise god amen the bible calls it the canon we all walk by one rule one measuring stick here's the the judgment for god's bride oh i'm so glad church we have a way to know who is the bride oh it's a mystery it's a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church let's have a word of prayer here just play a piece of god cover me tonight five attributes of a bride i'm gonna say lord help me to manifest all five lord you be my head help me
