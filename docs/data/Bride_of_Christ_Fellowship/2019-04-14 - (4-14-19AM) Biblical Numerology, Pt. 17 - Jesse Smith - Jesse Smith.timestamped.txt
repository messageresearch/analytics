[34:37] Christ this morning and certainly a
[34:40] privilege to be gathered in his name yes

[35:26] fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty

[35:33] jubilee unto you and you shall return

[36:01] that's about heads for word of Prayer if
[36:03] you have an eat on your heart just make
[36:04] it known unto the Lord this morning
[36:07] surely God is all we have need of this
[36:09] morning and you're here to have him meet
[36:13] your needs also to give him glory and to
[36:16] worship Him this morning
[36:17] Heavenly Father Lord my hands are up and
[36:20] surely I've need of you Lord and father
[36:22] we bow again in prayer Lord we ask Lord
[36:24] God that nor the Holy Spirit will have
[36:26] his way this morning father God thank
[36:28] you for your presence your your constant
[36:31] abiding grace and Lord your supernatural
[36:33] power Lord to continually change our
[36:36] lives as we learn to lean upon your Lord
[36:39] God as we heard that song Lord God we're
[36:41] so grateful for that where we Lord want
[36:43] to just sound that that trumpet again
[36:46] this morning Lord as the preachers are
[36:48] commissioned to sound that forth to blow
[36:50] the gospel trumpet it's the year of
[36:52] Jubilee and so father Lord we just
[36:54] declare that this morning and father and
[36:57] your divine presence we ask oh god did
[36:58] you be magnified glorified let your will
[37:01] be done this morning father will be
[37:03] careful to give you all the glory honor
[37:04] and praise in Jesus Christ's name and
[37:07] the church said Amen god bless you being
[37:09] seated praise God so like to look at
[37:17] biblical numerology again this morning
[37:19] this would be part 17 by God's grace and
[37:22] we'll be looking at this year Jubilee I
[37:29] just got I got a few texts from mother
[37:31] Simon he does have Wi-Fi right now over
[37:33] there in Thailand so he just would like
[37:36] to greet all the saints and give an
[37:38] update he's just been doing Bible
[37:40] studies with couple families and he said
[37:42] they had a Bible study with a pastor I
[37:45] believe and his wife on serpent seed and
[37:48] and afterwards he showed me pictures
[37:49] they're all smiling
[37:54] it was just encouraging to hear that and
[37:57] you know Simon and brother Ron are over
[38:00] there and they realize you know it's a
[38:01] lot of ground breaking there there's
[38:03] really no real message churches there
[38:06] and so they're doing the hardest job of
[38:08] missionary work is trying to find those
[38:11] first few believers by God's grace so
[38:13] just keep praying for them there about
[38:17] the father's business you know they
[38:18] leave their family and they spend all
[38:21] kinds of money to go over there and
[38:22] let's just remember them in our prayers
[38:24] by God's grace but they would like to
[38:26] send his greetings so let's look at part
[38:29] 17 here and it's been wonderful to see
[38:32] how the Lord is blessing these messages
[38:35] so I do have Malachi do you have some
[38:37] quotes and everything to to show today
[38:40] so we want to look at 50 but we'll just
[38:43] start out on on 41 and just kind of
[38:47] brief 41 up to 49 and then we'll spend
[38:49] most of our time on 50 by the grace of
[38:52] the Lord so Lord willing we'll look at
[38:58] Jubilee you know the the main text it's
[39:01] a it's a long text if you read Leviticus
[39:03] 25 verses 25 I'm sorry verse 8 all the
[39:07] way I believed a 39 is on the year of
[39:10] Jubilee then there's a few scriptures
[39:13] scattered in chapter 27 but I think Lord
[39:16] willing we'll stay in chapter 25 you
[39:18] know yesterday I was able to listen to
[39:19] that message from 1962 or the random
[39:22] priests return in Jubilee in Louisiana
[39:24] and it was a wonderful message I'd
[39:27] encourage you to listen to it if you
[39:28] have a chance I think you'd be really
[39:29] blessed but I think I'll take most of my
[39:33] thoughts as I was listening I was just
[39:34] trying to write down the thoughts that
[39:36] we're kind of dealing with my heart and
[39:38] hopefully they'll deal with heart as
[39:40] well so with number 41 I don't really
[39:43] have a meaning for that one 42 is easy
[39:47] to see 42 is the the number of judgment
[39:50] or tribulation a brother man says this
[39:53] you know in a couple of occasions but
[39:55] the the Great Tribulation is 42 months
[39:58] long and that's half of a spiritual week
[40:01] a spiritual week is seven years so so 42
[40:04] months is sick there's three and a half
[40:06] years and a half half of a spiritual
[40:10] week so you see this in Revelation 13
[40:12] verse 5 and there was given unto him
[40:14] speaking of the beast a mouth to speak
[40:17] great things and blasphemies and
[40:19] powers given unto him to continue forty
[40:21] and two months
[40:24] remember there's great blasphemies that
[40:27] the Beast does right the Bible said the
[40:30] Beast is full of blasphemous names and
[40:33] program interprets that force he said
[40:35] the Holy Spirit revealed it to him what
[40:37] that was and he said that was all the
[40:40] names that people put on churches and
[40:45] those churches are the churches that
[40:46] that that crucify the effects of the
[40:49] Holy Spirit
[40:49] for example a church would say oh were
[40:54] the Church of Christ or were the Church
[40:56] of Latter day Saints of Christ or or
[40:58] were we're a Methodist Church or or like
[41:01] a Catholic we're a universal Church we
[41:03] are the universal body of Christ as what
[41:05] the Catholic Church is saying or the
[41:07] Church of Church of God in Christ you
[41:10] know you could whatever name they put on
[41:12] in church they're all claiming to be the
[41:14] true church but when their lives live
[41:17] differently than the name on the church
[41:19] and and they've heard the word of God
[41:22] but reject it then their lives become an
[41:27] act of defiance against the true Word of
[41:29] God right so when they hear the Bible
[41:32] saying thou shalt not lie thou shalt not
[41:34] commit adultery yet they still do and
[41:37] claim to be Christians what they're
[41:40] doing is blaspheming the very name
[41:43] that's that they're claiming to serve
[41:44] right and so you know like an example
[41:47] would be like this let's say it's Super
[41:49] Bowl weekend you know and there's a
[41:50] there's a family that goes to the Church
[41:52] of Christ right we just passed the
[41:54] Superbowl weekend which hopefully you
[41:56] didn't watch but you know what what
[42:01] happens is let's say it's Friday night
[42:02] you know and let's say let's say the the
[42:04] husband of the family's got children he
[42:06] leaves his wife and children behind but
[42:08] he goes out for the basketball game on
[42:09] Friday night and he drinks there he
[42:12] cussed as he gets drunk he curses the
[42:15] ref you know he curses off you know
[42:17] they're watching they're watching the
[42:18] the sports show and they cursed the refs
[42:21] they they curse all the fans of anybody
[42:23] against him and then he flirts a little
[42:25] bit and gets the another man's wife's
[42:27] phone number you know planning to meet
[42:29] up there sometime and then Saturday you
[42:32] know drunk so he sleeps in
[42:33] they watch Netflix all day they go off
[42:37] to the mall and they they buy you know
[42:39] they buy bikinis for their upcoming
[42:42] vacation at the beach immoral clothes
[42:45] think about I mean this is common things
[42:47] I don't know about you but not many of
[42:50] my friends do this right yeah
[42:52] and then oh they'll buy video games with
[42:55] murders and violence and cussing on it
[42:57] and and that night to celebrate I've
[43:00] gone to a movie and they'll feel they're
[43:01] their souls with murders and and
[43:03] drunkenness and violence and debauchery
[43:05] and sexual morality and act like it's
[43:08] okay and because of that you know late
[43:11] night at the movie they'll sleep and
[43:13] they'll skip Church and I'll go to
[43:14] church next week but they said that last
[43:17] week and now they're three weeks in a
[43:18] row skipping Church you know it's awful
[43:21] and then they'll spend the rest of the
[43:23] day they'll devote that to the Super
[43:24] Bowl party right now Church how about
[43:27] you but that's the act of blasphemy
[43:28] against Christ claiming to be a good
[43:32] church of christ or latter-day saint or
[43:34] something like that some Methodists or
[43:36] Baptists or I'm a Baptist and I'm
[43:38] baptized into Jesus name and yet live
[43:40] like that that's a blasphemy against the
[43:43] very name someone's called to believe in
[43:45] so we don't blacks in that name we're
[43:48] supposed to be the ones that honor that
[43:50] name but the Beast the spirit of room
[43:53] which brother has enrolled is the spirit
[43:56] of the Beast the spirit of Rome is full
[43:59] of those names right it's full of all
[44:02] kinds of names like that and that's how
[44:05] they live and and accept them onto them
[44:07] and that's why you know that that's why
[44:11] that perk up is getting full and when if
[44:13] but it gets full God is going to pour
[44:16] our wrath for 42 months right because
[44:20] number 42 is the number of judgment or
[44:23] tribulation we see it in revelation 11
[44:27] as well the Bible said that the Gentiles
[44:31] will control the court now not the holy
[44:34] place or the holy place but the the
[44:38] court of Gentiles it's given to the
[44:40] Gentiles and the Holy City shall they
[44:42] tread under foot forty and two months
[44:45] and so
[44:47] two is the number of tribulation you
[44:50] know the scripture as well and from
[44:53] second Kings chapter two and when he
[44:54] went up from thence on the Bethel and as
[44:56] he was going up by the way there came
[44:58] four little children out of the city and
[44:59] mocked him now this is especially hard
[45:01] Scripture for children to hear and
[45:04] adults too but they these children
[45:07] mocked elisha and sending him go up that
[45:10] bald head go up now bonehead and he
[45:12] turned back to looked on them and cursed
[45:14] him in the name of the Lord and there
[45:15] came forward to she bears out the wood
[45:17] and tear forty and two children of them
[45:20] so 42 is the number of judgment or
[45:23] tribulation uh now what I want to kind
[45:27] of show here is that that that mockery
[45:30] you know they they mocked Elijah the
[45:31] children mocked him but I want to show
[45:33] you too that mockeries just to form a
[45:35] blasphemy so anyone that mocks somebody
[45:39] else look at him he's a Holy Roller look
[45:42] look at the church he goes to oh he's
[45:44] just you know look at her look at her
[45:46] long hair like that spirit brother Ram
[45:48] said well brother man said he heard a
[45:51] preacher say that he said that preachers
[45:53] possessed of the devil what a Devil's
[45:55] preacher says all those women they
[45:58] should cut their hair oh it's just a big
[46:00] spare Darrell so old fashioned and all
[46:02] that hair spare tire well the man said
[46:04] that man is possessed of the devil
[46:06] because the Bible said a woman supposed
[46:08] to have long hair and it's her glory to
[46:10] God amen because if they're long uncut
[46:14] hair is a symbol of her undivided
[46:17] devotion to God he meant her uncut
[46:20] devotion her for so full hair is some
[46:24] bountiful devotion to God Almighty and
[46:27] she's under that sea she's a she is
[46:29] under that that authority right that
[46:32] devotion to God Almighty see the Bible
[46:37] said they the men that held Jesus mocked
[46:39] him and smote him and when they
[46:41] blindfold them shook him on the face and
[46:43] asked him saying prophesy who is it that
[46:45] smote thee and with many other things
[46:48] blasphemously spake they against him so
[46:51] mockery anytime you mock somebody okay
[46:53] come on show me the prove yeah yeah
[46:55] you're either Elijah you're the
[46:57] messenger or you believe the end
[46:58] message come on anytime they mark that
[47:02] it's a form of blasphemy now think about
[47:06] all the people that have mocked the
[47:07] message that you know and think about
[47:09] other churches they go to names of
[47:12] blasphemy best Phineas names amen
[47:16] good to speak evil against someone that
[47:19] would just preach the word someone that
[47:21] would just beg people to to repent and
[47:23] live right and dress holy and live
[47:25] honestly and anybody that would mock
[47:28] that would be full of demons because
[47:30] they're blaspheming the holy name of
[47:32] Christ amen
[47:32] oh that's hard but that's true something
[47:36] but the truth now let's get back to this
[47:41] Elijah because as you probably know when
[47:44] a vice has said that that wasn't the
[47:45] Holy Spirit that cursed those should her
[47:47] that was the spirit of Elijah that was a
[47:51] human and cursing those children now
[47:54] that's the reason on the platform watch
[47:56] how close and careful we watch it be
[47:58] sure before you pray or try to cast away
[48:00] an evil spirit and that thing that
[48:02] person's life isn't clean and clear if
[48:06] it's just something that you're not sure
[48:08] of I bypass it because did you know
[48:10] through a divine gift that you could Mar
[48:12] your own soul
[48:14] do you know Moses was the prophet of God
[48:16] that God told him to go out and speak to
[48:18] the rock and instead of speaking to the
[48:19] rock Moses went out contrary to God's
[48:21] will contrary to God's Word and done
[48:24] exactly what God told him not to do but
[48:27] was successful anyhow he smoked the rock
[48:30] the second time is that right he was a
[48:32] prophet he had power to do what he
[48:34] wanted to do as long as N and he smoked
[48:37] the rock and the rock brought forth the
[48:40] waters so C is it's quite a quite a deep
[48:44] topic God will give a man or woman a
[48:47] gift and that gift will operate many
[48:49] times just because it's a powerful gift
[48:52] and they're able to operate that gift
[48:55] somehow somehow operate that gift
[48:59] successfully and it operates contrary to
[49:02] what God wants that wants to be done now
[49:05] two meters that's a great great deep
[49:08] teaching and I'm not saying I got it all
[49:11] figured out
[49:12] but God is so merciful many times they
[49:15] let gifts operate to let preachers or
[49:18] women or whatever gift it is I want to
[49:20] say women like a gift of prophecy or
[49:22] maybe a gift of healing or someone
[49:23] because you know there's women abandon
[49:24] us out there televangelist people get
[49:26] healing their services all the time we
[49:29] have to cut their hair wear pants expose
[49:31] their body parts wear tight shirts show
[49:33] cleavage wear makeup paint their face
[49:36] like Jezebel all these things but yet
[49:38] their gift is successful anyhow why
[49:42] because the rain falls on the just and
[49:44] the unjust so in the myths of so in the
[49:49] midst of this somehow the you know Moses
[49:52] was sincere enough where the anointing
[49:54] was able to be there and he smoked the
[49:56] rock instead of speaking to it and it
[49:58] still brought forth water because the
[50:01] anointing was there he was sincere and
[50:03] so see Church we got to be more than
[50:05] sincere because we know we can be
[50:07] sincere yet sincerely wrong so we need
[50:12] to be very careful how we operating
[50:14] gifts especially preachers that's why a
[50:15] lot of people you know leave the message
[50:17] or the message churches because a
[50:19] preacher will get the wrong spirit on
[50:21] them and you know do something wrong and
[50:23] won't repent and won't make it right
[50:26] and so there's wrongs on both sides many
[50:28] times but any of us who are caught and
[50:32] wrongs just need to say wrong and say
[50:34] God forgive me and then if you're a
[50:36] Christian you will forgive them because
[50:39] you know not only do they make mistakes
[50:41] but you make mistakes too right that
[50:46] sort of thing that can keep a church
[50:47] together is mercy right preach that
[50:49] message of grace brother said without
[50:51] grace no family would ever stay together
[50:53] so it shows the only way firmly consider
[50:56] together is by the grace of God does
[50:59] everybody make mistakes
[51:03] Rahab city lies to that young they look
[51:05] young prophet he didn't do this as an
[51:08] old prophet where he's got more wisdom
[51:10] young prophet how many would you say
[51:13] Lord forgive me when I made those
[51:14] mistakes when I was younger I had so
[51:18] much deal not enough wisdom that young
[51:22] prophet the one we're speaking of now is
[51:23] wrote down some little children run
[51:25] after him
[51:26] he went bald-headed when he was little
[51:27] young fella and they began to tease him
[51:29] about being bald headed that prophet
[51:30] turned around his hangar and put a curse
[51:32] on those children and before they got
[51:35] back home to she-bears killed 42 little
[51:37] children
[51:37] that ain't the holy spirit but it was an
[51:41] angered prophet you have to be careful
[51:45] not judge and that's like it said in
[51:48] that said a man of God now let God
[51:51] honored Elijah because he said he said
[51:54] I'm gonna follow him until I get his
[51:57] anointing right and he did he never left
[52:00] him he got the anointing he smoked the
[52:02] Jordan in the Jordan separated right and
[52:05] now that happened he did 16 miracles
[52:07] remember that Elijah today miracles and
[52:11] the double portion was on Elijah so he
[52:14] did 16 miracles and that's proven by the
[52:17] Bible you can prove that by the Bible
[52:19] but yet there's some things there's
[52:21] times that he get in the flesh at a time
[52:25] like this
[52:26] and he stilled that anointing he'd sell
[52:28] that Authority and he was able to speak
[52:31] such things and it happened Church
[52:33] now that's striking it's striking that
[52:37] that could happen and able to put a
[52:39] curse but it wasn't the Holy Spirit
[52:42] there's an angry spirit 9 turns out what
[52:48] about you but that shakes me and God
[52:50] help me to be careful when I say hoping
[52:55] to be careful when I pray for people
[52:57] right he said he nice this is a
[53:03] different message he said I want to talk
[53:07] to you because this is not a line into
[53:08] Surma this is a line of Prayer now the
[53:09] reason I comb through the people so
[53:11] closely with that discernment anyone
[53:13] knows then that knows the scripture
[53:15] sometimes sickness is permitted by God
[53:17] to bring discipline to his people amen
[53:19] right sometimes people the church gets
[53:21] sick sometimes you and I might get sick
[53:22] and the reason it's done is to
[53:25] discipline us because we must have did
[53:27] something wrong remember with that
[53:28] Communion last week and we saw how many
[53:31] of many are sick and weakly among you so
[53:35] the Corinthian church must have not been
[53:36] really living close to God
[53:39] they started out really good for God but
[53:42] then little little spirits and demons
[53:46] got their lives they started mistreating
[53:48] people in the body of Christ and Paul
[53:50] said because that many have died many
[53:54] are sick many are weak because they
[53:57] don't know how to discern the Lord's
[53:59] body
[53:59] they can't humble themselves and say
[54:02] they're sorry right they just say they
[54:06] don't know how to repair it anymore they
[54:08] forgot and so God will allow people to
[54:12] be sick why can't I get better why can't
[54:14] I get better and the whole time is
[54:16] because their spiritual life is all sick
[54:19] amen
[54:19] so because they choose to stay in a
[54:23] spiritually sick place don't let them
[54:25] stay sick physically that's right and
[54:29] all God says is just examine yourself
[54:32] make sure your heart is right make sure
[54:34] it's being the body of Christ the right
[54:36] way so many think about that many of the
[54:40] church members the church kept getting
[54:42] smaller and smaller because they
[54:43] wouldn't make things right in the church
[54:47] right he said you know that well what if
[54:51] you take a gift and take off a person
[54:53] what God put on them then you're in
[54:55] trouble with God is that right now this
[54:59] is what I need to be more careful I
[55:01] forget this from time to time you know
[55:02] as a pastor I pray for people cried
[55:04] quite often you know as you might
[55:06] imagine you know I'm sure not as much as
[55:08] evangelist or something like that but I
[55:11] do pray for people quite often and God
[55:12] knows God knows God knows my heart I
[55:15] need to reminded of this because
[55:17] sometimes I just forget to ask people
[55:19] now have you confessed everything before
[55:21] I pray for you right
[55:25] sometimes I'll be honest sometimes I
[55:28] think I just go right to the prayer but
[55:31] it's such a great reminder that I need
[55:33] to make sure before I rebuke that demon
[55:35] that demon might be there because God
[55:37] wanted it there to drive them back to
[55:40] repentance but if I rebuke that and it
[55:43] has to lead because of the authority
[55:45] God's given me my office as a pastor or
[55:47] with a gift to pray for the sick then I
[55:50] get in trouble for that
[55:53] now as far as I know I don't know of any
[55:55] time I have but sometimes I look
[55:57] sometimes I'll be honest Church I look
[55:59] at my life and say well maybe that
[56:01] didn't happen one time maybe that's why
[56:02] I went through such a hard spell there
[56:04] you're the mean never understand like
[56:07] boy that was a really tough year or that
[56:09] you know this has been a really tough
[56:10] six months and I honestly exist and I
[56:14] want to keep doing that I want to be
[56:16] careful how I live my life before the
[56:18] Lord I'm gonna be constantly examining
[56:21] trying to be more spiritual they're not
[56:24] going overboard like we said it's like
[56:26] on Wednesday counting the number ants oh
[56:28] they're seven ants here it's going to be
[56:30] a complete service or something like
[56:31] that you know just going too far on
[56:33] things you know but I'm talking about
[56:35] really examining my heart and making
[56:38] sure have I use the gift that God's
[56:41] given me the right way do you believe in
[56:46] the power that God gives unto men and
[56:48] prayer can do that whether it's the will
[56:49] of God or not it'll do it anyhow right
[56:54] where's the will of God in other words
[56:56] God will let you do things in the
[56:57] permissive will of God you can do
[56:59] supernatural things in the permissive
[57:01] will of God just take Matthew 7 many
[57:04] many will say Lord have we not cast out
[57:06] devils have we not prophesied that money
[57:08] of many wonderful things in your name
[57:09] and I said depart from me you worker of
[57:12] iniquity well apparently they got to do
[57:14] some work and they did the works of God
[57:16] even though it wasn't the will of God
[57:18] and the church said right so apparently
[57:24] God lets his power be used in his
[57:27] permissive will as well as his perfect
[57:30] will
[57:30] oh let's let's make it our goal to
[57:34] always be in the perfect will of God
[57:36] and that means caring what other people
[57:39] think right
[57:41] that means caring about making sure
[57:43] we're living right before each other see
[57:47] Moses smote the rock and it wasn't God's
[57:49] will I couldn't imagine being God's will
[57:51] because Elijah was bought ahead those
[57:53] should are making fun of him out there
[57:54] he cursed 42 of them I can't think that
[57:57] to be the Holy Spirit see but just the
[57:59] Prophet anger and the power of that
[58:02] prophet the power of a gift
[58:07] now 45 I'm unsure but this is part of
[58:10] Scripture look at this and now behold
[58:12] the Lord have kept me Caleb's talkin
[58:14] God's kept me alive as he said these 45
[58:18] and five years even since the Lord spake
[58:21] this word in the Moses while the
[58:23] children of Israel Warner in the
[58:24] wilderness and lo I am now this day four
[58:26] score and five years old now verse seven
[58:30] says he was forty years old when he was
[58:32] a spy so God sends him out there and
[58:36] then he comes over more than is able to
[58:40] do it they warned her for 40 years right
[58:43] so then he's 80 when he gets in the
[58:46] Promised Land and then he fights with
[58:49] all misra for five years and now he's 85
[58:52] years old he said I'm strong this day as
[58:55] I was the day that Moses sent me as my
[58:58] strength was then even so my strength is
[59:00] now for war work both to go out and to
[59:03] come in praise God Amen hallelujah so he
[59:07] had 45 years from the time that he was
[59:09] aspired to the time he was able to
[59:11] possess the land he was just as strong
[59:14] 45 years later Oh may God help that to
[59:18] be my testimony ain't got over to me
[59:20] your testimony that wherever you are no
[59:23] matter how many years impact you can
[59:25] feel just as strong spiritually for
[59:27] Christ and if you need the physical
[59:30] strength if God gave it to Caleb how
[59:32] much more could he give it to us amen
[59:34] under the blood of Jesus Christ to be
[59:38] able to do strong enough to do his work
[59:41] that he's called us to do amen
[59:45] hallelujah now I feel like that with my
[59:48] life I feel just as strong as I did
[59:51] started preaching 15 years ago but I
[59:54] gotta be careful I get a little more
[59:56] tired faster but I can feel the same
[59:59] amount of strength that's right
[1:00:02] and if I made at least 15 years
[1:00:03] preaching I can do the next 15 by His
[1:00:06] grace we see we got to have this kind of
[1:00:09] attitude like we're more than able in
[1:00:12] other words even if everybody else won't
[1:00:14] keep all the message it won't possess
[1:00:15] the land I'm going to do it yes
[1:00:18] because that's what God said God said
[1:00:20] man Caleb and Joshua they got a
[1:00:23] different sphere than all these other
[1:00:25] people how do they so what was the
[1:00:27] difference a difference of spirit amen
[1:00:29] and we gotta have the Holy Spirit amen
[1:00:32] and if you really got the Holy Spirit
[1:00:34] and you've got a different sphere and
[1:00:36] almost everybody in the church amen
[1:00:37] right and then the world in the nation
[1:00:40] you've got a different spirit and you'll
[1:00:42] hang on until it's God start to possess
[1:00:45] the promised land you have strength to
[1:00:48] hang on that's what it was to Caleb that
[1:00:51] different sphere was strength to him and
[1:00:53] he was able to hang on for 45 more years
[1:00:56] to possess the promised land and find
[1:01:00] his position so although all the other
[1:01:02] people died they they live to see it he
[1:01:04] lived long enough and was strong enough
[1:01:06] to possess the promised land that God
[1:01:09] had for him amen what a testimony 85
[1:01:13] years old still just as strong as you
[1:01:15] ever were hallelujah thank you Lord now
[1:01:20] I'm not sure about 46 but Jesus said
[1:01:22] that you said forty and six years was
[1:01:24] this temple in building and will Lowry
[1:01:26] heard up in three days so I'm not sure
[1:01:28] what forty-six means maybe a man's
[1:01:30] building but like I said I don't know I
[1:01:32] don't have two or three witnesses I'm
[1:01:33] just showing you the scriptures that I
[1:01:34] found 48 not sure but the Bible said the
[1:01:38] Levites all the cities which he give to
[1:01:40] Levites shall be 48 cities I'm not sure
[1:01:42] why 48 there but that's what I found
[1:01:47] says it again in Joshua 21 actually it
[1:01:50] shows the first one was God's command
[1:01:53] and now here in Joshua we see the
[1:01:54] fulfillment all the cities the Levites
[1:01:56] within the possession of the children of
[1:01:57] Israel were 48 cities with their suburbs
[1:02:00] praise God
[1:02:01] now 49 of course from our text here now
[1:02:06] shout number seven sabbaths of the years
[1:02:07] under the seven times seven years and
[1:02:11] the space of the seven Sabbath's of year
[1:02:13] shall be unto the forty and nine years
[1:02:16] so 49 represents seven Sabbath's or
[1:02:19] seven rests they're complete rests and
[1:02:22] now fifty as we sang earlier it's a year
[1:02:26] jubilee amen
[1:02:27] Jubilee is or Pentecost is the number
[1:02:30] fifty so you won't look at this here
[1:02:32] this morning by God's grace now I just
[1:02:35] had a little thought I want to just
[1:02:36] start off I preached this a few years
[1:02:38] ago I'm gonna switch over here to this
[1:02:39] one let's just bring this out I was
[1:02:42] studying yesterday remember Pentecost
[1:02:46] what it was was was was the was what God
[1:02:49] did to undo bable bable is what man did
[1:02:55] to try to unite men right
[1:02:58] but Pentecost or Jubilee is what God did
[1:03:03] to unite man amen hallelujah praise the
[1:03:08] Lord now look what Boehm says he said hi
[1:03:12] I'll admit that there was one time in
[1:03:14] the Bible that everybody spoke in
[1:03:15] tongues and he was debating and he said
[1:03:17] but he's very upset hallelujah now
[1:03:19] you're on the road I said yes sir that
[1:03:21] was that babble no one understood what
[1:03:24] the other one said I said on Pentecost
[1:03:27] they all understood what every man said
[1:03:30] I said it was the pouring out of the
[1:03:33] Holy Spirit you see at that will they
[1:03:35] all spoken unknown tongues like
[1:03:37] Pentecost does now no one know what the
[1:03:39] other ones saying one jabbering this one
[1:03:41] jabber net and you know nothing but that
[1:03:43] was Babel but I said a Pentecost every
[1:03:45] man heard in his own language wherein he
[1:03:48] was born praise God
[1:03:50] so the day of Pentecost when they spoke
[1:03:52] in tongues they might not have known
[1:03:53] really what they were saying
[1:03:55] or maybe themselves but at whatever they
[1:03:57] said was understood now there's
[1:04:01] different ways to look at it program
[1:04:03] have said and perhaps they were speaking
[1:04:04] Galilean so the Galileans like Peter and
[1:04:06] Andrew and James and John they were all
[1:04:08] speaking Galilee and praise the Lord
[1:04:10] Jesus the Messiah and while they're
[1:04:12] speaking that people from the 17
[1:04:14] different tongues and Nations heard that
[1:04:17] heard them speaking in their language so
[1:04:19] they spoke the disciples spoke Galilean
[1:04:22] but let's say the Mesopotamians heard it
[1:04:24] in the Mesopotamian language and so
[1:04:27] everybody understood what was being said
[1:04:29] and Paul said I'd rather speak five
[1:04:32] words in a message service than 10,000
[1:04:35] in an unknown tongue amen
[1:04:37] right and so that was how the Holy
[1:04:41] Spirit was poured out so
[1:04:44] Babel was man making a way to heaven for
[1:04:48] all men right
[1:04:50] but Pentecost was God making a way to
[1:04:54] heaven for all men out-of-area
[1:04:57] I remember a battle tongues were a sign
[1:05:02] of judgment upon all nations but at
[1:05:05] Pentecost tongues were a sign of grace
[1:05:08] upon all nations
[1:05:10] thank the Lord amen now a member of the
[1:05:13] Catholic Church is called Mystery
[1:05:16] Babylon because she rides the spirit of
[1:05:20] Rome right so what is K the Catholic
[1:05:23] Church
[1:05:23] she's a man-made way to heaven like I
[1:05:28] went to that funeral of my coach who was
[1:05:30] a devout Catholic and the priest gets up
[1:05:34] there and he says well no doubt you know
[1:05:35] my friend mr. kosher he'll just have a
[1:05:37] very short time in purgatory before he
[1:05:39] gets to heaven I thought ma did you hear
[1:05:41] that honey I think we both looked at
[1:05:43] each other you know because he never
[1:05:44] married I never did anybody any wrong as
[1:05:47] far as they could find him he's very
[1:05:48] faithful he never missed mass he was a
[1:05:50] very faithful Catholic um but you know
[1:05:54] they don't even believe you let you go
[1:05:57] like to have like they don't even
[1:05:59] believe all their prayers and all their
[1:06:01] penances and all their Hail Marys are
[1:06:03] enough to get them to heaven they've got
[1:06:06] to go to a special place to get ready
[1:06:08] for heaven in that shocking sea it's a
[1:06:13] man way it's a man way well I because
[1:06:16] they're known of the Holy Ghost well we
[1:06:18] live so filthy here you know we got to
[1:06:19] keep doing all of our penances I guess
[1:06:21] we should probably go get clean before
[1:06:22] oh thank God for the cleansing power of
[1:06:25] the blood of Christ right now amen amen
[1:06:30] that right now you can get wash right
[1:06:33] now you can actually be clean and ready
[1:06:36] for those party white gates amen you
[1:06:40] don't have to go anywhere else to be
[1:06:41] ready or a special place or a special
[1:06:44] holding tank or anything like that
[1:06:46] you've got the bleaching power of the
[1:06:48] blood of Christ to wash your garments
[1:06:50] right right now
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:52] amen but this is a man way to heaven is
[1:06:58] Mystery Babylon and member she rides the
[1:07:01] beast or she arrived or upon the power
[1:07:04] of the influence of the Spirit of Rome
[1:07:07] and all of the spirit of Rome is as
[1:07:09] those same demons that were on Alexander
[1:07:11] the Great and the church said and all
[1:07:14] that was all those demons were the same
[1:07:16] demons that were on another means and
[1:07:18] portions right and all those demons one
[1:07:22] of these approaches was those same
[1:07:24] demons that was on Nebuchadnezzar how
[1:07:26] you have a church that beast spirit that
[1:07:29] demonic power of ruling one divide and
[1:07:32] conquer what do you have influence for
[1:07:34] every person that's the spirit of Satan
[1:07:36] but we've got the Spirit of Christ amen
[1:07:40] that's all it is those seem the same
[1:07:43] demons just now operate differently
[1:07:45] right and now it's finally starting to
[1:07:49] come out as I've shown you with those
[1:07:51] articles not only are priests pedophiles
[1:07:54] but nuns are pedophiles it's been coming
[1:07:57] all out over CBS News I can share the
[1:07:58] links with you the nuns are now being
[1:08:03] all these women are coming for saying
[1:08:05] the nuns abused me and taught me all
[1:08:08] these evil things and had ruined my life
[1:08:10] and took all my innocency and and it's a
[1:08:14] like the Bible said it's a cage of
[1:08:16] unclean and hateful bird right and it's
[1:08:21] all it's all documented it's all out
[1:08:23] there and how come the the evangelicals
[1:08:27] how come all these people haven't
[1:08:29] overthrown that church because they're
[1:08:31] all connected politically and
[1:08:33] financially is that right they are all
[1:08:37] got some connection somehow politically
[1:08:40] well we if we if we go against it then
[1:08:43] the Democrats are gonna win next year
[1:08:45] who cares that the Democrats or
[1:08:47] Republicans with price is gonna win amen
[1:08:51] see me sympathy they won't speak against
[1:08:54] sin because of their political influence
[1:08:58] or their financial influence well I know
[1:09:01] the Catholics how all these guys that
[1:09:03] control the big banks and all these
[1:09:05] things like that
[1:09:05] and if we throw them they'll get mad and
[1:09:07] who knows what's gonna happen to my bank
[1:09:08] accounts
[1:09:09] oh it's that's compromise amen yes
[1:09:15] so it's man's way to heaven Babel was
[1:09:22] confusions of tongues spread to every
[1:09:25] nation but Pentecost was the
[1:09:28] understanding of tongues spread the
[1:09:30] gospel to every nation sister Wendy let
[1:09:33] me borrow her her zoos history book from
[1:09:36] 1906 how's reading a few pages that I
[1:09:38] haven't even touched it hardly but the
[1:09:40] part I did look in the very first
[1:09:42] testimonies right after California after
[1:09:45] the Holy Ghost fell down his ooze the
[1:09:47] street they took that overseas I don't
[1:09:49] member if it was Africa I don't remember
[1:09:51] if it was the East I'm not sure anyways
[1:09:54] the very first testimonies was after
[1:09:57] they received the Holy Ghost there they
[1:09:58] went into a place and they had no
[1:10:00] interpreter so they just started
[1:10:03] preaching and singing and praising God
[1:10:06] and everything they said in English the
[1:10:08] foreigners heard in their own language
[1:10:11] and that's how it spread in night after
[1:10:15] 1906 come on yeah so see that's the
[1:10:21] power of Pentecost God wants to do that
[1:10:24] he wants to spread the good news through
[1:10:27] tongues to every nation Babel is the
[1:10:31] Nimrod Nimrod was a leader and this is
[1:10:36] the spirit of Satan right so the leader
[1:10:37] is motivated by the spirit of singing
[1:10:39] but the leader of Pentecost is Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ who has the Spirit of God that's
[1:10:45] right last one here I'll believe it's
[1:10:47] the last one no two more Babel was
[1:10:50] rebellion and blasphemy right it's a
[1:10:55] glorified man but Pentecost was
[1:10:58] obedience and worship to glorify God
[1:11:03] glory remember they said we're gonna
[1:11:05] make a name for ourselves remember they
[1:11:07] said that we're gonna be the big shots
[1:11:08] let's make a name for ourselves you know
[1:11:10] I heard a drama one time I liked it the
[1:11:13] children and I listen to the Bible
[1:11:14] dramas but one of them said you know
[1:11:16] they say went to the City Council and
[1:11:18] said you know last
[1:11:19] supposedly you know you know God sent
[1:11:21] this flood and and our cities our
[1:11:24] buildings weren't tall enough and so we
[1:11:27] got to build a tower that'll be so tired
[1:11:29] or gonna reach to heaven and so that if
[1:11:32] I God sends another friend then we can
[1:11:35] still get to heaven how foolish that
[1:11:39] that now maybe if that was let's say
[1:11:42] that was what they were thinking well
[1:11:44] that's a case then they never understood
[1:11:45] what the rainbow was all about right but
[1:11:48] God gave a promise I'll never fight it
[1:11:50] again and so they were trying to glorify
[1:11:54] man to see what man can do and God said
[1:11:57] they would accomplish great things right
[1:11:59] so they had to come down and confound
[1:12:01] their languages and I just heard brother
[1:12:05] Branham say it this week he said think
[1:12:07] of a mind he said that can go pick he
[1:12:09] said think about it you can go pick a
[1:12:11] blade of grass out in the yard and just
[1:12:13] there'd that black grass think about the
[1:12:15] life and the intelligence that blade of
[1:12:17] grass and they said compare that to the
[1:12:20] mind that just sent a rocket to the moon
[1:12:22] and that rocket is seems so great
[1:12:26] going to the moon seems so great which I
[1:12:28] don't even know if they did anymore who
[1:12:29] knows there's all these conspiracy
[1:12:31] theories who knows but he said compare
[1:12:36] those two minds and that great man that
[1:12:39] can shoot the rocket ship up there the
[1:12:41] great mind that can make a cell phone
[1:12:42] and and let you talk and livestream
[1:12:44] around the world the great man that can
[1:12:46] do that can't even make a blade of grass
[1:12:50] see man glorifies himself and seems like
[1:12:54] he can do such great things but in all
[1:12:56] reality God says that's nonsense
[1:12:59] what God calls great man says
[1:13:01] foolishness right what God calls foolish
[1:13:04] man says great it's the opposite I like
[1:13:09] this one right here Babel said let's get
[1:13:11] bricks and mortar and slide and God said
[1:13:13] give me some lively stones some
[1:13:15] revelations for believers I know they're
[1:13:20] going to build their where they were
[1:13:21] stones but God's gonna build his way
[1:13:23] with Christians out of ivory stones that
[1:13:26] are part of the foundation of the church
[1:13:28] of god and then stones represent
[1:13:31] revelation to
[1:13:33] upon this rock of Revelation I'll build
[1:13:35] my church and the gates of Hell shall
[1:13:37] not prevail against it
[1:13:39] Babel was false unity centralized but
[1:13:42] God's Pentecost is true unity sent forth
[1:13:45] hallelujah
[1:13:48] Babel was tongues of confusion and
[1:13:50] division Pentecost is tongues of
[1:13:53] understanding and unity and I hear this
[1:13:56] yeah Babel is then making a name for man
[1:13:58] but Pentecost is them declaring the name
[1:14:01] of Jesus Christ and I think that's it
[1:14:03] yeah I just had that thought I thought
[1:14:06] you know I'd like to preach that to kind
[1:14:08] of give a start to to Jubilee and
[1:14:11] Pentecost you like that it's been about
[1:14:13] three years since I've preached that so
[1:14:15] I hope that was okay now notice here the
[1:14:18] Bible said the Jubilee came on the day
[1:14:21] of atonement I love this when I heard a
[1:14:22] preacher preach this the day of
[1:14:24] atonement was on the tenth day of the
[1:14:26] seventh month as the Old Testament type
[1:14:29] and that is fulfilled in revelation 10 7
[1:14:33] because the days because as it was in
[1:14:36] days that I'm sorry the days of 7 J
[1:14:38] angel and he should begin to sound the
[1:14:39] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:14:42] hath declared to his servants the
[1:14:43] prophets in other words you and I can
[1:14:46] understand the real gospel of Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ because God sent His Prophet
[1:14:50] to finish the mysteries of God amen and
[1:14:53] now the gospel is no longer a mystery
[1:14:56] right like I was talking to my friend
[1:15:00] who's still denomination on Thursday and
[1:15:02] he's still kind of complex you know how
[1:15:04] I like David could be a man after God's
[1:15:08] own heart but then go commit adultery
[1:15:10] and kill a man Uriah and I tried to tell
[1:15:13] him I said I said sir
[1:15:15] I said that's the power of the New
[1:15:17] Testament baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:19] because once a man gets born again now
[1:15:21] he gets born again his soul and now he's
[1:15:25] the Christ is sealed into him that
[1:15:27] anointing would leave David but once you
[1:15:29] get the seal the Holy Ghost that
[1:15:31] anointing in your soul doesn't leave you
[1:15:33] you might forget about it and get all
[1:15:36] worked up and worried in your mind and
[1:15:38] frustrated and all kind of a discourage
[1:15:41] and then
[1:15:42] and defeat in your mind but if you stop
[1:15:45] and take a minute of Prayer and say God
[1:15:47] show me your goal later forgive me
[1:15:50] return to you if you stop for a moment
[1:15:52] pretty soon that soul will speak God's
[1:15:55] Word it will speak something if they let
[1:15:57] you know that God's presence is with you
[1:16:00] because it's God's nature the Holy
[1:16:02] Spirit is the souls of nature man so if
[1:16:04] the Holy Spirit has a mark in there then
[1:16:06] that mark inside of there is going to
[1:16:08] speak to you praise God it's so this is
[1:16:10] a nature when you get your mind off what
[1:16:13] the law says and get our minds on the
[1:16:15] nature of God it gives a witness because
[1:16:17] his Spirit bears witness with our spirit
[1:16:19] that we are the children of God so the
[1:16:25] day of atonement was when the high
[1:16:27] priest would make atonement for his
[1:16:29] family first all the way in the holiest
[1:16:31] of Holies and then he take another go
[1:16:33] and take that blood and go all the way
[1:16:35] in for the people and then everybody can
[1:16:37] leave Church and say all of ours from
[1:16:40] 2019 is under the blood
[1:16:43] and that's such a beautiful type of what
[1:16:46] brother is method but his message took
[1:16:49] up all the misunderstandings about you
[1:16:52] know managing the about
[1:16:53] forgiveness and water baptism and the
[1:16:55] baptism of Holy Ghost it took all these
[1:16:57] mysteries off and who is no kaznyk and
[1:16:59] all these things and now we can see what
[1:17:02] God truly says and God says that he's
[1:17:05] forgiven you from every transgression
[1:17:07] and when you're born again the Bible
[1:17:09] said it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:17:11] glory that generations have longed to
[1:17:14] see that's what revelation 10 7 did it
[1:17:19] took all the seals off the book it took
[1:17:21] off the mystery of the book and now I
[1:17:23] know what God really thinks about me
[1:17:25] amen hallelujah
[1:17:29] and now what I'm atoned with God I have
[1:17:34] an atonement which means peace we've
[1:17:35] been made at peace I've reconciled where
[1:17:39] there's there's nothing between my Lord
[1:17:40] and I right there's nothing between me
[1:17:42] and my Savior amen
[1:17:44] or my savior life that's the right
[1:17:46] grammar Barney so 10 7 so the Pentecost
[1:17:51] the trumpet was blown on the same day
[1:17:54] the
[1:17:55] I'm forgiving all your sins oh what a
[1:17:58] beautiful type there the day of
[1:18:01] Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and it was
[1:18:03] sounding the trumpet all your sins are
[1:18:05] forgiven and now that now I'm gonna live
[1:18:08] in you I'm gonna talk in you I'm gonna
[1:18:10] walk in you and you will be my children
[1:18:13] take your Bible to second Corinthians 6
[1:18:15] that just struck me they're fresh I'll
[1:18:20] be the second Corinthians chapter 6 this
[1:18:26] is the whole plan of God oh I'm in first
[1:18:38] Corinthians sorry yes sir okay verse 14
[1:18:46] I'll share this with a guy from Texas
[1:18:47] who called me last night I preached in
[1:18:50] for about 20 minutes he was receiving it
[1:18:53] too so hopefully I'll get his life lined
[1:18:54] up he was in a fornication and all these
[1:18:57] things and I was kind of he wanted to
[1:18:59] hear so I was preaching it now I don't
[1:19:00] preach it everybody like that but he one
[1:19:01] to hear it so that was good the children
[1:19:03] heard me preaching to him too so I
[1:19:05] preached last night now I'm preaching
[1:19:06] this morning secondly at 6:14 be not
[1:19:08] unequally yoked together with
[1:19:09] unbelievers for what fellowship hath
[1:19:11] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:19:13] what communion hath light with darkness
[1:19:15] and what Concord hath Christ with Belial
[1:19:18] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:19:21] an infidel and what agreement hath the
[1:19:24] temple of God with idols for ye are the
[1:19:26] temple the Living God as God has said
[1:19:28] now here's where here's what God wants
[1:19:30] to do church went through the message
[1:19:31] right the baptism oils this is what God
[1:19:34] wants to do I will dwell in them how
[1:19:37] many want to be God's temple this is the
[1:19:40] whole purpose of the New Testament so
[1:19:41] God can dwell in you all the time and if
[1:19:46] he's in you all the time then that means
[1:19:47] churches every day praise God
[1:19:52] some of you say well I have a hard time
[1:19:54] coming on Wednesday night or I have a
[1:19:55] hard time come on Sunday night well me I
[1:19:57] go to church every day all day each day
[1:19:59] because God's at me God's in his temple
[1:20:02] God's in church all the time are you
[1:20:04] with me
[1:20:07] he said I will drill in them and how
[1:20:09] many want God to walk in them see that's
[1:20:13] it right there
[1:20:13] I'm sorry that word out right there
[1:20:15] right there is the feet shod with the
[1:20:18] preparation of the gospel of peace right
[1:20:20] there's the full armor of God because I
[1:20:24] preach that a few weeks ago remember
[1:20:25] that when your feet are shod with the
[1:20:27] preparation of the gospel of peace that
[1:20:29] means you prayed through and you have
[1:20:31] peace in every step that you walk that
[1:20:36] means you've chosen the path of
[1:20:39] righteousness that means you've chosen
[1:20:41] to walk spiritually and naturally right
[1:20:44] in the perfect will of God not the
[1:20:47] permissive will of God but you're
[1:20:48] walking the wind of God and if we're
[1:20:50] working the will of God then you're
[1:20:51] willing to walk in the warfare because
[1:20:54] you're a soldier you didn't leave your
[1:20:58] sword at home or your shield you didn't
[1:21:01] forget your helmet you're only going to
[1:21:04] look in the paths of peace the past that
[1:21:06] God wants you to walk in so what did God
[1:21:11] say God said oh I want to dwell in
[1:21:12] brother amen right now what the Bible
[1:21:16] said and God has said I will dwell in
[1:21:19] Jose is that right brother
[1:21:22] this would gap it's not what I say it's
[1:21:26] what God says Amen God saying I couldn't
[1:21:30] live all the way in David but I would
[1:21:33] have live in you praise God God said I
[1:21:37] would warn you I want to walk in Jesse
[1:21:40] Smith I want to walk into the school on
[1:21:43] the walk in the church in his body I
[1:21:45] want to walk in him and then he says and
[1:21:47] then next he says and I will be their
[1:21:50] God and they shall be my people
[1:21:53] glory so wherefore
[1:21:58] come out from among them and be separate
[1:22:00] say at the Lord bro man said that is the
[1:22:02] price to pay for white garments hey man
[1:22:06] the price to pay is separating from
[1:22:10] anybody that you're unequally yoked with
[1:22:12] that's the price for a white garment
[1:22:16] separation is the price that you have to
[1:22:18] pay you have to lose a lot of friends
[1:22:20] right lose a lot of soceity might lose a
[1:22:23] job right you got to lose a lot of
[1:22:27] things if you want God to walk in you
[1:22:29] but you realize the treasure you have
[1:22:31] when you have God far outweighs the
[1:22:34] little loss that you just lost right
[1:22:38] because the Bible said the trials work
[1:22:41] inside of you an eternal weight of glory
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:44] oh wait a character right a substance of
[1:22:50] faith praise God that's what God works
[1:22:52] inside of you and I glory how am i doing
[1:22:55] time okay good alright wherefore come
[1:22:58] among them be separate saith the Lord
[1:22:59] and touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:23:02] will receive you right now it used to be
[1:23:05] magazines people touch those that was
[1:23:07] the wrong thing well today it's our
[1:23:08] cellphones many times right or sir
[1:23:11] remote control we shouldn't be touching
[1:23:12] that think about think about what you
[1:23:16] touch with your hands that's the wrong
[1:23:19] thing to touch and the Bible said touch
[1:23:22] not the unclean thing he says and I'll
[1:23:27] receive you saith the Lord and will be a
[1:23:30] father unto you and you shall be my sons
[1:23:32] and daughters saith the Lord Almighty so
[1:23:35] see worldly things if we ever get
[1:23:36] attached to worldly things will feel
[1:23:38] like God is this some far-off God that
[1:23:41] doesn't really care about us and we
[1:23:42] can't feel close to him but when we walk
[1:23:44] in obedience we feel like he's daddy
[1:23:47] Abba Abba daddy father right now Abba
[1:23:53] Father and that's the spirit of the
[1:23:55] adoption right I cry Abba Father so see
[1:24:00] this is
[1:24:01] this is that what the baptism holy ghost
[1:24:03] was met this is what the message meant
[1:24:04] to do the message was brought to us so
[1:24:07] we could experience the fullness of
[1:24:09] Christ inside of us that God would live
[1:24:12] in me constantly and that God would work
[1:24:15] in me and God will be my god and I'll be
[1:24:18] his child glory amen
[1:24:22] now look at verse 10 and ye shall hallow
[1:24:25] the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty
[1:24:27] throughout all the land and all that
[1:24:29] happens there they shall be a jubilee
[1:24:30] unto you and you shall return every man
[1:24:32] unto his possession and you shall return
[1:24:34] every man at his family a jubilee shall
[1:24:37] that fiftieth year be unto you
[1:24:38] you should not so neither shop neither
[1:24:40] reap that which growth of itself in it
[1:24:42] nor gather the grapes of it I'm sorry in
[1:24:45] its of that vine undressed now the word
[1:24:48] Jubilee means a shout of joy
[1:24:52] so church even under the law they had
[1:24:55] shout spell sometimes now why can't you
[1:24:58] and I have shout spells we can pave
[1:25:01] ahead we're supposed to right see every
[1:25:05] 50 years they had permission you can
[1:25:08] shout now right Joshua gave him
[1:25:11] permission when the walls fell down he
[1:25:14] said shout now see now the same thing is
[1:25:17] true for us but it's not me telling you
[1:25:19] to show it's the Holy Ghost telling you
[1:25:21] to shout and if the shout smell the
[1:25:27] worshipping spell the glory smell the
[1:25:30] giving God praise that's the Jubilee
[1:25:32] spirit of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:25:36] see with the religious impulse not a man
[1:25:39] telling you okay brilliant
[1:25:40] now you can shout now the songs over go
[1:25:43] ahead and shop now sister Brenda now you
[1:25:46] can shout okay go ahead go ahead
[1:25:48] we're waiting for you shop it's not a
[1:25:51] man telling you in the shout the holy
[1:25:53] spirit starts rising up and it's like a
[1:25:55] it's like an artesian well you just feel
[1:25:59] it embrace soon you just gotta let it
[1:26:01] know yeah
[1:26:04] oh praise God I just got a little
[1:26:07] because it's not me doing it it's bear
[1:26:10] doing it
[1:26:12] hallelujah
[1:26:14] and don't forget that's a fruit of the
[1:26:17] Holy Spirit so if you say you're born
[1:26:20] again every now and then you ought to
[1:26:22] have a joy shout that's right
[1:26:25] joy is one of the fruits of the Holy
[1:26:28] Spirit now thank you
[1:26:36] thank you Jesus praise God it's been
[1:26:40] proved scientifically that the more
[1:26:42] people praying shout and praise the Lord
[1:26:44] I got a little book on it the more
[1:26:45] people pray and shout the less stress
[1:26:47] they have in their lives and the healthy
[1:26:48] they are and the longer they live
[1:26:50] no wonder Adam lived 930 years no wonder
[1:26:54] he must have been glory shouts all the
[1:26:56] time it's probably due to oxygen or
[1:26:59] something like that
[1:27:00] okay you understand what I'm sayin right
[1:27:02] you when you come to God he lives in you
[1:27:06] you cast all your cares you get out all
[1:27:08] the mud Lori you get all the trash out
[1:27:13] and your body's healthier your mind
[1:27:16] stronger you're more focused you're more
[1:27:19] of a conqueror praise God you're more
[1:27:21] able to be used by God amen
[1:27:28] now if somehow or the other the
[1:27:30] individual lost their inheritance was
[1:27:32] given them by God
[1:27:33] they're coming here called the Jubilee
[1:27:34] here every seven years they had a rest
[1:27:37] of Sabbath every seven days and a
[1:27:39] Sabbath every seven years had a Sabbath
[1:27:41] and seven Sabbath's was 49 years the
[1:27:43] fiftieth year was Jubilee and then this
[1:27:45] Jubilee every man that had lost his
[1:27:46] hands by some means if he is a freeboard
[1:27:48] or true blood it is right no matter who
[1:27:51] held the possession it had to go back to
[1:27:53] him
[1:27:53] free he didn't have to pay a thing he'd
[1:27:56] have to do a thing but just stop what he
[1:27:58] was doing and go back to his inheritance
[1:28:01] and that beautiful if you wanted to be
[1:28:04] born again if we want a real book of
[1:28:06] Acts church we've just got to stop what
[1:28:09] we're doing and go back to what God has
[1:28:12] called us to praise God we just got
[1:28:15] stopped living in the same old ways the
[1:28:17] same old habits the same old thoughts
[1:28:19] writer we just got to stop that and just
[1:28:22] return to what the Bible says
[1:28:26] oh I love it don't you oh my he had a
[1:28:29] right to do it it was a god-given right
[1:28:30] because he by grace had inherited and
[1:28:32] there was been given to his father's and
[1:28:34] handed down year after year no matter
[1:28:36] what had taken place if he lost it they
[1:28:38] must go free and that grace is way
[1:28:41] provided for each individual to return
[1:28:43] to their rightful inheritance what a
[1:28:46] picture gives us tonight of the church
[1:28:48] in these last days you see what man can
[1:28:50] do and then you see what God does what
[1:28:52] man does is failing and will fail has
[1:28:55] failed and will always fail but what God
[1:28:57] does is eternal and must forever remain
[1:28:59] nothing can ever take it away God give
[1:29:02] it it's his free gift and my sovereign
[1:29:05] foresight saw it placed it in there and
[1:29:07] there's nothing can ever move it it's
[1:29:09] very turn Lee and that Jubilee was God's
[1:29:12] manner of expressing grace to his people
[1:29:14] for restoring or be brought back to
[1:29:17] their rightful position oh so what did
[1:29:21] you believe it's God's grace
[1:29:22] it's his free gift come back you're
[1:29:26] entitled to freedom you're entitled to
[1:29:29] everything that you lost your entire
[1:29:31] driver back and there's only one thing
[1:29:34] you're gonna do walk away from your past
[1:29:36] life oh thank god amen
[1:29:41] see but people are so caught up in bad
[1:29:44] habits right and Mela Ram says and I
[1:29:47] quote habits are spirits a bad habit is
[1:29:51] a bad bunch of demons is that right it's
[1:29:56] exactly right now I want to bring this
[1:29:58] up here because it struck me as I read
[1:30:01] this I thought my see if your brother is
[1:30:04] poor and he's sold some of his
[1:30:06] possession let's say he's poor so he
[1:30:09] sells let's say a half of acre okay I'll
[1:30:11] just use that he sells a half acre and
[1:30:12] if any of his kin come to redeem it then
[1:30:15] char you deem that which his brother
[1:30:16] sold let's say the man says I'm gonna
[1:30:18] bind I can't pay my tithes and offerings
[1:30:21] Yeah right I can't pay my I I can't pay
[1:30:25] my food bill this month my grocery bill
[1:30:27] I'm gonna sell it half an acre
[1:30:29] he gets that money said okay all right
[1:30:32] here's the groceries all right now I can
[1:30:33] feed itll kitties praise the Lord but
[1:30:35] after I starts missing that land our
[1:30:39] four
[1:30:39] others died for that God brought Israel
[1:30:43] two million people out so I could have
[1:30:45] that that belongs to me my dad used to
[1:30:48] farm that land my mom gave birth on that
[1:30:50] land or whatever you know whatever no
[1:30:53] the the connection at land is the Bible
[1:30:56] said if the man have none to redeem it
[1:30:58] and himself be able to redeem it so that
[1:31:01] man might eventually get some some funds
[1:31:03] he might have a season of gaining you
[1:31:05] know we have a season to lose and a
[1:31:07] season to get you might have a little
[1:31:10] season where he's pretty smart
[1:31:11] business-wise he pulled a good deal
[1:31:13] there or maybe there was a little extra
[1:31:16] corner he owns the other land he's able
[1:31:18] to sell that and he can go back and say
[1:31:22] listen it's not a choice it's not your
[1:31:26] choice I sold this to you but it's not
[1:31:28] your choice you have to let me have this
[1:31:31] back because I'm redeeming it back it
[1:31:35] used to be mine but because it's yours
[1:31:38] now but even though it's yours but it
[1:31:41] was yours it was my father's and before
[1:31:44] here's my father's the father before him
[1:31:46] the God said before was anybody it was
[1:31:48] God's and God determined that my family
[1:31:53] was let's say I'm the Judah God
[1:31:55] determined Judah had this land and so
[1:31:58] that guy who bought it he couldn't argue
[1:31:59] and say no I'm not that's mine fair and
[1:32:02] square
[1:32:03] I've got the deed he couldn't say that
[1:32:06] but the man coming back said listen I
[1:32:08] came into a better time I'm gonna buy
[1:32:11] this back I don't have to wait you know
[1:32:13] 49 more years for the Jubilee I can have
[1:32:16] it now now see a man could redeem his
[1:32:21] own land before the Jubilee and church
[1:32:24] this reminded me because you and I
[1:32:27] cannot redeem our own selves right but
[1:32:30] as far as salvation Jesus Christ
[1:32:32] redeemed us so what type is in here this
[1:32:36] is the type how can I redeem what I've
[1:32:39] lost this is though this is the only
[1:32:41] type that if it's as I can see in
[1:32:43] Scripture the only Redemption that you
[1:32:46] have the power to redeem you and I is
[1:32:49] redeeming the time right
[1:32:53] you can't save yourself can you are you
[1:32:55] are you your own Savior are you did you
[1:32:57] save yourself the brother Bram save you
[1:32:59] no of course not
[1:33:02] you can't redeem yourself there's only
[1:33:04] one thing you can redeem and that's the
[1:33:08] time your free time and only the wise
[1:33:13] virgin will do it let me be very
[1:33:17] straight on that foolish virgin will
[1:33:20] waste their time on worldly things right
[1:33:27] but the lines margin will redeem the
[1:33:30] time and they will do what God wants and
[1:33:33] not what their flesh was in the Old
[1:33:39] Testament yes you could redeem your own
[1:33:41] land back in the New Testament yes you
[1:33:43] can redeem your time back you redeem it
[1:33:48] well Jesse can you come over and pray
[1:33:50] for my house and and so I can do better
[1:33:52] in my house well I could or you could
[1:33:54] redeem it i I've done that people's
[1:33:58] house I'll take oh I'll now put on their
[1:34:00] house which that's a good thing to do I
[1:34:02] think I put oil up here on one of these
[1:34:03] I know I put oil we anointed these one
[1:34:07] time maybe it maybe it kind of operated
[1:34:11] but I've anointed every room in in this
[1:34:13] place and I could do that but then it's
[1:34:16] me redeeming for you but the Bible said
[1:34:20] you redeem the time you do it if you've
[1:34:25] lost it you go redeem it right and I've
[1:34:31] been reading this book lately actually
[1:34:33] listened to audio book I like this guy
[1:34:34] he's a Christian but he's really he's
[1:34:36] all about productivity and getting
[1:34:37] things done and it's really helped me it
[1:34:39] actually helped me write my book I'm
[1:34:41] gonna I'm gonna send my email maybe this
[1:34:42] week I'm gonna put a picture of his book
[1:34:44] in my book and hopefully he'll read my
[1:34:46] book cuz then he'll know about brother I
[1:34:48] doubt he will but you never know I want
[1:34:51] to thank him because he really helped me
[1:34:53] focus and cut out anything I didn't have
[1:34:55] to do and focus enough so I could still
[1:34:57] preach write a book so do YouTube videos
[1:34:59] do all these things cuz I cut out the
[1:35:00] things I didn't have to do now here's
[1:35:02] where he goes through these limiting
[1:35:04] beliefs now this is what you and now
[1:35:05] I've got to cast down
[1:35:07] see Satan might have gotten got into
[1:35:10] your life in a bad habit and now you
[1:35:11] just say I just don't have enough time
[1:35:13] to serve God don't raise your hands but
[1:35:18] how many have thought that this week I
[1:35:19] just don't have enough time to do what
[1:35:21] God wants me to do I really would like
[1:35:23] to invest in what God's called me to do
[1:35:25] but I just don't have enough time well
[1:35:30] this is me now this is not Michael hi
[1:35:32] you don't put bible scriptures in his
[1:35:33] books that's someone really Authority I
[1:35:38] got my books as God's Word right only
[1:35:41] Authority anybody has so instead of
[1:35:43] saying I don't enough time the fact is
[1:35:45] God gives everyone the same amount of
[1:35:47] time
[1:35:47] everyone has free time everyone whether
[1:35:51] it's five minutes on your phone or 10
[1:35:53] minutes here in the morning 10 minutes
[1:35:55] before you go to bed everybody has free
[1:35:56] time god only expects you to invest your
[1:35:59] free time that you have in the talents
[1:36:02] that he's given you and remember you
[1:36:04] have to answer for them your dad's not
[1:36:07] gonna answer them your spinner wife's
[1:36:08] not gonna answer for your gifts God's
[1:36:10] given you gifts and you've got an answer
[1:36:11] for them so that excuse doesn't work
[1:36:17] well I don't have enough time no you you
[1:36:19] have time you have the same amount of
[1:36:21] time as we all have this is the one
[1:36:26] thing you can redeem church is the one
[1:36:28] thing you can do better this is the one
[1:36:30] time where you can be like I went to the
[1:36:33] enemy's camp and I took back what he
[1:36:34] stole from me I don't know how you can
[1:36:37] do that in other ways do you you can't
[1:36:39] do that with salvation you can't go get
[1:36:41] the Holy Ghost at your loss because you
[1:36:42] can't lose the Holy Ones to see them to
[1:36:44] the kingdom of God but it's the one
[1:36:48] thing that you can be like Joshua and go
[1:36:52] possess the land amen it used to be ours
[1:36:55] it used to be but we're taking it back
[1:36:58] were redeeming it back by the authority
[1:37:00] of God well I'm just not that discipline
[1:37:05] like you brother or sister you're just
[1:37:08] your sister you're so much more
[1:37:09] discipline than me
[1:37:11] I wasn't born that way see you were born
[1:37:13] to be disciplined huh well the Bible
[1:37:17] said you were born in sin and shapen in
[1:37:19] iniquity
[1:37:21] come to the world speaking lies are
[1:37:24] gonna be different today the Bible said
[1:37:28] you're shaped in iniquity and in sin did
[1:37:30] my mother conceive me the fact is were
[1:37:34] all born in sin the truth is that
[1:37:37] discipline or self-control is actually
[1:37:40] called temperance in the Bible the
[1:37:43] church said well this must be hittin a
[1:37:45] real weak spot which is good then we'll
[1:37:49] be a strong spot next week thank you all
[1:37:51] right well I'm just a discipline is you
[1:37:56] huh well last time I checked discipline
[1:38:00] is one of the one of the attributes that
[1:38:02] God adds to your character before listen
[1:38:07] to be before you get the Holy Ghost
[1:38:11] before and then after you get the Holy
[1:38:14] Ghost it's a fruit that everybody can
[1:38:16] see these grapes my look at these
[1:38:20] delicious bananas look at look at these
[1:38:22] peppers I like them too look at these my
[1:38:30] everybody can see the fruits from your
[1:38:32] life see the truth is that it must be
[1:38:38] added to you when you surrender your
[1:38:41] rights to the opposite thing so
[1:38:43] discipline comes to every Christian as
[1:38:46] long as they surrender their sensual
[1:38:48] desires and then the greater level of
[1:38:53] temperance after born-again is fruit of
[1:38:56] the Holy Spirit now remember this now I
[1:38:59] didn't want to do that okay so in order
[1:39:03] to get each attribute church remember
[1:39:05] what you have to do I preached this for
[1:39:07] you yeah I don't mean to go through all
[1:39:08] the steps so temperance is right here so
[1:39:11] before you get the Holy Ghost charity
[1:39:14] you got to die essential cravings that
[1:39:17] means self-control that means discipline
[1:39:20] you've got to be discipline and keep
[1:39:22] this body under discipline and that's
[1:39:25] the way the fourth step of getting to
[1:39:26] the Holy Ghost for the fourth that
[1:39:28] should be rather well you you're just
[1:39:31] born more discipline no
[1:39:34] you or I weren't born with it but it
[1:39:36] sure helped us God gave it just before
[1:39:38] we were born of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:39] Oh forgive me I happy now look God will
[1:39:45] give you discipline but you got to die
[1:39:47] out and say God forgive me I don't want
[1:39:49] ever want to do that again replace my
[1:39:53] less with obedience in order to get each
[1:40:00] blessing from God you got to die out too
[1:40:02] whenever the opposite temptation is if
[1:40:04] you want faith to be save guess what
[1:40:06] you've got to crucify your own belief
[1:40:08] right so tempers can be losing control
[1:40:14] and remember after you get the Holy
[1:40:16] Ghost
[1:40:17] then you program said have you go there
[1:40:20] to get the full armor of God then you
[1:40:21] start producing fruits of the spirit and
[1:40:23] one of those is discipline or more
[1:40:26] temperance as we serve God longer we
[1:40:30] should have more dedication to God more
[1:40:33] disciplined well I just can't get up
[1:40:36] early and pray well you got to take out
[1:40:38] that camp I'm going to start getting up
[1:40:43] early to pray by God's grace grace of
[1:40:49] Lord well I just can't read my Bible
[1:40:51] every day now it's gonna take that Kant
[1:40:53] out he's gonna take that posture fritti
[1:40:55] out I can read my Bible every Lord
[1:40:57] I can't witness like I ought to God's
[1:41:03] gonna take that can't doubt he's gonna
[1:41:04] put a can in there right it says as you
[1:41:09] grow as you become a Christian
[1:41:11] discipline is one of the main things
[1:41:13] involved you got to have that step four
[1:41:16] before you get the Holy Ghost and you
[1:41:17] got to have it after you get the Holy
[1:41:19] Ghost now I'm gonna skip this right well
[1:41:23] here let me yeah so this is a preaches
[1:41:27] three years ago so faith is assumptions
[1:41:29] need to choose the right way that's
[1:41:31] faith didn't say getting baptized
[1:41:32] virtues the strength to daily walk that
[1:41:34] way
[1:41:35] Rika's Ruth everybody saw her virtue
[1:41:37] she's a virtuous woman she didn't it
[1:41:38] publicly now it's just understanding
[1:41:40] that you need to know why you must walk
[1:41:43] this way I don't why do women wear
[1:41:44] skirts a wider band not cussin and
[1:41:47] jokes but tempers is a self-control we
[1:41:51] needed to remain on this way to beat
[1:41:53] your body and bring it under obedience
[1:41:55] to God's Word all right I'm trying to
[1:42:00] close bear with me what look at st.
[1:42:05] Peter judging by Andrew Andrews at
[1:42:07] prayer warrior just stayed on his knees
[1:42:09] all the time and the Apostle Peter was
[1:42:11] one of those firebrands that preached
[1:42:12] and Paul was more scholarly like like
[1:42:16] the Prophet or something and set back
[1:42:18] now I want to balance this out because
[1:42:21] it's true some people are born for
[1:42:23] different purposes Paul was born to be
[1:42:25] more scholarly to really understand the
[1:42:28] written word Andrew is born to be a
[1:42:31] prayer warrior that was going to be his
[1:42:33] major gift right but Paul was scowly not
[1:42:38] by denomination but by the Holy Ghost
[1:42:41] because he said I have been taught
[1:42:43] relations 1:12 I was taught the gospel
[1:42:46] by Jesus Christ in Arabia so some of us
[1:42:51] may be more prone to be more prayer
[1:42:52] warriors or you're more prone to have be
[1:42:55] a firebrand a fireball you're more prone
[1:42:57] to be a scholar like but all of us
[1:43:00] should have those attributes to be this
[1:43:03] discipline right here's another excuses
[1:43:07] well I'm just not that disciplined I
[1:43:09] wasn't born that way
[1:43:10] what about Philippians 4 when Paul Paul
[1:43:14] said I can do all things through Christ
[1:43:16] Church what was he talking about he was
[1:43:18] talking about not having enough food in
[1:43:19] jail look how Paul uses this scripture I
[1:43:25] don't run out of food it's gonna be cold
[1:43:28] all the winter I don't have a jacket I
[1:43:30] can do all things through Christ
[1:43:32] shoestring
[1:43:34] we're like it all right goodness can I
[1:43:37] handle this this cell phone I can do all
[1:43:40] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:43:42] my honestly church think about this we
[1:43:49] said so much for big three because it's
[1:43:51] freely given because the gospel Jubilee
[1:43:54] trumpet has blown a many know it's God
[1:43:58] knew his leave behind the other one
[1:44:01] thanks Malachi I thought these batteries
[1:44:05] gonna go out today never know quite win
[1:44:09] never know the day or the hour right
[1:44:12] gotta be ready all the time thank you
[1:44:15] sir but look at look at the context here
[1:44:22] look at the context well I'm not that
[1:44:24] discipline well I can do all things
[1:44:27] through Christ who strengthens me my
[1:44:29] people say I could I could never handle
[1:44:31] seven children well I can do all things
[1:44:34] through Christ who strengthens me I'm
[1:44:36] talking about people who just don't like
[1:44:37] children now I'm not talking about
[1:44:39] people that you know physically can't
[1:44:42] and God won't give them a miracle right
[1:44:44] all these excuses people make well I
[1:44:47] just can't I can never do that
[1:44:48] well it depends what it is if God calls
[1:44:52] you to do it if God's calling you to be
[1:44:54] no discipline if God's calling you to
[1:44:56] live closer to him then you can do all
[1:44:58] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:45:00] you the things that there's just each
[1:45:02] strength and we're straight come from
[1:45:05] poor and obedience I better say that too
[1:45:11] you can pray all day but if you don't
[1:45:13] obey God's Word your prayers did not
[1:45:14] pass the ceiling praise God that right
[1:45:19] about said Jesus that you pray to be in
[1:45:22] vain
[1:45:23] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:45:24] of men because they never would repent
[1:45:27] their prayers hit the ceiling boom back
[1:45:29] drop back down oh we want prayers that
[1:45:31] reach heaven like last Sunday sister
[1:45:33] Brenda that's the kind of prayers we
[1:45:34] want amen on an area that when we pray
[1:45:38] they go right through the ceiling amen
[1:45:41] straight to the white throne the golden
[1:45:43] throne of God and then Christ the
[1:45:45] intercessor intercedes mediax further is
[1:45:48] this the right time and father says yes
[1:45:50] and then the Sun the meteor sends the
[1:45:52] answer right back down there oh honey oh
[1:45:56] yeah thank God for that Amen Church you
[1:46:00] can do all things through Christ if
[1:46:02] Christ has called you to it you can do
[1:46:03] all things through Christ who
[1:46:04] strengthens you if this man could go
[1:46:07] without food or water hungry I know how
[1:46:09] to be full and hungry we know a lot
[1:46:11] about this we don't know a lot about
[1:46:13] that
[1:46:14] we know we don't know how this sufferer
[1:46:17] needs we don't know a lot about that but
[1:46:22] we do know about spiritual needs we need
[1:46:25] we need God we need to accept God's help
[1:46:28] for our spiritual needs well I'm not
[1:46:31] really in control of my time brother
[1:46:33] Jesse
[1:46:33] well that's because you may have let the
[1:46:36] devil play a trick and you know worship
[1:46:37] and your job right if you've let
[1:46:42] somebody take control of your time so
[1:46:44] much so your employer that you don't
[1:46:46] even control your time shame on you
[1:46:47] you're officially worshiping your job
[1:46:50] and that's called idolatry because the
[1:46:55] Bible said you redeem the time so repent
[1:47:00] pray for another job you may have made
[1:47:02] an idol out of a hobby relationship side
[1:47:04] Java all these things I don't have time
[1:47:06] to get closer to God you know you do you
[1:47:08] just got to go redeem it
[1:47:10] repent redeem back your rights well I
[1:47:15] tried to before brother Jesse didn't
[1:47:17] work well perhaps it wasn't the season
[1:47:19] that could be that could be one thing
[1:47:21] maybe it wasn't God's time and season
[1:47:22] the other reason because you haven't
[1:47:26] died out all the way right Church well I
[1:47:30] just I tried it well the last time I
[1:47:33] checked everybody that tried the day of
[1:47:34] Pentecost got the Holy Ghost and it
[1:47:37] started changing their life where people
[1:47:39] said you your life has been turned
[1:47:42] upside down amen hallelujah that's what
[1:47:46] everybody's family ought to say about
[1:47:48] you and I that if we only got the Holy
[1:47:50] Ghost something that happened to Bill
[1:47:51] Jesse and turned him upside down oh yeah
[1:47:57] because everybody there tried it and
[1:47:59] they liked it and it work for them that
[1:48:01] means it has to work for you and I today
[1:48:03] and then we got to come god it's
[1:48:06] provided way hallelujah
[1:48:09] Paul says Christians are dead to sin we
[1:48:12] cannot live any longer there and
[1:48:13] according to Roman's 6 1 & 2 lucubra
[1:48:18] Abraham says
[1:48:18] sandor feet I've ever stop right here
[1:48:20] yeah let me show how many slides I got
[1:48:21] here yeah I better stop right there man
[1:48:24] I got about 212 more slides there let me
[1:48:27] stop right here Malakai you come to the
[1:48:30] piano sir
[1:48:45] bad habits our demon spirits that have
[1:48:49] influenced our minds right if we say we
[1:48:55] don't have enough time I can't do this
[1:48:57] can't do that can I can't have a closer
[1:49:01] walk I'm not in control of my time then
[1:49:03] you can tell that devil say devil I
[1:49:06] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:07] it is written that I as a Christian can
[1:49:10] redeem the time because I know what the
[1:49:12] will of God is now then you'll feel like
[1:49:16] Jesus when he said it is written devil
[1:49:18] right you and I have that power that's
[1:49:22] one thing we can redeem I've looked at
[1:49:25] the word redeemed that's all I've ever
[1:49:26] found it says something that we can
[1:49:29] redeem praise God amen remember that
[1:49:34] Cobra had said he said I never didn't
[1:49:36] steal anything in our life except one
[1:49:37] thing and that's God's time he stole one
[1:49:40] thing he never stole money he never sold
[1:49:42] magazines he never stole food
[1:49:44] he said stole one thing that was God's
[1:49:46] time for my life my God's free time the
[1:49:50] free time rather would rather God had
[1:49:51] given me that I was supposed to devote
[1:49:53] to him and I didn't use it for him I'm
[1:50:00] sorry here's the last quote we need to
[1:50:03] go back to the power of God something
[1:50:05] that can do the same thing today brother
[1:50:07] BAM says about the Jubilee persecution
[1:50:10] always gives strength to the church
[1:50:13] we've had it too easy we get slothful we
[1:50:18] get the place where we don't want to
[1:50:19] move on you never been there don't feel
[1:50:22] like moving on with God because
[1:50:26] everything
[1:50:26] just handed to us the hamster takes
[1:50:31] sorrow tears sweat and prayer and faith
[1:50:34] and promise to move forward in the power
[1:50:37] of the Holy Spirit everybody repeat
[1:50:40] after me everybody say sorrow that's the
[1:50:44] first thing it takes to move on with God
[1:50:45] everybody say tears everybody say sweat
[1:50:50] everybody say prayer everybody say faith
[1:50:54] everybody say promise man I'm just
[1:50:57] quoting him I'm not trying to make a
[1:50:58] doctrine on those six things I tell you
[1:51:00] I'll get you anointed six is the number
[1:51:01] of anointed man that I'll get you know
[1:51:03] me too right there you start playing you
[1:51:05] start sorrow and tears sweating up glory
[1:51:08] pretty soon you're gonna be anointed but
[1:51:13] man said that zeal and power that they
[1:51:15] had in those days has long time vanished
[1:51:18] from our assemblies I'm afraid if the
[1:51:20] windows would be shot out again people
[1:51:22] run every way and never come back again
[1:51:23] he's talking about how they would shoot
[1:51:25] at Windows and Pentecost but the people
[1:51:26] would stay there and the bullets
[1:51:28] wouldn't kill people because the power
[1:51:30] of God was so strong there my goodness
[1:51:35] now Church let's bow our heads for a
[1:51:39] moment here that's what I felt letting
[1:51:42] the Holy Spirit on as I read that text
[1:51:43] my a man could redeem it back before the
[1:51:47] Jubilee he didn't have to have a Jubilee
[1:51:50] to get it back although it was a
[1:51:52] blessing it was freely given by grace
[1:51:55] but if he had a season where he could
[1:51:58] recognize we'll listen God's blessed me
[1:51:59] I can go by that I can redeem that
[1:52:02] myself all's he had to do was take that
[1:52:08] money go that individual show them the
[1:52:12] paperwork well listen I'm a Judah person
[1:52:14] I'm from the tribe of Judah this is my
[1:52:16] land I sold to you last year I want it
[1:52:17] back give it back and that man had to
[1:52:21] give it back
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:24] now as we bow our heads how many would
[1:52:26] raise your hand say brother Jessie pray
[1:52:27] me that I'll be able to move on with God
[1:52:30] that I can redeem some of the time back
[1:52:33] to God Church maybe you won't get all of
[1:52:37] it today or tomorrow but you can start
[1:52:39] getting some of it and every time you
[1:52:42] get a little bit you'll feel better
[1:52:43] about it won't you church oh my every
