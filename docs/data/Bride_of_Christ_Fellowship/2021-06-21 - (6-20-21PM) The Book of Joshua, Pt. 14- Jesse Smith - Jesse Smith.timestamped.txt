[0:09] i really appreciate that one
[0:10] he deserves our loudest praise
[0:12] hallelujah let's go to joshua here we'll
[0:14] go to joshua chapter 8.
[0:17] then we'd like to read our memory verse
[0:20] from isaiah again
[0:25] joshua chapter 8.
[0:33] last sunday we preached i'm sorry it was
[0:36] two sundays ago we preached twice on
[0:38] joshua last sunday we just looked at
[0:40] chapter seven
[0:42] the sin of aitkin and then
[0:45] today we'll look at the conquest of ai
[0:48] we'll try to finish chapter 8 by the
[0:50] grace of the lord
[0:54] so joshua 8
[0:58] verse one we'll just read verse one and
[1:00] then we'll do the memory verse here
[1:02] tonight
[1:03] uh by god's grace
[1:08] joshua eight verse one let's read that
[1:09] together one two three and the lord said
[1:13] unto joshua fear not neither be
[1:16] thou dismayed take all the people of war
[1:20] with thee and arise go up to ai
[1:24] see i have given into thy hand
[1:27] the king of ai and his people
[1:30] and his city and his land this was all
[1:34] given
[1:34] to joshua now remember the previous
[1:36] chapter he was all discouraged like why
[1:37] did we
[1:38] lord why'd you even bring us out of the
[1:40] out of the wilderness right we went to
[1:41] god we stayed in the desert
[1:44] but god says no this is yours as we
[1:47] as we'll see god is the god of second
[1:49] chances praise god
[1:50] isaiah 41. the church if we feel like we
[1:53] failed in anything i think that's the
[1:55] main thought from this chapter
[1:56] if you've ever felt like you failed a
[1:58] test you didn't pass a test
[2:01] uh you struggled you felt defeated
[2:04] take courage because god will bring you
[2:06] back to that same place
[2:08] god didn't say forget about ai he said
[2:10] no you got to go deal with the ai
[2:12] but this time you're going in my
[2:13] anointing with all the sin confessed
[2:16] praise god
[2:17] that's the great lesson we learned i'm
[2:18] just going to start with that so you
[2:19] kind of have the understanding
[2:21] it's a beautiful chapter lord willing
[2:23] the holy spirit will help me to bring
[2:24] out a few things that will encourage you

[4:48] saints said
[4:49] amen god bless you as your being seen
[4:51] and praise god
[4:59] you know each week i try to watch you
[5:00] know the uh
[5:02] the news and everything like that and i
[5:04] didn't see much news this week
[5:05] i looked at you know israel a little bit
[5:07] and and they had a little ceasefire they
[5:09] had those elections right and so
[5:10] the new guy got in there i liked i liked
[5:12] netanyahu but
[5:14] uh he got voted out he thought there was
[5:16] some election fraud which i wouldn't be
[5:17] surprised because we had it in our
[5:19] nation
[5:20] right i wouldn't be surprised if it's
[5:21] the same thing
[5:23] so anyways at least they're on a
[5:24] ceasefire but let's still remember to
[5:26] pray for israel
[5:27] perhaps at the end i'll make a little
[5:28] reminder here to pray for israel as well
[5:30] with their new leadership um i guess
[5:33] this guy that come in he was a
[5:35] protege under netanyahu
[5:38] so netanyahu trained this guy up for
[5:40] numerous years and then
[5:42] he ran against him and won so well
[5:44] apparently
[5:45] well let's pray for israel also i was
[5:47] looking at things with the roman
[5:49] catholic church i didn't see much
[5:50] news this week um did anybody see any
[5:53] news about the catholic church this week
[5:59] okay right i think i saw that too yo
[6:04] then the pope i don't know which side he
[6:05] leaned on i couldn't remember which side
[6:07] he was leaning towards
[6:09] his leftist okay yeah so the bishops
[6:11] were leaning towards right like
[6:12] dedicated the catholic uh catechism and
[6:15] everything
[6:16] but the pope is a little more left uh
[6:18] interesting and then uh
[6:21] oh the other thing the one thing i think
[6:22] we could pray about
[6:24] was i don't know if you saw it but uh
[6:26] senator joe manchin from west virginia
[6:28] he had come out in opposition against
[6:30] hr1
[6:32] which hr one if it passes it's a federal
[6:35] law
[6:36] that will change voting requirements
[6:39] and mandate voting requirements for
[6:41] every state
[6:42] in other words it'll be total voter
[6:44] fraud would be allowed by democrats
[6:46] if they pass this it could be the
[6:49] beginning of the end
[6:50] at least for america uh because all the
[6:53] states that all the states have vote
[6:54] that have voter fraud like arizona
[6:57] uh georgia they've they've since that
[6:59] election in november they passed laws to
[7:01] stop that from happening
[7:03] but senator joe manchin came out against
[7:05] it well now he's for it
[7:08] so just letting you know something we
[7:09] can pray for uh the voting laws it's
[7:11] called hr1
[7:14] um now of course
[7:17] if they even if they passed it you know
[7:18] they could sue and take it to the
[7:20] supreme court which could take it down
[7:21] or the supreme court could
[7:23] lately they haven't been ruling many
[7:24] good rulings for uh conservatives
[7:27] but just something to watch there's
[7:28] something to pray about now the reason i
[7:30] bring that up is because
[7:31] the churches have to unite with uh the
[7:34] the politicians in order to bring about
[7:35] the image of the beast
[7:37] program tells us that in the church age
[7:39] book the ecumenical move must come
[7:42] so united the churches and state must
[7:45] unite
[7:46] i don't know i don't know about you but
[7:47] most preachers are leaning towards
[7:49] democratic values
[7:51] right which would be abortion rights and
[7:53] lgbt rights all those things like that
[7:56] so that looks like the way it would go
[7:57] it looked like all the the churches
[7:59] would get behind
[8:00] hr1 in other words allow voting fraud to
[8:03] keep all these
[8:04] liberal people in power that's fine
[8:07] that's fine for them because this this
[8:09] this world is not our kingdom we serve a
[8:12] greater kingdom that cannot be moved
[8:14] praise god
[8:15] by just letting you know if this passes
[8:17] it could be a really awful thing
[8:19] and it could be another sign that we're
[8:21] closer than we think
[8:22] the beginning of the end as far as any
[8:25] fair elections
[8:26] so this would basically turn us into a
[8:29] uh tyrant
[8:30] nation right uh just just so just watch
[8:33] and pray about that
[8:34] i emailed brother joe or not brother i
[8:36] emailed senator manchin saying please
[8:38] don't support this please don't support
[8:39] this
[8:40] you know but we'll see what happens of
[8:41] course they you know it's all in god's
[8:43] hands
[8:44] but anyways we have to uh jesus said you
[8:46] must uh
[8:47] uh jesus told us in the parable he must
[8:49] occupy till i come
[8:51] right aren't you glad george washington
[8:52] occupied we went down to gettysburg last
[8:55] week or two weeks ago
[8:56] i'm glad lincoln occupied i'm glad he
[9:00] occupied
[9:00] in his time and so we've got to occupy
[9:02] in our time in the little testimonies
[9:04] that we have in our lives
[9:06] as we feel that of the lord so let's go
[9:08] to joshua here back to
[9:10] chapter eight i'll try to watch my time
[9:14] a little bit we'll try to do an hour
[9:15] from here
[9:16] lord willing we'll see my finish a
[9:18] little earlier
[9:19] uh so chapter eight now we finished
[9:21] chapter seven uh the last time we looked
[9:23] at this
[9:24] and uh here god is giving joshua a
[9:27] second chance
[9:28] now that sin has been dealt with he's
[9:31] gonna give
[9:32] joshua another chance and he starts off
[9:35] with those beautiful words like all
[9:36] angels start out with
[9:38] fear not fear not neither be thou
[9:41] dismayed don't be discouraged because
[9:43] you had a little setback in your walk
[9:44] with the lord
[9:46] right don't be discouraged everybody has
[9:48] those
[9:49] everybody uh sometimes hides sins right
[9:51] everybody has
[9:52] a little bit of sinfulness you know and
[9:54] uh
[9:55] brother branham lied to the irs right he
[9:57] did some other things that maybe
[9:58] didn't please the lord so much and he
[10:00] said lord you owe me understanding and
[10:02] you know different sins that but the
[10:04] brother branham had we know the same
[10:06] thing
[10:06] paul said there's times i wanted to do
[10:08] right but i did wrong
[10:10] right the things that i hated that's
[10:11] what i did so
[10:13] everybody has shortcomings everybody has
[10:16] failures but we are not a people that
[10:19] give up
[10:21] we're not a people that wallow around in
[10:24] defeat
[10:25] amen we're not a people that let sin lay
[10:27] around the house
[10:30] that's not that's not the joshua army
[10:32] the joshua army cleans it up
[10:33] deals with it and moves on in the name
[10:35] of jesus
[10:37] that's how we always must remember that
[10:38] we're always going to fall short that's
[10:39] why we must always come back to church
[10:41] right we must always read our bibles and
[10:43] pray
[10:43] because we're all going to fall short
[10:45] but we're not the army that gives up and
[10:47] quits and i need a break from god i need
[10:49] a year off from church
[10:50] i need you know we're not that kind of
[10:53] type
[10:53] we're the kind of type that it's time
[10:55] for the next battle praise god
[10:57] all right we've got more we've got more
[10:59] ground to take praise god
[11:01] there's more victories that we must
[11:03] press on towards amen
[11:06] right that that's our attitude that's
[11:07] how joshua's
[11:09] uh attitude was too now remember church
[11:11] that's the difference between the holy
[11:12] ghost filled saint and the sanctified
[11:14] one the holy ghost-filled saint is
[11:16] conquering constantly
[11:18] they're just constantly getting victory
[11:20] over that one over that one over that
[11:22] one
[11:22] it's just victory after victory after
[11:25] victory praise god don't forget that
[11:26] praise god
[11:27] but the sanctified one he's the one out
[11:29] in the wilderness he's kind of
[11:30] complaining he's got easy
[11:32] easy life everything's just handed to
[11:33] him they're just babied right
[11:35] that's what brother i said they're all
[11:37] babied uh but then in the new covenant
[11:39] you got
[11:40] warriors you got the people that battle
[11:42] with the sword they know how to wield
[11:44] the sword of the word amen
[11:46] they know how to cut out victories and
[11:48] and speak the word of god and
[11:50] move on to greater victories and
[11:52] experience the victory of god in their
[11:54] life they're not
[11:55] babies right they don't have to get
[11:57] manna from heaven every day
[11:58] they know how to plant seed amen they
[12:01] know how to trust
[12:02] in the god's timing that that seed
[12:04] planted under the right conditions
[12:06] it will bring forth in its time and
[12:08] season amen that's a real mature
[12:10] christian praise god hallelujah
[12:12] that's a christian they can they can
[12:14] understand god has a time
[12:16] god has a season i don't have to be
[12:18] babied every day i have to see a miracle
[12:20] every day
[12:21] because i know god is in control and my
[12:23] god is the miracle working god amen
[12:27] my great battle right and we would say
[12:28] our great battle
[12:30] is pushing out all the inhabitants of
[12:32] the land
[12:33] right all the inhabitants all the sinful
[12:35] habits and all the sinful desires
[12:38] pushing out those getting victory after
[12:40] victory right from glory to glory
[12:43] from faith to faith shining more and
[12:46] more
[12:46] onto a perfect day where we're warriors
[12:49] every day we get up
[12:50] ready to battle praise god drive out the
[12:53] enemy
[12:54] and see the victories of god in our
[12:55] lives
[12:57] hallelujah so god says fear not arise
[13:02] go up to ai i've given so again he
[13:05] prophesies in verse one
[13:07] right he's saying don't fear
[13:10] he's prophesying and said i've given you
[13:13] uh this land the king the people his
[13:16] city and his land that's about
[13:18] everything right
[13:19] it's about everything i've given it all
[13:21] to you
[13:24] he said arise and go now look notice
[13:27] church
[13:28] he gives specific directions now
[13:30] remember before
[13:31] the men just got together and said oh we
[13:33] can do it we don't we can just
[13:35] we just need three thousand men we can
[13:36] take these guys down
[13:38] look how much different god's plan is
[13:41] than their plan
[13:43] their plan will just go up during the
[13:44] day three thousand it'll be just like
[13:46] jericho will destroy him it failed
[13:50] i failed because they didn't seek god on
[13:52] how to do it
[13:54] praise god so god but now that they got
[13:57] the sin out
[13:58] now they can start listening to the lord
[14:00] again and their
[14:01] their god is talking to them and telling
[14:04] them how to get the victory
[14:06] praise god and verse two and this shalt
[14:09] thou do to ai and her kings
[14:11] as thou listen to jericho her king only
[14:13] the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof
[14:15] shall you take for a prey unto
[14:16] yourselves lay
[14:18] thee an ambush for the city behind it
[14:21] now look the spoil was all theirs
[14:25] in other words aiken could have taken
[14:27] whatever he wanted had he just
[14:29] been able to wait a little longer church
[14:32] we just got to learn to wait
[14:33] the reward comes later obey the word
[14:36] first
[14:37] reward comes later don't get ahead of
[14:40] god
[14:41] your satan wants to try to get you ahead
[14:43] of god and like like satan tried to get
[14:45] jesus well take your kingdoms now just
[14:46] fall down and worship me
[14:48] he always wants us to try to get ahead
[14:49] of the plan but we got to be more
[14:51] patient
[14:52] we've got to be more humble praise god
[14:54] we've got to trust in the lord
[14:56] and not inject ourselves into something
[15:00] okay he said i'm gonna do an ambush
[15:03] for the city behind it
[15:06] hallelujah so joshua rose and all the
[15:09] people wore verse three to go up against
[15:10] ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand
[15:12] men of valor
[15:13] and sent them away by night this is
[15:15] gonna be a night battle right i'm sorry
[15:17] this is a night ambush rather
[15:19] see they went up during the day god said
[15:21] you gotta go by night
[15:22] totally different than what they thought
[15:26] in verse 4 and he commanded them saying
[15:28] behold he shall lie and wait against the
[15:29] city even behind the city
[15:31] go not very far from the city but be ye
[15:34] already and i and all the people that
[15:37] are with thee will approach unto the
[15:39] city and it should come
[15:40] to pass when they come out against us as
[15:42] the first that they will flee before
[15:43] them
[15:44] that we will flee before them for they
[15:46] will come out after us till we have
[15:48] drawn
[15:49] them from the city for they will say
[15:51] they flee before us
[15:52] as at the first therefore we will flee
[15:55] before
[15:55] them then ye shall rise up from the
[15:58] ambush and seize upon the city
[16:00] for the lord your god will deliver it
[16:03] into your hand and it shall be when you
[16:07] have taken this city that you shall set
[16:09] the city on fire
[16:10] according to the commandment of the lord
[16:12] shall you do see
[16:14] i have commanded you so again ai like
[16:16] jericho
[16:17] god is judging these heathen nations
[16:20] that over 400 years
[16:22] to repent if they haven't repented god
[16:24] was going to destroy them now america's
[16:26] had 250 some years right
[16:28] so we'll see how long america gets some
[16:31] people believe that it's very short
[16:33] other
[16:33] it could be longer right it could be
[16:35] longer we'll see
[16:37] but the bible says we'll know the times
[16:39] and seasons praise god
[16:42] and he says burn it with fire
[16:45] he said i've commanded you see i've
[16:47] commanded you to finish in verse 8 there
[16:48] see i have commanded you
[16:50] now look and joshua therefore sent them
[16:51] forth and they went into lie
[16:53] in ambush in a bow between bethel and ai
[16:56] on the west side of ai but joshua lodged
[16:59] that night among the people
[17:01] so they sent a large group of the people
[17:03] to the west of the city
[17:05] and then joshua was going to come up
[17:06] around the north of this city
[17:08] so this was going to be an ambush and
[17:11] you know military men have studied
[17:12] joshua for years because they learned
[17:15] how to fight battles
[17:17] right there was no general greater than
[17:20] joshua
[17:22] and look where to get this wisdom from
[17:23] the holy spirit
[17:26] if you're going to get a victory god's
[17:27] going to show you how to get the victory
[17:29] through the holy spirit praise god
[17:35] you know i just i just kind of look at
[17:36] like when brother amen and sisterhood
[17:37] came in
[17:38] the lord had me preached that sermon
[17:40] about why we're not a denomination
[17:42] the lord knew what servant needed to be
[17:45] and i remember brother i sat there
[17:47] sister i remember i sat there in my
[17:48] office like wow i have nothing left to
[17:50] preach i was so tired that day
[17:52] i have nothing yet left to preach my
[17:53] only sermon left is this sermon called
[17:55] why we're not denomination why in the
[17:57] world would i preach this
[17:59] and then coo brought about 30 guests
[18:01] that day
[18:03] see god's got a word for every time in
[18:05] season praise god
[18:08] did i just say it like this i had no
[18:10] idea god was going to get the victory
[18:11] through that sermon
[18:13] didn't seem like a very fitting sermon
[18:17] but it was
[18:18] and it's just what the people needed to
[18:20] hear praise god
[18:23] uh you know and who had sat in so many
[18:26] sermons before and i preached and
[18:27] thought oh this is going to help this
[18:28] brother you know
[18:29] i love ku you know we love coop i just
[18:31] thought this was going to help him you
[18:32] know
[18:34] and you know it's just interesting how
[18:36] god brings the word different each time
[18:39] think about what sermon brought you in
[18:40] here serpent seed for me right
[18:42] sir siege show me this message do you
[18:45] remember what message it was i remember
[18:47] brother william you remember what
[18:48] message it was you told me the one that
[18:50] preached your life do you remember what
[18:51] the topic was
[18:56] that's okay yeah he was sharing with me
[18:58] out there that
[19:00] he walked in there and they you know
[19:01] he'd been coming for a while but the
[19:02] minister preached on everything and he
[19:04] thought his friend had told the
[19:05] the preacher all about his life but he
[19:08] had it and the holy spirit had
[19:10] the holy spirit had told the preacher
[19:12] all about brother william's life and he
[19:13] knew
[19:13] the holy ghost was there because he's a
[19:15] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[19:17] the heart
[19:18] amen praise god and so
[19:21] god knows what god knows how to do the
[19:24] job
[19:24] in other words god knows how to give you
[19:26] the victory
[19:27] we just got to listen until we get the
[19:29] understanding
[19:30] on the victory praise god like who would
[19:34] have thought you know like
[19:35] your dad brother and sister who who
[19:37] would have thought it would have been a
[19:38] prayer cloth
[19:40] like we weren't planning on that it's
[19:42] just what the lord brought
[19:44] right and so not not every one has to be
[19:46] a prayer cloth it don't have to be
[19:49] right but that's what god wanted to use
[19:51] that time and that was the overcoming
[19:53] word for that hour
[19:55] it's just it's awesome to know that the
[19:57] holy we're following the holy spirit
[19:58] just like joshua was
[20:00] that service we were we were just doing
[20:03] exactly what the holy spirit told us to
[20:04] do amen
[20:06] it's not the same right it's different
[20:07] for every person
[20:10] but that was exactly what the holy
[20:11] spirit i preached philippians part 1
[20:14] i think i preached like 16 sermons on
[20:16] that one i can't remember but
[20:17] that one particular had to be about the
[20:19] prayer class
[20:22] it just it was the word for that day
[20:24] right
[20:25] and so we don't know and we prayed right
[20:27] we prayed and had services before that
[20:30] right nothing changed but we just needed
[20:32] the right word right
[20:33] and then that's what the holy spirit did
[20:36] and so it was an
[20:37] ambush uh he says verse 10 and joshua
[20:41] rose up early in the morning and
[20:42] numbered the people went up
[20:43] he and the elders of israel before the
[20:45] people of the ai and all the people even
[20:46] the people of the war that are with him
[20:48] went up and drew nine came before the
[20:49] city pitched on the north side of ai
[20:51] now there was a valley between them and
[20:53] ai so there's a perfect spot there for
[20:55] battle
[20:57] so god set it up perfectly he's going to
[20:59] bring joshua from the north
[21:01] josh is going to come down from the
[21:02] north and fight in the valley like they
[21:03] did last time
[21:05] but there's going to be an ambush on the
[21:07] west now this is quite a picture
[21:09] i'd say this must have been a real
[21:11] nimble army
[21:13] because they sat there in the west west
[21:15] of the city and no one detected them
[21:17] that church every or maybe the holy
[21:19] spirit blinded them to see in them
[21:23] praise god like elijah right and all
[21:25] those soldiers they said where's elijah
[21:27] he said let me tell you
[21:28] let me go show you and the bible said
[21:30] they blinded
[21:31] god blinded them to knowing who elijah
[21:34] was
[21:34] until they got in the city and then he
[21:36] said i'm elijah
[21:38] hallelujah and just like god had blinded
[21:41] gerhaza to all the angels right around
[21:44] around him and elijah they were blinded
[21:47] but not
[21:48] not naturally but spiritually amen
[21:52] so see like i was telling the brother
[21:54] brother amen
[21:55] i heard a testimony from brother donny
[21:57] reagan and brother ed biskull
[21:58] when they first took the message in
[22:00] china they drove through the border
[22:03] i forget which country they went into
[22:04] might have been himalayas i can't
[22:06] remember which one it was
[22:07] well when they passed over the borders
[22:09] brother william they had boxes full of
[22:11] message books
[22:12] in the back now that's illegal going
[22:15] into china
[22:16] and the testimony was they got stopped
[22:18] and they said we need to search your car
[22:20] and they said okay search the car and
[22:23] they prayed beforehand that god would
[22:25] give them favor
[22:26] and the and they went back there they
[22:28] lifted up the the
[22:30] uh like the the blanket on the boxes
[22:33] they saw the books
[22:34] flipped through them a little bit close
[22:36] it said okay thanks for stopping you're
[22:38] free to go
[22:40] and that's how the message got to china
[22:42] amen
[22:43] god blinded their eyes because our god
[22:46] is a mighty warrior praise god
[22:48] but you don't have to do it that way
[22:49] every time that's just one way he did it
[22:51] and then afterwards some of them got
[22:53] daddy got arrested for a few days and
[22:54] was in
[22:55] a jail in china so see god let him get
[22:58] in but then there's different battles
[22:59] right there's
[23:00] got to fight a battle here this one they
[23:01] got the victory they might have to fight
[23:03] a battle there
[23:04] but god knows how to do it god knows how
[23:06] to direct his word to your life amen
[23:09] hallelujah god knows how to get a bride
[23:11] ready for the coming of the bridegroom
[23:13] amen
[23:14] that was years ago man because that's
[23:17] why we say always stay with god's word
[23:19] always obey god
[23:20] and god will do signs miracles and
[23:22] wonders to back up his word
[23:24] amen hallelujah that's what i
[23:27] appreciate i like that that's faith
[23:28] right there
[23:30] he said verse 13 and when they had sent
[23:33] the people even all the hosts that was
[23:34] on the north side of the city they're
[23:36] liars away on the west of the city
[23:37] joshua went that night into the midst of
[23:39] the valley that night he sneaks into the
[23:41] valley
[23:42] and it came to pass when the king of ai
[23:44] saw that they hastened and rose up early
[23:45] and the men of city went against israel
[23:47] to battle he and all his people
[23:49] at a time appointed before the plane
[23:52] but he was not that there was liars and
[23:54] ambush against him
[23:55] behind the city so look at the wisdom
[23:59] here look at the wisdom
[24:01] of god god kind of fakes them out right
[24:05] he kind of
[24:06] tricks them oh he makes the enemy think
[24:09] like oh this is going to be another
[24:11] victory just like the last one right
[24:13] we're going to oh it's going to be the
[24:14] same way they're going to come out
[24:16] we're going to go defeat em it's gonna
[24:17] be just like the last time
[24:19] but church anybody knows there's no two
[24:21] battles are the same
[24:24] right like i played football we would
[24:26] play a team
[24:27] and maybe beat them the first time but
[24:28] then maybe lose the second time
[24:30] because every battle's different you
[24:32] gotta approach circumstances are
[24:34] different the next time
[24:36] but see that but god outsmarted the
[24:38] enemy this time
[24:39] god always outsmarts the enemy praise
[24:41] god if you obey the word and if you keep
[24:44] everything under the blood
[24:45] god is going to get the victory praise
[24:46] god hallelujah
[24:48] they just had to obey the word of the
[24:50] lord right they couldn't do it like last
[24:51] time
[24:52] they got to do it a different way
[24:57] now to never break the word right god
[24:59] will never want you to break the word
[25:00] but sometimes you have to do things
[25:02] differently
[25:05] all right
[25:09] okay now verse 15 and joshua israel made
[25:11] as if they were beaten before them
[25:13] and fled by the way of the wilderness so
[25:16] can you imagine joshua acting like he's
[25:18] getting whipped you know
[25:19] he's fighting a little bit ah he's
[25:21] running back and they think oh yeah
[25:23] we're getting the great victory
[25:25] and god knew what was going to happen
[25:26] god knew that they were gonna try to get
[25:28] some false incur
[25:30] false courage and bring all their
[25:32] soldiers out against them right
[25:35] oh my and so that's exactly what
[25:38] happened verse 16 and all the people
[25:39] that were in ai
[25:40] were called together to pursue after
[25:42] them and they pursued after joshua
[25:43] and we're drawn away from the city
[25:47] see god knows how to weaken your enemy
[25:50] think about it who's given you the
[25:52] hardest time who's discouraged you
[25:55] who do you feel like well i just hate
[25:56] being around that person
[25:58] i really don't like that person think
[26:01] about the last time
[26:02] you failed or had a little difficulty
[26:04] god knows how to humble them praise god
[26:08] like i told you that last time i felt
[26:09] like i failed with the dentist remember
[26:10] that
[26:12] the dentist was said oh god doesn't care
[26:14] about healing teeth and i
[26:15] i didn't have the words to say in that
[26:17] hour but i went there the next time
[26:19] praying
[26:20] singing uh bringing out the word
[26:23] and the first thing it was right before
[26:24] easter
[26:26] and he said oh happy easter i said yes
[26:28] happy i was ready i was ready for him
[26:30] right this time i was gonna i was gonna
[26:32] testify
[26:34] and i said yeah i said god healed my mom
[26:36] a cancer when i was in second grade i
[26:37] just get that out right away
[26:38] and sorry he's like wow that's amazing
[26:41] and uh
[26:42] and then he asked me remember he asked
[26:43] me that question i think i told you
[26:45] but he said i've asked so many preachers
[26:47] over the years where did jesus go from
[26:48] the time he was 12 to 30
[26:51] before his ministry was he out in the
[26:52] wilderness getting revelations from god
[26:54] was he out doing miracles and i said no
[26:56] i said he was
[26:58] being submissive to his mother and
[27:00] father
[27:01] and i said that's the greatest sign of
[27:04] being
[27:04] a love child of god right because he
[27:06] said this is my son
[27:08] in whom i will please if you want to
[27:10] please god
[27:11] submit to your parents amen children if
[27:14] you want to be a real child of god
[27:15] submit to almighty god amen and then as
[27:19] soon as i said that he stuck the thing
[27:20] in there started working again he didn't
[27:21] want to hear that one
[27:23] he was looking for something mysterious
[27:25] but i left out of there and he said have
[27:26] a great easter
[27:27] and i said jesus christ is alive and
[27:29] well he's risen today
[27:31] so that to me that's just a recent
[27:33] example of how i felt like i failed
[27:36] but then the next time i went in it was
[27:38] a little different
[27:39] this time i was ready to testify in
[27:42] other words i was ready
[27:43] to determine what the conversation was
[27:45] going to be about
[27:47] not let's see the first time when
[27:48] they're all fearful oh am i going to
[27:50] have surgery or what's going to be wrong
[27:51] with me
[27:52] do i have problems with my teeth you
[27:53] know i went in there all discouraged see
[27:56] we got to approach situations with faith
[27:58] praise god
[27:59] we got to face our enemies with love and
[28:02] power
[28:03] and be strong and not fear them but fear
[28:06] god amen
[28:07] that's the one we need to fear is god
[28:09] amen
[28:11] and that's just one example and i
[28:14] thought about simon
[28:17] when he witnessed to me and it was his
[28:20] idea
[28:20] to win me to the message was he just
[28:23] gotta listen to serpenty come on jess
[28:24] listen to servancy i'm like okay man
[28:26] we'll do it
[28:28] and then it's like the battle worked
[28:29] perfectly i received it praise god
[28:32] i'm a message believer now cam was not
[28:35] the same way
[28:37] cammy had to battle for a year and they
[28:39] had argument after argument debate after
[28:41] debate
[28:42] the victory didn't come the same way it
[28:44] wasn't as easy as hey brother cam let's
[28:46] just sit down and talk about it
[28:48] it took cam to see to get to go through
[28:50] his denomination and see how they turned
[28:52] down the word turn down the word
[28:54] and then cam finally said i want to come
[28:56] can i come to those saturday night
[28:58] prayer meetings and the
[28:59] the sermons at florida in defiance can i
[29:01] come and then cam comes here's the word
[29:03] they're driving home and he says and the
[29:06] and the revelation struck cam while he's
[29:08] driving home in the car with simon
[29:10] simon's driving home brother brooks had
[29:12] just preached
[29:13] and he said uh and brother simon
[29:17] bill simon said he was ready to battle
[29:18] he's ready to battle cam
[29:20] argue about the sermon right he's in
[29:21] battle mode
[29:24] see it comes different every time this
[29:26] time the holy spirit come down
[29:28] and reveal it to brother cam and he said
[29:31] he said so the name of the father son
[29:33] holy ghost
[29:34] is the lord jesus christ is that right
[29:36] simon was like yeah that's right
[29:37] that's right brother that's right and
[29:40] they drive a little further and say
[29:43] and and simon's like ready to argue and
[29:45] bring out some scriptures
[29:46] and brother cam said oh so there's one
[29:48] name
[29:49] to the father son holy ghost that's lord
[29:51] jesus christ i was like that's right
[29:52] that's right
[29:53] he's ready to fight and cam said i want
[29:56] to be baptized he said what he said
[29:57] don't he said don't don't joke around
[29:59] with me
[30:00] because he was so violent towards the
[30:01] message he said i was backslidden and
[30:04] simon was backslidden and we're all
[30:05] backslidden
[30:06] we're all we're all in the cult and
[30:08] everything like that and now he wants to
[30:10] be in the cult
[30:11] but it's not a cult it's the body of
[30:14] christ amen
[30:15] hallelujah it's the blood wash
[30:18] it's the blood boy church of the living
[30:21] god amen
[30:22] hallelujah totally different this
[30:25] victory came totally different than the
[30:27] previous one
[30:28] some of them are going to be easy some
[30:30] of them are going to have to fight for
[30:33] praise god we have to and how many
[30:35] willing to fight
[30:37] we i thank god for the jericho's where
[30:38] we just sit back and just worship just
[30:41] love god
[30:41] just go through your daily routine it's
[30:43] going to be awesome but there's some
[30:45] that we're going to battle and fight for
[30:48] we've got to be willing to follow the
[30:49] leading of the holy ghost
[30:51] to win those souls praise god
[30:54] and simon said oh yes okay brother cam
[30:57] he said for some reason i just felt led
[30:58] to bring
[30:59] baptismal clothes so simon had see god
[31:03] already prepared the baptism will close
[31:04] for him
[31:05] so they turned around drove an hour back
[31:07] to where they got
[31:08] they where they had the service got
[31:09] baptized and brother brooks had already
[31:11] got the lima he drove an
[31:12] hour back to baptized by the camp and
[31:15] that's real dedication
[31:17] but see the victory comes differently
[31:19] every time
[31:20] it's not always the same so we have to
[31:23] be
[31:24] led to the holy spirit and obey the
[31:27] directions of the holy spirit that's why
[31:30] the bible said come with a leading
[31:31] everybody come with a revelation right
[31:33] a psalm a doctrine like when
[31:37] lydia got her victory there i you know
[31:39] she had that mind battle right
[31:41] we all we thought the victory might come
[31:43] through my prayer right or
[31:44] but it didn't come that way it came
[31:45] through sister naomi's testimony right
[31:48] it always comes different right and so
[31:50] we got to be just
[31:51] willing to follow the leadership of the
[31:53] holy spirit praise god
[31:56] do all that we know how to do but then
[31:58] follow god's leading see how we're led
[32:00] see god will always lead you when he
[32:02] wants you to do something praise god
[32:04] always lead you always be kind of
[32:06] pushing you right
[32:07] and encouraging you like that woman that
[32:09] that prayed for the sick baby and
[32:11] brother branham's meeting remember that
[32:13] oh she thought well brother ram can pray
[32:14] for it
[32:15] brother man can pray no you've got to go
[32:17] pray for it see everybody
[32:19] she so in other words she had a gift of
[32:20] faith praise god
[32:22] or a gift of divine healing and god will
[32:24] lead you to it
[32:25] may god lead us church may we be willing
[32:28] to be led by the holy spirit praise god
[32:30] may we be sensitive enough to sense when
[32:33] god is leading us
[32:34] to do something like go pray for
[32:36] somebody or try to encourage somebody or
[32:38] be a blessing to somebody praise god it
[32:40] may not come the same way every time
[32:42] we got to be willing to do our part
[32:44] praise god
[32:47] those are a few examples i thought of
[32:48] how each time it may come different
[32:50] than it did before it may be a slightly
[32:53] different
[32:54] but we've got to be willing to follow
[32:56] the leadership of the holy spirit
[32:58] huh so verse
[33:03] 17 and there was not a man left in ai or
[33:05] bethel that went now
[33:06] not out after israel and they left the
[33:09] city open and pursued after
[33:11] israel and the lord said unto joshua
[33:12] stretch out the spear that is in thy
[33:15] hand toward ai for i will give it into
[33:17] thine hand and joshua stretch out the
[33:19] spear that he had in his hand
[33:21] toward this city now remember joshua was
[33:22] in the plane he was fighting right but
[33:25] then he's like act
[33:26] god's like act like you're getting
[33:27] defeated so he ran back
[33:29] and then all of a sudden he turned
[33:30] around and he stretched forth his spear
[33:33] just like moses as i was with moses
[33:37] so will i be with you amen moses took
[33:40] the rod stretch it out towards the
[33:41] waters
[33:42] the waters instead of coming flowing
[33:44] they stood up on a heap
[33:46] as long as he stretched out the word of
[33:47] god amen as long as he put his faith out
[33:50] there in action
[33:51] god backed up his faith amen so joshua
[33:54] ran back
[33:54] he finally got under leadership of the
[33:56] holy spirit held out a spear
[33:58] and then the ambush jumps out somehow
[34:01] somehow they were hidden
[34:02] well i think it was like 25 000 men just
[34:05] hidden over there on the west side
[34:08] and they come out and the bible said
[34:10] verse 19
[34:12] and the ambush rose quickly out of their
[34:13] place and ran as soon as they had
[34:15] stretched out his hand
[34:16] and they entered into the city took it
[34:17] and hastened and set the city on fire
[34:19] and when the men of ai looked
[34:21] behind them they saw and behold the
[34:24] smoke of the city and sent it up to
[34:25] heaven
[34:25] and they had no power to flee this way
[34:28] or that way
[34:29] and the people that fled to the
[34:31] wilderness turned back
[34:33] upon the pursuers i like that when god
[34:35] gets the devil in a corner right
[34:38] and he kind of squeezes his head in
[34:39] there and he just gets him in a corner i
[34:41] like that praise god
[34:43] amen he thought he was so smart but god
[34:45] shows him god's a smart one praise god
[34:48] god knows how to ambush the city amen
[34:51] he always gets the victory and we gotta
[34:53] let god get the victory so see just like
[34:56] just like david remember church we gotta
[34:58] uh we have to inquire of the lord on
[35:00] every situation
[35:03] for god's timing for god's season
[35:06] praise god this is what they didn't do
[35:09] last time they didn't pray about it
[35:11] they just thought well we'll just get
[35:12] the victory but they went and prayed
[35:15] about it
[35:16] i'm sorry this time they sought the lord
[35:17] they got the directions and the ambush
[35:20] takes the city
[35:24] all right uh verse
[35:27] i'm gonna skip down a little bit for
[35:28] time sake
[35:30] yeah none of them escaped in verse 22
[35:32] verse 23 and the king of ai they took a
[35:34] life and brought him to joshua and came
[35:35] to pass when israel had made an end of
[35:37] slaying all inhabitants of ai in the
[35:38] field
[35:39] in the wilderness wherein they chased
[35:40] them and when they were all fallen on
[35:42] the edge of the sword until they were
[35:43] consumed
[35:44] that all the israelites returned unto
[35:46] the ai and smote it with the edge of the
[35:48] sword
[35:49] and so it was that all that fell that
[35:51] day both men
[35:52] and women and were 12 000 even
[35:55] all the men of ai remember they lost 36
[36:00] but now they destroyed 12 000. see how
[36:03] god always gets the victory
[36:05] praise god god always gets the victory
[36:08] his victory was much greater than defeat
[36:11] your victories are much greater than
[36:13] your stumblings amen
[36:15] your little defeats are nothing and
[36:17] compared to what god is going to bless
[36:18] you with amen
[36:20] if you just keep god's word amen he's
[36:22] going to give you such great testimonies
[36:23] praise god
[36:26] you know brother bang i've been sharing
[36:27] your dad's testimony with so many people
[36:29] and they'll try to share a testimony
[36:30] with me none although they're good
[36:32] testimonies none of them match your
[36:33] dad's testimony
[36:34] right because our victories are going to
[36:36] be greater than our defeats praise god
[36:40] like i've been talking to people they
[36:42] say well i've just been camping out in
[36:43] my house and
[36:45] with covert i never went anywhere i'm
[36:46] like huh i went everywhere you know i
[36:48] just
[36:48] yeah really you just camped out for a
[36:51] year and a half and
[36:52] i just we didn't live in fear we just
[36:55] chose not to live in fear oh and god
[36:57] provided all your needs that's wonderful
[36:58] god healed a man who was almost dead
[37:00] praise god to god god raised him up
[37:03] you know see some amount of little
[37:05] little losses and things like that but
[37:06] stay true to god
[37:08] god will give you the great victories
[37:09] amen
[37:11] hallelujah that's what i love about the
[37:13] lord amen he's faithful amen
[37:17] so see twelve thousand men lost their
[37:21] lives
[37:22] and now look verse 26 joshua drew not
[37:24] his hand back now it doesn't say he got
[37:25] any help from anybody
[37:26] moses had to have help there when he had
[37:28] the arms up right
[37:30] not joshua that jehovah's our salvation
[37:34] amen
[37:35] the type of the holy ghost he just
[37:37] stands there and holds it the whole time
[37:39] imagine 12 000 people they got to
[37:40] ransack the city 12 000 people he just
[37:43] stands there and holds it like that i
[37:44] don't know about you
[37:45] the other day i tried to hold up my arm
[37:46] for something oh i was just like hanging
[37:48] on our fence i just kind of wanted to
[37:49] see how long i could do it i couldn't
[37:51] last maybe one minute
[37:52] but there's joshua he holds up this
[37:54] spear i wonder how heavy the spear was
[37:57] he holds up the spear this whole time
[37:58] while the victory's going on
[38:00] see he's empowered supernaturally that
[38:03] represented
[38:04] faith is in effect right i'm standing on
[38:07] the word of god amen
[38:08] i'm gonna hold on to god's unchanging
[38:10] hand amen
[38:13] i'm gonna hold on to god until the
[38:15] victory's won amen
[38:17] hallelujah i'm not giving up as long as
[38:19] i stand here and hold god's spear
[38:22] hold god's sword we'll get the victory
[38:24] praise god
[38:25] that's what we need to say too as long
[38:27] as i stand here and hold god's word
[38:28] we're not going to be defeated
[38:31] we are going to get the victory church
[38:32] amen just hold on to god's word amen
[38:36] that's right beautiful picture there of
[38:39] joshua
[38:41] he held it there until they'd utterly
[38:43] destroyed all the inhabitants of a.i
[38:46] in other words just pray until you get
[38:48] the victory
[38:49] hallelujah just keep singing just keep
[38:52] worshiping
[38:52] just keep reading your bible till you
[38:54] get the victory
[38:56] just hold it there just hold steady hold
[38:59] firm and god will back you up with his
[39:01] word
[39:02] jesus had to do that although fasting 40
[39:05] days he had to do that
[39:06] and he got the victory now look at verse
[39:09] 27
[39:10] only the cattle and the spoiled that
[39:12] city israel took for a prayer unto
[39:14] themselves
[39:14] according to the word lord which he had
[39:15] commanded joshua
[39:19] and joshua burnt ai and made it in heat
[39:21] forever
[39:22] even a desolation unto this day
[39:25] and the king of ai he hanged on a tree
[39:27] until eventide and as soon as the sun
[39:29] was down
[39:30] joshua commanded that they should take
[39:31] his carcass down from the tree
[39:34] and cast it at the entering of the gate
[39:36] of the city and raised there on a great
[39:38] heap of stones
[39:39] that remaineth unto this day look they
[39:41] do the same thing to king
[39:42] ai that they did to aiken in other words
[39:46] both were equal in their wickedness
[39:47] right
[39:49] it's wicked to steal a babylonian
[39:50] garment some
[39:52] shekels and then a bar of gold that's
[39:54] wicked when god said that's all mine
[39:56] right so both men get a heap of stones
[40:00] a heap of judgment upon them right for
[40:03] the wickedness that they did
[40:04] god doesn't like disobedience in fact
[40:08] scofield said this he said the whole
[40:10] cause of christ is
[40:11] injured by the sin neglect or
[40:13] unspirituality of one believer
[40:17] right so both of them get a heap of
[40:20] stones testifying these were wicked men
[40:24] don't follow their example follow the
[40:25] example of joshua
[40:27] that's right hallelujah
[40:32] now look church just look
[40:37] this this enemy they thought was such a
[40:39] big battle turned out to be nothing
[40:42] the one they lost to they defeated
[40:46] easily
[40:47] because they had all the right all the
[40:50] right directions
[40:51] god had given them all the right uh
[40:54] all the right word of the lord and order
[40:56] get the victory
[40:58] so the enemy that joshua thought was so
[41:00] great turned out to be so weak
[41:02] as long as sin was out of the camp
[41:04] praise god
[41:07] see people that we're afraid of or
[41:09] situations we're afraid of
[41:11] if we really just got all the sin and
[41:13] out of the unbelief out of our hearts
[41:15] and
[41:16] and any of the fears if we just got that
[41:18] out we'd see it as this is just
[41:19] another uh this is just another uh i say
[41:22] like this another uh
[41:24] testimony in our testimony in our walk
[41:26] with the lord
[41:27] this is just another uh stepping stone
[41:29] on our way to glory praise god
[41:32] this is another testimony where god's
[41:34] gonna get the glory
[41:35] god's gonna bring us through coronavirus
[41:37] praise god god brought us through the
[41:39] other ones
[41:40] god brought us through each and every
[41:41] battle he's gonna be with us in the
[41:43] future
[41:44] as long as we're staying with god god
[41:46] will stay with us amen
[41:48] he give us a second chance
[41:52] because god is the god of second chances
[41:55] god won't let god won't call you to the
[41:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[41:58] and let you be defeated this is the
[42:01] promised land
[42:02] this is the land of milk and hearty
[42:06] this is the this is the land of victors
[42:08] this is the land of permanent dwellings
[42:11] this is the land of blessings that you
[42:13] you cannot even contain
[42:14] there's such great blessings in the
[42:16] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:18] you can't contain them there's so many
[42:21] blessings
[42:23] ah it's true amen thank god amen
[42:27] so true so many great blessings
[42:33] now look at verse now here 30 the 35
[42:36] this is
[42:36] the shorter part of the chapter but this
[42:38] is really where i have the majority of
[42:40] the thoughts i'd like to share here
[42:42] so this really was the most important
[42:43] part
[42:45] because we see how any enemy
[42:48] falls when we obey the word of god
[42:53] any obstacle we're facing is little in
[42:55] god's sight
[42:57] it might seem great in our sight we
[42:58] might feel like a failure but he said
[43:00] cheer up he said get up
[43:02] stop groveling around on the ground stop
[43:04] telling god how much of a lazy person
[43:06] you are
[43:07] what a fail you are confess your sins
[43:10] stand up and let's fight
[43:12] this is how god speaks to his army today
[43:15] praise god
[43:17] because remember jesus said be faithful
[43:19] unto death
[43:20] he told the church of fire tear that
[43:23] don't be faithful until
[43:25] no unto right don't fear in other words
[43:29] don't fear death
[43:30] if i've called you to death i'll bring
[43:32] you through that that'll just be a door
[43:34] to the victory
[43:35] to the next dimension amen oh yes lord
[43:40] so see it's a it's a walk it's a
[43:43] diligent walk with god
[43:45] and we just have to confess all of our
[43:47] sin there's that thunder right
[43:51] all right chapter 30 i'm sorry verse 30.
[43:53] sorry then josh will build an altar unto
[43:55] the lord
[43:56] god of israel in the mount ebal
[43:59] and moses the servant of the lord
[44:00] command the children of israel
[44:02] i'm sorry as moses the servant lord had
[44:04] commanded unto the children of israel as
[44:06] is written the book of the law of moses
[44:07] an
[44:08] altar of whole stones over which no man
[44:10] had lift up any iron
[44:13] and they offered their own burnt
[44:15] offerings
[44:16] unto the lord and sacrifice
[44:19] sorry sacrifice peace offerings and he
[44:22] wrote there
[44:23] upon the stones a copy of the law of
[44:25] moses which he wrote
[44:27] in the presence of the children of
[44:28] israel
[44:30] now what you notice now watch this so
[44:34] joshua is following moses's command
[44:37] he's supposed to take some stones put
[44:39] plaster or some
[44:40] some some say cement uh put cement on
[44:43] these stones and then
[44:44] write out the laws of god on them
[44:48] and all the people are supposed to stand
[44:50] there and watch and listen as he
[44:52] writes them and reads them
[44:57] in other words what would you do right
[44:58] after you got a great victory
[45:01] go back and look at the word rehearse
[45:03] more of the bible
[45:06] right don't get lazy on god go back
[45:08] there and get right back in the word of
[45:09] god
[45:11] right keep your mind meditating upon the
[45:14] word of god
[45:16] because we if we don't church we'll get
[45:17] prideful right
[45:19] if we get a great blessing a great
[45:20] victory and yet we don't devote
[45:22] ourselves to god we're going to get
[45:23] prideful and we're going to lose a
[45:24] victory
[45:25] right we're going to lose a battle
[45:27] because we're thinking we can do it on
[45:28] our own
[45:29] must have been something we did right it
[45:30] must have been just our
[45:32] our charisma what's been our must have
[45:35] been uh
[45:36] our power once man because we're so good
[45:38] no it's because we humbled ourselves and
[45:40] obeyed the word of the lord
[45:42] that's why we got any victory it's
[45:43] because we finally did what god wanted
[45:45] us to do
[45:46] praise god he didn't say go have a
[45:49] vacation don't worry about the word he
[45:50] said get back to the word
[45:52] go rehearse the word of god
[45:56] and he said actually fulfill what i told
[45:58] moses
[45:59] this is actually a fulfillment but let's
[46:00] read verse 33
[46:03] and all israel the elders and the
[46:04] officers and the judges stood on this
[46:05] side of the ark
[46:06] and on that side before the priests and
[46:08] the levites which bear the ark of the
[46:09] covenant of the lord
[46:10] as well as a stranger and he that was
[46:12] born among them
[46:14] half of them over against mount gerizim
[46:16] and half of them
[46:18] over against mount ebal as moses servant
[46:20] lord had commanded
[46:21] before that they should bless the people
[46:23] of israel so
[46:24] god calls him to sacrifice here in a
[46:26] valley and then he's got two mountains
[46:28] on the side
[46:29] and half of the people are on one side
[46:31] of the mountain and the other half are
[46:33] on the other side of the mountain
[46:36] this is what god wanted them to do he
[46:39] told them to do this before they
[46:41] even got in the promised land so go to
[46:43] deuteronomy 27
[46:49] i'll tell you god is so faithful didn't
[46:52] he say he'd bring all things to our
[46:53] remembrance
[46:55] this is god reminding them of the
[46:58] covenant
[46:59] blessings and curses right after their
[47:02] first real victory where they got to use
[47:04] the sword
[47:06] before they just let the sword sit right
[47:07] there you know as far as
[47:09] the walls falling once they got in yeah
[47:11] they did slay
[47:13] but this one they didn't have any walls
[47:14] fall down this was an
[47:16] ambush right and they had more of a part
[47:19] in this one
[47:21] and god has to remind them you got your
[47:23] first great victory here
[47:25] by your own through your own submission
[47:27] and obedience
[47:28] now remember the promises of god
[47:32] deuteronomy 27
[47:37] look at verse 2. it should come to pass
[47:39] on the day when you pass over jordan
[47:41] unto the lamb which the lord thy god
[47:42] giveth thee that thou shalt set up the
[47:44] great stones and plaster them with
[47:45] plaster that sound familiar
[47:49] and thou shalt write upon them all the
[47:51] words of this law when thou art passed
[47:52] over
[47:52] that thou mayest go in unto the land
[47:54] which the lord thy god giveth the lamb
[47:56] with the flow
[47:57] with milk and honey as the lord god of
[47:59] thy fathers
[48:00] hath promised thee therefore
[48:03] it shall be when ye are gone over jordan
[48:06] that you shall set up these stones which
[48:07] i command you this day and mount ebal
[48:09] and thou shalt plaster them with plaster
[48:11] and there shalt thou build an altar lord
[48:13] thy god an altar of stones thou shalt
[48:14] not lift up any iron tool
[48:17] upon them so god said i don't want you
[48:18] working on these testimonies
[48:20] i'm gonna i just want these plain
[48:22] testimonies
[48:24] you don't put any of your work on it
[48:25] just find stones and
[48:27] don't don't put any man part in this
[48:29] right this is just gonna be testimonies
[48:32] praise god don't put any work in it just
[48:35] stack them the way i stack them i want
[48:37] you to stack them right
[48:38] don't work on it verse 6 thou shalt
[48:41] build the altar the lord thy god of
[48:42] whole stones
[48:44] and thou shalt offer burnt offerings
[48:46] thereon unto lord thy god
[48:48] now look he tells him after you get the
[48:50] victory sacrifice
[48:53] sacrifice but burn
[48:56] offerings and now notice verse seven
[48:59] there's specific offerings
[49:00] churches should give us a good clue what
[49:02] to do once we get a victory
[49:05] verse 7 and thou shalt offer peace
[49:07] offerings
[49:08] and shall eat there and rejoice
[49:13] before the lord thy god and thou shalt
[49:16] write upon the stones all the words
[49:18] of this law very plainly
[49:24] they just defeated the ai right and he
[49:26] said come up here all
[49:27] happy over here happy over here we're
[49:29] going to set up an
[49:30] altar and we're going to give peace
[49:32] offerings
[49:33] and burnt offerings and both of those
[49:36] were blood offerings amen
[49:38] in other words blood was going to be
[49:40] shed they were going to remember the
[49:42] power of the blood
[49:43] as soon as they got the victory go back
[49:45] to the blood give
[49:46] a peace offerings and peace offerings
[49:48] were thank offerings
[49:50] in other words get under the anointing
[49:51] of the blood and give god thanksgiving
[49:54] amen
[49:55] if god answers your prayer give a thanks
[49:57] offering give a thanks song special
[49:59] give a thanks shout give a thanks prayer
[50:02] do something to show you
[50:03] thank god for what he's done for you
[50:05] praise god
[50:06] and give a burn offering which is was a
[50:08] total it was a total sacrifice it was a
[50:10] total consuming of yourself
[50:12] give your it was whole devotion to god
[50:16] with the other ones brother william you
[50:17] could eat a little bit of the meat you
[50:18] could eat some of the bread of the
[50:20] of the meal offering you could drink
[50:22] some of the wine in the drink offering
[50:23] but the burnt offering was the only one
[50:25] that nobody ate
[50:26] nobody touched that one that was just
[50:27] god so lord i'm gonna thank you
[50:31] and i'm gonna give myself completely to
[50:33] you amen
[50:34] i'm gonna be completely devoted to you
[50:37] praise god
[50:38] not gonna give anybody any credit it's
[50:40] all going to jesus
[50:44] and make it really plain make it really
[50:47] simple
[50:48] the words of this law so you get a great
[50:52] victory
[50:52] that's time to get back to the scripture
[50:54] that's the time to give god thanks
[50:56] that's time to be more devoted to jesus
[51:00] completely devoted to jesus now what was
[51:03] the word that they were going to read
[51:05] it wasn't the whole new testament it was
[51:07] just deuteronomy
[51:09] 27 and 28. that was
[51:12] all just the blessings and curses
[51:15] now if you read this it's really amazing
[51:19] if you go down to jurong 27
[51:25] verse 12 these shall stand upon mount
[51:27] gerizim to bless the people
[51:29] so simeon levi judah issachar joseph and
[51:32] benjamin
[51:32] stand on mount gerizim and they ble they
[51:35] say all the blessings
[51:38] they read all the blessings and then the
[51:41] in verse 13 needs to stand on mount ebal
[51:43] to curse
[51:44] reuben gad asher zebul and dan and
[51:47] naphtali
[51:48] and then the levi speak with a loud
[51:50] voice in verse 15 cursed to be any man
[51:52] that then the levites give all these
[51:54] curses and all the people shall answer
[51:59] amen so god just brought them to this
[52:01] mountain to show you listen
[52:02] you're either going to have a mountain
[52:04] of blessings or a mountain of cursing
[52:07] god help us to have mountains of
[52:08] blessings amen
[52:10] hallelujah they'd read the law and
[52:13] everybody on the good side would say
[52:15] hey man can you imagine hundreds of
[52:17] thousands of people or thousands of
[52:18] people shouting
[52:19] amen reading all the blessings of god
[52:24] and on the other side they had to read
[52:25] the curses too if you do this you're
[52:27] cursed and everybody would say
[52:29] amen sounds like a pretty good church
[52:31] service to me praise god
[52:33] like they do that right in africa right
[52:34] sometimes they have brothers on one side
[52:36] and sisters on one side
[52:37] not everywhere in africa but some places
[52:40] they do i've seen it on the live stream
[52:41] you know sometimes
[52:42] or the archive shows of the sermons
[52:47] and so they would read all these curses
[52:49] now in chapter 27
[52:51] their curse and verse 15 they just read
[52:54] the curses if you have secret idols
[52:55] you're cursed
[52:56] if you dishonor your parents or curse if
[52:58] you steal land you're cursed if you
[53:00] judge
[53:01] uh if you don't judge right you're
[53:02] cursed if you have sexual immorality
[53:04] curse
[53:04] if you fight and kill in verses 24 25
[53:07] your curse
[53:08] but then in verse 20 eight i'm sorry
[53:10] chapter 28 they start getting into the
[53:12] blessings
[53:13] in verse 2 all the blessings will
[53:16] overtake you
[53:17] if you keep the word of god and all that
[53:20] mountain of
[53:21] garrison would say amen that's what i
[53:24] want to hear i already hear
[53:25] amen all the blessings i'm gonna keep
[53:28] the word of god
[53:29] god's blessings are gonna overtake me
[53:31] they're gonna chase me down amen
[53:34] amen to that moses amen to that joshua
[53:38] praise god
[53:38] let the blessings of god rule my life
[53:41] praise god
[53:42] because i want to keep the word in verse
[53:45] three i'm blessed in the city brother
[53:46] william
[53:47] or i'm blessed in the field either way
[53:49] if i live in the city calgary falls or i
[53:51] live out to the country in those times
[53:52] i'm still blessed
[53:55] but i'm just kind of being silly but you
[53:57] understand
[53:58] no matter where they were as long as
[54:00] they obeyed the word of god
[54:02] god was going to bless them is it
[54:05] raining
[54:06] we have to pray for the rain to stop
[54:07] here but maybe by the time we'll get
[54:09] there it'll stop we'll see
[54:11] the fruit of your body your children are
[54:13] blessed in verse four
[54:15] yeah if you left your windows open you
[54:16] better go close them that's that's all
[54:18] right
[54:19] i might have left actually mine open on
[54:21] the van
[54:23] you know check malachi you go check bud
[54:26] you get my keys out of there or you can
[54:27] borrow mommy's keys
[54:30] i'm thankful my body's blessed we can
[54:33] have children
[54:34] praise god your basket in store in verse
[54:37] five i'm glad
[54:38] my basket and food is blessed whether i
[54:40] come in
[54:41] or go out i'm blessed that's verse seven
[54:46] verse eight whatever you set your hand
[54:48] to whatever you put on your hand it's
[54:51] gonna be blessed
[54:53] and the whole mountain would say amen
[54:57] hallelujah god will command all the
[55:00] blessings on you amen
[55:02] and the people will be afraid of you
[55:06] right so you'll have courage while other
[55:07] people are afraid
[55:09] they'll be scared to talk to you they
[55:10] want to they want to talk about jesus
[55:12] they don't want to talk about that
[55:13] because they're afraid of you
[55:14] they know you're going to try to witness
[55:15] to them and give them a church age book
[55:17] or something
[55:18] they're afraid of you they don't want to
[55:20] hang around you too much
[55:26] in verse 12 i'll bless all the work of
[55:28] your hands you will land
[55:30] and not borrow that's i think one thing
[55:32] in the message where we missed i'm kind
[55:34] of joking here but the amish people have
[55:36] everybody building my house on the day
[55:37] they get married that's a smart thing
[55:40] that's where they they they kind of had
[55:42] a good idea on that one
[55:44] see because we're always going to borrow
[55:46] if we can buy a house we always gotta
[55:47] borrow unless you save
[55:48] up your whole life and then you can get
[55:49] one at the very end of your life i guess
[55:52] i mean it wouldn't really wouldn't
[55:52] matter but that's where this
[55:55] amish had a really good thought there
[55:57] everybody comes together they build this
[55:59] new couple house there's no debt they
[56:00] just they just start off debt free
[56:02] brand new home i'm not saying let's go
[56:05] be amish i'm not saying that
[56:06] verse 13 and the lord makes you the head
[56:09] not the tail oh can you imagine joshua's
[56:12] standing there i'm the head amen
[56:14] i am not the tail i'm not being pulled
[56:17] around and whipped around
[56:18] i am leading this charge praise god by
[56:21] the power of god amen i'm a leader
[56:23] not a follower praise god i'm leading
[56:26] the armies of god hallelujah
[56:28] i'm gonna be pulled around by the devil
[56:30] kicked and was kicked around and messed
[56:32] around and
[56:32] beaten around and abused i'm gonna be
[56:34] the head i'm in i'm in control
[56:36] i'm more than a conqueror in christ
[56:38] jesus
[56:39] if you obey verse 14 if you go not to
[56:43] the right or the left
[56:45] look he was shown him there he showed me
[56:46] either go one way or the other right
[56:48] either blessings or curses now then all
[56:51] the curses if you don't hearken
[56:53] you get all the curses will overtake you
[56:55] i don't want curses running after me i
[56:57] want blessings running after me
[56:59] i want people to run up from behind and
[57:01] catch me and bless me
[57:04] right like we had a guy we went to

[57:57] right i didn't ask for that we didn't
[57:59] ask them people just look at you and
[58:00] they see the grace of god on you
[58:02] and they just want to bless you praise
[58:04] god and even had nine dollars extra on
[58:07] that one i think we're
[58:07] gonna spend all the money but he's like

[58:23] family he said oh my pleasure i love to
[58:26] help kids i love to you know make kids
[58:27] happy that's just one example of all
[58:30] just these blessings
[58:30] overtaking you
[58:35] the bible said if you don't obey you'll
[58:36] be vexed in verse 20
[58:38] you'll get pestilences in verse 21.
[58:43] uh you'll be smitten before your enemies
[58:45] verse 25
[58:46] you get scabs and itches in verse 27
[58:49] madness
[58:51] a weak heart in verse 28
[58:54] you will not prosper you'll be oppressed
[58:56] and spoiled in verse 29.
[59:00] verse 35 you'll get sick and not be
[59:02] healed
[59:04] verse 38 you'll plant much seed but
[59:06] gather very little in
[59:09] verse 41 you won't enjoy your children
[59:11] see i want to enjoy my children praise
[59:12] god i have
[59:14] i'm so proud of them all that they do
[59:16] for the lord and for us i'm so proud
[59:17] i've really enjoyed them
[59:19] but see if you don't obey god you won't
[59:21] you won't enjoy your children
[59:23] right because there'll be a hindrance to
[59:24] you
[59:27] now remember verse 47 why did god allow
[59:29] this because thou
[59:30] service not the lord die god with
[59:32] joyfulness and with gladness of heart
[59:35] for the abundance of all things
[59:37] therefore they'd serve their enemies
[59:39] amen and what did god tell them to do do
[59:41] a thank offering
[59:42] do a peace offer your god
[59:47] rejoice you're a victorious army all the
[59:50] sins out of your camp
[59:51] you're you ought to be happy you ought
[59:53] to be thankful serve god
[59:54] there's more milk and honey on the way
[59:56] there's many battles on the way but my
[59:58] blessings will chase you
[1:00:00] down praise god just like you're chasing
[1:00:02] your enemies down
[1:00:03] hallelujah while you chase them down god
[1:00:06] will chase you down amen
[1:00:08] and give you great blessings hallelujah
[1:00:12] oh that's true i've lived that praise
[1:00:13] god
[1:00:18] the more you serve god the more you
[1:00:20] faithfully obey the lord the more he
[1:00:21] blesses you
[1:00:23] so god had josh let's go back to joshua
[1:00:25] eight and we'll finish here
[1:00:29] verse 34 8 34.
[1:00:34] now notice god says do this publicly
[1:00:36] read all of deuteronomy 27 and 28
[1:00:38] publicly
[1:00:39] so everybody's aware
[1:00:43] so even so listen even if the adults get
[1:00:46] weak
[1:00:48] the children can be an encouragement
[1:00:51] anyone ever been encouraged by a child
[1:00:52] before they're just their sincerity
[1:00:57] or if the brothers get weak got sisters
[1:01:00] to encourage us
[1:01:02] if the sisters get weak we got brothers
[1:01:04] to encourage us
[1:01:06] or if the young men get weary and faint
[1:01:08] the older ones can give us the real word
[1:01:10] of encouragement
[1:01:11] everybody was going to hear this verse
[1:01:13] 34 and afterward he read all the words
[1:01:16] of the law
[1:01:16] see the blessings and cursings he didn't
[1:01:18] read the whole book
[1:01:19] of genesis exodus leviticus numbers
[1:01:21] deuteronomy he just read deuteronomy 27
[1:01:23] 28 the blessings and curses because look
[1:01:25] now you're in the land
[1:01:27] i'm with you you're an invincible army
[1:01:29] the main thing is don't forget the
[1:01:31] blessings and curses
[1:01:33] hallelujah now that you're in stay live
[1:01:36] in the blessings of god amen
[1:01:39] have victory constantly living constant
[1:01:42] victory
[1:01:42] honor me don't turn to the right hand or
[1:01:44] left hand honor me with
[1:01:46] with everything with your entire life
[1:01:48] and my blessings will rest upon you
[1:01:52] verse 35 there was not a word so joshua
[1:01:55] must be interested in every word of god
[1:01:58] because he said they didn't leave out
[1:01:59] one word
[1:02:02] i like that about joshua that's the holy
[1:02:04] spirit today he's going to preach all
[1:02:06] the counsel of god
[1:02:09] then there was not a word of all that
[1:02:11] moses commanded
[1:02:12] which joshua read not before the
[1:02:14] congregation of israel with the
[1:02:17] women see the sisters had to hear it too
[1:02:19] right
[1:02:20] because their bodies would bring forth
[1:02:21] the children right and they didn't want
[1:02:23] to be
[1:02:24] anyone they don't want cursings in their
[1:02:25] bodies they wanted blessed bodies
[1:02:28] right and the
[1:02:32] little ones why because they're going to
[1:02:33] grow up and they're going to have to
[1:02:35] drive out some enemies pretty soon
[1:02:38] it was i mean joshua drove out enemies
[1:02:40] for many many years it just wasn't like
[1:02:42] a one-year battle
[1:02:43] for years and years so the little ones
[1:02:46] had to hear the words of faith
[1:02:47] just obey god and you'll be blessed you
[1:02:49] know people say that you know be blessed
[1:02:51] right they say that be blessed
[1:02:52] i'm too blessed to be stressed i mean
[1:02:55] there's some truth to that like
[1:02:56] if you obey god's word you are going to
[1:02:58] be blessed yes you're going to fight
[1:03:00] battles
[1:03:00] yes you're going to be tested but you're
[1:03:02] more than a conqueror
[1:03:03] you're an overcomer you've got the word
[1:03:06] of god god's behind you
[1:03:07] you're part of god's army god's favor is
[1:03:10] with you amen
[1:03:11] you are going to be blessed praise god
[1:03:13] because you're in the word of god
[1:03:16] and you won't surrender to the devil you
[1:03:18] won't lay on your face and defeat all
[1:03:20] the time right
[1:03:21] you'll get up and say i'll make this
[1:03:22] right and i'm moving forward christ
[1:03:24] jesus
[1:03:26] amen see every time we have somebody
[1:03:28] leave the church
[1:03:29] i could quit and give up and say well it
[1:03:30] must be my fault i'm not much of a man
[1:03:32] of god or maybe i'll preach the wrong
[1:03:34] thing
[1:03:34] i just say god i love them help them
[1:03:36] forgive them and i press on and i preach
[1:03:38] to one or two like i do to a hundred and
[1:03:41] it's also written so they got to hear it
[1:03:44] and read it all ages got to hear it
[1:03:49] and read it for themselves because
[1:03:50] everybody was responsible
[1:03:54] everyone was responsible church let me
[1:03:55] say like this everyone in this church is
[1:03:57] responsible to keep the word of god
[1:04:00] you've all heard it you can all read it
[1:04:04] right and if i get off the word then
[1:04:06] brother man say your duty bound to come
[1:04:07] tell me just give me
[1:04:08] just give me some mercy right don't call
[1:04:11] me a son of a satan or anything like
[1:04:12] that just
[1:04:13] tell me well brother jesse might have
[1:04:14] made a mistake here maybe you could fix
[1:04:16] it
[1:04:17] i'd be happy to do that but see
[1:04:20] everybody had to do this everybody was
[1:04:23] accountable
[1:04:24] and responsible before god now this
[1:04:28] remind you pull up first corinthians 11
[1:04:29] 30 musician you can come
[1:04:30] sorry about that i should have invited
[1:04:32] you earlier

[1:04:36] this church brother branham said there
[1:04:37] are curses in the new testament first
[1:04:39] corinthians 11 30
[1:04:40] and for this cause see not discerning
[1:04:43] not judging god's body
[1:04:44] many are weak and sickly among you in
[1:04:46] many sleep you can stop the livestream
[1:04:48] i'm just going to say a few things here
