========================================

and I was going to preach with brother Chris was look at finances again we want to revisit that it's been about 3 years since I preached on that so I told him we would uh Minister on that uh when he can get here by God's grace let's go to Luke 24 and we'll pick up there uh by the grace of God where we left off on Wednesday let's read verse 32 if I'm not mistaken here by God's grace Luke 24:32 I trust someone's been blessed by this Burning series here by the grace of the Lord it came by fresh Revelation just by reading through the Bible and I saw that phrase and I it just struck me that one morning I'm like oh my goodness I've never heard of this even my wife told me when I first read that title she's like what is he gonna preach on what is the what is this guy gonna Preach Today no I love you D of course you're precious U but it's just funny for me to hear that you know because uh it it isn't a phrase I've ever really preached on before so it's like a fresh it's fresh Revelation to me but you know we we didn't really get to the part where their hearts were burning as far as reading the scripture so I want to read that today uh Luke 2432 by God's grace so we want to read that and then we'll have just a short little prayer again by God's grace let's read that on three can we one two three but they said unto one another did did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures amen if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God let's pray again today how great is our God how great is his word we've been singing about the greatness of God that theme kind of got on my heart this morning so I trust those songs were a blessing father God we love you today Lord God how great you are Lord God we'll be singing about your greatness for all eternity Lord God still learning of your greatness for all eternity amen age after age Lord God we're grateful for these precious promises Lord of eternal life no greater promise than eternal life Lord Jesus so we're thankful for that and we want to go on into the depths of your word into the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to be justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost Lord God ready for the Rapture so Lord I pray you make your people ready today Lord God let this uh word let this uh sermon the thought you place on my heart be a blessing to your people and of course they know they have control over the service as they pull and Lord myself included Lord God to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit May each person get in the spirit may we follow the leadership thereof and we'll give you all the glory and praise and honor in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you being seated praise God so we look at part four here the spirit of Burning uh by God's grace we looked at uh from our text from luk or Isaiah chapter 4 the Bible said God would send the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning judgment is you judging yourself correctly by the Holy Ghost in church in most cases we're going to judge ourselves that we we're Sinners right we've fallen short we need the mercy of God how many need God's Mercy today Hallelujah we constantly need it as we go through the trials of life and we uh you know we have to avoid the traps of Satan sometimes we fall into them uh we got to get uh re forgiven and repent and so forth that takes a spirit of judgment to judge our situation the correct way then the spirit of burning comes and that's where God cleanses us and prepares us for more service by the grace of God I'm happy to be in the service of the Lord today are you happy hallelujah it's a blessing you we could be so many other places today we could have be sick we could be uh uh could be lots of different places but we're thankful to be in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah lot of people could be at work a lot of people are at work today we're thankful we're not at work today we're in the house of the Lord hallelujah and so it looks like like to me looks like justification and sanctification uh because the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given till Jesus was glorified but we saw how Isaiah I'm just reviewing just for a moment Isaiah had Burning uh of the Holy Spirit to put him into service after the death of King Uzziah Jeremiah had the burning to keep him in service to keep him from quitting and Copus and his friend had the burning to uh revive the joy of their service because they weren't talking about quitting like Jeremiah Was they weren't even under any really persecution but they got the burning that uh revived their Joy or another way we might say I've been thinking about it all week right another way is they got the spirit of burning to clarify their understanding about service because they're all they're all in question they're all sad they're wondering what's going on and uh of course we all would have been in that situation as we talked about now I want to read what brother Bram said here uh uh as after I preach this I remembered I've listened to brother Ram preach on Luke 24 numerous times and there there a couple specific instances when he preached the sermon he preached two of them events made clear by prophecy in 1965 so you might remember that and I remember the spirit just reminded me brother random listed a bunch of scriptures that Jesus preached to Copus and his friend I was like that's right so I want to preach those to you today uh as brother brandom preached it to us hallelujah now but I want you to see what brother randam said here uh the very first thing he says about these Copus and his friend brother B says notice how Jesus the word made the these two heartbroke disciples anybody ever had their heart broke by the the the trials of life you're just like oh this is so incredible this is so hard uh I feel like I'm broken I feel like my life's been broken apart in pieces and brother Ram says there're remember they were sad Jesus said so they were in a sad brokenhearted condition but I'll say like this they were still disciples how do you know because they were still meditating on Jesus even in in their sad brokenhearted moments church I'll say like this there's nothing better to talk about Hallelujah whether you're happy whether you're sad whether you're on the mountain or the valley let's talk about Jesus Hallelujah Glory he said Jesus he said uh made these two heartbroke disciples know he was their Messiah the promised word and notice what he did he appealed to prophecy he said fools slow to believe that the prophets have wrote now he never said well what does your church say about it I like that brother raham said when Jesus come out and preach he wasn't saying what does the church say or what does tradition say or what does history say he said what does the scripture say hallelujah what a blessing amen so we can see how uh Jesus approached him but I want to back up a little bit and uh and just uh rehearse as Copus and his friend now remember Copus was the father of James the Lesser James the Lesser was one of the two James that were uh two of Jesus's 12 disciples he was the Lesser known one he wasn't the the brother of of John the son of Zebedee right and the mother uh uh who tried to get them at the right and left hand of Jesus that was a different uh uh it was a different James by God's grace and vangi said James is a good name for you to choose but that's a real Godly name right there lot of good there's going to be a lot of James in the Hall of Fame of Faith that's a great name by God God's grace but Copus was James the lesser's father so he no doubt he knew his son had left everything to follow Jesus Christ and no doubt he'd heard all the the fame the Bible said the fame of Jesus went through all the land of Judea so the father would have known all about the amazing Miracles the mighty signs and wonders of Jesus and so I just want to rehearse this is how brother R uh tried to dramatize it here he said uh he said uh Copus and his friend they just started talking my this has been an incredible week uh he was saying they were singing hosana to Jesus just a just a week ago what a and Jesus was riding a a cult the the foul of an ass right a a donkey he was riding that and what a week it's been and and then to see uh how Judas betrayed him for 30 pieces of silver they're just walking along my I've seen Judas cast out Devils right I SE Judas uh pray for the sick and they got healed and how could this happen and Judas was one of our closest Brothers I I didn't suspect it would be Judas that would betray us they're just walking along talking about yeah and then and then we went to the Garden prayed and uh and then and then the arrest came and we saw uh we saw Jesus do a miracle there even when he's getting arrested and he didn't save himself he only saved uh the the the soldier whose ear fell off or got cut off by Peter and then then and then all of these Burly friends and all the disciples the Burly fishermen brother said then they all scattered like sheep from Jesus can you believe our brothers and after three and a half years oh isn't it so sad to see our brothers just run away from Jesus the shepherd wouldn't that so incredibly sad I wonder and then you know uh apparently the Peter and John ran down to the the supplier this morning and and they couldn't find Jesus but they still weren't sure and we don't know whether to believe the sisters or not you know uh I don't know if we should believe our sisters all the time you know oh and he says fools Jesus calls them fools right and they're just talking they're rehearsing and then you know then he went to the Palace of Caiaphas remember that you know and all these false accusers raised up and then they started none of them agreed none of the accusers agreed this one said it was he raised up after three days that one said four that none of them agreed on any of their accusations and Jesus was quiet like a little quiet lamb he was dumb he wasn't talking anything he was just quiet and they kept talking and then they said then they started smacking our Lord how could how could the Lord Jesus allow this they started ripping out his beard and they started spitting on him and oh it was what kind of this was what is happening here and then he was scourged and and then you know we saw his bones as he and then look he carried his own he basically carried his own cross up the hill for a while till he fell down he he carried his own cross up to his own death he was going up there to be sacrificed and he was forced to carry his own cross his bones staring at him his wounds he was covered in wounds he was covered in stripes and they're just walking around what kind of this is incredibly sad we were trusting him to be the king of Israel there's carrying around remember it was about uh uh from history it was either two or two and a half three or four hour walk now brother BR says six hours it could have been six hours I'm not making that a big point you don't understand like it's not a big point and then brother R makes it kind of a cheeky comment you know or a funny comment he said if Jesus preached six hours don't be offended if I preach six hours he said I like brother man sense of humor and he did when he preached spoken word Original Seed he preached a six and a half hour sermon that's one time I know he preached a six and a half hour sermon he said don't be offended if God's servants have to do that today Hallelujah then they said then they smot Jesus and then the the soldiers smoted him with the spear water and blood came out and then the whole sky went went black and then the and then uh Joseph of arthea took him down off there and and put him in a tomb that what wasn't even Jesus's tomb Jesus couldn't even afford a tomb he was put in a rich man's tomb they're just talking all this just trying to understand what happened this weekend I hope you've had a good weekend by God's grace because they obviously had a very awful weekend and then of course they would have t talked about how all the soldiers parted his garments remember we saw that garments were being parted they were gambling over his garments and then he when he was crucified it wasn't just himself it was amongst two thieves he had to be our perfect our sinless Messiah our Lord had to be crucified next to two Mur or two thieves why and they just talk back and forth going retelling the story and then they thought God even s a m or I'm sorry A message messenger a forerunner John the Baptist God even sent an Elijah anointed Prophet I hope somebody's hearing me today by God's gra God sent a prophet with the spirit of Elijah and then the Lord suddenly came to his Temple and they talked hour for hour an hour along the way and then all of a sudden as we saw Jesus steps out of or he comes out of maybe like maybe there's two Hills he kind of Cl steps uh and comes into view and then he starts talking to him he said what are these things you're talking about you seem so sad Hallelujah and they would they should have been sad to see their Brethren and uh to be scattered like sheep and to see all the all the the punishment and the the chastisement Jesus Took they should have been sad and I found out I even did some research too just about ties and offerings and so forth uh with the with the Feast of the unleavened bread and Passover they were only required to be there on the first and the seventh day so they were just going home between the SE the seven days of the unleavened bread the males were only required to be there on the first day and the seventh day of course they got to go home and work during the week right you got to come worship on the weekends and then work during the week sound familiar anybody that sounds like our lives doesn't it worship God on the weekends and then go back to work and so that's why no doubt Copus and his friend they were leaving because they they celebrated the day there they had the Feast of uh first fruits and unleavened bread Passover they celebrated the Friday Saturday Sunday and they're on their way home and so then Jesus steps out and uh Jesus says what things are you talking about like he didn't know right like God doesn't know about your life how many know that he knows and how many know he cares about your life Hallelujah but Jesus asks he humbles himself he said tell me what things what do you what do you understand about prophecy Hallelujah and so I like I'm going to read this quote I love what brother Bram said he said let's go back a few minutes and now let's listen to the words Jesus quoted from himself everybody catch that Jesus starts preaching to them from himself I'm preaching from somebody else today but when Jesus preached he preached from himself Hallelujah and the church said he's the word and so the only thing the word can preach is the word hallelujah God bless you brother Chris and brother man makes a striking statement to me he said watch here the word itself quoting the word himself so the words quoting the word hallelujah now we do it in a minor way because we're part of the word we were chosen to Christ before the foundation of the world so we're a part of the word quoting God's word hallelujah but we're not the fullness of the word Jesus was the fullness of the word he's the Mighty God he's the Everlasting father but it was the it was God quoting God hallelujah oh you're not going to get anything wrong when you hear that Hallelujah when God's preaching God you're going to hear a wonderful message it's going to be a heartb burning message hallelujah praise God I'm sorry getting getting new hairstyle and it keeps falling out of place here so bear with me I always wanted to grow my hair a little longer by God's grace he said the word quoting the word of himself not tell them that he was that but just let the word amen speak for itself Jesus remember he's hiding his his his his identity he hasn't told them he's the he's Jesus he's just letting the word do all the Talking amen hallelujah that's how I know no matter who comes here if they have a seat of God if they have a seat of the word in their soul the word that I'm preaching by the Holy Ghost will speak to their word it'll be word preaching the word hallelujah and there's nothing that'll keep them from hearing the truth of God's word hallelujah nothing that's why you're here today that's why you're not at the Catholic Church nothing against them as far as the individuals the systems Antichrist but nothing the nothing against the individuals because they'll be judged individually we love the individuals we hate the sin right we hate the Antichrist system but why aren't you out there at the Pentecostal Church Jose knows why why aren we out there at the return Ministry Church or something like that is because we've got a seed inside of us and it's a part of the word and that word only feeds on the word hallelujah like Jesus was the word preaching the word hallelujah glory and look what brother Ram says he says uh but he said just let the word speak for itself then they know who he was that's how we know like brother Irvin's a real preacher because he's pointing to the word right I love what my children my children notice uh we always talk about our favorite Parts on Sunday night and one of my children a couple of my children said we love how brother Irvin's absolute is the word of God right because we have so many people today outside of our church that brother Ram's the absolute or uh the quotes of the absolute and they're deceived brother bam said Jesus's word is the absolute brother bram's pointing us to the absolute but see you can recognize Irvin as a man of God because he's pointing us to the word he's got a seed word and he's pointing to the word hallelujah that's what I Endeavor to do every time I come to the pulpit brother R said it was the word in flesh now catch this the word in flesh quoting the word of the letter hallelujah praise God he said being fully identified with himself Jesus is identifying himself in the word without telling them who he is but he's identifying himself with the word that's why with a real preacher you know who they're identified with based upon what they preach if they preach the word then they're a part of the word hallelujah is that right if they preach Church Creeds or organization or Antichrist Spirit or or deeds or doctrines of the nicadan or or the Baum Spirit or the spirit of Jezebel if that's what they preach that's what Spirit thereof but if we preached the word that means we're of the word hallelujah that means we came out of the word hallelujah that means we've got a word seed Hallelujah yes brother ra said now let's listen to him quote the word he said now we all know that they were briefed of the late happenings that is of the crucifixion and the story of the resurrection and the tomb as we just read he said but now Jesus goes straight to the word of prophecy about himself self let's just think that he said this and he said a lot more about this but watch so the Bible said that Jesus let me get the verse there he began at Moses Hallelujah let me get that verse there that one I didn't have right in front of me Luke 24 he begins at Moses and begins to preach about himself now yeah there it is verse 2 26 and 27 ought not Christ to have suffered in verse 26 of these things and to enter into his rest verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself so Jesus says oh fools slow to believe all that's written in the prophets about the Messiah now here's where you know you're a real believer if you can take a rebuke from the word of God and still stand there and sit and enjoy it well I shouldn't say not your flesh won't enjoy it but your soul will that's how you know you're a true seed of God right Jesus calls them fools and then rebukes them and by the end they're like don't leave me stay with me keep preaching the word to me Hallelujah keep telling me the word hallelujah cuz you you you point us to the word of God so he started at Genesis so one of the first verses he started at was he said brother Ram said then notice Copus all the types he said what about Isaac Copus and your friend in Genesis 22 how God foreshadowed Isaac how Father Abraham took his own son packing the wood up the hill and offered up his own son so perhaps Jesus started there you all have misunderstood this thing about the Messiah the Messiah was supposed to be sacrificed he was supposed to be Jehovah Gyra our provided sacrifice didn't Isaac carry up the wood for his sacrifice and wasn't he the wasn't he the son of Abraham and they're like yeah Jesus said well the Messiah was also the son of Abraham and he had to carry his own own cross up the hill like oh I missed that imagine Church they're watching Jesus car the cross all these people and they don't even realize Genesis 22 is being fulfilled Hallelujah Church the same thing could happened to us we and that's how it was in brother Ram day all these things were happening Brother R's Ministry and very few people caught that he was even a prophet let alone Malachi 4 Revelation 107 Luke 17:30 uh Matthew 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21 all these scriptures about restitution it's happening right in front of their faces but church if God don't open our eyes we're all going to miss it Hallelujah but thank God for the isav of the Holy Spirit praise God he won't let us miss it if we really love God and we really want revelation God's obligated to give it to us hallelujah and if your eyes are open today you'll see that we are eating the Book of Revelation 10 and we're prophesying those things again we're finishing the Great Commission we're still looking for Souls down here in akan like brother Austin and brother Chris hallelujah we're looking for souls in akan by the grace of God hallelujah our wonderful brothers here that were baptized this year genev is going to get baptized pretty soon we're finishing the Great Commission every Gentile whose name is on the Lamb's Book of Life has got to be realized that they have they've accepted Christ they're Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then the Rapture will come amen so if you're if you're in the Holy Spirit to today you can see what prophecy God's fulfilling today praise God Amen you can see the churches uniting with each other with Rome going to the mother Harlot you can see that because you've got eyes that have eyes have the spirit of God has anointed your spiritual sight Hallelujah glory to God so Jesus starts in Genesis doesn't he my and then brother Ram says this he said he said Copus don't you remember Zechariah 11:12 wasn't the Messiah supposed to be sold according to the prophet for 30 pieces of silver and didn't and you just said this man was sold for 30 pieces of silver are you getting those scriptures Copus and they had just talked about it before Jesus came out they just talked about the 30 pieces of silver they had just talked and then the the preacher starts preaching about things you just thought about don't you love that when God preaches things you just talked about you just read about you just studied you just prayed about amen and that's what Jesus brings out now a second scripture Zechariah 11 and 12 where he said you'll be sold for 30 pieces of silver that's right so now look they got two Revelations on the Messiah oh and church notice with each Revelation the confusion and doubt starts going away like a cloud being blown away Hallelujah each Revelation is another unveiling so I can see more of God's plan because before they wondered was he the Messiah even John the Baptist wondered is he the Messiah see Satan brings in all this confusion but the more revelation we get from the Bible the more Bible Revelation we get Hallelujah the more things clear up the more understanding we have and then sadness must leave brokenheartedness must leave all these evil spirits must leave when we get a real revelation of the Bible Hallelujah Hallelujah that's right then brother R said and then Jesus said you notice when David said in the Psalms Psalm 41:9 he was betrayed of his friends my own familiar friend in whom I've trusted which did eat my bread lifted his heel up against me that's right Judas was Jesus's familiar friend and they had the Lord's Supper that night oh my goodness all these things happened in a matter of week and we missed it but somebody's able to preach it to us and that's Jesus Hallelujah and then Jesus said Copus don't you remember Zechariah 13:7 he was forsaken by his disciples Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered that's right Copus looks over and he bumps his we just talked about that that that yeah he's he's preaching our hearts he's preaching Our Lives he's reading our mail they say he's reading my email today it's mostly email and then so now four scriptures and then uh Psalm 3511 they'll be accused by false Witnesses that's right at the palace of Caiaphas he was accused falsely now they got five and then then the Lord said don't you know Isaiah 53:7 said he was dumb before those accusers six verses that's right he was quiet before them so in other words God's not late uh we haven't failed God God's right on time we're not we're not outside of God's plan we are right in God's plan for today Hallelujah so what are we sad about Hallelujah the thing we should be sad about is repenting of our sins Hallelujah that's what you and I need today we need for God to show us what scriptures he's fulfilling today I'll say like this in our lives what is God doing in my life what's he trying to accomplish in my life when God does that it takes all the confusion away Hallelujah all the sadness all the brokenheartedness all the confusion all that leaves when God speaks directly to you discern your situation and tells you what's your part in the word of God hallelujah amen hallelujah then Jesus said cleopas what about uh Isaiah 50:6 I gave my back to the smiters that's right that's what Jesus did when he was scourged and my cheeks and them that plucked off the hair yes we saw that they plucked the hair off his cheeks his beard and he I hid not my face from shame and spitting we saw them spit in his face so now a seventh scripture opens W this wasn't this wasn't some chaos that God didn't know about in fact this was God's ordained plan each event of Jes Jesus uh last week was a a carefully uh uh planned out event in order to fill scripture and church if we're the children of God our lives are the same way every year of Our Lives is another opportunity for God to show us what he's doing with us hallelujah and to help us fulfill what must be done hallelujah Glory now I'm just going to say something to these young brothers that might preach someday I didn't get in my position of preaching until I was 24 all right Patrick Claude Malachi where's Zion your little what's that little guy's butt name again K these little guys James where's James you Andy you know you you know there's a certain time and season when God's going to put you in the service of the Lord I was scared to preach Bank pire remembers my first few sermons I probably look like a scared little child up there not So Much Anymore because you get you get in the spirit of God you start seeing the truth of God's word but see that part of my life had to be fulfilled there had to come a time and season for that other two other people looked at me and they said I knew he's going to be a preacher someday and that's not what that's not that's not what my wife saw me when we first started dating she didn't see a preacher very little of any preaching coming from me but see it's it's a it's a time frame God's Got A Plan God's molding you shaping you Hallelujah God's ordaining your life events of life everything of your life is ordained the footsteps of the righteous are ordered Lord and though a righteous man falls seven times he rises again Hallelujah but that's right he gave his back to the smiters he had his hair plucked off his face he got spit on shamed then Jesus said to Copus didn't Psalm 22 Copus say when he was on the cross he'd say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me didn't he do that the day before yesterday afternoon Copus brother Ram says like that's right that was in The Pongal so now all the fear now all the sadness starts leaving once they realize God is doing something God's working behind the scenes even when he we don't see it you're working that sound like a familiar song even though I don't feel it God God's working Hallelujah even when you feel sad God's working for you Hallelujah God's working everything for your good praise God so again facts don't care about your feelings prophecy don't care about your feelings God's going to help you overcome your feelings Hallelujah Glory then Jesus said to Copus what here now I think we're on to eight or nine I'm gonna lose track of this but I can go back and count after service I probably don't have time to count right now he said well didn't it Al let's say in in Psalm 22 Copus didn't the Bible say in verse 18 his garments would be parted isn't that what happened that's right the Roman soldiers oh my every event was God doing something and brother Adam said Jesus looked at him and said did they do that or not see God likes to ask you a question did I fulfill my word or not now who's going to say God didn't who is here is going to with a with a with any any uh sincerity or honesty say God failed his word God can never fail the word of God hallelujah he is the word amen he is the word just because ites just because it doesn't go your way doesn't mean God is something wrong God did everything right Hallelujah your way is the wrong way God's way is the right right way because he is the way the truth and the life your life is ordained by God even the mistakes even the failures even the running away of 11 disciples that said they die for Jesus even that was ordained to Humble them see all your mistakes are ordained of God to show you how little you are and how much you need Jesus Christ now we uh our Taekwondo guy was trying to tell us what humility was I didn't agree with him but I I I agree with uh we got a good lesson on that well a lesson I say shouldn't say good lesson but if you look up humility if you look up that Greek word it means realize how little you are humble yourself in the sight of God and then he'll exalt you in new season so don't focus on how strong you are how much you know how good you can be focus on your littleness and then in your weakness God sends strength Hallelujah that's right humility is realizing I'm little I'm I don't know nothing I need God every moment of my life I need God's word to guide me Hallelujah I'm not going to make it unless God guides me through Hallelujah and they said Psalm 227 and8 he was mocked by his enemies can you put pull up therea Psalm 227 and8 he was mocked by his enemies the church now brother man's just he's trying to finish the sermon and they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake their head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver my this was written a thousand years before Jesus was crucified let him deliver him seeing he Deli him that's exactly what those Pharisees said if he's the son of God let him come down and save or let him save himself and then then we'll believe and Jesus said isn't this what the scripture said about me isn't this what happened and they said yeah yeah I like that every time Jesus is preaching you can say Amen to every word but I'm Not Jesus so you don't have to say Amen to everything I say but you know when the spirit of God's preaching and you can say Amen to almost everything that's right Hallelujah he was mocked and then in Psalm 22 again Jesus told Copus didn't the Bible say not a bone of his body would be broken and that's right we he was staring at his bones but none of them were broken and they had to break the legs of the the other thief in order to get him to die before the end of the day end of the end of the the Friday that's right but they didn't have to break Jesus's legs that's right every detail oh yeah brother said g dramatized it he said did he said didn't Psalm 22 say they pierc my hands and feet and brother R said he said Jesus had his hands behind his back so they couldn't see the nail scars in his hands so now we even know how Jesus was walking like this didn't Psalm 22 say his hands and his feet would be pierced he must had some covering on his feet there cuz no doubt they were sad they were looking down but he purposely for us it' be Hands In Pockets if you got skirts with pockets I heard those are pretty valuable that's at least what the sisters tell me but Jesus wouldn't show them the holes isn't that what the scripture said is is that the scripture Copus you're such a a good man such a mighty man fool right said really what what we all are as fools we think we know everything when things go don't go our way we complain we get sad we get heartbroke Church let's learn to trust in God and even when we got the wrong attitude God will come around and correct our attitude because he loves us so much so Jesus had his hands behind his back no doubt at that time brother R says he said Copus didn't Isaiah 53:12 said he'd die between two Mal factors were those two men uh good men or were they malactor that's right they were thieves that's right they were thieves Isaiah 53 verse 9 didn't it say Copus that he was buried with the rich yeah that's right Joseph of arthea gave him his tomb he was a rich man yes he was buried with the rich oh my goodness every event of the whole weekend was ordained of God I got a couple more and then he get starts getting to the really powerful ones didn't Psalm 16:10 say I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption then they're like oh that's right bodies corrupt after four days or after three days into the fourth that's right I like how brother says he ends with that one he say because he's almost done oh he's got a couple more that's right so he he must have he must have risen and see now they now they feel oh maybe I can believe those women maybe I can believe those lowly people in the church maybe they're not so uh uh maybe they're not maybe they're believable maybe I can believe them because I'm so high and mighty and spiritual maybe I can believe a humble little person maybe God could give a a little sister a dream or a prophecy maybe I believe that well maybe I'm starting to believe now but before maybe I wouldn't believe it but when God starts revealing the word to you and you get in the Holy Spirit you start believing all things from God hallelujah amen you start believing God's word in other words God's going to help you believe the word just like he did Abraham and Sarah they laughed at it they said oh how could we ever bring forth a child they left and God said you're going to believe it this is my word this is my plan I'm bringing my word to pass Hallelujah that's right he was supposed to rais that so perhaps he is risen perhaps see how you can go Church see how in a matter of moments hours see how in a matter of a long sermon I'll say a long sermon for me because I preach hour and a half that's I guess that's long I don't know I think some people preach longer than me but see in a matter of just a couple hours your whole mindset can change toward your situation just by one sermon and the church said one sermon can change your whole outlook and where everything looked like chaos before now it's looking like clear skies and flowers coming up birds singing Hallelujah Resurrection sunshine and all these blessings why what made the difference prophecy God's word makes the difference God backing up his word god revealing his word to you makes all the difference and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that Hallelujah the Gates of Hell wanted Copus to quit and his friend to quit and trying to get him sad and discouraged but Jesus steps out said no no no no no no these are my children I'm coming to revive their Joy I'm coming to dissolve their doubts Hallelujah and chch that's what Jesus wants to do today dissolve all of our doubts Hallelujah get us to be encouraged and uh take our minds out of discouragement sadness broken heartness gloom despair depression take our minds out of the Blackness and the Darkness and the cloudiness of that and let the light of God shine down and encourage us and let us know that God's in the details of every one of our Lives Hallelujah let me just remind you when I went out there to Iowa last summer Malachi saw it the sister wanted to give me a suit and I didn't have a suit old not head brother Jess that's what they call me online not head brother Jess forgot my suit she said I'd like to give you a suit I'm like oh that's pretty nice praise God I probably won't probably won't fit me she said just been the back of her uh it's just been in the back of her trunk for all these months and well I just give the preacher a suit I thought well thank you sister I went home I you know I'm actually going to try this on' and it fit this it's not the one I'm wearing today but it fit perfectly church that means god ordained months ago that that woman would put that specific one not another one on a different size God knew every detail in my life he knew I'd forget the suit like a knead and he knew my exact size and he knew it it didn't even need trimmed up or anything it was perfectly cut to the right inch God cares about every hair of your head Hallelujah God cares about every inch of your life God's in it just keep serving God hallelujah amen amen just do the service of God just love God just praise God just serve him with all your heart soul mind and strength Hallelujah he's got he says one more and then he looked at Kip and said was not Malachi 3 the 4Runner to this man didn't god promise in Isaiah 40 and Malachi 3 that God would send a forerunner to this Messiah brother said oh I'd like to have heard him quote that look at the prophecies Jesus is quoting to these brothers Hallelujah church that's what's going to lift your heart today you might be dishearted you might be sad or discouraged or frustrated with the economy or frustrated with uh politics or whatever more you might be discouraged by Family situations you might you might you might go through different things but what is going to encourage you is to see God actively working in your life whether you can see it behind the scenes or right in front of you seeing God is what we really need today Hallelujah to see God in our lives like I love when brother Nia told about how God healed him there that's seeing God in your life brother Nia Hallelujah to see God do it comes up for prayer God heals him he comes to testify about it a week or two later I I can't remember for sure but that's seeing God right there God's moving right there in your life and when we see that it gives us hope it gives us a new vision it dissolves our doubts it makes us remember God's the author of my life he's the author of my life he's the finisher of my life that means he's in the middle of my life too glory to God now let's get back to the scripture verse 27 in the beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself now see I could have went and got 100 more verses Jesus fulfilled I could have preached to them but I just preached brother Ram's quotes there was hundreds and Jesus had two hours wasn't it that that's right y'all remember learning that Copus because y remember learning that sinagogue that's right and so with each one it's like amen stranger amen stranger amen that's right yeah amen now you for you is amen Pastor Amen brother Irvin Amen brother Simon Amen brother Brian God's trying to get you to say Amen to the word hallelujah then you get strength and you get encouraged Hallelujah you start seeing things differently your sadness starts leaving can I say like this your human foolishness starts leaving and the wisdom of God comes into your heart Hallelujah that anointing of foolishness that we all get I'm talking about in our human Minds our human flesh it all begins to leave us so Jesus preaches about Jesus and they still don't know who he is who is this preacher man he should have been a priest all these years I wish he was the leader of my synagogue this guy can tie it all together man this guy Hallelujah Glory verse 28 and they drew nigh unto the village so after a six or seven mile walk Malachi's been going on walks here so he kind of has an idea my wife and I go for a two mile walk walk in the spring summer and fall every Friday so we kind of know what a two- mile walk's like uh triple that by God's grace they started drawing nigh to EMAs where they went and made as though he would have gone further so now this preacher who just laid out scores of verses acts like he's going to leave them right he acts like he's going to leave and so what happens when uh what happens when it feels like the spiritual blessing is going to leave the Bible said in verse 29 that they constrained him to stay and church this is what we need to remember they constrain him said you got to you got to come in you I want to spend more time with you oh that's what Lydia did remember that Lydia lyia lyia told that to Paul God opened her heart and said Paul could you please come and come over to my house that's how I know somebody's really opening their heart to God they want to have more Bible study they want to have more sermons or they want to have more prayer something like that I'm talking about when they're first Saved right right even if you get a Revival you'll want more of the word you'll get more more word more promises more uh sermons to listen to and they said abide with us for it's toward evening the day is far spent and he went in to ter with him so he makes excuses you know hey it's kind of dark why don't you stay with us don't leave us I don't want this to end and church that should be our desire when we walk out that door God let me take this anointing with me don't let me get distracted by other things don't let let me distracted by other problems and things going on life Stay With Me Jesus let your spirit remain on me praise God help me to see you on the job help me to see you at the restaurant or where the grocery store wherever I go in my home let me see you there stay with me Lord something's different about today I heard the word of God say my heart's been open my heart was burning God keep this burning with me Hallelujah let me have a burning a continual burning how many know that's called a Living Sacrifice now there we go make your life a living sacrifice unto God the Bible said present your body a Living Sacrifice keep your life as a sacrifice on the altar of God so that's how you keep the burning every day is a sacrifice every day make a sacrifice to love God to worship God to praise God verse 30 and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight this is a special kind of a friend right here special kind of a stranger special preacher I love it they pray before they eat the bread they just walk six or seven miles Jesus prays I bless this food I break it they get the bread and then now he vanishes right out of their sight they're Wonder am I having a dream is this a is this a dream oh God if it is uh let me me stay in this dream praise God don't let me wake up from this dream this preacher this this word preacher point me to the word and prophecy oh don't let this end but Jesus then vanishes and then verse 32 and then they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked us with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripture so see that's what happens in a sermon if you're really hungering for God God will open up a verse to knew you so you understand it like what is blasphemy brother Chris that happened in January remember right what that's what God does he opens up a scripture oh now I got it and that's when your heart's burning Hallelujah but you got to be hungry for the word you got to be ready for the word see they were ready for the word they were talking about the word church let's keep our thoughts and our words on God's word you know as as a pastor over all these years I see people they come in they get excited about my Ministry or or guest Ministries and then pretty soon they get tired of it what happened at one time their hearts were burning and then their hearts aren't burning something happened in there church and it's our duty when we see the word is not as important to me it's our duty to get back to our first love Hallelujah that's our duty we're all going to battle with it we all got to go through it but let's do something about it praise God Amen so I love that Jesus they they they plead with Jes to come in he breaks the bread then he vanishes and they said our hearts were burning while this man preached to us so we see it's the burning that gives understanding for the journey or for the service or it's we'd say it's burning to revive your hope in your service this my whole life wasn't in vain right this last week wasn't in vain things are not out of cater everything in the right order God's plan is perfection Hallelujah brother said Jesus won't be one minute late on the Rapture brother R says that quote nothing is out of cater Hallelujah God knew he'd be here in two 2025 so let's have hearts that are burning in 2025 Hallelujah Glory why can't it burn like it's uh 2001 again when I first heard the message why can't it burn like that it can because Jesus is the reason for my burning so he's the same yesterday today and forever praise God you named the year when you got saved you named the year when you got the holy ghost or whatever more you named that year why can't you burn like that you can Hallelujah because God will give you the burning to start you out God will give you the burning to keep you from quitting God will give you the burning to restore your vision to give you Clarity to bring back the joy for your service Hallelujah that's right bless you so what does he do after they vanish verse 33 what do they do and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and returned I'm sorry and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known in the breaking of bread now this is a very famous scripture they didn't know Jesus till he broke the bread they didn't know it was him because that's how he always broke it in other words he's breaking food so that it can be blessed and the people can eat that's how he's known and then they tie that in with the heart's burning of the scripture so for us that means when the word of God it just doesn't mean our hearts burn when we take communion although I hope it does it should if you're a real child of God hallelujah you want you want life to be pleasing to God but it means for us that Jesus known when the word is bringing forth when the word's coming forth in understanding and you're understanding it and you're receiving it that shows it's God's presence God's presence is giving you the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning and that should set our hearts on fire yes and see now they know he's risen indeed now I can believe those sisters because a preacher come along and give me 20 or more verses and show me everything that I thought was chaos was all ordained by God almighty God is in control of my life God has not left me behind my failures don't hinder God ah my mistakes won't stop the plan of God God's plan is going to be accomplished Hallelujah and I'm a part of it because I'm a believer I'm a disciple I believe in the word of God hallelujah that's right no matter what goes comes or goes one thing's for sure we'll still believe in the word of God we know prophecy will be our guide Hallelujah that wasn't prophecy the guide on the day of Pentecost what did Peter say did Peter say boy this is that which the Pharisees talked about that's not what he said this is that what my uh my great grandpa talked about no he said this is that what Joel said in the last days I'll pour out my spirit Upon Our flesh oh right church I hope brother Austin I hope we learned I hope we live to see it where we can say this is the for this is the we've had the former and this is the latter rign Hallelujah where we can quote Joel 223 through 26 where we can say wow the word of God is being fulfilled this day the scripture is fulfilled our hearts are burning God's word is being fulfilled in our lives hallelujah amen how's he known in the breaking of bread now I'm also applying this to the mysteries of God because there's 12 pieces of bread Hallelujah in the in the in the Holy place the shoe bread this is how I know Jesus led me to write that book because Mysteries are like an under bread the Bible calls those 12 pieces the bread of his presence the bread of his face so when did Copus and his friend uh recognized it was Jesus while he was breaking the bread how do we know Jesus in this message because we know God is one person Hallelujah we know the Rapture is pre-tribulation we know there's seven Church ages we know the Seven Seals have been revealed we know the Roman Catholic Church is the mother Harlot and we know Jesus Christ has more than a church he's got a bride hallelujah amen oh my glory to God oh my how was he known he was known in the breaking of bread the understanding of the word is given to them them that's what happened to me brother Chris when they first showed me they first showed me brother Ram's Ministry in the Bible they said John the Baptist had to prepare prepare prepare brother Ram's Ministry is restore restore restore and Bible verses for both Hallelujah and then when they show me water baptism was father son holy ghost in Matthew 28 and then you go to the book of Acts every time it's Lord Lord Jesus Jesus Christ so father son Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ and brother Chris the understanding starts opening oh oh you can understand this Bible oh my heart was burning hallelujah oh my there uh uh there is a Rapture it's pre-tribulation oh my there is a false church thank God there's a true church oh hell hell is does not last eternally uh you you can't have you can't you you you you you can't burn eternally unless you have eternal life so hell's not Eternal that makes total sins and where was I chosen I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world I've always been his son I just didn't recognize it till I was 19 years old brother Chris it took me 19 years old 19 years to get it but when I finally got it it was revealed to me it was open to me and now we believe it now we see God training us up as sons and daughters Glory how is Jesus known he's known in the breaking of bread I want you to see this here Jesus I want I just say this plainly here Jesus called them fools because all his true children he rebukes okaya put up uh Revelation 3:18 19 and 20 in Copus story it's a the type of the leoan church age because they're blinded they can't see and then God helps them see Jesus rebukes them and then they get on fire after that hallelujah it's a type of the the lean Church age true love will give you a rebuke well you're wrong on this you need to get straightened out on that that's true love Revelation 3:18 I counsel me to buy of me gold tried in the fire that that thou mayest be rich white raymen that they M they mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint them thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see now the whole time they can't see it's Jesus brother Austin they can't see it's like they got their eyes are covered over right they can't even see it's Jesus so they're in a leot to see and condition hey look look they're they're rich increased with goods and they have need of nothing right they're wretched miserable they're blind they can't even see what's going on so what happened Jesus has to come to them go to verse 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent that's why he calls them fools because they're blind to the scriptures and church they went to church more Faithfully than probably you or I they they probably read their Scrolls probably more faithful than some of us and Jesus rebuked them and said fools you're so slow to believe the Bible that you read read the church said amen to me too I'm slow to believe sometimes too I want to be more quick to believe but it's going to take God it's going to take the preacher a preacher is preaching to us hallelujah the Holy Ghost so see they're blinded Jesus gives a rebuke and then they would have repented because they run down they go back to Jerusalem and they say that Jesus the Lord is risen indeed now think about that they just walked seven miles what would motivate them to walk seven more it had to been the joy of the Lord he's risen indeed we we haven't been deceived Our Lives aren't in vain we didn't follow some some some mythical thing we follow the truth God's word is real we saw Jesus we heard Jesus preach Jesus fed us bread he's alive so I have enough strength to walk seven more miles Hallelujah see but they had to get rebuked and they had to realize they're blind unless God opens their eyes Church you and I you can read you can read 10 chapters a day let me just be kind but until God opens our eyes we ain't going to see it we're not going to see it until God opens our eyes and that's how God is always planned it because God wants to be glorified man's not God will never share his glory with another man or woman Hallelujah but you keep feeding on this keep feeding on this until God makes it a re reality in our lives stay with God's word how many want to stay with it by God's grace that's right we're our start an hour later like boy that's a long sermon boy just like on the road toas Hallelujah I'm fulfilling the scripture today so notice they couldn't see but Jesus opens their eyes they needed isav to see Jesus rebuked them and then verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in and we St with him and he with me now Jesus didn't knock but he was basically knocking on their hearts the whole time while he's preaching to them walking toaz he's basically knocking the whole time then he wants to see are you going to invite me in see Church you got to take this feeling and you got to take it home with you if not it's not going to do you any good that's what James 1 says James 1 says if you hear the word and forget what you heard it's vain worship you have to take the preaching Hess with you and the church said Hallelujah so see Jesus wants to come in and eat show you the word here's what it really means here's the understanding for your life here's the scripture for your life Hallelujah let's read that James chapter 1 verse 22 James 1:22 be ye doers of the word not hearers only deceiving your own self so see you we deceive ourselves if we just hear a sermon and it doesn't help us or does we don't take it out of this church we've deceived ourselves that's an awful place to be in we have to have such an a burning experience where we know we're going to take what we heard we're going to take it out there with us into the world praise God like I was so encouraged remember a few weeks ago I I said uh hey I didn't say hey but that's my regular talk I was saying you know fine do something something for God do remember I was saying that do something for God find something to do and I was encouraged last week people were helping clean and everything like that I was so encouraged everybody waited their turn to eat let all the guests go first I appreciate that that's doing something for God that that showed me that people are listening to what is preached and then they go act on it praise God you see something that needs help fix it help out praise God be a help be a blessing be about the father's business praise God God we're here to serve one another praise God we're here to love one another that's just a good fresh reminder about how you want to hear the word and then you want to go act on it you want to do something about what you heard that's why I tell these kids of first grade that's why I signed homework they're like Mr Smith do we have homework again tonight I'm like yes they're like why because science has proven if you forget about a topic and you go think about it later that night night it causes all those nerve receptacles to make more connections it expands your memory it puts what's in your short term into your long term that's why homework's so important do you think it's any different for the Bible no you better give yourself some homework praise God I'm not going to sign it like Jeffersonville I'm not going to sign you wi tape to listen to I could but I'm not going to maybe someday I will just for you know just for some fellowship but you have to give yourself homework I'm going to go home and I'm going to take this anointing with me I'm gonna take Jesus home with me Hallelujah I want to eat with Jesus the Same Jesus that fed me here as he talked to us along the way I want to take that same Jesus come into my house let's up let's talk about the word of God that's right Church let's not deceive ourselves we are not better Christians if we forget what we heard on Sunday morning or Wednesday night we're not you are not I'm not a better Christian if I forget what I preached Hallelujah that's why it's so important to me to follow up with your questions if you have a question or something like that I'm trying my best I want to follow up with that so we can answer the questions or we can go deeper in the things of God so we can meditate on the ways of the Lord hallelujah I did not set a timer what time did I start okay oh that's lightweight preaching right there I'll try to finish up here so notice Jesus comes in and he sus with them just like he says in the lean message it's a beautiful type of our any leoan condition we're blind we need to rebuke there it is the spirit of judgment right Spirit of judgment rebukes us we're blind we don't know what we're talking about we can't see it rebukes us and the spirit of burning comes in he brings the word into us into our personal gathering in our personal fellowship with him our hearts burn for more of God there it is now let me give you some of you scientists or some of you uh bonfire people if you like doing bonfires let me give you some science here the burning there means to set on fire our hearts were set on fire our hearts were consumed with fire this was a burning in the human Spirit due to a true understanding or opening of the scriptures about Jesus and their current lives how many know uh Proverbs 27:17 says iron sharpened iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend Hallelujah now Church We complain when it gets a 100 well I shouldn't say all of us some of us complain when it gets 100 degrees out there we feel like we're going to melt but to sharpen iron it takes a th000 degrees Celsius this says no Fahrenheit 1,00 to 1300 degrees fah to sharpen iron now this ought to give us a little clue here are we Sharp happening one another or not we have to make sure we talk about Jesus it's okay to talk about we talk about you know how things are going but we need to get the conversations back to Jesus because that's how it gets sharpened it gets sharpened in hot conversations where you start sharing things about the word of God hallelujah hallelujah I'm the one I got to get better at that too I got to find a way to bring Jesus into the conversation Glory that's how we sharpen one another right we got to it's a hot experience it's a burning experience like just for certain examples remember brother Austin was sharing he gave a testimony about witnessing to that woman you know that's an example of like a burn like ah he's on fire burn that burns me up too Glory you know something like that where you you're testifying about what God's done God has done something fresh in your life and it's it's consumed your thoughts amen there it is it's consumed your thinking now everybody's getting tired here so bear with me here I got Grace So forging and shaping iron takes 1,00 to a 13 degree 1300 degrees fahit if you cut it cut it with a chisel it needs to be 1,800 to 2200 degrees Fahrenheit now the average bonfire church is 600 to 1100 degrees Fahrenheit so we've had some bonfires at our house right some really big fires almost burned down the tree one time that was because of foolishness oh fools but church I'm sure you've all done it right When The Fire gets to its hottest when I throw sticks on there the heat is so powerful I have to turn my face away how many know what I'm talking about it's so hot that's the natural that's how hot a thousand degrees is at the very hot I just got to walk away because I feel like my face is on fire that's that's what this word means it's a burning and that's what we need the spirit of God to preach something to us so and we believe it and it burns down in our heart and then we can share it with somebody else by the grace of God amen hallelujah oh God oh God give us testimonies give us some more testimonies by God's grace of witnessing to friends God make our hearts to burn like it did on the road to Emmas it just kept getting greater and greater and church when is our services going to take a little higher step you know you know we go through Seasons right when is it when our hearts start burning from more of God's word that's when it's going to take a higher step Hallelujah but see it's just human nature sometimes everything's become common but then sometimes church it's got to come back to fiery hearts that are on fire for Christ everybody with me Hallelujah I know I'm preaching to the bride Hallelujah I know I'm thankful the Bible said he opened their understanding and notice Church a heart burning will cause you to rise up and do something about it that's verse 33 Luke 24:33 Lydia and they rose up the same hour they didn't wait they rose up that same hour and tried to do something about the fire that was in their hearts I've got to go back I've got to go back and witness I've got to go share the truth with them even if it's walking another three hours now of course it would have been a lot faster they're probably they're probably walking real fast this was probably the two-hour walk the other one might have been three or maybe two and a half this would have been a lot faster CU I we just seen Jesus and now we know who was preaching to us the whole time he was hiding himself but then he revealed himself and we know he's alive Hallelujah he even appeared to Simon Peter Hallelujah he appeared to those sisters see a heartburn I'll say like this will cause you to get out of bed in the morning I'm not talking about if you worked really harder than the previous night I'm talking about when you get to bed at a good time I'm not talking about working third shift our brother Chris is so kind he's like I try to get up after working third shift yes that's wonderful I'm talking about just in your daily life when you get enough rest what gets you out of bed in the morning it should be the fires of God to get up and have fellowship or communion with God if you can I know some of the mothers can't always do that because they got crying on you they got they got babies all over them I know that or I got to get up and make breakfast right away or something like that but our brothers especially our brothers we we ought to be in a place where we can raise up and get ready we got to train our families today I got to work I got to pay bills I got to make my children ready for this I got all this to do help me to get up and have a fire my soul praise God hallelujah that's what a burning heart will do and then a burning heart will make you want to tell others about it verse 35 and they told what things were done in the way how he was known of them and the breaking of bread and they'd be like yeah that's cleop yeah right I remember Jesus broke the bread that's when he multiplied it remember that I knew it was a miracle Jesus did it the same exact way and that's what we can say oh it was the same spirit that same Holy Spirit came in our service preached the same way my heart got on fire I was moved to do something I was led to do something and I rose up brother Jesse right after service and I went and did what I was supposed to do praise God hallelujah praise God I wonder if you got and I wonder if anybody here's got any finished business they're going to go do after service I hope so Hallelujah I'll be waiting to hear that testimony that's what the Bible says when God's preaching to you and you know your heart's burning you'll go do something about it praise God at hour and 10 maybe how many hour and 10 okay all right let me close with this I'll just close y let me close because I I want to have enough energy to dance by God's grace I don't want to wear out all my energy I want to be able to dance tonight too by God's grace let me read two quotes 1954 Faith cometh by hearing brother Bram he's praying says therefore father we ask for Mercy tonight in Jesus name that you'll be merciful to every sick person in the building may they all be healed tonight and may every person that kindly got the spiritual being as their spiritual arms hanging down may they be lifted tonight brother's talking about people that are spiritually down they're dishearted maybe they're going through depression maybe they're going through discouragement brother saying they're hanging down spiritually may they be lifted up with some hope in other words may they get the burning of the Holy Ghost to raise their faith a little bit he said may they be lifted up tonight May the head that's drooping low be raised with laughter towards the heavens and rejoice go from here tonight saying as those who come from amas did not our hearts burn within us because of of his presence church if Jesus is the same how many believe he's the same then he's trying to speak to every person here today I don't have to wonder about that he's the same he's always the same he's trying to stir something up in your heart he's trying to get something settled in your life and your hearts he's here he's the same today praise God he's trying to minister to every person do what I called you to do go make that r or go do something about that go with witness go tell that person about this or that God's the same so there's something each one of us must do Hallelujah like for me it was go remember I told you on Wednesday go email that Mr bof remember so I had to do that right said God help me to remember to do that get the good report do something about what you've heard today Hallelujah because we want to leave here saying did not God talk to me while I was sitting there hearing the word of God and may something be done I'll change it to this morning that would be a difference may you break the bread to us this morning in a different way than what we are accustomed to hearing and seeing may it be done in a different way the way that you would have it done so that people that's present now would know that it isn't man may God help us to know after all these years it's not the pastor it's not me I'm nothing I know I'm nothing it's it's God for he's making himself known by the revelation of his son Christ Jesus Grant these kind things Lord and lastly musicians can come okay uh Tor let's stand it is I Be not Afraid 1961 brother Ram said and on the road there come one stepping out from the side of the road and begin to speak to them explain the scriptures to them when he asked their sadness and their defeat so look Church they're in a defeated state if you came here defeated you don't have to leave here defeated in fact Jesus spirit is here today to give you Victory because that's what they were Copus and his friend were defeated but by the end of the sermon they had the victory praise God hallelujah amen and church he is the same yesterday today and forever he made as if he'd pass on by but they constrained him to come in so see you've got to constrain Jesus Jesus Come into my situation I need you in this family situation I need you in this sick situ my sickness I need you in my neighbor situation I need you my finances I need you in my health I need you you got to constrain him to stay with you and then you got to go do something about it like they did the burning in their souls moved them to go do something about it Hallelujah and when Jesus got them inside and closed the door then he did something just like he did before his crucifixion and immediately they knew it was him he vanished out of their sight by some back door somewhere Jesus SS out the back door lighthearted now listen lighthearted and lightf footed they ran back to Jerusalem telling the people that true truly Jesus was still alive and they spake among themselves and said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way so if you came in here and you could barely make it in like I wasn't watching how some you walked in but maybe you walked in like this oh I got to go to church again today gotta go well by the time the sermon was over Jesus or brother man said they were skipping along oh hallelujah praise God let's go let's go back and let's go tell about the Risen Messiah church I know there's times it's hard we all go through seasons of hardness when it's hard to come to church hard to read the Bible hard to pray hard to believe but that's why Jesus is here praise God to change our thinking to give us understanding and make a burning consume our heart our thoughts our desires to burn inside of our souls so we'll do something about our situation and not be disheartened not be dis scourage not be sad about it Hallelujah he says father I pray that you'll let him step out of these aisles tonight we only got one two three only got five aisles Jesus only has to walk through five aisles brother Chris that's it it's not a lot of aisles how many know he can do it today Lord let him step out of these aisles today into every heart and then talk to us in the next few minutes and then show himself may he stand on the platform and show himself that he's the same Jesus May the sick rush home quickly saying listen if you're sick saying did not our hearts B burn within us as the word went forth it was strange but something was talking to me all the time Grant it father that will raise I'm sorry that will praise thee as long as we live and always remember because we're sincerely asking it in the name of Jesus so let's take that attitude today if we're discouraged if we're sad if we're struggling if we're hopeless if we've lost our vision if we're uh confused may we be like those on the road to Mayas he said May the sick rush home saying did not our hearts burn within us may we leave these doors and say did not our hearts burn I don't have to be discouraged I don't have to be sad I don't have to be hopeless I don't have to be sick because he is talking today how many glad Jesus is talking today let's bow our heads for a word of prayer hallelujah thank you Lord Lord Jesus you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord in that story you stepped out right into their sad conversation their discouragement their confusion you stepped right into it and you changed the situation I pray today in Jesus Christ's name there's anyone here struggling with discouragement or fear or doubt or health or finances or family or relationships I pray Lord Jesus that Lord you'd go right to their aisle now and open up their heart Hallelujah granted Lord Jesus you were so faithful to help these dishearted disciples discouraged frustrated confused you were so faithful to step out and spend all that time and Lord we've just preached for just an hour and 15 minutes but Lord I know you're the same God in an hour and 15 minutes you could take away the doubt out of our heart and mind Lord dear Lord because you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord God oh Lord Jesus oh God cause our hearts to burn for you more Lord Jesus as as our Prophet said I know the Bible says it may the feeble hands be raised today to give you praise May those heavy steps just to go to church again oh God may they become lightf footed happy to go to church happy to F go Fellowship God help help us to talk about Jesus Lord God help us Lord God oh God May iron sharpen iron dear [Music] Lord God do something great in our lives Lord

step aside Lord God lord Jesus I believe you preach to us again today Lord God just like on Wednesday night Lord where I wept and cried said God stay in my life I constrain you Lord Jesus keep your anointing on me Lord God thank you God for your mercy and your grace Lord God you are so good so kind so faithful Lord God lord Jesus May each person constrain you Lord to stay in their lives and may
